ah good to know, thanks

---
Are 4 leaf and grim reaper working?  I‚Äôve heard there have been issues but never seen anything resolved
---
You've got about 6820 hours until you get that 7600. Keep going!
---
I don't even understand why they don't get wanted.  With the very first pets you'd get wanted at the first shot,without killing them. 
---
Now you're totally free wtf.
---
Dungeons are exactly what the burrows is though, a point A to point B trip through an environment with enemies along the way
---
I think that's what he has done. That with the fact he just bought coal looking at his post history
---
Thumbs up!!!  Thanks man!
---
I came across it today at the shooting range
---
No problem :) took me forever figured I'd save some people the trouble
---
Have my upvote. Tired of people like OP blaming the players for 'overhyping themselves'. It is such a dishonest stance to take.
---
You're my hero for the day. Server hopped and hunted every site for it most of the day and no luck. I'm coming to you now!
---
Yep, sending people on wild goose chases
---
As far as I can tell, no. It would be unlikely considering you can‚Äôt tame any of the other cryptids aside from Snallygasters.
---
Same here lol it was it's own special type of hell, seeya there
---
Do you have Unyielding armor?
---
Wow that's nuts if they're still broken. No idea.
---
Same here. 0% hit chance with melee weapons while in VATS and in range, two or three swings needed to get one hit outside of VATS.  Ranged weapons seem to have a problem for me as well. Manual aim center mass with a short scoped lever action misses 20% of the time. You can see dust fly up from the ground or wall to the right as if the scope windage is off. Ranged VATS will show 95% or better but it takes 3 rounds to register a hit. Amazing how new content can be added, but age old issues remain as if nothing is wrong.
---
Well... have an upvote for honesty, at least. You're still a knob, but you're an honest knob, and that's more than I can say for most of them.
---
[removed]
---
The fun thing is, there are so many hidden little surprises that just approaching old locations from new directions can be quite refreshing.
---
IMHO, all crafting, pick lock, and computer perks should be permanent upgrades capped by minimum stat requirements.
---
How? Those where machete-wielding scorched not scorchbeasts
---
Not that I know of.
---
Yeah this is definitely a request from the whales playing hundreds of hundreds of hours

The strange in numbers perk never works for me. Either it does nothing or it removes all positive effects from my mutations. I‚Äôve tried all the fixes that everyone recommends but nothing works.
---
I would like the ability to save perk "sets" but the ability to change it at "home" locations that way you cant be in the middle of a fight and change perk cards it would still allow a "diversity" of characters I say diversity like that cause could still just fast travel home and go somewhere  else but none the less with the perk system how it is it would be nice.
---
Brahmin are affected by Pacify and Plague Walker.  I don't know if those two bugs are related.  I ended up with a brahmin tagged "red" and attacking me because I kissed a ghoul and got cooties.
---
The only issue I had was that my final plan to upgrade the camera came and I selected it but the server crashed and I have no zoom
---
Ah, Ok thanks!
---
 I have yet to attempt taming anything. I thought if you could get one these I might actually try it out.
---
I did get a plan for the camera so I‚Äôm guessing that was part of the reward, thanks!
---
People who tag themselves after a faction that is entirely about selfishness and surviving on the suffering of others are miserable puds? Nahhhh.
---
Supprised no one has jumped on these tbh. Its going to be quite a bit before I can get on.
---
yes, give us just 3 measly configurations. they could be called ‚Äúdecks‚Äù.
---
I never claim a workshop with the intent to hold it. It would be nice if I get some goods out of it, and I'll watch it, but I don't bother fighting off anyone who wants it, and I don't hand in plain sight to make an obvious target of myself (truthfully, I usually just leave and check in every half hour for resources).
---
Eta?
---
15 minutes everyone
---
This post was made by the hard drive gang
---
20,000-25,000 easily
---
Thanks!
---
My first character is at 170. Nobody gives a damn. There are two kinds of PVPers that I am used to seeing, the guys who target sub-50's for luls, and everyone else.
---
Oooo no no no can‚Äôt do that. That would be some BS exploit or advantage against players *blank stare**blink,blink**blank stare again*
---
Shout out to OP. I've seen you dropping good PVP knowledge here and there and I've taken notice. I thought I might message you directly, but I'm hoping you'll reply here.   
---
When I see you give the kind of nitty gritty facts the seem to be nowhere available, presumably based on the kind of research and testing you described above...   I feel a strong mixture of appreciation, curiosity, frustration, and bitterness. Why is it so hard to know these things? Why is the math so obscured? I'm a veteran of FPS, Elder Scrolls, and Fallout; I've poured several hundred hours into FO76; I'm fairly educated regarding player builds and I'm serious about PVP but compared to you I know virtually nothing about the interplay of weapon, armor, and perk effects. Why? Why do I have to rely on the elite of the elite to share such important information voluntarily? To respec a character after Lvl 50 is a real grind and to do that only to find a hidden equation updated in a recent patch means it isn't viable; that's heartbreaking.   
---
You've also made good points regarding duping here in the sub, but I would just highlight that it's even more enraging to see how broadly it has impacted the perceived meta, and how that perception dominates the player economy. Then it echoes out and the current prevailing meta seems to consist of sentinel counters. I'm still kind of fuming that all of this was dictated by the whims of whatever dupers liked months ago; and we just sort of have to live with it. I liked your ideas on stealth builds and I'm likely to try it, but so far my PVP build thus far is best summed up: if you can't beat em, join em.
---
Oh no, it‚Äôs not just you, it‚Äôs everyone. Emoting/posing while having a camera out has done just this ever since it‚Äôs release.
---
260 is "Wreck someone's base completely" high. No accident there.
---
Yep. Joined to lurk and learn üòá
---
Mine is DJ_Stardust we should play sometime
---
Hard crashed my xbox this morning. Feels bad man.
---
The plans are a random award for the free range event.
---
Somebody could also make you one.
---
I have both, what do you have to to trade?
---
This isn't an exploit or a hack. This is understanding the mechanics of the game. Same as server hopping. Though this is more efficient in this scenario.  
---
  
---
Btw, I don't like this sub since there is no strategy talk at all, just a bunch of suggestions to Bethesda. People would like to learn this game and if they feel left out they quit and play something else. Holding back info hurts the game. Holding info on how to dupe would be a thing to keep quiet on however..
---
Sure why not
---
Killing is something ,a photo another thing.
---
If you mean the photo challenge, then i demand a proof.
---
I don't VATS them, I just walk up with my shotgun with enforcer perks and cripple the legs. Then you can melee them the rest of the way.
---
Amen
---
I can trade 2500 caps for both. Or do you have an item in mind?
---
I hide behind the pylons when she gives me the eye lasers.
---
I'll break this sh\*t down simple for the griefers and fascists disguising themselves as legit PvP'ers. The PvE'ers don't want nothing to do with you and nothing to do with competing with you. It's that simple. That's when a legit competitor leaves them the f\*ck alone.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
But sh\*t get's real when a b\*tch wants a population they view as "weaker" to be at their behest. Don't impose PvP on people who don't want it. 
---
Griefing like that is toxic AF. Anyone worth their salt when it comes to competing knows that you battle with equal or greater competition looking to battle with you. Guys with rifles going after civilians and spectators are mercs and terrorists that don't know what to do when the real soldiers show up.
---
Yes crappy name included
---
nope, just random location (from the list)
---
Any Explosive weapons? Or BoS chest/LL with weight reduc/vanguard
---
Otherwise just caps
---
Question how do you trigger this event ?
---
i don't know why but if you take a picture of the mainframe it won't give you the challenge. you actually gotta take a picture of the modus not the mainframe.
---
I have a Bloodied LVL50 deathclaw gauntlet for sell if you want it
---
Hold on, let me log in and check.
---
I use mollies or Tesla, found a 2* bloodied and I'm v happy
---
Got it
---
Does the game still crash if you get hit by a melee attack while firing it? That's the only reason I stopped using mine, but I would hope it's been patched by now.
---
What were they trying to pick up?  
---
I am not remotely interested in 2SE.  
---
I'm a Quad/Furious/Anti-Armor guy.
---
Bought a new PC a month ago. Spent about $2800au. 
---
i7-8700 and Geforce RTX 2060 are the big 2.
---
My ps cant find you
---
Or a easy option would be a option in the Trade menu that hides your inventory except for listed offers.
---
And crystal !!! Don‚Äôt forget those babies üëçüèº
---
I \**KNOW*\*, and I \**LOVE*\* it! It's an actual challenge even if you're like me and have a "kill everything" option on hand, because even a few hits can kill one, so if you're not fast enough, they can and will die. And unlike Encryptid, it is nobody's fault but ours. No crummy invincibility cheat that requires people to be built to take damage on the pylons, no grossly excessive HP pool, just you, your guns, and some really friggen fragile cows.
---
This is accurate.
---
I switch to whatever heavy weapon I am carrying and just give it a couple of rounds until everyone else has had a go.
---
i did it once, all three survived,  no mods, but did the the crook
---
Wait, how many versions are there? I've only seen the Divide one...
---
Well shit sir thank you for your serious patients
---
Hm? I sent you a request
---
What‚Äôs your IG? Mine is the same as my reddit name
---
TSE: "*WHY WOULD YOU WALK IN FRONT OF ME?!?*"
---
I had something like that happen to me once. I bought the sale item then returned it with the receipt from the full price one.
---
Yes indeed
---
Platform?
---
I bought today one for 25 caps you dont need to offer much! Are you on PC? If yes maybe I can get one for you.
---
How many caps for X01 in general?
---
I've done the sheepsquatch event over 25 times and all I have to show for it is 23 fedoras and the other 2 times I got nothing. I want the jetpacks plans and the imposter outfit but nope. I spent thousands of caps on the recall cards and still nothing. Any advice plz? Oh I'm on xboxone
---
I cant get rid of gears i got 1500
---
Sorry, none of those, but I do have a three star Berserker's Dragon if you're interested. If not is 2500 caps alright?
---
What's stars?
---
wow..i dont use many stimpaks
---
..but thats because im a stealth build and use silenced weapon and melee...rarely get spotted
---
If the Quest is in the category miscellaneous then you will get no reward.
---
The ten golfers at Whitesprings?
---
Ya I find very few ppl I cant kill in survival but when I do the kill atleast 5 time before I give up and start counting my missin caps lol
---
Oh
---
Yep
---
Blackbird
---
yep
---
Ore you will get only some normal useless grenades!
---
I was well over lvl 100 when I could finally get that off my list. Just be happy you got it done, seriously. I'm sure that's not the answer you wanted, but I can tell you countless people had that quest and or still do.
---
Legendary. It has Berserker, 25% less ap cost in V.A.T.S, and 40% more bash damage.
---
Why would you have junk on you while building? Building can take the junk straight from your stash.
---
I'll do that
---
I want wall-mounted cannons like the ones Ironsides used on the scavvers at the USS Constitution.
---
While that's a good idea, Unyielding is just too good to pass up with Bloodied.
---
I want Broadsider turrets commanded by a sentry bot in an antique naval hat.
---
Ok, my gamertag is GrowlingTiger44.
---
Didnt get one
---
Bulk them, you'll be rich!
---
Thank GOD ALMIGHTY your toxic ass isn't playing anymore.
---
Did you still need some help?
---
Starting
---
1 star bloodied weapons don't send bodies 100 yards, that's the discussion here not DMG
---
You ok?
---
Hey thanks for your help with this, I figured it out. I just have to boot up the game with wifi turned off for whatever reason
---
Lol, yea
---
Gives a plan for mystery meat pie, and if you know something about Wendigo lore, and have played fallout 3. Wendigos are people who have consumed human flesh, mystery meat is Human flesh in fallout 3.
---
Launching!
---
And pass the ammunition! ;)
---
Ok.  I'm your new best friend.  Gears is the only thing I run out of because I love workshops.  I'll gladly pay caps on PS4
---
Leave the game entirely. Drop back to your system dashboard and close the game. Restart fresh, you might even get lucky and get a little bit of a rollback and still have the caps you lost from getting killed.
---
But we are talking about low leveled characters who can‚Äôt take reasonably take down max lvl scorched
---
I was renovating my camp and scrapping a ton of stuff. That's why. It happens.
---
If you paint something with an atom shop paint it won‚Äôt show in the other peoples window
---
We have a go!!
---
I play/have played with a few people from the UK, one from Australia, and a few from Canada.  I'm on west coast USA.
---
How do you half shoot something?
---
This include shifting perk points between builds or is that  too exploitable? It would be handy for those of us who don't wanna go through the motions of making a second character.
---
It also has a mid-range attack, but it's rare to see because there is always someone in melee range. I've only seen it in the wild, when it got stuck trying to path through too small an area.
---
Un-fucking-playable Bethesda
---
Im in pc yes, igt ezequielfw
---
Pc, igt ezequielfw
---
Depends entirely on what weapon you're using. For melee or a VATS based build? Absolutely. For Heavy weapons (which do a lot more damage not counting sneak attacks, and much higher DPS in general) you're far better off using power armor.. in fact it's really a requirement, and with that kind of build you aren't using VATS anyway. High SPECIAL stats don't do anything unless they're giving you  high agi for better stealth ability, higher perception for more accuracy, etc.
---
How much for the TSE Handmade and what level is it?
---
Defiantly the stock, I learned about that and changed all my rifles and now last much longer.
---
Born Survivor does trigger. I farm my mutations in the storeroom at the nukashine speakeasy. Easy rads and no enemies to worry about while you're near death.
---
GT: McChicken888888 message me on Xbox and I'll send you a invite
---
No, that's what I want. Not what I have. I have the lever action
---
Nah man
---
That's what I thought ty
---
No. All are legacy weapons at this point. They no longer spawn or drop.
---
Yeah Its why i stocked up on one of each its only ginns get harder to get
---
People datamined the crap outta the sheepsquatch stuff.
---
And you literally can't escape people posting spoilers in titles or just talking about it
---
Any 2 or 3 star bos armor?  Not interested in assassin. 
---
Also 2 or 3 star rifles. With explosive?
---
Once you join the brotherhood you can return it to Fort Venture for some caps and rewards, can't remember what the rewards are though.
---
I‚Äôve had it happen 5 times
---
for a bloodied Combat shotgun
---
AAE LMG x3
---
and a f‚Äî-king map
---
On Xbox?
---
Sent a message.
---
I have  a folder of these almost 100+ XD though I have over 1000 pictures at this point
---
I just bought a tse flamer lol do explosive gauss still spawn tho?
---
No to that to
---
Soloed it with all cows alive and mooing, then some random shows up shoots the Sheepsquatch once and jumps on the building &amp; watched, so I ended up doing all the work.
---
Yea agreed this is annoying I run with a pair of plain spiked knuckles I use for events and always make sure others can get hits. The people who come in one shot everything have the small p p.
---
Yee
---
I disagree with this! Your perks should be a bother to change out, your are changing the compesition of your char.. it's should be annoying and having to do it manually card by card is a deterent.
---
I tried with a random one not from the event and it cannot even be pacified with any perk.
---
Just like the fog crawler.
---
atom shop skin for maps pls u/valseek u/Bethesdasoftworks_
---
Not since the Nerf because all the dups
---
Cool I've got 2 of those too lol ty man
---
Do you play on a team most of the time during SBQ fights and if so, do they reliably revive you when you die? Only asking because if not, you might want to consider using Radicool in your Endurance slot. It‚Äôs only one point and would leave you another point to use.
---
Three. Forest, Divide, and Mire.
---
First step is to surround the robots. They'll have a much more difficult time defending themselves when you surround them.
---
I think they're off because I've confused adrenal reaction with my bloodied chart. I do have a bloodied handmade so maybe I can respec a little?
---
Have to agree. Pausing to completely reset your cards ( not completely but you know what I mean ) for different tasks is annoying.
---
Your right it‚Äôs redundant I just didn‚Äôt really go that deep into thought about that specific part. It doesn‚Äôt really change the point of what I said at all. Js
---
Yes it shows correct damage, it‚Äôs not TS anymore, they nerfed it after ppl where one shooting everyone do decrease damage. Don‚Äôt know exact numbers but let‚Äôs say normal Handmade does 100dmg, TS Handmade does 125dmg and it shows in the weapon stat card in PIP-BOY.
---
Next update apparently.
---
I don't think the Lead Champagne recipe can actually be purchased, it's one of the recipes that you need to learn from Biv through the quest. You can buy the two Lead Champagne cocktail recipes but not for the Lead Champagne itself. I went through this myself a couple weeks ago.
---
Ooo.  Me likey.
---
Code doesn't work on that door for me. That door is a 6 digit code, as well
---
Hahah nice one. Man, I was so high last night. And exactly the reason I don't smoke weed anymore.
---
EA
---
Nice job. She went down quick
---
/r/TempleOfTodd/
---
I have a ton of combat armor I can BOS out on my main.  Only a harpoon gun right now
---
Yeah she did, I‚Äôll be doing it again later tonight, I‚Äôll message I later if u want in
---
Amen my brother/sister
---
The cake is a lie
---
Don't know how often you go there, but I go every few days and rarely get blooms.
---
Uninstall the game and go outside
---
They only bloom in the creek near Dyer, that's why it would nice to have another source.
---
My 2 shot combat rifle only does 90 damage. Doesnt seem uber powerful
---
Deathclaw cave is a foolproof way of finding deathclaws that or deathclaw island.
---
yeah, would be great to be able to grow them...
---
Yes, that's true.
---
I have a team of 2 in for an SBQ tonight too if you're launching again! GT SaintedSparrow
---
There's a cave to the northish of the Sons of Dane camp that always spawns a deathclaw.
---
Kill it with fire
---
Those don‚Äôt count as a random spawn I don‚Äôt think!
---
Alright, sounds good to me
---
It would also be great if they made some perks passive. Lockpicking and Hacker should obviously be passive.
---
Then before you "lmao", you should read what you are responding to more carefully.
---
I have a theory I hoping someone can verify. Does the game assign mutations as diseases? My basis for that hypothesis is that I was trying to farm mutations and used antibiotics then couldn't get anything. It might have been the 30 minute timer. I wasn't keeping track of time. Does anyone have more info on that?
---
AH, has to be random spawn? The one hidden in the cave isn't random spawning but there is one that randomly spawns at the mouth of the cave iirc.
---
You can either do these things or not. It's a contrived limitation not found in other fallout games. I prefer the original SPECIAL system.
---
I read this all-caps nightmare in the voice of Lemmy from Motorhead to the tune of Ace of Spades. But these are good tips, so I can't really complain.
---
Eh i have a +power bat that does ~700 at 20% the first hit takes off about 1/5 it's health. It's not hard to kill alone, but that's not the point of the quest. It's to keep those couws alive. The real treasure comes in rewards if you keep them all alive.
---
This is the place to go for Treasure maps:  [http://dulfy.net/2018/12/02/fallout-76-treasure-maps-guide/](http://dulfy.net/2018/12/02/fallout-76-treasure-maps-guide/)
---
well I run survival mode a lot. that with event hopping and my daily legendary runs keep the xp coming fairly steadily. west tek, robco in the nw of the bog, a lot of the bots on parade in the se of the mire when it's up. ummm any of those defence events do pretty well too killing waves especially if you use the cranberry food for xp bonus or some of beef stew from the feed the people event. pretty drunk so sorry if none of that was understandable o.O
---
I just lost 15 Bulk Lead. I was trading with another player and they bought 30 out of 45. Then the remaining 15 was jist gone. It wasn't in either of our inventories or in my stash or on a paper bag lying around. It sucks because that's one of my biggest sellers.
---
Passive/active is the way forward.
---
What platform are you on? I've been looking for a powerful radium rifle!
---
The handmade ‚Äúfeels‚Äù better to me.
---
Pick a peach and practice!
---
I really love this. If we had to do it the way you were thinking, there will be no nukes for months. First to get all codes, then is some kind of enigma shit to get the real code. Look at YT on deciphering it, looks very difficult. It is not just the numbers you see on the card. On the other hand, nukes would be rare and not done every day, game will be much more fun.
---
Ahh I didn‚Äôt think of that
---
Spot light turrets should help a little with that but I can't get it to work 100% of the time with them either.
---
Yeah I run 2 accounts, so I can always just revive myself heh. Also why I'm not running Lone Wanderer - I have empath.
---
Lmao
---
Yes sir, yes sir
---
Three bags full
---
*YOU ARE OVER-ENCUMBERED*
---
Yeah but I was crafting at my camp today and a SB showed up. I had to make some quick swaps. Otherwise I‚Äôd just have to leave the server. 
---
And there are places where I‚Äôd have to think about my perk cards far in advance of when I needed lockpick or hacking.
---
One of the junk yard workshops has a titanium deposit you can resource farm.
---
They really are I've been greeting a lot of griefers lately and they'll group up in teams of 3 or 4 and destroy my camp it's really annoying but I'm glad they're gonna change that in adventure in two weeks
---
Fair enough
---
Level? Your build?
---
What amazes me is that this is the first I‚Äôve heard about mods for FO76? Where the fuck have I been hiding? I‚Äôm a mere 200 hours haha.
---
I wish. Early rise tomorrow, I‚Äôm about to call it for the nite.  Thx anywho
---
Those upgraded turrets fire explosive bullets with a ton of knockback. And there is no spread on a turret.
---
If you‚Äôre PC, I‚Äôve got one. 400 caps?
---
There‚Äôs a brotherhood graveyard south  down the road outside of... Huntersville I think? Not exactly a fort or military area though ;)
---
Not before they turn in a box of grid squares in exchange for some BA-11 00n ST-Rings.
---
Um. I already had the Assaultron head plan learnt, and got another plan by the same name from the ISS event... learnt it and it said it unlocked the imposter head... is that the mod to the standard plan, because I couldn't find a separate item to craft.
---
Bro i did the same thing you didnt happen to see a guy named stryker or styrker did you
---
Try taking a picture far back enough to get the entire front of the house...from the far lane of the road.
---
I got a good chuckle in imagining this.
---
when i play FO76 i enjoy following low lvls and saving them  lol let em get downed by a 68 then revive em with booze   stand back and repeat
---
I like the writer‚Äôs style; it‚Äôs much easier to read than Paul Tassi‚Äôs work. Tassi‚Äôs writing comes across like a hastily penned Reddit post from a mobile phone. There‚Äôs nothing wrong with that per se but I would expect something a little more clean from Forbes.
---
Can confirm, just held the pylon by the cabin and cleaned up all the trash mobs yet 4 other people couldnt make a commitment to the two other pylons. Like ???...
---
Ran out of stims since I only had a dozen at the time so just said fuck it and farmed the trash mobs. Got at least 4 legendaries, 1 being decent for an alt I have while the turds wasted whatever time and resources on shooting an invisible immortal sex bot.
---
Even after I had to give up on holding a pylon at least I was still partaking by clearing adds so I dont feel bad.
---
Added Camera/Tourist locations and some of the random encounter points.
---
If you have broken for the new items try clearing cache
---
This is easily my #1 most wanted feature.
---
PS4?  PA with blue X01 with flames on it?  I've been on the other end of this exact scenario.
---
Gunsmith 5 and Luck of Draw 2. I basically repair once a play session, maybe every 4-5 hours if that.
---
If you‚Äôre committing to Heavy, then I might recommend also investing into Power Armor. The Stability card makes a massive difference in Heavy handling, and the extra carry weight is always a plus.
---
SPECIAL-wise, I‚Äôd recommend 15 Strength, 15 Intelligence, and do some homework on the cards you‚Äôll want to determine the spread for the rest.
---
Should have also gotten a plan for a wall collage item for your camp, as well as unlocked a border for the old Photo mode I believe
---
Xb
---
Agreed, interesting article.  Thanks for sharing.
---
Which quest? I got to the site but there was no indication of how to make one of those cards.
---
Oh well it isn't mine. I was doing a trade with this guy and he wanted a price check
---
Should have taken what junk he had left behind.
---
This would be great!
---
Additionally, I'd like an optional slot that you automatically switch to when entering your camp.
---
Protip: Atom shop painted items don't show in trade.  
---
p.s. we need handmade paint job @ bethesda
---
This is a oxymoron.
---
Hey. I‚Äôm interested in the mascot outfit. How much?
---
What evidence do you have of that?
---
Sentinel is the second tier perk not the prefix perk slot
---
Omg üòÇ
---
Sadly he didn't drop any
---
I do want to see
---
Don‚Äôt think sentinel or cavalier are primary perks whereas mutant is
---
There isn‚Äôt an energy weapon specific build, other than grabbing Batteries Included. Energy weapons are kind of trash right now though. Also avoid the Grounded mutation like the plague.
---
real question, has anyone tried taming the sheepsquatch/deathclaw hybrid fucker yet? 
---
I‚Äôm curious but I doubt it‚Äôs possible, so far I‚Äôve only seen them spawn as legendary as well
---
Do you know if there's another way by chance?
---
Oh wow... I wouldn't pay 20,000 for anythingüòÇ the most I ever paid was 2k for a tse gatling gun!!
---
No idea
---
Go to motel just up the road from Harper's Ferry. Look closely at one of the tables outside near the robot.

Pity about the cloaked corpse.
---
But so far got both outfits, the fixer plans, the assaultron helmet plans (mod?) and my first ever TSE - a combat rifle.
---
I stop doing whatever it is I'm doing and head straight there when it pops. I almost always take a pylon and run around TSEing everything for the scrap/loot.
---
You‚Äôre never going to see anything listed as sentinel. It‚Äôs a 3rd tier item, they never get labeled. Only first tier items get labels (except some weird bugs with certain ones like 2nd tier poisoners sometimes replacing other effects for naming priority),.

I‚Äôll be there in a min

---
Also this
---
No worries thanx man!
---
Oh good to know, I appreciate the effort and info!
---
I guess when I get around to attempting tame something I'll just try for a Deathclaw or Mirelurk King.
---
Fisto!? Where? Oh, you mean the impostor sheepsquach. üòÆ
---
Is 500 ok?
---
Walk up to big rif.
---
Cross fingers.
---
I'm hanging out at the top of the Landview Lighthouse, where the dead tourist is. I'll be here for half an hour or so to help other players.
---
You actually found something tameble? I haven't found anything in 60+ levels... :(
---
PC master race, sorry.
---
Just to clarify, I've had pets up until around level 90, I'm now 161 and not found anything I can tame since... nothing...not even a level 5 or 10 anything...
---
You can only tame creatures spawned in from random events; not creatures always spawning in at specific spots. I'm not sure why they did it like this but they need to rework their entire taming system before it's even remotely worth using due to bugs and player killing and difficulty in taming from only randoms.
---
Hey, just wondering if the deal is still on.
---
Almost May, same issue.
---
Cool. Meet me ingame? Too much to list.
---
Please... paint for this... I wouldn't have lost my TSE if there had been paint... don't care if its gaudy gold...
---
I just found one Lvl 80 legendary 1 star right at the base of East Ridge Lookout. 
---
Took photos and by the time I came back down the tower the corpse was gone.
---
More like id10t errors.
---
Cheap. System?
---
Yeah, sorry, dealing with stuff, join on me
---
Nah sorry, just want costume ideas. I have the deathclaw gauntlet thing already down and waiting for my character.
---
Did the name of the house show up in the upper corner?
---
Damn, should have finished this thread before I chimed in.
---
It was a nice set up. I guess the impostor really did bring the real creatures out of hiding.
---
No worries.
---
Found him as well and can confirm his attacks/ animations. 
---
Literally at the base of the East Ridge Lookout with 4 Albino rad stags.
---
I‚Äôm the same, I love my camps. Building them is my favorite part of the game. I have one 70 on pc and one 100+ on PS4 and 2 30s on PS4 I love the game.
---
At one point I couldn't even take photos and it said there were 3 foxes in front of me. The camera is really buggy in general. It's funny because they delayed it and everything, yet it still doesn't even work properly half the time.
---
Totally. Whatever you were offering.
---
Protect and slurp
---
The guy in my story was more on the hostile side since he didn't give me a chance to back off the bot.  Glad it wasn't you, not that it would really matter if it was.
---
I've learned my lesson since then and I'm switching to Tormentor from Enforcer for bots.  Most bots die (slowly) from 3-5 hits from Enforcer, and I'll have better range using Tormentor.  I guess the rule will be "if it's on fire, you probably should tag it."
---
Way back when fo4 was announced, yes.
---
Oh. And I‚Äôd like 2 please.
---
I'm queued to join your world.
---
I just had a run of the event where almost the entire server showed up for the final fight... and we still lost every single fucking brahmin.  Two yao guai, three stingwings and a bunch of bloatflys all spawn at once and all of two of us bothered to turn around and do shit about it.
---
The other thing people need to do?  PICK UP A FUCKING CROOK.  I've shown up to events in progress and watched idiots with nothing but their rifles out slow walking the damn things the entire way.  You don't have to waste inventory space, grab a new crook every time the event pops up and scrap it the instant it ends.
---
You just ask a question to be shitty to people?
---
Absolutely everyone has this bug.
---
Slightly barely rare. They eat fusion cores in seconds too.
---
Good find, but you can buy the plan from a lot of vendors and I haven't seen much of a point to them since getting the marsupial mutation.
---
Where do you rename it from?
---
There's no rush, it's not a limited time event. So just keep trying and maybe you'll get lucky like me and get a TSE drop.
---
I play on Xbox. My home computers are all iMacs.
---
Go on a scrap run it‚Äôs not that hard, all it takes is 5 cloth, 3 ballistic fiber, and a ton of lies.
---
Omg I forgot that. Then as soon as I left 3 grannies with rolling pins attacked me. Fuck was that a good game!
---
My inventory
---
I have all codes for Alpha site.
---
It‚Äôs a beer !
---
If you on Xbox I got you later
---
What kind of answer are you expecting?
---
Stuff is messed up, simple as that
---
That would mean Intelligence perks would only be swapping for power armor specs?  I‚Äôd be fine with that.
---
Oh that‚Äôs strange it‚Äôs always worked for me, are you on console?
---
Yes
---
Before you engage, check your surroundings.
---
Sometimes I forget to push the confirm for the name change so maybe that might be it?
---
It does rename it. But about 5 minutes later it removes the name and puts the default one
---
hahaha, awesome answer... don't panic, you don't need to throw away everything, just keep it for another month, no problem, no need for more space ;)
---
They also need to fix the 4:2000 your account is unconnected
---
I use them on my T51 PA, and have them fitted to my X-01 set too.
---
I don't have high agility and find the Jetpack really useful for getting places... like the roof of a building if being swarmed by melee mobs - rifle build.
---
this account is as old as fo76 + some BETA
---
Pulled her out of her leash zone most likely, were you trying to fight her outside the nuke?
---
I was unable to when I saw it at the random spawn outside watoga.
---
Over time you end up using it less and less once you realize how little you actually need your main combat build, at least I do. I mainly in my carrying build with all my weight reduction perks and strength increasing perks. Unless I'm heading into Wes-Tek or a Nuke zone I never go into my full combat build. Being able to quick swap gives you the the ability to realize how little you need to quick swap.
---
Man, that's fucking cool.
---
Ultra cute has different colour beam, it shoots faster but has slightly less damage, the mods for both are exclusive and since you don‚Äôt find many ultracite lasers in the wild you‚Äôd have to craft/scrap them to learn mods. Both are pretty useless in later levels.
---
Now you know why I can't find my car keys half the time.
---
I'm over level 100 with all quests complete... all I do in 76 anymore is waste time.
---
lol no
---
Killed her twice today so no.
---
You got psn Jermz_xx90
---
Thanks
---
Ah, yes. Ok, that must be it. Thank you.
---
Thank you
---
Sometimes if you see an item that drops with Assassins as its first affix, the item might get named after its 2nd or 3rd affix. I looted an Assassins/Perception/Sentinel arm yesterday and its called Sentinel's Metal Left Arm.
---
I've been here for a little while, longer on an email I don't have access to anymore, but... yeah pretty much. I hadn't posted on reddit in yonks before 76.
---
I use imgur, but I'm not sure how well that works with PS.
---
Oh I‚Äôm not having this problem, I found a power armor frame today and it renamed.
---
The mannequins are a tribute to someone that died. Not sure what the rhyme or reason is  but that‚Äôs why they are there.
---
The minigun with Gojira. I was thinking about it, and it would have been good with this, too.

Yoteslaya is one I think of when I see them
---
I generally don't care about peoples camps since I generally just blow them up, but that is well done! Good job!
---
Same. Though if there was a balance concern, they could add energy weapon perks and drop energy weapons from rifle and pistol cards.
---
Reading assaultron plan learns the Sheepsquatch plan also, but won‚Äôt show up in the menu until bought in the atom shop
---
Are there in-game clue for the quantum paint, like there was with the original nuka paint? Or was it just found thru datamining? If there were clues, could you point me to the first clue? Thanks in advance.
---
I forgot to add, another possibility is that it takes 25% of the base damage of the gun and adds 1 projectile that does that damage. For shotguns, this would mean that 1 pellet would be stronger than the rest, but still add 25% base damage overall.
---
Look at my username, there's your answer.
---
I also now use Reddit for other topics I'm passionate about and memes asw.
---
People do on the 76market sub. Normally 1/1 price.
---
According to  [https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Fallout\_76\_legendary\_effects](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Fallout_76_legendary_effects) certain major and minor modifiers do give a name: powered, poisoner's, sentinel's, cavalier's, acrobat's and safecracker's.
---
I bet some mods will be only be available through atomic shop, hopefully it‚Äôs only cosmetic.
---
That makes no sense, why would they allow a random drop to be linked to a store item?? Surely the store item should give you everything you need?
---
Red Rocket Mega Stop - has 5 machines and some nukas can spawn in the restaurant/kitchen area
---
Dyer Chemical - 4 machines also a random spawn on a shelf in the main building
---
Whitesprings bunker - above the entrance and around the corner on a table. also inside is a machine and plenty of spawn points throughout
---
Whitesprings vendors - bubbles and all the new faction vendors inside sell plenty.
---
Never heard of that or had it happen to me
---
Sweet. Thanks for the info. I'll just hold off until then.

We can link this to intelligence for give intelligence a lil buff.

Yeah, going Devil‚Äôs Advocate on this one too.

Tagging etiquette works when everyone involved is on the same page and battle isn‚Äôt frantic. For every time I‚Äôve had neighborly encounters, I‚Äôve also had ones where the other party just looks at you in complete puzzlement at what you‚Äôre trying to do. I 100% wouldn‚Äôt rule out a case of someone just not aware of expectations since fo76 kind of plays ‚Äúsimultaneous single player‚Äù instead of full on multiplayer sometimes ;-)
---
Side note, I play non PA stealth melee, and it really is only effective if you get the kill in quickly. Overall, it‚Äôs pretty squishy if your target actually gets a chance to hit back.
---
Second side note, jeez, who melees bots without explosion protection? Cmon, wear your condom, er, dense mods...
---
Well, I‚Äôve seen poisoners and powered, but it‚Äôs only in certain situations- not exactly sure what causes it. I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve yet seen any of the others show as the name.
---
I‚Äôll keep my excitement in check

Joining your world

It took me a while to want to play again after a break because I couldn‚Äôt remember my perk loadouts and it was tedius remembering.

---
Same
---
Lol my friend is up there
---
&gt;ort, and the high level goes into a lavishly restored asylum full of friends and resources, and the low level goes in and finds only ghouls and death.
---
Yes, because I played Borderlands. It's not as grating to the experience as one might think.
---
totally. I can't place my radio on anything but the top shelf...  who would do that?
---
sadly pc :#
---
I mean... I‚Äôm lvl 221 with 4 alts over 50 and I still got stuff to do
---
Well done! I never liked the pressure plate for having a conduit sticking out upwards in such a bulky manner but this looks neat.
---
Never had to hop a server. Got it on Philippi Cemetary after checking Wavy first. Then on my main I found it first time I checked the Giant Teapot.
---
It's beautiful
---
Plstform?
---
Sorry but what do you need mics for? Like just shoot the damn thing lol
---
All they need to do is make the basketball function like the dross
---
For fun?
---
Oh ok fair enough
---
PS4 sorry I forgot to put that
---
Two shots were nerfed unreasonably and put in with the explosive over powered  adjustment. I don‚Äôt k ow the mechanics. 
---
To me the two shot should double your shot or more. I get why they nerfed it but it‚Äôs illogical. A second bullet coming right behind one that killed your armor should be devastating.
---
The only thing I want from microscopes is that sweet fiber optics. Seriously the rarest resource in the game.
---
 did you check all the locations before hopping? never had to hop for it myself. :s
---
Nice
---
Are you still on?
---
Yes I have bloody mole miner gauntlet with swing speed and +1str
---
Oh, hell, I JUST went offline. Maybe ask u/Ska001. He joined my server. If he's still there, maybe you can join him there and find the corpse at the top of the lighthouse.
---
Hey are you still in the server with the tourist?
---
Thanks! I‚Äôll ask him.
---
Hmmm I use instigating melee they all die in one hit I don't ever get to see this
---
Yet Another Seventy Six Map?  YASSM?
---
Sorry, I meant /u/ska00l, from this thread.
---
This title was hard read. For 4 more for lol
---
yea got to admit I gave up for a while pretty tired of whitesprings as I pretty much spent my first 60-70 days there. üòÇ
---
I've only managed to do a couple Free Range events, so I'm wondering if you can scrap the staff and learn mods like with other weapons, or do they just drop from the Squatch?
---
Yeah trust me, I know, I had to reread it twice
---
The problem is that, if we're honest, this game is NOT stable. I mean in terms of servers.   
---
So the limit on a server is 25 at a time, right? But why not more? Other big games let more people onto a server at any time. Maybe it's the player construction concept? But no, because you CAN'T actually build anything that lasts on the server beyond you logging out.   
---
I don't think that was their plan though. In the teases and all the presentations and interviews they said you could rebuild Appalachia. They said you could build communities. But you can't. Take a walk over to Whitesprings and really explore the hotel. Look at it with MMOs in mind. The place is a player HUB. Heck, that market area is basically setup to be Fallout 76's version of Stormwind. It feels massively empty. Like there should be players running around in there all the time.   
---
I think they planned a ton of stuff and even built the world around those expectations, but then utterly failed to pull off what they were planning. At least as far as server stability goes. What we have now are the safest, sad servers you could design, and they still crash. Nothing in them changes, only a few items can be interacted with, nothing a player does is permanent after they log out. and the amount of data that can be loaded onto them is strictly throttled (stash limit, player limit, CAMP limits). I bet the reason why we can't build next to friends' is because the CAMP system kept crashing when player ownership areas touched.
---
bEthesdA
---
We'll have to wait and see now won't we? :/
---
Haha. Like I know it's a perfectly fine sentence but my brain was just like NOPE! NOPE! NOPE!
---
Spruce Knob's workshop has some brotherhood barricades around it and a brotherhood flag on top. It's not distinctly marked as a brotherhood area, so I guess that counts.
---
I had a fucking great time when I found out I could hole up in what could technically be considered a brotherhood outpost. It was a while ago but when I did first find it, it made my day.
---
My current tactic with scorched, mutties and ghouls is the good old stealth head shot. if it doesn't put them down in one, it puts them pretty close to down.
---
For groups its using VATS on a grenade I just threw.
---
Same. Panoflex.
---
Yeah I could see how certain weapons would be broken if the second shot did full damage (gauss, grenade launchers, rocket launchers, etc). Seems like it‚Äôs still plenty strong and primarily sought after even after the nerf
---
The two-shot absolutely does. Explosive may or may not, I‚Äôve heard mixed anecdotal reports of that.
---
The ESM doesn't specify damage per pellet, just the pellet count and the total damage. Two-shot explicitly adds one pellet and multiplies the total damage by 1.25, so logically you'd now have 125% damage spread equally over nine pellets.
---
Almost impossible to test though.
---
Better to laugh at the absurdity than to cry at the insanity.
---
Yes I am
---
I like the nail turret idea
---
Not for long though
---
What‚Äôs your psn name? I‚Äôve been server hoping all night
---
Ska00L
---
Yea np, it's a real problem with people who think they are smart, she also tends to bug out on top of that but a lot of the time you get her really low like past her natural regen than she leashes and she either bugs again or there's not enough time to finish and everyone gives up.
---
Or it crashes the server, it's a real mess and a huge waste of mats+ammo
---
I'll have to add you later.  Marathon tomorrow!
---
True, though much of what they've done could probably be considered an effect of improved server stability.   
---
The servers as-is, are poorly designed and they've clearly had to implement a TON of restrictions to reduce crashes. Nothing on a server changes based on player actions, the majority of objects in the game world are static (like there are static cans among the collectible ones), small player counts on each server, player build limits and player stash limits.   
---
So as they improve the servers, those limits are probably being reduced. Like the bigger stash sizes. They might be able to pull off instancing but, beyond that I'm not holding my breath.
---
Meanwhile, in Conan Exiles, my friends and I can all build a giant, shared castle. And in ARK, some guilds built friggin cities on servers.
---
There's a priority table for item names. Bethesda just gave Mutant Slayer's a higher number than Sentinel for some reason.
---
Stand outside the Honey House until you're approached by a talking Honey Beast. It will offer you a map to a hidden treasure in exchange for its life. It's a lie. Kill it and you'll find the mod plans.
---
first thing I did on skyrim was get a mod for that.
---
Awesome. Thanks so much!
---
:-)
---
That might work.
---
My biggest gripe with the pressure plate is that it has to go on a foundation, if you could just float it and have the wire straight down it would be much cleaner.
---
‚ùå* STILL HERE *‚ùå
---
That robot has been jacking on! Its high as a kite.
---
I don't, but I ended up server hopping Wavy Willard's a bunch of times and finally got it.
---
76 does have an XP penalty for lower players. It's just not much of one. My normal group is three mid level (77,70,and 65) and one low level. We all tag the sentry at 98 NAR, we all get over 600xp, the low level gets around 350. But it really wouldn't be too hard to have a team share xp with a scale for level. Once you get PA, a low level player can survive pretty well in a fight, even with high level enemies, especially if someone is in a support role. I understand the need for an xp penalty. I think that's only right. But let us share the damn loot, and let us share the damn xp.
---
But now, our poor little 19 has to get a shot in on a 65 legendary sentry, which causes one of two situations: either one of us has to tank the damage until they break cover and hit it, since we can kill it really quick, or it aggroes on them and they die real fast to it. And then they get a good bit of xp but nothing too much, and normally way higher level loot than they can use.
---
I can't stop laughing.  I'm so sorry.  Sounds like a Wasteland Monday.
---
I've got a 100 caps, an empty nuka cola bottle and a pipe pistol I could trade for it.
---
Yup.
---
Been asking that question since Fallout 3.
---
They are dumb. Any cooperation is impossible with them. When there is a daily challenge to trade with somebody, nobody on the server wants to do it.
---
Your user name does not check out with this post. It was, in fact, very creative. Thanks for the good read and good advice.
---
You can take the prime receiver off if you want
---
That actually helps a lot, thank you
---
You got it man, we should be on a bit tomorrow!

So while I didn't choose that area it did allow me to spot out a prize area that practically fit the ideal

The pet should respawn as a level ?? Boss and instantly kill the player that killed him, then proceed to chase them across the map until they leave the server.
---
Oh no, I like the little explosions the bullets make. üòÅ
---
At least 10k pre dupergate. With the current rate of inflation, you can probably trade for top tier weapons/armor, or 20k+
---
I paid 10k+ 2 weeks ago for a Chameleon powered sentinal heavy right arm.
---
Is this City Skylines
---
I swear people have said that they've tamed Megasloths.
---
Where you able to find the Marsupial Serum yet? I would be able to sell you one. My PSN id is the same as here.
---
My advice for you is make that decision yourself. It's up to YOU if you like/dislike the game because you're the one experiencing it. Everyone has different experiences because the game can be played pretty much however you want to play it.
---
Your suggestion has worked.
---
Oh thank you!
---
Lmaooo
---
Nope. The game is total garbage. Sell it or trade it, just don't bother trying to effort fun out of it.
---
Thanks for the heads-up (GT Slackwarebeanot)! Found on Anne at Mothman statue - I'll hang out here for a while in case anyone else is still hunting for it (pay it forward :) )
---
Sarcasm..... I like it
---
Yeah like playing caravan from nv
---
That‚Äôs sick
---
I didn‚Äôt find you for some reason. My PSN is MiissThaang
---
Are you serious?
---
Ik but i'd hearing player's experience so i can get an idea, never played the game before only watched some youtube videos
---
I practice a separate religion under RNGesus but I'll send my preferred prayer I stole from a Destiny sub-reddit and changed in your direction.
---
&gt;Oh RNGesus, who art in the cloud.

&gt;Hallowed by thy dice.

&gt;Thy cryptic come,

&gt;Give us this day our daily atoms

&gt;And forgive us our nuking  
---
&gt;as we forgive those who one shot legendaries  
---
&gt;And lead us not into server hopping,  
---
&gt;but deliver us from glitches.  
---
&gt;For thine is the three star,  
---
&gt;and the power,  
---
&gt;and the glory,  
---
&gt;forever and ever... or until the patch comes out,  
---
&gt;amen.
---
I would hope he isn‚Äôt, since he‚Äôs reading and commenting on a post on FO76. That would be kind of sad lol
---
I imagine they'd just increase your carry weight.
---
I was pretty happy when I found my random spawn, too. Not as exciting as your story, I was just checking the spawn point outside of Watoga for S&amp;G, when I saw dead brahmin and then it popped out I about crapped myself lol
---
There's no indication that pets are included in the CAMP immunity. Someone's gonna have to take one for the team and test it when the patch drops unless Bethesda lets us know at some point.
---
Pretty much why I one shot everything I can is because I got tired of being screwed out of a drop because someone else beat me to it.
---
And here I've been eating cans of dog food all along. Way to into it.
---
I‚Äôll be on in an hour and a half if you still need someone
---
I got it about 2 weeks ago and have played it every chance I have gotten. It really comes down to what you like, I love the feeling of wandering the landscape alone, the world feels empty and lonely but in a good way, you find things that tell their own story, like the skeleton of a researcher at the bottom of a set of stairs with an empty beer bottle and a box of rat poison.
---
Sometimes (and this is just me) but I will wander for 5 or 10 minutes encountering nothing, and unlike other games it doesn't get boring, it gets stressful, waiting for something to jump out and try and rip your teeth out via your asshole.
---
I personally haven't encountered many glitches and the few I have haven't been game breaking. I have yet to try PVP but have found the community to be really helpful, with a number of high level characters dropping random gear, plans or materials for me.
---
I made a second character that's under level 5 (pvp is disabled for those under level 6) that I transferred quite a collection of three and two stars over to. I haven't quite finished my shop yet, but it will be open soon once I have enough. I figure, if my food weapons are out of sight, they'll be out of mind.
---
I didn‚Äôt figure out tbh. I think the end is to start the encrypted event via the terminal in the cabin
---
I hope they are serious.
---
All the more entertaining that their life is so pathetic, they feel to need to join communities they actively dislike in order to get the attention they lack at home.
---
No sympathy for them though, clearly they deserve to be mocked, if this is how they act.
---
That will be great!
---
Yep. Sadly didn't work (I thought the lore there or surrounding it confirmed it was indeed an alien on the operation table? Perhaps I remember wrong).
---
People still do this event?
---
Numbers for Concentrated fire:
---
\+10/15/20% for non-automatic hit chance
---
\+2/3/4% for automatic hit chance
---
\+1/2/3% for damage
---
I don't know what it actually does with those numbers.
---
Stealth bonuses rarely do anything in an SBQ fight, IME, probably because you're rarely the closest opponent.
---
I was lucky only had to server hop once to find my tourist
---
Now get the paddle ball from the company store and harass everyone u meet for fuzzy tokens. (also makes for perfect finishing move)
---
Can I get another one please
---
I bought it when it went on sale a few weeks after it released. I played it pretty solid until I reached about level 20. I haven't played it in a while, but I did enjoy it. It's A Bethesda game, so it certainly has its bugs, but nothing that ruined the experience for me.
---
I haven't seen one in the Forest, where is it hiding?
---
Yeah how much you want for em
---
I too have been playing every day since launch. I farm all over the map. I have never cheated, never bought anything off of Reddit/eBay. I have EARNED everything I have legitimately. And just TODAY, I got my FIRST Sentinel metal leg lvl 50. I have gotten every good type of weapon. Two shot, explosive, bloodied, anti armor etc. But never have I gotten Sentinel Assassins, let alone multiple pieces. I just don‚Äôt understand how some players have FULL SETS. I guess I know how now.
---
If you know the down sides but still think the game looks okay, then you'll have fun. That's how I went into it, and I've been enjoying it
---
you gave me a idea so i updated the post! so thank you!
---
You have to know the receiver plan to make the ammo.
---
No but I have a dcg with ss and +1 strength
---

Can confirm no üòÇ my bf and I just tried it, side by side. His is 10.24.2102 and I am 10.25.2102 and he is also 3 mins behind in time. Same server ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

Did you buy it off another player?
---
If you learn a prime receiver plan for a 5mm weapon then it'll also unlock 5mm ultracite ammo (tinker's bench, under ultracite ammo). I think the only 5mm weapons are the Gatling and the Minigun.

Just took 3 pictures of different distances and still not updating.

As a game, I personally find it quite a lacklustre experience. The story is bullshit. The end game is not there. But it's also the only online game I've played where I've met sooo many incredibly generous people. Yeah sure there are assholes that play the game. And sure I've met a few. But I've also met more friendly and helpful people playing this game than any other game.
---
I originally bought the game to play with my best friend but he never gave the game a chance. And that's okay. It's okay because on a good day, like today, I'm playing with a dozen people exploring the wastes together bashing around in power armor, making the world quake beneath our feet.
---
I doubt it's a recycle beyond the core code and probably a few of the better selling designs from CC. While base FO76 has a lot of recycle (largely by necessity), the new content has been mostly original. Even the Burrows has some new assets (much of which I expect will eventually hit Atom Shop or be reused in future content, no point in not getting their worth out of it).
---
Too lazy and jaded.
---
What robot? I've only every arrived after the event has started.
---
Cool, then the answer is yes and no.

Congrats on building what will essentially be your new mobile home as you slowly encumber yourself with things you never thought to check the weight on, like missiles and stimpacks.

Man, that really seals the deal for me with this game.

I'm thinking you mean something like they have in Payday 2 right? Where you can save multiple decks with a name? That would be excellent! Good idea.

I found it only a few weeks ago, played since day 1 lol

Same lol
---
Proof? Not saying it isn't true.

he's just collecting data
---
Dammit. Says you're in main menu
---
Speaking from experience here, if it took a while for you to get back, they may have assumed it was deliberately dropped for weight purposes, especially if you came back after you died. Not saying that's what happened her, and not saying people arn't assholes for looting baggies, but not every looter is a scumbag.
---
Thats weird, im still in game at tourists body
---
It‚Äôs all over the trees in Welch.

You should have tamed the one I saw earlier. I blew its head clean off and it kept running around for a couple of minutes before I left it.

still on that same server? :D
---
At the start of the event the cows spawn on top of s downed mr gutsy that has the Shepard‚Äôs crook and a not with the instructions.
---
Well done indeed but may I add that when I click on an icon the text is so small I can't read it
---
i let them walk slowly so i clean up everything meanwhile (the BBQ shack spawn at least)
---
Today during the Cow event, I tossed a Orbital Strike Beacon at the boss. It bounced off the roof at an angle and managed to land all of 5ft away. Plus side, I was near the cows, so it killed ads. Down side, I had to haul ass.
---
I have noticed that just being in the mid-to-lower mire or upper cranberry bog is enough to notify me when it pops up.
---
Yep :) gt Slackwarebeanot
---
Same here as well on XB. One guy had a go at me last night in the burrows until I turned mic on and told them to quit their shit. Can only put it down to boredom but it‚Äôs also school holidays at the moment in NZ - not sure about other countries....?
---
Trying team invite then party if that doesn't work.
---
I had something similar happened except this guy just watched the cows get destroyed by blood bugs while he stood beside them spamming the thumbs down emote lol.
---
I tried to do a desk job as role play experiment for about a week (can't do any damage there, right?) but people kept stealing my typewriter.

Depends on what you like in Fallout. After hearing arguments for and against the game, I've noticed it comes down to what type of player you are. 
---
You like being out in the wastes, scavenging, scrounging and surviving in areas you probably shouldn't even be in? It's a really great game for that. It is a survival-lite game after all. Food and water matters, ammo is scarce, repairs have to be made
---
You like cowering in the cities and towns, surrounding yourself with human NPCs that have limited dialogue options and no backstory like Diamond or Rivet City and only leaving those sanctuaries when you have to do a quest? Well there's only one place like that on the map, and it's smack dab in the middle of the wasteland. It is pretty though
---
A feature from 4
---
Just killed sheepsquatch and an effing drill. Bethesda fix your shit, seriously
---
I love to build things and settlement in F4, i love to build camps in 76 but man! do i suck at decorating them but you are excellent, i envy in a good way how you and others manage to fill a lot of stuff in tight spaces that looks real, pleasant and logic.
---
Wish i could let a message to camps if you ever stop by ;) well done
---
Groves family cabin, NW corner. It can trigger there
---
Sounds good! Still here
---
I had the opposite today, cool melee guy who stood back and let me murderer all the little things around the legendary (with explosives!) to make sure Leg was tagged, then ran up and gave it a hit. They literally stood still, watching me and waiting for me to cease fire so he knew when to go at it. To be fair, I did hop on the mic to tell him where the first one appeared (he was on the other side of a truck and didn't notice).
---
This is so well done. I think the smaller, more compact spaces are the way to go with the build limit. I‚Äôve found that simply lighting my place properly takes up so much build space.
---
woot! thanks dude! (got it &lt;3 )
---
It is not a feature of 4. I find myself constantly trying to do 76 shit in 4 when I play  and just today I tried to move my arm to get a better look at one of the paint jobs I used, and it did fuck all.
---
I've lost a few unyielding pieces, so your theory doesn't fit. I think it has something to do with inventory rollback.
---
The problem was, day 1, literally everyone was down there, so there were no mobs to be found. I personally killed three ghouls and the boss on my first run, and nothing more. But I suspected it was because it was not instanced, and waited for the masses to move on... and it's a lot more interesting when it's not swarmed and looted already. It's not a challenge for a highly geared fancy weapon monster player, but I can see a fresh 50 with no real gear having a lot of trouble.
---
It sure as hell is. I promise ya bud. Look it up
---
Yea I see you in main menu as well :/
---
Not a school holiday in the US that I know of...I think like another person said, survival has become suddenly REALLY hard so the less experienced players are bleeding out to adventure.
---
So, when the scrub you get paired with in LoL won't stop feeding, do you elbow drop the plushies, or what?
---
I was just about to start a discussion to see if drills were desirable. Haha.
---
Dont get me wrong, I LOVE Ark, but honestly that game lowered the bar for me on what to expect from an always online survival.
---
 When people would talk about how broken fallout is i just remind them of Ark, years into the game and its still not much more stable than launch. But ya' know dinosaurs so i still play lol.
---
Certain prefixes are prioritized, for example you might get a powered sentinel assassins piece of armor that is simple referred to as powered dense leather chest piece (dense referring to the current mod). Not sure how prefixes are prioritized, but it‚Äôs worth inspecting every piece you grab/own to make sure you don‚Äôt drop something valuable.
---
Finally. I‚Äôve been so alone...
---
I‚Äôm coming rn bro
---
I bet. Those screws are valuable. 
---
Just do the log sheets with pencil and paper. Less noise to draw the ghouls that way also than all that clacking of typewriter keys.
---
The game date, of all things, is your deal breaker?
---
Yea, the drill and syringer was added back into the loot pool of legendary enemies and they never fixed the issue with the no loot and no legendary item when you kill a legendary and the body disappearing immediately after they die is a problem now
---
I have a Vampire 3* Sledge with SS
---
Unfortunately I‚Äôm gonna be working till about 1am est or so. If you‚Äôre on after that sure.
---
I am not built for continual damage. Sans stim packs, I drop within 10 seconds, less if a gutsy has an eye on me, and spamming stims to overcome that damage can get costly. That said, I will still grab it if its the last one or others are also grabbing, because then I can live long enough to tag the boss some, then go down and hold the pylon for up to 30s while I bleed out. Return and repeat. I generally don't make the first move on them unless I am loaded with stims and willing to burn ten or so to grab all three and still get the boss tag.
---
Yes. Everyone being on different dates says to me they have no immediate plans to implement any sort of sense of passage of time.
---
they can even be placed on stairs and tables but not beds or chairs. :'(
---
Unfortunately I‚Äôm gonna be working till about 1am est or so. If you‚Äôre on after that sure. I‚Äôll take some copper to make cores if you have some to spare as well.
---
To each their own, I guess
---
Any idea where I can find or purchase recever plan?
---
Ok, I‚Äôll prob be awake around 1 so just message of here again then
---
Nvm now you show up online srry
---
Will do.
---
I liked your idea than you lost me
---
Thankfully you can pop over to deathclaw island easily enough when you just need a couple more :D
---
Or, do Uranium Fever once and build a whole new set!
---
I have the Gatling it's a mini Gatling. Someone put the receiver on for me and gave me some ammo to go with it, it was more an experiment just to see what it was about. And I find that I do like it. So now I'm trying to find a receiver plan or purchase one. Thank you for your answer.
---
what would you like for it? I have a bunch of stuff I can trade and caps. The link below has a bulk of what I have for trade but it's a little out date, I also have Assassin's sledge and Unyielding combat armor

---
If we had a main story addition that lead to a GECK we could see changes. But the whole rebuilding idea was a ruse. The overseer is kinda useless. Vault tec wants power, to take over the nukes for dominance. The enclave reactivates defcon 1 and releases scorched. BOS ran off and too little too late. Every other faction is small tatos. You‚Äôre released from the vault to cause mischief in all reality.
---
It‚Äôs really frustrating
---
Pop over to deathclaw island, on the far left of the map. If you're having trouble killing him, you can snipe from the water/across the river. He's pretty low-level though, so it shouldn't be much trouble.
---
I joined Reddit to read about FO76
---
Yes read and learn üëç.
---
I'm hoping they will have some sense of permanency, like civilization actually rebuilding to some degree. Other areas of the fallout world were a little more built up after a few hundred years. It doesn't seem 76 will do that. So even when your in-game clock reads the same date as fo4 dates, 76 will still be the same as 200 years prior. Unless they have plans to cover this with DLC, which time will tell. I doubt it though.
---
Sorry. Didn't mean for anyone to get caught up in my ruse.
---
Ah
---
The reason why is most of the time people who speak about mods get down Voted into hell
---
PC or console? was it renamed? what were you doing before you fast traveled? when did you realize it was gone?
---
please expand on it. we need data to analyze. too many reports like this, it's absurd.
---
I got that impression when the Whitesprings (or any area really) gets nuked repeatedly and no aftermath damage remains ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
---
Very cool. That allows some of us to realize we must experiment more.
---
I'm 100% serious. Just to explain to the people saying I'm pathetic for subbing to this, I was sorting by new in R/all. Idiots. 
---
This game totally sucks and anyone that bought it should have received a refund. Don't play 76, find anything else to do with your life. 
---
Metacritic score: 53
---
There are other games far more worthy.
---
Wow it was a joke lol
---
Well done great write up. Hope tomarrow goes better for you.
---
XB1. Renamed. And atom shop playtime painted. I fast traveled from free range to my camp. Then to encrypted and then it was gone. That's all I know. Hope it helps.
---
Ur the last to know
---
I've only ever fought and killed the queen outside of the leash zone. I haven't seen anything that substantiates the claim this is the cause for the bug or that a bug exists. Every time someone claims the new patch bugged the SBQ, I nuke FSP just to reconfirm that everything is working normally.
---
I have never found a plan there I had been checking regularly. Maybe I can look for a plan there in survival mode. I have found a lot more the little bit I have played.
---
You have to remember the heart of fallout is post-apocalyptic role playing. They want you to take up the mantles of these factions, you are the BoS, you are the enclave. And people are doing it! You have raiders and responders roaming the wasteland. Yes they set you loose on the wasteland but they leave the journey up to you.
---
Thanks for still being here! Got it!
---
What platform?
---
That would definitely be a good plus for this game. Many of us have a lot of items so it's important to really look at what we're doing before we do it.
---
It's always bugged for me, and just barely sticking out of the highest crate next to the skeleton. If you're not putting your reticle right on it, you may not see it.
---
&gt; outside of the leash zone.
---
This is literally impossible to do, you know I'm saying Leash Zone and not Nuke Zone right?
---
Juicehead just made a video about 4 hours ago on mods, backpacks, and the new perks that will be added into the game in the next couple of updates üòä Go check it out, there‚Äôs a lot of information in it
---
PC.
---
Amending OP
---
yeah, renamed items are known do disappear. ridiculous, I know.
---
but there's a much more sinister bug that simply eats your items on fast travel/login. poof. seems more prominent on pc, although they might be related somehow.
---
I don't think this is the case, but did you notice any drop in fps before, during or shortly after the fast travel?
---
I used to do that very often with my nuka grenades.
---
Are you datamining the x,y coordinates or are you manually adding places to the map?
---
And sheepsquatch drops a syringer
---
If you're on PC, I can craft some ammo for you depending on what you need.
---
Could also just run the quest w/ you to help save ammo.
---
Sorry, can't help. I'm sure someone may come to your rescue at some point.
---
You‚Äôre lame so what?
---
Yea no problem dude
---
Check Wardaddy's comment.
---
alwats have a melee weapon for backup ..just like us melee people always keep a gun just in case
---
I'm down for this. DM me if you're still up for it.

---
I was hanging out with my pal at his camp and we fast traveled back to his camp after doing adventures and his 2star BOS bolstering was in a paper bag on the ground right in front of his armor bench, we didn't even realize his was gone until we checked. 
---
I should have clipped it now that I think about it.
---
I've lost pieces due to having to press Square to hack robots and opening my pipboy on a laggy server.
---
Make sure to get unyielding armor to go with that radacool üëåüèºüí™üèº
---
In fairness, if you hadn't seen the Coal Dust armor yet, you'd have no way of knowing.
---
Unless you regularly do nukes (to stock up on mats) and SBQ (to throw all those mats at her) I would recommend changing it to the speedy receiver.
---
Regular 5mm is abundant and the Gatling is great for ammo management. Being mindful  of useage/replenishment and switching to melee as appropriate means is likely  you will never need craft a single round.
---
Ultracite on the other hand is a chore that gets old fast.
---
Note: Fun police please disregard that comment about ammo and turn your nerfdar off, nothing to see here, move along.
---
Counterpoint: advancing the date ingame based on our hours played (or any other measure we want to advance time by) would make our characters ridiculously old, and a little too much for us to swallow as part of lore when no actual being (AFAIK, except Mr House) has a life span going that far.
---
I didn‚Äôt ever expect (though I‚Äôve honestly never thought about it, too) the FO76 date to match up with an FO4 date. FO76 occurs 185 years before FO4, as I‚Äôm sure you know. Did you want your character (and by proxy, every single other character) survive to be 200+ years old? The absolute first dwellers out of the vaults living that long just seems way too much to me, outside of scientific interference from the Institute, or some other scientific group. 
---
I never expected that as a feature, either, because nothing like that had ever been said by grand poobah Howard.
---
Yesterday I had legendary loot show up on the body several minutes after killing.... and several minutes after my initial looting. Three times.  
---
Those gulpers though-- I can't even count how many times I've killed a 3 star legendary gulper to just have the thing disappear into oblivion. More often than not, anyway.
---
Good point
---
DM sent.
---
We were discussing this during our last Fallout session. The crafting vs combat perk swapping is a drag.
---
sorry for the wait, added and online now
---
I tend to do the same. I will use the "come hither" emote when there's a 3 star and wait as long as I can, but for normal stuff- it's hard NOT to one shot them (I'm melee- not gonna waste ammo on glowing ones)
---
I've been using a lvl 25 spear (Lvl 31 right now). Seems like a good choice, given the damage is 67 medium speed.
---
I disagree. Me and my friend are both level 80 but we purposely stopped leveling at level 60 for pvp and we both hit for over 500 with our gauntlets
---
Were you LT Walrus?
---
Well, under "Kill different kinds of cryptids" they're one of the 8 cryptids you have to kill, and that challenge is under the combat challenges.
---
I need to consume one for the challenge.
---
not have the r√©cipe
---
Those two have lower level vertibot. Ammo factory has the highest leveled one
---
Yea thanks man
---
Glad i could help
---
If you arrive after it starts the robot isn‚Äôt marked anymore and only the cows are, I showed up for my first, and I guess the guy who started it left so no one else was there. Every time I‚Äôd walk up to the cows it would say I was leaving the event area.   I don‚Äôt think the quest was completeable at that time
---
Swap life giver for ironclad and move some points from your sluggers to barbarian. That is if you run  no power armor.
---
You still there?
---
Check the ground if there is server lag sometimes a legendary gun will appear next to the body.
---
Well I had a spare calibrated shock thankfully. Crafted it and put it on and when I got off the power armor stand the leg I just crafted was missing again. No where to be found. WTF?  Now I'm out a calibrated leg.
---
mhms, preach.
---
Can do it on fallout 4 as well
---
Only just now realized xD
---
I would place it somewhere between a legendary mirelurk queen and the ISP (when vulnerable).
---
I can vouch for him. This works in 4. I know because I discovered it there and when I got 76 I tried it again, and it works there too.
---
What kinda ammo?
---
That‚Äôs a perfectly understandable situation. I‚Äôm really talking about the people that I‚Äôve seen with the crook but just stand in place and not use it. Or just watch the cows get slaughtered while they‚Äôre next to them.
---

Crypids are the creatures based on real legends, ex: Mothman, Sheepsquatch, Snallygaster, Grafton monster, Flatwoods monster, and Wendigo

You realize that the Queen's health scales with the number of players present right?
---
Oh god that sucks so much. Sorry man.
---
Well aware.
---
I appreciate you reply. And it does make a lot of sense. I probably will just go ahead and switch to the speedy receiver. Thank you
---
I was able to do it myself and I am neither brave nor well equipped.
---
Also, some of us have completely full stashes because we're hoarding stuff, like a ton of trash legendaries... ^please hurry legendary vendor
---
All trying to get that stupid camera. Why make it so random and hard to find.  Used to play daily but just now turned on since Tuesday
---
I honestly wish we were able to put up some pictures that we‚Äôve taken in our camp.
---
We aren‚Äôt though. Modus is using you as a general to get to nukes for enclave. Cant be bos without a command structure. Were vigilantes that answer no no command.
---
Don‚Äôt even get me started on that, I expected the postcard collage that we could put up after doing the quest to be photos we took, I was super sad that they weren‚Äôt.
---
G to Lucky Hole mine with excavator PA and mine the lead ore.  If you have ammo smith or superduper cards when you craft the ammo, it should get you back on track quickly.
---
Only carry salt and toilet paper.
---
Lead Champagne mixed drink recipes can be purchased, but Lead Champagne itself must be learned from the Wasted on Lead Champagne daily from Biv. Keep grinding the dailies and eventually you'll get it.
---
Bought... finally. 
---
Now just the Handmade paint and I'm happy.
---
Joining
---
Fingers crossed for something in the future to share photos in our camps, I‚Äôd even settle for a scrapbook that would show your whole album that could be viewed by anyone.
---
Good news, I scrapped and got the suppressor for the lever action!
---
Honestly it's pretty dumb and glitchy. I don't understand the point when photo mode is a thing, with more features. The first thing my wife asked was "can you put the photos you take up in your camp?"  
---
The answer is no.
---
I‚Äôm putting all my wishing into that honestly, cause I spend a lot of time taking photo‚Äôs and would enjoy being able to appreciate the effort I put into getting the shots I have taken
---
that's what I'm speculating, that a laggy server response (caused by either lag itself or low fps) sees you pressing the key to open the pipboy up, even though you used it for something else, and then you press the one to drop while browsing your gear, or at least that's what the server is seeing.
---
for example, on pc, tab brings the pipboy up. it also cancels interactions. say you open a trade window up and then press tab to close it, except the server never receives the first packet, the one saying you were trading, due to lag. all it sees is you pressing tab to bring the pipboy up since there was nothing to cancel. you then press R to reload and poof, whatever's highlighted is dropped. and because the server refreshes your character on fast travel, you won't notice it until then.
---
if this is the case, a simple "lock" function would fix it.
---
&gt;I should have clipped it now that I think about it.
---
if it ever happens again, please do. we need video proof and footage to analyze.
---
joe's cabin
---
I like it!  
---
Is it perfect?  No, but few things are.  I think in some small way it helps  create a greater immersion for me.  
---
This is me/my character, and I am in this place and I am recording my passing through it.  Is that corny?  Perhaps.  But I used the menu photo manage page to delete  old or crappy pictures I had taken and I cam across a bunch of selfies I took when I started the game.  It was pretty great.  
---
Anyway, I like that I can just hit a hotkey and pull it up and take a picture.  It doesn't handle selfies, though, so I still need to use photo mode for that.
---
Just tried it on mobile and it doesn't grind the browser down to screeching halt. Thanks!
---
Thank you so very much!
---
Just making sure

:)
---
I for one, think legendary weapons should have their effects disabled in certain events, or in a hypothetical new mode.  Put everybody on an even playing field.
---
Oh, where is it located at? Lol

---
Past level 50 each level you can choose to get a new perk card, or to move a special point from one category to another. 
---
Additional perk card selection has never been tied tied to adding special points, even below lvl 50 you can choose a card different from the special point you added.
---
joe mama's house
---
Exactly dude. Seems to me that Bethesda is just rushing to put out some sort of small content to try and keep us occupied while they try to figure out their game plan on how to revive the game
---
a lock function is long overdue. flagging an item not being able to be sold or dropped.
---
would probably fix the vanishing items as well.
---
In the enclave bunker, walk until you see the big blue computer and operations window.
---
Don‚Äôt get me wrong, I think it‚Äôs a great idea I just think that they rushed it, as usual.
---
It's like carrying an old disposable camera around on vacation while having the latest iPhone in your pocket.
---
A feature I've been looking for in a map was workbenches. I can't travel to my camp ever and train stations don't have all the benches, so would it be possible to add where you can find whatever bench, if you have the list. Thanks!
---
Completely agree.  I would of course have realized if there was more of a process involved for locked weapons and armor
---
You and your buddy are an outlier. Most players below level 100 don't have duped weapons or the perfect build. The player I was with was pot shoting the sheepsquatch to death 100 DMG per shot with a combat rufle while I was killing bugs, my rifle that does 3,250 DMG was holstered.
---
People need to know their roll.....if you're level 70 and the best weapon you have is a 1* rifle......you should focus on the smaller stuff. Same as with the SBQ fight.

worst part is that quest items already work like that. all they'd have to do is make it toggle-able...

It's certainly got me to take some interesting pictures I wouldn't have otherwise, since you seem to have to get all up in the face of enemies for it to register.

I actually saw that happen. I was spam selling and it said are you are you want to sell this favorite item? I was blown away. So I favorited the stuff I don't want to sell. Shit didn't work again

Even with White Knight, it seems that the Pylons shred through my armor. I prefer leaving it to my squad in Power Armor with Power Patcher because I'm not about to sacrifice my whole armor set to be at a Pylon for 30 seconds.
---
Huh. Apparently the megalsloth is based one west virginia's state fossil. The giant sloth.
---
Either way, the game is treating it as a cryptid more or less.
---
I guess. Hopefully you‚Äôll be able to put Legendary effects on it with the vendor.
---
Which mod has the best damage? And could the club have better dps than the staff since it's medium swing speed or no?
---
As expected, the server booted me 3/4 if he way through and when I rejoined, it put me outside so I‚Äôll be starting over...
---
You're good to post, it's been done before
---
It technically has a legendary effect and it hits harder than a handmade... if the effect is useful for you then yes absolutely give it a shot.
---
Its not toxic when youve completed every side quest, every main quest, become a part of every faction. Built and rebuilt your base dozens of times. Gotten a countless number of resources and ammunition along with the most powerful guns and power armor in the game. I also hit the cap limit and exhausted pvp from natural means and from taking over workshops. So the only thing left to do is tear down a few walls or amass a 1k+ cap bounty to get people to fight you. The game doesnt have enough content. Most longterm players are the ones doing this because they‚Äôve done everything there is to do. We would make new characters but the quests are incredibly dry and boring after your first time through. And im sure they would flock to the new pvp game mode but from what ive heard its total dog shit.
---
ALL GLORY TO OUR ENCRUSTED NEW RULER!
---
It's actually pretty good. On top of the sneak bonuses, it genuinely does more damage than a normal combat rifle iirc, about 20 percent more. Definitely makes for a good automatic rifle.
---
That is a really good idea!
---
Got a link? I'd love to see what others have built here!
---
You can put one legendary effect which is the scorch legendary mod.
---
But it's only 30% more dmg to scorch, which in my opinion is eh.
---
A.Armor and Faster fire rate would be much better.
---
nope. Haven't been on in months, just follow on and off. I put my on top of the Charleston Tower (whatever it's called, literally the tallest tower in Charleston.) Months ago.
---
The one that spawned for me was a 30 (I was 122 when I did the quest), that shit got pawned immediately
---
I've seen them gain stars after getting hit as well
---
Couldn‚Äôt agree more! Last 7 out of 8 SBQ events I got zip as loot from it.....I dont give a crap about back packs or repair kits....
---
100%
---
I insult them and laugh at them. Call them ma ma's boys and anything annoying I can come up with.
---
Just adding- the real sheepsquatch body keeps vanishing upon death. I've been playing mostly in the mire location. But this is not just the sheepsquatch. It's happening with ghouls at white springs as well. It seems, in my experience, that it's mostly the legendary enemies of all varieties. 
---
Also random cows show up with codes for names. They arent part of the three you herd. 
---
Theres a graphics glitch as well, usually at night time, where the ground in the distance illuminates glowing green. I took a pic if you need it. 
---
Fought a behemoth today, body vanished as I said previously, but returned to the lake where he spawns and he was stuck standing in the water. You could not hit him, as you can corpses. You could walk straight thru it  
---
And I'm not sure if it ever made your lists previously, but uranium fever and death blossoms pop up on the map in the wrong locations.
---
First part I meant, second was to trigger. Thank you.
---
Success!
---
How much?
---
Abbie's bunker? Think there I may wrong though can't remember for sure
---
Not sure about speed demon as I havent noticed a reduced hunger/thirst drain when I use class freak for speed demon, but class freak does work for healing factor.
---
If telsa traps worked off enemy proximity only attacking enemies and could be mounted on walls, they would make for great small pest control.
---
Yes for Healing factor. You can easily check it on the stats. But the negatives for speed demon are increased  thirst and hunger, so I don't know how to test.
---
Aah. Yea I just got the plan &amp; built it at max level. I don‚Äôt even know what I did with the other one.
---
So what you're saying is, you're making other player's experience fucking TOXIC because your dumb ass can't find enough stimulation?  Wow.  You need a hobby.  Besides being a narcissistic, "me first" psycho.
---
I try for these every time I see them. Through fallout 4 and 76 I haven‚Äôt gotten a single one. Someday.
---
I'm glad someone said it!
---
Are you on ps4? If so, the pics automatically get saved to the capture gallery too. I, unfortunately have deleted lots of memories too. Hope we get an increase soon. And maybe a way to ‚Äúconfirm‚Äù if we want the pic saved in the photo gallery too.
---
They vaporize your base every time they fire, but that molerat is dead dead dead
---
Well it already has slight AA on it which is a start
---
I'm pretty sure they expected what they were sold.  A dungeon experience for multiple people that can't be cake walked in 5 minutes by anyone solo.
---
Grind a new character out on survival you could literally be level 50 if you grab a high lvl friend to help you save your perk points , look up a op build for fallout 76 and just plan better but it's not even neccessary you do that , just plan out your character from now till 100 after that its gonna be hard to respec
---
Theres a few ways I think. You can either just follow the main questline until you get there- the end of the Free States questline ties directly into it- and I think you can also trigger it by finding the Overseer‚Äôs holotapes at either Allegheny Asylum (Fort Defiance) or Camp Venture? I don‚Äôt completely remember honestly- I did a lot of the main quests out of order and definitely began the BoS questline before I finished Free States, but the ‚Äòhow‚Äô is a tad hazy.
---
Yes im a psycho because im playing a videogame in a way it was designed to be played. Whatever dude the game would have benefited from another fanbase because everyone plays fallout 76 like its a singleplayer game. And the few people that dont play it cooperatively. My friends and i were extremely excited at announcement because we thought we could form our own raider gang or enclave battalion or whatever we wanted and raid other players, get raided by them. Engage ourselves in the environment. We wanted to fight to be king of the wasteland. We were excited to battle for nuclear control too. Unfortunately nobody plays like this. Believe it or not it isnt a toxic decision to play an open ended rpg the way you want to play it. Maybe try some pvp its a ton of fun when you get into half hour long battles with other people instead of people who quit when you wind up near their camp
---
But why have a weaker version of a weapon that ways the same as a legendary that does more dmg?
---
Don't worry Bugthesda will patch this in and it only cost you a minor sum of 25k at Adams!
---
They keep in storage forever, by the by. I've won two thusfar but I've not been brave enough to eat one.  
---
Maybe for my birthday...
---
Oh, so does the date on the pipboy not move at all ever? Or am I reading this wrong?
---
Your point of timekeeping leading to crazy old age is what already exists in the previous fallout games, though. In 76, they've actually removed this from the game. I think the character being ridiculously old is therefore less ridiculous than a world with zero passage of time in a game that always had time keeping and, by default, ridiculously old characters.
---
Given that its fallout, ridiculously old characters could be worked around by implementing Age itself as a condition that will increase no matter what, but that you can manage to some degree (drugs and drink make you age faster, cooked food and water slows it down). From there, add a quest where, as a most basic example, you meet some auto-doc that heals you to a youthful age, resetting your Age condition. If Age is allowed to progress too far, make it so players start getting random debuffs, crazy mutations, randomly drop dead, and maybe some funny fallout-ish benefits (you're so old and irradiated, your atoms are decaying and separating. 1% chance attacks will pass through you, 10% chance of nuclear explosion upon death, .01% chance to randomly go nuclear at any time). This clears up the aging process, and also frees the game up to include a sense of time passing and civilization actually rebuilding to some degree. Rebuilding by the community, hopefully.
---
At the very least, I think it would be awesome to see DLC that adds a way to pick up hints about what's happening outside Appalachia right then, so you can get a sense of where you are in time in fallout lore. Something like finding a holotape on a BOS soldier talking about heading to Boston under Maxson's orders, or finding a courier with one of the decoy items House mentioned.
---
Fallout has been my favorite game for years. 76 has been Salt Upon Wounds.
---
No I tried that a couple times. Only plans
---
Well as someone else said it is kind of dependent on your build/playstyle and I just so happen to enjoy using stealth which is what the gun was built for
---
I loved this rebuttal, but Salt Upon Wounds is the cherry on the sundae.
---
Very well done, good sir!
---
It‚Äôs this terminal specifically

Couldn't get it to work, but maybe there's been an update recently that's messed with it. It's my first time modding 76, though. Got the perk-saver mod thing. Plans shine green doesn't seem to work either. Still happy with what I've got!
---
When you use the term "we", you mean you and your multiple personalities correct? 
---
Have fun making everyone's 76 adventure experience dog shit because you have the attention span of a goldfish.
---
No i mean myself and my buddies. Kinda ironic that youre calling me toxic when all you‚Äôve done is try to insult me instead of you know hearing me out or maybe even giving a decent counter argument
---
You are awesome for bringing light into a dark dark dark place
---
Basically lol

literally not the same thing lol.

Tree fiddy

I can agree with that,  lol the amount of times I had to suicide for some creatures

Thank you!!!

All good! :)

---
Healing Factor is explicitly written to work with Class Freak, so probably yes. For Speed Demon, Class Freak uses the generic spell magnitude effect, which probably doesn't work because Speed Demon's modifier is applied in a perk.
---
Empath has the same problem. There are probably others too.
---
*yawn*.  Oh honey you are too cute.  Now you're making the "pity me" play.  Come on.  
---
I'm done talking with you.  You have the emotional capacity of a small, neglected child.  Good luck.
---
I'm sorry, been there before as well
---
The is a max limit on renames unfortunately
---
I suppose you could keep moving and time how long it takes thirst to drop from max, although that's going to take a while. For what it's worth, thirst and hunger should drop 1.4x faster with Speed Demon.
---
All i hear when you talk is ‚Äúi dont like your opinion so that must mean youre a bad person! REEEEEEEEEEEE!!‚Äù
---
Marine already has minor anti-rad effects. IMO, they should increase them so a full set is good enough to be worn in a nuke zone.
---
You on Xbox I‚Äôll take a mascot outfit for 500

Prevents pinching too!

This, I've also randomly eaten the wrong thing this way.

Gotcha. If stealth is the main focus, do what works for you.

Just there no need to hid from enemies if you can one shot them. ü§£

wait for it to change to a pile of meat/melted robot. it does if you haven't looted it yet.
---
if you didn't get a hit in on it, you won't see it once it does change.
---
Note that it is not the terminal, it is the big mainframe at the back.
---
If you walk into the room and take a picture of just the mainframe it doesn‚Äôt register. You have to be standing at this terminal.
---
Where did you find the plan?
---
Exactly, I love this game as well and its hella better with friends
---
From the Sheepscuatch Imposter Event
---
The fixer only has faster movement if aiming and better sneak as effects, where do you see anti armor?
---
*.38 ammo intensifies*

It‚Äôs in the modifications I think
---
1k caps
---
Ughh. How are you not getting this. 
---
When the "beta test" ended and the game launched, you must have expected it to launch in pretty much the same state correct?
---
But you still bought it, knowing the game was launching in it's beta state.....
---
So you couldn't have been an unknowing beta tester.......
---
Confirmed. I emote'd with my camera out and teleported.
---
I got the outfit by completing one of the newbie responder quests in Flatwoods confirmed.

I swap from Sniper to SMG when in events with more than 2 people, if it‚Äôs me + someone I just shoot once and move on.

If in group I just tap em with SMG

That happen to me with the sbq once and no joke it was all trash lol. Three rerolls and all crap.

They only have to put a time limit on the workshop. Then you would be locked out of it for awhile. Then nobody could sit on a workshop. Or just eleminate workshops and allow us one portable resource extractor.
---
It would be nice to be able to view all the perks in game and not need to go to the internet but as far a build planning goes [NukesDragons](https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks) is better than anything they would put in the game. 
---
It lets you select what you want for an end build then gives you level by level road map for perk selection and SPECIAL distribution plus the info on what level you need to be to have collected all cards and your end stats in different situations. It looks nice on mobile as well and if you're a PC player it's a must if you use the Perks Loadout mod.
---
Yeah the siren is hella annoying. I stopped using it because it does go off every time you travel back. Same with the terminal and laser wires. Half the time I go through my own laser trip wire my traps go off when I know for sure the terminal is set to hostile only, and it even happens when they're on disarmed. So it's lame
---
I have definitely seen the around Harper's, it was ages ago though. It was really annoying cause i was searching for normal pods too, for super stim crafting
---
It's a tough lesson to learn but pa is pretty much only good for pve. People run anti armor and bloodied and all kinds of non pa builds that just turn any pa into paper
---
Are you still updating this?
---
It‚Äôs the hunger games

I don't know if this is ignorance or apathy but I couldn't care less.

No need for cooldown, just not usable while in Combat. Possible problem solved.

I've noticed differently named cows, but I didn't think it was a bug, I just thought random cows would spawn.

Yea you can add armor piercing rounds but apparently it's a trap..?

Just learned something new thanks!

Did you manage to fix it? I have the same problem except I get no quests at all. I had toss dross for a bit but when I went there it was gone.
---
Pewp.
---
IKR
---
you playing on the Atari 2600?
---
Why would you take multiple workshops if you don't want to PVP? Everyone knows the second you take a workshop you're in danger. 
---
1 workshop you might get away with, but multiple? That's like a giant waving flag of "I WANT TO PVP". You are signing your own death warrant.
---
Cool. But from across the map?
---
G\_G, accidently ate mine a few days ago
---
If you do go into the room and jump up on the window ledge in front of the terminal it counts too
---
 They could have the same 'enemies' but show them with different names and skins...
---
The negatives of speed demon aren't too bad to begin with. I tried not getting class freak on a newer character to free up luck points and didn't really notice a huge difference at all.
---
Literally anywhere they can find you. If you take workshops never ever ever go back to your CAMP unless you're crochet and in stealth. The PVPers will straight up nuke you shit if they're in that mood. 
---
Like, don't get me wrong, I hate it. I hate that I can't use workshops. I hate that people can track me back to my base on a whim and fuck with my shit. 
---
But it is what it is, and when you get multiple workshops...
---
If they know where you are before they take the workshop they can have a teammate ft to you and kill you because you‚Äôre considered an enemy. Yes.
---
Ohhhhhhhhhhhh.
---
One way they could do it, if it is an environment hostile to both players, is have both players experience the same enemies on an abstract level but display different skins and names.  One player would think he is fighting ghouls while another player thinks they are fighting whatever.
---
Sure I'll take one
---
I literally made this exact request in December and the sub downvoted it to oblivion. This subreddit is hilarious.
---
Oh I'm saying I know for sure the way I dropped mine was due to user error while using Robot Hacking, my pal's I witnessed the whole thing and have no idea how it happened.
---
Ok just add me and fast travel to me, same psn as my username
---
A new perk build blueprint every 50 levels would be awesome.
---
I know how it works. It just seems cheap, man, I don‚Äôt know. I‚Äôm fine with people taking my workshops and wanting to fight it over at that workshop. Just having a teammate be able to two shot me in Power Armor out of nowhere is dumb. IMO
---
It would have to be areas that are hostile or peaceful to both players.  Then you could have the same abstract enemy objects but display different skins and names.  One player would think they are fighting ghouls and the other something else but both would be fighting together.   It could actually work with decent gameplay possibilities allowing for a changing decision based world.
---
I'm assuming square drops items? been a while since I played the PS4 version.
---
I'll try rebinding reload/holster. although it's hard to replicate it could be months before it happens again... or doesn't.
---
Just server hop
---
After 400hrs I discovered the component view for junk in the Pip-Boy! üòÇ
---
Yeah, I hate that crap. I had it happen to me during a SBQ last night, super frustrating.
---
Yeah I can't get mine to trigger most of the time. Sometimes it triggers and then disappears if I dont do it right away
---
He looks much more relaxed.
---
second day of playing after the game  came out I got 2 in a row I had peaked at that point never got another one
---
You might be better having evasive in agility and sacrifice weapon durability for nerd rage in intelligence. Also get tenderizer/suppressor in charisma rather than travel agent. You dont really want any quality of life perks for survival.
---
Fireproof 3 in endurance is essential aswell e especially if youre having trouble with explosive weapons. Also adamantium skeleton is good.
---
How about a motion capture camera. That would be cool.
---
i think hes talking about the floating airdrop container
---
It'd help if people didn't explosive it's corpse after it died, sending it into the stratosphere, too. 
---
Today I saw something interesting. It died, and entered stealth. If I hadn't seen it happen, I would have probably never been able to find it's body, as it was under a bush.
---
Getting on now
---
Ok
---
That's all I can do, thanks guys!
---
Has anyone managed to loot or even find its corpse yet though?
---
Also, what‚Äôs the % on quest items?      Can‚Äôt tell how often the hat, pjs, other hat, and Skyrim armor drop
---
What‚Äôs your tag again?
---
Piercepotato
---
What ammo? I usually go through blackwater mines for shotgun, then scrap everything for 556
---
Friend request sent
---
No problem thank you
---
i carry around the "I.O.U. Beer" notes to put in peoples bags when i kill them, its good fun
---
How do I do the Free States questline then?
---
You can't get in big lobbies because almost nobody is playing on survival.
---
Start a new character.
---
Gatekeep much?
---
I posted a thread about this yesterday or the day before. The mods responded and said they are aware of the issue :)
---
Not a flex. Proving a point... there‚Äôs still so much to do past lvl 100, 200 or even 300.
---
Due to a shortage of I and X, any issues scheduled for ‚Äúfixed‚Äù will temporarily be ‚Äúf‚Äîed‚Äù.
---
It appears that the mod disappeared after I attached it, I‚Äôm gonna try restarting but even if i really lost it I‚Äôll still give you the plasma cores i find
---
I don't get the why of it. The photo mode in game is, frankly, "better" for taking screenshots. As a mechanic, it's neat for quests, but...it's also easily lost, and it seems like it's not fucking replaceable, which is...idiotic.
---
Do you have a idea of what build you want? That's a good way to start fixing your perk cards
---
Oh wtf that sucks. I‚Äôll keep an eye out for one as well. That blows.
---
Ok, thanks
---
I need this as a poster for my camp... but BGS has too much pride to put it in the game. I'd pay monies.
---
I‚Äôm not sure. Mine was only 2gb ish
---
Do you have one head to give or sell on pc ?
---
Well... if you want to excel in combat (which a huge point of the game is), you want to pick a combat specialty and focus hard on it. The more damage you do, creates a domino effect on a ton of other things in game. Less ammo used. Less repairs needed to weapons and armor. Those all mean more junk saves. Less aid items used. That usually means more caps in your pockets from selling excess. Faster clear times. That means faster leveling and/or more time to do other stuff, like gather even more resources.
---
So what I‚Äôd suggest is think about what weapons you‚Äôve used so far, and what playstyles you‚Äôve liked, then go to nukesanddragons.com and play around with the SPECIAL builder, to come up with a *combat* perk build you want to have at 50. Don‚Äôt forget that you can swap perk cards out at will once you have them, so your build should be focused on combat first, then you can swap out other cards as needed.
---
Rifleman is basically your sniper build. Long range, high power, slow fire rate typically, usually involving stealth and sometimes vats. 
---
Commando is your soldier build. Short-medium range, high rate of fire, medium damage, sometimes involving vats or stealth.
---
Shotgun is your close range disabler. Very high damage and reasonably fire rate, but high spread and limited armor piercing capabilities. However the Enforcer perk is the best enemy disabler in the game.
---
Heavy Weapons is your assault backbone. Power armor mandatory imo, because of the Stabilized perk. I find it synergize very well with explosives builds too, since all the explosives launchers are Heavy Weapons, if you have Bear Arms perk you can carry 9 heavy weapons for the weight of 1 modded out rifle. No stealth, no vats, just full auto firepower. An ‚Äúeasy‚Äù build to get in to too since you aren‚Äôt having to worry about finding fancy legendary armor. Just a couple good power armor mods and you‚Äôre set. 
---
The various melee builds play fairly similar, they‚Äôre all high damage high risk since you‚Äôre in the teeth of the enemy. 2h is all about massive damage with slow hits, but it‚Äôs not in high favor due to the fact that unarmed can do basically the same damage with a faster attack speed. You can use 2h in power armor however; can‚Äôt do that with unarmed.
---
Unarmed is usually seen as your glass cannon melee build, since most people playing it are running Bloodied builds for insane damage but only having 20% health all the time.
---
1h is usually people going for really fast attack speeds with combat knives and similar.
---
There‚Äôs no faction affiliation. Max sell value between charisma and hard bargain is 25%, although I don‚Äôt remember the exact formula. It‚Äôs not that hard to reach, I think hard bargain and about 15 charisma gets you there (grape mentats are your friend!)
---
God damn it, now you've made me want to make it with sticker letters... this is going to take hours...
---
Theres a nice camp just nw of the radio research building that sounds like youd enjoy. You can build a camp there.
---
Be more specific. What exactly do you need help with?
---
Yeah I regret discovering everything too quickly, at least they're adding new things slowly
---
I saw a glitch where I saw someone's special named items for a flash when opening the trading screen.
---
That's not an update, that's around the size of the full game. Sounds like the client detected corrupted files or you're running mods that the client doesn't like.
---
I was in WS tonight and killed quite a few Legendaries. One thing I noticed is that I would go to loot the body and there would be no legendary items, but if I went back over them a minute later, the legendary item had spawned in. So I did get legendaries from each one I killed. So maybe go back after a minute and check again. Or maybe this is a whole other issue ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
---
Yup, I‚Äôve been on 9/10 for months.
---
1. Game is in a decent place. 
---
2. Severs are still kinda iffy for some. I get the occasional crash now and then. 
---
3. PvP balance still sucks. Survival can be fun though when its not a 1 shot fest. 
---
4. QoL is improving steadily
---
5. Imposter Sheepsquatch is definitely a fun challenge. End game needs more boss fights like that. 
---
6. Depends on what you decide to do. There are people with 700 hours who haven't hit that old or repetitive wall yet. 
---
7. Lots of new content. What they don't talk about on the roadmap they sometimes reveal in their Inside the Vault posts every Thursday.
---
No gas mask? Fail.
---
I did try that. It just happened to me again on the squatch. 
---
The bodies actually despawned with nothing in the inventory. I also tried bouncing back from far enough that I got the inv. loading wheel in it.
---
You're talling aboutbthe loot for the imposter event Encryptid (I think you are at least), there's a new event called Free Range with the real thing
---
I think because they had their weapon sheathed
---
No they were red and shooting at me
---
Do you think my game data will be lost or what?
---
This happend consistantly for 20 mins
---
1 double XP weekend per month would be perfect. I'm working on my second character. A medic and mutation build.
---
sometimes the game can just crap out and its always at the worst time
---
If your looking for yellowcake I'll trade you some for violet
---
I always go for the pylons first.  Then as soon as they‚Äôre activated, I will hit the imposter until it says that activate pylon(s).  Then I‚Äôll just run back and forth between them to make sure they stay powered up. My teammates are really good about doing the same thing as well.  I‚Äôll heal people too as I‚Äôm running back and forth...except for the ones that aren‚Äôt actually doing ANYTHING to help...I do let them die. Of you‚Äôre a lower level and get your hit on the imposter, then run around and revive people...at least do SOMETHING.
---
Dont have any
---
I don't play on PS so I'm not sure what the sync process looks like but your saved game file should be stored with Bethesda, which means you should be good to pick up where you left off once it redownloads.
---
Oh that‚Äôs a relief
---
Exactly. I've turned down tons of requests to team up just because I don't want to shuffle my cards around.
---
I'll kill stuff with ya; but I don't know you well enough to change my perks.
---
Pretty sure everyone gets the shepherd's crook plan and mutton meat pie recipe their first time no matter what
---
its a camp object so you can interact with it to turn it on or off but it doesnt have power so it does nothing
---
I have the owling wall mount and it requires just cloth bones and wood. So I can't confirm there isn't one but I can confirm you don't need parts for the wall mount
---
My character cant hold two pylons normally and no one ever takes the third. I don't have the resistance to take all three. Grab the last pylon and stop shooting at the INVULNERABLE enemy. So frustrating to waste stimpacks on stupid people.
---
Nice original post dude. Eye opening!
---
Crimson?
---
I need to put this on my camp wall.
---
Taz pretty much covered everything, but another thing is see if you can find some higher levels to team up with that can help you. There really are a lot of great, helpful people out there that would be happy to help. I‚Äôd be happy to help you, but I‚Äôm a melee build with a little heavy guns in there, so if you‚Äôre looking for a rifle/stealth/etc build, I‚Äôd try to find people that can help you with that. Don‚Äôt be shy about asking people you see on the server for help. Yes, there are some douche nozzles, but they are few and far between. Good luck üòÅ
---
I fully agree and endorse this suggestion, let's hope Bethesda read this post.
---
I am fine with pvp except 98% of the time it's completely unfair and you just get killed immediately by someone that has good legendaries.

---
Thanks, interesting info, especially about anti armor.
---
You should also consider the instigating effect, it may be one of the best effects for melee or any sneak build which double the damage output on your first hit : you often don't need another hit, and it doesn't force you to have low health to be effective.
---
What is DCG?
---
I would love hotkeyed perk loadouts. 
---
This new perk system has a lot of faffing.
---
Same. Super sledge power swings. My deathclaw gauntlet seems to always connect.
---
Give that to someone leveling or save it for an alt. You can actually sell good low level gear pretty well too.
---
I was on my alt tonight (lvl 15), and dropped a guy with 40 levels on me. It's  a matter of awareness and choosing your battles.
---
Yeah, 9 times out of 10 that guy would curbstomp my alt, but if I were worried about that, I would not have been at that workshop.
---
Had one physically drop their weapon before even killing them, other times it's appeared after a minute, and others I've looted from a nearby non-legendary. It's weird.
---
I've played for over 1300 hours and have picked up 7 of these. Every single one of them was within 1 week. Haven't seen any pies outside of that week.
---
Level 15 is fine, when you are level 90 and still get fecked by a guy where it's literally impossible because he has explosive weapons that can stagger you so you cant move and it's over, but good job killing that fella.
---
I don't know what to say. Just did it since you posted. Name of structure should pop up on screen.
---
People be wanting my all rise when I‚Äôm selling junk lol
---
Ok thx all
---
Oh, I run 3 star one gun army on my main. It's great for those 1 hit melee builds.
---
Some notes from ESM browsing:
---
1. Bloodied is explicitly defined in 5% hp bands. Results are as you list.
---
2. Furious is capped at 9 hits in the data, but I could only get a 6-hit bonus last time I tested. Maybe a time-limit issue.
---
3. Berserker is +50% max at 0hp. I'd give the rest of the data but it's obviously terrible and not worth bothering with.
---
4. The numbers on Nocturnal are +50% (0000 to 0600) to -35% (0600 to 2100). I've heard larger numbers in practical tests. Not sure why.
---
5. Junkie's should be +10% per addiction, capped at +50%.
---
6. The "while aiming" legendary effects do check GetInIronSights, but it might be bugged.
---
I'm doing some reworking for a rifleman vats stealthy ish build but I decided late so I have to do alot of perk point reworkingüòÖ
---
Perk Manager, an absolutely amazing mod, I use it as well. But I thought he was suggesting something more akin to being able to change your role entirely on the fly, like SPECIAL allocation. It would be pretty nice to not be basically stuck with one SPECIAL setup. Not to bring up the "behemoth" that is World of Warcraft, but that's exactly what you can do in WoW for each class.
---
I've seen flux go from anywhere between 50 all the way to 300 a piece. On average it sticks closer to 50 except for violet and crimson, those usually stay closer to 100... all depends on the need.
---
( Õ°¬∞ Õú ñ Õ°¬∞)
---
Heh, that main reason I made an alt, didn't want to ruin my heavy gunner spec. Doing the stealth/sniper thing on my alt as well.
---
Maybe? Far as I know, it's just an Atomic Shop item.
---
I think its bugged.
---
I'm having trouble with the challenges too.
---
No surprise :/
---
Yeah, there are some weird bugs with sorting...I‚Äôve seen things jump around in the list before. They definitely need the lock feature because it‚Äôs not feasible to favorite every item you want to lock or paint it with an atom shop paint

This is one of the major exploits I had in mind whne making this post. Where you contest a workshop of a high level player for 25 caps, fast travel to his location and even if the contest fails, he will still be hostile until you kill him. I think he even cannot attack you as the attacker stops being hostile if the event fails, but the owner does not
---
People use this to hunt level 200 people for big cap rewards
---
You can do pretty much ALL of that in Survival Mode. There's also been new content every month (or more often) since like... February? Maybe come back and try Adventure Mode for the lore and then go fuck around in Survival Mode to get your PvP rocks off. The only real downside I've seen to Survival is that there is absolutely no safe zone in that mode. It's pure chaos unless you're in a group.
---
I have one page for full combat and one carry/combat mix (use this 90% of the time) for when farming up scrap or goofing around exploring. The other 3 are purely utility. Crafting, Max carry weight, and lockpicking/hacking/vendoring.
---
It's much more useful for the annoying stuff you swap in and out a lot then actual combat use. Shooting something with a shotgun isn't much different then shooting them with a rifle or a heavy or meleeing them to death lol.
---
I always have fun with it. I just picked up a troubleshooters swing speed pole hook and it wrecks everything at that event.
---
Question about berserker does the endurance perk which gives physical and energy resistance (forgot the name atm) effect it?
---
One of the biggest ones is that you can contest a workshop of someone else, and they will still be hostile for you after the event fails, so you can easily fast travel to them afterwards to hunt them down at your own leisure, I even heared that in you are not hostile for them in game perspective, so they are powerless as you can give them the first hit (often one shotting them anyway)
---
Especially since this game has easily make you do more damage then one can build defenses for, a level 40 can destroy a level 200, and reap all the caps (about 200 caps for killing them I believe)
---
But like...why would I want this disease?
---
Yeah that's what everyone keeps telling me but the 2 times I've killed a diseased stinging I didn't get jelly fingers.. I'll keep trying though. The diseased sting wings are just so hard to find. I see glowing and regular all the time just not diseased. And yes according to the popular theory so far the diseased mirelurk spawn or the diseased strangler mirelurk is how you get woopsies. I've been too preoccupied with trying to get jelly fingers that I haven't had time to try and find the  diseased mirelurk spawn or diseased strangler mirelurk to test out the woopsies theory. So if anyone knows any good spots for those 2 mirelurk species or the sting wings I will gladly take the advice!
---
Varying locations, there's a literal list of places he can spawn so you just have to go to every single one until you find him. If he is nowhere server hop and try again.
---
Yeah I know but I don't know where exactly he would be at the locations?
---
Been saying this since 5 hours into the game lol. I was really surprised they didn't launch with this option, seemed like a no-brainer to me. That and having all the utility perks as a separate passive page that is always active. It's not like our character would just forget how to hack a computer or how to pick a lock or smooth talk a robot to get better deals lol. The way they went about perks in this game is pretty atrocious and it seems like not much thought went into it.
---
Exactly what a synth brahmin would be named.
---
Becaaaaaaaaause there's a challenge to get all 22 diseases in the game for 80 atoms, and due the nature of getting and the chances of contracting it, for eons now it's felt pretty much impossible to complete that challenge.
---
For achievement I suppose. That player had 21/22 until he contracted Woopsies.
---
Yes, any form of DR whatsoever affects it.
---
Yeah I feel this is kinda inconsistent. Buffs debuffs diseases mutations they all carry over but what's with addictions?
---
very insightful, especially because ESMs are real confirmations. Thank you for this (:
---
Most likely just increase carry weight. Having them tied to your stash or them be their own stash wouldn't make sense and would be unnecessarily clunky.
---
I agree; In my opinion, Instigating is the best effect for farming. I only briefly mentioned it because it does exactly what it says (:
---
Cool, gotta go try that!
---
Thanks dude! This helped so much. Been looking for this for days.
---
I‚Äôd like the option to increase camp build limit/size
---
I jumped servers at the water park, if he's there you can see him without having to move, he's lying against the car in front of you and to the right a touch.
---
There is no set-in-stone place where there are guaranteed 3 Stars, just gotta go where theres lots of enemies and pray. Good places I can tell you are West-Tel, Huntersville, the Cabins by Top of the World, the Free Range event, All Horde events, the Leader of the Pack event, AWOL Armaments event, and the General's Steakhouse.
---
About those things you see people selling all the time, they are one of 3 things; they are super lucky and got it from a drop, they got it through a trade and are flipping it, or it is leftover from the duping fiasco that happened super early on in this games lifespan.
---
I think camera is a complete waste of dev time, considering we already have the photomode. I don't use it, I already have my photo album of my prefered places on the map, they are perfectly well done in photomode and I don't remember any occasion where I would have needed the camera instedd of the photomode. And I don't need to craft some film to use it either.
---
However, when i note the workshop owners location, take the workshop then go where they were and destroy their entire CAMP and them. That's griefing.
---
I‚Äôm pretty sure everything uses the D-Pad and ‚ÄúX‚Äù button.
---
Yeah I know thank u
---
At Colonel Kelly monument I found him right next to the monument itself lying on his back on one of the benches surrounding it.
---
PSA: do the quest straight away. I dilly rallied pursuing other matters, was hit by our friend 'Disconnected from the server' and the quest has vanished from my log.
---
Ive also heard people using the Burrows to farm Legendaries just cause there are alot of ghouls down there but idk
---
You cannot VATS those who are crouched. He was probably crouch jumping and moving in bursts to avoid being constantly under your VATS.
---
Yeah I know the um. Locations but I don't know where he lies I only know the water park and the monument
---
I've completed the forest photo ones without vault tec university so you can complete it - there are 25 locations you only need 20 pictures.
---
I can't remember if that was a bugged one or not tobehonest though as so.e.pboto challenges want you to be.in an exact spot for.it.to work.
---
Ah. Didn't know.
---
Well, that is assuming that there is one singular way to play the game ‚Äúcorrectly‚Äù which is really impossible, as that is a subjective view versus objective. 
---
By allowing the players to interchange cards at any time, making it more burdensome counteracts the idea of why they added that option in the first place. Just because some players feel, perhaps for purity or immersion purposes, that your character is truly a role played by you, they yes, those players should theoretically set their build and never change it. But that is not how everyone plays. And the option to change out your perks is viable in the game and thus adding a quality of life improvement would not counteract the immersive RPG‚Äôers but enhance the experience for those seeking a QoL improvement.
---
I have a coupke combat, exploring (weight, search perks, etc) and CAMP. My main unarmed combat and exploring have 2 variants for when I team up that changes Charisma perks.
---
He wasn't crouched jumping sides and running and still couldn't be vats
---
Running and jumping and still couldn't be targeted
---
WestTek and sitting near fissure prime.. Make sure you're heavily supplied
---
Your data matches up fairly well with mine, although my testing has in fact reached the 9hit limit (10th hit was the limit, no further increases after that).
---
Practical tests are tricky if the target is armored, because higher damage naturally acts as armor piercing, so if your target in practical testing has any armor, a 50% increase in pip-boy damage would result in a 60-70% increase in actual health damage.
---
Diminishing returns for AA is absolutely true, because AA Effects stack multiplicatively, which means if you have Incisor, an AA weapon is taking off 50% of 25%, meaning it really only removes 12.5% more armor. And since the DR-damage formula itself is pretty flat, if reducing your target‚Äôs armor by 50% nets a 28.5% actual damage increase, reducing it by 12.5% is about a 7% damage increase. TL;DR- AA is terrible for melee users (who should always use Incisor).
---
Gotta nuke it first for best results, imo, but yeah, there can be ridiculous amounts spawned there.
---
Ugh launching nukes, something I never do cause it takes too long to make it worthwhile to me. I also hate the stupid amount of robots
---
But ideally you could server hop and farm it like West Tek. RNG bless you
---
I have experienced this too but I cannot find a pattern.
---
Not just with this event - although this one is the only one where if the game decides to throw the kitchen sink at you is going to be hairy - but with Census Violence, AWOL Armaments, Uranium Fever... and I will stop at this point enumerating events and say is fair to assume every single one that spawns waves of enemies.
---
Which is the vast majority of them.
---
This must be in the top three most broken widely used (and in the case at hand overused) mechanics in the game along with sneak in general and melee VATS accuracy collision detection.
---
Completely unrelated question? How do I not get shat on by everything in this game without using power armor. I have like over 200 ballistic defense and like ghouls 2 shot me. Mind you im using a Bloodied Build so I dont have a lot of health to start with. Some reason I can eat like 5 scorchbeast blasts tho...makes no sense.
---
I found the perfect location for a camp:
---
It‚Äôs in whitespring but far enough away so that it can‚Äôt get nuked (it‚Äôs on the snake emblem)
---
It has a water source
---
It has a small shop to sell goods
---
It has flat ground
---
Sometimes spawns around Hopewell Cave. Found my first one there before playing the Free Range event
---
Yea, ideally I could but people out here nuking freakin Morgantown for some reason lmao
---
This.
---
Sneak +-work, just escape artistan is somehow not as good as it used to be.
---
When I was trying to find an answer to this, I kept seeing factions being mentioned but I guess it was just people mixing up systems from the previous games. 15 charisma though... I was planning on just sticking with 3 to share a card and swap to hard bargain rank 3 when buying/selling. I'm not really trying to maximize profits, just trying to find out wtf the math is so i can look at something and know whether or not the weight to cost ratio is even worth holding on to.
---
Hashtag milkchallythemoomoo
---
Can't help with that... Yet.
---
About to embark on another hide and seek quest to find it and see if I can get the quest to 're-trigger'; if I find it elsewhere I will let you know where exactly.
---
I found him first try propped up against a car at the water park north of the map.
---
Found him
---
Congrats ha
---
Thank you, thank you, Seattle down now let's all have a drink
---
You can get the nuka shines in dude ha
---
Yep. Exactly.
---
Yup
---
Nope doesn't work still disconnects.
---
Ewww, sticky udders
---
My man, been looking since the update lol
---
Now if only sludge lung would register for the challenge
---
It wouldn't be an interesting photo if it was just a fat guy in a gas mask. Showing off your character's weird face is the best part.
---
After 700 hour gameplay? You are persistent.
---
After 50 hour I realised this game made same mistakes that Ubisoft did with Division 1. Semi-finished game without end content, without real social in game support.
---
After 200 hour, I play because my wife play too, we play together and finish some challanges, but we can say nothing to do.
---
Yes what you mention (~ loudouts, ~ perk blueprints, ~ deks etc) that would be awesome too and other QoL with perks, 
---
- difficult to find
---
- better sort
---
- better UI
---
- better respec
---
Unfortunately, I don't see much chance for this. Zenimax Online Studios (ZOS) (Bethesda's other subsidiary) the creator of Elder Scrolls Online (ESO). ZOS didn't do that in 5 years in ESO but community would like so much loadouts, save builds. Fortunately on PC there are Addons, and community create addons to save builds + gear, but console players sad, on console there isn't addon support. 
---
It seems ESO performs better than FO76, ESO had better and more contents at begginings. We will see after 5 years.
---
But in FO76 lots of thing to do to create a great game. ESO had second chance and luck to create a great game. I hope FO76 will have too.
---
QoL changes are important, some time we will more happy with small changes than with new contents, but this game need sooo much systems.
---
- Chat
---
- Guild funcions
---
- Auction houses or something like that (in ESO there is guild traders not AH that is good enough too)
---
- Instanced Dungeons, Trials (Raids) with LFG system.
---
- More world bosses, more events, more quests
---
- New zones, new Missions
---
- Holiday events
---
- Semi-long Long term goals
---
And I feel decks is not the top priority.
---
So I get what your saying about the workshop. However I was building at the sunshine tidings co-op when a guy showed up. Waved and one shot me with a shotgun (I was lvl 48). I respawn try to take him again and get killed again. Ok fair enough right? But here‚Äôs the kicker. The guy didn‚Äôt even want the workshop he killed me and left.
---
Try any area with mobs, aside from events. Usually I get lucky and find a legendary (not that the drop is worth a damn)
---
I actually like it. I'm surprised because it's paper dmg is lower than my handmade and lever action, but it does the job and does seem to enhance my ability to sneak. I still carry my other weapons though.
---
Yellowcake is the easiest to get IMO, because it is everywhere around Whitesprings when nuked. I've got like a dozen right now, but I need them to make mutation serums, and I can sell those for 500 caps a piece to vendors, so there is no reason for me to sell the flux for cheap. If I had extras I'd probably ask for 100 caps per flux.
---
Yes you see I forgot to mention the reason I‚Äôm asking is because I need help doing it
---
Hahaha! You're my hero.
---
Not quite though? In the last two days I have experienced on several occasions going from hidden to caution to danger in a matter of seconds just by being in the general vicinity of an enemy's back who doesn't have 'aggro' yet and stayed in danger after all enemies had been cleared...
---
The best I can describe it is 'like sneaking with your pop-boy light on' except of course is off.
---
Once it happened it kept happening until I logged out/server hopped.
---
I see lvl 100+ people ignore the pylons so me a lvl 50 has to activate them and die like 30 seconds later
---
Gone.
---
Good then there‚Äôs hope
---
Ever see an anti armor?
---
From what ive heard survival mode is pretty fucjed up right now. And what lore lol? Theres literally 10hrs worth of lore in the game. The game was made to be an open world ‚Äúhave it your way rpg‚Äù
---
Hollllld up... This works on Scorchbeasts? Do I have to shoot the wings or what? I mean, I honestly consider myself a damned good shot, but hitting a wing (intentionally) of one these flying assholes is harder than it sounds.
---
I use Beserker! It's great fun!
---
You don't seem to be aware of the exploit with workshops.
---
When you contest workshops, the attacker and owner go into pvp mode.
---
When the contest ends, either success or fail, the attacker goes out of pvp mode. The defender does not.
---
If you own abandoned bog town, and are tooling around in your camp by vault 76, I can pay money contest the workshop for a split second walk out so the attack fails, fast travel to you, and instantly kill you. And you can't stop me, because by leaving the workshop take over mission I am not in pvp mode anymore, so if you shoot me it does no meaningful damage. But whether you shoot me or not doesn't matter, I can walk up with my bloodied super sledge and one shot you. The attacker can see where you are, and has all the power in the world.
---
The only way for the workshop's original owner to take themselves out of pvp mode is to commit suicide or jump servers, The attacker can wait, and can kill you an hour or more later, it doesn't matter how long, or where you go. If you are in a crafting menu you won't even receive the message that you are now free game to be mindlessly murdered, in adventure mode.
---
Workshops are actually safer to conquer in survival mode, because people can't hunt you down on the map, and the only time you are at any sort of risk is if people fast travel to the defense event, which they can do on adventure mode anyways, and even if they do you get equal opportunity to shoot them first, whereas on adventure mode you are completely helpless because the attacker isn't in pvp mode until they hit you first, and it's not hard to make it so you only need one hit.
---
This is an exploit, a bug, an oversight, call it whatever you like, It is not how the game is supposed to work.
---
The 1s of invis is from escape artist. Not sure why your chest disappeared though.
---
I'd love to be able to filter by stuff added in patches for easy reference to new stuff.
---
Jebus they *are* BIG! I haven't seen one personally yet
---
You have to gear up for the area.. Fighting ghouls throw on all the 15% ghoul armor. Or find the +3 stat boosting pieces. Me. My go to gun is 2* combat shotgun with exploding rounds and a beingbsmart with those perk cards.
---
Does the real thing have any special loot?
---
Idk , what do you have? :D
---
There is the achievement, but I care more about the atoms. It's not a difficult challenge to do either, except for the fact that The Woopsies is ridiculously rare due to the circumstances of getting it. There's also almost zero information in regards as to how you can even get it (especially on reddit where the closest was a guy getting it while fighting mirelurks, queens, hatchlings, and kings all at once at miraculously got it). Posting it here for everyone on this sub to at least be able to search for it.)
---
I found the body and no camera spawned. Thanks game.
---
Ooh, some how I didn't even see that in the OP. My bad.
---
How would Bethesda benefit from an event being random? It‚Äôs not hard to server hop.
---
What platform, what level ?
---
I have a full set of Unyielding armor, its not killing them that I have an issue with its not getting 2 hit before I get to kill them all lol. Also the +60 Rads when they hit you isnt stupid at all imo.
---
The way they chose to name it is weird. 
---
You found a plan to add pockets to robotic limbs. If you have the robot limbs, you can add pockets under modify. 
---
There are no plans for modified items, but there are plans for modifiers, that you can have without knowing how to make the item. 
---
If you pick up some robot arms (or make them) you'll be able to add pockets.
---
none sadly
---
Been saying this since the perk loadout manager mod came out.  I don't use it, because it isn't vanilla and the updates keep rendering it useless until the mod maker fixes it, but the mod is so awesome.  I hate swapping things out by hand, although I've gotten pretty good about it.  It's just tedious and I've definitely missed out on several kills for experience in the game because I'm swapping cards manually on the fly.  It happened tonight for sure during the sheepsquatch event.  But if they made it part of the game that would be so choice.
---
They are a mod that you can add to existing robot limbs. So for example when interacting with an, armour workbench choose the 'modify' option, then select the armour you want to mod and under 'misc' (I think) you'll get the option to add the pocketed mod.
---
A few questions. What are you on. Ps4 xbox.
---
What's your highest legendary
---
What's your level
---
If youre on ps4 - add me - ill give you some 2* legendary weapons..
---
Yeah I was like wtf
---
Grenadier in Perception is always nice to have with explosive weapons. And even if it is counted as an explosive weapon it should still benefit from other heavy weapon perks like "lock and load" for reload speed, if that is usefull info for you. Havent played the Broadsider myself, so cant give you any kind of specific info on that :(
---
Xbox, my weapon and all my armor is level 50, given im trying to farm for the near mythical BOS Combat Armor plans and one of my legs is leather cause I cant find another Unyielding Combat Leg to save my life...literally and im level 127. Also I have 405 energy resist and still laser turrets and robots eat my ass. I just think this game's damage scaling is kinda f\*\*ked tbh.
---
You have to make sure you place both the configuration folder and the ChatMod.ba2 in the data folder and then to open up the text chat once your fully in the game press the character '.
---
Pick someone on your friends list, join their server, find a container and drop what you want to transfer. Switch characters and join the same person again. Your stuff should still be in the same spot.
---
Worked for me at least.
---
But keep in mind that your contents can be taken by others while rejoining.
---
For Nuka Tapper you basically have to bartend each isle, and depending on the situation prioritizing certain tasks like serving people first, then cleaning up after them and making sure everything is tidy and clean and everybody is served
---
It is screwed up.  I can tear 4 scorched beasts a new one in 3 minutes and their scorched minions. But a fucking turret can tear me up.
---
I suggest continually checking the vendor in WS and maybe you'll find something high that someone ditched
---
Join on me - idezarc she's currently at the mothman statue
---
Keep in mind, doubling damage more than doubles how much damage you do.
---
The armor formula is wonk like dat.
---
Your instigating hit also effectively reduces armor by half, so you basically get double damage +50% armor piercing on the first shot
---
I've seen that happen, too. Once the body went invisible the loot did, too.
---
Laser Turrets do too much fuckin damage and robots with lasers. Like nerf lasers am I right? Also like level 10 Super Mutants can kill me which makes no god damn sense but whatever lol.
---
This is actually really cool. I'd go adventuring with him through an Australian post apocalyptic world any time!
---
No, you need two people. I would get a very trusted friend to transfer.
---
I believe the critical tipping point is 80 dr, or about as much as a power armor frame by itself, and &gt;160 dr cuts your damage in half.
---
It's pretty tragic on anything that isn't a pure sniper weapon.
---
I'm on PC and to me it's laughably easy, but mainly I just shoot centremass, if you don't hit the wings you probably hit the head, which reduces/removes the infernal screeching.
---
BE careful, if someone's in the area they can take it, if no ones in the area the container can reset. It worked for me the first 3 times, the fourth it failed &amp; I lost everything
---
Git gud.
---
Just gotta get good. Lol I can clear a server with my handmade
---
what do you mean" get good" i got oneshot by a explosive minigun, while my sniper rifle didnt do shit.
---
I suggest maxing out nearly all shotgun cards - exept scattershot, that one is trash -  for ranged enemies build up the rifle build and iglf you use exploding weapons use demo expert and bloody mess.. That's my setup.
---
Thanks but I found the body and after a few logs back onto the same server (with a friend), determined that the camera does not respawn. It's going to get reported to Bethesda.
---
&gt; what do you mean" get good" i got oneshot by a explosive minigun, while my sniper rifle didnt do shit.
---
how? by getting a better weapon? that doesnt affect my skill at all
---
That sucks man :(
---
If you have a question about something, please put the question **in the title**. Reddit does not make it possible to edit titles, so you will have to post again with a LONGER, MORE DESCRIPTIVE TITLE. Once again, MAKE A TITLE WHICH IS LONGER AND MORE DESCRIPTIVE.

Yeah Grenadier is a must. Wasn‚Äôt sure if lock and load or even bear arms would still effect it.  I just It 30 with the build which opened up heavy gun 1 and nothing. So checked Reddit to see if there was a explanation and behold there is/was.
---
I could join my world on my 2nd xbox and get you a camera from my body?
---
"TSE", specifically Explosive part, it reduces weapon condition per shot at very high rate
---
Tactics. If you‚Äôre sniping he shouldn‚Äôt even be able to hit you or even see you. And clearly your armour isn‚Äôt any good either.
---
Easy. Second account, run two instances parallel, one at low resolution and setting's.
---
I joined Reddit because of Fo76. Now I don't really play Fo76 anymore, but.. I can't leave Reddit..! I'm stuck. I can't get out of here! Help! Someone contact !#(Y#())!Y#!#¬ß¬ß"#¬§% . . .
---
Sorry about that. Keyboard went weird on me. I love it here on Reddit. I never want to leave.
---
This is good
---
Ty, man I got s ton of this stuff that I didn't even know about. Thought it was funny I'm lvl 232 but didn't have a single piece, turned out I just can't read
---
But just because you suck at it doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs a pointless game mode. People like you are why everything gets handed to you in the game now.
---
"Built in view of the band" is what I hear, meaning he plays next to the band so he always gets to see them.
---
Special meat, fur, skull, quills a legendary and a whole bunch of new plans for 3 new melee weapons.
---
Doesn't work
---
Thing is I have kinda committed to the melee life so cant really just start using guns...plus I find guns boring tbh
---
I'm also on PC and mainly an FPS player. I almost always hit their head or center mass out of instinct, but I use heavy weapons so they don't really get crippled like that.
---
Or it might be your perk build. Used to play with my TSE Gauss which is not that expensive to trade. Was able to 1-2 shot people with it. Now I'm just wrecking the server with my automatic BE handmade.
---
This is great! Thanks for sharing.
---
pc or console? did you rename your armor?
---
Combat wise I‚Äôm going to be using light melee weapons and I‚Äôll be using a rifle of sorts and a shotgun nothing else really. Armor wise I‚Äôll be trying to get marine armor. I don‚Äôt really know where I want to go other than that, making everything as light as possible and making rads and hunger / thirst almost obsolete would be great.
---
Perk wise I want to mostly work on armor and weapon crafting and modding, collecting lots of resources, I like to work heavily on luck and charisma for the XP and support it gives. I would like to work on vats and AP quite a bit. 
---
I don‚Äôt really want to work on heavy guns as I‚Äôm not a massive fan of carrying a gun that weighs 30lb other than in a dire situation. Power Armor would more be a hardly used item for me other than in the instance a bomb is dropped or late game. Don‚Äôt really want to work on stealth because that‚Äôs more of a battle tactic for me than a build I‚Äôd focus on. Mostly my build would be around scavenging and crafting things so I can trade to others and vendors. 
---
Hope this helps in any way
---
I'll be honest with you, I haven't seen very many radium rifles going up for sale specifically. Despite it constantly being brought up as a great answer when going against bloodied builds, they aren't really in high demand. In attempting to answer your question, I would break it down like this:
---
Max Level: It's got that going for it, most people want max level items, some will only be willing to trade for any item if its max level
---
Instigating: A good PvE legendary effect, stealth sniper builds in particular love it.
---
Radium Rifle:....eh. As I said, not super sought offer. Most rifle builds are looking for either a handmade or a lever action.
---
Given the over inflation of the PC market, I'd say you could maybe expect 200 caps for it, if that. It could be more valuable to someone attempting to RP a Child of Atom, but that's likely about it.
---
I recommend checking out r/market76 if you want to really get into trading gear, the people over there would also be able to give you a better idea of it's worth.
---
power armor or radiation suit would plus rad-x will give you enough time to grab the plan
---
Most vendors will buy chems unless they changed it??
---
Make sure you're using the right perk cards as well. Blocker (in Strength - 45% less damage received from melee attacks), Lone Wanderer ( Charisma - 20% less damage when not in a team) and Serendipity (Luck - 45% chance to avoid damage while under 30% health) are a few for regular armor builds (Emergency Protocols mod is a must for power armor users with Bloodied builds).
---
Idk why they‚Äôre not more scared of raiders top light since it‚Äôs getting 500 ms from what I heard.
---
Haha no worries. They aren‚Äôt great at explaining all the nuances of their systems
---
hahah that one hit the spot
---
XB1
---
Hard out man so bull shit I've tried twice now keep failing on Xbox
---
Thank you this has helped a big ton, I‚Äôll play around on the website and I‚Äôd dare say I‚Äôll play as commando.
---
The one thing I‚Äôm confused about is perk cards. You got 7 unused perk card slots. Does this increase if your 15 (at max) slots are full under your special or are you stuck with those unused cards forever. Plus there are some I absolutely don‚Äôt want, is there any way to get rid of them or overwrite them?
---
I just went to the area and it started for me.
---
By restricting the supply of free atoms while releasing new content in the atom store they theoretically increase atom purchases. and server hopping takes time and is a really shitty way to gate content in the game, which casuals don't have.
---
Gave me a marker to the robot to loot the thing to herd the Brahmin
---
See my issue with having blocker on is I would have to remove one of my Slugger/Gladiator cards (I switch them depending on which weapon type im using) and I dont wanna get rid of Incisor.
---
Ah! Where‚Äôd ya go? I know it can spawn in several places.
---
Do the SHEEPSQUATCH event man lol sheet impossible
---
Fortunately I was still able to loot it.
---
Think it‚Äôs intentional
---
Southern belle hotel or whatever it‚Äôs called
---
I am on PS4 but I doubt it Matters
---
Thank you and I‚Äôm fine to pair up with anyone. The more diverse the better cause you can learn from them. Like I joined someone today and they had Power Armor but I‚Äôm betting that they had the perk card that allows you to keep a mutation (which I want the perk) and they could jump really high.
---
Then finding those +3 Unyielding is the way to go and using the instigating weapons. I use the instigating fire axe and it one hit kills all ghouls
---
Thank ya! I‚Äôll try it, hopefully it works
---
Wait.That is so cool!Can you get banned for using that mod tho?
---
Must be verdant season in that region
---
Been using it for months. It's pretty popular and there are no reports of bans.
---
One tip I found handy to know. Its better to have 1 rank in say rifleman, expert rifleman and master rifleman because they stack rather than 3 ranks in just 1 of them.
---
I had a fucking 10cap wanted and when i got killed it "reset" everything and all enemies were hostile again. It was freaking cool to walk up to all the damn enemies without them attacking me
---
The Super mutants would just say "go away bleeder"
---
Update: had to go, only one other person showed up
---
I saw that too. Maybe with that much time I might get some Atom Caps.
---
Ha! Knew it! ;) Good on ya my friend, happy for you.
---
try investing in bolstering armor, it‚Äôll hike you up w DR
---
Why would it be intentional? It's supposed to count down from 7 days.
---
Well, yeah. You can't have it all :) You need to give up some of that damage output, if you don't want to be a glass cannon. Maybe there will be ways to improve on this when the legendary players system comes around, and whatever new perks that will give us.
---
Might explain why my shotgun is now only doing 920 instead of 1160 when i'm at 19%
---
I have all unyielding armor on for the extra strength cause it works well with a bloodied build cause of the fact im always low hp.
---
I agree with this, but reckon you've never had a team try and farm you for caps when you were no where near your workshop. 
---
As in, one guy, the spotter, finds you on map and travels to you, appears friendly (he may be accompanied by another, trader dude who gets you into trade screen) while second guy, contestor, begins to contest your workshop. Second guy ganks you as soon as the first says the contestation is on. Then they stop contesting, and the workshop reverts back to you. 
---
If you aren't wise to the game you respawn. They get eyes on you and guy contests again. You die again. They stop contesting. Over and over until you stop respawning. 
---
Because these are the guys with the sentinel assassin's setups and the bloodied explosive lever action rifles or whatnot and they need caps to get that next piece of sweet gear for their third alt. And they think it's funny. I know several of these dudes, and I'm not kidding. So if people want to gripe about it, I got no beef.
---
Or if damage scaling ever actually makes sense in this game, like I can 2 shot a scorchbeast and take like no damage but a level 62 ghoul in the Burrows 2 shots me and gives me 60 Rads a hit...the rads are a bit excessive imo.
---
Stop spaming the "tame" function mate lol
---
This must be both funny and annoying roaming around
---
 The problem you have, and everyone who wants to use it, is that although its classified as as Explosive Weapon its ammo is all Ballistic. 
---
 They may fix that eventually but now its a useless thing.
---
Ohh what the fuck that's messed up man are u on Xbox? because I need someone to help me
---
There are 2 codes in the bunker. Can not tell you what terminals they are on. It is said that the code had to be changed. And there you get a 6-digit code
---
do you really think i went melee with my sniper rifle? do you even play this game? he probably saw me because he used vats, might even have killed me with it.
---
I enjoy hybrid anmo and guns. Adds to the gameplay. Not everything has to clear cut.
---
It started when I went to Big Fred's Bbq Shack when I was doing the raider's quest.
---
I hope they're aware, legendary spawns have been disappearing since beta lol
---
I sell chems in the bunker.
---
False.
---
Recipes and plans can't be sold in game. Chems and healing items can be sold to any vendor.
---
I wish. Im trying to recreate those circumstances.. I literally killed 5 freaking scorched by fissure prime with 4 minutes and then all the enemies just went passive. 
---
I'm hoping someone else pulls it off.
---
try 748250
---
I was there 6 times and had nothing to shoot at and then i joined this one, where was only one other guy and we were attacked by whole server of mobs. Brahmins died super fast haha. Atleast i got two useless 2* items :D
---
Renamed excavator armour. Used it to fast travel home, placed in inventory. Dropped off stuff in stash, jumped back in power armour and 2 pieces missing.
---
My favourite Junkies explosive shotgun, renamed sitting in inventory, just vanished. 
---
I always double check all my corpses before I leave an area as legendaries sometimes take a few seconds to spawn on body. Always check inventory after selling anything to make sure I never accidentally sell any of my 2 favourite guns even though marked as favourite.
---
Shit just vanishing and lack of Bethesda response is pathetic.
---
100% certain this is a bug from renaming items.
---
Can I recommend that if someone is jumping up and down and gesturing. They have probably found it. 
---
I did this yesterday, when it was a stealth pile and people just ignored me ü§∑ü§∑
---
Bit like when I am trying to lead them to blue suitcases üòÇüòÇ
---
There could be a dedicated spawn there becouse ran into the exact same thing except i managed to escape
---
 Have you ever tried to hurt something with it? I have and sold the 3* Quad Legendary I took from an angry Cricket, to Wallace, as I was unable to.
---
This quest is bugged for some people. He should try restarting the app, and if that doesn't give him the quest back he probably needs to submit a ticket to Bethesda. You really should be able to do it all together.
---
Yeah, plenty of things that could be improved. As a bloodied build, sometimes I kill myself just by switching perk cards. Class Freak, which reduces negative effects of mutations, can do that. One of the mutations gives -50HP, so it's -12 with Class Freak on. When I take it off to put something else on temporarily, it drops my health by those additional 38 points (I assume it's by that much, haven't tested it). Killed myself a couple of times by doing this.
---
I horde so much ammo....I usually dump it in the trash bins at whitespring
---
It‚Äôs random... I was soloing and got 3 wolves, one bloodbug, and.... 5 Yao guai... thank atom like 6 people showed up before I got obliterated
---
Enough is enough. Game deleted. Unsubbing. Fuck this.
---
Yes I have. I hit 25 yesterday morning and been using it all day. I‚Äôm not bothered by the ability to kill or or lack thereof. This is a team support build so dps is not my primary concern but rather the opposite.
---
LOL, cant say ive done that but I just think ghouls do too much damage like I tanked like 5 projectiles from a scorchbeast but I Ghoul 2 hits me like wut.
---
Use a switch it should stop it from going off when you fast travel in
---
Their decision to not include a text chat is just mind boggling... I feel I'm missing alot of the game due to not being able to communicate with others. No setting up groups for events, asking help for quests... what a fuck.
---
Pretty!
---
Wow nice psa. I‚Äôve also noticed that it‚Äôs client side, where the body ends up after exploding. A couple players were doing the confused emote, and about 5 different other players were all teabagging and shooting a different location each because that‚Äôs where it was for them. For me it was probably underground, because I couldn‚Äôt loot anything and then a couple minutes later, the scrap pile popped up right where I‚Äôd already checked.
---
Thanks good to know it was not just me, trust me to start with the bugged one.
---
Cheers, thanks for the feedback
---
There was a game with obscure math and extreme PvP, called FOnline. It was an online mashup of F1 and F2. I've been nicknamed imprezobus there, eleven years ago.
---
My main expectation for F76 was that it'd be a very sophisticated PvP environment where knowledge and map awareness meant everything. They delivered.
---
I'm kinda community organiser. I'm open to "cease fire" voice communicates, and to dispute math with people who I've been hunting last 20 minutes. I put around 300 hours purely into weapon and builds research. I run with two accounts, have 9 characters, and tend to shoot myself in the face because of multi-screen-schisophrenia xD. I also traded heavily until I reached the point of "one of each" - there is no viable armor set and no viable weapon archetype I don't have in my inventory. I'm also a professional and awarded software tester. This all build the foundation upon which my in-game research is being performed - I can pretty much define the build of my enemy, dress them appropriately, and check out what happens when I shoot em, because its also myself I'm shooting. I also have assistance of several people in this testing if I need it. I have 10 people running with weapons I borrowed them, asking them to provide tactical reports of the results. Last time we found obscure consequence of some mechanic was yesterday, and I received the info being on vacations xD
---
We built PvP viable pre-survival PA build. It sucked when they boosted auto rifles in survival release, but I think we now come up with something that could create PvP dominator thats PA based. We'll publish if we deem it true.
---
Uh .. that explains pretty much everything. I wondered why the other players didn't come and were still searching.
---
Do these sell for much?
---
Yeah, corpses are definitely client side. I have a mate i play always with and we confirmed that multiple times.
---
Automaton used both sticks one to move the other to shoot
---
Are you trolling?
---
What buttons do what?
---
 Weapons that don't hurt things get sold to a bot. 
---
 I play solo and have an Explosive build. My Auto Grenade Launcher is a toy but a moderately effective one, and is very amusing.
---
 You need One Gun Army in Luck for several reasons. 
---
 My Armor is effectively immune to Explosive Damage and I can just fire my AGL at the ground at my feet for my Grenade Melee trick, which is surprisingly effective. A Legendary bot Explosion takes 20% of my Health, about the same as a car. ;)
---
 The Cannon is a joke but its your game. ;)
---
Thanks for that, lately this is a frustrating problem with all that is going on and all the explosions it is easy to miss where it drops especially when it turns invisible, I have done the confused emote a few times myself because I just can't find it, Thanks Bethesda!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!.
---
I would say almost like how call of duty has a "create a class" this would be nice to have "create a build". Want to do a lot of crafting? Just select that build from your list and swap out quicker.
---
That‚Äôs the best name for a disease so far. I wish it was more common. Thanks for the info, I‚Äôve also been at 21/22 for a while now.
---
Remember it explodes by itself, because it‚Äôs a legendary robot, when it dies. That‚Äôs no one‚Äôs fault.
---
It seems to be client side. I‚Äôve done the same thing and people came but couldn‚Äôt find it, then they found it somewhere else.
---
Why would I?
---
...
---
*kapow*
---
Because you seem badly informed..
---
Great video, been looking for this damn one for ages, will try it out.
---
Vats crit from level 50 fixer is valid tool to kill anyone, assassin sentinel mofos included.
---
Synergise your build with your weapons and your playstyle. Don't be seen.
---
Few corrections:
---
**Anti-armor vs Two shot**: [it depends](https://akarnokd.github.io/rng-76/weapons.html). An unmodded Handmade with Two shot does 4% more effective damage than AA. A Hardened Handmade with Two shot does 1% less effective damage. A versus Hardened Handmade does 10% more damage than Hardened AA.
---
**Anti-armor stacking**: it is a remainder-multiplication formula. For example, you have a 20% ignore, 40% ignore and 75% ignore, the calculation works with what armor is remaining at each step:
---
100 DR \* (100 - 20)% = 100 DR \* 80% = 80 DR
---
80 DR \* (100 - 40)% = 80 DR \* 60% = 48 DR
---
48 DR \* (100 - 75)% = 48 DR \* 25% = 12 DR
---
Total armor ignored: 100 - 100 / 12 = 91.66%
---
Since they are multiplicative, it doesn't matter what order they get applied. In addition, the damage formula is capped ad 99% input damage, so if your weapon does 100 damage and you reduced the enemy armor to 1DR, it will do at most 99 damage, never the full 100 damage. Also I've seen unconfirmed rumors that the anti-armor stacking is capped at 95%. You could surpass it with an AA (50%) Puncturing (40%) melee weapon with Incisor (75%) and Exterminator (75%) when attacking bugs and mirelurks =&gt; 98.13% armor ignored.
---
**90% reduced weight**: Only affects the unmodded weapon weight. Each mods still adds full of its weight.
---
**Double &amp; Quad**: Only affects the unmodded base ammo capacity. A Quad Handmade with Drum magazine has 20 (base) \* 4 + 65 (drum) = 145 ammo. I haven't actually verified this, but if a magazine goes below, this still works, so a 10 round Perforating Magazine quadded will give you 80 ammo still.
---
Bye!
---
Yep, happened to me today. Finally was able to use my card. Same situation, mayhem.... then 'infinite loading screen.' That was it. No card returned to my inventory, no completed event or failed event. 
---
Nothing.
---
Fuck me Bethesda, please fix this kind of thing.
---
Didnt you post this like week ago i swear to god, the exact same thing
---
There's a pretty obvious difference between TSE and robot explosions though.
---
I disagree, some of their location data I'd quite a bit off.
---
 There are two ways. You can buy plans from vendors all over the map and you can get plans as a reward for completing events.
---
A good idea. Like in Mass Effect Andromeda with the profiles, "SAM, sorry, Vault Boy, switch from Stealth build to MaxBoom build."
---
Legendary farming locations listed would be my biggest request. Information is so scattered on that, everyone has different opinions.
---
that comment under the photo
---
If you enter vats range you gotta vats. If you don't want to be vatsed, stay half a kilometer away.
---
Yes. I would like to be to have all SPECIAL to 10, at least.
---
Check the updated
---
Essentially I‚Äôve been making sure I have level one perks for the legendary player thing lately but I did explore to find what perks I felt could work or even interchange I changed a couple points around and now I‚Äôm just trying to experiment
---
Thank you, but I'm more wanting to know the best places or events
---
Agreed, especially since the UI is dodgey and often jumps to sell your fucking legendary gear rather than the 10 Plasma grenades you selected.
---
What an awesome post!
---
I wish try would triple it on the last day üòäüëç I went from 130 to lvl 145 pretty quickly earlier..
---
sorry i meant the plans the other i though was obvious
---
I misread it to be honest. I stupidly thought you meant can't sell chems. I then tried to change it in case you replied calling out my stupidity.
---
It‚Äôs prox chat so if someone is in game chat they‚Äôll hear you if in the area. If they‚Äôre in a third party chat app they won‚Äôt hear you, such as discord, Skype. Or on console Xbox party chat or psn party chat
---
I drop legendaries all the time. I can‚Äôt scrap them and the vendor will only give me 100 caps so they are virtually worthless. What‚Äôs the point in trading them to other players? It takes a while to set up a trade and I still don‚Äôt need the caps or really anything else they‚Äôd have to offer. After a run through white spring I‚Äôll drop about ten 1-2* legendaries.
---
If I see a bag with cool stuff in it and no ones nearby on the map then I take what I want lol
---
Wow!!! THANK YOU!!!
---
&gt;do you even play this game?
---
Based on the  crap I read here, I seriously believe the answer is no.  I'm serious.   What other explanation is there?  
---
The few threads that raise legit issues get down voted and get a lot of snarky comments.  
---
But there's countless threads where people raise hell about peripheral shit that doesn't negatively impact anyone's game play . Like the repair kit thing. That kind of shit gets  get thousands of up votes.  If you are seriously worried more about repair kits than the brokenness of PVP then I seriously doubt you even play the game.
---
Yeah that‚Äôs what I was doing some levels ago, I moved some points so I can go shotgun or rifles (I might not be 100% optimized compared to some, but can hold my own against any enemies or PvP) unlocked and/or maxed most cards. Now I‚Äôm a bit lost and don‚Äôt want to go crazy experimental incase I totally screw it up
---
If its in a bag someone purposefully dropped it.  Prob BC they had even better stuff.
---
If I remember correctly it‚Äôs just the x or a button and the stick, each item is activated by the same button. Not much to it really once you keep at it
---
Wats the legendary player thing??
---
A lot of the time, high level players go and farm legendaries and drop the ones that aren't so valuable to them at which point, they become free for the taking. Some high-levels like to drop stuff on purpose for low-levels to stumble upon, as well. No worries. ‚ô°
---
Now for instigating, if attacking another player with even a smidge of rads on them even though their health is full up to those rads does the effect work or only when the health is 100% and not affected by rads thus making it only effective for PVE?
---
Did it have a TSE Max lvl combat rifle - he he. Can take it off your hands?
---
I don‚Äôt know if that‚Äôs what they called it but it‚Äôs something about players over 100 resetting? Not exactly sure what happens so saving levels incase I might need them üòÖ haha
---
Supposed to be in June I think
---
Level 38 from beta? You don't play very often then?
---
I suggest leveling up to 50 then build a stealth build. Find a good knife.
---
I get that all the time lately
---
Ya most were
---
 Watoga, Harper's Ferry and some of the Raider Vendors have the best stuff. However a lot of good stuff drops in Grafton and at various Stations. Mostly the tougher the area the better the stuff, including plans. 
---
 Then there's The Whitespring and the Enclave that have many plans no one else has.
---
 I used to farm. Its changed and will keep changing, and you will have gain the knowledge yourself if you seriously want the best.
---
Yeah I either don‚Äôt play a lot or most of the time I‚Äôve spent working on my camp. I started playing with a close friend cause we both wanted to play it together cause we loved fallout 4 but I feel a little held back because he wants to play together and advance together (I do too) but he says he wants to go at his own pace whereas I‚Äôm starting to feel bothered by how long it‚Äôs taking to advance
---
Ts  gating gun but no tse I'd be all over that
---
Farm it by oppening my eyes !
---
Hmm.Can you help me like configure it?Accept my private chat reuqest pls.
---
Thanks for making me not feel like a thief.
---
 I won't deal with someone I can't talk to myself. I may be uncommon though as nearly everyone I meet is turned off.
---
 Its for you. ;) 
---
 I drop em' too, some are not worth hauling any distance and a bag full gets rid of em' .
---
Right just making sure you knew. Some people don‚Äôt know that legendary robots explode on death every time.
---
Ok that‚Äôs better :)
---
Nothing cleanses body and soul faster than having your entrails splashed over the pavement I guess.
---
Seriously, it'd be nice to have a perk card that let's you stay addicted but maybe gives you a small buff as a trade off.
---
"Junkies Fortitude: While equipped, all addictions are permanent, addiction chance is increased. While under the active effect of chems, +2 endurance" Something like that maybe. First thing that came to mind. Could be fine tuned, obviously.
---
Not gonna lie I used to have no chat til I met a legit trader.
---
Thank you kind person
---
Yes, it would be 2*
---
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1L5c8ZKCCf4OaNglGc516dl9AFxYWnMUDuhQbHjrlQkQ/htmlview#
---
With as many levels as you have you can experiment a little bit by bit and see how it feels if you don‚Äôt like it you can change back
---
So is discord as good on ps4 or do u have to have a setup on pc for discord
---
Have a feeling you just take a work shop
---
Really? I haven‚Äôt done that yet üôà thank you so much. Been hunting for them for ages!
---
Take any workshop and that will all be unlocked. You can get alot of plans from taking and defending workshops.
---
I‚Äôd say the ps4 chat is better, as it‚Äôs a built in feature. However since you‚Äôre planning on selling, just stay in game chat it shows you‚Äôre speaking so players will come into game chat to see what you‚Äôre on about.
---
I know a bunch unlock when you take a work shop
---
there is a nexus mid for that. you still have to go into the perk menu, but i. was more then happy to only do that
---
didn't beth say that if you lost your camera after completing bucket list you could buy a new one from vendors?
---
You have to read it first if you didn't know its under notes tab
---
to be fair bethesda haven't made a statement about mods and it's quite clear in their ToS for the game that modified content is not OK. so where do they draw the line?
---
it's probably unlikely they'll ban anyone over it, but more conservative people might want to wait with installing any mods.
---
Not that I'm aware of. I hope that changes as I'd love to be a wasteland Rambo.
---
A quad explosive would be so fun
---
Only time when I 1 shot stuff is when I'm solo or no one is close by.
---
Unfortunately Nexos mods don‚Äôt apply to Xbox.
---
Bye! Have a wonderful time!
---
Haha Jesus Christ.
---
People buying maps are like people who buy 'Prime Junk' on Warframe. They're getting massive returns and hoping no one realises they're being ripped off.
---
What is the official state of using addons in FO76? Is it legal?
---
I used to drop all my 1* and most 2** unwanted Legendary crap in the river behind my camp. But more recently now that I‚Äôve been kind of mentoring some n00b players, I‚Äôve been either dropping the stuff on the floor around Artisan‚Äôs Corner in Whitesprings or I transfer all of them into the register by the front counter. Much like the cigarette machines, the registers have huge capacities.
---
What I would like to see from the developers is the Perks change seamlessly with your selection of weapon or your activity. Select a Melee weapon, your selected Melee Perks automatically activate. Select Ranged, your selected Ranged Perks automatically activate, same with if you are solo or on a team or you pick a lock, all your pre-selected Perks for that activity activate. But I not sure the developers want us to play that way.
---
When will ppl learn not to use the therm "PSA" for posts like this.
---
Yep it has been mentioned ... should be able to to it in that time. Some challenges now are so obscure you may need it!
---
I‚Äôm sure Bethesda is itching to make money via the atom store, and I‚Äôm relatively content in paying for cosmetic stuff on there. But I don‚Äôt think that the camera challenges were purposefully left in the game when the camera content was delayed for a week or so, just to get people to purchase atoms. They could just as easily flood the atom store with items, which they haven‚Äôt done.
---
Nah man, don't feel bad. I always drop my extra 1 star legendaries. And used to even drop unwanted 2-3 stars before the announcement of the legendary vendor. I would be very happy to know that someone picked them up and got use out of them rather than them eventually disappearing from existence
---
Yeah true, guess it‚Äôs time to buy some new weapons to try out too haha :)
---
Alright thanks
---
While we're at it, has anyone ever seen explosive vents trigger or am I going mad? Thought they'd be hilarious with my jet pack but I've never observed them do anything.
---
Msn's treasure. Lol
---
Snag a workshop. There is a food factory just over the river to the West of Flat woods that's easy to grab and maintain if you're super early game.
---
THANK YOU! you are doing God's work!
---
Finders keepers. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
The camera has to register what‚Äôs in front of you for it to count towards the challenges. So only take a picture if at the top right of the screen it tells you what‚Äôs there
---
I‚Äôve had both the infinite loading screen, and the infinite respawn, just a camera circling my dead body at the event. That one is extra salty.
---
Overall stability has improved dramatically over the months, but not getting to finish this event definitely hurt each time.
---
10: could we scrap ammo? Maybe for 30% of the material? For example: making 20 of ammo X costs 15 gunpowder, 6 steel and 15 lead. Scrapping 20 of them would give us 5 gunpowder, 2 steel and 5 lead?
---
I can‚Äôt sell it, so being able to do at least something with I would help. The ratios would need to be worked out so that it doesn‚Äôt become a problem (not sure how it would - you can only fire one bullet at a time after all) but... yeah.
---
While enjoying Oxhorn's many FO76 videos he constantly staggered and killed scorched and others in his PA using Pain Train, there must be something wrong with your setup?
---
I had passed it to a new account I made but once I had outleveled it I sold it to a vendor not understanding how good the effects were until I tried making a solid build üò∞
---
Wholesome, glad you managed to escape reality if only for a little while
---
Escape Artist? "running no longer affects stealth"
---
Things I've still encountered after 8.5:
---
**Bug**. The Dragon has a lot of bullets loaded when switching to it. Looks like it is capped at 24 because once it happened with 100+ bullets still in my inventory. Reported pre-patch to Beth.
---
**Bug**. Black Powder weapon instant reload. Reported pre-patch to Beth.
---
**Bug**. Craft-scrap loop, get 1 extra Steel. With SD, I can get 130 free Steel for 100 items crafted and 130 scrapped in about 5-10 minutes. Reported some time ago to Beth.
---
**Bug?** The cows at the Free Range event won't move if I'm alone initially. Also one of them tends to go off path making them herding across the ledge towards the Beckwith Farm complicated. 
---
**Bug**. During the Free Range event towards the Beckwith Farm, the game may warn you about leaving the event area if the cows are too spread around or simply if you have them next to you but got too far away from the initial event location marker. Usually it fixes itself after a bit.
---
**Bug**. The camera emote sliding. If you get high places end do the swap, you can end up out-of-bounds, end up with [infinite loading screen](https://youtu.be/LY3tJpaRU-I), dying, throwing you and then [teleporting you back to the start location](https://youtu.be/wmobAxJdLa0?t=84). Also it appears the force is always pushing the character to the left so I could aim the camera slide relatively well.
---
**Change?** My weapons now seem to lose condition when a melee enemy hits me. I lost 120% condition while fighting a bunch of melee Super Mutants and shooting maybe 90 rounds total (1\* Hardened lvl 45 Mutant slayer's Handmade).
---
**Remark on Fusion Cores**: I have *Power User* and *Batteries Included*, I don't do VATS but sprint a lot in my Excavator PA. I've been slowly accumulating fusion cores over the weeks as they drain pretty slowly and I can't refrain myself from picking them up.
---
**Performance**. My audio-related hiccups got worse with P8.5, I'm now getting 2-5 second freezes before an audio effect plays. The game loop doesn't stop so I died a few times because of this frozen period. The game frequently runs with 14-15GB memory usage (out of 16GB total) and could be related to Windows memory swapping, the game reparsing audio package files, or the network message loop entering into a spin-wait loop  (as I see 100% CPU usage spike on my i7 4790 CPU) till the server gives the okay sign to play an audio? Reported to Beth a couple of times. For comparison, I have a i7 8700 and 32GB where these types of hiccups started to become noticeable too (0.2 - 0.5 seconds). Both machines are on a network with 100+ MBit down and 22+ MBit up.
---
**Legendary chances**: 3\* dropping 3\* loot is down since Patch 8 from 40% to 20% for me. This is not the overall chance of getting 3\*, but when you actually find a 3\* enemy and it drops 45% 1\*, 35% 2\* and 20% 3\* for me. 2\* dropping 2\* is down from 55% to 45%. Sample size: 450 drops since P8. Nerfing for the upcoming Legendary Vendor token system? I only have 50 drops since P8.5 so no conclusive evaluation for that period yet.
---
don't know about pain train but I just tested emergency protocols by standing still while a glowing mole miner hacked away at me.
---
he'd hit for 6 damage up until I hit 20% hp, then he started hitting for 2~3. so I guess it's just a visual bug.
---
Aw, no pics? Share the love man :( Anyways - nice stuff :)
---
Enjoy the abundance! Of Liberators!
---
Patrol duty at the prison and monster mash in watoga gave me some weapon plans
---
I have it in a generic build and it has saved me so many times.
---
\^this, sometimes (especially when they dont have a weapon themself) legendary enemies drop the gun they are supposed to drop like it was their used gun.
---
Question: are there any unexpected quirks to the Quad pump-action, single-action, or lever-action guns? I've got a Quad Crossbow, and while it can load three extra shots and fire each off without reloading, I still have to load each shot separately.
---
They both look pretty stiff to me....
---
how's your experience after buying it?
---
actually bethesda should implement a legit deck manager rather than bloking the existing modded one.
---
It's a different game when you use this, and it's a better game, by far.
---
the trapper / marine / robot armor all boost radiation if I remember correctly 
---
really what we need is something like fallout tactics environmental armor that was kind of like a sealed suit of combat armor over a radiation suit
---
hmm maybe its a bug at the level 1 pain train perk... because i didnt want to use more points on it
---
does he have pain train at a higher level?
---
Well, there used to be 7 different factions that had their own 200 cap limits. So you‚Äôd hit all 7 if you were maximizing your caps per day. You didn‚Äôt have ‚Äúrep‚Äù with them though, but 1 (enclave) is locked behind the main quest.
---
If you combine a couple things (grape mentats, some alcohol, especially with party boy) you can get a hefty bump to your charisma, and the grape sell-boost effect compensates for some missing charisma. I think with grape mentats and hard bargain and some alcohol, you could would be close to max with 3 charisma base. It‚Äôs useful to find some +1 charisma legendaries, or just go all in on a low health build. +15charisma from a full set of Unyielding armor if you are at 20% health.
---
could be ... but when you look it up in your stats it only says ¬¥+25 Speed
---
The line is pretty obvious. Don't get tactical advantages. Perk loadout manager can be used for tactical advantage. It can also be used as QoL only. I'm pretty sure publishing a guide on how to quickswap perks while changing weapons using macros and this mod would get you banned. I also heard the people who used things such as glowing loot bags were getting themselves banned in matter of days. And here I am, fourth month with mods, reported myself to Bethesda (saying 'if you think its unfair let me know and I will remove them, I just love customising the UI'), never using anything for tactical advantage (I want to win, but you only win if its legit, cheaters loose always), not banned at all.
---
Since I made a separate PvP character, I ceased to use perk load manager - its just the switching between crafting perks and fighting perks that was problematic for me, and the PvP toon does not craft.
---
Thanks for coming!
---
Totally lol
---
Looks like you're farming the same area as me.
---
I believe there is a camera spawn at the Teapot that holds the event ‚ÄúTea Time‚Äù.
---
Dead body looks like a typical tourist that holds the camera
---
Had to get up there for a bridge key.
---
My friend told me theres a chance to find them on ghouls or in world as well as buy from vendors but I haven't found any yet.
---
I've been carrying mine around for a month now, frightened i'm going to accidentally eat it one of these days. Got it from the medical supplies place in the very east of the Mire IIRC.
---
Are you on Xbox? I found a multi shot mod for the broadsider that I picked up simply because I‚Äôve never seen one before and think it‚Äôs rare. If you want it let me know
---
I‚Äôm level 100 and still finding new places every now and then
---
I can build You a Shop.
---
That would be much better, if officially would be a solution, for example no exp and loot during event but reward would be more, or every1 can loot everything and got exp doesn't metter u hit or not. But this is a survivor game, the pve must be pvp too, but why?
---
Oh man, we searched and searched. None of us got his drop and it was my first finish after MANY tries. I even stayed in the instance and went back every hour to try searching again...üòû
---
This is fallout not call of duty...
---
He looks like a real good player.  Just what the community needs. We'll done that person üëç
---
Ok calling it a night. Good luck to those still looking.
---
Other than it takes 4 times longer to reload, not that I'm aware of.
---
Server hopping worked for me too. Thanks!
---
I did some calculations a few days ago on this and it turns out you have ca. 11000000 years
---
One way of getting around this would to make each spawn after death a character load-out selection. Kind of like create your own class in call of duty. After every death you have the option to change into a certain preset load-out. 
---
___
---
Outside of combat, add some hotkeys to the favorites wheel to select a load-out quickly. Maybe implement it like the emote UI to use less space or let stimpaks be a users choice to be hotkeyed and replace it with a new easy menu to perks like a ‚Äúchoose your class‚Äù menu, which would be seen upon death as well.
---
Interested, I'm guessing you didn't get a response from Beth on that?
---
I agree 100%, I don't go full on war mode on public events unless is the SBQ.
---
Brother!?
---
That‚Äôs so cool
---
Yep!
---
I failed the event once for similar reasons, but for me, there were complications. Both Sheepsquatches were aggroed on me and my shots were blocked by the brahmins themselves. The time I could reposition (got stunned quite a lot), the brahmin's were dead. I think I have an Explosive Pump-action Shotgun and will try that for the area effect.
---
It can also be based on how high level other players are in the area.
---
I'm a PS4 player too. I have chemist, pharmacist, super duper, team healer etc. If anyone care whip you up some stims (and bucket loads of drugs) It'd be me.
---
I'm out and about today but I could probably lend you a hand tomorrow I suspect.
---
Damn straight. Xbox has no perk manager so its always manual argh it is so time consuming and annoying. Blue printing loadouts for perks would be awesome
---
So you expect to just come back after not playing and be able to compete with people who‚Äôve been pvping on survivor for a month? Your gear , tactics , and skill are probably way behind
---
Are you able to look and see how long the furious affect lasts after hitting an enemy? Like how long before the buff resets your hits?
---
NO WAIT BEFORE YOU GO can I have your caps?
---
The hero we need, but don't deserve. Now I just need to get heat flashes.
---
It's the only reason I joined reddit!
---
THIS!!! for all the bugs and shit post and everything this is what our community is about. Connection. Well done sir/ma'am amazing post.
---
it might be something in the next patch
---
THANK YOU FUCK. No one seems to get this. Yes, griefers are in the game. Yes, people use the workshops on occasion to be an asshole. But, for the love of God, if you don't want to PVP just play in pacifist mode
---
Stims would be appreciated haha in every other fallout game I‚Äôve had so many I‚Äôve never really had to worry in this though I had about 30 and suddenly I have none, so I went on a stim farm expedition in the northern section of the forest and then I went to do another quest before, so now I have none again. Hahaa
---
Edit: totally missed ur a teacher there first read though. Thanks for helping our youth while helping the wasteland.
---
Hi think i oun the alien.I havent got the camara jet but i found a alien head in the house in Lewisburg where you start the new quest wiht the sheep
---
I had been using the machines every time time I passed one and hoped and prayed expecting to never get one, I was struggling on a quest and a random guy came and helped me do several while being super nice and letting me get xp for all the kills and pointing me to every new quest and on one of them I passed a machine and gave it a try and what do you know I got it!!
---
I gave it straight to the helpful person without a second though üëç
---
Does it just increase the damage without any vfx?
---
11000000 Years to complete them but i have completed them already
---
Do you wear a complete set? Wondering if a part or mismatched set isn't counting?
---
Alright. I'll see what I can do when I'm next on. I'll be sure to ping your reddit user name. Feel free to add me. Should the the same as my reddit. Sinisphere.
---
Thanks to chemist and super duper I can make you a lot from a much smaller amount of resources. Particularly if I dilute a few here and there.
---
That's what I'm unsure of. I've landed more or less slap bang on top of people before and not noticed any damage.
---
Yeah. Maybe it's not my ports forwarding then.
---
By chance, did you get an new PC around the time it started? If so, my theory could be sound still
---
Gj genius it‚Äôs what people use to power level, nothing wrong with it, sure it‚Äôs a bit of a exploit but Bethesda know about it
---
I argue it's a bit of both. It's user error, but it's poor design that the user can so easily make such an error.
---
Like if my car had an ejector seat button built right next to the brake. How much of it is my fault if I blast out the roof at a red light?
---
If you think you are exceptionnal because of your build, you missed the point. (And... spoiler: you are not exceptional)
---
We are talking about behavior here, this is what matter.
---
The vertibird thingy is not really a hack...
---
One person repairs the helipad so the vertibird spawns, then everyone else tags it for exp. 
---
Just a way to level up, now why would anyone want to level up that quickly i don't know.
---
I think he was level 1 but cant be sure, would have to search through his vids until I see his perk tree. You could bash some levels into Pain Train maybe get to level 3 then take it once more to give you a level 1 also then play with them, compare them in use.
---
I know it uses levelling points but eventually you can have many perks with multiple card sets of different levels to give build flexibility.
---
What about the Graham? Never seen him not to move when not interacted
---
Is there anything else to read on Reddit? ü§£
---
You in OCE?
---
Another common cause for PC players: if you too go switch perks, you would hit TAB, T.
---
The problem occurs when you accidentally roll over R then T. This quickly drops the item at the top of your inventory, then immediately opens the perks, making you miss your mistake.
---
I have no clue about that one
---
Errrr... Sorry, don't know what that means. üòÖ
---
I power levelled at Whitespring for a bit to sort out my hot mess of a perk tree, but once I sorted things out using up dozens of levels I stopped and now play at a more sedate pace, everyone to their own so long as they don't mess the server or effect other players I suppose.
---
This is important. There are players who don't know about reddit and don't play in teams and don't know the "rule" about sharing. You can usually tell the difference between a-holes who are purposefully taking the kills from people and the ones who think they're saving you because you're not killing the thing lol.
---
Oceania, so basically Australia and New Zealand :)
---
Wow. And I have tried like once and didn't even know that's possible.
---
So you answer like this to everything and everybody that asks something that you already know?
---
Oh! Sorry, English over here. Though I understand the servers are cross region? At least they better be, or that throws a spanner in the works.
---
Have it only be useable whilst sleeping. So people cant hot swap in pvp etc.
---
I did a fast video covering the contents - it was a couple of weeks ago so dont remember just now in my sleep deprived mind what Modern Lonoleum Is but I'll leave you this link if you want to check should nobody else be forthcoming with an answer.
---
https://youtu.be/sglCK84VPNU
---
No just don‚Äôt like snitches, if they wanna lvl up fast let them
---
[https://discord.gg/falloutreddit](https://discord.gg/falloutreddit)
---
I wouldn't mind seeing a Diablo 3 auction house kind of trade thing and the option to see what a single player is selling. Or even seeing what everyone on the server is selling. 
---
But I'm guessing it will be like this. You have to rock up to a players camp to see what they have for sale.
---
Few things to add from my experience:
---
Nocturnal does not work on a spectrum, it is either A or B depending on what time of day it is. I tested this out with my nocturnal explosive gatling plasma at different times of the day. Base damage is 68; at 8:40, it rose to 85. At 11:09, it was 95. Past midnight, it went up to 102 (+50%). At times throughout the day, the lowest it ever dropped to was 44 (-35%)
---
(Sorry if this is what you already said, but it was a bit difficult to understand the section) Vampire's stacks infinitely. I have a vampire's gatling laser and it essentially makes me invincible. There seems to be no limit to how many healing procs you can trigger in a short period of time as long as you keep hitting enemies.
---
Quad works similar to weightless, only affecting base stats and not modded ones, with the exception that you can't fall below the base. My quad handmade has 95 ammo with a stinging magazine (4*20 base, +15 from the magazine). I tried a swift magazine, which has 10 normally, but it still had 80 capacity instead of 10 or 70.
---
Also, would you be able to do some testing with the bunker buster's +20% damage? I don't have anybody to try it with, but launchers seem extremely misleading with their numbers. A two shot missile launcher only gains 1 additional damage point in the pip boy, but even a regular missile launcher with less than 200 damage can one shot you if you shoot it at your feet. Same thing with the bunker buster, it gains only 1 damage point in the pip boy
---
Nmprogue, 
---
I won‚Äôt sell. Only gift. I‚Äôll be on in 30 minutes.
---
Fun times:

---
Just a tip: healing salves can be made early on and can be farmed way easier than stims. While they dont do as good of a job at healing they can be a great way to same stims.
---
For your kindness I will make sure to report this exploit directly to Bethesda support until it gets fixed. Without your rude comments I would have not done that :)
---
Yeah I don‚Äôt think they are, even still I appreciate the thought. I might just have to keep farming stims and hope that no other higher level players have gone through the areas I need to be :/
---
Probably just overloaded a bit because of the constant exploding enemy. Or they could be stuck in some kind of loop because Graham considers the chopper to be an enemy and can't figure out how to attack it.
---
Did u read what I said? They know it happens what do u think their going to do?
---
I dont care but I will make sure that they will know better :)
---
yeah auction house or central market hub would be best but i think thats what we are getting, at least for the moment. it may get an update in future based on player feedback like the single caps pool and all the vendors being in whitesprings
---
Good tip, I‚Äôll go through and find some ingredients.
---
It was datamined
---
While your at it go blow Tom Howard‚Äôs chode and see if he listens to the outrage by the communtiy about repair kids, I don‚Äôt care how many exploits get patched or how many of my accounts get banned I‚Äôm going to keep going until they listen to the community. Won‚Äôt care if it does get banned, would mean they care about us
---
Well, can't hurt to try I suppose. Don't lose anything if it doesn't work. Offer will remain on the table until we figure out if they're cross region or region locked. I've never seen it come up before.
---
The stream by the first town South if you follow the river at from the overseers camp is riddled with one of the main ingredients.
---
Also what can they do? Make it so repairable stuff at camps doesn‚Äôt give XP? That‚Äôd be great I love wasting ammo only to have a veryibird give no reward
---
Wow that escalated quickly! I hope you get your things straight in the future and I wish you a fast recovery.
---
I would agree with you in most areas but if your in a group you want to quickly farm events so there should only be good communication within players
---
God wish u speed and hope that your the first person that Bethesda listen to
---
If it works I‚Äôd be a very happy man :P
---
About 75 round trips to Alpha centauri :)
---
Does it really matter, though? I guess nobody on the same server will sell weapons or armor with the exact same specs, anyway, and there is no way to compare two different 3-star gatlings, for example.
---
Concerning consumables like flux or serums, everybody will develop a good sense of what is a reasonable price pretty soon, if they haven't already.
---
But I would surely like to see everything that's on offer on a given server at  a glance, so as to not waste all those caps and all that time FTing between shops only to find they all offer nothing but crap...
---
Seeing it on my ps4 aswell. Weird lightning and shadows too. Last night there was no furniture inside the Charlston firedepartment, although all the junk items, bots and terminals loaded in ok.
---
Lovely story....  This Vendor just became Legendary in my opinion 
---
Yesterday my friend and me claimed the food factory , after 10 Min somebody claimed it and fast travelled to kill us .... 
---
At first we did not understand what happened . Not into PvP...
---
Another friend told us this is the way griefers work . They claim the workshop to force PvP.
---
My friend and his possy tracked him down  ,hunted him ,killed him and destroyed his camp...
---
You do not mess with players in passive mode...
---
Thanks for the info, man. Junkie was my fav. in FO4, seems it's unviable here
---
I don't think so. [The math still checks out](https://akarnokd.github.io/rng-76/weapons.html) with ingame numbers. I have a lvl 45 hardened Pump-action Shotgun. With bloody mess only, I get 163 damage. +Demolition Expert 5, I get 180 damage. That translates to an effective 13% damage increase.
---
It's ninja liberator :)
---
Bought the game on the easter ps4 sales, a bit scared from all i read and the hate towards it. At lvl 14 at the moment and totally in love with this game.
---
I don't know if the work of the last months dramatically improved it but for sure i can see today that all the bad talking was not deserved at all.
---
As and elder scroll and fallout player i think that TESO is way more far than the spirit of the original series than that.
---
This is a great game, at least for me, wich is the most important thing, and i am very happy to have chosen it.
---
Complete X01
---
Shopping? Time to switch cards. Fighting? Time to switch back. Repair? Switch cards again. Gathering? Switch. Fight? Switch back. Home? Switch to heal card. Dead? Forgot to replace fight cards.
---
No worries and thank you so much for the video link, you covered absolutely everything and showed it off in your own game! You stated in the video that you actually get both of those floors, that is great to know!
---
Instigating effect works only when target is full health, I think it would be ineffective if the target has some rads (not sure 100% because I don't do pvp). For me, instigating is for PVE, and especially when you're the first one to hit targets.
---
Damn, you people found huntersville. That was one of my secret hunting spots.
---
Update your fallout 76custom.ini
---
Pretty sure mine registered, I swear I've only got whoopsies left on the list.
---
It's the same as the imposter, fashnacht, and now this.. people join the event and just stand at the spawn point... you dont actually have to do anything at an event to get the rewards or xp...  just wont get nothing from the enemys
---
I‚Äôm soloing most of the time. No brahmin dies
---
Don't forget to check vendors, especially after nukes. High level players are picky. I've sold some good 2 and 3 star stuff that just didn't make the cut to get into my stash.
---
I use the perk loadout manager, but I can't see how it can give me an edge--I don't play on survival.  I also use the chat mod.  But yeah I steer clear of the ones with obvious 'cheats', like making items glow.
---
weapons and armor would be more showing similar items or what price that item has sold for in the past to give a better idea as to value, it would be more usefull for the more common items like aid or scrap that can chang price a lot, most people i trade with struggle to know what price to sell things for and end up over charging
---
@4:30
---
Got em all today, looks awesome with the sheepsquash impostor outfit.
---
Did you get the electrified one as well?
---
Where you near an event cause I had this happen once to me as well could not kill this guy with vats simply would not target him..later after much discussion on here we came to agreement that it‚Äôs a exploit with events
---
Why can't I seat them at the dinner table?? Grr.
---
This is very good info, i have been arguing with twitch streamers (unfortunately some very well known ones) who say that armor penetration is stacking over 99% and are capped at 200%. I really dislike that they spread misinformation and brags about 1k hours in the game.
---
I found I couldn‚Äôt log in a few evenings ago whilst my pc was streaming. I stopped the pc &amp; was able to start up 76. Do you have another device connected to the network anywhere draining the data?
---
Actually no, didn't know there was one. Looks like I don't have em all.
---
This! I‚Äôve gotten this disease several times now and it just won‚Äôt register! I‚Äôve given up on that challenge
---
This has been there from the start.
---
Imagine switching between commando and rifleman when you switch weapons. This is where this mod combined with macros start giving an unfair advantage.
---
The only two things I have using the network in my place is my Xbox and my phone.
---
I have given up on the event, finished it over 10 tome and can never find the body even when i was standing over it as it died.  V fustrating.
---
Just the official "there's no policy for mods yet"
---
Three days after eating the pie the op died and turned into a goul and moved to whitesprings,a week later he was farmed and was found with a legendary rolling pin 1 star on his body :)
---
This happened to me yesterday aswell as soon as I restarted my Xbox it worked though.
---
Oh I see!  No, I don't switch during combat, too busy with the killing lol.
---
Unfortunately that wasn't the case for me but I'll keep trying.
---
There‚Äôs also a burning variant, but I already have burning barbed so I don‚Äôt care too much about that one
---
Yeah I noticed that when you do the key to the past quest you get a level 50 or so goul in blackwater mine
---
The way I restarted it was by holding the Xbox button then pressing restart console not sure maybe it works like that
---
My husband and I had similar issues with rose's quests, and in the end we just finished his questline first and then closed the game and restarted, and mine sort of reset to an earlier point and I was able to finish it. We're supposed to be able to do these quests together but they've been buggy for months :/
---
I'll give it a try. I was thinking about unplugging the Xbox for a bit too.
---
Freezing mod doesn't look to bad, reminds me of skyrim for some reason.
---
The workshop at the Poseidon plant also has a helipad. I tried this mild exploit once, but the payout in XP was not nearly worth the expense in steel and aluminium. Maybe it yields more XP in the ammo factory workshop, and it surely is a better payout right now with the double XP weekend, and if a group of players pool their ressources, it's a no-brainer. 
---
Me, I got to lvl 240 without shortcuts like that, but I vaguely remember I skipped some levels in the beginning by using the trap dismantling exploit (like from 37 to 50), to be able to craft and use top-tier items and PA a.s.a.p., but that was soo long ago.
---
Always been this way, for example if you buy a single bobby pin for 9 caps (hard bargain 3) the vendor will show he has only 2 caps that you can trade back
---
Obviously I‚Äôm unsure if what I did actually made a difference but I got it to work. I probably tried 8-10 times with it sticking but soft-reset did it for me. Only thing I can suggest is to maybe check the disc(if needed) &amp; to keep trying
---
Grahm has no role in the exploit, he would just have been there by accident.
---
No disc for it but I got it to work finally. The third time unplugging the router and Xbox worked.
---
I've been finding legendary weapons on non legendary enemy  protections that keep spawning at the whitesprings golf course
---
For me it'd steal me the joy of victory if victory wasn't hard earned
---
I haven‚Äôt in a while. People lost interest, and most drinks and there effects can be found online now.
---
I haven‚Äôt seen any mention of a freezing mod. Got a picture?
---
Thats an excellent idea for a perk card
---
Lol I keep seeing the skin on my power armor every once in a while when I don't own it
---
In Addition for Radeon Vega 64 in my case I needed to
---
turn on HBCC Memory Segment in Radeon Settings
---
and turn off Fullscreen
---
set in ini file at C:\\Users\\User\\Documents\\My Games\\Fallout 76\\Fallout76Prefs.ini
---
bFull Screen=0
---
The settings fixed the problem in my case
---
Congratulations! =D
---
I got one a few days ago as well. &lt;3
---
I have just tried this and it doesn't work... I wonder if there is a real alien in-game?
---
That sucks, but I always don't constantly press the sell button just in case
---
Hopefully it's retroactive. I didn't think of hoarding points. üòñ
---
I'm just not good at gaming enough to be bringing up menus and so forth while in combat.
---
I hope that once the camps can't get damaged change comes in, they include your pets as part of the camp, since pets already take up your camp build allowance.
---
All vendors buy cems, I've been giving low level players some of my known plan or recipes
---
Seen someone running around with it today pvping with someone else with the flaming barbed mod, fire Vs ice battle, fire won. Nearly killed myself laughing.
---
My own mic is normally muted unless I actually want to talk (I don't like the constant area chat notifications that just keep popping up and getting in the way on PS4), and even if I see other players' area chat notifications, I hardly ever hear anyone talking, even when I'm not in party talk. My chat settings say 'automatic', but maybe that doesn't work like it should?
---
Wish you'd asked an hour ago.
---
Ha I did, no one listened ha
---
Okay thanks I do have hard bargain 3
---
At least you got it up &amp; running again to get back in the wastes
---
Thanks for the help!
---
Yeah also that üòÖ I used up a few but went up a few levels, so down to 19 to use. I remember checking often to see how close to a level I was.. now I do t want to level because I don‚Äôt know what to do üòÜ
---
I‚Äôve been noticing a round orange circular glow coming from somewhere on my character for a few days now. I always wear the prisoners collar which glows red, this is something different.
---
By doing the free range event at Fred's BBQ and some other places I forgot sorry or just put in the wild.
---
Don't worry I've had worse,I had a whole suit of excavator power armor disappear because of a glitch
---
Haha nice. Well shit, now I want that freezing mod too
---
Oh, cheers! I've had a couple of Junkie weapons in the past. I really want to use them and make them fun and viable but getting and maintaining addictions at the moment is a pain in the ass, so I more or less ditched the idea.
---
There are plenty of fun risk / reward build ideas.
---
Bloodies, Junkies, Plague Walker. Though currently Bloodied is extremely strong, easy to maintain and requires minimal set up. I'd happily roll junkie / plague walker if it didn't require constant upkeep and maintenance for fairly small returns.
---
It's a random encounter 2
---
Yes!!! This totally needs to happen
---
1. Event: "Free Range" you'll encounter one or two Sheepsquatch at the end of the event.
---
2. Random encounter: Several places: Cranberry bog, Mire &amp; Savage Divide.  
---
Hope this helps you out.
---
Taste the nuclear rainbow
---
Lol same, good huntingüëç
---
Its because the event mechanics of teaming up may get bonkers. Enter the event zone, go to pipboy and reject the event to fix the issue.
---
You also could gift processed photos to others
---
I do that all the time, but I mostly use world containers for that purpose. This way the items stay available for a longer time, giving others a better chance to find them.
---
On the other hand, when I stay on a golden server for a long time and end up adding to and putting dozens of legendaries into containers within the WS service building (usually the end point of my WS round), I do notice graphics and doors glitching out more and more, plus intensifying frame rate issues, even if I have the server to myself. That makes me think it might be best to actually use bags instead so that the garbage collection algorithm can just delete them once there are too many objects in the area.
---
That gun is obviously duped i have seen dozens of people w exact same gun in past few days
---
Can this be turned into a mod?
---
No. I think y'alls hot swapping needs to be actively nerfed.
---
I claim and defend them for sweet sweet plans. That is all, I have never even built an extractor
---
I found it randomly North East area of the map. Warning, the thing can be a bullet sponge.
---
I hate this. Well done, people, on your 1 shot rifle build. Isn't is wonderful how you've copied those perk cards from a YouTube video so accurately. Stop killing everything before others get a hit in. Selfish twats.
---
A few days ago I did the sons of dane event. I didn't know another player was there because they were up top in stealth. Well I found out they were there! Because I was using melee and nothing got in the door because a *pftt* noise from up top killed them in one hit. I killed 1 thing outside the door and they had the cheek to say "*Let them in so we can both tag them.*".
---
The twat did the same with the Wendigo, stopping me getting anything. Completely wasted the caps to fast travel and the time I spent there. I did the angry face emote and he said "*Oh, did you not tag it?*" (You know when you can hear a smile in somebody's voice?). I hit him with my super sledge to show I was pissed off... keeping in mind I play in pacifist, it obviously was just a gesture. "*Hit me again. Go on. I* dare *you*". Yeah fine. Hit him again. He must thought he could now initiate PVP.
---
Not sure exactly what happened but I'm guessing he had explosive bloodied weapons and a bloodied build... and shot me with them point blank. Because he just silently fell over and died.
---
I took his junk because he deserved it. I do feel bad about the teabagging though. That wasn't necessary.
---
Pro tips
---
Mirelurk queens when all legs are crippled via enforcer or other similar perks will go into a downed state where they are immobile and unable to turn. They never recover from this, and can only attack targets that walk in front of them. It takes a lot of shots to do this, with enforcer 3 it takes upwards of 20 shotgun blasts to cripple all of their limbs.
---
If you stand behind them they will reliably throw out hatchlings multiple times after you kill them, allowing you to farm hatchlings while they are in this state.
---
I often use artillery strikes on them while they are crippled like this because it saves durability and my camp is in range of several queen spawns.
---
Upvoting cuz of the GT
---
Imagine having Electrically Charged :D
---
Lol! Thank you....
---
I thought broadsider got damage boost from heavy weapons
---
So you encountered a murderhobo in the wild? Cool
---
when I milked a cow comfortably. Suddenly a legendary sheepsquatch appears from far away and attacked me.  
---
could kill him after a while 
---
[https://imgur.com/QR8kYr4](https://imgur.com/QR8kYr4) \-  Fallout 76: milking cow - Then: come a legendary SHEEPSQUATCH !

---
PS:  yes I do not speak a good English ...;)
---
Very nice might do this next time I decide to move
---
free range event or as random encounters
---
but to get the thought weapons u see people with u have to complete the free range event (can give mods for said weapons too)
---
random encounter sheepsquach only rewards random loot like normal creatures
---
I FINALLY GOT MINE EARLIER IN THE WEEK it's satisfying to see after months of trying
---
In a few weeks you can point at your vending machine to ease your troubles. Unless you're trading item for item.
---
My only complaint is it sounds like a mutant hound.
---
I've gotten whoopsies and sludge lung, both aren't registering for me on the list. üò≠
---
Dont bring a knife to a shooting knife contest
---
It‚Äôs corrected itself now. Sometimes the weather effects at certain points in the day/night cycle can look hazy but I think some textures hadn‚Äôt loaded correctly also.
---
I liked taking mine in front of vault 76. Along the savage divide cliffs by Morgantown (facing Morgantown), there was a really cool bar with a piano and a banjo (can‚Äôt remember the location but it‚Äôs the nukashine quest)
---
I would carry that, and also have a Bloodied Explosive crossbow ready for sniping.
---
The next update teases 'archery', let's hope the crossbow will get some love as well. Mods for hardened receivers et al. would be nice, as would be composite skins and so on.
---
On the other hand, I only ever had 1-star crossbows drop, never even saw a 2-star. Do they exist?
---
Legendary corpses always are.

---
Remember to get a couple low level weapons for when you reset
---
Pretty sure you cant do that one out of order, so finish the Raider questline. Which you start from just being anywhere in the vicinity of Top of the World.
---
Yes thats why I said its easy to get by trading on reddit. I'm just giving advise i don't understand the relevance is of the gun being duped or not.
---
It took me so long to get another X01 Tesla Coil torso mod. I feel your pain.
---
OP: What platform?
---
Downvotes but you spoke truth. Too typical
---
Oooooh, whole *weeks*?
---
It's never happened to you, so it's never happened?
---
So that is a 17 point damage increase, divided by the original 163 gives a 10.4% increase. So the question is, are the 5 perks cards in demo expert worth a 10% increase? A similar perk of 10% extra damage while aiming might be just as damaging, however, you don't get the splash damage.
---
I saw a guy with a 3 star bloodied lvl 35
---
There is a floating island at tanagra town on far left side of map deep in jungle, from there I‚Äôve takin tons of badass loading screen shots
---
Is it an exploit if it comes at a steep cost, it takes a lot of aluminum and steel to repair the pad after each kill, so you only have a finite amount of exp that can be earned this way, more if you have 20 people farming aluminum and steel.
---
It stinks, but seams like a legitimate enough way of going about things that anyone can do, if they put in the effort.
---
That‚Äôs a mechanic that I really like in warhammer vermintide.  Maybe it requires 2-4 points into strength cards to unlock or something but this idea is brilliant!
---
Every point in a particular stat opens up that number of card slots for that particular stat. 15 Strength = 15 cards, 10 Agility = 10 cards. This means the total number of points the cards are worth- not the total number of cards. 
---
And cards can be switched out for others in your collection at literally any time.
---
Yep same here, been getting it a lot in the last week or so.
---
So that's where it went.....
---
#PTW
---
I never said that but hey if you're saying it then I guess it never happens ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è chill dude. It's just weird to me. Griefers are gonna grief no matter what, and apparently, sometimes they use workshops that people own to mess with people. Never had it happen to me so far, and I really doubt that level has anything to do with it since griefers are just assholes and will pick on who ever they want to
---
I Don't blame Him, is a very nice balcony and He is a very discerning... supernatural entity.
---
Where is this, and how do I update it ?
---
I was wandering around online, but wasn't looking on reddit. Oh well.
---
The broadside has this strange property where it deals inordinate damage to limbs, by which I mean it will take enemies arms and legs off easily in one shot, which few weapons can do, even with the perks and legendary effect to do so.
---
I've taken both legs off an assaultron in one hit, easily, even my leg breaker double barrel struggles to do the same.
---
Is it a good main weapon, no, but it has this one weird utility.
---
I take workshops regularly. Whoopty doo, that doesn't change the fact that the reason there is so much controversy over them, is they are easily **exploit**able, and there are plenty of people with questionable morals, who use it to take advantage.
---
If this would have been addressed by Bethesda from the beginning, there wouldn't be 90% of the complaint posts you see about workshop "griefers".
---
Your PSA isn't a PSA, it's just another rant post.
---
If you want an X-01 Nuka quantum paint plan or even a t-51 Nuka cola paint plan, lemme know. I have lots of them taking up space
---
Whatever those forests are that shoot sparks in the Cranberry Bog are beautiful.
---
Yep I carry molotovs on my big swingers. Tesla coils on another.
---
Everyone should have a tag option.
---
I carry a boss debuff on everyone too, just for sbq and impostersquatch. Cryo weapons, syringer, limb damage, something.
---
Can you provide a link to such drinks? Can't seem to find a complete list.
---
Yes but then I walked into a salty subreddit (this one) and shriveled to r/memes where I have resided since late last year
---
I know that what I‚Äôm confused about is when do you stop collecting perk cards and if you have per say 15 strength and 15 cards or however many that can count to that, but you also have 7 unused cards, do you stop collecting cards or can you chose to replace them?
---
Yeah this is why I try to remember to stash all my weapons before trading with someone. Would rather someone not see my AA 3* grog axe or my 3* TSE gatling gun, ask for it, and lose it after I say no üôÑ
---
yeah I see junkie could be a viable alternative to bloodied for higher dps
---
Yes 2 or 3 star in SBQ. In don't worry about add kills there ... at least one of my characters is spec for demo ... I'll use half my stock at least on the sbq (and any adds that stand near by).
---
Now that's reassuring. I haven't had crossbows drop for quite a while, and got three 1-stars last night all of a sudden. Suppressor's, Vampire's, and Exterminator's, I think. Didn't keep any of them, but it's great to know something usable might eventually drop.
---
I also had a 2shot CB for a while that did a good job on the 'kill 76 scorched with  a crossbow' challenge. Well, at least in the Forest, but on lvl 68 scorched it was next to useless.
---
I‚Äôve done One Violent Night a dozen times. The only legendary you ever get is the reward for killing the Wendigo.
---
I was mainly going by what you said in your other post about it being AlienRace, instead of how the flatwoods monster is labeled. 
---
I just extrapolated that it would be included with the nuclear winter patch because of the stuff said in the datamined logs.
---
So was mainly just going by what the dataminers found and putting 2 and 2 together. There is no data stating they for sure will come out then, just seemed likely as they were added the same time as those logs and some of the logs sound like they are talking about aliens.
---
Honestly I just dump all these in the stations or whitesprings for people to get for free as do many other people I've gotten so many that way.
---
So many I wonder why anyone buys them
---
You also prevent other players from getting loot if you one shot legendaries in events, it's just nasty. I usually have low damage weapons with me to use just in case. I wouldn't like others to steal from me, so I avoid doing that to anyone!
---
From my experience, teammates only get a measly amount of loot from treasure maps, so don't expect an enthusiastic response.
---
I've heard you need to find a dead tourist with the camera and some other stuff on to start a wuest there are lots of spawns for it tho
---
PC
---
You never stop collecting cards even when you stop gaining SPECIAL points at level 50. 
---
There is no way to get rid of the cards at the bottom that you don't have slotted but they don't do anything and will just be there. It's a bit annoying to shift through them when you want to find the card you want, but otherwise you'll just have to learn to ignore them.
---
With instigating on a power fist, my unarmed build is about to one shot all ghouls (including bloated glowing ones), all scorched, and all super mutants. The only super mutants to survive an instigating power attack is a legendary supermutant warlord (or whatever the level 68 one is).
---
Without incisor, the first power attack vs a lvl 50 scorchbeast brings it to just about half health.
---
I think the body just spawns randomly somewhere. So just keep exploring tourist attractions until you find it.
---
I know for sure ghouls *aren't* if you want to do a definite test.
---
I could believe maybe if very large enemies were immune to stagger peruaps.
---
Just pointing out that duping still exists and it makes pvp unplayable everyone having same over powered weapons  and there  youtube builds  , what happened to originality ? I usually roll with a teammate and we regularly get ganged up on by  these kids most recent was 6v2 and then they proceeded to tell us how great they are and how much we suck . We were wrecking them until 5 and six showed up . Game wont be fixed till they wipe all weapons and put identifiers on all legendary weapons so dupers can be found
---
It would he great if berserker only cared about damage resistance from armor and gear, because you can build up enough DR through perks and mutations to make it viable if it were that way.
---
https://fallout.gamepedia.com/Fallout_76_brewing_and_distilling
---
Upvoted!
---
I too, want the junkies build to be viable.
---
I don't but free loot is free loot.... mostly I just wanted the company.
---
My whole suit of Max level X-01 jetpack quantum with a beautiful purple headlamp disappeared. It was my favorite thing I had out of everything.
---
The other day some guy saw my ten or so treasure maps and really wanted them. Like, he sent me a message and friend request through Xbox because he wanted them so bad. The mad man actually bought all of them for 200 caps each.
---
It was the same for me also. Only on a few (can‚Äôt remember which) I remember I had to level up equipping a card I didn‚Äôt really want but was able to equip the card I did want on the next level up
---
THIS!! I only said this to a friend the other day. It's common sense. I find alot of players initiate trade with you just so they can have a look through your inventory. It's gotten to the point where I won't accept trades from randoms.
---
I drop my stuff in artisans corner too.  Ammo or scrap that I don't need and weighs too much.
---
You, literally, said that. It's right there in your post and everything. I've never been griefed either. I'm in perma-crouch, or in a team too. The people exploiting this, aren't using it to PvP, or for a challenge, they're using it to take advantage.
---
Doing better then Anthem. From what I have heard.
---
Yikes. Bethesda really need to fix these bugs or at least have a way to get your item back through support
---
Cryptids cant be tamed or pacified as of now. Maybe a prestige perk card in the future would be nice?
---
I'm glad you did this.
---
 
---
&gt;  Has anyone else had this issue?  
---
Yes others have had the issue, but the few times I've seen anyone post about it here they have been down voted and told that it's somehow their fault, further fueling my suspicion that a growing number of people who post here don't even play the game.
---
The problem is the camera is bugged, and still names the last thing it highlighted all of the time, persisting between game sessions and alt characters! Until you highlight something else!
---
Yeah it still annoys me about how much time I put into that suit
---
Visual glitch when he used a stealthboy? There are so many issues with stealth in PvP, it is possible.
---
Even without death, addictions barely last any time at all!
---
This is a good idea I‚Äôm gonna start doing that.
---
Thank you! I must suck at searching for the things I need lol. Everything I found was missing stuff and not complete. Have a good day. üòÄ
---
Yup. Don't belong to any other subs. Haven't bothered to dig around with the Reddit site much. Haven't made a single post.
---
A lot of the folks that trade use imigur.
---
Ow wow how luck
---
He had to check the view.
---
I disagree with your statement. More good weapons avalible on the market means more people are able to get them. So by this equaling out the playing field. If you don't own a good weapon farm and trade abit on reddit you well get one in no time. Because everyone has OP weapons now its all about being creative with your pvp build. And you absolutely don't need full assasin sentinal for that.
---
The top right part of the map is really your best bet. Usually lower levels, but quite the variety. I've had a glowing wolf, mole rat, even an opossum. They all died pretty quickly though. üòñ
---
Free range events spawn at Fred's BBQ, and just downhill from the southern belle hotel
---
Simple but spectacular photo.it seems like it's at home.
---
I also have a spawn for it and flatwood monster near my camp,but they get hostile fast.
---
We just moved to a different state from a friend that just suffered a heart attack.  We keep his mind occupied and off that fact. Even before that it was great to each of us pour a real Manhattan while we drink nukashine. I've known him for more than 30 years and it's nice to hang out with him or laugh when he is scrapping incessantly and my son throws Molotov cocktails at because he is taking too long.  Dude .... Debbie says "get off and finish" .
---
Many of my best photos are from the top of monorail segments, whether individual towers or the elevator.
---
I love all of the FO games. I was so looking forward to FO76 release.  I knew that there would be lots of problems at the start like the others but in time it gets good. Beth in the end always comes through with the good stuff and they really do try to make things better. But unfortunately sooooo many people just love to complain
---
Subtle.
---
Cool thanks. I'll keep looking :)
---
Agreed. I love how they started sneaking stuff in before the sheer terror patch went live with the dead brahmin encounters and have built it all up over the weeks. They managed to create a genuine tinfoil hat conspiracy feel to the whole thing. Very well done, bugs and all.
---
Specifically this MODUS terminal:  [https://imgur.com/a/npfHJKw](https://imgur.com/a/npfHJKw) after you enter through the vault door and go down a few flights of stairs.
---
If you enjoyed Fallout 3 or 4, this game can offer many hours of enjoyment. I would say 50-100 hours was the point where I got hungry for new content, so that's good value.
---
Bethesda has sabotaged the game to some extent by diverting attention and resources to microtransaction money grabbing, so it's not perfect or necessarily better than Fallout 4.
---
Still, if I could go back in time with what I know now and decide whether to buy the game again, I would definitely do so.
---
I literally never said it doesn't happen but okay lmao go off I guess ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è I said it's never happened to me, not that it never happens. Learn how to read
---
Yeah I was getting hordes of 68 super mutants, 40-60 miners, random scorchbeasts etc. Never had a chance really
---
Me, too. And many others...
---
Cryolators absolutely rule in this event. Not only do they stop the impostor in it's tracks it's really easy to find a frozen corpse, they kinda stand out :)
---
If they do that won't stop the camps already that are there. I've noticed this myself with my CAMP as it is in a "no build place" now after the recent patch where they added in a new raider camp less than 50 feet from my CAMP. If I were to move my CAMP I'd not be able to replace it there due to being too near a map marker.
---
So basically even if they make WS a no build zone, it won't get rid of the camps already there.
---
How is using obviously duped items and copying YouTube build creative
---
They made it annoying to swap cause fallout has always been a game about choices and living with them.  What we have today IS the compromise.  What if I hate my build?  What if I make a mistake?  You aren't supposed to be good at everything or even most things.
---
 Please deposit down votes as needed.
---
Yes, PS4 has build anywhere mods for fo4.
---
Yes, and by uploading them to imgur and then posting a link.
---
You know explosive damage is really avoidable, right? Falling in holes in the bog less so.
---
Damn really that sucks, thanks though :)
---
The perk load out manager mod was awesome but Bethesda made it so you can't use the mod without doing some extra steps that I couldn't figure out so I had to stop using it
---
Yes.
---
FO4 has multiplayer mods.
---
Big Fred's BBQ, and Southern Belle Hotel. There will be a robot and the 3 brahmin. 
---
At the BBQ shsck the event will start from the FT point, at Belles, you have to run down the hill.
---
Oh boy, I sure am having a hard time choosing on whether to turn on happy camper compromising 15-30 seconds of my life when it could be a passive and nothing changes but less time wasted.
---
This isnt a valid argument at all
---
Yeah I tried to take a closer/better picture but he started attacking me =/
---
The other current downside with building in fo76 is you can't place decorations you pick up in game. Like that stuffed animal you picked up and want to place it on your bed in your CAMP? Too bad, can't do it.
---
Ya sat in front a diseased mirelurk baby for like 30 mins and then gave up I'll try again after they fix all the broken challenges.
---
I don't think anywhere is still trying to sell this game for 60$, you can pick up the PC version for like 10$ now.
---
Not true.  Nowhere close to being true. Good god I'm more convinced than ever that there's a large number of people posting here who don't even play the game.
---
I got it three days ago from the SBQ I think, or at least during the fight.  Might have been bit by those little suckers
---
I don't remember where I found it, but I found a jangles the moon monkey posed like he's shooting golf balls in to a lake. I made it look like a post card
---
Can someone explain this to me like I'm five? English is my third language and I just don't get the point here :(
---
I found 22 in the Pi House on Fraternity Row in Morgantown. Who knew that fraternity members just leave empty beer bottles lying around...
---
Crashing to desktop and being kicked from the server is still super common also. Same with never ending loading screens. Invisible enemies are still in the game and can end up killing you without you being able to fight back because they aren't showing up on your client.
---
To claim this game is functioning as well as you would expect a Triple A title to function is a lie, this game is as "functional" as an indy developed game.
---
Hell, minecraft had less bugs when it was being made by just Notch.
---
I'm not copying anything from youtube didn't even know  there where any. Having alot of good weapons on the market gives more more people the oppertunity to have good weapons them selfs. Which makes the pvp'ing more fair and equal. When everything is equal you can spend more time focusing on your build. Tell me how it would be fairer any other way. The only way i could imagion is removing legiondary modifiers all together in pvp which imo makes it easyer for the plebs but removes the uniqueness of some weapons or builds.
---
How long is it in game days?
---
Sometimes less than 1!
---
He looks like he‚Äôs contemplating his life
---
Few bugs? This game has more bugs than most indy developed games. To act like this game isn't a bug filled mess is just out right lying to yourself.
---
There are still tons of random DC's from the servers, crashing to desktop, invisible enemies that can attack you but you can't attack back, performance is horrible even on hardware that is well above the recommended, it has a lag spike every 30 seconds or so while trying to build camps, and has the same lag spikes about every 2 minutes while trying to play the game.
---
Did you just get tired of waiting for them to fix the major bugs?
---
It does not. You're thinking of Fallout 4, which made the Broadsider a hybrid Heavy/Demo weapon. in 76, it's just an explosive weapon.
---
I have yet to beat the imposter sheepsquatch event, though I‚Äôve tried several times. Every time I go there there are a bunch of level 40-75s lurking in the corners of the area just hoping to get a reward, and a bunch of level 100+ guys standing around pretending they don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs going on so they don‚Äôt have to activate the pylons. I end up taking on 2-3 pylons by myself and burn through 30 stimpacks, only to eventually die and start the cycle all over again. 
---
Oh and to the dudes that marsupial jump onto the flagpole and just stand there plinking away with some pea shooter, you‚Äôre not helping.
---
Need to have lockable items that dont appear in trade inventory and cant be dropped or scrapped
---
Its the repair kits, they have turned survival into P2W.
---
But with hard bargain it's a hellova conversation during a fight:
---
I'd like to hit you for XX damage, but you will try to block me.  How about I shoot you instead?
---
Happens to me wayyyy to often, or fast traveler....
---
Hi there! I find that if I wait until the end of the VATS noise before I fire it locks in more accurately :)

---
Won't be on for a while, or I'd join you. Have maps for the Forest, savage divide, toxic valley, and ash heap I haven't even started on.
---
Actually the issue is that survival is being overrun by people abusing repair kits you can buy so they can stay crouched 24/7 in survival making those who don't pay cash at a distinct disadvantage. So the people who don't pay money for the repair kits are leaving survival and coming back to adventure to get their pvp in where they don't have to worry about p2w shit.
---
Once you hit higher levels keep a set of power armor with Tesla coil chest, and just run around the mobs tagging everything with electrical damage. You get credit for a hit, and if you are able to tank damage you can keep the attention of the mobs while lower levels have fun actually doing the killing. Healing factor makes this even better. I only end up using stimpacks for sheepsquatch or SBQ any more and can always loot everything.
---
Your statement just proves you have no problem gaining advantage over others by purchasing and using overpowered duped weapons . More duped weapons dont even the playing field it just makes it harder on those of us who dont enjoy cheating yes cheating by making those weapons more readily available to the players who don't mind or seek out an unfair advantage
---
I think so, it's only 4 and 76 that don't have it included and I think it would be pretty neat. Just imagine someone taking a picture of you; leather jacket, glasses, one handed shotgun
---
cool! is that a new PtW feature you can buy in the Atomic Shop? If so, take my money!!
---
That's adorable. ‚ò∫Ô∏è
---
ya, works great for me generally..but I don't target my fellow vault dwellers.
---
shame on you.
---
A million times, yes!!!
---
Still a better love story than Twilight
---
Keep your pets indoors build a house for it they will be happier and safer
---
Oh yeah. It was broken as hell. Lol. But we knew it was early access when it came out. It didn't pretend to be anything other then that. 
---
The platform they built ended up being pretty good for online survival though. I'm still astounded by the guild fortress cities I've seen people build in that game, and how the game itself and the servers can handle.
---
How would you feel about non swappable perk cards?  Similar to a tech tree that you can't back out.  Time is a resource.  If a card let's you do something fat it is valuable.
---
Also, I tend to need to remind myself to take my character out of Passive Mode because nothing screams ultimate loser more than lining up the perfect Stealth shot, pulling the trigger, and .... you're a flippin pacifist....
---
Probably look a bit like Kellog XD
---
The way I do it is I will go grab the fusion core producing posieden energy workshop, set up enough turrets to where it doesn't need me to defend it, and set up the fusion core extractor to run and set it to unlocked so anyone in PA can grab some if they need it. 
---
As I already have enough 100% cores to last me for the next 2 months. I try to share the wealth with the server, if some dumbass wants to try to pvp me for it I just go to my CAMP which is placed in such a way you can only get to it by fast traveling to it, or need to be extremely good with marsupial+ jetpack+ Power armor frame leap frogging.
---
Basically my CAMP is placed where others can't physically get to it without fast traveling to it. So I'll just go there when they are trying that, then I'll mock them when they can't get up there and the normally end up rage quitting and giving up.
---
Trading is not cheating. The reality is those weapons are here if you like it or not ,you can't do anything about it. You can keep on complaining being miserable about the current pvp situation or you can act like a man earn a bit of caps by trading with people on reddit and get a nice weapon yourself to enjoy pvp again. Its really not that hard. Improvise, adapt, overcome. Just exept this is the reality we are currently in now.
---
I activated a core extractor exactly once for my Big Guns Power Armor guy, and in an hour I got enough cores that I have not needed to do it again. Still have four untouched, I tend to scavenge enough to not touch my stash.
---
Thank you. Those are all the fun ones, have a bunch more but they're more personal than particularly good.
---
My stash is absolutely rammed with crappy 1* weightless and wooden armor.... it better be worth it ha!
---
Neat. Thanks for the info.
---
I bought it as a surprise for my nephew. I can‚Äôt wait for him to get it, he doesn‚Äôt even know it‚Äôs coming, it will be a total shock. I‚Äôll post once he sees it.
---
Same. I‚Äôve dumped all the 1 stars though. Pretty much going on a star by weight ratio now unless it‚Äôs something really good that I could sell when we get player vending machines.
---
I guess so XD but Kellogg had a very mad max kinda vibe to him which is kinda the goal I guess
---
Corpsess of any kind are client based
---
Quite looking forward to it myself, had some mook walk in and threaten my camp if I didn't change servers because they apparently needed slots to XP farm.
---
Only advice I can give you is add a sight. It won't line up with where your shooting but it gives you a reference. The bullets always hit in the same spot relative to where the sight is pointing. A coupe hundred rounds and your brain will learn to shoot without crosshairs.
---
I just wish the game had more post apocalyptic looks
---
True. I mean myself I wish the game atleast had a few more guns because as of late we haven't really had any new guns added to the game and ik I'm not the only one who would like to see the 9mm and .45 pistol return to the game. Even the service pistol from fallout 4 would be nice.
---
Dosent look inviting like a metal box prison I'm afraid someone might shank me if I go in. Think you should atleast change the front to brick or barn and less like a box
---
your way doesn't sound near as manly as what I did..

Ah, makes sense, thanks man!
---
10 str , 13 per, 7 pers, 6 char, 8 intell, 6 agi, 6 luck.
---
I‚Äôm really excited about the upcoming legendary feature. Currently sitting on 43 unused perks points.
---
I want the shoulder mounted machine gun back
---
I usually grab all 3, tag her, hop up on the roof, and then drop to my knees with no health. For 30 solid seconds, she becomes vincible, while I die. At about 10 or 15 seconds left, I'll yell for help. When I respawn, if no one res'd me, I do it again. Giving everyone the chance to beat on her for 30 uninterrupted seconds makes this fight go a lot faster. I recommend stashing your junk before trying this method.
---
So your answer is cheat cheat and cheat some more . When you are trading for or purchasing items you know to be duped that in my eyes is cheating .i have caps and organically dropped items I could trade for pretty much anything i might desire, but i dont desire to be a part of the problem.  Again the only way to fix it is to remove all legendary weapons from the game and make everyone farm for new weapons with identifiers on them so they cant be duped
---
Haha damn üòÜ and I thought I was sitting on a lot
---
It's exactly like that guy that buys a dozen 20 dollar lotto tickets. The chance you get anything worthwhile on such a small pool is really low.
---
Take a Rad-X to suppress it. Should help reduce your disease resistance too.
---
Also better beds they dont look very comfortable their is so much cool stuff you could do. I like the idea but make it a place I want to relax in and not cook meth in
---
As cool as it would be, I feel like that would be better suited as a power armour mod then a standalone weapon. And maybe a shoulder mounted single shot RPG power armour mod for T60 and X01

Some possible spawns I‚Äôve heard.

Found mines at Big Maw
---
What i'm gathering from this thread is the map people are like that old guy that loses his mind when the machine is out of his favorite lottery scratch off
---
I‚Äôm not anywhere near ghouls, though. the only thing that spawns around me are bloodbugs and mirelurks
---
Well missiles and explosives in general in this game are kinda garbage truth be told
---
I'm hanging into a few items that I want to reroll. Three star stuff that I like but has crappy effects.
---
I'm assuming there will be some kind of limiting factor to how fast we are going to be able to gain and spend these tokens. Others have said perhaps legendaries found before the vendor is released won't be eligible. 
---
Nobody knows. But I wouldn't count on a stash full of legendaries giving you any huge advantage.
---
Any thoughts on how this will work? 
---
I‚Äôm hoping you get a token for each star you scrap. Then when you have lots of these you roll the dice with some of them and get a drop with at least 3 stars. I‚Äôd imagine you will only be able to roll dice once and then only every 1 days in between or perhaps less if the purveyor is hard to find. It can‚Äôt be made easy as we would all get the weapons we won‚Äôt and the in game market is killed for FO76 and  Bethesda would not want that. So I‚Äôm thinking is just another way to get a roll of the dice but it‚Äôs not going to be every day and hard to do or find the purveyor. Interested what you guys think about how it will work? Thanks
---
I‚Äôm near one of the greens between the pond where mirelurk sometimes spawn and a little shed where bloodbugs sometimes spawn. I picked the spot because it was pretty as well.
---
They were better before the nerf but I dont think they're gonna rebuff them any time soon because we were at a point that a 18th - 19th century rifle was doing 3x the damage of a tactical  handheld nuclear missile launcher
---
I used beserker, but I have the grounded mutation so I lose out on full damage.
---
Nocturnal gave me very inconsistent numbers, at dead midnight one time I got +60%
---
That's the only thing I could think of
---
Also wonder if the tokens can be traded ??
---
Thank you üëèüèº
---
It's always been this way. Was harder to notice when the pool only went up to 200 caps.
---
Thank you !!
---
.45 for my only silenced gun, but I took an hour or so last night and went a'scrounging with good results (looked up where to find lotsa lead) and ended up crafting about 500 bullets. Just got the perk where you make 80%  more ammo, too. Hope I'm in the clear now.
---
Nah, I died at Drop Site V9 and respawned at Drop Site V9 and bee-lined straight for my bag.  It was still next to the grounded SBQ that killed me in the first place.  I couldn't have gotten there any sooner.
---
I'm not angry or anything, but from a "wasteland justice" standpoint, there are a couple things about the bounty rules that strike me as protecting the ones doing wrong.  Stealing someone's bag when you actually see them do it is one.  Likewise, seeing another player troll and murder a low-level player (likely through Workshop PvP, which gives them a free pass to do anything) and not being able to stop it without getting a bounty on your head.
---
I mean, maybe the solution is to just take the bounty and let them know what you think.  But that gets into the whole "Who's going to clear *my* bounty?" problem, and having to stand around waiting for someone to murder you, and likely take more Caps than the thing you're fighting over.  Heck, it could even be the guy who committed the wrong in the first place.  So, it's just not worth fighting back most of the time.
---
Try just keeping 2 or 3 stars and under 5lbs and lvl 50 having a 1 star lvl 40 gatling gun isn't worth it. But a lvl 50 3 star junkies rolling pin is something to keep
---
Spoken like a true communist. I don't have X so nobody should have X. This is the reality you choose by not adapting to the current situation. Deal with it, its not going to get any better for you anytime soon with this attitude. Bethesda isn't just going to remove all legendary weapons, lol imagion the outrage that will caused by that.
---
Diseased covers up legendary. So if you get a legendary drop from a diseased mob it is because that mob actually is legendary, just the diseased modifier covered up the legendary modifier on their name.

---
Kill everything. Just run around places with lots of enemies and go crazy
---
Did you make sure you installed the prereq mod for the text chat mod?
---
I leveled until 60 only in the Gold Course. That means that I have way too many springs.
---
700 pounds in my stash, ~600 on myself, pretty much everything is 3*... walking from Whitesprings to WestTek takes about 12 minutes.
---
I need that bloody vendor so badly so i can finally get rid of all that crap
---
I began saving 3* items on april 1st... If i managed to survive 1 month i'm sure i can handle one more.
---
Anyway, as far as i know player shops are scheduled to come a bit sooner, that will also help me a bit.
---
The gauss is not a legacy now. They do ballistic damage not energy
---
I have a TSE one
---
‚ÄúWon‚Äôt line up‚Äù

That‚Äôs totally true.
---
It‚Äôs also incredibly sad that our poor Gatling guns have sights ... that don‚Äôt point where you are going to hit.
---
Cowboy sounds like a quickdraw type perk in my opinion,   clubber has to be a strength perk for melee weapons ,   
---
Briefcase Bloodhound is something to do with searching suitcases i assume.
---
Me either I'm going to do it later tonight if you want join them and do it
---
Man, that is awesome. What's it gunna cost me? I've got some trade fodder too.
---
I've seen a hollowed out log before south of Flatwoods with a lot of stuff in it.  Never saw it again and puzzled me for a while.  Apparently, it's a random encounter.
---
You can either do the new Free Range event, or I have found that they seem to spawn consistently in the Cranberry Bog nearby to Sundew Groves. (The big pink trees in the Bog)
---
To avoid any abuse of the system they can just make some perks passive. For example Hard Bargain x3 should require at least 3 Charisma but doesn‚Äôt have to be equipped.
---
&gt;In caps... thank you.
---
Ohhh sorry we only provide prices in spoiled food. Wish we could help
---
Yeah. Bashing and throw grenade needs to be unbound too.  Shits dumb.
---
Not too sure how much it‚Äôs worth so offer a cap price and other explosives
---
I started ditching all bad 1* items, only keeping 2* and up. Just too much
---
This is the one time where Captain Obvious was sorely need. Thank You Captain lol

Congratulations! Eat it before it spoils..

Oh okay, well i have plague walker so i devour spoiled food, i will keep you in mind

Light metal arm plans are frequently found near the armor workbench to the left, facing the front of the church in Flatwoods. 
---
If you are on PS4, I'll gladly drop them for you.
---
It's frustrating, for sure. I used one and eventually was able to shoot around people.
---
Just keep using it and you'll get more
---
 accurate.
---
Claim and defend as many workshops as possible and if you cant defend you can always retake you will get great xp,plans,and junk. Also dont forget to team up with anyone for the xp boost from the cha perk. Get well rested. Do feed the people event for the cans of food that have xp boost. Also the path to enlightenment event awards xp boost. And finally leader bobblehead. And play as much as possible this weekend double xp
---
Pop in at Beckwith Farm and walk to the BBQ. Spawns every time for me if you walk to it. If you hop at the BBQ it wont always start.
---
Berserker isn't viable, period. Even less so with Power Armor. Not only you wouldn't receive any bonus damage, you would *lower* the damage of the weapon.
---
You're going to do like 3 damage there is no way to run resistance and get anything out of a berserker weapon.
---
I do One Violent Noght whenever it pops up and I swear one time it spawned at least 200

I‚Äôm having to run around in escavator with calibrated shocks just hovering below the limit and the stash full. Have about 25 3 star and 1 4 star stashed. No room to move - ha ha. Have a nice Ultracite armor with Calibrated shocks and motion assist and can‚Äôt use it !!
---
It‚Äôs not a smart phone. Do you know what a ball ache self portraits are with a shutter camera? You gotta setup a tripod, use a timer or a remote trigger for the shutter.
---
Really wish we had any other options. Maybe in a few more updates?
---
Thanks for the reply, quite a strange thing to encounter be sure to post about it if you see this again.
---
So, my rule of thumb is A: is it in a place where it seems like they want other players to find it? and B: is there a variety of stuff?
---
A bag with a bunch of Spoiled Meat and a TSE?  That may have been an accident.  A bag with a bunch of Legendary armor and weapons somewhere around a train station or shop?  That's intentional.
---
Always bugged me that we can only wear one boxing glove
---
Ehh, pricing will work like this: "How much am I willing to part with this item for? Didn't sell? Do I want to lower the price, or wait longer?" and for buyers it'll be "Am I willing to pay this for that?"
---
When you are leveling up, you first choose the special point to raise, then it let's you choose a park card from that special category. 
---
If you just slide over to another perk card category, without backing up and choosing to raise a different stat. That original stat you chose gets raised.
---
Example. You choose to raise strength. But you slide over to the intelligence perk cards and pick one of those. Boom, strength goes up, Intel perk is picked.
---
You need to back up to the point where you are choosing a stat to raise, move over to intelligence and raise it, then choose your perk.
---
Make sense?
---
Mix and match for better aesthetics and functionality to fit you play style.   Anything but excavator tbh.
---
Hear you on the shop. It will get you more caps. But raises the question if you have say 20k on you and try to sell 6k item. What happens? It‚Äôs going to be interesting!
---
Thats cool man you do you and keep cheating i will play my game the way it should be played
---
I have been having a glitch for my furious explosive gatling gun, that if i staart to shoot then go down sight quickly it gives me a crossair and the bullets hit the dame place bo matter what. Try that. They might have fixed it but it was good to have.

I'm not on now but watch for me in game. I've got 2 extra jet packs. I'll give you one no charge. My gt is DreddedOne

Berserkers good for nuke zones I feel with a hazmat suit

That's really interesting... I always see the mothman spawning on overlooks like this. I wonder if you've built over an existing spawn spot, or he dynamically finds them.
---
Really? Awesome! I‚Äôll send you a friend request

---
This made my coffee that much more enjoyable. They say dreams have a meaning. I wonder what yours was trying to say.
---
Sure, GT Mo0kish
---
Is this populated from observation or from game source? I can see things missing
---
You left out that the pond is filled with Mirelurks, and that the location occasionally gets attacked by a Scorchbeast from the nearby Fissure Site. Still a good location, but not perfect. (I had my old CAMP by the stream next to it near the broken fence)
---
It would be nice tho for PvE, especially us Melee-Strength build when fighting a scorchbeast. Those flying fucks never land, switching perks from melee to heavy guns would give us a better fighting chance. But yeah I get your point.
---
Top of the world armor benches are your best bet. 3 plan spawns, and 4 possible armor mod spawns.
---
I know I've seen those plans there.
---
I'm not planning on finding that out. 
---
I still have to buy all serum recipes and a bunch of other CAMP plans, i'll try to get rid of my caps before reaching 20k
---
Psn Rolyat991
---
Hope he likes it!
---
That would cause so much lag. They got these servers out of the back of a van from a rest stop in New Jersey. They can't handle that kind of cross checking.
---
Yeah the mirelurks aren‚Äôt a problem as only 2-3 spawn but scorchbeasts suck. The normally get distracted by the robots at white spring though
---
Yeah not sure. Like I mentioned, he spawned next to it yesterday and today I found him like this.
---
Perhaps tomorrow he'll be using my workbenches :p
---
I'm thinking the game is going to set the buying and selling prices like the normal venders have there prices set.
---
I‚Äôve sent a friend request.
---
There have been a couple limited time skins on the atom store. You can get the tricentennial skin for the 10mm. There was a camo skin for the pump shotgun but it left the shop already
---
Maybe the 25k barrier is raised? That would fix the problem so single character players are able to compete with players with multiple characters in the market?
---
I've Never killed a mothman
---
Can you kill a Mothman and get the loot? 
---
I encountered him twice but he always got way, leaving a sour taste in my mouth.
---
(Amazing pic btw)
---
Thank you good sir. 80 atoms richer
---
Heads up with Beserker. The lower your DR, the higher your damage. The opposite is also true. Power armour will likely lower your damage or gimp it all together.
---
Last I checked I had 22 or 23 to use. I‚Äôve just been playing around with different levels of perks.
---
Ah bollocks, I got the standard edition so no 10mm skin for me and definitely missed that shotgun skin. 
---
Hopefully they add more in the future.
---
Thanks for the reply!
---
Trading is a intended feature of the game. But I'll be enjoying pvp in the main time. Goodluck with your RNG you will need it.
---
What platform ? If Xbox I have a ton of metal mods on my alt and sell mods for 150 Caps. If you can‚Äôt find it in he world and need it quick I most likely have it on Xbox tho.
---
I've yet to not find a location using that guide. Not that I've done every map.
---
dont know about that but distant areas aren't dark at night and sometimes objects at a certain distance "smear" inside themselves
---
Yeah, you can. There also are friendly ones who don't attack you.
---
Oh yes I‚Äôve heard people said it causes weapons to degrade quickly, however I frequently use variants including TSE and TS no-E and dedicated E (such as executioner‚Äôs explosive minigun), the TSE version doesn‚Äôt really degrade faster than other variants, at least never to such horrendous level. Other TSE weapons can easily last a boss fight but this laser will die long before the boss shows up.
---
Depends on the event location it would be easier or more difficult
---
Break out the Dustbuster...
---
Thank you! I was thinking the same myself. It wasn't too sure. Cheers man
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/b5hqce/updated_map_of_random_encounter_locations/
---
I agree, I would waste a decent amount of money if they added more skins
---
No problem! You as well!
---
It does. I'm almost 700 hours into the game now and have multiple toons. I've never had this issue before. So either I've developed palsy and am unable to click properly (always possible) or something is effed up with that toon. I gave up on her and started another (double XP makes it sooo easy to level: Went from level 1 to 8 in just a couple of hours) and have not had the issue on the new toon (making palsy less likely). 
---
The one peculiarity with the effed-up toon was that I twinked her pretty solidly at level 2: I gave her a couple of hundred pounds of junk, aid items, some legendaries, some spiffed armor, and the attribute mis-assignment issue cropped up immediately. Bethesda, if you're listening, this was a deal-breaker for me on the toon it affected.
---
Love this sub player needs help not even a minute later they get it. Keep being awesome r/fo76
---
Nuke an area like white springs and have someone who is OP kill everything. Pick up legendaries only and bad average and good ones and only keep godly ones while waiting for monster reset.
---
actually they were removed from her drop pool with the last patch
---
I hear you - the spot by the wall has has them, too, which was handy since I'd get level-scaled enemies every time I spawned in. Nothing like FT'ing, just to have a bunch of lvl 68 Super Mutants trying to mow your CAMP down with miniguns, etc., but having it guarded by Assaultrons and Sentry bots.
---
As for the mirelurks, it's just the hassle of dealing with them. My CAMP is right next to Morgantown Station/Airport, and I've got level 1-6 Scorched constantly taking potshots. I can take them out easily enough, but eventually I come back home to broken walls, eventually a broken generator, etc. It's a pain in the ass, even though I love the location. I've seen people with that spot at the pond deal with the same thing, although it wouldn't deter me, either.
---
sorry pc

Glad to know I‚Äôm not the only one with so many

Happened to me yesterday, one guy says here here I‚Äôm standing in front of it, everyone was like no way, then one of the guys said ‚Äòoh now i see it, it‚Äôs right here‚Äô, but he was standing at least ten yards behind the first guy. Very confusing.
---
I don‚Äôt mind enemy spawns because I like the location, area and resources. Plus I like that there‚Äôs a shop. Morgan town is too far away
---
Incredible photo. Also I think Sparrow could use some RadAway....

And you killed him didn‚Äôt you? That poor defenseless creature was only trying to protect himself.

Sacrificing loot that is never checked, once a day or week , I am a religious follower, I gather many nuka colas, go to densely populated areas ( white spring) nuka grenades everywhere, never check a body . Must wear cultist mask and play soundtrack from the omen.

My first time I hid on the lip of the building behind the elavator while a schorchbeast attacked the roof
---
I hear you. Having the train station right next door is great for me, and I can imagine having the shop for when player vending happens will rule.
---
Hahah, nah he is running a bloodied build.
---
I'm currently saving points until I know how prestige will work.  If we get to keep cards, I'll spend the points ahead of time to get multiple tier versions.  I already have this for some perks ( seperate cards for ranks 1-3 of thru hiker and pharmacy, batteries included, etc. )  so that I can massage my build for my current needs.  There are, however some perks I only have maxxed and would like to have stepped alternatives.  Particularly for perks locked behind higher levels.  That way, I can potentially use high level perk cards incrementally at low levels when constrained by low SPECIAL totals (bloody mess, master weapon skills, etc.)
---
Yeah. It‚Äôs a great size too. I got a billboard stating what I sell and everything. I‚Äôm trying to find the best area to camp. It needs to be flat and have water. Whitespring is cool because it‚Äôs always got people there
---
That does look like individual weapon model issue then, worth opening ticket with bethesda
---
And I was only trying to become best friends and learn his wisdom :(
---
I've got a bug, exiting a terminal while completing a mission can sometimes cause the player to be stuck at the terminal. Quitting and rejoining the server makes all terminal screens go blank, but still usable. Player must then either close game entirely and reload or access terminals via pipboy (requiring someone else to be occupying the terminal).
---
When you level up, after you pick a stat point, you can scroll through all the different categories of perk cards to choose from.
---
You've definitely checked all the END cards?
---
Nice pic!  He‚Äôs scouting for his next target.
---
I saw one guy that had a megasloth,farm,and a junk extractor in his basement. It was pretty cool
---
Bet you‚Äôll be playing again in 5...4...3...2...1 lol
---
Trading for items you know to be duped is an exploit and there is no use in trying to make a petulant child understand that so bubye
---
Hey that's a good one. I got those mutations too.
---
The pistol IS the rifle. Switching between pistol and rifle is a simple matter of changing the stock.
---
My first time was balls in and guns blazin'! But that didn't go so well for me. Hiding, in my Mystery dress, worked much more efficiently :)
---
I am waiting for the day they do more rebalancing to deal with this issue. A max cap on armour reduction in pvp would be an easy way to deal with this problem. Otherwise what's the point of having any armour except Sentinel etc.?
---
No such thing. 
---
I'm sure you can find a power armor user to take them off your hands if they are a burden.
---
Everything you trade could have been duped does this mean you will not trade at all?
---
Try leaving the mothman camp items near the spawn
---
If you're going to snap your wrist, might as well do it in style. I'm also bummed out the sawn off barrel doesn't improve crits more like it did in 4. Oh well. :(
---
Alright, let me rephrase. I‚Äôve done One Violent Night a dozen times and the only legendary I‚ÄôVE ever gotten was for killing the wendigo. Happy?
---
Wow! Got it. Thanks.
---
Same is happening to me at West Tek when the super mutants are fighting the protectrons. "On XBox"
---
Ya thats photomode
---
Bumped into him in the Ash Heap. They were not happy.
---
Actually it spawns if you hop at BBQ, been having it happen to me when I hop there and no one else is around :).
---
It has always said am or pm for me...
---
Don't have any currently. But I'm considering to get some, so he can feel at home.
---
I thought it was on the metal crate in the back of the train car. That would explain why I haven‚Äôt found any in there before. I will inspect the crates better.  I play on a 98‚Äù projection screen so shouldn‚Äôt be too hard to find now that I know where to look.
---
Usually you wanna combo unyielding , not just a point on something.
---
As far as I know prices sky rocket once you have others in there as for this it would go for around 500 caps maybe tops
---
Explosive is 20%. Increase 20% by 60% and you get 20+12 = 32%
---
It's a 12% increase for 5 perk cards on single targets.
---
However I'm not saying it's bad, if you have a bloodied explosive gun that does like 1000 damage (Gatling Gun can get near this) the extra splash damage can be quite helpful against groups.
---
Other than that, yeah it's five perk cards, and it's really hard to justify over things like travelling pharmacy, travel agent, Lone Wanderer etc
---
It was a list of things... some big some small.
---
Smh, let the man enjoy something... 
---
Great story OP!  I'm level 75, never launched one.  You made me want to try.  Is it a good idea to give a heads up on fo76, or do people always just come?
---
I like the idea
---
Wow didn‚Äôt know this was a thing, thank you. Still annoying how you have to go to the internet just to do this and not in-game.
---
Kill supermutants
---
It's so weird, for me I have 310 hours played but have never once gotten addicted to anything
---
From someone who hasn‚Äôt played the game, but heard about Mothman a lot is he a hostile NPC? Most pics I see of him he‚Äôs just chilling wherever he goes.
---
Pretty aure the clock on the Data screen shows am/pm. Its just the physical one on the bottom doesn't, but i honestly keep forgetting that one exists and always check the data tab instead.
---
I think its still works
---
It's definitely not a sheepsquatch gauntlet, since in the game files it's called "Bear claw", or something like that. It'll most likely be introduced with the unannounced(no release date, but we know it's coming from the trailer) Arktos Pharma DLC, since that has a lot of similar quests that do involve animals.
---
Though I doubt it'll have to do with the Pioneer scouts, but hey maybe they're just that savage!
---
OP doesn't live under a bridge...... or does he......
---
15 minutes is a bit much people would just rage quit
---
I think half the problem is you can just respawn right next to where you died and pick up all your stuff and all your health goes back to full.
---
Respawn should put you at quarter health and make you respawn a decent distance away from your death and disable fast travel for 2 to 3 minutes
---
I just picked all the perks and try maxing them out. I really hit all the crafting ones first. Then combat boosts, etc.
---
unfortunately, this has been around for a long time.  I have it, too.  No word on when/if they will fix.  My hunch is that they won't/can't since it's a livable bug.
---
I just don‚Äôt accept friend requests but do like to trade. 75% of the time it‚Äôs a good experience but like everything else there are some idiots out there that want to hassle or grief or intimidate.  
---
I had a lvl 45 guy get all pissed with me because I wouldn‚Äôt trade my AA auto handmade rifle.  I mean, next to my explosive shotgun and prime 2 shot Gauss it‚Äôs like my best weapon.  It‚Äôs my go to weapon in survival mode. 
---
Anyway, this tool starts bouncing around down thumb emoting me and got aggressive and tried to make a move so I let him get a taste of the weapon he was trying to acquire.  He went down in a quick blast.  I then stood over him and gave him the thumbs up emote.
---
mu wife got me started on the game, the very first day she took me to flatwoods. We were in the tavern,  and i got pie. She was so mad, since then, i have gotten 4 more at various places  and she still hasn't gotten one. Every time i get one, I yell PIE!! and she gets madder lol
---
fwiw, she's also mad that i love the game and am now 30 levels above here :)
---
The best selfie spots are ones with your defeated enemies in them.
---
Yeah just scrap lots of pistols and you will get the plans to make it a rifle
---
Yeah because it's really hard to flip a camera around and hit a button. Selfies were a thing before smartphones, you know
---
I have Grognak and the Ruby Ruins, but won‚Äôt be on for another 8 hours (in Australia). If you‚Äôre around, what‚Äôs your price?
---
Yeah sort of; he usually just relaxes but when you get close he starts to defend himself. There are a few variants of the NPC, of which one or two don't engage they just are friendly.
---
Jesus Christ no
---
I used to have my camp in a tower on Seneca rocks, but a patch or two ago I started spawning under the map and falling to my doom on the regular, so I ended up moving.
---
Hmm okay i just tested it on feral ghouls,bloating ones, protectrons and a deathclaw didn‚Äôt had time to test on super mutants or in pvp  but non of these I tested worked :/
---
That's exactly it. We don't need a third way to do the exact same thing.
---
I would do just the opposite.  Let them know what you have in your stash so if they try to screw with you it‚Äôll be their untimely demise.
---
OMG CONGRATS
---
Just go to whitesprings and kill the friendly sentry bots. With double xp you get over 1k each kill. There are 3 there.
---
Well a good way to tell if it is PM is anytime after 1200 hrs is pm until 2400 hrs. For instance 1300 is 1pm and so on.
---
You may lose your saved pictures
---
I'm on. Currently sitting on the throne in the Burrows in adventure mode if you need the pic for the challenge
---
Ok! I don‚Äôt have a camera yet so I don‚Äôt need the pic
---
I'm thinking of doing the same. I scouted around the forest but I will probably end up camping along one of the rivers there. I wanted a spot where I don't have to worry about others taking the location on the server.
---
Same! I‚Äôve loved every Fallout game no matter what! What I like to do is set my expectations at a mid-way stance so unless the game is truly terrible, I will always get something better than expected! But like you said, so many people complain
---
Do you mean it froze? Because that's what happens when you trigger the animation when you insert a fusion core. Also how did you lose those power armors?
---
Don't complain or they'll make it overly easy.  Sit on the house and rip them up!
---
The updates did massively improve the game, but the game wasn‚Äôt all that bad to begin with
---
Not just that, you also lose your well tuned and well rested buffs which is pretty annoying
---
It's still alive. I will delete this post if it died.
---
Bethesda, we need to fight this swamp ponda
---
You can get a random drop at the relay tower near uncanny caverns.   If it's not there server hop
---
That was beautiful
---
Yea that‚Äôs what I meant my issue is it happens every time and that one time I was permanently stuck.
---
Sort by weight, dump your heaviest one-stars once you get new legendaries coming in. Only bother with modding higher-level legendaries to make them lighter, if you can.
---
I've found the body one time ever and it didn't give anyone loot. I've sort of stopped participating since.
---
A good strategy would be to mod all legendary armor to ultra light just to save space as well
---
And people say D.A.R.E. didn't work
---
It will be no good with PA. With no damage resistant you'll get 50% increase on weapon damage. I run Berserker with lvl15 Garb of Mysteries and Eye of Rah. This gives me 15 ballistic damage resistance and my berserker weapons now give me about 30% damage increase instead of the 50%.
---
I sell all my chems
---
+karma see you later tonight then
---
"Just....why?  Why can't I make friends?  All they do is shoot me...sigh"
---
I bought on steam and wish i hadnt. But after 1200+ hours i dont want to start over. Go with the official websitr.
---
I realized this well into my first character, now I have 5 points in strength that don't have a card slotted in lmao.
---
Random encounter just west of red rocket in ash heap.  Usually with albino radstag.  Had it show up twice!
---
Yes, they had marsupial. As soon as you get Starched Genes to level 2 you can keep mutations. You can buy them at the WS bunker, but there are people on here selling them much cheaper.  My GT is the same as my name on here, I‚Äôm happy to help you out any way I can üòÅ
---
Just occurred how to possibly solve player vending caps being overrun when selling from shop. 
---
Two areas to store caps. 25k you carry and may be 25k in shop. So when you set price in shop the total never goes over 25k for all items. So for example you have 10 k in your shop you can only sell items to value of 15k. So no conflict of leaving things for sale and overrunning the 25k limit on the player. When shop full you cant sell more items until you move caps to player if you have room for the caps.
---
I can craft you full lvl 30 heavy leather stuffed and pocketed, just need a bunch of adhesive. I‚Äôm not too worried about the rest of the mats.
---
Thanks man, I really appreciate it
---
Same here, just quietly soaking up information.
---
Would that apply to jumping as well?
---
I picked it up.  Hes the reason I got my Pentax K1000 and began shooting bwTmax.  Very cool
---
What about PvE? I don't know how many times I would have 95% to hit and miss a target 5 feet away.
---
Yup why you just need to toss a Molotov to tag them all. Then you get all the drops too.
---
Interesting info!
---
Have you done any testing on the "+250 DR while reloading" effect?
---
I've been trying to figure out if using a lever action rifle or pump action shotgun can effectively keep you at the +250DR for around 50% of the time while in combat due to being able to reload a single round and fire in quick secession.  
---
I have a pump action with the +250DR effect, but opening the pip boy in time to see the DR is the challenge. Thru some observational testing however, I can see a big difference in the amount of damage I'm taking versus a non-legendary pump action. 
---
My process has been to empty the chamber, reload a single round, fire, reload a single round, fire, ect... From the time it takes to reload and fire a single round is about 4 seconds, as it also seems that with mutations and mods which increase reload speed you can keep the DR effect active most of the time, and still deal an effective rate of fire. 
---
At first this effect seems like it makes a lot of sense on a weapon with a long reload cycle, like a black powder rifle, but at the expense of rate of fire. If the theory about the effect works then any weapon that doesn't force you to reload a full clip without extended animation could make pretty good use of it.  You roll into a fight with 400DR, it takes 2 seconds to fire a round, and then for 2 seconds it jumps up to 650 during the reload cycle. 
---
But the theory needs further testing and confirmation.
---
I had two show up. I didn't consider it lucky though because as usual they were both 1*.  After doing the event half a dozen times I would consider it lucky if you can somehow get a 3* to show up. I can't for the life of me figure out why Bethesda would introduce an event with a bullet sponges boss and have it spawn as a 1* 90% of the time.
---
Everything's already too easy. I tested how difficult it Would be to beat the game with only nonlegendary gear. It was a joke easy. About the only thing at all difficult is the imposter.
---
I'd like to add something. 
---
In the building south of the one in the video, called 'Smelter', there are stairs leading up to a room with a Power Armor Station, to the right of that, in the wall mounted cabinet thing, also is a BoS plan spawn. 
---
Just found the torso there, though I already had it so left it there to not make myself wait for timers.
---
Total mis understanding on everyone‚Äôs behalf :(
---
Nope, tried that
---
I have a spare plan if you're on xbox
---
Shoo, SHOO! Get down from there! No moths allowed on the patio
---
Fridge isn't microtransactions but okay
---
inb4 skins
---
If you believe that counts then your entire home is microtransactions. Workshop skin? Microtransactions for a utility.
---
Obligatory you had me in the first half
---
I have had 1 3* in the 20 times I have run it
---
I like the concept but this guys puts it into something that‚Äôs viable
---
What is your build? Melee? Rifles? Bloodied?
---
If there is nobody guarding it, it's not a transfer, because you do not leave your goods unattended for that reason. I know a lot of folks will simply drop "junk" legendaries like one star lead pipes. If they walk away, it's fair game, and I'll pick them up to hold for the future legendary vendor. Gotten a few goodies, too. Someone dropped a Explosive plasma gatling back before they patched them out and patched the durability. It's now my go-to for massive groups of little adds like those bugs that keep appearing during the cow escort, and for someone else, it was garbage.
---
Same here. Plus every corpse in Flatwoods had a blank holotapes on them.
---
I have yet to see this event with the real sheepsquatch. What‚Äôs it called?
---
&gt;I picked the spot because it was pretty as well.
---
High five! :)
---
Rifles.
---
It works better with PvE but doesn‚Äôt work how it should
---
Rifles
---
What does this mean exactly in-game? Like more plants grow or something??
---
It's 5 cards for 12% damage (single target) assuming you are only using a weapon with explosive modifier. There are many other cards to choose from, it's up to you.
---
It all works out for me anyways because I always say "I'm gonna clear through these maps today" and then they just sit in my inventory for a week longer until I say it again.
---
Do not attack the m√∂th
---
While bethesda doesnt officially support mods, it's possible to mod your game only \*because\* betehsda allows what is called "file override", which is the core framework of modding in other bethesda games (fallout 3-4/skyrim).
---
In short terms: mods it's not supported, but the game framework allows mods.
---
If they don't want mods, they just have to disable the file override.
---
It's Ansel or Anne I think. The holotape and camera are on their body - not next to it. Wrong dudes.
---
Just be sure that when you find the junk pile/invisible body with your camera, wave everybody on over so they know you've found it. Oh and say hi to everyone in Charleston when you land.
---
This would defeat the purpose of "cards".
---
Yeah for me he always spawns on some cliff overlooking me and then just poofs away like smoke. I‚Äôve never fought him yet as he hasn‚Äôt attacked.
---
Are you maxed out on perception? How about luck? Do you use VATs or crits? There are several cards in luck that will increase your chance of filling your crit meter, doing more damage with crits and weapons overall.  
---
I am a bloodied rifle build but even without the bloodied effect, I can take things down pretty quick due to crits and armor avoidance.
---
5 points for such a miserable damage are a huge waste in my opinion.  I turned those 5 points into 2 enforcer and 3 adrenaline and that was a big change in damage output/versatily.
---
In strenght you can use incisor(anti armor is better than 12% damage) and so on....
---
Np. Hope this one works out for you
---
Per - 12  
---
Maxed rifleman and tank killer  
---
Luck - 14  
---
Maxed 4LC, better crits, Reaper, starched genes, class freak
---
Wish I could come along but I'm at work for a while yet. I have some keycards to burn through so maybe we can group up this afternoon.
---
Slowly replace the higher weight items with lower weights. Calculate the weight-per-star for items and place accordingly. Consider grabbing weight reduction perks if there are specific weapons you tend to find if you are willing to give up the damage/survival gains.
---
Like others have said this is a pretty long standing bug that appeared around the time of the first few patches. It's a really annoying bug too because it triggers regardless of whether your target is fighting another player or a npc. 
---
From what another player told me they never even saw my sneak multiplier damage register on the enemy I tested the bug on, they only saw my normal none multiplied damage. 
---
Since my build is based around sneak damage I often feel like I'm not much use in team events or fights, since my damage is never multiplied, so in a depressing way it sometimes feels like the game is trying to keep me away from other players if I want to sneak effectively...
---
Found it at Philippi Battlefield Cemetery right at the entrance eof it
---
Question about the two shot damage multipliers (without explosive)
---
Are you saying that adding attachments/mods to the gun  reduces the amount of damage of the second projectile? Or it just doesn‚Äôt scale with mods?
---
Are you better off leaving a two shot weapon as-is?
---
I've had camps along the road that goes south out of Harper's Ferry. A pot of players pass through the town now that burrows is out, and it acts as a great free fast travel point to that side of the map. And the river is nearby. 
---
Plus, I love the atmosphere of the swamp. It feels a lot different from the other zones.
---
Just found it at Philippi Battlefield Cemetery
---
What if the timer was only if you wanted to rejoin the same server?
---
I‚Äôve killed around 20 all 1 star so far. Haven‚Äôt seen a 3 star yet.
---
yes, it's a flaw definitely. 
---
Other online games went that way and blocked the possibility (I remember the early days of world of warcraft, we were able to swap gear in combat) 
---
I think swapping cards should not be allowed 'in combat' or 'while enemies are in proximity'.
---
(+ the game framework is ready for that, since all those conditions are already there).
---
It was to my understanding that explosive shot doesn't work on the laser weapons because they don't actually fire a projectile.
---
Oh. I added you, tell me when you're on. Do you need  something?
---
That is fine with me. I wasn‚Äôt the one to launch it. Just in the server like to post them. I has been awhile seen I launched one but I am down to do so. Just message when you want to start the I‚Äôll get the codes.
---
If you are spec‚Äôd for rifles, stick with rifles. I‚Äôd be surprised if you didn‚Äôt have a combat rifle or handmade or lever action that (with your rifle perks) didn‚Äôt outperform your gatling.
---
Or ideally, a quad / fire rate gauss. Toss on a bit of AP on the mag/capacitors + tank killer and that should do very well. Hell even a railway.
---
Better than trying to carry a gatling; use the perks you have!
---
So this is predicated that you use VATs and crits.
---
You could add 3 to perception for concentrated fire for VATs.  I'd also add bloodied mess. You could run a mix of reaper and psycopath/4 leaf clover to increase your crit fill chance while also increasing AP refill chance.
---
I really have 0 use for strength other than for blocker and 1 point for the ammo weight perk.
---
Two shot adds base damage to the weapon. Mods and two shot always increase damage overall, two shot just doesnt get benefits from mods, which is why saying its a 25% damage increase is often wrong. Still, having both is the best option
---
It did earlier
---
I mostly okay alone. I can't get anyone I know to buy and play with me. I have these moments alot. And I always think about ok it how much cooler it could be with a group /tinyviola
---
Always felt I got by ok after the nerf but now I'm just ready to accept its a complete waste
---
I heared they spawn more often in the wild as 3*
---
Did you change the controls on the washer and dryer machines?
---
Interesting, I'll actually have to look around and test this one myself. From the way it appears,I think your theory is probably right as the effect seems to work as intended
---
I'll do it for free.  May need some mats but probably not.
---
My psn is joepescilaughing
---
I get that happening to me a lot. I think it's more common when you have more than 1. I believe it happens when you try to reclaim them to quickly, like the game doesn't know how to register it. The way I fix it when I lose some is always rejoin the most recent players in that tab and they'll be right where u left them
---
That a great pic.  Talk about luck
---
Ok. Apologies but what am I looking at and what is the significance?
---
Odds are, they maxed out both their vendor cap limit and carry weight, so they're dumping crap to farm more crap. I just dropped 15 \*s for that reason.
---
Just curious, what Gatling gun is that?
---
no
---
I‚Äôve killed them in the wild as random spawns and in the event itself. Hopefully I‚Äôll find a three star .
---
supposedly one of the hardest rarest hype train for a month enemies you‚Äôd think they‚Äôd all be 3 star.
---
Try that and it‚Äôll probably work, the settings are on the note to the left of the machines.
---
On now
---
Oh now
---
I mean maybe if you didnt have a certain amount of points in strength, every shot inflicts damage with the perk equipped
---
If you havent already, the main quests give a ton of XP, and even more during the current 2xp weekend. The first few quests in the Mistress of Mystery Questlines are easy and give lots of XP. 
---
The lying Lowe Questlines goes fast and give even more XP than the last two things I mentioned. 
---
Make sure to do any public events that you think you can quickly finish. Double xp adds up here. 
---
Finally, if you're a higher level, just run through some locations and clear out ghouls and super mutants. Each one gives a couple hundred xp, and it adds to fast when there's 40 enemies
---
As for the missile launcher, the damage numbers in the pip-boy often don't account for legendary effects at all with energy/explosive weapons. I have a TSE Laser gun that apparently does the exact same damage as a normal laser gun, yet in practice obviously works as intended. It's a wierd bug that I'm looking into at the moment
---
ive always assumed it was
---
Enemy Attack -&gt; DR -&gt; % Resist -&gt; Damage taken
---
Doesn't the note only refer to the dryer?
---
Oh cool so many XPs, i would enjoy that, but protecting 3 brahmins against tones of enemies is not so enjoyable.
---
Has anyone else been having trouble with the Sheepsquatch getting stuck on things in the enivronment? It wasn't for the new event, it was fighting a handful of glowing mole miners at an unmarked campsite by the nuclear disposal site before I walked up. It was like his hooves(?) were trapped in a barbeque.
---
My suggestion is to turn off DLSS on the nvidia video setting. Download the geforce experience software for simple setting &amp; update.
---
What system?
---
YEAH! Who won the lottery? I DID!
---
Smell that air! Couldn't you just drink it like booze?
---
Thank you for the clarification on the Anti-Armor mechanics, I'll have to update that section. Also, I had no idea about those specific quad and 90% reduced weight gimmicks, so I'll add those as well, thank you! (:
---
I can't kill 2bosses and 20mobs in 20seconds, i which they kill my cows :( 
---
I don't want it easier, just better balanced to count of players around.
---
Pick up every weapon from every enemy you can find, take the Scrapper perk, and scrap them.
---
Farm supermutants and scrap weapons with Scrapper perk
---
Blackwater mine, next to Whitespring station. Clear the outside, dismantle at Station, server hop. Also can catch uranium fever if it starts
---
Ps4
---
Sure thing good sir
---
The washer needs to be set, as well.
---
SBQ would cost you like 15k 5mm ammo solo. Thats not so easy.
---
Other games have a death-debuff that goes away after a timer. Something like a reduction in SPECIAL stats, or more specifically targeted damage debuff (you do less damage), etc.
---
I like the idea of more consequence. Dropping junk is only scary at lower levels, and annoying at queen when it can be some flux but not much of a hindrance at for higher level players.
---
I‚Äôd also like to see a perk card in CHA that is either (a) active or (b) works with your team where you can revive someone w/o any penalty or take their penalty away.
---
I know what you mean.  There will be times when I fight her and the "power fart" just outright kills me.  And other times, I take no damage at all and I can stand there all day whacking at her legs.
---
I suspect what happens, in my case, is that the constant radiation damage causes Dodgy to suck away all of my AP, such that when she does her attack, I have no mitigation against it, either because I have no AP of Dodgy, or because the game is lagging and forgets to refill my AP.
---
Put it in your stash and hope like hell the legendary vendor lets you kill that prefix and replace it with something more useful.
---
Dang. I'd be happy to play with you but unfortunately I am on Xbox. I hope you find a squad but if not, the flowers smell just as sweet alone!
---
Talk to your postal service and have them forward all your mail to your new address.
---
I think getting rid of the starched/class freak is a non starter for me.
---
Way too used to my mutations now
---
\+250 DR while reloading have Big bug now 
---
If you reloading weapon while standing. It give you +250DR while reloading 
---
but you finished reload -250DR and disappear 1st legendary option too
---
ex) Bloodied, junkies...
---
I think there's a good amount of enemies for a larger group, but I agree stuff jumps up too much for just two people. I wind up running solo 80% of the time anyway, so the best bet to actually complete the event is to do the one at Aaronholt.
---
Ok ill add you now
---
Oh I wouldn't get rid of them.
---
Todd.  Go to bed.

I am learning SLR photography as a hobby right now, and Slothy there is right. There is a reason most photo albums don't include "selfies" pre-2000. It's much harder to take a "selfie" when you don't have autofocus options, have to keep perfectly still because of the lack of anti-shake systems, and have no screen with which to aim the damned thing. The Fallout universe has none of that. Yes, with an old film camera, you *can* take a selfie, but it's almost certainly going to be garbage because of one of the above issues. Never mind that, with the lack of digital photography, actual film has to be used, which means you won't even know its a garbage shot until you got it developed some time later.
---
I can still never find him.
---
Fo you have plague walker, each tick of that is like a weapon attack in terms of stealth, giving you away.
---
I'm at artisan's corner. You sure you want the ammo capacity mag and not perf or piercing?
---
Build looks good...
---
I would swap out Gun Fu for something else like sneak perks. It really isn't that useful in PVP when most fights are 1v1. Odds are against multiple opponents you would die before triggering the damage bonus on VATS swap. Pretty much the same reason why Adrenaline Perks don't work that well for PVP either. 
---
Another thing to be wary of is how much AP your automatic weapon uses. With the luck perks in crits you can get it to be super effective, but target and action point management becomes tricky. If your goal is to engage most of the time in VATS then you want to make sure you have enough AP and refresh so you aren't running out before you finish a clip. 
---
Also, if you are going to be VATS focused on offense then you may want to swap out dodgy, which goes back to the AP management issues with automatic weapons. Dodgy will drain your reserves pretty quickly. It is perfect for non-Vats PVP builds, but when your strategy is to be VATS offensive then you want to use all of your AP towards offense. I've found Evasive (non-PA builds) is actually pretty effective in absence of something better, or secret agent if you are using stealth boys. 
---
Not sure how effective covert operative will work without sneak perks. The moment you show up as a pip on someones compass you are no longer sneaking, so the damage bonus is wasted. Personally I am not even sure it works in PVP because I've never gotten sneak bonus damage on a stealth attack, so I stopped using it. Sneak is still good though as it allows you to get the drop on someone. Stealth Boys and Berry Mentats are your friends... 
---
Tormentor is another one I would consider swapping, only because most of the time PVP builds have Adamantium and at only a 15% chance Tormentor just doesn't do enough to matter in PVP. I would throw in class freak instead so you can reduce negative effects from mutations.
---
Looks awesome and great job placing all the items they look like that's where they belong and not out of place. Are there any enemies that spawn here.
---
What is perf exactly
---
It is. I'd need at least 60 more damage points to consider investing 5 points. My handmade gets like 8....totally worthy.
---
Everything turns purple for me whenever I load in
---
Perforating magazine. It ignored 40% of the targets armor.
---
I don't play the market, but if I was looking for something like that, I'd expect to see a range between 2-3k, although I *personally* would not buy it for more than 1500 based on how I value things on a personal level. Supressor's and Weightless are not huge drawing points, and \*just\* explosive isn't that huge of a deal. Not saying it's not cool or useful, just don't think you'll get premium pricing now days.
---
That said, again, I'm not big on the economy in this game. Consider checking /r/fo76bazaar or /r/fo76marketplace
---
Ah I think this and swamp itch are the only ones I've not had so far. Cheers OP.
---
So bloody mess instead of 4lc?
---
The legendary sloth at the end of Fasnacht definitely wasn't tho?
---
What are the armor piercing stats
---
hey man was wondering where the shards plan dropped for you
---
Just the odd liberator or lvl 5 super mutant
---
Zelda had a selfie mode in Wind Waker HD.
---
I dont think photo modes in video games care about the pictures logically being clear based on the type of camera.
---
That's happened since beta. Can't move after entering/exiting power armor.
---
Usually fast travelling to my camo fixes it.
---
If that doesn't help, gotta restart the game.
---
Nothing you can do about the disappearing gear unfortunately.
---
So when is the patch coming for camps not being destroyed in Adventure mode when pacifist is on and not in PvP?
---
Rofl, I went with melee, cost nothing but some shotgun shells to cripple her wings.
---
Awesome work!
---
 Scrap weapons and as a bonus you can learn mods
---
I loved buiding here I always try to encorporate an existing structure somehow when I pick a camp spot.  
---
you can also camp on the building across from the red rocket in flatwoods
---
The types of mothman:
---
Wise:  Deredere Mothman
---
Stalking: Dandere Mothman
---
Vengeful:  Tsundere Mothman
---
Scorched:  Yandere Mothman
---
Glowing:  Kuudere Mothman
---
Sheepsquatch horns are better than Deathclaw horns. Change my mind
---
I only learned this watching my girlfriend play. I routinely back all the way out of menues so I never had that wtf moment. But she would do it all the time and we finally figured out what was happening. 
---
There are so many mechanics that the game just doesn't tell you about.
---
I like how I see the same people posting nuke launches here. I see you, dookie, and a couple others. We are a ragtag nuke group of sorts.
---
Came upon this comment and post after googling this hat. Mind crafting me one? Also on xbox, and I don't mind paying
---
Luckily it hasn't happened to me.  Where there any other possible factors at play as well?
---
Are these available via plans or learned via scrapping?
---
That explains why two days in a row of fighting the SBQ I got nothing at all.
---
Nah, SBQ attacks are so week. Only times I die during that event is by my own explosive bullets. It needs to be less bullet sponge and have stronger attacks. Specially the charge attack, that one should be one hit kill. The same with the sheepsquatch. They need to be scary. Like the sheepsquatch imposter and the yoi guai y don't want to be hit by those melee attacks.
---
As far as I know of, just plans dropped from the event
---
Thanks mate
---
No. And it‚Äôs bs. I got a couple but wanted them all. Guess it‚Äôs a thank you for the early players from Bethesda.
---
I have 20k 45ammo and run a Tse lever as my carry gun.
---
I like it!!  You get the look of the X01 - but the carry weight of the excavator.  Consider it a serious upgrade to your X01 carry weight.
---
Cool story.
---
Wish I'd thought of that. My tactic was hide in the room just under roof, shoot any robots that came near and hope. It worked.
---
Some of them are mods for the other weapons, not weapons themselves.
---
Not really sure, it does happen the exact second I consume it though, so it's definitely correlated. It might be if I click it enough to fall below 20% HP and trigger Nerd Rage. That's purely a guess from memory though.
---
Here is what I have. You can swap out serendipity if you are not bloodied. My crit meter fills a little slower than when I had 4lc maxed. I would experiment a bit and maybe run 2pts here instead of 4.
---
Starched Genes (2)
---
Class Freak (3)
---
Bloody mess (3)
---
Better Criticals (2) - if you have a 50% crit damage weapon, you could run 1 or 0 here depending on how much you depend on crits. I do feel like there is a cap to damage.
---
Serendipity (3) - swap this for 4lc  if you aren't bloodied
---
Psychopath (1)
---
4lc (1) - I may be increasing this to 2 and drop psychopath since psychopath is more of a PVE csrd than PvP.
---
Yes it‚Äôs very specific issue on the laser, not with other explosive weapons, not sure what a ticket can do but will give it a try. It‚Äôs probably intentional not an accident/bug.
---
Yeah, both. The calendar will only be interactive with if you have set them right.
---
Lets just make then big flying plushies that heal and spew rainbows and give hugs. /s
---
Thanks! Yeah lots of different posts anf opinions on here, overall though seems like the game is improving which is so good to hear. 
---
I'm gonna try it out with a buddy (pretty sure he's gonna get the game this weekend). I really hope they get something going for pvp and don't just abandon it. Even if it were zone or weapon restricted I'd still like to see it somewhere.
---
Can you wear a hazmat suit while fighting Scorchbeasts?
---
The main thing that annoys me about the fart attack is that it hurts you even if you‚Äôre inside a building or underground.
---
Yep I do see the same few. Just trying to make sure we have the people needed to complete the events. I don‚Äôt like when we fail.
---
I dont feel it needs a nerf, just make sure you arent in the fart zone. Scorchbeasts are annoying in general. They are bulletsponges and not that much rewarding.  I mostly avoid a fight
---
Even mothman gets sad sometimes
---
Only the ultracite receiver!
---
Thanks. Great insights. How about this?

The pistol attack of colonel gutsy is worse than the SB farts
---
Free Range. It appears in a few locations. The best one i know of is in the Savage Divide at Big Freddy‚Äôs BBQ Shack.
---
[More Details](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/bhcrsn/free_range_event_is_now_live/)
---
That might be it or at least increase chance of it happening.  Maybe do some experimentation with that to see.  PC are so different across the board it is hard to say what could cause it to crash. Mine was crashing Everytime I was transitioning from interior to exterior cells and restarting the computer.  I decided to put a larger power supply in it to see if gpu was causing a power Spike and now it's not a problem. I would just check your driver's and all the usual culprits and see if it changes.
---
I've thoroughly enjoyed reading the math on this. My best gun is an AA MG42 that some chump sold to watoga. Kills a 65 Sierra Bravo in about a whole clip or less, or as I like to call it, less than 5 seconds
---
nope. better sights would be greatly appreciated though.
---
I server hopped at Wavy Willards, because the spawn point is only a few feet away from the body location, but check that link Mikewoodsays shared, might be more efficient time-wise to go along with that (took a long ass time to find it via server hops)
---
Thank you for the background info. I love details like these.
---
Ive had the white springs shop music in my dreams more than I would like to have. I also had a dream where a few ladies invited me back to their workshop for a few beers, and I tried to follow them but I was overencumbered.
---
I should also say I mostly use this for PvP and it works well. PVE wise, adrenaline is always a good choice as well if you don't have that already.
---
 Use the back door. The front one seems bugged.
---
The quills are used in a throwable weapon and the horns are used in a weapon. You need the plans that drops from the sheepquach to use them. I don't know if there is a use for the skull yet
---
Darn, I hate that I see this as I go through the front door.
---
Also, I‚Äôm not wedded to automatic. I could very well use a semi automatic handmade. What do you think there?
---
Are you using a Two-shot weapon? Because they have a greatly reduced chance to hit, but it does not show in the calculated number in VATS.
---
The horns and quills are for crafting weapons from schematics that can be rewarded for completing the new Free Range event. Maybe the same for the skull too.
---
Something I figured out recently is that if you don‚Äôt mind dying a whole lot and don‚Äôt care about picking up junk you can brute force an area with no stimpacks and minimal armor. At earlier levels that might be good for the Grafton steel mill. I haven‚Äôt tried it out yet but I‚Äôm planning on starting a new character soon.
---
Coward, hide in the scorchbeast nest like a real man!
---
But also on a unrelated note, have crashed before multiple times this week (on vacation, I have played a lot this week) and always a Super Mutant was nearby and engaged.
---
I feel like this has to be a matter of server rolls. I've also done this event countless times. Most times I get at least 6 or 7 one star legendaries off the mobs. Last night I did it and absolutely nothing at all other than the wendigo. 
---
I also ran white springs yesterday on two different servers and one run there were zero legendaries on any ghouls. The other I managed 2. 
---
However the night before I ran it and it was almost every other ghoul had one, even if not labeled. I think I walked away with 12 or so.
---
When he decides to leave he drops 200 caps and a poorly written note. "Than 4 let mouthmen stay on comfy hume"
---
Did you go way down in the mines though?
---
Distant scenery in my game, since patch 8, glows a light green at night.
---
which event specifically the one in the forest, savage divide or swamp?
---
On the rare occasion I've had two or three multi star legendary ghouls manifest during. It's not common, but it can happen.
---
Sometime back in beta some community manager or dev or similar explained it that the droids put 75% of the winnings away to the store "owners",  which of course will never collect, and keep 25% to keep trading with. So, if we could just find a way to rob them there should be plenty of caps stashed away!
---
I feel sorry for people who can't provide useful information to a question asked.  Maybe crawl out of your Ivory Tower where I'm sure you've never done anything that might be construed as a mistake or mis-step or social media faux pas, stop being so goddamned judgmental and either be part of solution or stay out of the way.  All you've accomplished here is spew out the kind of sanctimonious, online detritus that does nothing more than clog the free passage of information.  Sweet Jeebus, I bet you go the speed limit in the passing lane.  If you have nothing useful to add, just keep your self to yourself and let the adults talk.
---
Thank you.
---
Scrapping weapons from super mutants is pretty quick. I can usually get between 6 and 12 steel per weapon with the Scrapper perk equipped.
---
I don't want to spoil the solution but yeah, set both machines. You should have all the information available to you from notes.
---
Believe they fixed that in one of the last two patches.
---
The problem is that the fart zone appears to be huge, and there are times in which I am not amidst the green shit and I still take a lot of damage. And with a lot I mean that in 4 seconds 40% of my health is gone.
---
If you know how to farm caps, 288 is like 20 minutes of gaming... Maybe less if you don't like to distract yourself exploring
---
Yeah i noticed that too.  I mostly avoid SB
---
Yes! The inconsistency just makes it worse.
---
Don't think so, I'm still getting it every time during this double xp weekend
---
erm, no?
---
It's limited by server budget on their side.  
---
The more they give us the more it costs for them.    
---
There is zero item/data storage on client side once you disconnect, on all platforms for security reasons as well.
---
On PC I confirmed those effects stuck with me while server hopping to farm Free Range.
---
Been saying this since beta. At least 3. It's so easy and it's not asking for much. Agreed friend!
---
Go to the teacup just north of the poseidon plant and server hop. I found mine in 5 minutes.
---
Agreed. Same reason when i design scripts for the average user, i build in safety guards to avoid such situations.
---
Specially the TSE. @OP. If you fill up the critical shot meter and save it the VATS hit will greatly improve in PvE. In PvP VATS don't work as good.
---
Same. Not sure where to get swamp itch though
---
Sleep, drink cranberry juice, eat cranberry cobbler, consume(?) a leadership bobblehead, go to white springs, and kill everything. 
---
Is everything dead? Server hop and repeat. 
---
On top of the bonus this weekend you should be rolling in perk points before you know it!
---
They want us to buy atoms with real cash. Instead, i've learned to buy less from the store and not check it anymore. I've bought like 6 paints for my PA and i don't even use PA anymore.
---
That damn smile...
---
Nobody said that, what I said is that particular attack should: a) be mitigated in SOME way, be it gas mask, radiation resistance, explosive damage resistance, or a combination; and more importantly b) its area of effect should be clear and it should STOP DOING DAMAGE WHEN YOU'RE OUT OF IT. Optionally c) it shouldn't have effect when inside buildings or its damage should be reduced. 
---
Thanks for the constructive sarcasm btw, genius.
---
I don't understand the comment about anti-armor weapons having low damage per shot being more effective. Why is this?
---
My AAE handmade does about 130 per shot... Should I change back to the standard receiver for less damage to get more armor pen? This feels.. wrong
---
Also is it just me or do Glowing Wendigos look like the demons from the movie Demon Knight? Great film
---
I thought so it had, Self sacrifice, a voyage of discovery and the kindness of strangers.
---
What more could you want from a story
---
I agree. This is also my top suggestion to propose; however, the proposal is more of a "fix" as far as I'm concerned. 
---
I don't pick level 3 locks or hack level 3 terminals anymore due to the time and aggravation of equipping the cards (and then of course forgetting to re-equip the correct cards after). I've probably missed out on some decent loot. I've also missed repairing equipment to 200% and crafting bonus items and ammunition by forgetting I didn't have certain cards equipped.
---
I really hope they let us quick swap blueprints soon. As it is approximately 60% of Fallout 76 players have the option to do it. I'm not on PC anymore, but it seems there is a gray area policy with mods, like a case by case basis I guess. But if they're OK with Perk Loadout Manager, why not give to all players? Having Bethesda leave a comment to OP about this would be great!
---
You get this off of any mirelurk not just the hatchling and is does have a very low percentage of being recieved.
---
I agree in that a melee from the queen should tear you apart.
---
Even mothman needs to repair his armor xD
---
Thanks. I remember using a plasma rifle in fo 4, so I figured it had to be in game somewhere!
---
Try sleeping on a super mutants mattress
---
If you're actually asking if you can, the answer is yes, why not? But I don't think it mitigates the fart damage.
---
Good, but I'm pretty sure escape artist only works on npc enemies. The perk works by dropping you from "danger" to "caution" while within detection range or line of sight of an enemy. If you are within detection range of a player then they can physically see you so it won't matter. 
---
Since you are using VATS, and even with Sentinel you will still be running around a lot, so maybe Marathoner would be the better choice to conserve precious AP. 
---
Otherwise it looks good!
---
Thank you very much for the numbers, highly appreciated. Yeesh, that's a big nerf on the damage since it was 20% in FO4. Good to know though.
---
&gt; Stealth bonuses rarely do anything in an SBQ fight, IME, probably because you're rarely the closest opponent. 
---
Now THIS is very much news to me. Are you saying that when you are grouped up, the person closest to the mob determines whether or not you're in stealth, or that it determines stealth bonuses? That's a really punishing mechanic for stealth classes if the case.
---
Thank you again for the detailed info.
---
If you use aoe, does it hurt the brahmin?
---
I must be misunderstanding what you mean by fart damage. Are you talking about the low flyover with a stream of green radioactive stuff?
---
Thank you, this is almost identical to mine, just a few changes (like adding nerd rage and taking off gunsmith, and no "convenience" perks).
---
West tek server hopping

The PS4 and XB1 has a CPU  that has bounds. They  also has bounds for memory usage and video performance. It‚Äôs finite. PCs can be upgraded and therefore can run FO76 so much better. Check out the online PC videos and compare performance to the consoles. The bottle neck in my opinion is the performance of consoles and this limits what they can achieve across a 3 platform game in game in terms of function and performance. Having lots of items in the stash or on you means more memory usage in a limited allocated space. 
---
The back end servers I would agree use storage, network and CPU.  I can image our profiles are that large maybe under 50mb. The thing is loading your base and your character and your friends links takes a chunk of the memory on the console. This leaves so for the game to perform. Therefore more features and more items in stash etc etc the game experience slows as the console shuffles memory, network traffic and CPU to render it all. It‚Äôs not just about servers and storage. This is a client server relationship. The consoles are way behind the PC as a client for performance. This is or course assuming the user has paid lots for a fast laptop / pc with mega fast graphics, memory and storage. It‚Äôs very very complicated
---
Nuked borrows no rats inside but lots of ghouls
---
ha! different levels of cowardice I see ;)
---
I‚Äôm only joking :) Lol but there aren‚Äôt many I‚Äôve scrapped a lot and haven‚Äôt unlocked anything
---
agreed, 'perks loadout' would be a nice option.
---
I'd stay there. Looks like it could actually keep me safe from Scorchbeasts while I rest. It's an apocalypse. A pretty wooden shack is the last thing on my list. Throw in some security to keep other guests from robbing me in my sleep and we got ourselves a great post apoc motel. Make me breakfast, and you can call it a high security bed and breakfast.
---
I would try out the automatic build... with the proper combination of vats crits you could very well keep them staggered so they can't return fire, and that is how you win. Paralyze them with shock and awe! 
---
Concentrated fire can be a bit tricky too if your target is moving a lot because the % will keep changing. If you find that to be an issue you can switch it out for Ground Pounder which is a great perk for auto weapons.
---
I'll post some info straight from the data on how this all works shortly you're right on the money with some things and slightly off on others. As for movement speed there is a cap and that cap is not much higher than your current speed in order to prevent loading issues
---
I get this as well. But from multiple drunks (inert/raw flux/purified/dirty water) randomly. I only consume these from the pip boy and not the quick wheel. I will try adding inert to favorites and see if it happens. I too haven't found a correlation between consuming and crashing. I was thinking it was the sound clip it plays (gulp sound) that may cause the crash as I distinctly remember not hearing that specific sound on crash.
---
I repeat get good. If you‚Äôre getting outshot by a mini gun while you‚Äôre using a sniper there is something wrong. Maybe rethink your build or weapon. Maybe just don‚Äôt pvp if you‚Äôre going to cry.
---
Right every time I speak truth on this subreddit I get downvoted üôÑ

I‚Äôm actually reaaaaally let down about this. I haven‚Äôt checked my status and noticed much of any addiction related nerfs to my special stats, compared to Fallout 4 survival mode for me?

I agree. Everyone who takes part in the event should be able to loot every enemy that died since he joined. Yes sure, it might open up the possibility for someone to hide nearby and then just loot everything but honestly, i'd rather let someone do that then not get any reward for my participation because someone decided to One-Shot everything. I have a melee build so i typically don't get to tap weaker enemies since they already died by the time i make my way there.
---
I'm the guy the auto request your TSE handmade or Gatling gun lol
---
DMG is as important. If they one-hit everyone you can't tap them so you won't get any loot from the enemies.
---
I don‚Äôt have imgur haha. I‚Äôll do it tonight though so keep a lookout, or I may just post a video of it if it lets me! Be warned, I absolutely LOVE my camp haha

Normally, when you hit level up, a screen will pop-up that says "Pick a perk or nice a perk?" It could he you're clicking a button so quickly and auto selecting "pick a perk". Next time you level up, be careful to only press the level up button and nothing else.
---
I‚Äôve got over 600 hours in game. I definitely play the game. I won‚Äôt say the pvp does need work. But it is in no way a pointless game mode. The pvp is broken in every way meaning it‚Äôs still an even playing field just whoever is quicker wins typically. The repair kits pissed everyone off because we were told the atomic shop would be COSMETIC only. Do you know what cosmetic means? Because repair kits are not that.

Never do trade with random players, when they want to trade desperately you know they probably don't have the good stuff you want.

It would be more like, if I have a rifle and pistol favorites. when i switch to the pistol I hit a macro button and it swaps my perks to my pistol build, i empty my pistol, swap to rifle, hit the macro button and it swaps to my rifle build.   
---
Or maybe you start out sniping and as baddies get closer hit your macro and to your automatic build , favorite to the weapon and go to town.
---
the macro would just be a keystroke or two not opening windows and clicking neccesarily.  It

Idk I can‚Äôt move the map so nor can I zoom in and out so I assumed you can only hit Prime Fissure with silo near it. I‚Äôll try again tomorrow (It‚Äôs midnight here in Philippines)
---
I dunno man, i heard those things cause cancer.
---
I don't like this, mainly because all you have to do is unequip it then die. You lose little in the state you suggest (apologies, I know you said needs tuned, I'm just a critic at heart). 
---
Instead, I'd like something similar to...
---
 "Medical Madness: While equipped, all addictions are permanent, addiction chance is increased. Additionally, gain 15% damage for every addiction you have"
---
This is a very basic, bare-boned version; but it requires commitment. Removing the perk card will cripple you from the addictions until you die; which then will reset your bonuses until you become addicted to your drugs of choice again.
---
Levels 35-50 were a blur at WS. With the double XP, I imagine moreso.
---
That's odd because before I only pushed the level up button once and the menu didn't pop up.
---
Best chuckle ever

I'm sure to keep it from.being a farmable spot as the robots constantly get rebuilt.

That's definitely a bug. Restarting the game/serverhopping should fix it

Ok so DR over resist % thanks

Yeah I mean ik I hit that good vape but like cigarettes nah bro those are some cancer sticks

We need paint for all weapons period. Can't believe how clueless their management is. A gold mine has been staring at them yet they walked away to make emotes and tuxedos and 'repair kits'. Good artists but Dumb dumb dumb managers.

Saw someone mention in another post that it means someone has ran through there recently and it's spawn hasn't officially reset yet but is spawning because a new person is in the area.
---
Give more time between runs and it should give normal xp.
---
So I did the firefly thing and got the Friendly Mothman and felt Enlightened.
---
 Does that mean he will quit attacking me? I have killed him more times than I can count.
---
Everyone is at a already high level what does preventing people from farming it has to do with much these days? The nuke silos are so in consistent with enemies for me that if farming it was an option I don‚Äôt think I would. A few runs for me I face almost nothing inside the silos while on other days I can‚Äôt keep the chiefs alive because I‚Äôm being mobbed
---
Give it like another 2 weeks when they add some other good shit then you should be set until actual content drops in July
---
Are the challenges different for everyone? Because mine were super easy to do today given I already have the camera. Drink a Nuka Cherry, harvest Mothman Eggs, level up, and take a couple of pictures. The level up ones are super easy to do because the three requirements stack, so I just slap on some goofy gear or join a friend and level up naturally.
---
Lfg sbq farm - PS4
---
I got an enclave plasma rifle from one of the enclave events
---
Yeah once you reach above level 50 and mod your max level armor and weapons junk really becomes worthless it's so easy to just get more aside from flux.
---
Pretty much everyday I go to whitesprings and dump all my junk I'm carrying in the cash register.  Getting more junk when I need it gives me something to do in the game
---
Because of federal laws against tobacco use and making it "cool or appealing" to kids.
---
I use these machines every time I pass one. I've got ten pies sitting in my stash, and I've eaten a few for challenges.
---
Hi - if still willing I would like to get Marsupial, Demon Speed, Egg Head, and Bird Bones - 1600 caps for the 4 ?
---
IGN:  imfromolney
---
We come.
---
Why just why like you couldn‚Äôt sniff something that isn‚Äôt made of shit and acid like idk a dog or cat that‚Äôs cool
---
It‚Äôs a power leveling thing
---
Extra damage on top of the junkie legendary. That's a lot of damage.
---
Train station suitcases and lunch boxes are where I usually dump mine. Put 25k 45 and 22k 5.56 in the lunch box at Sutton Station yesterday. Whoever picked them up spray and enjoy.
---
Unfortunately, that option is not available.
---
Fallout 76 does not support ray tracing and/or DLSS, despite the my card supporting it.
---
I don't typically.  I thought if I did, that spawns mobs that can thwart the people trying to kill the queen?
---
Would this is explain why over half of the silo runs I've done have been completely devoid of turrets? I haven't done tons of silos, probably 7-10, think I dealt with turrets on two of those (not complaining, screw those turrets).
---
Ok I have a build similar to what you want. For melee you want first find what weapon you like best as in one handed or two handed. That would be the gladiator or the slugger card. Then personally I would work on incisor (for melee) and rifle man perk cards
---
15min is entirely too long. Maybe start with respawn as it is now and increase respawn time by 10 seconds up to 90 seconds for every death within 20min of most recent respawn.  After the 20 min your respawn penalty resets but during the penalty time fast travel costs are doubled.  If you hit 90 second respawn you deal -10% damage until the 20 min penalty period is over.
---
This puts a fear of repeated deaths in people who might otherwise stash all their junk not care at all but doesn't overly punish a single isolated death.  Between enemies being slow to load in, slightly misjudging how far a drop is, or being level 22 and having some random show up and make all the enemies level 68 there are plenty of reasons not to overly punish *every* death.
---
I was running through one of the buildings in watoga I think it was the robot Development Center whatever and there is an ashtray with like 35 single cigarettes up in there and I was like damn it now I need to go outside for a smoke LOL I mean if you're going to make cigarettes that prell event in the game where he can find two curtains in a drawer or a single and an ashtray you may as well make an a smoking effect like they have on their emotion wheel lol.
---
Kill stuff
---
Before level 50 there is no menu pop up.
---
After level 50, when you hit level up... The next screen asks if you want to pick a card or move a perk point.
---
You can move 1 point per 1 level.
---
Yeah I scrapped like 100 of the sherd thingy and nothing
---
That‚Äôs brilliant.
---
I've never had a kid come up to me and go you look so cool LOL usually their mothers cough and give me a nasty look. It's not the 80s anymore :-( though being a senior citizen is going to look a lot nicer in the future instead of being taken care of by minimum wage people that just got off a boat from some third world country and don't care if you live or die you'll just have robot sewer program to care and clean your wounds and bed sores maybe sing a little song! I could do that for a while.
---
I'd reckon this.
---
I was gonna say it is rated M so shouldn't really matter, but that implies 17+ and a good number of states have higher smoking ages (my home state of CA for example).
---
Everyone asks 'Where is Mothman?', but no one asks 'How is Mothman?'.
---
Are you initiating the trade or are they?
---
If you agree to trade, why make items you don‚Äôt sold or traded be seen via your inventory ?
---
I got it off a mirelurk king.... It is one of the harder to get yes but it isn't bugged.
---
I'd totally set up a 5 minute photo lab/ postcard giftshop. 
---
"Hang this in your camp today! 20 caps!"
---
They just need to make some sort of Mutbacco plant that you can make rolled Mutbacco sticks and smoke.  Maybe there's the answer.
---
I have the same impression, I've done the event about 15 times and always had it glowing to become legendary.
---
I did Uranium Fever last night solo and the entire event spawned maybe 10 mole miners. I went from there to AWOL Armaments solo and got a single colonel gutsy for all three waves.
---
It‚Äôs annoying as hell because I usually wind up taking out most of the Gutsys when I do the event in a group because most people just stand on the trailer with the button inside.
---
Our church ... in the middle of the street.
---
Thanks so much for the guide. I‚Äôve been putting off doing this... I figured I‚Äôd wait until it wasn‚Äôt such a popular thing to do. I got it on my first attempt today!
---
Pretty much everything is duped my dude.
---
Well..... clear the entire base(which wasn't easy....) and crashed again......
---
Gold gold goooolddddd
---
If say ditch shotguns for single melee, if you want stealth get up anything that increases stealth damage on rifles
---
Something I've been wondering about explosive weapons: does dense/fireproof affect 100% of the damage from these guns, or only the additional damage added by explosive?
---
Kill super mutants.
---
You could always give yourself some adrenaline in Agility.
---
I had a camp in Flatwoods right next to the church for quite a while, had a big neon sign reading "CAMP 4 N00BS" :P
---
Sadly that area is a no-build zone now :(
---
Actually.. i found reddit when googling for skyrim tips tricks and other questions. 
---
Read the memes the banter and enjoyed the atmosphere. 
---
And just like hotel California...
---
Cranberry cobblers or relish boost xp.
---
Gasmask man? :P
---
It‚Äôs pretty satisfying! I just launched my first too, solo, and literally screamed at the end... lol
---
Wes Tek and scrap all the weapons from the Super Muties with using the scrapper perk.
---
praise gErAldo!
---
May I ask with what gear? I got a 3* bloodied handmade on my first trip to the burrows, so after wondering whether to sell or stash it, I finally decided to try it out. After about 15 minutes of one- or two-shotting every enemy I came across, with a grand finale of five-shotting a mirelurk queen, I got bored and put it back in my stash
---
Thanks for the relevant info. Currently on some Cobbler as I acquire more sugar for the relish
---
I would take 1 more rank in bloody mess and bump travelling pharmacy.
---
Not a huge fan of tenderizer either. Just not much bang for your buck.
---
I like fireproof more than cannibal as well.
---
Overall looks pretty solid.
---
The tse laser is like a little explosive shotgun with a 21 round mag, very fun to use but breaks so fast. Bethesda needs to make them more durable, at least 5x longer, to be functional.
---
I dropped a huge bag earlier, i didnt realize the stash had a weight limit so I was filling the bitch, full pack rat mode. So I cleaned my stash, there is a bunch of stuff I don't wanna get rid of still but it's all so heavy.
---
These griefer prix can‚Äôt cut it in survival, so their pvp baiting. 
---
I fell for that same trick on my newbie a couple of weeks ago. Broke my own practice of 
---
1) block GT
---
2) Server hop
---
lost some mats but not the much needed ultracite.
---
I guess the honeymoon phase is over.
---
Seriously, I suggest blocking the GTs,
---
Slap damage causes no damage in pacifist mode.
---
Only when you respond, fights on.
---
Also, I think when every pacifist  continues to blocking griefers I think eventually, griefers will ONLY see other griefers. 
---
Through this reiterative ingame process.
---
That, sir. Is classy as fuck. Time to stock up on salt shakers and carry on your legacy.
---
The first time i used it i got a pie. I thought you always got a pie..... boy was i sad.
---
Honestly thought they don't work, haven't gotten a single meal from one since FO3.
---
Easiest way to do that is farm a bit of snaptail and make the sugar.
---
Ah but this was about death, my bad. Haven't tested that.
---
Does Tank Killer work with non-rifles? The card itself says rifles, I'm wondering if pistols and heavy guns can benefit from it as well.
---
I believe you can learn the muzzle break attachment from scrapping. Which is completely pointless because muzzle break is the only mod in its slot, and every single LMG you find/craft already comes with one attached. It is impossible not to have a muzzle break. Other than that, just the prime receiver from scorchbeasts
---
Since you mentioned nuking the sheepsquatch. Apparently nuking the Free Range event is a terrible idea.
---
https://youtu.be/nGKlQIkSl2U
---
Also the sacrificial blade mod for the machete which is one way to make '4-star' legendaries.
---
It's pretty easy, you just visit the website (nukes and dragons?) mentioned in the guide, and create whatever build you want.
---
Then you copy the URL to the build into Perk Loadout Managers ini file and you're good to go!
---
Ya gotta use em in fairly quick succession. Just popping one has like literally no chance of getting addicted.
---
Oh shit. i saw you in survival and tried breaking in.. nice base btw, i only blew up a wall and a door
---
Gewehr you mean üòÅ
---
You‚Äôre right it‚Äôs my fault my bad everyone
---
I would love to be able to make presets for crafting, fighting, and gathering.
---
i don't think that would go down to well with the players, with player trading we set our own price it seems likely that will continue
---
Very nice...last night I noticed the corpse is there but is invisible so the invis shimmer is there.  My mate was looking longest for it and found it once it became a metal pile.  Help yourself by scooping all the piles, helps narrow the search.
---
Someone needs a hug.
---
We do terrible things in games so we don't have to do them in real life: Stealing, Drug Dealing, Extortion, and even downright murder are fair game, but smoking? Guess we'll have to smoke in real life.
---
All one star right? Only the imposter is a three star drill dispenser
---
Fire proof instead of cannibal, serendipity in luck maxed has a 45% chance of avoiding dmg once you are below 30% life. Running gunsimith 5 is a little extreme I run gunsmith 2 and use demolition which bumps up Explosive dmg and nerd rage
---
Cant compete with explosive miniguns..... :D. Damn those things are brutally Bad. Get good and stop complaining
---
Mine are: 
---
Heavy weps (I exclusively use my gatling laser, gatling or 50cal)
---
"Normal", which is basically my heavy build without glow sight and stability, in favor of lockpicking and hacking.
---
Crafting, cheaper repairs and improved durability
---
Camping, 50% expense on building items in my camp, slow food and water use while camping etc.
---
Ive never been into survival in my life lol not risking it, and my door is always open!
---
Google alien blaster and you should find the correct alien.  hope this helps
---
I've got over 600 hours, and have killed a shitload of legendary robots. 
---
Interestingly enough, I've never seen the Sheepsquatch explode the same way other robots have. But eh.
---
That did the trick. Thanks for your help
---
Ive not come across another train that is so empty and level, totally golden spot
---
Thanks for your help. It did the trick.
---
Do you presently have any level-ups banked? Or have you already assigned all your perk points?
---
Yeah I keep trying to figure it out. I'm sure I'll get it working
---
Cheers it did the trick.
---
They kick harder than a mule if you've shot them in real life, no you won't enhance your life by firing a shotgun one-handed.
---
i could be wrong, since i never found out about it myself
---
Even though it‚Äôs better than fallout 4
---
I‚Äôm in the exact same boat as everyone else here. I‚Äôm on PS4. Tried downloading the plan from that terminal and still can‚Äôt craft it. Level 112 player here, and embarrassed that it took me this long to figure this out.
---
He has some sentinel assassins stuff I believe and as weapons he mainly uses a bloodied explosive vats 10mm smg or something like that.
---
Weapon sounds good, worth a lot probably, what are all the perks on it?
---
No, you just get 5% more exp for a limited time when you are Enlightened
---
Not an enhancement just more of a fun addition to the game for those of us trying to be mad max styled raiders
---
Selling 7 bulk copper with level 2 hard bargain gained me 340/370 caps
---
Anti-Armor is equally effective on everything, however, high amounts of damage OR high amounts of armor penitration eventually break through 100% of the enemies' armor anyways, so any extra damage or armor penitration after that doesn't add damage. This is only a problem vs things with low DR, and usually in that case you can kill them relatively easily anyways.
---
I love this, it‚Äôs so pure
---
I understand, thank you
---
Yea they should add it as a photo pose, whether you have a sawd off shotgun or not you can switch to that pose and one will show up in your hand, that will be really badass for selfies.
---
Is vaping a part of Fallout lore?
---
SMELL THAT AIR
---
Yea definitely though it still could be a nice addition to the game under strength perks. Maybe short barrel shotguns become more accurate the higher your strength is with the perk card equipped
---
bloodied, move speed while aiming, +10% damage while aiming. It was a pretty cool drop but I'll probably end up selling it when player vending comes because killing everything instantly is not my idea of fun
---
Yep. There should be turrets. So spawns didn't completely reset yet.
---
There's a mounted alien in the cryptid gallery...
---
yup
---
Want me to upload my ini file?
---
Didn't work
---
Doubt. As far as i know you can find just the alien blaster and rounds but no zetan alien itself.
---
oh I wasn't aware.  every 5ime I read up on it there was an alien nearby.  sorry I can't help more.
---
Yeah. I totally got the reference. Really cool imo.
---
Then that tells me we haven't gotten the update that adds Xetans.
---
Yes, but you didn't quantify your statement with "in a game." You smarmed about selfies being an easy thing that people did before cellphones, as if it's a normal part of photography, but it's not. Selfies are largely a product of the digital revolution, specifically smartphones and the ability to watch the screen to see what you're doing, and while they technically could be done before then, they generally weren't because the limits of technology made it more difficult than just setting up the stupid tripod and timer in the first place. 
---
Had you said "in game" the first time, I would have agreed, then pointed out that it's easy to take a selfie [with regular photo mode and the thumbs up emote](https://www.horrorgeeklife.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/rosie-roots.jpg), but instead you said something incorrect based on your perception of the current world and then [moved the goal post](https://yourlogicalfallacyis.com/special-pleading) rather than accepting that what you said is incorrect.
---
It shouldn't be very quick or easy. They need you ro buy atoms to continue support for the game.
---
Haha hilarious coincidence :D
---
100 caps ea?
---
Yeet, something else like Ap, health, ??? Regen per addiction would work. Maybe +50% drug effectiveness per each idk.
---
It does. Got a shot of sheepsquatch firing it's quills at me and the quills are mid air.
---
Def works in battle.
---
Reload the film. I've noticed several times, after taking a couple shots even before running out, I would have to refill the film before it would take shots again.
---
I can join but i‚Äôm on a camping trip so i‚Äôll be home   
---
around 18-19 UK
---
No, actually. Got a couple three stars. Sure, they dropped a three star machete I won't use, but still an oddly high number of legendary creatures for the species.
---
Even out in the wild, I am seeing mostly legendaries when they show up.
---
Two Shot Lever Action. Offer?
---
The stress is real
---
Sarcasm?
---
I'm not a cosmetic guy or build anything fancy in my camp. I've never spent any atoms yet, just pick up whatever is free.
---
It does, I got Mega Sloth and Snallygaster last night during a SBQ fight.
---
That's a rational line of thought. The only reason I'd have to doubt the Aliens being released next patch is that their internal ID's don't have a prefix in front of them. Most content has a prefix for the DLC or Patch that it got/is getting released with. That's what made me think I missed something when I read your comment. Thanks for clarifying.
---
There are dead aliens in the back of some trucks, you could try those, don't ask where tho.
---
He seems to show up at CAMPs a lot.
---
No you just made such a great point that I‚Äôve never thought about before that I just up and changed my opinion completely!
---
So far everything everyone has tried has not worked.  Some have even tried taking a picture of a Toy Alien and the animatronic Alien.  As far as I can tell, the challenge is impossible to complete.
---
And it may just be me but I am having trouble with the Robot challenge.  I have taken pictures of a Vertibot and they did not count.  I tried the Fly Swatter Event and a random one flying over Whitesprings.
---
This is all they'll say officially:  
---
[https://help.bethesda.net/app/answers/detail/a\_id/44429/kw/mod](https://help.bethesda.net/app/answers/detail/a_id/44429/kw/mod)
---
I think that is about the ragdoll force and death animation for sloth.
---
They can make an Akimbo perk and it allows you hold and fire two shotty at the same time, that‚Äôll be really awesome, carpet bombing if you‚Äôre using explosives
---
&gt; If they don't want mods, they just have to disable the file override. 
---
The only thing Bethesda has to say officially is: [https://help.bethesda.net/app/answers/detail/a\_id/44429/kw/mod](https://help.bethesda.net/app/answers/detail/a_id/44429/kw/mod)
---
Gonna hold him for 9 more minutes
---
You have to wait til the event pops to get the blooms to actually bloom.  I live right beside Dyer chemical and collect them very rarely when they do spawn.
---
Rated M is for Meaningless, because the ESRB ratings system is a voluntary system that is not endorsed or enforced by the government. Meanwhile federal law is enforced, and does not care about said voluntary system. It's be like a sign saying "Pot is Legal" on your front door, that still won't stop the feds from paying a visit.
---
Ok, I must be experiencing a bug. Sometimes it just won‚Äôt fire and it seems to be while I‚Äôm combat
---
Health? Yeah, sure, how about +2 endurance? Hahaha.
---
But yeah, like I said, could be fine tuned by proper devs. Was just spitballing.
---
What platform are you on? I'm on Xbox the daily is take a photo of mothman while wearing an asylum outfit and hat, I just wasted a bunch of time finding and completing path to enlightenment only to find out that it's either bugged or wise mothman doesn't count.
---
Yup I posted that on patch day last patch :P
---
I've figured out what happens:
---
The cores will show 999 when you reload, no matter their actual charge.
---
If you weapon swap to something else then back again, actual charge is displayed.
---
If you keep firing with the buggy counter, it'll drop to 0 when the core is depleted, based on it's actual charge.
---
Do at least it doesn't waste ammo.
---
Annoying to have to spin it twice after reload though.
---
Also, you literally can't reload. If you reload, and weapon swap, you'll notice it's back to the same counter as before reload.
---
Sure, thank you very much!
---
Stealth Rifle builds benefit the most when they have maxed out Agility and Perception. You load up on sneak perks with the right gear, and rifle perks for damage. Agility also offers some pretty good damage perks such as adrenaline, and Gun Fu (if you are using VATS).
---
As for shotgun builds, without the maximum damage perks, scattershot and enforcer you are really gimping the potential of the weapon. 
---
Honestly, this build seems all over the place. It's more like a Partial VATS/Rifle/Shotgun/stealth build that really can't do any that well. 
---
Maybe at lower levels you'll be effective, but this builds is trying to do too much if you are already have access to more streamlined perks.
---
The fix for it is going to be rearranging your special attributes so you can specialize in a single weapon type to maximize effect.
---
However, that doesn't mean you are stuck using one weapon type. Those who use max perception/agility builds can alternate between Automatic rifles, semi-auto rifles, auto-pistol, and regular pistols with stealth and non-stealth variations for each.
---
With shotgun builds you would have maxed out strength, which also opens you up for melee, and heavy weapons perks. Typically you would see this combined with Intel perks to maximize power armor potential. 
---
If you are committed to using both rifles and shotguns I would redistribute some points...
---
Maybe something like this:
---
 [https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=ff34568&amp;d=sp2so2sd2c72a72l71lu2lt2ic4as2su2pc2pd2pk2pl2pp2sg2eo1eh0&amp;w=&amp;n=shotgun/rifle&amp;m=](https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=ff34568&amp;d=sp2so2sd2c72a72l71lu2lt2ic4as2su2pc2pd2pk2pl2pp2sg2eo1eh0&amp;w=&amp;n=shotgun/rifle&amp;m=) 
---
You lose your sneak skills, but without maximizing those perks you'll find they don't work very well for higher level enemies anyway. If you can't sneak well, covert ops becomes useless outside of the first shot fired. 
---
If you really want the VATS perks then some tough choices are to be made... you could move a couple of points from Intel, you could move one from Charisma, or one from Endurance... The "blocker" perk under strength can be swapped out for carry weight perks, just a personal preference on my part since you would be up close and personal for probably 75% of your combat situations. 
---
Good luck out there, friend!
---
I keep killing the sheepsquatch and he keeps disappearing into the ground. I‚Äôve participated in the free range event 6 times and 4/6 the sheepsquatch fell into the ground so nobody could loot it.
---
Yup, it is actually why I don't take issue with the turret towers at the golf course. I just throw a moltov to tag all the ghouls then let the turrets kill them to save my ammo. 
---
I don't know why people hate the turret towers so much, if they knew how to work with the turret towers they are a HUGE help for everyone, not just the owner of the camp.
---
You‚Äôd have thought they‚Äôd get the hint with the multiple mods on Fallout 4 and constant demand back then, maybe we‚Äôll be lucky with a workshop dlc next year
---
But I really would love some inward corners, I had to revise my entire CAMP around not being able to use that idea
---
There's only 1 way to find out. . .
---
No I got tons of them yesterday trying to power level, just traveling to nuke zones and doing events in between. 98% of the drops were 1 Star worthless armor though.
---
There is no alien in the game yet, it's impossible to do. As for pics of vertibot/cargobot, they have to be extremely low to the ground, cargobot is easier, if the enemy name doesn't appear in the top right corner it won't count.
---
Ah yeah that's pretty decent.
---
You could also try r/fo76bazaar see if you can get caps or a nice trade trough there.
---
Not helpful?!
---
Swooping through Welch, taking 5 minutes to loot the houses and scrap the Mole Miners‚Äô weapons at the crafting bench in the middle of the town usually nets me about 400 steel.
---
Anybody who plays on ps4 would be so nice, to build it for me?
---
It does you just have to be standing still for some reason...
---
This is an impossible challenge right now, as the challenge is looking specifically for the Zetans, which haven't been added to the game yet. This is just like last week with the camera. More impossible challenges for atoms.
---
Are you on PS4 I might buy it from you if you want
---
Lol you in going to ask where
---
[This](https://imgur.com/gapNMNa) is the best i have now. Club could be better in numbers, but with current armor mechanic the lower your attack damage - more % will be negated by armor. That's why 1 strong hit is meta now (gauntlets, 2-handed, rifles)
---
The reason for the low xp is that the bots constantly spawn while in the silo. You could farm at the silo forever without having to leave, and there are workbenches their to repair weapons and ammo.
---
If you're on PC, I have a fan who's a big fan of Berserker's builds, and would pay a lot of caps for a weapon like that.
---
You think everybody having access to every ability, play style, and meta-class all the time in an online RPG should be a core mechanic?
---
I got it near the treehouse in the mire by standing around in the water.
---
Vengeful mothman is hostile, the others I've found are hostile.
---
Strange... Did you wait for the camera to reacognize?
---
Otherwise try to fix the vertibot platform at Wade Airport or Grafton Steel workshops and snap them
---
Happened when I first stumbled on the quest and took it solo. Barely made it when the second sheepsquatch Came out of nowhere.  Then the game glitched and I got no rewards. Great start lol.
---
This happens like every other horde from my experience. I think I'm just late to the party.
---
On xbox and idk, I really am gunna keep it for the legendary vendor to possibly reroll the effect
---
When people are using TSE I just use my auromatic tesla to tap everything. All your loot are belong to us.
---
Contemplating his revenge
---
That's a big ol basement.
---
Consider that AA is +29% damage if the target's DR is 300, but also +29% damage if the target's DR is 75. Therefore regardless of whether you reduced the target's DR by 75% through other means, AA still has the same effect on damage.
---
If that seems weird, consider that the third star of perks like Incisor have a greater effect on damage than the first star, because they're \*not\* multiplicative with the first star.
---
In practice, melee+incisor will usually push past damage = 6x DR anyway, so the advice there can be valid, but Tank Killer or Stabilized will rarely reduce the value of AA.
---
If you do the sheepsqatch questline, you get the fixer, which is a hunting rifle with the best mods, extra damage, and a bonus to sneak speed. It drops at level 30.
---
I was talking less about the dmg and more about the per addiction. So +.5 end per addiction maybe would work just the same.
---
Yup that why I‚Äôm in here lol.
---
There's one at Whitesprings if I'm not mistaken, in the parking lot by the fire house/maintence area.
---
OP- Whatcha doing?
---
Wendigo- Nuffin just chilling
---
Hats off to you bringing awareness to all the poor roaches we‚Äôve been using as cap dispensers for the last several months. Maybe now they won‚Äôt call us hackers anymore ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
Nice, what system are you on?
---
Sleep, Drink your Cranberry juice, eat your cranberry cobbler, and if you can find a leadership bobble-head go ahead and consume that too. All of these consumables will increase your XP gains on top of this weekend's bonus!
---
Then head to Whitesprings, kill everything, server hop, and repeat.
---
Im way overdue to do this event! Unfortunately every time when I log in and play no luck to get this event.
---
Max out bloody mess, as it will give you a 5% boost to both shotguns and rifles, also you don't need to run 2 in the "shotgunner, expert shotgunner, master shotgunner" or the rifle ones either.  They only offer 5% boost per point after the first, so if I were you I'd only run rank one of each of them, which would save you quite a few points you could put into enforcer, blocker, adrenaline, gun fu. ETC
---
You basically want to run less points into the damage perks that only effect one gun type and max out the perks that effect both gun types you run, it will increase your overall DPS.
---
Yes, I can do that. When will you be on next? I'll be on in about 20 minutes.
---
If you want a better picture with Mothman, there's the one that spawns from doing the Lighthouse event that's non-hostile.
---
You have to be standing completely still. This kept happening to me yesterday and I couldn‚Äôt figure out why. But I think that‚Äôs it.
---
Jet counts, right?
---
It jumps when things leave/enter the lists. If I'm selling multiple items, I ask people to buy them after I've priced them all. I also do the same (wait for all prices to appear) before I buy. If they don't wait, I exit trade and reiterate my term. If they do it again, trading is over, learn some patience. Then leave the server immediately, so you don't worry about base griefers.
---
Yep! Best also use a suppressor if you can so you can also make use of Mr Sandman sneak bonus card
---
Okay. Thanks for the help.
---
Ahh it just really sucks :( i wish they'd switch the quests to be more like eso, so if one person completes a task, it counts for the whole group.
---
Yeaaaa
---
Thank you, we'll give it a try!
---
im really looking for a handmade unless they made the lever much faster to reload.
---
It's the mothman that has to be wearing the uniform and hat.
---
He's called the Stalking Mothman in the game data for a reason.
---
[XB1] I have 2shot non-explosive Dragon that you  can have ... tips accepted. 
---
GT = AtomicCitizen 
---
I should be on at your indicated time.
---
They fixed the Vampire affecting melee hits that don't connect a few patches ago. Did this get reverted? (I haven't used a vampire weapon since they fixed it, so I may be out of the loop)

Thank you! üëçüèª

Only thing left to do is modify the loadouts and the name of your character
---
The regularly quoted damage formula is this. Can't really confirm it, but let's work with it:
---
hpdamage = damage \* MIN(0.99, 0.5\*(damage/DR)\^0.365)
---
The 0.99 cap just prevents the hpdamage from exceeding the paper damage, which would happen at about damage = 6.5\*DR (plug numbers in and check, if you like). There's no direct cap on armor penetration: It depends heavily on the incoming damage value.

Let me change it up one sec, to make it lore friendly
---
If you're running a mod like Perk Manager it will skip the level up screen. On PC I think you press "T" to open the perk selection/SPECIAL point menu if you have levels to use.
---
Lvl 65 1* Contemplating Mothman. Cousin of the Wise Mothman
---
Yup, it seems that's the best way to go.
---
good theory !
---
So Red Dead 2, Metal Gear Solid and Bioshock (to name a few),  get away with it how?
---
Hmm that might be it. When i log back in I‚Äôll try to confirm
---
Ya...would like to see him again...killed him once but really not worth it
---
4 star items are currently possible as their are a couple of mods that add a star to weapons, such as the scorched receiver.
---
on PC
---
I wonder how many I can toss before the first one hits and I jump servers.
---
This person get it
---
It's the damage bonus receivers that are weird, rather than Two-shot. Hardened seems to add +25% of base weapon damage, after legendary damage bonuses are applied. So two-shot + hardened would be 1.5 \* base rather than 1.25 \* 1.25 \* base.
---
The calibre-changing receivers have a straight multiplier instead, so in theory, a two-shot refined 50cal hunting rifle should deal slightly more damage than a two-shot hardened hunting rifle.
---
It is effectively a skin so I'm not one of those who are saying "weapons in the atom shop reee." However, unless crafted weapons are going to be able to gain legendary effects through the legendary vendor or some other reason, then this simply isn't going to be useable and I'd like a refund too. Buuuut the new release of sheepsquanch crafted weapons makes me think they will be able to gain legendary effects at some point, otherwise why would they release them like that?
---
I‚Äôd forgotten about the mothman, hadn‚Äôt seen him in weeks. Was collecting crops near my camp when all of the sudden this really loud bang and crash noise so startled me...... let‚Äôs just say it is a good thing I can craft clean new under armor.
---
Yes I have a 4 star machete. Added a sacrificial blade mod to a 3 star to get 4 star. Hoping we may get more 4 star and maybe 5.
---
The glowing bag thing isn't true. Been using that and other "glowing" mods for months.
---
Yes!
---
That‚Äôs a good point.
---
Does it need to be scorched?
---
This is on PS4 so can‚Äôt be that
---
I'd imagine there will be more 1 star mods to come, having only a couple and only on weapons seems odd. I have no proof, but I speculate the 5th star will be dropped mods with no recipe or possibly a selection from the legendary vendor, maybe a combination of that.
---
Because bioshock and MGS all came out nearly a decade ago before these laws were put in place. as for RDR2 I don't know. My guess is they call it something other than tobacco.
---
Personally I would get rid of marathoner as you‚Äôd be okay with out it unless you really like to sprint. But anyways get at least one lvl on all melee cards so that it‚Äôs useful against mobs but honestly it looks good
---
Explosive is a pain to test, and the ESM is unenlightening. Given that explosive weapons are still popular for PvP, I would guess that only the extra 20% damage is explosive.
---
He doesn‚Äôt eat or sleep.
---
He feeds directly on the fear that secretes from your pores when you see him.
---
Soaks as much of it up as he can then leaves to find another poor soul.
---
It is a hungry and devastating existence.
---
You‚Äôll wanna ditch Ironclad, and use them on Lone Wanderer, if ur alone a lot.
---
The dmg resist and ap refresh is very important, if you‚Äôre doing that; dont use Action Boy, as running both of the perks together for some reason do basically 1% faster regen, which isn‚Äôt worth the 2-3 extra perk points ur gonna use on actionboy.
---
You‚Äôll want Marsupial, Speed Demon, and Adrenal Mutations. Imo; class freak is a waste of a fully decked out perk, as ur not gonna get much out of it.
---
I‚Äôd use the first perk stage of Demolition Expert, as it gives a 20% increase to 20% of your explosive weapon dmg (because the explosive dmg bonus is always 20%). It wont seem like a lot of dmg increase per shot (like +5dmg per shot or something), but when sneak dmg multiplies it, it makes a difference. You‚Äôll want covert operative for obvious reasons. Since ur using be handmade for pvp, i wont tell u to use sneak or anything like, but if ur doing pve, its VITAL.
---
It's pretty random my dude, I have farmed the event so much and only gotten a couple 3\* sheepsquatch's, but also a lot of legendary stingwings, bloodbugs and yaoguai from the event.
---
If you want to encounter them in the wile, try in the cranberry bog and the Mire. In the cranberry bog try Sparse Sundew Grove and Creekside Sundew grove, and in the mire it's pretty random, but walking off the beaten path and you may encounter some.
---
And hell they do drop some great loot, I've gotten so many Unyielding, assassins sentinels and cavaliers. Wish ya luck! Sheepsquatch can be a bit of a ammo drain!
---
This game is only 6 months old..
---
Well they already do, limited by their SPECIAL of course. So why not make it easier to use?
---
This is happening to me aswell. Everytime I attempt it it crashes
---
I currently have some level ups banked because I‚Äôm working on my build
---
Close, but I believe it is the other way around.
---
Say you are wearing a full set of Assassin's gear which is 40% resist against player. A player hits you for 1000 damage, you have a DR of 1000 + 40% resistance to player attacks. The damage hits the % first, so it is reduced to 600 (1000-40%), then it hits your DR so you live to fight another day.
---
So if you have a Ghoul's Chest piece with 30% resist, 4 pieces of vanguard armor that puts you at 1000 DR, and a ghoul hits you for 1000 damage it is cut down to 700 before it hits your DR. You take some damage, but live to tell the tale.
---
If it were DR before resists it would be far easier to one shot most things, because without resists taking effect first the normal DR wouldn't be enough tank. You get hit with 1000 damage and have a 1000 DR you are dead, then the resists kick in... but you are already dead so it doesn't matter. 
---
To answer Op's question, Yes, it is more effective to gear up with armor that has a resistance against a certain enemy versus than just relying on straight DR. 
---
Enemy Damage --&gt; Resists cut that damage down --&gt; DR blocks the rest --&gt; HP is depleted by the remainder
---
Rifles only, and the armor penetration will currently only work for ballistic damage. The lesser-known part of Tank Killer is that automatic rifles only get 1% stagger chance per perk point, not 3%.
---
Thanks yea I sprint a lot! Also I use DCG so just one point unarmed or fully deck it out?
---
Wow man! Thanks for all the advice, a lot of that stuff I didn‚Äôt know. I‚Äôll def do some changing around. Appreciate all the detail and advice.
---
i do not use facebook. guess ill wait for someone to post the actual pictures
---
Np man. Goodluck on your build, Its fun as all hell
---
Horde events are working, but many times the horde leader will be spawned in an area filled with creatures it‚Äôs naturally hostile to. My experience seems to be that the horde leader won‚Äôt spawn until after you‚Äôve identified or entered the area in which it is based; and then it‚Äôs a race to get to him before he dies.
---
As a side note, the game tends to remember whenever you‚Äôve turned a particular quest‚Äôs notification off. Which means if you join a horde event you‚Äôve previously chosen to ignore, the game will just let you join the event and the map markers are turned off. You will have to enter your Pipboy data tab to turn the markers back on.

This doesn't look very good at all...
---
‚ÄúYou. Tonight.‚Äù
---
Amazing! Thank you
---
I recommend capturing workshops and just defending them. You get a lot of plans, basic aid, and exp that way! If you go to the area between New Gad, Charleston Station, and Charleston Landfill, there are 4 relatively close workshops.
---
It's a bug for you, because on my game, it's working perfectly (at least, this part...because the "identify the place" feature seems to be buggy)
---
It is a great balcony. This is a great shot!
---
Yuuuuuuup.
---
You should consider rejiggering your agility to stealth instead. Your melee perk doesn't add very much at all to the build, you should consider switching it for Barbarian instead which is very useful if you're running around at low health.
---
+1. I really DO NOT want anyone to bother me some days, especially when i'm following some important mission.
---
Yeah thats another one.. or u alt-tab beside someone.. now ur engaged in pvp while ur app is minimized..
---
Nope, I 'cured' all three 'passive' AoE mutations quite a while ago.
---
Can't post pics on this group only text.
---
Broken link...
---
I think this has to do with enemies instantly dying. Not entirely sure on the connection between the two
---
Vengeful Mothman. More like he's comtemplating someone else's death.
---
if i'm correct, this is not in this truck, but in the one you can found when you go from lewisburg to bigbend tunnel

I got mine when trying to loot some stuff on a sleeping bag in Watoga, accidentally sleeping in it for ***literally the time it takes to finish laying down and you can exit!*** lmao
---
Bethesda's logic for catching diseases in 76, is the early-80's view of AIDS: Shake hands with someone who has it? *You* now have AIDS, too! \*thumbs-up emote\*  
---
Except for Whoopsie, which appears to adhere to Slot-Machine Jackpot Odds. :P 
---
Not ye-olde slot machines either! Nay, the modern highly-computerized ones which measure your spending habits, bathroom breaks, food requests, stress levels, and probably 10 other things your family Doctor doesn't (but should) know about you! haha
---
Same... I didn't bother to look at the list though, but this sounds like the 1 I'm likely missing! :D
---
There‚Äôs no landing damage at all. I believe in FO4 there was minor landing/stagger without Vents, Vents just amplified it. Well, 76 doesn‚Äôt have landing damage, so Vents can‚Äôt amplify anything. 
---
So from my deduction, Vents may be perfectly fine, it‚Äôs the baseline landing damage that is ‚Äúbroken‚Äù.
---
Mechanically, it doesn't even matter whether you're grouped, as far as I can tell. If two enemies are punching each other, then you can't get sneak bonuses against them at range until one of them is dead.
---
 It is a pain, yeah. Stealth rifle is extremely strong solo, but it can be painfully weak in a group. Throw in some bloodied or at least VATS crit stuff if you want more punch in SBQ fights. I wouldn't bother with the bonus sneak damage perks because you'll be crazy strong with stealth anyway.
---
Maxes at 90% I think
---
Yeah I don‚Äôt have the mats I need so will have to pay full price
---
and you didn't yet try to do the "landview lighthouse" or the "night vision" today...
---
When I play this game and roaming with my squad of friends through the forest doing dumb stuff, it reminds me of RPG in the old days when u used to have to walk a mile through snow to get to ur friends house just to roleplay with a bunch of books and dice.
---
some have to be easy, other have to be hard... But "use night vision mod" while this one is not yet active... or found a "zetan" while they are not in game is simply IMPOSSIBLE (not hard)
---
How do you get the plans for cranberry juice and cobbler?
---
Like I mentioned above, a Strength/Agility (12 in each) build gives you access to every damage build except Rifles. 
---
If you setup up SPECIAL to 12,9,8,5,5,9,8 you now have access to every damage type, defense type, weight perks, passive ability, and crafting skill. With the load-out manager you can swap into them anytime you want with almost no repercussion. It completely breaks the meta game and the reason for a perk system in the first place. 
---
Perks seem designed as a way to customize yourself instead of using a class system or skill tree, if we had a class system or skill tree (like most Online RPG's) you'd never be able to have access to everything in this manner.
---
20% per piece, capped at 90% reduction. Unlike food/chems weight reduction, it applies after weapon weight reduction perks.
---
You could also diversify and use different guns that use different rounds. This way you build stock for all kinds of fights
---
You‚Äôre gonna want ammo weight reduction perks, and yeah, all the non-damage HW perks should apply to the broadsider. And prepare to farm a looooooot of lead. Each shot is like 10 lead.
---
Stupid question, does sneak work good in PVP. What would you recommend for sneak in the agility?
---
I did like 150 assorted maps and got the plans for one raider PA piece lol
---
Meh, give him a selfie mode but have all the pictures come out blurry.
---
Sounds like a plan, cheers
---
But nothing new is spawning
---
Hey, welcome back! Yeah there‚Äôs loads to do now. First off you should google what you just asked, click on the Bethesda link at the top, and read what it says, really good fun. Also, and this wasn‚Äôt discovered for ages, but can also search it on reddit, and there‚Äôs some special Easter eggs that Bethesda planted on the reddit where literally a thousand other people have already asked, and for some reason people just keep answering instead of being sarcastic. It‚Äôs a good time to be a 76 player for sure!
---
That's good to know. I have a 3\* TS 10MM SMG, with the other two being effects being 40% bash dmg (underwhelming) and +1 perception. The bashing is fairly straightforward but I'm unsure what the +1 perception does for me, I have to assume it does something for VATS hit chance?  
---
Also, are the Commando perks the only rifle perks that affect SMGs? Meaning that Long Shot and Tank Killer wont affect it? Or do SMGs get the bonuses from all rifle perks that are not specifically semi-automatic, like Rifleman?

You can play me to be a secret shopper. That's how it's done in the real world.
---
Depending on your resources, get a spare set of troubleshooter's armour. There are only robots down there and 2 assaultrons + 4 laser turrets at a time hardly do any damage to you. I run MANY silos and with that suit I don't even kill enemies until the last stage. Let's face it, you're not down there for the xp so the faster you can speed run, the better. I may use 1-3 stimpaks as well. If you have troubleshooter's with cavalier or sentinel, well, it is a cake walk.
---
Bonus: you can face tank Imp Squatch.
---
Thank you both for the quick responses. That is the answer i was expecting. One piece doesnt really seem worth it, but a full set would allow a Player Vendor to carry around a lot of weapons or ammo to sell. I will have to take these off of my for sale list. 
---
Thanks again!
---
[https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Fallout\_76\_patches](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Fallout_76_patches)
---
Sure. Yes I‚Äôm on Xbox.
---
I need to find 3 more pieces of armor with 20% weapon weight reduction to test out my theory. With 2 pieces they reduced my ranged weapons (not melee) weight by 40%, maybe with 5 pieces my rifles will weigh 0 pounds :-)
---
If you like to play PvP avoid FO76 at all cost, because it is one of the the worst platforms for PvP. Game is so laggy and buggy and full of glitches that it doesn't even make sense why there is PvP mode. FO76 engine is not even designed to PvP gaming. It is RPG engine that can't handle so low latencies like real PvP game engines.
---
Yeah I got a lead extractor running. That‚Äôs what I thought. All of the non damage one should still apply.
---
Absolutely, lots of nice locals are totally ruined by both trash and dead bodies. There's a monorail car in the bog you can build in but a body in there totally ruins it...
---
I usually run heavy combat armor, but I switch it out for heavy leather when running silos, just for the extreme energy resist. I'm not lucky enough to have a set of troubleshooter armor, so it is the next best thing.
---
"Provisions Cigarettes" -rdr2 consumable
---
"Deadeye Tonics Chewing tobacco" -rdr2 consumable
---
SMGs are considered to be automatic rifles, so Tank Killer and Long Shot both work. Tank Killer only gets 1% stagger per perk point rather than 3% with automatic rifles though.
---
I honestly find that hard to believe, but I have no way of knowing otherwise, so I'll let you have this one.
---
&gt; BTW this is not a shitpost it is a true story.

This is literally a post about shit.

It‚Äôs still called tobacco. Ie Indian tobacco. There‚Äôs also stuff like premium cigarettes but you sell those, you don‚Äôt smoke them.

I really wish tamed critters would be like any other CAMP item. let us move them (mine just love to go away from my base or disappear to god knows where) and "repair" them when they die. make it require Stimpacks to revive them instead of the usual building materials.

---
I agree and admit to that.
---
Thank you but I use melee ;)
---
Oh, and broadsides does benefit from Stabilized. So if you want that... prepare for power armor.
---
I have the opposite problem. I got the plan as a drop from the scorchbeast queen, but my T51 armor won't let me make it for some reason.
---
Wow, thanks for letting us in on that; impressive and goes much deeper than I would have thought. 
---
Wouldn't you say that type of condition makes it so we're playing a game where most of us don't know the rules? I know you've given examples of successful off brand builds, but how is a typical gamer, even an avid one, expected to keep up? 
---
If I'm highly skilled at poker, a dealer playing against me after work wouldn't have an inherent advantage based on inside knowledge - the fundamental rules are known and probability data     is freely available. 
---
Is there an element of the ::ahem:: deck being stacked against the vast majority of players? Where inside knowledge creates an uneven playing field?
---
This is probably a bad time to tell you that T-45/51b/60 jetpack plans are a really common SBQ drop at the moment.
---
Oh my, do you know it drops (not so bad chance) from scorchbeast queen, or imposter sheepsquatch?
---
I've never played the game, so I don't know. Chances are they have some reason why.
---
Marathoner is too good, be it running away or running after people.
---
"Hey, Mothman, what ya thinking about?"  
---
"Vengeance."
---
Upon re-reading your post I realized I stupidly glossed over that this is a PvP build. Sorry, I can't really help... Although Barbarian would probably still be a better choice over the melee perk
---
Stimpaks would be nice, but I'd also accept like specific meat, plants, or eggs depending on the animal. It would be a little more difficult, but totally worth it if you've grown attached.
---
I was thinking PA at first but I need gunsmith maxed more that pa perks and now that I need demolition maxed I don‚Äôt think I have the points to spare for them.
---
The extra weight on spawn in was a bug. They might have finally fixed it.
---
Are you new to the internet? 
---
Let me take a moment to explain how people 'work' on here...
---
\[/s\]  
---
lol Honestly though, there's always a small group of people in every community who defy logic, and since most won't bother to comment (nevermind bother to read the comments) it'll never be known...  
---
My only hypotheses *(but are logic-based, which inherently makes my assumptions flawed; see above)*:   
---
\- They mistakenly click the ‚áß instead of ‚á© and did not realize it.   
---
\- They disliked having to watch a video.   
---
\- They were hoping for the inclusion of The Whoopsie's effects in the post's text.
---
The last one is actually based on my own feelings, but I did *not* downvote for it. Personally, due to monthly bandwidth limitations( 24GB/mo), I didn't watch the video *(assuming it's even included in there)* as I try to stay off YT as much as possible. :P
---
Soooo.. Any solution to this yet?
---
The beautiful thing is it simply applies to anything in the ‚Äúweapons‚Äù tab. Which means it also reduces the weights of grenades and mines
---
i'd be ok with that, i'd also really appreciate some indication that the animal still exists. I can't tell you how many times I've tamed one, it disappears then after I tame another I find my original pet just standing sadly outside my camp.
---
Which is pretty stupid considering this is supposed to be a game for 18+
---
A giant mutated chameleon exploding into a bloody red paste?
---
ESRB: ...
---
Give people the ability to smoke?
---
[ESRB:] (https://imgur.com/a/V5FF3je)
---
Is this a different toon? Or either you‚Äôre always got friends to play tone with lol. Pretty fun looking build.
---
Great point. The silo will give you a random combat armor about 50% of the time and if nuking the queen, another piece, always. Won't take long to self-find a set.
---
I grabbed 1 in flatwoods then kept trying, beating on the machine jumping on it then grabbed another one and left super happy. Next day came back tried again grabbed one then tried again and grabbed another. Then I was like bfd and now I only try as I pass by a pie machine which not every time but they do grab sometimes now and then.
---
384 I think it was, it as nearing 400

Wut?

So my instigating lever loses instigating after reload? Don‚Äôt make me cry
---
That is really good to know. I assume that means the same for the ammo effect? Everything in the ammo tab, including fusion cores?
---
Maybe, it only happened the 2 times I had to build it

Thanks. I ultimately decided on this:

---
    
---
Thanks for your help!
---
Yes, that would be really nice too.
---
You are aware the ESRB has no power correct and is completely voluntary...
---
they should be an aid item, increases AP by +20 but the addiction causes your AP regen to lower by -30% and increases chances for all lung based diseases
---
Throwing knives will do the trick as well.  Killed a LOT of level 50+ in my 20's using them while running backwards.
---
You'd need to approximately double your DR to take 30% less damage. Generally you can take DR\^0.365 to see how effective an increase will be.
---
Damage reduction probably applies before the DR calc, so 30% damage reduction actually reduces damage taken by about 39%.
---
How did you take a picture of the mothman ? is there a way to find him ?
---
I would search the hundreds of posts asking this same question every day
---
I think about this a lot. If I actually lived in the wasteland I‚Äôd definitely have my own farm/greenhouse.
---
Had him in a tree near the mountains at Seneca Rocks too
---
I'd honestly be satisfied with something simple as letting us add more special points. Like instead of ending at 50 we end at 60, also increasing the max points to 20 from 15.
---
to the best of my knowledge, yes. Same with the Aid weight reduction one. But you can only have 5 total of those types of legendary effects, so it's sort of deciding which one is most worthwhile to you. Figuring out where most of your weight comes from, how many perk points the reduction perks for that section would cost, and going from there.
---
Yes, but it's still not legally enforced, it's voluntarily enforced via internal policy at the retailers. Meanwhile, depicting cigs in the wrong way can result in government intervention.
---
One guy from our group stop playing with main over 400lvl, don't remember how much over tho.
---
Due to XP exploits and bugged xp for ghouls i belive there are few players around 800.
---
It's actually mitigated by poison resistance. I like to run one piece of poison resistance armor, makes it a lot less dangerous when you're caught in a building without PA.
---
I‚Äôm pretty sure GTA V has more kids on it and they can smoke all they want

Can you believe the value is only 9 caps? It's like we're selling stuff on pawn stars!
---
I've used trading subs in the past. I just don't like the hassle of meeting up with people
---
PC, sorry
---
those items are used the the new sheepsquach staff, or you can just scrap them for bone
---
I can‚Äôt  see running away but running after yes, but if you can sneak up on someone you should be able to melt them down fairly quickly
---
It's a port-a-diner! I have activated these in multiple Fallout games literally hundreds of times and finally got the pie!
---
Where can i get the staff?
---
Awesome thanks!

The flood of bots?  Tesla does the job for exploding eyebots,.still need a heavy hitter to deal with col gutsy's.  I think the robot hacking perk keeps them from respawning, folks keep killing the neutral bots so not 100% on it.

i could see that also being an option for some of the consolidated perks. I do feel that people would just use the extra points to get more damage or survivablity rather then Utility, then they would still be complaining they don't have the space for passive perks.
---
The Landview Lighthouse event close to the vault always spawns a friendly Mothman if you complete it.
---
What platform are you on? I might be able to help you.
---
*vengeful*
---
Eh, you are given directions by wolfs recording when event started.  And mentioned a couple times during the quest.
---
I actually dont have a problem with weight. I run a bloodied rifleman build with only 3 points in strength, and no weight reduction perk cards. But i do have a few Unyielding pieces and deep pockets. (I barely carry anything)
---
The reduced weapon weight armors would be for my alt character to be a more efficient salesman! Lol. 
---
There are so many legendary effects that i never payed much attention to, and am now finding a way to use them. Kind of like how most of us have probably sold a tonne of Sentinel/Cavaliers/Assassins pieces before we knew they were gonna be such a hot ticket item.
---
I meant to put whoever made that a law and I'm too lazy to change it.
---
Oh boy do I have good news for you (hope linking this way works) : https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/afcgjc/i_made_a_visual_catalog_of_camp_assets_by_plan/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share
---
doesn't work
---
No problem, I try running melee but half my hits don't seem to want to connect with the enemy XD I've just resorted to spray n pray now!
---
That's why I love T60, dirt cheap to repair.
---
you forgot the booze filled with radiation so potent you can wake up miles away with no clue how you got there even being 100 plus pounds loaded down with junk
---
I dunno, I used a single piece for a long time and was happy with just 20% reduction to all weapons... Though now I found a second with it and am elated! :D I also have one with Ammo Weight reduction, and now that you mention it, yes it works on the Cores as well. I recall just yesterday thinking to myself "Odd... Why are my Plasma Cores 0.5lbs instead of 0.7lbs?? Oh well, yay!", but now that you mentioned it I remembered having that effect on one of my armor pieces :P
---
Now... if only I could find a perk that lowers the weight of Notes, so that the 70++ Known Plans I've been hoarding in anticipation for the *delayed* Player Vending Machines, wouldn't weigh a 1/4lb each :(   
---
Entire Spacesuit and Helm? 0.2lb total.  
---
A couple pieces of paper inside a folder? 0.25lb each.   
---
Logic? AWOL.
---
Only mod plan of those I have is the T-51b Calibrated shocks
---
That needs 
---
17 Adhesive
---
17 Aluminium
---
17 Fiberglass
---
5 Pure Violet Flux
---
I've moved on significantly since I posted this. I now run:
---
1. Vampiric guitar sword
---
2. Explosive black powder rifle
---
3. Anti armor gauss rifle
---
4. Hunter's gatling laser
---
Probably going to dump 2 eventually, it has the 90% weight drop thing though so it's almost carried for nothing. Nice opener then switching to the gauss. I drop SBs with the gatling after they land
---
well the fur has balistic fiber
---
https://fallout76.wiki.fextralife.com/Power+Armor+Mods
---
Yeah. One spawns at the end of the event "Free Range". I've killed quite a few of them now. Haven't gotten anything decent really from them yet.
---
Thank you !! Sorry for no mic. If you need serums this is the guy people !
---
This is crazy.  Just got a 3* today.  I see posts going back to December on this issue.  NO EXCUSE not to fix.....
---
You're a good person thank you so much
---
I've had the opposite, I'll do an event by myself with lots of spawns and then when there is two of us there's no spawns almost at all
---
Hear hear!
---
It must be one of the mods you can earn for the new free range quest.
---
Massive thank you. Toast in your honor.
---
I've seen a lot of 300 and a few 400 lvl players.
---
Thanks. This was perfect info. :)
---
I'd say get weapon weight then, armor weight is like 2pts in str. Most valuable things to sell are equipment. And it's easy to get the traveling pharmacy and thru-hiker and junkrat perks if you want them.
---
Thank you so very much for this
---
Okay, thank you for the info. I really appreciate it!
---
328, and he was a massive cheater
---
Yeah, just thought it was interesting because it want in the event
---
Everytime I go to that website my phone yells at me and tells me it's not safe lol.
---
np mate
---
Thanks for the info, that‚Äôs a bummer, I had hoped that it would be more useful ={
---
I've had a couple random ones spawn while wandering in The Mire. I think they only spawn in the mire, savage divide and cranberry bog
---
Zetans are in the gamefiles but don't spawn yet.
---
It's the sheepsquatch club, if you're on Xbox I can craft you that plus a Shepards crook
---
Hm weird, nothing happens for me
---
I got mine from the one near the southern belle motel
---
Forget it, mentally done for the day. (deleting topic, had "someone join before you, only for them to nuke my base with a mirv.")
---
Fireproof gives no protection against poison or radiation, so it's totally useless against the green cloud of SB's
---
Best protection is to move out of the cloud and even after that it will tick few seconds damage to you, so just stimpak and move away.
---

---
you can tame the Snallygaster, isn't he a cryptid?
---
It‚Äôs not for America like many posters think because these games aren‚Äôt marketed towards kids.
---
Many other countries that Fallout is sold have stupid rules about tobacco, to the point many devs don‚Äôt include it (at least being smoked) so they don‚Äôt have different content for different countries.
---
Heroes of the Storm during beta had both Gaslowe and Tychus smoking, but an update took that out even though it fit the charzcters because Blizzard didn‚Äôt want the hassle of maintaining multiple models (lame IMO).
---
For Bethesda, the drug ‚ÄúMorphine‚Äù was renamed to ‚ÄúMed-X‚Äù to comply with Australian laws. 
---
So stuff like this is usually to make a game internationally compliant.
---
You need the perk card "batteries included" for fusion core weight reduction.
---
Besides from the power plants? Not really anymore, some enemies used to drop them but that's gone. You could go to places like the theme park where generators are but otherr players  take those real quick.
---
Yes! He fits perfectly in VATS/crit builds. I sometimes use him to tank creatures like Yao Guais, Deathclaws or even your ordinary ghoul.
---
Whitesprings all day
---
they nerfed a lot of the good methods, now the best option is to sit outside a power plant with a running processor that someone else owns, and hope they did not lock it.
---
There's like 3 or 4 spawn at mama dolce if you server hop there
---
There is a YouTube videI by miz Tracey that chose how to do it on xb1
---
Just kill the white springs sentry bots when you farm it
---
There is a bridge outside of Watoga that has BOS items and even a flag. It's hard to build there but possible.
---
I've gotten the same issue when I've tried placing those power cable connector thingies. I've found that sometimes when I've stored the item I was attaching them to the connectors would be there in my inventory, and at other times they wouldn't be there at all as though I never tried making them in the first place. Apologies if that doesn't make complete sense. I'm kinda drunk lol.
---
Hmmm, that I don't know...
---
But NPC‚Äôs in fallout 4 smoked, pretty sure they did in NV and 3 as well. Why include them in the first place if you can‚Äôt use them yourself
---
I was called a slew of dirty words by a kid, for refusing to *give* him my tse 50 cal.
---
It was the only weapon on me, and I had equipped. Kid just expected me to give it to him.
---
Wound up blocking him because he was being such a little shit.
---
I'll help people out if I can, but not with the gun I built my character around.
---
The body isn't in the same location for everyone.
---
I've yet to see a Mothman, are they in a particular area?
---
I actually did have one instance where my power connector was invisible until i entered build mode. I scrapped it and rebuilt, and it was fine. For this shelf thing, though, nothing i did fixed the issue. I might try to reproduce it next time i log in, to see if it was just a one-time thing.
---
Lol yeah you're right.

Nice! Thanks for the info. I was reviewing missing items/tasks for challenges and this is one I need.

They are very rare,  I‚Äôve got four.  Two are not very good defence wise, but with a heavy weapon build, its amazing how much you can carry.

you get the .150 at the end of the bucket list... other mods are not yet in game

This looks like the start of a thrilling adventure to search for L A M P

Found one randomly today.
---
Well if homie mothman would stop attacking me first, I would be his friend.
---
You can craft them at chemistry stations.  The recipe isn't too crazy if you can reliably get stable flux, any they have over 100% charge if you've got decent intelligence. (mine craft at 113%)
---
Deathclaw gauntlet
---
Mmm not too low for my AA , +50 critics I can buy with caps
---
Not to my knowledge
---
Always some in the tree town east of Harpers
---
Slow down when scrapping man. It‚Äôs gone.
---
Try Tanagra Town, there's a cave at the top.
---
Under the highway in the Bog
---
I'll get stuck occasionally but it's only in PA.
---
As far as limiting, there's Riva Tuner &amp; you can check the GPU software &amp; try to enable v-sync or the likes
---
[Tanagra Town in the mire.](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Tanagra_Town) They will be inside a cave a little ways up.

Oh okie my gt same as name I‚Äôm on now just let me know it‚Äôs you send me a message or something I‚Äôll give it to ya
---
Free range quest!? How do I activate that!?
---
Xp gain is proportional to your intelligence. Higher intelligence= more XP gained.
---
So to answer your question, yes.
---
Yup, their have been posts about it literally within a couple hrs of the update to release camera quest. I don't think you need the outfit. If not mistaken works with just camera equiped and doing any emote.
---
Thx for sharing
---
Huh must be luck of the draw, been grinding that location for two days and nothing.
---
But I was using my iPad, not sure if it opens differently or something between the both
---
Why would someone down vote this!? What a jerk elitist! ‚ÄúYour stupid for not knowing this so I hope no one else has to take 2 seconds into inform someone ppppfff!‚Äù
---
No P
---
Ok cool. I‚Äôll be on in like 15 if that‚Äôs ok.
---
Just make sure it pops up on the camera what you're targeting. Mine worked fine.
---
What's the language of your localization? I play russian version and had those quests too. In fact they are - take a photo of a player with a flamer or chainsaw at night (—Ñ–æ—Ç–æ –∏–≥—Ä–æ–∫–∞ —Å –æ–≥–Ω–µ–º–µ—Ç–æ–º –∏–ª–∏ –±–µ–Ω–∑–æ–ø–∏–ª–æ–π –Ω–æ—á—å—é) with just regular camera and to take a photo of a Mothman while wearing asilum clothes and hat (—Å–¥–µ–ª–∞—Ç—å —Ñ–æ—Ç–æ –ú–æ–ª–µ—Ä–æ—Ç–∞ –≤ –∫–æ—Å—Ç—é–º–µ –∏ —à–∞–ø–∫–µ —Ä–∞–±–æ—Ç–Ω–∏–∫–∞ –ø—Ä–∏—é—Ç–∞ —Ç–æ–∂–µ –æ–±—ã—á–Ω–æ–π –∫–∞–º–µ—Ä–æ–π). –£ –Ω–∞—Å –≤—Å–µ —Å—Ä–∞–±–æ—Ç–∞–ª–æ. It worked for us.
---
Blammo! There‚Äôs your answer. You need to use those banked level-ups to unlock the perks associated with those levels.
---
Wow that would be sick! I didn‚Äôt know there was a new quest! I assume you get to craft both after the fact?
---
Tonukko Leaf.
---
Laws that don‚Äôt make sense create decisions that don‚Äôt make sense.
---
FO3 also had smoking. For all I know it was a simple canned animation they made and can easily leave out of certain versions but yanking a whole consumable out of the game for certain countries wouldn‚Äôt look good.
---
Here‚Äôs another one. In the 90‚Äôs games could have kids dying at least in the US but not in Europe so now nobody puts it in because less censorship. Furthermore, in America, there‚Äôs a sense that devs will get negative attention if it makes into a game so they don‚Äôt want to deal with it.
---
Many strange censorship things really are mostly about international compliance, and in some cases about avoiding political groups that are sue happy.
---
Check the roof. Sometimes if you try to place an item on an object, the game will freak out and try to place it on the nearest solid platform (not furniture).
---
Yeah no problem, will be on in a couple of hours, GT is my name here, I don‚Äôt want anything for them as it‚Äôs only a couple of cloth.
---
I really try and be careful, I was always worried I'd be thst guy and accidentally kill the brahim.

My bad &gt;.&lt; didn‚Äôt see any. Then again around the updates I wasn‚Äôt on reddit much. 
---
Just from my testing, it did a little jump with my normal outfit on (Enclave outfit) but to me it seemed worse the Sheepsquatch outfit on. 
---
Thanks for the info :)
---
You earn plans by completing free range
---
I saw a level 628 on ps4.  
---
I've been casually playing with breaks during buggy patches and just barely hit level 122
---
Sweet, appreciate it. Mine is ActualGarbage68
---
I did once, back in the early days, and it felt awful. 
---
Ever since then if I‚Äôve come across him, I‚Äôve thrown up hearts and waved hello while he did his thing. I noticed that his attacks don‚Äôt really do very much damage anyway, so just hanging out for a bit before sprinting away and letting him have his space has become my usual routine.
---
I #think the DCG is it.
---
Thank you for that!
---
No harm done. Like yourself, I'm sure their are plenty who still don't know about it. Always good to get information out.
---
I've been at the event a few times (always failed too) and have no idea what's meant to be happening. This game is awful at explaining everything. Why do you burn through so many stimpaks - isn't the point to die over and over (probably not, but I've not idea how you wouldn't, I just get one-shotted by pretty much anything including the pylons)
---
Idk if it is still thing, but i bought those pland from grafton vendors.
---
It's gone, and your fault. Bethesda shouldn't do a thing
---
I was going to advise you *not* to shoot on sight big scary creatures that you do not understand, but then I saw you roleplaying as a Brotherhood member.
---
That's good information, thank you.
---
Serverhoping till you lost connection to your real life.
---
Or have luck
---
Or check reddit for some kind person who found this corpse and will let you join his server.
---
Thanks for holding him. Unfortunately nothing I could use.
---
Thanks for info.
---
I just completed the event and took the photo of the moth man, its name appeared on the camera so it was identified.
---
I was wearing 
---
[https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Asylum\_worker\_uniform](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Asylum_worker_uniform)
---
The weathered dress, and its hat.
---
Could you please tell me hat I did wrong ?
---
Thank you! Didn't know
---
Do you have all the components? Sometimes you need to scroll down. You should threee types of fluxes for example. The recipes are the same for all PA.
---
I was hoping not to use V-Sync but that worked, thank you for the tip!
---
The main reason is because when the game was first released, people were going in the silo‚Äôs and farming xp for hours with the never ending robot spawns.
---
It took me two tries to find it in front of the mothman statue. Just go there and check, if nothing, log off, go back in, and repeat the process until it shows up, no need to travel all over the place for it.
---
If it makes you feel any better the sneaky unarmed builds find you equally annoying. 
---
Easily 99% of my deaths outside of SBAQ and Fake Sheepsquanch are the result of PA wearing pied-pipers crashing into the room like the damn Kool-Aid Man.
---
I do love this game when I can actually play it, but some of us have jobs and lives, yknow, Bethesda...
---
I'm just gonna assume I'll never get the quest and one day in the next couple of years if I accidentally get it I'll be happy.
---
I've scrapped my shielded underarmour 3-4 times. If I scrapped my imposter head that would be the last straw I will rage quit. Gotta stop playing drunk.
---
First the sound attack rate reduction, then the landing rate increase, and now this.  They used to be end game monsters that inspired fear and loathing.  Keep nerfing them and  they become a mere inconvenience. What evidence do you have that attack is not migrated?  Why can't that attack do damage over time or have a soft inclusion boundry?  Buildings that  are behind loading screens have perfect resistance to the attack.  What about fixing that too?  They are supposed to be exceedingly difficult to deal with.  As they are now I can take on four at a time and win as long as I can heal and my weapons/ammo hold up and I am not an elite player by any means. But lets nerf them some more and turn them into angry impotent plushies because they are too hard?  No!  They need to be made more difficult to fight, not easier.
---
The answer is yes and its an excellent design decision. We'll be seeing evolution of warfare here for years to come. The knowledge will drip from top to bottom, people will start ganging up, and they'll learn. I'm myself still learning, expertise or not.
---
This unfairness I believe is the essence of doing what you can to survive. Anything less than striving for all possible advantages is not Fallout.
---
Yesterday i did swamp of hearth in enclave general outfit and hat (it was counting as formal before). It didn't check in too. Is something broken? 
---
I didn't even try finding mothman, so i dont know.
---
I tried that too after posting this at Mothman, Willards and Lighthouse on three servers. Nothing yet and I've got to go to work now.
---
I‚Äôve scrapped my power armor pieces this way too, it‚Äôs inevitable when you do things fast üò≠
---
No problem sorry you couldn't get anything
---
Sorry if I am just being dense here, but I am confused by the two shot. So TS adds 25% base dmg. Do both pellets do base dmg? Just having a bit of trouble wrapping my head around it. Great info though!
---
Nope. As Far as I‚Äôm aware there hasn‚Äôt been any
---
I did same haha. And i don't have plan for shielded raider one, happened 3 fucking times and had to find new person who craft them every time.
---
Now you can favorite it and rename to 1xxxx to first on list.
---
I have a lvl 35 Instigating Handmade with +250DR and quicker reload speed *(not sure %, is it 25? potentially irrelevant either way)*
---
I think it was during Patch 7, maybe 7.5, where I actually looked at the numbers... What I observed was that the +250DR would persist after a reload *up until you fired again!*
---
I'll definitely have to check and make sure this is still the case.  
---
Side Note: I have shitty internet, living in a ""rural"" part of TN which I rely on poor signal 4G as my internet service. In other words, my latency could somehow be a factor here, which isn't exactly something I can easily confirm being a factor (short of loaning it to someone else, which not sure I'm willing to do yet lol).
---
Final speculative thought: Could be some odd collision between the faster reload and the +250 effect, and the game doesn't want to round-down below a certain reload duration, whereby putting it into a loop? However, in all fairness, I don't know exactly how *long* the +250DR would stick around, considering I ***was*** in a firefight while checking. I don't think it went away when being hit once, but maybe, and again I don't know if it persisted to any pre-determined amount of time. Such as something to that basically equates to "+250DR while reloading and until weapon is fired *or* for 10 seconds; whichever occurs first."
---
That‚Äôs strange, from my experience when I look for something I just hop server in one spot and I‚Äôve been able to get it quicker than traveling all over the place look for it.
---
Diseased honey beasts
---
This. Also sometimes even when an object on the floor, if you have a roof it likes to shove it up there. Store the roof first. Happens every time I try to put a Power Armor Station in a building.
---
I haven't seen that many myself either but I suppose they have some set spawns.
---
Omg thank you
---
Nicely done.
---
It‚Äôs all RNG. I tried server hopping on my main, did like 8 hops at the water park, nothing... but I also kept seeing th same couple servers. Tried a few hops at a few other locations, nothing. Finally found someone on reddit who was holding the location.
---
On my alt, I didn‚Äôt hop, just checked Watoga and then Whitesprings. Whitesprings had it. Pure RNG
---
The clock isn't displayed in 24h its 12h and one of the clocks on the pipboy does show AM or PM
---
Well, I did it 2 separate times. I gave up after the first time after 5 minutes. The second time I got the disease after 1 a minute or 2. Could be just really bad rng for you, or there could be a predetermined factor involved.
---
I don't like to either but it does seem to have its pros with this engine
---
You can do daily quest on lighthouse to summon Mothman.
---
Guttenberg, dan-man.
---
Uncanny caverns
---
Commenting to follow in case anyone shares spawn points cause I need the yellow uniform to complete my collection. Also on xboz
---
I mean it's potentially bugged in regards to the chances of getting it. Any diseased enemy gives a disease just from being within a 100 ft radius of it, but The Woopsies could have a considerably lower chance of contracting it than intended. Like, if every other disease was set at a 80% chance of contracting for each hit you take from an enemy, The Woopsies could be set at 8%. The fact that it can take 150+ hits from a little hatchling is ridiculous.
---
it adds 1 pellet, and then it takes 25% of the weapon's base damage and adds it to the total damage. These two effects are independent from one another, so the extra pellet isn't any different from the others
---
Go to the prison. Pick the 6 can chime/alarms on ground floor. 3 after main door, turn right to the prison area and they are in front of you, next three continue the prison hall forward and make first left turn and they are in front of you at the end crossroads. Each chime gives you 9 cans, each can gives you 3 steel and 1 lead (if I remember correctly).
---
Server jump and repeat. After 15 minutes and three jumps you have about 500 steel.
---
I'll check, i have an upper floor above it!
---
Is it worth taking off bloody mess 3 for?
---
Only found those as plans.
---
It was a regular, non-scorched diseased mirelurk hatchling. It can just take forever to get it.
---
So the extra pellet does the same dmg, if both pellets hit its double dmg? As well as the base 25% boost
---
it worked fine for me
---
Ok. You know how you can change your perks anytime you want and equip them as you need them? I have a specific perk selection that I use when I‚Äôm in melee combat, another for when I‚Äôm doing work at my camp and yet another for gun related combat. It is always these three different perk card setups that I constantly use and change back and forth depending on what I‚Äôm doing in the game. 
---
Instead of hanging to constantly change out each card one at a time, it would be much faster and more convenient if we could save or ‚Äúblueprint‚Äù different perk card setups so we could ‚Äúone click‚Äù between each setup as needed. 
---
This feature is considered a ‚Äúquality of life‚Äù upgrade to the game as it doesn‚Äôt add any new weapons or quests or anything but instead simply improves the ease, quality, and enjoyment of existing gameplay for the players. 
---
Hope this explains it more clearly for you so you can better understand  the suggestion. 
---
Thanks for posting.
---
Yes pure RNG indeed. I spent weeks looking for a reactive plate mod for the excavator, no result, so I bit the bullet and bought the schematics in Camden park for several thousand caps. Right after that I came across the mod in watoga selling for a couple of hundred lol
---
Interesting information. Thanks.
---
Can you craft me one too? I've tried to get these plans for so long but barely anyone shows up for me.
---
‚ÄòKnow the issue and are working on it‚Äô from one of their community reps
---
I'm level 75 and I've yet to see a single Mothman.
---
Same thing on XB1
---
That's fine will you be in tomorrow afternoon?
---
idk, i just started playing like a week ago and it seems everytime i go to a vendor they wont buy anything from me but my junk :/
---
Honestly that‚Äôs how I feel about most of the enemies
---
I should be. Thanks!
---
Ok just look around for me, GT Thasher41
---
I want to use the storage mod and now this mod.  My only concern is that game will be broken next patch if you use these mods.  This really should have been included or at least looked at by BSG.  I spend more time reshuffling my cards, making sure I have the right set made active.  I still miss a few once in a while.
---
that'd be great! if I didn't lag through the entire thing. Lol
---
Sparrow needs a shower!
---
What?
---
thank you, that was one of my guess to. at least it's nothing to go all Calvin about hehe
---
If you're on ps4 I have the body. AnachronisticUK. I'll be here for a half hour.

Ran into 2 then 1 twice in the same random spawn location.

I saw a 400+ when i was approaching 300, now I‚Äôm over 380, i imagine that guy is probably 500 by now (PS4)

Are you turning on radios you built or are coming into contact with radios in the world because they can get out of synch and it can force the pip boy radio to synch with built/world radios
---
I can build a fusion generator and a complex water purifier but a simple food planter is beyond my capabilities...
---
I just completed this on PS4 without issue.
---
I've seen a couple since they've been added in. One of them was being gunned down by three or four supermutants with miniguns.
---
How much you want for it?
---
I may be wrong but I've only noticed this in the past couple of weeks, don't recall it happening before then, XB1 too

665 is highest ive seen..

I can‚Äôt sell I don‚Äôt know how much I can sell

I think it's just generally unclear *what* type of damage the Scorchbeast's attacks are.  How long did it take before players realized that the green Cheerios counted as explosive damage?  I sure didn't know that.  Of course, once you do, between Fireproof and Dense, it becomes trivial.  But nothing suggested that it was explosive.  When you say explosive, I think of the robot explosions, exploding cars, etc.  Not the green Cheerios.
---
Just as the fart is apparently a poison attack.  I'm not sure anything about the visual implies that it's a poison attack.
---
different countries have different ratings depending on country different things are massively different ratings
---
I‚Äôm not aware of an instance of Bethesda restoring lost items to players.
---
Ya you need friends to bounce rad sponge off so it hits back on you.. and magnetic personality helps u boost ur charisma for loots/rewards and sharing perk cards purposes.  also I enjoy the handicap from herd mentality when i solo.. (swap in lone wanderer as well)
---
Good call.  I just tried that and it worked.  I had no idea that even existed at Wade Airport.  Thanks!
---
Just sent a request
---
and with high perception and sneak u see them before they see u.
---
Gta v let's you smoke. Red Dead Redemption 2 let's you smoke.
---
Yes, and that game came out nearly 7 years ago, prior to this law.
---
Ok I‚Äôm here
---
Cool! I wish there were some cultist stuff for the camp. so you can make a nice cannibal shrine)
---
no french version (on pc)
---
I was hopping for it right now you‚Äôre a lifesaver
---
Ahhh I didn‚Äôt realize that. I didn‚Äôt think it was those level ups because I saw a YouTube video where the guy could choose between the perm or respec and he had level ups banked.
---
I'll do you one better...Why is Mothman?
---
*The Mothman is good, the Mothman is great. Surrender your will as of this date.*
---
I wish I could date him
---
sorry, i was assuming you play on pc :p
---
We must cleanse earth of these abominations
---
Well, it's conditional.  Maybe you don't always run with it, but if you're over-encumbered, and you carry around a 3 WT armor that can save you 20 WT, it works out.
---
GTA V came out before the law passed. I don't know about RDR2 as I don't play it and never have.
---
I have two armor pieces with this and they do stack. I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs a direct 40% less weight in my case. I think applies 20% then 20% of that reduced.
---
Maybe your localizators failed too, try to make "english" ones
---
Go to the shopping area in WS and try to find it off the protection vendor with a chef hat in the kitchen store.
---
The real treasure is the rewards from saving all three cows. The rando legendaries can't compete with a badass looking electric or fire sheepsquatch staff or club
---
So could you point me to these specific laws?
---
JUST beat me to it.
---
Enjoy!
---
That would work too. I keep my excavator power armor with me for overweight fast traveling.
---
Yesterday I found an actual sheepsquatch in the wild, killed it, and as I walked up to the body my game crashrled. Sometimes this game makes me fucking angry.
---
I get this bug from time to time with multiple aid items
---
I swear I was just talking to my buddy about this a couple of weeks ago. Pain in the ass to change out for singular or group play. Or even to build/fix/repair things. Not to mention big fights. I think they'll do this eventually. The sooner, the better though. üëç
---
I dream of a stable 30 FPS I want your problem... üò≠
---
&gt; There‚Äôs also stuff like premium cigarettes but you sell those, don‚Äôt smoke them.
---
Uh, yes you can.   
---
Premium Cigarettes, cigars, and normal cigarettes, restore dead eye core.
---
Happens on PC too and started back in Patch 8.  Perhaps related to this, I haven't been able to get radios to work at my CAMP either, maybe because they don't start playing until the current song ends and the songs aren't ending properly.
---
Has anybody found a solution to this yet? I'm having the same problem
---
The sheepsquatch just came out and you‚Äôve got so many unyielding/sentinel assassin and cavaliers out of them, don‚Äôt know how many times you‚Äôve farmed them but you‚Äôre my personal hero now.
---
They all over the bog now, they like the plague. Bethesda thought it would be funny to have them spawn everywhere ..
---
When this happens, take the object you wanted to place the item on "outside" - without any sort of anything over you/it. You may find your disappeared item hovering somewhere over your surface object.
---
To get around this you must place the items into your surface object then move the whole thing (by selecting and moving the table - or whatever - as normal) and place that whole thing in its ultimate home.
---
Check the spreadsheet

What platform are you on?
---
I heard the challenge wasn't registering by doing the event .. fyi
---
Who‚Äôs that
---
It must be great getting all those ATOM awards for reaching those insane levels,,,
---
Oh wait! ...
---
Two shot missile launcher effective doubles the damage, though the stat screen seems to only show the 1 direct impact damage of the 2nd missile and not the full AoE explosive damage.
---
I tested a two shot vs an anti armor and it did noticeably more than AA. Same results with a broadsider. I have clips somewhere that I could upload if anyone is curious
---
This game doesn‚Äôt lag dude
---
There are a couple spots to the west of Watoga where they are likely (but not guaranteed) to spawn. They might also be on the road north of Watoga, in one of those little caves under the street. Other than that, I think the caves near the peak of Tanagra Town are guaranteed to have them
---
Here's a clue on how many I've farmed:
---
**T o o    m a n y**
---
Ya cause you screw up spawns for other people having your base there.
---
Also screws people out of xp and legendary drops.
---
Expect it to happen a lot.
---
It's on you if you have your camp there.
---
Ooooo I wish I use to run trapper all day it‚Äôs a nice armor set I will say
---
Yes they do exist, i have got Bloodied, furious, and a couple of other variants. Definitely not as common as drills though.
---
I said fuck it and kept server hopping until someone was in my spot, so I could get a free move. Mine were all 160 caps too.
---
This is correct. Nocturnal, Junkie‚Äôs and Beserker‚Äôs cap at +50%. In FO4 they capped at 100% or double, except for junkie‚Äôs which added 10% let addiction and capped at max addictions possible, which I think was 14 or 15?
---
They all really ought to be buffed back to this to make them more viable.
---
How much damage does he deal?
---
ah cool. wish I could do that. I've had the vertibird done for me and it's awesome.
---
Stairs are my nemesis I‚Äôve lost loads of 3* ghouls inside stairs ‚òπÔ∏è Whitesprings apartment stairs seem very bad.
---
Or did you just do that yourself to some buttholes there?
---
Haha, nice
---
Me too
---
Yeah
---
Nice one! I use a keypad pylon on the outside (temporarily opens the door) and a switch like yours on the inside to keep it open. Can‚Äôt be bothered with neat cable management though, just using the doormat glitch to move connectors in and outside my buildings.
---
So cute üòÄ
---
Thanks! Just saw how to start it!!! Nice!
---
Mole miner gauntlet is pretty close as well, and you can just run Uranium Fever once and guarantee you'll get the plan for it.
---
Hope you get it dude
---
Camera spawn
---
Well I‚Äôm at level 380 and only came across one piece sentinel assassin. Several three star sentinels and cavaliers yes, but sentinel stacked with assassin only once. To think you can farm many of them out of one creature in mere days... RNGesus is truly your buddy I guess üôèüèª
---
I love uranium fever. I've gotten the plan like 50 times, so true that
---
I've got an anti armor one as well. GT is Kaise7en
---
Point taken.
---
Don't tell me this means more unobtainable challenges....
---
Yup I wish there was a photo competition of cryptids just so this guy could win it. I would've taken so many pics for a loading screen haha
---
I wish.  I have a 3\* Bolstering Cavalier Trapper torso that's really effective against the SBQ and Scorchbeasts in general (especially since it has like 50 Rad resistance), but man, it's a dorky-looking thing.  My character doesn't tend to wear underarmor either and I noticed that her ribs clip through the sides of the armor too.
---
Yes the ones before the nerf still work.
---
That would max out at around 66% reduction if its multiplicative. 
---
100-20% =80
---
80-20%=64
---
64-20%=51.2
---
51.2-20%=40.96
---
40.96-20%=32.768
---
With all 5 pieces 
---
Sounds good in theory. I sold all but one piece of weapon weight reduction armor, so i cant test it out just yet. 
---
But I like the additive 90% maximum better though. üò¨
---
It worked for me, on xbox, tho I didn't do it at the lighthouse, I encountered one while looking for a mirelurk queen to fight. Sadly the dead pile did not trigger it for my husband who arrived too late to see it alive...

The wise mothman is contemplating
---
Dabney Homestead workshop defend events spawn crickets soooooo often for me.
---
Sounds awesome! I stumbled on it with my squishy vats crit character in the divide on an open plain. Killed me which was a welcome challenge, then I hunted it back down and got myself a sheepsquatch skull :)
---
I was doing the exact same thing at that grove. Got the same result with the number of scheepsquatches and all of them were 1* legendaries. They're pretty common apparently.
---
Now, by my camp at Whitesprings, there's a random spawn that spawns, and there's a new type of spawn made up of albino radstags and 1 scheepsquatch (also a 1* legendary).
---
Very annoying bugs for sure. They have been complied into several different bug lists on the forums.
---
In the meantime, no joke, you can use the Improved Repair Kit to get it up to 150%.  You can get them from killing the SBQ.
---
Ya, if the item (shelf) is too close to a wall or stairs... Then you try to place something on the shelf .. it pushes the object on top of what's close to the shelf. I.e. stairs above it, roof, second floor.
---
Try moving the shelf a little farther from the wall or removing the stairs/wall/floor above it before placing the radio down.
---
He follows a ‚Äúpath‚Äù around and is nifty to interact with (I mayyy have built my house on the path lol)

Yes i think everyone has it.

It just works.

Nicotine fiend ass
---
Campfire glitch doesn‚Äôt work anymore. Rug glitch did work for me last time I used it (few weeks ago)? Place rug, place plant on the edge, pick up rug, rotate, place plant etc. Can get quite a few on there. But if you try to put it on, let‚Äôs say, your first floor, make sure it overlaps the floor a little bit (so next to the staircase for instance) otherwise you can‚Äôt place it down. Hope it makes sense ;)
---
Because you need it for cloth.
---
Thanks but I had to leave for work
---
Night Vision has been in the game since release. It's a Perception perk called Night Eyes.
---
Is this the same for Mysterious Saviour? If he showed up every time it'd be an essential perk. You could even forgo armour/armour perks and just die instead
---
Godd Howard why have you forsaken us?
---
This is pretty good. I often set up a fusion generator at the workshop so I don't have to run the powering up event. Then I just leave it unlocked for other players to use(my one alt I rp as construction worker so I'm driven to build things)
---
If you see me online(pc) I'll set you up with a power plant workshop network to farm a bunch. Ign: TheAstrogator
---
Wow that‚Äôs awesome!
---
Not true. There are a few games where you can smoke. But the thing is, devs don't think it's cool. And they care.
---
Help other people like me grow lol
---
Move up to 2\* and 3\* armor/weapons? üòÇ  Get to the point where you can actually see the damage *you* do against the Scorchbeast Queen?  There's the semi-weekly new content and quests.  Daily/weekly challenges.  Unlocking the various plans.  Sometimes finding a great new weapon leads you down a path of acquiring the best perks for it.
---
But a lot of it is just self-motivated.  Deciding that, today, I'm going to walk to the Mire instead of fast traveling to Harper's Ferry.
---
We obsessively trade in the market forum.
---
They made us two sets of heavy combat armor too for when we hit level 30
---
Caps at 50.
---
You stop getting special points at 50. Beyond level 50 you can continue to rank up cards or move special points around.
---
regular cigs with all the junk in them are for plebs anyways, and the ones on the waste prob don't even burn properly due to age and radiation and contamination. Now if they made it so you could make your own that don't suck.
---
I launched my first nuke solo, on Whitesprings on an empty server. Ran a few laps through the place alone before the game crashed, but I was happy enough
---
I had to wear the weathered version of each for it to work. The white version clothes didnt work for me.
---
I have enough smoke from my neighbors balconies, I don't wan't it in game!
---
Nice one.
---
I literally just spent over half an hour going through Site alpha.
---
Decided to nuke Morgantown as I want Cobalt flux (I have none)
---
1 minute after entering the nuked zone the game freezes! Thanks game, love it when it hard locks up and crashes to my xbox like that.
---
Managed to pick 28 cobalt flux though! However didn't kill a single ghoul and I have no high radiation fluid. So complete waste of time having the cobalt since it will degrade.
---
Not like I can even say I got a good amount of xp from Alpha too since the game only awards me 17xp most robot kills. Gee thanks.
---
Anyway yea thanks Bethesda, awesome job! Love it when the game locks up going into nuked zones. Sooo much fun wasting my time.
---
I'm sure I saw someone over 700; you don't forget that sort of thing. On PC.
---
It may stop at level 50 BUT you start with 7 so max total is 57.
---
Yeah I... I never realized this. Did the event because I wanted to see him. Completed the quest and didn‚Äôt see him, turned around and there he was... right in my face. Got so scared I just instantly shot him. Poor moth man :(
---
This. Once you catch the bug the market really is the end the game. My game is basically bullet manufacturing and legendary hunting.
---
I think the token will have to be weapon-specific. If I collect a hundred rolling pins (getting there) and use those for tokens then use the tokens to enhance my handmade, then everyone will have top tier handmade in no time, simply because there are so many garbage Legendaries out there available to be recycled. I myself collected a whole bunch. This will make top tier legendary worthless really quickly. 
---
If it‚Äôs weapon specific, i.e. scrapping a legendary handmade for a legendary handmade token and use that to re-roll your own handmade, that makes better sense. Because in order to have a better handmade, you still need to farm a lot of legendary handmades. If ANY legendary can be recycled for this universal token, it just becomes way too easy.
---
I‚Äôm at the same level you  are. I took a break for a few months and just came back last week. I‚Äôve just been trying to explore places I haven‚Äôt been to. You may think you‚Äôve been to all of them but there‚Äôs probably at least a few you missed. 
---
As I‚Äôve been exploring them I‚Äôve been getting random misc quests that are keeping things fresh. I‚Äôm also completing a lot of events just to see what kind of plans I get. When there‚Äôs a nuke zone, I head to it for the double xp and legendaries. Taking all the levels I gain and unlocking all the crafting cards/improving my character‚Äôs build.
---
Yay! Happy squatchin‚Äô fellow Rebuilder!
---
seems inefficient considering how big the batteries are in the fallout universe
---
Thats great!
---
forgot to take your adderall today?
---
Well I got the regular one with a bell but no skull. I‚Äôll have to keep at it!
---
As someone who keeps 5 pieces of super mutant slayer armor and zelots a horde of super mutants or the SBQ do nothing to me. It could be 5 wooden troubleshooting armor and and even imposter would do very little dmg to you. Full set of vanguard and you'll still get messed up
---
üòÇüòÇüòÇ
---
I‚Äôve had good luck server hopping Harpers Ferry.
---
Worked for me wearing the Blue outfit/hat.
---
They have now offers to help level us up
---
What platform? I can‚Äôt check before tuesday but I think I have a spare plan, if so I‚Äôd be happy to give it to you.
---
I got this problem too, did you find any solutions?
---
DCG and Power fist have identical damage on my non-Bloodied unarmed character. But the power fist mod adds a small amount of armor piercing, so theoretically it does more damage. It‚Äôs also slightly lighter.
---
do you always think negatively?  try being positive for a change.
---
There's a shovel not far from the event. There's YouTube tutorial about where to find it
---
I sit in a feed back loop of grinding resources so I can continue to grind resources.
---
Hornwright testing sight number 3 there's a large cluster of iron ore right next to you when spawning, and there are more nodes if you travel north east and follow a dirt path. Above, below, and on that path are more nodes. With Excavator, it's around 240 ore, which nets you around 800 to 1k steel with super duper. Literally takes less than 5 minutes to gather it. You'll need about 100 to 150 acid though.
---
I had a Alien Commander pop up in my hud near the satellite array but never found it.. only a metric ton of 
---
They might be random encounters because it‚Äôs near a site that is a spawn for one. 
---
Or I‚Äôm losing my mind because of all this Sheepsquatch poison in my body from my hunting excursions....
---
I really hope we can indeed just set prices for each item we want to sell (and hopefully this doesn‚Äôt have to be set everytime we log in).
---
Nice. I wish he would‚Äôve reappeared though...
---
Wait, so if I put all 50 in strength (which I didnt) than I can get 7 more for another?
---
That's it so far
---
Ohhhhh... okay. So the first 7 dont count towards the 50?
---
I‚Äôm under the impression Mothman cryptids (both in-game and Irl) are supposed to have owl-like qualities. 
---
Point Pleasant has Mothman Eggs, so, maybe owlets?
---
Great pic! Honestly, I haven't encountered Mothman yet.
---
Okay. Good to know. It kinda sucks how they did 76. At firstbI bought it and than stopped immediately cuz the engine is the same and all, it wasnt until my friend started playing with me that I literally cannot stop playing.
---
He's probably wondering where your beers' at.
---
So the bodies when they die will go where they spawn, if this happens the body will show no loot. Wait for that body to become a corpse pile and you will be able to loot your legendary. This happens to me all the time in the burrows, it's a huge pain in the ass.
---
I have one.  750 caps.  I'm on now if you're interested.
---
Are you still there??
---
It seems there are some problems in localizations. English version has different quests and they work. Try to make them, they are 
---
1. Take a photo of a player holding flamer or chainsaw at night
---
2. Take photo of a Mothman being in asylum outfit and hat (you can summon Mothman in daily quest on a lighthouse, outfit is in fort defiance)
---
Are you on now? My GT is domafett513
---
Awesome this would be great thanks so much for doing this
---
People don't realize wat all they miss when they fast travel everywhere
---
What law is that?
---
twin peaks hard access, tallest point
---
Head to Rob Co on the hill up to the entrance is a destroyed sentry bot and a bunch of robots with good scrap laying about.  Sentrybot always has a nearly full fusion core.  Hop servers and loot until you have your fill.  You do not have to engage anything just jump in grab sneak away.
---
I'm not sure if this works. Where does that corpse pile show up then?
---
Call me dumb, but I don't know where that is on the map. Can you tell me where it is?
---
Hell ya thats cool your lucky. I havent even encountered him yet.
---
north eastish of white spring. marked on map
---
You can put max 15 perk points in a category
---
Okay :o thank you. I will give it a try :)
---
Twin peaks is mount senenca
---
I'm not talking about max per perk. You cant put 15 in every slot. Can you?
---
Hope it will work, good luck üëç
---
How do we get in contact with someone from XBOX?
---
Your guess is as good as mine.
---
I think is possible that you need to target an alien while sitting on a beer keg :P
---
That's where alot of people build though? 
---
I don't want to have to find different worlds to finally get my camp down
---
It‚Äôs the latter, we probably haven‚Äôt prayed enough to our lord and savior atom so he has not yet sent the great zetans
---
No one knows what it's like to be the bad man to be the sad man behind bug eyes.
---
Used to have my camp there months ago left bc of others building there
---
The secret is good charisma and luck.. it really does effect the quality of gear you loot. also trading and duping big reason players have complete sets of assassin sentinels and the godlike 3star weapons.
---
This is so great.  If I can use the camera to look for the \*\*\* ghoul that disappeared into the tall grass in the Mire, this is certainly the single best feature of the camera.
---
If that‚Äôs a concern, simply make certain damage cards incompatible with another, problem solved.
---
I want to hug him.
---
It does not drop good loot or anything special. The event does, not the body from what I gathered
---
Ya I rather not have my camp not placed because a 2√ó2 wooden shack is there lol
---
 I used this for awhile... it's a great resource.
---
Arms -er.. wings? Are open for you?
---
Great band
---
Still haven't gotten one. I get excited all the time then I'm like aww. Walk off disappointed and looking for something to shoot afterwards.
---
Second floor in Calvin ‚Äòs Office on the left wall
---
If you start capturing multiple workshops and see a high level fast travel to a defend event you are at, be weary, as they may be looking to pvp
---
The way i "farm" them is by doing  "A line in the sand " event in Fort Defiance. Rewards two full cores. Can easily get them by server hopping. Just remember that the event sometimes doesnt show up in map until you go there in person.
---
There is 4 right? Or only 2?
---
Found one about 10mins ago, thanks anyway.
---
I can make those bugged hidden creatures magically appear out of the ground without fail, simply by finding a bed and sleeping for a sec.
---
Best thing to do is go to deathclaw island, take the shovel from there and keep it in your stash.  When the event triggers just grab it and voila.
---
Do the Collision Course Event at Morgantown Airport, cargobot there counted for me.
---
Ya know they could of made him like Grahm. Made him nice and stuff then it would be FUN and easy to be his friend haha
---
You didn't include the other Wasteland photographer, Anne, who is most likely the namesake of Anne Geddes.
---
Is it wrong that my first emotion was "awww"?
---
I'll be on tomorrow, busy today
---
Yeah I‚Äôve just recently gotten into trading a bit on the market and bazaar
---
Happened to me on PC as well. And it cut "Just a fair weather friend" &gt;:(
---
Same here.
---
That‚Äôs cool. No worries
---
they are crafting components for the weapons you can build from plans you get from that event
---
I was server hopping at Whitesprings to see what nice gear had been sold to the vendors that I could nab and almost missed the tourist.
---
What's the issue
---
Grand exchange
---
They don‚Äôt always lock the extractors though ;)
---
Auction house
---
That's what I usually think tbh
---
Don‚Äôt hold your breath, won‚Äôt happen any time soon, and even when they do, it will probably be just lazy ‚Äògold‚Äô or ‚Äòsilver‚Äô skins that literally take only minutes to create.
---
That‚Äôs why with the ‚Äúconsolidated and combined‚Äù cards I have recommend would not be stackable with sub components.
---
Fallout 4 found the alien by following blood trails after the space ship crashed... Can see it being something just as simple, or yeah a really rare encounter
---
Can not repair pass 100%, if you have the perk should be repaired like most weapons to 200%.
---
A centralized player hub would make sense to release now. Enough vault dwellers have left and become established enough to set up a  permeant, if very makeshift, central city.
---
*Sneaky moth noises*
---
You are stretching saying they are pay to win. It is more worrisome about what else they add
---
Ah shit that why mine breaks so fast
---
There were 9 in the crates near the Harper's Ferry vendor for me
---
Naw, just walked out the back door of the clubhouse and had to take a photo.
---
4.4 seconds in your pip boy is more often a death sentence than an advantage.
---
This advantage nullified.
---
Especially for being "vengeful", he looks rather content.
---
Or you cannot go into a PVP battle with a busted ass weapon. Then the question of repair kits is a moot point. But people need something to gripe about so.
---
You claim it‚Äôs not pay to win... Try repairing in Survival mode.
---
I had just finished one game and had some time before the next one I wanted to play came out, so I figured it was time to finally give it a try. So far I'm glad I did.
---
4.4 in the **favorite wheel.**
---
Repairing beyond 100% also increases damage output.  So we are losing out on durability and damage output for months.  Does not seem like a super hard issue to correct?  Not sure why the long delay?
---
It works :D  
---
The first one "Take a photo of a player holding flamer or chainsaw at night"  is the one with the cultist clothing in the german localization.
---
It doesn't matter if your weapon is busted or not, heavy guns break fast with or without perks. Even with Gunsmith 5, my TS hunting rifle breaks fast.
---
That's probably true, but I ran across Ansel when I was trying to start the Bucket List quest, not Anne. And, besides, I'm only familiar with Ansel Adams.
---
I‚Äôve found it twice now at the cemetery up near the fort.
---
Id also do electrically charged if you have it!
---
Enclave Military bunker- search the desks for tech plans.
---
Dump at armory. Repeat.
---
I agree
---
Reinstall or at least revalidate your game? I almost never crash anymore (PC). Used to crash a moderate amount up until January but stability is vastly better since then
---
i did that, it didnt work both alive nor dead. its problem just a glitch and you got lucky or i got screwed
---
Smoking is bad. Mmmmkay.......
---
Then I wouldn‚Äôt bother w/ heavy and instead look more at Gun Fu, Adrenaline, Tenderizer.
---
Keep a shovel in your stash. Boom! Problem solved.
---
Lens... nightvision fucking LENS. 
---
More non-obtainable challenges adding to the list.
---
SO basically nerf everything except pistols in that case.
---
That's just a lower dps Rifle build.
---
Destroy!!!
---
Yes! üòÜ This is actually the only form of social media I've ever had, and I started it last week.
---
Savage... while i hear you, in all previous fallouts you could reload if you mess up.

It is when the server is lagging.
---
If it starts happening, jump servers, and the problem should go away.
---
Oh, SBQ was landing after I used "Follow me" emotion. Yeah, several times.. Maybe, they are really want to be friend(or atleast collective) with us..
---
Es is gut) 
---
I think all localizations had false quests due to bethesda's changes in daily atom quests. I have russian and also heard about same thing about french one. I suppose localizators have a list of quests to translate for a week or month or some other time period. So, they did not react for some quick changes.
---
I was inadvertently doing this when I was lower level and really couldn‚Äôt figure out why. Then I realized that as a two handed melee build with the Adrenaline Card maxed out, my Damage on my the Grognak Axe was over like 700 at one point versus starting at like 350. So it would go from 3-4 hits to take out a glowing one to one shot killing Legendaries. 
---
Now at public events, I lower the adrenaline card to rank 2-3 and and much more mindful of that.
---
I suspect we will continue to get them from the Ever Upwards questline!
---
Same here.  If two things are fighting each other, my DPS is *dramatically* reduced.  I can see the health briefly go down in white damage, then it bounces right back after failing to register some portion of the effect.
---
I've also noticed that high level super mutants seem to have incredible perception scores now.  I have a base 23 AG with armor/underarmor effects at full health, which only goes higher once a couple unyielding pieces kick in, not to mention temporary food and drink buffs, a full 5 piece suit of "harder to detect while sneaking" \*\*\* light/sturdy armor that's entirely modded with shadowed/muffled/ultralight (aside from one stabilized arm and a dense torso) and trying to farm West-Tek without immediately being in \[danger\] has been virtually impossible since Tuesday.  I'm not rolling in guns blazing.  I get a headshot, retreat to a secondary then tertiary position, but I seem to get spotted through walls, crouching dead still in a completely dark corner, then I'm forced to kill everything in the building while in \[danger\], only to have it persist after the place is completely empty.
---
To my knowledge, there are no mole rats, radscorpions or radroaches in West-Tek that would otherwise bug out and mess with my concealment, which are the common culprits.  Enemies that are supposed to crawl out of the ground sometimes glitch and become all-seeing oracles that share their three-eyed raven abilities telepathically with every creature in a 10 mile radius.
---
Stealth really needs to be worked on in 76.  Sometimes those same supernaturally aware enemies push me aside trying to find me, (HEY HAVE U SEEN THIS MAN???) and other times I have 0 chance of avoiding detection, as if all my perks and mods aren't being applied, and many times when there is absolutely nothing even close to me. (in the Enclave bunker, the Whitespring Hotel, Trains Stations, etc.)  I can fast travel no problem, but lose all my sneak attack bonus and healing factor mutation until I get annoyed enough to quit out of the game and restart from desktop.  (sometimes a server hop doesn't even fix it, because I guess some random mole rat or hidden radroach that never popped out of a garbage pile can follow me to other dimensions.)
---
If I somehow need to get sneakier than maxed out AG with shielded raider underarmor, a full \*\*\* suit of "harder to detect while sneaking" light/medium armor with a couple first tier unyielding pieces and three second tier AG +1, all possible sneak/concealment perks and full shadowed armor mods with two muffled legs and an ultra-light arm, that seems like a tall order to fulfill.
---
Welcome to the new game, titled "not the previous Fallouts".
---
Powerful automatic if your commando hardened for rifleman
---
LOL. Just took a print screen of one. Never thought to pull out my camera.
---
The Garrahan‚Äôs experimented with the pylon system to sabotage Hornwright‚Äôs Auto-Miners, but they were dangerous. So Vivvian just kind of kept them in storage until her cousin sold them to Wolf for extra cash. 
---
Wolf was a ‚Äúfixer‚Äù for The Bysshe Company. An oil  and gas company, but based off the Assaultron research, I‚Äôm pretty sure it‚Äôs some sort of front. I actually asked a similar question, and the answers there might prove helpful if you look at my post history.
---
Seems to be a system where the person who is most vulnerable attracts the most aggro..
---
LOL! Last night doing this solo. I got the 10 blood bugs and 2 Legendary Sheepsquatch!
---
I give 0 shits about repair kits. They're pretty useless.
---
No.
---
Sorry... I am indeed wrong... Flatwood monster is separate. :|
---
Use a Govt Requisition and snap it as it flies away.
---
It's just a much much lower dps version of Rifles using the same stealth/crit setup only with far less perks left over....
---
The ridiculous challenges coincide with the reveal of p2w items in the atom shop. Pretty clear what's going on.
---
The vengeful variety spawn on a cliff overlooking The National Isolated Radio Array a bit. I camp near there so I've seen them three times now, and that's with not really logging on super often. There's another spawn somewhere a little south of there, not far, but I have only found that one once.
---
I think I might have a few of these
---
Looks like the easiest way to find the "right daily description" is to change the localization into english if a daily does not work for you.
---
I guess I just haven't run it enough, I've only gotten the vanilla Shepherd's Crook plan.  Thanks!
---
Yes, my primary weapon at Whitesprings is my Ghoul Slaying Grognak and not being able to repair it to 200% like my other weapons is quite frustrating. In the meantime, I have an Anti Armor backup but it‚Äôs certainly not ideal.
---
That's really awesome.. I never ever considered that the port-a-diner would have a different animation that actually delivers the pie! I salute you, wastelander, for your persistence!
---
nice work I never tried the emotes, mostly I pull out my Sparklers and yell "Who said we can't dual wield weapons!"
---
Looks dope af üëå they sell these little led lights for ten bucks at Walmart , throw one in there and u got yourself the coolest fucking lamp I've ever seen
---
Thanks as always...  
---
1) Known.. Will include in the next weapons round up.  
---
2) Known.. Will include in the next weapons round up.  
---
3) Known.. Not sure how much of a Bug this is, as Super Duper is weird
---
4) Compiled and Added
---
5) Compiled and Added
---
6) Have a note on the Camera, the "Power Slide" is well, the new meme....
---
7) This is solid data, and more or less reproducible. Explains allot...
---
8) The FC Drain seems to be Erratic, which is problematic. Loosing multiple 25% cores while standing in my camp, and also having 200+ Spoiled food, makes me think the two are tied.
---
9) Documented and reported, seeing the same.
---
10) Tracks with what others are reporting, and is a separate issue from Legendaries dropping nothing....
---
I tried out this perk early in the game, as it was really good in previous iterations, and apparently the Mysterious Stranger is still in training as of this prequel.  Incredibly anemic, but at least he grabs a bit of aggro when you're low level.  Beyond lvl 50, with a non-hybrid casual build, he just doesn't really provide anything worth any perk investment.
---
So it‚Äôs 317 days, rounded up, that you‚Äôd have to play it consecutively. You‚Äôd have to leave the game on over night, 24 hours a day, seven days a week, just to get that in that time frame, verses a solid month from what op proposes. I did the math. I agree with op.
---
what even is the bug, i was able to complete it just fine on ps4
---
Thanks that‚Äôs what I was looking for
---
It‚Äôs not really obtainable. It‚Äôs in there for an easy hours played counter.
---
It costs about $1200.  It's a good problem to have but it's an expensive problem to have.
---
Thanks for the information!  
---
Documenting and reporting the new ones...
---
If you could grab a screenshot for the glowing green ground it would be awesome.
---
I‚Äôll be on in about 5 minutes, give me a shout when you‚Äôre about
---
Go to you event tab and turn it back on, same problem for me
---
I'm on now, I'll shoot you a message on xbox
---
Absolutely not.  If you're high enough level to get Bloody Mess, the Stranger adds maybe +1% DPS.  He shoots very slowly, spazzes around a lot and doesn't do much aside for show up for his participation trophy.
---
For sure
---
I didnt get a notification for this message, but thank you alot for the help! Im currently following this slaviclyüòÑ
---
Its on the roof lol.
---
Oh okay. Thanks for the info
---
I pray to God that a Protectron is voiced with that line.
---
It would be a great perk if you could use him starting from lvl 1, mainly to grab some aggro.  He seems to have a bog standard .44, so he might kill a lvl 9 scorched for you.  Against a single lvl 68 super mutant, let alone a group, he may as well not be there.
---
Server hopping is your choice.
---
Thats hard to say as a user without insight in the code. I started the quest when it came out went donw into the basement where i got the quest to brew some nukashine.  Then i took a break, an when i came back later to do the quest, it was gone from my log. I can brew nukashine in the basement, and already did, but this didnt progress the quest and i also cant give it to the robot.
---
I also tried geting the quest again at a post, but this didnt work neither. Now im stuck without quest and no option to restart the quest, and since its now an online game im stuck here waiting for Bethesda...
---
There will be a cave to the left of fluffy down the stream a bit. A scientist will have a note and some other things you have to find.
---
Mine works fine, but I built it before the last patch and haven't moved it.
---
It always seems odd to this GPU peasant how these hugely expensive GPU units keep having so many weird and wonderful problems playing various games. It must be really satisfying though when you get them purring along and get to enjoy superb visuals :)
---
Oh that sounds like a pretty awesome idea. I was planning on making it a display piece anyway
---
You do realize continuously citing this "law" with no evidence makes you look like an imbicle, right?
---
Looks familiar. Think I had my camp around there back when I started.
---
Still don't have the camera. Have given up finding it. Back to making hard chems to dull the pain ***of not having the fucking camera.***
---
Nope
---
Ive had a few quests disappear and with some quests I had to redo parts because they reset
---
Where it spawned. So if it came at you from another room search in there.
---
It only took me about 5 hops for the camera. The x01 jet pack mod took about 50.
---
Perhaps only the Wise variant of the Mothman doesn't count for whatever reason?
---
If you have multiple copies you can be on both and trade with yourself
---
I'm assuming this is more or less what it's going to be. A player run vending machine like the ammo / aid vendors. Or at least that's what I'm hoping for.
---
DO IT! lol I bought some for my kids as night lights, but they're bright, color changing, with a remote for brightness settings, one even has a mic so it lights up when there's sounds, and there 9$ and some change, I like the nuka cola paint tho, that's sick frfr
---
The DCG, Power Fist and Mole Miner Gauntlet are all pretty comparable. Which one you should use depends on what legendary variants you have for them. Though I will say that I find the Power Fist to be the overall most practical since it takes up less screen space in first person and has a thrusting animation that makes it easier to get headshots.
---
Reported on Patch 8.0 Roundup, will include in one of the larger ones...
---
What location did you hop in, oh wise sage.
---
I saw some strange fog at whitesprings
---
Added, seems to be linked to an Audio issue (as some have theorized)  
---
Colonel Kelly monument
---
OMG........    
---
Beyond funny.
---
Noted! Ty
---
I don't know how happy the community would be with it, but a "Factions" update could be rolled-out with different spawns based on the faction, replacing the Vault 76 player spawn and allowing time to march forward to progress the story. Maybe utilize different equipment sets and bonuses for each faction (BoS and Enclave get uniforms and laser pistols, civvie factions get specific outfits and ballistic weapons, et cetera)? Vault Dweller characters could then seen as a sign of veterancy, paired with rank. Might be better for roleplay and repairing canon if they make a way for it.
---
They could allow us to make protections and have them as vendors
---
Is meant as a joke
---
I agree lmao
---
Only the responder, or the firebreather aswell?
---
fair, new strat.
---
I generally just clip the wings, but go with whatever works for you!
---
We had the feature in Fo3 and possibly New Vegas (been a couple years since I played it), so it's clearly within their capabilities.  I don't recall it being anything particularly useful.  I'm a smoker in real life, and I've honestly never even given it a thought.  There's plenty of hard drugs and oceans of booze to keep my dissipated lifestyle thriving.
---
I'm sure they have the capability of implementing it, but it seems like something very low on the priority list, given that we can still wave to a friend while holding a camera and be rocketed off into western Ohio, or possibly have the camera disappear from our inventory for no reason at all.  Or that killing the SBQ or a random \*\*\* ghoul and have it vanish into the ground with no meat pile in sight is very much part of our reality.  I'd rather they fix that shit first, and promptly.
---
actually if you remember the pre beta video they actually had the planters from the dlc of fallout 4 in the video 
---
I'd also like glass in my windows or at least shutters
---
Why does everything have to be actually doable? I like it being ridiculous.
---
You can trade items, but not caps, by joining a team, putting your stuff in a world container, logging out, switching characters, and using the rejoin team option. This only works for items, and if the server crashes or the last team member leaves, your screwed.
---
I destroyed my first turret club camp yesterday, even used his stash and workbench to get my fatman and make nukes.
---
It felt \*good\*.
---
just the responder fireman uniform mate that's all I'm after I'm not too bothered about the helmet as I don't wear masks much
---
Or multiple consoles. Works great on the PS4. I log my wife‚Äôs toon in and trade away with my toon.
---
My windows have shutters! I can open and close them.
---
did you make that house or move in?
---
Yes please! 2 is all that's needed. So much wasted time when I'm at my shop crafting PA for customers and say someone nukes the queen. Sometimes it takes a good 5 minutes to swap cards, check my weapon to make sure the damage is correct, go back and get the card I always end up forgetting. 
---
Not asking for 30 different loadouts. But 2 would be phenomenal
---
It‚Äôs a joke challenge, and probably only obtainable if you never turn your pc off, and reconnect every time the game crashes.
---
Calibrated for semi-auto, tweaked for auto if you use VATS.
---
Calibrated has a 2x &amp; Tweaked has 1.5x base damage multiplier on any critical.
---
If you're a Sneak/Crit/VATS build nearly attack outside of \[Danger} is a critical whether the console displays it as a critical or not.
---
If you interact with him after the Event he gives you a +5% Experience bonus.
---
It's definitely worth doing when it pops this weekend because of the already double exp.
---
*Don't forget your Cranberry recipe for +5%, too!*
---
Personally, I've never seen him, myself. I've always been too busy elsewhere when the event pops and he's never stalked me in the wild.
---
I *did* see the smoke trail he leaves when he darts upward once.
---
I heard a big whoosh while turning around and saw it going upward.
---
if u have it then I will buy right now if ur able to sell now
---
lol happens with the camera equipped &amp; thumbs up emote as well.
---
Thanks for posting...  
---
Question, did you have it already before the Disease Challenge? sometimes if you start with a effect it won't count it properly unless completely cleared and re-added.
---
From public health law center website.
---
"On June 22, 2009, President Barack Obama signed into law the Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act, giving the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) comprehensive authority to regulate the manufacturing, marketing, and sale of tobacco products. The new law represents the most sweeping action taken to date to reduce what remains the leading preventable cause of death in the United States."
---
Maybe try reading the poster again outside the frat house.
---
Wow that's super annoying
---
No, they are in the game permanently.
---
Hate that one... can't nail down which patch that was introduced in, but it was before 8.0
---
What if i don't know where it spawned?
---
I know the mod exists, but I don't want to use it and be randomly banned for a simple, unapproved QoL fix.  Until they officially give clearance to a list of approved mods, I'll just spend 10-15% of my play time swapping perks.  It's annoying at times, but not the end of the world.
---
Teapot, southwest on map is where i hopped a few times and found dead tourist laying on picnic table in front of teapot. Msg a few players nearby and they showed up for the tourist too. You think it is impossible at first but it is easy.
---
This was easy to achieve with the old MMO‚Äôs like Everquest and World of Warcraft. 
---
Looking back now, it‚Äôs almost embarrassing the amount I have on my old EQ account. Started in March of 99.
---
The broken Dailies are frustrated, they are random, so exactly when/if they will pop up is a little erratic for some, question do you think it's the same or worse since Patch 6?
---
Wack! 7600 or no dice
---
I have all serums.  25 caps if you supply flux, otherwise 460 caps (what I get from robot vendors)
---
You are not the first to report this..  
---
Question, Platform?
---
Sadly not, sorry mate
---
PS4 &amp; it‚Äôs been constant on my pipboy radio since two updates ago. cuts every song off before it ends. i don‚Äôt turn on world radios so idk about that.
---
I wish I could‚Äôve experienced that. I‚Äôve never seen him outside of the event. I visited the moth man town and was reading all of the lore surrounding him so I kept watch on the watchtower waiting for my opportunity to see him.... I just wasn‚Äôt prepared for how gigantic he was and for him to just be staring me in the face. 
---
If I saw him in the wild, I‚Äôd probably do the same. I sadly always have to travel alone so I‚Äôm constantly on the lookout for any movement in the corner of my eye to vats and pound out really quick. 
---
(Ps thanks for the reminder of double exp. as level 30 still after wayyy too long of playing, I‚Äôve been incredibly looking forward to it)
---
You don‚Äôt have to, but it‚Äôs a legendary. One of the things you need to find is outside of the circle a bit. Keep following the river until you reach the lake.
---
That happens in build mode sometimes. I had to exit and build again, then I could put things down.
---
scrennchot was taken in february, so maybe the guy is now 1500 or so xD
---
[https://i.imgur.com/PJE9sU0.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/PJE9sU0.jpg)
---
Its like AWOL armaments, as soon as its up its completed within 5-10 minutes.
---
Thanks!  
---
I'll include this in my Quest round ups, but it's an oldy.
---
I run two shot explosive gatling gun with all heavy weapon dmg perks and demolition expert perks and it is godly
---
Just found him south of Pleasant point on XB1. By the way you can't finish the challenge since there is no alien in the game if you doing the photograph challenge.
---
Neither.  I use an AAE combat shotgun.  Instigating is only good for one shot.  Ghouls are soft, but you still need a gun for other targets.
---
Put not for sale things in your stash
---
I dunno if it‚Äôs the ‚Äúbest‚Äù spot, but the one time I‚Äôve seen it was on the road near the fissure site near Uncanny Caves
---
Metalcore is awful
---
Wolf doesn‚Äôt work for garahann, he just bought the pylons from them, and hid his stash there. Bo Peep was Calvin‚Äôs handler, who gave him assignments and supervised him.
---
Oh shit thought the flatwoodsdude would count as alien! Thanks anyway mate!
---
To be fair, FO76 isn‚Äôt that type of Game. Heck, even my No Man‚Äôs Sky save just topped 600 hours since release.
---
Oh wow that‚Äôs insane
---
Because the sloth doesn't move fast, and when it dies, the animation is literally to slump over. It also seem to weigh too much in the game so it's not going anywhere. But in a fight where explosions are going on, or things are moving fast (like dogs, gulpers, deathclaws) when they die they can end up sliding or moving, or getting knocked away (especially by grenades).
---
Physics is entire client side, and that can move bodies/corpses just about anywhere.
---
ü§£ Dude it doesn't break immediately and its predictable.  I know my AAE SMG gets about 3k rounds before breaking.   I set my expectations and plan accordingly when I am doing pvp.
---
No it doesn't unfortunately. It does however for the combat challenge go figure. It's called a Zetan for the camera and it doesn't exist until otherwise. Maybe will get snuck in the game at some point
---
Lets cross our fingers
---
I've got a couple to sell. 3k?
---
Level it and farm the owner for caps
---
They can still request your guns, aid, and ammo
---
Weapons have enough durability to where they don‚Äôt break if your paying attention. Most encounters can be completed if your weapon has at least 30% durability, and weapons are fairly cheap to repair. The only legitimate use for repair kits is during long fights without access to workbenches (scorchbeast queen), or if your using a weapon with very little durability (minigun shredder.
---
Not if they are in your stash
---
lmao
---
The one time I saw a mothman it flew up and disappeared
---
Long post and completely wrong. I have the oldest PS4 and my game runs without staggering , lag or crashes. Full stash box. Then check Oxhorns or Juicehead videos, if my game runs like they‚Äôre, I would not even play it. And don‚Äôt tell me they have weak PCs lol.
---
I was just in the high 30's last week, myself.
---
Using the Cranberry +5%, clearing out the Side Quests in my log, and trying to mark every location on the map pushed me to 51 today.
---
Still a long way off from the 100+ people I see on servers, though.
---
Tried to help with a Sheepsquatch yesterday and got hammered. ;-;
---
So if you don't want someone to request your gun, just stash and use you fists on everything? If your about to die just leave your stimpacks in your stash? You can't have everything you dont want to sell in your stash.
---
You are very lucky
---
You on PC and want some of the 1 star stuff I have?
---
Because they aren‚Äôt quite as marketed to teens as Fallout 76 is. 
---
I believe this is an internal decision at Beth that doesn‚Äôt reflect their beliefs; however, those of the stupid parents that buy their kids these games. 
---
They are being logically illogical.
---
The power fist with the puncturing mod has the highest damage and some small armor piercing, and is the best. Following this are the deathclaw gauntlet with the extra claw mod, then the blades mole miner gauntlet.
---
If you‚Äôre selling items, put not for sale items in your stash, it‚Äôs that simple. And you can lmao if you have enough room, your inability to do it is your fault lmao
---
Won't be an option for all items but if you paint an item with a paint scheme from the atoms shop it doesn't even show up when trading. That's what I did with my Unyielding Sentinel BOS combat armor... Just wish I could do it to my Fire Axes.
---
Is yours a PS4 pro at high res?
---
I'm just saying your method won't work 100% of the time. They still might request your gun that you use, or the aid you use.
---
Wow.  Ok.  That‚Äôs interesting .
---
It's kind of a workaround, but if you have an atom store mod on something, like a paint job, it can't be requested.
---
Lol it‚Äôs almost like federal commissions pick and choose where and how to apply their laws based on who is donating to their super PAC of choice.
---
Every world radio I‚Äôve encountered has been in sync with my pip-boy, and radios placed in my CAMP also don‚Äôt start until it‚Äôs in sync with the pip-boy.
---
How? They are in your stash
---
Exactly.  They always want to buy my best guns.  Which is why I carry them.  I actually use them not hoard them for caps.
---
I'd like marsupial, adrenal reaction and electrically charged.
---
Ign, BranSolo
---
I‚Äôll give that a try üëç
---
get rid of bloody mess 2, four leaf clover 3, better criticals 1, replace with level 3 better criticals and level 3 critical savvy.
---
get rid of tenderized/2 charisma and get level 3  sneak &amp; covert op
---
get rid of traveling pharmacy/1 strength and get level 1 adrenaline
---
use calibrated/tweaked receivers on your guns, instead of hardened/powerful automatic.
---
enjoy 200-400% more damage in VATS
---
Yeah there's the Plague Walker Mutation, but also for area damage there is the Tesla Coil mod for power armour torsos. Electrically Charged and Unstable Isotope mutations that deal energy and radiation damage respectively to melee attackers
---
Isn't there a body in one of the TNT domes?
---
How the fuck are you gonna use a gun in your stash box?
---
oh yeah didnt thought about RadX :D
---
The Syringer only has mods that let you do poison damage or reduce damage resistance, or for an enemy to spawn a bloatfly on death
---
Are there guaranteed spawn locations for him?
---
What seems to happen to me is if my radio is on in my pip boy and I turn on one of my house radios the radio will kick my Pip-Boy song to the next one and they will be in sync
---
Skyrim over 2k hours, Planetside over 1,2k hours and i don't know how many thousands of hours in Guild Wars 1.
---
7,6k is possible in a game if there is enough interesting content and healthy, dense community.
---
After 120h I'm done with FO76. Now it's like: Login after an update and solo clear the new super difficult endgame dungeon in 10 minutes. Impossible to reach 7600 hours.
---
If it's Bloodied, it deals both good ballistic damage and decent radiation damage.
---
You can get the Grape Mental plan from events or buy it at the Whitespring Bunker
---
Seen mentats different flat @ the enclave bunker medical wing
---
These both sound amazing. Spawning a bloat fly on death is exactly the creative ideas I‚Äôm looking for. Any idea on how to get that ammo type?
---
Mr fuzzy tokens, and biv even though got all his recipes. Daily caps. I've been sick with the flu so skipped a couple days. Noticed a lot like doing the sbq over and over too, some good stuff drops there. The new imposter sheepsquatch has a legendary gutsy sometimes, got some 3\* max stuff off of him.
---
I haven't farmed the latest events yet with the sheepsquatch. But basically biv, tokens, and daily caps (using crafted serums and dropped guns to sell). I gave up on the market but have a buyer who takes my extra lead and steel. Really nice guy on market traded me a assassins/cav metal arm and signs plan for x01 emergency protocols. Friend doesn't play anymore so it's kind of demotivating. Pvp server is fun too, there's really a lot to do in this game.
---
Same. Vengeful Mothman has been stalking the area around my camp for roughly two weeks. Wtf.
---
Thanks for your replies. Will need to decide if I want to switch up to VATS or just stay with my regular rifle build for now.
---
The medic bot in whitesprings sells it occasionally. It was about 800+ with 3 hard bargain and 6 natural charisma. I think Ive seen it in the enclave bunker too.
---
 Side question, is the portable toilet bugged? I leaned the plan yesterday but logged off and Im unsure if it didnt register me learning it or what. I rarely see the plan in shops. Also obligatory what platform?
---
Take it out after you‚Äôre done trading, duh!
---
It‚Äôs the people that hide and don‚Äôt contribute that hurt the event odds. If I‚Äôm there I know we will kill her so I go. The other high levels do the same thing.   Nothing compares to the feeling in game to standing in a line with 15 overpowered combatants. 
---
Last one I went to we had 6 total scorched beasts spawn including the Queen. Scorchbeast steaks for days. They were shredded.
---
Ah ok, Thanks :)
---
I love everything about this wholesome moment.
---
Yeah, it's a quest and a random event, it's just a deathclaw
---
Who would go into PvP with a nearly broken weapon anyway?
---
Added you now!
---
Full :(
---
Thanks yeah I just found it in the medical bay in the bunker. I forgot there was even a vendor over here. Regarding the portable toilet I‚Äôm not sure because I don‚Äôt think I have that plan. I play on PS4.
---
Is there any weapons similar to fallout 4‚Äôs sacrificial dagger or Korvah‚Äôs tooth (or whatever it‚Äôs called sorry)
---

You can find 4 Eggspots at Highland Marsh North West on the map SW from Abiies Bunker.
---
I got one. Ps4 tag, PizzaAndDeadlift
---
15 radiation damage isn‚Äôt that much in PVP, most players will have *some* rad resist, and it‚Äôs useless in PvE
---
Sent request. Siestafied
---
don't mind me human, i'm just warming myself here
---
Oh it's in wavy Willard's if you need that information
---
You on ps4?
---
The sacrificial Blade mode for the machete looks like the tooth.
---
Tse I like tuned over hardened. It's not so much the damage on a handmade as it's fast as you can pull the trigger with little recoil. Bloodied, hardened gives a lot more damage so. Perforating mag for the 40%aa
---
It's hard to imagine a more meaningless complaint
---
I got my camera at the graveyard by the Kelly Monument.    A quick hop.
---
Yeah, unfortunately that's not working this time. Tried fast travel, restarting the game, nothing.
---
I think there is 5 vendors in the bunker, I'm also on ps4 if you'd like to trade any duplicate plans you have. Psn is kit_cloud
---
I run through Blackwater's mine and scrap everything the miners have. Usually yields around 50-60 per the five minutes it usually takes
---
That looks rad! nice work man.
---
K what do you want?
---
Why smoke when you have chems?
---
No just normal PS4 but that‚Äôs not the thing. The thing is the game runs smooth even with tons of different items in stash and character. I know what you trying to say,
---
Been to a few events and each time couldn't find the SB...  the crowd seemed to be roaming, so does the nukezone stay after the SB is gone?
---
If instigating puts you at 1hit levels, it‚Äôs better. Otherwise... depends on how many hits it takes you. Think of it this way- 2shot adds 25% damage. Instigating adds 100% if the target is at 100%. So assuming you‚Äôre doing solo PvE and your targets are always at 100%, Instigating would have done 500% damage by shot 4; 2shot would have done 500% damage by shot 4. So at shot 4, they‚Äôre equal. If it takes you less than 4 shots, instigating wins. More than 4, twoshot wins.
---
You are a true hero!
---
Mysterious savior seems to show up about 50% of the time, like how life saving armor works 50% of the time.
---
How important is bloody mess for all damage builds? Is it a staple? I‚Äôm only running 3 Luck atm
---
I‚Äôd prefer that over a vending machine. Would be nice to be able to build a nice shop / counter around the chap.
---
Ts hunting rifle.. That's as easy to manage as it gets. They improved the break on heavy too. With 2 gunsmith and 200% it's good enough for anything imo.
---
I do this a few times daily. Keep your eyes open for AWOL, Leader of the Pack, Uranium Fever, and Horde events.
---
Been a while since I played but there‚Äôs definitely premium cigarettes that you can only sell as they‚Äôre counted as a valuable. I thought it was only tobacco that you could actually use, guess not.
---
Ah on PC.. Sorry

Does anyone know if the tourist is in at least one of those spots per server. So if I looked in all those spots would I find the tourist at least once a map? I've been server hopping Wavy Willard's for an hour and haven't found anything. Getting tired of Free Range event and I've done all the main quests. Just trying to find something to do in Appalachia :/

or it could be a mutation "Addictive Personality"

Should cap at 76. They seem to like that number and it'll provide more build flexability

What if your stash is full? What if you not near a stash box? You won't always have access to your stash, you can find players who want to trade ANYWHERE.

Interesting as it runs crap in my PS4 pro. Yet I‚Äôve seen PC run great. Im at level 230 now and learnt many plans and recipes. Wonder if my profile is just bloated now. I do remember it ran better at lower levels.

Targeting his needs 5 crimson flux, and recon sensors needs 5 fluorescent flux.
---
Well, if you build on the cliffs east of whitesprings you get some good views west. Same with the east side of the savage divide, overlooking the bog or the more. It‚Äôs not a full mountain but one side is amazing views.
---
 Mine does 60 Rads and 50 Energy. Is that unusual? I kept it for countering Bloodied builds.
---
Its 15 pct flat damage on everything. Its a solid pick for sure.
---
You can.  I do it daily.
---
It's been said before, but Diseased often counts as Legendary as far as drop tables go.

Radium isnt energy bud

No, there aren't. All of them can be smoked. What you may be thinking of is the method people use to collect all the cigarette cards: buy as many as you can, discard them (instead of smoking them) to quickly get the card and empty your inventory, rinse and repeat.
---
Gorgeous view, swell screenshot!
---
The SBQ spawns and you have 25 minutes? Or so to kill her, she leaves if your time runs out. I‚Äôve never heard of her not spawning. If you‚Äôre late to the fight it was probably over and people are farming raw flux.
---
Go to any large dungeon with scorched or super mutants (west tek, grafton steel, etc) and equip scrapper. Pick up all of the weapons, armor, and junk that enemies drop. This should get you at least 250 steel scrap. You get more scrap with high intelligence, so if you have unyielding armor, put it on before scrapping. With 23 intelligence (8 base +15 from unyielding) I get 20 steel scrap per assault rifle, and can get over 400 steel scrap from harpers ferry.
---
Hunt for rare recipes (tech data turnins, treasure maps, certain quests). Look for better legendaries (upgrading my bloody 50cal to a bloody explosive 50cal would increase my DPS by 32%...).
---
It's my camp.
---
You are a bitter jerk.
---
I just warned a level 30 guy who was parked on the golf course that he was begging for trouble. 
---
Then I noticed 50 yards away so guy had a mansion built, complete with a massive BOS statue out front. Also massive industrial water filters ... locked. 
---
I don't do PvP but i'm willing to bet that the mansion builder was parked nearby, just hoping someone would attack his place. 
---
The level 30 guy was nice. Didn't know better. I crafted him some stuff and suggested a farm where he could get stuff for his brewing quests.
---
I came across one last night at the rest stop below the Investigator's Cabin. 
---
At first there were just glowing Mole Miners, and I started sniping them from the clifftop behind the building. I was down to the last one when the Lv 80 Legendary Noxious Sheepsquatch wandered in from across the road.
---
I'm only level 60 and doing a sneaky sniper build, so I'm glad to be up on that cliff top! First I try using the Orbital Strike thingies from MODUS on it. Barely scratched it. Tried tossing grenades, but it avoided most of them and I already bombed the cars earlier. 
---
Ended up plinking it to death with my trusty sniper rifle. It couldn't path up around the cliff, and stayed in the parking lot so it could only quill me a little. If it had gotten up to eat my face I've been toast!
---
Mothmans a huge batman fancryptid. He is roleplaying being batman.
---
DM me your name. Might be able to help a bit with your gear.
---
Downvotes, but absolutely the truth? Lol
---
  My mistake, I've never used it. So that's Ballistic Damage along with the Rads.
---
Your stash is full, make room, and you‚Äôd probably need to get to a stash box to pull out for sale items
---
Tenderize is good for any weapon, and it never hurts to put more points in endurance to gain more health. Endurance also has good perks like fireproof, ghoulish, and lifegiver, so I would recommend that.
---
I‚Äôm with you, OP. Leveling an alt and got the quest at 20 or so. No shovel at the site. Ah ha, I remembered there‚Äôs a shovel at Blackwater Mine. FT there, get the shovel, FT back, problem:  it‚Äôs a lvl 45 shovel. Hah I said. Not really I said something else and not polite.
---
I make new characters for a new playthrough. I have three 50+ characters I abandoned. Right now I play hunting rifle only, no legendaries other than weight reduction. Hard as crap but rewarding
---
I didn‚Äôt think anybody would want to buy them or trade for them  so I‚Äôve been just going to events with low level players participating and dropping them off 10 at a time.  The only ones I have on me right now are the cryo grenade, mole miners gauntlet, and Ultracite left arm. I gave away at least 50 duplicates yesterday because I needed the inventory space. Nothing too crazy, mostly housing items like pool table, ice machine, etc.
---
I used him against a mirelurk king. I don‚Äôt know if he spawned in the wrong spot and couldn‚Äôt get a clear shot, but it took him a full minute to pull the trigger. Meanwhile, I‚Äôm frozen and the king is going to town on me.
---
That‚Äôs the gamma gun too. Radium rifle is 15 radiation damage.
---
My main character (lvl 130) can solo fight two of these. One clip per sheep from Choo Choo. I've been trying to level up my second character today (now level 40). I saw the event and joined in. Wow. At that level, I see why everyone is saying that it's crazy. My AAE shotty was just making small dents. I resorted to cleaning up the extra pests after getting in some decent damage. That made me appreciate the new cryptid way more.
---
Honestly it is strange, I have seen lot of ppl complaining about PS4 pro performance. Some says to clear your database on PS4 will improve the performance. Don‚Äôt know how to do it, newer had to, but may be worth googling, if you have problems.
---
Are you still there?
---
How do you get the balcony blueprint?
---
Nice dude! 
---
I would like to see a system where all legendary corpses you can loot get a map marker. Queen meat piles in the bog, invisible dead robot sheep, fast travelling upon meat piling ghouls. Shit is getting out of hand.
---
Thank you, will do!
---
Yap
---
Last night. We still got her but had a very large crowd.
---
It happens after it‚Äôs nuked sometimes. Mad drops of one star stuff. It‚Äôs like the server is stuck. I farmed whitesprings yesterday and it was like that, plus all the flux was still everywhere but it was sunny and nice.
---
Im waiting for the war rider paint Blood for the Blood God!
---
You'd think they'd have fixed this by now lol
---
I would suggest pick a location and hop till you find it (or get fed up!).
---
Every.single.time
---
I wonder what they touched to mess with this?
---
I might just scrub it down and reinstall games.  If i do I‚Äôll let you know what I find
---
It's so hit and miss. I've seen two one stars and I've had runs that yielded ten with multiple 3 stars. I still like WS, because it gave me a TSE Railway a couple weeks ago at the very end of my run. I did three runs today, and almost everything went into the ice chest.
---
Yes, I was down near the NAR Repair Yard.

Or just remove equipped weapons and armor from the trading menu? I feel they‚Äôd be more open to doing that, rather than giving away free Atomic Shop items.
---
Just dont accept their trade offer lmfao..
---
Leader and UF yield lower level legendarys (but you get multiples). AWOL is a guaranteed 3 star at the end at max level.
---
I frequently see them on the cliffs between the Savage Divide and the Mire
---
 Yes I am confusing them. ;)
---
So it‚Äôs commonish. Hasn‚Äôt happened to me before so maybe introduced with last patch.
---
Only the wood walls with windows have shutters.  We would really like them for the brick, metal, barn, and warehouse sets as well, that or glass.
---
Honestly not in my experience. Appreciate it may for some players. My internet connection is pretty high end fibre. Might be the difference. my PC is 6 years old! Played for 6 hours today. No disconnect or lag to speak of.
---
I completely support your idea, and I'm already using atom store paints for the same purpose. What I'm still not sure about, though, is whether **any** painted item is invisible to others, or just those with paint jobs the other person has not bought/learnt. So that in a worst case scenario a griefer that has all the paints can see everything.
---
Sure you can always make room in your stash, you still won't have your stash everywhere so you can put your not for sale gun away. Also why the hell would any one want to keep taking things in and out of their stash because it is or isn't for sale?
---
I don‚Äôt know anything about fuzzy tokens (I‚Äôve seen them I think, but that‚Äôs it). Do tell
---
This is how change works in business. Small changes are easier than large changes though large changes net the most profit and change is a spectrum with increased size of change at one end and increased success at the other. Understanding change is key to growing a business.
---
Placing a small change is good long term if building towards a larger change. Bethesda knows this and are counting on people to defend against their own self interest since they are planning on moving these transactions in insidiously. They promised not to do this but just did it with this update. They lied.
---
This is a step towards larger paid content changes, changes like patching the game to making repair kits maximally viable or including totally new, invasive micro-transactions. They know small changes increase success. They will include more. I wouldn't be defending any of this unless you want to pay to be a mage in ES6
---
Where do you turn in tech data? I don‚Äôt know anything about that.
---
 I dunno imagur has been black for me for some time now. It used to show me stuff.
---
Another solution, put your mic on say as I stated earlier ‚Äú hey guy that gun and 3 stims are not for sale‚Äù that‚Äôs all we god for options
---
Suppress
---
It is new content.
---
The amount of new players compared to players already playing is ridiculous.
---
Drink Nukashine and get teleported somewhere random and explore.
---
Yeah, level 213 now, and I started the weekend at 209. Good stuff. Make sure you check out the new event at Fred's Barbeque, OP. Not gonna spoil it but it adds onto the Cryptid questline that got released a few weeks ago
---
Hell no. My camp is on twin lakes. I don't need him spawning there for my second character. My main can make mutton out of that thing. 8 shots from Choo Choo does it all. Tse Railway. My second character is level 40 and barely dents him with an AAE shotgun.
---
Almost right. The Diseased prefix will simply overwrite the Legendary prefix, so every legendary enemy that happens to also be diseased will only have Diseased in its name. That's why you will also see Diseased enemies with one to three stars added at the end.
---
Yep. Enforcer perk crippled his legs and then I threw things at him till he died. The imposter is is the real sheepsquatch.
---
Dope!
---
Lmao...this is hilarious
---
This makes no sense.
---
They have hidden it on a random dead guy. The amount of random dead people on this map.
---
I loooong ago gave up searching and looting dead corpses. Just like I have anything practically in a locked container. Because its all pointless junk. Its not like Fallout 4, this is all literally junk. 
---
So the fact the expect new people to persist in looting every dead corpse so they would find a camera is insane in itself. Unless they stumble on it in the first few hours.
---
You can do a couple of things;
---
* press the search button while trying to drag an item that uses the material and it'll untag all the materials that you have
---
* There's a button when you ooen the junk menu, it's R1 for ps4 dunno for pc or xb1, that allows to see all mats that are being searched for. You can untag them here. Can't remember if it requires you to have an example of the material in your inventory like it does when you tag it this way.
---
That is the most practically solution, but sometimes on console (I'm not sure about PC),you may be in party with your friends and you won't hear anyone from the game chat. I think the best solution is to just ignore the request. Also, you never mentioned anything about using your mic.
---
I got 3 within a 24 hour period including 2 in a row. None before that or since.
---
Correct. Garrahan just provided the pylons, without any knowledge of what was going off.
---
But a bunch of other characters smoke regularly, so I don‚Äôt see this as the main reason.
---
Haven't seen that happen since January... we lost that one too, if I remember.
---
Camp venture, it‚Äôs part of the BoS questline. Gotta get that far to turn it in.
---
I'm on very good internet, can download at roughly 20mbps. My pc is well beyond what the "recommended" specs for the game as well.
---
Pc master race so y‚Äôall should be able to figure it out, I‚Äôm on Xbox and I literally can shoot them a message saying ‚Äúnot for sale‚Äù
---
I vaguely remember that. What do you get in return?
---
Its not really organic when you have already explored the map though is it? Nothing can be organic at that point. Especially something so "small" as a camera and a minor questline.
---
Sheepsqurches can spawn everywhere at Deathclaw spawn locations!
---
Good luck mate
---
You mean the law someone linked right below this? Sorry snowflake I wasn't on reddit when you asked. But it seems you got your answer for what law. :)
---
Thanks and you too
---
Just ignore it?
---
Sometimes aid, often ammo, very rarely you get rare BoS outfits or BoS power armor paints.
---
And for this you have to literally look on reddit for an idea of where the damn dead person would even have a chance to spawn.
---
Im sorry, but months after the game is out. The vast majority of players playing Fallout 76 are not brand new players.
---
Without even a hint of a clue as to where the person was. Its stupid.
---
I got it at the water park. I'm not really sure how many hops. I was watching something on Netflix on my tablet while I did it so I wasn't really paying attention.
---
Using your mic, ignoring the request, and messaging them "not for sale" are all much better solutions then putting it in your stash box.
---
Can I ask what gun your high level uses?
---
Difference is it being the PC or an NPC.
---
Ok, leaving now. Made a four people a little happier, that was a good day
---
There's a downvote bot or two that seems to hit every post.  Don't worry about it.
---
i use automatic receiver, maxed out tank killer, master commando, expert commando and glowsight
---
Best option is to put atomic shop paints on them
---
Sweet, got on here to find where the sheepsquatch spawns and this was the first post lol thanks!
---
Maybe it is the Mothman that needs to be in Asylum clothes and hat?
---
I'll see myself out.
---
You guys have the absolute worst priorities.
---
Fair point tbh, if you've already been there it gets more awkward, gives cause to re-explore I suppose?
---
It's just a useless and unhelpful comment. It's also our choice to play the game at all, or to continue breathing. Those aren't helpful things to point out though.
---
yeah I noticed fog by my camp yesterday and it looked great
---
How do suppressor weapons work? Anyone know? Is it suppressing damage 20% for 2 sec each hit,  or just the initial hit, then nothing? Hoping it would suppress up go a percentage then stay as long you keep hitting the target?
---
Hell, I got a cryolator, an endangerol syringer, and a camera in my inventory. It's time for some experimental queen fights.
---
I don't try test instigating. but yea i think yes
---
By the way It ok reload while sneaking
---
TSE Railway Rifle (10 per clip) is my new main and a TSE Combat Shotgun for backup (8 per clip). I actually gain rounds using the Railway because you can loot them like a harpoon. If you mod the Railway to auto, it gets all the advantages of Commando (9 ranks) and Demo expert (5 ranks). I'm renaming it Choo Choo MF tonight or tomorrow morning.
---
all you need to do is have the camera in your hand and you can either emote or go into photo mode and do a pose
---
\^this
---
Stats cap at 15. You stop getting points at level 50.
---
I think youre fine Ive seen many people with TSE guns shoot at the brahmin and nothing happened so if that doesnt hurt them i dont think anything will
---
I have heard a rumor that plague walker mutation can hurt them though
---
Thank you! I was wondering if the rule applied to just the base Special or not.
---
Railway rifles are so good
---
I think it's been since at least 2 patches back.
---
I had an effect with zthe word zetan in it that boosted intelligence by 1. Any idea if this is related?
---
seen it happen when she takes a long trip out of range and stays gone for 20-30 seconds.. seems distance causes people to lose target/tags and allows her to regenerate her health where you are basically starting over again from scratch when she comes back.   
---
its very annoying. especially when half or more than half are melee there and shes only landing for 10-30 seconds before flying off again..   
---
i really think there needs to be a mod for the railway rifle to do like net shots where they can launch at say the cost of 4 spikes and some rope (cloth)? that grounds a flying creature or immobilizes it for 1 minute, something a heavy could do for mob control maybe with a side effect of lowering its defense allowing melees to really cut loose into whatever it is on the ground.
---
Although it is probably the best option, not everything has a skin available for it in the atomic shop.
---
I got a drill from the imposter sheepsquatch then someone nuked fissure prime and I got the T-45 jetpack then they nuked it again and i got the t-51 jetpack its like the game was sorry it gave me a drill
---
There's some hives just west of valt 76 by the haunted lake.
---
My first Railway drop was this TSE. I then paid someone to mod it for me because they're stupid expensive to make and scrap for mods. I bought the combat tse for 5k caps at level 50 off the market. I'd advise anyone who is frustrated at that level to save caps up and buy a big gun.
---
I thought the were event drops only.
---
They are easy to find in the cranberry bog.
---
They are worth every penny tbh the reload noise is worth it lmao
---
Agreed its weird that we don't have this.
---
It‚Äôs a combat rifle, but either way it‚Äôs quite good.
---
18 legendaries is quite normal unless those ghouls spawned at a lower than max level; in that case, there might not be a single legendary around. What's more, you seem to have missed the four or five ghouls at the houses to the LEFT of the golf club. ;-)
---
Quantity is not the issue at Whitesprings, but quality surely is. The lvl 42 ghouls don't drop max level loot (I think they are lvl 42 for exactly that purpose), only the charred ones do, and all of them still drop way too much wood armor.
---
I usually have to discard **everything** I pick up on a WS run, it's only every fourth or fifth run that something *good* pops up (and the only thing that's better when all the ghouls spawn bloated is the loot level), and maybe every 20th run I'll pick up something *awesome*.
---
That's what The Grind (TM) is in this game. I wished I could freshen it up again with a Watoga run like I used to, but ‚Äìalas!‚Äì the legendaries have left that town. :-/
---
Yea, I mean I have the camera now. It took ages and I finally found it on top of the lighthouse.
---
I really enjoyed the bucket list quest. I loved going back and taking pics of the pumpkin house and red rocket etc. I even ran into a legendary sheepsquatch walking to the pumpkin house.
---
But I had a purpose. I knew what I had to do and where to go. It was enjoyable. And I enjoy the camera challenges too.
---
What I don't enjoy is having to fast travel all around the map looking in every nook and cranny in areas as huge as that fairground etc in the hopes of finding a corpse cus there is no direction from Bethesda.
---
Daily in camden park. Grind to 450 tokens to get the fuzzy suit and head

Oh ok thx

My son is 4. He loves the train noise on reload. Plus it blows up all cars in one shot. He really likes big explosions. The reload sound is why I want to rename it to Choo Choo MF. It's so much fun!

That assumes you either know someone is a griefer before trading or you just never trade with anyone.

I mean, its not like half the game doesnt have the same weapons, for the few that are worried about others knowing, why not just not trade with others if they are that paranoid?

It was your choice to comment that.

Get all the crafting perks. With unyielding, perks and chems like berry mentats you can make more durable power armor.
---
Yeah, you know, I walked all over the supposed area of interest circled on the map, and couldn't find 'nary a unruly golfer feral ghoul to save my life.
---
I thought of the parking lot too, and killed a bunch of feral ghouls there, but they weren't GOLFER feral ghouls.
---
Just garden variety unruly feral ghouls.  
---
And the game wouldn't give me ANY of them.
---
I was SO annoyed (a common sensation when I'm playing FO76, BTW).
---
Hopefully, this resolves this.
---
This is so cute.
---
No way good sir
---
Paint me like one of your wendigos.
---
How do you want to play?
---
I think bethesda wait for you to actually buy skins to prevent accidental selling, since 'atomed' item are bind to you (but a lot of weapons are still missing skins in the shop, so we will see) .
---
However, I am not sure to understand, people can see your weapon: so what? (if that bother you, you can always refuse to trade). 
---
Anyway, trading between players may change at the next patch with vendor machines. I am curious to see what they have done with this.
---
If your son likes explosions, you should show him a mini nuke haha
---
Nope. Set it to 25k if it's not a god drop and see if they bite? I bought a serum from someone today, and they went all aggro when I declined to sell them my main weapon (AAE PS). They cooled off before I left, so I didn't come back to say hi with my higher level player.

I have shown him the Daiseycutter in action before I put it away forever. He likes the cars exploding the most w the Railway so far.
---
Cool, thanks!
---
Killing the ground minons make her land
---
I N F I N I T E L O O P
---
I play heavy weapons and melee. Im happy with the perks I got. I just hate the constant switching as it is.
---
We grind for 3 star gear. Help lower levels. Farm flux. More grinding for outfits. Tweak our build. Test out new builds. Fight the queen. Grind for gear some more. Trade. Refine our legendary hunting techniques. Nuke non traditional locations. Do challenges. More grinding. Just run around with friends. Obsess over new content. Take pictures. More grinding. And then some grinding.
---
I did the same thing because I thought I could just make another one since I know the plan, and the tourists don‚Äôt have it on them for me either. Sucks lol.
---
Power Armour already lasts forever though. I have no complaints with that or fusion core usage.
---
Yea it happens sometimes
---
Can't tell you how many times i have accidentally equipped items in Borderlands because of that feature.
---
I did it alone, I thought it would be quick, by the time I am done, the server turnt empty :(
---
But I just don't find it fun having to constantly switch perks all the time as it is.
---
Don't get me wrong I like that I can change my play style, I need variety in games, that's why my stash is so screwed, cus I like having all different types of weapons. But there is only so much for me.
---
this needs to be tested.
---
Definitely worth it IMO especially if you use more than one weapon type. 15% damage for EVERYTHING
---
*I lost so many junk due instant crashes after the latest patch, it takes away the fun!*
---
*This is just bad, really bad! What is Bethesda doing?! I guess they only are interested in micro-transitions!*
---
I forgot about nukashine! We drink tons of nukashine.
---
Great job!! Did you happen to do any testing on suppressors effect? Thank you again!
---
Smart kid cars exploding is way more cool lmao
---
No problem
---
I have GOT YOU MAN, but i won't be on until 10pm EST. Can you hold the handmade?
---
Yes as fast as i know
---
I see it a lot over the Morgantown Airport.
---
Not possible to add pics besides linking them on imgur
---
Sure thing, I'm joining to you! :)
---
If you just turn from the grave and run straight down hill, there's another shovel around a junk pile.
---
Cause smoking is for losers.
---
Same here, I went ahead and completed the quest and got the Perfect Storm SMG, Plan: 10mm SMG, Plan: Light Metal Legs
---
Uncanny caverns spawns them randomly.
---
Name?
---
Given the illusory nature of free will, I beg to differ.
---
*What na√Øve!*
---
Is explosive drastically different from two shot? From what ive heard explosive ups damage per projectile
---
Looting paper bags is just part of the game. If you want to be cool and help someone recover their stuff, that‚Äôs awesome, but you arent obligated to do so. If you just find some random paper bag with good stuff and nobody around, that‚Äôs yours man. Their fault for dropping it, or the developers fault for making it so easy to drop random things without realizing, but not your fault for picking it up.
---
Even if it was some crazy TSE perfect roll, what are you going to do? Just leave it there to probably despawn?
---
"Chinesium" lol
---
Good point even if you try playing with full health you always pick up random rads from food and such. Often wondered this myself.
---
must be night :) if we switch server will the time change?
---
Well there's your problem right there bud, you should be back in the park with ricky and me getting the trailer all wired up for the big grow, Leahy's been sniffing around blabbering on a bout shithawks and things are getting fucky!
---
Also way cheaper. He knows what he likes though. I managed to aggro WS robots doing it once. Bonus explosions. Your sentry bots no longer scare me...
---
I like that option in borderlands though. I would agree I do it by mistake, but would still rather have it.
---
I really like instagating in pve on my main. Taz pretty much explained it, you're one hitting with high health builds. I have a instigating combat knife and love it. Instigating dragon one hits cargo bots for nuke cards. It's kind of a ghetto way to be closer to bloodied without all the low health management.
---
Yea, but you haven't actually read the text of the FSPTCA, have you?  
---
Here it is: [https://www.congress.gov/bill/111th-congress/house-bill/1256](https://www.congress.gov/bill/111th-congress/house-bill/1256)  
---
The game is not "advertising" smoking, and no other provisions in the bill would apply to video games.  
---
This whole "there are federal laws that prohibit smoking in video games" nonsense needs to stop already. It doesn't exist.
---
They're good cause they attack your enemies. Just don't accidentally  hit it or it turns red.
---
Completing quests and events.  You don't find them in the wild
---
Correct. (Btw it is 56 not 57) each perk starts with an allocated point each at level 1. You can max 3 specials to 15 with 7 remaining points (because 4 points are already assigned to the other perks by default) to be assigned to the 4 remaining specials. 
---
Or any combination within the limitations. 
---
Once again. 56 points among 7 specials with a max of 15, minimal of 1, in any one slot.
---
Yes I have, and it isn't just advertising, it is marketing as a whole. Just like they had to do away with Joe camel due to him being a cartoon.
---
What you can also do apart from applying a paint job is to answer those requests with a price of 25k, and they will usually get the message. What Bethesda should do is to let us go to 25k when setting prices, and if we then press [right] once more, it should allow us to say 'not for sale'.
---
Just don't shoot her, it's people shouting that staggers her out of the landing animation, it drives me bananas! If no one shoots while she's flying, she will always land, its that simple.
---
The addiction goes away after some time as well.
---
That's just stupid, a few days in game and my addiction just fking went away.
---
And I got them all besides X-cell but just because I didnt want the Xcell addiction.
---
I gave up on Junkies and turnt to Bloodied.
---
Got owned by some low level players.
---
Tho level is just a number and penalty on this game's PvP system, as long as you got the uny/assasin/Bol/Van + sent/cav set armour you can beat 80% of the players who doesn't have it.
---
I wish I saw a mothman this cute
---
I‚Äôm about 250 hours, first time for everything I guess.
---
my pipboy shows military time, can we change that?
---
I think it's the death claw gauntlets. Plus they weigh less. 
---
I still prefer my mole miner gauntlet.
---
The railway rifle is so good
---
Chance to harvest 2 crops at once
---
There's a shovel in flat woods. In a grave behind the church
---
Congrats! I too launched my first nuke;; soloed for the first time this morning and also chose to Nuke the Burrows - I wanted to see how many glowing ones would appear. Went topside when I noticed that none of them were spawning with rare materials. Game kicked me while harvesting topside sadly, but hey...atleast I didnt crash in the silo XD
---
I had an easy experience - used a modified Troubleshooter's Assault Rifle and Troubleshooter's .50 Cal Machine gun that I've been saving for a while. All-Rise helped out as well. Also hacked the turrets - so no bot was giving me much trouble.
---
Do you know which events. I have heard uranium fever may from raider
---
A useless and unhelpful comment for a useless and unhelpful post. I think it's only fair.
---
Smoking a joint or hitting a cartridge is realistically more pc nowadays than smoking cigs. Not that I expect them to add that, but what a time to be alive.
---
I‚Äôll check right away,
---
Ah top of the world..
---
It's your choice to differ.
---
How much are you looking to spend?
---
Yeah. See them every now and then. I think it's ones that are connected to a nearby event. Every time the event at the Responder HQ airport triggers, one will circle the area. That kind of thing.
---
dad?
---
Explosive isn‚Äôt comparable to 2shot. 2shot is a primary, Explosive is a secondary. You can get both in the same gun. 
---
That being said it is a similar boost (more if you want to sink 5 perks into demo expert). Twoshot is effectively 25% more damage with some weird accuracy and durability issues. Demo expert is 20% more damage, small AoE, boostable to 32% more with demo expert, and maybe-maybe not durability issues (I‚Äôve heard mixed reports on that)
---
I originally thought they would increase the cap with future updates. We'll have to see what they do with the "prestige" aka legendary players.
---
I fink u r funny
---
What's your psn?
---
I have both the uniform and helmet.
---
Price is 4k ono.
---
I have one you can have if you still need one. My PSN is pdt0830. Send me a FR and I‚Äôll bring it to you.
---
No u
---
I watched this thing fly half across the map, as far as I could see. That‚Äôs a long ass distance for a spawn üëçüèº
---
Yeah, bit unusual. Lord knows.
---
This is so cool and hysterical at the same time
---
Good bot!
---
what? Gta V came out in 2013
---
This is true, I very rarely see a three star via UF, and that would never happen in Leader of the Pack. People will usually show up to help at AWOL, so don't be intimidated
---
Or they could code a shovel in for the quest? Quest items do not cost weight. Maybe make the shovel used for more things to keep it worth while to have on hand?
---
I can never seem to kill one, honestly. They attack for a bit then disappear. I had one stalking my CAMP during that big Mothman event, so that was pretty cool.
---
I've done this way too many times.  Small heart attakvevery time.
---
Yeah, time will change and I found an night timed server. :)
---
Would you like to sell that plan?
---
That‚Äôs messed up!!! But it makes sense!!!
---
Good job!  I have one i refuse to eat....to precious
---
I did this today at the Encryptid event. On death the Sheepsquatch Imposter actually moved for me and I never would have found it if it wasn't for this tip. As other have said, each person had a different location. Also, after a short while it completely vanished.
---
At least here, unlike borderlands, you wouldn't throw the weapon across the room if your inventory happened to be full
---
Perk Loadout Manager on the nexus does this for you. Gives you up to 12 presets per character.
---
You don't even need to join a team, just a friend's server. Ask him to not server hop for a few minutes, and do what the above poster wrote: put stuff in a world container and rejoin your friend's server with your alt.
---
Yes, it's risky, but it usually works, and it's working even better if your friend is nowhere near that container and not teamed up with you. I had a server kick both of us when I did it with a teammate close by, I only lost stims, bobbleheads and water for my alt, but I considered that a warning.
---
The mad lad did it
---
I would see at least 3:
---
1) Normal play
---
2) Crafting
---
3) Lockpicking/hacking (6 cards there)
---
But I agree, limiting it would be fine with me also.  Maybe 4-5 or so would be fine. Two would be too limited.
---
What are you talking about? is this a console thing?
---
I instaled this mod 2 days ago and only told me to put some file to the data folder and a code line in the custom ini and its working fine for me! !? am I missing something!?
---
I guess it is for the helmet. You need to find the plans for the rest.
---
Not sure, but I‚Äôve seen him spawn near cliff overlooks a number of times.
---
You should have read that it's about destroying a camp, not killing someone.
---
Anywhere I can find the plans
---
Yeah you're right. *Proceeds to pop 10 mentats*
---
I did I‚Äôm I‚Äôm wearing all that your not really gonna stop me from taking out your camp
---
So it was after you unlocked the storage room. Maybe try using the flash fermenter, as it is an optional part of the quest. Might be able to kick it back to the correct spot, because Biv will only take the fermented version.
---
3 hops is all it took for me: Mothman Statue.
---
Do you have a pic? That sounds great
---
Ah, I knew I shouldn't have skipped those Vault-tec botany lessons in the vault. üòë
---
I've seen this same post so many times
---
Each area yields one type.  Can get then from a variety of events.  Casuals are hard to find and possibly glitched.  Raider in events near Pleasant Valley.  Vault I got for main story quests or in the Forest.  Marine in the Bog. Especially Ce sus Violence.
---
I know what I'm trying when I roll out of bed in the morning. Many thanks.
---
I have 2 pieces of each type of weight reduction armor, weapon, ammo, food and chems, and junk. I carry them everywhere and swap out whatever has the lowest weight on me at the time, so usually a 20% reduction to one category and a 40% reduction from two other categories. They are all modded to be ultralight and weigh about 2.5 on average. I have a sniper build, they all have 3 stars with good effects like chameleon, AP refresh, improved stealth, and auto stim. They are the best thing Ive added to my build yet, I start each run out for supplies fully epuipped and under 90 weight with 40% weight reduction on every peice of junk I pick up, I can carry almost as much as I could in Excavator Power Armor and get 5 perks only available on one peice of power armor with chest mods, only thing I dont have is a jet pack but I still carry my power armor for flying.
---
Nope, just checked today.  No body in the autopsy dome.
---
*cries in xbox*
---
Congrats, I just launched my first one about an hour ago. I nuked fissure site prime, everybody on the map collapsed in and we took out the scorch beat queen and a ton of other creatures. It was a ton of fun.
---
Same boat here I have 5 perks waiting to be picked nothing I need or want right now. The only thing I need are better legendary drops. That would make a difference.
---
I'm a comfortable heavy gunner build and can takeout pretty much anything in  PVE but would get decimated by a bloodied PVP build. No interest in bloodied build for same reason as you....  My last picks were the animal friend just to have something different to do...
---
So how long until the rest of us cannibals turn into these?.. You know.. Err.. Asking for a friend.
---
I always carry around my shovel, in case I need to dig a hole or a pit trap or something.
---
I think Runescape might be even worse than those old MMO's, especially if someone has multiple 99 skills in RS.
---
Pushed the heck out of that button, sure did.
---
Thanks. Is this both the protective and shielded?
---
I'm getting linked to some random Imgur shit
---
I'll keep it forever. &lt;3
---
Love how brooding balcony mothman is a vengeful one.
---
I looked up the plauge ridder paint in google, it was in a post on this sub from feb.
---
760 hours is not good. Why? Because I'm currently already at 749, and I don't want to lose my counter. :-) But they sure could have stacked it like so many other challenges: 20 atoms for 76 hours logged, 40 atoms for 760 hours logged, 80 atoms for 7600 hours logged, 160 atoms for 76000 hours logged, ... ‚Äì You get the general idea.
---
you got a link my dude? i'm trying to find it on [Walmart.com](https://Walmart.com)
---
would be nice to have ouftits slots
---
This is a really cool idea, I wish I did it with my character. I did something similar but that was by chance. My character started out friendly and really simplistic in design but then she Went down a darker path and now wears marine armor overtop the tactical ops instead of the friendly red rocket jumpsuit. She‚Äôs friendly but dangerous if you aren‚Äôt so friendly.
---
Did it count as an alien, for you?
---
is_it_really.jpg
---
its been broken since day 1.
---
Long live the Republic! Lol.
---
Ah, shite. Ty for the concrete answer. I'm saving for calibrated shocks, so at least I shouldn't be stuck with them.
---
Nope, unfortunately :(
---
Oh shit. You just won. There's no comeback for that :-(
---
Apart from the Wise Mothman who allows us to commune with Him nope, He chooses where and when :)
---
Yeah had the same problem myself.....
---
Badass pic would make it into a wallpaper
---
So if your special card slots are full and your unused cards are full, the amount of unused ones  (base 7) increases?
---
Here I found some pics, credit to u/thanatos

So here is the graphical issue that happens at night mostly. 
---
http://imgur.com/fggaALi
---
I dont know how to transfer a video to reddit. You arent by chance on xbox are you? My captures are all there.
---
It appears to work as intended, and applies a -20% damage penalty and refreshes each hit, so as long as you're shooting them they will do 20% less damage.
---
It's a mod, uses basic syringer ammo like the other mods. Craft Syringers and scrap me until you unlock it
---
I love the character arch! That's what I'm trying to capture. I dont know where his life will take him that's for sure. Just going to go with the flow. I'll be adding scars after big fights or deaths, and fading them over time. I cant wait to see what he looks like after a few scuffles and once the beard starts coming in as he stops caring about shaving and more about which super mutant camp to tear through next!
---
Now you mention it, about time I update my phones wallpaper.
---
I'll share my spot since I don't think you are able to build there anymore, due north of 76 between the edge of the toxic valley and the forest at the edge of the map. Right to the left of the new raider camp crossroads. To the left of it there is a huge mountain you'll need marsupial+jetpack to get up on.
---
You are failing to realize that the game is not advertising or marketing anything to anyone. Use does not = advertising. I'm gonna stop now because in addition to the bill's language supporting my argument, the fact that Red Dead Redemption 2, which just came out a few months ago, includes use of such products shows this is fact.
---
Are multiple life-saving pieces and/or the Saviour stackable?
---
I got starched genes yesterday and I tried to get a mutation through the Blackwater mine? Farming idea. I don‚Äôt understand how you can buy a mutation but I‚Äôd gladly accept your help sometime
---
Melee is the way to go. Like 30 sec to solo it
---
That sounds really cool, keep me updated!
---
The total weapon damage is split among each of the pellets including the extra one, similar to how shotguns function. If one misses, you do half damage.
---
So you have to activate the three pylons in order to make the sheepsquatch visible. The pylons drain your health, many people don‚Äôt want to activate the pylons themselves because they don‚Äôt want the drain. If a pylon activator dies, the sheepsquatch becomes invisible/invincible so if you‚Äôve activated a pylon you should try your best to stay alive so everyone can fight it.
---
If you're bored it's probably time to move on. There's no reason to force yourself to play. 
---
I'm pretty sure at the beginning there were xp glitches. Having said that I don't have a level 200 BUT if you combine my 4 characters I'm 200+  
---
And that's where I'm at right now. Trying different builds. I even built one specifically for pvp but can't get myself to play survival. 
---
Additionally I want to grind for legendaries but at my own speed. 
---
And I am appreciating the new content. 
---
Not everything is going to appeal to everyone so if you can't find a reason to play, don't. Perfect time to do as well if you're in the northern hemisphere, summer is almost upon us. Hell, my town is actually having an event right now, I just have no idea what it is. Lol
---
Screw the drum mag, perforating instead with max tank killer. It would basically add Anti-armor to that gun as well lol
---
Just confirming, it regularly appears at the NAR Repair Yard.
---
Sticking mini nukes into popcorn balls...
---
You were on a loot server. When you have a streak like that at Whitesprings, hit west tek, harpers, etc. Better than average number of drops and sometimes better quality drops. 
---
I've gone through Whitesprings with only one or two utter garbage drops, then changed servers and hit legendary city. Luck of the server draw.. When on a hot server I just concentrate on farming legendaries. When can't seem to find a rich server I just make bullets and do nuke sites.
---
You will spend more time setting this up than it is worth.  It was great when you could just set a load out within the game, but it's quite tedious to set up, or make changes to your various load outs.  Maybe if you have like 7 completely different playstyles it still makes sense, but for crafting perk swaps, it's too much trouble anymore.
---
Believe whatever you want. You have to keep in mind FO76 isn't just sold in america. There are other countries with laws as well. Chances are the reason RDR2 has them and fo76 doesn't is due to RDR2 not being sold in whatever country FO76 is being sold in as well.
---
It is why the fallout series couldn't call any of their chems by their real names, like medx=morphine jet=meth psycho=pcp etc. Due to australia wouldn't let them sell them in australia if they used the name of the real drugs.
---
Firebreather outfit is super easy to get. Pretty early outfit but i liked that one a lot
---
So Ive modified based on melee.. two vs one vs unarmed, as well as bloodied. Also, PvE vs PvP perks are different as well.
---
What? They fixed that, you can save loadouts in game again.
---
Uh it's just foundations really but it's on the edge of a cliff. You could also play around with stairs and upper floors, this was just easier.
---
Ooo I like that one
---
I'm guessing 1 to 1 but I'm in the US so conversion rates. Lol
---
AAE is kind of pointless explosives already mitigate most armor, that being said most weapons have an armor piercing mag and perks anyway so you can save a prefix (and caps) not to mention your AAE doing 200 dmg isn‚Äôt as good in PVE as an Instigating shotgun with an output of 500+ on a fresh enemy which is what you‚Äôll get probably like 90% of the time. 
---
If you‚Äôre fighting a big boss AAE isnt‚Äôt going to help much either, you might as well take that AA off and get a TS or Bloodied prefix with your Explosive because the little bit of armor ignore won‚Äôt make a difference compared to the extra dps you‚Äôll get, AAE‚Äôs are really only good for semi/bolt/levers and even then it doesn‚Äôt matter if you‚Äôre sneaking and using Vats. AAE is basically a huge scam bro sorry to tell you
---
Nope gives you honey not beeswax.
---
I have too.
---
Look to see if you can do the arms. Scrapping arms or legs can give mods for either limb, but just one set at a time and it doesn't have to correspond to what you scrapped.
---
Is this PC or console. I haven,'t experienced extra crashing with super mutants and I'm running on PC.
---
That's basically it yeah. The damage difference isn't that much between 40 and 50 though... So a decent legendary level 40 would outclass a regular or crappy legendary level 50.
---
Ok but can you make sturdy combat armor into heavy
---
Ok but can you make sturdy combat armor into heavy?
---
Who is Mothman?
---
Oh mate I'm 261 or so and have like 50+ unspent points.. I don't even know what to do anymore.
---
It happened to me in Gad yesterday, teleported me from the southern part of it to the north part of it. Showed in at a super mutant party too, and almost got destroyed because I wasn‚Äôt ready for that. Lol.
---
ahh ok my bad, I dont even thing ive ever looked at the clock in game.
---
All good lol your trying to help
---
I‚Äôve said this before and got the same response: it‚Äôs just a counter for your hours, and it‚Äôs dumb you suggested this. Ignore them and continue because it is a good idea, and I seriously doubt it was their way of displaying played hours.
---
Plate glass windows.
---
No. The weights cannot change. Boy, would people love that.
---
Pretty much. I hardly see anyone doing the sbq anymore either. Too hard to get enough people together to make it worthwhile.
---
No they are different items and require different plans. Not sure how to get heavy honestly think I did trough events.
---
Hopefully they change them to permanent spawns in the future. Are you only server hopping in one place? I did a routine where I checked all the places they could be on the west side of the map (all the Forest, Toxic Valley, and Ash Heap attractions) and only had to server hop once to find one of them. If you have the spare caps and the time, might be more preferable (if that's what you're doing though than sorry, better luck I guess).
---
Yeah that's what it feels like especially if u don't have 3 friends to play with at least
---
Oh... well that changes things
---
Great shot!
---
Ha! Nice! Sadly, it was over by the time I posted this O_o
---
Fuckin A. I have to do it all the time O_o
---
also well rested should be mentioned as it also grants a 2% bonus to your exp unless they changed that.
---
I‚Äôve seen this post about a dozen times, however no one seems to know anyway. The reason is because the only way to summon it besides spending 3k caps to craft a keycard, is by doing Lying Lowe, which most people have already done.
---
The issue with the imposter sheepsquatch is that you have to buy a very expensive component to initiate it after the first time.
---
I'm not angry at you, just angry at the damned Bethseda folks :)
---
Man, if ever there were an origin story for the 76' super hero ... "I am, the Moth Man".
---
i'm sitting at 1500 hours myself, but i like shooting thing in the face lol
---
Grafton Steel, though you have to be really lucky. I spend loads of hours and only found the chest plan so far, which I already had. 
---
Another user linked me to this video a few days ago: https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=bIAWD0vmkwk&amp;feature=youtu.be
---
Another building just next to it, have some stairs leading up. Then you find a room with a Power Armor workbench thingt, in the mounted cabinet next to it is another spawn.
---
Furious and bloodied cant be on the same weapon.
---
Nice! I recently found a max level suppressor/explosive combat rifle and was wondering about it. Does it stack with the perk?
---
I do it almost every day few times if I can get caps for the card, but now I guess everybody fighting real sheepsqach, it‚Äôs cheaper and quite fun and you can do it alone. You can star imposter one alone, but those pylons need to be activated and one person can‚Äôt hold them and fight everything around, you will never succeed. But don‚Äôt worry, usually when you start it, lot of ppl will come to help and most already know how to do it properly. Good luck
---
Why can't you build there anymore?
---
Saw someone launch the scorched queen last night on PS4. Went over there and ten of us were taking her down. After her health refilled, we got her down to 10% and she flew off with 15 min left and never showed up again.
---
Yeah...i have some "safe crackers" sentinel armor, lol.
---
I think this is a great idea. I wouldn't use it, but good lord anything that adds a lot more of a unique feel to player stylings is a plus IMO. Great idea for the playerbase, and hey it's NOT like Bethesda doesn't need fresh ideas for their store.
---
yes they still drop just not on energy weapons.
---
I wouldn't say remove them entirely. Just remove the ability for the effects to spawn together and, in the interest of balance, see if they can go through and reset existing pieces so that the only effect on the armor out of the two is the primary one. 
---
For example, if it's an Assassin's Sentinel piece, reset it so that it's just Assassin's. Vice versa if it's Sentinel Assassin's. 
---
That would be a massive undertaking the likes we haven't seen since the duped item purge and would probably piss off a shitload of people. It might not be worth it but I would give it a thought. 
---
At the end of the day, my first point *needs* to happen. Yeah, it'll drive up prices even more which is counterintuitive to my whole "only the rich and their rich friends would have these pieces and we need to cut that shit out" perspective, but at least it wouldn't spawn any more of these pieces.
---
Same for Cavalier pieces. No Assassin's Cavalier pieces if that's even possible.
---
I ain't seen one in months
---
Only reason I level up now is to try and unlock every single card
---
There are only so many unique items it can drop, you only get one free card (the rest you need to fork out for) which makes it a gamble if you are relying on competent people to turn up and is a tricky fight with random people.
---
You only need one person to trigger the event however soloing it requires a fair amount of resources and a very competent non-Bloodied build/player.
---
Besides the novelty has worn off, is doube exp weekend and we have Free Range now ;)
---
Yeah.  I do need a hug.  That would be most cool. Cheers, mate.  Kinda went off.
---
Is this the o e that reduces charisma, and makes you fart loudly every couple minutes, cause, uh, I had that one and it was fucking hilarious.
---
Where can u find the real sheepssquatch?
---
That is freaking amazing!!

They put a new raider camp right next to it so I think it is now inside the "can't build that close to a map marker. Here is the location on the map if you want to try it:

Just get a Bloodied Explosive with adrenal, it‚Äôs better than furious because it increases with kills and you‚Äôll be one shorting anyway, throw on a powerful automatic receiver with the drum mag and you‚Äôre basically running around with a Bloodied Furious Explosive light machine-gun disguised as an ak-47 (this is what i use pretty much so trust me it melts in PVE and PvP)
---
We don't need limits; if beth is concerned about server space they can be stored on the local machine and validated by the server when used.

Oh ok I'll take a look
---
My buddy has a build based on it. Yes.
---
I have not found one 'in the wild' yet although apparently it does spawn; I have only encountered it in the event Free Range.
---
A quick search for that should net you all what you need to know about it :)
---
explosive is a secondary effect. it never gets put into the name of the weapon. There are only a few secondary/tertiary effects, like poisoner's, that actually change the name. Usually it's whatever the primary effect is
---
Nice! I almost sold mine to a vender
---
Do you use yours auto or as a rifle? I was getting mine modded, so I went with the auto. Hold cow, the recoil is really crazy.
---
Any painted item is invisible because they are untradeable.

Looks awesome man! Post the updates.

*the sound of all your credibility flushing down the drain*

Level raises the stats, condition, and repair cost of an item. Everything else is the same
---
I knda got a p2w vibe just using the basic ones in a silo....and pay to win is pay to win regardless of if it's pvp or pve...
---
This is the right idea but the wrong way of going about it. *Paint* of all things should not solve this.
---
Happening with the gatling plasma as well :-/
---
Yes just picked up a furious explosive 10mm sub the other day, and an instigating explosive double barrel shotty the day before. But no more energy explosive weapons.
---
same here 252 got 40 or 45 some unspent points.. i just use the double xp events to level up a new character, had a pistol build sitting in my char list at 18 for 2 months now.. got it to 54 last night.
---
Yes. I got a tse Railway a week or two ago at WS.

Here is the view: https://i.imgur.com/luZ4Cyk.jpg

That happens with stuff that has multiple stars sometimes. Not all of the legendary effects are listed unless you actually inspect it.
---
Always inspect your legendaries!
---
Yeah I just got one for rail

I'd love broken and full glass versions of windows as well as shuttered windows we can open and close like the wooden ones 
---
that said I'd also like to see sub versions of each material type like log cabins for wood / green house for metal / center block for concrete / bunker for steel walls to give us more choices 
---
I mean I love warehouse walls and the sliding door but man is it a pain looking out those broken windows all the time
---
What?! That's great!  I guess it's time to pop over to Nexus and redownload it.  The whole N&amp;D building and in editing was too much, and it had been that way after several patches, I just assumed Bethesda had blocked it from working as intended. 
---
I don't worry about the down votes, it's par for the course posting in this sub.
---
Just a question regarding low hp builds - how are rad zones dealt with if they constantly tick? Even in PA with radshield my radiation still goes up, just wondering if you‚Äôre trying to stay below 20 if would get annoying
---
Adrenaline scales with kills. Adrenal, the mutation, scales with lower health. It's a must if you're trying Bloodied.
---
ROFL, coming from the dude that already got proven wrong about the law. Want to keep trying?
---
I think you need to relax
---
As for how rough a hunt lol most three star creatures drop only one star items so yes it‚Äôs pretty rough

Fun fact about the cultist outfit, its not just mothman. Moth cult was overtaken by the interloper. Which makes things giant cthulhu monsters.

Tentacle armor!

It wouldnt be so bad if i hadnt been trying for a week to get the stuff to make stable flux and finally had it when fuckstick took it all
---
I'm not sure what you mean but there is no limit to the number of currently unused, unslotted cards you can have in your collection 
---
By the time you get up to level 200-300 you are going to have literally hundreds of unused cards
---
Never carry a bunch of stuff around. Most people will instantly take your stuff.
---
That's cool.
---
I joined two servers today and both were running the imposter event which we completed successfully. Both times however I couldn't find the body to grab the loot which was annoying. I have a card but not got around to using it yet.
---
Didn't see one until I was level 145 and had probably 400 hours into the game. Found a bunch since then most recent one was a quad 44. 
---
I named it Dirty Harry.
---
Hahahahaha
---
Do the event more. I'm still getting new crook options but I'm after the club and staff plans. They all drop from the event.
---
It's all good, I'm just messing around. ;)
---
Well the Bone Raider PA was pretty good. Soon we'll have the dragon T45 PA in the shop. But you're right we need more.
---
You will need to download a dependency for it to work in game again. A mod called SFE which is used for perk loadout manager and the text chat mod.
---
Also, it isn't just the random trolls on this sub, you've got a group of people downvoting specifically you. I tried upvoting to counteract, but damn...

You can learn it by scrapping. If you were xbox I would have modded your gun for free but no dice so good luck
---
i got a question about executioner.
---
it makes me do 50% more damage if target is below 40% hp.
---
if a target is at 50% hp and i swing, will the damage to get the 50% to 40% be normal but the rest of the damage be 50% increased?
---
&gt;Obsess over new content. 
---
LMAO that made me laugh thank you. ü§£
---
Oh god it's like cheese in Skyrim all over again.
---
Good question, I'm actually not 100% sure on that one. I'll have to test it or do some digging, I'll try and get back to you (:
---
You can buy serums that give you specific mutations without having to be irradiated
---
I know, I‚Äôve submitted tickets back in December and also made posts here about it, maybe the axe is too legendary to be fixed by mortals
---
Is it that bad though? With junk I at least understand it (they want to see how much you have to lose), but it feels irrelevant. In survival, they will just kill you when they see you. In adventure, they can't kill you no matter how hard they try unless you attack back. If they want to blow up your camp, you will most likely have the materials to repair it in your stash and not on you. As for weapons, they can't even see secondary/tertiary effects because they can't inspect your items in the trade menu. They will see a two-shot or anti-armor gun, they can't tell if it also happens to be explosive or not. They see your vanguard or assassin's armor, they can't tell if it's also sentinel or not. I just don't see the issue
---
its nice in PVP servers for a sneak build though, sit in a bush with a silenced weapon and chameleon.
---
lol i have one too
---
Yep, this is the point im at now. Just unlocking things for unlocking sake.
---
The problem is, it makes it even more annoying when having to switch cards.
---
Some of us don‚Äôt have mics.
---
I would have dropped it off if i wasnt in the middle of a blast area in whitesprings
---
Reason # 356775432124 why I quit.
---
Whitesprings....over and over and over again. And from the crowds there lately I'm not alone. I tried to launch nukes but I get dumped from the server before I can finish every time.
---
They need to hire back Travis and this wouldn't happen.
---
You're not wrong
---
I use a mix of B/E, I/E and AAE shotguns when farming.  My I/E  DB is a one shot anything under a mirelurker Queen and is my go to for solo farming legendaries and silos.  If I‚Äôm hunting SB and Mire Lurker Queens I‚Äôll switch to my B/E DB or Pump.  When I fight the SBQ I switch to my AAE DB or Combat Shotty as she has incredibly high armor.  I have a TSE DB but I rarely use it as the spread on the pellets is awful and it wouldn‚Äôt be better than any of the other listen guns in their respective situation.  If you can‚Äôt afford a lot of S tier guns, my advice to you is b/e is the best all around if you wana run low health, if not, I/E.
---
Let me know if you want me to link my build.
---
I‚Äôve seen the event a few time but no one actually goes and participates anymore, its always one low level guy trying to complete it solo
---
Got one yesterday.
---
The armors‚Äô legendary effect tiers are completely messed up, that‚Äôs why sentinels and assassins got stacked and people abuse it to the max. It‚Äôs like having a bloodied furious weapon.
---
Pleasure.
---
Casual Shielded might not be obtainable in game.
---
A few months back we checked the esm and although the plan was supposed to be linked as reward to events in The Mire (like Irrational Fear for instance) the levelled list was not properly linked.
---
In almost 1100 hours and countless events I have not once had it drop; I traded for my 'copy' and neither I asked nor I want to know where it came from.
---
Marine is Census Violence.
---
Because the challenge was to do swarm of suiters not heart of the swamp.
---
Because the robots are locked behind the counter, (most of them) where would they get their supplies from? ü§îü§≠  Besides what's traded between wastelanders
---
Frat House in Morgantown. It has at least 25.
---
We just did it. We are nuking the Queen shortly.
---
Awesome!! I'm away from home this weekend so I can't check.
---
Thanks. What about raider?
---
Love me some false equivalencies in the morning
---
The reason is that just like FO76 it is rated M. Fo76 can make cigarettes consumable. It isnt against the law. There have been plenty of games that came out within the last decade that has cigarettes. The fact that cigarettes are in the game already would be no different than making it a consumable.
---
I haven't had anything duplicate, had 15 cores disappear though.
---
Did you rename anything?
---
So you stay in the sub just to make comments like this, that‚Äôs really cool, seems like something a rational person would do.
---
because you cant protect yourself and take items youre not willing to lose out into nukezones?
---
Eh? /shrug. One can still hope for improvements. I've yet to see that.
---
I would like to build those planters along with every single other harvestable plant in the game.
---
Or 4 with green thumb
---
bloodied and furious wouldnt even be that good as furious only stacks up to 30%.
---
now executioner or instigating paired with bloodied? 
---
OR EXECUTIONER AND INSTIGATING PAIRED TOGETHER
---
Haha.  It's all good.  I'd buy you a round if I could.
---
Raider should drop from events in The Savage Divide but again Shielded never dropped for me.
---
Traded for mine, again didn't want to know provenance. Plausible deniability is bliss.
---
Except there are places RDR2 aren't sold that FO76 is. Those places may ban the consumption of tobacco. Just like how Australia forced fallout to change the names of its chems from the street drug names, to their ingame names( medx=morphine, jet=meth, psycho=pcp, etc.)

I'm close to 800 hours and have yet to find any of them
---
Wasteland probs ü§£ yeah I‚Äôve only ever used the wooden ones! Didn‚Äôt realize none of the others had them, that‚Äôs a bummer!
---
Do you know this as a fact? Or are you just using another reasoning because your first one was wrong? Not trying to be a dick, just trying to get the right answer.
---
Sorry took me a min to get back to ya, I bought 3 , 2 for my kids, and one I lined my tv with the other , the green matches the pipboy light so when I'm playing at night I turn it on , gets me IN THE GAME lol
---
The first one wasn't wrong, I literally linked the law elsewhere.
---
i hope theres more about it
---
I remember a dataminer stating the problem with it is that it lacks the ‚ÄúWeapon‚Äù tag within the files, i can‚Äôt remember the post though. If that‚Äôs the case it‚Äôs very odd that they still haven‚Äôt fixed it
---
Sentinel with any other damage reduction is equally broken. The problem is they lowered everything else to 8% (so -40% with a full set) but for whatever fucking reason made all of the UNIVERSAL DAMAGE (sentinel, acrobat, etc) remain at 15% for a total of 75% with a full set. What's worse, they made it stack ADDITIVELY instead of multiplicatively like MOST OTHER EFFECTS IN THE GAME so that you can exceed 100% damage resistance and become immune to damage under certain circumstances. 
---
Sentinel being a tertiary effect is fine, that means it is incredibly rare to get a good combo with it. If it was a primary effect you wouldn't be able to stack sentinel and assassin, yes, but you would have a full sentinel set by level 40. As it stands, many players with hundreds of hours have not even found a single piece. Anybody who has a full set of sentinel's armor bought it from a duper or duped it themselves.
---
... Do other people see it?
---
Like, can I set up an egg on my totally-not-a-murder-room, and go wild to complete the aesthetic for the next person to open the door?
---
Just did the event pretty cool, as soon as I activated it lot of people joined up
---
Atm, it seems like it won't be implemented soon, unless they are going to secretly add it in a new addon.
---
Freddy bbq has event Free Range. In wild it spawns on random places, check road south of southern belle hotel and then walk it all the way north, by the church and the dam, don‚Äôt remember the name but it is random spawn spot too.
---
So he bought the pylons? For some reason I thought he bought the assaultrons. How'd they get the assaultrons then? And what was the point of making one look like the sheepsquatch? Was that just Calvin going off on his own tangent, or was he ordered to make it?
---
War never changes.
---
Iv lost my favorite shotgun but I‚Äôve gotten a ton of stimpacks from somewhere
---
Awesome, thanks!
---
it‚Äôs nickho1214
---
At Freddy BBQ 100% May server jump, but it‚Äôs just a few jumps and it will start it as soon as you load in.
---
How do you start that quest?
---
There are a few passive scorchbeasts,
---
north of morgantown airport
---
a little east of fort defiance (that fissure seems to spawn either or)
---
they attack your bases though, so not truly passive
---
Dude after I launched the nuked I was shouting Wooooo!!!!!!!!! Even called my brother to see the event
---
ATM it seems like it won't be in game for the time being. It hasn't been mentioned by any announcements for the game.
---
However,
---
My theory is that it will be added for an addon/update that is focused towards Faction v Faction stuff. They might add stuff for like the BoS for someone to become Elder. Dunno if they will do that for Raiders, since Rose technically is the leader, and idk about the Responders or Free states, but I hope they all get additions.
---
Yes. Awesome Bloodied Shotgun
---
Sorry to hear that.
---
Casual Shielded is quite nice for perk sharing given that Herd Mentality + Stranger in Numbers CHR 'boost' more often than not does not work for this purpose.
---
Sure, the point is when you stack a bunch of tier one effects you get very OP armor and weapons, then end up keep balancing and rebalancing because of it.
---
Any idea if there is a lore reason why Vengeful one might spawn there?
---
You have a bloodied shotgun?
---
Silver lining is that for flux making you only drop the hardened mass and you can pop on here (usually) and quick buy some for 15-20 caps a piece in a pinch. Or do another once around the nuke zone with Good with Salt on and get a bunch from the glowing ones you tag. Sucks that dude was an ass, but you can still come out with the stable flux you want.
---
If you're having trouble tagging a bunch of glowing ones try throwing a molotov into the horde at the clubhouse. Or any gathering. Just make sure you have pacifist on and throw it in at everybody.
---
Because there's no serious temptation for butching/eating people IRL, compared to the worldwide smoking problem ?
---
Adjust your sensitivity?
---
It's gonna be annoying tbh. With the current meta only people who have broken builds will win and then auction  off the new (probably crappy) gear for more broken gear. Unless you've got a good broken group of friends I'd give up before even thinking of trying.
---
I think it's the roll up door, although I don't recall seeing a barn motorized door either
---
Yes, but that law is about advertising. Having tobacco in a game isnt advertising. So that law does not apply. Hence, why there is tabacco in RDR2.
---
It looks about the same size, but like you said, the garage door has warehouse-only sides. So if they have it in the other variants, I'd love to see them implemented.
---
Indeed! That's the cause?
---
Yeah, like everything eventually it will get old but at the moment is kind of fun.
---
The odds of getting a 3* Legendary Stingwing in the Savage Divide one seem pretty good too which is a bonus.
---
Gotta keep those 1* Wood Legs topped up :D
---
I would love that!
---
Like assassins sentinel/cavalier
---
Then message them or ignore the request
---
Let's just hope it's not an atom shop item.
---
I run heavy weapon + Excav Armor since all character I built in Bethesda games are stealth snipers but will try I have 1 Sentinel Armor plus a set of troubleshooters armor then switch my perks to shotgun or pistol build
---
Speculation after reading all the posts, I for one haven't, stayed away from that and no problems.
---
Bysshe is never really explained, but I think they were some sort of government group, given the covers and code names and such, which would also explain the Assaultrons. I‚Äôm pretty sure the sheepsquatch was Calvin going off on a tangent. 
---
And yes, Wolf got the pylons from Vivvian Garrahans cousin.
---
Looks good with armor over it too.
---
You could check the places it spawns. I walked to 3 before I found one. It was a nice walk.
---
I've only heard of it happening to people who renamed items, never have myself and have yet to lose anything.
---
Hey atleast you got all glowing ones by yourself. You know what that means? Free 6 level jump in 10 minutes
---
Thanks captian obvious. Wasnt carrying a bunch of stuff. Just the shit i picked up to make flux
---
Dunno, probably cos it‚Äôs a medium level area (the mothmen are L45) and because the cliffs are high and contemplative and dramatic. I see mothmen as like moody 15 year old emo boys. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not a phase mom‚Äù
---
It might be pretty good if it does. Suppose 2 guys with the same setup let that ability stack? Lol
---
Marketing is different than advertising, it is why Joe Camel is illegal now, because he was a cartoon that smoked.
---
They made a change a while back, which I assume was to stop people from server hopping to find a specific item that they only sometimes had.   
---
Now instead they have everything, but they raised the prices. So this would be why the inventory does not really change unless someone has been there before you and sold a bunch of stuff.
---
I think more deck slots should be linked to intelligence (because intelligence is almost useless) :
---
What you guys think ?
---
Bethesda really should have serialized all weapon and armor items from the beginning, no two items can have the same ID, as soon as a 2nd piece shows up, the first piece will be deleted, that‚Äôs the only solution to the duping issue. Tier one effect stacking was a huge mess, duper issue made if much worse.
---
Ya. The solo option is where it hurts. In groups rad sponge is a perfect solution, especially with the card-sharing mechanic. But solo players having no similar option sucks so bad.
---
Joe Camel was literally advertising paid for by Camel Cigarettes. It is 100% different than unlabeled tobacco products in a videogame. This law does not apply to this situation.
---
What‚Äôs a Mothman?
---
Especially if you're on even the slightest of hills, which are fucking everywhere in Appalachia.
---
I feel like 3 star legendary mobs have a built in feature where they have a small % chance to poof as you approach them to loot, it's hella fun, working as intended!
---
Okay, then lets go with this. It is why they had to edit out the cigarette the Pink Panther used to smoke because of it. Or the cigarette Lupin would smoke in that anime.
---
Yea you would think that shouldn‚Äôt be too difficult to fix, yet after 8 patches grog is still broken.
---
Is it super rare cuz I still can't mod it?
---
Okay, well, how about this then...
---
Backpacks... For power armor!
---
Like, strap a backpack right on that bastard for power armor players. Like metallic ones or something?
---
Lol damn dude, what did you lose junk wise you're so pissed about? I'll hook you up, I've been there.
---
Worked fine for me using the blue outfit/hat variants.
---
I've got no idea if I was lucky or unlucky, honestly. If you're doubtful of whether I got it or not I can give shots tomorrow when I get home
---
Because RDR2 has principles? Im sorry but its a game depicted back 100 years ago. 100 years ago people fucking smoked. Just like they do now.
---
Luckily the game doesn't take into account political correctness over historical accuracy. Because back then.....people smoked.
---
