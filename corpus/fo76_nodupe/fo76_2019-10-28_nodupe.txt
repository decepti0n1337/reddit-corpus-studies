While I haven’t “uninstalled”,I did shut her down yesterday after jumpin Into adventure wit the other 2 stragglers on the server...
---
Then it said something about shut down imminent In 20 somethin minutes.
---

---
I still don’t know why they needed too shut down the server,(&amp; haven’t seen anything posted)
---
but I bounced wit 15 minutes left &amp; threw FO4 In,
---
updated it,grabbed me a few free things outta the creation club,
---
&amp; loaded up...
---
My God I forgot how much I frickin Loved that game...had my base all Built at that first Red Rocket station,all my power armors lined up all over the place,too many guns &amp; ammo too even process.
---
It was a bit overwhelming,yet satisfying as F.
---
I hope Beth someone can save 76.
---
I do Love the game.
---
But I’ll probably be rockin 4 until wastelanders anyhow.
---
---
---
Preach. Life is about choices not complaints.
---
Do to a glitch I was able to wander past the north boundary. There's some really beautiful areas in the Northwest portion of the map. I was surprised they put so much work into what is essentially an area no one will ever see.
---
I would buy all of these.
---
So only positives can be voiced on this forum?... I am literally not affected by 1st in any way and I personally would like to hear both opinions
---
It was a community reward for the clean Appalachia event
---
Here are the definitions as defined by the ToS and CoC. 
---
[https://imgur.com/a/KbcU4it](https://imgur.com/a/KbcU4it) 
---
It's pretty specific as to what is not allowed which includes things like harassment, vulgarity against others, anything that you do to purposefully cause disruption to gameplay or discomfort to another player just to name a few. not to mention the use of exploits to circumvent the pacifist mode.
---
Except that’s not what it is. Pay to win was coined for games like shooters, where you could pay to get better guns and win better. 
---
Then it got co-opted to shitty mobile games that let you buy gems or some shit to get further in the game faster and eventually “win”.
---
This is not P2W anymore. There’s no real advantage over the common FO76 player. Most people aren’t selling like they’re a business, caring about auto scrapping, or needing another fast travel point. And private servers don’t affect them either. 
---
This is different. I call it “Pay For Convenience”, or P4C. This does not affect anyone but the person buying the personal advancement. I personally don’t see a problem with this: if someone wants to (to me) break the game and have less limitations for themselves, they’re fully allowed to do so. Who am I to say what others should do, when it doesn’t affect me? 
---
Now, the other issue is monetizing things people wanted for free. Honestly, they just need to double the camp budget and I think I wouldn’t care about 1st. It’s still better than what we have now, but worse than “unlimited”, so it’s totally doable. 
---
But remember, it’s not P2W, it’s P4C. That’s my take.
---
Is there a grue?

It’s not NCR veteran ranger armor. It’s just riot gear used by police forces. Just because it’s only been seen in the Mojave area before last week doesn’t mean it’s the only place that had it. Plus, there’s no NCR markings on it, and the chest piece and hand guards both say CPD for Charleston, instead of LAPD for Los Angeles. Honestly, of all the “nostalgia” things to be added to this game, this is one of the more lore-friendly ones.
---
I thought you were the dude who bought mine, but I sold mine for about 3K. I like my furious followed by a dessert of 10% weight executioners.
---
Blah blah blah blah
---
Game seems to imply that they were less then tolerant of anyone that wasn't them. And not even in a "we have to take care of our own first" way. More a "I don't know you now get off my lawn before I shoot you." sort of way.
---
Even at peak FO76 never had a large community. You can have an overall low player base and still have a lot of paying customers. They are in no way mutually exclusive.
---
The whole game is about survival.  If you pay to make it easier you're not paying to win, you're paying to *lose*.
---
Ah okay my bad. Fortunately I do have the freedom to backtrack. What I mean to say is that the monetary value of the atoms in 1st is lower than just regularly buying them. But my overall argument is that if we sit around and discuss whether the subscription is worth it or not we are practically doing nothing because worth is subjective. We are better off discussing the matter based on principle, which I’m assuming we agree on?
---
&gt;You haven't played either game! Bravo.
---
You ever do anything other than leaping to conclusions?
---
I've played over 300 hours of 76. I just haven't played it in the past 4 months. I quit the game a while ago. I don't play it anymore.
---
&gt; It's also better than Fallout 3 and 4
---
100% Subjective. But then again you sound like a shill for obsidian so I doubt you understand what that means anyway.
---
30 hours of content doesn't sound better than fallout 3 and 4.
---
You would rather have actual content/quests/etc behind a paywall than having some camp items that you could either choose to buy or not buy? 
---
...why?
---
I appreciate the encouragement but sometimes I know when I need to call it. Who knows I might want to come back to the game just for an update but I kind of lost the drive to play it. There's a whole ton of awesome titles out there any way! But the next time Bethesda releases anything I'm going to give it a month for reviews to roll in.
---
Have you played the game?
---
Thanks, I missed that we got a new skin - hopefully this helps some other peeps too.
---
No, they added pay to win inside of a pvp game. This is a very appropriate response.
---
They havent, people are just assumiing that because they are upsetting didn't get free servers
---
It absolutely damages this game going forward. Bethesda is testing us. To see how much they can get away with. Figuratively speaking, big businesses are perpetually trying to shove a dildo up your ass. And the dildo keeps getting bigger. And when you pay for this crap service, you're telling them this time it wasn't enough. Stick a bigger one up there next time! And they'll keep going, until you turn around and make it clear that you've had enough.
---
and the rest of us, get hit as well. Because more and more of the game will be monetized, long after they broke their promises. Eventually if enough people leave, the game goes under. They don't care. They got more than enough money back. They'll just start all over.
---
Here is the definition of what you can't do when it comes to the game and other players.
---
 [https://imgur.com/a/KbcU4it](https://imgur.com/a/KbcU4it) 
---
it specifically mentions a ton of stuff that people do while greifing others
---
Cosmetic things sure are fine, but monetization is lately going way too far in the gaming industry and actively telling a dev "You should monetize this!" is really not what we need. CD Projekt admitted that goodies like maps, instruction booklets (since when should this even be considered a goodie?) and even soundtrack CDs actually cost almost nothing to add to the game. Nowadays most games come with just the DVD and nothing more.  
---
Fallout 76 was a full-price title when it launched. Bethesda seems to right now only care about milking as much money as they still can while the ship is sinking. Honestly, I'd rather a publisher/developer would just increase the price of the actual game and provide proper DLC for later monetization. Where have the days of Skyrim, Oblivion, Gothic II and so and so forth gone?   
---
I recommend watching this despicable presentation to understand the topic more:

No worries
---
Oh lmao you're defending the epic store too.
---
Nice way of telling me to disregard your opinion...
---
Not every time, but I have heard a couple of times before.
---
They weren’t perfect don’t get me wrong but its the apocalypse I don’t exactly blame them.
---
So you failed to read this, apparently. The problem is the people who do nothing but bitch and complain because of the new subscription. No one cares about long ass rants about why they're leaving the game or whatever the fuck they wanna bitch about. Either stop playing the game or shut up, easy
---
Europeans don’t have to pay for healthcare so they don’t get a discount.
---
The complaining is so over the top. Private servers were gonna cost some kind of fee so they added some other features to lessen the blow for the people requesting it. If people are willing to spend $10 a month for the service let them have some extra features. I can live without and the game is still fun.
---
Why don’t se stick to what is included in this post... which are all cosmetic things.
---
Why would you rather have DLC and quests behind a paywall? You would rather pay for wastelanders vs having these things in the atomic shop? I just don’t get that.
---
I can get back on
---
[removed]
---
I knew this was coming. ESO has been this way for years and people still play that. Its Bethesda. They just added  an subscription to another one of their games. Yeah it sucks, but it ain't going away now.
---
i think the people saying this aren’t interested in the cosmetic and qol additions this subscription brings. there’s also this weird insistence that now the game is ptw. 
---
nah, it’s more convenient if you pay. you aren’t leveling up faster, you’re not getting better weapons, you have no advantage except convenience. i already like the base game and will gladly pay for convenience while i play. it’s why individual sized bottles of soda are more expensive than liter sized. 
---
this is not a new concept but people seem to be absolutely shocked late capitalism fuels subscription services like this. 
---
don’t buy it then, and give this post an inevitable flood of downvotes since this is the least helpful subreddit on this website and all anyone seems interested in is complaining, othering, and being insufferable know-it-alls.
---
Nice job, you really got 'em with that sick nasty burn.
---
For monthly, you pay $12.99. For the year, you pay $99.99. But if you take that 99.99 and decide it by 12, you’re actually only paying 8.33 for each month. So buying the full year is actually cheaper.
---
And people like you are responsible for things like break point star wars battlefront.    But funny how you think standing up to coporate greed some how translates to being a coward, might that projection from the guy to cowardly to not buy into corporate greed hmmm?
---
K. What's your gt? I'll send an invite.

---
I have been on all day since 430am til 8pm and did not have a single issue
---
This ^^^ love your mindset, wish everyone else had it. No one is better than the other just because they don't have the subscription, and same goes for those who do have it. We're not any better, we're just paying for a service that we enjoy. Nothing wrong with that. Others feel different and obviously that's okay, no one is asking that the trolls buy it as well. Just let us live and relax, keep playing the game the way you've been playing it. Super simple
---
No, I'm just pointing out how hypocritical it is to hate one shitty company more than a shittier one. Regard my opinions or don't. Just come up with better arguments.
---
We all know who the real “good guys” are 😏
---
That is incredibly hard to read. Not sure if it’s just me but I can just about count the pixels, got the link to those? The pic ain’t doing it. Or alternatively just say the ones your thinking of instead of showing us ToS
---
Dont lose hope
---
Oh hey look, a wild stupid ass bitch
---
Thank you for this. While I acknowledge there are some uncool practices being used by Bethesda, I don't think it is worth the utter meltdown a lot of people had in the past few days. It's definitely not pay to win. P2W implies I have some advantage when facing other players to beat the game. We don't need to beat other players to beat the game! So many posts of "I'm so bored Bethesda, after 500 hours, and you add *this* on top?!?!?! I'm so done with this trash game!" Obnoxious.
---
No, I'm sure it's a quality issue. It's not an issue of literacy it's more of a 'Holy fuck dude, how long does a post on Reddit need to be?' there is nothing about fallout 76 or any other game that requires that long of a speech. Are you saying you found that post to be enlightening or entertaining? Was there anything to be gained after the fifth or sixth paragraph? (I don't actually care, those questions are rhetorical)
---
Lol man you are expecting too much from these toxic folks. Most of them are so quick to remember the negatives and take it through life it's sad. It's bigger than Fallout for certain. Those of us having fun will still be here, still buying atoms and still doing the robot on people trying to shop out of our pockets instead of their own. You're absolutely right in your prediction though lol.
---
Not only do they add weight but you can't drop, scrap or trade them.
---
There are people who do may SBQ fights who are drowning in the damned things.
---
That's why I created r/AntiFO76, for the opposite viewpoint.
---
I personally like this game, I have a lot of fun with it, I bought a year subscription because of all the negative views that I saw on this sub.
---
Honestly, I pop in an out as a proud filthy casual. I'm not here to win, just absorb content in the Fallout Universe, which is a fictional space I like. I paid top dollar for the game in month 1 and don't regret it at all. But have not spent a cent since and have no intention to. If I miss out on something, well, meh. Basically I think this persistent online fallout experience suits some people and not others. I certainly play tons of other games. Everyone should. There's sooo many good games around.
---
1) Those atoms are still worthless considering how overpriced the atomshop is to begin with. Seriously, even with the atoms the subscription gets you, you still won't have enough to buy the color blue for power armor. 
---
2) You know how much that "unique" outfit costs in previous games? Oh yeah, NOTHING!
---
3) The servers aren't even private. Random people can still join and you're getting previously used servers, not one specifically meant for you like other games with private servers do.
---
4) The scrap box doesn't even work since it actually deletes your items. On top of that it shows how Bethesda is purposefully making the base game experience mechanically worse just to get people to buy the solution.
---
Careful with this mindset, lad. Those 76ers just might have some launch codes and an inside man with some very solid looking coordinates
---
My personal feeling is that this is the future of gaming, instead of buying a title u buy a subscription.
---
They'll add a subscription service for the vaults in the future. Wouldn't suprise me lol
---
!remindme 6 months
---
lmao get dunked on
---
I've been enjoying some of the comments/complaints in other threads saying how EAs Battlefield is a good alternative to 'predatory Bethesda'. EA? Seriously?
---
Property is theft you silly person.
---
Damn I remember halo reach best edition was 150. 300 is pretty fucking insane, they should give you extra atoms per month and fallout 1st for 3 years for getting that.
---
I tried to warn people with the unstoppable outfits 269 days ago but got downvoted into oblivion. : (
---
Also the New Vegas Ranger helmet protects against Airborne toxins without a PER penalty. Afaik it's the only one in the game without the trade off.
---
I don't know all the glitches. Just a few.  And me selling junk has nothing to do with it. I mainly use other markets as of now, but when I get a bunch I go here. 
---
And fine, call it bullshit. Just telling you what is possible. 
---
In my opinion the fallout 76 community does not like glitches or exploits. Just look at all the marketplaces banning anything dupe or glitch related.  You'll usually get a fair amount of hate for bringing it up. People usually report anything to Bethesda whenever something goes public or if you post it on here. I don't go around showing evidence of any of these things. The wall and flying one isn't widely known, but the camp through walls thing, out of map and mine dupe is pretty well known by now. Also lots of places where you can just walk through.
---
If you want, give me any location on the map, I can probably give you a screenshot of me going there. Or video. Depending. On top of anything, inside anything, under map or wherever. Although I'm too dumb to go to the dev room, so not there
---
Um sounds a bit confusing but alright
---
I know how spawns work I've been playing since beta I however have never seen so many entirely missing cap stashes bobble heads and magizines in that entire time not to mention 90% of the locations where plans should be have nothing there and that's out of a sample of maybe 50 locations for each type of item I mentioned between my gf and me over the last 3 days they are simply missing.

Its a fun game, but you are right about the depth of the worlds. Its less open world per say and more really big corridor style maps like borderlands 3. My thing is the fact that fo76 will continue to release micro transaction fueled content for awhile until they have actually have to fix the game. It seems that the rumors of faulty coding which pre vents any real overhaul of the game might actually be true. The game was very rushed and they keep finding more and more bugs in the code. The game works in the mindset that it is multi-player, but it doesn't execute it properly. Most large mmo games have had similar problem, until the studios release amazing patches to correct the problems. For example games like elder scrolls online and the dark brotherhood add-ons that patches a lot of the problems with it. Destiny one which added the taken king dlc, which fixed a lot of issues. Destiny two with the forsaken dlc. I truly hope the npc patch for Fo76 rejuvenates the game like the ones mentioned. If it doesn't live up to the hype they have built up to now, i feel that this game really will die. I love the game when it works, but it seems to work less and less everyday.

Sacks of fertilizer can be scraped for acid.
---
Lorewise dickhole
---
£1 a month would have been fine. For the price of fallout first you can get 100+ games on ps now and Xbox grame pass. There's just no reason for f76 to be £100 a year. The only way a season pass should creed been added was if the game went f2p.
---
Everything's broken anyway which makes it even more of a ripoff.
---
You can’t do that. Spoiled vegetables can make fertilizer, and some components have acid in them when scrapped.
---
Ah, so this is one of those "let me rile up the angry 76 hornet's nest by assuming things, posting it and wait for a dose of validation and upvotes"  type of shtick. Gotcha.
---
Apparently there's eight comments, and I can't see them. So if you've commented and I didn't respond to it, I can't see it. Think reddit is having issues cause lots of people were reporting the same issue on the m*rket
---
1. You literally admitted you didn't play The Outer Worlds by saying you won't use the EGS. And you never mentioned XBox for Windows Live, or consoles. So clearly you haven't played it. You identified EGS is the place you would have used. You know you haven't. This whole mealy nonsense about assuming you haven't is typical it's a predictable tactic. *I haven't played it but you don't know that for certain!* It's a standard strawman to avoid admitting you didn't play the game. You've read a few things online and think you know the game. You don't.
---
2. You said you don't play 76 in regards to your sentimentality . Now you've played 300 hours.
---
You're the kind of person who just says shit if sounds like you can win an argument. You've proven yourself disingenuous, at best.
---
Iv read almost everywhere that even raw fertelizer made from spoiled crops n meat can be turned intk acid
---
r/AntiFO76
---
1 month = $12.99
---
1 year = $99.99
---
Now, decide the year by 12, since there’s 12 months in a year. 99.99/12=8.33
---
So in the long run, you’re paying more for the year, yes. But if you’re looking at the cost per month, the monthly plan actually costs more. 
---
Just for reference, if you’re on the monthly plan and pay it every month for a full year, you’ll be spending $155.88.
---
They’re downvoting you when this very well could be true, like a mod for extra condition on your weapons, or increased damage in the raid or something.
---
It most likely has to do with Wastelanders.
---
If 76 has taught me anything its that game reviews are meaningless
---
Oh my god....why....
---
Things that should be in the base game and definitely not monetized:  
---
7: Log Cabin Walls. Those sound cool.
---
6: Clean Toilets. Why don’t we have those yet?
---
5: The Ability to name our vending camps.
---
1: Armor Mannequins to display our outfits.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
The rest sound more like luxuries that could be fine on a cash shop, but these have all been requested by players and are mundane enough to belong in the base game through an update.

Not only that, for the price of just $1 you get to rent it from Microsoft for a month (just sign up for the PC Gamepass and turn off auto renew) whereas here you spend $13 to get clothes and some half baked features.
---
The thing is I honestly dig the whole fallout 1st subscription. As an OG fallout fan and long time player of the franchise it gives us the ability to have not just whatever but however much of what we want. Just like in previous games. And as somebody who never cared about/participated in PvP (since the previous games never had it) this helps 76 feel more like its predecessors. All I ever wanted was a fallout game that I could play with my friends that also enjoy the franchise and this does exactly that. Now all the PvPers and story driven can play with their own kind. One of the reasons I also don’t consider it “pay to win” at least in my specific circumstance.
---
Those are f2p games and they give you 100x the content that isn't broken...
---
The entire problem is that it’s an Atoms subscription with bonus features, not a premium features subscription with bonus Atoms. It should be $5/month for everything plus 500 atoms and everyone would be just fine with it. 
---
It’s completely backwards, and while it may be worth it for the price of Atoms, it’s not worth it that it costs MORE than hulu, Netflix, Disney+, gamepass, Xbox live, PS+, slingtv, Spotify premium, amazon prime, twitch prime, HBO Go, Nintendo switch online, YouTube red, the list goes on. 
---
They’re saying that these few features and atoms are worth MORE than the THOUSANDS of hours of content these services provide, and anyone who doesn’t think that’s laughably hilarious can Venmo me $12/month and I’ll store your scrap on a mule account for you.
---
I’m just waiting for the inevitable back peddling of “wait guys, we forgot about Fallout 2nd! For only $5/month you get everything without the 1650 atoms!”
---
You’re not the only one :) I only got round to doing this quest today!
---
I find your lack of faith (in Lord Todd Howard) disturbing ;)
---
&gt; grue
---
Yes, but you'll need to pay another $15 to unlock it.
---
If those people who said they would leave did in fact leave. Then I assume this is exactly what you would see.
---
They fear what they know could very well be reality.
---
I'd rather not have to pay for either of it, but if they insist on charging extra for things beyond the game price, it should be something that's actually worth paying for at all. My point was that microtransactions suck and that these small but nice features aren't something you should have to pay more money for
---
I’m on Xbox sadly:(
---
A good argument everyone needs to read this.
---
Simply put a complex well made argument!
---
I know you're defending the game. But everything you've said just only defends people's right to shit all over the game.
---
* It's not acceptable for you to buy a game, and its so unfinished to the point 76 was at launch (if you were to buy a new car, and the engine didn't work properly, the car kept cutting out. Would that be ok?)
---
* Even 1 year after launch the game still has ghouls moving around in a lying down position. Last night I literally got blue screened 4 times while trying to play Nuclear Winter.
---
* Bethesda isn't your friend, they're a company. You're damn right they are. We bought a service from them, and they haven't adequately provided that service. So why are you all defending them like they're a friend.
---
* Content/DLC drops have become far between, sparse and lackluster to be replaced with more heavily focused content microtransactions. Even a  quick comparative study of the seasonal events over time shows their drop content. 
---
Fasnacht- Well thought out, fun event. With a wide variety of interesting brand new camp rewards, outfits and even recipes
---
Meat week- A mediocre event. A couple new outfits (some just being reskins), a couple recipes, a new weapon and a flag.
---
Mischief Night- don't know what the event will be like, but the rewards are literally just outfits in the game, with camp item rewards being assets ingame that originally came from fallout 4. The only new thing will a glow in the dark costume from NW, which will just be a reskin of the skeleton costume. Basically nothing new was created for this seasonal event.
---
* And yet there is enough time to develop, new skins/emotes/working camp objects to add to fallout 1st. There's always time to make things for the atomic shop, but not even add 1 thing new to the seasonal event. I mean it's Halloween. Throw people a Halloween photo frame and a new outfit or camp item for free in the atomic shop atleast.
---
* I don't care if a company underestimated/made mistakes with assessing profit margins. I bought a game that was lacking content, but was given a promise of improving. That's why I didn't immediately ask for a refund. And even spent money in the atomic shop along the way. If they choose to throw away those promises to the consumer in search of greed. Then they deserve every bit of hate directed at them
---
The problem is that there’s not a free option for hosting locally on your own system.
---
And the sass the DMV bots have cracks me up too
---
Yes sir
---
If you're screaming at your monitor, maybe you need to take your own advice. Also you need to find a better bar if you're on reddit. All I did was feed a dude his own logic. Settle down. I went overboard to prove a point.

Keep telling yourself that

Haha I can say whatever I want now, that’s right John it was I who stole your chips ahoy 4 pack from your lunchbox in 4th grade! Mwahahaha
---
Ash Heap and Toxic Valley maps can drop PA plans, I don't thing forest does though.
---
Made you realize which Bethesda games are good? 
---
Name one Bethesda Softworks developed game that at launch, released in such a polished state as the outer worlds.
---
Who do you normally pvp?
---
I don’t blame them for seceding with all the stuff going on in Appalachia and America at the time. Why do you think they are greedy?
---
💰 &lt;that is how it made it past QA.

I've played every game as they came out (minus Brotherhood of Steel). I like the general direction its been going. FO76's story and world is probably my favorite and the most desolate and bleak its been since Fallout 1. Fallout 4's world is great but the story sucked. Mechanically I like 4 better than 3 or NV. It doesnt make sense to compare them against 1,2, or Tactics since they're entirely different kinds of games.
---
All the content should be free like they said it was going to be at the start. They've already moved the goal posts. ES6 is gonna blow and so is starfield. I just know day one will have the creation club with the grind removed for extra money.
---
1) It isn't a broken mess
---
2) Its a side mode to GTAV
---
3) They never promised that it wasn't going to be p2w
---
4) GTAV still gets a lot of hate from people for being p2w, especially from people who hate how the success of GTAonline has destroyed the chances of singleplayer dlcs from being made
---
Reddit is a shitstorm. The game runs great for me on PC. I've experienced a few minor bugs here and there but nothing anywhere near 'game breaking'. It may have been shit at the beginning but I wasn't there for that. I can only attest to how the game has performed for me during the five months that I've been playing. To me all these complainers just sound like a bunch of cry babies but maybe there are more issues on the console versions than the PC version. I couldn't honestly say.
---
I see where your coming from. I kinda hope they never finish the game, if you know what i mean. I hope they keep rollin out updates and adding quests and locations. Ill keep playing until/if they start charging for dlc
---
God damn, you are so afraid of going against the mainstream view on this, that you just resort in insulting the other side to be accepted and not being looked at negatively.
---
Which was meant to be free to begin with... They are now charging you for stuff they said was free.... You guys are dumb.
---
What do you mean? Like throw out a visible invite to friends and randoms nearby?
---
I want to change my pip-boy ui colour so I can have a different colour than green lighting everything... I'd gladly pay atoms for it.
---
Oh and greenhouse tables like I had in F4, so I can have my crops neat and tidy in my dome greenhouse instead of... Outside.
---
Give me them dislikes! If you cant afford it.. move on or stop playing games to get a better job :0. This is the future of all games. None of you can stop it @________@ who's the biggest whale
---
Ah?
---
bash stuff with it..
---
Nerd rage and serendipity are fantastic perks for a bloodied build!
---
Go to the forest and bash stuff and take gunsmith off if you have it on, but the one place I always got one is the temple where “guided meditation” happens, it’s on the left side after fast traveling along the cliff
---
If it was $5 a month, or heck even $1 I would still have a problem because they are charging for QoL features you can’t get any other way. Like I said the worth or value isn’t the argument here (at least for me) because we can’t tell someone what they can or cant think is worth something, you can try all you want but there is no objective way to say it’s worth the value or not.
---
They also did that with far harbor, there are skeletons posing on some houses off the map.
---
Awesome, i’ll try that! Thank you!
---
I never said I played outer worlds. In fact I said I'd never play it because it looks boring and bland. And researching the game I've found it IS boring and bland.
---
And if you're honestly trying to say I'm lying about playing 76 you can look at my entire fucking post history LMFAO. I've played since fucking beta.
---
Give it a rest and stop crying over someone not cumming to a fucking video game you like.
---
Op I agree with you.  I'm not sure why but it is an industry trend to not use  ROYGBIV and instead sell brown variant 17 or grey dark 12 and when they sell "White" it's actually grey.
---
*take any workshop without fear of getting insta-ganked by griefers with really really Pay2Win duped  legacy glitched god roll Junkies Explosive Lasers and full duped set of god roll Sentinel Assasin armor.  There fixed it for you.
---
Yea but that kind of behavior isn't good. It drives away potential allies and causes issues long term. Because if anyone dies or gets hurt that is a blow to the number of people that can help find food or defend them.  Their only option is reproduction but it will take decades before the kids can grow old enough to help in any meaningful way.   
---
It is fine if you are in good conditions but not so much if you are in shitty conditions.
---
Lol idk what this other guy is talking about. Bethesda is the real thieves, forcing players to fork over money so that they can use the scrapbox, which should have been in the game at launch... smh
---
Edit: Maybe the atoms are a little sketchy, but I consider the ranger armor as fair compensation for Bethesda taking the ability to store infinite scrap from me :)
---
It’s almost as if this sub is filled with a bunch of children who can’t manage their funds for hobbies.
---
There may be haters but if I had to guess I'd say it's all a bunch of hype.
---
Using spoiled food makes raw fertilizer which is a base component.  Base components cannot be broken down into other components.
---
I think you are thinking of the BOS being not tolerant of anyone not like them. Free States are for individual freedom (do what you want as long as you don’t infringe on others individual human rights (N.A.P. Principle)) and against authoritarians, totalitarians, collectivism.
---
I think the ash heap drops excavator plans
---
no idea on 96s, can't wait if it gets the ice armor datamine one.  that said at least we have 94
---
MMOs have had the model for decades
---
A free single player world hosted on your own system instead of their servers.  The fallout 1st payed option should be more like Minecraft realms where it’s a server that you can whitelist people on and that they can play on any time (even if you are offline). In that case it’s generally way better for both people who don’t buy, and people who do. Everyone wins if they were this way.
---
Sorry if I was to late  but its bdonr18 I'm on now
---
Even you nerds who bought it can’t be cool to each other haha
---
People laughed at the "what if EA made Dark Souls" video but I just had a hard pit in my stomach that I was seeing the future standard.
---
Oh *please*! No one is setting anything on fire. *THIS IS THAT MIDDLE GROUND*. Setting things on fire would literally be setting things on fire. 
---
A reddit post about uninstalling is about as grassroots as it gets. Get some perspective, man. 
---
What they are doing is protest. You call it a temper tantrum because you disagree. No, what *you're* doing is throwing a tantrum. Over reddit posts. They paid good money for a product. These people are rightly upset at a company that has continued to double down on bad ideas, exploitation, and abuse.
---
Your biggest problem is someone was vocal about quitting a video game you like.
---
I like FO76 but it's not amazing, I hope watelanders is good and is a turn around for the game but even if it isn't I dont care. It's just 1 video game and it's a video game a company known for their singleplayer games took a risk on. I appreciate them taking risks and trying something new even though some think it's a failure I respect people who take risks and try new things. We are still going to get ES6 and as long as they dont fuck that up I'll be happy. People really need to chill, I'll admit at first I was thinking wtf when i read about the subscription service they're doing but then I thought about it and looked further into it and it really doesnt effect anything so I don't care. Also I'm just sick of everything being controversial and this recreational outrage culture that has to try and expose everything and be upset all the damn time.
---
I hate the stuff beyond the atoms and server being tied to the subscription but it's definitely not pay to win. It's pay for convenience sure, but you're not winning anything by having the tent or scrapbox.
---
I will hunt you down haha jk
---
It does. Anyone giving Bethesda money for this service is telling Bethesda to add more monetization features. Barely anyone liked the repair kits and refrigerators being monetized, but because a small portion of the playerbase bought a ton of them Bethesda has now openly said they'll add more p2w monetization to the game, starting with Fallout 1st.
---
If you buy Fallout 1st, you are telling Bethesda "Please make the game worse so you can lock off more fixes and features behind more and more expensive paywalls"
---
I think his point was that Epic Games owns the unreal engine.  If you are boycotting one, why not the other?
---
Im not really a lawsuit type of guy but any lawyers that happen to browse the sub wanna weight in on how a class action suit would work for false advertising in regards to fallout first? Generally curious if people who are upset by this have a case. Between the canvas bag, and telling fans all dlc would be free and only cosmetic things. I know its not how the world works but Bethesda should not be allowed to continually lie to its customers like this.
---
Absolutely, and a bunch of my favourites that I have bought end up on GP, so I end up not wanting to buy stuff ever now as if it bombs it will end up on GP and if its a good game it either starts off there or ends up there eventually.
---
Looks awsome! Iv never been good a decorating natural looking clutter into my camp, but it makes it look so much more lived in
---
I remember those same people defending the fridge and collectron, 
---
"You don't need to buy it"
---
"You can earn atoms for free"
---
"Bethesda's dick tastes good"
---
That's what you get for not be able to answer a direct question and dancing around the issue with some "supply and demand...blah blah...i'm an economics major" BS
---
I mean, yeah, if you’re going to buy into these egregious microtransactions, then this is definitely the more efficient way to screw yourself.
---
Kicking against the pricks might be hard, but it is also fun.
---
But one of the costumes was free, and as I remember it, it just required everyone to be wearing a costume, not everyone to be wearing a unique one.  I seem to recall most of our group wore the Mistress of Mysteries the whole event.
---
I think he's just joking about how the bar for whats acceptable will keep getting pushed.
---
Haven’t anyone yet! We have stumbled into the “DAB” raider clan on PS4 a few times but nothing organized
---
I hear this excuse all the time. The thing is, as the customer, that isn't my problem, and I have no interest in the excuses of why it's a mess.
---
This isn't a family/friend relationship, it's a business relationship. I'm here to conduct a business purchase and use the product I paid for, not to pay for a shoddy product and then give the business praise and a thumbs up for "trying". When a customer pays currency for no matter what kind of product, there's an expectation that said product is functional and usable. If it isn't, then the business has no business selling me said product to begin with.
---
Just bash your crossbow into enemies and then repair it. Easy peasy. The durability only has to drop a small amount to do this. Good luck!
---
Better be free cause nobodys gonna pay for a flamer skin lmfao
---
$$$$$$$
---
Private words are just going to get better and better. They will let you do a lot more with your camp, for starters.  Bethesda should release a unique outfit for fallout 1st members - a petticoat with top hat and monocle, just as a joke, and also a special emote where you flash a fallout first membership card.  People are taking this all way too seriously.
---
Ahh I see yeah that would be dope but I can see why they wouldn’t do it simply do to loss of potential buyers
---
Dude, where have you been. We've already been sliding down the slippery slope ever since they introduced repair kits. Now look where we are.
---
For me that would be, skyrim, oblivion, fallout 3, NV and 4, morrowind. I played all those game at launch without a single issue. The only game I had issues with out of that list is morrowind, around 200 hours in I got vampirism and the quest to cure it would not start. I know people love to hate on Bethesda and act like their games rarely ever work, but I must be very luck because I've only had one issue with 1 game ever.
---
Because this post is so much more interesting? or useful. or neccesary. /S
---
Considering ESO+ offers the same type of benefits and that game continues to thrive.
---
Definitely has its advantages, all of which I’m perfectly happy to pay for. Have to get ready for when Wastelanders is released.
---
Sorry - can’t agree with you.
---
Not because everything is fine, but because the problems you are referring to actually don’t significantly effect game play and game balance.  At best, they offer minor convenience.  Most players already resolved the junk and stash issues by various existing in-game means.  Even the legendaries are not a significant issue because of the daily 150 scrip limit.
---
There are serious problems with Bethesda and with the present situation.  From the comments I came across, LonePonderer and Innova Survivor offered some of the most objective views and solid arguments.   Suggest you look them up
---
Is 94 open? I thought all 3 were closed
---
Maybe, but it’s inherently more fair, and less of a spit in the face to loyal fans who just wanted to play on their own, on a game they most likely payed full price for already + potential atom shop items.
---
I love doing new play throughs. Pick a play style you haven’t done before. I’ve got an unarmed, a commando and a bloodied and a full health rifleman.
---
You shouldn't get any hate for it. There are those that for some weird reason would say that by buying this, you've doomed the universe to a fate worse than death. But you do you.
---
How long are you going to complain about it? There are thousands of other games to play yet you’re here circle jerking and writing paragraphs about why a game is bad. Move on with your life.
---
Very true
---
Go to wixon’s homestead near the lumber mill south of v76.  There is a shack. Fert bags spawn there.  Scrap them. Tada!!
---
Lmmfaooo,  by being a cunt to people who chose to support a game they like....lol
---
You're all the way fuckin retarded
---
Lmao. I don’t feel harmed by others paying. So dramatic.
---
Make sure to get a mix of bolstering and unyielding armor. Unyielding will give you more crits and higher perception so you’ll miss less, and more ap due to higher agility. Radicool is another good perk that won’t help your combat but the boost in strength is good for lugging stuff back to base.
---
its hilarious how this has become so political. Support your right to choose lmaoooooo
---
It’s the price of a large whopper meal at Burger King. It’s cheap lol
---
Set up a stealthy character that doesn't use power armor. Try to clear out locations without being noticed
---
&gt; I call it a temper tantrum because that's what it is. 
---
No, you call it that because you need something to diminish the criticism to make yourself feel better.
---
This sub is already defending Fallout 1st like crazy by saying "you can't make it Play To Win if there isn't anything to win hurr durr."
---
It's this mentality that gives Bethesda the ability to pull shit like this.
---
Oh okay, I’ll look out for some, Thanks!
---
I see nothing dumb with it. It was worth the 12$ to me so I got it. Simple as that.
---
Uninstall the game. Don’t buy Bethesda products in the future. It seems like an easy solution to me.
---
How do you know I've never played the game? And even if someone literally just found out about fallout 76 today how does that in any way make the post less valid? 
---
Your entire argument is just to point out that I'm right? That lots of people are buying this thing? Can you please quote me where I said exactly how you should spend your money? 
---
Honestly did you even read the post lol all you did here is demonstrate how right what I'm saying is.
---
If you think the game is to easy.. try playing a crit gunslinger. Moat fun build ive played
---
You're a joke. Also I didnt scream it and I'm on my phone not a laptop or something. Honest question, what do you expect to get out of putting this much effort into this neckbeard revolution of yours?
---
It’s optional. If you don’t want to pay, don’t. You still can enjoy the game same as before.
---
Personally they haven’t done anything to kill my interest. You pay to rent a server for you and your friends? So fucking what, plenty of other similar games like Rust and ARK have that
---
Why does it matter if someone else pays their own money on something? It doesn’t is the answer
---
It's easy; don't buy the membership. If you enjoy the game keep playing it. If not, play something else.
---
Would be fun to make it a large scale quest on each server. And after it’s set back up we have such and such time until it’s deactivated again. 
---
Could offer some cool server-wide bonuses. Maybe rare vendors and such.
---
Yet here you are arguing throwing out terms like white knight and fanning the flames...
---
Seems like we're all just getting dumber and we've lost the self awareness to even realize it.  I mean, even I'm replying to you.
---
"Why do you think we gave them private servers?"
---
-Bethesda
---
PTW, meaning any paid game feature that gives a player an advantage over another in terms of gameplay, I.e a stash box that gives unlimited junk space and a forwarding base on the map. If it’s not cosmetic and advantages a player, it’s pay to win.
---
Oh I know. I didn't write it expecting anyone who already doesn't understand to suddenly understand. I wrote it simply because I've seen a lot of people very confused about why people aren't happy and the issue with the sub so I wanted to put the information out there. What people do with it is out of my hands but having access to more information is never a bad thing.
---
They're not optional. If you want a better experenice you have to buy them. 
---
Annoyed that you're gun keeps breaking down? The solution: pay bethesda more money
---
Annoyed that you're food keeps spoiling quickly? The solution: Pay Bethesda more money
---
Annoyed that you don't have enough space to store all your scrap? The solution: Pay Bethesda more money.
---
Bethesda will keep annoying gameplay features annoying in order to encourage more people into paying them more money.
---
There are a couple of sites where you can simulate various character builds.  I'm currently leveling a new character selecting more generalized perks that have benefit most of the time with most weapons.
---
I have a 100+ level pistol character.  New one will definitely be a 'master of none'.😊
---
Not one visual bug, no UI bugs, no audio glitches and not a single hard crash. I find this very hard to believe 
---
Fallout 4 was riddled with them
---
I wish. They would never, just want as much as possible to pull out of their games now. That's why almost every online game Bethesda does has a sub service now.
---
10 is giving me civil war flashbacks to a Nyan cat gun I had in Garry's mod.
---
Me and a friend thought that might've been why.  Nope.  Just another broken portion of a half complete game sold at full price when it launched.
---
You know you're in a bad spot when BFV looks good in comparison
---
Eh, you kinda deserve it for encouraging that kind of behaviour from Bethesda
---
Have you ran bloodied before?  Just asking for armor, perks etc ect and if your looking for tips to be more tanky or just to increase damage output.
---
.....? Where did I say anything about my life excuse me? How would a video game ruin someones life outside of spending all their money on MTX maybe? 
---
I also don't care about the game or Bethesda either so thats all good there. Also the post wasn't a rant either? It's an informative post on why people aren't happy and the dangers of something like this being a success. 
---
I really don't understand people like you. Why bother writing out a comment on a post you didn't read and therefore don't understand or have even a basic idea as to the contents of? It's just a waste of time that frankly makes you look pretty foolish. 
---
If you want to actually read the post and come back to comment great I'll happily engage in discussion but otherwise this is just poorly done trolling.
---
Personally I would probably be willing to buy the sub if it didn’t have anything that technically gave an advantage (like the scrap box), and if they were more like a Minecraft realm. It would be super cool if it was like that, and probably what most people would rather have. It would also allow private servers to be customized more, and let people avoid some limits that public worlds have. (Same with console hosted worlds)
---
Pete Hines said everyone should have CPD Riot armor?  When?
---
I remember when they announced 76 at e3 I watched one of the q and a's (I can't remember which one sorry) and they mentioned that 76 originally started as a "what if?" Idea instead of an actaul idea, apparently someone tossed the idea of fallout 4 having multiplayer before 4 was released and after 4 came out they started messing around with having multiplayer in fallout 4 and they basically wanted to test the idea and see how it went, but somehow along those ideas it somehow turned into it's own game but it lacked any passion or drive the whole point of the game was a suggestion turned into a half ass idea and test so they can make a quirk buck using very little effort and now they are trying to turn it into money generater.

You have every right to enjoy and spend your money on whatever you like. The only thing I and a lot of people dislike about it is that you're supporting a disgusting business model. It shouldn't be acceptable to do what Bethesda does. But obviously you don't have any obligations to do anything about it. As mentioned I just think there's a lot of dirty shit going on among many gaming companies atm and the only way it's going to change is if people stop supporting it. This product is not worth nearly as much money as people can spend on it. In my opinion they're pretty much scamming their own customers. BUT if you enjoy it, that's all that matters in the end I guess.
---
It's not silly at all that people are upset though. Silly if you're literally mad about it maybe but not upset. People are upset because they want this shit to end but it wont as long as people support it.
---
If no one decied to buy FO76 and it would flop 10x harder than it already has I can swear to you that the next product Bethesda releases would be WAAAY higher quality because that's what the executives at the top of the pyramid would force them to do. Now they know that they can in many cases get away with this BS.
---
I pay $15 to be eaten?
---
Well, maybe, but not in a video game.  And don't tell my wife.
---
No i haven’t ran Bloodied before, but i did try it with with just Adrenal Reaction, so i’ll be looking out for more Bloodied weapons. 👍
---
I wouldn't mind that.  It was very typical of Vault-Tec to forcibly kick out it's best and brightest into the wasteland instead of making the Vault their hub and home base.
---
The best and brightest should totally be able to come back, force that vault door open, and run in with hazmat suits or PA and restart and restore the Vault systems so everyone can return and have a safe place to meet, connect, avoid falling nukes, and collaborate on making or rebuilding society.
---
If they did this, it would be suicide for the game. I don't care if people are paying for their own servers. I still don't get why people are so upset... lol they are a company they have to make money off people. Or else they will stop making content for their players.
---
I'm having a hard time feeling bad for whoever decided go encourage Bethesda in that anti consumer move, tbh.
---
Thank you
---
Useful link
---
Bash
---
I'd be happy to read opinions from actual players. It's so obvious to those of us who play.
---
They do that to have the round 100 number. A very common marketing thing.
---
I would absolutely consider "100% immunity to PvP" to be a pay-to-win aspect, since if one cannot or will not pay then even if they don't really like PvP they have no choice but to avoid workshops or deal with PvP. By paying for a subscription you've gained an advantage over someone who doesn't.
---
That kind of "different viewpoint" is destroying the video game industry right now.
---
Idk dude, it takes the right vantage point but you can see almost the entire map in some places.
---
Absolutely avoid Xcell addiction.  May as well run around while infected with a Grafton Monster's Blight.
---
You seriously think that Fallout 1st, is the "tip of the spear"? The gig was up for traditional gaming as soon as the first Facebook MTX game was successful. Mobile gaming has been frigging **horrible** for paywalls, and MTX's, for how many years now?
---
And, you're argument doesn't even *mention* the fact that Bethesda **already has a successful subscription service with ESO**. 
---
But I'll bet you haven't been in the ESO subs arguing how "they're responsible for ruining gaming"? 
---
So, no thanks, I will continue with my subscription.
---
Edit:punctiation
---
Not gonna lie I'd cheat on 76 with rust if it hit console but those other games aren't close.
---
Many a Mr. Handy's died when they passed by this camp.
---
(Nice camp!)
---
And if it was just for atoms and cosmetics, and not for things that effect gameplay, I wouldn't care.  The fact that they've started locking gameplay elements behind the paywall (like they have in ESO) makes me regret giving them any money to begin with.
---
Not disagreeing, but doesn't every company do just that? Does your bank /telecom/insurance company really care about you like they say? Is the food you eat as healthy as they suggest? Will your deodorant really make you more attractive to the opposite sex? Of course you're being treated like an idiot, we all are, because in general it works. Adverts and marketing exist to make us want to buy shit we don't need, companies lie about their products and their intent, constantly. Bethesda is no different, FO76 is their product, they don't give two fucks about us, they don't owe us anything, certainly not loyalty. They might care if we all suddenly uninstall the game and move on, but that's not going to happen just yet.
---
it's not even uncommon. look at paradox, they take out basic features and then sell them to you in one of the few hundred dlcs (yes that is an exaggeration, not by as much as you'd think though). bethesda could get away with it like everyone else if they had some semblance of a functioning game, the fanboys and shills would drown out all the (righteous) criticism like they do for most games, but not even they can hide this mess lmao
---
I guess. You paid $100 to get screwed, so why not?
---
Thing is, it's MMO pricing without all of the polish and stuff to do. That's before taking into account all of the other controversies and what have you this game has faced. And to top it off, you already had to buy in at full value if you played from the start, even mmo's include the first month or so for free.
---
Moar upvotes for you. I just had one of those shills use every single one of those arguments on me.
---
Will there ever be a Fallout 5. And will it be solo ever again?
---
The people who want to play fallout in this way aren’t the problem. Let’s say 90% disagree and vote with their wallet that doesn’t make the 10% who buy it evil.
---
Most importantly THEY DO NOT DESERVE TO BE BULLIED!!
---
Maybe totally OOTL but isn’t the majority of what you pay for with fallout first access to your own server? Ye it’s a bit steep for server hosting on a VM but it’s not extortionate.
---
Yeah avoid Radscorpion omelettes (takes away a random addiction), and Addictol removes them all.
---
I'm not sure if popping the chem you're addicted to undoes the addiction temporarily similarly to how radx suppresses mutations temporarily.
---
I think 90% of those who did defend it, no longer defend it.
---
All micro transactions should be completely removed and all future expansions be changed into the old model of being single one time optional purchases that add substantial new content to the game for those who want it. 
---
The full price of the Nuka World expansion for Fallout 4 is not even enough to get you two different non bundle paint jobs in 76, this shit is completely inexcusable in a full priced game and the pathetic excuse the devs gave about wanting to keep the community together with free DLC has been fundamentally proven to be a blatant lie with the fucking constant escalation of basic utility and QOL features being locked behind absurd individual micro transactions.
---
Bring back the Anti-Material Rifle and Explosive Bullets!
---
I need it 3:
---
&gt; These people promised all free DLC
---
And provided it.
---
Someone should test that... I guess I will
---
Idk, the reviews seemed pretty accurate to me.
---
I'd recommend doing exactly that.
---
I went and started an alt as my main character reached \~Lv. 315.  No regrets at all.  While you can always take whatever perks you want and morph your character accordingly, picking a rule like "This character is going to be a pistol specialist" and following it is a lot of fun.
---
Happens to me when I leave NW and go back into adventure.
---
The only thing I think that shouldn’t exist is the scrap box. Just seems unnecessary. Tent should be available to both. Neither are particularly gamebreakinig in my opinion but they do cross the line, I agree. It’s not bad enough for me to flip out though.
---
I got it for $15 AUD. I got good value I think. Finished playing it now though and won't pick it up again.
---
What was the Wastelanders decision that was so bad?
---
I upvoted this... only reason they wouldn’t is not having enough people to complain to and they would all agree with each other... that wouldn’t work since the get off on drama and attacking others who think differently... go figure...
---
Out of curiosity, what did support say?
---
Stop encouraging them to sell you anything. You paid $60.00 for a game that would've failed even at $10.00 as a steam greenlight title. They have more than enough money, and they owe you, not the other way around.
---
I wish this game would die off, but people seem intent on encourage Bethesda to continue this rotten behavior. Stop supporting a company blatantly ripping you off just because they've coated it in slimy sugar.
---
Want to spend money on something? I can write you a list of games and things to do IRL for far less than anything worthwhile in the atom shop.
---
What’s your proof/logical argument that 5.56 is not going to be valuable in the future. I cannot see that ever happening.
---
Of all things, I can't believe the dipshits timed this fiasco to coincide with the release of The Outer Worlds. lmao
---
My friend had this happen to him while we were doing a silo, he had to quit application and rejoin the server.
---
Blasted Easter eggs getting me all excited 😊
---
Exactly. Well said.
---
It's so dam annoying man every 30m about for me
---
?
---
Had us in the first half ngl
---
Saying mtx would be "Cosmetics only" wasn't a lie?...  
---
Bethesda does not get to define P2W in the same way as EA doesn't get to call loot boxes "surprise mechanics".
---
What about support character? Healing flamer, max charisma (Will come handy in wastelanders too)..
---
Monetized tho?
---
Another knee jerk apocalypse post. 
---
If you don’t support the decision to sub to this, then don’t fucking buy it. If you do, then go ahead and support it. 
---
You’re entitled to voice your opinion about what you do with your own money, but you don’t get to tell others what to do with theirs.
---
You should maybe learn to read.  As I've repeatedly said I haven't bought, and won't buy, fo1st.
---
Maybe you should also learn a little more about gaming if you are unable to recognise the phrase "It is pitch black. You are likely to be eaten by a grue".
---
Get unyielding armor asap powered or +agility also helps a lot for vats
---
All the usual stuff uninstall and reinstall, test a new character, wait for the new patch to see if that fixes it. Stuff like that. I have a feeling this is a bug no general fix is going to help, its specific to my character.
---
I finally got it to complete and disappear from my tasks menu.  I was so happy.  Then after the update, it’s back!  Booo
---
Okay i’ll look out for some, Thanks!
---
I don't know why being on a phone matters here. Oh, "monitor". I got it. Pedantic. That's great. Just imagine I said phone screen. there, all is well.
---
You said it "loud as fuck in a crowded bar". You're so moved by this conversation that you're yelling out loud. With people around? In a public place! Again, pedantic. Some hot piping semantics, fresh from the oven. You're at a bar, whining about Reddit posts about a video game. Fix your own damn self.
---
Honest answer, nothing. Maybe some upvotes. What do you get? What does anyone who posts here, ever, get? "Neckbeard revolution". Listen bud, if you have an argument, go ahead and make it. Otherwise you're just another neckbeard defending a company that's currently pissing on you.
---
Oh, and if you aren't prepared for a conversation, don't initiate one.
---
In your opinion. True pay2win is being able to buy gear that has better stats than what you can get in the game. That is the only thing that would make me mad. You're crying about something that has been common practice now for quite a few years. What's going on here is not pay-to-win
---
Not if you read those terminal entries
---
No problem happy to help
---
I've just seen a hundred of these posts, Hell, I even created a sub just for posts like these r/AntiFO76, just for rants like this where you can scream into the void about what a shitty company Bethesda is for implementing 1st. 
---
Your post was about as informative as the other 99 shitposts about 76 were. It was a rant. You're just jumping on the 76 is a broken game bandwagon, and shitposting because it's popular to do right now. You'll get upvotes for being "edgy" But you won't destroy Bethesda, you won't get people to quit playing because of you, and you won't make Todd Howard commit Seppuku over your post.
---
They also asked for video proof and I gave them that.
---
Okay, hear me out P2W is a loose term, a company says we see P2W as X they never do X but do other shady shit it does not make it P2W.   
---
And if they do not get to define P2W then we must go with the oldest original meaning of P2W which involves P2W mechanics in F2P games like maplestory.   
---
You only get to choose one the original meaning how how a company defines it. You personal opinion is not a fact if a company expressed its views on a subject and held to it...so far...
---
Wanna release all of this content behind a paywall? Okay, sure. But make sure before you do so, compensate the people (who originally came up with those ideas and put them in this here Reddit) from whom you ripped the idea off of. If you do that, then you can go ahead with your scandal here.
---
Also remove your gunsmith perk so it degrades faster.
---
I think you're on the right track. The past year has just been a paid access to the BETA and now the subscription is to the full game at release.
---
We should all be THANKING Bethesda for giving us the opportunity to help them iron out the bugs pre-release.
---
I refuse to do a Bloodied cause it's ridiculous. I tried a Junkies but the increase in damage didn't seem to offset the loss in SPECIAL Stats for basically a 24% increase in damage. I go with Furious or Executioners personally.
---
Wastelanders paid DLC next ;'D
---
Isn’t it a 50% increase in damage?
---
As others have recommended, just do the gun bash with your crossbow and it'll degrade quite rapidly. I know exactly what you mean, this part of the quest had me struggling for a while, too!
---
This is what the shills don't understand.
---
Hey sorry for some reason reddit will not show me comments of posts.  Adrenal and low health with rads is a good start.  For nerd rage to kick in you need to be below 20% health and it is really powerful.  I also run barbarian under strenght because it gives you added damage resistance maxing out at 20 strenght.  I also use blocker under strenght to avoid melee damage.  If your running sneak, escape artist is amazing to run with it.  It helps you to regain sneak if in danger.  For armor I usually run 5 unyielding since it really boosts your special stats helping out with algity, strenght, luck, etc.  If I need some extra tankyness I will also sub in some bolstering armor.  I would also max the pistol perks for max damage.  If you have an agility points after that the adrinline perks are really great for mobs.
---
Who cares what angry rando's in this sub think? Buy it, or don't, just do what makes you happy.
---
Eh a bit far fetched... but tbh while I was playing the story quests, that's what I was getting out of them. This feeling that something else was supposed to be there.
---
It is 50% for 5 addictions. Also idk why u refuse bloodied, I dont die with it, just equip %dmg mitigation perks.
---
Oh yes?
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/dnw7ey/i_dont_hate_whats_included_in_the_membership_i/
---
Cancelling sub.  Thanks for the news! (drip)
---
Try gathering up all your repair scrap either in your inventory or your stash (try both), so that the items are being removed from only one location.
---
I've heard this work on similar issues, but your problem is new to me.
---
Also make sure you don't have the gunsmith perk loaded. It decreades the rate at which the crossbow deteriorates. I had the same problem. I even tried building a low level one and the damn thing seemed invulnerable even after bashing a crap load of scorched to death with it. Once I started cruising around the divide I started getting them as drops from enemies but other than the one you get at the scout camp I don't remember seeing any just laying around to be picked up. Good luck
---
You already see it happening. 5.56 is backed by the fact that everyone uses a handmade. Handmades are no longer Best in Slot. BiS is now Fixers. Fixers do not take 5.56. 
---
Besides, nothing is stopping high level crafters from trading for an psuedo infinite amount of 5.56 materials now with the scrapbox. Alongside the fact that workshops can now be farmed privately it makes crafting much easier.
---
Also take into account the fact that it wasn't hard to get massive amounts of 5.56 before, which was already leading to inflation. Same issue with the value of the capperino
---
&gt; Think about what else you can get elsewhere for the same amount of money
---
A few cups of coffee?  Half of a trip to the movies?
---
Seems like you got to farm the SBQ alot!i never have to repair anything in a workbench.but damn thats one annoying bug for u man,hope u get it fixed soon.but seriously maybe start farming the SBQ in the meen time.goodluck(you get repair kits after u kill her as a reward)
---
I would respond to your reply but for some reason I can’t see it even though I got the notification that you replied and it shows the beginning of the comment
---
Which is completely beside the point since Fallout 76 isn't an MMO.
---
Get your own. Take the L and leave.
---
Nah, that's the total number of players left playing the game
---
Love how theres all these skins for weapons no one uses lol
---
Some companies have all the Luck
---
Damn. Sorry I missed your reply. I followed your advice with a couple stealth boys. Worked like a charm. Thanx!
---
This post has got me thinking that any I find from now on are going to go in my vendor cheap to help other tadpoles get their badge
---
Junkies because then you can run vanguard armor as well. Depends what you get addicted to though.
---
Had this happen this morning to me. Weird.
---
Are you sure you're not wanted?
---
&gt; Literally all of these would have been better than selling us things that should have been in the game at launch.
---
If Bethesda sold those things r/FO76 would be saying they should have been in the game since launch.
---
&gt; It should be $5/month for everything plus 500 atoms and everyone would be just fine with it.
---
&gt; 
---
No they wouldn't.  Everyone would be losing their minds exactly as much as they are right now.
---
You IMPLORE ME?
---
Speaking of music... I wish they could change the main menu music to be the new atom shop music. They did a great job on the Halloween music
---
If you bug support long enough, they will make a copy of your char from time the bug wasnt present, effectively duping your entire inventory. At least something to look forward to ;')
---
Nah im not, just happened out of nowhere
---
It wont be optional for long if this keeps up.
---
i would buy 3 and 2 even though i dont play much
---
My discord group lost half it's members in the last week, this weekend was the first time I've ever seen the server with less than 10 people online and every single remaining person is on a private world. The player base has been fractured
---
No, you'll just sit around defending it as if you had.
---
Yeah that one meme is the sole decider of someone's gaming experience. I remember playing Zork on my old man's Commodore 64. Been playing games since Atari 2600. But yeah I need more gaming experience because I don't immediately recognize a line from an old text adventure. I've probably been playing games longer than you've been alive. But it doesn't matter. Doesn't make my arguments any better.
---
This is gonna sound assholish, but I can't respectfully disagree. 
---
Anyone who financially supports the paying for private servers quite literally sends the message to Bethesda "yes! The customers want this!", which will lead to more of it. 
---
They're actively making things worse for the rest of us. I can't respect that.
---
What does Todd's boot taste like?
---
I'm not really sure either, yeah maybe the atoms is a bit much but I didn't want them too begin with. It was all just for the Ranger armor which looks like it's going to get "skins" for it by the looks of the way it can be modified. Great, just great Bethesda...
---
Yeah no worries. Let us know if you have any other questions.  Lol for bloodied it's trying to make your guy or gal do as much damage as possible with the most damage buff perks you can find at health below 20% haha.  For really big battles I will usually heal to about 50% and use nerd rage as my safety net.  Nukesndragons is a great site to work on your build.
---
How does it feel being a boring and generic person who regurgitates low effort rebuttals with no substance?
---
Because America’s America, we don’t cut and run and we don’t split up. We’re a team. A house divided can’t stand like Lincoln said.
---
Mine was doing well up until recently.  I had one disconnect yesterday and another one today.  Played a total of about 7 hours over two days, private and normal adventure.
---
Edit:  on PC NA
---
I compared my Junkies explosive 50cal to my Furious 50cal after getting addicted to 5 things. I did the math it was only a 24% increase in damage.
---
Oh? What are all those expensive MTX for and the whole store then...?
---
Take of weapon artisian damage the crossbow just a little then repair. Bashing seems to do the most damage.
---
I love camps like this! Great job.
---
Unequip all your cool perk cars before making and using them -- no weapons artisan, no gunsmith.
---
I've been telling myself "just wait, the game will get better" for months, that's the only thing that's kept me playing, grinding gear for good future updates, but that all seems to far away, and I really don't know if Wastelanders will ever make it. Normally once i take a break from a game, nothing can bring me back, and it takes problem upon problem or no updatesfor that to occur, and I have a very big tolerance for things I'm passionate about
---
And even if it was I can get 50% after enough hits without the decrease in SPECIAL stats with my Furious.
---
But MMO's are a totally different beast.
---
The reality is: Everyone can afford the subscription but I'd be a fool for giving money (after all the crap that happened) to a company that can't apply simple patches without breaking something. The game is a joke in every aspect. You get some of the best games out there for that price. On top of that, we already bought the game for 30+ bucks. They knew it wasn't ready for shipping, they knew that they are incompetent at delivering a live service but they did it anyway and now they try to sell this fo1st bullshit. Paywalling mods was the key goal here. They are well aware of what keeps their games alive. Fortunately tho, Fo76 wont bring in any significant amount of money. They have to try a little harder than that.
---
Thank you, i need to sort out my perks and invest in the best ones. I’ll look at all of those perks you listed, Thanks again!
---
Sweet that is super helpful! Thanks!
---
Omg you did what Bethesda couldn’t do in weeks of waiting. When I put all my scrap into my stash same problem but when I took all my scrap and put it in my inventory it let me repair. Thank you so much. I hope this long term fixes the issue because I obviously can’t keep my entire stash worth of junk on me at all times. Also so far so good I put all my junk back in my stash and it let me repair.
---
I want to buy this game just to join in
---
Damn they killed him
---
So the sub in this game being a somewhat success means it wont whatsoever be put into other games then? You won't have to pay a sub to access features in the next TES game then? Source?
---
Okay i’ll check out the perks and keep an eye out for the armour, Thank you!
---
How is it ruining the game?
---
Lol
---
There’s one by the palace of the winding path guaranteed.
---
Your camp looks great! 
---
And thank you for posting a real post!
---
This is fucking absurd, how in gods name do you bug out the login screen?
---
No argument. Just calls the person a shill or fanboy?
---
Spoken like a true r/gaming member!
---
Get Hard Bargain Rank 3. Gather Mothman Eggs from Point Pleasant (by the statue and down by the amphitheater). Cook Mothman Egg Omelettes, sell them to the robot vendors. 
---
Any cooked meats sell better than raw meats. (Woodchucker Perk is great for gathering wood to cook with...sometimes you can get 16 wood from one log.)
---
If you can save up enough caps, by serums from player vendors who are selling them for 250 caps or less. Each one (with Hard Bargain 3) will sell to the robot vendors for around 450-480 caps!
---
These are just a few ways I was able to build up my caps.
---
.....? ESO is a fully fledged MMORPG what? Why would a sub ruin an MMORPG? MMO's are best with a sub model because that's what they're designed around hello? 
---
And thanks for demonstrating my point. "Well other games have lots of MTX and bad monetization so why bother fighting this? Better to just lie down and be fucked in the ass" 
---
Thanks for being the kind of person who wants to see us paying just to move past the title screen or to accept a quest.
---
I did as you said and when I took all the junk out of my stash and tried to repair it worked and when I put it back it also still worked. Thank you. You did what Bethesda support could not. As of right now my problem has been resolved.
---
Yup, and the Convienence argument always made me laugh because paid game mechanics that are ease of life and help convienence are literally the definition on Google of p2w.. :p
---
But isn't this post intentionally misleading? Not sure how this is helpful.
---
It’s honestly a fine game, not the best fallout by far, but everyone saying it’s shit are just sensationalists. Have fun, take your time, and form your own opinion.
---
Im running this https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=1d283ef&amp;d=sb0p00pd2pk2pp2pl2eh1c72cm2cu0ir2an2a12a04a32la2l71l12li0lt2lu2&amp;w=&amp;m=51c29fe8d6i&amp;nw=&amp;n=
---
Nope. The points he made are 100% accurate and the people supporting this shit are THE problem.
---
Do you have more than one weapon that is identical to another? (Same name, same mods, etc)?
---
Btw share video here.
---
Make sure to grab the perk card that increases sell price, and take grape mentats before selling.
---
I know you can get a good amount from selling bulk scrap items, and when you've been playing a while you tend to get far more of some materials then you will likely ever need.
---
Can you please quote where in the post I said "This is what you should do with your money" please? 
---
And sorry but when the success of this sub dictates the future of other games it's not so simple a solution as "don't buy it" because there's usually idiots who still do and ruin it for everyone.
---
Yep, that's what I've started to use. P4A
---
Not if you actually no the definition of p2w no...no there isn't. lol
---
I mean, that's just a bullshit arbitrary value that Bethesda has put on a premium microtransaction currency in their already full-priced Games as a Service dumpster fire.  The only value it has is the fake value they put on it.  It's why I straight up don't do microtransactions anymore.  In the wee beginnings of mobile games they were kind of sensible if you wanted to play the Gacha but now most of them are like "Pay 15 bucks, be able to roll the Gacha machine once!" and that's just...awful.
---
Go west tek pick up assault rifles so much better and travel to whites spring train station 8 caps easiers way to make caps imo
---
I’ve joined friends twice today and it showed world full...
---
I can feel your anger. It makes you stronger, gives you focus.
---
In my experience, the idea of Escape Artist is that you basically squat in order to activate a Stealth Boy-like invisibility for a couple seconds.  It doesn't consistently revert you back to Caution, but it often does.  Probably if Danger was on the decrease in the first place.
---
Supposedly it also makes you harder to detect when you are "running" - which is your normal movement speed, not sprinting.  I don't notice much of a difference with this aspect.
---
Ofc, u will have different weapon perks, but notice the dmg mitigation perks.
---
Ding!
---
I like junkies personally. I need to actually take a better look at specific addiction penalties.
---
You guys gone let OP talk to you like that ? Show him, do it now !
---
&gt; People post to get Karma and those who get the most are featured on drama youtube videos and are treated as primary sources 
---
I had absolutely no idea this was the case and would explain some of what I see on Reddit, thanks for the info!  👍
---
You don't think we need a few more Tolstoys "hot take" screed about how the sky is falling?
---
Mines fine, but I don’t have much in it.
---
I would definatly be offended about that ball pit being in there
---
Unfortunately that's not a reality some people are capable of understanding 😔
---
I’m doing the same thing. I want my newest character to be a long-range one. Snipers, maybe a rocket launcher or fatman. Have one or two melees and maybe a boomstick just in case.
---
That helps a lot, Thank you. I definitely need Nerd Rage, that perk is insane. Thanks again!
---
What you mean lol?
---
You can happily play the game and ignore other players.  Ensure you turn on Pacifist mode.
---
Ya there is a timer (20hr I think) and containers can be forced by picking up enough items. I’ve only logged on once since signing up but it was great. I never would’ve known there were that many fans and typewriters just lying around. Screws for days!
---
You can write a snarky reply to them letting them know.  But there's probably an underlying issue that they need to look at, like what combination of items in which location are messing up the repairs, so snarky might not be the best approach ;-)
---
Hey, you can get back to "debating the merits" any time. You're making the choice to wade into the mess. Don't blame anyone else.
---
You are correct, I meant to say I farm the First Aid boxes for disease cures and craft antibiotics from them. I seem to get disease cure every time I search a box with Pharma Farma 3.
---
&gt; No, you'll just sit around defending it as if you had
---
I'm not defending it as If I have bought it, I'm defending it because all the arguments against it are shit.
---
I said gaming* not the game. The game can't get much worse itself. 
---
You supporting this and purchasing it sets a precedent that other games and companies can do the same thing and get away with it. Enjoy paying a sub fee to access features in the next TES game 👍🏻
---
Im sure they were going to open them earlier, until the decision was made to put NPCs in. And since that’s getting pushed back 3-5 months to perfect it, I think it’ll be even longer for the vaults.
---
Lol they’ve stopped responding to me it’s been almost a week now. Note I have been nothing but polite to them snark levels at a minimum.
---
My last character I did in survival mode. I didn’t really PVP, it was more for the restrictions of not fast traveling. If you have self control you can do this to yourself.  I also spent more time actually reading through terminals and piecing together lore in some of the random towns you go through.  I also tried to do all the quests in order so that each faction leads you to the next. I messed up though at the end and stumbled across abandoned waste dump before I was done with BOS. So close!
---
I also started a character explicitly for nuclear winter which is fun once in awhile. Not nearly as much of a time sink though.
---
It’s pretty good. Bethesda made a lot of changes to make it easier on newer players. You will want to take over workshops and kill the waves of enemies that try to take over. That’s the only way you will be able to level up fast enough to keep up with the main quest.
---
This is actually a really good idea.
---
Just wait till we get streaming services. No need for considering hardware incompatibilities nor consumer rights over a finite product. The golden era of the AAA gaming industry is yet to come.
---
You, sir, are a gentleman *and* a scholar.
---
You just need to shoot a few enemies and then you can repair.
---
Yall are dumb as shit just dont play the fucking game if you dont like it
---
Definitely a solid $40 AA game. Not GOTY but nowhere near bad either. Also a great deal for gamepass.
---
Such as...?
---
The people who dislike this quest clearly have never been to the DMV!
---
There isn't at all another game that is like Fallout 76. Fallout 76 is an RPG and none of those titles you mentioned are, Fallout 76 has a significantly better world to explore with quests and a story to follow. 
---
No Mans Sky is the only one of those with a story and sidequests but those are just padding and poorly written.
---
Most people start with a melee build so you dont have to worry about ammo as much. Maybe you can find a mutation cheap for herbivore so you can eat any plants around the map without getting sick. Once you get to level 25 get your excavator power armor. That should get you on the right path
---
Thanks very much for that, you make me feel better about what I am noticing, getting ready to pull the trigger and move perk point from agility to intelligence, trying to balance my build. Escape Artist is the only single point card I think I shan't mind losing.
---
Yes, distant Thunder does drop T-51 plans.  It's a 5% chance for a limb, torso, or helmet plan. Same chance for T-60. 
---
And yes, they can drop from treasure maps in The Mire, Savage Divide, Ash Heap, and Cranberry Bog, and also ***level 3*** locked toolboxes in the same regions.  The drop chance is much lower in both of these sources (roughly **0.5% or 1 in 200**).  [Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/cat3lc/new_map_of_treasure_mounds_made_with_mappalachia/) is a map of treasure mounds, and [Here](https://map76.com/cont/toolbox) is a map of all toolboxes, if you really want to go that route.  Unfortunately, the toolboxes aren't sorted by lock level on the map.
---
Finally, the minimum player level for T51 plans to drop is 30.
---

---
Vault 79 that will probably be part of Wastelanders DLC.
---
It's a good game.  Not great, yet anyway, but it's certainly Fallout.
---
There are issues people here are having with the way the devs are treating the game, but that doesn't have a lot to do with your ability to enjoy it (not yet anyway, and I doubt that will change much).  But if you like 'survival' games that aren't terribly hard to survive in, you'll get plenty of enjoyment out of it.
---
Take your time, enjoy the world, and I have a feeling you'll stick around for quite a while.
---
Who cares. Destiny is most definitely locked behind a pay wall because they make you buy a new DLC every couple of months for 30 bucks. This is called a gaming service. If people want to pay for it they can and if they don't they don't have to. The most annoying this is the amount of trolls who pretend everyone agrees with them when it's obvious thats not true. It's simple if you don't want it then dont pay but don't pretend like those who do are contributing to a decline in gaming.
---
I am looking forward to Wastelanders.
---
Also I would happily pay for a DLC add on as i did with Fallout 4.
---
But I wouldn't pay for ATOMIC Shop stuff.I have Zero interest.
---
This is why i wont criticize those that have bought Fallout First.
---
It dosent appeal to me,but it does to others.
---
Gamers of all ages are just going to have to accept that times are changing.That all the Games developers are going down the route of in game micro-transactions.
---
I find it laughable that some heavy criticism is coming from people who have 200+ levels in the Game.
---
Perspective ,The new game The Outer Worlds has a 40 Hour playabillity and is retailling at £45-£50.
---
40 Hours.
---
Some have been playing 76 Solid since release.
---
My main is a PVE stealth rifle sniper, and I also leveled a melee recently.   Now I’m doing a “pistol Pete” alt.  I can’t decide which I like better, but I can confirm that pistols are not BIS, lol.  Good thing I’m mainly into solo PVE not anything endgame.
---
Why would you subscribe to a 1 player version then play it online?
---
People defending bethesda at this point have no real grasp on thinking outside their own little bubble. Bethesda in the last few years have been grossly predatory, blades proved this fo76 proves this, and ES6 will prove this.
---
There are 3.  Poseidon.   Monongag ( no clue how to spell it), and thunder mountain.
---
I get something similar mostly when looking down a hill into trees, the game seems to redraw the models as I scan left to right, up and down, thought it was my potato system.
---
according to the dataminers, what escape artist does is give you a stealth field of 99 (out of 100) for 1 second. it's the same as stealth boys or the chameleon mutation.
---
problem is that stealth fields by themselves aren't all that useful, specially mid combat. they simply camouflage you, so it's like there's nothing where you're standing. enemies won't be particularly drawn to that spot any more than they would to any other random coordinate.
---
if they're already locked onto you though, or if hey bump into you, it's pretty much useless. things like the sneak perk, legendary mod and raw agility *do* matter. they're the things that are gonna make or break your escape.
---
while it is usable with low agility, it's much less effective.
---
Tbh it's awful. Save your time. I and others will be real with you. The only ones about to disagree are those on the other side of what I'm about to say. The community is fragmented right now with those who want to encourage bethesda to make bad choices and support shilling your money to give you in game advantages and convinces. Those people are going to argue and say the game is fine.
---
The game is a broken mess, have had the first actual patch in around 4 months now. We take one step forward, I back. Bugs haven't been fixed since beta, the few that have been fixed, but also introduced numerous other bugs. Game still crashes everyday. Prices still outrageous. More glitches, bugs, and exploit remain unpatched, but damn are they quick to rush out fixes for their pay to win crowd.
---
Save your breath, buy xbox game pass. Buy borderlands 3. A game just released the other day that's being reviewed really high, go buy that. 
---
Anyone who says this game is fine is lying and you genuinely shouldn't trust them. How is broken fine?
---
Whatever. Game is awful but addictive. 
---
Save your damn self dude. Don't even bother.
---
Hahaha. Oh for fucks sake Bethesda.
---
Finally, a reason to re install fo76
---
/u/ladydevann /u/valseek - if you could get word to the support people about this issue/solution, that'd be great.
---
Should be a hate post tbh
---
Apologists like you are helping greedy devs kill gaming. Fucking pathetic.

***Logical***

10, 8, 5 is resonable.
---
&gt; What SUCCESSFUL online game do you know that doesn’t have one of these a) a form of micro transaction
---
 * How many of them are as broken as 76?
---
 * How many of them lied about what kind of microtransactions to expect?
---
 * How many of them sold preexisting assets from previous games as extra?
---
 * How many are as barren as this one is in terms on content?
---
Context is key here. You're expected to pay up to $20 for blue paint. Or what, 7-10 dollars for a single weapon skin? $18 for a costume that was long since paid for by Fallout 4 sales.
---
Honestly getting caps is only slow until you get your hands on a few decent 3 star weapons. People overpay for legendaries if they are good. If they aren’t good, a 3 star is still with 800-1000 caps which can go a long way. As you accumulate your wealth.
---
Mark my words, now that some people bought 1st, atom shop will undergo a new entirety of p2w utility.
---
This also gives the defending player a chance to surrender the workshop and thus Make PVP Consensual Again.
---
Yes it's 50% increase in damage
---
Fun fact: Scorchbeasts have a whopping 30% chance to be legendary.  5% for 2-star, and 1% for 3-star.
---
There is no slap damage anymore
---
FYI
---
I too hear it randomly and have to restart my game. No idea what triggers it. If anyone knows what this is all about, I look forward to your reply.
---
I just bought this freaking game, too.
---
Thankfully I was starting to do melee with str points for carry purposes. And did see that melee is a strong build in beginning. I just recently got a decent 10mm that I’m keeping as my only gun atm. And I just set up my seller thing for all the other ammo. 
---
Good word about the herbivore card. I’ll keep an eye out. That would be under endurance right?
---
Well, how is it not the same? You can fly coach or pay more and fly first class. Same principle, offers extra services, more comfort/better experience. All for those that pay more. So would you be mad at airlines, hotels, restaurants, clubs with VIPs  ect. For offering more to higher paying customers? Or mad at consumers for using them?
---
Yep that’s where I see it mostly, really noticeable around the swamp areas to the East when heading down hill as you described.
---
Don’t recall seeing this when I played months ago.
---
lol, someone gave this garbage post gold? No wonder you goobers can’t afford the subscription. Ha!
---
If they were logical, this would render all the complaints about the scrap box totally moot.
---
You don't have a point. Monetization isn't going anywhere, regardless of how hard everyone kicks and screams.
---
If 76 is the sacrificial lamb, so ES6 can be unmonetized, then so be it. Blood for the blood ~~god~~ vulture capitalists.
---
Get the Marine Tactical Helmet plan. Spam with Super Duper and sell to robo vendors with Hard Bargain. 
---
Add Grape Mentats for maximum effectiveness.
---
It's encouraging Bethesda to keep charging money for gameplay improvements that they, remember, promised would be free.
---
Buying Fallout 1st is a direct endorsement of this anti consumer mindset.
---
The pharma-farma (luck) perk is a decent source of side income and it will keep you loaded on stimpacks and rad meds. Just don't forget to push space to search the medical &amp; chem boxes &amp; medicine cabinets after you've already emptied them out. My dumbass didn't realize you had to do that and didn't notice the option when you're looking in the boxes for almost a whole month of playing I thought it was something that would just occur automatically once I had the perk loaded when I was new. The same goes for the scrounger perk when it comes to ammunition. The Green thumb perk pays off to when it comes to food. Harvesting two of everything adds up quick. Especially when it comes to the corn, tato, mutfruit crops (adhesive ingredients). I don't remember what level the perk is offered but cannibalism also provides a pretty steady source of food
---
LOL level 274, and no this isn't fucking lore it's skin deep holotapes. Fallout 4 has more fucking lore in ten minutes than this game does in an hour especially when most of the lore is involved with retconning, and making up lore on the fucking spot like even 4 did with the Nuka quantum power armor in the display case at Nuka world which made no fucking sense time wise because of the pa type of armor that it fucking was. That error in 4 is multiplied in spades in 76 you fucking shill. 
---
I love the entire fallout fucking franchise and as much as I was addicted to this shitty fucking game I'm not fucking g stupid enough to say it's full of fucking lore.
---
What fucking lore? Holotapes and skeletons that I guarantee you won't be continued into the next fallout game because it's not actually fucking lore.
---
The fact they added a subscription, that isnt even required to play the game, made you get rid of it, even though you enjoy it? Sounds kinda band wagony to me:/
---
Your lack of self awareness is astounding. Just astounding. I mean damn. You are the *last* person to talk about shit arguments. Your arguments boil down to 'it's not pay to win, because you aren't getting gun stats'.
---
You're arguing just to argue. You're simply a contrarian. You're not even good at it. For being "shitty arguments", you aren't very good at topping them. One would think you'd have this on lock by now.
---
When you bring up unstoppables you are stretching. I know you are trying to say they started out small but it was a dumb little promo thing. Nobody was honestly buying them for a short boost to HP. Nobody.
---
No. Human NPCs were never planned and the inclusion of them is what caused Bethesda to expand their monetization.
---
They expected 76 to sell significantly better and the cosmetic atom shop to generate more revenue.
---
Open your favorites wheel, and then on the bottom menu it should say what button to press. For PC, it’s T.
---
Quick, name all of the 9 holds of Skyrim. No, not the names of the cities, but what the actual holds are called, i.e. Haafingar. 
---
Go!
---
Good place to find a crossbow?
---
Only Fallout 1st players get unlimited scrap stash that you can't get without paying.
---
Thank you!
---
Well we know Bethesda loves selling us our ideas so what if we could get these 4-5 legendaries bundled at a .01% drop rate inside a loot box for the low low price of 1800 atoms, just enough that it makes you want to purchase atoms on top of the subscription!
---
No
---
I mean I havent touched the game in a long while but I assume it's broken like the rest of the subscription
---
Pay to win what? 
---
Fallout 1st is absolutely predatory and Bethesda are dicks for charging for mechanics that should have been in the base game, but you're not actually winning anything by purchasing a subscription. You're just making a shitty game slightly less shitty.
---
Now if they were to start charging money for weapons, armor or scrip, that would be pay to win.
---
Ohhhhhhh *well done bethesda*- bad timing amigo
---
I uninstalled it today. I was barely playing and really waiting for npcs. When I heard they were delayed again I noped out and bought The Outer Worlds.
---
Middle Mountain Cabins, inside the middle or West cabin, leaning against the wall
---
I think firstly we badly need more in game content for the current Map.
---
I think the Fallout 76 virtual World is very impressive.It was an ambitious undertaking.I dont care what anyone else says,it is a visionary masterpiece.I still even now find it breathtaking.
---
I think so much time and effort was put in to this World that other areas of the game were neglected.
---
My hope is the 76 World can still evolve in to something really special.
---
My fucking god. This is the problem. And people are just so accepting of this. So sad.
---
&gt;So why do you still attack people for their preferences?
---
Do you know what I want? To be on the same playing field as everyone else, whether I own this subscription or not. In fact, if they moved the armor to the Atom Shop, the scrap box to the base game, and the tent to a quest with some skins for it in the Atom Shop, I'd gladly get the subscription. Don't really have any use for a private server, but would be more than happy with the monthly atoms. 
---
Yet according to quite a few on this subreddit, not only is that playstyle "wrong," but those of us who  want less in the subscription before we buy it get called "greedy" and "selfish" for wanting to be on the same playing field as everyone else, regardless of their own subscription status.
---
I wouldn't want to stay bored if I were you, so ignore them. It's not hard.
---
I’ll keep an eye out for those also. Thanks! 
---
And I think I have one of those “search” cards. And I haven’t been searching... lol I’ll have to take a look at that
---
Psst, gaming companies have been doing this for years, sto has been ftp for years and still offers a subscription that basically does nothing people still buy it and no one is accusing them of "ruining" the game
---
People like like you are the same ones that claimed dlc would ruin games
---
It is 50% with 5 addictions
---
I think they mean it's simply one of the first red flags. For me, it was the laughable B.E.T.A. test.
---
Again, so because you think something isnt going to happen we should all just lay down and be walked on and let things get worse? Thats your answer? Lmao 
---
I'll happily give up fo76 so TES6 can be unmonetized though yeah.
---
Fallout 1st is Bethesda's new 100$/year premium membership. It's generally been seen like an anti consumer move by the gaming community, but a lot of people still bought it. So, disgruntled customers are taking to vigilantism to express their frustration.
---
Lol ok
---
A buddy and I rolled new characters to start from scratch as the only humans left in Appalachia.  It’s been a blast.  I opted for a shotgun toting granny named Berry Berkman, the granddaughter of a famous actor with a sordid past, and my buddy is trying out pistols.
---
We’ve both been shocked at the amount of stuff that’s present at every location we stumble across. I’ve been playing nearly every day since BETA, at least an hour a night, and this is the first time I’ve ever seen the lead weights at the motel north of Flatwoods and inside Charleston FD.
---
I also got the responder fireman outfit, the hyper rare one, so that was a nice little bonus.  The quad pump action from Leader of the Pack didn’t hurt either.
---
Subscriptions aren't necessarily the problem. Idiotic consumers who set the bar for amount of money wasted on features in an already overpriced and sub par game are the problem. Keep your subscription, I bet the people in Marketing over at Bethesda love players like you.
---
That is really cool.
---
Now you just need 100 Cats to compliment it.
---
They have already stated that the kills/challenges wont count for a toon created before patch 10 or 11, however after that patch any toon created will be able to finish up those kills/challenges. I've been able to get them all done finally since making my raider toon. If its still not working for you make a newbie, get free atoms.
---
That "dirt cheap" subscription could feed me for awhile, not all of us have money you know.
---
Yo, have you guys seen how amazing The Outer Worlds is tho? It's got classic Obsidian comedy and actually feels like a full game for once.
---
That's lucky for you. I tried to approach some low-level players. I'm level 51 when I quit and gained 4 levels since Friday until yesterday. I have some purified waters and diluted stims to spare for them if every they agreed but they never responded, language barrier is really an issue here in South-East Asia.
---
Yeah they are, 76 got slated at first which made me hesitate but I decided to try my luck and I don't regret getting the game me and a group of PKOA members got together for a Halloween event and we all talked about how it should've been majority have paid for the month just to either test it or get the outfit I did the same and I 100% support the idea that the Scrap Box and tent should've been free for everyone I've only paid for the month and that's it I just wanted that damn armour and live all my junk to the box (I went from 781 to 383 lol)
---
You can get one at the palace of the winding path, on  the northern part of the location there's a crossbow on a table. I just did this over 3 worlds as I had the same problem as you. I didnt know that bashing would wear it down quicker.
---
Agreed - any monthly subscription is a hard line veto. I'll pay up front, but I draw the line at anything subscription based.
---
It was fixed.  
---

---
Lmao hardly. We got what, 2 short, 20 minute long quests and a battle royale?
---
No they had to be unique. Only one person benefited from the Mistress outfit. That's why people were upset. It was just one more thing they did, to turn a cool event into a cash grab.
---
Haha “Wastelander”
---
Weeeellllllllllllllllll
---
I've been playing The Outer Worlds and it's frikkin incredible. It just so good! Best RPG I've played in around a decade.
---
Another great answer, I like having 14 agility but want to move one point to intelligence. I run with Sneak 3 always and find this pretty good and I have been suspecting that Escape Artist was no worth it for me.
---
99 (out of 100) for 1 second O.o how odd that such a thing could really make any difference, I have marsupial so often jump away if cornered. I'm going to lose this card, but I may move points from strength to take agility to 15 I am a predominant sneak sniper now as melee seems to randomly lag, but with sneak close quarters melee I'm loath to loose Strength points, have some nice melee weapons. also I'm a bloodied build so need max strength so as not to die, need to hit hard.
---
Ho hum. Gets to be a real juggle at this stage fine tuning.
---
Agreed. Its also nice because it would give you time to switch your cards back (like taking scrapper or super duper off) if you did wnat to defend it. The way the system is now is super greify.
---
I just started diving into shotguns with some intention. I’m early into the new build, but it doesn’t start strong. Perk-wise, it’s a whole lot of nothing until you hit lvl 10, then there’s a whole mess of good ones all at once.  Low level shotguns have the durability of a teenage dream. Luckily they cost almost nothing to repair.
---
but if you grind the weekly and daily challenges you can get atoms right? my friends plays everyday and he always have more than 1k while buying shits on sales lol i just pay
---
The main quest legit has no actual ending to it, the other half of it is supposed to be in wastelanders, that’s already enough evidence lmaoo
---
Agreed. This subscription is overpriced for what it gives.
---
As a scollege tudent, I get Hulu + Spotify + Showtime for $4.99/month. Heck, I get Prime for $75/year. 
---
Even without student discounts, most subscriptions are cheaper and offer way more. 
---
Check out Albion Online. It's basically what I wanted from an online Fallout - the futuristic nuclear setting. Oh and the sub is dirt cheap + can be purchased with currency you can get in game.
---
Yes, it is. If it was only 24%, no one would use it.
---
Did you forget about elite skins coming out instead of content for a couple of months, and all the hit box glitches for the longest time.
---
Doubt it. It's probably just taking longer to get everything done. Crossplay would take a lot of work and there has been no mention of it
---
Also harvest purified water to sell.
---
Dont take medx neither fury, you dont want damage resistance nor endurance going down, take formula p, it's -1 charisma -1luck
---
I like the freedom of having full health and sprinting everywhere with my Junkie's build. I prefer a full set of Bolstering Sentinel rather than Vanguard because you become harder to kill as the fight wears on as opposed to seeing your health drop faster and faster with Vanguard.
---
I can switch over to sneaky bloodied unyielding within just a few minutes if I want to do max damage such as in the SBQ fight.
---
i actually enjoyed that mission as well lol... the first time thru i was getting frustrated until it finally clicked 😂
---
I have been bangin' on about a PvP countdown timer for ages! 
---
It might actually make people take workshops again.
---
The rest he mentioned are perfect
---
this game would run more than 5 years despite it's hurt you all
---
i bet this game already created more income than god of war and horizon zero down together lul
---
Yes, it's 50% if you are addicted to 5 drug families or alcohol.
---
Thanks! I'll add you once I got home. It is 9:30 AM(GMT+8) here, and I might be online in 9 hours until 10 PM. It doesn't need to finish it by today, no need to rush it. I still have to finish 3 tadpole world quests too. But I wish to complete it by this week so I could increase my hoarding efficiency.
---
its my fallout 4.5 brah lol. il dip into public sometimes. i love the game but i feel it should have been just 4 player co op, drop in drop out and take ur loot with you.
---
 i aint on the whole hate bethesda bandwagon. I just got tired of them ignoring the community and instead of fixing shit and adding actual good content they've added a subscription. I can definitely pay 100$  a year but its not about the money its about the principal of the thing. They said one thing and then did another. Im not gonna sit here and pretend im never playing the game again because who knows how the game will be in 2 or 3 years. But right now as a consumer who has bought a product ive chosen to not continue using it because of the decisions the company who made and provides a service of said product has made , doesn't mean i hate the company or im influenced by a bunch of people on the internet just means till they get their shit together ill no longer will be using the product.
---
Games cost money to develop.
---
Not played since February.
---
 lies about Atom Shop prices ( Christmas Emotes ).
---
 I was bored shitless with content, uninteresting quests.
---
Patches had hidden stuff that Bethesda wasn't telling people about, also they continually broke aspects of the game and still do with each unprofessional patch.
---
The PR department are so full of Bullshit with their wording and their actions are condescending too ( write an Essay about cheating like a naughty kid at school / here'a a worthless 500 atoms, sorry for the bag )
---
Fuck Fallout i deleted it...
---
Battlefield V has the Pacific theater of WWII expansion... its FREE for owners of the game and the game is in a good state One year after a bad release.. at the same time Fo76 had a bad release.
---
And ESO you get much more bang for your bucks.
---
No it is a unique, no alternative game. Can you offer me another one that has a Golden Age Vacuum Tube Sci-fi Post-Apocalypse game for me? That has a detailed open world and building components? Those elements are keeping me play FO4 and 76. FO4 at 900h and 76 at 590h. I haven’t find any alternative yet. Tried Ark, The outer worlds with XGP. They are totally different game from 76.
---
It's amazing isn't it? I could see this kind of fierce loyalty if Bethesda were famous for making solid games. But they all  come out broken and need to be fixed by modders. I mean at this point Todd Howard could walk into someone's house, shoot their dog, and these fanboys would be calling them entitled for calling the police.
---
If the bag, the rum, and the broken promises didn't wake these lemmings up, nothing will.
---
3 stars?
---
Gotta pay for larger data packets...
---
I had a similar thing happen awhile back,&amp; while I can’t find the post...
---
Someone told me it had something too do wit my 3 matches worth of nuclear winter.
---
Although that being said,I don’t know if it has anything too do wit why it’s happening meow
---
Edit:Just too say,that the only reason I’m responding is because I had seen someone else post about gettin the same thing like an hour ago.
---
Not a know it all by any means,just tryin too help
---
Free Private servers!! WHAT!?!?! 😜
---
Always the same arguments, too. They aren't bright enough to come up with anything else. Just copy paste something some other dope said.
---
And look at how much more you can get in destiny compared to this.... a whole new locations, armor, weapons, modes, and raids. With 76 you can buy one PA skin and one outfit for $30 lol
---
Yeah, that's basically pay to win, except in this case having more scrap is a convenience thing. Frees up inventory space for hoarding other things. You don't inherently gain anything by being able to store more scrap. If they ever add some kind of legendary crafting system then it'll definitely be p2w, but until having huge amounts of scrap actually does something it's just for convenience.
---
I think all players should have gotten this box, honestly. I'm sure you remember when they claimed they'd keep raising the storage limits as they narrowed down performance issues. Really disappointing they repackaged that into a "feature".
---
Would be cool to make a list of current freebies to check on every day or so.
---
Nobody’s getting rich off of purified water bud.
---
You need a better hobby also that analogy is terrible, it implies that you're here to do the same when in reality you're better compared to a monkey throwing it's own shit at everything it sees.
---
Okay thank you
---
What's a 1st hunter I have been playing Modern Warfare since Thursday?
---
I would pay a subscription fee to see a breakdown of how many downvotes this actually got.
---
Deliberately making your game painful to play and then selling the solution is fucking toxic. I couldn't give fewer fucks if they did it for ESO.
---
Clumsy poop!
---
Yet now that the people attracted by the headlines have come and gone, the old guard of die-hard supporters and whales will desperately try to defend Bethesda's actions.  It is the way of things.
---
If you have first and give any indication you have it players will hunt and kill you just because you have it
---
Lmao, people who purchase the sub are telling bethesda it’s ok to do things like that, basically making the game bad for everyone else anyways
---
Fallout First is a shit deal, but attacking and nuking people because of it is quite possibly the shittiest reaction possible
---
So I can give you a Plans: Metal Bed in exchange for anything I want from the list?
---
Okay; every SINGLE post I’ve seen from this thread has been highly critical of Bethesda for the last two or three weeks. Before that it was a 60/40 split for negative. Now everyone acts as if it’s a minority opinion or counter culture take to condemn Bethesda
---
You aren’t fucking special. Everyone agrees with you, the subreddit agrees with you. Stop acting like everyone’s against you, it’s very cool to hate Bethesda since they announced this game. Get a real personality instead of hopping on bandwagons and acting like you’re a trendsetter
---
I find it helpful for multiple kills. Without it super mutant groups tend to find me too quick to stealth them all.
---
So you paid for private servers but you aren't playing on them???
---
Invite only lobbies minus the invite only part.
---
Wild Appalachia and Nuclear Winter
---
I’ve never had “max caps” sadly...
---
But all of the above mentioned tactics help a lot.
---
Also,one of the things I do,Is find out what outfits I can aquire that sell fer a good amount.
---
The Golf outfit sold for a good lil bit last I knew,&amp; there’s tons of em throughout WS,&amp; they don’t weigh jack,so I tend too grab them vs weapons for that reason alone.
---
+karma
---
You could try r/legaladvice
---
I make enough to sell 700 in one shot. So yes, it does work.
---
Private worlds are public worlds.  They just fence off an empty public world and call it private until you log off.
---
Apparently we gauge value differently. They charge actual money for atoms, which I *value* to be nearly worthless. 
---
If someone were to offer me 10k atoms, or a dollar, I'd take the dollar. 
---
So to me, their offer is $100/year for something that should be included in the price of the initial game, along with $0 worth of atoms. 
---
Another way to look at it: they're finally selling the single player game (which you can drag friends into), except they got you to pay an up front cost, a monthly fee to the console seller (Sony or Microsoft), using that as a sales funnel to court you into paying a monthly reoccurring fee - all for what should have been released as a single player game with optional co-op, to begin with.
---
I bet they look at all the folks still playing and replaying Skyrim and think "I wish we had a way to milk them for more".
---
Enjoy those atoms that will buy you a pretty costume, though.
---
Here's how Bethesda's definitions work.
---
*That power armor skin in the Creation Club isn't a paid mod, it's a mini DLC.*
---
*After promising all DLC will be free for FO76:
---
*That power armor skin in the Atom Shop isn't DLC, it's a microtransaction.*
---
Turn in ticket for targeted harassment to both Xbox and Bethesda.
---
Yeah, we should get back to complaining about the bugs they haven't fixed since beta and ask them for more features so they can charge us for them.
---
P2W lmao gets me every time. Also we don’t need an announcement when every scrub leaves.
---
They added me as a friend and even though I’ve blocked them they can still join
---
Maybe some of us have lives I personally am a full time college student work 20 hours a week and spend 5 hours a night on my company so if I get a hour I'm lucky and don't want to spend it doing stupid things like dealing with weight
---
Trying to find positives through these rough times lol
---
Damn dirty Subs.
---
Oh wow that's fucking annoying
---
For sure. Like the main story felt like the set up staging for quest trees for each faction.
---
I envy them lol. We got a kick out of this quest at least:)
---
Because money doesn't matter? Lmao the issue people have with it isnt that some people have it and some dont wtf? How out of touch can you be?
---
another thing to note is that the agility cap for sneaking is 50. yeah. in my experience, if you want to be undetected 90% of the time, you need at least 37 (unyielding + bird bones + shielded raider). at 15 I feel you're detected too often.
---
you might miss escape artist for the movement thing, though. that's also a variable in sneak. and escape artist completely negates it.
---
I wasn't comparing Bethesda or Fallout to a serial rapist. It was an example of relative privation, much like what you were trying to do trying to play off the objectively anti-consumer Fallout 1st with Bethesda's legitimate good works. One doesn't negate the other.
---
They made a South Park RPG that sold millions, but South Park aren't main stream or a large IP I guess. 😆😆😆
---
At least give your stuff away to your friends before you delete your character...
---
Purified water is the ABSOLUTE  best way to sell tonthe robot vendors for max caps every dsy, it literally take zero effort and you get maximum gain!
---
Grow up
---
Yea, actually I kind of do want factions lol.  I think it would make the game more interesting to have warring factions going at each other.
---
Well I think that the responders would’ve survived longer, they lost a majority of their manpower and leadership in the flood, so I bet they would’ve survived a little longer but still get wiped out by the scorched event
---
Yeah boo hoo , I got 600+ hours out of a 60$ game and I’m sad now! 😢everything should be free!
---
Upvote - this...
---
Depends on what your trying to do, PVE or PVP. 
---
If your trying for pvp, id reccomend running junkies weapons for one reason. The most damage you can do to another player per shot is 110. 110 damage is easily achieved running a full health build like junkies. This isnt to say junkies is bad in pve though. Junkies is an all around good build no matter what you want to do. 
---
If you want to destroy in pve, and have no intrest in pvp. Bloodied is hands down the way to go. Theres isnt a build out there that will come even close to the raw power a bloodied weapon will do, especially melee.
---
😔😔
---
Servers aren’t always jammed. Not like they used to be. More options for games with b0rderlands and 0uter w0rlds dropping last few months. Also maybe a bunch of people with paid subscription and private instances? Sooner or later everyone will have private instances for free.
---
&gt; Perspective ,The new game The Outer Worlds has a 40 Hour playabillity and is retailling at £45-£50.
---
A desperate little lie told by Bethesda boot lickers. Have you actually played TOW? Because I have.
---
Also, every single second of TOW is bug free and enjoyable, unlike in FO76 where basic things like exiting your PA is fucked.
---
I say this cause I'm on pc and I've never crashed in like several months. I get disconnects from time to time and that's it. I own a decent system but try to run the game in relatively low setting for better fps and I assume that's the reason why I rarely crash. I hear people get lots of crashes on consoles maybe the game's too much for consoles to handle
---
....and? Of course games cost money to develop? Almost everything in the world costs money to make yeah?
---
Are we really saying that a RPG can't be multiplayer? Are we that desperate to not bash Bethesda?
---
A RPG is a genre, multiplayer is a functionality. What the hell are you even trying to argue here?
---
It's funny when you got all these pro-Bethesda types talking about the "SlIpPeRy sLoPe FaLlAcY" to try sound knowledgeable but if we're gonna look at fallacies and psychology what about the [Sunk Cost fallacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunk_cost)/[Escalation of commitment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Escalation_of_commitment)?
---
Pretty much everyone defending Bethesdas greed and increasing presence of microtransactions upon microtransactions seems to adhere to both of those mentalities like *"I bought _____ and I've had hours of fun so I don't see the problem"* or *"I'm alright with buying _____ but when they charge for _______ I won't buy it as that's too much"* but I'm sure eventually they *will* buy it because they've already bought everything else Bethesda fed them like they're Oliver Twist *"Please Todd, can I have some more?"*. It's trying to justify the fact you've already given Bethesda a fair amount of your money and instead of cutting your losses and realising you and they have messed up, you try to pretend things are OK and actively seek to justify and defend corporate greed so you don't have to feel bad or silly for spending so much to help a company that's screwing you and the rest of your fellow playerbase over.

Starting one when Wastelanders drops might have early NPC interactions so I’ll be starting one fresh then!
---
Looks at my 75000 pound junk collection in Fallout 4 inside single container, hmmm?
---
I don't get the complaint about the tent. I mean if being over encumbered was as much of an impact in other FO games I could understand that argument but the effect is almost non existent.
---
I get it when returning to adventure from NW, or after switching out characters. It plays every time a notice pops up in the top left corner of my screen.
---
......okay? What's your point? Do you know who made you deal with weight? And what does having a life have to do with anything about this?
---
Bloodied 😈
---
The loss of detection is hit or miss, but the lack of sound when sneaking is the real benefit.  I use Escape artist and an Instigating combat knife when I dont feel like wasting ammo on low level enemies. I don’t even use any other sneak perks and I can still sneak right up on enemies and kill them in one hit without being detected unless I’m in their fov.
---
That convenience pays into keeping it rolling though.  Years before my students were spending VBucks, they were getting shark cards.
---
Lmfao, you are fucking pathetic. Pull your head out of your ass. Focus on real world problems it’s just a video game you fucking plebeian.
---
&gt;How do you know I've never played the game
---
Because you have an extensive post history but only started trolling this sub in the past few day. So you tell us, do you play the game? 
---
Honestly, as long and as self righteous as it is, I did read your post. You specifically said that anyone purchasing the sub is actively hurting the devs, the company,  the entire gaming industry and harming the world as a whole...that is where you say we should not buy the subscription; ergo how I should spend my money. 
---
My entire argument is that niether you nor anybody else have no say in how I spend my money, nor are  you are some white knight trying to give an PSA, you are a hypocrite and a troll, you do not play the game and yet you come here to a sub dedicated to the game, after playing games yourself with very similar policies to fan the mob into a frenzy.
---
 &gt;  Kids are getting so upset that BGS isn't just giving them everything for free, for ever.
---
Ah here comes Grownup Q. Adultman to tell us all what kids are up to.
---
Kids have been using this tired strawman argument forever* too.
---
Bye
---
!remindme 4 months
---
This too shall pass, hang in there.
---
Yeah but rockstar makes amazing, well thought out games, on their own custom engine. Besthesda does none of those things.
---
I dont have friends :(
---
I did but it is my choice to do all of that I would have it no other way but don't get made at me for doing something to make the little time I have to relaxece the way I want it
---
I don't think i care for much in the game. My only real gripe was the stash limit because, knowing as little as I did about computers, I still knew the talk about servers only supporting a certain weight limit was bull. Now that they have walled off the stash limit behind a paywall, I know I'll never get it. So I'll enjoy it as long as its fun to play and after that I'll uninstall it for good. But whatever happens this game doesn't get another cent from me after the $20 initial purchase.
---
Instigating is best on non autos.  lever action will one shot about anything from stealth. Bolt action pipe can as well. Tormentor and bloody mess in luck. Stabilized arms so you can aim. Dense chest, fireproof, and adamantium skeleton are key if you use explosive.
---
It may be a fallacy to use it as the base for an argument, but they've literally been pushing further and further with what they're trying to do. Once they establish a pattern of doing it, it's not a fallacy anymore.
---
In fact, disregarding a stance because it contains a fallacy is a fallacy in itself.
---
https://old.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/do254v/scrapbox_safety_question/
---
I love small detailed builds like this! I just wish we the camp budget was higher.
---
Mistriess of Mystery
---
Why let them nuke your camp when you can server hop?
---
I have no doubt somebody has been waiting for one for the flamer! Although I think there is a fire breathers one?
---
I mean, how else are they going to get you to pay for a FO1st sub unless they make the free servers less attractive? /tinfoil
---
For reference it costs around full years of adobe photoshop give or take 60-20 dollars
---
You missed the scrap kits.
---
Next is pay to mod.
---
I think the worst part is, that they waited until the 11th hour to reveal the pricing. This to me, indicated that they knew they were making a jerk move and needed to minimize the damage in even the smallest of ways. Keep people around until the very last second, maybe they'll be dug in enough to stay.
---
Also it's all for a game that released utterly broken, and has barely advanced beyond that point. It's on top of so many middle fingers from Bethesda (the beta, the bag, the rum, the cash shop, the selling of old assets, etc.). If this game was great? Maybe it wouldn't be so bad. But this comes before they made the game worth paying a sub for. They want that good will but won't work for it first. They think they have that kind of clout now. It reminds me of how Warner Bros. wants that Marvel Studios money but went straight to the end, rather than building up good movies for ten years to a payoff that felt earned. 
---
Bethesda has done nothing to earn this kind of gratuity and in fact, has only made a case for giving them less.
---
And lastly, their responses are pathetic. They turtle up, ignore their community. Only popping up to advertise something before going back into hiding.
---
And they have the audacity to preface this all with a shit veneer of "doing what the players wanted". When in actuality, it was the corruption of requested features. Now, we know that any time we ask for something, it's like wishing on a cursed monkey's paw.
---
I really think the game is sinking fast. It's hemorrhaging money and they have to break every promise, to make back that money so the investors eyeballing the studio won't move on.
---
I am still enjoing the ride!
---
Thanks!!
---
Same. The point of the game is to earn those points on your own. If you're just buying everything, wht the fuck is the point of playing? Theres nothing to work towards. Seems like it would get boring really quickly.
---
I want to dye my clothes or at least get a few color variants that aren't red orange and blue.

“What are other economies? The only dollar that matters is    *a m e r i c a n*”

It will provide you more than 23 hours of entertainment. 1 dollar per hour value is great.  My wife and I have racked up hundreds of hours for 60 each.
---
lol really now?
---
Do t listen to everything about it. It is a blast
---
Make and sell salve to vendors. You need the chemist and super duper 3 to maximize production. Get soot flower and bloodleafe from flatwoods and summersvilee sell
---
Thanks, maybe get off the post about Bethesda’s failures for karma train
---
I've been waiting for someone to crack the game offline.
---
I once said it would be cracked within two weeks. I continue to find it baffling that no one has bothered.
---
more dances/emotes/poses would be nice too
---
Yeah if you enjoy fallout its worth it.
---
I agree I'm sure someone out there has been but, why not award the community with something they will all use like a handmade skin?
---
In a private lobby, you may invite who ever you wish.
---
Imagine having nothing better to do then go around bothering people who spent there money the way they wanted too
---
Against who?
---
I will admit it can be a bit lonely by yourself, but if you want a super solid playtime you can't beat 1st. 
---
I think once Wastelanders comes though it'll feel more like FO4.
---
I feel like alot of important info and context is missing from this story.
---
It's called schadenfreude.
---
It's the basis of all comedy.
---
I play in a pretty good crew on there, I have not ran out of money for awhile and when I do I have all the businesses so it doesn't take long to get a bunch back
---
Google cap stash runs. Nuka-cola (4), Poseidon power plant (10), Morgan town (10). Whitesprings (5).
---
The only thing is 5.56 has two purposes, monetary value and ammo. If I can’t sell my 5.56 I can use it, and don’t have to hunt for lead and steel. I have a fixer and handmade. I really only use the handmade.
---
Nice idea , all for community building
---
Well, I'm actually sorry to hear that.
---
For all the flak Beth is getting I still feel like this was a worth while game and that was when it was 60 bucks.
---
my wife found it when her character was lvl 25. I interrupted and said wait....wait....wait....buy that! buy that right now! LOL!
---
Np!
---
Good for you?
---
Like what? I will gladly fill in details
---
Just dont
---
I did, it’s more the principal that they would go through that to do it
---
"I hit my face on a doorknob! You just don't know Bethesda the way I do!" *runs off crying*
---
I agree awful timing. 2 weeks ago we went from killing scorched and doing meat week to being at each other’s throats. It’s like the community is at a huge civil war right now
---
That's fantastic, maybe one day I'll stumble upon it for a visit :)
---
*loss of potential subscribers
---
you already bought the game
---
When the repair kits and scrap kits came out, we warned people that stuff like the fridge and protectron would be coming and you all yelled "slippery slope fallacy" then. Now here we are and the fridge and protectron came and then Fallout 1st came, and anyone who says "slippery slope fallacy" at this point might as well be saying "Zenimax can do no wrong and I'd eat literal shit in a wet paper bag if they offered it to me for $100."
---
This.
---
The higher ups are the ones that have the final say considering they are the ones that actually pay the people that are maintaining this game.
---
Omg, seriously, nothing is killing video games. *Nothing.* Video games are more diverse, more accesible and more widely consumed than ever before. Grow up.
---
Ok? So, you can choose to do this totally amazing thing, called "don't buy it". I know that's a revolutionary idea in here, but it's your choice. 
---
You **didn't lose anything**. The game you played before the sub service, is the same game after the sub service dropped.
---
What do you think that BGS could say that would not elicit a ton of negative reception?
---
Sometimes saying nothing is a better option than saying anything.
---
They don't owe anything to the fans, and they've proven time and time again that they will listen to the investors over the customers every time.  Talking about that, or trying to spin it in a positive light will not go well for them, and they know it.  They're taking the least damaging approach and lying low until people get distracted by something else.
---
I totally agree. I love(ed?) Bethesda. I love skyrim and oblivion and I liked fallout 4 a lot too. They make incredible single player games. But you can't defend these kinds of practices.
---
I just bought it amd am level 21. With all the hate it's getting im still having a blast. Just met Rosie and I love her.
---
How much do you get for one? I’m wondering how many machines I need for this to be effective.
---
As far as they see it nothing is going on right now. They probably predicted the backlash and  the profit to be made so they are just going about business as usual because they know it'll all blow over as usual.
---
I actually gave up on trying to play this game for now after 3 days of laggy and unstable servers after Patch 14. Gonna try again on the Halloween events and if the servers are still laggy, then I think I gonna jump on the uninstall bandwagon, not because I'm so pissed with Bethesda because of the 1st, but because they don't let me play the damn game with these shitty laggy servers...
---
Edit: Xbox here too.
---
Bethesda doesn't know what *drop* rates are, let alone exchange rates.
---
You mean that strange communist salute emote that didnt actually have an image right? I beleive it was a mistake and they are releasing a communist bundle soon so id imagine it will be part of that.
---
“Game needs more performance fixes” been said since launch, and you people give them money for shit that don’t work.
---
👋
---
Lmao. What a ludicrous post.
---
like why you're not playing in your own server. you can't go around wearing the ranger outfit with the ranger icon and not expect people to bully you.
---
K
---
https://old.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/dnv3oi/how_fallout_1st_affects_gameplay_this_is_pay_to/
---
Pay to win doesn't "strictly" mean combat, I think more often it is pointing to unfair advantages that make the game easier to progress.
---
Gta also has a massive map, more players, more weapons? cars, planes and flying broomsticks to wast money on than fallout stuff. Yet I love them both.
---
Rosie?
---
Go for it. You'll be pleasantly surprised honestly
---
Dont listen to the bandwagon. It's a fun game.
---
Icon, Emote, Clothes...
---
Yeah the pros def outweigh the cons. So much in fact the cons aren’t even on the radar haha.
---
I get that. and the fact that they’re probably gonna keep these things behind a paywall forever is even worse
---
1. This is just fear mongering and I don't think it will happen. Wastelanders isn't even an expansion, just a content update. When they actually expand the map we'll see if they start calling them chapters instead of dlc to get out of it.
---
2. This is already known. Mods were already confirmed for private mode only. Shows nobody read the article just followed the controversy from somewhere else
---
3. Yeah I think you're right about this. Every single update has introduced new bugs, or reintroduced old ones. Haven't had a single clean update and I've been playing almost every day since launch
---
I dont play 76, but to me the hate seems justified. It seems like they're just trying to get any form of income they can from a arguably failed attempt at a game they claimed for years was never going to happen.
---
thanks!
---
I'll be your friend, guy.
---
Well. You got attacked by total randos for having 1st items?? Than they nuked your camp area while you did nothing other than be a 1st member and you sent 1 message that got you banned on xbox? Seems like you had multiple outs but chose to fight and you lost in the end now your salty. Im not buying that a crew of people did all that just cause you had ncr armor or a 1st icon.
---
It's not P2W, but it is scummy practices. From what I've heard, they don't give you fresh servers, just old ones they stopped using. 
---
Not to mention it's not really private. Can't your friends hop on whenever?
---
For mod access I'm guessing you will need a sub and have to pay atoms to unlock them. Cosmetic mods will be allowed in public lobbies and game changing mods only in private lobbies. Creators will revive payment for their work in either $ or atoms. Characters in heavily modded lobbies will be flagged as modded and won't have access to public lobbies. 
---
If I was a greedy pub/dev that didn't care about PR that's how I'd do it. Could be worse.
---
And i assume they only went through with 76 due to the success of eso. Which to me seems like the far superior version of the Bethesda mmos
---
Dude might not have been able to play with his friends at the time
---
Well that’s just the fan base, I don’t know what else to tell you and you know how easily it is to launch a nuke.
---
I will agree with you there. I think the tent should be private world only and the scrap box should be for everyone. This game already had an economy problem, but now it's only going to get worse. 
---
There is no reason we can't all have the box and the tent is OP as fuck.
---
I mean, someone was gonna buy your scrap anyways
---
Prolly part of wastelanders which got pushed back.
---
Yeah on the same page when it comes to FO76.
---
I am on a little break but all the YouTubers convinced me to try my login over the weekend between playing OW, D2 and WF.
---
I never did the Wild Appalachia content and that was fun and since it has been a while I forgot most of the locations. Was great revisiting those.
---
And yes FO76 scratches a different itch. Also as a MMO Lite player I am not unfamiliar with pay to skip the grind and I am also ok with it. To me FO76 is a MMO Lite and the only real problem is it should really go f2p like Destiny 2 did recently.
---
MTX and pay to skip grind is more acceptable in f2p games. Hell in Warframe I can buy it all with no grind if I wanted to.
---
I've heard this easily dozens of times. The only difference this time is that you made it beyond the downvote hell.
---
Seems like people are starting to get it. Surprising given we've had these sorts of issues through most of the game's life.
---
Maybe people will start to understand that this is just how Bethesda are as a company. It's been a downward slide since Fallout 4 and I honestly don't see it improving for the future. Not just for 76 but for all future Bethesda games.
---
They all have diff stats. For instance, max lvl heavy studded leather has beat ER in the game, and is within a few points of heavy BOS combat DR.
---
I don't know about you but I find quasi-infinite ammo and junk to be p2w.
---
No TL:DR and you expect me to read a essay on a video game.. foh
---
Of course, but if people buy everything, aren't you likely to raise prices?
---
My biggest problem is the Scrap Box, that feels pay-to-win or at least an advantage.
---
No problem
---
Is Bethesda adding 4 and 5 star gear into the shop? That would be probably the worst thing they could do to the grinders. Make the most ellusive gear in the game locked behind a pay wall. That's some EA shit right there
---
I agree the way they went about it is super shady I expect in the next month Beth will make some bull shit statement. But what I do have to say is that after 2 days of playing in my friends privates it’s switched my opinion to being very against to pretty sold on them. We killed SBQ super fast no bugs or lag. Servers ran so much smoother. And I can see what you mean luckily I only have a few friends that play the game some can’t say the same.
---
And? You know this is my only reddit account how? Maybe when the game launched I was critical of it and my account was banned? Or I just have multiple accounts because who doesn't? How do you know? Who are you to tell me what I have and haven't played? 
---
But yeah I DID play the game. Played for about 2 months after launch and tried it again during the free trial with my GF and I've kept tabs on it. Not hard to do when it features in the news quite often. 
---
Again how do you know what games I play? How do you know what games I spend my money on? You talk about being self righteous and hypocritical and here you are judging me and telling me what I do and don't do based off of at best my post history (which has quite a few condemning other games for bad monetization). 
---
Also please quote where in the post I told you exactly how to spend your money?
---
God the only positive thing about the games industry collapsing under unsustainable monetization is going to be coming back here and telling arrogant full of themselves people like yourself "I told you so" lol.
---
Preach brother
---
 yeah but you can't buy that subscription with atoms
---
If vendors up their price above vendor proce no one will buy
---
well said. i uninstalled at lvl 30 and never looked back. wont give bethesda the satisfaction.
---
It's my gods honest opinion, this game was doomed from day 1.
---
The buggy B.E.T.A
---
The fucking atomshop.
---
The fucking mobs scaling to the highest players level in the area.
---
The insanely overpowered builds.
---
The instancing sucks in my opinion.
---
The RNG factors for everything are cryptic as fuck.
---
Fallout 1st is just the icing on the cake.
---
Im so bummed that I was excited for this and preorder the game. At first I enjoyed it and then suddenly everyone was running about with 3* explosive builds and we're getting 3* legendary weapons every other fucking mob while I saw about 4 1* legendaries across two characters (lvl 150 and lvl 70ish) and then could never catch up because some level 300 would mop up every mob like it was nothing while I was basically shooting them with frozen peas in a spud gun.
---
I honestly don’t understand why you are so angry about this
---
I do Alcohol and Psycho - because I use those 2 regularly so to avoid an extra addiction and having to redo them, those are needed.  The other 3 I tend to minimize losses of strength and such.
---
I've been noticing all the scrap is stripped at places I usually go to, may be just a coincidence.
---
Define "winning" in Fallout 76
---
That’s a good idea honestly. I know at the end of the day I’m just doing wishful thinking lol.
---
Again, you're literally paying to be shot and then paying for the medical treatment for the wound. I'm not sure if college is doing you any good if you're happy to do that and don't think anythings wrong with that.
---
Ive been playing a year thats a small minority of the base and it takes awhile for a nuke to land. You had plenty of time to exit before it dropped. It alerts the whole server and is on the map.
---
See I played eso and wasn’t a huge fan. But it’s kind of biased because I’ve always liked fallout way more than elder scrolls. I’m not really into magic, sword fights and things of that nature. Not even in books or movies. I absolutely hated lord of the rings and Harry Potter so that type of thing really isn’t for me.
---
What about for PvE players. Are they paying to "win" somehow?
---
Ooh that’s a good idea!
---
bro shut up literally no one said anything
---
I enjoy their games too! And I totally agree. We aren't doing them or the rest of the fans any favors by paying into this scheme.
---
I enjoy the Outer Worlds and "grieving" in Fallout 76 but TOW sure is a nice break from a buggy game and whiney BoS bitching at u for stealing they're junk or whatever, so I get your point. Fun is fun either which way
---
But it's not pay to win 😶
---
Right? Didn't know that was a thing lol
---
You do not have to buy it, and as I said before I left the game so I didn’t get nuked but it’s the principal behind it, I’m talking about multiple occasions as well not just one team or crew
---
The only problem with gta is now that there is so much content, as a new player you have idea where you should start. And getting the money to start isn't easy unless you know what you're doing. There is so much useless trash that costs way too much money to distract you.
---
 &gt; How it made it past QA, I'll never know.
---
This should be their company slogan.
---
&gt;You need to have a Fallout first subscription in order to use mods.
---
No shit? They already said Mods will be available to use later on in Private Worlds only (unless said otherwise)
---
Theres a price ceiling for materials I would imagine. No one is gonna pay 10 caps a piece for springs or screws
---
Yes, but there is large gap between charging 10 caps for ultracite, with a base value of 25, and the vendor price of about 70+ caps.
---
Good that you don't have to work yourself into a rage to move on to something else. Are you going to leave the Earth entirely in your next game?
---
The game itself is awesome. Been playing since December. Pay no attention to all the people bitching about it, most of them haven't even tried it yet. The first like 10 to 15 levels is a real cankersore but once you get more into it the better it gets. Welcome to the Appalachian Wasteland fellow dweller, enjoy!!
---
I get 6 for each with max perks. You can just set up 5 large purifiers and collect often. Every camp you run across, collect. You will have lots in no time. Also, harvest moth man eggs and make into omelettes. I think they are like 42 each and I collect about 28 each time.
---
I don't think it's pay to win.
---
I think it's pay to not have to deal with the annoying grind for materials and stash space.
---
It's disgusting because video games are supposed to be fun but they intentionally put a grind mechanism in the game that people obviously don't enjoy and then they give you a way to buy your way out of it. It's called a skinner box and it's a mechanism brought to video games from greedy corporations who are seeking to milk you for money.
---
This type of crap is disgusting and I hope that Congress will pass laws to protect video gamers from these predatory practices the same way that they regulate casinos.
---
Yea there is no winning in FO76. I don't like what Bethesda's been doing, they could've just put the fridge, robot and scrap box into the game for free and sold skins. I promise people would've paid for them.
---
I see way too many camps that have shit I know they paid for and there was no way they earned off of Atoms via challenge alone.
---
&gt;but the lack of sound when sneaking is the real benefit
---
Now that is interesting, I'm going to test that I had noticed lack of movement sound when in sneak but thought it was my Sneak 3, cheers!
---
&gt; I don’t even use any other sneak perks and I can still sneak right up on enemies and kill them in one hit without being detected unless I’m in their fov 
---
And I'll try Escape Artist without Sneak card loaded, got some things to test.
---
[https://twitter.com/bethesda/status/1110225138979651584](https://twitter.com/bethesda/status/1110225138979651584)
---
Ok.  Are they "winning" because they have items in their CAMP?  Is "winning" just... more stuff?
---
i did quit,..didn't uninstall but I'm not planning on coming back for at last 6 months to check and see if it's worth playing. tbh I was already bored and playing less. this pay for perks and not just cosmetics pisses me off enough to push me over the edge. I started Outerworlds Friday and started Divinity original sin 2 today with a friend.. both are fun and the second will take a good chunk of time.
---
Doing a heist glitch gets you good money. Making at most 250k for probably an hour of work is not a good amount of cash.
---
you can try to rationalize it however you want but infinite junk and ammo is infinite junk and ammo.
---
by that logic they could sell legendary gear in the shop and it'd be fine because I'm sure someone can come up with a halfhearted excuse.
---
p2w is not exclusive to pvp, you know. half of mobile games don't even have a multiplayer mode but that doesn't stop them from milking players off their last penny.
---
Wow!!
---
I got downvoted just for showin sympathy “if” these claims are true?
---
That’s kind of lame
---
But whatever,can’t win em all.
---
Stay Blessed ya’ll
---
Hey it’s because you used emojis, I know it isn’t right or fair but that’s reddit
---
Tldr. Outer Worlds is great.
---
Define "winning".  I'm curious to hear what you think "winning" means.  It sounds like having more stuff is "winning".  Is that what you're saying?
---
What’s your psn? I’ll gift you fo1st since you can’t afford it. Poor fuck.
---
Chill tf our sounds like your the only toxic one haven't had any experiences that you highlight
---
I stopped playing just before they nerfed the TSE. Along with the host of other problems I just couldn’t be bothered grinding for nerfed gear.
---
You'll be pleased to hear there is a discord for GTA Online where players look for others to assist with things like this.
---
Pay for convenience.
---
I merely commented on what has happened, any purchasable content that alters gameplay by giving a player an advantage or shortcut is PTW. Repair kits are PTW, unlimited scrap box is PTW, one shortcuts game mechanics, the other gives the player an advantage over a non paying user by having more storage capacity
---
OK, I was looking at that framerate setting yesterday and left it on "Unlimited", I'll put it at 120 and see if I'm stable on Ultra. Thank you :)
---
No sorry its a mutation. If you unlock starched genes perk card you can start taking mutations and that will help alot. You can find them in peoples vending machines for cheap sometimes
---
Yep.  There's a difference.
---
Me too! I agree with the entirety of your statement completely.
---
You hope the very few. I'm willing to go out on a limb and say I bet you it's over half the game population gets it.
---
Wastelanders will be $60, and pre-orders get perk loadouts.
---
Pretty fun game, bad PR and pratices
---
So you noticed the two black stars in front of the three yellow ones. my brother and I have been wondering when they would start selling them.
---
Honestly I disagree. GTA5 has a sweet-ass map, but... every mission is drive to place, third person shooter level, drive to place.
---
Your not alone my dude
---
Fallout 4 is the best. So clearly I'm not a obsidian fanboy. KoTor 2 was literally broken and unfinished until modders fixed it. The South Park games are meh. 
---
But... You are very, very wrong here. That's not what's going on. What's going on. Is that a idie dev with 1/6 the staff made a better Fallout game than the guys that made fallout 4.... That's the truth. We went from Fallout 4 to Fallout 76..... The drop in quality is UNSEEN in gaming history. And that's just a fact. Carry on.
---
So we agree that the material grind is not liked by anyone and they should just remove it from the game?
---
MTX?
---
Repair kits bypass the normal game mechanic of repairing via scraps, giving the player a paid advantage, similar to having a loot box with infinite storage for scraps. They’re both paid advantages, regardless of where the player is in the game.
---
Plot twist: it's the same community.
---
How did they get you in your private server?
---
Added me as a friend and joined from there, I even blocked them but they still joined
---
If it was a shack walled house I'd claim it was really in WV
---
Great Job.
---
P.S. before anyone gets upset, born in WV and lived there 30 years.
---
You can debate about stash box but anyone who buys kits is a colossal idiot. If you somehow "lose" to someone using those kits for some reasons other than imaginary, you're even more of a cosmic omega-level idiot.
---
I'm level 120 and I still remember my time as a low level player. First 10 levels of the game I was pulling my hair out. Didn't get much help either cause not many people on at that time. The whole survival aspect was new to me cause I never played any other of the other Fallout games higher than normal difficulty, so having to remember to eat and drink frequently kept a making me loose my mind. But once I got a better understanding of everything the game only got better. I helped out a few people including my best friend on there whom I literally walked him through the first 15 levels
---
Ha good to know, but I feel ya.  My biggest issue with it, aside from the obvious, is it is completely random, but will persist for over an hour.  I’ve only seen that issue come up a handful of times with other games.
---
I won't because we both know it's a loaded question. you can't even "beat" Fo76. although kevduit did "beat" the Queen at level 15 with his fists only.
---
but like I said, using that logic, it's OK if they sold legendary gear in the shop. infinite anything is usually deemed as cheating, and they're selling it for 10 bucks.
---
I'll be too busy working and then playing Fallout.
---
Isn’t a 3 star prime fixer basically a 5 star?
---
I would say around 150
---
As far as I know your damage output has nothing to do with your level once past level 50 (weapons below level 45/50 would have less damage output). It’s all based on the weapon, SPECIAL, chems, etc. I don’t think character level does anything after 50.
---
No one buys almost any junk at the display price. I wouldn't pay more than 1 cap each for ultracite because it's so easily farmed
---
For luke a sniper with no stars
---
Nobody cares that you are taking your ball and going home.
---
Are you familiar with probability and statistics?
---
It's a very complicated explanation but......yes they are paying to win considering that this game is basically a slot machine.
---
I got it for $7.50 and feel like I overpaid...
---
Credit to Bungie. They did manage the transition to f2p and MMO Lite much better and in smaller steps.
---
They were also much more transparent and they made the good call to go f2p because when you go f2p the rules change.
---
Not that there wasn't critical feedback. The sub reddit still has its posts about lack of content for $30 and re-skinning of gear and enemies. Also some critiques on the way the season pass works and the eververse store.
---
So not all great but still better than Bethesda.
---
Yeah it’s a bad service, but I don’t think it really impacts people who don’t buy it though?
---
yeah okay both those games are fucking garbage online, so gtfo with this bullshit.
---
In that case if it's not affecting anyone else then who cares?
---
r/FO76FilthyCasuals
---
I had 70 ultracite for 10 caps each, all gone.
---
TOW is more KOTR than a FO so I think it's a silly comparison for them to make
---
My goal was to one shot super mutants. because they're the most most dangerous in groups (to me). But damage can vary greatly depending on weapon. I'm a rifle build and can do 2k plus damage on headshots. So maybe 300-500 would be a good range?
---
Also to really maximize your build you should go all-in on the build. Having points to melee is just hurting your damage numbers.
---
And junk is what's used to play the slot machine? I thought it was scrip and legendary enemies.
---
6 BIG BRAIN TIME
---
I’ve been playing TOW last two days and it has not crashed once.
---
The karma train has dried up, bruh. Come back in 3 months, maybe,
---
so you dont have to do this pathetic barrel scraping.
---
imagine thinking GTA online is anything comparable to being able to play fallout online.
---
I've heard people mention freeing up 700 lbs of weight by putting all scrap into their box. It absolutely is P2W. Being overburdened, not being able to sprint can mean life and death in PvP.
---
You can plant some crops in open ground at your camp. You just need a fruit or veggie and fertilizer. You plant using the CAMP Build menu. I like melons, corn, and razor grain but I'm sort of new in this game too. Look for recipes in your travels and plant crops that you have recipes for.
---
I only bought the one month. I think it's worth it for the suit and points. The private server is okay too. But I bought the game to be a raider so I play on public
---
I would pay them 10 bucks for near unlimited storage. I wish they would just give us an unreasonable number so I can actually collect everything instead of cherry picking. I won't play the game until something like this comes into effect.
---
Its only junk stash for a reason. When you open the unlimited junk stash it only has to display 30 items. If everything you can keep in stash was unlimited then it would have to display hundreds of items. Sending all that info every time someone opened A stash would overload the system. If that info was stored on your system it would not be an issue. But everything comes from the server. Not agreeing with unlimited junk being a pay for item but many have bought just for the atoms and armor then will cancel after thirty days loosing the stash.
---
Right, and 10 is still way below the display price. My point is junk will only get cheaper because the supply will outweigh the demand. No one needs 30k aluminum but people will have that much and so they'll sell cheap
---
Yeah that's fair enough but that's due to the fact of there being no discernable definition of "winning" in f76
---
It's specific to not sound like "gimme any good stuff, I'm gonna resell it" because I didn't want to take advantage of ur kindness!
---
I have a lot of semi good weapons &amp; my plan was to give u a lot of them in exchange since I don't need them anymore when I get a perfect one &amp; they would still be an upgrade for lover levels. And I got not 1 of the heavy metal weight reducing AP regen +STR armor I want.
---
Pls don't assume my gear, thx anyway, have a good one.
---
Please start banning the trolls. OW is a great game, I agree, and I don't mind complaining about FO76, everyone is entitled to their opinion, but flat-out trolling/flaming should be a bannable offense. The community would be better off without them.
---
If you want environment story, don't mind extreme lack of polish, and have to have these things in an *official fallout* flavor, it's probably fine at 20$.
---
There's better options. I don't even have to name any.
---
And for Bethesda they apparently cost twice as much since they need to charge extra for them a year after they have been released.
---
Sounds like a good way to go to jail...
---
I like the vibe of this post. I dont really disagree the fallout 1st that much but this is a pretty honest and accurate post. Upvote.
---
Didn’t he drop an unsecured USB drive full of porn at a convention?
---
You don't know the meaning of the term white knight. A white knight is somebody who defends something, hoping to get something in return for it, but getting nothing in return for it. Like people defending the game and predatory business practices, the shills, the idiots, etc.
---
Kinda sad really, if the game is in good shape this won't happen.
---
QA is only tasked to test the functionality of content, not test it's balance.
---
If they did that and had a detailed outline of season 2 id be more open to paying extra. This silence and oh hey heres this is just poor communication and business.
---
I doubt it.
---
I stopped playing like 4 months ago. Booted it back up when I heard about an update and quickly deleted it after I saw the subscription.
---
I'll be returning weekly to watch this happen in slow motion.
---
If it affects the competitive aspects, then I'm against it. Otherwise I don't care. I have never cared. I've never hidden not caring, not from day one. And I've also warned at times that with how bad they are at understanding how to garner money through their shop that this would happen.  I guess it doesn't matter. I'm prob in the wrong demographic to spend my time crying over this kind of crap.
---
In fact, what I hate the most is that they failed so hard at maintaining competitive aspects to the game due to whining and poor implementation and then responding to whining by removing everything and putting it into a game mode I will never play. 
---
So that's a lost cause, and deserves a lot more complaints than a stupid sub for private servers. If no one was going to stand with me on that, then I guess fk all you babies now.
---
If you havent aggroed anything and is still in caution, it wont do much but the silence will make detection wear out much faster. 
---
If you have aggroed and in danger, you can get out of line of sight either through obstructing view or stay put of detection range then activate the perk. It will quickly deaggro mobs. 
---
If you are already in danger and whacking mobs in their faces, this perk will not help you.
---
Actually persistent private server that is configurable(with limits to avoid cheating) with the normal max number of players as the public ones. The server can shutdown itself or reallocate resources if no one is connected and can immediately turn on once someone tries to connect to it, it is possible now to make a copy of a service and run it in a matter of seconds because of technologies and techniques regarding microservices and orchestration. Bethesda can charge for this service alone for $10-$15 a month for the basic capacity. Minecraft private server costs around $15/month with 20 max players. Higher capacity will increase the price too.
---
The owners of these persistent private servers can invite or give entry access to other people. 
---
One of the configurations that I can think of is be able to make multiple factions. Related settings like hiding your locations from non-faction members and being able to attack other non-members without becoming wanted to your faction members. Putting a minimum bounty(1 to 5 caps or probably other currencies) to non-faction and it can keep on increasing with their kill-streak(and will return to minimum every time they got killed) to make PvP more fun.
---
For those that are more into PvE(like me), there can be some special events that can be invoked(with restrictions) by the owner or managers. Like a raid quest similar to defeating Scorchbeast Queen in nuked area but requires several steps to be done by everyone all over the map. Reward should be balanced based on how difficult it is.
---
I'm sure this will not only make Bethesda earn more money, but will also increase players.
---
Naw were sperm whales cause we are dicks apparently.
---
That’s what I thought, I’m going to love around some perk points as I continue leveling up.
---
&gt;You know this is my only reddit account how? 
---
again!, it's against the TOS of Reddit to have multiple accounts active and it is typical of trolls, so, yeah, you may have multiples, but this is clearly your main. You do know your entire history is public, right? 
---
&gt;h I DID play the game. Played for about 2 months after launch
---
So you haven't really played for 9 months, so like I said, you don't play the game and you came here to provoke and fan whip the mob up. You're not some grassroots effort to change gaming, you're astroturf and a troll, by definition.  
---
News flash, the gaming industry isn't collapsing, its booming under a very successful market model. You don't have to like it but it's TRUE nonetheless.  I don't know if I really care one way or the other,  I'll play what I like, that's the nature of business,  they sell a good or service and I decide whether I want enter into that transaction.  See how that works?
---
this is not something I'd do personally, but some people would argue it does affect other players. the people who complain about oneshooting mobs in events, etc.
---
personally I'd say that, because of the online nature of the game, it does affect other players, at least indirectly. because we're all supposed to have the same limitations. I can't open the console and set my stash to "infinite", I need to pay 10 bucks to do so.
---
I've said this before but, if it's anything like ESO on steam you will want to keep away from it anyway. Stream's kinda midpoint servers that you got to connect to before connecting to bethesda's servers go down all the time making the game unplayable.
---
Dude yeah I saw this coming at launch. There were so many bugs I knew they were going to burn a huge budget on that alone, and I think maintenance is all the atom store can really provide a budget for and that's the reason we are seeing content trickling in. I would 10x rather pay for DLC then get what we have been...
---
&gt; I’m excited to see what unfolds as the next few months roll by with FO76.
---
More ways for Bethesda to take money while producing substandard slop.
---
for Fallout it just means someone opened up the game files and had a look at them in search for interesting stuff. There are a few programs one can use to do so. I assume they keep a copy of the previous version and just straight up compare it to an update. For images it's simpler, afaik you just gotta decompress the archives containing them.
---
Honestly its safe to assume anything eso is doing will be in fallout. Its following similar paths tbh i wish the 1st sub included 10% exp and caps and double the building capacity. Then it would be alot more worth it.
---
But what does that even matter since you can just go on ebay and buy whatever you want already? Geezus it's not like the site exists only on the dark web. It's available for everyone. There's already a shop. 
---
Listen, I'm as anti-corporation abuse as anyone, but sometimes we forget why. I will tell you this, it's not because a corporation has to turn a profit in order to keep servers running.
---
Ok I’ll have to look up these mutation things. First I’ve heard of them.
---
I was wondering the same thing. I've notice a lot of ppl are jacking up their prices on junk.
---
They should get whoever does SWTOR’s music to do TES VI. Just listen to [this.](https://youtu.be/ZgBMIPTv5_c)
---
Its true, im curious what they can do with a sequal with  a full budget at there disposal.
---
lol short life. This game isn't doing as poorly as many AAA titles at a year old, it just has an online service it has to pay for.
---
If you turn your profile offline they can't join your game off your profile. It's a great way to stop that. Only friends can join you. Hope this helps
---
People are angry, and they let that sank deep into their heads, so they'd make irrational statements and stuff, just give them time to calm down. I mean they are entitled to get angry given the game's shitty state.
---
But I have to say again all that stash weight argument is plain silly.
---
Yea all I’ve found so far is corn and mutfruit, both of which make a soup/drink so they are helpful so far
---
Where are you getting that there is infinite ammo from?
---
Its because it would be public acknowledgement of a mistake and would leave them in a position I wouldn't know for sure. They could be monetarily liable to people for it, and more.
---
But it would be better for the game and community as a whole.
---
They're fucked
---
This is everyone, and is why it has come to this. I'm not blaming you, the offerings could be better, lower-priced, and without being subsidized by game events, and they wouldn't be in this mess.
---
Wow nice homophobic comment there, I think that's about enough from you...
---
I give them all the backlash I can when they deserve it. But tbh for a 1-week thing that is a one-off then yeah I don't really care. If they did it regularly then I'd grab my flaming pitchfork for sure.
---
Outer worlds actually has good characters and writing.
---
Next time give your money to a homeless person. It'd actually be spent well that way.
---
you can control workshops indefinitely. the munitions factory alone is bad enough, but you could also farm junk and minerals for infinite junk as well.
---
so full of apologists?
---
its funny you think they are known to keep their words.
---
you paid for this theres a clashing of ideals here whether or not you do pay for it theres a reason people are doing this its cause there pissed at the general class of people who bought it, why i do it
---
Moonshiners shack near the vault. Butchers bounty. Kill some ticks, butchers bounty, server hop. You'll never need stimpacks again after 2 hours
---
lmao so u didn't find bethesda's actions ludicrous eh?
---
Maybe you can test it out in game with damage numbers on and tell me.
---
Or just add up the numbers, like fire rate*damage per shot.
---
Totally agree, people coming to this sub from outer worlds just to harass fo76 players and promote their game was bizarre. Some people making posts have never posted on fo76 subs but are very active in the outer worlds, really weird
---
Any number of indie games? And I would say you'd get more out of coffee or movies...
---
I original thought they were permanent, but after making an addict build with junkie weapons, found that addictions eventually wear off and so decided to switch to bloodied build
---
The reason I asked if you were familiar with probability and statistics is because thanks to the binomial distribution we know that the more spins one has the chances of them hitting the jackpot are increased.
---
So no.....junk is not what is being used to spin the wheel......time is what is buying spins at the wheel. The more time one spends killing legendaries the greater their odds are of getting the gear that everyone is looking for. Advantage goes to the guy not wasting time farming junk...... therefore he paid for an advantage.
---
Now who's rationalizing? 
---
I can make ammo faster farming materials server hopping public worlds than staying in my own private world all day with every worshop.
---
Same.
---
Agreed. I’m a bit tired of TOW being brought up in FO convos and vice versa because it never ends well. (Even my Twitter recommended feed for Fallout is full of TOW tweets instead of FO ones!) TOW people have been passive aggressively sniping at FO and its getting old. Even Chris Avellone is doing it on Twitter.
---
Just let people enjoy their games and leave them be. Leave TOW in its sub, FO in theirs. None of the games, not even NV, is perfect. So everybody simmer down.
---
Oh I thought this was making fun of people who played in general. Didn't know the people here actually thinking the game was good beforehand.
---
if you have and use all three - wouldnt you know the answer to that question yourself ?
---
Its really no different to the people that have 10 mule characters that they use for storage for junk and ammo? it just makes it easier to manage the junk by not needing mules for that purpose anymore. They still have to go out and grind to get the junk in the first place. Its not pay to win in the slightest. It is pay for convinience. It would have been so much better if this was free for everyone, but like most big companies, monetizing stuff like this works better for them.. so why not?. people will still pay, and people will still play.
---
&gt;How many other greedy things do you people support while lashing out at bethesda?
---
None that I can think of.
---
Unfortunately pistols and 1h melee aren't great right now. I started with a pistol build and then turned it into 2h melee then into a mix of unarmed melee and rifles, and now I'm just a sneak rifle build. 
---
You dont need a 3* weapon to do lots of damage. A 1* bloodied weapon and a single mutation that costs 250 caps at most players vendors (adrenal) will significantly boost you damage when your low health. My 1* bloodied 10mm pistol does about 600 with a sneak headshot with no pistol perks at all. My 1* bloodied lever does 1600 sneak headshot damage. 
---
Pretty easy to get yourself set up to do that damage just by finding a 1* and one mutation serum
---
I agree with you about how poorly the playerbase has been treated by the company. But I disagree that there is an alternative. The aesthetics and lore of the game are what are irreplaceable for me. the nostalgia is way too powerful. And there are many mechanics in this game that I have not seen anywhere else. 
---
I love the community way too much as well. It’s really sad that Beth doesn’t give a shit
---
Damn, I was expecting you to glitch and find a hidden loot under Whiterun.
---
Take advantage of it, OP. Bring some value back to the cap! People think the cap is worthless because of inflation, but if the cap means more junk and players are always going to buy junk, then that means the cap has value again
---
How did Obsidian go sjw?
---
The Outer Worlds is more directly related to Fallout than Fallout 76 is lol
---
Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory eats Bethesdas &amp; EAs for breakfast, still today. Superior gameplay 15 years later, it's free (as in "Wolfenstein - Enemy Territory"-free), you can download it now and start running your own server within 15 mins depending on your connection. A plethora of (free (again)) mods to tailor your lusts. Amen.  
---
DO YOU HEAR ME BETHESDA. WOL-FEN-STEIN ENE-MY TER-RI-TO-RY
---
I still wanna know what baboons paid for the sub.
---
Search for builds like this: Vats crit sneak build, bloodied is nice. Unyielding armor nopa. 8 mutations. Bloodied lever gun.
---
Level shmevel. Using the above the damage is 200+ to 400+ each hit on the queen. One or two shot everything else.
---
Mele builds are stupid. No offense
---
Holy shit, how have we become so delusional
---
What did you expect? They had your money, and they're not gonna do anything more.
---
there's a limit to how much lead you can pickup per day, you know. workshops are the only way to get unlimited resources.
---
I’m pretty sure the infinite survival tent is a glitch. My game just said it couldn’t place mine so it gave me a free placement.
---
Having no max on junk makes no difference to the amount of ammo people have. Most ammo weighs 0, which means people can convert their materials into ammo whenever they want without having to consider ammo weight. Being able to hold more steel and lead makes no difference on how much ammo I have, it doesn’t increase my farming rate or ammo production, it just means I don’t have to convert my materials to ammo as often
---
&gt; Human NPCs were never planned
---
Says who? The same people who said an unlimited stash wasn't possible? Right before charging you money for... an unlimited stash?
---
Sure, you could be right.  But given Bethesda's mixed record on honesty, my conspiracy theories are no more, no less valid than anything that they have said.
---
I don’t have all 3.
---
No, you’re right! I have to tweet my character a bit and move around my perk points. 
---
I like pistol/sneak and grenades.
---
Todd: Sixteen times the detail.
---
If a year wasnt so expensive, and i understand why it is cause servers cost money, but if it wasnt as expensive they probably wouldnt have gotten this bad of backlash and if it actually had stuff worth a dsmn besides the server and box it could possibly be justified, but thats the only things worth it
---
People are right to be angry with the game being shitty at different areas, but you are damn right things are blown the proportion.
---
All the P2W non-sense is just laughable.
---
Naw my main was melee. 3k damage is easy to pull. they're pretty beastly.
---
But not 2? Coward.
---
Good tips, thank you! I love sneak/pistol but can’t figure out what to use as my second. Maybe 2 handed melee would be more effective.
---
Well, I'm not exactly sure it's the basis of all comedy, but it is the basis of some branches of comedy such as slapstick.  Literally deriving joy from harm.  Who'd have thought that I'd get into a debate on origins of comedy in the middle of a shitstorm!
---
Thank you, I think I needed that!😂👍
---
I was talking about the munitions factory. the stash is not directly related to your ammo, only indirectly.
---
Yeah I was on a break and jumped in over the weekend because Angry Joe said I shouldn't play this game and I most definitely should not log in ever again! So I did what every reasonable man would when someone tells you NOT to do something :)
---
Anyhow saw Survival was missing. Pity still wanted to try it out but Destiny 2 demanded my time the last few months.
---
Yup, same.
---
&lt;3
---
Micro Transactions.
---
I see you deleted your comment about having a limit to how much lead you can pick up in a day. 
---
I can give you pointers to making ammo if you need it......I farm and make thousands of lead a day server hopping public servers.
---
Yet you still post here.....
---
I completely get your point, understand and agree mostly, except i think that if they did do this, they would have coped as much flack as they did for fo 1st.
---
That said, i would be alot more understanding if they actually came out and told us what the hell is going on with all the broken promises
---
I will happily do all that if they give me my money back. As long as they have taken my money, I have the right as a consumer to demand a certain degree of satisfaction from them. Bethesda is not doing me a favor by letting me play their game. I am buying a service from them, and I have a constitutional right to demand that the service should deliver what it promised.
---
Yeah hopefully 2020 with the new DLC.
---
Can't they take all of the work shops on their private server without dealing with PVP?
---
Maybe if we were talking about DLC beyond Wastelanders, but if you think the latest "controversy" is bad, imagine if the news was actually that everyone had to pay for Wastelanders.  At least this way, it's an option.  Those who want it for free just need to hang tight.
---
Ah, right I get it now. So doubling down on the shitty ideas and causing a wave of people publicly shitting on them as well as swearing off the game was meant to fix the lackluster launch.
---
I honestly forgot about the free DLC thing I wonder how long it'll take Bethesda to do the same?
---
ok -  i thought that because you wrote "  but I also like the plasma gatling and flamer,  "  - i guess you didnt mean explosive versions
---
Dang the shills are all over this. Like seriously, not only do they rip off their fans and customers, but they actually pay people to deceive and manipulate. Scummy as fk. Hopefully one day those doing it come out and expose them on their shit.
---
1st. The atom shop is overpriced, $8 for some shitty paint jobs is reasonable to you? 
---
2nd. No-one cares that you have to pay for private servers most people know that it'll cost money to run your own. 
---
3rd. People are fine with wastelanders being delayed people but people are upset because Bethesda has a shitty marketing strategy
---
Trust me, unarmed is king. I love my super sledge and my grognax but the power fist and deathclaw gauntlet do more damage and are lighter. Unarmed does more damage because its effected by BOTH talons and twisted muscles mutations. Only downside is you can't use em in nuke zones
---
It's been removed... weird.
---
That's funny, I saw a post on here explaining exactly how it is pay to win early today.  This was by a player like you, who originally didn't think it was until after spending some time with 1st, I think you'll come around too.
---
I didn't. reddit is being funny right now.
---
granted, I'm not a pro at ammo crafting, so correct me if I'm wrong. but if memory serves, you can produce around 1000 5.56 per hour in the munitions factory. so that's 24000 rounds per day.
---
can you craft that much with just world pickups? per day?
---
I'm interested to know as well. I don't think OP even knows what SJW means.
---
Separate the characters, loot, and everything else on the private servers from the public servers. Problem solved.
---
Ahh thank you.
---
Right? If that content is going to be put behind a paywall, then I am out. Plus this game won't survive in this state after early 2020 for additional content. This game is going to be losing support before too long, it is  beyond salvaging at this point. I'm doing the halloween event and then I am done with this game. I picked up where I left off in Elder Scrolls Online tonight, and the content is night and day with that game compared to this one. So much new content since release day, and content planning to be released for a additional few more years bare minimum. No big paywall either.
---
Thanks for that, I have found line of sight important, I need to separate Sneak Perk and Escape Artist now and see how things work without these combined.
---
16 times the microtransactions.
---
So having more legendaries is "winning"?  How many legendaries does a player need to have to "win"?
---
I'll test this out at Wes Tek and that lumber mill to see what changes if I remove EA perk and or Sneak :)
---
You know damn well they meant "unlimited" instead of unlisted. you dont need to intentionally muddy the waters to help your point.
---
Wut
---
I just won't spend any money on it.  I'll keep playing now and again, but right now I don't feel like I'm being offered anything worth extra money.
---
... did you even read the comment you just replied to? xD
---
I used to do a lot of nuke zones, so I figured melee was effective. But now I’m looking for more damage output. I’ll definitely look at unarmed!
---
To support:
---
The no clip doc states from Bethesda that they actually had human NPCs in the game but wanted is to feel special if we heard gunfire, etc. and to know that was a person  we heard.
---
To argue against:
---
They've fucked up so much shit we'd already know. Data miners tell us what atom shop stuff is coming out. We've had scorched behaving like raiders (walking around like people- scroll through posts and see). They wouldn't be able to keep hold of this if they tried. We'd know.
---
Summary: nah on release they actually realised they needed more to keep this online and pulling in money. They made wastelanders to do that.
---
saw that coming. not only was i lurking because of the train wreck that is fall out first. i was lurking all / new posts. 🤡
---
Really is hit or miss from my experiences lately. Sometimes it’s smooth while other times in combat it’s almost unplayable
---
No, I did not know what you meant, which is why I asked for clarification. Thanks for letting me know.
---
True that DLCs are better than subs but trust me people would be saying different things to criticize the game even if this is the case. Simply because the game isn't polished well enough in quite a few important areas.
---
Yep, played both over the weekend. Like both for different reasons.
---
legacy GPs and flamers are supposedly bugged. GPs with the splitter deal full damage per projectile, not split. and flamers are essentially a minigun with neigh infinite range.
---
the difference is quite noticeable, especially between a .50 cal and a gatling plasma.
---
Lazy people be lazy I guess, good for sellers.
---
You can do it only if you subscribe to Fallout 1...
---
Bethesda: releases broken content behind paywall 
---
Fans : Gladly accept such a gracious gift 
---
Everyone else : visibly confused
---
Oh I should specify you can use unarmed in nuke zones just not in power armour. You would either need rad x diluted/radshield and rad sponge teammate, or use a rad suit
---
&gt; but it will go back to bug reporting
---
lolololololol
---
Except ESO was originally marketed as a subscription MMO. It was fleshed out, it had enough content to fill the levels, it was something more than Skyrim minus the NPCs that 76 launched as and still is. You're paying for a sub for Fallout 4 with less content than 4 originally had.
---
MTX in mobile games has been atrocious for years, yes, but having your argument be "things are already bad, how much worse could it possibly get" is inviting the worst to happen.
---
Fallout "FuckYou" First is hardly the first time that an egregious MTX model/P2W/subscription has been done, but its as the OP said, things that are happening today would have essentially forced a company into obscurity or ruined an IP. It's as was said originally, they'll push and push until they get some backlash, then they'll back up as much until everything is positive again.
---
tl;dr(cause you obviously only read that): Fallout First is not the first time this has happened, Fallout First will also not be the last.
---
No.
---
Don't you?
---
I imagine this is a quick attempt to help stop bots or people from guessing passwords until 2FA comes.
---
bethesda is known to make some ludicrous moves lately so
---
But, I like the game and that $100 will help me enjoy it more.
---
Who are you to tell me how to spend my money and what I should enjoy and find value in?
---
Todd promises a lot of things. Sweet little lies.
---
A Bloodied Explosive Handmade will get you anything you want in the game.
---
You don't consider that winning?
---
Again...... before we go any further......you are familiar with probability and statistics correct?
---
Are you ok?
---
"Microtransactions"
---
You didnt know what "they" meant.
---
It's p2w because people craft unlimited ammo just by having that and a scrap bot then just afk. And the fact that the tent is indestructible in pvp.
---
I price mine at 10 also.
---
I quit a few months after release, came back and quit again after a week, because somehow they manage to screw up, while still not able to fix a broken game a year after release. I have real pity for people who are sticking around playing this game, and continue to give them  money. They are laughing all the way to the bank at idiots who spend their free time being unpaid shills. Like do you really think people at Bethesda have any respect for the amount of shit you people can take, and still you hold out your bowl asking for more? "Please sir, can I have some more?"
---
Yeh they can. But I've also been able to do that quite alot on normal servers too without anyone bothering to take them off me.
---
I hope the tourist wave convinces you guys to stop endorsing Bethesda's greed...
---
Move to PC (unless you mainly play NW, its hackfest on PC).  I’ve never experienced anything on PC FO76 even remotely like you describe
---
What I hate is the high pitch “dropped my car keys” sound when I go invisible.
---
If you finished in 20 hours then you didn’t do any side quests dumbass. But go ahead and call it bland while you defend this pile of actual shit.
---
About a month ago, I finished the long grind and **turned in 5,000 Monster Mash candy and I got a one-star Crossbow.** 
---
That event needs a huge buff to its rewards.
---
I would have given 1st to everyone free then dropped the bomb of paid DLC. I think that could have softened the blow
---
Get help please
---
I don't consider "more stuff" or "better stuff" winning.  What do I win?  How does that make me win?  If you're talking a PVP encounter, does collecting 50 caps mean that I won?  And to win those caps, does the gun aim and shoot itself, or do I have to do that?  Is my player skill secondary to the weapons I can or can't aim?  In a 5 second long engagement, with damage per hit capped?  Do I "win" if I have more caps than anyone else on the server? 
---
Define "win".
---
Sneak is easy to cap. If you already have high agility and a few sneak legendary pieces, you don't need sneak perk at all. Rank 1-2 sneak is more than enough. The thing about escape artist is that it removes walking sound penalty which is a unique and valuable utility.
---
I agree whole heartedly, nothing they have sold is pay to win, at all. There has (apparently) been outfits sold that give you some buffs, there's repair kits, etc, but they are not sellimlng anything like wepons or actual armor yet.
---
And thats a big yet. They promised in E3 that anything sold would be cosmetic only. Buffed outfits, imo, are dancing on and almost tripping on the borderline, but things like repair kits, the fridge and junk bot are obviously breaking this promise. Once again, i dont think these things are pay to win, the point is the broken promise.
---
I also think its a slippery slope for them, and if Bethesda dont catch themselfes soon, they will loose whats left of their fanbase
---
You're reading it literally. It doesn't mean that. P2W means getting an advantage (*any* advantage) over other players by paying money.
---
1st Reddit post ever and you come specifically to FO76 subreddit to trash the new Fallout 1st subscription... right...
---
Not buying a brand new Reddit user doing this... “hey let me hop on Reddit that I’ve never been on and complain on FO76 subreddit! About the new service!” 
---
Literally no one does this...
---
Yes. So do magazines, drinks, and food. Bullets also disappear out of your inventory after you fire your gun.
---
Yes, they are single use items. But they are very easy to find. Youll recoup them in no time.
---
Ya they are a consumable, so using them makes them disappear
---
YeP
---
See, this response is a prime example of the sort of worthless blog posting that will go away soon
---
I think it’s the junk box and tent, since that frees up hundreds of stash weight. It’s also just that people don’t want to promote bad business
---
I think Fertile Soil is going to be hard solo with a brand new (Level 5?) character. Probably only 20 farmhands normally though.
---
You are happy paying not only for the original game AND the online service of your choice (XBOX Live, PSN, whatever) but an additional HUNDRED DOLLARS TO PAY ON A BROKEN PRIVATE SERVER. Why? PLEASE justify this cost to me. I see absolutely no reason whatsoever to spend that money. Even if I actually liked the game, I wouldn't spend that money - an MMO membership can cost similarly, yes, but for that you get far more content.
---
Actually, don't bother justifying it. If you're comparing the subscription to a full-content MMORPG to Fallout 76's "pay us $100 PA to get stuff we should have given you for free" bullshit, you're too deluded to see what went wrong.
---
On my PC it’s running good
---
Stuff feels ridiculously hard. And I cant even sneak past them before they fill me with holes
---
Create a problem annoying enough that people will pay $100 a year for the solution.
---
Not sure honestly if those special quest ones co8nt as they dont show legendary stars
---
I am.  Because its not pay to win.  Its exactly what you just said: pay for convenience.  Nothing else.
---
I don't think he deleted it.
---
I've had several comments disappear in this thread that still show in my Reddit history but not here.
---
I guess Bethesda is paying for mods to do damage control and hide comments.
---
Arguably because the ESo subscription is good value for money it gives you access to all the DLC for ESO which is a fair amount, something like 5 addons all priced at about 20 dollars + the extras like the crafting inventory.
---
Fallout 1st it literally the most bare-bones version of eso subscription model possible as well as the fact that it paywalls "private" servers (the jury is still on the private bit there)  which means should you want to mod the game you'll need to hand over your sub fee before you even start to buy the mods  you want from the creation club bullshit (assuming mods are ever allowed as they directly compete with skins and other atom shop items)
---
But no other AAA publisher is offering a sub-model that gives you less as far as i can work out so its very likely that other publishers are watching carefully to see how this thing works out and if it is profitable even if there is backlash it's likely more will try this kinda thing if it makes money.
---
Fuck i want to go back to horse armor if only we saw that and realized it for what it and that it was going to be the basis for a whole fucking game.
---
It really depends on the build, if you are full healthed you can never beat the bloodied build at continuous DPS but can use instigating for good first shot burst damage.
---
If you sneak with the pistol it's actually a lesser version of rifleman builds, it's fun and fine. I have a B3325 .44 for VATS sneak take downs and I don't even use related perks. I'd say 2/300 ish is good for normal use. But it's better if you have another 10mm pistol because those have armour penetration and faster fire rate for larger fights.
---
The problem lies on your melee weapon, 90 is really low, you need melee mutations, unarmed is king but any melee is viable.
---
I wonder if most of these posts are being made by one single very angry Person lol
---
No you see atoms have literally no actual value. To them they’re nothing. It costs them nothing to give them to you. It’s shit like this that fools you into thinking it’s “worth it”
---
MiroTranXactions 
---
(the X is not actually there :P )
---
What level are you. How long since you started a new character?
---
Who are you to think you're immune to criticism?
---
Bethesda, hire this person and fire whomever thought it was a good idea to do Fallout 1st. 
---
Todd: if you were the one who thought up this subscription, fire yourself and leave the business. Seriously.
---
What's the part you're getting hung up on?
---
it's happening in the sub thou shalt not speak of as well. just being screwy in general, I guess.
---
I agree with your points (I don’t think it’s pay to win in literally any form) but I do believe the Tent, Scrapbox, Collectron and the Fridge should be earnable through in-game play.
---
Nopers. However, I usually keep to myself.
---
I never needed to glitch. And an hour of playing a game isn't work. And yeah 250k is a good amount of money. Holy crap... How much money do you make in this game in the same amount of time? What can you really buy with it?
---
No, it wasn't...
---
The first step was Unstoppables outfit boost. Why are people acting like this is such a surprise?
---
Juicehead just talked about this in a video. It kinda seems like a corporate decision that had nothing to do with bethesda
---
That makes sense.
---
I didn't do anything other than relate Fallout 76 to a slot machine.
---
What is there to criticize?
---
You disapprove of me enjoying something just because you don’t like it?
---
That’s presumptuous and rude.
---
It’s fine to complain about how you think Bethesda is handling this, but not to complain about other people having different opinions.
---
&gt;You almost flipped it around Bethesda, almost!
---
I disagree.  The people who liked the game still liked it, the rest still didn't.  Wastelanders - once you get past the hype - wasn't going to change that.  
---
FO76 is not a single-player RPG and you've seen how Bethesda does questing.  The only difference Wastelanders would have brought is now instead of finding a holotape or a robot you'd find an NPC to speak the same short bit of dialogue to you.
---
I’ve always found it weird that people who don’t play the game anymore come here and post hate
---
"We hear you. And we don't care."
---
Todd Howard
---
Its Quazi187_ add me
---
Are you me? Haven't played in almost a year but I keep checking back in to see if the game has been finally fixed to be what it should/could be. I do this knowing full well it won't, but somehow Bethesda finds ways not only to not improve the game, but also give the loyal fan base a big middle finger from time to time.
---
If you think this reply of yours is unique and hasn't been seen in this sub for 375829154890164 times, you are sorely sorely mistaken. Plus, why the fuck are you here? You don't even play the game lmao
---
I can't play on PS4. The game runs so terribly that it's unbearable.
---
To me early parts of the game felt like human npcs would be encountered.
---
The alternative would be to play FO4 with mods (some really big mods coming up soon) until FO5 drops, and skip FO76.  Believe me I wanted this game to be something great, from day one.  But it does seem like they are screwing with us at least a bit.  Some of this stuff feels a bit off, like making a bad deal with someone.  As much as I love the FO universe, I'm edging more and more to accept my losses on this game and take a break until the next one comes out.
---
You forgot the scrap kits between 2. and 3., those came in between, which made it possible to send your scrap to your stash while on the go or at the beginning of (or during) a PvP engagement
---
I had just finished updating the game to start playing again.Then like that within 48 hours I uninstalled both the game and the launcher. RIP Fallout 76.
---
All other things equal, at least battlefront 2 was a good looking, good playing game that felt like something you'd actually pay money for. 76 looks like a 360 game that got a post processing filter added and sent out the door. And let's not talk about gameplay
---
The big publishers have felt this way for well over a decade. Just because we caught them lying today, doesn't mean their mentality just started.
---
Ubisoft, EA, Zenimax, T2, Tencent, etc... we are cattle to them and have been for some time.
---
Actually my friend that is a fallout nut job did just that but to defend it. It happens...
---
This is just pathetic
---
Plenty of people are justifying the F1st deal on this sub. And many are saying "yeah it's not great but I'm going to buy it anyway" or "it's my money it doesn't affect you"
---
It’s actually happening to me in multiple subs. Weird.
---
I will not skip FO 76 intentionally. I recently come back to FO4 because I completed all the content I can play in 76. But if they get new content out( for example, Halloween), I will go back to 76 and play for a while for sure.
---
The really pathetic thing about you people is, you spend as much time on Reddit as you do in the game. This is your actual life. While we come here for a few minutes to say what is on our minds, you live here, and in that broken mess called a "game".
---
Picture of proof or it didn't happen.
---
Xbox is Y
---
&gt; What is there to criticize?
---
&gt; You disapprove of me enjoying something just because you don’t like it?
---
No, you know damn well why. Don't be obtuse.
---
It's because you send the message that we can be lied to repeatedly, and still pay out the ass for a broken game that hasn't even been fixed. You give the ok to continue exploitative practices that will only get worse. So yeah, it affects the rest of us.
---
If you post your opinion in public, you're open to criticism. You know, just like you're doing right now. If you truly believed what you write, you wouldn't be talking to me right now.
---
Also it's not "presumptuous", if you start off by admitting you did the thing you're criticizing.
---
It's not the beginning of a slippery slope, it's hit the bottom.
---
More time to farm legendaries. More legendaries = better chance of finding the best gear.
---
It's the same principle of having 3 toons so you can get 3x as many rolls at the Purveyor. More time grinding events and legendaries without needing to farm junk increases your odds of finding a high valued piece not gear.
---
It also allows you to have unlimited ammo and materials to repair armor and weapons.
---
It also allows you to travel the map for less caps.
---
It's an advantage.
---
So spend your money on Xbox stuff then?
---
Reddit is busted
---
Comments are not loading, been happening all day
---
It's pretty fun and interesting too
---
How entitled do you have to be to believe you know better how other people should spend their time and money? It’s ridiculous.
---
Theres client missions, contact missions, vip missions, 5 types of businesses you can own, a full casino, you can run a motorcycle club, a ceo business, nightclub. They have fleets of high end cars to play around with, hangars full of weaponized vehicles, heists and doomsday heists, pvp and races, both of which have custom level editors. There is almost so much to do, its crippling.
---
FASCISTS hahahaha no way, you boys are crazy
---
How entitled are you to think you can't be criticized?
---
Ok so you're defining wining as:
---
1. More Legendaries
---
2. Better gear
---
3.  More ammo and scrap
---
4.  More caps
---
Ok.  Got it.  How much do I need of each of those to win?
---
Dude it costs more than Netflix, Hulu, and basically every other gaming subscription, (where you get a lot more value.)
---
You’re getting royaly screwed.
---
I did my best to like it
---
Can you prove that claim?
---
not gonna bother gearing up for wastelanders, i enjoy this game but it strikes me as something easily overhyped and disappointing.
---
Your game straight up said "ight I'm boutta head out"
---
At the point of reading this, it has 6 comments and i can only read 2 of them, both negative, so im going to say:
---
I UNDERSTOOD THAT REFRENCE!
---
i also give you one of my rear and basicly worthless "lols"
---
Now, onto actual comment:
---
Wile i dont agree with telling Todd to shove fo 76 up his  own personal fallout shelter (he may mot have a choice in the matter, there's probably higher ups ordering for this to happen), i do think that, if we dont hear what the hell is going on with them, or at least a worthwhile comment in the next few weeks, storming them may not be a bad idea.
---
But let is not go in hate, but in concern for a previously much loved company that has changed for the worst
---
Yes, there’s usually a lot and they do hit hard at early levels. Make sure you have armor equipped. Also, I like to use throwing knives against them. You can usually 1 hit the Mr Handy robots. The Supervisor Protectrons take 2 hits.
---
You literally pay the same if not more in games like Apex Legends where YOU CAN'T EARN THE CURRENCY.
---
Plus they will lose more players and earn less money
---
Like I'll ever log into adventure mode ever again.......
---
Private servers are running very smoothly
---
I understand the logic but are there no malpractice laws involving MicroTransactions? I thought they put them into effect a while ago which was the downfall of that Star Wars game EA made that literally had to get rid of or completely change their loot box system. Not sure if it’s only loot boxes or not
---
I’m not the one who’s doing the thing you’re opposed to: you’re angry at Bethesda and taking it out on other member of the gaming community. Your anger is misdirected, misguided, and misanthropic.
---
You do realize that on average 90% of people in any given online community are lurkers, and 9% of the remaining 10% post so lightly you would be lucky to find something even if you looked, and that is no different on reddit. So lack of posting on this subreddit does not automatically mean that they dont play the game.
---
All of that is true, but the subscription framework was already established with Bethesda. It's naive, in my opinion, to believe that it wouldn't ever surface in their 2nd online game.
---
I am paying for it, but at the moment, I'm ok with that. I think the price is higher than it should be, snd when I no longer feel I'm getting what I paid for, I won't continue it. 
---
I understand lots of people are outraged, but it's not going away.
---
Haha far too much for one mere mortal being. Perhaps a hive mind?
---
I think it’s a problem with reddit, as far as I can tell.  Been happening for a few hours
---
Some people define winning as doing cocaine off of a hookers ass who has aids.
---
Let's just stick with 'advantage'.
---
Anyhow..... Reddit is fucked up tonight so I'm done. Enjoy your disingenuous troll thread.
---
Giving advice to the rip off merchant on how to best rip you off is hardly the most sensible idea now, is it? :P
---
Plus it allows the company the cover of being able to say "we listened to the community and gave you what you asked for"  while giving you the good old double fister 
---
But your right it seems like Bethesda is frantically trying to make as much hay as possible while the sun is still out and it's not going to be there for all that much longer if it keeps going like this.
---
Then again nostalgia lets people get away with some real fucking shit as long as it has a passing resemblance to that thing you liked when you were a kid. 
---
Don't forget oblivion had horse armor and the creation club bullshit so this money over common sense thing has long been a Bethsaida trait.
---
The overly entitled childish reation from a portion of the community was a slap in the face to BGS.
---
It truly feels that way.
---
I'm not disingenuous or trolling.  I want fellow players to define "winning" and realize that nothing Bethesda is being accused of selling actually qualifies as "pay-to-win".
---
Not everyone has to like the things you like douchebag, and frankly coming here for discussion about a game we play regularly is way less pathetic than you unironically getting your kicks looking at the manufactured controversy here
---
have you tried setting everything to low? it's a common issue and related to the netcode, though.
---
if you want a smoother experience you can buy the pass, I kid you not. no stutters when you're alone, or at the very least a lot less stuttering.
---
That's what I felt too. I mean, when you read though the terminals in Flatwoods, you get the feeling these walls of texts were meant to be spoken to you by a living character, but it was quickly moved to be read on a terminal because there was no time to add the NPC.
---
And the weird way the quests end- some just end without further exploration or question. Why did that one quest with the kidnapped kid just end with the guy dead and the kid in a vault, and the Miss Nanny doesn't do anything? She should have lead me to the nearby Vault to find him. You get tons of information, and you get the feeling you could use this, but never do.
---
You get injected with some kind of vaccine that prevents the Scorched plague. At no point can you do anything else with that information. You find out that the Toxic Valley is the result of someone putting chemicals in the steel mill smokestacks. There's nothing you can do to find a way to purify the region. Hell, there was even the crashed space station that, until now, had absolutely nothing on it, save for a gimmicky spacesuit that didn't do anything special. Even the Vaults feel kind of limited- normally you could explore and learn the story of the Vault at your own pace, but you're blocked behind levels or too busy in buggy Vault raids to learn anything. 
---
Nothing was ever finished or considered, it feels. Just glimpses of what could have been. Imagine playing to help purify the toxic valley by using the Vertibots to disperse a chemical solution. Using that vaccine for the Scorched and the missile silos to wipe out Scorchbeast nests without blowing the world back to kingdom come. Imagine getting satisfying answers instead of "They're dead, move on"
---
I’ve tried all low settings. I have even tried playing on my private servers. Game still periodically lags.
---
What's hilarious to me is all these people celebrating paying a monthly fee to make the game a signal player/co-op game.
---
I fully realize that, however the few people I called out are very active posters on a ton of subs and only started posting on this sub to feed the mob.
---
It has nothing to do with liking things I don't like. When you pay full price for a game, that is still not working and functioning as most games do at release, with crashing etc. a year after release, then people have a right to say their piece about it, and make sure anyone who hasn't bought the game or is on the fence hears the truth about it. Not the one sided shill story they hope will drive more sales for that broken buggy mess that they keep charging even more money for.
---
I've been gone coming up three months now. Never get tempted to get back in; have plenty of other shit to do.
---
People are rightfully upset that they didn't get the fallout experience that they have come to love.
---
That in no way justifies the outlandish level of self-centered ignorant arguments that pop up against this product or developer.  I have never felt so embarrassed and angry to be part of a community that believes that they are entitled to whatever they had imagined the product to be.  
---
Bethesda is targeting those who can afford their services and not the average consumer.  This is a  completely appropriate and reasonable business practice.  
---
 It's absurd to get so triggered over being dissapointed that you feel the need to express how broke you are and to tell entire world you feel that way just cause you can't afford a skin you might like, or feel the product they delivered wasn't the experience you had expected.  How many trash movies have you paid to see and afterwards just chalked it up to a bad movie and moved on.  We all buy stuff constantly that isn't as good as we may have liked or expected.  Bitching about it on reddit is not a course of action as much as an excuse to be a troll.
---
I canceled ESO subscription because I deemed it unjustifiable.  I also won't be purchasing fo1st because for me it's unjustifiable.  For many people it's completely justifiable and that's why they offer the service.  They don't make games to provide you with an amazing experience.  They make games to sell in order to make a profit. 
---
We all know this game has a huge amount of issues and technical problems.  So what? Seriously.  Oh well.  That is the only appropriate response. Either buy or don't buy it.  Expressing your anger and frustration in the way the majority of this player base does is outrageous.  It's shameful to see how much many of you actually believe that Bethesda or the fallout franchise owes you personally anything.
---
The game wasn't all that you had expected.  Oh well.  Grow the f up.  If I worked at Bethesda and I frequented this forum I would probably enjoy putting out more features that trigger this immature self-centered player base. 
---
For anyone who believes that this is the way to communicate with Bethesda and that your opinion is desired or required save your breath.  This is the core of where the ignorance comes from.  Noone fkn cares. We could all use a break from it, and you aren't helping at all.
---
Wow a real gamer here folks, rage against that machine bro you're really fighting the good fight for us gamers and we all know Reddit is the most powerful voice in the industry
---
To be fair i have not played it yet.
---
General consensus seems to be on review forums is it is a decent game.And there is 40 hours worth of gaming,give or take a few hours obviously.
---
My point still stands though.
---
people having 200 + levels in 76 game and complaining about it is ridiculous.
---
I paid £15.00 for 76 it was the best £15.00 i have ever spent.I too have 200 levels in 76 now.Sure it is not perfect,but neither is any game.If i had paid full price i think i would still have had my money worth.
---
They're a caricature of the conspiracy theorist doomsday prepper culture that pops up in parts of the US.
---
Every faction in the game is pretty seriously flawed, it's just that some are flawed in the, "murder everything and take what I want" way, some are flawed in the, "military is the best government" way, and some are celebrating that they never have to pay taxes again.
---
Except the cult of the mothman, were great, no problems here. We have koolaid.
---
And knives.
---
Just take a look at some of the comments here lol, it's just whales and stockholm syndrome victims.
---
Like I said, in a few days its gonna be like nothing happened, the damage control it's in full effect, i dont think even pete hines is gonna comment on his statement, we are not in the justification stage, we just finished the acceptance stage lmao.
---
like for real I came back after I stopped playing after the release of nuclear winter and the game still is unstable as fuck, the framerate still is all over the place, and the only new content is some half assed raid that barely works, and yet, people defends it, of fucking course the whales that make the 70% of the playerbase are defending the fucking subscription, the mental gymnastics they to through to defend the state of the game is hilarious.
---
Yeah had that today. The request is there, it just doesn’t show. After I sent them a request it counted as accepting and we became friends. Still really dumb.
---
Dude idgaf about your fucking opinion on a game you don't play
---
You can grind 100% AFK in GTA. You can leave your PC on overnight or while at work or even while doing other shit at home, and your character will make millions.
---
Also lamp
---
Have a nice day :)

I wouldn’t even waste the time on the Halloween event, personally. I agree with what you said, it’ll lose support quickly. I give it a couple years, Wastelanders *might* bring some people back, but then what? There’s a small chance that will even be good and worth any time. I guarantee it’ll be an excuse to monetize more and surely by then any sane people left will duce it, game won’t be making enough money, Bethesda will kill it
---
And more weapon skins! Wtf? Such an easy thing to capitalize on.
---
Yea. but i agree that just coming out with a $30-$60 dlc would be a more honest way of doing things, but i dont think the fo76 community would be any less butthurt (and i use the term "butthurt" in the nicest way possible, especially since i was one of these people)
---
I guess you could say it was the straw that broke the camel's back. Been following the subreddit for some time, been a Fallout fan since 3. Didn't play much of 76 until months after its release. I don't think I trashed it as much as I pointed out some shortcomings you don't commonly see with other games with private servers but appreciate the feedback and hope to be more active on the sub!
---
I was referring to the single player game because I haven't played Online in years (I played maybe 6 months after the game came out).
---
I'm angry at Bethesda for being scum, and I'm angry at people like you who chose to reward them for it. 
---
I'm angry at every one of you for rendering our criticism and anger null with your wallets. After everything they did. You still happily toss money at them to fix a problem they created, just to force you to pay them to fix it. Just to make this broken mess of a game slightly easier for you. You're like the Trump supporters of gaming. They can do anything they want and you'll still thank them.
---
This is the kind of thing we all should have come together to oppose, but enough self-centered gamers out there don't care as long as the money is in their pockets. You helped make this game worse by telling this company that they can exploit us. For fuck's sake, they used a New Vegas outfit. They have barely mentioned NV since it launched. They've refused to include the game's lore in anything they produce. But they knew this was such a stupid idea, that they pulled out this beloved iconic set just to tempt fans. They straight up exploited their fanbase. 
---
So yeah prepare to take some heat.
---
If you don't like that? Don't engage people publicly. If you aren't prepared for some push back stop posting in public.
---
Listen, there's literal tons of industrial grade abraxo cleaner out there. And plenty of surviving Mr handys.
---
Seems to be a reddit problem because it has been happening in several subreddits.  Not just the ones I expect to happen in
---
Random disconnects is part and parcel for fallout 76
---
I downloaded it again a few weeks ago and installed it and was playing it daily to do daily quests for the backpack mod and then they pull this shit, while the game is still crashing. So people need to be aware what has happened here, and good thing there are "millions of players" according to Todd, who have quit the game since release, and will be spreading  that bad word of mouth for years to come.
---
ok I get it people are mad about the subscription fee, but elaborate for me plz what exactly is pay to WIN about fallout first...ok I can store more junk now and I have some new  emotes and skins. Oooooo wait player icons too. Explain to me how THAT will help me win in pvp, or for that matter how it can help me do more damage to any creature in game. Explain how fallout 1st helps me beat queen, or Encrypted.. That is exactly the point.. fallout 1st is not pay to win its pay for convenience... I believe you weapons will appear in atom shop though, however not legendary prolly utility weapons from prev fallout games like the repellent stick, the mesmatron, or Euclid's C finder.. IF or WHEN they do that, THEN people can complain about pay to WIN. The fallout community is literally the most self entitled, whiny community i'v ever heard.. play the game... or don't bet all of you who are screaming still have 150to300 plus hours played on a 60 dollar game so gtfo of here with all this pay to win nonsense
---
Mostly showing but open to good trades or offers I cant refuse. Feel free to shoot me an offer via pm
---
^(/s)
---
I just started TOW today. Runs smooth as heck, not to mention that there's so many ways you can set up your character and every decision you make has impact, meaning the replayability of this game is through the roof.
---
Whereas two days ago, the Mr. Messenger event I joined ended up failing because it was endlessly spawning level 62 charred feral ghouls that were *all* being bullet sponges, regularly would smack you from fifty feet away, and who take you out in only a few hits, even though you're almost level 100 and your armor and weapons are pretty damn good. Combine that with busted pathing and I spent a bunch of bullets for nothing. This was all after it took multiple attempts just to get into a server.
---
I'd consider it. PM me
---
Shoot me a pm
---
.50 cal rifle is my God bless from this game. Long range night scope and I'll take a three star two shot anti armor with 50 percent reloading speed please
---
PM me
---
😂😂😂
---
Not gonna lie, I got fo76 for free when I bought a PS4 pro from JB hi-fi
---
You do realize that Bethesda supported the shit out of Obsidian during it's development.  Providing a ton of tech support. And the game still launched a buggy mess and is arguably still one of the buggest Fallout games in existence.
---
if you like ranged damage, you can look my answer about glass canon rifles, melee sure are strong, but get quickly boring sadly, and if you seek pure damage you can achieve almost the same DPStier  while being safer.
---
Cool story bro...
---
Triggered because someone bought something you don’t like or agree with... even though they bought it with their own money they earned... 
---
You want to harass and target people and not buy from them... ok... are you like 12 or something? 
---
It’s a game... posts like this is literally why people asked for the servers to begin with... toxic people who are mad at everything or anyone who holds a different opinion... wow...
---
Why? Literally anything they say will result in more people flipping out. Wait for the tantrums to stop before doing anything.
---
The flamer is almost identical to the 50 cal, only difference is its durability is trash and the clip size is 150. Obviously it does energy damage and sometimes corpses will catch on fire when they die. 
---
I haven't played since the patch and this BS business practices so I don't know if it's been fixed, but I do have a Plsama Gatling and can tell you it's pretty broken OP with Beam Splitter, works best at medium range because the spread is huge.
---
This sub has put up with more bullshit than any I know. Don’t act like this shit is even remotely uncalled for.
---
But, we like what they’re offering.
---
&gt; if you aren’t prepared for some push back stop posting in public
---
But, I am prepared, so I am. 
---
Why should I “come together to oppose” something that I enjoy and appreciate? 
---
- Price-wise it’s cheaper than many other forms of entertainment I could spend time on
---
- It’s part of a game series I’ve enjoyed enough to be part of the mod creation community for around a decade
---
- It helps me enjoy the game more
---
- It’s a similar price point to other online games like Elder Scrolls 
---
- I can afford it
---
Your inability to recognize that there are other opinions out there is boxing you into black-and-white thinking about how you believe the company should be running their business without recognizing that the gaming community is wide and diverse.
---
If you can’t brook criticism and can’t imagine other people holding different opinions, the discussion isn’t going to go well.
---
Go complain to Bethesda, vote with your wallet, and stop telling me how I should vote.
---
Fallout 4 wasnt a great game at all. Its objectively the worst modern fallout game, before f76 was released ofc
---
I've been telling myself the same thing but I quit playing a long time ago. They did not gave me any good reason yet to give it a new try.
---
Wastelanders is the only update that, by it's promises, might be able to bring me back. But, ill be honest, if there is any type of paywall behind that update (if it ever comes) my chances of coming back are pretty much non-existent.
---
I’m in a server right now where 2/3 of the population of the FULL server is level 21 or less. Most of the players also have the Fallout1st icons or items in their bases. This is the pattern I see every day, with the only real variation being player levels. Roughly half of the players on every time I log in have paid for the content. 
---
While Reddit is very loud, it’s very much the minority. 
---
You may not think it’s worth it but it seems like a lot of people that are actually playing the game do. It’s really none of your business how others spend their money. That would be like me chastising you for buying a soda.
---
You got downvotes for saying pvp haha this sub sucks
---
Agreed.
---
Here let me report a bug: Fallout 76.
---
A paid service much like and almost identical ESO plus... plus numerous other premium memberships so it’s literally nothing new at all, doesn’t effect anyone’s game play at all and this broke you? REALLY? 
---
How exactly did it break you? If it did the real world must be scary as all hell for you! 
---
Again it’s a game...
---
Holy shit.  Quit.  Stop positing about the game.  Stop giving it news articles.  Quit.  You MUST have something better to do in your life.  Good God people.
---
Lmao.
---
Oh shit i just realized your on xbox im on ps4 lol mustnt of read your post properly
---
To be fair all he did was an angry emote which if it was me I would’ve thought it was a cute friendly way to show disappointment, to which I probably would’ve forgotten about a few seconds after
---
But why do that when they can whine on Reddit and blame everyone that paid for it, as if Bethesda would just suddenly make it free if we allll just stuck together like a good little group of lemmings?
---
The same thing was said about the fridge and collectron when the repair and scrap kits came out, yet here we are, "insane" and able to remind you that "we told you so."
---
 u/Jon_Blue posted this OP a few days ago:

---
I went through part of his video and made some of the changes he suggested. Not done with reviewing all he posted but he seems on the right track.
---
- Please copy and paste or link to where in the ToS it says you cannot have more than one reddit account? As far as I'm aware and a google search shows you are only not allowed to use another account to get around a permeant ban or the like.  So let's not go spreading misinformation yeah?
---
- Why is this my "main account" and who are you to tell me what is and isn't? No shit everyone's post history is public lmao 
---
- Yeah I forgot we still live in the dark ages and there's NO WAY like it's literally impossible that unless you've physically played a game for a long period it's impossible for you to have any information on it. Shit you're right! How could I forget that? 
---
- Yeah because "TLDR supporting Bethesda's extremely hungry MTX will hurt future games" is purely just to "provoke the mob" because a video game publisher has NEVERRRR looked at another games monetization and gone "shit let's use that too!" Lmao like do you seriously know nothing about the gaming industry and it's history?? 
---
- NEWSFLASH! The "AAA" gaming industry is dying under a model they cannot possibly sustain long term without nickle and diming every possible aspect of a game with even that having an expiration date. There's been more high profile "AAA" launch failures and controversies in the last few years than the whole last decade. Most "AAA" games have blurred together as all the publishers race to pump out their next "Liveeee Serviceeee" open world multiplayer game and a glacier moved faster than most of them have innovated lately. A lower tier AA game developer like Obsidian can put out a better and more creative game than any of these companies with their billions of dollars. 
---
Honestly you just come across as a very young closed minded and uninformed troll who's just attention seeking and trying to argue for the sake of arguing. Your entire "argument" boils down to "HURR DUHRR YOU HAVENT PLAYED IN A FEW MONTHS BUT I HAVE SO I KNOW ALL JUST LIKE YOU HAVE TO HAVE LIVED HISTORY TO KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT IT LOLOLOL" it's actually pathetic. Maybe take some economics and business classes when you get older so you can understand how it works. 
---
Have a good life 👍🏻
---
That's because he still plays, he has a lvl 400 toon
---
Just like how I triggered him with a single emote and how I have a decision to spend my caps like how he spends his money. And to clarify I already fast traveled over there by mistake, I didn't go there just to protest at him. And if anything he started targeting me, he pulled up my name and actually messaged me. 
---
Not only that but most of the FO76 community is good people sure you get a few buttholes but otherwise it's a good community. I asked for Private servers back in 2018 because I thought it was going to be a rust-like experience.  Now I can freely go into games knowing most people are nice. Heck even in areas where there is pvp like workshop captures, no one will contest you most often times.
---
Like I said I don't mean any real toxic harm to the players but I just don't want to support anything that has to do with Fallout 1st. If you don't like that fine, call me what you want you're entitled to your opinion.
---
That's for me to decide. Just like it's your decision to not buy it. The difference, however, is we're not being jerks about it.
---
That’s an awfully specific variety of sci-if post-apocalypse. Looks like you’ll have no where else to go. It’s up to you how you spend your money, we don’t want these practices to become normal but I’m sure many of us hope you’re getting your money’s worth
---
Then I feel really bad for all of us gamers in the future 😔
---
I was just thinking a goty edition would probably include whatever dlc and expansions get made for it. And this is definitely a game that could use some follow-up story expansions. For that I would definitely pay $60. Just not the game now.
---
This “dirt cheap subscription” costs more in a year than what my Xbox live subscription costs.
---
So while I am worried about the goal posts of in-game purchases being pushed further back, there is no excuse for a game developer to offer a paid subscription model for features that have been asked for since launch from a developer that have gone on record to say that every single patch, dlc and update for this game will be free! 
---
So the goal posts can get smoked all the way off. That’s not what the angst of this player base is about. Anyone with half a cent worth of common sense knows there will always be someone who will spend the money. 
---
There are right ways, and wrong ways, to monetize your property while also improving the quality of your game. Battlefront 2 being the most current example I feel is relevant for the right way. No Mans Sky is another. 
---
Bethesda has taken several steps back with this horse crap. So much potential in this game and they decide to focus on this? It’s rancid.
---
Good for you man, I’m glad to see you’re enjoying yourself.
---
Now get ready for this sub to shit on you for it
---
You aren't influencing them, your ego is too big to understand that your Reddit account isn't being read by Bethesda. Coming here and pretending to be the hero of the industry by shedding light on the injustices facing *gamers*? Fucking cringe and wildly egotistical
---
What I’m arguing is the first statement, not the others. I’m not saying this is the only type of games I play. I’m saying that 76 is indeed unique and non-replaceable.
---
I'm not mad at them, I'm mad that Bethesda hasn't bothered to make the game worth subscribing to.
---
I personally think they should have made the game F2P as they launched 1st, but given everyone who had all ready bought the game credit towards 3months to half a year of servers (I think a year would be fair but they wouldn’t give that).  I also think 1st should of been closer to 50 a year, not 100.
---
The reason being this game needs to get new people to play if it’s going to a cash shop/optional sub model.  With the current state of the game’s reputation not many people will take a shot at it, but if it went f2p they would.  More people playing, even if they are f2p, means more money in the cash shop.  For those who owned the game and got free months of 1st use, they would be able to get people they know to try it out in a f2p model and this may make people pay for 1st.
---
Anyway I predict this game will go f2p soon, and the cost of 1st will be cut close to 50 bucks in a few months(by Black Friday). The shit storm they started with the state of 1st, delaying wastelanders, and the overall bad rep of the game has assured it.
---
Yeah
---
Bethesda is owned by Zenimax.  Zenimax has sold a huge stake to some equity company for millions of dollars in capital (like 450million ish or so).  That company is shopping around to sell that stake and Zenimax is stopping that from happening by promising EXPECTED AND CONSISTENT PROFITS.  So...  Bethesda promises only cosmetics and no pay to win.  But some minor utility items are put in Atom Store at Zenimax insistence and they sell like hot cakes (regardless of backlash in the subreddit).  Zenimax says "holy crap, more of that please, right now" and Bethesda has to keep ramping up more P2W stuff that keeps selling, that keeps showing EXPECTED AND CONSISTENT PROFITS.  Finally Bethesda is about to release Wastelanders and secretly the Fallout 1st subscription with it (on strict orders from Zenimax, to bring in that juicy expected and consistent profits to show their stake holder) but Bethesda realizes Wastelanders is not ready and will be panned by critics and fans alike if released as is.  Problem is, promises have been made and Fallout 1st HAS TO RELEASE on this deadline even if Wastelanders is delayed.  So... we get Fallout 1st alone which blows everyones minds, in a very strange and stick-out-like-a-sore-thumb way, while Wastelanders is delayed.
---
This is not my theory, watch the Juicehead video.  It fits very well and makes a lot of sense.  Explains a lot of why things have been the way they have been, and what to expect for the future of this game.  Anyone that has worked, or does work, for a large corporation will surely see how this can go and why it's going like it's going.  I have and I'm no longer really surprised at the events unfolding.  Anyways, it sucks but this game is what it is.  Just got to enjoy it how we can until the next thing comes out.
---
I've been noticing crashes/lag since about November 14th 2018 or so
---
I’m not your guy, buddy.
---
It’s a decline in the accessibility of games to the average person and the death of the DLC packs of old ^edit That’s bad to a lot of us and terrible for others. Things aren’t just more expensive but we also get smaller returns and a lot of us can’t afford it. We bought into this expecting what they described it as and it’s become something very different. Griping is all we’ve got
---
The edgy "you guys are all negative overreacting bro" attitude is what allows these companies to continue their practices.
---
Yep - I got it for $48 aud   ( Amazon AU ) back in December 2018 and I'm 1200 hrs in.
---
And I bought one month  to try it out.  Not everyone in this sub is walking around with the ass out of their pants.
---
If you can't afford it or think it's too expensive then don't buy it. It's good that I'm not having to watch my back all the time or running into someone having a bad day.
---
Studies done (in particular with politics) is that it will have the opposite effect. Attacking the game (and people who play it and even buy some of the items) will only further the resolve of those people.
---
And you don't play dailies for the backpack you fucking twat, don't pretend like you belong here
---
If I have good luck and depending on 2x money events I can make close to a mil an hour no glitches. Import export is really easy money if you're good at driving. And with that I can buy almost nothing that is good in comparison to what I have already. Being endgame sucks in gta cause it gets boring really fast
---
I keep it installed because I have a couple friends that still play it, but even they aren't playing as much as they used to. I also like to log in and grab the free stuff from the Atom Shop and then wander around the store to see what I'd spend actual money to get if this game was finally stable and not putting advantages behind a pay wall. On occasion, someone posts on Reddit about looking for a plan or needing help with a mission and I'll help them out. Other than that, I've spent more time on Fallout 4 recently than I have on 76 and today I started Outer Worlds as well.
---
Dickhead.
---
Great details in your post that illustrate exactly why I had my suspicions.  Can I prove any of it? No, but seeing how Todd, Pete and the rest basically say whatever the hell they want I guess I can do they same.
---
"Millions" of people who are upset about this will be voting with their wallets. THAT will be influencing Bethesda. See you think we can't change anything, but we are already changing things, as the greedy companies have to be greedier and greedier to make money, and the idiots who keep buying them are the ones who suffer that, not the ones who stop buying them. We are buying and playing good games, by good developers, while the idiots keep eating shit that the companies like EA, Activison, and Bethesda shovel down their throats.
---
They just wanted to be left alone. How is that evil? No one is obligated to help others. If they have a way of running things, how is that bad?
---
I can switch to other games, and that’s alright. But the first statement is false because the atmosphere, art style and theme, these basic components of a game is unique to 76. And the feeling I got from them is nowhere to find in other video games, that’s why I said it’s unique. And again, this depends. For example if you like space exploration sci-fi with realistic theme, then you go to elite dangerous or Star Citizen. What the first statement sounds like, is that it is subjective, which is totally false because it depends.
---
Well several months ago they ended griefing in a way so they can't kill or destroy your camp you unless you shoot back. Now you don't lose junk when in an event. It's pretty much like a private server
---
Unless you want to go to jail, nothing
---
Agreed, a line in the sand has been crossed.
---
Yeah I got mine at JB as well and actually got cash back haven't played it since like January though
---
What an idiot you are. You get Possum badges from 2 dailies. And the Campfire Tales event. Seems like this person who "doesn't play" knows more about the game than you.
---
That is why I didn't call them evil. Just ass holes.  There is a difference.
---
We care about the game, which is *why* we comment on it, because we want it to be better. We want Bethesda to do better.
---
I probably have more hours in the game and know more about it than you pathetic shills.
---
FACT:  You don't really understand what "P2W" or "Pay To Win" means in the context of video games in 2019.  It does not literally mean you are paying money to WIN the game, which then of course prompts the discussion of what is winning, or can you even win the game.  
---
Googling the term shows this definition at the very top:  "a situation where the player can buy in-game content or in-game changes, with real money, that give the player a gameplay advantage or advance the player gameplaywise."
---
This is most certainly happening with this game, a FACT you can try to deny but is obvious to everyone regardless if they admit it.
---
Nah, they understand.  But let's be rational, if you're gaming in an online "service" game today, you're going to get hit with mtx.    Maybe those "shills" didn't buy lies in the first place and expected this going into the game. Maybe those shills can separate marketing from the current reality quicker than you.
---
That's what these hate mongers do best, and it sickens me. Let someone enjoy the game, without having to be an asshole to them for it. I really enjoy the game, and could give a shit less what others have to say to me about it.
---
If you bothered to read the post, like a mature adult, you'd have noticed that I was SPECIFICALLY talking about the "AAA" industry. The industry that right now is an apocalyptic wasteland of "LIVEEEE SERVICEEEE" open world games and broken high profile failures and controversies. Most "AAA" studioes are creatively bankrupt and a glacier moves faster than they innovate. Thankfully the "AA" and indie game devs are picking up the slack and putting out some fantastic very creative games but it's pretty scary when they can make better products than these companies with 100000x their resources and budgets. Many high profile "AAA" game developers have lost their standing and put out absolute shovel-ware such as Bioware and Bethesda or just turned all of their IP's into copy and pasted versions of the same games such as Ubisoft all in the name of profit. Let's not even get started on the completely bastardization of the sports game genre or series like call of duty. 
---
You're right though video games are more accessible and consumed, in a better world that would have translated into better games. The "AAA" industry cannot survive long term doing everything they can to chase higher profits each year to please shareholders because eventually they'll hit a wall. And that will be after they're charging us $5 to start a quest and $3 to start a dungeon. 
---
I sincerely suggest you learn a bit about economics, business and how capitalism works so you can better understand the problems. Nothing ever gets solved by people being ignorant. 
---
Oh and don't act childish towards someone especially when you don't even understand the subject matter. Thanks!
---
I never knew I needed a ball pit until now.
---
You can earn plan once per day, it will roll random set and give you plan for it, as long as none of your sets is completed plan is guaranteed, if let’s say you have all plans for solar and rng roll will be solar you will not get any plan even if other sets are not complete yet. 
---
It will not initiate pvp if your pacifist is on
---
Super fun
---
Getting off on that aren’t you... toxic...
---
I understand why they made it impossible to murder the shit out of people, rob them and loot their camps. I also understand that because of that they fucked it forever. 
---
I mean you can't even raid cause muh griefers
---
Battlefield is in nearly as bad a shape as FO76. After all the shit talk Dice did about to playerbase they're not getting another dime of my money.
---
If you actually wanted it you'd do the challenges, that's the most retarded way to get the backpack mods. Campfire tales was bugged when you claim to have been playing, no badges. You don't know Jack shit
---
&gt;they probably thought the atom shop would have been enough to get that extra revenue,
---
You know man, it's funny you say that, because most of the stuff they've put on the atom shop is some of the ugliest or dumbest outfits i've ever seen, hideous/stupid/pointless paint jobs with maybe 3 that don't make your power armor look like ass, etc.
---
99% of it, nobody asked for. I mean, shit, if that was their 'best' then *maybe they need to have a talk with the people who design the cosmetics*: Woodsman outfit? Cryptid enthusiast? Moe the fucking Mole? **I wouldn't wear that shit even if it was free, much less pay money/atoms for them.** the best thing they've put out is easily the new ranger outfit, which is just copied from another game with minor tweaks.
---
I could mosey over to FO4, look at the highest rated outfits, and holy shit, every single goddamn one fits the fallout universe, and actually look good.
---
I get it, they need revenue because this game is continually supported. But they have no excuse for putting so much ugly trash in the cosmetics shop for a fucking year when any asshole could mosey over to the fallout 4 mods and see the type of shit people might actually pay money for. Like i said, i wouldn't wear most of that stuff if it was free and unlockable in-game.
---
Also outfits without some kind of gloves fucking suck, including the ones like the Elder's jacket which mysteriously had gloves removed.
---
The hands are poorly digitized and i'm tired of seeing them. There, I said it.
---
TLDR: predominantly ass ugly cosmetics cannot support continuing development, apparently too complicated an idea for Bethesda to fathom.
---
You don't know shit.
---
... Im disgusted to see after this continuous shitshow, that you're still offering suggestions to them about things they can monetize....
---
Legit, if your buying this subscription, then your the one of the reasons gaming is becoming this mess. It’s your fault for proving to them people will pay.
---
When the 90s? Yeah we evolved well past that, those were games to pass time when there wasnt much else.
---
And nah it’s not a better game from everything I’ve heard
---
Go wait on your Google news feed for the next kotaku article that points you to your new battle fucking tool
---
My two cents... I think that this was a bold experiment on Beths part. Could they sell a game with zero npcs that’s only multiplayer? The game did feel incomplete but that’s because there’s only so much story telling that can be done with robots holos and notes. I know of so many people that don’t read notes, don’t listen to holos, and just click as quickly through as possible. That’s the experiment. 
---
When everyone got on to the main game and found it completely devoid of NPC’s, just robots, they made it known that it was a critical error. My thoughts here? Beth had to go back to drawing board when they got back from vacation 01/2019, and had to fill in and create a backstory / place for npcs. Or perhaps even earlier than that, they knew the writing was on the wall. 
---
Think about wastelanders, or at least what we know of it. The raiders vs the common people because of treasure of some sort in vault 79? That seems.... flimsy at best to me. So we have a half ass story. 
---
Now for the other half of it; the logistics. They need to integrate all these npcs into the game. Not just in certain parts, but everywhere. They need to figure out random encounters. Throw in Easter eggs. Call backs. Call forwards. They have to work in branching story lines. Have to record a metric shit ton of dialogue and a metric shit ton of writing for those voice actors. They need to make sure things are lived in. They have to create towns and places and events around having potential companions and doing raids. They figure out a new work around called Instancing, basically what they do in vault 94. They have to figure out basically how to retool this entire freaking game in a matter of a year. That alone is a tall order. I’m not surprised at all that they have delayed it, considering the vast undertaking that it is.
---
Your main post creates a Strawman argument which is a logical fallacy, and then you try to argue that Strawman against anyone responding.  Do you feel like you've "won" your argument?  Can you even ever "win" this argument if you don't really allow anyone a fair chance to "win" against you?  Anyways, it's overall a bit of a shit deal, this Fallout 1st, and you know it.  You don't need to flex on others just because you know it's crap but you like it and it annoys you that others think less of you for it.  They are just internet randos.
---
That's my experience also - it's a different dynamic and I'm already 1200 hrs into the game. It's like the pressure is off.
---
Don't have to watch your back all the time checking where other players are. All the events are just for you when you feel like doing them.
---
Yikes you got a bit roasted there friend. But yeah good troll comment!
---
Big brain time....i don't have to pay for private serverw when no one plays the game.
---
&gt;also carrying a portable fuel tank
---
For... reasons
---
I am already feeling the anxiety build up from just looking at all that clutter,  great job!
---
I got to agree, I bot a month of it for the armor and atoms, but $12 dollars a month is more than I can justify spending on it for more than one month. I don't really have a problem with the service or anything, I just think the price is a little too much.
---
People have made WoW servers, they have made Star Wars Galaxies servers, and they can make Fallout 76 servers too. And there's no fear of reprisal. Just do it and release it on torrent download. We paid for the game, so we should be able to play it offline, or however we want.
---
It's really the only good and moderate response.  We accept this game for what it is, lower our expectations and play and enjoy what we can in it.  And if we can't enjoy it we stop playing it.  And if it starts to look like FO5 and the rest are going to be similar, then we skip buying those and look elsewhere for our fun.
---
Dick-loadable content
---
Why? The only way shit changes or gets better is by making noise? Why don't YOU stop looking at it or commenting about it? Surely YOU must have something better to do with your life??
---
There are plenty of doubles. I put the first one of any skill I find on the stand, then use the doubles.
---
You're acting like a $8.33 a month, is some crazy amount of money to pay. It's less than I pay for Spotify/Hulu/netflix/prime/philo.
---
You're delusional, if you think you have some control over how anybody spends their money. I don't really care about your "feels", you can keep that to yourself.
---
Have you seen the America in Fallout? Its like this weird blend of fascist authoritarian government, and ultra-capitalist corporations. It makes complete sense that the Free States would want to secede from the U.S. I mean their flag is literally a blue anarchist star.
---
You’re enjoying yourself correct? Then it doesn’t matter what anyone else thinks... enjoy yourself and be happy... too easy. 
---
Glad you’re having fun!
---
This post says it has 7 comments, but I only see 2.
---
Could be a bug, or lag, or pixies, or mods or maybe I can't count.
---
I see where you’re coming from and I genuinely hope it keeps being something you enjoy. I haven’t full given up on it yet my self but I’m definitely worried.  See you out there I guess lol
---
Rust.
---
I consider toxic to be loud, annoying, constantly harrassing, and trying to start pvp and even inflicting irl trauma. All I did was emote once. That's it. Cumulatively it must be harsh for him.
---
I'll admit that emote was out there but I was angry. I felt that people like this are the reason why we're here. Constantly defending the service with excuses of how one spends their money, how it's optional, or that I could just leave. But these are perks we could've gotten for free and still want to have a good future for this game. One that isn't where someone can pay for advantages like this. Imagine if they charged us for the Backpack all those months ago.
---
I'm passionate for this game getting better and when I see that Fallout First logo I'm just overcome with where the state of this game is going. I'm sorry if you dislike the way I feel but I don't mean to be overly aggressive about it. I just want things back to the way they were.
---
So you're saying DLC is just like a sub fee? That's your argument lmao?
---
Did you read my first comment? About the game theme? I have played rust but I watch several vids. Seems completely different from Fallout
---
I have a commando build. I run vampires explosive handmade and a Furious handmade. 
---
Sneaking and and critical I can hit in the 300s. I feel like I hit between 75 and 200 for most hits in general combat
---
With my instigating handmade I've seen in the 700s.
---
Headshots on the queen I get up to 55 per shot.
---
Oh yeah huh. The upgraded one right?
---
This is...my dream camp. I’m in love.
---
Anti-Armor Two shot cannot happen, both modifiers are prefix's that only appear in slot 1.  AAExplosive, TSE, or adding on 50% limb damage is pretty good for a hunting rifle.  Faster Reload legendary modifier is also 15% iirc.
---
I liked Ark my self but I don’t have that kind of time and getting wiped sucks so much after the 20th time and it never stops happening only less often
---
I'll bash Bethesda, but only because they mostly stocked the atom store with some of the ugliest cosmetics i've ever seen, shit i wouldn't wear if it was part of the game and free, and then were somehow surprised when atom store sales sucked ass.
---
I can't handle criticism? You started this whole conversation because you can't handle people telling you, you're fucking things up for everyone.
---
I don't really care what your reasons are. They all boil down to being short sighted. You are making things worse. You've helped create a nice fat divide between players and rewarded Bethesda for being bad, even if you can't see it. You only care about your own enjoyment. 
---
You just don't give a shit. And that kind of apathy is what Bethesda is banking on. Why come together? Because maybe we could have made a difference and you could have gotten this stuff for FREE! The way you should have. But there is no helping someone who wants to be scammed. So I'm done talking to you. You'll understand eventually. Maybe. Either way I'm done wasting my time on you.
---
Spend your money however you like, just don't pretend you're beyond reproach just because you paid for something you enjoy. It affects the rest of us, and the industry.
---
Some missions will occassionally spawn in an overkill amount of enemies.
---
Once did bots on parade event. Had one enemy. Next time I had to kill 34.  And the amount of enemies is a mission marker so im able to see the difference. This is on public servers as well.
---
Wow this was hilarious lmao
---
Comment 1: This sub is full of people in abusive relationships defending Bethesda
---
Your comment: I'm defending Bethesda because I can't figure out I'm in an abusive relationship!
---
I'd feel bad for you if it wasn't so classic lol
---
No.  Because if no one talks about the game no one will know about the game if it's combined with not playing.  It's that simple. If all you sweaties logged off and got a hobby instead of shit posting threats like a bunch of nerds I guarantee change would happen. 
---
Instead you make these stupid thinnly veiled posts and then proceed to log back on. 
---
Shut up and grow a pair.
---
Dude...
---
Yep that mask provides the air filter effect without perception loss.
---
Unfortunately lots of people are unintelligent enough to pay for it and it's going to set a dangerous standard for other games in the future.
---
You got downvoted but you aren't wrong.
---
It's not that easy though. If this is at all a success it's going to hurt more than just 76.
---
I see where people are coming from when they say it gives you an unfair advantage, but any advantage you get from it is going to be so minuscule that it will make barely any difference in the long run.
---
I feel sorry for you. But I understand there are people in this world that will gladly take the abuse and will even pay for it.
---
Except that paid DLC for online multiplayer games only really works for things like map expansions, where you can just lock those that dont buy from going to that area. If youre going to have DLC like wastelanders that alters in game space shared with the base game map and add new items like weapons and armor that have new effects/stats/ect, then you cant make those paid bc then it really would make it Pay to Win like everyone seems to think it is right now. Paid private servers are not a new concept, many other games as a service (yes even full priced AAA games) have done them that way. Its not to say if FO76 made more money from initial game sales and had a stronger player base to support the game through cosmetic mtx then they could of included a free form of private servers or at least a cheaper version but thats not the reality. 
---
The reality is that if anyone, not just fallout1st players, want to continue to play the game and get any sort of continued post launch content, the game needs to make money. I dont think ESO is a good model to compare this game to when trying to answer that ‘How’ tho. It has a much higher playerbase that supports the game thru buying mtx and subscriptions and is generally well received in the mmo community. But the region locked DLC model really forces ppl to pay steep mtx prices or sub monthly to the game for a game that yes, many bought full price as well. But where fo76 offers a generous amount of ingame mtx currency for the ‘base game only’ players, eso does not. Ive had eso since launch on console and still hav only 600 crowns from the start, barely enough for a pet. Login rewards are nice but far and few between are they ever good and the cosmetics are prechosen for everyone so not nearly as good as getting the currency to pick your own. 
---
I still enjoy eso and i still enjoy fo76 (when the bugs dont frustrate me that is) but I, personally, wpuld not luke to see fo76 adopt the eso DLC model. Not only does it actually backtrack on their initial promises pre release (a big reason i bought into it) but it just wouldnt work at this stage in the games life. The playerbase and consumer opinion of the game just isnt high enough to make that transition without killing the game. And then everybody loses. The ppl that buy fallout1st and the ppl “protesting bethesda” by personally insulting those that buy it. The only ones that win are those that wanted the game to fail when it was first announced. And if youre one of those ppl in this sub right now, all i gotta say is...why?
---
If there's assholes on both sides you're either an earthworm or you have some very unfortunate mutations.
---
You have embarrassed me Bethesda. I was encouraging my friends to give Fallout 76 another try because of all the patches and planned content. “It’s a different game now” I would tell them. Never again
---
Right!?
---
1.  P2W means to pay real money for an advantage or to advance in the game.  It doesn't necessarily mean you win the game.  Many mobile games are verify-ably P2W but when you pay you don't suddenly win the game.  It just moves you ahead in some way in the game, often ahead of those that didn't pay the money.
---
2.  I don't buy crack because I think it's bad and I don't like it.  I still think poorly of, and speak out against, crack dealers who obviously prey on people's nature.  You could replace the word "crack" with casino's or with sugar and corn syrup, or with anything peddled by a company that isn't great for people but that some people will still buy b/c they cannot help themselves, or just don't care.
---
3.  You are implying by this section combined with the title of your post that all people who are against FO 1st are making death threats.  That's not the case as you well know.  In which case how would people that are against FO 1st know why some idiots are making fucking death threats?  Your question is disingenuous.
---
Freemium only applies to F2P games with purchases. 76 is far from F2P, it's actually the opposite. It charges you a full AAA price and then gives you mobile games like features, with additional purchases that are far from cosmetics. It is the literal definition of despicable business.
---
Lmaoo 😂👌
---
Just stay away from my steps please
---
BE .50 is a BEAST! Best of the best. Cream of the crop. I mean mine does like 350-600 dmg per bullet when running bloodied.  One tiny bullet kills 90% of enemies on game. 
---
Using PA, emergency protocols, and dodgy is my GOTO tank build.  Yes I call it a tank build cause it’s tougher to die than you think. Perk and emergency culminates to a 80% damage reduction so long as you have AP.  So you only take 20% damage not even including DR/ER/Serendipity if you have it.
---
No, Rust is worse than Fallout 76
---
I guarantee that a good half of those you would (and should) be upset about. This sub goes from quoting the only cosmetics line to giving up basic QoL real quick
---
Eh, I'm not too concerned about what strangers on the internet say. Not a troll comment, a wasted attempt on my part at discussing the issue, when it's so much easier for the rage brigade to insult, and regurgitate the same talking points.
---
Its not a displayable item.  I tried.
---
General consensus is that it's a  *decent* game? The game got near perfect score or perfect score on most review platforms. Fallout 76 stands at around 20/100 everywhere. What exactly is your definition of a good game  then?
---
And what's ridiculous is you saying that I have no right to complain. Are you an actual idiot or what? Is Bethesda doing me a favor by letting me play? I paid for it, I have every right to complain if I feel like my money was not well spent.
---
I have the same problem. Its retro fallout setting combined with the music outfits and comical leniency is completely unmatched and has ruined me for almost every other game. Fallout 4 feels off since i have played fo76 and i kind of prefer a world scattered with people. Just not the pvp aspects.  I experienced and understand everyones frustrations and agree with pretty much all of it. But the game is still more fun then just about anything i play right now. Heck i rather like conan exiles for its sandbox building and find it to be the best out there. But i only play it 2 weeks at a shot every 3 months. This is the only series that holds replay value to me.
---
Its 2019....big surprise big companies making money of workers lol.
---
Or, you're just pissy little children.
---
It's too bad that you can't put it away when you're done. If you can I haven't figured out how.
---
80/20 rule. In sales it means 80% of your sales come from 20% of your clients.
---
I think what you are seeing is that Bethesda has decided to focus on the smaller group of players who actually cough up money. I'm not suggesting it's a good approach but I can't figure out why else they'd have the chutzpah to pull a move like this. The best thing about FO76 was (and still is) coop play.
---
Just FYI, PC Xbox pass is $5/month, first month is a buck. One dollar.
---
I am now playing Outer Worlds for four cents a day. Sally Struthers can't even feed a kid for that.
---
Well now we know why they made it an online only game. It's really hard to sell useless crap from a crappy store when people can just download mods with less bugs. This wouldn't be a big deal as I refunded the game on day 2 but they are making the new elder scrolls... And it's not looking good.
---
Thanks for the info! I’ve been running through the ski place by top the world but this would be a nice change of pace and I wouldn’t be running through a lot of ammo.
---
I’ve found that it’s much easier to play and enjoy what I can in it having spent only $10 on it.
---
Yeah that’s the build I have for the most part. By the way, serendipity doesn’t work in power armour. It doesn’t say so in the description and Bethesda never updated it.
---
Haha fair, just seems to be all I’m seeing. In reality, blaming your fellow gamers isn’t going to get anyone anywhere.
---
I guarantee that mods will be heavily limited and censored, not because of technical limitations of the game (although that will most likely be the reason given) but to make sure they absolutely in no way infringe on their ability to make money in the Atom Shop.  If you look at the mods for Fallout 4 (and most people wanting mods for FO76 played and modded the crap out of FO4 and so this is where their expectations are coming from ), the vast majority of those mods would take theoretical money out of Bethesda's pocket so would be a no-go.
---
Expect the modding ability they give us to be severely underwhelming unless they can make consistent money off of the mods people make and deploy.
---
It has for me on my ps4 at least.
---
That’s true enough.
---
Lmao. Inoperable.
---
3, I always tried to stick up for Bethesda’s choices, don’t really know how to defend this so I’m just taking a break till wastelanders comes out
---
1 as long as wastelanders is good, game will gtow
---
Thank you for the reply friend !
---
(X) Doubt
---
I agree that what Bethesda do is scumich, but i won’t say that video games are being killed.
---
We nearly removed lootboxes entirely of current games and future ones since it got so much backlash.
---
They now tests with subscriptions but i don’t see them lasting.
---
They will soon runs off of ideas to make peoples pays.
---
Good. Player-class traitors for encouraging this theft.
---
For someone who hasn’t posted in this sub for months, if at all?
---
Nah.  Just stop.
---
1.
---
So far OW has not crashed for me even one time.  Maybe I'm lucky, but there it is.  In any case, although it's good and scratches my traditional Fallout single-player itch, it is in no way shape or form a replacement for something like FO76 (or what I wanted FO76 to be).  In other words, I have always dreamed for a Fallout type game that I could play with friends and family, and FO76 is the only one that remotely lives up to that although in a very poorly managed way.  OW is not that at all, but what it is plays very well so far, definitely high quality.
---
It reminds me of Grandma’s! 
---
Beautiful and thank you for your hard work.
---
Why, may I ask is tenure a gatekeeper in this situation. I have played the game at launch then stopped soon after. I wanted to see what others (specifically in this sub reddit) thought! But hey thanks for the comment!
---
Yep. Been far more stable for me on Xbox, barring a few rough days.
---
U cannot make me
---
This is the best investment for a game in this state.
---
Your joy comes from how easy it becomes to explore and wander when you carry this tent system with you. Be careful, however, because that might shorten the game for you: the map becomes smaller when you don't need to go back home or crash at a train station. 
---
Good thing Is, no fast traveling to other people's camps. You are forced to walk, and that Is great. 
---
It's nasty and sad that you had to pay extra for it.
---
I love these kinds of camps. They really feel like something someone in the wasteland would live in
---
Yea I'm actually the poster child for freedom
---
&gt; Fallout 76 is not some unique, ground-breaking experience with no alternatives. Rust, Ark, No Man's Sky, and Minecraft offer similar experiences, not to mention better, more focused games that offer much more polished and focused aspects of 76 like Borderlands.
---
You're right. It's just as bugged as every other game they made, and yet when it was released we still bought it.
---
YES to all of the above.. more than happy to pay for all fancy camp stuff! camp building/decorating is my thing! bring it on! i would also like a nice selection of clean and symmetrical rugs.
---
Today was a bad day for me. Really sttutered during scorched earth and campfire tales.
---
We can not be friends... I’m on PC 😐
---
Wastelanders is the carrot, and the subscription is the stick.  But the carrot got delayed, and we only got the stick which was awkward.  Hopefully the carrot will be a big fat one.
---
It’s an extra incentive they didn’t have to give atoms just like they don’t have to reward atoms for challenges but ungrateful whiny bitches like you still complain.
---
You cry because you want everything free.  They offer a game for 60 bucks with free expansions with no sub with micro transactions in the beginning.  Entitled brats like you don’t buy atom so now they wonder how to keep the going.  
---
I guess clueless kids like you think the thousands of game instances just run by magic I guess.  You can’t even fathom what running this in a DataCenter looks like and the development costs.
---
It’s fine though I’m sure nothing in the posts even registers.  Maybe one day when you grow up you’ll understand. (You won’t)
---
Pretty sure it's an error, but we will see..
---
😁👍
---
Doesn't want people pissing in it
---
Not funny 😭
---
You sure are brave, parroting the same shit the entire sub says and pretending like it's not already the same opinion every one else already has.
---
I am discussing the problems, since patch 14 dropped. I didn't attack anyone.
---
And it's not only my opinion, hence we have multiple threads like this one.
---
Technically the quest gives us a code unique to each player. From what I understand it starts at the grafton pawn shop
---
It's so ugly though...
---
Kind of a prestige system for your character so you could reset with new and more powerful perk cards
---
Something is wrong with reddit right now so I will try to rewrite my thoughts as best I can.
---
I consider toxic to be worse that simple distaste or differing opinion. It would be nuking someones camp, following them where ever they go, waiting to start PvP, constantly trash talking along the way. I did a simple emote then left. Cumulatively it must be bad for him. Emoting may have been excessive but I was there and I was angry. I wouldn't have said anything had the guy not have messaged me then possibly attempted to capture my workshop.
---
I feel this way because people that buy this subscription are only going to make things worse for those that still try to play free after already buying the game. Everytime I am constantly shut down with how its optional, how you can't tell someone to spend their money or how I can simply leave.
---
Some of the perks from Fallout 1st are perks we could've gotten for free. Imagine if they charged us for the Backpack back in Wild Appalachia. I am passionate for this game getting better and whenever I see that Fallout 1st logo I see nothing of the sort, only that it may get worse. I'm sorry if you dislike the way I feel and I don't mean to be overly aggressive about it. I am trying to be as civil as possible right now and I'd really appreciate it if we can actually have a discussion rather than just call me toxic.
---
Remember shortly after the game released Bethesda had that like week long promotion that added about +10 health to the Unstoppables costumes?  And everyone freaked the fuck out and said that it was p2w and the beginning of a slippery slope that would shortly lead to an atom shop full of gear with stat boosts?  How did that end up again?
---
Lol maybe
---
Yes, purely for science...
---
Pistols are not BIS? What does that mean? =o
---
They have your money. They don't give  fuck about fixes.
---
BE Gatling plasma
---
Your post was removed...
---
The issue may be whatever that they believe it is,but the response by some coach customers  (non pay) are killing and hunting first-class customers (sub) is what I'm pointing out. And that it falls in the same line with the same ideology. Kill a first-class passenger cause you disagree with the fact that a first-class  option exist. Why only care if it effects a game when it is how almost every service provider offers. IRL
---
Well... You can go back to your private server. Bethesda has managed to bring the worst out of many of us.
---
I had to choose between griefing and quitting. I have been playing Fallout4 since 'First' came out. 
---
Don't like feeling like a second class citizen. They are using survival servers for this. I liked survival, and it was free.
---
Didnt it? Wasnt it just a journey to figure out what happened? I mean you end up finding out what each group went thru and their fight with the scorch plague and ultimately they all died because they couldnt/wouldnt band together to fight the plague.
---
I feel like I'm taking crazy pills when people talk about the story...for some reason people find it absolutely necessary to get quests from an NPC to validate the quest.
---
The first players have already made there choice to support Bethesda, they are the enemy now. Down with the rich DOWN WITH BETHESDA
---
Hilarious
---
It's the games "prestige" system to offer value for continuing to level up past 50.  The last they mentioned it the plan was that every 50 levels after that (100, 150, 200 etc) you earn a point toward picking from a selection of powerful legendary perks.
---
Relatively new to reddit but I received no notification saying it was and it still is showing up in my comments panel. Did a moderator do it?
---
Edit: Nevermind it was removed. Guess a mod did remove it.
---
Ok, name me a major patch to *this game* that didn’t cause even more serious bugs? Thats the point, you shouldn’t need to “hot fix” bugs introduced by a new patch. Presumably that was why you made a patch, to fix a bug. But we’ve been needing patches for each new patch. And not just a minor spelling error at a vendor. No, more like valued inventory items disappearing at random, getting stuck in power armor and needing to relog, plus the plethora of once or twice a day bugs that annoy the shit out of us every goddamned day. 
---
That’s probably the shitty netcode, the result of hotwiring ESO’s multiplayer to fallout 4. I’ve been here the entire time, playing, watching this unfold on MY SCREEN. And I’m tired. I’m not some asshat come to gloat “I knew it was garbage, you guys are dumb!”
---
I’m guessing at this point I’m talking to a dev throwaway, who may be fed up with the community, or management, or both. Stop making excuses for poor game testing. This is not the norm, this is the money-grubbing exception. Be mad at your company’s decisions, not us.
---
Ark is an even bigger mess than fo76...
---
I gathered all the fixes i know about on this video, I’m not sure if this will help you but maybe worth a shot: https://youtu.be/VMkq9XdC8lY
---
Would it of even mattered how big of an advanced warning they gave us? It's not like there'd be any less rage, would not have changed anything.
---
Oh good I thought I was going crazy I'm losing all kinds of posts.
---
Like you said says "x comments" but they are either not all there or in some cases none are. Or I'll get a message saying someone replied and I can see their reply in the message window but when I go to the thread the reply isn't there.
---
Just watched your video, and applied a lot. Game looks amazing, but I still have micro lag every now an then. But its far less noticeable. Thank you for sharing your knowledge.
---
I think I bought some stuff from your C.A.M.P today, feels weird to see this on Reddit
---
Lol dude that bridge has been crossed years ago. In no way, shape, or form has FO76 been the changing point...
---
i am supporting them in the hopes in that one day before Star Citizen comes out they will fix the game
---
/s
---
i like Solo private servers tho :-p
---
No idea... post doesn’t show any wording other than [removed] in brackets. 
---
A lot of have come here targeting those who got the 1st subscription, giving them grief for getting an in game item with their own money. 
---
This has been literally going on since the day it came out and I believe many are tired of it. 
---
Way too much negative comments and attacks overall.
---
Always happy to lend a hand

West Virginia is a tourist attraction i just got muh map from the CE guide today.
---
i still got to level up to get to the point where i can keel the thing and get the sweet sweet radiation shower blueprint.
---
Thx mate and sorry that i can’t help you more, only micro stutters i ever had were related to friend list
---
LET ME BACK IN!
---
I am aware. I just wanted to show my frustration with how this is getting out of hand without calling anyone out. It seems that I only antagonized myself despite me trying not to.
---
The irony is, in this time, you pay and you still lose. To anyone who has a brain - just don't even pay a dam nickel to Bethesda.
---
I just tried it. Same thing.
---
it just doesnt want to exist anymore :-p
---
Those are consumables, same with magazines
---
This cattle ain't paying for shit, unless things improve. They need profits to survive.
---
i like the private worlds :-p

Just today I had a mob "invisible" it would never go past the last tick if health and die, I got stuck in a mountain fast traveling to someone's camp, and mobs STILL bug where your first or even second hit do not register damage. 
---
Then I talked to a guy who said he bought it for the atoms. He loved building camps and I could see why he wants atoms, but in one year are you really going to use 18,000?! Even if you buy all that your camp budget won't allow you to build it all.
---
I added u
---
It’s very important to repost this every couple hours, no one here heard about fallout 1st
---
In a way it's worse because if your friends don't have it then you can't play together. Destiny was a terrible example. If people want to purchase the subscription then it's their choice what they do with the money.i like fallout 76 so if it's a reason they keep making updates for it then whatever. The internet loses thier s*it any time this game does anything and most of them act like little entitled children. Some people like the game and don't mind buying for it.
---
buy it for the mountain views.
---
if the damn robot venders didnt buy your stuff for so low.... see item value in inventory..........
---
ok heres 2 caps
---
TWO FUCKING CAPS!!!!!!!!
---
I noticed this on PC, the game ran perfectly for me up until this latest patch and I've been running into server crashes, frame drops, undefeatable enemies and regenerating health
---
From my experience they fix themselves after a while when you re-enter location, not perfect but better then original goo piles
---
I saw an estimate of over 1 million.digital copies if we round it up to 2 million I'm sure that's no where near what they expected nor would fund continual expansion
---
You don't have to have the subscription to play the game though.
---
It's a camp item, not object. So it doesn't go into a display slot. However you can place it inside the large display cases so it would look like a displayed Mr fuzzy
---
PS4 username vinsal4 here. Bit busy, but can lend a hand.
---
Why can't we hang pictures we've taken in our camps???
---
Yours might be the most persuasive argument I've seen about it. I'll admit, I only got the sub out of curiosity, and I'm not looking for some "big picture" behind it. If we could roll it back to how it was before all the MTX garbage, I would be right there with you. I also, unfortunately, don't think it's going to change.
---
Holy hell, thanks for the reasoned response,
---
16 times the bad decisions, more like.
---
Todd Howard: Fallout 76 Mod at work.
---
slowly changing all posts to "we love the game" 
---
/s 
---
btw i do actually live private worlds ;-)
---
You have the least Meta weapons as your mains so idk
---
Seems to me that they were doomsday preppers before the war, that banded together after they emerged from their bunkers. So it seems that they are morally ambiguous in my mind.
---
Ha ha, I came for the upside down comment. You did not disappoint.
---
Did you find out if you can?
---
I don’t know how people haven’t realized this yet but the games a dang money trap and Bethesda is going down the tube hard and fast as far as their games go. Quit playing this annoying scam and go play outer worlds! It’s on the Xbox game pass even on pc!
---
Also this sub is filled with Bethesda employees or bootlickers that rarely comment. Fo76 as a whole is such a disappointment. Thanks for the ugly death of my favorite series Bethesda. Seriously good job.
---
Yep atom price wise it makes sense, but no way in hell a paint color change on your armor is 1800 atoms worth. BTW, the new outfit looks like shit
---
I still can't even guess at why a person would still buy this. Are they just wanting to spend money on needless shit?
---
When you keep developing a game you have to keep paying the people to make it. These people don't work for free. This is how these type of games work. I'm not sure why people seemed to be so shocked. Their have been games like this for years.
---
Buy it, absolutely. Get to exploring. They did more environmental storytelling in this game than ANYTHING in the past. If you explore, you'll be rewarded.
---
Normally yes you are absolutely correct! And I add that I agree with you, only thing is though which is important to mention: Its a video game at the end of the day. The point I was trying to make is just imagine if humans decide to put their energies to things that matter. In the real world. We have sooooo many problems here on this planet that need fixin
---
Probably not. But I'm trying to see it from the view of someone doing the least amount of work for the most payoff.
---
&gt; bug reporting 
---
You must post a bug report every 2 minutes with this game LMAO
---
It's a deal if you consider price of atoms alone are justified, but they aren't either. 18 DOllars for a armor skin? Please
---
Why is everyone flipping out about this???
---
For australians it is NOT cheap for us its 22 a month and 180 a year
---
Pretty bold assumption that we will get content that was datamined in January within only 3-6 months
---
I've played over 200 hours of GTA V and never once touched GTA online.
---
I don't care how Rockstar monetizes GTA online, the game that I bought was worth well over $60, and I was never tempted to spend any extra money.
---
It will likely be a similar story with Red Dead 2.
---
If Fallout 76 was an online mode on Fallout 4, there would not be backlash. As long as the base game is worth the money, people are more forgiving about microtransactions in optional modes.
---
Agreed. I can't even imagine what the backlash would be like if they tried to do that.
---
No flipping out friend just asking a question.
---
Wild Appalachia LOL you call that content?
---
It's been known servers were going to cost
---
No destiny sucks. It's a small game and even the DLCs are very limited. I quit buying them after about the third one because it's still the same grind in their tiny world no matter. Bungies model locks out your friends to so unless you have friends willing to fork over 30 dollars every other month then you'll be seperated from them.
---
The entire sub is freaking out
---
I went on 2 servers hopping to all the camps that had shops. I found 4 people with scrap boxes out of maybe 12 camps. That's the minority, but a shit ton more than I expected!
---
I am aware. I just kind of wanted this to be my story on how Fallout first affected me without calling anyone out by name. Literally all the hot posts are people with the same outlook that this isn't a positive change.
---
Hey, remember this from 3 months ago?
---
It's been insane. I suggest following the Reddit status Twitter account, it's how I stay informed.
---
All the locations are tiny in comparison to the world in fallout 76. Destiny is a dumb game to compare to this if you are mad that games like this cost money.
---
Lol, look how this turned out.
---
It seems many people overlooked the point I was trying to make and like it was pointed out, GTA Online was a poor example. My whole point was there are games (leaving GTA Online out of this) that totally support their game on "Cosmetic only Microtransactions" and still offer a free private, invite only, or friends only play mode. 
---
They even said "Bethesda will be using the revenue generated through the sale of cosmetic Fallout 76 microtransactions to fund the development of DLC for the game. As a result, all of Fallout 76’s DLC will be free; “All the content we ever put out for Fallout 76,” explains Hines; “all the DLC, all the post-launch stuff, is going to be free. That’s important. And to say, the Atomic Shop is cosmetic stuff. To make sure folks understand. Look, there’s a line. There are people who have crossed it, but we’re going to stay on the right side of it in terms of the things you can spend money on and how this stuff works and what you’re getting for your $60. That you know, when they put out new content or features or whatever, I’m getting that stuff for free. That feels right.”
---
Source: https://www.vgr.com/fallout-76-microtransactions-hines/
---
It just seems like Everyone is overlooking the fact Pete Hines said "all the DLC, all the post-launch stuff, is going to be free. That’s important..." 
---
Not sure about everyone else, but $99 a year does not feel free. They talked about bring private mode for a while and then even last week, they said "It's coming next week!" After thinking back to Pete's quote, I would have never dreamed there would be a price tag associated with it. They never gave us a hint that it would be a Paid service with content you can only get from paying. Again, after he said all future content would be free.
---
Yes, but they are stupid and haven't put a complete block on communication or P.R. They're still posting images and advertisements to their Halloween event coming. So it looks even worse, like it's not a radio silence, but rather just ignoring the upset of the community.
---
A lot of them sincerely don't see the harm in it or think it's worth money. Or want to support Bethesda. It's scary.
---
By who. Who said they were going to cost the consumer
---
The problem is the general gamer oftentimes doesnt care. Fans of the sports EA makes games of have been complaining for years but they still go out and buy the lukewarm games every year because they want to play those games. The amount of any game's average playerbase that does not follow social media kf any kind for said game is often suprising. 
---
Remember the vocal minority is always louder than the submissive majority.
---
Oh? Can you point me towards the non MMO video game that tried to charge a sub fee for it's content then?
---
The internet is a toxic place, Reddit more so, and this subreddit even more than that. 
---
I don't understand it at all. If you really hate the game that much, uninstall and move on with your life.
---
That's going to be what the unused fourth and fifth star are for. greedy fucks. now there will be incredible weapons and armor that you can only get for money. it's over, we have been lied to repeatedly.
---
Bethesda can also see how much of a rift they created in their player base. They set out to make an evolving multiplayer fallout, now they have have and have nots who have to play in separate servers.
---
That is what you paid for
---
What?? Survival has been gone already
---
Everything is in the comments here.
---
I also overheard a conversation in the in-game chat where one guy claimed that you can open a support ticket asking for a refund due to dissatisfaction with the service. I didn't have the time to ask him whether he really tried it and whether it worked or not. One of the conversation participants said it's an obvious scam, but the first one said (and I find it reasonsble) that it's pretty legit to demand refunds for such reason.
---
That is all I know on topic atm.
---
Excuse me? Who the fuck are you to tell me what I do or don't do? Jesus this place is like hell on one hand I have idiots telling me I don't play the game so what I say doesn't matter and I have ridiculous fools like yourself telling me I do play the game. Lmao it would be funny if you guys weren't so sad. 
---
I don't play the game anymore. Haven't for ages. But good try troll.
---
Not if there are contracts in place surrounding the transaction. I'm kind of a laissez-fair Austrian school of thought kind of guy.
---
Why? They're both low sci-fi open world crafting survival games?
---
LMAO you are actually delusional.
---
Im with u.
---
Idc about 1st, will just plod along doing my thing. If ur dumb enough to support shady business practices then thats on u
---
Pretty sad that there are probably people inside that company using this very Reddit page to keep track of how bad the shitshow is.
---
Your complaint is no other game is a Co-op online open world adventure shooter game set in the exact same setting as Fallout? 
---
That seems pretty picky to me.
---
The problem being is: What is their motivation to BE better, to PRODUCE a better quality product?
---
There's enough apologists that continually line their pockets with cash that, while a failure in the eyes of most gamers, it'll still go down as a cash cow. Especially those with the mentality of "well, I already paid, and I want the full experience, so lets just tack more cash on eh?"
---
The sheer fact that, in this current (after so many debacles already) state of affairs where their $100/yr subscription is released broken (let alone that they had the gal to do this at all), and they hold almost no accountability for their actions (indeed even trying to turn it back on the gamers complaining at one point), they are STILL managing to rack in the money of the Sheep means they can botch ES6 and FO5, KNOWING they will again make money on a shit product.
---
Nope.
---
Bethesda isn't done. And won't be done until enough people stand up and proclaim they're tired of having a cactus shoved up their ass, and people DO something about it (such as stop putting money in their hands)
---
Nope, Golden Age Sci-fi is a typical genre, for example, Prey, Fallout and Bioshock. However when comes to open world RPG with building. Only Fallout now
---
Why is it ideal to subjugate every stranger on the world to your values and perception of appropriate discussion?
---
Rust with Fallout themed mods
---
Arma with Fallout themed mods.
---
It definitely makes it ferl like a more apocalyptic game where you could be the last man standing.
---
Should change the name to fallout last
---
No one gives a shit about the money. If that was the case what you're talking about would happen in every MMO with a sub fee or cash shop lmao. 
---
The ISSUE IS that the product that Bethesda wants to charge you for is not at all worth the asking price, consists of things the community have wanted since the start, bethesda lied up the ass and if the sub is at all a success other publishers may try the same thing. 
---
There is no "class" thing lmao and if thats what you think you must be pretty insecure about the topic.
---
That’s nice but all of those are time payments that you can’t rely on especially if the current forecasts for atom items are below expectations. People would just save free atoms and buy them
---
Is that last bit sarcasm?
---
1
---
Changing the UI color! So many people swap from the ugly green (myself included) in every other fallout but for whatever reason here we can’t.
---
Lmao wow, you're naive as fuck
---
Most mainstream software development studios. Back in the day if your software was not of value, people didn't pay for it or buy you out and your whole company tanked, solving the issue the old fashioned way.
---
These companies can keep getting away with this crap and no one bats an eyelid.
---
There are plenty of absolutely amazing things that Bethesda has accomplished. The fallout world has hilarious hidden messages and plenty of great scenes within it. But nobody wants this game to turn into a p2w mobile game. It ruins the quirky charm of the game.
---
3. Nothing will change.
---
I've definitely felt the change. Even on this Reddit. It's scarce
---
envious of the gullible.... I think not.
---
Ball pit need ball pit
---
Yeah very different. I still remember how the fallout fans lost their minds when they heard Bethesda is getting the license and it will be a FPS style game instead of isometric top-down.
---
No shit, these people are so damn phony. It was safe to be objective for a while but they all seem to have lost their nerve. Fanboys are washing back in.
---
Wow, that wall of text is just too much to read, you're hurting my head, you win. 
---
Hopefully you didn't sprain something typing that all out for no one to read it, I almost feel bad. Almost. 
---
Either way, I'll go on supporting FO76 and Bethesda,  you...do you.  
---
LMAO
---
I enjoy the 1st hunters. It's just a bunch of ass hats giving me all their caps while trying to kill me.
---
Any good spot to farm Laser Rifles for scrap? Or just tag all the bits and hope for the best?
---
Yeah it's called astroturfing. EA was caught doing it.
---
I couldn't imagine. My first fallout game was 3. But I really do love the lore behind the first two. I've read up a little bit on both. Even though I haven't really played either.
---
We vote with our wallets.  If that's not enough, some things should be allowed to fail.  There are people that will support them no matter what for various reasons; you can't really help that because people are free to do whatever.  They stay and get bamboozled, the rest of us move on to greener pastures.
---
In the end this stuff is worth to others whatever they are willing to pay.  I'm not saying that means nobody is allowed to point out a bad deal but sometimes moving on is all you can do.
---
Pretty much I love the suggestions that it’s better to buy a game pass and all the games that are nothing like fallout 76. Sure I want to pay to rent all these old aaa games and indie ones. Like some can be nice but comparing Ark or even like outer worlds is kinda flat. Outer worlds is like a less pretty oblivion, the same general emptiness though without a open world.
---
I copied this post to a thread on the official boards as I think you've stated this well.
---
Link... [https://bethesda.net/community/topic/370797/what-exactly-is-pay-to-win/5?language%5B%5D=en](https://bethesda.net/community/topic/370797/what-exactly-is-pay-to-win/5?language%5B%5D=en)
---
Pretty sad that people are using this situation to stroke their hate boners for the game and its community. "Hey guys I was totally predicting all this from the start and it's the strawman fanboys' fault that this happened because Bethesda as a multi million dollar company with a money-hungry board of executives has no agency of its own". 
---
Please grow up and take a step back to look at what you yourself are doing. This isn't aimed directly at OP, but anybody who comes here or elsewhere to share this mindset. Are you going to pretend that nobody was upset when anything else happened? Are you going to pretend that this subreddit is a representative sample of the game's playerbase, or even a significant one? Are you going to pretend that bethesda actually cares about what people say here? 
---
All you're doing is excusing a disgusting decision by saying that "muh fanboys" let this happen. There are people out there who don't care about gaming politics, and people who work most of the week and don't have time to grind a game all day. Many of those people have plenty of money and don't mind burning a bit on a game every month to increase their enjoyment out of it. Those people are not likely to be on this subreddit, they will use the little free time they have to actually play the game. They will always be a source of income no matter what bethesda does and no matter what you want. I have never spent money on the atom shop, but pretending these people don't exist is just stupid. And as long as they exist, they will continue giving bethesda enough money to make what little comes from here basically irrelevant.
---
I don't even know what the point of this kind of mindset is. Are you mad at anybody who has more money than time? Are you trying to gatekeep anybody who doesn't enjoy the game in the same way as you from enjoying it when you don't? Or do you just want to make yourself feel better about the reality around you by pretending that you knew this would happen all along, and targeting a group of people (other fans) as the sole cause because they can actually listen to you, unlike the decision makers at bethesda who will never see or care about what you think?
---
For my own transparency, I was a loyal player from launch with 600+ hours but stopped playing for good after the raids when the game was too broken to bother with. I never spent a cent of money on the atom shop and only bought the regular version of the game. Believe me or not, call me a shill or not, I don't really care, this helped distract me from writing my paper for tomorrow regardless.
---
TL:DR - Stop blaming faceless fanboys for letting a "slippery slope" occur and at least target your hatred at the actual people responsible for it. No, if you "put your foot down" earlier and cried on reddit a bit more, nothing would have changed
---
I've never used any of those things. Well maybe... I did buy the scrap robot but haven't spent any other atoms. I do have around 8k atoms the last time I checked
---
Its mor eof hoping their actions save the next one. If they dont make enough money for a new one, it will never come.
---
Same. I got two friends to buy the game at launch, and I feel like an idiot. I stopped for a long time and when I heard private servers were coming I went and told the two guys. Days later and of course, Bethesda had to go and fuck that up. And I had to tell them to forget it, because the bastards had to paywall that, too.
---
A rollback wouldnt make a difference anyways. Enemies would not be killable/lootable anyways
---
I don’t think there is next fallout in next couple years if at all from Bethesda
---
Dude, thank you. But it's wasted here. Those people who purchased 1st just don't give a shit. They were dense enough to buy into the scam, that aren't sharp enough to understand why it sucks. And they are too indignant to think about it any harder.
---
Huh..I think you got me on that one, fair enough. I was more or less talking about the general gross monetization of games, which has been a progressively worse thing for years.
---
Secondly, opening the door for a stranger is not the same gesture. Everyone wants the door opened for them. Less than 5% of the world is affected by gender speech and if you knew me you would be ashamed of yourself. I just see both sides of the argument. I use appropriate gender discussion every day and nobody should ever be punished for unintentional slipup.
---
 You are effectively blaming the victim for being raped with your argument. I was trying to just speak and express myself online and weeks later you still chase after you justice.
---
You probably dont see it that way and i agree with the value in your point generally but seriously. Loosen your grip, people can't breath.
---
To be fair, that's a software license rental. Not a subscription. Not sure why you got so many downvotes though.
---
I realise F76 isn't good anymore but seriously, Minecraft or Rust? How desperate of you.
---
good
---
Scrap kit came between 2 and 3. The repair kit thing wasn't just a one-off.
---
&gt; we let this happen by not putting our foot down earlier. 
---
People have been saying from the beginning that this was a problem. Absolutely ignored and ridiculed and like a snowball down a slope, it built up momentum to this day.
---
The truly sad this is people who STILL deny the pay2win aspects of these items. Even you do yourself with the scrapbox not being pay2win. It very much is. However, that's nitpicking. 
---
You've laid out what some of us have known from the beginning (maybe yourself too). The real question is, will people learn?
---
Judging from the number of people that have bought into Fallout 1st, and keep defending it, I don't think we're there yet sadly.
---
Yeah I said the same things, they aren't listening.
---
Same thing happened to me...
---
"Pay to win" doesnt mean literally "winning" anymore, it means paying money for an advantage over those that dont pay.
---
I think you misread my comment. I wasn't claiming wastelanders was bad...
---
Quote " Instead of making decisions like Fallout 1st, make decisions like Wastelanders".
---
I was using Wastelanders as an example of what Bethesda should focus on, rather than more lies and scams that keeps the game stuck in a perpetual lime light of deception.
---
Did exactly the same. But it’s a favourite camp spot too.
---
This bug has been around since launch and it's the reload mutation too. Tons of other less obvious stuff breaks and doesn't get immediately noticed like the reload speed does.
---
The same thing happened to the Hearthstone subreddit when the Blitzchung thing happened.
---
You go there now and literally no one is talking about it anymore.
---
Weapon wheel
---
Honestly I don't care if you do or don't buy the subscription. I don't care if you do or don't like the subscription. In my opinion, there are parts that are nice and parts that are shady (the infinite junk space idea should have been explained better before or while this was released, instead of Beth coming off as liars by not explaining it clearer).
---
But, 2 things:
---
1. Almost EVERYONE on my in-game friends list is either buying this subscription, or visiting private worlds. Other people's friends lists and experiences might be different, but that's just mine.
---
2. I hope nobody's takeaway from this post is that it's okay to bully and harass players who purchase the sub. You can have you own personal opinion of Beth, the sub, the game or heck, even the players. But when you (general, not you specifically, OP) start harassing them for making a personal decision with their money, that makes you no better than the company you're ragging.
---
I guess just... Keep helping the players you come across. We're all on the same side here, and all this infighting solves nothing. It just creates a widening divide between us all.
---
I’m not sure if it’s new plus there is couple similar bugs, easiest work around re-equip your weapon
---
76 was a low production cost seeing as most of the games assets are copy and pasted from Fo4  as well as the former zenimax studio that was acquired produced.
---
That’s what I’m saying... in the end you find out what happened to the people of Appalachia &amp; then you are supposed to nuke the queen to put an end to the scorchbeasts.. obviously it doesn’t actually happen but the story is there people just don’t listen nor pay attention lol
---
Dont see another fallout for 8 yrs. Just remember how long its been since the the last elder scrolls was made.
---
Oh the love of god, this is the lamest justification. If you're so damn busy, a survival game isn't for you. Oh I'm too much of an adult with responsibilities to deal with the game. Let me pay extra cash to not have to play it. Bethesda manufactured a problem to sell you the solution and you fell for it.
---
Yea but if they dont think another game would be profitable then they wont launch it. Which is why i dont understand why KOTOR 3, Half life 3, left for dead 3, and other games havent seen the light of day.
---
The people who actually created the quest themselves are also victims of the marketing team and the greedy higher ups who make bad decisions.
---
I play them once every 3 or 4 years just because I am nostalgic but they are from a different era. Just like my other RPG dungeon crawlers like Wizardry, Eye of the Beholder and even Elder Scrolls : Arena.
---
Great for its time but wouldn't play them today outside of just trying to remember by carefree days. I usually play for about 10 hours and then quit for another 3 years :).
---
Easier to just watch YouTubers play the game and give lore highlights. I like Oxhorn for some of those.
---
Ha i have played ark for a long time and all im gona say is that the lag is much worse than fallout 76
---
Fallout 76 is everything Todd said is wasn’t going to be, it’s a grief fest, the world feels dead, the guns feel weak especially since the huge dupe cheating wave ruined what we’re the best guns. I wish this game would go away and a new fallout would come out already that’s coop and has story driven gameplay.  And when I say coop I mean not pvp, actual coop gameplay with a limit of like 4 players.
---
Yeah? See WoW's cash shop.
---
 I like oxhorn videos too. I'm still committed to beating both games but I know for sure it's going to take me a little bit. I mean shit, it took me probably a week to understand how to fight the rats in the entrance of the vault in the first game
---
For ten bucks a month on ps4 or PC you can get ps now as well so many titles from ps4 and ps3 as well as a few dozen ps2
---
On PS4 they stay in your capture gallery even if you delete them on 76. So i tend to keep my favorites ingame and the rest in my ps4 capture gallery.
---
new account, Hi Bethesda
---
Fanboys be fanboys. There are people here how will defend the game without any condition, when you invest thousands of hours you become obsessed with the game.
---
 And they will buy the sub and any other Bull that Bethesda and Zenimax will throw at them.
---
The fact that 76 even exists is a miracle, since at the time of launch it has only been 3 years since the last Fallout game, and only a little under *2* years after it's final DLC (which makes sense since 76 originally started out as Multiplayer DLC for 4 before becomung too big and ambitious to be *just* a DLC)
---
Compare to the timespan between 3/NV and 4. 3 was released in October 2008, New Vegas was released 2 years after. 4 was released in 2015, an whooping *7* years between the 2 main instalments and only 5 years since the last Fallout game at the time
---
What lies ? Yea you have to name like 1 if your gona post this 
---
Sure they do things that are deceiving and that is just as bad as lieing to us but i dont remember them lieing
---
Oh Jesus I'm sorry everyone
---
The reason that I say it is new is because I have been using this perk for several months without issue.  It is only after the private server patch that I started having issues.
---
Yeah that whole "reddit is a minority" thing doesn't hold a lot of merit when you are also posting on reddit.
---
Also there's like, ten people on any given server at the same time, and you're probably seeing the same people multiple times. So when 5000 people upvote a thread here condemning this service, and every news outlet is deriding it. The ten or some strangers (minus a third, if your math is correct) you claim to have seen online pales in comparison.
---
I quit months ago, once they started nerfing weapons into the ground because cheaters, rather then be banned, were just allowed to cheat and dupe mass amounts of what we’re the best guns.
---
It really pisses me off that you've gotten downvoted for this. Just because bethesda's reprehensible ass decides to suck on everyone's wallets.
---
Played all the fallout games. 
---
Bethesda-made fallout has never been something worth worrying about the integrity of in the sense you're describing. I think the time to worry about destroying the next fallout was back in fallout 3, which featured senseless black and white morality, a massive host of immortal major characters, and many ridiculous moments like telling an ai to kill itself and following liberty prime around. There has been a massive decline in the way stats, weapons, and dialogue are handled in the bethesda fallout incarnations and based on TES6 they have no intention of moving on from gamebryo. 
---
Repair kits and this subscription model are proven effective methods of monetization in ESO so while I don't agree with them, to bethesda this isn't an experiment to see who will buy them, this is the implementation of something they have already tested.
---
On the flip side however, the aforementioned gamebryo engine has had issues going over 60 fps since at least oblivion, through Skyrim and fallout 4, and 76 is the first game to do something about it. So I think that while bethesda is falling behind with games they make stuck on the same old engine, TES6 will have the advantage of all of the post-release bug fixing bethesda normally doesn't bother with because mods will fix it.
---
For purists, thankfully the option to play the outer worlds exists if you liked new vegas, and rimworld exists for people who liked fallout 1 and 2.
---
I don't think you need to have the right IP just to enjoy a game or genre and that other developers are perfectly capable of doing their own RPGs that deliver on what fallout did, and for people who enjoyed 3 and 4, you have Skyrim, TES6, and a hypothetical fallout 5 to look forward to.
---
You had to choose between griefing, leaving and chilling like an adult person. Keep calm and continue to play the game you like. Even when some other of your fellow players have a 2nd free fast-travel point (since when are fast travel costs that issue), another cool outfit or better ways to store scrap. Should influence your gameplay in any way. F76 was always more a PvE as a PvP game so all these new things aren’t that bummer. 
---
If it’s a about PvP, there is NW. Which is surprisingly good in this whole Fallout 76 buggy package. And if it’s due ideals, there are better ways to show your disrespect about company policies and consumer behavior. Which I mean totally seriously. Friday’s for future, never but meat, buy a e-car, whatever. 
---
I decided to try fallout 1st to feel the true lonely experience. And I don’t care if I sub a month more Xbox GamePass, Fallout 1st, WoW or Netflix/prime. But I have also friends, co-workers or my wife to play with. Or the need to play an mmo from time to time on a public server. I see, that Bethesda didn’t it right this time but that makes no difference at all.
---
i don't know why but i feel that if the fallout franchise keeps getting negative pr they might not launch a new game because the name fallout will always be remembered from that broken game and scaring new players
---
You're on PC. PC and PS4 are two totally different operating systems. Just imagine Android and iOS. They are not the same.
---
This is hardly killing videogames, stop being overly dramatic. Bethesda is committed to suicide and both their franchises and their next StarField will suffer for the instant money influx they want now.
---
We will just live in a world without the Bethesda/ZeniMax filth because even the fine developers of Call of Duty panicked when their preorder numbers tanked after rumours of microtransactions circled around and they adjusted accordingly to ensure their survival. BGS is doing none of that and it wouldn't surprise me if StarField isn't a MTX-ridden barely functional trash.
---
Bethesda is DEAD, don't worry.
---
Yeah I am waiting for the DLC to drop to really go all out again. I completed all the quests outside of wild Appalachia.
---
As soon as it drops I am getting the sub. I think the survival idea was good on paper and I enjoyed it for a bit but as a PvE story only player it sort of wore off now. I want to play the story without worrying about food and water the whole time.
---
Also I don't want to compete with other players for resources. Again good on paper and the idea was good but it wore off now. Story missions I want to either solo or just have my friends in my team.
---
Public events I want randos so the sub will give me both. I still like the public events.
---
Also I don't play fallout 76 only so I will only sub 1 or 2 months a year depending on story content drops.
---
Yes. Bethesda is selling bandwidth. So I moved to outer worlds.
---
&gt; How do you know I've never played the game?
---
Because, not being bright enough to avoid being ripped off, also means they lack the insight necessary to produce good arguments. "You're not really a fan" is a classic dumb ad hom to dismiss criticism.
---
Yea Juicehead explains alot things about Bethesda in this video https://youtu.be/sHbXEouo7fk
---
I had someone call me a “broke ass bi**h” because I don’t have Fallout 1st. I don’t have it because I’m done supporting Bethesda. I bought the game. I’ll keep playing it. I won’t however spend another dime on any mtx or game from them.  
---
Dude was actually following me around laughing at my CAMP too. I have a small tiny house with the absolute bare essentials and a huge farm outside. It’s what I love. I keep it pretty basic to fit in with the surrounding.
---
You mean like the 60 dollars I payed already? Or did that just go into a garbage can because apparently these days when you buy a game the general consensus is you don't deserve shit until you've payed at least 3 times over
---
Your way late.  
---
This isn't the experiment.  This is the result of the experiment that is caputalism.
---
It is more profitable to target whales than the masses.
---
This is going on everywhere.
---
I have a hard time believing your a social justice or finance reform advocate because your BITCHING ABOUT A SILLY GAME!
---
If the moat heinous result of your position in the economy is the frustration of expensive game skins then why would you think your opinion is worth it's weight in caps or whatever silly thing you value. Grow the f up. This is the world you live in.  Bitching here about that is juvenile, embarrassing and paints a really sad picture for the future.
---
Junk builds are the best
---
What OP is suggesting is now that there is no survival mode, then there is no such thing as competition in the game anymore.  
---
You lose a workshop and zero junk. Doesn’t sound like competition to me if that’s what you will mention. 
---
Therefore if no competition then no matter what’s added it’s not “pay to win” relative to other players around you.  I play on public servers but never concern myself with other people’s guns or loot or whatever.  Especially since survival mode is gone.
---
This one took me ages. I accidently repaired with max weapon artisan the first time too; I was pissed.
---
Tbf, think they're saying that games that plan on releasing continuos content with full dev teams need to make make money somehow. Either by subscription or paid dlcs. If all the dlcs will be free, how will the devs make money? 
---
I don't really see the value of the sub, and wouldn't pay for it, but if it allows dlcs to be free, I could see an argument for it.
---
&gt;this isn't the first time we've been raided by outside interests
---
Those outside interests aren't even a significant portion of the people with issues. Just read the damn posts. It's mostly coming from loyal players and fans of the game. Don't brush this off as some aberration. The negativity is mostly deserved (of course some go over the top). 
---
There are [literal safe spaces](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76FilthyCasuals/) if the negativity is too much. Might be best to hang out there.
---
Watch all of these be included as part of 1st.
---
Maybe when they do a Bungie and go f2p on the base game excluding DLC.
---
You buy the DLC access and existing owners get free access to the DLC.
---
Just like Destiny 2 did.
---
Refrigerated backpack is an in game item that functions like the fridge.
---
So you're willing to buy a game for full price and then spend money monthly to have it run smoothly? This is like the dumbest mindset ever. Do you not feel entitled to a smooth running game you payed for? You genuinely thing it's ok to sell someone something that is broken and then charge them for a fix?
---
How about more radio stations? Would pay for a New Vegas radio port.
---
Amen
---
Just give me more weapon skins in general. Why is that so hard?
---
Had to vanish a second. Something came up, sorry.
---
I like that the game actually works! They spent 2 years on bugs and fine tuning and it shows. Obsidian made Bethesda look bad when they made Fallout NV in half the time, with an engine they had no experience in. then Bethesda screwed them out of their bonus because the game was rushed, Bethesda did their usual quality control, and the game came up short of a specific metacritic score.
---
Ever since, Beth fanboys never pass up the opportunity to talk about how bad Obsidian is.
---
Now they finally have the opportunity to show off a game they had the time to craft and it's amazing. There were no special editions, no DLC, no day one special crap, no season pass. Just a great game made by people who love making games. It shames Bethesda. Nobody posting here about TOW is doing so to make you feel bad for liking Fallout. Hell, most of us love Fallout.
---
We are doing so to possibly light a fire under Bethesda to actually do better. It's to show that barely good enough, isn't good enough.
---
I enjoy Fallout as well. but screw Bethesda for not making it the best game it can be. Then making us all pay for their lack of effort.
---
Did you read his comment? He knows what OP is saying. He is saying that P2W doesn’t mean you actually win or have a competitive advantage. Now it means that you pay to play an easier, less grindy game than those that chose not to pay.
---
If they really wanted money they should have made the dlc a full expansion and let us rent dedicated servers with mod support.  I would have paid for both instead of uninstalling it.
---
Plus Parvati is more bae than any Fallout companion. (Though I am partial to Curie)
---
If you're willing to pay monthly for smooth servers why would they ever fix performance on public servers?
---
And you just repeat my post. So now we have three different worded explanations of the same thing. 
---
I guess I posted to say. Who cares anymore then
---
You’re an alcoholic junkie but you blame everyone but yourself for your problems. For shame...
---
Yeah, things are laggy as hell the last several days, and I’ve been disconnected more in the last week than the previous five or six months.
---
That's not what "detail" means and you know it.
---
I genuinely believe when players/journos etc coined the term pay2win devs must have been like "holy shit we've hit jackpot yeah lets keep that term" just coz of highly deductive and educated fellers like you
---
Thank you.  That is a much easier way than going into the perk menu.  Still needs to be fixed though.  Also looks like they brought back the favorite wheel bugs.  Having multiple of the same weapon causes issues where the wrong weapon will get selected from the hotbar.
---
This smacks of Avengers meme
---
'You're killing our games !"
---
" I don't even know who you are"
---
i don't know why but i feel that if the fallout franchise keeps getting negative pr they might not launch a new game  anymore because the name fallout will always be remembered from that broken game that fail the expectation
---
Nope money isn’t an issue to me🤷🏻‍♂️🤷🏻‍♂️🤷🏻‍♂️
---
Anyone who justifies Fallout 1st is either an idiot or has a crazy ulterior motive behind it. There are absofuckinglutely zero exceptions
---
And that is on them, some people will defend something they know is bad our of spite. The problem is currently too many gamers just dont care and mobile style microtransactions are too profitable right now for any company to give up. I mean look at how even apex stepped into the generic EA transactions for a little (unsure if they are still a thing dont play apex).
---
Any company will do whatever they can to make their games profitable and while I'm not trying to defend fo76, bethesda will do whatever they feel will make them money. In the end if you dont like it dont invest in it, but there will be those that enjoy the game and honestly its childish to hate them for that as generally them liking something doesnt hurt you.
---
I bought first but I don't play the server. Well, if my friends are on a private server I'd play it. I like checking out other people's camps and vendors. I think it was worth it for the outfit and points, the private server is a bonus
---
Wait there is a limit? How much is the limit?
---
That’s kind of funny.  I chuckled.   They are mad at you for supporting their predatory practices.  They blame you for helping to ruin Bethesda.  I kind of like the idea of a war between subscribers and non subscribers.  It’s like player made factions.
---
Not trying to be mean but absolutely no matter what you’re either a troll or an idiot and that’s not even remotely subjective
---
The problem nowadays with gaming as a medium is that people want to say they don't support the business practices of a company, or that they're just 'trying to enjoy' the game without the drama and they'll always continue buying things no matter what.
---
They don't realize, or just don't care to accept this is one of those things you unfortunately can't be neutral on because buying into it is already making a statement.  That statement is "I like this, I want more of this" regardless whether or not you're telling other people you don't actually approve of the way how things operate.  
---
As time has gone on, gaming has placed less emphasis on overall gamer opinion and more on numbers.  Who cares if people say our product actually sucks/offer bad value, or that we have shitty anti-consumer practices when our game still sells boatloads because we can always rely on the people that buy into our crap no matter what?
---
The only thing game companies understand is when we hit into their bottom line and they see the numbers going down.
---
" Before I rant I just want to clarify that I think Fallout 1st is just as wrong as the last guy. Did I purchase a month? Yes "
---
No need to read the rest, you're a total hypocrite.
---
Literally damn near any other game ever made is better than 76.
---
I love tiny, super densely decorated camps!
---
Yep, pay2win is pay2win even if it's cheap.
---
Destiny’s pricing is also a joke. No question that anyone who pays for this stuff is contributing to gaming a decline too. Without people fucked up enough in the head to buy the horrid things these companies currently put out, they’d have to make actual legitimate video games instead
---
&gt;Is that last bit sarcasm?
---
Imagine living life whilst being this oblivious
---
I can see that yeah. It's your money and you do with it whatever the hell you like :)
---
Just on my way to BGS with this fuel tank, nothing suss...
---
This sort of poor thinking bothers me, aside from the very obvious it's not a literal win thing. 
---
A maxed out character is a max out character. Adding more levels isn't going to matter.
---
For now.
---
Add the intended features that Bethesda wanted to sort out i.e. rebalance PvP and add the level prestige system and watch how much of an advantage all these utility and Fallout 1st items make. 
---
It's not as blatant as buy the best weapons/armour in the game but it's not that far off. It's all about saving time. The more time you save travelling around and micromanaging inventory, the more time you have to earn XP, caps, loot and legendary items. Unless you pay, you just can't keep up and if you can't keep up, you lose.
---
So don’t...
---
Processing load on the servers. Might be ok on a private server but for a public one, forgeddaboudit.
---
That's my whole argument, why make us pay for a service when we have a better option at our disposal
---
Thanks!
---
Yeah I get it, they are already unstable as it is. 
---
But I want to share my cool pictures dammit!!!
---
Reddit is only a 'minority' selectively when the circumstances seem to change apparently (like being dismissive).  Because if we're a minority, it's awfully strange that this is one of the few places we can actually have our voices reach Bethesda via community managers. 
---
As far as I know, Bethesda's own forum is probably hardly frequented by the same people who frequent the Fallout subreddits, so if there's any minority as far as discussion outlets go, it's them.
---
Would make the “1st” in Fallout 1st make sense
---
If you rewatch the E3 reveal for FO76, you’ll be able to catch a few.
---
This game has been out for almost a year. I’ve made a handful of great friends that constantly have to wait in queue to join a server so we can all play together. Private servers works in that aspect. Just because it doesn’t suit you, doesn’t mean it doesn’t for others. Also, nobody is forcing you to pay for it.
---
50
---
you do not understand what P2W is or means, educate yourself before you keep making yourself look like an ass. lol
---
just wait for the insult bot to pay you a visit...
---
And its not like its hard to find what we like. Most downloaded mods should about cover it
---
Damn. Must be an Xbox/ps4 limitation.  I’m on pc and currently have 743 in my gallery. If I scroll through them as fast as I can it looks like a cool storybook
---
There is no real difference between a NPC saying "I like sandwiches" and a holotape of a NPC saying "i like sandwiches".  
---
(oh, and saying "fucking" in every sentence don't make your argument better)
---
When does this event start?
---
And because of that it definitely not gonna happened 😅
---
I honestly hope it is profitable. This game being profitable is the only way it will ever see improvement.
---
Well done, brothers. I will not buy the game ever, of course, but to those of you that had to suffer through out, please continue to band together and bring justice to these players. lol
---
Private servers are not inherently solo? They can be (currently only if you have no friends on your list, apparently they can join at any time). 
---
I don't really get this post I guess. 
---
I've seen quite a few posts where a group of friends or family members are utilizing them. One person pays, the rest can join up and your left to your own devices sans the greater community. IMO that seems like one of their better uses. Can't pull that off in FO4 for obvious reasons.
---
I did such post yeaterday and got gancked by blind fanboys so true mate.
---
You know many of us come from gaming backgrounds where subscriptions to online gaming was the norm 20 years ago, it isn't new by a longshot.
---
yes it's a console limitation for sure
---
What really fucking gets me is I'm dead fucking confident releasing the game on Steam and allowing players to host their own private-servers would be both more financially advisable for the games future and better for their image in the long run. They can publish ARK-like expansions. They don't even gotta get rid of the ATOM shop. Just have the host buy the rights to that item for a server and allow them to incorporate it into the server however you'd like. I dislike that, but it still keeps it relevant and it still keeps it around.
---
It’s an option to pay. You aren’t being forced lmao. Is Fallout 4 online compatible? Can I play with my friends or am I a loner there? I play 76 because I can be with friends and enjoy the fallout verse.
---
Rip fallout😭😭😭
---
That’s his point you’re not being made to do anything
---
I always wanted fallout as a co-op and not race for mob kills with randoms, i did get what i wanted with private servers plus it fixed lag, i really enjoy farming nukes and doing vault raids thx to private servers
---
Are you saying this isn't an MMO?
---
I didn't think it was that expensive, but then I realised it was in US dollars, not New Zealand dollars. It's $190 here, which is horrendous
---
I haven’t played 76 in a long while, picked it up Saturday to play again...still didn’t like it ...I’m not a multiplayer  person ...it’s not classic fallout to me anymore. But I’m happy to pick up Fallout 4 all the mods are terrific!
---
1 it cost money to run servers like they do and to charge is understandable. And hopefully they are making some profit in order to improve even further.  I want constant updates until next ES Game
---
RemindMe! 6 Months "5 stars in the atom shop"
---
While I wouldn't say I feel like Bethesda "owes" anyone, a complimentary month of 1st to either anyone who pre-ordered, played the BETA or has played so many hundred hours would do a lot to show that they appreciate the players who have stuck with them through the rough patches.
---
How does one pay to win Fallout 76?  Educate us all.  Nail it down.  What exactly is Bethesda selling to players to enable them to "win" the game?  Be specific.
---
But the increase in stash box space was
---
Literally this^
---
$20
---
I heard it has x16 the lies, in fact!
---
Do you play on a private server with your friends?
---
Was very hopeful for the future when Nuclear Winter dropped but after that it was just silence and small content drops that's not exactly accessible to everyone right away like bosses or raids (level caps, gotta find groups, min max)
---
We've been waiting since launch for private servers with modding capabilities. Now we gotta pay for the servers, what does this mean for the mods?
---
They cut survival server becose they needed server space to sell us for ridiculus price.
---
This is every argument ive made all week nicely tied together
---
 Ty, this sums it up perfectly. 1st is P2w or at least pay to have insane advantages in every aspect of life
---
"a few new people buying the game every now and then means the playerbase hasn't dropped!"
---
you know how big the market for games is nowadays, right? the Fallout series isn't exactly obscure
---
Dumb
---
666 They cannoymt broke something which is beyond fixing.
---
I never stated why *do* I have to pay for this. I said why *should* I. As in this is a costly alternative to what fallout 76 was originally advertised as.
---
If you this makes it to PS4 I'll give some recipes that I already know and some weapon mod plans. I'd be happy just get them out of my stash
---
Criticism to Bethesda is legit and important. But please stop thinking in religious terms, when it comes to business.
---
Bro the physics in 2. could blow up a whole server.
---
bro 😎💪
---
Only sligthly. Unless you pay for a lag free private instance.
---
Criss-cross...
---
people like YongYea are part of those clusters which use clickbait and badly sourced information, the guy is two steps away from being LegacyKillaHD...and that guy just made a video where he insinuated a "disgruntled fan" somehow "took" a site from bethesda. 
---
YongYea was pretty much part of the tirade with the helmets, and even that was a perfect example of those who do not do any research and quickly capitalize on the flash controversy.
---
Fact : stop defending corporations they hire people for that.
---
Players who purchased at launch already have the advantage of time vs. someone buying the game now and those had to pay a premium launch price for that privilege. 
---
There are players who purchase multiple accounts to facilitate hoarding of items and materials already. 
---
Someone who can play 8 hrs a day has a time advantage over the player who only plays a couple an hours a weekend. 
---
Time was already a commodity.
---
Yeah because I have friends. We all enjoy the game. You should try finding some. We constantly do nukes, events, build, raids, and take pictures. Just a work surrounded by people we talk to.
---
Yelling “the player base has dropped!” is equally accurate. At least anyone can log in and see the sheer number of new players. There are no hard numbers about population total. You being blindly angry doesn’t magically make you know the population.
---
Unless you have a citation for the population? Got a link?
---
Because you can’t play 4 with friends? 🤷🏻‍♂️. For a days worth of cigarettes, I can play with all my friends on a lag free server doing vault raids, running nuked WS where some bloody build with a tesla isn’t killing all the enemies (not just the legendaries...all of them). And best of all, no grievers messing with you. You don’t have to deal with people who dupe nuke mines and stay in passive themselves. So basically I can do what I want, when I want, where I want.  Whether it be in adventure or private server is totally up to how I feel that day....all for a days worth of smokes.
---
Mainly I paid to get away from 12 YO greifers.
---
Read today's sticky - if you want *persistent* comments then you'll have to pony up for FO75First for 4.99 a month.
---
well if you dont want to see the facts even if they hit you in the face like this one directly from your post. 
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/do2pwm/fact_nothing_that_bethesda_has_been_accused_of/f5jol2q?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x
---
also a simple google search can tell you what it is, and if you are too simple minded to see what gives an advantage to paying player over the none paying player in FO 76 then have a good day lol.
---
I've brought it not long ago. It's a fun game and worth playing if you have friends that will play it with. Otherwise after about level 15 it's starts to not be as fun without friends. I'm also on ps4
---
What do weapons get you?
---
And what they *really* wanted to do was move onto Starfield, BGS's first real original IP.  The Todd said he and his people have been wanting to do their own thing for over a decade.  So once F4 wrapped up, they just wanted to finish up this experimental side project ASAP and move onto their long awaited passion project. 
---
So it was definitely a double whammy in that regard.  THe first game the studio could truly claim is it's own (Starfield is waiting!) Vs a spinoff for a sequel of some other company's IP (F76).
---
Honestly, if you liked Fallout 4, you’ll probably like this game. The ambience is great, and the music is amazing. The bugs are a major problem, though, and I wouldn’t recommend the new premium service, at least at this time.
---
How many DLC's for CK2 are there again? I think you need to sell a kidney to buy them all at once...
---
This looks awesome. What platform you play on?
---
Real talk: The Outer Worlds is better than Fallout 76.
---
Apparently the tent is indestructible. Another point for pvp advantage.
---
Also with all that stash space people can save multiple armor sets like say a pvp and a raid set...
---
Yeah tell me about it, I saw a guy coming to brag about how he has a house and three cards and can throw money away on this...some fans are a weird bunch let me tell you.
---
They should seeing as how the game was nearly 50% off 2 weeks after launch.
---
RemindMe! 24 hours
---
Did you pay the full $60?
---
Or set it on fire, flush it down the toilet, etc.
---
Yes
---
I’d wait till it goes free to play
---
Yes, bending down and taking it up the ass IS the way...only in USA folks, only in USA people actually scorn those who fight to their rights.
---
Is English not your first language
---
Its more pay for progression or pay for advancement. Its make a no end grind game much easier and cost efficient. If i had private worlds and junkstash i could log in, grab all the steel and lead from every generator, and after a day have over 50k rounds of ammo in raw scrap. Not to mention my 45 water purifiers across the map that i could use to sell to vender bots.  Thats 1.2k caps and infinite ammo for my heavy build. 
---
Also the Tent is indestructible atm in pvp so it can be used as perfect cover.
---
Can you dismiss that claim?
---
To put it simply, because I have fun and enjoy the game. Appalachia looks beautiful, especially along the Ohio River where my new character’s camp is. One thing I’ve always loved about the Bethesda Fallouts is just being able to point yourself in one direction and explore. 
---
And the the Atomic Shop and Fallout 1st stuff? It’s people’s money that they worked for and made a conscious decision to buy. As nitpicky as this subreddit is, none of that gives much of an in-game advantage. I’ve been playing since day 1 of the beta, and never since the stash limit was increased to 800 have I needed to spend more than a minute trying to figure out what to get rid of.
---
I'm sorry I dont see any new maps or actual dlc type content... I just see skins and the same buggy mess.
---
Oh yeah, look at the shit other AAA publishers are pulling, slowly killing their franchises. Ubisoft has to delay every single game they had coming on the account of how bad Ghost Recon and Division 2 did. Games are being ruined and changed to make every single cent possible. Yes, AAA video games are dying out. Who in the world asked for a dumb online Fallout game?!
---
First thing they should do about it being less broken is make it less broken.  Shit crashes way too much.
---
nope, I'm paying for the next fallout with 1st. you guys will death or work your negativity. dollar wins everytime.
---
Saying it works better than another game proves nothing. It also works better than a blue screen of death.
---
Look at the unofficial patch for skyrim, Bugthesda are lazy and can do better.
---
Stop being such a whiny bitch.
---
I see mostly people being bs about the subscription.   Can you give us detail on what it is actually like?  nPCs?  New missions? Map expansion?
---
On the other hand in Lithuania I could pay for my internet connection and have enough for cheap mobile plan for 15 euros. Or I could buy food for a week if I was being frugal. Or I could go to the cinema 3-4 times. 
---
You are comparing it to WoW but, WoW offered full game for that subscription, this just offers stuff that should have been in base game and private servers.
---
I didn't make the claim so I don't have to prove anything. I was just curious if there was any statement by Bethesda or other offical word ad to exactly how the private servers worked. I suppose I should have worded my post differently. But still I would like to know, out of curiosity.
---
They are tho. When you take a core aspect of fallout and sell it as a yearly 100 dollar subscription and dont add much to the private servers you really arent doing yourself a favor. Espeically since the games atom shop is bs and a lot of what makea fallout fallout isnt even there
---
Yes, I believe that is about what I paid last year... I paid for it before it was officially released and it arrived around Thanksgiving
---
I take it you missed all the evidence and articles about this from last week?
---
I want camo for my hunting and shotguns...
---
You are paying for what the skyrim community did for free.
---
Slippery slope fallacy
---
The people posting here on F76 Reddit are for sure a minority compared to players who are just playing the game and never visit this forum. Now, what all their opinions are about Bethesda’s decisions - who knows.
---
What the actual f\*\*\*? seriously are you the embodiment of dumb southern Amercian here? Pound is stronger than USD, hence it does not convert 1 to 1. State of USA education ladies and gentlemen.
---
Bethesda Dictionary entry for "loyalty":
---
   See "sucker"
---
Just don't buy those triple A games with all the fuckery. Bethesda is just corroding away, only bringing more ire to the current state of the videogame industry, which is ultimately a good thing as people are waking up. Gamers don't like to be thrown into the same boat as gambling addicts.
---
I'm hoping for a giant crash of the triple A industry and thayt cockgobblers like Bethesda, EA, Activision and Blizzard suffocate in the bed the shat in after trying to dutch oven the consumers.
---
All other caterwauling aside, upon thinking about it I felt all preorder players should get a month for free. 
---
And ulike some suggestions it makes marketing sense. Give us a taste (as the pushers say) and if its really good, we'll start paying...  Meanwhile it'd be nice to gwt thrown a bone for sticking with it thru those rather shaky early days.
---
Yes to be honest I have not lasted the game in about a month and for the last two weeks I've been in the hospital cut off from everything outside. So I am genuinely in the dark to what's going on, I just heard about private servers yesterday. So I am curious add to how they work.
---
Nope. Same game with a private world, an unlimited junk stash, and some ranger armor and emotes. It makes the game easier, but that's about it. The private worlds do run much more smoothly though, which I like.
---
I love how you defend this shitshow :D
---
Well, it's $180 annually for WoW (which is not optional), including paying for Base game, full-priced expansions *and* they have items in a Cosmetic shop.
---
76's cosmetic shop may be expensive, but their base game is cheap, dlc's are free, and the subscription gives a huge ingame advantage, but it's still an optional subscription. You could even just subscribe once, dump all your junk in the Scrap box, then don't subscribe again until you run out of the stored scrap.
---
If addictive equals good, then mobile games are objectively the best games on the planet.
---
that would just be to cool tho. for example if you could say toggle on a factions setting. and  all raider bots become hostile. or set white springs bots to hostile 24-7 or force glowing ones to spawn all over the white springs. or double the amount of enemy’s like a zombie mode. or night time only mode. or 2x damage mode. turn off thirst. like even if it isn’t full blown mods they could give us some options to make a private server go bizarre!
---
In Canada It's $17 per month
---
Yeah thats ridiculously expensive. Thankfully it's not worth ever purchasing but even if it was worth buying I'm sorry for the steep pricing.
---
Trust me, I dont even remember the last time I bought any games from these "publishers". Probably BF4 and even that was busted for like a year. Fortunately, there are many MANY indie and the so called AA games to go around. I know it has been said to death, but Outerworlds just came in, I have Surge 2 to jump on next and no shortage of smaller games. I am proud that I have not given money to these fuckers for more than a few years.
---
Youre about 15 years late to the party, op. The goal posts gave moved forward and backward.  Video have been apparently dying for a very long time. Nothing permanent will change unless you convince government to make policy changes regarding the mtx world.
---
Honestly? You're just a sheep, and I hate to use that term. Literally the definition of "make the problem and sell the solution" and you're angry at people for not being ok with it
---
This is how hopeless gaming is. People like you unironically exist and push these opinions.
---
I have fun with it. I bought at a discount (can’t remember the actual discount) but it was cheap enough I could justify it. Been happy so far. I knew going in it wouldn’t be a Fallout game in the way we normally know them but I didn’t care. The game is almost like post apocalyptic Sims with atmospheric storytelling. I don’t mind that at all. I like building my camp, scavenging for weapon parts, killing scorched, and meeting new players. I like that it’s fun. You just can’t expect the same experience like a first person Fallout rpg game.
---
Of course not? This isn't WoW or GW or ESO or SWTOR or FFXIV or BDO or any kind of MMORPG. This is a multiplayer survival open world lite RPG.
---
Yep
---
Great post. I'm with you. We need to be smarter responsible consumers. This is an industry with terrible employment practices. We can't even hold them accountable for bad products, how can we stand up for these workers?
---
Don’t do it yet, wait a few more weeks before doing that. Keep some junk in it, but only what you need. At least that’s what I’m doing now.
---
I lost a LOT of junk and have had none of it returned.
---
The only people still playing this game are in it for the long haul lol
---
I just put my acrap in the junkbox and is still there.  :) hope nothing happen xD  never trust on bethesda haha.   But fk it i need loss weight on my chars
---
Np! There does seem to be more players on consoles tbh, hope you enjoy it! I'll probably be playing for a couple years tbh
---
Lol no worries I laughed and appreciated you admitted I got you haha. And yeah no I fully agree don't worry! It's so sad what the "AAA" industry is becoming. All I was talking about though is that this is the first non MMO game to try charging a sub. Which is really dangerous as if it's successful whatsoever other games will try it too.
---
Speaking for myself, playing solo let’s me know I’m completely alone. It sets a mood, if you will, for exploring and taking everything in. You don’t have that nagging feeling in the back of your head that some rando is gonna pop up outta nowhere when you’re just trying to relax. Or worse, bring a group of enemies that you suddenly have to deal with when you’re listening to a holotape or reading a note.
---
Thank you, and I find it astonishing I get downvoted for asking what MTX means, sheesh, get a life people, not everyone on the internet knows all of the fucking abbreviations damn.
---
Feel free to define what "winning" means in Fallout 76 past the main quest line for the single player.  Haven't heard anything worth a lick all night.  You might be the first.
---
!remindme 3 months
---
Dude. You really fucking think P2W means it literally has to give you better bullets than the other person? P2W is any non cosmetic advantage, educate yourself stop defending garbage corporations, they pay enough people to do that for them.
---
You know I'm not the one who asked for free DLC. I'm not the one who even expected free DLC. I do expect a finished game for 60 dollars. A polished experience for 60 dollars. We didn't receive that and it was discounted almost instantly. 
---
They could have offered DLC for money, and people would have bought it. Polished DLC can be great. I don't think anyone has any issue paying money for a product. 
---
I only ask that people get what they paid for, what they were PROMISED. It has nothing to do with entitlement. How fucking dare you cite people NOT participating in their bullshit cosmetic shop as the reason they have a hard time keeping up. They should have thought of that before making all these promises. Before locking features behind paywalls. And they definitely should have thought of that before shipping a broken game with little to no features at launch. 
---
Bethesda are the ones who are entitled. They believe they're entitled to your money simply because they're fucking Bethesda, and who makes games as great as Bethesda!? So much so they have people like you acting like somehow WE are doing them a disservice by expecting what they promised us. 
---
Maybe one day you'll grow up and realize Bethesda is a company who doesn't care about you, and the only reason they are having trouble running this game is because of their own hubris. Nothing more.
---
FO1st tent is way more durable.  But the IRL one doesn't crash as often.\*
---
(\*I was going to say never, but then I remembered a wind storm flattening mine once.)
---
Well yes, that may be true. I don't know either way.
---
I play the game, but not monetization, I got a csmp that's all I need!
---
Jesus I haven't seen someone so hateful in a long time. What did the gaming industry and the rest of us do to you for you to wish something so destructive???
---
Actually....legendary items in the Atom Shop wouldn’t be such a bad thing. I wouldn’t mind dropping dough on Atoms to buy good legendary stuff. Let’s hope Bethesda listens this time and makes it happen.
---
Creation club 76?
---
 Non-cosmetic advantage to do... what?  Go on.  Nail it down.  Be specific.
---
Oh yeah, Steam would have been a huuuge boost! But they needed that sweet refund control.
---
But you're affecting us when you whale.
---
I disliked it precisely because I have been to the DMV, and it took me 2 hours to complete because the terminal to fill out the first form was bugged, and then I had to go find the form and governor seal, which according to guides was in the courthouse across the way.
---
I was having flashbacks of every time the DMV says they don't have something of mine on file, they tell me to go to the courthouse to get it, the courthouse prints it and tells me it's in the system so the DMV should have had it, then I have to go back to wait in line at the DMV again.
---
Except in the game the courthouse across the street doesn't have what you need either! Turns out all the guides online for the quest are out of date except Bethesda's official guide.
---
Catch anything yet?
---
Almost as if...it should have been included in the fucking game at launch.
---
Dota2+ is how you to a voluntary subscription properly, and it's like 2 bucks a month
---
Lol I love this
---
Interesting, that kind of thing never even enters my mind, I so rarely run into people outside of hotspots, and rarely then, but I play over night or early mornings as I work 3rd shift.
---
Oh, yeah. Before. They really have no absolute choice not to, now. Release it on Steam with player-ran private servers and it profits no matter what.
---
Basically people playing it private servers are finding loot missing and dead enemies in some places. I’d link an article but I’m on mobile and that’s way too much work.
---
Never gonna buy a single game from you guys which have micro transactions. I am even scared to buy any game which has anything more than a single player.
---
Dude there's no real PvP in adventure mode. Let's stop pretending it's some kind of competitive game.
---
It’s worth it.
---
The lashing out on Reddit and YouTube is not very objective.  Especially considering that most people posting the negative comments have hundreds of hours in the game.  Can you “not enjoy” a game for hundreds of hours and continue playing ? :)
---
Also, you can check out the FilthyCasuals76 for an alternative view of game (and life)
---
faster material gain, quicker repair timers or whatever. I don't play this game I just sorted by controversial on front page and saw this shit. This is why gaming is becoming so filled with predatory garbage you let corporations charge you 60$ and then mobile game monetize you and the """""not p2w""""" crowd lets them get away with it and are responsible for so many shit AAA games nowadays.
---
How about making private servers free for everyone. Buying fallout 1st just supports these shitty business practices and let's Bethesda and anyone else know it's ok to put micro transactions in our games.
---
So much jealousy in this post.
---
You mean 8 to 14 a month?
---
That would be a good decision on Bethesda’s part
---
what if they did a game mode called “WAR” ok, so it’s on surval type settings and it’s basicly for PvP players (clans) to fight over work shops. it even could be a raid or some sorts. maybe who ever banks the most junk from the shops. or just some sort of PvP scavenger hunt. we’re scorch beasts and super mutants spawn 2x. even random nukes drop. so the environment it’s just hell on earth.  and the PvP folks are fighting it out over work shops. they could even do it with nuke winter perks/ damage  and you can only pick up looted gear like nuke winter.
---
I did enjoy fallout 4. 3 and NV too but now on windows 10 they crash every other minute. 😓
---
I think ill get it in that case
---
Or you're bruger kings is expwnsive af
---
Well, how long did ESO take from launch to go F2P?
---
Awww I love this! Cheswick is actually my IRL cat. A friend of mine is a level designer for the game and he put Cheswick in there for me, as well as me as a dead raider and the note “come back to us” Cheswick kept glitching, getting stuck in a wardrobe...they tried fixing him but couldn’t so they had to kill him :( Hopefully some day he will be back in the game alive and well! &lt;3 thanks for caring about my Cheswick
---
Ahh.  Ok.  So you don't understand what you're talking about.  My bad.  I thought I was talking to someone familiar with the game and not someone force-fed by YongYea or whoever you watch on YouTube that dumps on 76.
---
I'm on mobile too, could you link it when you're on a PC please, I can't get on one atm.
---
Are you daft?  The definition of Pay 2 Win in a Player vs. Environment game is paying real money to alter the gameplay in order to have an advantage.
---
&gt; Use descriptive titles. Clickbait or extremely vague titled posts will be removed. 
---
If you have a question about something, please put the question **in the title**. **Avoid the use of trailing ellipsis.** Posts with ellipsis are generally clickbait and non descriptive. Reddit does not make it possible to edit titles, so you will have to post again with a more descriptive title without a trailing elipsis. If you have questions you can feel free to message the moderators.
---
I'm fine, I can stop it anytime. I could live a healthy live with no addictions, but come on, 50% more damage with Junkie weapons and 25% with Psychobuff on top of 20% melee with Whiskey. Something like that, dunno how It stacks, I need Mentats to keep my intelligence in check.
---
Well if i didnt enjoy a game i dont think id be playing it for hundreds of hours. I guess “most people posting nevative comments” are just the kind that will complain no matter what
---
People are taking it "too seriously" because it could be a start to a horrible practice in video games. What is stopping them from adding unlimited raiding to the membership? I could very much see them do this just to lure the hardcore endgame players into this.
---
Exp boost is seen in way to many games, that could also be a next.
---
What if you get a new equipment option called wallet much like the backpack. BUT NOW all your carryweight bonuses are doubled.
---
It all starts small. Like when you got the option to buy repair kits and scrap kits. Then the scrapbot and fridge. Now fallout 1st.
---
Introducing "Fallout 1st ELITE PASS" includes all of the above but for 20$ a month.
---
Up next we are releasing a new part of the map, but to access it you have to pay 2 dollars everytime. We are also not making it possible to set up camp there and there will be no vendors either, so you will have to go back at some point, which we will also be charging you 2 dollars for because the bussfare ain't free. Now i know this one is a little ludicrous, but you know... maybe it's not.
---
Willing to give it a try though. Was really interested at announcement but bethesda has done its best to murder anyone’s interest
---
Ya know, Bethesda was too successful to try this crap with their fans and fans of Fallout. I'd understand if it was some new company that came along and bought the rights from a failing studio, or if Bethesda had a long string of flops and was forced to take dire measures in a wild attempt to stay afloat.... but that wasn't the case, at least not as far as most can tell. Most Bethesda games do pretty well. Too well for this absolute crap.
---
Each choice they have made since the choice to make 76 what it is almost seems deliberate to ruin what they have, and soon might just be had.
---
I don't know, maybe Fallout 4 spawned a widespread cocaine problem that led to an extreme need for funds and bad decision making.
---
Kudos, Bethesda. Obsidian just gave everyone the Fallout game that you couldn't... well, could but refused to, and did so without your involvement and without the property. They did it better and didn't take a hot steaming piss on everyone that wanted to throw money at them. To make it 100 times worse, they have been humble about the entire thing.
---
You should learn a thing from New Vegas's Karma system, I think they were trying to warn you even back then.
---
Is this an assumption or a statement?
---
Uninstall the game, leave the subreddits, move on with your life.  It’s that simple.
---
Exactly.
---
The sub hard determines access to host private servers.
---
The sub soft determines your ability to use a scrapbox. You can farm for a month for junk, cancel sub, and withdraw from its reserves. 
---
The sub can be purchased and canceled any time.
---
If you buy 1 month at a time, you can decide to only purchase the sub when they offer mtx you want from the store, as they include 1600ish atoms a month.   If you already use the atomic store, subbing in one month periods at your choosing makes the most sense. 
---
It is in addition to mtx, but again, but 12.99 of atoms here and there and you get a better share of atoms than buying atoms alone.  You can get that deal once a month. Skip a month, sub for multiple months and stock atoms the cancel. It melds mtx into subbing. Which, again, if you've already bought atoms and use the store, it's an odd complaint to have because it's now bundled with a "sub" 
---
And what's still currently broken in the game? Quite a lot has been fixed over a year, hasn't it? They attempt to fix most critical things asap. Some have lingered and some things break again. 
---
Trail of lies... From what I understand, they said free dlcs, cosmetic mtx, and likely paid servers early on.  So they add a sub and it's a trail of lies?  I mean, a sub for private servers alone seemed to go hand in hand.  They threw extra stuff on it, and somehow it's worse than offering a server sub alone?
---
The other problem that corporate greed instills is the whole this game doesnt serve a purpose, like fallout being a rpg story driven game, but instead they become games for everybody. Games that were great before now try and be things they arent and every new game tries to emulate 6 games to be the best od the best. Games are less of what they used to be and more of nametags slapped onto nearly identical cookie cutter games.
---
Don't think it is free to play, used to be a game you needed to pay a subscription for to a game where you just buy the game then play it
---
People can buy subreddits ?
---
&gt;The whole not mentioning New Vegas for almost ten years, and treating it like it never existed.
---
Just ignore all the references to New Vegas in FO4. New Vegas fans have this weird victim complex where they like to pretend that Bethesda hates their game even though they have no reason to. People are fucking stupid
---
*would it have
---
Having recently returned from Texas (San Antonio, Austin, Dallas, Houston), I love this idea.  Maybe some DLC into New Orleans.  I would defend the shit out of the Alamo.
---
Bethesda: Hold my beer!
---
The world's always run another with less people inn them. I'd assume what I have heard and seen is true
---
No need to get offended
---
yeah, that's disgusting.
---
Precisely. I always feel pressure to farm places so the next guy can use it. Private servers allows you to play FO76 like FO4 and let's you relax and explore at your leisure.
---
Paid community cosmetics wouldn't be a problem. Tennogen makes tons of money in Warframe and the game still feels 100% fair to play.
---
&gt; If you keep going back, it is your fault at a certain point, not the people who enjoy the snacks.
---
yes i actually unsubbed from all my fallout 76 subreddits recently and do not plan on playing any other bethesda multiplayer title. they can clearly not stick to what they're offering at the sale stage.
---
the fault here is not the people buying snacks or candy since it's being offered but bethesda that lied. that there are people defending the practice is just icing on the cake, and not really something i agree with, but neither is it something i'd put my energy into (in-game).
---
Oh yeah and I get that. What I was confused about is the comment since the whole idea behind the atomic shop which was supposed to sell only cosmetics (boy did that last long) was to support the game. Sooo...yeah lol
---
We were never going to get any of this stuff for free. Businesses don’t work by doing that, they work by testing the market, evaluation results, and searching for rent-seeking situations such as recurring subscriptions. 
---
Simply put, as someone who wants to get all of these ongoing improvements and enhancements for free, you are not their target market; as you represent little to no opportunity for additional income, and therefore your opinion is irrelevant to their marketing plans.
---
You got a deal, for us it's 119 EUR in EU.
---
I'm pissed because Wastelanders was delayed because they need to fix bugs, and the replacement was a monetization ponzi scheme that is still full of bugs.  
---
I'm done with you, Bethesda. You're worse than EA now, and EA made a DLC for a DLC FFS.
---
Also, the private servers with mods? You're going to need the atoms from the sub. Just wait, they're going to do it with paid mods. It worked in 4. People gobbled it up. There's no way we're getting access to the servers in a way that would allow us to take stuff from the Nexus and put it on. No, it will be Bethesda approved mods. And you'll likely pay for them.
---
Everyone has their own opinion but that TSE nerf wasn’t that bad, it brought some variation to builds
---
Yeah because doing nothing about it is how things get better 🙄
---
Don't they have millions of subscribers, so scale of economy allows them to offer cheaper subs. Same with what Xbox game pass expects.
---
0,05 atoms added to your wallet.
---
How does it feel to be a useless drone?
---
I love you
---
And it's only better now.
---
No p2w. No lootboxes. Free heroes. New maps. New gamemodes. Events. Big update of sequel era coming for 9th movie. Keys available for 12-14€
---
I wish I could go back to the way it was before but playing the private servers has ruined public servers for me. My god, the difference. On public servers it can take me upwards of 2-3 minutes to change out the damaged mainframe cores in a silo run, on private it takes ten seconds.
---
the remaining players are fully on board with pay 2 convenience. imo, that's the situation. it's just about business. numbers were never good, but they dropped to  indie game levels in the last 3 months (estimates around 40k active users at any given time) they know wastelanders isn't the full-game's worth of content that players are expecting and will have major issues upon release, so release subscription now. fleece the core audience for all they can...before the next dlc has even more folks giving up.
---
Whoever buys fallout worst isn't helping the game, its the opposite. Its ensuring it dies sooner than later.
---
If the game wasn't being praised before, you surely aren't getting new blood by monetizing the game even more AND adding further P2W.
---
I did misread it, yeah, sorry about that. make sense now.
---
It's quite the indictment of the game, tbh.
---
i’m worried  about junk prices junk is all over. but the FO1st peeps will def have the jump on ammo since we can just hoard lead, steele, plastic.   i think the abundance of ammo should help the game.
---
Other countries seem to have been hit harder than Australia but we still do have to pay more than Americans. When you think about it though it’s probably fairly even considering the average American not only earns less money, but also has less spending power with that money than Australians.
---
To be fair...
---
Many of the people posting are Fallout fans. FO76 has a lot of potential with some simple fixes and additions - many of which have been proposed over the past year.  The recent posts are the release of the accumulated negativity.  Much of it is not objective.  There are some posts that are well thought out.
---
Even if you get it because of the the additional lore or treat it as a continuation of FO4 - it’s worth the $20-30  for a few hundred hours of entertainment (in my opinion)
---
I enjoy the game is it is now and played for hundreds of hours and it’s still my “go-to” game to unwind.  The game has been continually improving and there are big hopes for the Wastelanders release.
---
Its not just B. that does this btw. Fuck knows why other countries get cheaper games. Look at steam for a start and all the work arounds associated with that.
---
Funny is, the same experience was there with the unlimited weight glitch.
---
But people cried about it because it supposedly killing server stability (and not cheap ass bethesda servers)
---
How much does apex legends cost to buy?
---
I wish. I’m still crashing every 20 minutes when I try to use something from the aid tab. How they managed to fuck that up I’ll never know. That’s incredibly amateur to have that be a thing to begin with but to have it last through several patches? Jesus Christ.
---
Don’t you? Or are you just here for the pictures...
---
Seems like 24 players is a massive multiplayer game in todays standard. Ie - prepare to be downvoted for saying that FO76 isn't a MMO, don't asky me why, I don't get it too.
---
market76 is the ultimate pay to win. 100x more than FO1st. my first character hit lvl 50 and i came to market 76 and completely god rolled my character.  PVP, PVE, i have all the best gear and all i had to do was buy it.
---
i can't wait to be downvoted more so " Thank you for purchasing Fallout 76. The game will be applied directly to your Bethesda.net account. Please see the [F.A.Q.](https://fallout.bethesda.net/faq) and the [Fallout 76](https://fallout.bethesda.net/) page for more information. If you have not already, please download the launcher [here](http://download.cdp.bethesda.net/BethesdaNetLauncher_Setup.exe). " HAH
---
Is it the same size as the others?  Maybe I would just sit him on top, or use the hidden chest of drawers trick to have it inside a display, he could be just behind the others ready to go "BOO" to his brothers.
---
I see you completely miss the point. That folks are giving up is just a commonly accepted idea without any numbers to back it up, it is literally just hate and salt driven.
---
I can assure you half of those claiming to quit aren't really quitting, they are just karma grabbing, or they would have just quit silently, like I did a few months ago looking for an alternative that I didn't find.
---
And like me, a lot of people come back silently or just keep supporting the game through subs and Atoms, because we enjoy it.
---
Also any quick research around would prove you wrong about your numbers. Last time I checked, 30k people were active AND got all trophies on PS4. Which is but a small amount of total playerbase.
---
Speaking of modding, I just realized that Bethesda can release SDK for modding while maintaining the monopoly on server hosting. Then categorize the mods to 2 main categories similar to Killing Floor devs implemented - whitelisted and blacklisted. Whitelisted ones are mods that don't have exploits, while blacklisted ones contains exploits.
---
On servers with only whitelisted mods, players can use their public characters. While servers with at least one blacklisted mod can only create a separate character that only works on that server or copy one of their public characters but progression won't reflect on that public character. So modders and server owners can go crazy as much as they want if they don't care about vanilla gameplay.
---
Though this idea will take a lot of time and hard to implement. But with these, I'm sure players would increase a lot and Bethesda would earn lots of money more than their subscription-based system.
---
Fond memories of this game from back in the day. It ran amazingly on my Linux box (has native support). Glad to see it kicking, much like TF2.
---
Dont ever let reddit let you think that its a rep of the game community, or anything for that matter. Majority of posters dont own the game. 
---
Also its mostly a collective of western minds, chiefly the U.S.
---
If fallout 76 wasn't a broken mess, it might have millions of players and therefore millions of potential subscribers. But its a piece of shit game so it doesn't.
---
They also have millions of subscribers, the more subs you have, the cheaper costs them per person. And yours is a deal for college students, so you're in a very niche demographic. 
---
Albion online also looks cheaply made. It's pixelart for effs sake.
---
Online service games from AAA studios have been very near or at $15 a month for 15 years. 
---
If you already buy from the atom shop, subbing is the most cost effective method.
---
Very well done !
---
That’s what my camp would look like if all of the junk and stuff collected could be seen in-game
---
It's also DOTA 2
---
Nah, this has been happening at least as long as I've played this game, i.e. at least since Wild Appalachia.
---
Because there are server mergers you think noone is quitting? Lol you're naive.
---
That’s the way to go. Gaming is meant to be fun and if you’re having a good time, perfect!
---
To those who are complaining, stop. You guys are right about everything but life is too short to worry about crap you can’t control. If it stops you from having fun, move on to different games because Bethesda isn’t going to listen anyways. The devs might want to, but the marketing department sure as hell don’t. 
---
It’s quite obvious they’re trying to make a quick buck while they still can. We’re at a point where FO76 isn’t going to be improved anymore. I don’t think it will attract tons of new players and I don’t feel Wastelanders is going to do much more than a slight peak. 
---
I just hope this “experiment” of a game motivates them to create something a lot better in the near future because the concept was awesome and it does have a lot of potential when done right at launch.
---
Wow also has millions of subscribers and over a decade of infrastructure on a game that can play on a potato.
---
Servers have always merged, that does not mean anything if you don't know how many servers are up at any given time.
---
Next.
---
The subscription model is terrible.
---
Private Servers are basically bone existent. They essentially want to sell you private matchmaking as private servers which is a basic feature in all games.
---
The give you X amount of a fake currency instead of complet access to all cosmetic items in their shop. (They still selling virtual items way more expensive than their real world counterpart)
---
On top of that they constantly lie.
---
In the US, thats about average for a combo fast food meal..
---
Yep. I can manage my stash capacity just fine. But a shared stash of at least 100 capacity would be the most welcome addition to the game that Bethesda could make.
---
i don't know. if heard some pretty convincing estimates. and i've seen the posted sales numbers. don't take it personally. i've been a fallout fan for decades. i have a lot of hours in 76, and ya know what, i never once thought to myself, man this is a good game. it's always been bad. but i put up with it out of my love for the lore. i know Nobody who plays this game, and I know a lot of fallout fans. It's just sad at this point. To see the delusional defense of this game and this business model. You're allowed to enjoy it, I've enjoyed plenty of garbage games. But to call it a good game? to call it a fair business model? to be soooo delusional that you actually think fallout 1st is bringing in new players....???? come one man. enough.
---
What pay2win? The game has no meaningfull progression anyway.
---
Just use a VPN and set it to America, buy your sub then switch back.
---
oh.. and 30k active users is indie numbers my man. a true triple aaa game like say rdr2 has 800k active users.
---
1. Continuing to enjoy the game. Already received entertainment that is more than fair value for what I paid.  Additional content is simply “bonus”
---
Then why are you fucking playing it?
---
Also, it was a broken mess at release, that's why it doesn't have millions of players. Now it's a hot smaller mess.
---
between you all against who exactly? there are people who dislike the way they're taking the game, and don't support it, and then there're people who will support it and Bethesda, the way I see it those are the two sides.
---
So your argument is invalid :P
---
Seeing players doesnt mean anything
---
None of your fucking business how about that.
---
Reading your posts I think you should stop playing any games, Pokémon, battle bots and get a job.. it sounds like you have a money problem. I think making some actual money will also help your attitude problem
---
After all most of reddit is the place where ppl converge to throw fuel on the fire or to vomit salt at each other.
---
Sound list. Beth needs to expand the Atom Shop assortment, that's where the money is, not in weird subscriptions, pay-to-win objects and other nonsense. Money spent on skins and objects will not alienate anyone.
---
Places like WestTek where everyone farms legendaries is constantly in use. If you loiter in there too long exploring or reading terminals, etc., You are holding up others from using it.. Private servers allow you to take as much time as you want exploring, reading terminals, etc. uninterrupted and not feel like you are keeping people waiting.
---
Good do it yourself later. But know that a bf5 server for example will be way more expensive than a fallout server. There are way more interactions with the server than in fo76
---
Horse armour stand ?
---
The consequences of me avoiding mtx for 15 years hasn't changed anything in my favor, it'd be nearly as deluded for me to think me buying or not buying a sub will change much now. 
---
I might as well finally break on a game I truly enjoy with my partner.
---
No we don't need more assholes.
---
Things change, do you want a game with free content updates still able to provide those updates? Fo76 was expecting bigger sales, but they fucked up by releasing the game in November at all costs and this is where we are now.
---
"In the case of Fallout 76, 33.764 players completed the Photo Bomber trophy, which can be seen as 8,3 per cent of the player base once you log in to PSN. This is enough info to calculate that 100 per cent of the player base would be 406.795."
---
From an article a few months ago. A slight interest on the subject and a Google research can lead you to it.
---
$154 a year for wow classic, and you don't need to buy the base game either, once you have the subscription you have access to classic, you're getting that confused with retail, i'm not justifying their price either, i have found myself in multiple arguments with other wow players on how blizzard doesn't need that much money, and that with pretty much any other MMORPG you will not find prices nearly that high.
---
But keep in mind when you actually buy the game you're not gonna see paywalled features that should have already been in the game to begin with, you're getting the entire game 100%, it's properly coded, the bug count is extremely low and hard to notice, and the amount of cheaters are so low you'll maybe see one or two for every 2 months, you're getting a **very expensive** product that is **very good in quality.**
---
&gt;If addictive equals good, then mobile games are objectively the best games on the planet.
---
I never said addictive equals good, you had constructed a strawman and tried to put words into my mouth, i implied the game was good and its addictiveness was an aspect of it.
---
Also i could apply your logic of "Developed by psychologists" to literally any critically acclaimed game to exist in the entire world because technically all of those inherently have some level of addictiveness to them.
---

---
How about you cry more? Get the fuck over yourself you pretentious dick!
---
Being from the UK I understood the joke but I got frustrated with it, decided to take a break and come back later, had to do the whole mission again 😩
---
And what is yours? You don't like to have to ask for 15 dollars to play the sub, so the game must burn?
---
Mark my words...you are a moron.
---
Its like when they added the weapon naming feature, I waited months before doing that.
---
It has nothing to do with delusions and expectations. I am talking about what I experience when I log in, which is something most of the haters over here don't even do.
---
pathetic numbers for a 100mill plus 'aaa' game. you realize that is global right? you realize that's like 1/30th of fallout 4 users when it was a year old? i now realize you're not really reading my comments because in my first post i gave a generous estimate of 40k active users. you come back at me with less than that to try to convince me the game is growing? peace out dude. you obviously have a narrative that you must defend at any intellectual cost.
---
If you run your private world, there's less lag and the game feels smoother. That's the only advantage I can get behind. You can't change any parameters of your world though, so it's just like a regular session, but all players have left somehow.
---
Imo, the forward camp is cheating, the infinite scrap container is not necessary if you minimally manage your junk (bulking and selling unneeded bulks to vendor), emotes I don't even use and the ranger armor is just a skin and that's it.
---
You also get some Atoms to spend but for me there's nothing interesting in the shop for now.
---
yeah. servers are getting better. less traffic will do that.
---
In addition to pilfering the cores from fusion generators and power armor spawns, as others have already stated, there are also fusion core spawns. [Mappalachia](https://imgur.com/a/4Js8sCY) has a map for those [here](https://i.imgur.com/41AnQwB.jpg).
---
You’re displaying literal cognitive dissonance lmao
---
Hmm ok in europe/austria its 6 - 9 euro depending on the size 😉
---
I can say you must be a true Appalachian, look at that run on sentence, lack of knowledge your surroundings (based on your comment to me), and seem hard up on money if 100 dollars for a year is rough.
---
Agree with the OP.  It’s a different feeling to roam alone and experience the world and the stories as they were designed to be experienced.   
---
Leveled mobs is important - remember the WhiteSprings holotape quests at level 9-12?  
---
Also, having good-intentional help from other players is not always appreciated.  I remember fighting my first ScorchBeast at level 35. It was a very tough fight - almost epic :)! And it could go either way... until I was “saved” by a higher level player with good intentions.
---
I don't need to convince you, that's a fact regardless of your opinion.
---
You’re a dumb little bootlicker that justifies his actions by calling others out on what you yourself are doing, you hypocritical moron. By all means, ruin it for yourself, but don’t push down others with you.
---
Is anyone streaming this stuff?
---
I would have liked it more if the game hadn't crashed every time I was close to getting to the checkpoint.  Stupid overlay issue.
---
It is at this point clear you guys only wanna see the world burn. You don't even seem to read.
---
yes. i agree. under 40k active users at any given time. down from a peak of 400k active users as reported by bethesda months ago. sub 40k is a sign of a game on it's deathbed. but yeah. it's a fact you don't need to convince me of that.
---
&gt;"just wait, the game will get better" 
---
Sunk cost fallacy? Not wanting to be mean, but out of the fo76 community is mainly what it seems.
---
I don't see facts, I only see you giving random counts.
---
I got the game cheap and started playin on xbox a couple months ago. been enjoying it. I just grind for atoms each week for items I want. I am not giving them any money. Unlimited storage should be for everyone.
---
dude. i said the game is failing coz it has under 40k active users. you spit at the month that 'no, it has 33k active users it's a success'. you are dim. you don't even know what you're arguing. you're just yelling into the wind at this point.
---
I didnt see this one here but might have missed it:
---
If you have remapped your forward movement to the "T" key you no longer can walk forward and use your selection wheel at the same time. I think it has to do with the fact that "T" is now the hot key in the wheel for the forward camp option.
---
what are my random counts? i gave the game more credit than you did. 40k is a higher number than 33k buddy.
---
So true, I knew as  soon as the subscription was announced with private world's being locked there that this was Bethesda yet AGAIN trying to capitalize on mods!
---
It's easy to see it coming now. In the beginning they said private world's and modding were coming later. And mods can't be in a public server of course! They can only work in a private world where all the player synch modlists and jump in! So forget making you pay for the private world, this was never about that, it's was always about getting people to pay for modding. 
---
So why has it taken so long??? Well we now know it's because they've been planning and plotting how they can make us pay money for modding capabilities. 
---
They sure do know what keeps people playing their games for years and they will never give up trying to create a screen between the player and modding functionality that acts as an overpriced toll booth. People PLEASE stop giving these companies money. It's not right. What they are doing is NOT RIGHT.
---
Hell I wouldn't be surprised if they left certain things broken because they know an UNOFFICIAL PATCH will get released which will in turn require the subscription for the mod. Pigs, they've fallen so far.
---
Yes uninstall the game and reinstall it 50 times then give Bethesda 500 dollars
---
Are you... shitting me...
---
Europe is looking better all. The. Time.
---
It can be ridiculously expensive here. More work hours, less pay per hour, more expensive.
---
I don't play it. I got fucked over with the PA edition at launch, played for a few weeks, gave up, came back a couple months ago, hoping there was improvements and was sorely disappointed. All the while, watching the shitshow from the sidelines.
---
Okay? Congrats on being a lower lifeform that pays to get fucked in the ass lmao
---
Thanks for proving yourself as a troll!
---
Read again.
---
:) well summarized 
---
Thank you for the smile
---
What defines a good and a bad game is very subjective. I love this game despite the countless bugs and technical problems. The only thing that could make me quit it is more p2w elements. I realize that a company needs incomes to keep developing content for a game like f76 and 1st ensures that. As long as 1st only provides unlimited junk space and an extra fast traveling point, I don't think it'll make the game less enjoyiable for non paying users. Hope Bethesda stops there honeslty.
---
You mean...? So that's where all my bullets have been going? I thought it was a game-breaking glitch.
---
Exactly what side is everyone on the same one as? Because there's two very distinct sides to this game these days.
---
I missed that.  Got any idea where I can find their statement on that?
---
Nuke the rich
---
You are crazy if you think that many people will pay 100 dollars a year. 
---
Or you’re just saying the game has a super small, but dedicated fanbase.
---
You are actually fucked up in the head. Imagine someone killing themselves over a video game. Big yikes on you
---
[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rip-off\_Britain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rip-off_Britain) refers to a practice called "Easy Conversion" where  $  is simply replaced by a  £ when setting prices. 
---
&gt; At its launch, Microsoft Windows Vista had a suggested retail price  of $249 (£127) in the United States and £249 ($487) in the United  Kingdom. This made it almost twice as expensive to buy in the UK than in  the U.S. 
---
It's a stupid (and stupidly common) practice.
---
&gt;!https://i.imgflip.com/2qerll.jpg!&lt;
---
it is amazing how many people out there don't understand this simple fact man. jeebus.
---
Being that Heart of the Swamp is part of the public events cycle and they are happening more often....
---
You mean the "technical reasons" limiting the stash? Well I found [Pete Hines's quote on it](https://twitter.com/dcdeacon/status/1059818122969051142?lang=en) saying there are important reasons (though that may have been a bit ambiguous) and I found [this article](https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2018-11-17-fallout-76-to-get-much-needed-stash-limit-increase-soon) directly quoting technical reasons as the limiting factor. Not sure where Eurogamer got their info but I'd wager it's a valid source.
---
ya display your first ones. you will find doubles or find them also at players vendors. some people will sell them cheap. just use the doubles you find or buy
---
not really all that subjective. estimates are that 76 cost around 100million to make. the highest estimate i've ever seen for sales is 2.6 million. game is frequently on sale for around 20 bucks. it may have turned a profit. but there is no one out there saying this was an effective profitable game. fallout 4 sold what, 10 million copies in first year? You're allowed to love the game. I love fallout, I hate this game. I want to fail miserably so that the franchise is sold to a better developer. This won't happen of course...but I can dream. Just don't sit here and argue with me that sub 40k numbers are a sign of success. because that's just ridiculous.
---
If its fun keep playing if its not fun stop playing shits really simple people just have a problem figuring it out.
---
True
---
That’s a great partisan marketing strategy... and it works
---
Goes directly to OW target group, costs almost nothing, provides excellent results
---
Imagine thinking fallout 76 qualifies as triple A...
---
Whoa dude... WHAT IF this is only one sick experiment on society conducted by Vault Tec?!?
---
It's a company ruining something I love out of greed. That's good enough for me.
---
I just wonder why you're still here and not currently solving world hunger or something.
---
read again. I said 40k, folks are leaving. You said 33k, sign of growth. You apparently don't understand numbers.
---
What kind of Question ist that? Why would i write or care about a game I haven’t played?
---
I agree. I'm one of the few who do not think Fallout first is totally negative because private servers are costing money and I understand that they need money to keep the game running for the long term with otherwise free updates and extensions.
---
But I can fully agree that private servers should be enough and the rest should be in the basegame.
---
Dude same, I hang around to see how bad it gets. But I also feel compelled to try and convince more people to jump ship. It's been uninstalled for months but I just recently uninstalled the beth launcher.
---
But OP is only at the beginning, there is no places where everyone farms.
---
I don't get where all that "pressure" comes from. My gameplay was same as OP on private server, except on public. Slow, reading everything I can, stealthy sneaking in flowers and stuff
---
That's called psychopathy.
---
Triple A refers more to the size and influence  of a gaming company more than the polish or quality of a game.
---
I’ve been very vocal on here in losing my shit in the stash box. Still have a open ticket &amp; junk has not been returned.
---
That said - the hot fix they did seemed to have fixed the box. I had no junk to lose after the box ate my junk, but happy to report the box seems like it is working properly now. 
---
I’m still weary after any patch or hotfix they will do of course...
---
No one said that the people mad were jealous
---
I feel you there. They claim the Atom Shop wasn't doing well with just cosmetics. Well duh, there was so much boring trash in there that nobody cared. Give us cool stuff! Like Maxson's battlecoat! If the Ranger Armor was in the Atom Shop at launch you can bet your butts that the Atom shop would have raked in 5 times the cash.
---
This dude is talking out of his ass. a combo is like 6-9 dollars
---
It is simple. Games used to be “democratic” - every gamer had one vote - either to buy a game or not - and games were made to convince you to buy them. Now every one has as much votes as they have money to spend on that given game - a games are made to make you spend that money. Now imagine if your vote in election was multiplied by the amount of money you are willing to support an candidate. How would that work out ? There would no longer be any democracy in that. Capitalism is not democracy - they are not creating games based on what most people want, but based on what makes them the best profit.
---
Paid subscriptions does necessarily guarantee any of the pro’s listed
---
It's not complicated, and Bethesda is not good at subterfuge.
---
The only thing triple A about this game is the budget they wasted on mass advertising which would've been better spent developing the game for 6 months more.
---
Think I'll play it safe and just keep the junk on my mules
---
Bethesda fans have a weird habit of just calling people stupid without actually being smart.
---
I would. Just empty all your junk from main to mules &amp; Any new junk you get throw in the box. That way you aren’t risking much....
---
Bummer, sorry to hear about that.  Maybe in another 4 months. Haha.
---
Aight let me process this for you then, since it looks like you lack the computational resources to compute it.
---
The article mentions how only 30k had that achievement completed, projecting total playerbase to 400k. That was just for PSN. Now, you would like to know that also Xbox and PC exist. Let us assume just 10% of that population is active, just as a wild guess which could pretty much be low balling the real count.
---
Let us take that into account for all three platform, that would give roughly 120k active players. Is it monster numbers? No, of course not, but it is just a guess. Is it enough to keep a game alive? Pretty much yes, I've played games with much less active playerbase which are still very much alive (B&amp;S, Neverwinter, SWTOR). Yea the game is new and Bethesda is an AAA company and bla bla bla, but if the game goes on then it goes on. If you prefer RDR2 then go play RDR2, why do you even care?
---
Yeah, Bethesda is such a tiny, small, underfunded indie company that needs the extra cash.
---
No.  They’re scum who shat out an abortion of a game but are still making the players pay child support.
---
I was really excited about Outer Worlds, but thought I'd watch some gameplay before I bought it. Unfortunately it mostly seems to be a long progression of endless talking heads. It's probably more fun when you're the one making the decisions, but it's looking pretty dull tbh. And I don't like the art style much either.
---
I might give it a go sometime, but I'll wait for a sale.
---
Nerd alert*   j/k I would've added you but I'm on Xbox
---
Whats 1st abo
---
Yeah I hate fishing so I'm subbed to all the fishing threads.
---
&gt;I'm not some butthurt hater
---
way to downplay this whole shitshow as players fault - like players are butthurt for no reason and are "just" haters
---
Look. Outrage is the new normal. Exactly how is Bethesda suppose to keep the game afloat without some kind of funds coming in?  
---
And before you beat your head against a wall while screaming like some wild animal about it should have been right day one 
---
(no. You’re right. It should’ve been— but this is where we are. No going back in time and fixing it now) 
---
I would rather they kept fighting forward in hopes of making Wastelanders a great expansion than just throw their hands up and just let it die. 
---
When Andromeda came out it was beat to death online by both butt-hurt fan boys and professional cry babies (yong yea for example)
---
So the developers just kill it right off the bat and let it go. I have all the mass effect games and the dlcs. I would rather have them try to fix the problems than just kill it. 
---
And if I want to spend my money I’m gonna spend it. It’s why I work. So I can buy what I want.
---
&gt;It is in addition to mtx, but again, buy 12.99 of atoms here and there and you get a better share of atoms than buying atoms alone.
---
  
---
If you actually buy atoms, sure, but the people regularly buying atoms is in the minority.
---
&gt;And what's still currently broken in the game? Quite a lot has been fixed over a year, hasn't it?
---
A lot has been fixed, esp many of the critical issues.  However, the game was so horribly broken on launch that there's still plenty of things that are broken, notably server performance and D/C's are **still** a problem.  Furthermore, many of the issues are similar to issues that were never fixed in FO4, but the problem here is it takes me less than a second to quick load and fix a bug in FO4, it takes 2-3 minutes to reconnect in FO76.  So yes, they've improved a lot, but it's still a mess.  Even as-is after a year of fixes it's still more broken than most games on release **in addition** to the fact that the entire game is basically a developer-mod of FO4.  We'll see if wastelanders can launch without re-introducing all the bugs (or new ones) but I highly doubt it.
---
&gt;Trail of lies... From what I understand, they said free dlcs, cosmetic mtx, and likely paid servers early on.
---
I mean, this is the thing.    Fallout 1st is a sub that adds things to the game...things that would normally be considered a DLC in most games.  They broke the cosmetic only MTX promise which **again** might not be so bad if it wasn't bundled with nerfs (i.e. they nerfed durability perks right before the scrap kit, and food spoil rates right before the fridge).  There aren't one-ofs and will continue to happen as long as we write it off and let them again away with it.  
---
They didn't say paid servers early on, they said they'd look into private servers after a year or longer.  Private servers also **aren't** private servers.  They are neither private nor are they your own server.  It's just a hot-swapped server with a player-limit that gives access to the friends of anyone on the server with a fallout 1st membership.  It goes down when you log off (it isn't persistent) and it can give you a half-killed half-looted server.  If you're the only person on your server and you DC, it will give you a brand new server when you log back in (because once again, its not *actually* a dedicated private server, its one of their hot-swap servers with a player cap of 8 and some brief limitations).  People **wanted** either Co-op fallout or dedicated servers so we could mod them and **host** a server for our friends.  Instead we got some pathetic excuse for them reselling their current server space because the game bombed so horribly that all the server space they bought was wasting away.
---
So yeah, a trail of lies.  They've lied again and again and again.  They have proven they are as untrustworthy as they come, and have no meaning behind anything they say.  At best anything they say is a 'we'll maintain this if its convenient for us'.  That's ultra shitty and shows they aren't even willing to invest into their own IPs.  It's similar to what EA did with Anthem where they didn't want to fully develop the game unless the community blindly adopted the IP first.
---
&gt;I mean, a sub for private servers alone seemed to go hand in hand.
---
Again, details matter here.  **Yes** there should be a monthly service fee for dedicated server hosting.  Ofc, this has been the norm in gaming for years.  **However** they aren't offering dedicated server hosting **and** they're attaching bonuses - borderline P2W type stuff, obviously this isn't 'true P2W' heavy advantages but this is the stuff that games slip in right *before* they start adding the legitimately P2W stuff.
---
Todd Howard just shit himself from laughing so hard.
---
Nice what are other spots you gonne visit?
---
I like the fallout franchise. And had hoped that 76 would end up decent.
---
Spoiler Warning: It didn't.
---
I have a theory that they released this early so it'll piss everyone off - but nobody **really** wants to play the game **right now** so it's less immediately problematic.  Yeah I'm annoyed but I'm not playing this garbage atm.  I suspect they're hoping people settle more before wastelanders hits - when we'll actually have a real incentive to play.
---
Never said it was successful and I actually agree that it could have been (and could be) a much better game. However, we all know that Bethesda is not going to sell the IP, so we can enjoy what we have while trying to do constructive crticism or bitch endlessly and get nothing in return.
---
yes. it's been reported that peak usage hit 450k actually. so, you're telling me that you actually believe 30k trophies on psn equates to 400k users at at any given moment? that's way off bub. every breakdown i've heard puts the reality sub 40k. but we'll see. if the game is near peak again then this sub should be blowing up, lets watch as the users here double this weeK!!! oh i can't wait for all my friends to log back in and start calling me up to play! this is great! the game is fixed!! thanks for telling me. Keep pushing your narrative. I can see how it's shaking it, and I'll see if I'm wrong. Wrong or right seems unlikely anything will change in your view. cheers.
---
I grew up in WV, but recently went back home to visit family.  I decided to take some time to visit some IRL FO76 places so I hope you enjoy the pictures!  I have a LOT of pictures, so I'm breaking this up into different albums so it's not overwhelming.  Part 1 is all about Helvetia.  I had never been here before so I wanted to see just how similar it was in real life.  
---
Pictures include: Community Hall, Star Band Hall, Swiss Hutte Restaurant, Honey Haus, Cheese Haus, Library, Church, Post Office, Fasnacht Masks, Creeks/Bridges around the community.
---
Yeah I feel that
---
r/fo76: Where's my thanks for spending my time and money and patience defending the game?
---
Bethesda: [thanks](https://youtu.be/bR68F6_4IY4)
---
It says CPD on it: Charleston police department, NCR ranger armour is LAPD riot gear It’s obviously not exclusive to them as we can see that the US Marines and The 11th armoured cavalry regiment both use the Armour which came with the duster so probably has some sort of fire retardant material in it, so it’s not impossible for them to have have it especially with all the protests going on there. People are just calling it the NCR Ranger armour because it’s the most recognisable form of this armour
---
Well it seems much less unlikely that random Reddit user knows how to keep an AAA game alive better than Bethesda. Cheers.
---
The big thing about the Fallout 1st membership that a lot of people aren't getting mad enough about is that they're selling **nothing**.  It took no work for them to implement it - the 'private' servers are just the normal hot-swap servers slightly adjusted.  They're just selling excess server space because they (wrongly) predicted the game would do better.  All the other bonuses are also easily adjusted things (again, Fallout 1st item storage might actually cause problems if more people were playing the game, while material items are stored in a manner where it doesn't matter if you have 1 or 1000, it still frees up space for items that are harder to store - like weapons/etc that are all essentially unique - at least in how their data is stored and transmitted).
---
Your ideas aren't bad OP, but they'd actually have to sit down and do some work for those.
---
you're such a cutie. carry-on now.
---
Canadian or USD?
---
Get in there. I've played most days since the Beta. Great fun.
---
No one is going to buy starfield now though especially when you take into account that it uses the same engine.
---
Oh wow, it's almost as if all those people with Atom Shop items got them through free atoms...
---
I completely disagree with Bethesda on their P2W Shop items; that doesn't mean I'm not going to buy them with my earned atoms. Why would I do that?
---
For future reference, /s means "end sarcasm'', it means what comes before was a joke.
---
this dude ^ go to bed.
---
OP --&gt; MVP
---
From the context and the hundred euros I'd say it's the full year private server and monthly atoms
---
I love it!!!!
---
&gt;Its bullshit people are being singled out for this.
---
**Is it**?  They're actively participating in creating a worse experience for everyone by supporting this.  Unless you're a whale that wants everything to go P2W, it makes sense that they're getting ostracized.  You're a fool if you think its going to stop with a fridge and a sub.
---
That just sounds like me doing stuff around my camp
---
let's be real, you are Jonesboro for drama since Walking dead fell off
---
op was spamming me and i got confused who was replying to me. class-action could get bethesda sell. but there's no luck. outer worlds is good tho. plenty of other games. i've actually just gave up fallout completely. this sub is still amusing as it is infuriating tho.
---
Yea I remember WoW at release, wasn't any less buggy than FO76 :P
---
Also, where's the comparison to the epic mounts only available in the blizzard shop for real money? Been like that for what, 10 years?
---
Will do.
---
I just started it and it seems to have a lot of substance to the story which can be kinda rare in fo76
---
I've not been playing much recently but gonna get back into it after a few more settlements need my help in FO4.  swalesey82 :)
---
when you have to bash another game to feel good about playing yours.  pew pew pew
---
"Agree with me or your delusional"
---
Good.

"it made me realize how good Bethesda games are."
---
"it's no where close to being on the same level as an elder scrolls or fallout game."

&gt; Oh wow, it's almost as if all those people with Atom Shop items got them through free atoms... 
---
I would like to know when was it that I stated otherwise.
---
The mayor of watoga?
---
It's like giving a broke alcoholic money and hoping they don't spend it on booze. If you wanted to help them and the community you don't enable bad behavior
---
Hard to say because its not *actually* a private server, but a normal hot-swap server with slightly adjusted settings...which almost certainly means that 'modding' will just be some simple-specific functions like you mentioned, unless the way they implemented private-servers is just a place-holder but I highly doubt that considering they're already charging people money but - then again, they did that to all of us when they released the game.
---
I bought it. I enjoy it. If you get this worked up over something like this, never take on any real responsibility in your life. 
---
I am actively harming the game by buying Fallout 1st? Okay... you realize subscriptions in games has been around for a long time, right? Imagine you bought World of Warcraft for $50 when it came out and found out you had to pay monthly to just log in. Guess if Reddit was around in 2005 and the Outrage Bois were in full effect like they are now, people would have tried to boycott Blizzard back then. 
---
And, ESO has had an optional sub for over 4 years. It's literally what Fallout 1st is modeled off of. The world hasn't ended, and ESO does quite well. So, while I appreciate your "love" for Fallout, you're way off base dude.
---
lol Forest hunters? where?
---
Yeah they're more or less selling basic functions that should have been in the base game.
---
Is it still equivalent of 13 USD in Lithuania? I'd imagine it was lower and they'd restrict western europe from buying the subscription, just like western europe can't buy it in USD.
---
Why sub to something you genuinely don't like? Just curious.
---
I like football, but I sure as fuck aren't going to sub to the Cowboys subreddit.
---
Your entire post is implying that people are being hypocritical by criticizing P2W then buying into it, when that is clearly not the case very often.
---
You can host your own server in Minecraft for free.
---
If Bethesda wasn't a bunch for of greedy fucks, we could do the same in FO76.
---
You don't buy the Outfit with Atoms dude.
---
I never said that. You included the scrap bot and fridge in your title, when those are the most common things, and are the things that can be earned.
---
The worst part is that they **nerfed** the durability perk cards prior to releasing scrap kits.  So not only are they implementing early-P2W/slope items, but they're also bending the base game around the P2W shit they want to add.
---
I'll be posting pics of:

There are free ways to play with yourself, using the internet.
---
Great reply, couldn't explain it better.
---
Sorry but I refuse to purchase this shit. So idk how it looks
---
What is that $3 premium over exchange rate for?
---
Okay
---
I think Zenimax is the one pushing BGS to do this, so they can earn more money to get more investors. This guy explains it much better than i could: https://youtu.be/qJt_i2_vsSw
---
The moment they force this on me i will have to visit the head office with a protest sign in my hand
---
This guy is part of the small fraction of the player base that makes mtx and all this bull\*\*\* so lucrative. It will never go anywhere.
---
I think it's assumed if you bought a 60 dollar video game and own a gaming system you're not starving.
---
That said I skip Spotify for the same reason, I could buy a nice cheap meal or two and if prefer that.
---
You didn't read anything of the above, did you ?
---
So what you're saying is pay Bethesda a bit more and you can avoid greifers who use loop holes in game mechanics to ruin everyone else's game? And here I was thinking the other day, before all this blew up, should I finally get F76? I think the answer is still a solid no based on some of these comments.
---
&gt; There is so much useless trash that costs way too much money to distract you.
---
Just like the real world :D
---
Jokes aside, I agree. I've recently created a new character with the intent to keep it a "street-level" criminal. So no facilities, no offices etc. and legit money only. Well, the frequency of calls and messages you get to buy the various businesses is annoying to me, but I think it would be overwhelming and disorienting for a new player in 2019.
---
I would love a reply from an official BGS/Fo76 Rep. not the vault-tec rep tho.
---
F*** no lmao
---
The game is and always has been pointless, boring, and intentionally designed to give you a frustrating experience if you dont buy microtransactions. 
---
- I've never played a more unrewarding game in my life. 
---
-The graphics are terrible (ps4 pro, sony ms a9 oled, and it still look worse than ps3 games were, especially inside buildings)
---
- it still crashes constantly
---
"This game sucks, it's not fun at all", I'd say it outloud to myself every time I stopped playing it to throw in another game. I mean literally every single time. I gave it a chance, and then some, really wanted to like it.
---
I pre-ordered the game last year, my 1 character is at level 16 I think. I have 4 different game saves in fo4 with levels &gt;150, 2 on survival. That right there should tell you how terrible and not fun fo76 is.
---
Everyone telling you it's a good game works for Bethesda. They're all over this sub. ALL OVER IT.
---
You must be bored
---
Why ? Didn't they brake every promise until now ?
---
I dont play MMOs .
---
 FO76 failed as an experiment the moment they made the subscription fee .
---
An already created camp? That would be worth it?
---
Gotta try and educate the ignorant even if its a lost cause.
---
Australia tax.
---
This is a whole lot of lonely guy with no income rage. Maybe better life choices? I dunno I’ll just go play the game some more and wait for this to die down until folks are actually talking about the game again and not just one rant after another. Me and my evil subscription will be just fine.
---
Cool thank you I didn't know that either.
---
Ok so guessing this is a widely known issue and just part of the engine itself then?
---
It’s not that distracting, mostly checking to make sure it wasn’t something on my end
---
Honestly I am not sure about price but I am guessing it's around 15 euros converted from USD + tax. 
---
Maybe couple euros less but it doesn't change my point.
---
Using consumable, playing with other players in short, getting to the endgame is pretty unreliable, reading your post i just made a ticket about the Legacy weapons ( Energy explosives ones and Vault 94 PA bugs ) to the support and hope to get answers, i guess "we" have more chance to see bug fixes with reddit visibility than the support itself, all we need is proper upvote, i guess...
---
I use to play this with a longbeast something, he unfriended me.
---
I mean, real talk, 15 years ago I was paying, what, 13 bucks a month (around there) for Everquest. Had been since 1999, 20 years ago. So, the idea of a subscription based online game, even if the sub is optional, really isn't that wild to me. Even something like a battle pass, I know they're in a lot of games, but the only one I am personally familiar with is Apex Legends... it's like an (optional) 15 bucks for, what, two months or so? For a free game? Eh, not a huge deal to me.   
---
No. My problem isn't that they added an optional subscription model to their game. It's how they did it, and the *timing* of it. What they added for subscription, what they have not fixed or changed for those who are not paying, the wild amount of bugs, an end game I personally don't find very interesting or fleshed out, etc, etc. If they'd announced this with a content filled Wastelanders update? I might feel differently. As it stands, it just feels like another ill thought out cash grab. (Yes, yes, companies want to make money, I understand that.) I'm sure there are some people out there who find it worth it, but for me, it's just left a bad taste in my mouth. Again.
---
People can spend money however they want dude. Keep your anger directed at Zenimax and not other players. I don't think it's fair to tell the subscribers that they're killing video games. 
---
On the whole I really don't like this Us vs Them mentality that's coming in directed at the players who have subscribed or don't mind the service as a thing.
---
You didnt help them, you just supporter a shitty business practice. They prey on morons who think they actually do this for the players, amd theres absolutely no amount of justification that proves other wise. You gave a greedy company that has been effing its community since day 1 a ton of money thats it.
---
That's the "Fuck You, Australia" tax that is applied to all digital transactions.
---
But is it worth 144$ a year lmao
---
Bethesda understands what its doing perfectly well. You clearly dont. Have a good day!
---
Are you actually studying business? Please tell me you're in your first year, because this pretty badly laid out and argued. Points 9-13 are just a bunch of subclauses that you've labelled as main points. There's a lot of assumptions presented as fact as well, which isn't great either.
---
I mean, if it was an FTP game or something that I picked up off GamePass, I'd actually be fine with it, but I spent $80 on buying this thing.
---
I paid full price but I absolutely haven’t stuck with it lol. Only 32 hours played since launch.
---
Can confirm - you get prompt message that someone send you Friend request, but on the list there is no one with the dot to accept it. I need to manually send invitation for game to accept. I don't know what is worse - this or before the patch when I had to quit and reload game to accept/add anyone...
---
It's not "amazing", it's solid. It does certain things right, like the dialog options and choices in Quests, but it also does certain things not so good.
---
If you had to buy the game, ps/xbox subscription and the Fallout 1st? Don't think game wouldn't last too long.
---
The only thing I mildly disagree with here is that nuclear winter was unpopular on launch.  Loads of people loved it at launch!  The problems began about a month later when the cheating, the lack of "shiny new mode", and the staleness of battle royale set in and now people are bored with it and we've gotten nothing but patch after patch of them fixing their game rather than add new content. 
---
Thats what drove me away. I'm not going to sit here and farm the same events and enemies for legendary gear for the next 3 to 4 months until we get some actual new content. I've already told all the people that I know who play that if wastelanders doesn't deliver in some extreme ways, I'll be heading out.
---
Remember that with this kknd of shit 1% of the olayers makes 99% of the money m, it needs vzry little purchasers to make it a profit. 
---
Heck I very roughly guess 1000 buyers would be enough to pay off the dev time put in the subscription service.
---
&gt;3: An Eye-Bot that follows us around playing some of that sweet music.
---
I'd love an insult Eye-Bot. Trails behind you, critiques your work constantly.
---
If i share with you my ball pit, will you share your dollar with me?
---
It's a solid RPG, but people here seem to overrate it.
---
13 dollars is 78 turkish liras. For 78 liras I can eat 4 meals, it is a lot for a monthly subscription when I pay 80 liras for netflix, origin access, spotify and game pass(discounted for a while) combined. Make it a year and I can buy 3 new games with that money 2 of them being AAA
---
Yeah, it looks like the same size as the normal one's. I put it on the bed so it looks like I'm hoping it when I sleep.
---
FallOutFirst players being targeted??? Im ONLY lvl72 and not a Fallout First subscriber, got wiped out after a level 717 FalloutFirst player that decided he wanted to take Dolly Sods from me. I only took it get the achievement for taking 20 workshops. Kudos to you douchebag! Enjoy my teddybears!!
---
Wastelanders will be fo76first only is my guess. Or at least some access only available to subscribers.
---
Oof. Man that really sucks. I wish I knew a fix but I haven't been successful enough to finish the raids for the plans. Hope you find help though.
---
You are part of the problem as to why Bethesda has become so utterly greedy and has pulled all the shit that they have over the last year and a bit.
---
Stop buying overpriced shit in the Atom store, and stop buying an overpriced subscription (it costs MORE than the game did for a year!). This is just enabling them and their shitty behavior.
---
I only agree with 5 and 6, those shouldn't be monetized. 
---
I don't mind if the armor mannequins would be buyable.
---
Anyone who graduated from a business school would never ever said that they studies "business". You're embarassing, OP.
---
The Australian, UK and Euro prices are all very similar when accounting for currency conversion. The US price is much cheaper than all three.
---
Bethesda did so many bad decisions marketing wise with fallout 76, that even someone with 0 knowledge about economics and marketing can clearly see, that I just can shake my head. 
---
I mean, there must be people making those decisions, that are experts on these fields. How can they be so wrong??
---
And it's not, like they doing nothing. The even invest many resources for something, that can only harm the company in long terms.
---
Such amateurs
---
Hi OP, In the world of the internet, it is a bad idea to think that a Reddit or forum represents a siginifcant portion of the player base, as you have...
---
No. Don't listen to the echo chamber.
---
Bethesda has taken something that I love (Fallout) and shat all over it. They have lied and now they have pulled a swifty and it's P2W. The game is a hot buggy mess.
---
It's a shame.
---
But you didn't pay to play Warframe. You just downloaded it.
---
What? How does that make any sense at all? Reddit is a minority compared to the actual player base of the game, for all games. People actually playing the game are buying Fallout 1st left and right. Spending any amount of time playing will show you that. People bought a scrap bot en masse as well. 
---
Servers are still full on Xbox One. People post all night long that they are selling shit or doing SBQ/Encryptid or whatever and their servers fill up fast.
---
But, yeah only 10 people still play. At 2 am EST there were over 100 lfg posts on the Xbox One Fallout club of people doing those things in the game. Maybe that's just 10 people with 10 accounts each? Well, that can't be, because at noon, there were over 300 lfg posts. So those 10 people had 30 accounts each, and are just really dedicated to the lie, huh?
---
I'm pretty ignorant about this so can someone explain why it would cost more in other countries if it's paid online and not a delivery service?
---
2 am EDT happens when this comment is 21 hours and 25 minutes old.
---
You can find the live countdown here: https://countle.com/JC5TlvOMY
---
I'm a bot, if you want to send feedback, please comment below or send a PM.
---
That's kinda of flawed logic. What you're actually seeing is that about 50% of the people *who are still playing*  have subscription content. A lot of the people who are here on reddit, expressing their displeasure, have stopped playing because of FU1st.
---
My point is that whatever is the way you decide to play the game, you do it sticking to it without whining. I never called anyone out for being hypocritical.
---
My emote wheel ( and weapons wheel ) is pretty whack at the moment. (PC)
---
Never said I was starving or in proverty but I'm certainly not making bank
---
On the other hand, 1st players are able to sell high numbers of rare materials for dirt cheap.
---
I used to craft and sell stable flux for about 300 caps a piece, now that premiums can nuke Whitesprings and keep all the monsters to themselves I;ve seen more and more 1st CAMPS with hundreds of flux for sale for 75/100 caps or little more. 
---
Nobody buys from me anymore, and I don't have access to infinite stabilising materials. I can never hope to keep up with their new power over the market.
---
uhm, no, i am annoyed that Bethesda (and the game industry at large) just straight up ignores exchange rates. Right now, 1 $ = 0.9 € and usually prices are the same, 20$ and 20€. Meaning, i actually pay 22$. This might sound petty but no so long ago, 1 $ was worth 0.8 €, meaning i had to pay 20% extra.
---
I have moved everything over except my fluxes for the time being.
---
Still trying to work out what the pay for play is for??
---
Is the game any different on a 'private' server apart from having less interaction with other players?
---
Except anger at Zenimax doesn't do any good? All they care about is $$$ so if people don't give them that then they listen. If not then.
---
Whether you like it or not the sad fact and reality is if enough people pay for this sub that it's a financial success, Zenimax and other publishers won't hesitate for a second to try implementing it in other games. That's what they do. So yes unfortunately if you support this you are in fact killing gaming for everyone else. There's no way around it. Supporting bad monetization practises is giving the green light to all of these companies to throw it in everywhere. That's how we're here today after all. 
---
And the "us vs them" mentality exists because it literally is us vs them.
---
It’s $20.69 in Canada. So yeah, pretty much.
---
I guess I should update my post, I honestly thought it went without saying but subs for MMORPG's are 100% okay and preferred IMO. But then a huge fully fledged MMORPG is completely different from a more common game like fallout 76 anyways. 
---
It is a cash grab though you're totally right. A dangerous one.
---
hahah imagine buying the game for full price yet year later, they asking you for membership fee hahah
---
Join the thieves guild
---
That's terrible logic. You don't have to enjoy 100% of anything to do it. People who are complaining while still playing have every right to do so. I already paid for the game, why would I rob myself of the enjoyment that still exists just because of Bethesda's shittiness?
---
Let me guess, didn't read the post hey?
---
Ahh I see. So that's what going on. Thanks a bunch for that info.
---
Nope, not a coincidence. I have definitely been seeing this also.
---
That's not how servers work...
---
I like the fallout franchise. And I was hoping that the game would get better.
---
Not really, this is capitalism, it's society, it's our western world (insert Joker meme here). Winners and losers, in real life you get a bigger house, more cars and hotter girlfriend if you are successful. 
---
They are trying to bring that to games, if you are successful you also get higher quality features than the peasants around you. It's not just a simple product any more, it's a product with different tiers for different classes of people, like any commercial cruise ship or airline has: economy (polite way of saying peasant class) business and first class.
---
&gt; There’s no pressure to go where the action is. There’s no pressure to find a better server with more loot. There’s no pressure about filling up your inventory and having to waddle halfway across the world to find a stash box.
---
Hmm, there wasn't any pressure for this since release. And I usually pickup everything that isn't nailed to the ground.
---
The pressure was once you came back to your camp to wonder what to keep and what to throw out.
---
Anger at the company directly responsible doesn't do any good, so I had better start attacking other players instead. I'm sorry, I don't see the logic there buddy.
---
You poor fool. You can't even see it.
---
I just feel bad for you now.
---
Aye I’m on pc too. Most of the time it’s just blank, sometimes it shows the weapon wheel instead. I keep getting people wave at me or whatever and I can’t do it back.
---
Really $100 a year that's cheap dude. To tell you the truth this is the only place I see people complaining about it. Check out the face book groups you don't see all this whining going on about it
---
Okay? What was the point of this comment? You mad bro?
---
If everyone had avoided MTX for the last 15 years we wouldn't have them because obviously no one would have made money off of them.
---
I have been feeling the same way about armor the last few days too.
---
&gt;  I already paid for the game, why would I rob myself of the enjoyment that still exists just because of Bethesda's shittiness? 
---
Nobody is robbing you of anything, you could simply keep playing the way you always did, and if you enjoyed it, you will keep enjoying it.
---
&gt; People who are complaining while still playing have every right to do so. 
---
Yes they do, as they have the right to step away if they don't enjoy it anymore. But they don't have the right to decide what other people do with their money.
---
Who are you winning against?
---
Sorry. What happens here affects more than just Fallout 76.
---
&gt; Haters gonna hate
---
Fanboys gonna fanboy - should be added. That's why Bethesda usually gets away with it. People fail to see and understand valid criticism (like yourself) and keep defending BSG.
---
....? Of WHAT lmao?
---
Nothing changed, guns break faster with legendary effects like explosive and two shot and if you have a low condition bar.
---
Your first paragraph is literally what I'm saying...
---
People can complain and still play the game normally. Complaining isn't a bad thing when it's deserved. That's exactly what I'm doing.
---
Who the hell is saying what your second paragraph is referring to? 😂 dude what
---
Thanks I appreciate the support. I know there's more people who understand all this than not, but the ignorant clearly still number enough to make these companies profits. Whales hurt gaming more than anything else.
---
It's cheaper than all of them.
---
Read the post again, then ask someone to ELI5 to you. If you still don't get it then I will begin to wonder how you even function in the society.
---
I’ve only noticed the last few nights that I’ve been running the Vault with my team.. and I stream so I watched one of my last solo raids through the Vault and I never had to repair my gun.. now like I said at least two repairs if not three
---
Hmm
---
Actually yes they are. You're joking yourself if you don't think people are willing to spend money on it. It's not always about value to everybody. I can piss a hundred bucks away easily one night at the bar and not think anything of it.
---
Oh, no, they're quite different, but that's why I bring it up. A subscription to an online game isn't a big deal to me in certain contexts. Like, with Apex you're looking at a free game, with a battle pass that only adds cosmetics. 76 promised stuff would stay cosmetic, with this it doesn't. But, it's also not at the level of an MMO. I know it is not an MMO, and I do expect different things from it, but if you're going to start charging like it is one... Like I said, maybe with Wastelanders, with some massive content update, with more frequent content updates, etc, I might not see such an issue with it. As it stands, it's in this weird place between what other free to play games might offer (for a paid game!), and what something like a more traditional MMO would offer. It, currently, isn't an addition that really makes much sense to me. I feel they could have done a subscription model in a much better way, instead of, what feels to me, poorly thought out, half-assed, and rushed. The same things that have caused a lot of other issues for 76, even if it is generally an enjoyable game.
---
Yes, in EU they ask  $16 for a month
---
You are the one who came here spamming dude, talk about feeling entitled?
---
Well, you are lucky, most of my interactions are people shooting me
---
well they have to raise the sail figures somehow, but they are going to loose people on the way
---
But they didn't and now mtx are industry standard to the point they're institutionalized.  I remember people screaming at me and telling me it's their wallet and wouldn't affect me, of course I knew better.  But at this point, too many people readily accept mtx.
---
Wish i had a Mr reacharound to go with my Mr handy...
---
Im pretty sure the subscription was suppose to come out with the update UNTIL they decided to delay it. My hopes is that it wouldnt have been as predatory as it is now, but who knows.
---
Anyways, as it stands right now, Zenimax and Bethesda are currently in a bid with this company known as Providence Equity (PE) that gives companies billions of dollars in the expectation that they make just as much by the time they want to pull out of contract. 
---
PE has given Zenimax (and in tow, Bethesda) a total of about 500 billion dollars that it is expecting back at some point. Now while they were given this money a while ago, well before 76 came out, PE is planning on pulling out and expects a payback. Bethesda, the sorry sods they are, for once arent ACTUALLY at fault with this. 
---
The idea was presented to come out alongside Wastelanders, believed to initially be a fully optional thing. However, since the devs felt Wastelanders needed more time (whether on account they keep fucking up or they actually want it to be good) Zenimax told them the only way they can delay Wastelanders was to push the subscription out IMMEDIATELY. Or, something to that effect.
---
Juicehead actually has a video talking about this very topic, I believe titled The Truth Behind Fallout 1st (dont qoute me, just look up his channel).
---
Frankly, its dumb either way, but we all know people will buy...possibly the only reason anyone has purchased the sub was for the private servers (and the ranger armor but thats a whole other thing...) which really arent that private since your friends can join at any given time and you cant kick them unless you unfriend them and block them.
---
All in all, its definitely terrible timing since weve been promised Wastelanders only to have it be delayed and replaced with 1st...not really cool
---
Equip it when needed. It is very light.
---
Gotta get those repair kit sales up somehow
---
Why is this a problem? Other people benefit too. The 3\* handmade rifle was from the purveyor. Usually I roll garbage, I finally lucked out with that. The only actual benefit is that when I go looting, I can actually find loot. Places aren't picked clean.
---
Mandatory means only a handful of players will remain.. so no additional income - so no new content, no expansions - dead game within a year.
---
Up to a certain value...yes. Most enclave will be a 1 for 1.
---
\*shrug\* That's my take on it, yes.
---
But it’s the same exact gun, same exact effects as before... nothing has changed at all on my end. One day I’m running through the Vault solo not having to repair the gun one time, the next.. minimum 2 repairs on a team through the Vault
---
My laser rifle breaks about 3 times doing the scorchbeast, unacceptable tbh, when in ESO, I repair armour once or twice a week if even that
---
I dont get it..
---
how is it p2w with 1st? i dont even get an xp boost....i wont buy it again its not worth it
---
but how is it p2w? the servers are that dead that any advantage from private server is moot......and the scrap box is a CAMP item so unlike eso i dont carry it around i still have weight carry issues.... so thats not really an advantage.  also theres no xp boost like eso. im guessing the price comes from he useless privae servers everyone seems to want. but i dopnt get it...cause every server ive been in i hardly ever meet another person and the loot is generally always there, if i8t isnt i just server hop
---
so i ask again..how is 1st a p2w system? ( oh btw magazine and bobble head spawns dnt really happen any more often,. i checked once i wasted money on the 1st thing.)  
---
so yeah...i have 1st...dont think its worth it...but i dont think its p2w unless im  missing something!!!!!
---
this is what happens when a company sell yo few digitial copies and they get greedy
---
76 is decent. It sure as shit ain't good enough to pay for more than once. But if you want to keep pretending Bethesda is doing no wrong, then good for you.
---
Enjoy your shitty cosmetics and broke servers lol
---
Lucky for you according to the data we collected were going to be bundling male and female npc communication.
---
Ah, that makes sense, thanks.
---
Anyway, its now worth making a trip out to Dyer Chemical every so often to get that nice radshield.
---
$100 US
---
I'm running vault raids everyday, solo and my gun doesn't even brake. My build is stealth.
---
You should be able to take a stack of pre war money and "[Make it rain](https://giphy.com/gifs/make-it-rain-mad-money-dolla-bill-yall-CX37AcOejRpdK)".
---
I bought the expensive edition at release, played for about a month and quit.
---
I recently came back, and was quite happy with where the game had gone.
---
I am now quitting as a direct result of Fallout 1st. It simply leaves such a mad taste in my mouth which has taken away my desire to play.
---
RIP Beth as my all time favorite developer :(
---
If they do I think a Season pass or extra rolls att legendary vendor for atoms might be the case. But who knows. Playerbase don’t say jump, Bethsda totally delusional asks ”how high?”
---
I wish it had been a better game, nothing they have done to “fix” it has or is going to work. 
---
Have you checked out Outer Worlds? Really well done. Just sayin.
---
Oh yeah. Those colours are hard on the eye. Weird style choice.
---
And this is something that genuinely concerns me, not gonna lie. I love this game, been playing it since early this year. And I seriously want it to improve for everyone. But seeing "pay for convenience" being implemented over actual content is disconcerting at the very least. It does set a precedent, well I think it already has, that Bethesda can continue to do whatever they want in order to milk its playerbase cause they'll still give them money. I agree that there are a lot of blind haters out there, but calling everyone who's tired and pissed off with what's been happening to a game they enjoy one isn't helpful.
---
It's posts like this that make me thankful I had a brain and put the game down almost immediately. I don't think I got to level 10, but I've lurked in this sub and watched the cancerous name-calling and finger pointing ever since. It's hilarious but also kinda disgusting and pathetic. Your crusade to save the industry and prove how woke you are is pure comedy. Everyone knows how these things work and they are happy to pay it. As you can see, people don't appreciate being judged for purchasing convenience, regardless of what you think you were entitled to in the base game. Game development is a series of moving parts, each project on an ever-changing timeline. There are reasons they couldn't give you what is in the sub for nothing. Technical reasons. Server and programming reasons, budgeting reasons, I could go on. Though you make it perfectly clear that you've never looked at development from a serious perspective in your life. I'm sorry to be harsh but this post is really immature, which i guess is in line with the sub.
---
Its fun to watch this mess. Plus I am watching a new but more incompetent EA emerge, its interesting to see.
---
!remindme 20 years
---
I think their biggest flaw is that they don’t like to play with others.
---
Yes the fridge is SOOOOOO OP! What a game breaker the fridge is, shit spoils a little slower /s
---
Only a little bit cheaper in oz than nz
---
Buy the game and buy Fallout 1st. 
---
Here come the "shill" comments from the vocal minority bandwagon.
---
What platform?
---
&gt;Complaining isn't a bad thing when it's deserved.
---
Dude you are complaining about the fact that something/someone not better identified is "robbing" you. I am trying to let you understand that you haven't been deprived of anything, and if you wanna complain you better complain about something that makes sense.
---
I didn’t say nobody would spend money on it. There will always be somebody who will buy literally anything. 
---
Do I think more than 50% of the playerbase will? Hell no. More than 50% of the current playerbase won’t even be playing this game a year from now. 
---
Well made games with large expansions don’t get that kind of attach rate. Publishers have outright said that even 20% is a good attach rate for dlc for most games. An attach rate above 50% for fallout 1st would be insane.
---
It is overpriced IMO. So I didn't buy it, but more so because I don't want or need it. As long as you're happy with your choice.
---
Can we be friends if you dont mind being with a dirty rotten fallout 1st subscriber?
---
Actually laughing imagining todd and Pete the fallout 76 playground bullies.
---
I really love the game for what I'd call Archeology exploration. There are a lot of stories to pick up from before the bombs dropped, just after etc. I really liked that aspect.
---
In my opinion though human NPC should bring the game (litterally) to life. The quests feel a little like they had no point as the people you are doing them for are either long dead or moved away. So yeah I finished your task, but nobody is around to benefit cos they all died 30 years ago :P
---
TL;DR -Great world to explore, quests to help nobody.
---
Just wait for the next 'Inside the vault', you'll get a response.
---
The remaining players all have 1st because anyone that wasn't willing to drop more money on the game was forced out.
---
Slippery Slope Fallacy.
---
Abo is short for abonnement, wich means subscription in the Netherlands.
---
There's been a long-time suspicion that performance/general buginess is related to how many players on the server.  Basically, the game doesn't function properly with the default server limit - mobs start T-posing, enemy AI breaks/enemies just stand &amp; get shot, crashes, disconnects, the works.  
---
However if you're playing on a relatively empty server, like 6-8 or less, it works fine.  Go figure private servers are capped at 8.  The theory stems from people noticing these weird periods late at night where you'd occasionally get a server to yourself and magically the game worked as expected.
---
So instead of fixing their buggy game or providing an ample amount of server space, if you want to play bug-free you have to pay a sub.  That's just greaaaaat /s .
---
I guess in utopia, video game companies would only need to collect a one time fee for their product. And, when video games were release and forget, except maybe a couple of patches, it was mostly like that. Now the company has to host servers and develop new content every few months, then track down new bugs.. then develop new content, on and on. Unfortunately that ain't free. Personally, I don't like "how" they decided to make money, but I do understand that if they didn't make money, we wouldn't have servers to play on. We wouldn't ever get any new content, not even crappy skins. So, I view it as a necessary evil. IF I don't like the subscription product, I wont buy it, but I will be glad others did so I can keep playing and the developers can keep developing, even if they aren't the best programmers on earth.
---
And it all started with the five dollar repair kit. "It's only this one thing"
---
Ammo will still sell and rare junk too. The only difference will be that now people can buy more because they have room for it.
---
Horse armour cost $2.50, by the way. $15 would have been legit outrageous.
---
&gt;you have to pay a sub fee just to get past the start menu or $5 to start a quest to $3 to enter a dungeon 
---
This is by far the scariest vision of the future I’ve read, and unfortunately I can see this happening some day in the next few years.
---
There are many methods to multiplayer servers. Peer based or hosted, independent or controlled by the game company. I know Ark and Minecraft can be run on your own box without having to resort to the parent company for anything so it cant be really compared to Fallout 76's system.
---
That is literally just yourself enforcing a typical first world problem on you, then blaming the company for creating such a "necessity".
---
The robot's droning voice is very good.
---
Level 16..... so you played the game twice and realized it was “pointless”  I also have a PS4 pro and an oled tv and my game looks great. And in your two days of play, how many times did it crash?? Because in the last week I played about twenty hours and crashed once.....
---
I very much believe that sometime in the near future Bethesda will sell legendary gear in the atom shop.  You'll be able to specifically pick which weapon/armor and which effects they will have, and the excuse will be that you can still get those items for free through farming.  Never mind the fact that the odds of getting the exact piece of gear you want are astronomically unlikely.  And people will STILL defend Bethesda when they do it because you'll technically be able to get whatever gear that's in the shop for free.
---

Being able to pay to gain an advantage over another player is Pay2Win. Not finishing the game.

Sure do you want to do a vault raid?
---
Can I ask you one thing, when was the last time you reinstalled Windows?
---
The server stability is better than at launch... it was bad like that for about the first 6months or so. You can enjoy the game now for the most part. There are still bugs and glitches, so be prepared. I wouldn’t recommend getting fallout 1st, seeing as you are a new player ( and other reason but meh, do what you wish later on), play the content that is available first.
---
Please learn to make better decisions on what you spend your money on, for the love of God.
---
Lets just clarify features ”that should be free”, because this is where I see them react to.
---
Starting a new world should be free, having a actual server ofcourse would cost money but give you controll of it at the same time.
---
You too shall see the light.
---
It was like that at the start. It was pitch black at night, and you had to add a generator and light to indoors to light it up. I liked that, but for some reason they removed it and made it pretty much day time all the time, even indoors.
---
They literally lied about purely cosmetic items...
---
Most of us couldn't care less about that NCR outfit. It's the fact Berhesda has slowly eased players into P2W, and that's scummy.
---
You're arguing something way different, buddy.
---
Lol typical, you can always spot the immature kid when they resort to childish insults when they have no actual argument lmao
---
Dirt cheap is playing The Outer Worlds on xbox game pass for PC for the grand price of £1 (can probably end the sub 2days early and get a full refund too!).
---
1. its been safe since launch, the item loss was over done and happened only a handfull of times and was near impossible to replicate by people who tried it on purpose.  since patch 13/the fix not one instance has occurred
---
2. it takes 14 runs of novice-standard-and expert in total to make the power armor (162 steel total) or 5 days for a standard set assuming you have the plans (50 @ 12 steel per day)
---
3. someone posted an expert guide for 2 people, il try to link it

I already have a scrap box. It's called any large building.
---
If I could have a literal 'pile' of scrap in my camp, that would look pretty good, but having another stash box for scrap would actually spoil the game for me more than help. Most of my Wasteland adventures are random encounters I come across while looking for stuff. If they gave me one, I doubt I'd use it.
---
I dont want to let people support a company like Bethesda. By paying for their garbage you are harming the entire games industry for everyone. Your patronage lets them know that they can get away with releasing half assed games and then selling patches for subscription fees. If Fo1st is successful, then other companies will follow suit. The monetization of experiences in gaming has been a slippery slope since the early 2000s, and now we're at a point where it pervades every AAA gaming experience in absolutely aggregious ways like Fo1st.   
---
How can a person have respect for themselves while giving money to a company that openly treats their customers like idiots?
---
With 2 people it's gonna take you some tine to master even standard. Expert in week 2 and 3 is almost impossible with 2 people.
---
It all comes down to Wastelanders. If Wastelanders is truly a big change that adds significant content, it will bring in more people and it will bring bring in people who are Bethesda Fallout fans that want Fallout 76 to be more in line with the other games. This is going to be the only Fallout game for some time with Starfield and ES6 being priority and people will check it out to scratch that Fallout itch. Bethesda needs to really keep the pedal to the metal after Wastelanders comes out.
---
I mean the people most enjoying this game left this sub, it's not for fallout anymore it's a platform for people to air their grievances, if you're still playing go over to f76filithycasuals, this sub is not a reflection of what's happening in game, it's quit clear alot of the people complaining have never played 76
---
Time zones?
---
1) it’s safe
---
2) 5 days doing expert and standard (more if you need all the plans)
---
3) one person do pipes other is a runner, on private server with some practice you can do expert duo np
---
NZD 23.95 = USD 15.21
---
Of course New Zealand has a 15% GST, so Bethesda is getting 20.82 NZD, 13.22 USD
---
The US price is 12.99 USD a month, so you're paying 23 cents a month more.
---
I've been reading through the comments on here and it is Interresting how many people are enjoying the game more the closer it becomes to a single player game :P
---
That was them dipping their toes in the water.  That being excepted lead to repair kits, then scrap kits, now paid private servers and unlimited scrap stashes.  Just wait.  It WILL get worse.  Gear in the atom shop will be a thing sooner or later.  Either selling specific effects on gear or through selling legendary mods to attach to gear that will add a 4th and 5th effect like OP said.
---
Oh boy little kids acting all high and mighty because they wasted their money.
---
Yea the gaming industry is gonna crash hard this time around
---
😅
---
You pay 99.99
---
That’s a free game .-. stop defending this please
---
You don’t have unlimited storage for your stash. 
---
You only get a new box that can place junk components in. That and only that has unlimited storage.
---
That is it. 
---
Armor/weapons and everything else still has weight and uses up the stash box limit.
---
He shouldn’t buy Fallout 1st, it’s not worth it for a new player until he knows he’s going to stick with the game.
---
Yeah trust me it scares me too but when you look at where we are now and how we got here, it's so easy to see it could happen. I mean realistically why wouldnt it? There's nothing to stop these companies since it's not 100% of the gaming population that even accepts this stuff.
---
Go with one of the previous Fallout games, better performance and you won't have to fight with bugs and pay to win that is 76.  Give 4 shot, you'll definitely thank yourself.
---
&gt;It is simple. Games used to be “democratic” - every gamer had one vote - either to buy a game or not - and games were made to convince you to buy them. Now every one has as much votes as they have money to spend on that given game - and games are made to make you spend that money.  
---
Games could afford to be "democratic" as you put it because they didn't used to require tens to hundreds of millions of dollars to produce. Production costs have ballooned since the days of NES, but initial buying prices have largely stayed the same ($60 for a new title from a major publisher/first party). Companies have been trying for years to find ways to keep up with rising costs while still being profitable.  
---
&gt;Now imagine if your vote in election was multiplied by the amount of money you are willing to support an candidate. How would that work out ? There would no longer be any democracy in that. Capitalism is not democracy - they are not creating games based on what most people want, but based on what makes them the best profit.  
---
Yeah, these are gaming companies. Even during the good old days, their primary goal was making money, there just weren't mechanisms for further purchases within the same game until relatively recently (and they could still milk the same game by releasing multiple versions of it). Also, wtf are you talking about them not creating a product people want, demand is major part of how free market capitalism works, there is no profit in any industry if there is no demand for it (ei: people *want* what it produces). Your analogy is just bad.
---
Anything and everything in the game will sell less because you can go farm pristine locations every 20 hours while setting up a ammo factory
---
Who are you talking about?
---
Yea, Games crashes quite a lot for me on PC since the latest Patch.
---
You should be angry they're selling you tools to avoid their gathering nerfs in the first place.
---
Remember when the MTX was gonna be  cosmetic only?????????
---
I've been playing since beta day one. Game has its bugs and blue screens but I still play it the same. Always looking for new and better gear, trying different builds and combinations. I still find it entertaining. I run FO76 on a PS4 Pro and it runs as good. Mostly a lot of the time servers take a bit of time to load in, but once you're loaded in, you're good to go.
---
As far as initial good experiences, find a group to run with. Makes it that much more fun. Have an idea of what kind of build you want to be as well. This way you can start character planning early on to get a jump on things and not have to respec as much at higher levels, 50+.
---
I'm working on a new build almost always. I get them built up to a point where they almost one hit kill just about everything in game and then on to the next one.
---
There are some sites out there that will help with character development, suck as Nukes and Dragons Fallout 76 build planner, and resource locations, fo76map.
---
If you need help let me know. Almost always on in the morning/afternoon doing something. Happy travels and best of luck in the wasteland!
---
Aus is the same as NZ in pricing.
---
Same. I love seeing the other players' camps. Even the horrific eyesores.
---
Would you like that with lube
---
Bethesda kinda fucked 100% of the playerbase while 10% refuses to admit and still buys stuff like FF - people are enraged, they have you guys to blow off steam
---
It’s strange because in the U.K. it’s almost the exact same price numbers wise after the 20% tax gets added on but yet ESO+ is £9.99 so I don’t really know where they’re getting these numbers from.
---
Exactly like I’m not gonna let people judge me for how I spend my money that I earned myself. People are pathetic dude. But there’s always been idiots in this game from the start, not everybody is bad.
---
Yeah, it’s rough to an early player, which is why I usually hop over there to help out if I see someone low-level in the area.

What E. Norton says at 0:14
---
How about private servers with unlimited access to do whatever the hell you want with it (cheat, mod, etc)??
---
They're PRIVATE for a reason, you dont need anticheat if you have to invite people in.
---
Where do you get 9,99 USD?  The price is 12,99 USD in the states.
---
Poland has 23% VAT, so the 63 PLN price is 51.21 PLN for Bethesda, or 13.29 USD, i.e. 30 cents more than it costs in the US.
---
Cheers for that, also how do you put down a survival tent?
---
Have to get back t from the atom shop first.
---
LOL thanks I have no idea why I had $15 in my head. Well no I do it was bumped up to $5 so I had 5 something floating around haha. Edited to reflect the accurate price. I can't find any info on if that was $2.50 for each set though, I swear I remember paying way more than that hm 🤔
---
“Forced out” 
---
I mean I haven’t bought 1st and I can play the game just fine like I have been doing for the past 10 months.
---
You know what they'll do. They'll take and monetize all your suggestions and never remove fallout 1st
---
It gives you an unlimited scrap stash, which frees up a ton of room in you main stash.  More room in your main stash means more gear storage.  More gear storage means more equipment for different builds.  Being able to change builds on the fly means being able to more easily take down boss enemies or win in PvP.  If for whatever reason that isn't enough for you, "pay to win" doesn't always have to involve "winning".  It's a catch all term for being able to pay more money to have an advantage over those who aren't willing to pay more.  And anyone who claims that more stash space isn't an advantage in this game clearly doesn't play it.
---
Good one my dude
---
Yeah, now they're making us pay for them.
---
Bethesda literally said the Aton shop (which was supposed to be cosmetic only) was to fund and support the game after launch. 
---
So what's the sub for...?
---
Weak.
---
Good stuff, hope you enjoy it.
---
Ok buddy
---
Thos few dollars and few cents don’t matter to those that charges daddy’s credit card!
---
I never thought of that can you sell bottomless junk now?
---
&gt;They literally lied about purely cosmetic items
---
In what did they lie? About the 3 units of Concrete and 5 of Lead per hour bot? About the -50% degradation for 15 units of food fridge? Are you seriously telling me those are P2W?  
---
And moreover, are you really saying there's anything as "winning" in FO76? Then I might have missed the leaderboards and season rewards that came with my Scrapbot.
---
Please.
---
They see value in the atoms, atomic shop discounts and exclusive cosmetics. Others like the private servers 
---
Why do you care what people spend money on?
---
Ah noted very helpful appreciate it smooth skin! UwU
---
It's in the favorite wheel
---
I'd love a map extension, but if not it would be fun if they opened up a few more buildings. A little bit more lore thrown in, more notes, stories to follow...
---
I'm already over there, but the amount of entitlement in this sub never ceases to trigger me.
---
You act like because they made a ton of money on Fallout 4 and Skyrim that all that money is just sitting in a jar untouched waiting to be spent. Thats not the way the business works. 
---
If you want to keep getting the green light to improve the game and keep working on it and not have the plug pulled on the project you have to prove to the higher-ups that the current project you're working on can make money.
---
Ok, thx for clarification. Nevertheless, it's still too expensive in my opinion - for 63 PLN I have 6-7 good craft beers - much more fun than f1st subscription ;)
---
Figure it out.
---
Out of all the QoL things this one bugs me the most.  
---
My camp is basically a shrine to The Mothman and it makes having candles, sconces or any other form of lighting pretty much irrelevant.
---
Until you get killed by a random, because you were in an unclaimed workshop area by coincidence...
---
But, shouldn't we let the game die a horrible death because we WANT MOAR BETTAR, and then when they shut the servers down because they have no money, pitch a fit and buy another game to complain about with the money we saved by not subbing?????   (/sarcasm)
---
No they don't, it's 14,99 EUR.
---
The average EU VAT rate is 21.3% (hey!  France is not the highest!), so Bethesda gets 12.35 EUR, or 13.70 USD, so we are paying 71 cents more a month.
---
Yes it is safe. It has been safe.
---
never gonna happen buddy
---
Why are you insulting people who bought it? Are you that stupid?
---
When it comes to the crash I'm talking about. These game companies are focusing in on the idiotic 20-30 year olds with too much money, and children who are conditioned to buy everything they can, and people are increasingly getting angry with this whole industry.
---
Much like the video game crash in the early 80's, companies are shoveling out complete dogshit in hopes to make a couple buck, only difference is, they can charge the same amount of money as a full priced game on SKINS AND WORTHLESS SUBSCRIPTIONS..
---
Soon games wont be making enough money to cover their bottom line, and the monetization is only going to get worse
---
I hear the multiplayer mode is trash and the base building doesn't work too well either.
---
none of your pros are valid fyi
---
That's really sad :(
---
My only advice would be to block them (if you've not already).
---
Unfortunately, griefers be griefers. You were a target because of the 1st thing, but folks like that would be doing the same thing even if the 1st thing never happened - they would have just made up another excuse to justify their actions.
---
Try not to be disheartened, it's more of a reflection on their characters than yours.
---
&gt; Here the majority of posters dont own the game. 
---
As with the rest of their comment, absolutely based on no facts whatsoever.
---
If this sub wasn't at all representative of the player base for the game, do you think Bethesda would waste their time and money putting community managers in here?
---
No, we ARE representative of the player base. A sizeable one too given that there are 200k subs and usually 2-3k active at any given moment.
---
Certainly not a 1-to-1 reflection of the entire player base without a doubt. Also not the only representative group (there's at least the official forums, twitter and I'm sure some Facebook group somewhere). Still, representative all the same. 
---
Don't let Mr I-make-up-my-own-facts tell you otherwise.
---
Any advantage in the slightest in P2W. It doesn't matter if you pay $10 to get a 1 HP boost. P2W is P2W, that is an objective fact. To you, it may not be significant, but it is still an objective fact that they lied.
---
There's PvP.
---
Yeah, definitely agree. You are not representing a majority of the player base
---
Can you quote where in my entire post I said anything about it being P2W?
---
Is letting your anger out on others ever a good way to go about things? If they want to let off steam, why not do it in a constructive way? Write a rant about it on reddit. Lord knows they wouldn't be the first or the last. Build a big sign in your camp to protest it, or whatever way you can think up. Attacking someone because they represent what you hate won't solve anything. Does taking a bunch of level 1-10 weapons solve anything? "Letting off steam" isn't an excuse for poor behaviour.
---
No, we don't have to just sit back and accept it.  That's why there has been such a huge backlash over this.
---
And only 40 hours of "playability" in The Outer Worlds?  That's cute.  I wonder which Bethesda community manager this account is an alt for.
---
Yea, the whole point is that there are three kind of people:
---
\- Those that want the sub, and buy the sub.
---
\- Those that don't believe the sub is worth it, and don't buy the sub.
---
\- Those that want the sub but don't want to spend the money because they feel entitled to have it for free, but obviously won't get it so they exploit this whole "corporations are monsters we need to flip them" thing to pretend they are fighting against capitalism when all they care is just their own profit, just like the aforementioned corporations.
---
Personally, I'd prefer if they kept the subscription to just the private worlds and removed all the pay2win stuff. 
---
Even if they intend to sell it elsewhere. Just don't bundle it together.
---
It can't become the new normal if people stop purchasing their games from this point on.
---
Also, the Obsidian vs. Bethesda references soundly apply to all of this.
---
TOW is, at it's core, a Fallout game. It may not be the same story, but the mechanics are the same. The characters are reminiscent of characters from Fallout. The alternative future in which technology has advanced, but elements are from a by-gone era...
---
TOW gives a taste of what Fallout could have been. Interesting story, great characters, polished well enough for release, no gimmicks relying on markets and extra $$$. Just a damn interesting game. More over, it is a game made by a company that, in the past, hand their hand in the franchise.
---
Obsidian gave everyone a really good game and didn't rely on lies and screwing over people in the process. Bethesda did. Obsidian gave us the Fallout game we deserved. The only argument I think that really needs to be made is that while it feels and plays like Fallout, it is their own thing at the same time and it is hard to point out the similarities without unintentionally making it sound like they stole anything. A lot of people probably don't know that Fallout was their child, and they are only reclaiming the abused kid in a sense, not stealing it.
---
Bethesda is damaged goods now, and if what they have done over the course of 76 (and arguably before) is any indication, they will continue this broken course until it destroys their company. There is no discussion or threat that any player can make to change it, as has been seen. I have full faith that micro-transactions, monthly costs, pay-to-win, and whatever else will cost a player money on top of what they paid initially, will be a part of Bethesda's model. The worst part is, much like this, they will probably charge full price with false promises and once enough people bought their next bug filled game that relies on community fixes, they will gouge again.
---
Bethesda is synonymous with dishonest and greedy from this point forward. To purchase another one of their games is only setting yourself up for another round of getting a partial game and being required to pay for the rest. If everyone learned that and lived by it, or at least enough people, no companies would try it. Their last game would always be the one in which they did exactly this, which is pretty leanient considering the paid alpha status and unfulfilled features gamers have begun paying for.
---
At least we can throw Obsidian in Bethesda's face. Show them that one company did the formula right and constantly hold that up as an example. We have been given a pretty stark and obvious "Right vs. Wrong" example, it should be utilized. For the next company, Bethesda can shutter for all I care.
---
Sigh and thats why we suck as a species 😔
---
Look for them in the recent tab.  I had one disappear yesterday, so I exited the menu then went back in, chose the recent tab and located them.  Acknowledged the request from there.
---
Gaining an advantage against standard players.
---
How exactly are they selling patches for subscription fees? Please clue me in because from where I’m looking you clearly don’t play the game but please, tell me how they’re “selling patches”
---
sorry i didnt realise i had targeted a post. actually i wanted to make this a post on its own but i couldnt figure out how cause im a nooob lol. sorry Broken!
---
GTA V was the biggest, most shitty grind out of almost every game out there.
---
I wouldn't have even enjoyed online if I didnt get a couple million for free when shit was bugging out the first week or two.
---
I got fallout 1st saw a post on Facebook about someone needing wood. Looked in my scrap box have over 3k. Told the player to add me. Some other players showed up randomly to check my shop. Bought some stuff and saw me gifting the 1k wood to the player. And immediately starting being hostile in area chat spouting this and that about scrap box this and that. Toxicity is everywhere it never changes.
---
Lol sorry I'm not really but I do have enough I don't mind paying a sub, for an MMORPG and only when it's worth it lol. I wish I was money bags though haha
---
Dog we aint even gonna make it to Wastelanders.
---
Who are these people defending and especially bragging about fallout 1st I haven’t seen that at all
---
A robot that gives you a quest in the top of a tower. It thinks its a raider.

If you wanted to play just for the amuzing bugs they aren't really there anymore, now the game is just broken in non-amuzing ways.
---
&gt; Any advantage in the slightest in P2W.
---
That is not really the correct definition of P2W.
---
16$ in Norway.
---
I'm sorry but that happened...
---
This guy.. you know the community is going to shit
---
No nobody cares about your opinion, people can spend their money how they like.
---
I totally get what your saying it's been hard work 2 stick with the game but I have stuck with it and I also agree that Bethesda should have done pretty much everything a different way but the problem is they haven't and it doesn't look like they will any time soon so what am I supposed to do stop playing my favourite game that me and my wife play just because Bethesda are a bunch of dicks no I'm Gunna pay the money and enjoy the fact that I won't have to spend the 1st half an hour + sorting my stash box out again
---
I'm actually working on that.. :p
---
If you don't like it.
---
Don't play it.
---
It's that simpel
---
- We're talking about a subscription here not single cosmetics like skins. 
---
- The post is about FO76 and it's potential impact on the "AAA" gaming industry. Therefore it's perfectly relevant here.
---
Could not have said it better! I totally agree with you OP!
---
I'm not jealous of you, I'm more like royally pissed off at you because of the fact you paid Bethesda for this broken mess. That you paid Bethesda for stuff that should have been in the game for everyone to enjoy... well maybe "enjoy" is not the right word for this LOL!
---
If I wasn't so pissed off about people paying Bethesda, I would feel sorry for you. But I don't.  
---
You get what you paid for and for everyone losing their scrap, well deserved.
---
This game has been broken since it's launch and Bethesda barely did anything to at least try to fix this broken game.  
---
The content they added to this game is, what I would call, minimum for one exception: The Atom store. 
---
People are giving feedback on how to make this game better, because we all would like this game to be way better than it is today. And what does Bethesda do with all of that feedback? Oh, they use it alright... to fill their pockets, by selling everything to you. And you... actually pay for it.
---
To everyone who thinks that the people being mad, the people complaining about this, are just "jeasous" or "haters"... you make me sick and you, are a part of this problem and until you stop giving Bethesda you money, this game will never get better. Because they will just keep on doing what they are doing, selling you the fixes to the problems currently plagueing the game.
---
You, are what they made this game for. You, are the cash cow. Congratulations.
---
Could be the old bug where npcs would multiply. Search on YouTube for the Whitespring's Mr Handy clones.
---
I'm guessing you live in a big city or some sort of tourist trap, because yeah most of the Burger King meals aren't even $10 in our area. With exclusion to like a specialty/seasonal meal maybe.
---
? Discouraging others from spending money on the product = less money for the company which is a far more impactful than sending them a letter or something lol
---
The yearly Australian subscription  is the same as buying 3 x Fallout 76 at release price with change left over.
---
They want us to buy this game three times a year, sigh.
---
How much you wanna bet there are a LOT of FO4 players that didn't want to deal with humans or PVP so they stayed away from the game waiting for the Private servers to try it out.  You'll never know they subscribed, but BGS probably is making a mint right now.  That won't last as a ton will cancel after a month having decided it's not for them.  I know that was my plan initially, but received the game as a Christmas gift and decided what the heck... But had I not, I would have instantly bought the game and subscribed to try it out.  I would have stayed on the private world playing FO4 in FO76.
---
You could take a look at Kenshi, but that's more management/rts/survival/rpg combo.
---
If you like those games, here's some other suggestions(which you most likely already played).
---
Jagged Alliance 2
---
Silent Storm
---
The Age of Decadence(roman theme)
---
Invisible, Inc. (not that familiar with it, but it looks fun)
---
Shadowrun
---
Underrail &lt;--- similar to Fallout / Metro
---
&gt; at least reward those who payed FULL PRICE and stuck with the game from the beginning.  
---
Then again, those who paid full price and stuck with the game from the beginning are obviously fools that are easily parted from their money, so why give them anything for free if in all likelyhood they'd cough up the cash to buy it ?
---
Remember people harassing fellers with survival gone man, like a week or two ago? Its the same guys and probably a considerable amount more joined their ranks as bethesda keeps creating controversy but adds absolutely 0 content to the game for months. People are bored, they aren't interested in any other game one reason or another and you get this result.
---
Its again 100% bethesdas fault.
---
That sucks, man. If you're in pacifist and stay away from workshops that's the worst thing they can do to you. Any time anyone's killed my brahmin I've just said 
---
"Gentlemen, we can rebuild him. We have the technology"
---
Griefing others is a real jerk move for any reason
---
Now did we learn our lesson?
---
Dont ever preorder, let alone spend almost $300 on pixels and an extremely overpriced plastic toy.
---
Sold. Apart from the ballpit and clean toilet (isn't the porta-loo clean enough for you). But what I really want is Junk Walls like in FO4.
---
Any advantage that requires real world money is P2W, because it cannot be earned. That's literally what P2W is, especially when you consider how it snowballs.
---
What about Pacificist mode? That makes no fucking sense, what? 😂 I'm talking about when people willingly engage in PvP with each other, any advantage is still an advantage.
---
People are having fun. You can try to bully people into your angry mob if you want but that makes you neither the expert nor authority with what and how people find enjoyment.

---
What?
---
There have always been griefers and it sucks that griefers are targeting people like you. It's a dick move and they just shouldn't.
---
However, they're not the entirety of the community at large. It's just one bad example that you've had to live through. Sorry to hear that you have but I don't believe that this is the norm.
---
People who buy the subscription absolutely deserve all the shit they get.
---
I doubt it was because you’re a FO1ST member, it was because they’re idiots. They’re always around and just need any excuse to annoy someone. I wouldn’t even let it bother you, that’s what they get off on. There seems to be more players with FO1ST than those that don’t, so all the crying on here has actually accomplished nothing.
---
hi all you fan boys and haters!!  glad to hear from yins!!  i see you are still supporting a broke ass game.  keep spending your hard earned $$s on a PoS game.  it is ok, i know you have nothing better to do than troll the reddit and slam any one who opposes the lies and nefarious business practices of that asshole howard.  keep feeding his ego fan boys and haters, just a little bit more and he will be able to float it down this years thanksgiving day parade.
---
keep up the hate, haters.  keep supporting a broken game, fanboys.  this reddit is still toxic as ever.  nothing has changed.
---
happy as fuck i bought a VR set and got the hell away from this place.
---
all of you can go fuck your selves.  reply if ya like, i turned off notifications and will never know what useless shit drivels out your cakeholes!!!
---
 thththththththththththththththththt!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
---
::points finger and laughs @U::
---
If literally everyone quit the game, and only 24 or however many people there are per server plays the game and bought 1st, then all you would see are 1st players. Think about it.
---
I live 30 miles outside of Boston. Def not a tourist trap. 
---
Point is $10 isn’t much. For a $100/year that comes down to $8.33/mo which still sounds like it’s within the price range of your whopper meal
---
23 bucks australian isn't dirt cheap it's just dirty.
---
I only very occasionally get grief at my camp. If I do, I just change worlds.
---
And remember there were griefers around before 1st.
---
&gt; Exactly like I’m not gonna let people judge me for how I spend my money that I earned myself.
---
They aren't judging you for how you spend your money, they are judging you for the business practices you are supporting and the impact that will have on the future of games.
---
Lol you commented a thing 4000 people have already commented and got 900 points, huh?
---
What if I told you those 2 guys actually work for Bethesda?
---
They left you a note, didnt you read it?
---
"You being all generous with the noobs is interfering with the Family's buisness interests. You're in Atomic Shop's neighborhood, who told you you could set up shop in our jurisdiction, giving away our product for free no less? No one gave you any permission to do that. So we sent Micky the Gun and Big Anthony to your place in order to "discuss" our concerns, and hopefully reach a mutual understanding regarding the way things iz gonna be from this point forward. You have a nice f***** day."
---
I have an indoor maze with narrow hallways. Playing during the day is the worst. A night is better but there still is some ambient light.
---
Just deaktivate the pazifist and camp the loot they drop when you kill them. You have the first 100% dmg hit if they startet. After I read an similar post yesterday I deaktivated pazifist my self and now I'm waiting for some good pvp.
---
Beside this, I haven't seen someone try to harass me, for the 1st abo so far.
---
Do not give Bethesda any more money. Play more worthwhile games from more worthwhile devs.
---
No, that is the price *after* VAT.  It's illegal to quote prices before VAT for sales to individuals.
---
In fact the real price difference is quite small.
---
Of the 100 GBP Bethesda gets 83.31, which is (today, assuming no horrible Brexit news comes out) 107 USD.
---
So it costs 7 dollars more a year in the UK.  No boning going on.
---
Jokes on us, it already is monetized, even if it hasnt come out yet, given that private servers are behind the worst subscription service available for games
---
The overseer quest legit doesn’t end.. the other half is supposed to be for wastelanders
---
Have you marked the emotes you have in the atom shop? You need to activate them there to be able to use them.
---
Sorry bud. It is what it is.
---
Enjoy Outer Worlds. It's a pretty decent game.
---
It's the bass instrument. It use to happen to me all the time, I haven't noticed it recently. I don't know what causes it.
---
https://youtu.be/5vDYxfOD_zI
---
Lol yes of course that’s it, everyone quit. Why didn’t I think of that. Do you even play the game?
---
Thanks man, hope you can find some enjoyment (probably not) out of this steaming pile of shit
---
How is $15 double $12? That’s a result of taxes dude.
---
&gt; I recently brought Fallout 1st.
---
Assuming you meant "bought" - you stupid sonofa\*\*\*\*\*. Those players are in the right to grief you. You should be ashamed of yourself.
---
I had not played Fallout 76 for months and when I heard about the Private World and Wastelanders DLC coming, I got excited. I wasn't playing, but I was paying attention to what Bethesda was doing. I read all patchnotes for every patch that got released, eventhough I was not playing myself. I even still had the game installed, because I was hoping that one day, I could return to this game. Because Fallout, is the franchise I grew up with, because Fallout is the franchise I loved... yes, loved. 
---
Then came the news... and Fallout 1st.
---
Not only did you break my heart but you made it crystal clear that I would never return to this game.  
---
That you, Bethesda, are only interested in cold hard cash and that instead of fixing this game and giving people what they want, for free... you would sell them their fixes, QoL improvements for a price.
---
I uninstalled the game. I uninstalled your launcher. And I will NEVER touch a single game that comes from you.  
---
You RUINED Fallout for me, you took away that little bit of hope I had for this game to get better and you totally nuked that little trust I still had in you.
---
All on one day. All because of one post. All because of Fallout 1st. And all because of your unending greed. I hope you're happy, Bethesda. I hope this was all worth it.
---
I've been pretty sure since the start that the PPK 10mm pistol (the Deliverer?) is planned as Atom Store only. I find its absence suspicious since there are 3 of most weapon types and this one was in the previous game.
---
Nice troll post. Unless...?
---
I haven't played since the 1st thing released. I am currently playing Outer Worlds, which is awesome. I am also played Satisfactory which is also awesome.
---
I just eat a snikers bar
---
Bethesda owes its remaining fan base a game that isn’t broken. But knowing this community whatever heap of filth Bethesda manages to cobble together, they’ll buy.
---
this sub Is very vocal, but does not as a whole represent the community at large.
---
Except it has nothing to do at endgame. Seriously i reached max level in the first 2 months.
---
Did you even read your own comment? “Judging you for supporting business practices” and by supporting them you mean by spending my money on it. Aka, Judging me for how I spend my money. It’s none of your business if I want to buy something I thinks worth it with money I’ve earned.
---
I haven't paid for the game, no. I would never do such a thing. 
---
They are selling content which should have been in the game at launch. The content in Fo1st should be available to everyone who paid for the game. Full stop. It's besides the point. You're focusing on a part of my argument irrelevant to the greater picture.
---
Funding predatory monetisation schemes is bad for the entire industry.
---
It's only scrap, so scrap sales or anything that you can sell made from scrap will go down the toilet. Still plenty of things that don't fit that group.
---
The subscription came with skins and stuff but of course if each month doesn't bring something new for emotes/skins then yeh it not worth to stayed subscribed.
---
oi the post is relevant shore who said it wasn't? Also, i'm going to drink some coca cola. sea ya
---
I haven't played in months. I was holding out for Wastelanders. Maybe not now. Just waiting and seeing.
---
Why are you so angry? It’s pathetic. Why do you care how somebody spends their money? Jesus.
---
Is the scrapbox account wide (one for the whole account) or is it each character have one of their own?
---
1. It's for your entire account and 5 characters. 
---
Can ju block people on friendslist, to avoid them from joining your server?
---
2. Blocking them should stop them from joining your world yes. 
---
Have you experienced dead and looted npcs when being all alone or for sure nobody els have been there?
---
3. Nope. The world's are private. Want to know how I know? Every single door EVERYWHERE... is actually closed. 
---
Whitesprings being nuked and ghouls not spawning seems to me a bug. Logging out and logging in instantly resets the mobs and your off to farm land. 
---
Character have cooldowns for looting items in world, like bobbleheads and magazines (about 2 hours). Material veins have a cooldown on 20 hours. Both timers are personal. Items have a chance to spawn at specific spots, like magazines or bobbleheads, So how have your world been looted?
---
4. My world's haven't been looted. UNLESS my timers haven't reset. Every time I go on my private world I find tons of bobbles and magazines I've never seen in public in many different places. Same goes for even normal junk/aid loot etc. 
---
Your loot resets after viewing/looting 60 containers and/or looting 180 items in open world.
---
You might wanna actually play ESO before comparing it to the shit show that is called FO76 :p
---
No slip pus anywhere. You took a sarcastic comment out of context and attempted to present it as my actual position. 
---
You ever see the movie ‘My Cousin Vinnie’?  
---
I didn’t actually shoot the sheriff, pal.
---
There is no max level?
---
&gt; It’s none of your business if I want to buy something I thinks worth it with money I’ve earned.
---
Except when it impacts the market direction, it is. Is it any of your business if everyone else buys blue widgets so that when you want a red widget there isn't anyone who makes them?
---
3 of your friends...nice try.
---
23 a month in aus as well. Could care less what it converts to in USD it's not my currency AUD is. 179 for the yearly can get bent.
---
Nope, OP is right and it's already happening. Why buy junk, ammo, fusion cores, chems, magazines, bobbleheads or even legendaries for scrip, when you can farm it all on your own server... And players who bought into F1st are mostly hoarders, anyway (which I don't mean as an insult, just a fact).
---
&gt;(can probably end the sub 2days early and get a full refund too!).
---
That’s not how subscriptions work. You’re not going to get a refund for using a service almost the entire time and then cancelling right before the renewal date. All you’re going to get if you do that is not charged the full price for the next month and loss of the service.
---
Indeed it did.
---
&gt; IF you have friends whom play regularly, Id say its worth it IMO for the pvt server alone. That noted, its shitty of Bethesda and I do feel bad for the younger crowd and those whom cant really swing the cost.
---
To be realistic, when they announced private servers at the release last year, it was kinda obvious to me, that they won't be for free and i am totally fine with that.
---
&gt;do you think Bethesda would waste their time and money putting community managers in here?
---
yes, most companies will have at least 1 CM for their gaming subreddits, sometimes the CM is responsible for multiple subs.
---
&gt;200k subs and usually 2-3k active at any given moment
---
that's a tiny amount of people, we cant see the exact concurent users but even if we go off "millionS" reddit users are still less than 1/10th of the playerbase. (probably WELL under)
---
Here is a taste:
---
 I knew this was coming and don’t care. Subscribed to Fallout 1st before I could even log back in to the game. It takes me all of 10 minutes a month to earn the money I was already spending in Atoms. Yes I think that purely cosmetics as paid content would be better but whatever. A dedicated server on demand is well worth the 12$ a month that I was *already spending*.
---
Well I can understand not playing because something new has come out but not playing because of a subscription just seems pretty dramatic to me. But everyone has their own opinions.
---
the problem with the slippery slope argument is that by the very definition of it is logically fallacious.
---
Just ignore them, most of the players don't get this game and rpg in general.  I saw on youtube a lot of unjustified hate from channels that even don't cover this game: it's a trend. 
---
I bought Fallout 1st too and i'm happy with that. I love Fallout 76 since day one and I spent so many good moments and i can't wait to see what Bethesda have next for us.
---
Are you a time traveler?
---
Don't rush the game. The best part of the game I feel is from levels 1-60ish. 
---
Explore everywhere; partly because it can be interesting; partly so you're not running into areas before you're at the right level for them.
---
Lean on melee during early game to conserve ammo. Scrap all surplus weapons and armor to learn mods. Turn on pacifist mode asap.
---
That should carry you for a while. Enjoy!
---
That's good man, glad you are still enjoying it. I just recently purchased it and am making my through the story mode.
---
I've been thinking about this since the start of this console generation. Every year the boundaries seem to keep pushing farther and farther, and people will justify it no matter what and continue to support it. Imo fuck the companies doing it, I hope the likes of EA, Acivision-Blizzard, Ubisoft, 2k, Bethesda, Epic etc push it and push it and push it until most consumers can't be bothered dealing with the shit on display. I hope this industry crashes, because as it stands AAA publishers are killing it. Perhaps if the industry crashes the only ones left to create games will be those who have a passion and belief in their products. It will be tough for the developers who aren't at fault, but some things can only go so far.
---
Tell that to the mobs.
---
Lol the market has been going this direction for a looooong time, Fallout 1st is hardly a surprise. What difference does it make to try and shame people for what they have bought? It really changes nothing, just makes you look like a dick.
---
So going by your logic if your life's hard or something in life is giving you trouble run away and do nothing as there is no point in trying to change anything ever.
---
&gt; BUT I JUST HOPE THEY DON'T!! 
---
Oh you poor fool. If Bethesda was the kind of company that had good intentions, they would have shown it a long time ago.
---
I honestly hope for you sake that you're right but history has demonstrated otherwise with Bethesda.
---
because the stash box you get in the private instance has a chance of deleting the items you put in it lol
---
And this is why I hate the player too. They are ruining the game.
---
Oddly happened twice already for me with the xbox game pass (both times got it for a quid). I totally understand that's not how most, if not all of them work but when I went to cancel the auto renew it asked me if I wanted a refund, I wasnt going to say no! Beats me how they make any money!
---
Its more like "Pay for convenience"
---
Robots and the fridge can be obtained without paying a single dime, though.
---
That’s not the point
---
but some people, actually... alot thinks its worth the money. 
---
If you dont want to spend money on something then dont. but some of us wants to and think it has value and is worth it.
---
We all play our own way. I’m a scavenger I pick up absolutely everything. At the end of a long haul I get back to camp and scrap everything and cull my numbers down to 220 all the way across the board except aluminum, adhesive, screws,gears, and spring I allow those to grow as high as they will. I keep steel at 900 and wood at 650/700. I love to craft, mod, grind legendaries, and perfect the camp. I’m also a solo player 98% of the time. The scrap box is a god send for me it completely changes the game. 
---
But not for long term subscription. Just can’t do it.
---
It has just been one thing after another since the start, and I actually quit after the first few months and only started playing again the past few weeks because I was expecting the Wastelanders. I was enjoying the game again despite the crashing, I got Waster stuff from the Atom store, the robot, the fridge, did the Pioneer scout stuff, and the 1st stuff is just another reason to quit. If they fixed the game, the crashing in particular, I would have been willing to support the game financially, if the monetization system was right, but it's not right. It's all wrong.
---
I had no idea this game was still alive. You lot are masochists!
---
I don't remember how many times I've seen the same suggestions for Atom items. But today I warn you, don't give Bethesda idea, they don't deserve them.
---
My point is that it's possible to do community content right.
---
I bought ballistic fibre once early in my game, but have never bought junk since, there is just so much in the world and it's so easy to obtain.
---
What are people going to do with this infinite junk collection? Eat it!
---
^^^ This, And if you have green thumb, go to Sylvia Homestead and pick all the corn and Razograin, and sell it to the robot venders.
---
It is, maybe not that bad, but doesn't make any sense other than robbery.
---
So...you're saying Fallout 1st has more value than a world of warcraft or ESO or FFXIV sub or xbox or playstation games pass or netflix or amazon prime or almost any other subscription based product?
---
Sounds like a fuck up more than how it was supposed to work.
---
I guess principles aren't an issue for you either.
---
Just to be clear, I don't want that to be the case.  I don't want this game to fail.  I want this game to keep getting better.  This whole 1st thing has been a HUGE misstep, and I have a bad feeling it is very indicative of the direction the game is heading.  I hope I'm wrong.
---
Yea, i wouldn't be surprised if keeping fo76 running actually costs them more money than it generates and this is like the last desprated attempt to make it profitable. So if it doesn't work, Game over.
---
What are you talking about? Did you respond to the wrong person?
---
Trust me they're around, and very scary and sad.
---
And in the current state how long it will take ? I'm reminding you that servers cost money.
---
My guess no more than 2 years. And I'm generous
---
Lol no worries friend!
---
This sub is but a sad very small fraction of players. People like to think they make a difference here but it's usually nothing but demands and tears.
---
VPN is your friend :D
---
I don’t know why you don’t have a 1k upvotes on this.  That subreddit has become so uncontrollably toxic.  I put up a nice video of people using the emotes to dance to thriller, and people are angry about that!!   They’ve grown so tiresome of attacking Bethesda they now want to take it out on other gamers.  
---
Video for reference: https://youtu.be/n5aZJLkmF3Y
---
You work for Spacers Choice, dont you?
---
Still cheaper than most mmo subs js
---
Scrapbox its reason why people are mad im also its game changing item put behinda paywall what will be next....
---
First of all, sorry for bad english, second i'm here just to tell my point of view, not ot impose anything to anyone.
---
I'm a normal person with a normal work, i have some money to use in my hobbies, i play wargames and i love videogames, one of them is Fallout, since the first one (in 1997 right?), i think i still have the box.
---
When they announced Fallout 76 i was so excited and when a friend of mine gave it to me for Christmas (i play on PC) i was so happy, i'm still happy now and when i have time i enjoy playing Fallout 76 even with all it's problems.
---
One of them, huge for me, it's that i have some ears problems and i cannot use headphones (i have to put them off after 10 minutes usually...), so usually i put voices directly on speakers, you can imagine that can be a problem with family expecially at late hours...so i usually don't use voice chat and with no text chat i'm forced to play almost alone apart some occasional events when i talk using emotes.
---
I love playing with others (just for adventure, i hate PVP, i'm usually the "helper/teacher" kind of player), and i love housing, so usually i build a city (ever played Star Wars Galaxies or Archeage?) with all commodieties for me, friends and every player that stop by, in Fallout 76 i always left all open for everyone to use, i have all crafting workbench and so on, and when someone stop there to use my camp and throw me a "heart" emote i'm happy even if i can't talk with them.
---
So my experience with Fallout 76 is like an "enhanced single player".
---
And now we are at the topic, the subscription, when at first i saw it i feel bad cause it's a bad move for Bethesda, considering all promises that they did in those months, after all, thinking about my situation, i did the math, with 15€ i have 1650 atoms, since my main work in F76 it's to build a camp, i usually spent 10€ in atoms (when they do the pack with outfit usually), so with other 5€ i have a tenth to put anywhere and an unlimited (!!! tbh the worst move of all -\_-) scrap box along with a private server and some free stuff i decided to give it a try.
---
Since my experience ad i said it's almot single player i'm enjoying the fact that i can use worksbench without being killed (i hate pvp remember? :D) and not being forced to trash all those scraps that i did with a lot of hard lonely work it's cool i have to admit, and having all those mobs for me but i wish i had some friends (not subscriberd, just friend that maybe i can help) to share it.
---
Dunno if someone of you will read all or will understand what i'm trying to say, in the end just trying to say that not everyone that decide to by a sub in a game do that to be cool and better than the others and to show them that, sometime they just do cause they want to do that and decide to use some money on it liek they do with other hobbies.
---
I hope anyway that Bethesda maybe will change this in a lower price subscription and that will let people to one-time buy some service like the tenth of the box.
---
Ok ok, i stop here, thanks for reading and hope you have fun in Appalachia :)
---
I don't want to be harsh. I don't want to hurt a developers feelings if they read my negativity. I love the game. But it has just been a disaster from the start.
---
How about a reasonable cap amount for regular mannequins and atomic shop for powered animatronic mannequins?
---
I spent 60 bucks on outer worlds and felt ripped off when the credits roll in after 20h...
---
It’s almost like this game was bolted onto a single player game with minimal effort.
---
By about $1 and you get 500x less content so, I guess?
---
LOL I DID sorry MY BAD it's almost 4am 🤦🏻‍♂️
---
Imagine being so sad that you get overtly emotional due to a common exchange between parent and child.
---
Come'on. It's a fucking game. You write like someone is attacking  human rights.
---
We know
---
It's cool, I understand. :) I was really confused for a second haha
---
I run my own azure cluster so yeah, I know servers cost money ;)
---
Well I'm guessing they use their AWS cluster for more than just FO76 - but yeah, cpu cycle time costs money and if active players drop under a 1000 for a couple of months it's bye bye servers.
---
Fast travel to Sons of Dane, go to thr house on the right. There's one in the basement.
---
I like the ranger outfit. 1650 atoms is $16.50 worth of atoms so your still getting quite a deal buying the sub over raw atoms.
---
Looks like fallout 1st whales are out in force today.
---
at least something happening in this game now
---
With Fallout 1st you don’t need to stay away from workshop. You can just load up a private server and have them all running all the time till you get board of constantly defending them.
---
Those 3 minutes that you consider so golden is being experienced by millions in way better mmos.
---
Does Todd personally visit us in the night for Fallout 3rd?
---
So you don't play you just troll this sub telling people they're stupid for buying a game? Because I can see in your comment history you have a habit of it. Get a life you total loser.
---
...? Wha? Those games are old af tho. Would you pay original retail price for them? I swear you guys are reaching.
---
Was it really that short? Like just the main quest line or including side quests etc
---
Kind of true. But I believe continously earning money would improve the service over time. Specially game servers takes lots of money monthly. Usually, what we paid for are going to the company who invested to the development of the game. They paid the developers and related people beforehand without 100% assurance that they will really earn. And what everyone paid for the game won't be enough to let the servers run for the next few years.
---
The design of Fallout 76 is more of an experimental on how to apply the core mechanics of a single-player game to multiplayer. As someone who enjoyed Skyrim, then tried their MMO expecting most of the mechanics would be applied, I was greatly disappointed that it is just similar to WOW or Final FANTASY 14.
---
As a fellow developer, I can see that the dev team is in between a rock and hard place. Fixing a lots of bugs while finding a way to raise more funds. They need more people to fix the issues and improve the game, and it takes money to hire people. I can somehow empathize with them.
---
Honestly, I felt the same without having to pay extra cash. Most of the haters from the beginning just don't understood that this game can be played alone. 95% of my main character playthrough was solo (except for public event, and nukes). I spend time exploring, searching for bit of lore, and I enjoyed the game.  
---
That being said, the important part in your story is that you find a way to enjoy the game. It's just sad you had to pay extra for that.
---
I wouldn't call it dirt cheap in fact it's on the highest end for game subscriptions...average price being £8 fallout 1st is £12... I'm trying to think of another game with a monthly sub that high and I'm drawing a blank WoW and FFXIV are cheaper...so is ESO+ and these games other far far far more content and value.
---
Fallout"s vault 69 is real.
---
If the numbers are high, wouldn't that mean that overall gamer opinion is also positive?
---
Maybe the issue is that what people perceive is gamer opinion is actually just a small subset, basically the volcal minority?
---
Let's take Japan for instance.  Many gamers would say that mobile games with in app purchases are horrible, but yet in Japan (and other eastern countries) they are incredibly popular.
---
Would you kindly pay?
---
Imagine calling someone a psychopath for being successful.
---
How out of touch with reality do you have to be...
---
See I don’t see it like that but like I said everyone has different opinions. I like the option of buying extras in a game and if that means I’m a whale or whatever people call it so be it. You yourself have just admitted you’ve bought things so in some way you are cast in the same boat as people buying FO1ST. I’m totally with what people are saying about everyone should have the scrap box. That does seem a little unfair but at the same time if you’re playing the game enough to need unlimited scrap then you’ve had more than your money’s worth so pay for a 1 month subscription. People would listen more if they wasn’t called out for buying FO1ST but to be called dumb, stupid and a lot more hateful things is not the way to get your point across.  It actually proves whats wrong with the gaming industry, toxic people playing games thinking they’re entitled to everything for free.
---
Would you kindly?
---
FO76 is not an MMORPG.
---
I'm not sure, I think the spawns of magazines &amp; dog food in watoga is more scarce. I seem to pick up less than I would in normal adventure. Yes I find them in places that I haven't before, but my usual watoga magazine run is only giving me 1 or 2 magazines &amp; I'm seeing similar for dog food. A lot less than normal.
---
Another thing I'm seeing is level 10 enemies, always thought that was caused by a low level recently going by. I'm level 330 &amp; it happens to me.
---
At westek &amp; whitesprings I've seen it a number of times. In one part of whitesprings they are always low level for me on my private server???
---
123USD for the year here in aus....bloody shitty!
---
I guess for me, $100 thrown at a game which was borked off the bat, for content that doesn't sound like a particularly large expansion is silly. 
---
I'd rather get the ESO expansions, but none of my friends still play ESO or FO76 for that matter.
---
And here in Europe all purchases, including digital sales must have VAT included in the price, which is 20% minimum, you are literally complaining about VAT
---
How do you even play this fucking game, after everything Bethesda’s done? You remind me of a woman who gets beaten by her husband every day for not cooking the chicken right but stays with him be she ‘still loves him’.
---
Welcome to the EU, where everything is taxed to all hell and your tears don't matter.
---
You deserve it for buying into this shit anyway.
---
\*yawn\*
---
No I’m genuinely curious. How do you still play this game?
---
I haven't heard it in a long time.
---
PLEASE just change how often they land!
---
As a melee build u r still just f'd when SBs attack. Only things u can do is wait, heal &amp; feel dumb. (or max &amp; equip the fireproof perk, yea next time)
---
Yesterday I needed SB DNA so I dicided to fight that 3\* Level 50 SB in the bog, it never landed, I was running in circles in a big enough, flat enough area but the floor was lava &amp; batman stayed away.
---
After a while I switched to my backup rifle supported by zer0 perks, I used up around 1k .45 ammo, 40 stims &amp; 30mins of my life. Made me growl.
---
This is quite exciting actually because this may give me three agility points that I can use for something else (not sure what yet if it's in agility), I have 14 agility at the moment and usually run with chameleon chest and one leg, swapped for poison if needed, other three unyielding with various secondary and tertiary attribute.
---
I got sneak as soon as I could and kind of blindly ran with it all the time but then put on escape artist also, overkill then.
---
Thanks, I'll have a swap about and see what happens.
---
I find posts like yours incredibly detrimental and harmful. You basically bragg with how uncritical you are, and you encourage others to also ignore problems, risks or problematic developments and instead just focus on your personal entertainment and joy. It goes against everything a mature, responsible and critical gamer should be. 
---
Of course the impressions you get are different basing on where you go. It's only natural that ingame you find people who have fun playing a game, while people who are unsatisfied will try to find a place to vent their frustration, disappointment and maybe try to change things. If they are unhappy with the game chances are way lower you will see them ingame.
---
BUT
---
What apologetic people in gaming communities need to learn is that people who complain about games care as much about the game if not more than the people defending it. If they didn't they wouldn't waste their time complaining and arguing, they'd just leave. But they don't, they stick around and try to improve things. If someone attacks the game you are having a lot of fun with, he usually doesn't try to "destroy" it or something. He is on your fucking side! 
---
If I had the choice I'd rather pick that there is too much "whining", as you call it, about a game than too little. It reminds the developers and publishers that their customers are critical, won't take every shit and can be disgruntled. Too little whining just encourages them to do whatever they want. Your post does the same, which is why in my eyes it's despicable.
---
Jesus fucking Christ do you speak English
---
How can some people (despite not playing the game anymore) continue to harass people who just want to enjoy the game.
---
The people who make it about “you’re just mad you can’t afford it” are disingenuous trash. They surely know that’s not the problem people have with it, but are just saying that to project their own insecurities. Basically it’s just something stupid they can say to make themselves feel better/superior in the complete absence of anything that would perhaps justify such an attitude.
---
I doubt hes "so" angry, more like disgusted. Fans of this franchise have every right to shame other people whose actions will eventually destroy it. Being so oblivious to the world around you and blindly throwing your money at this dumpster fire of a video game will only make it worse. Giving money to a company that's unabashedly trying to rip you off, that's what's pathetic. Not quite as pathetic as what you're doing, but it's still something only a complete idiot would do.
---
Ye the spots have a set low level, you have to clear them out to increase the level on the next spawn. Juat like with silos or horde events (kill low level adds and next wave will be closer to your level)
---
You're making subjective statements and stating them as fact
---
No one is going to change your mind.  And what value is there in telling you the reasons?
---
The game is the same with or without the scrapbox... I pay for a premium service and i want premium features, that's all take it ez
---
I’m asking for your reason, the way I see it everyone here is like a woman who’s husband beats her every day but she doesn’t leave because he ‘really cares’
---
Didn't know that, thanks
---
I did all quests i was able to find, except for like 2-3, one was finding "science" weapons, but all i found kinda disappointed me, so i didn't bother to search for the rest, the other was finding outfits...  rather dull fetch quests. So yea it's rather short for a rpg and besides quests there is nothing to do in the world. If you strech it, you might get 25h, 30h at max out of it. But 20 seems appropiate for a normal playthrough.
---
Those are to MMORPG's.
---
Exactly.  You already have a belief about the people here.  
---
No amount of "I have a good time" or "I've gotten hundreds of hours of enjoyment" will mean anything to you, you'll just chalk it up to some form of stockholm syndrom and move on.
---
If any future DLC needs to be paid I'm going to get a refund, no matter how much hours I played.
---
Why does it bother you if I like playing a game. I understand if the games not for you and you’d rather play something else. What I don’t understand is why you come on reddit and tell people what they should or shouldn’t play. Let it go already.
---
Fallout4 is a better, more enriched game with a lot more content than Fallout76.. and it's older as well. 
---
Personally, I'd rather pay full price for Fallout4 than full price for Fallout76. I'd get a lot more content, a better storyline, a better game experience, and not get nickle &amp; dimed to death by things that should've already been part of the game to begin with.
---
Plus.. I'd never have to deal with other players.. and that's the most rewarding part.
---
Yeah, because bugs and crashes are still here, but 1st is cool so
---
But therein lies another problem: I don’t see what enjoyment you can find out of a fundamentally broken experience you can have?
---
It’s because of this game there will never be another fallout, as long as there are people paying away for this.
---
They’re old yeh and they’re all better games than Fo76 
---
That’s why the OP is posting this
---
It seems like it's intended to have different playthroughs with different outcomes or player routes, maybe that's why? Like do a good playthrough,  neutral, bad, etc.
---
Honestly I'm ok with a short RPG as making sure my toddler doesn't murder herself is usually taking the majority of my time, so that's somewhat appealing to me
---
The only negative thing I'm heard is gun difficulty on everything, and considering that it's more of a nitpick than an actual debilitating problem, this game sounds so good.
---
Thank you very much for getting back to me. It was a good read.
---
The "AAA" gaming industry is so dead 😔
---
Games have cost $50 since the *90s*, $60 since 2006 or so.  It was also possible back then to pay even more... Chrono Trigger was $80.  Games have gotten bigger and bigger, with millions and millions in their budgets,  yet the base price has remained virtually the same for almost 30 years. Obviously, game devs need to make money.  Games have unequivocally never been cheaper.  I'm not going to purchase FO1st, it doesn't interest me, but to say its "killing video games" is hyperbolic and wrong.  I'd argue that microtransactions and subscriptions are the reason we're getting amazing gaming experiences at the same pricetag.  It really is as easy as not sending money on extra stuff if you don't want to spend the money.
---
Source?
---
Well for one so we can stop hearing about this in the news cycle. At least then Bethesda can move on and make something actually decent (fuck fallout four was a masterpiece compared to this), it’s not about whether it’s ‘for me’ it’s about whether this game is expired like a carton of milk.
---
That's so sad yikes.
---
In the same place where Clinton’s emails are.
---
If only we could go back to the times of oblivion.
---
You understand the game needs to make money in order to pay people so they can bring more free content. Do you think there paying the Wastelanders voice actors with bottle caps and atoms.
---
Also, there’s mobile games where $100 is a *gamble for something* that you want.
---
People who pay money for a product are entitled to a working version of that product? Do you know how to English?
---
" It’s really renewing my interest in the story "
---
"story"
---
in any case the subscription is here to stay as they can't jest cancel it. The big question is will it become mandatory in a year ? how many players will stay active to support this .
---
Only a handful of players have mule accounts , there is no reason to make more than one character per account ( its the same char jest with different loot) . 
---
I personally can't force my self to play any more after ~300h of play time of the same loot box grind for the same legendarys. 
---
I'll wait for next year expansion fore more quest lines
---
You stole my words!
---
The first month is going to be profitable. They put a costume in that everyone has been wanting. So everyone who wanted it bought it. The real question is how many people are going to continue the sub. I know I'm not I cancelled just as fast as I bought it and those are the real stats I want to see. Not how many signed up, but how many cancelled.
---
I enjoy the game, I wanted atoms, and one month of FO1st was $1-$2 more than the atom points alone would have been. I found value so I bought it, I want more game long term and I understand that will cost money to produce. You didn't find value and you didn't buy it, you don't like the game and don't have a desire for more content in a game you dislike and probably don't actually play. The market is working as it always has. I avoid most AAA games because I don't find value in their loot box mechanics or 'card' based collection systems like FIFA/MAdden so I don't buy those games. I'm also not a child so I don't hate these people for purchasing something they enjoy and find personal value in even If I don't. 
---
 
---
If you want to make an actual difference and not just collect karma in this massive circle-jerk, go buy a game wiyhout MTX. That speaks to these companies, over the top Reddit posts are just preaching to the choir of a subreddit that has disliked the game long before Fallout 1st was implemented.
---
amaaaaazing
---
its a game for enjoying the time and waste it so it should be free or cheap but when guys pay money it will be kind of business so all companies wont accept this small amount and ask more and more.
---
we should all stop paying maybe not for us but for our children
---
The top one is not bragging seems more like he is explaining why he has it and he says it’s worth it to him I mean it’s his money.
---
The bottom one a bit more spicy be at the end of the day he is right it’s his money you simply can’t tell people what to do with their own money they enjoy the game and content and feels it’s worth. 
---
I think cod is a horrible franchise from a horrible company same with NBA 2k but People buy it every year it’s there money and enjoyment I haven’t played cod sense black ops 2 and don’t plan to start any time soon
---
The medical insurance costs my employer EUR 1291 a month.  I paid my daughters university fees a couple of months ago, it was EUR 500 if I remember rightly.
---
Exactly, I sorta get private worlds being a paid service (if it actually worked) but all that content you have to pay for MONTHLY
---
👍🏻
---
I'm solo too. But I tend to be more selective and just pick up the stuff I know I'm short of, or stuff I know I can bulk to sell. If I'm going on a new build I think of the types of materials I'll be using and try to prepare in advance. I've played since the Beta so I know the good spots for the hard-to-find stuff.
---
As far as picking up everything, I remember when they changed the system so that each Robot vendor has the full 1,400 cap budget. I was in Grafton when the change happened and I stripped that place bare, selling everything to the Responder Robot Vendor at the first aid station. I just managed to clean him out of caps. I pity the person who scrolled through the robot's inventory after I'd finished with him - an entire town's scrap complement in list form.
---
No what defines a good and bad game is very objective. What defines an enjoyable or not enjoyable game is subjective. 
---
Also if people support fallout 1st Bethesda wont stop there lmao why would they?
---
Actually in the general terms and eula - they can cancel your subscription (and everyone's) if it's not feasable to run. They are not obligated to keep it running.
---
Up my arse
---
Yea you can have different outcomes, just like in New Vegas, yet the game is significantly shorter than new vegas.
---
Hoo wee.. I can only imagine the shit show when CD Projekt Red tells us that the multiplayer will have MTX's. I'm sure it will. It's the way of this day. They said there will be no MTX in the main game.
---
I bought those things with Atoms. I am entitled to a working game that doesn't crash for a full price, not a year later a game still crashing and them thinking they are entitled to more money. You see it's all about their actions, and has nothing to do with me. You can try and make this about "people thinking they are entitled" but the only people who think they are entitled are those at Bethesda who think they are entitled to keep wanting more and more money for a broken game. They are not entitled to any more of my money. I will not be spending another penny on anything with the name Bethesda or Zenimax attached. That is how this works. And there are many people who feel exactly the same way as me. We are entitled and have rights as consumers. And any company or corporation who tries to step on those rights will find out soon enough where they stand, legally and financially.
---
You red it ?!
---
&gt; that's a tiny amount of people
---
Show me a Fallout 76 community that is greater than this sub?
---
There are general Fallout communities that are larger. Twitter has 1.5 million. Fallout Facebook is also in the millions as well. Same too with the official Bethesda forums.
---
Pair it down to just Fallout 76 though, this is one of the largest ones. Nothing else even comes close. 
---
The official Fallout 76 on Facebook hasn't been updated since the game's launch. Other groups are like in the low 10k. Nowhere near 200k. Fan forums like No Mutants Allowed are tiny in comparison and, as far as I'm aware at least, don't have a CM presence.
---
Of course the 200k figure aren't all active and formerly active players, granted. Not saying they all are. However, find a better representative group of Fallout 76 players? We're about as representative as an active online community gets and sizeable enough to be a statistically significant representation.
---
To say that this sub is in no way representative of the player base is BEST is misleading. The way it's been brought up here, it's more like gaslighting.
---
I once met a nice old man. He was german and knew just enough English to form simple sentences. Anyway  he told me he has 3 chars and this is his lowest level. He then dropped a ton of mats I needed, and plans for a fusion reactor (i think). I added him as a friend, and then he left.
---
No, it is not. Much like it's not objective what defines a good and a bad dish. It's all about personal taste.
---
Let me remind you in a bout a month all those who decided to purchase a single month for all the little goodies will find out just how broken that new stash box is.. it's hilarious it's deleting peoples junk.. now watch what happens after the 30 days.
---
Skimmed through it for the meaty bits ;-)
---
This isn’t an expansion. All actual expansions are free (is wastelanders coming out in a few months). If you see value in the sub, don’t buy it. It’s pretty simple.
---
Did they suicide by gunshot to the back of the head?
---
I think this is one of the fairest statements about the subscription.  We may have been in a different position for what a sub would have offered if the game would have been launched today in its current state.
---
Has anyone purchased the US subscription with a VPN to get it cheaper?
---
&gt;disgusted
---
That. Thank you.
---
Listen to this guy. He is a scollege tudent after all
---
Yeah it's totally not the fanboy's fault for throwing their money at bad anti consumer monetization. These companies force these people to pay and defend them at gun point how did we all forget!
---
Todd Howard put a child's foreskin in your bum?
---
Just curious? Have you ever played this game? Since looking at your post history looks like you just recently came on the boards to ask you "serious question"
---
If you haven't played it, how can you objectively say that the experience is fundamentally broken?  Or are you just taking the words from some angry players (and some people who don't even play the game)
---
Yea, and until further notice my game launches and works just as everyone else's.
---
The problem is not the subscription in and of itself.
---
It's that not every games justify having one. FO76 certainly cannot given the state of the game and the measly benefits a subbed member gets. 
---
If in few years from now when the game was in a finished/fixed state (no more bugs, alot of endgame content, npcs, etc) they introduced the sub model granting you substancial benefits, i would argue that *maybe* it would be a good thing to get. But i repeat as of now its not. 
---
It's simply preying on all the fanatics/whales too far gone to realize he things for what they are. And the fact that said people keep defending Bethesda proves my point.
---
The resoning as to why one would get the subscription in this case is entirely irrelevent, only thing that matters is tha they did. And therefore they are, in the grand scheme of things holding a "go ahead" sign for all the gaming industry to keep trying to monetize absolutely everything further and furter, even in broken games that dont even deserve it.
---
Well in Russia it costs about 1070 roubles a month or 8500 a year. For comparison standard edition of the game costs 1300 roubles (tho it seems to be on sale atm for 780 RUB) on [Bethesda.net](https://Bethesda.net) and an average person in Russia earns around 1500 roubles per day so...yeah, you get the idea. They basically ask us to buy the game every month.
---
I hear that bass all the time, it's driving me mad X\_x
---
He promised it would bring me eternal riches
---
Some people don't appreciate you ruining video games for them.
---
The only ones vocally supporting fallout 1st are Bethesdas PR f@ggots puppeteering multiple reddit accounts in this sub
---
And it really depends on whether Bethesda draws a line or keeps milking its userbase. As of right now, 1st is not game breaking for non paying users. It could become tho, if they keep adding stuff that gives some sort of competitive advantge. I guess we'll see in the next months.
---
People who defend trash like this are the same people, as the ones who create it. Everything to make their own life a little better, even if that little costs other people 20 times as much.
---
First of all this game is being made by Bethesda Game Studios Austin. Todd’s still working on TES5  and Starfield  and I’m sure you’ll get Fallout 5 after that. For now why don’t you play some Fallout 4 and leave this reddit because you are no longer a part of the 76 community.
---
Don't call people dumb when you're being dumb.  That one pound is worth more than one dollar doesn't make the pound stronger than the dollar.  The strength of a currency is measured by the movement over time.  The long term trend is for the pound to fall against the dollar, so the pound is weaker than the dollar.
---
(I remember when one pound used to get you more than two dollars, now it gets you $1.28).
---
Actually since what you spend your money on affects other people and other games yeah sorry it's not just your business anymore. Tough.
---
No they wiped it, like with a cloth
---
I did just come to the board, because after a solid year of Bethesda ramming you people in the ass you still play, and whenever they do you people just don’t put down the damn game and say ‘hey maybe we shouldn’t support this anymore’. 
---
I don’t get how you can continue to play the game after everything that’s happened.
---
we knew the private servers were going to have a fee since before the game was released.
---
&gt;no longer part of the fallout 76 community 
---
Glad to see I’m not a domestic violence victim
---
My god what's your problem with fallout 1st...!? What did you except to have private servers for free... Stop this fxcking complaining already...
---
You're the exact kind of person responsible for the market going this direction. Boy isn't that ironic. The people supporting this look like dicks fyi.
---
It wasn't hard to read.
---
I bought that robot with my hard earned atoms I got from those crappy challenges thank you very much
---
And you're heavily damaging the "AAA" gaming industry by doing so. Thanks!
---
I've played it. I like fallout better, Even in it's broken state.
---
Even speaking as somebody 100% opposed to First, their actions are pretty pathetic. Disagreeing with the subscription is one thing but it's unacceptable to attack members of our own community just because they paid for a service.
---
Hope you run into fewer of "that kind" of person in the future.
---
Yeah we're all hyped for that sub fee to get past the title menu in starfield!
---
So everyone that want what promised to be free after the initial purchase is now entitled?! yeah whatever you say man.
---
You people act like you have Stockholm syndrome, you keep getting rammed up the ass by Bethesda but you don’t leave. It’s like a woman who won’t leave her husband who beats her every night because he is a ‘caring person’
---
&gt; $ donates the USA dollars when used by most people,
---
You mean denotes, not donates.
---
It's also not true, most countries that use dollars just write "$", only talking about CAD, AUD, NZD or whatever when they talk to Americans.
---
r/Conspiracy is having a field day with this one!
---
Not everyone hates video games like you do.
---
As an imaginary exercise . lets say they will cancel.
---
The backslash by fan base and the media will be the same as when they introduced it, loss of future revenue that the suits will not accept.
---
Some one will throw tomatos at Todd eventually even if he personally have nothing to do with this but only because he's a public face of the game...
---
Eat the rich
---
&gt; Too little whining just encourages them to do whatever they want.
---
Yea I was never the one going after tin foil hat theories. I am pretty sure Bethesda cares about the game just as much as we do. I have seen way too many posts around from people claiming to fight for the right of consumers, when it simply is that they would probably shut up if a few of these bonuses they criticize so much would be handed out for free. Some of these "knights" have even stated it.
---
No one is trying to flip capitalism around here, there's just people caring for their own gains.
---
Check under skins in the atomic shop.
---
Because. It. Affects. Everyone.
---
that's wrong. show me the evidence. peak was around 450k. estimates lately have all been under 40k. if you show me up to date reputable evidence i'll change my mind, because my numbers are estimates from publications. nothing more.
---
I heard 18.00 in Canada.
---
By becoming a Fallout First member your showing bethesda that despite the fucking dumpster fire that is FO76 you are willing to spend money on it. It just encourages devs to be lazy
---
Glad to see something other than complaining on the reddit for a change 😂
---
Release Elder scrolls and starfield, push FO76 out of the window - the amount of backlash noise will be drowned out by the release of two games? Not sure though - not a lot of previous cases to compare to, plus as with plenty of services - once a server dies, there are always people to create something to emulate it, i.e. GameSpy services.
---
Welcome to online gaming, if you pay for something the majority of the player base doesn’t have, they’ll bully you because of it, some are not mature about it than other but it’ll happen regardless
---
Complete lack of empathy is what psychopathy is. Read a book sometimes.
---
When I got the game pass ultimate 1 month for 2 dollars dra, it converted all of my Xbox live gold to game pass ultimate for free. Now I've got game pass til April for 2 bucks. Maybe Xbox is willing to take a short term loss in the hopes that someone like me sticks around in the future
---
Better then telling people they can no longer play unless they pay more. No thanks.
---
I honestly don't think CD Project Red ever will. They aren't publically traded (to my knowledge) and have built their whole reputation and brand on being pro consumer and making good games for the sake of games. There are still developers with integrity out there.
---
I don't remember that someone's said it when they introduced the game last years March ? This is when i preordered and it would be a point in my decision to pre-order or not.
---
True, but there was promises that all content afer release would be free. I'm fine with private servers costing money, but the other items should not have been (minus the caps). It's poor judgment for Bethesda to go back on thir word like they did and not explain why they changed their stance. I think the owners of 76 deserve an explanatiom and transparency. Just think, if they said Look guys we are running low on money for this project and without your support on XYZ the game will be forced to be shut down. Instead they just slap us in the face with the changes and its up to us to interrupt them.
---
I was very excited for the game when released and played through the bugs. The fact of the matter is that so many companies have moved toward what Bethesda has just done in terms of cash grabish style addins to the games. That gamers are sick of it. Plus when it happens to the franchise you love you are extremely disappointed.
---
What's everything that's happened?  You came on here to say everyone is getting "rammed in the ass" using your words.  
---
So, please tell me, knowing the history of the game - all the quotes on what they had planned, all the things they've added to the game, both good and bad. 
---
What is the history of the game over the past year? What are all the horrible and also good, things that have been implemented?
---
And now blizzard is making mobile diablo games and selling out to dictators to protect their bottom line.
---
I mean saying someone lacks empathy for being proud of being successful is 100% out of touch with reality.
---
The change is inevitable... those that refuse change are left behind. What in life isn’t more expensive now than it was just even 5-10 years ago. The subs to F1 aren’t killing video games, we’re the ones supporting it!
---
You’ve got to get out of this subs hive mind and stop being so pessimistic.
---
Every company in the whole world make money with exclusive stuff and I’m not just talking about the gaming industry. It’s how companies run and no one is going to change that. So today I bought my daughter a build a bear but to get its exclusive outfit that my daughter really wants for her birthday I had to buy it in a online in a online bundle that cost more money. That’s how companies make their money and I’m sure Bethesda isn’t going to care less if a small amount of players stop playing their game as they’ll just make more money other ways. I’m not going to replay again as I don’t want to get into an argument with anyone, I’m not taking about you, you’ve been quite polite. Just everyone has their own opinion on what’s ok and what’s not and arguing about it is not helping.
---
Mate if anyone has a problem it’s the person who doesn’t play the game anymore and and instead of playing a different game, he gets on reddit and tells everyone else they should share his opinion.
---
The history of the past year? how about since launch Bethesda has consistently screwing you over since launch. Don’t pretend to have your head in the sand.
---
Instead of money, you give give them endless critisim which in turn drives them to suicide. It's a win win both ways really. No more bad games and money in your pocket
---
By that logic nobody should go on any reddit unless they’re strictly involved. Seems boring. Oh well at least I’m not the one playing Bethesda’s anthem
---
Not everyone uses the handmade.
---
Minecraft/Mojang is now owned by Microsoft - how long do you really expect them to keep doing it for free?
---
My experience with private worlds is the same
---
Not our problem. It's up to bethesda/zos to make a marketable game that attracts players. If they can't do that we shouldn't be subsidising them. Had they fixed base game and added appealing content then the player base would be healthy enough to support the game through MTX, which is what they originally intended. The game had a rough launch and that put people off, the updates since have been lackluster which has also put people off. These are problems for  bethesda/zos to fix.
---
You leave my breakfast alone.
---
&gt;. Is it any of your business if everyone else buys blue widgets so that when you want a red widget there isn't anyone who makes them?
---
Nope, still none of your business. Re-read your comment. You are advocating harassing people for their purchase decisions.
---
If your are walking down the street and drinking can of cherry coke, would I be justified in harassing you based on that because as a whole the industry is trending towards phasing out my favourite flavour? 
---
How about shopping online? Would I be justified harassing you for doing it because local shops can't compete?
---
I understand you are frustrated but harassing people for their purchase decisions ONLY harms the your people you are harassing and does less than nothing in furthering your goals of ensuring supply of red widgets or whatever.
---
There are some forms of protest and action which will may have an impact and further your cause - this is not one of them.
---
Are we calling criticisms “unjustified hate”
---
That’s seems a little disingenuous
---
It's not tho
---
This the way the industry is moving, the traditional games companies see the money mobile gaming and free to play companies are making and want to integrate these types of revenue streams into their business models. 
---
The only way to fight back is for people to stop playing the game completely. Not to buy games on preorder, and not to buy DLC until it releases. Unfortunately we only make up a small vocal part of the community so game companies will look at the sales figures from the rest and set their marketing and sales strategies accordingly.
---
It also comes down to value for money on a personal note, i will buy this as I was spending more than the £13 monthly subscription charge on atoms only each month. So I see it as a good deal. 
---
1100 atoms is £7.99 a month which is £95 for 12 months. In the UK the fallout 1st yearly subscription is £99. So I look at it this way for the one off yearly subscription payment, I get 6600 extra atoms, an unlimited scrap box, survival tent, exclusive cosmetics, and private server for an extra £5. 
---
the subscription costs £8.25 a month, less than the cost of a couple of pints in London pub or a takeaway meal. and if you are playing with friends on a private server it's even better value.        
---
I think a lot of people will think the same and buy the service as well.
---
We dont give a fuck what beth gets, it depends on what we pay, and we pay 15 euros.
---
Have you even played it?
---
And are you really comparing a voluntary subscription to domestic abuse?
---
In August when Pete Hines was asked about Mods and Private servers, it was posted in PC Gamer (and I'm done pulling that quote up for people, they can go search through my history or google search themselves) but:
---
* Fallout 76 is always going to be online
---
* Private Servers are going to be hosted by Bethesda
---
* Servers will have a fee
---
* Mods will only be available for private servers.  
---
It was talked about on this board when the news came out, I remember the discussions about it. It didn't last very long though - back then everyone had their plans for their roleplaying characters and guilds and factions they wanted to start - even though we didn't even have information on how any of that could work.
---
- The whole reason the atom shop exists is because its supposed to support the game. Where do you think that money's going if they suddenly need the sub to support the game?
---
- Who are you to tell me what I do and don't like and what I do and don't want? And what I do or don't play??
---
- Many people who purchase loot boxes and fifa packs don't do so because they find enjoyment or value lmao hello? They do it because they're gambling mechanics that prey on peoples psychological issues. Are you someone who actually thinks lootboxes are "fun surprise mechanics" ???
---
- I don't buy any game with bad monetization thanks. It also doesn't do anything. The best way to make a difference is through using your voice and discouraging others from spending money.
---
Hm, I'm a bit mixed by that but I think I will still try it out, maybe wait for the price to drop a bit
---
I'm happy for those who are still playing. All five of you.
---
I did and it looked like nothing happened. I will doing it some more. Thanks
---
I didn't think it would be like this. I thought it would be 10 points nothing else.
---
You never clock out eh? It's reddit we're all entitled here. Criticism is not hate, in fact I join the discussion out of love for the franchise. Arguments are fine if they're based in reality... from your comment history I don't expect evidence based arguments coming from you. But time will tell. I'm done talking to you and will be blocking to avoid you dragging this on any further.
---
There have been images datamined of mailboxs. I'm assuming this is what they are. When we will get them? Who knows. 😕
---
I’m not talking about the voluntary subscription, although that’s part of it, I’m talking about the consistent controversy surrounding this games shitshow development and handling. The games a broke mess and will always be a broke mess but you don’t care because you had fun *sometime ago*. 
---
The domestic abuse comparison is pretty fitting.
---
That is in Australian dollars. Pretty silly to compare different unadjusted currencies because you know... currency conversation / purchasing power parity.
---
What they should have done, is release PTS instead of the subscription. The community would have loved to help bugproof Wastelanders, and introduce the idea of the scrapbox with the excuse of testing server stability with unlimited scrap.
---
Then when wastelanders dropped 1st would have made everyone happy, couple that with a free week to bring more people in, give the scrapbox to everyone and give to premiums a 200 lbs account-wide stash. Use the TENT as content with the Squirrel badges, not paid garbage.
---
Then make private servers require a different character than Adventure and don't allow any back and forth. This ensures no paid advantage and the possibility of real control over servers when modding drops.
---
It's not difficult to please players, but somehow Bethesda managed to make the wrong decision on every single count. It's almost impressive when you think about it.
---
The Outer Worlds is a great game. Tons and tons of dialog and choices that you have to make lol
---
Of course!
---
You can't even give examples of how they have been screwing us over?  Can you give any examples of the things they added to the game?
---
I mean fo76 is just fallout 4 minus story, minus umlimited stash and minus proper building plus the ability to lag around your friends. But I'm sure there's a mod for that for fallout 4
---
1) exchange rates. 
---
2) countries still charge taxes on software
---
Psychopaths are more likely to be successful in all fields of life. I think you're confusing psychopathy with serial killers.
---
Not for nothing, because I think the thrust of your post is on point, but if you want new content, revenue has to come from somewhere.
---
15 years ago, we got horse armour DLC, and not $15 a month packages, true enough. But 20-15 years ago, we got the game we bought at release, and nothing else. Expansion packs (in actual physical media!) only got made for games where the revenue was almost guaranteed (C&amp;C, Warcraft 2 etc.). Patches were either non-existent or in a release cycle of ‘whenever we have time away from a revenue generating project’.
---
I’m not at all convinced that this implementation is good value (certainly not for me), but it’s easy to forget that if you want more content for a game, from a studio, it’s got to come from someone, somewhere, and that someone is going to need paying.
---
Or rather because you ran out of options.
---
Same, mine didn’t get downvoted but I got all the normal bullshit of “it’s just limited time” “this is as far as they’ll go” “it’s so minor”
---
Take that up with your government and the EU then.
---
Yup it's a good quest with good rewards
---
lol
---
I did, and that condition bar was barely moving, if it was moving. I will keep going around bashing.
---
I think now . People who game are paving the way for this sort of thing to become the norm now and to me as an older gamer I long for the days of just plugging in my console and playing a game with next to 0 issues from the off.
---
Bethesda have 2 options .. either go free to play or just let the game die now. The game was a disaster from the off and just keeps going from one disaster to another.
---
Although I’ve played the game and given it a chance . It just doesn’t feel like a fallout game to me especially after 3, New Vegas and 4 . Fallout 76 for a better word is terrible in places and no NPCs from the start probably put a lot of people off as well the whole atom shop debacle which again just keeps getting worse..
---
I for one am done with this game and Bethesda for now  and just hope they get it right with the next “big” game they do be it elder scrolls or whatever there busy with
---
Tomorrow
---
In case you have a Xbox or win10. you can get the game pass and play it for like 4$ i think
---
You deserve it dor supporting bad business practice and supporting the downfall of gaming ad we know it.
---
Deal with it
---
Dude you have to be kidding, you don’t remember the ‘Christmas special emote pack?’ The power armor edition? The 20 dollar paint schemes? The games constant broken nature and bugs? Nothing *good* has happened, the game has remained a broken mess that only exists so that the atom shop keeps itself online.
---
Wild guess, because I don't work there... they ran out of money to keep the game going with just the atom shop, and in order to keep servers going, they realized they needed a different profit model. Here's the bottom line: Do you want them to keep servers up or not?  Necessary evils are a part of life.
---
If you dislike what they have done so horribly, then your best option is to go find that game that won't ever break your trust. Nothing wrong with that attitude at all, in fact it helps drive improvement. I'd bet my house the big wigs at Beth care a lot more about the how many people go play another game than how many keep plying after they (perhaps rightfully so) complain on reddit.
---
That's really not what a psychopath is
---
Well... Hopefully the child is at least 17+. Because this game can get pretty bad at times, especially with the voice chat.
---
I swear, some parents astound me. When we were watching the first Deadpool, there was a family in the row ahead of us, and the dad would tell his kids to close their eyes (never their ears) during some of the scenes. All the kids were under 10. Parent of the decade right there.
---
Well, i thought it was just my imagination but now i realize other people noticed it. I've been using the exact same perks and exact weapon and yet somehow now it breaks way faster.
---
31 . currently it would cost me 379 AUD to buy all of them, that is 17 % off the normal price though lol
---
Just like Epstein.
---
Before I get downvoted by fanboys, add me so I can harass you too.
---
You're basically a big oil company share holder now, you deserve to be harassed
---
As someone who has good friends who have suffered domestic abuse this is awful comparison. I’ve played the game for over 600 hours and have not been abused. I hope you never have to suffer actual abuse. 
---
Do you even own the game? Do you really feel like you are suffering the same as someone who actually experiences domestic abuse? Anywhere even close? Disgusting.
---
It's funny how everybody in this sub is bragging about "loving the game and Bethesda now ruined it" and mocking everybody who paid 1st membership, but don't even think, that the game has to be profitable. Servers running in Amazon cloud, developers fixing bugs/developing wasterlanders and a lot of other people just won't pay themselves. Or do you think Bethesda (or any other company) is charity?
---
Say what you want, but this game has low playerbase and selling cosmetic items was clearly not profitable. So game would be probably shutdown in few months/maybe even weeks, wasterlanders cancelled without any actions for increasing revenue done now. You say you would gladly pay membership if Bethesda would include all good items to basic game, thats nice of you, but how many people would done this same way?
---
When your game cost less than add ons
---
Neither did you, apparantly
---
Took out Fifty + and the condition is still about the same as when I crafted it, and had the gunsmith/weapons artisan perk off,
---
Yes I forgot to add the whitespring bug which me and another player experienced aswell.
---
Thanks
---
Okay, so let me get this straight - you are hanging around in the forum of a game you don't like, making sour judgements against (clearly lovely) people who are just trying to share a bit of heartfelt joy? Priceless! You are definitely in no position to be feeling sorry for others! 😂
---
It’s not for everyone. 
---
There’s no need to get FO1st subscription for most of the “benefits” offered.  Practically all offered benefits have already been resolved by players using existing game mechanics or play styles.
---
In my view, there are 2 main reasons to consider getting the subscription:
---
1. Private Worlds: for play ambience; playing preferences; playing with friends or escaping grieving;
---
2. Convenience: especially for those players who have limited time to play and where saving 10 minutes in a session is a significant factor for game enjoyment (if that’s worth the price)
---
It won’t let you repair after killing 50? It doesn’t need to break to repair it.
---
What the fuck
---
hey, go share this story on the r/fo76filthycasuals sub (i hope i wrote it right?) they'll love it. 
---
and aww that's so nice, I'm glad we're living in a time where parents can help their kids in games, and I'm glad the mom talked to you! i remember one of the first interactions i had in this game, i was lv 14 and i wanted to make friends so i went after ppl on the map, ended up dead at the top of the world to some super mutants, and i got a team invite, they started talking to me and asking me questions and helped me get revenge on the super mutants, i was so nervous about talking to people, especially because english isn't my native language but it felt great. anyway that was like almost a year ago, i was going through some bad times and my real life friends were nowhere to be found, so i made many more friends in fallout after that and i still play and talk to them every day, some have moved on to other games but we keep in touch. i hope you make some friends on fallout too! don't be afraid to go up to a random person and try talking to them, maybe they need it too. have a great day!
---
Bad thing is you need a lvl2 gunsmith perk to craft it, mine is at lvl4
---
Well, You can't critic what you don't even know... i'm not saying that every game channel on yt is hypocritical, but as far as I saw they are milking it.
---
why would they buy? if you can store as much junk scrap as you want u can just farm unlimited amounts and make your own ammo. no need to buy from others. Many people buy bundles because they like to store more other stuff with the 800 limit than just scrap so buy it when they need it but now you wont have to conserve space.
---
For a game who's $100/year subscription "private servers" dont  even give you the option to host your own server (because they cant give you a good enough reason to pay for anything if they did), I honestly dont really care if they need money for servers, as a product, paying into any of this is a complete waste.
---
You could pay the humble bundle subscription for less, and soon you'll be able to CHOOSE 3 games  to keep every month. (As opposed to 3 random games), so the value of the subscription is non-existent for any consumer, regardless of whether or not the person buying it thinks it's worth it.
---
Why does it matter though? It doesn’t need to break for you to repair it. It just needs some condition loss.
---
Jesus the amount of misinformation in this comment is staggering. 
---
- Games are the cheapest and easiest to produce they've ever been. 
---
- You only get the "base version" of a game for $60 most video games are at least $70+. Usually complete with 6 different higher priced tiers. 
---
- Game companies now make ridiculous money from product placement, advertising deals, pre-order incentives, the transition to digital, much larger game sales, MTX, battle passes, season passes and so forth. 
---
- All of the publishers that heavily monetize their games have billions of dollars and some of the most overpaid CEO's in the world. 
---
- These huge publishers regularly not just pay no tax whatsoever on the billions they rake in but they also get 10s of million tax back. 
---
- You literally pay more tax than all of activision and your tax money goes to them. 
---
- The current short term monetization model of trying to make all the money in the world because capitalism cannot last long term unless they add more and more monetization to our games. 
---
- Almost if not all of the most critically acclaimed games of the last decade have been complete $60 no MTX or sub based games. The Outer Worlds just came out and is a huge hit already and it has no sub or MTX. 
---
- In fact lots of high profile "AAA" LIVEEE SERVICEEEE games that have come out recently that have had MTX have been hot garbage. 
---
Do I really need to go on? 😔
---
More like private seasion than private server.
---
You don't have to pay in shit in addition to what you already paid... but someone does.  Thats why these are OPTIONAL services.  You don't NEED fancy outfits or fancy furniture or a convenience item that saves you five seconds of actually playing the fucking game.  But someone out there is willing to pay for it, and it's their disposable income that continues to pay for the game.
---
For the millionth mother fucking time, live service games DO NOT follow the same development cycle as regular games.  In any other Bethesda game they don't have to worry about indefinite costs.  They push out the game and the planned DLC and then when those are over with they're done and their investment of time, money and resources is over and the money coming in beyond that is a profit.  Thats not how live service games work, you need to keep money coming in through some form of monetization beyond the initial purchase or at some point you stop making money and start losing money.  Video game developers/publishers arent fucking charities, they're COMPANIES and exist to make money.
---
Sounds like a problem on your end. Honestly haven’t crashed in months.
---
And? Sorry who are you to tell me what is and isn't important to me?
---
You guys don't recognise a troll when you see one? 🤷
---
I always sell plenty of steel, copper, adhesive, they sell good but I can see people stocking up more and not buying
---
Somehow i ignored it apparently.
---
That’s absolutely fair. 
---
I don’t think it was ever their intention to not have pay for convenience items. I think some people got on stage and not intentionally but did a poor job explaining that they wouldn’t have pay to win (Guns, Armor, levels). 
---
I also think 76 should have been a free game from the start and I still believe that. I don’t personally think anything they have offered for sale gives any competitive advantage (it’s merely convenience in my opinion) and I don’t think they will ever lock story content behind a pay wall, that will always be free.
---
But your opinion is valid and justified and I too would like them to just come out and clarify what type of content they intend to be paid and what they promise will never be for sale. And at the end of the day just an apology for the miscommunication (whether intentional or unintentional).
---
I dont even play the game anymore but i kind of want to buy it just to see you nerds squirm hahaha
---
&gt;Exp boost is seen in way to many games, that could also be a next.
---
Boy, nobody tell this guy about all the different things in the game that boost your XP, like sleeping and certain food and drinks! 
---
&gt;What if you get a new equipment option called wallet much like the backpack. BUT NOW all your carryweight bonuses are doubled.
---
Again, nobody tell this guy about the perk cards and food and drinks that do ***exactly*** this. 
---
&gt;It all starts small. Like when you got the option to buy repair kits and scrap kits. Then the scrapbot and fridge. Now fallout 1st.
---
And if you don't buy repair kits, and scrap kits? Or get the scrapbot and fridge?
---
It's a videogame, it's supposed to be fun. I have a feeling a lot of these posts are by players that enjoy going through games like this naked with a stick and beating them for the challenge. For you that's fun. And by all means, you go for it. 
---
The point of videogames is that they're supposed to be fun. I personally enjoy base building. Early on in the game, there was a glitch where if you moved your camp, it would double everything in the camp. I made a huge 3 story mega camp with this for awhile.
---
Why even stop at legendary effects then?  Why not swear that the next step after that is selling access to console commands so people start flying around and clipping through walls and using kill commands?  It's just as fucking stupid an idea.
---
QQ
---
You’re right. I’ve made peace with it. Bethesdas future isn’t my responsibility to worry about. The reason why people still play this game is due to its particular niche. Yes there are many open world games but there’s a specific itch that Bethesda games scratch for me. The way I see it is if Bethesda fail to give the people what they want someone else will and do it a lot better. So sure I’ll play some 76 every once in a while but I got no investment in them as a company anymore. As for making the community toxic? That’s Bethesdas fault, I’m sick of people blaming the community. If you got the energy to fuck shit up for Bethesda you have my blessing. As for me, I have a day job and I’ll exhibit the same relaxed position that Bethesda has with monetisation and big fixes.
---
Yea it’s worth it. I paid $60 and have over 600 hours in game. Good entertainment for my money Big you liked fallout 4, you should like this.
---
I like your idea and I am hoping for something similar to this. I would like a box where I can put free gifts to others in. I understand there might be difficulties with that because people would use it for stash, so perhaps make it deposit only for the owner. Then I could put all that stuff I don't wan't/ can't sell in a box for anyone who might stop by and want it.  Until then I guess I will continue leaving it in random containers. If you find a suitcase with 400lbs of random loot in it, your welcome :)
---
I had the perk off to help degrade the condition and after 50+ it was still close to what I crafted it, around 130%.
---
Need a lvl2 gunsmith to craft, mine is lvl 4 so the condition is higher when crafting.
---
People don't just criticize because they hate something, they criticize because they think it can and should be better.
---
Night time itself is a joke, it barely gets dark anywhere 😂
---
I dont think the junk storage is fair, even having purchased Fallout 1st. However the second camp can be used by anyone.. And you can place it in a blast zone np. Its all what you do with it..
---
"Hmm might still need that"
---
Every company in the world didn't sell a full priced broken product, with scandal and disaster every week, and then attempts to fleece those die hard players who have stuck with it through thick and thin. I have spent a lot on games, subscriptions, premium products and services, more than I would like to admit. I have been suckered into spending a lot on games, smart, yet predatory monetization schemes. But at some point you wise up, and draw a line, and Bethesda has crossed it. There's no getting through to some people, but thankfully more and more people are waking up to it, and not falling victim to it. Even governments are looking into the practices employed by game developers/publishers in their schemes to make more money. The less people buy the games, the more predatory the schemes have to become to make up those losses, and it's a viscous cycle for those who continue to support them as they look for more ways to get more and more money out of them. I'm just glad to get it over with. When a company reveal their true nature, I can cross them off the list of those I support. There are so many great developers, especially indie developers, and PS4 exclusive developers, and Nintendo Switch developers, who put their reputation, the quality of their games, and the fun, experience, enjoyment and satisfaction of the players first, always. And they make a lot of money without sleazy tactics. It's sad it has come to this. It's sad that this has befallen Bethesda.
---
Theres nothing to source. Its speculation because what else would happen to a game not making money?
---
I’m sorry you were griefed but the fault of the community becoming toxic rests solely with Bethesda, people can only put up with so much BS before they quit enjoying something
---
You don't have to check the sub if you don't like what is being discussed.
---
Because they lack the ability to see, or refuse to see the big picture and long term. Its a self centered mindset and fuck anyone else.
---
They pretty much got this in common with the game companies pulling this shit.
---
I'm enjoying the game :&gt;
---
* I didn't buy the christmas emotes
---
* I didn't buy the power armor edition
---
* I didn't pay $20 for any power armor paints.  
---
* I've never had any major bugs that people complain about impact me - never lost all my stuff, never died to invisible enemies, etc.  The only bugs I have encounted, were things that were fixed. 
---
On the other hand:
---
* They've added new game modes
---
* They've added new questline for a much requested backpack
---
* They've added player vending machines
---
* They've added new dungeons and a raids
---
* They've taken player feedback on things like event notifications and added it to the game, as well as changing the "slap" mechanics. 
---
* They've added the private servers, which from the get go we were told they would be charged for, and they work fine
---
* They've had some community weeks the past month that resulted in free stuff being given out and discounts at the legendary vendor
---
* they added the legendary vendor.
---
There has been plenty of good things that were added.
---
Then you wake up in goodsprings and the doctor’s head somehow flips over fully
---
Yeh I see what you’re saying 
---
I’ve seen channels make 4 or 5 videos just on this
---
Lol. There is no push for micro transactions. You can’t seriously think te game is frustrating unless you pay.
---
I enjoy it every time I sit down and play it, do I think aspects could be better, yes. But I have fun with what they’ve given me
---
Ooo yaaaaaay they added a BATTLE ROYALE MODE you must be so happy. 
---
No seriously get help
---
- So the company that re-released skyrim 100 times is broke? If the game apparently costs so much to develop due to all that amazing high quality content they put out (lol) then why don't they kill it? It makes no sense to keep developing something that isn't profitable especially when it already has a bad image. 
---
- I'll happily see the game taken down if it stops subs from being normalized in video games. 
---
- How would not saying anything bad about this stop it from ruining and affecting other games? 
---
- All Zenimax care about is how much people are paying whether that's 10 people who pay $1 or 1 person who pays $10.
---
So you're the reason a 3 star bloodied meat hook costs 50k :&lt;
---
I just want half decent skins for guns that don't suck
---
I don't think people understand how much data is at their fingertips. How many players play daily. What is the average length of time between plays? What is the average over the last week of people who have not played since the announcement? How many uninstalls? All of this is available at the run of a SQL script (or possibly with a 24 hour delay if they do extracts, which I imagine).
---
So what's the whole entire most functioning part of the game atom shop doing?
---
you need to claim it in the atom shop first
---
No you can be on a reddit if your part of the community, interested in the community or even if you dislike the community but you shouldn’t tell people what they should or shouldn’t be doing and then call them stupid for liking said thing. 
---
I’m not a fan of furies but I don’t go on there reddit and tell them to stop doing something they enjoy. Just let people enjoy what they like.
---
Bethesda doesnt deserve its community. Bless y’all
---
Because it's a popular suggestion, Bethesda will add it to the atomic shop or Fallout 1st, with no other way to obtain it.
---
Then repair it! It does not need to go down all the way.
---
Yes I love all my Bethesda products with lube
---
People just believe what they believe, don't they? It's time to unsub from this hellhole.
---
I had exactly the same experience :)
---
Source? This subreddit is my source if that's what you mean, it's evident that half of the people complaining are  jumping on the bandwagon karma farming, I've questioned a few on new because they clearly didn't have a clue and the post gets deleted minutes later, unfortunately it's the state of Reddit, people care more about meaningless points than anything else
---
Of course we do. This is the internet.
---
So...I should just embrace paying more for inferior products because...other people are stupid enough to do that?
---
You need the gunsmith to craft it, but if you don't have weapons artisan it won't get the double health.  Then unequip gunsmith to get rid of the reduced damage.
---
And, as others have said, use it for bashing -- wears it out faster.
---
(All this comes from bitter experience, on my 2nd character I forgot to play with my cards before making it and the damned thing was nearly indestructible).
---
That's what I'm talking about the game is good sure it could be better just like everything in life but why not be happy with what we have, we got an online fallout, NPCs are just few steps away private servers cool I don't care for them because I od t play online game to have a private servers so why should I say it's shit.
---
Well for one you’d be hard pressed to find someone who’s not a furry who will support their degeneracy. 
---
And two, there’s just that there’s nothing to like in the game, unless you love a good dumpster fire
---
How do you know 76 isn't making money? Why would they keep it running if its not making money?
---
I'm happy to see someone who enjoys it too :)
---
It wasn't heavily talked about.  Everyone was happy about private servers and mods but ignored the fact they said it was going to be hosted by them and a rental price (and it also seems some people ignored that the servers were going to be hosted by them, I mean they have cosmetics for sale.  How would that even work if people could take the game offline and add their own mods)
---
You could be saving 71 cents a month by just moving to the US!
---
Thanks for the detailed response! I'll take a look at the guide when I'm home. :-)
---
No one to question your values. Everyone has their own. Maybe games are more important to others. Sorry if I got you offended.
---
Not gonna happen, there’s a difference between pay for convenience and pay to win. Stop scare mongering.
---
Thank you for this post 
---
:) Sometimes I play with my daughter - she’s 6.
---
She loves to build my bases.  They are all “Pink-and-Pretty”.  She also splurges all the atoms I earn in game on absolutely necessary camp items.  Other than camp building, we explore the WhiteSprings hotel and Bunker (as safe locations). 
---
It’s fun for us.  Obviously, not doing other FI76 content together for a long while.
---
PS. Would be grateful for suggestions of locations to explore.
---
This story sounds like an r/thathappened story overall.
---
I got downvoted for calling it out. It's somewhere in the comments here.
---
I share your skepticism, you share mine; let's be skeptic brothers.
---
And my original point is proven positive. 
---
You never really cared about any opinion, and you don't really even know the history of the game.  You just came here to troll
---
I'm more then enjoying it, im quite addicted actually lol
---
Yes but the hate gets out of control. How can the game get more players when all what the people who consider getting the game see is all this hate ? They immediately stop thinking about getting it..
---
I see. Hopefully the guide linked above helps. I go on the game irregularly so aside from my gf it's difficult to find a raid partner. Luckily we're well equipped so hopefully it works out
---
Not offended I just don't ever understand the point of comments like that since everyones different and different things are important to everyone.
---
r/hailcorporate
---
No you need to reread what you said and consider the gravity of it. ‘Oh well what they did doesn’t matter because I didn’t pay for it’. They’re still cockslapping you over and over again to milk you for your money
---
Yo, I got hella toys IRL and I’m not spending another red cent on this shit. Dudes out of his mind.
---
I appreciate the response. Hope we can get the hang of it quick :-)
---
Well, it just proves the theory that any publicity is good publicity as long as they spell your name right... or as long as it's recognizable to belong to you. Can confirm this with my youtube channel. Had a big stonks moment because people downvotebombarded my channel.
---
That's good to know. Thanks for the response :-)
---
No... but this whole scorched earth policy and belittling people who do support the game and don’t see it as an end of the world scenario and griefing them, come on man. That’s just pathetic.
---
Dude, you can walk into gamestop and get the goty editions of either of those, with literally every single dlc, for under 10 each. Hell goty fallout 4 is retailing near me at around $25
---
Oh you speak for everyone? You're entitled to everyone elses voice I guess?
---
https://www.statista.com/statistics/325144/reddit-global-active-user-distribution/
---
Having a human interaction is no laughing matter. We shouldn't be skeptical brother. That's not the Ninja way.
---
To be fair though, the sub isn’t titled “Fallout 76 Negativity”. I think OP wants just what I want: to clear the feed of all of the circle jerk complaints and boycott posts and find the actual content hardy posts.
---
There was a time (I think around March maybe?) where hey had just almost fully patched out duping, explosive damage infinite health thing, and had a huge server stability boost. The only issues at the time were a few sound bugs and camp item placement problems.
---
Due to this, the sub was about 95% positive posts, so you actually got to see people sharing their characters, items, camps, memories etc.
---
That is what we want to see, and I don’t think anyone wants to scroll through 99% of posts being complaints about the game.
---
Just play the damn game and have fun.
---
Or don’t, but don’t spend all day complaining about it lmao
---
So a game that is a technical mess is better than a game that runs perfectly, is graphically superior and so forth?
---
I agree. I find this game really fun, and it seems that all people do is complain. So what the fridge is 7 dollars,or that repair and scrap kits exist? Your experience won't be ruined by these things. If you don't like the game don't play it, you don't have to complain non-stop about it.
---
Digital stores also take 30% of digital sales.
---
Is that the best you can come up with mr. Troll.
---
&gt;they're COMPANIES and exist to make money.
---
Therefore shady business tactics are totally cool in your eyes? If they create an inconvenience and sell you the cure for it that's fucking stupid and low. Are you blind or do you just like being taken advantage of? They're not just selling us little outfits and stuffed animals for camps they're creating problems and selling the solutions.
---
But then again if you're someone who is totally down be boned in this manner I'd have better luck explaining this to my dog.
---
No i feel my actions will keep Fallout 76 going which is what I want. I love playing 76 and I want more. At the moment that's the Fallout I care about. We'll get more someday, but not any time soon.  And all other Fallout games are played and done, this one though is not. And for me personally I'm still really enjoying it and finding new things everyday. So i want to support it, I want more content, and while some may feel FO 1st isn't a value, to me the current items on top of the monthly Atoms is not a bad deal. Plus on top of it all Appalachia is now all mine, something I've desperately wanted from the start. So you can keep going on about destroying this or that, but for me its something I want to do, I can do, and makes my game 100% better. 
---
And seriously people pay 12 bucks for coffee in 2 or 3 days, so yelling at me for buying a subscription that makes my game better is fucking silly.
---
Why?
---
The sub isn't called "Fallout 76: Sucking Todd Edition" either.
---
Here's a fun idea. If you don't like something, don't fucking buy it. Don't tell other people they shouldn't buy something because YOU don't like it, or because YOU don't approve of a company's business model. Literally half the reason I subbed was because of all the assholes on here saying that I shouldn't. 
---
The other half was the 1600 atoms.
---
My camp is located near Charleston Station, so a lot of new players come by. Everything I sell is dirt cheap, 5 caps for receipes, 10-15 for plans, lots of free ammo aswell, 150-200 caps for legendaries etc. I love when new players come by and get stuff, I can free some room in my stash. 
---
I kinda hate when high levels come and take everything and they resell it for profit, but oh, well... 
---
So yeah, I'd love to have the option.
---
Funny ... and true
---
Even my ammo sales have gone down
---
Bethesda bot Bethesda bot
---
P2W? Lol.
---
Win what? There is no competition. I do not compete with anyone for anything on this game.
---
All i see are a bunch of self entitled, whiny, freeloading, overreacting, misinformed sheep crying because nothing is free.
---
Well yes, but actually no.
---
Wow you're either really confused or... nope.. you're really confused.  I mean you're fundamentally right I \*think\* but I think my 5 yo would do a better job of explaining it, and he's a labrador. :)
---
Crashes just like everyone’s to huh
---
I read it, and I agree with u/DumSkidderik \- I bought the sub SPECIFICALLY because I want to have a option where I'm not being chased around by random teenagers who think it's amazing fun to gank me with their OP shotgun that they duped a year ago.  Some of us are "carebears" who want nothing more than to be left alone, and if we've got to pay $13 for the privilege of being able to game in peace, then it's well worth it.
---
I hate this community and it's self-righteous entitled bullshit more than any other group of gamers other than the Eve Online ganksquads who think their antics are justified because "it's all a game".  Don't go telling me how to spend MY money and whether or not the publisher should be allowed to charge for something that a not insignificant portion of the playerbase has asked for since day 1.  Should FO1st be free?  Absolutely not.  Should it be 13$?  Probably not, but that's the price they've chosen, and people (like myself) are happily paying it, for whatever personal reason that they've chosen to do so.
---
If you want to protest the creation of paid DLC and RTX for games, then write to your congressman and picket the publishers, but don't go trying to guilt-trip the gamers who actually like and appreciate the DLC that's got you so riled up.  All we're going to do is buy the DLC that we've asked for and make sure to try and avoid your ranting in the future - we're certainly not going to change our minds about the DLC.  The gaming industry is NOT going to change just because you've gotten your panties in a twist on Reddit - if you want to change it, then talk to people who can ACTUALLY change it, instead of preaching in your echo chamber here.
---
Just like you read the same shit everyday about how it's "bad". There are just as many that are "enjoying" the game. Maybe you're just sifting through the wrong threads. Read the titles and click on the ones you "agree" with, you'll have the same think in those post that you want.
---
Reality though; Right now BGS really fucked up, even if you don't think so. So, I mean. Give it time, stop complaining about complaining and just enjoy your flipping game ... reddit is not the game.
---
Well, if you’ve ever seen a dumpster fire they are quite entertaining. But I enjoy collecting power Armor and building camps. I have almost 100 suits of power Armor and I build a new camp every month so I’m finding lots to do in this game. I also find Nuclear Winter a blast and play 2 or 3 games a day.
---
I don't hate the game, I hate the poor monetization decisions, false advertising, and bugs that have plagued the game since forever.
---
Well that's sad but that's the fault of Bethesda/zos. 76 could of got more players by releasing in a better state, fixing the bugs and adding new content. All as promised by bethesda at launch. They failed at all three in my view. The game had a bad launch and isn't in much of a better state now, plus the new content has been far too thin to try and treat this game like an mmo with a sub. Its not our job to keep bad developers afloat. If they make worthy games the players will keep them going. If they half arse it we end up where we are now.
---
I don't hate the game, but I can't deny there's a lot wrong with it and there is no upside to 1st. It's bad all the way down, and some more consequences if how they choose to implement it will show themselves when modding comes.
---
I don’t think anything really implies that to be honest.
---
If everyone had the option to get 1st for free, I don’t think there is a soul who wouldn’t. But just because people buy it, or don’t buy it but play anyways doesn’t mean they are bad people.
---
They just want to play their game and have fun. Some find the $$$ is worth it, and some don’t, and both of those are okay because it is their money and their decision.
---
Do you find paying for 16 dollar power armor skins fun
---
Haven't experienced this at all. Even get the thumbs up for planting my tent for other players to use.
---
This sub is just a tiny sad and very salty community.
---
Wow. Nice to see some good posts again. What a moment u experienced wish I had a story that compared Haha.
---
People like you are the problem with this sub, an entitled cunt, did he say he was speaking for everyone? I took from context he was sharing his own opinion, do you know how to English? 
---
Not to mention the fact that the majority of people are complaining about an additional service, absolutely nothing to do with the money they paid for the stock game
---
Agree to disagree, brother ✌😎
---
Wait a sec. You can use the tent on public servers?
---
although the game could improve performance on ps4, im enjoying the unlimited scrap and workshops
---
Do you know what a Ponzi scheme is? Because I'm pretty sure you don't
---
Or, none of that could be monetized and Bethesda could just make and sell a working video game without all the nickle and dime-ing.
---
Don't encourage them.
---
I'll only support it if you can mail literally anything, 
---
^(shut up im not planning to send fertilizer to people)
---
Maybe yours.
---
It was one DLC that included all of the armour sets. By today’s low standards it was decent-ish value - although I am absolutely turned off by the pricing of almost all of the Creation Club content these days, and they don’t cost much more.
---
Also, I agree with you on most points of the post. The Fallout 1st model has given me the mother of all eye-rolls and it’s just sad, silly and downright baffling that they thought this would go any other way.
---
I mean Western minds also includes the EU. 
---
"The Western world, also known as the West, refers to various regions, nations and states, depending on the context, most often including at least parts of Europe, Australasia, and the Americas"
---
So is there a minority of Easterners not getting their word in? O.O
---
Brand new account, first post. Guess Bethesda is sending people for some damage control :)
---
Yea its called PR, people around here might wanna take a lesson or two.
---
if you have most wanted items in the game in your stash box dont wait  go on ebay.... If people are ready to pay for game changing stuff ... $$$$$$$$$ Welcome in online gaming :)
---
r/facepalm
---
There kind of is.
---
I used to sell flux, which is extremely hard to acquire because of the high competition killing monsters in nuke zones. Premiums have already flooded the economy with hundred of stable flux at a quarter of the price, basically acquiring an advantage by paying money.
---
And this is just one example. Another us that people used to barter in 556 ammo. Premiums now have free ammo at their uncontested workshop. They'll be able to buy everything off online markets, basically acquiring an advantage by paying money.
---
And I could go on.
---
God forbid!
---
We work out Teddy Bear butts off for those atoms. We don't pay cash.
---
Now you know why they delayed it.
---
CRITICAL HIT
---
The game itself isn’t awful, I had my fun playing it, I really just hate Bethesda in this situation
---
I find doing the daily challenges and unlocking atoms for free fun and I don’t mind buying some atoms from time to time (now that we have the subscription I don’t have too). I have over 900 hours in the game, I’ve spent $80 total on atoms +$60 for the game so it only costs me about 15c an hour. Pretty good value for money if you ask me.
---
Oh shit man, thanks for the reminder. I forgot about that theory. It's not even absurd, it's plausible and I'm certain it's happening right now. Might be a lurker, hacked account, basically anything, so it's possible.
---
I was the same when I first started seeing level 200 odds and avoiding them like the plague as I was concerned they'd kill me and take my stuff 
---
I was doing a quest when a high level approached me and gave me all sorts of aid, a decent weapon and ammo and other stuff
---
Another high level gave me a full set of level 50 armour all legendary when I was level 30 and so on
---
That's what made me love the game so much including the community
---
Big of wall of text to try justifying selling a private version of a game that barely fucking works.
---
Your opinion, no matter what, on any subject, is void.
---
Private servers free is extremely unlikely, and we've always known that the servers would be behind some kind of subscription.
---
But there are ways to fix Fallout 1st. Some involve going back in time and acting differently, others are more doable but won't restore the trust levels this sub had last week in a long time.
---
I think looking into reverse engineering the game server would be an interesting hobby type endeavour.
---
You could just drop it in a bag by a sign that says free.
---
The only thing I hate is how people abuse the word "hate" these days.
---
Just because someone is critical of something doesn't mean they're *hating* it. Everyone is so quick to call each other a hater these days.
---
No, because then they'd have to scrap the subscription. I don't see them ever doing that, because if they did, anyone who subscribed would be wanting their money back, and that is the last thing Bethesda will do as a company. They'd rather burn themselves to the ground than give someone their money back.
---
Bethesda, as in their management, care for the game for completely different reasons than we do, which changes their motives, incentives, goals etc., which is why you need to be careful about putting us on the same side with the developers. And that's not a tin foil hat conspiracy theory, it's basically well known fact for everyone who knows the basics of economics. 
---
You also need to be careful with your "envy-argumentation", that people are basically cheapskates and just don't want to pay for things, because that's partially a strawman argument. It's not about wanting something or not, I mean, of course everyone would want an unlimited stash, a private server, a tent and so on. Why would you not? But just because people complain about those things doesn't mean they would shut up if Todd Howard would grant them a ten years subscription for free. Only very few complain from an "I want that thing but can't/don't want to pay"-point of view. It's about questions like should this be put behind a paywall, what implications do such things have on the industry as a whole, etc., it's all in a much much bigger context than the gain for your personal account. And history has shown that the players as customer DO hold power and they can stop or punish questionable business decisions from companies. All it needs for the players is to be united enough to send a clear message. And I think you heavily underestimate the motives of people. Considering your attitude and your post here I think you are just a person who doesn't believe a lot into others and prefers to trust only himself, most likely due to past experiences in life. And it's not a bad philosophy per se, it's basically the "better safe than sorry" approach and that's not wrong. But I can tell you there are many people out there with a much more "we"-focused attitude, who know that if you can guess the motives and goals of others properly you can have very reliable allies.
---
This is me speaking in a very general way, addressing general statements more than this particular issue at hand. I do believe if someone rents a private server he should pay for it, because that's how it goes. What I find problematic is the context, the timing etc. of that decision. But all in all I am not too worked up over Fallout 1st.
---
It does matter - I voted with my wallet where it mattered.  
---
I'd have to be dumping money into this game for them to be milking me for it.
---
What can you possibily do to me?
---
Of course you are. Most of the people left the game already. The ones that are still playing are put in the same servers. The question is, how many servers are running, compared to last week or last month.
---
While f76 has technical issues I would not consider it to be "a mess". And it's a one of a kind game, so I'm not sure you can compare it to other games and decide what's better. I mean, I understand people having different views. What I don't get is why something must necessarily be black or white. Bethesda has done many bad moves since the game launched but I think there's still room for saving the product.
---
Dude that was the dumbest shit ever. You had tons of guns being advertised and being put up to be bought with real money and all Bethesda could come up with was to take the bandaid solution and just destroy a gun that was so rare to obtain. I didn’t even get one, I had a regular explosive pump shotty that was deadly. I don’t even think I saw what became of it, by that early stage I was already done with the game.
---
No, because they said before the game was released that private servers were going to have a fee.
---
Because it’s childish, rude and not effective. Plus for the “uninstallers” your going to be missing out on all kinds of games. Sure maybe there’s a game or two that are decent left, but this is coming. Your not going to change monetization. If these companies don’t continue to grow their profits they stop making games.
---
Yeah but 6 euro is like 6,6 Dollar
---
At this point I'm pretty sure people just hate the game because it's cool to hate on fallout 76.
---
And the number of people going out of their way to give people shit for getting a sub is ridiculous. 
---
"I don't like this so people need to stop buying it"
---
Go bitch at EA. At least we don't have fucking lootboxes.
---
It is in stash box tab in build menu but you have to unlock it in the atomic shop first. Look in the camp section i think. Maybe the 1st tab .
---
i severely doubt it will happen unless they take a bunch of people not experienced with multiplayer games, on engine that was pretty much rebuilt for multiplayer support, and write new coding to do peer to peer servers.
---
You got proof "most" quit or you just bandwagon Ing?
---
You made a decision not to buy but still play, silently showing support for the decision to allow them to continue
---
No!
---
And thank everything holy that it isn’t in anyway shape or form associated with such awful terrible villainy of FO76
---
Praise be to TOW!
---
Yup, selling food is top notch. Scorchbeast Queen fight and Uranium Fever are meat bonanza.
---
I'm pretty sure it's happening since the sub exists. There are several accounts that ONLY post in this sub hyping the game or posting these kind of aww-stories.
---
I think it's kinda suspicious if you are on reddit with thousands of subs for every kind of interest but you choose exclusivly to post in fo76.
---
i am a bit curious - would you be ok with them selling 4 star legenadry items for atom and/or real money ?  It is a serious question - i mean if you dont compete with anyone , does it matter if people can buy much better gear than you ?
---
I luv this game. If you don't like it walk away and just shut up.
---
&gt; I haven't paid for the game, no. I would never do such a thing. 
---
k
---
I know, it was such a shit show at that point I just couldn’t continue playing. I felt like I got cheated and I got punished for it lmao
---
It's as close as a fallout game can get
---
I'm seeing more vitriol for a subscription service than I usually see aimed at EA about their lootboxes (except that one time they fucked up star wars), so I'm not sure if your moral outrage is really aimed properly.
---
Isn't that more of an incentive to not get the subscription?
---
*"Haha, I waste my money on stupid and unnecessary things. Let me laugh at you with my bad spending habits"*
---
FO76 sold like 4+ million 
---
This sub has 200,000 subscribers
---
So yeah, most people who play this dont post on eddit.
---
Everyone of my friends left long ago. Many people I talked to are not going to play until Wastelanders. So yeah, I got proof but I don’t need it anyway. It is common sense.
---
I think there’s a slim possibility that private servers could become free but you have to pay for persistent servers and modded servers. I don’t see it happening any time in the immediate future though.
---
Maybe because most the people in the sub played the game at one point and has now stopped due to either frustration or through disappointment, and the only people playing the game are people who are willing to pay more money for something broken and not completely thought out
---
People complained that it was too dark :/
---
I’m hoping for mail boxes that will allow for sending items/caps to other characters/players...and hopefully the addition of a protectron letter carrier who just roams the map.
---
The way I look at it is people who use 3rd party market sites have an unfair advantage to the people that don't.
---
One could say "well why don't they join the trading sites and participate?"
---
 Some people choose not to or can't use a 3rd party site for trading. That gives an unfair advantage to those who can and do.
---
Ok? And 9€ is $10. What is your point? Annual subscription is $8.33/mo USD which is less than a whopper meal.
---
You mean 1 year from now.. when wastelanders update actually releases.
---
Sold 4 million to retailers maybe
---
Not really, no. It sometimes gets better with an update, then gets worse with the one after that. As far as I can tell there has been little coordinated effort on Bethesda's part to improve performance.
---
I created a subreddit for them r/AntiFO76 so they have a space to scream into the void how much they hate this game. 
---
Me? I like it. I have fun playing. Sure, it can be better, anything can be better, but it's a good game.
---
Because Bethesda has created an environment, free from the "loyal FO76 community" the ones who cheated, duplicated countless items and then sold their duplicated armor and weapons for 10 times the game's cap thresholds (per item), who are now complaining that they no longer enjoy their advantage over everyone else..
---
I love the game and I’m a Fallout 1st member and proud. I’m happy to support a game that’s given me 900 hours of entertainment and amazing adventures with old friends and new friends I’ve met along the way.
---
*yawn*
---
It's done on purpose by Bethesda to make more money. Has nothing to do with them *needing* money to do it. Come on. Don't be so naive.
---
🤣🤣🤣
---
Should I remind you, that they though about turning this game to F2P? Can you imagine, what advantages would have paying players against the rest? Game has financial issues for quite a some time. Bethesda is not so stupid to bring this if game was profitable and all financial matters were going smoothly. At least at this moment, when similar well praised game is released and wasterlanders are delayed. 
---
I wanted to point out, that there could be another reason for this than make you cashcow or "ruin your beloved game".
---
I don't I'm a bit disappointed that Bethesda did this though I still stand by the fact they should've made Scrap Box and the tent free for all or even an atomic shop purchase that's permanent rather than a subscription that disables the usage if you don't renew
---
What got me more was tbe toxicity this community got towards other players that have bought Fallout 1st it's really disappointing as I loved the game for the community and the game itself hell me and PKOA members had a Halloween Event yesterday and we was talking about it everyone likes it but could've been done better 
---
We did bump in a couple players that shot at us and shook his head (looking left to right) and basically followed us we ignored them and carried on our way
---
What a bold, hot take 🙄
---
My arguement is GTAV is not technically pay 2 win... and if you consider that pay 2 win then the repair kits, collector bot etc is pay 2 win Capisce?
---
The fact is outside the very minor MTX's differences (F76 having more pay2win) both games are very similar in setup was my other point both games use instanced based servers both have a private mode both have pvp modes both do not charge for DLC content the difference being F76 charges for private mode and GTAV doesn't.... Capisce?
---
No, they hate on the game because it’s being slowly ruined, piece-by-piece. Fallout 1st is an insult to the player base. Get over it.
---
So that's [why](https://imgur.com/qAyJqZX).
---
Not like "your friends" represent a good sample for the whole player base anyway. I could say that "my friends" are actually still there.
---
I can’t think of one game on console that I can play the way I play 76 :) for me it’s the Sims other than not having to do some silly job haha. Instead it’s Appalachia and trapping people. I’ve had a great time :)
---
This game sucks so much goddamn dick
---
Yes, they are fine.  Just drop a piece of ammo before you log out.  Don't dashboard to quickly switch characters.
---
Right, people should really sub to r/AntiFO76 if they want to discuss the EPICLY WORLD ENDING, UNIVERSE DESTROYING, PROOF THAT GOD IS A LIE, DISASTER, THAT IS EVERYTHING Bethesda!
---
So you’d rather people be silent about the Fallout 1st situation? And let Bethesda go even further with their monetisation? Sure.
---
...and here I am waiting for a stash and CAMP budget increase.
---
Who cares what people do with their money good lord
---
I know right, how dare people have standards. People need to just take what BGS gives them and like it.
---
Making new content costs money to make, they can’t keep supporting this game for years to come if no income comes in. That’s like saying I bought a ticket to see Infinity War then I should get a free ticket to End Game.
---
&gt; the only people playing the game are people who are willing to pay more money 
---
What a very generic, uninspired argument.
---
Hope  you never meet such bugs then, depending the platforms the game can get really unpredictable, in my case i feel unsafe to use either a stimpack or a rad away coz it has a small chance to cause a game crash, everyone i played with had it at one point, I honestly doubt it's only material related, if it's the case the majority of players have faulty machines ( When it comes to play this specific game )
---
*Shill* ☝
---
OP deleted their comment, now I'm sad  😔
---
You'll never be able to tell people how to spend their money.
---
Its theirs to do with as they like.
---
I dont like it but it's not for me to dictate.
---
I'm reall sad for you, i play like you, i bought Fallout 1st for one month for atoms and fluff, and to try private servers, actually have to find problems like yours but, like others said, griefers are everywhere :)
---
It's a shame i can't use mic for lot of reasons) so i can't group and communicate with people like you, i love to set up helping camp open for all while exploring appalchia :)
---
Why would they - fallout 1st seems to be huge succes to me  - those tents and scrapboxes are everywere
---
i love the game,idc about the paid service at all,it doesnt affect the game,every company need to make money if they dont make money anymore then there's no game industrie no more.......
---
Hard no.
---
&gt;Facebook 
---
Does anybody even use Facebook anymore?
---
You can still earn atoms in game I assume?
---
I was literally going to buy the game and then they fucking did that. I’m for sure not doing it now.
---
oh you mean like this one? https://old.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/dnlhec/launched_my_first_nuke_today/
---
just look at those brand new accounts commenting.
---
So lets agree to disagree.
---
wtf? Whoever Bethesda get to do their regional pricing needs to be replaced.
---
Shameless self promotion of a sub I created for people that hate 76. I like this game, but people should have a place to go if they don't.

If Fallout was good they would Also a Lot of players
---
‘Learn to do the same’
---
Sure, let’s all stop criticising Bethesda for over-monetising this game and just let them go even further until it dies. Great.
---
Why did you join this sub then?
---
yeah but the problem is only the sun comes up for free.....
---
Hahaha, no. Why would they do that when private servers can be put behind paid walls? If it happens though, maybe as a reaction to the backlash then yay, otherwise I doubt it will happen.
---
Nighttime should be darker too.
---
is there a point to this comment?
---
How very appropriate!
---
Anything related to this thread of a cesspool dump fire, pig ignorant self pity is by default, immediately shit in content and context.
---
And there’s just so much!  Hope this toilet can handle it!
---
because you must be very good at Siving through piles and piles and piles of mounds of faecal matter to find nuggets of sustenance because you actually spend time playing FO76.  You must do to defend it with such brown lips and nose.
---
I never sold scrap from my vendor, or bought it either. I only ever go looking for plans at a cheaper price than the NPC vendors, legendary weapons and armor, and some aid items like Serums. 
---
Scrap is plentiful enough I never saw a need to buy it from players. I just go farm the particular things I needed.
---
I have had nothing but a massive growth of sales. I cant keep any material in stock, it always gets bought out. Unlimited storage has opened up an entire market for people willing to grind mats. 
---
But it definitely has changed stuff. Ammo is now meh. Lead is king, adhesive, steel, and aluminum sell well. Stable flux sells at serum prices. Meds seem unaffected. 
---
It is probably a bubble that will pop, but for now, sales have increased dramatically.
---
GTA:Online is a bit of a weird example though. 1.25 million is 20$ CAN and every DLC release content that require around 8 million. A fully upgraded new cars can rank up to 10 millions.
---
And making money, on console at least, is a very long tedious and slow process. Heist, for example, can make you at most around 250k in one hour if you’re good and efficient, but that will push you through loading screens after loading screens after loading screens.
---
You can also try to deliver your cargos with the nightclub or the bunker but that’s if you’re ready to face players on their flying broomstick who can throw to waste your work in a few bombs, prompting you to deliver in glitched solo lobbies just to be safe.
---
GTA:O is extremely pay to win and designed to make the players feel disadvantaged unless *they pay more* and made the process of gaining money a slow repetitive task to encourage them to buy shark cards instead. :-/
---
dude...have you not realized yet that these people are literal paid Bethesda shills?
---
No matter what is said they’re just gonna go full damage control mode because they’re actually just the people who are doing this in the first place
---
He's actually right about numbers, he simply forgot to tell he's speaking in base-10 logarithmic scale.
---
Thanks Todd.
---
oof true, I'd love to see enemies that are actually challenging
---
I'd love to take a look around your house and point out any pointless shit you've spent your money on. Just because someone splurges on a hobby doesn't mean they deserve to get fucked over.
---
Who’s arguing with you?
---
It is expensive, this post is a scam.
---
Im insinuating that you have an ulterior motive.
---
Amen, some of the people on this subreddit need help.
---
I used to crash all the time at launch but have found things more and more stable with each patch to the point where things run as smoothly as any other online game. Are you on PC?
---
Has been posted many times, but still an excellent idea, maybe one day... maybe one day.
---
*LIES*
---
Who's said anything about new content? I thought the discussion was about the advantages introduced with Fallout First.
---
There's a level 3 safe in Ash Heap in the abandoned cafe where Murgle the cat spawns.  Kind of on the right in a pile of scrap and junk when you walk in from the Welch direction.  NOT the safe in the cafe itself--before you get that far.
---
Oh so I was right.. you are one of those types.
---
10 paragraphs of word diaherrea on how wise and mature you are while berating others and belittling their opinions.
---
Then when it's pointed how hypocrital you are being - it's all "that was sarcastism... lulz" while using circa 2014 terms like "triggered" and "Do you need a safe space?" unironically. 
---
But it's ok though - I'm no saint and have done the same thing myself in the past. However, seeing now how ridiculous it is, I am going to make an effort to check myself in future. 
---
In a weird roundabout way I guess I should thank you for the lesson (and the movie recommendation - never heard of it before).
---
Sounds like you're describing an advantage. They introduced a problem (such as junk weights, and needing junk) upon the release of the game to later sell you the solution.
---
I guess some people just don't get the memo that only Hate on the game is allowed in these parts...
---
Dunno, e.g. Japan has  ミルクカフェ (milkcafe.net) : Milk Cafe and I imagine many more, as does many other countries to voice their opinions to the masses.
---
Wow, 3 days to come up with that response 👍 Best part is I didn't even read it, probably nothing of significance contained within
---
id bet its a mix of the situation and a random memory you have that got triggered. i love these moments!
---
Going through someone's history is creepy.  Stalk someone else...
---
No this sub isn't. This sub is notorious for dick riding this mess of a game like no other. It's only one Bethesda makes a BIG fuck up. That the sub all comes together for about a month then it's back to shilling the game.
---
No but a person who doesn't even play the game and somehow is on this post asked
---
Ensuring bethesda/zos are a profitable company isn't my responsibility. They had a business model which they announced publicly: free dlc, free updates, only cosmetics in MTX. I can only assume the rocky ride (bugs, lackluster additional content etc etc) has prompted them to ask people to pay subs for the exact same content they sold them a year ago. Had the game been better made, better supported and had received better content the player base would be healthier and more willing to support via MTX as was originally intended. None of this is the players or communities fault or responsibility. The state of the game is down to bethesda/zos alone.
---
This comparison is ridiculous.
---
You don't pay real money to barter with people online, so it's not a paid advantage. Placing a restriction on yourself is not the same thing as having one imposed by a price tag.
---
Um why do you want to block First users?
---
A list of things that should be sold in the Atomic Shop:
---
1. Cosmetics.
---
And here's a list of things that shouldn't be sold in the shop:
---
1. Anything else.
---
You realise this is discrimination and honestly petty in my opinion. Why give a shit if they want to spend money on a game they enjoy? If you disagree then don't buy it but don't give the people who have bought it shit. I haven't bought it if you're wondering.
---
*Hate* is such an overused term nowadays it is almost becoming as pointless and *rasict* or *bigot* etc...
---
Would it bother me? Sure.
---
Would it affect my gameplay? Absolutely not.
---
 I Didn't buy the membership to win against anybody.
---
1600 atoms / cool outfit / unlimited component stash / second camp (free FT) / private world to use anytime i want / I only had to spend 14$.
---
 I also got to helpout a game that I love. 
---
 I'm not sorry I bought it and I will probly buy the next few months as well.
---
&gt; It takes me all of 10 minutes a month to earn the money I was already spending in Atoms. 
---
That's a little braggy. It takes some people an hour to make that, others 2 hours to make that. 
---
It's just a LITTLE braggy saying that in basically a snap of a finger you have enough money to afford *anything*.
---
While you ask me if i am on PC ( Yes i do ) could i know on wich you are ? ;D we can't really argue about each other's stability if we don't share the same platform
---
I would do the same thing
---
No First Users ✊
---
Which part?
---
Sounds like my daughter, except she is 3. She loves to help help me with my camp, or to spend the atoms I got from Weeklys/Dailys.
---
She could care less about any other aspect of the game really, once the combat starts she is gone, lost interest. Lol.
---
Bethesda's engine ha always had the worst lighting for whatever reason. Thats why lighting mods for skyrim and fallout 4 were always close to the most downloaded mods
---
I don't know.  I was going to sub for a month just to play solo, but I've already done pretty much all there is to do in the game, so no real point to a private server for that.  Don't care about the other stuff.
---
I'd have thought BGS would just let us have an offline mode at no cost to anyone - that's the money grubbing part I guess.
---
I’m not scare mongering. I don’t see how this wouldn’t be a legit concern or thought. Fallout 1st isn’t pay for convenience it’s absolutely pay to win. Empty your stash so you can farm legendaries solo and have 50 plus weapons and armor in your vendor tell me that’s not pay to win. It is. So where does it stop? Take your naive goggles off and look at all the options because they’re clear as day when you analyze it. I think it’s good to have the conversation about potential moves. Perhaps it prevents it before it happens the same way the perk cards were set to be monetized but changed at the last minute. It’s time to play prevent defense
---
How would the mod even be able to detect it?
---
Just sell it huh? How was it that I didn't think of it beforehand? Oh right, it's because I bought the tricentenial edition day 1 on pc, with their shitty refund policy, had to endure all of the crap from the first days and ultimately gave up on it.
---
I can't sell, only along with everything else in my account, so I'm still searching for my money-worth of value I guess.
---
Oh, and this game fucking sucks, I remember the very last time I've connected, I spend 5 hours managing my fucking stash with the limited ammo drops so I had to craft them, the shitty mechanic of item and food degradation that I had to look for scrap to fix etc. I did maybe 1 quest or public event it that session, realized that I don't want to play this shit anymore, seeing how they basically sell the time skips for these mechanics they themselves created in the real money store was the last drop for me.
---
I see it as either pay us tons more money to be on a privileged level where you can enjoy this still broken mess that we refuse to fix or spend countless hours collectig enough fucking springs to fix the left leg of your power armor to loot the next bomb site.
---
First users make me feel bad about this game and the P2W parts, so I want to block them from my game 
---
Block them from my camp, block them from by view, just block them and. Pretend they don't exist 
---
They have private servers, this is my version of a private server for all non first users
---
The game will die because it is a buggy mess. The devs keep introducing new and old bugs with every patch. The only meaningful content is delayed, just so they can introduce pay 2 win. So what are we supposed to do? Keep hoping?
---
To the happy next generation of Fallout fans )
---
Never. The issue is only when the game is running, and only for 76. All other games are smooth.
---
Had someone following me around hitting me yesterday, I ignored them and just carried on doing my thing, they left the server.
---
If you're not willing to wait to see how the game fares, and throw THAT much money into it, you deserve to have your eyes opened every now and again.
---
Oh, and all the shit around my house that cost more than $50 are all highly functional, speakers, TV's, radio setups, etc. None of that is going to be thrown out the window because the company shut down their servers
---
I would however let the owner set restrictions on who can put stuff in. I don't need someone stuffing burnt magazines, fertilizer, a gas canister, and a Molotov into my mailbox.
---
Canny caverns, glassed caverns, crashed space station, anywhere in the toxic valley is cool. There is one mountain range at the far north west of the toxic valley which looks beautiful bevause you can look at half of Appalachia from their.
---
Those companies make Billions-and are doing better than ever. Anything else is uninformed comments by you people.
---
In multi-player mode?
---
I disagree with their choice, so I choose to ban them
---
They are free to spend the money. I am free to judge them for it
---
Fallout first users have unique icons and badges, I was wondering if that would work
---
But the unlimited scrapbox had zero reasons to not be included in the free game. It has no impact on server performance at all. It's disgusting to ask money for it since people were complaining about stash limit problems from the very start. And the lie was always that it affected server performance.
---
Thank you for posting this. They need to understand that just because they enjoy being shitted, pissed and spat on by Bethesda, it doesn't mean the rest of us are too and them supporting this treatment sends a message that the monetization scheme was a success.
---
Xbox.  Most stability issues I see are with PC where specs can vary widely from one user to another. This is why I assumed the issue was on your end.
---
I wish that was true. Sadly enough you need to reinstall windows once every 1-2 years.
---
Then your argument is fuckign shit :D In GTA5 you can buy in-game currency which is used to aquire EVERYTHING the gae has to offer. It doesn't matter if there's a "free way to get them". If you can buy power with real world money - it's pay2win. There's nothing else in between.
---
Ridiculous to you.
---
 I find people who don't want to pay the $14 yet bitch about others who did ridiculous.
---
 I paid for convenience's not beat you in your imaginary competition.
---
OP, the entire point of 'fallout 1st' is for BGS to make some money off keeping the game going.   Think Shark Cards in GTA online.  Those free game DLCs don't come from thin air.
---
People already have a sub to criticize Fallout 76. This sub.
---
/sips coffee
---
Play something else
---
You wanna know what happened? Beth added fuel to a fire that was smoldering by rolling out fallout 1st in the manner they did.  The fire of negativity was slowly dying down,even if it did get tossed a log in the form of wastelanders being delayed. And so like moths to light,the hate came back with a vengeance.
---
I didn’t belittle anyone’s opinion. 
---
I mocked your **approach**.
---
If you want to have a civil discussion, don’t take content out of context. That’s what a hack does.
---
Thank you for the suggestions 
---
) will definitely check them out together
---
 (will probably sweep some of them on my own first and make sure not to use the Bloody Mess perk)
---
Don't they have to have the icon equipped?  I don't know about any badges visible.
---
I feel like it should have also been given to the people who spent $200 on the PA edition
---
Are you being serious or is this just a joke? I wanna think your just making a joke, but I'm honestly not sure. If you are serious, how old are you?
---
Can you imagine being so petty?
---
There is a lot wrong with FO76. And there is a lot of valid criticism for current events with the game as well. However, one really important thing to remember is that it is incredibly easy to manipulate sites like Reddit to give people false impressions. It's like, freelance psy ops or some shit. Just always keep a healthy sense of skepticism.
---
todd howard made this post lul, 1 year sub cost more than 10x for the game
---
I don’t own 76 so don’t give a shit if they try to improve the game or not.  
---
And the way Bethesda seems to operate I genuinely wouldn’t be surprised if they do keep all of their 76 development money in a jar.
---
I got the game and then paid money for the atom shop (have done so more than once) and guess what: I **DO NOT** REGRET IT. I'm having fun running around WV,meeting random players,checking out camps. Reading the lore on terminals or listening to holotapes. I plan to pre-order the next ES and FO games and Star field.
---
\*insert image for "Come at me bro" here\* and go a head down vote me to Hades..it won't interfere with me enjoying the game.
---
Wow, 76 got the layout and aesthetic of Helvetia down to a t
---
I dont know about that, but I think that everyone must have got a free try of one month, and BETA players a free try of one year. Having BETA players coming back to the game could be a great thing, especially if the game is more patched.
---
Good to know, thank you!
---
wait. arent you one of the dataminers that is on a few hacker websites reporting people wile selling items for real life money on ebay and other websites?
---
I could craft you a Handmade and a Lever Action Rifle if you want to play about with them. Or I could mod them if you get your hands on decent legendary ones!
---
I'm noticing fewer vendor camps and those I go to seem stuffed with bulk scrap and clothing.
---
this guy is so salty. dude sounds like you have bigger problems than fallout 1st members
---
LOL @ rich dude
---
Anyone who spend 100 bucks a year is going to set the badge to show everyone and say "look at me, I pay to win" 
---
Believe me, they don't hide it when they pay, they rub your face in it
---
Welcome to the last few fucking decades of microtransactions. They're not selling solutions to shit. Repair kits are worse than all options to repair for free in game, scrap kits are literally useless, the collection collects scrap worse that a blind monkey, the fridge is worse than all options to preserve food, no one needs infinite scrap and the tent gives you a single fucking fast travel point when you could otherwise pay the 30 fucking caps to feast travel normally.
---
This sub should be about postic pics of epic kills, cool weapons, tips, questions, and suggestions. If people truly hate FO76, they should join my sub, that way they have a space of like minded individuals who truly hate Todd Howard, Bethesda, and everything FO. 
---
That way we don't have to wade through the endless "THIS GAME IS BROKEN" posts everyday.
---
I’m absolutely certain you spend money on something that I would consider stupid
---
Yep. Almost eerie.
---
Personally I got the robot to help gather material for the weapons and gear I make for new players. Got the fridge because I hoard frog eggs and brahmin milk for my Fasnacht donuts I bake, and I got the rest cause I normally spend at least $15 on the atom shop each month (and hadn't this month), so I thought, i'm essentially getting somewhat of discount here from my usual amount.
---
It's dirt-cheap compared to renting an actual private server yourself to run and host a game session, if that was an option.
---
I'm serious, I have been blocking them manually when I see the badge or armor, and I want to automate the process
---
supply and demand... if you're good at something, never do it for free 
---
i disagree with the paywall, however, im sure private worlds will expand and gain even more advantages.. it'll probably be worth 15 euros a month then, but we shall see
---
yeah outer worlds is an actual game compared to fallout 76 laggy bug mess of a subscription with non rpg element
---
I'm sorry your offered
---
What do you do with all the caps you make?
---
I'm sorry you feel that way
---
I can safely say, after what must be about 1/3 of people I run into with the ranger outfit on, ovs. More without it. That it is too late for that. At this point its pretty much supported by the community playing the game :(
---
I may be a 1 month subscriber, but even I say #ScrapBoxForAll. I mean really, they did promise scrap wouldn't effect stash limits pre-launch, it is the least they could do.
---
I havent played as much as i would like to have over the year since it came it but i find myself constantly coming back for bursts of gameplay, have had nothing but a good time playing it :) its great :) and the people who actually play it are also great
---
Sure, but how is it Pay to Win?  I have killed the SBQ with my normal found weapons and normal found armor dozens of times.  I "won the game" without the need for having the absolute best weapons and armor in the game.  
---
So, what advantage have I missed?  
---
The problem here is players definition of "winning".  People have created their own idea of what this game is supposed to be played as. They feel that winning is having the most min/maxed toon possible.  Having the most caps and selling the most loot is some kind of winning in some folks eyes.  
---
I can attribute some of this issue to BGS, as the players need more content in order to have a game related reason to need better equipment.  Some of it is the players faults for rushing through the content and not really exploring out the game. Players got it into their heads that this is an MMO, or will play like standard MMOs, and it isn't and won't.  I saw how pissed folks were that the "raids" were not what they thought they were going to be (WoW style raids).  
---
In the end, nothing BGS has done is really pay to win, but rather a pay to convenience.  Some folks feel slighted that BGS has offered these services.  Some folks feel they are entitled to everything being free after their initial $60 purchase.  
---
Nothing offered by BGS is a necessity to play and win the game. Therefor, it is really only a purchase if you feel it is worth the money.  For some, it is.  I am on the fence about Fallout 1st because where as the Atoms alone make it worth the $100 for a year, it does not give me what I ultimately want, which is a true private modifiable server that is persistent based on the action I and my friends perform on said server.
---
&gt;Here the majority of posters dont own the game.
---
Wow, how did you figure that out? You must be some kind of genius.
---
you talk like a super mutant m8
---
I spend all day vendor hopping, I can barely keep up spending it. I have had to put in a vendor switch.
---
As far as I know, the spawn point is guaranteed, but the magazine itself is random. I've read there are few static spawns that always give the same one, but I don't know which.
---
Don’t give them any more ideas!
---
I think we need to understand that Fallout 76 isn't for *us*. It's for the gaming whales who will spend money.
---
Thanks for responding, I genuinely didn't know if you were serious or not. And to be honest I don't know if they do or would even make a mod to do it. Because like you stated already, it may be some kind of TOS violation.
---
It's not very good when you launch a subscription service before there is enough content to keep me and others going back
---
The collectors items that came with the game, which is why it's 200+ dollars, doesn't get thrown out the window, ever. It's a tangible item that lasts forever. It's a decoration. Collectors items only appreciate in value. However you can see speakers, tvs, and radios at resale and thrift shops for 5 dollars or less constantly. Interesting..
---
Me strong me best super mutant
---
Then why did OW score lower than Fallout 3 and 4? :P
---
Yeah just noticed it as a notification.  I don’t need a shit every second of the day.
---
Hardly a priority either, haha.
---
Alas, hope you’re soon able to read and when you can come back and have a browse!
---
I don't think people care that you bought something more that you are encouraging Bethesda to take suggestions from players and put them behind a subscription paywall while still having MTs. Basically people don't like it when you tell BGS it's ok to turn players into payers.
---
Was it a first users? If it was I would drop those items and forget they exist
---
They are tainted with First
---
Played since the Beta on PS4 and never had any significant issues. As far as starting out right, if you want an easy life max out on Strength early on an go for a melee build. You can always swap perk points around later on (after level 50) if you want to change. Taking over public workbenches gets you useful rewards and you get more if you defend them (a defend mission will usually start a few minutes after you take one over). However, don't stick around after that. Taking over a public workbench leaves you open to PVP.
---
Boy, have I got a loot box to sell you...
---
No, because how would they sell mods if the private servers were free?
---
Surely you can see how absurd this us right? Why does it bother you so much
---
Maybe they should think again about getting it? About whether they wish to support a company who seeks monthly access to their bank account for very little concrete content in return. A company who penalises non-subscribers by setting them at an instant disadvantage. The unlimited junk stash is what did it for me. It should be a basic game feature for everyone because stash allocation is (deliberately) insufficient since vendors and bobblehead/magazine display cases came out. They know this and are offering a paid solution to a problem they actively created. That is appaling: that this is the exclusive 'content' we have to pay a premium to access. People (like me) are very disappointed because they love the game and are very invested in it, but disagree with the principle of Fallout 1st. Any anger I've seen has been mostly directed towards Bethesda not the game itself. I personally am not angry at those who buy the subscription; I am just that sad it exists. Please don't misconstrue this as a hate post. It is just a critique of exploitative business practice.
---
How you managed to turn a post about reddit not representing the entire community into hate for Americans is beyond me...
---
Exactly, from a computer brand to another mixed with the true faulty machines ( it happen too ) it's extremely messy, might explain why we have 8 months + old issues ( On our PC side at least ) author should specify his platform too :')
---
Lmao, the butthurt is real
---
If that is the case, then extra code must have been added to make them rare
---
I considered getting the game and immediately stopped thinking about getting it because of whoever is responsible for these shitty decisions. The point is you don't get more players when what you serve is shitty, what a wild idea.
---
Private worlds are not even private since anyone on your friend list can join
---
Looking at my server right now, everyone has the free skeleton icon as their badge.  However visiting the camp you can see that they have things like the scrapbox.
---
I like it. It’s a good place to kill some time and relax my mind in a world I just enjoy. The bugs and recent Fallout 1st have shown me that Bethesda just doesn’t care and is a money hungry company. But that doesn’t mean the game is bad
---
&gt; I want to have a option where I'm not being chased around by random teenagers who think it's amazing fun to gank me with their OP shotgun that they duped a year ago. 
---
So you gave money to Bethesda ... because of their broken game ?
---
I don't have anything against you, i just want people to understand that supporting Bethesda right now mean we continue to get shitty games in the future.
---
We are the customers, the audience, we are 100% what impact marketing post-release and the content we receive. and i'm not only talking about this on reddit.
---
Are you using the 200% repair perks?
---
Arguing the semantics of "winning" doesn't deny the clear advantage that premiums have over everyone else. 
---
The phrase originated in a different context where it was meant winning in a literal sense. Then it came to be used by speakers in a wider variety of situations. It doesn't negate the concept at its core.
---
I have a funny feeling it breaks TOS somehow, but I don't see how since they pushed blocking as a way to play solo at launch 
---
But I wonder if Bethesda has changed the deal, I'm not lawyered enough to figure it out 
---
I just know a premium member is not a protected class so I'm not racist or sexist, just classiest, but that's not protected
---
I love me my Melons! +20water and +15food iirc. Plant some in your camp... you need to Find some first thought
---
Its even higher, 15 euros is 16.6 dollars
---
I don't agree with Fallout 1st, but it's wrong that there is this civil war between two groups of people in the Fallout 76 community, only a couple weeks ago everyone was liking and helping one another, now...it's all gone to shit :(
---
Go for it. Hours of fun. I've played most days since the Beta. If you liked Fallout 4, you'll like this.
---
I'll usually drop stuff off a person's camp if they are like less than level 20. Just depends.
---
Honest I get so many legendaries a playthrough I don't need them all. The purveyor sells junk so I maxed out my script and just buy once in awhile. 
---
I usually sell or just give them away to lower levels. At this point (level 329) I don't need much to have fun out there. Still good people out there.
---
No. This sub is for all things fallout. Good and bad. The alternative is called a circle jerk, where you get no discussion and just have yesmen agreeing with each other. Just because you cant handle opposing views doesn't mean anyone should go anywhere.
---
Just because you enjoy being shitted, pissed and spat on by Bethesda it doesn't mean we must "lear to do the same". Have some dignity for fuck's sake.
---
Hmmm, I guess this mod would be imperfect, but it would be a start 
---
If I block %50 percent of first users, i can maybe manually block the rest as i see them
---
True at the moment)
---
I guess you have to choose your friends carefully)) 
---
- or block them 
---
Simple solutions and I am fairly certain they will fix it.
---
I'm sorry you don't see my Point of view. Thank you anyway.
---
That's extremely petty.
---
I like how everyone thinks that their post on Reddit complaining about the price, or the quality of service all together, is going to make a difference. It won't. If game companies wanna jack up the price of a subscription service, they will do it. There's nothing we can say or do about it.
---
this bug happened to only a handfull of people. me and my friends have been trying to replicate this glitch or bug for about an hour on 12 characters in total. and so far no one has lost anything. 
---
so yes its absolutely safe to use the scrab box.
---
also i think most the people "reporting" this are lying to make this 1st look worse. since they are at the same time complaining about the 1st membership. dont believe it all...
---
Dude are you okay?
---
You’re obviously not paying attention.
---
[x] Hyper emotional
---
[x] Longing for a companies affection, no dad in the house
---
[x] Entitled

[x] Narcissist
---
Seriously man not reading that dribble.....it’s the same boo hoo you owe me /tantrum that this forum is loaded with.
---
Poor Beth will never win with you brats running around slinging poo at each other.
---
You know maybe stop wearing your fee fees on your sleeves and just play the game.
---
When the next expansion comes out and it’s amazing please feel free and post thanking everyone like me that bought the sub and atom shop and invested in the longevity of this game.  (You won’t)
---
These posts are getting older and older lol
---
It bothers me because it bothers me
---
It affects my enjoyment of the game in a negative way and I want it blocked 
---
I feel that is reasonable since it's my personal choice
---
I hope not.
---
 You aren't helping the game at all by demanding everything be free.
---
Advantage over who? Adventure mode isn't competitive. There are no 'winners' just people who have finished the story and those who haven't. And where is this flood of cheap flux you're talking about? I haven't seen any in peoples vendors. I've saw glowing &amp; hardened mass but they were to expensive for me to consider. (No opinion from me on the 5.56. I make my own)
---
Most people don’t “comprehend” this game and RPG in general?
---
There is literally *nothing* difficult to comprehend about this game. You’re just making up excuses so you can ignore criticisms of something you love.
---
Yes. I joined open servers and found those tents and scrap boxes. Apparently, you can take them to adventure mode.
---
Let the salt flow through you 😂
---
A friend indeed is a friend with crab dinner
---
thats very petty. and i dont think so. but im a first member my self
---
Not 6?
---
Actually I think it costs roughly the same price. Check out some VPS prices at OVH.com for example
---
Guess you haven't played free2play games then?
---
I don't agree.
---
I can feel that.
---
enough troll. you have made your point.
---
The thing is, at certain point there is nothing left to do except drop stuff for newbies or intentionally grief other players. Both pointless if you ask me.
---
Why a star wars reference and not a fallout one? 
---
You could offer me a nuka-salt at least 
---
Do you even play fallout?
---
I logged in yesterday after 3 weeks of playing other games, cleared WS, went to Watoga HS hoping to find something new going on or added that I hadn’t seen before. Didn’t find anything new, so I went back to another game.
---
And that's ok.
---
My question has not been answered about the TOS
---
Part of the fun. Bethesda could start selling flaming bags of ghoul poop in the Atom Store.
---
It’s a convenience, you can still sell stuff without Fallout 1st it just takes more inventory management. They may have absolutely shit PR but Bethesda aren’t stupid. 
---
The scrap box allows players too spend more time having fun and gives people more space to collect things. The scrap box gives a reason to play more and will keep the paying customers coming back for more.
---
Payed for legendary weapons encourage players to spend money to get good loot, this removing the time players spend in the game trying to collect and farm legendaries. This discourages game play and isn’t a sustainable way of keeping a paying player base.
---
Every game that introduces paid for weapons has died, but heaps of games that offer pay for convenience subscriptions thrive (Like ESO+). 
---
Despite how loud and obnoxious the general reddit crowd has been the vast majority of 76 players who have purchased atoms in the past are all enjoying Fallout 1st and think the subscription is great value for money and they’re not scared of paid for legendaries.
---
You typically do it through a UDRP which is a binding arbitration process that can do it over copyright, trademark, illegal activities, etc.
---
*Hope you have a lot of money to burn because if you’re buying into subscriptions like these you’re gonna be broke in a month*
---
The title of this post really tickled me!
---
I bought the game so I'm going to play it. That's a crazy concept I know. I think some of you need to just take a breather for awhile and come back when the salt leaves your butts.
---
inshallah, a proper answer 
---
i disagree with the paywall too, decided to get a subscription for a month, only 15€, if people purchase atoms regularly, private worlds is a good deal with all the other shit you gain 
---
however, the people did indeed ask for pivate servers, they got it.. just not for free, but if you really want a private world, 15€ aint that much if you play all day every day 
---
"if you're good at something, never do it for free" 
---
i disagree with the paywall and private world is definitely pay2win. it just allows you to get so much more out of the game, even though we already paid for the game
---
you can hate it or just try it out, cuz those fallout 1st members are enjoying their unlimited scrap for sure while haters are still crying?
---
if you care that much about the TOS, maybe you should read them?
---
Bethesda has said many times now that mods are not against TOS. but they are at own risk.
---
It will never get more players in significant numbers. The game has a well-deserved reputation in the hobby now.
---
We would probably save a lot more, our taxes are a lot higher.
---
I am not lawyered enough to understand the TOS completely
---
So I thought I would come to a website where people talk about the game and actually ask 
---
Weird I know, but it's true.
---
It affects you in no way what so ever. You're playing the same game you were last month.
---
Go to Watoga! In the outside area of the city there are a total of 9 magazine spawns, some have 2 literally right next to each, they won’t always be there but I’ve a single run usually gets me 2-3 magazines more if I’m lucky!
---
Sometimes you will find none on the server and I think most the time that means someone has done the run before you on that server, give it a couple of hours and you should find fresh servers again!  
---
2 are in Slocum joes behind the BOS vendor, and there’s a total of 2 in buses, 1 in the transit centre elevator, 2 on the monorails within the city, 1 on the school roof and there another off the top of my head I can’t remember!
---
It plays fine on my PS4. I do get server disconnects once in awhile but the game plays good for the most part. 
---
Just don't read the subs negativity and play the game. You don't need any money to enjoy the game. I think you'll enjoy it, I do.
---
So you're here offering opinions on a game you don't have?
---
Providence Equity Partners, and they initially invested $300 million in 2007 for a 25% stake in Zenimax, then an additional $150 million in 2010, for an undisclosed reason. A vulture capitalist firm basically owns 1/3 of Zenimax, and all it's holdings.
---
&gt;Could care less what it converts to in USD it's not my currency AUD is.
---
First of all I agree that 1st is shit but if you actually think this you're ignorant.
---
You want to talk about semantics,  but then try and school me about the origin of play to win as a concept.  Ok. That's as semantic as it gets.
---
Nothing being offered today is a necessity to playing and winning the game.
---
Trade you my medical bills and student loans
---
I just think its ridiculously expensive.
---
I bought the game for around 70€
---
I have to pay for XBox live which is 60€ each year. And the game is almost one year old and its the only game i play online so the game costs me 130€  
---
So if i wanna play on a private server i have to pay like 120€ a year so that would be like 250€ in total i'd spend for fallout 76. I'm drawing a line here. I paid for the game and i'm not wasting anymore money on it.
---
I dont categorize free2play games with full priced AAA games.
---
It's not the same game it is now a two-tiered game. 
---
you now have the one tear the people who bought the game and originally came out and haven't spent any more money
---
And now you have the premium tier the people who pay the monthly fee
---
That is a fundamental change to the game and how it plays and you can't deny that
---
I am simply trying to restore the game to how it was before this happened and ignore all of the first users
---
So in essence I'm trying to get back what I lost
---
&gt;The classic trope of the downtrodden husband coming home from a horrible day at work and then beating his wife and kid. He can’t lash out at his boss, because he’s get fired and it wouldn’t have any affect on his boss. But he CAN take out his frustration and blame his wife and kid for something. 
---
&gt;This is displaced aggression, and it’s a coping technique, albeit an immature one. 
---
&gt;You can’t get a reaction out of Bethesda/Zenimax, so you lash out elsewhere. It’s a temper tantrum, nothing more.
---
This is you belittling someone's opinion.... a civil discussion would require some honesty on your part.
---
I saw one of the little camps that come with 1st, neat, can you put more items in the camp?
---
::camera slowly pans across the 98% of blissfully unaware FO76 players who never heard of r/fo76, who don't read about games on the internet, who are just sitting at home happily spending 50 cents a day for some convenience in a game they play alone or with a couple of friends who also have no reason to care about corporate politics, because it's just a game, man::  
---
It is a game. ONE game. \*POSSIBLY\* an ENTIRE FRANCHISE or TWO or THREE that might be "ruined" by the way companies make money with games these days. It's sad, yeah. I would like things to be better. But on the scale of actual G-ing AF? An optional subscription service in a game is like... SO LOW on my list of problems with the world. Face it, people who take the time to type paragraphs about a game - you, me - we're such a tiny fraction of people in gaming, we're just farting into the wind. No one cares. I don't care. If it bugs me, i have many other games i can play. Even free ones that cost me nothing. I paid for the sub this month because i wanted that Halloween bundle and i needed some Atoms. Who knows? I may do it again sometime. Y A W N. I'm still playing. Game still exists.   
---
Tl:dr: Vocal minority, blah blah.
---
I’ve played since beta. I have a level 200 and level 97 character. I know the game inside and out because it’s all I play and I love the grind. I too purchased one month of the subscription that I will not renew. I spent 4 hours the other night grinding a nuked whitesprings solo. My haul was incredible. This is pay to win.
---
&gt;I'm not the one pushing the market in this direction, it's everyone else that does the same thing as me that does it!
---
Do you have the Dromedary perk ? I don't remember seeing it in the patch notes but maybe they nerfed it?
---
And mine
---
And they wanna make their money back, hence why Bethesda are implementing these cash grab shitty practices, Fallout 1st and Elder Scrolls Blades for example
---
Dude, you are missing the point. I have friends who subscribed, and I tried those private servers. The game works better. Silo runs go smoothly, little or no lag or latence. Overall improved performance. Even hit detection: no more scorched hitting you a second after you shot them. 
---
You talk about the Fallout4 experience, well, there Is a better working experience for those fellows players who pay extra. Which means: the game could work better for everyone. 
---
I love the game. I have put 1060 hours in it. But this Is like selling me a can for 20 and renting me the can opener for another 20 bucks. Not fair. Even worse, when some bugs haven't been fixed since release.
---
Overpriced? It's cheaper than the Atoms alone.
---
Star Wars is funnier and do you lol?
---
Really nice work 👍
---
 Nah bro I just hate bougies. Class war!
---
It what world is any of the content in Fallout First content that should be in the base game? None of these things were a problem with Path of Exile, ESO, WoW, or literally any other big “fan favorite” game did it,
---
But suddenly Fallout 76 does it, to make back the money they spent to make this atrocity that (whether you’re ready to admit it or not) has VASTLY improved since launch, and everybody is suddenly butthurt and Crying about it.
---
It isn’t about the Subscriptions or the fact that it’s sending “the wrong message to ‘AAA’ companies” or about the fact that any of this stuff “should be in the game by default” because newsflash, the subscription isn’t bad (I understand that they have acknowledged bugs with the service, acknowledging it means they’re fixing it, nobody should be held to infallibility, it takes a lot to program this shit neither you nor I could do it), it’s not sending any messages to ‘AAA’ companies the message was sent to them long ago by MANY other games this isn’t New not by a long shot, and last but not least, THIS CONTENT IS NOT OWED TO PLAYERS IT IS A BENEFIT GRANTED TO THOSE WHO CHOOSE TO SUPPORT THE GAME, NOT YOU OR ANYBODY IS ENTITLED TO IT.
---
The fact of the matter is, this cry of snowflakes is very simple. It’s because it’s Fallout 76. There’s no other reason. No other bullshit about it. If it was any other game, nobody who give a flying fuck, it’s been proven, by the COUNTLESS other games that ALREADY employ a subscription service pretty much identical to this one.
---
&gt; harassing
---
Not really harassing though is it. Put the victim complex to rest.
---
The reality is that you take offence to the statement because you are annoyed at the cause/effect of it. You *want* to spend money but you *don't want* to be seen as responsible for an industry that puts more stock in making money than making quality products.
---
It’s a basic function of the game behind a paywall. It’s not cool to limit players from the function because they aren’t subscribers
---
I always thought Star wars was more of a fantasy action-adventure than a comedy and yes I do
---
The only food perk I use is the less drain at camp. I run speed demon so the drain varies based on activity, but nothing should have changed on the refreshment that I can tell.
---
&gt;last few fucking decades
---
uh, no bud. Microtransactions in gaming hasn't been around for a few decades. Maybe 1 decade, and that started with mobile gaming.
---
Great article! I just discovered this sub/group/one true religion and am happy to join! Praise him! 
---
Will post a pic ASAP of my shrine :)
---
Nearly anytime I get a good roll on a low-level legendary I'll scan the map for someone with a low enough level to use it and drop it for them. We were all there once, and it's going to mean a lot more to them than the caps or scrip will to me. I just hope they'll pay it forward someday.
---
As an Aussie indicated below... please .... we love you guys, you're our dear US cousins and family, but please, stop thinking that translating to US$ is an accurate way of determining value. As a Canadian I pay 15 to 20 dollars for a bottle of aspirin that you can buy for $8.00. (Yes, same make and size) \~ Fu\*k the exchange, your demographics influence purchasing power much more than the FX does.
---
I'm with you on really disliking Fallout 1st and on possibly never getting back into the game again.
---
However, the only thing that should have been for free is the scrapbox and tent. See absolutely no problem having the riot gear being sold on the Atom Store and private worlds being for free is just unrealistic.
---
If everything in Fallout 1st not being free is holding you back, good luck dude.
---
If this affects your enjoyment of a game. You really need to seek therapy.
---
That's so weird...I haven't noticed it but I didn't really get to play over the weekend. I'll have to keep an eye on it later!
---
Added!
---
Private servers aren't even servers just instances
---
I can take that under advisement however this mod would be a lot cheaper than therapy so I would like to try that first
---
You’ve clearly never spent much time with toddlers.
---
Yeah, it feels a bit sneaky. I really don't see how the shop could be supportive enough though.
---
Same here hell I even met PKOA and that's a big bunch of new friends that made F76 one of my main games
---
It's unfortunately not up to you to decide other people's standards.
---
I enjoy the heck out of it. A long day at work or in general I boot my ps4 and go in to the wasteland. I enjoy it. I'm gone for awhile. 
---
There scenery is nice, just to roam around and kill things, do events, shop at people's places, check out their setups. Talk with random people and find out we have more in common than just a game. You don't need any extra money to enjoy the game.
---
Are you seeing that on a private server? That's part of my question. I know 8 spawns in watoga, but only can ever get 1 magazine in a private world
---
The Private Servers aren't even private just instances of used servers so areas you'd go may have already been looted
---
I'm with you I do not get on this sub till I'm at work, and I was hoping to come back from the weekend and read about either what people have found or just stories about there experience in the private worlds something, but no almost a week later and still the same stuff. Paying for the sub is nothing really for me iv been playing more since the update, and its nice to play for three hours and just explore and find junk I need than to server hop and  i do not do that its not fun to me, I'm an adult that gets a pay check and yeah to me the cost and "free" stuff I get is worth my time. I did a monthly sub so down the road I can cut it off when I move on. I stopped buying games at full price so I do game pass, me and the wife share an account and I went from paying around 60-120$ a month on games that i would play for a month and go back to fallout 4 or skyrim or smite and pay for gems on that game, now I dont play smite or pay gems for that game and I'm saving money so the sub for me is justified. Any time a pay for I game full price is for the wife and the games she likes are usually 20 or 30 bucks. But I will say, If you hate it cool move on, like OP said...Grab another shit game and go hate on it.
---
But you see, if we continue to throw money at Bethesda, they will eventually fix all issues. This is what fanboys keep saying. It has been a year since the release of Fallout 76 and there are more bugs then ever before! And people are trying to justify that somehow.
---
So fallout is a comedy? Since you said I should have used a Nuka joke? Lol
---
well you have your answer troll
---
Ah yes, for only $100 a year I can have a private server for the 0 friends that still play this game rather than join those cramped lobbies with only 10 people. Plus i get enough v bucks to buy TWO REFRIGERATORS!  /s
---
The game hasn't made it's worth the cost unless you buy it during a sale and even then once you finish the main story line there isnt much to do other than grind caps or perk cards and build up your stats for pretty much nothing. Most the people who are in the lobbies are low levels being trained by their level 500 friend and trying to pvp end up being a 1 shot kill repetitive fight. 
---
I still like to get on every once and a while but it gets boring too quickly.  And the outer worlds basically scratches my itch for a good lore game.
---
&gt; over-monetising this game
---
Nobody asked you to pay a single cent since you bought the game, am I wrong?
---
There is no change. Open your eyes, the only people whose game has changed are those who've spent the money on the subscription. With your logic your should be blocking people with legacy weapons to simply because they can only be obtained through a purchase of some kind. The changes brought by the subscription physically change nothing for you besides seeing a tent here and there. You haven't lost anything, you're forcing yourself to hate these people for no reason other than them spending money on something they enjoy. Your hate is changing the game a hell of a lot more than any subscription.
---
Ahhh this is the type of post I missed on this Reddit. Those ideas are all amazing, I need those clothing manikins. May I add Power armor display racks and a robot that greets your guest/customers at your camp.
---
You're not wrong, Walter, you're just an asshole.
---
You have fun? Good keep playing and enjoy yourself!
---
No more  fun or never played to begin with? Wtf Why are those imbeciles coming her then? Srsly?
---
Don't buy it, don't play it, leave those who do it alone... You think that's easy, but most people are just stupid lol!
---
Nope. https://revddit.com/r/fo76/comments/dnidl0/fallout_1st_players_are_being_targeted_in/f5d36tl/?context=3#t1_f5d36tl 
---
Mods shadow removed my comment instead of contacting me directly and just removing it directly. I didn't know the FO76 subreddit of all was full of mod abuse
---
I'm telling you that just because the phrase doesn't apply 100% doesn't mean it's 100% invalid, but I guess you are being wilfully hard of understanding.
---
We are talking about prospective players being out off by the negativity/bethesda bad practice. A prospective players views are just important to the future healrh/success of the game.
---
⬆️This⬆️ I just renewed both of my gamer tags for 3 years of Xbox gold each and then subscribed to the game pass ultimate deal for $1 for the first month and it converted all 36 months of each account to game pass ultimate for that $1.
---
This happens if you are staggered during the stimpak revive animation.
---
Notice ps4 is composed of almost decade old hardware. It ain't about operating systems Sony better come up with ps5 soon cause it's lacking badly
---
So the people who are wrecking this sub for karma shouldn't have a space to go that gives them the freedom to trash talk this game?
---
I'm sorry I didn't realize we had a newcomer. Fallout is a post-apocalyptic RPG with comedy and fantasy elements. Fallout 1 and Fallout 2 had a lot more of the comedy elements than some of the more recent ones do but even as recent as Fallout 4 and Fallout 76 you can find lots of jokes and funny quests. Comedy is kind of at the heart of Fallout. I hope you enjoy the game
---
No, just I only signed on to reddit a few days ago. Not shilling for Bethesda ether thank you. 
---
So yea, you never answered my question, how old does a account need to be to be real in your eyes?
---
No I do this run all the time on public servers.. in fact I haven’t done the run since private servers came out so I’m yet to try, basically now I know all the spawns are there I can’t help but do the quick 2minute run round Watoga and check for them every time I’m there! 😂 there’s also a bobble head on the school roof if you didn’t know!
---
You clearly don’t understand sarcasm 😂
---
This is the 3rd time I've heard fallout is "dead" or "dying".  
---
1. Brotherhood of steel- first time on console, overall quality of game.  2. Fallout 3- making it first person will kill the game!!1. 3. Present day.  Fallout 76 may very well be dying, but fallout will be here for a long time.
---
Agree Filthy casuals is all about the good parts of 76.
---
Exactly. Someone with an opinion that differs to yours is not a hater. Where some see a debate, others see an argument.
---
The first time I did this quest I laughed so hard, until I got disconnected and had to do the quest again. Needless to say, the second time it wasn't that funny. The third time it got frustrating as hell.
---
But this is a lie, simple as that. If you're upset that a lot of people here enjoy the game in spite of it's many and damning flaws, then go outside and yell in frustration.
---
Xb1 😊
---
I have to pay if I want to experience everything, yea. By not paying I’m not getting the unlimited component storage and a multitude of other F1st perks or atom shop items that give players an admittedly slight, but still very real advantage. 
---
If you’re just going to defend Fallout 1st, then I really can’t be bothered arguing with you, have a great day :)
---
Should've just done it like Minecraft where paying the sub gives you access to "realms" or premium servers that they host for you, but if you have the hardware and know-how you can just host your own for free if you want.
---
They could even include other stuff into the subscription like outfits or whatever I don't think many people care about that kind of stuff. But having an entire portion of the game cut off from you because you don't give them money is where the outrage is coming from I think.
---
It's pretty obvious to me the sole reason they did this is to monetize mods though like they've been trying to do for years.
---
I've legit never paid the fee to get in. At least half of the times I've been shaken down have resulted in two murdered riften guards and me hauling ass away from there.
---
I got ganked AND my post was removed by a mod few hours ago, wasn't even toxic rant, just a story. Not only that but I've seen several other posts on Fallout Worst get disliked bomb for stating facts.
---
You buy it. You support it.
---
Holy shit, they changed a fucking storage variable for 100$/y and you're finding it poetic. You guys are all fucking baboons.
---
Upvoted for an honest opinion, but, trust me, if the franchise can survive brotherhood of steel, fallout 76 wont be its ultimate demise.
---
And you are willfully ignoring the pure fact that nothing being offered is a necessity to winning the game.  
---
Don't like the service, don't buy it.  It is not a necessity, so you shouldn't pay for something you don't like.  People willing to pay for it feel it is worth the price.  Good for them.  If you have FOMO, that's 100% a you problem.
---
Games like this exploit a psychological phenomenon in people called the fear of missing out
---
People have this innate fundamental fear on missing out on things that everyone else is getting involved with
---
now when I see these first users I start getting feelings of that psychological feeling that I am missing out and that I am somehow not playing the game properly or something because I'm not spending money
---
it messes with my enjoyment of the game so I want to block it so I can have the game that I had a few months ago
---
Bethesda gave trolls free range to trash the game through there relentlessly shitty decisions. Its not just trolls you want to silence though is it? It's anyone that disagrees with your view. Well sorry creating your shitty subreddit was a waste of your time, and if you use this sub you will unfortunately be subjected to views beyond your own. It's scary I know, but you will just have to deal with it.
---
“You bought a membership for a game you play a lot... you are killing video games”
---
I do?
---
It is definitely interesting how no one seems to suggest the solution of removing the scrapbox from the subscription, not giving it to anyone, and offering a refund to those who no longer want the subscription under the changed conditions. That would be entirely fair, just not give free stuff to people.
---
Oh wait you were trying to be funny 
---
oh 
---
okay
---
Yes, let's talk about WoW.  Monthly subscription.  Additional options that you can choose to buy.  Required purchase of each expansion.
---
I guess the reason I really don't find this unusual at all is because I've been playing MMOs for so long.
---
Way to support the developer!
---
I'm more upset that this will likely be the only way to get the NCR ranger armor, one of the most iconic sets in the Fallout Series. 
---
Although part of me is also sure that it probably looks like absolute shit.
---
I’m 22 now (born the same year as Fallout) but I remember watching my dad play Fallout when I was a kid, watched him play 1, 2, Tactics and 3 and then he installed Fallout 3 on my PC and that was the start of my life long love for Fallout. It brings a smile to my face knowing there’ll be more kids growing up experiencing Fallout like I did 😊
---
So this is what it takes to build class consciousness
---
OP is Todd Howard in disguise 🤣
---
Oh ok. You can also make sure you have all of your damage perks and shoot from stealth since the amount of wear it takes is based on damage dealt.
---
You mean a game isnt recommended because of a lack of good content after you finish the main storyline? Who woulda thought?!?!  /s
---
The game is like a trap becuase its promising at first then once you finish the story it's a sharp spiral downwards of repetitive bs.
---
 I would only recommend buying it if it's on sale becuase there are plenty of good games that are half as expensive as 76 at full price.
---
&gt;If you’re just going to defend Fallout 1st, then I really can’t be bothered arguing with you
---
Yea that is exactly the point of my post. Have a great day too, sir.
---
No, they’ll never make them free. With all the backlash I could imagine a lower priced “Private servers only” plan, but running those servers carries a cost for Bethesda, so I can’t foresee any scenario where they’re totally free.
---
It's almost like the people who don't like the changes aren't playing...
---
🤦🏾‍♂️ 😂
---
So you've spent enough time in a private server to make the determination that it's game breaking?
---
Ehhhh... I’ll keep my taxes.
---
4 times in size is actually true. I did the test and walked from south to north in FO4. Took me 10 minutes. Took 20 in FO76.
---
That is not the issue here - as well you know.
---
You’re definition of winning is different to mine I guess.
---
Or what about if all of those that don't want to pay for the sub just keep playing like they have been doing so far, when they were perfectly fine with 800lbs of stash? Like me, like everyone else that has been playing when the sub did not even exist?
---
I realised the other day while waiting for the outer world's to drop that you guys pay ten more dollars than us Aussies do.
---
Time to die, mutie
---
Yes dont let everyone on Twitter, Reddit, all the gaming news and review channels, Kotaku, IGN, BBC, PC Gamer, Eurogamer, Polygon, and Forbes tell you otherwise. All the comments here, and in each and every single one of those media outlets tell you that the majority are upset. Obviously every single one I mentioned along with the 100+ comments left on each and every single one are the MiNoRiTy
---
LOL!!!!!!!!!!!!!! This game is DEAD!
---
I highly doubt that, but I don't care either.
---
Every thread these days has an EDIT. Say what you mean and stick with it! Stop defending yourself from the internet. Who cares. It IS dirt cheap. It’s relative term. And it’s relative to you OP. 
---
And yes. People buying it ARE supporting bethesdas decision to be fuckinf stupid with this game.
---
If you have done mayor for the day at watoga then that's a pretty safe place for exploration.
---
Posts like this help me realize most of the complainers on this board are not actually Fallout fans.
---
I think youre broken
---
have a good day
---
Meh.  Killing video games?  There's a very strange element to this hysteria, wherein people are confused about history.  Paying to buy a game and then a monthly sub were \*standard\* for big, well-developed MMOs.   EQ, WoW, CoH, etc.
---
Later, games that were free came along, and the big guys had to change, or at least adjust. 
---
It's obviously a good question of whether the sub price is worth the price to you.  It's obviously a good question of whether some "1st" features should be baseline.  It is not, however, a matter of great drama or a game-industry-killing slippery slope.  Game companies have and will continue to modify their strategies to make money.
---
My two cents: I would have much rather seen private server instances as a standalone sub, disconnected from other benefits, and cheaper.  I think that unlimited scrap should either not exist or be baseline.
---
Assertions that inclusion of the unlimited scrap feature makes a lie of previous restrictions on stash is nonsensical.  The stash is likely limited due to total number of unique, tracked items.  Scrap isn't uniquely tracked, it's in a stack.  There wouldn't be a server difference between 1 or 1,000 quantity of a given type of scrap.
---
Vats isn't considered aiming
---
Yea, great examples there. Credibility-wise, you forgot the Flat Earth Society
---
Eh, if this rolled out 6+ months ago when I was really active would have jumped on it.  The simple truth is that it would have let me play a friends only coop with no griefing or unexpected pvo, basically I (and friends) could run workshops for events.  Which was what I wanted from fo76 in the first place.
---
Then nerfed the scrap bot after selling it.
---
I never made this personal about you but okay
---
Microsoft didnt make The Outer Worlds, but I'm sure you knew that.
---
If Obsidian agreed to have their game as part of a subscription service for £1 that's up to them, I'm sure MS paid them well.
---
If the games good (not actually tried it yet) then I expect I will buy it once the sub runs out.
---
I honestly saw this coming. I did. I don’t even play 76 and I did. Bethesda started a civil war in their own game
---
For what it is worth, Microsoft's [Xbox most played games chart](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/store/most-played/games/xbox) currently shows the game at position 36 in the USA, while it was 41st last week before patch 14, and 39th on October 9. While the data is hardly enough to be representative of global trends, I doubt there was a mass exodus of players, and a minor bump makes sense with people returning to try the subscription for just one month ($13 is affordable, and 1 month is about enough for a new playthrough on private worlds).
---
Don't hate the game. Never hated the game. Never hated BGS.  Had frustrations with the game, but after 700 hours played, I have gotten every pennies worth out of this game.
---
&gt; grab another shit game
---
1. I don't think a worse game exists
---
2. At least you realize that 76 is shit
---
3. If you really hate this subreddit, leave it.
---
Is 76 even a AAA game?  With so many re used assets from for fo4 and the state of the game at launch.  I never got the feeling it was close to being a AAA game.  From a AAA developer sure, but a AAA game.
---
I have heard these complaints about every online game since hmm.. around 1998.  I imagine the "other game" everyone went to has a complaint section as well. Pick your poison, or don't drink it. No one is making anyone sub. OH NO THEY LIED! Now I won't sub! Said everyone always, since at least '98.
---
&gt; What happened to this community? 
---
What happened is you pissed off a bunch of children by having something they don't, even though you paid for it.
---
Anyway, isn't half the point of fallout 1st, you playing on your own server?  Might be seen as rubbing other player's noses in your riches...
---
Wait a second. 1st buyers are really shaming those that dont have it? How fucking out of touch with reality are these people.
---
Poetic, I don’t know. I’ve got a lot of questions about this business model, don’t know if I’ll renew or not. But for a little while, it’s helping me find a new level of depth to the game. Just a little joy. Hope you have a good day man.
---
Cheers
---
Because its server based hosting, not client based.  Someone has to pay for the AWS instance.
---
Lol that's a good point about it being a days worth of smokes. I bet if I could stop going to Tim Hortons for my coffee every morning for a couple weeks, I could probably pay for 3 months of Fallout 1st.
---
Stop trying to sound like Russ my guy. There's no philosophical bullshit here. That's called fomo everyone knows it. If you want to have this misconception go ahead. You're believing something you know isn't true. Every single game has this feature so why is this such a big deal? You can chose to feel as if you're missing out when everything different between playing normally and having first is very clearly laid out for you. This isn't about the game being pay to win, which it isn't, this is just about you feeling as if you're missing out. So then you try switch it by being blatantly discriminatory towards those with first. This hate that's being thrown around is absolutely ridicules and this is a prime example. If you're so insecure about missing out on 1st then buy it otherwise stop complaining because it's going to ruin this game a lot faster, a game many still enjoy, myself included
---
Yea, it's almost like as if the company who made the game knows how to sell their product better than random internet users. /s
---
I met a player at Flat Woods that had his mic on swearing up a storm trying to find 1 screw checking everywhere he offered me 100 caps for 1 screw I ended up giving him some for free.
---
I'd think i have no team, i don't know what discord is and go on about my day wishing them a good time.
---
Nice try Todd.
---
who said anything personal?
---
you wanted to know if its against TOS.
---
I told you its not against TOS.
---
I informed you that you have an answer.
---
When you say "I do?" 
---
You seem very confused?
---
Upvoting I would also like to know more about this!
---
&gt;  If everyone learned that and lived by it, or at least enough people, no companies would try it. Their last game would always be the one in which they did exactly this, which is pretty leanient considering the paid alpha status and unfulfilled features gamers have begun paying for.
---
&gt; At least we can throw Obsidian in Bethesda's face.
---
But virtually no one has learned it or lived it. We can thrown Obsidian in Bethesda's face until they become a AAA company. If that ever happens then they will follow the same path because countless other companies have followed the same path with no consequences.
---
I too got the game and a package with my OneX a couple months after release. My buddy did the same and we played together for awhile. Eventually the bugs and glitches that we laughed about as well as the server disconnects became too irritating and I stopped playing.
---
After a couple months off we jumped back in and found that stuff actually had improved. We talked another friend into joining in and began having a blast. That, coupled with the announcement of Wastelanders had me very excited for the future of the game. It was easy to ignore all the Atom shop issues and them using our feedback to monetize shit we suggested.
---
Then the delay announcement hit and I was disappointed. But I told myself, "Hey maybe this means they're learning something and want to make sure the release is done right". Nope, they decided it was more important to release an overpriced subscription service   with even more shit the community has been asking for locked behind a paywall.
---
I respect the fact that you're still playing, but I've had enough. My friends were bummed, but I divvied up my shit with them last night and uninstalled the game. Of course I could keep playing as I was before with little to no effect from Fallout 1st, but every time i thought about it i asked myself why? This is going to continue
---
You need to check out fallout online (or what it would have been anyway)
---
The (original) idea was that the game would fund ongoing updates through cosmetic microtransactions (a method that has been used successfully on numerous games before).
---
With dozens and dozens of the 'micro' transactions costing as much as the current cost of the game itself, they shot themselves in the foot.  One would think they'd simply adjust, not pivot.
---
why am I the bad guy here 
---
I bought the game the way Bethesda sold it
---
I fully got on board with how it was the day they sold it 
---
they changed the agreement 
---
they change the rules 
---
I want to go back to how it was before and suddenly I'm the bad guy?
---
Yeah, good point. I imagine it would feel more like one if I was more involved in the game’s community/took my builds more seriously/etc. Based on how I play now, I don’t see it giving me an edge over other players, but it makes things smoother for sure.
---
Change public or private? If public someone els have been there before. If private, have you been gone for more then 20 min before log back on?
---
It is extremely good, as someone who hasn't played anything other than fallout games in years I can say as my first step out of the franchise this is a fantastic game really comes back to a new Vegas like vibe and a lot of character
---
Being, at a guess, an at-best partial revenue stream? Depends how much everyone spends there outside in-game-earned atoms I guess. Only Bethesda will know that, but I’d hazard they can’t run a game on that income.
---
TPC, not sure if this is completely fair.  There are hundreds (if not more) people logging in with multiple characters, all holding 10,000 lbs of weapons, armor and ammo.  In fact, they have to squat in place, because they can't move due to being over encumbered.  Each item (in which there are thousands); has numerous attributes, which all have an integer assigned to it.  Values for energy resistance, impact, poison, damage, night values, day values, etc.  The server has to use resources to keep track of all of those items.  Then, a chest armor can't be indexed as "chest armor", there are 50 different kinds of chest armor, all with incrementing/decrementing values on them.  I don't think the community as a whole understands how ambitious this game was to create in the first place.  There are hundreds, if not thousands of people taking advantage of this - they log in with 10 characters, across 2 - 5 xbox's; all farming for CAPS, all their stash's multiplied by 10 in weight.  These servers do not have an infinite amount of memory and processing power; which is what it would take to allow 25 people on this server, using the shady methods of dupp'ing and trading stuff like they do.  I'm just saying that there are countless people who are already "paying to win" on these servers, which have nothing to do with Bethesda.  Kinda pointless of telling Bethesda how greedy they are, when we're doing it to ourselves.  At least if I have a private server, I know that there are no legendary God level duplicated items being used to knock me off of a work bench, after I've invested caps, resources and time to acquire...
---
Yes haven't played for 20 hours
---
You said mods are not against the TOS but use at your own risk. that makes it sound like not all mods are allowed. I want clarification on whether this specific mod would be against the TOS
---
Perhaps you are the one who is confused?
---
1) I haven't seen the balance sheet, but its not hard to imagine them needing more money to continue.
---
2) THEN STOP PLAYING... if enough do that you will get your wish.
---
3) Not talking bad about this game has no effect on other games afaik. Not sure how this relates to topic.
---
4) Yes, all a corporation cares about is Money. Welcome to Earth.
---
I think it's as simple as, you have something the other kids do not and they are pissed about it.
---
Whatever.  I feel BGS is trying to salvage what they can out of '76 to keep it afloat.  If that means selling private sessions and goodie bags, that's what's going to happen.  They're in this for the money, so get used to it.  Alternative would be them shutting down Fallout 76 in 6 months.
---
Game is officially pay to win. Thought I should remind you lmao
---
So then it have a chance for low and/or high levels to spawn ^^
---
No the lower spawn is about magazines
---
&gt;Who are you to tell me what I do and don't like and what I do and don't want? And what I do or don't   
---
play??
---
&gt; The best way to make a difference is through using your voice and discouraging others from spending money. 
---
::eye roll emoji::
---
Well, it's time to return to Appalachia.
---
Oddly enough the only legit worry I see is that it fragments the community.  The good groups of folks will probably just shift to mostly private instances with friends.  Haven't seen that mentioned in one of these rant threads yet though.
---
I never said anything about You being a bad guy don't change my words. I said your hate is the issue. Of course they changed the rules, no game stays the same as release day otherwise it would die quickly. It's the same core game.
---
You can repair it even if you've barely used it. I like to go to Morgantown train yard, lots of easy enemies and benches. Kill a few, repair, rinse, repeat. Don't use weapon artisan you'll just screw yourself.
---
No it will help..more money to develop content
---
so much drama and histrionics.  i'll just assume all these white knights have NEVER bought a loot box in any other game; or any modern ubisoft title for that matter
---
Actually I have been running the pride flag since it came out, and I will continue to run that one for the foreseeable future on all of my accounts.
---
I got FO 1st to try these private servers and have a better Raid experience for my Discord buddies. I figured $8 and change a month is less than a bottle of wine and I will get more off of a smaller server so the cost is worth it for me. 
---
I am sorry you have such a negative view towards people using this service but please feel free to add my accounts to your block list IGN: Karthathan , TheHoboSeer, EmeraldAshura, and KarthsKubby as I am sure our personalities would not mesh well. I tend to enjoy playing with chill, laidback, and positive people, and rejoice that I can effectively stack my server now with those that are like-minded. 
---
I wish you luck in the wasteland!
---
Not sure who downvoted my comment, but my point was that demands to make subscription exclusive stuff free for everyone do seem to be about entitlement, rather than principles. Because the latter would be also satisfied by removing the paid for convience features altogether, and no one is entitled to getting someone else's intellectual property for free. I personally do not care about the subscription, I did not buy it myself, but for others who did, good for them, the game is still the same for non-subscribers.
---
I may grumble and complain but I do, in fact, love the game.
---
Vats is sighted aiming. But that classification only works on random things.
---
I love the game, but that doesn’t mean I can’t criticize it or its developer. If anything, that gives me more cause to do so when necessary—I’m invested in it and I want it to be great.
---
$100 is ten times $60? Huh. Maybe i need to relearn math.
---
I have noticed that water goes down faster than usual. I had about 80 waters on me and sell around 20 or 30 when i notice i have that much and now im down to 50 and it keeps going down so now  i have to build water purifiers in my CAMP
---
dude i think you had enough. 
---
Mods are always at own risk. since they have  a chance at breaking the game. 
---
mods are NOT against TOS. but on your own risk. so you cant come to Bethesda and say "hey this mod broke my game. fix it!!!!"
---
seriously how old are you?
---
Then explain it.  OP is not wrong.
---
You can Dilute Stimpacks for a smaller heal but you get two for one, very useful early on
---
Milk Brahmin, there milk removes rads, milking does not guarantee  you get some but try the three or four around flatwoods and try multiple times till it stops you.
---
Find bloodleaf by the rivers and sootflower everywhere and turn these into Healing salve; craft-able heal, great early game, im usually running with a stack of 40 or so
---
exactly.  i think part of the reason is that ppl are *actually playing the game* instead of spending their time arguing on the internet.
---
not me tho; i'm stuck at work
---
'Them'? 'They?' I actually love playing this game and have a great time doing so. This is my subreddit! I'm unsure why you think I, and people like me, should be sent away to another sub to voice our dissatisfaction at a major development in the direction of our favourite game? Those 'for' and 'against' this change should have the freedom to discuss, debate, even argue their points together here. Yes, you get idiots and you get sensible people on any sub: that's life and that's the internet. We have to exist alongside each other and keep up that dialogue.
---
Not sure why you're going on about armor to such an extent when I said "junk stacks" but ok.
---
&gt; This world just feels like someone took fallout 4 and removed all the people and shrunk the map down... 
---
That's exactly what they did.
---
wHo aRE yOu To TeLl mE wHat to bE maD abOUt?
---
Nah it’s useless in that respect. But by the time you use it to auto scrap all your junk,you can fast travel to where you need to go. Dropping it’s free and if you load into a game that has a camp in its spot it gets repacked.
---
You have to wait for the wastelanders DLC for human NPCs. They decided those things should be added after a $100 subscription service.
---
Yup, this sub, YouTube, other gaming subs, pretty much the entire YouTube shitting alllllll over this game.... Only make up a "specific" fraction.
---
Nah, the only "specific fraction" is the people who still play this game. I HIGHLY doubt the player count has increased, and bet the trend has been on a steady downward trend
---
Aww im sorry I hurt your feelings.  
---
Every single thing you've said here is bullshit with zero facts to back it up. These are the MAJOR gaming news media outlets that, basically the entire gaming world, goes to for news.  
---
Tell me, what is a LEGIT CREDIBLE gaming news outlet? Because once you tell me what you deem LEGIT and CREDIBLE, I will pull up an article of them showing their disdain for a bullshit of this piece of shit "game"
---
I play on PS4, they both run fine for me. Server stability is an issue if you build a ridiculous amount of stuff in a small area on ark. But only while that stuff is loading in for you. The rules are concrete and they didn’t go backwards with the updates that I recall. Just too much required time investment. I’m just describing my experience, I hope you find something that works to your satisfaction
---
Not yet, I could imagine the tent becomming free for everyone at some stage, and 1st users would get a reduced budget for the tent camp, or maybe a shared budget, I dunno.
---
It's practical, but without a workbench to scrap guns and armor you'll still have to waddle off to scrap quite often.
---
Just because it's cheaper compared to another currency in the game doesn't mean it's fairly priced.
---
Are you just gonna make a circle jerk and ride the hate wagon? 
---
seriously dude be original

The karma train left already.

Yeah, there was a deal where you could upgrade your Gold subscription to a Games Pass Ultimate for $1. My gold just renewed, so I got 12 months of Xbox and PC Games Pass for $1. I just have to remember to cancel and get normal Gold before it starts renewing next year at the Games Pass Ultimate Price.

Thanos would like a word

I have a small conspiracy theory that bethesda community managers use alt accounts too massivly downvote and gank us.

Working on it!

I own the game but I just wanna know if it will become free to play?

I mean it literally plays like one

yeah, seems weird.  bobbleheads, too, seem rarer in private instances.
---
Hell yeah, shout me down for sharing my opinion about the game on the sub for it.
---
Imagine caring about karma
---
How could you go on? You condescendingly picked apart the guys whole comment lol. I feel like the release time of it was bad with the news on wastelanders but after all is said and done and wastelanders is out... lets be honest... thats a lot of game. FO first is totally optional too.
---
&gt; Life is not fair or evenly balanced.
---
Yeah but Fallout 76 is not life. It's a video game and games can be made balanced by their developers.

just another circle jerker looking for karma

Wait what? I didn't know there us a wasteland doc, do we know a release date?
---
He is right. This type of personality is enabled, in our society, that enjoys being arrogant and doesn't give a shit about others. This goes hand in hand with the cult of being snobbish about your money, ethnicity, backround or education.
---
Doesn't mean all succesful people don't give much shit about others, but they are enabled and encouraged to do so, instead of having compassion and understanding.
---
They often blame poorer societies ( example: latinos) instead of just seeing how life really is for them

I'll just quote a guy a few comments away from you.

&gt; For what it is worth, Microsoft's [Xbox most played games chart](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/store/most-played/games/xbox) currently shows the game at position 36 in the USA, while it was 41st last week before patch 14, and 39th on October 9.
---
I... I c-can't.
---
I do have a good day. People like you ruin it slowly. People like you will make companies create a single player subscription in the future. Then I will have a bad day.
---
Yawn...
---
We are in a very difficult situation right now. I made the subscription right the moment they announced it while the servers were still in maintenance. But I was aware of all those things, as a adult father working in some business and who saw the world, should do. And still I purchased the subscription?
---
Clearly YES. I quit my wow classic sub end decided to play fakout76 again after I left in spring for division 2. Why I decided to join the sub? Ne need to tell anyone except my wife.
---
So. But to return to the difficult situation, I mentioned. I’m
---
Pretty sure they’d didn’t plan to start this sub in the beginning. But this game was obviously a flop and the reasons are so damn clear. That’s why I abandoned the game in the first place. If they wanna fund a service game with new content a year after release they need money. I guess, that’s the reason we get not much for a relatively expensive sub (Netflix is cheaper, GamePass is cheaper, WoW is cheaper... especially for the value you get in return).
---
This map is bigger than Fallout 4...
---
Personally I had fun by making hitler my character and then under mapping a Hitler bunker
---
The game is in such bad place you actually have to chase criticism out of the sub.
---
Q1 next year
---
Are you this weak and salty in real life or just about a game?
---
For the record, I do not have a 1st account. Not important but might prove that my interest is not self motivated.

What would you define as harassment? Perhaps our definitions are different, google says it is: aggressive pressure or intimidation. If the op found it intimidating or not I don't know but that was certainly the intention. 
---
In any case, I just think that pursuing the individual as apposed to the company is pretty shitty behaviour. Even if you can morally justify it, what good does it do? None. It just makes that person have a bad day. 
---
Zenimax or Bethesda or whoever is responsible for the decision it won't ever hear about it, and even if they did they wouldn't care. A far more productive statement would be uninstalling the game (as they watch those numbers). 
---
I think you are giving them too much credit. Nah, I don't buy the 'making a statement' argument, griefers just be griefers. It's like kids who yell racial slurs at people in the street, they don't really care about the persons ethnicity, they just get pleasure from a power trip and will justify it however they can. 
---
Don't hold these people as some sort of warriors for justice - they are just kids (or big kids) on a power trip at the expense of others.
---
I'd love to see max level enemies everywere i go. The reason i quit is because i got tired of farming only the bottom right part of the map for max level legendaries. I miss the left part of the map but at max level there is zero reason to go there.
---
Credit card kids belong on the private servers!
---
Your post being removed should tell you a lot... go find another game and enjoy it while being positive. 
---
Being negative literally gets you nowhere...
---
It is fair, otherwise you could get a couple of hundred magazines a day, but it is spawning maybe a little low.
---
With 16x the detail.
---
There's multiple gaming communities that are just as nice as Fallout 76's community. I'm sorry to say, but justifying a half-baked game led by a shitty company based on its wonderful community is a flawed mindset.
---
Awful games have been selling subscription services for over a decade, Fallout FuckYou1st isn't innovative, new or remotely close to being the pioneer of this practice.  
---
To think that just because Fallout 76 now has a subscription model, which some people consider awful, ,while others think its fair, will somehow ruin the entire gaming industry, with a practice that other game developers have committed to for over a decade, is completely delusional.  
---
You lot are only outraged because it is Fallout 76, and because both youtubers and gaming media at large cannot help themselves but to bust a fat one on ANY bad-related news regarding either Bethesda, or the Fallout IP. Taking a single look on youtube will show no less than an absolute gangbang by the so called gaming media, with them making upwards of 5+ videos over the course of 3 days!  
---
If you don't want to subscribe, then don't bloody do it. If you don't want to play Fallout 76, then spend your time better elsewhere.  
---
If you truly believe that a subscription model for Fallout 76 will somehow revolutionize gaming and make everything far worse, then I feel more sorry for you than I do anyone else.
---
Meanwhile you’re in a Fallout subreddit instead of a game you enjoy...lol
---
So may I just say... aww. Your wife... That just made my day. I imagine she was rather pleased with herself!
---
No one is upset people like the game, people are upset that bethesda is actively making a game they enjoy worse.
---
Go back in time and convince Bethesda not to launch fallout 1st.
---
Added - kateallica

I can help

---
I won’t go that far but it is certainly larger with more diversity.
---
lol thats what i wanted!  to overstock my comics shop!!
---
It's called boycotting and it only works if the majority of the playerbase participates...
---
Hey m8, i am available at that time.
---
Add Zspirnl and trhow me an inv when u ready :).
---
It just works
---
Awesome thanks! I’ll add you to the list and add you when I’m home from work :)
---
Thanks for can contributing the conversation
---
I like this analogy. So Bethesda keeps shipping bratwurst with bugs in it despite repeated complaints. Now, they are adding sawdust (Fallout 1st) and charging more because the brats are bigger.
---
I play with my 11 year old all the time.
---
Oh thank the lawd.... well for nownit is
---
GGEZ
---
Agree with the OP.  Simple concept really, not everything works for everybody, and not everyone agrees with everything. 
---
Everyone is entitled to their opinion, and to not be bashed just because their opinion is different than yours. 
---
I've given 1st a try, &amp; I haven't been on a "public" server since. I don't need to worry about some F'tard jumping in on an event &amp; one-shottting everything.... I roam freely without Griefers.
---
I come from work at 17:00 Peninsula time
---
Always! Lol - she figures if I play the game as much as I do, I NEED the subscription. I was going to wait it out to see what they would do after the backlash buttttttt looks like BGS is not budging sooooo...
---
Being negative fixed Star Wars Battlefront 2.
---
I like bratwurst.
---
Just had 1 for lunch, a Thürniger. Awesome! And I'll probably try out this one from Bethesda.
---
I can't see the actual numbers of players online on that site, and that is only one platform. I'll admit I find it surprising going upwards on any chart like that, but it doesn't necessarily mean more players (or very much more) and like I said, I'm assuming the trend is generally downwards, as in I'm sure there are much less players as there was 5 months ago.
---
Awesome dude I’ll add you to list and then add you on psn when I’m home from work! Ps I’m YourNansBowls on PS4 so you know it’s me :)
---
When you have to create a topic using an analogy comparing food with games trying to justify your means, well...things doesn't look great tho.
---
Do you get any robot followers of any kind? The map looks smaller than the fo4 map. Just looks physically smaller.
---
The game is shit
---
Do you think you made a point?
---
Except it won't work. What response has anyone got from BGS regarding this?
---
Nah, I don't think that was mans logic.... I also don't believe he is saying that "complaining" loud enough will fix the game.
---
I think... he is stating that life is too short to be CRAZY upset about this game/developer/studio, maybe even gaming in general as there are more games out now (and to come) that you may LOVE and never have to think about Fallout 76 again. Sure Bethesda pulled some overpriced, p2w bullshit here but I really have an issue with the thinking that if the "community" of this "dying game" we're to "rally" together that would completely stop this type of activity from ever happening again in a AAA game from any studio. It sounds like most everyone would be cool with everything but the price if Todd, Phil, Dick or whoever the fuck hadn't "lied" and just said from giddy st., that there will be non-cosmetic paid content.
---
A bratwurst is more like a d*ck though 🤔
---
They're dumb as fuck.
---
There are a few basic reasons for that;
---
* This Sub represents a very small fraction of the overall player base, at least half my in game friends have never looked at Reddit, and 90% have never posted anything.
---
* Players who gripe &amp; complain about things are much more likely to Post/Comment.
---
* And the biggest reason of all: **It's a great value for some cool stuff.**
---
Heh, or read Upton Sinclair's The Jungle if a person's REALLY feeling like a carnivore ;)
---
Is that time zone USA?
---
Lol it is awesome you are willing to pay for anything after all this fallout 1st BS. No wonder they freaking do this to the fan base.
---
We lost a lot of potential things that could have dropped instead of this bullshit. Soon enough players like you buying into said bullshit are going to make the choice for the rest of us. Developers will start putting mandatory paywalls in games because the research and marketing data from the past shows profit. Please don't be arrogant about falling for their bullshit it doesn't make you better than anyone else who plays this dogshit game.
---
When trolls trolling at forums where they don't like the topic but like to troll around means, well the troll is a dumbass
---
No it's Spain
---
Since you are starting up now, it might feel very empty since most players are higher level off doing other things.  Finding even just one other person to play with will make it feel very different. 
---
There are actually quite a number of quests, some of them are challenges.  Getting the camera to do the "bucket list" quest is quite fun, and once you unlock the quests for Bev and the Scouts you'll have some stuff to keep you busy.  
---
Take a look at the. map and go check out some players camps.  Look where there are players on the map (in an area you can handle) and go see what they are up too.
---
Yes.  My understanding is you keep the armor, ten, and scrap box
---
Not a private server, the things it offers, like the scrap box and tent.
---
eh, I like imagery, this one amused me
---
Oh okay my bad, when I googled it it came up with a USA time zone! No problem, just reply when you are ready thanks :)
---
I've been telling you all [this game is a scam](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNjI03CGkb4) and it would come to this for a long time. Yet, you choose to get played for fools instead of cutting your losses and moving on to something else.
---
Not really... matter of fact not at all... if it was so good you’d be playing it instead you’re here complaining about a game you won’t play...
---
Ok, Awesome thank you. Somebody was asking in the marketplace and I was wondering the same thing.
---
Ok :)
---
Allegedly...... i trust what Bethezda says these days, about as far as i could through a protectatron.
---
yes please, I'd like another battle with cancer, hold the mustard
---
The only way to have "free" private servers, is to let players host the server.  With all the legendaries on the server side that will never happen.  As for them being free, hosting a server costs much more than $100 just in electric costs, plus equipment. But mom and dad pay the electric bill....
---
You need it to get a big chunk of the content down the road and to have the experience the promised when they announced the game. One would want it to avoid the pain that is constantly grinding and dumping stuff to keep within weight limits. It feels like basically paying them to stop flicking us on the nose. I got the first month to see how different it is and it’s a total game changer. After this month that’s it though I’m not wealthy so I’ll be going back to DarkSouls3 to wait on Cyberpunk: 2077
---
Unlikely, but it sounds like mans has never played this game at all, lol.  It sounds like headline outrage. And I can see how that would happen if you only look at the news surrounding this game and not actually put any recent hours in to make your own decision.
---
If YOU react like a child, if YOU want to destroy what can be fun for others, then YOU are the problem. Period.
---
Let people be free of their own decisions.
---
1000 5.56 per hour?  Are you sure? I highly doubt that
---
Not only the Atomic Shop music but the unique player vendor music too, both well done. Hopefully that trend continues.
---
Yes, because I hate Bethesda's marketing and don't justify their cash grab activities makes me a fake fallout fan.
---
I'm still not sure why anyone would buy a multi-player game and then pay extra to play it solo.
---
&gt; I just think that pursuing the individual as opposed to the company is pretty shitty behaviour. Even if you can morally justify it, what good does it do? None. It just makes that person have a bad day.
---
This is the exact attitude that makes the video games industry so shitty. The 'what can one man do?' perception that personal decisions have no bearing on marketing because there are a legion of faceless wallet-warriors out there anyway.
---
&gt;Zenimax or Bethesda or whoever is responsible for the decision it won't ever hear about it, and even if they did they wouldn't care. A far more productive statement would be uninstalling the game (as they watch those numbers).
---
And that's exactly what they would prefer. Uninstall the game and go away. I bet Zeni/BGS can't believe their luck that they don't even have to employ anyone to do damage control or PR, the players will quite happily do it for them. It's the same song and dance every time, and yet every time some group of players think that this time is different, usually that 'it can't be like those other times because I didn't like those games and I do like this game'.
---
&gt;  I'll admit I find it surprising going upwards on any chart like that, but it doesn't necessarily mean more players 
---
Okay?
---
We must rise up and storm Bethesda headquarters.
---
 They can't stop us all!
---
Hmmm.... I'm not angry about the subscription pricing. It would be nice if you haters would stop talking for me through the term " US ". To be honest, you guys are a drag. You're saying that because we purchase these things we're " changing the way gaming companies do things ". That's horseshit. if you don't like the game .. go away.. go bitch about some other game. 
---
They don't need hater's money, they want people who like the game to play. We asked for private servers, they gave us private servers. Is it buggy? Yeah! Have they shown 100 % that they are constantly trying to fix the bugs? 
---
YES.
---
 And that's good enough for me. I'm not a hater, I play because if offers me a world to play in.  I could go anywhere else. I could play anything else I wanted to. But I enjoy this game. When they consistently show me they are dedicated to making it better, and offer new play ability, that makes me happy.
---
You .. don't make me happy. You .. depress me. 
---
So go away.
---
No, not at all... the OP loves the game... your comment has no relevance to his post or the subject... kinda trolling unless trolling was your point.
---
The last sentence really ties it together beautifully. Imagine getting paid generously by Microsoft for all the potential revenue this could generate for the studio, I think it's a perfect business move.
---
I am also still trying to figure out how camps work and the whole player interacting with your camp stuff. Like where tf  does my power armor go??
---
Doesn't excuse the lack of quality control that has always plagued Bethesda.
---
No companions yet. May come in wastelanders. And yea map is massive. Try walking from one end to the other and you’ll realize just how much bigger it is and variety in landscape. The 6 regions are all unique in what they offer.
---
The persuasion option works 100% of the time I believe
---
Amen brother
---
That's a good idea, and probably the route I would go, but I had heard it was possible to rip the audio files out of a PC game and wanted to see if anyone had already done it. I'm wanting to turn it into a ringtone for personal use. I thought a clean rip would sound better than youtube to mp3 conversion. Thanks!
---
If nobody bought the sub it would be a failure and a deterrent for future nonsense subs and "features". I don't know why the idiots who payed for this are acting so superior about the situation you are literally the reason Bethesda is going to keep pulling this shit
---
You don’t need to trust them. Wastelanders will still be free.
---
This should have the **Bug** flair. Lighting is clearly not intended to work this way.
---
The wrong flair and the obsequious tone of the request truly show how low some players expect of Bethesda to deliver, despite them being a triple-A publisher with an inside development team.
---
None of the above
---
Just let me kill other players and enemies
---
My seven year old will ask daily if I am at the resort and if it is safe.  Once i am inside i hand it over and let her rome around.  She has figured out how to purchase goods from the vendor bots.  She is now asking how to try the dresses on and if she could color my weapons.  I asked what color should they be?  She said rainbow dash colors.  Bethesda, can we?
---
Balanced is in the eye of the beholder in my opinion. I'm not in favor of a grey, flat, monotone world, game or real, where an iron boot of mediocrity is applied. I do not see significant game play advantage created with Fallout 1st. I do see significant convenience created for Fallout 1st subscribers. I think of it as the Mercedes Benz vs. KIA dynamic. Both brands will generally get you were you're going. One costs more and looks prettier.
---
Magazines have specific spawn points but just a chance to spawn at them. When you grab one you’ll have a cooldown for that specific spawn
---
Agree. And no, I don't care what other games have done. I don't care if other games have made people pay for private servers.  Fallout 76 and  Bethesda  and were on very thin ice and in no position to be charging money.  For anything.  But they did it anyway.  I haven't been playing the game.  No, I AM NOT  boycotting.   I just can't bring myself to log on after this.  It's like Bethesda has extinguished the few remaining flickers of fun that the game had left with this Fallout 1st crap.
---
We who pay = better server performance for you. Up your education level when it concerns client side server features. Please.
---
Have you considered making the switch to inert flux for all of your in-game refreshment needs? I frequently farm nuked flora just to restock my drinking supply since I had to get rid of my water purifier due to CAMP budget. 
---
I know it gives a couple of rads, but I think it's lighter than purified water and it has a small disease resistance buff. It is definitely lighter (and I think more refreshing) than boiled water. Please someone else correct me if I'm wrong!
---
Your base gives me anxiety, but in a funny way! Nice job! My hoarder has 30 display cases out with medical stuff, I couldn't imagine trying to get it all together but it would be fun!
---
Yes definitely more magazines in a standard world
---
Is this a bot service?
---
I'm more worried about them fixing the PvP bug and the trade glitch. I could care less about lighting
---
Yep. I've quit WoW and all Blizzard games due to the influences a foreign government has over the games I play, and Bethesda is going further down the path of darkness. 
---
Video games just disappoint me now.
---
YES!  DAMN STRAIGHT BROTHER!!! AMEN!
---
You are such a ray of sunshine my guy.
---
eh, I don't judge. Some like dick. Some don't.
---
Does it work with thru hiker? I just switched to crafting prime ammo, so I do end up with plenty inert.
---
I feel like this can just as easily be read as "You have to pay extra to enjoy yourself."
---
\&gt;  **What happened to this community?** 
---
Simple answer: Bethesda did change...
---
level up your agility as there’s a punch of perks for pistols. from there you’ll see which perks are good to use
---
&gt;First users make me feel bad about this game
---
Oh my god, you special little snowflake...
---
yet the haters drone on ..... and on .... and on .....
---
Let's assume the top ten games had player increases, while 33-35 had dramatic decreases in players and 76 at position 36 kept the same amount of players. It would still move forward a couple spaces on "most played" despite not having more players play the game. That is just one way a game could move up the list without having more players actually play the game.
---
What I find laughable is that Skyrim and Fallout 4 are both higher, and that is probably especially true on PC
---
I personally dealt with it by alt f4ing mid game and then uninstalling and getting a refund. Getting that refund was the main quest for me. As for the endgame content, bethesda just keeps fucking up and I keep running out of popcorn. 
---
I mean i literally laughed out loud when they announced the fallout 1st subscription and almost thought that maybe the game was better now. Woah dude. Enjoy this......thing. If you want the real fallout experience check out the outer worlds. Cheers mate
---
Your response sure shows that.
---
It is kind of ironical to use this as an example while demanding someone else's paid content to be made free. Unpopular opinion as it is, I say if the scrapbox was to be removed from the list of subscription exclusive features (I am neutral on the issue, but let us say "if"), then the right thing to do would be not giving it to anyone, rather than making it free. The stash limit has been a part of the game since the beginning anyway, and I personally find it a good thing that there is at least something that limits the ability of hoarders to pick everything clean (one of the most annoying aspects of the game is finding locations already cleared by someone else - this is less of a problem if all scrapbox owners also have a private world to farm).
---
OP you are just arguing semantics. I know P2W stand for Pay to "Win" but it's more "pay to gain an advantage over others". You might argue what  is the winning objective of the game since pvp in this game is neutered. Well since the game has no endgame then grinding scrap is the endgame. It's what people do at max mevel. They grind scrap and trade it with others. As a non-subscriber you can't compete in a competitive public server with someone who has acess to a private world with all the resources at his disposal. If you want to play the "but it's a singleplayer" card then you should ask yourself why the hell would you pay monthly subscriptions to a singleplayer. But it's not, thus Pay2Win.
---
abuse bloodied and stealth. it's not cowboy-ish, but you'll need both with pistols.
---
So you play like the rest of us .... and if you want the private server, stop going out to eat ONE NIGHT A MONTH DUDE. Holy sh\*t ... really?
---
Unreal.
---
I consider them neutral. Especially in contrast to obviously good guys Responders. Their only interest is their own survival. Not bad guys, just self serving.
---
I also from Brazil. I played this game in a free trial a few months ago and had a blast. Really wanted to play more but it's sooooooo expensive. ):
---
We need a better term than pay to win for a game you don't really win at, but I can see your point. However, I'd say the people that are willing to pay $8.33 to $12.99/month for it are people who would likely have builds that one-shot most mobs already. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
---
Hopefully it will be a good thing long term to provide enough of a stable revenue stream that they can pull a Bungie and get out from under their investors (Zenimax in this case).
---
Another hater post who just wants to hate.
---
The emptiness is honestly what I liked about it, it’s the first fallout game when I played through it that really made me feel like a lone wanderer
---
One can disagree with the fallout first bit (I do!) and while Bethesda is pretty brazen with their sweet little marketing decisions they probably aren't stupid and have done their research on what style of monetization works best for them.
---
You can’t, but you get to move it for free.

No a serious note. I think it's time I stopped keeping up with fallout 76. Looking at people being totally ok with everything that's happening is just too much for me. I keep with the reddit for patch notes and everything but never subbed because of naive idiots. I am a Bethesda fanboy to the core but i am no idiot.
---
Or them ....
---
Nerfed
---
I paid 200$ for that terrible collectors edition with the helmet and plastic bag (which was replaced by the cheap cloth version after lawsuits via the community).    Now they want me to pay for a monthly subscription to further support a game which needs to many more features and work to be done?    No thanks.   Downloading mods, having a private server, etc, should not be subscription fee.
---
AMEN!
---
The sub-Reddit has always been a vocal minority that isn't necessarily representative of the everyday person playing the game. Youtubers and game journalists also signal boost whatever's going on here as representative of the game as a whole which doesn't help.
---
It seems like you get your knowledge of economics from sensationalized youtube videos.  
---
Games are NOT the cheapest and easiest to produce right now, is that a joke?  You think Fallout 76 was cheaper to produce than sonic the hedgehog 3?  Than Tomb Raider 2?  Than even Uncharted?  Not sure why you think games are so cheap to make now , they 100% are not.    
---
Other than that, you just seem like an anti-capitalist whos trying to sound like Jim Sterling.  Game companies make a lot of money, thats true... I guess you just have more of a problem with making money than I do.  That doesnt change the fact that game prices have remained the same for a looooong time.  Developers like Sony can afford to invest in robust single player games without microtransactions because they get a kickback for everything sold on PSN; same basic business model but with extra steps and less shady IMO.    
---
And the best part is: if you dont want to spend money on something, don't!  Fuck me, am I right?
---
what do you mean? I don't care obviously 😂
---
Definitely a stress reliever, Fallout 1st has been.
---
Ok, I thought they were a guaranteed spawn. Can players going past make them spawn?  Is that why I find more in the standard servers? More people go past, more spawn?
---
No, unlimited crafting storage was never promised as a feature of the game.
---
They do. Just not the numbers AAA Co would expect.
---
Performance is typically OK, with the exception of nukes.  I got to where I expected server issues if a nuke dropped.  Not sure if it's effects or just the surge of people arriving/exiting that does it.  Beyond that moat of the griefers wandered off and your probably not going to have many issues with the community.
---
AMEN BRO!
---
Why can't these assholes shut up?
---
guys how do I reactivate my blizzard account? my anti blizzard memes aren't getting upvotes and gold anymore.
---
You think other people have to live by the weird false dichotomies you set up in your head?
---
Having taken a couple of days to take a deep breath and looked at First more objectively, I agree with most of what you just said. But:
---
Bethesda probably doesn't give two hoots what opinion I post here. Why would they? My literal voice means nothing, whether I whine or not. What means something to them is my wallet. Prices fall when no one buys. THAT is economics. That's why there was such a great deal on this game so soon after launch.
---
I also can't help noticing that you called OP out for speaking for everyone... and then did it yourself. Perhaps some of the people complaining would take the moral high ground and keep complaining if they get a free subscription, but I imagine a fair number of people would shut up and take it.
---
Probably not intended but you can "reset" a private server. Log in, collect your stuff, kill the things. Log out for 5 mins (as in close the entire client) or so, and you'll get a different instance. Pure conjecture here, but it looks like they are recycling the oldest unused instance to the next Fallout First subscriber in queue so most of the time it should be damn near new, but YMMV.
---
I already unsubscribed. Getting downvotemobbed.
---
Ok, comrade. (I'm referring to the fact that it was first published in a socialist newspaper).
---
So instead of appreciating a player with a positive experience who enjoys the game and YOU actually having a positive experience with a game you like you decide to trash it and his experience... that’s toxic... find something you like. If you don’t like the game leave it entirely... too easy...
---
Do you think overwhelming praise is what caused the devs to redesign Battlefront 2?
---
Ok. Follow me for one second. You insulted the intelligence of the person you were speaking to and questioned their education. The fact is you know nothing about them. You are a whiny bitch. It’s fact.
---
Your not going to get private server based game without extra cash.  They would have to go client hosted instances for that to happen.
---
&gt; Then explain it. OP is not wrong. 
---
Actually the OP is very wrong.
---
They're presenting a series of false equivalences &amp; logical fallacies to justify their bias in favour of pay2win time saving conveniences.
---
Paying full price for a game at launch isn't paying a premium to have played it for longer. That would imply the person who had purchased it later didn't have the opportunity to pay for it at the same time as the person who paid full price. It's self-evidently false. The person who preordered the game to play on day 1 vs the person who paid a few weeks later before the price dropped both paid the same price but the person who preordered has a time advantage. The time advantage isn't built into the price. It's just a function of when you purchased the game.
---
Conclusion: The whole "paying a premium" argument is laughably false.
---
Players who purchased multiple accounts literally paid2win. I don't condone it or think it's fair and it's nigh on impossible to police. Having said that though, just because this happens, that doesn't justify the anti-consumer practices of pay2win things added in explicitly by the dev. It's a notion called the fallacy of relative privation. Just because one thing is bad, comparing it to something as bad or worse doesn't change how bad the first thing is.
---
Conclusion: Purchasing multiple accounts is pay2win but it doesn't make Fallout 1st suddenly justifiable. 
---
Finally, if one person spends more time and effort playing the game than another, it is perfectly reasonable to expect that person to be both more experienced, better equipped and better at the game than the person who puts in considerably less time. The OP agrees but they use this as a justification for pay2win time saving mechanics. 
---
Which of these two seems more reasonable and ethical:
---
1. The more time and effort you put into the game, the stronger and better you should be in-game, or
---
2. The more you pay, the greater your advantage
---
Conclusion: Just because you may not have as much time to put into the game to compete, it doesn't justify paying your way to the top.
---
There is no scenario where paying for an advantage is ever fair and reasonable.
---
That clear enough for you?
---
You're right on the nose OP, and it's depressing how people are just unable to see the patterns (even in this thread).
---
I get it, its your money, you spend it how you want; I don't necessarily care what you spend your money on. But frankly, you spending that money affects the entire gaming industry as a whole, and we've seen it countless times. Shockingly, there was a time not to long ago where it was insane to have to pay for "JuSt CosMeTIc SkInS". Lootboxes were considered insane, MTX was insane, but it all became standardized because some dickheads can't fathom when they're killing the industry they are a part of. 
---
For the people who purchase lootboxes, skins, MTX, give money to Blizzard/Activision, or have purchased a Fallout 76 sub:
---
I legitimately think of you as sub human, a cancer in the industry that is to brainless to understand that you have participated in killing every little scrap of good in the industry. Fuck your stupid money idiot.
---
Not sure if sarcastic or genuinely so dense and obtuse so as to fail comprehending the point of all this.
---
Right now, we're all getting bombarded with downvotes for being suspicious of this little "story". Fucking brains 100 in these people, man.
---
No because you claim Fallout games are indistinguishable and you can just swap one for the other. This is not Fifa, each game is its own. Why would playing FO4 make one happy if they want to play FO76?
---
You can get a robot at your camp for 600ish atoms(i wouldnt buy ut just save atoms) suposidly youll get NPC at camp in the dlc.
---
&gt;private worlds being for free is just unrealistic.
---
Not when your game and your company are on thin ice like Bethesda.  If it's no realistic then maybe they should not have offered it. This game is in no position to be asking for money. Period.  They have already pushed the generosity and goodwill of their fans far beyond any reasonable limits.
---
You wanna talk about unrealistic? I'll tell you what's unrealistic:  Fallout 76 asking for money is unrealistic.
---
Here have a meaningless + point for pointing out the premise of pointless points!
---
Just like fallout1st. Which you like.
---
The subscription for ESO has been the same price the whole time, and was always there. So... you're just wrong. Sorry not sorry.
---
I hope they just removed the hook from the one handed category.
---
So anyone wanting more of a game they enjoy is bad even though they work and earn money to buy something they want, since their opinion is different you feel the need to trash it all... how mature... 
---
Find a game you like and enjoy instead of one that triggers you.
---
This guy should be free to play how he wants just as others are free to perpetuate Bethezdas bullshit by paying to win.
---
Sometimes I just like killing guards, especially in the Rift. Mostly because I just don't belong there
---
Water has a “water” percent on it that you can see in your Pip-Boy aid tab. Purified Water shows as 25% on my tab (not using perks) and that’s what I’ve always seen. So it should have always taken 4 Purified Waters to go from empty to full, no?
---
Right? I don't see have as much whining on subs for other games doing the same thing. The game is there to make money so they can pay their employees and keep the game running. That's not free. 
---
Don't like the subscription, don't buy it. Those who like the game and can afford to, will. You shouting at them on Reddit that they can't do so for X or Y reason will not change their minds.
---
It is not. That does not change the fact that new content cost money. New voice acting, new modeling, new animations, more servers, cost a metric butt ton of money. They we'rent getting a dime pass the $30 I paid upfront  so I have wondered at times how they were going to keep this alive. Here we are. The lack of communication with the community is the biggest issue here, I think.
---
I'm not saying they are the same game on their own, but with Bethesda's fo1st, fo76 loses some of it's charm as a unique game.
---
They've owned minecraft for absolutely ages lmao
---
This 100%. Make like 5, sell them in a bundle for 400 atoms, profit.
---
Tried this several times, they're still all dead.
---
Never said otherwise. I find it fairly ironic however that you say that, considering you're also the one to have told people to "learn to do the same". Learn to do what exactly? Lower our standards and ignore Bethesda's recklessly idiotic and anti-consumer schemes without even flinching? Well some of us DO have some resemblance of standards and above all, dignity as a consumer.
---
Incorrect. It’s critiquing the *approach*. 
---
Being upset over the Fallout First membership program is **perfectly acceptable**. It’s a shift from what had been strongly implied by Howard &amp; Hines in the past. 
---
Attacking a fellow player over how they chose to spend their money is *not* acceptable. If they want to engage in a discussion and ask ‘Why did you buy the membership’’, that’s one thing.
---
But claiming they are betraying anyone in the community?  Outrageous. 
---
None of us have a right to dictate how someone else spends their money. 
---
My point stands; since they can’t get a reaction out of Howard &amp; Hines et al, they attack a fellow player. 
---
That’s displaced aggression, pure and simple.
---
Hmm I wonder what happens if you just block absolutely everyone!
---
&gt; What I find laughable is that Skyrim and Fallout 4 are both higher, and that is probably especially true on PC 
---
What I find laughable tho is that whatever proof is brought to you people's attention, you always seem to find find the worst side on the matter. It's obvious that games that were much better published and have been around for much longer would be on top.
---
What I find promising is that FO76 is still on top of Warframe, and anything that tops Warframe can be easily safe.
---
Hundreds of games out there and this one you don’t connect with... ok... go find another that you like and connect with and realize that people enjoying this game love it... 
---
Stop being the jelly ex... move on... let go... find another game to make you happy... but here you are...
---
Yeah I noticed yesterday that these are in the camp build list. And they are listed as plan not atom items!
---
Freestates because Freestates
---
  An unstated task while roaming the wastes is find and listen to all the holotapes, read terminal entries, and read the handwritten notes you find.  Combining all those will give you the story on what happened.
---
Following the overseers quest line will give you part ot it.  The other tapes you find laying around, along with entries on various terminals will fill in the blanks.
---
You likely won't find tapes/notes/terminals in any logical order, so some things will not make much sense for a good while.
---
The enclave, because well... THEY'RE AMERICA XD
---
No but really the satellite (Kovac Murdok) can easily be detected from all the USA so maybe the petrochemical plant Mariposa maybe contacts with MODUS on west virginia through Kovac Murdok.
---
Only if no-one purchased fallout 1st. But people started folding like a bad poker hand the moment it was released.
---
Re Ball Pits....I can see the framerate drop now as i cast my eye to your camp it i'm trying to render 1000's of spheres :O :O
---
With weapon artisan it repairs to 150%. You cant repair it until its below 100%
---
Can't believe post like this still exist in this game. Let it die already
---
I have a sneaky suspicion we'll see the Free States again.
---
What a nice break from the other posts about fallout 1st
---
You can't make a game without microtransactions, subscriction, pay to win and release it at a very buggy state, if you think so, your mind must be Out(er) of this world(s).
---
Hippity hoppity, 
---
Imma seize that private property!
---
I would love to see the Enclave make a comeback, maybe tie them into Raven Rock and D.C.
---
The timing of it suggests that the plan was to announce Fallout1st along with Wastelanders, or just after it, but when Wastelanders was delayed the higher-ups refused to deviate any further from their timetable. It’s the only scenario that makes sense to me.
---
I am loving the lore so far. Lots of info and a lot more to learn about which is something I love about the fallout games.
---
&gt;Well some of us DO have some resemblance of standards and above all, dignity as a consumer.
---
Which doesn't necessarily need to be enforced on the rest of us. You do you, but all the "people who bought Fallout1st are dumb" posts around here belong to a very different opinion.
---
I’m actually kinda surprised that there isn’t another game haters choose to play and have a fun positive experience... instead they aren’t and being negative about a game many say they uninstalled.... go figure...
---
I know that you already have 2 people, but if you need one more pm me and I'll give you my psn.
---
And you can pm me even if you don't need me. I'm interested in your factory now. ;)
---
Not empty, but the warning that it is low, so 3 made sense. I should check next time I get low where the warning happens
---
Or, you could have your bullshit psychoanalysis for yourself and allow others to have differing opinions.
---
I want FO76 to do better. Why is that a problem?
---
That would be awesome, I saw the robot thing for gathering supplies. One of the reasons I actually built my settlements in 4 was because of the settlers so the whole building is less important to me rn.
---
I hope rose doesn't get much of a gang. She looks cool and all, but man her quests dragged on for me.
---
Reminds me of when I was once playing and believe it or not Barack Obama was teaching Michelle Obama how to play the game. I was floored, I couldn't believe I would be roaming the wasteland with Mr. 44 and wife (that was their gamertags on the microsoft playstation4)
---
Three years on two separate accounts? That's like $360 US right there for Gold alone!
---
What if it is literal and the subscribers get some stuff first, before it rolls out to the community at large? Bugs can be worked out with a smaller sample size. For example the scrap disappearing from the scrap boxes. Small group that they could compare what happened between players and fix it. Had they released it to everyone it would have been disastrous.
---
Wait...a company out to not only make games people want to play but to also make money as well?!?! Please tell me its not so!
---
/sarcasm
---
Real talk, I dont understand why people think a company shouldnt exist to make money. If there is no money to be had there will be no games....that means any game.
---
Awesome dude, well if I need an extra person I’ll let you know, but just keep and eye out on this post of the Fo76 subreddit later, I will for sure post the factory for everyone to see once I am done 😁
---
A few people have come across the factory in game and had a personalised tour cause I just so happened to be at my camp, there reaction was priceless so I’m excited to see what other people think!
---
Im sorry this game's business model is not going how you envisioned.  But I dont think we should be blaming the users.  People are just trying to enjoy their game, lets not shame those who use the service.
---
Go back to being a shitty drummer
---
Why is Warframe your metric? That is much more niche than Bethesda titles. The level of complexity in min/maxing and lore on that game is pretty freaking high, plus the gameplay has an acquired taste. Along with that the universe is so alien compared to other sci-fi universes that it can be off-putting to people. It doesn't have the right ingredients to have a very casual audience, while 76 certainly does.
---
Yeah they didn't feel very..Raidery. But guess without npcs to rob and murder it's hard to do.
---
Yeh I think they could learn something from No Man Sky tbh :x
---
Exactly. If you ever buy atoms, it's a no-brainer based on that alone.
---
And outrage tears from this sub is why I bought the fridge. I put it right next to my vendors that first week with a sign next to it that read "tear storage". Had one guy give it a thumbs down and try and initiate PvP with me.
---
Wait, someone said that other are envious because they didn't get Fallout First?
---
...HAHAHAHAHAHHA
---
People like you are the reason sensible gamers have to put up with these regular assfucks from gaming companies. A fool and his money are soon parted, did you know you can get the lifetime unlimited scrap perk OP? Just buy fallout 1st subscription 100 times and you can enjoy new depths of this game while Bethesda enjoys new depths of your asshole for the rest of your miserable life. You idiots giving them money for this and Bethesda truly deserve each other.
---
Around $226 mxn for a month and $1884 mxn for a year, the currency exchange in Mexico is very bad
---
Yes I can.
---
I'm not sure if I understood you well, means do you want to know if it works (without going to the heart of the swamp event before) ? Well I did it several times. Out of 6 tries, 2 were successful.
---
If that were the issue then dlc should not be free. I think you are wrong.
---
If they have fixed the meat hook.. can anyone confirm if the other weapons that fit into multiple categories have been to? Pipe revolver, pipe bolt etc..
---
Really? I guess I never noticed this. Well he can still unequip perk, get it down to 99% and repair
---
Yeah but to make a fair comparison one would have to take the average income into consideration.   In countries with lower income the price "feels" much higher than in the countries with stable economy.   It's much easier to justify one time "investment" of say $100, than paying even $8.33(3) per month, cause it has much more value here (Poland) compared to say US. 
---

---
Now new in the Atomic Store - WaterPacks (tm)...  but on a serious note - haven't noticed it tbh :x
---
Are you joking? Indefinitely. They get hundreds of thousands of sales monthly thanks to the fact that they allow users to download the server client and play on their own modified servers.
---
Bethesda is infinitely fucking stupid - they completely fail to understand that if they allowed us to:
---
1) run servers on our hardware
---
2) modify the servers however we please
---
3) have a list of custom servers somewhere in the menu
---
They'd be swimming in dough. People would buy the game by the dozens if it meant they could create their own mods and run them on the servers.
---
That's the source of Oblivion's and Skyrim's longevity - ability to mod (same with Minecraft).
---
Once Bethesda realises that - they'll be on a road to recovery.
---
-OBSIDIAN LOGO-
---
Owl_No is my psn  
---
i have no friends but got the subscription too
---
The scrap box should not be paid content. That is a simple basic game feature that can logistically be made for all players behind a paywall. That sucks. Imagine how ridiculous it would be paying extra for unlimited workshop stash in fallout 4 because this is the exact same thing. Unlimited stash is available to all players without harming the server. They figured out how to do it and instead of implementing it into the game they made it where you have to pay for it and keeping the old system as a default. 
---
Hey, you want to manage your inventory cool, you can do that under unlimited junk stash. But all players should have this option. Compensate the ones who have paid with another cosmetic feature.
---
I saw the tent for the first time after we took down the Queen. Same experience.
---
Will be replying/adding you all after work and will let you know when the server is set up, fuck it I have it for a single month, may as well let the community have some fun at my expense just to see what it is like.
---
He's got a ray of sunshine, and a pocketful of dreams/money.
---
It's a feeling thing, so I could be imagining it, but nice to talk about fallout again.
---
So you assume a lot don’t you? 
---
You can have any opinions you want! However it’s you that can’t accept people having different opinions about the game and enjoy it. 
---
Sorry but just like all the other issues with the collectron and fridge which most camps I see have one or both... I’m literally seeing scrap boxes in huge numbers across the wasteland... 
---
Apparently a lot of players opted in and like it... so instead of trashing it maybe offer a few possibles solutions or like I said... find a game you like and can get behind.
---
Depends on your point of view. Being able to play 100% alone like all the other Fallout's is worth it to some. Add to that the unlimited junk, extra camp, and monthly Atoms equal to the price and to some it's not a bad deal. Personally for me, being multi player made 76 less fun, now that I'm alone, really playing it out, it feels like a whole new game and it's fantastic.
---
The game is good but I don't get why people consider it a direct competitor to FO76. It's a single player game with a comparitively short main quest and some side quests. It's not really open world, it's map based, and the maps are quite small for modern games. 
---
It's well made, though. I went through my first playthrough and didn't encounter a single game breaking bug. (got stuck in a sound loop once, but reload took care of it). It feels polsihed and finished. It has good replay value. However it feels about a quarter of the size of New Vegas. 
---
Honestly, the game feels more like "Firefly: The Video Game" than it does a competitor to Fallout. There's even some direct Firefly references in it.
---
A shame that stuff like this happens, then Bethesda fucks the game over
---
It is bad, but it wouldn't have been as bad if it was $10. It shouldn't cost more than Xbox Live or PS Plus and it certainly shouldn't have cost more than Xbox Game Pass and that's really where they fucked up especially since the outer world's launched literally 2 days after Fallout First did. So people were getting a whole new game in the same genre and with more content for cheaper.
---
Bethesda also should have waited until at least Wastelanders was out before asking for a subscription. We haven't gotten shit for content this past year besides a couple events and NW which is all but dead. So asking for a subscription just after the delay of the only real content this game would have gotten was an extremely bad move.
---
Is the last mask a damn Deathclaw??
---
So make the new content DLC and charge money for that. Like every other game company does.
---
You can't defend this crap.
---
someone looking for a Christmas date it seems :)   
---
Keep it real player ;p
---
I’ll join iStarvin Marvin
---
Because there a literally full blown mods that turn fallout 4 into single player 76. From the legendary item system, and the entire map from fo76 into fo4:
---
https://kotaku.com/meet-the-modder-painstakingly-rebuilding-fallout-76-in-1834930738
---
A hybrid of two combined... like actual history of large groups breaking down and changing.
---
Finally, someone mentions Fallout 1st!
---
Private servers were one of the things requested by players for a long time, blocking that off behind a pay wall will never be acceptable no matter the price.
---
I'll test it tonight - go from empty to max and see how much it takes :)
---
'K Todd' sounds like a wanna be rap artist
---
Yes, it is!
---
Yeah I really liked the way it was originally, made night far more ominous
---
Boring!!!!!
---
It’s value vs cost . It isn’t worth 100$ a year or 13$ a month. It’s worthless , it should be free. Publishers cannibalizing there products only further reduce fan base. I put fallout down for now. Not worth My time at this point.
---
Op: I dont like the game and wont be playing any more.
---
 Comments : Okay bye.
---
Op: omg why are you all shaming me for wanting a better game.
---
It's pretty misleading to only include guns, armors, levels in a pay to win scenario when more than those mechanics go into making Fallout the game that it is. More stash allows for more repairing of weapons. More space to sell items in shop. All of this leads to a gameplay adavantage or "win"
---
they’re not charging a fee for the game. they are charging for exclusivity. 
---
the purchase is not required, it is entirely elective.
---

---
WHY
---
What the fuck are you talking about?
---
The entire message of your post is to berate those that choose to spend their money on this service. Your entire fucking message is literally shaming those that choose to spend on this service. 
---
You have every right in the world to express your opinion on what you feel is right and wrong. And no one can tell you what to spend your money on. 
---
But you telling everyone to “stop supporting this service” because they’re “killing video games” is absurd. 
---
This is an **optional** service in a looter/shooter that has zero endgame and entirely optional PvP. What another player’s gear, costume, and stash looks like has legitimately **zero** impact on your game experience. 
---
Black Desert is one of the most popular mmos on the market and it has a **blatant** Pay to win cash shop that gives inherent advantages in a game where PvP is not consensual and can’t just be flipped off. 
---
Bethesda isn’t Doing anything criminal. Do I think it’s shitty of them to lock some features behind a paywall? Yeah. Of course I do. I’m damn sure not shelling out my hard earned money for that. I’m still pissed they wrecked survival mode. 
---
But telling people they need to “stop destroying video games” because they’re buying this service is like telling people to “stop hating gays” because they bought a chicken sandwich at Chick-Fil-A. 
---
Some people just want a fucking chicken sandwich.
---
Hahaha that's amazing! Thank you for this post. Amazing shots. Now if flying from Australia didn't cost so much I'd love to visit WV. Looking forward to the other posts in this series.
---
Didn’t know I could milk the Brahmin lol always just killed them for the meat. Good stuff!
---
yup :)
---
  Its almost all in tapes and notes.  Oh, adn there are some rather interesting drawings around, too.  
---
  The bots you run across may throw a random word or phrase about some aspect of the lore and other factions, but unless you've found the holos/notes, it just leaves you asked what's that?
---
A possible solution is for the devs to admit that they lied about pay to win and to advertise the game for what it is, pay to win. Or to refind and remove it.
---
But according to you, the only worthwhile input to any game is positive dick riding
---
Yeah, that's what I meant. Back then when people saying that Heart of the Swamp made Strangler Blooms appear I tested a bunch of times. Joined a server on Crevasse, checked if only Strangler PODS were there, did stuff until the event triggered.
---
0 out of 3 times the Strangler Blooms appeared.
---
Thank you! :)
---
We on the same brainwave brutha 👊😎
---
Wait wait..,, you don’t even play the game?
---
Leave these eventually homeless people to the trash fire they helped build.
---
Go play Outer Worlds or even some of Beth's older games. You'll be reminded as to why you ended up here in the first place.
---
&gt;New voice acting, new modeling, new animations, more servers, ~~cost a metric butt ton of money~~  is free because we've gotten free dlc.
---
Is this where I am wrong? 
---
&gt; The lack of communication with the community is the biggest issue here, I think. 
---
This is still the largest point of my post. Had this been communicated in just about any other way, the UPSET portion of the community wouldn't be so up in arms.
---
Some people just like this shit no matter what cause it is still fun to them, and more power to 'em
---
Ok then, answer me this. What, in ideal scenario do you think that their actions would accomplish. Say you scale it up and everyone who bought 1st was treated the same way. What would be the outcome?
---
So all the first subscribers leave the game. Then what, who is left. You could argue that less people willing to spend money on the game (might be good or bad, you'd probably say good - something like people who care about the game etc. ignoring the fact that, it's pretty unlikely that the servers will be kept running and development ongoing if it's not profitable enough for the shareholders - no matter what was promised at the start) fine,we'll leave that there. 
---
What if everyone with a scrap bot or fridge was targeted or whatever the next bad decision zeni/bsg make. 
---
Zenimax and Bethesda have really made a mess of this and I'm not a fan of their actions or attitude, but you know what is worse. A toxic community. It's not just this game, and in fact this game was one of the very very few with, for whatever reason, had nice people in it. To my mind even if these actions did have the desired effect , and in some unicorn based universe they reversed it all, I'm not sure the game would be the place it is today. Perhaps that it's more fitting for a post-apocalypse game... But I'm not sure I'd play it.
---
I'm not attacking the argument that this is bad for the game or industry as a whole, I'm attacking the methods. Uninstalling would be one option but you don't seem to agree with that but how about something else? In-fighting is not the answer. Making individuals feel bad is not the answer. My attitude is not what you think it is - I just don't agree that targeting individuals is effective or morally justifed.
---
Wrong sub
---
And it is one of the most healthy and commonly praised MMORPG with a solid playerbase. And FO76 can top that playerbase, so it can pretty much survive as long as Warframe does.
---
A big thing is probably workshops.  On a private instance you can farm events and resources from them, coupled with scrap stash I can see it streamlining farming nicely.
---
This is the big resin I keep looming at fo1st.  Grab some workshops so would have a steady trickle of level appropriate events while I'm  chilling out.
---
I always had the 'darker nights' mod installed for Fallout 4 for the same reason. I get that it's a design choice, but walking around at night would be more foreboding if it actually effected visibility a little bit.
---
You wouldn't want to know how much it costs in Brazil it would make you cry or laugh.
---
except they told us from the get go that the private servers were going to be charged for.  
---

I think it's been about a month and a half since I've had a disconnect on the XBox, and never on my PC, but then again, I have a higher end laptop that more than meets the preferred specs.  I'm tempted to install on one of my weaker laptops to see what I experience there.
---
Just a question. But thanks
---
Hey we got outer worlds :)
---
im hoping for this as well, afaik both abby and the rover person are MIA
---
Don’t know for sure, but people enter the server and time might be a trigger. The most efficent way is to swap server when farming. You have all spots you know, you check them, grab what you want and need and swap server for checking the rest. And  then repeat
---
I figure it's more to do with fees on the private inatance.  Cloud servers to host with aren't free.
---
DLC was promised to be free though, and I think given that it had already been delayed and a lot of players are hinging their hopes on it, it would have been far worse to renege on that.
---
Shared worlds becoming more toxic and griefy (like they often already are in other online games) may ironically make the subscription more attractive.
---
The idea that it’s “just a game” makes no sense given what he said. The issue is the rampant monetization of games making the industry shit. EA games, Blizzard, Bethesda, numerous other companies would rather foresake the quality of their games and charge for basic content. That shows an overall decline for the industry. 
---
Saying “it’s just a game” means any hobby of anyone’s that gets ruined is just something people should get over. Don’t think you’d agree when further reasonable nuance is applied.
---
So you're one of the kids who shoots up schools because they were turned down for prom aren't you?
---
yeah the fridge, tent and Collectron should've been in game quest rewards (from tadpole badges, like food prep, survival, robotics) which would've created grind, and sell skins/remodels. (enclave tent being all high tech, a punk rock raider collectron, a super mutant meatbag fridge, etc)
---
If you don't like reading it then go somewhere else. It's not that we hate the game. It's that we hate the way Bethesda is handling it. We bitch because we care about what happens to the game. They took our suggestions and charged us money for adding them in. There's a difference between hate and being pissed off and disappointed.
---
I know. That question is against sub rules..
---
LOL
---
wavy willards would be a good place to take her when the weather is nice! valley galleria although there will be high lvl scorched inside &amp; outside.  the amusement parks. both are in relatively low level locations. there's a bunch of daily challenges in camden down near the ash heap. a hot dog eating contest, a dross toss contest and several others.
---
I’m tired of these posts. People are allowed to hate. It comes from a place of love for Bethesda and fallout. Don’t take it personally. Just because people are expressing their hate doesn’t mean it effects your love for it. If you love it then go ahead and post your positive posts but understand people will post their negative posts too. Freedom of expression is something you’re going to have to deal with. So shut the fuvk up.
---
I wouldnt suggest trying to let people in the fallout subreddit know you got first, any form of enjoying fallout 76 or first will get you downvoted into the deepest darkest pits of hell
---
I agree with this fully. They noised up the communication behind this roll out.
---
So you are saying bethesda should use shady business to make up for having a free DLC policy? That's really stupid. They made enough selling a 20$ rehash of Fallout 4 as 76 for 60$, that's where the extra cadh came in to say "Free DLC" if they didn't utilize the atom shop well enough to make the sweet MTX money that's not the communities fault.   Try adding colour spectrums to gear and you'd likely sell cosmetics vs camo35.  
---
To take your analogy it's like Avengers came out and they said "Every next movie is free!" Because the ticket was  60$" then made a subscription. In the future to see moviea with the "true" ending. Or to not have Other languagea cut in and out. Or to see the move not muted. Or to be granted subtitles.    Seems bs to me.
---
In what way has Bethesda shown that they even care about your existence in any way? To them you are nothing more than the most eager pay piggies that fo first was made for. 
---
Your job is to supplement their studio until their next game on their janky ass engine. A game that will come out just as broken and monitized  as this one. 
---
Beta test their games and feel a sense of pride and accomplishment when they spit in your face like this.
---
How do I get the tent cant seem to find it
---
It's cute that you think the your representation of me is contradictory.
---
It's also cute that you are gaslighting me about the responses that people are giving.
---
Ok
---
I beleive they are brother and sister. Would be a great dynamic to have them return and rebuild the Free States!
---
I dont know, that seems a very generic thing to say.
---
&gt;if you're good at something
---
if you block a user then your camp disappears for them.
---
the mod would likely violate ToS and my guess is it would be due to some form of batch processing that would be perceived as suspicious. it would make sense that Bethesda would not want people blocking players en masse because that would quickly become a large series of verifications upon player login. but i am purely speculating here.

---
Careful, the self appointed kings and queens of reddit might have a go on your rating!
---
This is consistent with my observations too.  As someone trying to specialize in pistols, every point of Agility is important.  Having already used Shrouded Wood Armor with some Become Harder to Detect perks, I wanted to see if Sneak still made much of a difference.
---
It didn't.  So that was 3 whole points to allocate to something else.
---
Lol right
---
NW will never be a replacement for Survival Mode. It's a completely different style of PVP. Imagine if they made a Raid only mode and removed adventure mode, you'd probably stop playing. 
---
It's crazy that people here celebrate the removal of survival mode, like they wanted less game modes out there to choose from. Even if it wasn't your cup of tea it lead to more diversity in gameplay.
---
The stash box and the tent at least should have been free or at the very least 700 atoms like the scrap bot and fridge. Paying $13 and up a month for what we got is not worth the price.
---
You’ve never even experienced actual hate have you? It’s a great feeling, a human feeling. Try it out
---
Are you seriously trying to compare ESO to fo76? There is more content in one of ESO's expansions than all of fo76.
---
Agreed.  But let's give "honorable mention" to the thousands (within the loyal FO76 community) who cheated, duplicated key God level items and then sold them, piece by piece for over 25K caps; forcing other users to have to either be wiped off the map with one shot kills, or submit to purchasing those forbidden items themselves, just so they can have any chance of occupying a workbench.
---
It seems to be a rare so, maybe I was lucky with the two occasions where I was able to find the blooms. With green thumb, chemist and super duper I got 30 radshields so I haven't tried it since.
---
Go vote for a socialist leader, then.
---
"The best thing about these private servers is they're so much more stable!"
---
This fucking quote kills me. Why would they ever fix the stability of a public server when so many people are willing to pay monthly for one that runs well? Get used to the servers crashing. As if you haven't already.
---
Reeee they’re griefing my karmaaaa....
---
Well that's good, I don't deny people will find uses for it, I gave my point of view on it because I was intrigued on people's counterargument and that's what I got.
---
in order to make sure it's extra circle-jerky and BSG never ever sees any of it?
---
Well Einstein, ARE your "friends" still there?
---
I’m actually envious ...... it’s not cheap.  100 quid is not cheap.  I like anything that puts money into the development cycle of this game.  Obviously very problematic, but at least the game isn’t dead.  Me want FO First.
---
What a sad person you must be to come on here and make fun of someone like this.  I don't think you have the slightest idea what "normal human interaction" is.
---
Then don't. Leave. The ones who want to play the game will continue to "subsidize" the game.
---
Piss off
---
*Equips cannibal perk card*
---
I'm ready.
---
Lol. OK. Because items for sale fly off the shelf.
---
&gt; So all the first subscribers leave the game. Then what, who is left.
---
No one, and a game with terrible monetisation dies a death.
---
&gt;Zenimax and Bethesda have really made a mess of this and I'm not a fan of their actions or attitude, but you know what is worse. A toxic community. It's not just this game, and in fact this game was one of the very very few with, for whatever reason, had nice people in it. To my mind even if these actions did have the desired effect , and in some unicorn based universe they reversed it all, I'm not sure the game would be the place it is today. Perhaps that it's more fitting for a post-apocalypse game... But I'm not sure I'd play it.
---
You do know you could rebrand this and deploy it as stock statements for any act of defiance? That 'yes the big wigs did a bad but can't we all just be nice?' attitude.
---
Thank you very much.
---
Hey, No Mans Sky was way better than 76 at launch. Was it missing stuff and promised features? Sure. But did it t-pose aliens and crash all the time and allow duping? No. Fallout 76 is it's own separate, non comparrisonal thing
---
Yeah, I'm not making 10+ paragraph posts saying that people are actively hurting all video games because they bought an optional subscription to a game. You're the one telling people what to do with their money, afterall.
---
And I didn't realize that just because Fallout 76 isn't an MMO, that it's irrelevant that subscriptions exist in other games. For the record, no one said Fallout 76 is an MMO. Doesn't mean they didn't steal ESO's premium service and slap a new name on it. You get 1650 atoms - the same as ESO. You get access to "member only sales", an unlimited crafting container and unrestricted access to everything the game has, whether that's their "DLC" or "private servers". They didn't, however, take ESO's 10% bonus exp. So yeah... So different.
---
I wish Fallout 1st had taken the extra exp from ESO Plus too, the level of toxic man-baby tears would be off the charts. Well, they are now, but even more. In fact, I just bought more Atoms after seeing your post last night. Bethesda is doing a great job, in my eyes, at weeding out outrage-filled dudes like yourself. Keep it up, Daddy Todd.
---
Yeah I do like the super heavy lore intensive environment so far, I would have just liked a few more people or robots to talk to for quests and stuff. It is one of the things I love about fallout games the people and my choices affecting those people.
---
Ooo, such language. Do you feel powerful when you lower yourself to that level? I sure hope so, otherwise it made your entire statement completely useless, and you want what you say to have SOME value right?
---
I'm not blaming the consumer for the greed of the company; that implies that BGS/Zenimax is being overly greedy. They aren't. They are simply changing the income model of the game, and the reason for that is that the old one wasn't working. The reason it wasn't working is because no one was buying into it, if anything people were going out of their way to not spend any money. People and companies produce products and services to make money, not to lose money. 
---
When we run into situations where the money doesn't fit our income, we change what we can right? That's just human nature, no one likes to lose money. For the most part they can't lower the costs associated with FO76 any more than they already have. If anything the cost needs to go up, so that the game can get better. So, the income needs to grow to match. If every active player had purchased a $10 package of atoms atleast once a month, regardless of what they wanted/needed in the shop, we likely wouldn't have seen this subscription get released. That wasn't happening, so BGS came up with a completely voluntary solution to the problem. They gave us some great benefits, for a measly $13 a month. For those of us (on PS4 atleast) ot doesn't even auto renew. We have to manually go and extend the service, so no one can even argue that the goal is to charge people who forgot about the renewal date. They've gone about it in the best way possible.
---
My MAIN point, was that if you are unwilling to invest in the game, and aren't going to spend more money either way, then stop whining. The subscription literally does nothing to affect the way you have been playing the game. Get over yourself.
---
That not what it says at all..
---
I don't blame them 
---
I ban all firsters I see on sight
---
I agree - but what I was pointing at that NMS (Well.. murphy) promised a ton of stuff that wasn't built in - and yet they fulfilled and are still fulfilling most of those promises as of today and without asking for a subscription ;)
---
If you took the time to look at the people ITT you'd realize quicjly they are not players and don't post here. This is the case most of the time. I don't need a safe space I just want to talk about the game, not read thousands of posts about uninstalling and all this b.s. Maybe you assholes should make a sub where you can just be mad all the time about video games since that's all you care about
---
Tse was broken. It didn't require any perk speccing or downsides (low health for bloodied or addiction for junkies)  for basically a free 150% more dmg. Reguardless of dupers it definitely was  going to get nerfed.
---
Lol. Getting mad at me for just explaining sub rules? There is a dedicated sub for these kinds of posts. Relax.
---
Check my reply to him
---
Parched starts at 20%
---
This is a full priced 60 dollar game adding an optional subscription that costs more per year than gamepass. Storage of personal items shouldn't be an issue facing a looting game. The bonuses in this pack should be sold as a 6 dollar convenience pack not something that costs more than a service that lets you play a ton of games. Also people are more routinely getting upset by this kind of thing. This subscription is predatory and does not offer enough benefits for the price.
---
Whatever you need to tell yourself so don't feel like part of the problem
---
Yeah, I suspect this was the case. It would’ve made sense to release this with Wastelanders to try and sugar the pill, but the higher ups wouldn’t tolerate *two* delays so insisted the rest of the timetable be stuck to. I’m sure some tried to tell them it was terrible timing, but as they likely have no connection to the game bar numbers on a screen I’m equally sure they didn’t care.
---
And completely different genres, how many active players are on a single ESO server? That is the difference, it is an MMO, fo76 is a looter shooter.
---
why discount what fools will pay full price for
---
Yup.
---
We should just remove all the weapons from the game so it's more fair.
---
Why are you being downvoted? Tse was out right broken. And wasnt it this sub bitching for the nerf in the first place?
---
Look at this accounts history and tell me he's not a tourist, people literally seething so hard they're logging into alts
---
I agree with you. HOWEVER, there is no point complaining about it. Nobody is listening. They will not change it and I wouldn't be surprised that they'll take it even further down the P2W lane.   
---
This subreddit makes us believe we have a voice while we have none.   
---
The bugs that are here for months (trade bug) will be fixed eventually but it is clear that the priorities of the players are not aligned with theirs. BGS is focussed on money and money only. They will continue to break promises. All we can do is realize this and not getting our hopes up. Now we are just yelling at each other...
---
Seems you've never tried to farm around a bloodied tesla user.
---
I hope that barrel around his neck has NukaShine in it.
---
Minecraft is cheaper and is persistent, but when you have the best selling game of all time and your publisher has its own server farm, you can afford to have cheaper servers. With the others I think it's competitive.
---
Questions: how are the unlimited scrapboxes handled by the client? As a 1st subscriber I've seen smoother gameplay, but have 10 times the items than before. Do these two (scrapboxes and performance) even correlate? 
---
Thank you for your post, very informative!
---
In Fallout? Or is this some strange political comment?
---
You're such a flatterer...
---
Sadly I have, I uninstalled the night 1st was announced. I had high hopes for 76, and for a while it looked like it was on track to meet those hopes after a very rocky start, but this was the last straw for me really. QoL items locked behind a paywall, with no way of earning them in game? A monthly fee to play the exact same game I have played to death already? A monthly fee to have more stable servers like we should have got from the start?  That all amounts to a hard pass from me and does not inspire much hope for the games future health/success either.
---
It can be a real pain in the ass doing some of those challenges.
---
A buddy of mine has a hideous contraption in his Blueprints that he can plop down in a Workshop over a puddle. Takes off his armor, takes a Rad-X (to suppress mutations like Bird Bones) and suicides himself for others to revive him. It works really well.
---
Your next "impossible" quest will be to get Stimpak Diffusers for the Medic badge... As soon as you see three in a player vendor, get them! You don't need to craft them, just use them.
---
I mean its been 5 years. So they've lasted a lot longer than Fallout 76.
---
Not as bad as you but yes in the UK &amp; the Eurozone
---
&gt;@Bethesda Developers how do you sleep with yourself at night doing all this?
---
Yeah, how is some coder or concept artist or sound man SLEEPING AT NIGHT doing all this, personally robbing Gamers!
---
Type louder and with more anger and surely you'll change the world, dumbass
---
The tents are completely indestructible, thus able to be used as unbreakable cover in pvp workshop encounters and any other pvp encounter. They are the only buildable item in the game that is indestructable.
---
That is absolutely helping win in pvp battles.
---
They want everything in the game for free, so go vote in a system that will make the policy changes needed to make games and content free.
---
Wow, Aspirin costs like 50 pence in England
---
I thing Bethesda administration fail to even read this.
---
You mean like [this](https://www.bestarkhosting.com/)?
---
ARK Server costs around 1$ per slot per month. Minecraft servers for about 10-15$/month for 20-40 players (also around 0.5-1$ per slot/month). AWS is more complicated, because it has different price plans - and the more you rent (you might also make a long-term contract) the bigger the discount.
---
But what's the deal? Fallout 1st is 15$/month...which is like the industry standard for MMO subscriptions!?
---
Reddit is indeed the minority in gaming in general, I only joined to increase my trading reach in 76, I wasn't really bothered with the site before that. Just about everyone play with both on PS4 don't have a Reddit account or have even heard of it!
---
That's something I've been meaning to look into myself as I've read conflicting reports. I have various weight reduction cards and armour pieces that I swap in and out quite often, so it's not always immediately apparent to me where I'm making a weight saving (unless I actually isolate the variables and test it). In the interim, hopefully someone can let us both know!
---
We're they firsters?
---
To be fair I believe they get paid more in New Zealand so it balances out
---
whats the URL?
---
Cost almost as much as a mmo sub, but with a to. Less content lol.
---
Lets be honest here: Bethesda knows how to make money.
---
Without being disrespectful, there isn't one thing they could release for FO76 that you guys wouldn't buy, even if its objectively not worth your money. You already agreed when you said "Learn to do the same" instead of "make your own opinions".
---
You already think people should just learn to shut up and take what they give you.
---
More than likely on a PC with specs that aren't up to par, as is the way most of these posts have been going lately.
---
It's not *a* fucking game, it's *all fucking games*
---
That's the point of the post
---
None of this has anything to do with griefing
---
As I already said, I would be perfectly OK with the removal of the scrapbox, the game worked fine without it for a year, and it was never promised that one would be added. I do not agree with the idea of trying to force paid content to become free, however, and developers should not cave in to such demands in my opinion. It is a fair point that the subscription is not in line with the spirit of the promises made before launch, so reverting everything to the state prior to its introduction and giving a refund to those who already bought it would be the most correct solution if anything was to be changed, the way I see it:
---
* Add a bundle of the exclusive ranger outfit, emotes, and icons to the atom shop for 1299 atoms.
---
* Remove the scrap box and the survival tent from the game completely, scrap box contents are moved to the owner's stash.
---
* Release the server software "as is" at the end of life of the game, so PC players can host worlds themselves for free, and have access to eventually unlimited modding with community developed tools.
---
Well said. It’s gone so far that I saw a for sale ad that stated ‘non fallout 1st buyers only.’ People need to remember this is just a game.
---
I hope they weren't a firster
---
I would have to go through some of the notes/patches/reddit posts. Im honestly leaning towards Patch 11. Thats when they reworked the SBQ kill and reworked the other challenges as well. As I said though, I was able to get everything done finally on the new toon. My main, could NOT complete them. Standing in the middle of Grafton Dam screaming why. lol
---
You would have to agree to pvp him, or be at a workshop where pvp is allowed, i think you used the word “griefed” wrong here or am i missing something?
---
I've definitely been there before 🤷
---
Yes besides the fact that bratwurst companies haven't suddenly started sending up the meat and casting separately, charging the same price it used to, but now introducing the option to pay double for the convenience of it being put in the casing for you. Makes so much sense!
---
And then where do you store all this stuff you buy, sounds like a mini game in itself :)
---
All aboard the bandwagon! Don't miss out!
---
Scrap is just an item id + quantity. So for the server it really doesn't matter if you have 1 or 1 million. This is different for weapons and such which need more data (i.e. which model, what mods are attached, whats the durability, etc.). 
---
In regards to performance.. when you put all your scrap into the scrapbox - you are basically segregating a long list of items into 2 smaller ones making them both load faster - where the scrapbox will contain simpler item data (i.e. { type, amount }) and your normal stash containing all 'unique' items.  
---
If you stuff your normal stash full of weapons you'll notice that it will start to take a hit on the gameplay, especially when you are getting near to your camp or load into it. (FO will only load stash data when you are near, some inventory data only on trigger (like vendors))
---
I dont think you got the point of this post
---
Get 1st, go to Atomic Shop, claim in the 1st tab (literally also the first tab in Featured).
---
That's just a decoy. It's filled with jet.
---
Exactly..
---
Except there are tons of games that don't have a monthly subscription that constantly get updated. Minecraft still has new things added every month, no subscription. Diablo 3 still has new content being added every couple months with no subscription, Hell, DIABLO 2 still has the public servers running nearly 20 years after the game came out, with updates coming for over a decade after release, never once even had a single microtransaction.
---
This claim that they NEED to have a subscription to survive is asinine and completely untrue as there are hundreds of popular online games with zero subscription services that have been online and continue to stay online long after the game was released.
---
I'm a never firster and I'm not ashamed to admit it 
---
Filthy firsters are the worst
---
I acquired the icons,stash, ranger armour but I never saw the camp
---
This is closer to a good idea than the original post.  
---
But remember, they need to make money to pay for servers and the game's software developers.  Otherwise no more game or game expansion.  
---
Personally I think $5 a month would have been smarter - but's that's just my opinion.
---
On pc you hit f I think for your quick bar gun load outs are. When your in that menu at the bottom of the screen it tells you to press a button to deploy the tent.
---
LOL, Bethesda has become a mobile game company. This is trick number one, make the game tedious, then sell “upgrades” that dull the tedium. For $13 a month, plus the upfront purchase, it is nearly the experience of FO4.
---
I ban firsters on site when I play
---
Damn firsters messing up fallout 76
---
I didn't even know about "Fallout 1st" until this post! 
---
WOW.. talk about an **INSULT** to the Fallout community who have been frustrated by this *insane-more-buggy-than-usual* game!
---
Thanks for taking the time to explain an answer!
---
I just got the robot/ fridge from free currency from playing the game.
---
I was looking for marine arms with weapon weight, and stuff to craft ultracite ammo. Also buying cheap scrip. Not a lot of storage swap going on.
---
Maybe it can be a new Perk Card
---
np :)
---
I mean, we all bought the game.
---
Firster scum are the worst
---
And the same thing could be said about literally any transaction in history provided it’s big enough. 
---
Drink prices at a nightclub in Vegas are completely outrageous. 99% of people would never order bottle service. The 1% that spends $15k on a bottle of champagne “affects” the other 99% and ensures that those prices don’t change. 
---
Is it still my (or anyone else’s right) to tell that “whale” what to do with his/her money? The answer is no. 
---
Just an FYI, I’m not a whale. Never have been. But I still support people’s decision to spend **their** money how **they** wish.
---
I know. Weird how that just slipped under the radar...
---
&gt;There are way more interactions with the server
---
You are not charged for server interactions. You are paying for (computation) time with a certain hardware setup. It does not matter if you are running a FO76 or BF5 server on that hardware. You will pay the same - assuming both applications run on the same hardware.
---
Listen, I subscribed for a month to see if the thing was worth it. It’s not really, not until they give you an actual persistent private server anyway.  But if I’m playing online and some bozo starts harassing me because of my purchase you can bet I’m pulling the “mad cuz poor” card, not because I actually feel that way, but because I want the bozo to leave me alone. I used my hard earned money to make a purchase, it’s no one else’s business to tell me if I should or should not have, and if you just met me, you have no idea what my thoughts are on said purchase.
---
Then go to play station... If you want to play In your world then yes you have to pay... I'll defend this game because I just have enough of this shit... It's 60$ not 609$ stop crying about how bad it is for the money you paid.. you had the beta...
---
They're up in the US but they disconnected 6 times for me in the last 2 hours.
---
Firsters ruin everything
---
Everyone has the right to dictate whatever they like, its literally the definition of Free Speech. Even if they are dead wrong.
---
Dictating how and what someone else should feel think and say is arrogance of the highest level.
---
Yea LOL indeed.
---
Firster scum wrecked the game
---
Servers are up in Poland
---
Crafting and selling. I make steady income on junk, mainly the junk used to make the most crafted items. If I see it sold for less than my price, I'll buy just to resell, and keep my shop stocked.
---
Steel, copper, lead, acid, plastic...all sell insanely well. Mostly because of ammo crafting.
---
Legit question: which games? Get me out of here.
---
Yea they are, prolly because it's more fun being around me than being around you guys,
---
That just shows that they don't calculate for a countrie's economic situation whatsoever. 1070 RUB are roughly 15 US$, so it matches their price. But considering it's the same price in Europe and I'm getting an hourly wage of about 1200 RUB (~ 17 €) as a research assistant during my PhD, it seems ridiculous that you are priced the same. Not that I would ever buy that bullshit. A crate of beer is about the same price and has a better value to me.
---
You can’t deny the fact that the Scrapbox’s function is a newly developed feature for the game. The only reason you have to call it paid content is because BGS decided to make it paid content. This newly developed feature centers around the essence of the game and that is junk collection. Junk is the blood of the game. Inventory management only ever existed because the feature had not been developed. It is unfair to default players to manage their inventory when the sole purpose of inventory management in this game was due to the fact BGS had no other way of allowing players to collect in an online game. So inventory management became part of the game. Inventory management has never existed in fallout before. It is not paid content it is game content behind a paywall
---
You're doing us a favor.
---
Yet another new account signed up &amp; only posting to defend Bethesda, literally no other content. And knows about stuff a newvb wouldn't know. Hi Bethesda how you doing? Hang your heads Bethesda this is low
---
&gt;You already think people should just learn to shut up and take what they give you.
---
Never said that, I actually invited people to learn to stick to their own opinion without feeling the need to enforce it on the rest of the community.
---
Lol you're just scraping the bottom of the barrel aren't you? Progression? and advancement? Really? That's not p2w because there is no difference between level 50 or level 900. Gear and weapons cap at level 50. 
---
Okay so the tent is indestructible, that's fine but so is any structure in the game world anyway. So that point fails.
---
Okay so let's see what we can come up with next.
---
Because there isn't cover literally everywhere at workshops?
---
Destroyed resource extractors are still present, they just look banged up.
---
I really like the camera quests. I've just been doing the Tadpole Scout ones.
---
I did, is the Bethesda office nice?
---
&gt;  but if you actually think this you're ignorant.
---
I think you need to re-read what they wrote. Cost in $usd is irrelevant to this situation.
---
I'd like the ability to name my Brahmin or the Junk Robot.
---
It's called a Survival Tent. You place it by opening your Favorites wheel (weapon wheel) and pressing T in a zone that allows it. If you don't see the option, that means you're too close to a protected area (just like with CAMPs).
---
I think that the Company that owns Bethesda is still giving me too much. Servers, some game to play and free bugs? That's too much thrown in!... Fortunately, it's the best model that they devised, a SUBSCRIPTION! What a better way to suck dough.  
---
I would gladly have paid them for absolutely nothing in return, ROI is a good thing, but RONIW (Return On No Investment Whatsoever) is even better for them. I want to help Capitalism while i still have a little money to offer them. Just give me ads, marketing and lies, please: I am a discerning Consumer. STOP giving me Anything for what I pay, please!... You're a Business, not a Charity, right?...
---
I don't care what the game is or who puts it out, I'll pay for what I like.  I'm not happy with Fallout 76 simply because I never in my life had a desire for a multi-player Fallout, but can't blame BGS for tapping that market.  Would I 'encourage' them by buying Fallout 1st?  Don't really care.  I buy what I like (not that I'm getting Fallout 1st either way).
---
These kids with a mission to 'bring down Bethesda' or 'teach them a lesson'.  By the looks of it, Fallout '76 is tanking financially and the Atom shop isn't paying the bills.  They either make adjustments or shut the game down.  It's a business.
---
MS bought Mojang 5 years ago.  
---
 They have been explicit in their commitment to support both the W10 version and the moddable Java version.
---
**They do offer paid server hosting -Minecraft Realms- and they allow you to host it yourself locally or with a third party company.** Realms are $8 a month but are vastly superior to the "private" servers offered by FO76.  They are permanent, persistent, whitelisted, and your friends can play even when you are not online. 
---
They are completely optional, have free plug-ins and game modes, and are rock-solid stable.
---
Minecraft is an excellent example of how to offer extra paid services and not piss your customers off.
---
If you were still playing 76 I'm not sure what your deal is.
---
If you're still playing it after 1st, or if you have even bought 1st, you are brainwashed and I don't think there is any help for you. This slave consumer mentality is a curse.
---
Bethesda made Fallout 76 a capitalist hells cape in order to compete with The Outer Worlds.
---
I like how easily they can be used to identify firster scum
---
there is a difference to griefing and PVP. i think you just tried the second
---
Maybe as a trial, but you do know the people who work on this stuff need to get paid, right? The initial client cost isn't enough to cover the resources necessary to keep new features and services running. 
---
It's not just $8.33-$12.99 per sub = pure profit for Bethesda. Equipment and people cost money. Too many people crying about Fallout 1st and underneath it all it's not that they hate the changes it's that they hate the idea of having to pay for them.
---
False advertising? You know it's easy to say that your product might get a feature, but it can be too hard to make.. I don't see any reason to hate on it... The freaking bags.. most people threw them into a storage room and don't give a shit if it's canvas or something else.. the helmet was the thing you paid for... And even after that Bethesda gave the people their canvas bags... I find it way better that they gave people the other bags Instead of saying sorry there are to many orders you'll have to wait... They decided to use other materials to prevent it.. it's not false advertising but trying something...
---
Totally agree and it shouldn't be happening BUT the fact that so many people are purchasing should make players worry as its not going to stay as inocent as a scrap box and tent it will get worse and those that pay for this sub are just opening up the door for it to happen. When they start charging for dlc and even to run the game because they will just post something somewhere saying " well we have tried to keep the game going but we have not been able to keep up with the cost so now we will have to go back on our word and start charging for dlc on top of a mandatory payed sub" i dont put anything past them now. i played from day one up until the day they announced this sub and really im not with the whole 13 dollars is too much or its not worth it i dont like that logic, they are a business and need a revenue stream but at the same time when they create an imbalance in a game by treating paying customers and non paying customers differently and putting things behind a paywall its crosses a line. So while i agree with your sentiment they created this chaos and i hope this game fails. I love this game but i cant play it anymore.
---
Just for fun! Obviously.

If ever there is a worthy candidate of being assassinated by a dark brotherhood Dragonborn, it would be a crooked Riften guard
---
Ranger armor = block from me 
---
Do people not know The Outer Worlds is out?
---
I know friends are a myth so it can't be the multiplayer of 76 keeping them there...
---
Display cases (including weapons displays) were added to the base game as a popular request, so armour displays should be there as well. 
---
If they want to make super fancy weapons and armour displays, that's another thing. But the basic version should be with the rest.
---
You are a candle in the darkness.  Thanks.
---
Tell me one thing do you have to pay for it ? NO!
---
Unfortunately, since activision merged with vivendi, blizzard as the kid company has been "forced" to start an in-game shop with all sorts of macrotransactions. Biyearly expac fee + Monthly sub + a gajillion "just cosmetics" (when the game is no longer about the RPG but about cosmetics, you can't justify cosmetics as "just cosmetics") is Activision trying to milk WoW playerbase dry. So let's not make WoW out to be some baseline normalized monetization here.
---
Also, remember bethesda rolled out fixes to stop players from stacking foundations to make indestructible camps deeming them too powerful. Yet now they are selling you them with fallout 1st.
---
I’d sell my disc but I’d feel bad since my mom bought it for me got the fancy steelbook too
---
That was happening to me too for the past two-three hours. Disconnected repeatedly! Then it went down completely
---
I still got a pocketful of money. I work for my game addiction. No kids no unnecessary bills. Me and my wife play together she subbed too. We use our time in game helping others.
---
damn i wish i worked there!
---
thx for the response :)
---
Although it’s not doable for everyone ( which is understandable ) I just wanted to maximize a service that I’ve had since it’s inception and was going to continue to have going forward. It’s not a glitch, on the disclosure portion of the promotion it states that when activating said promotion all remaining months on Xbox live gold up to 36 months will be converted to game pass ultimate. It’s a promo they ran at E3 then stopped and have since started up again.
---
As a paying 1st subscriber I feel Bethesda should have gave the portable camp to everyone. Then the sub is broken down to just the scrapbox, private worlds, atoms, and cosmetics. I would still subscribe at the current price, non-paying players would still get something cool even if they didn't fork over $$$. Ideas are free, pass it on.
---
These can be dropped anywhere at any time with zero scrap use. That is absolutely an advantage, you can't drop extractors anywhere, only on nodes. While the tent can be dropped literally anywhere.
---
What exactly do you win? 
---
How does it make anyone a better player? 
---
How does this hurt your individual experience? 
---
Answers: 
---
1. You don’t win anything at all. 
---
2. It doesn’t make you a better player
---
3. Only reason I could think of how someone else buying a subscription and hurting your experience in game would be if you are into PvP, instigating PvP or griefing other players. Otherwise this subscription has 0 to very little impact on your game. 
---
Now on a personal level... if you’re so bent out of shape on this especially about anyone lying... and the fact it’s a game option no one is required to buy or have and doesn’t effect what you purchased... I can only imagine that you must literally hate everything going on in the outside world today since lies and deceit are common... 
---
I can safely say you probably can’t support any large entity at all in the game industry or those in control.... 
---
Oh well... it’s just a game at the end of the day... that’s really the bottom line... as I said, find something you like... too much negativity in the world to have to trash a game... think about it... 
---
Hope you find something! And I mean that genuinely!
---
There's the r/fo76 we all know and love...  I was getting worried reading through all these positive posts.
---
&gt; They aren't publically traded (to my knowledge)
---
[They are](https://www.gpw.pl/company-factsheet?isin=PLOPTTC00011).
---
Yes because this kind of games are only for looting and stacking up shit in your stash..
---
If you have friends and the patience to work through the lack of stability and balance then you could enjoy it for at least a while. Don’t buy anything past the base game though
---
Sounds like a cool build :) Camp interactions are my favourite part of the game
---
&gt;You do know you could rebrand this  and deploy it as stock statements for any act of defiance? That 'yes the  big wigs did a bad but can't we all just be nice?' attitude.
---
Slight tweak and you've got it. how about you try: 
---
'yes the big wigs did a bad but can't we all just be nice **to each other and aim our criticism towards them**?'
---
Have a think about any movement which has succeed. They all have somethings in common - they are unified, speak with one voice and don't attack their own. Think about trade unions,  civil rights activists, etc.  I'm all for acts of defiance when something is wrong but this is not the way you get change.
---
But as I said - I REALLY don't think this is what that was about, far more likely griefers just being griefers.
---
&gt;No one, and a game with terrible monetisation dies a death.
---
Maybe but, and I know this might be sound selfish, but I enjoy this game and don't want it to die I'd like it to get better and if they stop making it or developing it then there is no chance for it improving.
---
Honestly it's hilarious. All the terrible shit going on the world, including gaming companies kowtowing to regimes that have actual concentration camps, and THIS is what people choose to be incensed by.
---
190 NZD = 120 USD, so that's the same price for the year subscription.
---
Firster scum will destroy this game 
---
Every patch will have them as priority
---
Every dlc will give them extras 
---
Every buff it nerf to scrap or weight will have firsters in mind 
---
It's like private vs public school 
---
The more kids go to private, the more it is treated as the default 
---
In a few months Bethesda will regard firsters as the REAL customers and the rest of us are just here to inflate player numbers to attract more firsters
---
Exactly what I mean.. just get over it and stop talking shit.. I just don't understand these people
---
Now do this in real life with actual rich people
---
&gt;but attacking players
---
When you say "attacking" what do you mean exactly? I think we should try make this very clear first.
---
No, I was commenting to the fact the style of subscription model itself isn't fatal for a game.  I still like the -idea- of Fallout 1st, I got it to try it and see what I thought, I think it's a valid offering, but it is too much money,  without the content, as you are right to point out.  If it had released paired with Wastelanders I think we'd be seeing far less discussion on it.
---
\*puts on Cat and the Cradle, sniffles\*
---
There's definitely something moving about a parent teaching their child. Maybe you miss your mom?
---
&gt; 'yes the big wigs did a bad but can't we all just be nice to each other and aim our criticism towards them?'
---
Because our consumer choices drive what they choose to sell. It goes back to the 'one man makes no difference' attitude. Why would I begrudge a company for taking money from people willing to offer it up freely? Why would I begrudge a company selling hats made from human skin if there were queues out the door of people waiting to buy it?
---
What platform are you on!!
---
Maybe a silly question, but are the resources you accrue on private available when you are on public?
---
Pvp system is faulty is fuck. Griefing is the only option. There is no real win or lose situation in that mechanic. So everybody who wants can come and fuck up whatever you are doing. So the original owner can choose between giving up or fight an endless battle they weren't in the mood for in the first place. Basicly giving the griefer what he wants. And funny how this only happens in adventure as soon as there is something with the survival mode. I should be able to enjoy the build mode  without the change of some random nobody come in anytime and ruin what I'm doing. And do I have to point out this particular dick has his own world where he can open all workshops if he pleases once more?
---
Oh, I definitely know it was intentional! I myself upgraded 14 months of regular Gold to Game Pass Ultimate with the same deal. Just the thought of dropping nearly $360 on Gold hurts my poor-university-student soul.
---
So what the fuck are you doing here ? And why you even tell your opinion.. ? From YouTube ?
---
\+1 for dogs doing stuff
---
WIth Bethesda's recent behaviour and reevaluation, the free dlc part remains to be seen.
---
Well adding a perceivable Social and Economic advantage to a game is begging for people to target folks... especially when pvp is encouraged.
---
Lol i sorted by controversial out of interest and am blown away to find people actually defending this trash game.
---
This sounds like me with my girlfriend except she’s 25 lmao 
---
Doesn’t want to shoot stuff, just make a pretty house on the train tracks
---
the only position im against regarding private servers is people's desire for mods.  FO76 is an online persistent game, this is not a single player.  MODS mean cheat, cheat means ruining experience for other legit players.  I strongly feel IF bethesda opens up mods for private servers, they must create a new character for it.  i dont want to run into idiots flying infinitely shooting for 10million damage per shot because that player is bored.  MODS work in single player FO4, it does NOT work in FO76.  Please wake up people and use your brains(and stop requesting MODS for private servers as it stands today).
---
I made that comment in response to this line 
---
&gt;The rest of us is just either enjoying the game how it is, or while being subbed, minus all the whining.
---
Learn to do the same.
---
Which doesn't sound like you're inviting people to stick to their own opinions to me. Now, if you mean that you tell people to stick to their opinions in the comments, fair enough, but I can only respond to what I see.
---
&gt; If you took the time to look at the people ITT you'd realize quicjly they are not players and don't post here. 
---
Actually, I do take the time to look. Certainly more than you do judging from your comment history.
---
&gt; Maybe you assholes should make a sub where you can just be mad all the time about video games since that's all you care about 
---
You say this as if all this negativity and criticism is coming out of thin air.
---
Rather than blaming the victims i.e. the players (both current and former) maybe you should address the source of all these issues, Bethesda.
---
People aren't cranky for the sake of being cranky. Well, not most of them at any rate. There is a reason for it. A very valid reason for it.
---
Rather than making it all me, me, me and complain how much you're inconvenienced by all these negative posts, have a little empathy for the people who put their money and faith into a company that betrayed it. Not just once but multiple times.
---
"Other games do bad thing so you can't call out Bethesda for doing bad thing too" is the same argument as "you can't be mad about [thing] because global warming exists and children are dying in poor countries"
---
Stop being a bootlicker and accept that this subscription is a scam. People are allowed to call out a scam for being a scam, and make no mistake, this is a fucking scam. If other games are scamming people too hey maybe you should go campaign against them. I mean that's basically your argument, other companies are squeezing wallets and nobody is giving them shit for it. Just because we're focusing on Bethesda doesn't mean it's okay for other people to get away with it, you go tell them to stop. That's on you. Be the change you want to see. Don't be a doormat and don't tell other people to be one either.
---
I’m a fallout seconder I get all the cool shit a firster gets but my game actually works, thanks Bethesda
---
I'd bring back blackisle and interplay
---
As a paying 1st subscriber I feel Bethesda should have gave the portable camp to everyone. Then the sub is broken down to just the scrapbox, private worlds, atoms, and cosmetics. I would still subscribe at the current price, non-paying players would still get something cool even if they didn't fork over $$$. Ideas are free, pass it on. 
---
As for the "griefing"....half of you are food builds I'll farm for caps and LOLs.
---
Please stop. Youre making me regret tying my tubes.
---
None of those are relevant to the fact that you are not entitled to someone else's intellectual property for free, and that you were never promised a scrap box. Trying to force Bethesda to make it free is literally extortion, so the whole premise of the thread is hypocritical.
---
See my above comment please.
---
Thats a great interaction. May i ask what platform your on OP?
---
Go to a station and look at the posters. You'll see a party poster, a 'Sheepsquatch Ate My Brother' poster, and a Scout poster. They all unlock some great quests. Also, look out for dead tourists to unlock the Bucket List quest. The corpses have a number of regular spawns, but aren't that frequent. You might find one slumped in a car at the from of Wavy Willards; on a bench in the Philippi Cemetery, on the steps at the Miners Monument, in the fountain at Bolton Greens - there's about 10 locations in all. Take a look online. And when you get to level 25 read the posters at The Rusty Pick to unlock Miner Miracles. That gets you some great armour.
---
Welcome - hopefully it also stops some misinformation being spread around like wildfire -.-
---
Shame!
---
Not even joking a tap *will* come to the atom shop but I don’t care
---
If you look at the atoms alone, the price point is worth it.
---
We all know that. Let's us enjoy this bit of sunshine.
---
I wonder if drop rates improve with a first sub
---
LPT: Boil brats in beer before grilling them. Beer brats are the best!
---
All P2W is elective.
---
Did you perhaps have a coveted workshop and came to defend it with a lot of junk on you..?
---
its Bethesda AND the people who buy it that are the problem. The root of the problem is the players buying. If Bethesda don't make much money they wont bother with this stuff anymore. Its one thing to sell stuff but a huge unfair advantage  and lying about storage could not be expanded. That crossed the line.
---
Bye Felicia
---
but if its based off of supply/demand, then the supply is ever increasing as they can get unlimited junk, so wouldnt prices come DOWN?
---
coveted? What would that be?
---
Free? We paid full price for this game. This “intellectual property” belongs to the players who own the game because they paid for it. Now if the game were free to play yes you have a point. But 76 is evolving. And as it evolves core game components belong to all players. Private servers, an extra tent, emotes, yes ok charge for that. But a core game component that revolves around the heart and soul of the game? C’mon
---
&gt; As for the paid servers, what did people expect?
---
If they wanted to charge $13 / month for a persistent server, I'd be fine with that. I wouldn't even need any of the other perks (stash box, Atom shop currency, etc). My issue with the "private servers" is that they're just temporary instances that don't persist the world state.
---
It's hard to argue with someone who's too invested in being right about not wasting money on another Bethesda scam. Enjoy your subscription, keep pretending that they player base wasn't just bent over and lied to. Do what you have to to make that purchase feel worth it but I'ma go play an actually working and finished RPG instead of swallowing more bullshit from these greedy pricks. You guys definitely deserve each other :)
---
hahaha i came back from AFK to find my daughter had dressed me in the red dress and was wondering around the resort one day. she inherited her oldest brothers account and has me build her pretty houses now and sometimes plays for atoms to buy dresses in the shop. &lt;3 &lt;3
---
Ammo factory, any power station, Hemlock Holes...
---
LOL XD EPIC MEME BRUH
---
Agree. I tried a month subscription to enjoy the game with my son with workshop raiders and without assholes who one shot legendaries. So far so good
---
Harrassing, berating or intimidating them.
---
"Physically" Attacking them in game is fair, as long  as you're not trying to purpodfuly grief them.
---
Idk, just treat them like you'd teat anyone else...
---
 I'd like to see more emotes maybe they add a extra scrap box skin? And here is another idea for first members a ammo box. Since scrap box holds infinite scrap junk items make a ammo box that stores only ammo! Infinetly!
---
I'd rather have a full, working, game at launch that I can enjoy and then have the option of opting into another large chunk of content
---
Related - I've been playing a lot of FO4 and Skyrim lately and I'd much rather have the option of paying for  $15-$45 chunks of DLC than have to spend well over $60 to get comparable content piece by piece
---
If I saw this, Id b-line for a nuke and drop it directly
---
Dude this sub is full of shill accounts trying to defend the game and make it seem like something it really isn’t. Bethesda PR at its finest
---
76 is a new world to go with Fo4. Play both worlds as a solo [experience.](https://experience.Love) Love the private world.
---
Many people would 100% disagree with your “looter shooter” statement... fact is people enjoyed the Fallout 4 world and wanted to experience it with friends! 
---
FO76 gives those players exactly that! 
---
I could be wrong here but your statement looks and sounds like you enjoy hunting these players down regardless if they want to PvP or not... 
---
Right there is exactly why all this is happening... all the changes that have happened and will happen are in favor of the overwhelming majority of players hence the subscription. 
---
They’re sick and tired of griefers and all those that are trying to ruin their game experience. 
---
Bethesda created a survival world which failed, most players couldn’t actually survive and returned to adventure mode to lick their wounds and stock back up their supplies in a safe space...lol not exactly survival... 
---
So if you want to instigate PvP with someone who doesn’t... are you just to scared yourself to actually PvP with other players that want to PvP? 
---
Pretty sure you are... 
---
I do have a solution... create a group for PvP and invite all those to that world. 
---
Maybe your gamertags can add PvP at the end so you know who wants to fight... 
---
Maybe ask Bethesda if they can change the color of the dot to symbolize a player that is open to PvP? 
---
Lots of ideas you could suggest or brainstorm with others then offer feedback to Bethesda...
---
Will do thanks!
---
Wait, you really saw a post saying that?
---
Wow real revolutionary post here
---
The lever action does have at least one of the ones your asking for. It has a blued skin
---
To be fair, there were people here earlier that were "hating it", a lot didn't even play the game, they just like jumping on the hate bandwagon over 76
---
I don't know, you seem like a pretty stuck up person.
---
It’s not well over $60. All future expansions are free... what are you talking about?
---
WHAT 
---
THE
---
ACTUAL
---
FUCK
---
They fucking released the game in a broken state. They advertised it as "all MTX will be cosmetic only". They fucking lied and lied and lied and lied over and over and fucking over again and you STILL bite the bait.
---
I swear I don't know if you guys are trolling or completely degenerate. Bethesda spits in your face and you say "thank you master". What the FUCK man.
---
They'll discount items you get in the atom shop by 10%.
---
I like to see different toolboxes for scrap and junk making it look like a SnapOn tool set wall...lol
---
"There are many players who have never set foot on Reddit, and have no idea that people are angry"
---
Which is no more then a sad fact for not acknowledging the fact a lot of people are actually angry
---
"If you don’t want to support this, that is your right, but it’s not your right to question someone else’s decisions"
---
Actually, since the other persons decision to support backhanded practices like this has a direct and arguably negative effect for all players, i would say they are in their right; 1% of the players should not be allowed to ruin the game for 99% and that's that.
---
Personally I got the robot because I get so lonely in my camp, no one ever visits me :(
---
Why should that cost money though? Most people pay for the power and stability but if you want to you should be able to host your own for free.  Paywalling that feature is bad.
---
this is awesome. i'm so glad there are more moms out there teaching their children how to game. let me know what platform you are on; i'd love to share the excess plans i have stockpiled after workshop capping yesterday on my alt.
---
Guy does something nice to you in on online game 
---
10/10 tHis gAMe iS a MaSteRpiEcE, totAlLy WorTh MOney
---
Meet players. That’s the best way to liven things up
---
Yeah, I was thinking that too, a lot of ways to use the tent to your advantage.
---
&gt; That is absolutely helping win in pvp battles.
---
I didn't know there was a competitive PvP mode in FO76.
---
You can't pay to get unlimited stash. You pay for a private servers where you have your unlimited stash but with only 7 other players in one world when you give every one on public servers unlimited storage then the serves wouldn't even work to be honest. That why we have it limited. And that's why it's unlimited for the fallout first users, because there are only 7 people on one server it won't affect it at all, done understand me wrong man I won't even pay for it, but I don't mind it to be honest.
---
Pretty sure those attacking fallout firsters would attack players anyway and now they can pretend it is for a cause...
---
Paying for a server should be optional to hosting your own.
---
I think they’ll offer a special outfit monthly or other freebie with the subscription. I don’t think anything game wise or extra quest though... I think it will stick material wise like clothing or camp items or skins.
---
But you are not talking about targeting a company. You are talking about taking it out on fellow customers.
---
Might does not make right.
---
These people did not and had no intention of talking to the op about their purchase, why they did it or trying to explain that doing so was a bad thing or anything like that. It was lashing out at someone who ultimately did nothing wrong.
---
Have you ever see animal rights activists outside clothing stores hurling abuse at customers and staff - what did you think of them or their movement? Would it change your buying habits?
---
Now consider the adverts on telly with the about kittens being hurt. How about now - which was more effective?
---
Again, my argument is that their **methods** that not morally justified not their supposed cause (and, as I've said - I highly doubt it was anything other than a power trip).
---
Exactly
---
Basically all you’re telling me the subscription is worth it if I have the money, and I do.
---
Discount on the mods when mod support gets released.
---
The chance to get mods from scrapping on that particular weapon is set wrong.
---
As opposed to every other weapon in the game which has much higher chance than armour this one has the lowest bar none.
---
If memory serves something along the lines of 0.6%
---
Anybody that thinks others are jealous of their FO1st subscription is petty and small.
---
Never mentioned a Fallout 4 experience. I mentioned to play Fallout 76 lonely. Leaving the vault, everyone is dead. With no single word I mentioned Fallout 4.
---
Yes I did. I’d post a pic as proof but I don’t want to cause more drama by calling someone out like that.
---
I am sorry you have such a negative view towards people using this service but please feel free to add my accounts to your block list IGN: Karthathan , TheHoboSeer, EmeraldAshura, and KarthsKubby as I am sure our personalities would not mesh well. I tend to enjoy playing with chill, laidback, and positive people, and rejoice that I can effectively stack my server now with those that are like-minded.
---
It doesn't really matter. Almost everyone I've found actually playing today has a scrap box in their camp. Complaining won't accomplish anything if it's just complaining when it comes to monetization. See: Scrap kits, repair kits, and the fridge.
---
I do not think you understand how copyright works, and your whole argument seems to be based on entitlement (how surprising). No one has the right to force an author to give their work away for free, and if distributing it under the terms they choose is not acceptable for some legal reason, they have the right not to distribute it at all.
---
You tend to look like that in a sub filled with entitled kids and haters, yea.
---
...which is stupid, because all they have to do is go into Passive mode.  Also, they can no longer destroy your CAMP, unless it attacks you first, etc, right?  What else are they going to do, stamp their meal cards "no desert"?  Harsh language?
---
are you on PC?  Maybe you pass the karma and help me.  i'm stuck on this quest as well, hopefully you play on PC.  my player name is 'mifesto'
---
OK. So then they can sell anything they want to you piece by piece because the initial cost was free. Wow
---
Not everyone is using the private server to play solo.
---
I have a group that is usually between 4-7 people at a time. We hop on the private server so we can coordinate to farm nuke zones, we spread out and search different areas hunting legendaries, we cap a all the workshops, etc. It's very efficient.
---
I've been saying this for alittle while now. I see this sub complaining about everything, but when I go in game everyone has all this stuff. Lately, ive mainly come across players with the ranger uniform. Soo cant tell if the community is upset and still buying or.
---
Can’t see where I even mentioned survival mode. And btw, that was something I never missed in the first place when Fallout 76 released and all where asking for more pve and no one knew a survival mode would even come later.
---
But it has to start somewhere, don't you think?
---
Posts like this are dumb.  I agree with you, the Fallout 1st thing is bullshit, but it's also bullshit to push this back on consumers.  People are welcome to spend their money however they like and if someone is going to have a better time having the sub than not having it, then they are entitled to spend their money this way.  Agin I 100% agree that this is a terrible and shortsighted move by Bethesda that will almost certainly lead to the demise of Fallout as we currently know it.  But hey man that's like, things come and they go.  New IPs will be created in the vacuum that Fallout leads and hopefully something new and better will come along as a result of Bethesda just giving up. 
---
But to come on here and try to tell people that they are doing something wrong by buying Fallout 1st is just childish.
---
Spoiler alert: it’s not going to recover
---
I don't even bother with the fallout 1st I won't get it at all I just like to play the game but I don't like that it's harder and harder to meet people :/
---
Then don't overburden your character??
---
You can always censor the username
---
&gt; You have all the right in the world to complain; but attacking players because they decided to spend money on it is fucking ridiculous.  
---
Depends on what you mean by attacking. 
---
Griefing them in game and harassing them online is not cool! Totally with you there. 
---
However, the Fallout 1st purchasers aren't above criticism. They're paying to support anti-consumer practices. Bethesda should get the majority of the criticism for making this possible, so we agree there. However it's these people that are supporting such an anti-consumer practice.
---
It was lake side cabins. I mean worst part is that this dude has his own world. So what was this besides being a dick? Honestly. The pvp system in adventure should work with invites to the whole lobby and those who want can join. And nothing more. Currently the pvp system is completely faulty as  there is no real game mechanic to it. No real win/lose condition. Besides one party giving up. Most likely the initial owner.
---
&gt; But you are not talking about targeting a company. You are talking about taking it out on fellow customers.
---
Targeting a company, targeting it's bottom line.
---
&gt;Have you ever see animal rights activists outside clothing stores hurling abuse at customers and staff - what did you think of them or their movement? Would it change your buying habits?
---
Nope it would not change my buying habits. But it doesn't change their motivations either.
---
&gt;Now consider the adverts on telly with the about kittens being hurt. How about now - which was more effective?
---
Intriguing. Maybe there does need to be some sort of registered charity organisation that uses mainstream media advertising to highlight predatory practices in the video games industry. Although we're still struggling through the 'buying random chances at items is not gambling' stuff so I don't expect any movement on that for a while.
---
Cus he’s allowed to spend his money how ever he wants?
---
So the solution is remove broken pvp. Got it.

I really liked Fallout 4 and have played Fallout 76 regularly since the Beta. I play it because it's great fun. As far as I'm concerned, Bethesda delivered. It is buggy? Yes. Was I expecting bugs? Yes. Do they bother me much? Not really. Does the game crash? Yes. Roughly once every 20 hours of play. I can live with it. The game is massively complex and highly detailed. I'm more often impressed than disappointed. And I won't be buying Fallout 1st because I don't want to and not buying it will affect nothing I do.
---
I think where a lot of this stims from, the negativity i mean, is a lot of us have been fans of bethesda since the Arena days and even Daggerfall, we had sooo much love for this company and have been on the frontlines defending this company for decades now. And it just seem disingenuous to the trust and forgiveness we all shared with Bethesda that they chose to act like the EA and Activisions' out there that treat their consumers as nothing more than dollar signs to their bottom line.
---
I did enjoy my time with 76 and this is coming from someone that this was the first fallout game i liked, jus never could get into the desolate nuclear theme that comes with the franchise, not my roleplaying setting for me. But I stopped playing it after just having not the same feeling i did when playing their other titles.
---
Its missing that spark of love and invited openess like how their other titles had been, kinda like they would be saying to us, "here is our heart and soul we poured into this for all of us to experience, we may not be the best of programmers nor be using the best of engines to do what we need from it, yes its buggy, yes it doesn't look that great and some things might even be unplayable. But, jus like we all are imperfect humans, if you accept it for what it is, you will find your own beauty and love within it."
---
Anymore all i ever hear coming from Bethesda is, "F*ck you pay me, you know how all you're inventory weight and other inconveniences we decided would be? Well grease our hands with cash and you too can have unlimited stash space. You know all the promises we made about a cosmetic only shop? Nah sorry buddy we heard from one person they'd pay for fridges and other time savers so yeah, give us money. You know all the reputation and trust we gather all this time from our fans? We'd rather have consumers who give us money and be short sighted to chase short term gains." Ill jus start giving the titles that want love and give love like Outer Wilds, Death Stranding, Cyberpunk and  The Witcher 3 that appreciation instead of the husk of a company i used to love.

I’ve made quite a few wacky &amp; unique build, but this one is by far my favourite! 
---
I plan to upload a video to the subreddit tonight, so keep an eye out for Fuzzy Factory if you are interested! :D
---
The best comment I've seen :) I can't add anything to it, you just said all the things I enjoy in the game :D
---
I’m upvoting simply because my German shepherd is called Kaiser.
---
Nice crisp pictures!
---
4th and 5th stars for legendary weapons.
---
West of Watoga and a little North is a beautiful mountain, (Far East side has a cliff so be careful), where you can get high beautiful views of much of the map. Taken quite a few photomode aerial shots from there for my loading screens. 
---
It has ponds, forests, and many ores, with very few overall combat spawns! Aside from standard generation for camp placements because we know they love throwing some scorched at our camps no matter where we go!
---
So cool!
---
You support a bad system that hurts the overall state of the game.
---
You're like weapon dealers, not hurting me directly, but hurting me on a global scale. 
---
Or meat eaters (im a carnivore myself), you support a bad system, so I harass you.
---
In this case its verified I think. Also if you dont want em to harass you, just ignore them
---
delet this
---
Look at the way everything's going, everything is on a subscription basis nowadays, old MMORPGs were also subscription, and netflix, and Amazon, and spotify, etc... the list goes on and on, it's nothing new. I dont blame Bethesda for trying to earn more, I'm betting that not many players were buying the atoms from the store so this is the next best thing for them which appeals to more people. Like many others said, if you dont like it, dont buy it, and don't give the players who did buy it any grief as that's just a dick move by putting your frustrations on them compared to the company.
---
Let people just enjoy the game however they want ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯
---
At the very least my flamer will look nice when I go complete the flamer mission for one of the Possum things
---
I don't want to pay for a year but a hundred bucks is a days work minimum wage
---
I read a comment were somone was try to compare it to "giving a broke alcoholic money and hoping they don't spend it on booze."
---
Sounds like it could be used to advantage.
---
I don't think this bit is right though:
---
&gt; They are the only buildable item in the game that is indestructable.
---
Aren't stash boxes and foundations indestructible?
---
Incorrect, you are conflating two different aspects. Enjoyment and cost.
---
If a person enjoys something, but another does not, that isn't a problem of theirs, and nothing is wrong with it. People have different opinions.
---
If the enjoyment is intrinsically tied to how much money is put in, the fault is on the product and its creator, not the person. The product becomes inherently manipulative. If he was not enjoying the game before, and started enjoying it more *because* he threw more money at it (and it was designed that way), that is the problem.
---
Him enjoying it is all well and good, but the company is manipulating his good will, whether he recognizes it or not.
---
VTagious the destroyer of dreams
---
There was a post (a few of them actually) one was a mod to restrict any 1st member from buying at a player vendor. 
---
Another was to target anyone wearing the ranger outfit or had a scrap box at their camp or player icon... 
---
Kinda ridiculous if you think about it... no where in today’s society is it acceptable to attack people like this... but here we are...
---
Private worlds are known cost money in other games it's not unheard of the only thing I cant defend is all the lies they fed us like they couldnt increase stash space but they could give us an unlimited stash space if we paid for it that's bs. The rest of the features I can argue are reasonable
---
One dumb ass got on stage and said cosmetic only, that guy messed up. Everyone else said no pay to win meaning no guns, armor, levels or caps for sale. They fully meant from the start for pay for convenience items to be included.
---
They said all DLC would be free, as in all Story content and new missions will be free and it always will be.
---
I honestly wish they clarified from the beginning that the one dumb ass said the wrong thing, I also think the game should have been free and that way people would be less butt hurt. 
---
You were fine playing the game without Fallout 1st a week ago, so why don’t you just keep doing that and let the rest of us enjoy ourselves.
---
Bullshit. I can spend my money however the fuck I want. You’re not my mommy.
---
this sub is full of people trying to rationalize why they’re staying in an abusive relationship
---
you have the right idea, farm super mutants, get caps from them as they die, sell all the guns they drop, hop servers, repeat!
---
also, farm lead and make .556 bullets, sell them in your vendor for 1 cap each, they will sell!
---
I don’t see how this isn’t crystal clear for you but I will give you an equal hypothetical example of how obsurd this is. Suppose when the game launched CAMPs were not a thing. You could only take workshops as a base. But as the game evolved CAMPs were implemented.....behind a paywall. Now a core function of this game is building. But only those who paid extra get to have CAMPs. Same logic. And if you say that would be fair, it is intellectual property, not every player would be entitled to a CAMP in that scenario then you and I could go back and forth all day and accomplish nothing
---
Ah bummer, I think my newest toon is older than that.  Maybe time to make a new one.
---
Wow! Thanks for the info. If I ever get all the mods, I’m setting up a radium rifle shop for fellow crazy people.
---
"it's at the expense of free DLC and a constantly expanding online game"
---
This can never be an acceptable excuse for further monetization, because:
---
1. We were told free DLC and a constantly expanding game was included in the box purchase
---
2. We were told free DLC and a constantly expanding game was included in the box purchase
---
3. We were told free DLC and a constantly expanding game was included in the box purchase
---
Sure, sometimes things don't pan out the way you expected and you need more money for a project. But it's up to Bethesda to ensure that doesn't happen and deal with it if it does-- they knew the game's problems pre-launch, so they had plenty of time to dwell on how to monetize this game without turning a promise into a lie and trying to turn a paid-for game into an Early Access title (which is what it's turned into in many ways).
---
I don't hate Bethesda over all of this, certainly don't hate the game. But funding the game is not a reasonable justification for their decisions and it's not up to us. We are the consumers, not the investors. 
---
If Bethesda wants to clean up this situation, I think they should be hard at work cooking up actual free DLC and a constantly expanding online game... because that's the most significant problem here... **we are being asked to pay more money when we're not even getting the promised content due to delays and frequent design and/or technical problems with the updates that do come.**
---
If Bethesda had actually made it through their roadmap with many successes in their vault raid and dungeon and display cases and Legendary progression and Wastelanders-- in short, if most of what they've tried to do was actually on time and good-- this subscription attempt would be far, far less of a problem.
---
So I really can't feel pit for a business that creates its own problems and then puts the burden of fixing those problems on the shoulders of their audience.
---
All that said, I don't support any kind of harassment of other players in any form. Debate about the problem, sure, if it's invited, but that's about it. However, for those who both support these moves from Bethesda, and defend them on forums? You should expect strong condemnation and counterargument (though again, neither of those should involve hate or harassment).
---
Capitalism shills argue "give them more money or our promised free DLC will never come out" 
---
Everything they're offering with 1st was already promised as free and they lied. 
---
Wonder how much the DLC is gonna cost
---
Smh
---
You're right.  The wooden inlay skin does have a blued barrel.  
---
It also has a hideous golden action that has kept me from buying it.  Maybe I'm being picky.  There is no accounting for taste.
---
You’re bitching on reddit bro... there’s like half a brain combined. Reddit speaks for like .005% of the gaming community. People just come here to bitch, and the know the have an audience who loves to bitch, and then they jerk each other off.
---
It costs $0 dollars if you don't give in to Bethesda trying out shit practices that will shape the structure of future games.
---
i also noticed an uptick in aholes coming to my camp and trying to start pvp and being general aholes this weekend
---
They almost never do, and those who do are caught up in an Astroturf campaign when they think it's a grass roots movement
---
Yeah, i can't belive people are that dumb
---
I’ll for sure check it out. You should come see my newest one sometime, it’s pretty interesting haha :)
---
Servers seam fine on my end! Me and a friend having no problems. (UK)
---
Xbox!
---
I’m to the point where I see one on a drop, I’m more excited than a legendary.
---
Look, f76 pvp might be extremely faulty when compared to other mature mp titles, but it still can be fun. However, if you are not up for it (and by that I mean pvp gear, build and mindset), every workshop you claim is a potential death trap. It even spells it for you with a quite prominent warning...  
---
I really don't think devs are gonna change anything related to current workshop mechanics. So right now you can either gear up for pvp, pay for F1st or avoid workshops. It is just what it is.
---
I swear the DMV bots are so done with life .
---
I directly quoted it, you don't think I know that?
---
The point is, it's a *little* braggy like I said. Don't invalidate everything else I wrote because I hyperbolized, ya dolt.
---
why downvote this question?
---
Lol, $13 means you're a whale now? Okay. Want some fries with that salt?
---
We've had new events, quests and raids. No huge updates like wastelanders however.
---
here is two salty people who are making asumptions.
---
for the information, i have played this game since launch. but have sometimes taken breaks, in between playing due to my job being very time consuming. 
---
why are you even on this subreddit if you dont like fo76?
---
dude get a life
---
fallout 1st is out. if your not 1st then you get the servers run on hamster wheels. remember if your not paying to play constantly you're a freeloading F2Per and therefore are just leaching resources the company could using to make money off of someone else.
---
Glad to see people are finally getting it. Tired of seeing people complaining solely for the reason they have to pay to have a private server.
---
There's plenty of legitimate things to complain about Fallout 1st and people focus on the only legitimate thing beth is doing
---
Fisto.
---
[Because FISTO!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3SgND89KUWE)
---
Yes, exactly like this. Thank you!
---
Agree.  And many people here are talking ;as if this is like any other game. Hell no it isn't.  It's a title from a beloved franchise, put out by a AAA developer that feels slapped together and like a shameless cash grab. It threatens to permanently damage the company's reputation. 
---
No, I don't think stuff should be free. But when you have fucked up as badly as Bethesda, trying to save your reputation should be priority number one.   You don't save your reputation by charging a subscription fee for a broken product.
---
When plenty of said hate and criticism is deserved, not really.
---
&gt;Maybe there does need to be some sort of registered charity  organisation that uses mainstream media advertising to highlight  predatory practices in the video games industry.
---
Now that's a better idea - it would be more effective and not ruin any fellow vault dwellers day. 
---
Things like in-game protests which get media attention can also be effective AND  both might actually change hearts and minds meaning that less people buy the subscription (in this case) in the future . Attacking individuals just erodes the argument, it's a bit like the 'don't give in to terrorism' thing. You can already see it even on here, all the 'I bought subs for me and all my friends' posts.
---
see my first comment please. if you dont like PVP, then dont play a PVP game.
---
I like fo76 quirks, bugs and all
---
&gt;pvp is encouraged
---
Is that why PVP mode is gone?
---
Imagine bragging that you threw cash at a sleezy corporation because some reddit man called them bad
---
We will absolutely love this story in there &lt;3
---
If the scrap box is any indication, then maybe...
---
An ammo box for unlimited ammo storage or a pantry for pre-war food storage?
---
Nicely done! You've just aired some ideas and Bethesda will probably implement them into the game if you get enough traction on this post! Yay! :)
---
dont think you got the point of the post
---
Why other games pricing is +- equals at least in numbers. Let's take recently released game CoD:MW in US it costs $59.99 in EU price is 59.99EUR 
---
Now 1st subscription costs US $12 EU 15EUR i think is big difference.
---
For 1 year subscription price I am able to buy 2 games at most common price (EU 59.99).
---
Exactly Bethesda has a sister company zenimax online who runs Elder scrolls online and they have a similar service with good features that are very similar to fallout 1st including the stash box but they never once lied to the player base which bethesda did and does a lot
---
I don't sell anything for real money and I don't report people on hacker sites. I am a dataminer however.
---
Now this is one I can get behind...or should Fisto be behind me? i'm not sure....
---
I have 700 hours in Pokemon Rumble and I don't see them asking me for a monthly subscription.  I have 1000 hours in sun and moon, if Pokemon asked me to pay for convenience that they create the need for artificially, then I'd boycott them....which I am because they just dropped that bomb with Sword and Shield. Fuck Game Freak and their home subscription, Fuck Bethsdas Fallout 1st. I don't need companies stabbing me and then selling me bandages!
---
If you get tired of it, I know of two guys that can mod it for you.
---
I'm not uninstalling the game...
---
Obviously lots of people care. This is an online game, and people being able to pay for advantages is dumb and the literal definition of "pay to win".
---
If you don't care, cool, then move on. Many people do care.
---
And then they didn't let you keep the karma syringer, which was lame af
---
AMAZING! 
---
still waiting for a shot of the yellow buildings wood pile. Best town feature. I'll post in every helvetia real life post till I see it! :(
---
Yep, NW games are popping pretty fast, and so many people are using the Ranger armor that it's ridiculous. I think out of the 20+ people I encountered so far, only a few DIDN'T wear the armor.
---
I really hope these people just subscribed for a month, to get the armor... Which I am sadly considering doing as well because RANGER ARMOR. 
---
Hate Bethesda for locking that behind a $13 subscription. Should have been purchasable with Atoms.
---
Yea, but that's why I said face value, you might wanna Google what face value means.
---
And your point is? The game was perfectly playable for a year without any scrapbox, and you were never promised one, saying it is a "core function" of the game is nonsense. All the outrage seems to smack of entitled whining disguised as moral superiority and caring about the "state of the industry", when in reality it is about demanding free stuff. That agenda is betrayed by the fact that none of the complainers seem to want the solution I outlined in [this comment](https://old.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/dnveyb/bgs_even_the_riften_guards_knew_when_they_took_it/f5kxpop/).
---
Yeah not sure who is buying $8.00 asprin here in the US.
---
I mean maybe something like Excedrin migraine and a decent sized bottle
---
Sounds like they want you to gather troops to go hunt someone down.
---
And  I'll do the same on PC. So many plans, and people don't buy as many as they used to. 🙁
---
&gt; Things like in-game protests which get media attention can also be effective AND both might actually change hearts and minds meaning that less people buy the subscription (in this case) in the future
---
Except they don't, because the players who don't agree take it as a personal affront. The leap between 'they don't like this' and 'I like this so they don't like me' is light-speed. Take a look at this sub:
---
* Don't tell me how to spend my money
---
* If you don't like it then leave
---
* You only hate it because you can't afford it
---
* There are bigger problems than $13/month
---
A laundry list of predictable responses to defend predatory and gouging business practices, not even paid for by Zeni/BGS, but pushed by people so desperate to justify their expenditure.
---
 I am sorry you have such a negative view towards people using this service but please feel free to add my accounts to your block list IGN: Karthathan , TheHoboSeer, EmeraldAshura, and KarthsKubby as I am sure our personalities would not mesh well. I tend to enjoy playing with chill, laidback, and positive people, and rejoice that I can effectively stack my server now with those that are like-minded.
---
Why when they can charge literally $100 for a year? In fact, how much development do you think went into making that new content for $12 a month? I’ll tell you. A team of interns being paid $15 an hour. Destiny 2 has a full fledged AAA development and that’s Free To Play...
---
You know why Bethesda keeps getting away with it? Because people like you pay for it. So Bethesda has no idea that its poor content. Because people are paying for it.
---
Vote with your wallet people. And get your head out of the sand!
---
Hey Juiced, what platform are you on? I'm on Xbox and would be happy to play with you any time.
---
And is there any actual evidence of this happening? People getting targeted because they are Fallout 1st subscribers?
---
Because just 40 minutes ago there was [this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/do973m/i_just_got_griefed_by_a_fallout_1st_player/). What do you say about that?
---
That sounds cool! Your name looks familiar.. have we traded before? I might already have you on psn!
---
I bet there is going to be an exclusive companion and people will yell P2W again.
---
This civil war is about the only interesting thing to happen to this game. I really hope it keeps ramping up, like watching a house fire. It's not good, but I can't look away.
---
Their own NPC
---
GST
---
In other words you got your ass handed to you.  Then you came to reddit to change the story to fit your narrative.
---
Cool story bro.
---
so many of these people have the, "it's my money don't tell me how to spend it" mentality and it's so damn annoying.
---
OP is speaking to a shrinking audience. People who disagree with him will leave the sub, leaving only people who agree with him, making him feel validated.
---
I pre-ordered the stupid, lame Tricentennial edition the day ordering opened and I feel like an absolute dumbass for it. I haven't been able to play it since the last patch. I would prefer like a cpl months free. Mainly because I do not  see myself playing it much more. I hope with the next patch it will download completely and I can play Wastelanders at least. TBH I would have preferred more quests, something to do over 1st any day.
---
I do play on Pc, i will gladly help you. I will log ina couple of hours and will add you 😁
---
Dunno I never saw the point of it in a fallout game but it's a system built in the game.
---
Incorrect? You have an opinion that differs from mine, keyword “opinion”. You can think all you want that I am incorrect but it doesn’t change anything since your view is an opinion as well. 
---
You’ll never see me say “you’re opinion is wrong” I never do, it’s an opinion. 
---
The subscription doesn’t hurt anyone at all nor is it a requirement for anyone to have. It doesn’t make you a better player at all... if anything it would make a player worse with space management in my opinion. 
---
I have the subscription but I have yet to place anything in my scrap box... I have bulk and I’m not a hoarder so to me it’s not really needed and I’m not going to scrap my bulk to put it in. 
---
The private server is really nice and myself, my son and my friends fully enjoyed doing the events! Launching a nuke and killing the queen! 
---
It was refreshing to see no one one shot the legendary at uranium fever or camp fire tales like a few that don’t care about others do a lot. 
---
I haven’t made the free costume either... mostly due to seeing many others wearing it... kinda like Halloween with everyone in the same costume...lol
---
Here’s the deal... it’s a game and it has a subscription like many other games. You can still play exactly the same way as you did last week, no different! 
---
Instead we see targeting players specifically because they got it? REALLY???? 
---
That’s being more shitty than what you and others think of Bethesda... kinda fucked up IMO... only proves more why people asked for private servers...
---
I don't really see that much "criticism" different than "WTF BeThESdA Are U StupiDd!:!;:11!!!" around lately.
---
your an addict and need to be cut off from your drug is what you need
---
I should go on and teach my son how to play. He's 10 years old. And yes. I did get him his own bb gun already :D
---
I agree... it actually gives more reason for people to buy a subscription than not.
---
Just great! Excellently written and well to the point! I could not agree more with you.
---
if you wanna play Fallout 4. then go play fallout 4
---
I would say that just because a person got FO1st doesn't mean they don't want to PvP. 
---
Also reading this sub a lot of people got the first month, promptly asked for a refund, and then got to keep the cosmetics, I bet I would find that people who would do this on purpose to save $13 would probably also like taking your stuff in a pvp area for profit.
---
Bolt Action Pipe Pistols and Pipe Revolvers can use Riflemen Perks if you mod them with a stock so you can double dip on the perks.
---
I love my Bloodied ( Junkies is good also) guns I use a Max Gun Slinger card and 1 level of each of the Riflemen Cards. 
---
If you choose to go with a Bloodied Pistol build make sure to use Nerd Rage and Adrenal Reaction serum.
---
I like to find pistols that have one of these 33% Vats Chance, 25% faster fire rate,  and 25% less action points.
---
Max your sneak out and put a silencer on your pistols.
---
I have 3 pieces of Powered Unyielding Armor and my AP seems to last forever.
---
I get 571 damage from my Bloodied Explosive Pipe Pistol and 350ish from my Faster Fire Rate Bloodied 44 and Western Revolvers. 
---
I have a Junkies Explosive 44 that does 275 if I remember correctly.
---
Pistols can be fun
---
Should have charged $20 for this idea.
---
They didn't lock the Outfit behind a subscription alone, they are also giving you 1650 Atoms you can spend further down the line on something else you want, thing that 99% you would have done anyway.
---
I haven't spent any money on it and I intend to keep it that way. I only just recently started purchasing things from the Atom Shop using my earned Atoms. I had to have a Mr. Fuzzy ride for my camp after seeing one at another player's.
---
You are the most sensible person I have seen on this Reddit this week, like me.
---
Well the price in north Africa is 16.63 USD a month,
---
The funny part is I cant even buy it because of region restriction issues.
---
so basically Bethesda does not want to take my money, God bless them
---
So can you post a screenshot with censored usernames? (it's ok if not)
---
&gt; I should be able to enjoy the build mode  without the chance of some random nobody come in anytime and ruin what I'm doing
---
The mechanics of the game say differently.
---
  "No real win/lose condition"
---
He won your junk/caps/workshop/salty tears.
---
Firsters will receive the following ...
---
Extra dialogue options with NPC’s 
---
The ability to modify NPC bases 
---
The ability to have multiple CAMPs, turn them into settlements, and implement settlement recruiting beacons 
---
The ability to construct vaults 
---
Access to a robot workstation and create robots 
---
The ability for their character to have a voice 
---
And finally, the ability to construct a time machine and travel 190 years into the future travel to Boston and have their game integrated with fallout 4 and can play both games at the same time with their 76 and fallout 4 characters in both worlds. 
---
Price increases to 200 dollars a year
---
Another set of broken, 10 minute long fetch quests.
---
Thanks. At this point it’s kind of my endgame😆.
---
You get the camp PA blueprint in the course of main story, Brotherhood area if memory serves.
---
I'd highly recommend making a tiny camp BP.  Most easy for me was a metal stair that went into the middle of a 3x3 with crafting stations and such.  It's enough room for every camp crafting station and bed.  Just don't include foundation in BP.  This will let you easily drop a camp anywhere, anytime.  Made life easy since I shift camp constantly early on if I was encumbered or just found a nice spot near a quest hub.
---
Or constructively come up with an idea that others can agree to collectively and submit it as an idea to the developers that a large amount of the community would like it see happen...
---
I bought it, and i dont have the icon equipped... and i dont wear the ranger suit either... and even if i did wear it, i wouldnt be flaunting in peoples faces. not everyone who bought the subscription is a snobb. I just wanted a private server for vault raids.
---
The private server and the premium membership should definitely have been separate subscriptions though. This seems like just another predatory technique to sell people as much as possible on the chance players don't use their private server.
---
And I agree on private servers being something fine to charge for, but I was hoping these servers would be 32 or 64 man servers that we'd see entire clans take control of and eventually make cities and stuff as it progressed (build rules changed). But no, 8 player. An already empty game feels even emptier.
---
I was much thirstier this weekend than normal and it did seem to take more.
---
Most of these are available with in game atoms, and does not prove people paid real money for them.
---
There is a HUGE majority of folk purchasing fallout 1st JUST for the the things that come with it...
---
The more important thing to consider, is how many people actually play this game still, as opposed to if they hadn't done fallout 1st, or even maintained their game.
---
The jealous defense is a very common one for anytime some one doesn't mind paying for microtransactions and some one else tries to point out to them the harm of supporting those practices (how it ruins gameplay by encouraging bad game design).   
---
I am going to guess it's more to justify it to themselves why you are wrong and they are fine to do what they do.
---
It's completely justified. I bought one month and I will probably buy a few more months.
---
 You are probably one of those people that bitches about free challange Atom's being too hard to acquire.
---
 They need to make money somehow this game is full of freeloading entitled little shits who want everything for free.
---
 I'm glad there's people like me who bought the premium 1st subscription. 
---
 In fact there's a whole lot more people like me because I see them all over in game. The majority of my friends list also has the 1st subscription...
---
I'm more blown away that people that think this is a trash game are still here in the sub.  Bethesda is living in your minds, rent free.
---
I kept seeing posts over time saying that Bethesda is playing VaultTek with this game. Massive social experiments. I laughed it off as tongue-in-cheek sarcasm. Now I'm starting to wonder. lol
---
This "dumb ass" is pete hines, the CHIEF OF MARKETING. So that wasn't just some random dude that had wrong information. That was literally the guy that MAKES the information.
---
And no, I wasn't fine playing a week ago because the game is a burning dumpster fire in which nothing improves. The only thing happening is more and more predatory MTX.
---
Constantly expanding?
---
The only thing that has expanded in the last 6 months are monetization methods, Zenimax executive's bank account, Todd Howard's dong and the stupidity of the players.
---
No that's not fair. You're doing the same thing by saying they are just "jumping on the bandwagon". Why do you have such a need to label people?
---
&gt; If you want to play In your world then yes you have to pay
---
No I don't. I want to play in my world, but there are better ways to spend that much money than in a broken product with a premium service that doesn't work properly.
---
I don't understand you. You can't deny that this game needed much more work and time. You have to admit that the game has tons of flaws, bugs and issues that a triple A studio shouldn't publish. 
---
You must see that the stash doesn't work. People loose scrap. It's not a display error. You must have seen that the private server thing doesn't work. The servers have been used before. Enemies are killed, areas are looted and and and. Hell other people can even join you without an invitation. 
---
These were the biggest selling points of the service and they just don't work. At all. 
---
How can you actually defend this? 
---
Sure the can might be fun. But you should stand up against this so that Bethesda is forced to improve. Otherwise it will only get worse. Because you guys still defend their shady business and send them more money on request, no matter how broken the product is. 
---
Why? Seriously, why...?
---
Good luck, hope you got more patience than me.
---
&gt;Bolt Action Pipe Pistols and Pipe Revolvers can use Riflemen Perks if you mod them with a stock so you can double dip on the perks.
---
I wish people would stop suggesting this because it's not a good build really. Missing out on so many damage multiplying agility perks for gunslinger perks just isn't worth it.
---
Increased Stash space (~double)
---
Increased CAMP budget (~double)
---
Experience boost
---
Increased caps drop 
---
Stretch goals:  Armor customization, exclusive atom store deals (and more exclusive items/icons/emotes)
---
We will probably get it for free while the peasants have to pay
---
I’ll pay you to stop posting stupid shit.
---
Like people saying bad stuff? I don’t think so, I think it’s against the rules. 
---
The admins are doing a great job removing the posts. Most just say [removed] now in brackets.
---
A lot of people have also been claiming that the player count dropped and the "gAme IS DyIng!1;!!". They must also be geniuses then?
---
Then maybe you should find a game you enjoy playing, Outer Worlds is pretty good, I’m also enjoying Borderlands 3
---
Jim fucking Sterling son
---
As a bassist, I love it lol. Although it's random as hell.
---
So it's a post apocalypse lawless land where tribalism runs rampant. Sounds like fun.
---
Is it any wonder that the Cirque du Ordures that is Failout 76 attracts tourists? Shouldn't it be a red flag for you guys that the tourism isn't because the game is good or because BSG makes great decisions? You're a Bethesda Bootlicker.
---
Really. You checked?  They made it unarmed only?
---
Lol that's awesome :D
---
German here, they were off for a short bit and then I had to load a mini patch.
---
The bratwurst in this case just happened to be a particularly long shit taken by Todd Howard, so the fact that you enjoy it means you literally have shit taste.
---
I agree with you but you can just PM me
---
$18 here in Canada.
---
If you want to go Cowboy you might want to use lever action rifle/shotguns as well, just a thought.
---
&gt; Because people like you pay for it. 
---
People like me? I don't even own the game. Who are you replying to? Are you drunk or something?
---
Nothing wrong with you playing it and enjoying it.
---
Nothing wrong with us exposing Bethesda, or complaining about issues that need to be addressed ether.
---
Remember, this game has been updated and patched based off of our feedback. (Atleast most of it)
---
That's how live service games work.
---
No they never did.
---
I had some family walk into a showing of midsommar with a really young boy couldn’t have been older than 8 and I remember my friends and I laughing cause we thought “oh man they walked into the wrong theater! Wait till they realize!” But they stayed for the entire movie... including letting their kid see a majority of the super graphic sex scene that happens in the film.
---
I've been digging The Outer Worlds so far because it brings all those themes back. It's really out with it from the start, as far as I can tell. The second line of dialog is &gt;!"not likely, bootlicker" towards some corporate police!&lt; and one of the first companions you find will talk to you about &gt;!living as a stowaway with the best opportunity being hauling boxes around for the corporations and how that isn't real freedom!&lt;.
---
I swear I saw this same thread months ago
---
&gt;  I didn't realize just how crazy expensive it is for some of you guys I'm so sorry.
---
$180 AUD is $123 USD.  Of that $180 AUD part is the 10% GST (sales tax).  Bethesda are getting $111 USD of it.
---
Not very much more expensive.
---
I tip my hat to your amazingly creative riposte
---
The player count dropped and the game is dying. It is a simple fact. Not a matter for debate.
---
Oooooh, beeeeeer
---
I think you should try not going near Dyer Chemicals before doing the event.
---
Lol okay. I’m an adult with a well paying engineering job, a wife and kids, a loving family, a nice house, and disposable income. I made it to this position while playing video games simultaneously. If anything, paying for this will save me time, which at my age, is more valuable than a few dollars a month. 
---
I don’t need a lecture about how to spend my money.
---
I find on my character that doesn't have carnivore/herbivore mutations that I am for the last week running into an issue where I'm actually running out of food to the point I have to go around and pick berries and stuff in whatever area I'm in just to replenish my food enough to fast travel back to my camp. I shouldn't have to leave my camp with 30 purified waters and 20 meat steaks to last me a play session, it just didn't used to be that way.
---
I can only speak personally but the few times I've seen in game protests (or out of game for that matter) I've not felt that way. 
---
Perhaps it's my psychological makeup but if I see something like that I'm inclined to want to find out more and be open to new points of view. If I'm targeted and / or harassed personally I'm FAR more likely to go 'f\*uk 'em - I'll do what I want'.
---
I strongly suspect \*that\* is why you are seeing all those posts. Personally I saw all the 'if you bought 1st you are stupid' posts long before I saw my first 'Don't tell me how to spend my money' post.
---
I think it's all the personal attacks which have triggered  the posts you mention. But we might have to agree to disagree on that as there is no way to prove it one way or the other.
---
I bought in after the free week and haven't play any other game except an occasional Fornite squads with friends .
---
I dont really see that as criticism just trolls, im talking about the actual criticism.
---
But i get what you mean when the majority is just a basic bandwagon.
---
Honestly sounds more like your just upset cause you got your hopes up we all knew there would be limitations( despite the fact they lied about stash size limitations). More importantly why would you want them to charge it separately that would just make them charge use more not reduce the price or anything.
---
If you want to be taken seriously at all you'll explain what this 'griefing' was all about.  Otherwise, a worthless statement.
---
Did you actually read that post?  The guy had a workshop and was upset a first player took it from him.  Then he wanted to whine because the first player has his own server he could use for that like we are all shut-ins.
---
Nothing but normal in-game pvp.
---
We should for sure join up, I’ll be on tonight. What’s your GT?
---
"GIVE ME YOUR WALLET" faction, probably.
---
Not as long as they keep making money. First people need to stop giving them money. But telling people this is apparently to "attack" them, according to recent threads here.
---
Thanks m8
---
ITT: People who can't do math.
---
That's not entirely accurate. First of all, that person threw the first blow by insinuating that OP doesn't have a life. They then justified their argument by stating that they "don't want to deal with stupid things like weight". OP pointed out that Bethesda manufactured the weight issue purely for the purpose of selling the "solution" back to players at a premium price. That person then basically said "it's my choice don't get mad" despite being the one who started the argument. OP then re-iterated the clearly missed point then insulted their intelligence as you said, but it was not "over their decision to spend X amount of their own money on something you disagree with", it was over their argument being flawed and their inability to comprehend *why* their argument was flawed. Then you called OP a whiny bitch and said "you know nothing about this person but you're a whiny bitch, it's fact because I said it's fact because clearly my own argument here can't be used against me or anything." Paraphrased.
---
And in Ultimate, some 1 grand worth for 362
---
^^ and this is an example.
---
No one is blaming you for liking a game with important issues. But a lot of people who love (or used to) Bethesda games are worried by the recent events, and how fo76 may affect the quality of new games.
---
Which is great, because that's the type of capitalistic d-bag that fallout originally satirized.
---
Eh, the reason it's empty of humans is explained during the story.  Personally I liked it and thought it made sense.  God knows most NPC's font do more then the vendor bots in other games or are just static objects.
---
If I had to guess its a design decision due to engine constraints.  May not bump into it this late in, however objects with dialog/interaction are not instanced.   So if someone AFK's interacting with a terminal, bot, etc then no one can use it.  Had to server swap a lot early on from this.
---
And pete hines nose
---
Except this was never meant to be a single player game. For what it is, it's a good effort at making an online version of Fallout. It even starts at the VERY beginning if the timeline, immediately after the bombs dropped. 
---
The independent mod support wouldn't be viable. Not without a lot of changes to the base game, to keep people from hot swapping modded characters back and forth. Not to mention that this is a server based game, so they would have to allow mods to modify the data in the server, which will probably never happen. The most we will ever likely see is mod support for the GUI. Full scale mods like UOFO76 etc., most likely will not ever be a thing for this game.
---
Yes they did: 
---
That's a clip from a 2018 article.  I had linked the original the day the news dropped, but since then PC gamer has updated their article and this wasn't in the wayback machine.
---
Hey, while you’re at it why not also paywall bug fixes too? After all we bought the game in oct 2018 and anything that evolves around the core functions of the game are then considered intellectual property and thus any improvements made to the game are off limits unless you pay extra. And if I don’t agree it’s not your fault I’m just an entitled whiner. Great logic.
---
So 571 damage isn't good? Please explain what perks I should take to improve my damage.
---
You’ve just killed video games 😂
---
At first when I read the patch notes I was pretty bummed and felt like everything had changed. Then I decided "Why let it ruin something I was otherwise enjoying?" I didn't spend any money on it, and I'm going to continue not spending money on it.
---
I respect your decision to quit, and I know my opinion is an unpopular one, but without actually spending any money on the game I felt I had a different perspective to share than most I've seen so far.
---
And that's my point. People "feel" attacked, but there is no actual evidence of them getting attacked for the reason they feel or suspect.
---
yeah, I got that vibe too.
---
:)
---
That's PC gamer saying that. There was never any official news.
---
They’re sick of calling out numbers for 20 years and no response lol
---
&gt;Wow, how did you figure that out? You must be some kind of genius.
---
This is like the first constructive bit of conversation I’ve seen on this reddit since 1st was announced. Every other thread/comment is just shameless virtue signaling and whining. 
---
Thank you for giving some constructive feedback with a well - thought out answer. If I wasn’t broke I’d give you gold. 
---
Cheers!
---
This, but no tent. The tent takes the space of a normal camp, and increases the odds of joining a server and not being able to place your camp.
---
Responders! And the order of mysteries!
---
I really don't lol
---
Ok as someone who actually has a job, do 4&amp;5 star legendaries even exist and how much of my life do I have to ruin to get one?
---
Also the meta of this game sucks so bad
---
Good question. I use a VE handmade. I'll try to pay closer attention to that. It heals so fast regardless though.
---
Re-read the OP: client stability.
---
I totally understand it, I know it has bugs and all kinds of shit that shouldn't be there, and yes I know a studio like this should not have such issues, I don't support their way of doing things, I don't support paid services, 
---
I've seen that people loose the staff they had in their stash. 
---
I just still keep telling myself that it is still their first online game and that theyll get this to the point where it'll be great. But I still enjoy the game I just would like to see more people In it :/ I don't mean to defend the game to the point where I make enemies here or something. I totally understand your opinion. Do not understand me wrong
---
You don’t see the hypocrisy in what you just said?
---
I never said people cannot have or voice an opinion. However, any attempt to dictate or control the actions of another is not covered under Freedom of Speech. Under certain situations, it can be ruled as harassment. 
---
Freedom of Speech protects the right to have an opinion, not the ‘right’ to attempt to coerce someone into a particular action. 
---
It’s a fine line, and requires determining intent. 
---
Freedom of Speech isn’t a catch-all to say anything you want. As a Constitutionalist, I am a strong proponent of Freedom of Speech. But it’s not as all-encompassing as you seem to believe.
---
One of the few required readings I really liked :)
---
lol yeah keep pushing that narrative. I am prob more comfy than most here and I wouldn't pay that much for a sub. It's crazy. Maybe 2.99 a month for 8 player limit. Maybe.
---
But you guys need to get over it. Or just go away. It's not going to change. They will never do anything for free now because of their current commitments of giving the NPC expansion for free and various events. Everything else has to cost because the game with it's costs to dev is higher than what they are bringing in. It's not like they are suddenly going to figure out how to rework the store. Clearly they can't manage that.  
---
So just get over it or move on.
---
Over my head it went lol.  I was actually surprised how someone might of missed that sentiment after reading the thread. And it was me who missed the point all along.
---
Yes! Responders would be great, pretty sure Melody Larkin is never confirmed dead.
---
They really aren't being greedy, or cash grabbing. They are trying to keep this game going, and make it profitable. Those are both completely reasonable expectations to have for a product or service. Everyone that's whining needa to lose the entitlement and move on. Not everything in life is going to be handed to you.
---
All you snowflakes are entitled, wanting everything for free. Get a job, losers!
---
The thing is, First users' unlimited storage carries over into public too. It isn't a bonus just restricted to their smaller private sessions. So from a game stability perspective, Bethesda have made a call that it is technically possible for all players on a public server to have unlimited junk storage. And paying for unlimited stash is exactly what many are doing. The storage, not the private server, is the subscription feature that would hook me in the most. As a shopkeeper I have no interest in playing outside of public, but I would love to minimize the amount of weight management I have to do each session in order to both comfortably run four packed vendors and play the game. I would never presume to tell another player how to spend their money or what to think. That's their prerogative. But it's also mine to take a dim view of what a company is doing where I feel a line has been crossed.
---
I completely agree.
---
It's awesome, shame i'm on pc, just curious, wich level are you? 
---
I can't see turrets, maybe it's cause of that you can fill a lot of things?
---
It's awesomely full of items :D
---
I love turrets and i always max them, i love the feeling of an alive camp so i use brahmin and collectron along with molerat from toilet too lol, maybe cause of it i eat a lot of budget :D
---
What does your job have to do with this?

He's gonna scrap your bones when you die, watch out. He told me the same.

you CANNOT host your own server on microsoft's hardware for free.  And you are dreaming if you think they will ever hand us their server binaries.
---
Yor*e
---
Yup and you paid for a game that offers you the chance to pretty much buy anything you want via challenges instead of forcing you to buy things like a FTP game does.
---
It's simple: Children having nothing else to compare their issues with since all they do is play video games.

---
I second that
---
It is John Wick-ish
---
Generelly a like your approach. But 10, 5, 4, 3, 2 and 1 are little tiny features that should be free in the game. I now, that sounds silly given the state of greed bethesda currently is in, but anyway.
---
Doesn’t matter - if I go to a restaurant and want a steak, but I am given a piece of wood with some whisky sauce and told that they didn’t have enough meat and are trying a different material to fix the situation, I would not accept it at all.
---
As for promises features, they have experienced people who they could have listened to figure out how much time and effort something takes - something any project manager knows how to ask for. And it is also bad form to be saying there might be a feature... it’s like saying that this post might do your taxes - how likely is that?
---
I played up over level 100 and threw the towel in. my daughters started asking to play.
---
I started them a second character and try to craft and collect with my main to mule over to her.
---
so if you see "moldy cupcake" be kind shes 7 or 9 and still struggling with the controls.
---
no they aren't.  in fact, some are less server-side intensive these days.
---
I checked my friends list. Most people haven’t touched the game in weeks. Public servers barely have 10-12 people in them. It is exactly how a dead game is supposed to look. Sorry but it is true. No one wanted this, but it is inevitable at this point.
---
amen brother
---
agreed.
---
That’s part of the problem, I think. A lot of people will pay the sub when Wastelanders comes out simply because they’re starving for new content. And with NPC’s coming, they will want to experience it on their own server without 25 other people trying to talk to the same NPC. And it will have been about 3 months since they have stopped playing out of anger. That anger may not be as strong 3 months from now. 
---
I know I’m gonna have to fight the urge, I won’t lie. But hopefully I’ll be on to a lot of other stuff by then. Then again, it’s just a fucking video game.
---
Better than letting the cannibals get to me
---
yes it is.
---
Reductio ad absurdum
---
I don't feel like you are including the implications.
---
Buy an OP gun slaughter the server.
---
Vs
---
No weight restrictions. No more pocketed, hello better gear, slaughter the server.
---
What's the difference?. It's just slavery with extra steps.
---
Some parents don't shelter their kids. My parents never did.
---
Yes we did, but except the Mischief night event, which is not yet in the game, everything else was pre-subscription based. So the future does look a bit grim.
---
So you're the dude selling gunpowder for 5caps ea
---
Honestly it sounds like you get taken advantage of a lot in life without acknowledging it.
---
It's ok, you're not alone.
---
To be fair, at this point lack of quality has become a defining feature of "AAA" games. I mean, just look at WWE 2k20. I had Smackdown v Raw 2006 as a kid and somehow 2k20 looks and plays significantly worse than that 14 year old game on inferior hardware. Then there's the countless other examples like Anthem, Destiny 2, Assassins' Creed Unity, CoD Ghosts, etc.
---
AAA has become an insult rather than a merit.
---
Meh. If he is gonna stick with it then he should.
---
It's fixed with Unreal engine version of FO76, only $4.99 / month
---
Definitely a good deal in the end. I'm just used to being broke, haha
---
How passive-aggressive of you. Must be very mature and old.
---
So im doing the same thing building a gunslinger. Its around lvl 36 or so. Im thinking junkies. Get hooked on 5 things, get 5x the damage. Its not as squishy as bloody but still packs a punch. That being said for now im using a lvl 15 furious full auto 10 mil that is still working pretty good at thus lvl. I have a lvl 45 furious ffr 10 mil im gonna use as soon as i get high enough. 
---
My suspicion is that the pistols are just not gonna have the damage end game to be viable. So we'll have to ramp up the damage with either junkies or bloodied. And since pistols arent sought after you can get them cheap.

Good memories 
---
I wonder what Fallout will look like for your kids :)
---
People can have fun, but if we're showing the developers we're ok with scamming us out of features for more money, than we are destroying what is left of the game. I have over 400+ hours on the game; I thoroughly enjoyed the game till BR and would defend so many of the mistakes they made.
---
You can choose to ignore what's going on and let FO76 become a darker mess than it is, or we can stop supporting the game and maybe save what's left
---
&gt;More importantly why would you want them to charge it separately that would just make them charge use more not reduce the price or anything.
---
Because not everyone wanted the private worlds, but a lot will feel pressured into wanting to play with the premium membership. Splitting the costs would have reduced the cost of both features if you had no use for the others.
---
&gt;Honestly sounds more like your just upset cause you got your hopes up
---
Not at all. The second I saw Fallout 1st I was checked out of this game. They could have had 600 man servers and it wouldn't have made a difference to me. I'm just saying that other games like Ark have already set the standard for how private servers can act as hubs for your entire clan or to allow rivaling groups on one server, yet they offer us an expensive 8 man server. It feels very underwhelming.
---
The early game is rough. If you're on PC, I can deck you out with a set of armor, weapons and ammo for your lvl.
---
Yea, that's not the same at all and the modder even admits to such.
---
My man. Because someone likes to spend money on video games, movie theater tickets, theme park rides, etc. Doesnt mean they are an addict for things that aren't life necessities. Stop repeating what you're hearing on here and think for yourself. 
---
If you see someone come in a thread say "I cant pay rent/my car payment/buy food this month because I was buying too many Atoms/FO1st" please tell them they need help. 
---
Some people are grown ass adults. Some of us have been playing Fallout for a long long time. Most of us probably have good jobs with disposable income.
---
No offense, but if that’s the 3 best minutes of your life you really need to get out more.
---
Once me and my &lt; lvl20 friends were wandering the wastes and some level 50 came and beckoned to us. Then he just dropped a load of decent gear. Nothing special, but it felt good to know that someone so much further was willing to give a little to help us
---
Says the guy that paid for the tricentennial edition.
---
PTS won't help anything because the people still playing are terrible at judging bugs for features, or at the very least fail to hold BGS accountable for the bugs and state of the game. This game is garbage, BGS has become garbage, and the people continuing to support this game are garbage. :/
---
I'd be into that.  None of the (2?) skins for the LE are appealing to me.  A AAA walnut stock, case hardened receiver, and octagon barrel I'd be all over.
---
:) looks like you have a great girlfriend 
---
PS. Are your bases also pink ?
---
Value wise its over priced, just they try to ensure a monthly cash flow by adding extra incentives (scrap box, tent and semi private servers.).
---
It's the norm as far as ViP subs for MMO's, but problem this isn't a mmo, its actually small and low in content for a MMO. It also feels like its more of a game designed for 4 people coop rather than shared world.
---
It's one of the worst designs to he monetized, there really is no reason for it aside from ensuring a cash flow and the games just not and never will be in a state to validate a subscription of any kind. I'll admit I did get it (then canceled) to see if it was justified or not and honestly the management needs to be fired. Someone is clearly trying to make the company attractive to buyers and they clearly are going money first customer second.
---
Netflix here costs just as much and is not worth it, this is even less worth it. Amazon primes garbage aside for the expanse and I still get more bang for buck for a lot less. Xbox ultimate pass is is expensive and I get way more bang for the buck than this, Final Fantasy XIV is less expensive if I only play 1 character and its way more bang for buck and way more worth it. Spotify you can get sub sales and that is worth it, ESO+ is worth the same and thats a actual MMO and the VIP is actually worth it if you can't afford to buy all the dlc's (accumulate the store currency and buy the dlc's later.).
---
But this is not a MMO, this is a game that is not worth a Sub, many of its design decisions and so on have been clearly rushed afterthoughts of a publisher trying to monitized its more popular brand. There are smarter ways of making money, this just feels like someone panicking and rushing everything because their deadline is getting close.
---
Convenience. People buy for convenience.
---
I wish more people would use their mic instead of just plowing through my camp like I am not even there with their gun out.
---
The biggest problem with this game isn't the lack of NPCs, its the people who refuse to engage with their fellow players.
---
Great idea - thank you
---
Hmmm... she will want to go down the water slides

I'm still wondering where the evidence is. Is there any video? Screenshots? Player stories? You gave me a link to a meme image.

Ah. How could he have overlooked that?!
---
You live in a very small world, bruh

Also smoke from generators shouldnt pass through walls, that annoys me more then the lighting

Right, but if mods can easily fix it then the dev's should be able to right? Not that I think they ever will.

Well I never joined the sub reddit soo.
---
No problem.
---
Remember that the devs in their infinite wisdom made this an energy weapon so equip science expert lvl2 to make crafting 'cheaper'.
---
Conversely if you have the 'Grounded' mutation it will negatively impact the damage.

We had one of our camps there

Lol Bethesda's motto seems to be "If mods can fix it, why should we?"

&gt;make a ammo box that stores only ammo! Infinetly!
---
Would this not destroy the vendor market for ammo even more than FO1st is going to? I craft and sell ammo when I need caps.
---
This I somewhat of a guess, I'm not a FO1st subscriber and gave up reading posts about it as it got too toxic.
---
Does the ScapBox allow storage of lead and steel bulk, or bulk ore? Presuming ammo is not placeable in the ScrapBox.

Can’t leave a sub you never joined.

It's for sure a bigger map than 4 or NV, but it somehow feels smaller.  I'm sure that will change with Wastelanders.
---
No, I mean downloading the minecraft server client and hosting yourself. That's what I meant the whole time.
---
What? This made zero sense.
---
She reminds me alot of Hailey from Firefly :D
---
Really sweet.
---
True but now there's no mod support
---
They'll get the legendary player perk cards. Or it will be in a second subscription... They do that and they'll make double the money xD
---
I really like the feel of the current map. It will for sure change with wastelanders and I am ok with that. I just love how each regions really has its own unique look and feel.
---
Another loser who makes &lt;$100k/year standing up for people who make considerably more.
---
This is why nobody respects gamers. They don't even respect themselves.
---
Yeah, it's the standard circlejerk where they all start pretending they are heroes while whining about a game they don't play. Soon enough they'll have a hundred and one copy paste stories about how someone stole their inventory in a private lobby. With all of them knowing exactly how it's done, but fail to demonstrate any evidence of it.
---
Allright Mr. Doom, time to find new ones then.
---
I already have mods from the Nexus, cosmetics only and a ScorchBeast mod to prevent epilepsy. Not sure what mods Bethesda could allow that would not bring howls of P2W.
---
I never suggested paywalling bug fixes. Nice straw man there. But if somehow they ended up getting paywalled, I would just quit this game and play something else. Consumers are entitled to the right of quitting, not buying something, or buying the competitor's product instead just as much as authors are entitled to the ownership and distribution terms of their content.
---
Yeah, how dare they need a source of funding to continue creating content!
---
Things that you purchase should never be considered "free", no matter what point you are trying to make.
---
Lol !  Same here!
---
I am now faced with the choice of changing my Heavy Gunner character to female or looking ridiculous in dresses when I forget to change out of them.
---
hell no. I already bought that turd. Sorry, i won't pay for it again.
---
Why have jobs and families, that’s the point. Only so much time and money. No need to be uncivil
---
Unfortunately game publishers love to charge more here because they're too lazy (greedy) to learn how to convert USD to GBP correctly.
---
How  do they know Im a first?

))) Hope the decision wasn’t cause by FO-1st subscription price

LOL, send that to Todd.

Private world having cost makes sense, it isn't a client based instance.  Id wager they based price off 8 active players 24x7 on the instance though.
---
Wow. I’m actually impressed with how dumb that is.
---
I can imagine it. I live it. Why not imagine coming up with a new way to say something on Reddit while we're at it?
---
Thanks, you can stop spam me these worthless links now.
---
Why on two accounts? Do you have Xbox Game Sharing set up?
---
I would like for players to be able to initiate votes for ALL events and then that event gets bumped up on the list to spawn sooner or spawn after the vote is complete.
---
How much did Bethesda pay you to post this comment?
---
How could you feel so entitled as to receive any future bug fixes to 76? That’s insane. That would be like expecting to receive gameplay improvements to an online only multiplayer game as the game evolves. Doesn’t matter if you bought the game at full price that would still be Pure entitlement
---
&gt;AS WE HAVE SAID BEFORE IF YOU WANT A PRIVATE SERVER THEN IT WILL BE PART OF A SERVICE THAT WE PROVIDE AT SOME POINT AFTER LAUNCH BECAUSE THAT IS HOW IT WORKS

Here's another tweet from him in September.
---
Don't think any sane person is upset about hosting or having to pay for it - so far the feedback i see on the front page is about the 1st membership. People are also genuinely upset about the blatant lying, how some users can look past that is beyond me. 
---
* Weren't be assured by not only Todd Howard, but also Pete Hines there would be no paid-for in game services or items? 
---
* Weren't we also told that stash limit couldn't possibly be increased anymore because it caused server stability issues.
---
* And weren't we told that we would get private servers? What we got were "not-so-private worlds" that really isn't a new session.
---
I've been playing video games a long time, i've played greater games than fallout 76 and have seen them go down this path. They promise no p2w, and then they mask it in "p2convenience", then the brainwashed community defends it to their last breath. And next thing you know it's full blown p2w features and we're being told "it's not a big deal". If people are really okay with 1st membership, i guarantee it'll only get worse.
---
Yeah okay, you don't get to pick and chose the definition of p2w. And again even if all that wasn't enough, what really rubs me the wrong way is the blatant lying.
---
Right right, because we don't have any responsibility towards what we spend as long as it makes us happy right? Good ol' capitalism.
---
Hit me up
---
They wouldn’t necessarily need to charge more just set up a percentile each part of the current subscription is worth and sell it as tiered. I wouldn’t trust them not to try using switching to that model as an excuse to inflate the price though
---
thanks bud.  whats your character name, i will add you as well.
---
I fully anticipate mod support will be paid-for only mods from a creation clue/atom store page. New quests weapons, NPCs,locations etc. All the stuff players used to get years of play out of the single player bethesda games will get locked behind two pay walls (the sub and the mod itself). I can see nexus doing reskins and the odd QoL mod but I think anything meaty is going to be available only to subscribers (which makes sense) and at cost to the players (which is terrible). I wouldn't be surprised if beth starts banning players with modified files from the nexus either.
---
They should allow us to self host private servers that are always online. so I don't need to be online when my friends want to hop into said private world. Also that would allow those of us who like to play with mods can have them.
---
But it's not that simple, they are on a crusade to save gaming! /s
---
And this is the issue. People feel that what they want most should be free and included in the game. The only way they could make everyone happy is to make it all free. If course then they wouldn't be able to keep the game running for long.
---
As one of those "fools" I sadly lacked the clairvoyance to know what the game would be before I played it. While I am enjoying it, in hind sight I would not have preordered it. Esp since it dropped so precipitously in price. 
---
I still play, but I also learned I'll never preorder again.
---
Astroturf?
---
This is why I think adding legendaries destroyed so much. It turned it into a game where everyone was looking for the next three star instead of exploring the world looking for anything that could still be out there.
---
So many people missed so much lore that is written into the world. I am level 312 with hundreds and hundreds of hours played yet I still find new stories being told out there.
---
You iust gotta get out of the loot loop and go explore.
---
"Just don't buy it!" That argument was made years ago
---
And now we're at this point, with MT getting worse and worse... Because the whales are let unscathed.
---
I always love seeing dudes in dresses and fun get ups in the waste land, no frocks given!
---
You wanted evidence, you got it.
---
&gt; Maybe the issue is that what people perceive is gamer opinion is actually just a small subset, basically the volcal minority?
---
Ding ding ding.
---
Everyone is over here talking about 'the numbers' like they're flying in the face of reality instead of recognizing that data is the reality.
---
This subreddit is screaming into the void.
---
My bad, just following the thread and I went off on tangent. Can't really comment on what everyone was asking for content wise as that is all perception, but I don't get being happy to have less choice in gameplay available. It's not like we have had a shortage of pve content because of it.
---
Yeah, not sure what he is talking about. He either agreed to PvP, or was at a workshop. In which case it's not griefing.
---
Nobody hates fallout more than fallout fans. No mutants allowed is a great example.
---
I love 76, almost the only game I play now.
---
Any idea what the respawn trigger is on the SB's?
---
Great idea regarding the daily challenges- totally forgot about them
---
Frankly, I enjoy the game quite a bit. The main thing that keeps me from playing it more often is my friends bailing out on me when they say they'll hop on to play. I mean, I grabbed the Fallout 1st sub for a year because I was planning on running around with my friend group. Unfortunately, none of them have actually hopped in as of yet, though I'll be trying again probably this upcoming weekend to get them to come on. And its been a lot more enjoyable lately because I'm not getting mowed down by a ludicrously specialized build whenever I take a workshop anymore. And any time I feel like running into randoms, I'll just hop into the public servers. The performance has been a little shakey at times recently, but I have just chalked that up to people trying to fudge with the servers and/or their server capacities being fudgey with the sudden spread out of private servers having to take up more nodes than previously.
---
I still hold to the wish that they would have put out the PTS either at the same time, or before the Private servers, especially after the Wastelanders delay. But at the very least, with the Fallout 1st, hopefully they have more incentive to keep things moving as they're getting more cashflow into the game than just the atom shop now.
---
That sounds completely useless...
---
There is a story.
---
Not yet and not officially. You can download mods from nexus right now for fallout 76 like server chat - but they're not official supported. Bethesda is just working on integrating their pay-for-mods system for fallout 76.
---
IT's not P2w bECAUsE tHeRe's nOtHiNg TO wIn

Yes... we all prefer getting our story through hastily written notes left in cupboards in an empty wasteland...

It's a game.... Not real life.

Your Mom has blocked your gaming at the router, go do the shopping or clean the toilet and she may remove the child lock.
---
PS: Fine here in S London
---
What?! No!
---
Dedicated server software isn't going to happen and the reasoning behind that is how it was setup, basically it would require a full rewrite of the backend since that backend is segmented into several services that would all need to joined into one big monolithic engine core. 
---
No one is going to spend time on something that will in the end not gain them a single penny.
---
Thank you... we will take a stroll through the woods
---
They should just let us have an option then.
---
The mire is such a pain in the ass to live in, i get tired of repairing my shit sometimes and it’s nice to be in a less crazy area, but holy shit is it the prettiest lighting!
---
I agree, great addition. It gives me a reason to go running around the Bog. Before, it was mostly bullet sponge scorched with garbage loot. Now I can hope to get some scrip out of it, at the least. I always found it annoying the highest level/most challenging area had no good legendary loops.
---
The "private servers" are new instances spun up on an A3 account for the Fallout 1st member. But just like in the normal game, if you are the first person to enter a chunk of the map it will be based on your activities of the cooldown period (20 hours / 120 world items). So if you recently cleared out the gym in Flatwoods before jumping over to your private server, the gym in your private server will be cleared out when it is spun up.
---
So far I've only played for a couple hours and I spent half that time just wandering around having fun exploring but already I have decided that I love Parvati and if anything happens to her I will kill everybody in Edgewater then myself
---
Except Jeremy he's a nice guy
---
Hope we get a mod like this for 76
---
Would depend on how the mod knows their a first member, it wouldn't be aginest the TOS
---
U can store any junk item. It will auto scrap any junk item and store it infinitely. And no it won't destroy the market. Ever heard of elder scrolls online? I'm sure u have. There is a similar service. Craft bag look up details on it. I dont blame u for not reading fo1st posts. People like to hate. Also u cant store bulk. I sell bulk in quantities now for non fo1st. REAL cheap. Need bulk plastic 20c each.

Lol.

It's not though, after accounting for the different values between currencies and NZ's VAT, the difference in price is about 50 cents a month.

I had a unproven theory that your stash is more transaction based. That when you drop in 10 steel, it stores a row in a database that is either +10qty steel, or 10 individual rows (like how it would do if you put in 10 different weapons). That this was done as a lazy way of treating all inventory the same way in  your stash. And that the database queries just sums all the past adds and removals of items and aggregates the inveotry for display purposes when they are able to stack and don't have condition. The reason for the scrapbox being different is that it's a completely different database schema that only stores scrapid and qty. 
---
I actually have a 2 database setup at work like this. Our point-of-sale system is set up to be all transaction based. When we want to see the on-hand of an item, the system does a query that just sums up the total of all the transactions in/out for the lifetime of the database and that's your on-hand. Which means it's really slow. I didn't set this system up, but I do have to live with it. So then I take all this on-hand information and drop it into a better designed database that just stores the total quantity for use on the ecommerce site. I'm just wondering if that's how it's set up for FO76 and the 2 stashes.
---
Yeah because I can shut down a concentration camp. It's much easier than typing on reddit about an industry going to shit.
---
They did. You have to subscribe to get the outfit.

Not sure about most of us, but I have over 5,000 Atoms that I got from various bundles and sales.
---
Its not just children.  Saw (heard) a grown ass man on area mic shit talking first players yesterday.  And yelling at his wife.  To be fair, he was also probably the biggest bitch on mic I've dealt with since launch.  
---
The point is don't automatically assume its kids.  Adult gamers can be an irrational bunch too.

Tbh, I get random crashes and freezes and my pc is well above par to run it, it's a bit overkill really, but I'm running a Ryzen 7 3800x, 1070ti, 32gb of 2666 DDR4, and a 1Tb M.2 SSD... It just freezes, completely locks up and I have to try and blindly kill it on task manager. Stability is definitely an issue. It can be from eating, drinking, walking to another part of the map, sitting down...the only time I think it hasn't crashed on me is when crafting...
---
Ohh, I thought they just reused old servers thanks for the clarification, mate

I was exploring somewhere a few days ago and I saw this really cool caged light on the wall, it cast the shape of the cage in the lighting and it wasn’t stupidly bright either, knew we had one in CAMP stuff, zipped home, placed one, huge freaking beacon of light. Devastated :(
---
I did the thing where you can jupe them into giving you the stuff for free. So far it’s fine I guess. It’s not really any different than playing at like 4 AM EST or something when you’ve pretty much got the game to yourself
---
Ability to have more than one companion at a time.
---
Honestly, if all the shit wasn’t behind a paywall I wouldn’t had cared, getting solo worlds is why I haven’t reinstalled the game yet, I was waiting for that mainly
---
It would not have to be a majority vote. Just telling the server “hey someone wants this event please spawn it” like calling in to a radio station to play a song.
---
Dude c'mon that's basic lessic, I said they didn't lock it ALONE.

I know!  The only yellow building was the restaurant. There may have been a woodpile behind it, but I didn't see it.  There WAS a woodpile though beside the little building being renovated!  Maybe that counts for something. ;)

You don't have any responsibility towards what others spend as long as it makes others happy. You don't have to ruin other's pleasure because a decision they didn't make makes you unhappy and act like a child.

Maybe he already spend the subscription price in atoms, maybe he really wants the advantages.

Grow up. If Fallout 1st doesn't satisfy you, well, don't buy it.

Are you saying this by experience?

In the old pre-microtrans days that would be a thing.  Problem is cash shop will prevent that from ever being a thing.  Heck FO4 creation club made even Console mods flakey.

How so? Ammo weighs in ur stache box. Albeit very low but in mass quantities it adds up. Itd be easier to  be a ammo vendor with that.

It seems to work best for me if I break line of sight, for even a split second, then crouch. Without it, the enemy still has a bead on me and I'm in \[DANGER\]. With it, the enemy usually loses me and I'm in \[CAUTION\]. My experience anyways.
---
People said the same thing about the oblivion horse armor when it came out. This will never be the norm. Just you wait. All that is needed is enough idiots that buy this subscription service and bam. EA is already getting a hardon.
---
600+ hours of gameplay. Quit crying.
---
We already paid for this game. A sub adds no new content, bar pay walled QoL options. It's not the players responsibility to ensure beth/zos is profitable. Had they released a better quality game and gave it the support it needs we wouldn't be in this mess. They didn't. They released the game in a bad state, which almost immediately went on sale, which damaged their reputation. Further scandals have weakened their reputation further, and now they seem to think they cant use the business model they intended (game supported by MTX) so they are now asking for people to pay for the game they already bought. That their business model failed is on beth/zos. They are to blame for the lack of income generated.
---
A) Running a SBQ and silo with a tightly knit group of people is better, because we don't have the random low level people showing up who can't put out the damage necessary to compensate for the increase in health and additional adds. I would venture to say most people dedicated enough to pay the subscription were the people actually running the silos.
---
B) Zenimax has already said that settlements will be instanced oer player/team. So, no one will have the issue of waiting in line to talk to an NPC, nor will they have to worry about someone else killing all of their NPCs.

Haha, almost. That specific wood pile is one of the highest hauls in the game next to Sylvan and Sons for wood.

It helps knowing that there IS firewood around. I appreciate the appetizer.

FO76 is not inheritently a server based game. It is a literal sandbox, the world and such is completely client based - a seperate communication layer running next to the FO76 client is what injects npc/monsters/etc into the sandbox for you to interact with. All that data could be just inserted into the client by default and call it Fallout 4.1. 
---
FO76 is at it's core a stripped down FO4 with different map. 
---
Modding related; You can actually interact with the comm layer ([0.0.0.0:8035](https://0.0.0.0:8035)) as long as you carry the same certificate, so modding would be more of a seperate application running than a .ba2 .. the only problem with that type of injection is that the server has no clue what is happening.
---
Dont know why you're being downvoted. Those complaining about in game advantages over freaking what?  "Infinite ammo storage pretty much hurt durr"  we still have to gather all those freaking mats just like you do.

I wont say the stashbox isnt convenient, but P2W is not what I would call it.

My 6 year old son has been playing PvZ, Minecraft and Roblox since he was 4.  He now plays Secret Neighbor, Dead by Daylight and Fallout with his older brother, his mom, and I.  Keep them at it, they will eventually get the hang of the controls and be able to keep up with you.
---
I've seen less ctd and lag via xbox.

They have been very VERY tight lipped when it comes to non-NW PvP. I'm worried that they plan to phase it out, like they did to Survival with the nerfs.

Silly them... No wonder they are Seconds...

AAA Video games are already dead, this is where GAMES AS A SERVICE is going, as the hobby expands.
---
To be fair atom rewards get scarce quick once they start needing 7k, and the daily challenges are a huge pita.

You're right. Let's give up and just let Bethesda continue pissing on the grave of the series because some people like it
---
I just completed on a second character last week with zero problem... you sure you weren’t missing the flag up in the tower at venture? I thought my game was messed up until I realized I missed that one.
---
okay, i apologize. I get it. Someone hadn't mentioned this particular point so I figured it was my civic duty.
---
Thanks :)
---
Yeah but some people feel that their opinion is more important than others and they get to be mean to those that dont share it because "rights".
---
You know, like white power and all that.
---
Nobody gives a damn about the "series" around here I am afraid. And when you do then r/fallout is the place for you.
---
If the game were actually F2P  I'd agree with you, but it's 60$. Also for everyone comparing ESO sub to the 76 sub take a look at what F2P is.
---
Pssst.... some super simple QoL and Bug Fixes... this game **would** be profitable. No question in my mind. There is no middle ground when a broken light bulb in a bathroom takes precedents over +250DR Killing first effects on legendaries.
---
Ah, so there are already people in this sub going "WHAT, IT ISN'T THAT BIG OF A DEAL. DON'T LIKE IT? DON'T PLAY IT!"
---
That didn't take long. Great.
---
I think you'll be quite surprised how many people bought that membership. Almost everybody in game that I see has the membership.
---
 In fact the only ones that don't have the membership are the handful of entitled whiny shits making posts about it.

I'm sorry you don't agree with us and have your own opinion about it.

No just suggesting.

You'e a very good little sheep, Todd loves you dearly.

On the bright side, it got me into fallout as a series, so I’m excited give FO4 and NV a shot.

Find a friend that has a server and play with them.
---
Guess what, democracy.
---
Dude what more evidence do you really need? Bethesda has literally shat the bed. Period. This is unbelievable. They don't need your valuable suggestion. They just want money. They got it before and now want eben more. It clear as day where their priorities are.

Then why comment on something if you don't care or understand. seems like you do care but you really just wanted to rant or tell people to shut up and play and not question anything.

The idea of nuking a queen on a private server is not something I am interested in. I love the 15 person battle, even if it lags sometimes.
---
I got by very well before the sub, so clearly he overlooked the concept of inventory management.
---
I've bought many packs and individual items without dropping a dime. My primary point is you CAN earn atom whereas you can't earn shit in other games FTP or Not.
---
So in order to make it profitable it's ok to lie and do exacly what you've promised not to do? Imagine buying a car for an X price and then being requested to add more cash for the wheels that were promised to come with it, we are not being entitled, we are sick of being suckers, as should you...

Ya, my girls are deep in Minecraft and a few months into roblox. I try to be more present when their “social” gaming vs offline games. Xbox controllers are a bit foreign to them still is our struggle.
---
Was getting that error a couple days ago. My console needed an update apparently.
---
I’ve completed them on a couple of characters. There is always an annoying lag, but for me it’s only about 3-5 seconds. I just stand in the middle of the flags until it registers, then I sprint to the next ones. It’s super annoying, but it hasn’t actually prevented me from completing the courses. 
---
Bethesda seriously does need to get their shit together though and fix the myriad of game crashing glitches that exist in the base game before they go adding additional content.
---
Ohh I did not know that, thanks for clarifying. As to nuke/silo thing, that sounds like a safe assumption. I wonder then, how many solo players decided to sub? People like me who literally have maybe 1 real life friend who plays, when I quit 76, I had probably 10 people on my list, and all of them were people I had clicked with in-game and we just stayed in touch.
---
I hope they don't ban me for my glowing ore and plants, my eyes just can't see this stuff without them, I'll just stop playing I guess.

I understand completely why the stash wasn't infinite, storing all that customized loot could eventually get taxing for their systems. But there is no excuse for junk, to store 100,000 adhesive would take less data than a single legendary weapon. They absolutely should have allowed scrap to be stored infinitely in a separate storage without paying.
---
Maybe I am
---
*snickers* Upvote for smartassery.
---
They hold the blame for making it so easy to earn  free currency that no one felt compelled to buy more. They probably did that in good faith, assuming that people would feel more like purchasing atoms if they didn't feel forced to do so. That model failed.
---
It's still on us for not supporting a game we "love" so much. We've all played other online games, we all know what the typical costs associated with that are. We all know that the upfront coat wasn't going to support the game forever.
---
They aren't making anyone do anything. It's a totally optional subscription, and none of the perks of it hinder anyone else from playing the game the same way they always have. It just allows those of us that take our passion for the franchise a little more seriously to help contribute to the betterment of the game as a whole. 
---
Stop over reacting. Bethesda has literally NEVER released any game in a perfect state. That's the nature of the engine they use, the take away from that is no other game will give you the same open world experience, nor allow you to fully interact with the world around you the same way. 
---
The outrage over this is ridiculous. Several of these "scandals" have been completely manufactured. Those of you having a conniption right now are just the vocal minority. Realize this, and move on. I'm sure there's a soapbox somewhere you can stand on.
---
This is the most wholesome thing I've seen on this sub in a while.  Everyone gets upvotes.
---
Only work around I know of I putting the stuff you don't want to break down on a mule... or in vending machine for 25k.
---
Honestly on the backend of the item server I have no idea how it's stored - whether SQL based or ORM, from where it leaves the server it has transformed into json structures.
---
DB wise.. transactional style would make sense, but.... since Bethesda has the utmost problems with restoring data and stuff cannot be recalled I got this feeling that it isn't transaction based (one could easily rollback on playerId, itemId + time) - yet if beth restores a player it's always the full player state.
---
It’s nice to see something that isn’t toxic finally written for discussion on Reddit. Thank you for sharing
---
Fingers crossed I am just being pessimistic!
---
Fair enough forgot that part
---
Private servers, not Private World. This is why you idiots get scammed so easily.
---
If people want to purchase 1st they should not be ashamed to do so because some other people think it will ruin video games forever. You cannot simply claim something is true, and predict the future btw, by posting it on reddit. Not how real life works.
---
Bethesda is still a great company, they do nothing but give the community what it keeps asking for. But because they need money for those things to happen somehow they are monsters? Get real...
---
Ps. You do realize how jealouse you sound just by posting this.
---
Yes, the explosive area damage procs the vampire ability. I have a vampire/fasterfirerate and a vampire/explosive 50 cal and have tested this. The explosive area damage also procs the furious ability, so its not the best idea to use furious/explosive weapons.
---
You aint got much going for you if you present your time spent on this game like a D*ck length, Bethesda is a making a sucker out of you, enjoy it.
---
Is this a joke?
---
The game is so weird and buggy, that I have to ask.
---
Of course it has Nukashine in it. How else do you think the dog was able to cover all that distance in such a short time?
---
Hmm, that reminds me. I need to brew up some more and wait outside Vault 76 to gift it to new players.
---
They are charging a fee for features that 
---
a) should have been in the base game from the start 
---
b) they said were impossible before but now somehow is magically possible
---
c) are supposed to make a boring game interesting but helping you save time.
---
How come people still cant get it?
---
Imagine being salty because you play a shit game
---
I’m saying people get a ton of gameplay not that I’ve played 600 hours tard. Pull your finger out of your ass.
---
It's not like the posts are not deserved.
---
That I'm not sure of, but given the large percentage of people that I have on my friends list that have subscribed, I would say a pretty high percentage of players in general feel that the subscription is a good idea and a good value. There is definitely a very vocal minority that is angry that they can't have everything they want for free, but they will fade with time. The rest if us understand that money has to be made somehow, and $13 a month really isn't much at all.
---
Well they already said the servers are through amazon so literally Bethesda is the middleman here. But instead of getting a brand new world your given a server which has been taken out of rotation and not reset. The best analogy I can think of is this ‘Imagine you wanted to play another play through of fallout 4, everything is the same up until you get out of the cryo pod, as you make your way through vault 111 you see that every rad roach is already dead and looted, every piece of scrap in and on containers are already looted. Once you get out you see sanctuary already built and none of the main quests are working, dog meat is missing from his normal location and every location is already found and cleared on the map with settlements 15 or more settlers and you haven’t done anything.’
---
I did all three recently, easy first time goes on all. YMMV.
---
Thanks for the information, I like the idea of auto scrap to be honest. I'm noticing fewer vendors and the ones I visit are pretty empty, just anecdotal I know maybe just a normal fluctuation.
---
So no bulk can be stored that sounds fine then, people will sell more bulk on the standard server.
---
How do you feel about FO1st compared to an ESO subscription? Does ESO follow that p2w model for you?
---
Like i said. Chromosome transplant. Urgent.
---
I really don't think having to pay to use mods is the way to go.
---
At least let us host our own P2P servers, which cost no money, for free.
---
First post ever happens to be this one?
---
**I smell shill,** to distract us from the Fallout First Fiasco.
---
Not sure about England, but Scott Land you can I ly but a pack of 12. In America you can buy a bottle of 500,thats why the price is more haha
---
Thanks for that, I'm experimenting now with things I never thought about before.
---
Well its a mmo style subscription so they might offer a trail period like ESO for a few days now and then. But otherwise no, look how many people brought it.
---
I don’t have fallout first, but I have had that happen where it prefers to dismantle unnecessarily. To save something I want to keep from getting scrapped, I pay attention to the dialogue box that comes up telling me what exactly I’ll be using to make whatever it is I’m making, and if it says it’s about to kill that really rare robot model then I go and take the robot model out of my stash, and put it in a paper bag until crafting is complete. Since the advent of display cases, I just assign my precious collectibles to the display case and they never come up as options for scrapping.
---
You need them more than we do LOL
---
Curiously what caps are you asking for your plans?
---
The SBQ does not scale by the way.
---
I could see "private servers" to be paid functionality but first they would require proper set of options you could change to make them worth it, including modifications given it is Bethesda game.  
---
Also was that confirmed that these private servers are merely just... hm, how to say it... just locked existing instances? I recall hearing reports that people have found that places were looted already on theirs "private servers", but I haven't dug much into that, has that stuff been checked?
---
So pence is there version of cents. Just like a pound is there version of a dollar.
---
And a quid is still a pound, like Americans call a dollar a buck. (American who moved to Scotland)
---
Oh quit your whining you act like Bethesda came up with the sub service idea all by themselves
---
With all the controversy going on in Fallout 76 as of late, this story is a refreshing perspective.
---
 I just wanted to thank you for sharing it with us all and tell you not to question your self about sharing a positive experience. I may be a Mothman cult cannibal in game, but am a hard-working dad of 4 IRL. So when I read this, it hit home. Anyways, thanks again and see you out there! 🙂
---
Don't be jealous fella.  It doesn't suit you.
---
 I always told myself I would never feed the hateful sheep but you seem like a special case.
---
i personally like to use guerrilla perks instead of gunslinger. i have an automatic 10mm pistol that's super fun to use. but some perk cards that might be useful are: crack shot (perception) = stability of shots, bloody mess (luck) - every damage increasing perk is a must for pistols, gun fu (agility), adrenaline (agility), renegade (agility), suppresson or tenderizer (charisma), demo expert (intelligence) - depending if you have an explosive pistol, gunsmith (intelligence), there are also a lot of vats perks in luck that you might want to look into if you use vats. also, if you use crack shot &amp; mod your arm armor to stabilized, it will greatly help with recoil. try to find cavalier legendary armor as well. you'll probably be running around more because you won't be 1-shotting most things.
---
Not hating, but I think some people are just going to say that these should have been in the game since launch as well. 
---
Also, what do people expect when they make suggestions? That Bethesda already has them made but will only release the content once people ask? They need to invest resources into making these things, and that costs money which has to come from somewhere. And I doubt that 76 is turning enough of a profit (if one at all; I wouldn't be surprised if it has yet to do so) to allow continual free content drops like people expect.
---
There are those who are so convinced that this game is a money-grab that they can't even consider that it just might be that this game isn't turning a profit as planned, so Beth needs to push the envelop in what they sell in order to keep corporate from pulling the plug.
---
I wish they sold better stuff (like everything in this post as well as the skins people keep asking for), but these (poor) decisions all seem to be an attempt to keep themselves afloat.
---
Fast Travel? I always give some NukaShine to the newbies with some Stimpacks and Rad away.
---
So because I'm accurately claiming that if a monetization method is successful other "AAA" companies will jump on it, as proven time and time again, it means I'm "jealous" of people who spent $13 on a terrible overpriced sub for a broken game? Shit I wrote the post while at a bubble tea shop where I spent $15 and you think I'm jealous because I can't afford to spend $13? 
---
Lmao you realize how insane you sound right?
---
All I can say is welcome to the world Bethesda has created. I agree, don't harass players, but Bethesda's idiocy is at the heart of this.
---
I did notice the huge delay last time I did it. Best bet is to find a server with few people in it or join a friend's private server.
---
First post I've commented on.  Fantastic - go Kaiser!
---
P2P won't happen due to how the infrastructure is setup :/
---
I have fallout first and it's pretty good so far ...you see people like you don't really play video games they jus jump on whatever is topical and type out a book that contains your YouTube curated opinion
---
Can you quote where in my comment I told the OP to shut up? And why would I want people to play or not question anything? You okay there buddy?
---
This post is a great advertisement.
---
Figured, ive been dropping my survival tent in the wilderness and dropping things into a bag when I scrap and store, just sucks when it takes from the good stuff when trying to just repair your camp stuff :/
---
Nah they give you 600+ hours of an unstable mess  for the 60$ you gave them before, don't act like the fact that you get access to the game is charity and that its ok to get further fked by them because of they're kindness.
---
Why are you defending companies that milk players so hard like that? How ignorant can you be?
---
Oh no! Not the teddies, I love finding all the teddy bear displays in people's camps  🙀
---
This is why the community here gets so upset though.
---
Most people that play the game aren't here. They're the type with expendable income that doesn't think too much about what they're spending it on as long as they're enjoying themselves. And there's nothing wrong with that.
---
The problem is that the video game industry is in a place where lots of companies are actively psychologically testing to see how far they can push monetization. And people *without* expendable income are getting pushed to the side and delivered partial products because they can't pay their way into a full game.
---
It's not jealously of other players, it's not hatred. It sounds ridiculous, but it's basically self-preservation at this point. If *something* isn't done, people are literally going to get priced out of gaming as a hobby.
---
I tested to check it out and it appears I cannot complete the order (redirected to microsoft store and the page couldn't be displayed). Perhaps something happened in the connection between Bethesda and Microsoft. I guess contacting suppor would be best.
---
Note: I still dislike the idea for Fallout 1st.
---
This is so annoying. I collect bug parts for sting things and it’s guaranteed to scrap them first before the 100s of acid I have in my stash.
---
It's been ten years since I played.  At that time, it was monthly fees, additional fees for optional items, and you paid for each expansion as it was released, just as I originally described.
---
....? Of course? That was an MMORPG a game genre that is so far removed from mainstream gaming it's basically in it's own world? What non MMORPG game have you ever player that had a sub hey?
---
They haven't broken any promises. That's another manufactured outrage. They said that all DLCs/expansions would be free. They never once said that they wouldn't eventually have a voluntary subscription for QoL features. So, yes, what they've done is logical, and necessary for this game to continue moving in the right direction. There are many more people that have subscribed than those that have left out of entitlement fueled rage. The game has a volume of players it hasn't had in months. The subscription is working, and whining about how everything should just be free isn't going to change that.
---
Disagree. After a while those challenges dry up and atoms come in a trickle. I'd put the blame on them releasing stupid immersion destroying items like a fruit basket hat. 
---
I already supported the game: I bought it. I owe them nothing more than that. Had they put out a decent amount of quality content I may feel differently. Look at the volume of content ESO had at end of year one. 76 is utterly empty in comparison. 
---
It's a totally optional sub, but if you don't get it you miss out on much needed and much requested QoL improvements. You are paying to have stable servers that should be in base game,and to not have the headache of inventory management. 
---
I am not asking them to release a perfect game. I am explaining why I think their business model, which they publicized to all, has failed. 
---
I know this might come as a surprise but I am pissed off because I had enjoyed this game and had hoped for better, and think the latest decisions have detracted from the games appeal to new players, which is to the detriment of the games on going future. I am not just hating for hates sake, I honestly wanted this game to be going years into the future but I doubt that will be the case and that is disappointing.
---
Are you on Xbox ?
---
" There's a lot of talk about that it's just a public world with invisible  players and such.. and that's just utter horse .. manure.. "  
---
yeah i sadly bought into that misinfomation at first before i actually tried it out. turns out what was happening is other players friends were being able to enter the world without them asking but that the private worlds are fully private (if you have no friends lol) and i can atest to that. so at least that is good. LOL.
---
I agree. I wanted a one month for the outfit and atoms. Planned to cancel after one month. But it looks like it was a worse idea than I thought it would be.
---
I think your story is great. I am a military mom and my son is stationed far away. We both love playing Fallout 76 together. He is really the only other person I play with. It is hard for some people to just go out and make online friends and some people dont get that. There are so many toxic people everywhere you go. I love hearing about good things that happen in the community.
---
Spent 35$ cause I’m not a dub first off. Second I get great game play out of it and idgaf what scrubs like you say. Bye bye cry baby.
---
No need to be a smart ass. The main point is it isn't a deal. I know it's a cheaper way of purchasing atoms.
---
Not a priority. Have you checked the new Ranger outfit though?
---
Even when every other developer can? Shit when even Anthem gets by on just it's cosmetic shop (thats actually just cosmetic) and has less players? No sorry the only reason the sub exists is so Zenimax can afford to pay back the ridiculous investment deal they made.
---
Look I'm not tryna sell it to ya or anything but I see alot of threads posts whatever that are utter bullshit. I always try shit for myself first before judging. Buy a month for 13$ cancel it of u don't like it. You can always retrieve your junk from it afterwards. Just cant  put more into the scrap box.
---
Last night was the first time ever that I’ve launched a nuke and actually stayed in the world to see it land. Always disconnect after I launch one so didn’t bother any more. Only thing is couldn’t launch it at sbq as it was only me.
---
Sadly that can be said for a lot of problems in the world.
---
thanks for the Idea
---
Chaotic neutral
---
Yes, Wastelanders will come out... with 16 times the monetization!
---
sneak + luck. unfortunately Pistoles and revolvers are the weakest weapon class.
---
I have been asking for these particular perks for a long time. The scrap box is almost a copy/paste of  ESOs subscription service and well worth the money to me. 
---
Whatever crusade you are on this is the wrong tact to win it.
---
This is an mmorpg.
---
Wait really? It carries over to the public servers ? Seriously... I didn't know that.. this is not cool at all... I don't have anything against the paid features as long as they have a completely different server but this... All the players who don't pay for it are automatically getting less..
---
Okay and? Can you please find me one MMO with less content than fallout 76?
---
I just started playing this game and it's fantastic.  I get the feeling there's some inspiration from Firefly in it too.
---
I'm fine with people having fun. I just figure you sell a sped up game, rush it out and save cost because it's Fallout 4 at base. The profit you make from that goes into having free dlc,. That's why you say it. Then the people are motivated to by reasonable priced interesting cosmetics and that pays for everything else. Look they sell skins for 20$ and the skins they do sell have no colour slider and never will. Most things don't have colour period and "White" is grey, yellow, brown. Maybe if they didn't have a controversy with everything sales would be up. Maybe if the gameplay took the logical 2 steps to be complete and feel full it would be something. But this subscription is bunk. Defending it is not something I will do and there were absolutely far better ways to build the game then the routes they took. So saying step 10 on a plan makes them money, when the other 9 steps failed because they were in bad faith so this 10th (also in bad faith) step is well deserved because they are now losing money is crazy. Do it correctly the first time and it wouldn't have been an issue.
---
&gt;They haven't broken any promises.
---
Fallout 1st is clearly an advantage, which they promised not to add
---
&gt;There are many more people that have subscribed than those that have left out of entitlement fueled rage. The subscription is working
---
Prove it with statistics instead of inventing facts
---
&gt;whining about how everything should just be free isn't going to change that.
---
Nobody is asking for free stuff, we already payed 60$ , we are asking for fairness.
---
Astroturfing is the practice of masking the sponsors of a message or organization to make it appear as though it originates from and is supported by grassroots participants. It is a practice intended to give the statements or organizations credibility by withholding information about the source's origins
---
I doubt that they are paid, but this sub is not a place for even-handed discussion of the products and problems. (The fact that the mods camped other possible FO76 sub titles as "tests" for their sub makes the censorship twice the offence)
---
&gt;Once you start down the dark path, forever will it dominate your destiny...
---
Most people did not realize Yoda was talking about DLC and item shops.
---
No I know that I hit them all, it's just the game would not register my passing them cuz the objective markers were like 3 steps behind my current position in the course
---
I do...
---
https://ibb.co/mDgj6wD
---
That - and people thinking that looting is server bound, which alas is global.. If you loot something specific in a public server it will also be looted in private and vice versa ;)
---
Wanting the game to get the funds it needs to improve is hateful?
---
I'm more annoyed that Bethesda reworked the quest and rooms to make the courthouse and all the fans' work useless.
---
No thanks. "Dont bother trying to positively change anything" isn't really a good enough answer.
---
PC / TR 1900x / 2080 Ti / 64gb ram, back and forth between 1080 and 4k, depending on if I'm using my tv or desktop monitor ...want more?
---
The crashes seem to (mostly) be about UI and "scaleform", and that would make a little sense with how driver updates often turn on "DSR" for 1080, but...problem remains no matter how DSR our set, and at any resolution.
---
Pretty sure it's still the same. You have to eat a melee food buff to find out if it goes past your DCG
---
it's gonna cost ya an upgrade package to your 1st member subscription for $10 extra.
---
Lol yeah Jim's great 👍🏻
---
I love this post
---
Have an imaginary reddit award
---
That sucks, I was running the mansion mystery mission and ran into a much higher level player. They waved, i Waved, we watched each other’s backs while using the terminal, and went our separate ways... not a word was said.... don’t know if he was a fo1st player, and I don’t care, good times
---
Thanks a lot friend!
---
Imagine attacking people for enjoying a game. You are pathetic. Go crawl back into your moms ass where you came from.
---
Yeah but Shark cards only gave in game cash and not things that were promised that were going to be free (except cosmetics) since the beta
---
If you don't give a fuck why all that you do is defend the game on Reddit, look at your history lol.
---
Classic Stockholm Syndrome, keep defending the company who milks you.
---
As someone who is subbed to soo many other gaming subs i've seen these types of posts more than any other i can recall. Really makes them feel fake to me. Usually after every negative PR release i see an influx of these types of comments "BEST CONVERSATION EVER" "playing with my daughter". 
---
I may just be a cynic but all these comments seem fake.
---
Thank you sir or madam
---
Yup so true, its the main "defence" I've seen actually lol
---
It isn't 24 players. It's tens of thousands of players in different instances. Most mmorpgs these days split their player load in a similar fashion, but their layering systems are zone specific, not the whole world.
---
I wish they kept the previous format of cosmetic item + atoms for money.  
---
Stopped playing when they changed it.  
---
I hope they fix it fast for you.  
---
Good luck in Applachia, fellow vault dweller.
---
Lmao you're taking stats out of your ass.
---
I shouldn't be forced to play a singleplayer game on online servers and dedicated servers should be free for a game like this.
---
You are part of the reason the gaming industry is becoming greedy, wether you agree to that or not
---
Don't expect too much from this old engine, it's already overburdened with the game itself, or even Bethesda to care about such a thing
---
At the risk of sounding salty  (on an already very salty thread), have you tried Fallout 4? No other players to block, no one doing the Mothman dance, and no one else to one-shot your legendaries. I know this sounds sarcastic, but have you read what you posted?
---
I get that your opinion is different. I'm fascinated that everyone went from "it's bad!" to "your an ass for wanting to block people with it." But... how does this change how YOU play the game at all? You still have your camp, the map is unchanged, the enemies are all still there, and you still have to scrounge for mats.
---
This is the Onion-ization of reality at work, my friend.
---
A cheaper way to purchase something is a deal at face value, it's not I am trying to be a smart ass...
---
Please re-title this to: "The best 3 minutes of my life with some gamer kid's mom." I'm sure Brazzers will pick up this title and pay you royalties.
---
Hehe jealousy seems to be a soft spot for you i see... Sry about that, could have made it more clear I was just being silly there. Did not mean anything by it, I actually agree with you on that.
---
Its stupid saying someone is jealouse of what you own or have.
---
Oh boy  munchausen syndrome. Who bought the game on sale? Bucks? Way off. Biggest  munchausen syndrome case ive seen, il spend my time on "The O\*\*\*\* Worl\*\*". You keep gargaling the corporate dick like its doing you a favour. This games slow death will be a pleasure.
---
Actually, all the sub does is give you an instanced server where other players can't interact or interfere with what you are doing, and people on your friends list can join at will. They are still the exact same type of servers that everyone else is using, and in some cases as my friend found out last night, still the same server as other public players. They are just using the instancing technology they created for the raids and Wastelanders. Yea, they are giving us unlimited crafting storage. That still doesn't take away from the way you've been playing the game this entire time. The sub does literally NOTHING to take away from anyone's experience.
---
You talk like you want these features for yourself, you just don't want to have to pay for them. THAT is greed. That's an entitlement mentality, to feel like you are somehow owed everything you want. That's just not the way life works, and it isn't a feasible approach to a game that needs to maintain a certain level of profitability to succeed.  So, either pay for sub and enjoy the benefits, or don't and continue to play the game the way you have been up to this point. Or uninstall out of anger over the perceived slight against you, and move on.
---
Now we're shifting goal posts.  First it was "They never said they'd charge", we see that they said otherwise. Now it's "Well, they said private servers not private worlds, so there".
---
And let's add an ad hominem in there while we're at it.  
---
It's crap like that which encourages me to actually spend MORE money, just to piss off people.
---
No, there really aren't any laws against releasing 90% of the games content post-release for more money than the games original buy-in. The whole fiasco with EA and the Star Wars: Pay to Win game was a result of some sort of ban against gambling elements in games. Basically, the issue wasnt that they made us pay for stuff, it was that they made us pay to gamble for stuff that directly affects your gameplay and effectiveness. Which is why you still see cosmetic loot boxes in tons of games.
---
It does. Using a VE Gatling; aoe explosions trigger a mighty healing even with such slow rate of fire.
---
Right. Fuck Bethesda.
---
Yeah you're right I forgot no positive change has ever come from reddit my bad 🙄
---
Imagine attacking someone who critized a Company for a huge Globally contravertial move, and then going all defensive when he is being questioned for why he is on board with said company.
---
Did you actually read anything I wrote?
---
Take workshop while crouched, then leave, check map before attempting first defence event or allow to cycle for less NPCs, enter from outside area, Berry Mentats to help see players. 
---
If all is clear, while crouched do your building stuff, set home mat, leave, check map before FT to harvest, always crouch. But expect to be caught out and killed.
---
It just works ;)
---
Lol indeed...
---
Thats insane , how could they possible try to pull that shit on us
---
Yes I'm aware, but it doesn't mean I'm also not open to the possibility that it isn't like that and it's just poor management. I'm not defending them. I'm with everyone else and just as pissed considering I've been backing the game and enjoying it since beta, but it doesn't mean I can't throw out suggestions on how they could make things better even though I know they aren't gonna do any of it. It still wouldn't be great, but it wouldn't be as bad as them charging what they are for a game that's had no new gameplay content since launch.
---
The only times Ive gone private so far was once so I could check it out....ran a nuke on whitespring w a rando I friended at my camp.  Then again last night when I hit max caps with my vending well stocked.  Jumped into a private world to see if I could find Grahm and get the signs and letters plan. No go so I bought a serum recipe instead. It was honestly really empty and boring.  Private servers werent my main reason to sub though.  Its all about that sweet robot dance emote.  (Kidding)
---
Maybe. My PSN is Kazamati :)
---
No need for the personal insults iSweety.
---
The only idiot here is you,acting like a unhinged  Child.
---
Grow up and act like an adult.
---
Yeah maybe, at least I am not going around bragging about it.
---
It’s definitely not a problem on my end. It’s very well known that fo76 crashes constantly.
---
cept private worlds i understand a subscription for that as most private server hosting isnt free. sure the tools to make your own would be nice but maybe someday (SOON) TM
---
maybe when the game is no longer profitiable for them they are like fuck it and release the server tools and mod tools and say we are done have it at kids. and we the community can "fix" the game
---
The game is fun. Nothing is P2W. I paid 35$ and have played it for a year. Pretty obvious why anyone would defend it. You just aren’t smart enough to figure that out.
---
Have an imaginary reddit award from me too
---
Fallout what? I'm off to harvest my carrots...

Yes that's why I'm so disappointed. I don't like an unequal playing field when it comes to fundamental features that affect gameplay like basic storage. Appropriate storage is not a premium feature that we should have to pay every month for. It's what we should all get as standard. I love this game and wish this hadn't happened. I have ordered The Outer Worlds so I can take a short break and see what Bethesda's next move is going to be.
---
munchausen syndrome cmon now
---
Yes, you should throw your money away to piss people off! Haha! Spoken like a true imbecile.
---
I thought it was because nobody played it. I never saw more than 12 players on any survival server.
---
Oh wow I didn't know that thanks for the info. Good for them then to stay as pro consumer as they have while being public then jesus these bigger american companies really have no excuse.
---
I was an adult before your dad.
---
Impossible.  He won and you lost, don't you know.  He's rolling in scrap and all the SBQ just be all up on his D.   All the caps you find will just go directly to him.
---
I've always been struck by how the most stunningly cruel and thoughtless statements follow the inane "No offense...."
---
Everyone experiences life differently, and at different speeds. You don't know the first thing about OP, their story or life circumstance. Maybe just let people have joy.
---
I submitted a ticket to them, hope they can help. If fallout 1st wasnt bad enough for Bethesda already, stuff like this sure doesnt help.
---
aw man how could i be so foolish
---
You know it
---
Seeing them in game doesn't mean they think the same as you. I guarantee the majority of them only got the subscription because of the outfit.
---
I still say Scrap Bot, Fridgr, and Repair kits aren't even close to Pay2Win
---
Hardware doesn’t matter. My desktop has a 1080 and brand new i5 9400 and my internet is good and stable. FO76 is just horribly optimised.
---
You have just won Post Of The Year award.
---
I'm fine with the sub and cash shop items as long as fo76 gets significant support going forward and pvp is shifted to mostly separate modes like nuclear winter.
---
Things cost money. Shocking.
---
Strangle blooms come out at night.  If you see stars in the sky check for the blooms.  I farm them all the time.  It seems that every few real days I can collect 6-8 blooms.
---
&gt; I'm assuming that modded servers will have to have their own characters saved on them, so nobody brings a lvl 1000 decked out toon to the normal adventure servers.
---
You would think so, but based on how private worlds have been implemented so far, it doesn't seem like they've set up the infrastructure for this. Character data would need to be stored on the server itself, which means the server would need to be persistent, and at the moment, they aren't.
---
&gt; That one pound is worth more than one dollar doesn't make the pound stronger than the dollar. 
---
ok, I think we hit the peak of the dumb mountain...! Are serious right now? Is this a weird nationalism thing?
---
 Even with this, that does not excuse charging the same amount for both Dollars and Pounds.
---
a) It's not cheap
---
b) It definitley pays for server costs of 10 people
---
I would have loved to see: 
---
Subscribe for your own private (or open to the community) persistent world featuring whatever mods you choose.  
---
As a thank you to fans, everyone gets NV skins and unlimited scrap storage.   
---
Complete some in-game challenges to unlock your survival tent.
---
That’s not what I’m talking about, it’s bugged. There are no emotes at all. The last patch broke it.
---
When was the last time you reinstalled windows? My personal recommendation 1-2 years fresh install of windows.
---
And yours, an apparently cruel and careless one.
---
These "to the guy" and "restored my faith" posts are ridiculously overdone in this sub.
---
You could of course rearrange perks, travel with noob armor and weapons if you wanted to change the difficulty.
---
 munchausen syndrome giving out that big brain knowledge cause he called everyone kids. 5D your wiseness gargle it good
---
&gt; Hell the people playing this sad excuse of a game  😂
---
Not likely boot licker
---
"you simply can’t tell people what to do with their own money they enjoy the game and content and feels it’s worth."
---
But I can laugh at their poor spending habits.
---
Anyone who played since launch should get fallout 1st for life in my opinion. They weathered through what, by all accounts, sounds like a total disaster and kept the game going.
---
I've only been around for 4 months or so but it's pretty good these days (though the PA bug was pretty bad as a dedicated PA user).
---
Never going to happen of course, but it would be a nice thank you for the players who were with it from the start.
---
Bethesda fucked their reputation. They didn't fuck the game, it still plays the same way as before...no, screw that. The game plays better because they've made some important fixes when releasing the F1st crap...
---
Imagine, if you didn't have the disposable income to pay that FO1st fee.  
---
All that fun you had exploring because you weren't worried about carry capacity becomes a gameplay advantage that you have that another person wont have. Making multiple trips to break down junk as opposed to grabbing everything in one go.  
---
In order to play and enjoy Fallout like a typical Fallout game, you have to pay. On top of paying for an online subscription (For consoles) and paying for the game itself.   
---
It is incredibly bad
---
Got ya 😀
---
Maintnance for things you already paid money for and recieved broken/unfinished should'nt cost money.
---
Exactly!
---
Yes that was my comment and it still stands. You don't support bad business practices by giving them more money. It doesn't help anyone.
---
Not with that attitude you can't.
---
Ive played 3 NV 4 and 76 and out of those I spent the most time in 3. And the time in 4 was always modded because the game was practically broken
---
Hnnnngggg murica  munchausen syndrome, il get you a flag to ejac on
---
They’re literal shills. Bethesda is going hardcore damage control.
---
Just ignore them. they’re not real people. I wouldn’t be surprised if the majority of their budget is actually going into trying to stop the wildfire through disinfo and gaslighting as opposed to actually doing something about it
---
I don't think we will see it now and whilst i feel it would be fine to have the feature between consoles but i don't think PC and console would be fair because of the m&amp;k, different settings, fps and hackers/modders etc.
---
I'm telling you what I have personally seen. I have a large friends list, of all kinds of player, and most of them have subscribed. None of them have expressed any outrage over it. As a matter of fact, most of them were EXCITED about it.
---
You aren't being forced to do anything. This was NEVER advertised as another single player installment in the franchise; quite the opposite, this was an attempt to take it online. No, nothing should inherently be free, just because you say so. The game itself runs off of the servers, so dedicated servers aren't going to happen. They would have to fundamentally change the way the game runs to achieve that. Our client is just a GUI that sends and receives data from the server, that's why the quality of an internet connection greatly impacts your perception of "stability".
---
I haven't made anyone or anything more or less greedy. These are businesses, most of then corporate, unlike Zenimax. Their goal is to make money, not give everyone everything they ask for at no cost. That's a ridiculous way to look at it, and as I've said before, this vocal minority will fade away soon, and the rest if us will still be playing and supporting the game.
---
The same reason people are still crying about a game they allegedly quit.
---
It's not about whether to defend them, it's about being reasonable enough to actually think, assess the situation instead of letting your emotions get the best of you and just hate on everything.
---
I'll let the downvotes speak for themselves, enjoy giving out money!
---
one of my favourite changes  munchausen syndrome
---
this was the last straw for me i turned a eye at there other shit.But charging us a service which is broken and server's that are broken not even private worlds
---
Better that the millions of suggestion posts. This sub is like a living breathing complaints/suggestion bix.
---
Except cost in USD is never irrelevant for an international market or product where the home company is based in the United States.  Jesus Christ, this sub is full of children with no idea how business works.
---
It's not right, people shouldn't do that but Fallout 1st has that scrap box which proved they'd lied about the stash limit (I know the code behind it but doesn't change what they said). By buying first for whatever reason, whether to knew it for not, you told Bethesda that fine, don't fix the game, I'll pay anyway.
---
People are very angry about that, you supported it. Doesn't mean people should troll you but you must understand why people will. Hell if you quit due to it, they'd of made progress standing up for the games integrity.
---
If I was you, I'd hide the scrap box, not use the emote or wear the outfit. And wait for it to blow over. Their battle has lost and Bethesda will go down that root because so many people brought Fallout 1st. So in a week or two you'll be safe to support 1st again
---
Intelligence 1000😂👍
---
Where do you think Battlepasses came from?
---
" Beth lies boohoo"  we got a serious case here.
---
^ This is it on the nose...except I outspec this. Sometimes it's a CTD; sometimes it's a blank screen that I have to kill through taskman without being able to see it.
---
I get little hangs when crafting sometimes, but they usually free up after a second or two.
---
I've noticed it more around players that I'm certain have shit internet, and I wonder if the game is just designed with the worst failure mode ever: crash on net congestion. Beth CS has told me as much, but they also said my 2080 Ti didn't meet minimum spec so...grain of salt and all that.
---
In a way, I wonder if "1st" is actually an attempt at filtering out poor folks with crap connections. If so, besides being horrid, it won't work--I know folks who play, have money to blow on the game, do blow said money, and live in places where their internet options are few, and of poor quality. They aren't going away.
---
&gt;or at least an advantage 
---
Huge advantage! 
---
Regular players have to compromise about the gear they keep, because their storage is full of scrap. Regular players have to do more work for the same outcome.
---
I totally agree
---
I quit because said actions, i deserve to cry because i feel cheated.
---
isnt that sadly typical of most games and such tho?
---
that actually sounds awesome
---
Now include your VAT, which the US doesn't have.
---
lulz.
---
They would charge same price for both it's not a good idea regardless on percentile besides personally I like that it's one single subscription it makes sense
---
Thanks man
---
youre like a giant corporate entity condensed down into an uggo right? cant really be  munchausen syndrome
---
They aren't private servers that's why!! They are private play sessions. Have zero expectations of what Bethesda will "give".
---
Makes sense, the only people still playing at this point clearly are not making good decisions.
---
If someone makes a mod that auto bans first sub users I would support you on patetron
---
Well you seem triggered, looking at your post history you've been triggered by this game for sometime. 
---
You're so upset you post about wanting to hunt down first players.
---
New to reddit didn't know this...eh I've seen genuine posts before but what do I know....
---
what are you babbling about?  Are you no longer able to play the game without spending more money?
---
So if i think that Bethesda cheated me i'm just emotional? They literaly ripped us off by charging more money for basic features and fixes to the problems they have created.
---
Except the "service" wouldn't exist if no one paid for it.
---
I'm the opposite it feels disingenuous given the state of the game and recent events to constantly post these stories.
---
So the main things I need are Junkies, Bloddied, and Explosive on my Pistol?
---
The game is fun to play, some people just can't fathom how others have a good time. Instead they would rather focus on bugs and pretend it has ruined an entire gaming franchise.  "You must not really play games if you like FO76" is a little pedantic and presumptuous.
---
If my comment was “stunningly cruel and thoughtless” the president must render you unconscious. 
---
And who’s denying OP his joy? If anything I’m wishing him even greater joys. With all the myriad treasures available in our experiences there’s no cruelty in encouraging others to explore them.
---
lol......hai meat me at Lucky Hole mine.
---
The power armor edition wasn't the only false advertisement.
---
You are perceiving a disadvantage. They never said that there would never be a subscription for premium features/QoL features. They said all dlcs/expansions of content would be free. This does not qualify as that.
---
Prove that I'm wrong. I'm going based off of what I've seen myself in game. You want me to be wrong, then prove it, otherwise you're the one inventing things. 
---
There isn't anything unfair about this. There has been no disadvantage created against players who chose not to subscribe. It does absolutely nothing to change the way you have been playing the game. Again, you are the one inventing things.
---
Name 12 people that dont
---
That would be sick
---
I can play the game, but it's full of bugs and broken features, both you and i know that so stop acting so Stockhol syndrom-y.
---
You mean your shitty gameplay experience didn’t change. His shitty experience changed a little. Now it is a little less shitty. But it is ok, as long as we throw money at Bethesda and they keep introducing new and old bugs, everyone will have at least somewhat shitty experience.
---
That means you have barely seen my post history. I have defended this game for months, and all the while you pigs turned it into a gacha game.
---
Good dogo!!
---
You could have asked for a refund. They gave refunds.
---
How is it that I have multiple lvl 200 charcters and tons of sick gear, have friends with the same, and we have fun everyday, if the game is so broken?
---
You signed up for this crap? I hate to be an ass, but I'm surprised you can tie your shoes.
---
OK fair enough, I'm just not in the market for a monthly sub. All the best.
---
pence = cents
---
dollars = pounds (quid is slang for pound)
---
you have a shitty attitude
---
"oh shit this guy doesn't agree with me. Let's just ignore him"
---
I don’t know then...
---
I was going to waste time responding maturely but thanks to this great community I don't have to lmao
---
What the other guy said! Grow up jesus lol
---
What platform are you on?I have an extra.
---
mention one mmo that does not have a subscription service
---
Nobody wins playing this game, we all just march on like hoarding hobos building our paradise made of scrap.
---
I don't need to smoke a cigarette to know it's a bad idea
---
Yes, and I responded. Just because I corrected you, and didn't immediately sway to your point of view doesn't mean I didn't read it. It would help if you were right. 🤷‍♂️
---
I literally couldn't have said it better myself thanks for the great read and saving me time lol 👍🏻
---
I’m pretty sure the overseer questline is in side missions.. just saying. The main quest ends when you launch a nuke (Death From Above)
---
It's a Fallout game. They all have bugs.
---
Perk loadouts
---
Once the mods are replaced, yes
---
I don't get your argument, is it sarcasm?
---
Both your examples mean exactly the same thing
---
&gt;How is it that I have multiple lvl 200 charcters and tons of sick gear, have friends with the same, and we have fun everyday if the game is so broken?
---
You can have fun with broken games, doesnt mean it's not broken,
---
Answer this, do you see the amounts of bugs in the game legitimate?
---
K, thanks for that. That’s obviously the help that I was looking for.
---
It approximately means "I wanted what you guys got for 15 bucks, but for free, because I wanna be cool too, but for free".
---
Since you cannot possibly "win" in a coop survival game.
---
You can't say that they're milking a topic dry when it keeps having fuck ups.  The field is ripe with new topics of fuckery, and always will be.  I mean, with the shitshow that was FO3, FO4, it's just going to get worse with 76.
---
munchausen syndrome and muricanitis not alot of hope for you
---
Wow Bethesda stuff doesn't work right? Maybe if you pay them more they'll fix this feature for you.
---
Because I am tired of being lied to and treated as an idiot. Downvote me to oblivion for that.
---
My game never crashed, the problem is on your end, I'm pretty sure bethesda can't really do anything about it (unless you're playing on ps4 or xbox)
---
How do you know he had repair kits?
---
I'm on PC too. I have no idea why you're getting downvoted! Unless folks think you're talking about reporting legacy legendaries you get them pulled? I don't agree with doing that...but I don't think that's what you're saying.
---
They may make the game unstable, but so does everything! The servers get unstable when a lot of requests are spammed at them, but that's what most endgame weapons do, so...wtf?
---
Lol. The changes to the courthouse are for the better. Since you go there as both a low level and a higher level it makes sense to separate the areas and enemies. Why do you need a guide?
---
Nah, you never complete the quest with the holotapes, it stays active, even bethesda themselves said part two is in wastelanders lol
---
Oh right, because your post didn't address any of my points, and totally ignored why I am critical of these decisions. Ah well, I guess an actual conversation is beyond this subs abilities right now.
---
Watch out what you ask for, we got limitless resources of concrete and we are not scared to use them against you folks.
---
you can pickup 4000 units of lead per day?
---
How?
---
we use low dose aspirin for "heart health" but not for much else. I'm an RGN (RN) &amp; in hospitals we rarely ever prescribe it for anything. Certainly not as analgesia.
---
Hahahahhaha. Man the cry babies on this thread. If you dont like the.game dont play it. Like posting your  hate here is gonna change anything
---
Not for everyone... as I said I haven’t crashed in months. This happened A LOT for me at launch but they he improved stability immensely.
---
I would legit install a mod that bans firsters on site
---
Ah, so now it's time for the transition from people complaining about Bethesda's shitty business practices to people circlejerking over the game.
---
That didn't take too long.
---
So, am somehow level 133ish, never have done a nuke and just wander about most of the time. There are two missle turretts in there somewhere. And with my Brahmin too my budget is completely spent
---
Dave, Sandra, Pedro, Tim, Greg, Matt, Carlos, Eric, that fucking douche Kevin, Gary, Gaary, GaRy, Gary GaArY ga
---
Agh, this. Why can't private servers have AI scaled to character level? I don't need lvl 5 mobs, anywhere in my server.
---
You should. It will cost another $12 per month. It is called Fallout 1st +. Can’t wait.
---
The dataminers when they did the AMA  said the SQB doesn't scale at all It's just a myth
---
Oh yeah? Thats why the servers are so amazing without any issues?
---
I haven’t paid for anything but the game dub.
---
i soon will be level 10 
---
UNLIMITED POWER!!!!!!!!!!!!!
---
at least in the forest ;-)
---
I found four 1st players quickly. One was cool guy and one I griefed. I actually never said a word and he got all pissed. Why aren't they on their stupid private play sessions?
---
I got this having not played 76 for a few months thinking that the private server would be mine to keep so I wondered out building the workshop areas up thinking I would own them forever but logged back into it today and didn't get my server back and everything reset. So I canceled my subscription. The way I had expected it to be would of been to have a private world given to me that I can keep forever but it just gives you a new private server when you log in so I don't see the point
---
an internet historian, if you will
---
People who have the money to spend and a lack of critical thinking skills defend this to the end
---
I like the idea. If that was the game exept you could play with a couple of friends somewhere from 4-8 that would be really cool
---
76 isn't an mmo.
---
munchausen syndrome we cant all be unique special snowflakes like you , most people just trying to live thier life without the gvt or corps shoving their greasy dicks down your throat, we dont all have nonexistant gag reflexes like you.
---
Yea we do but we don't use that as an excuse to be cheap.
---
Thank you ;)
---
This means “I paid $15 into a scam to feel superior to other people”
---
I would actually buy a mod that bans firsters on sight
---
I ser people asking simple requests all the time the only time it goes south is when beth shits the bed with an update
---
There are definitely games I can’t take full advantage of because they’re cost prohibitive. And really, I don’t buy many games in general...the last new game I bought was Spider-Man. 
---
I may not be able/willing to pay for FO1st beyond a few months, but it’s interesting how it’s changed the dynamic and atmosphere of the game.
---
Thanks for proving my point Corporationzombie, its very easy yea you You do it then- is the reason we are in this mess in the first place. Stay recreationally angered by things that dont matter. But at all. Nice and distracted is the perfect sheep
---
Because they have the lowest of standards and can find enjoyment in anything
---
Oh? What non MMORPG game has had a subscription? Can you please list all of them since there's been so many apparently?
---
I am not feeling superior, I am superior. I am First. B)
---
Dont worry im gonna send him a link for munchausen syndrome. He calls everyone kids so hes gonna be old and mature af he'll be able to google.
---
Ya especially when that’s what they said initially. The nice thing is well always know they didn’t lie about one thing: they’ll never make this game free to play. If the option doesn’t involve directly giving them cash, they won’t do shit for the game and are willing to lie to your face about it.
---
Same game, but offline and the dwellers are NPC’s.
---
Yeah I know but I’m saying I’m also positive the holotape quest for the overseer is a side quest it’s under side quests not main. That’s what I’m saying. It’s obviously part of the story but the main story is about the scorched plague in Appalachia &amp; stopping the scorchbeasts terror on the region. Overseer holotape questline obviously gives you a ton of info about the world &amp; will continue with Wastelanders but I don’t think that’s a main questline
---
Why is breaking the $12.00 up into more palitable small amounts for the different parts a bad idea assuming they didn’t use this as an excuse to inflate prices? There are five different aspects of the subscription I can remember off the top of my head the bonus atoms could be saved for only people who buy the whole shebang that you prefer
---
Go the junkies route man. You get +50% damage without having to remain at a low level of health. Plus cowboys love booze and drugs.
---
And faster fire rate &gt; explosive: If possible.
---
..wait what?
---
How does being an apologist for a corporation that continually lie and force their half baked monetization schemes down your throat feel?
---
Unfortunately you need to pay the sub to access mods, jokes on you, sir.
---
“Yes but how can I sell your idea to the player base?” -Bethesda, probably.
---
Think about what's still actively posting on /r/fo76. Most people who were lukewarm at best toward the game have already left.
---
Lul munchausen syndrome its insane overwatch and league are still going. Leagues 10 year old munchausen syndrome, crazy how fact be facts
---
Yes but keep in mind its bethesda they dont know what they are doing
---
the drug dealer is Bethesda and the users who keep buying this crap are users. This has gone too far and it needs to stop. When its play to win and your purposefully limit storage only to then sell it. That bs and I am blaming the addicts in this who keep feeding them reasons to do this. The game is like the neighborhood we all live and and crackheads are ruining everything.
---
Imagine being on a sub bitching about a game you don’t play lmao. What a fucking joke.
---
real time global illumination = fail
---
;-)
---
Yeah but that's the same experience
---
Have fun paying activisions tax while trying to defend how poor they are LOL oh boy 😔
---
People jus repeat buzzwords they hear
---
Amazon Prime is the real comparison against Fallout 1st, since they are essentially the same cost (as a non-student)
---
But value-wise, not even comparable.
---
Oh im on PS4!
---
I don't have a mom I have a mum. Also she died twenty years ago.
---
There's no lootboxes, so it's not a gacha game.  
---
And I saw enough post history, it's kinda funny the 180 that happened - and again, to be SOOOO mad as to say you want to hunt subscribers down.  
---
Maybe we should take a quote of yours:
---
&gt;There's only one group that profits from creating outrage. Play what you like, have fun. Don't let these people dictate what you should consider fun.
---
thanks :) Mine came back up eventually too
---
cmon munchausen syndrome thats not a cohesive argument.
---
The fucking problem is that is satisfies anyone at all. Its utter garbage, and you guys are lapping it up like it spring water. 
---
They are lieing when they say you get your own private server, its not a private server its a private instance that after 15 minutes is wiped of any of your doings. There are so many games out there that offer actual private servers that DON'T cost money to buy upfront, and can have cheaper subscriptions.
---
The junk box? You mean their way to make money off of a problem with a much easier solution that is completely free in just about literally **every other game in existence**. Its been proven that stacked items in Fo76 are simply a single item with a number attached which lets the game know how many you can pull out of that item, they are feeding you complete bullshit when they say it would cause more server instability if they introduced the ability to stack junk and scrap on normal servers. Complete and utter bullshit.
---
Ranger suit is cool but considering pretty much every other service offered should be free, this plus the tent is not worth the what? $12 a month which btw will have you paying twice the original cost of the base game or even what? 3 to 4 times depending on if you got it on sale only after playing for a year...... So not only has your money on the initial sale of the game, not to mention all the atom shop sales cash gone just about nowhere in terms of fixing your game. Now they want you to pay for the game over again every 6 months for complete garbage services. Oh yeah and you got the atoms, you get in-store credit for free each month from most subscription based MMOs nowadays.
---
You are sticking your head under a rock purely for convenience of not having to deal with understanding how badly you are messing up by supporting the decisions of a once great company now turned upside down and inside out.
---
Good job on sticking the nail in the coffin of quality content.
---
Fuckin Kevin
---
I know sorry, i know you need help but I honestly cant believe you bought this and then are surprised to deal with issues. I feel bad and wish you do get what you paid for. To me it's like you buy the most junk car on the lot that everyone says is a horrible idea and then want me to help when you are broke down on the side of the road. Buyer beware, but I do hope your luck improves. Didn't mean to take out my displeasure of this on you.
---
I hate to point out the obvious, but that's more or less what Fallout 76 was supposed to be. I'm going to hold off on Outer Worlds for now...
---
People will play this game literally no matter what Bethesda will do.
---
Very well said!
---
also don't forget there've also been games charging real money for save slots on PC already
---
Pay to win is like a toll road
---
You pay and you get a shortcut and avoid annoyances
---
Only issue is that all the annoyances are intended and the game will only get worse to make "just pay the toll" more and more attractive
---
They must mean something, though....right?
---
Sunk cost fallacy. See also r/starcitizen
---
Who would ever think a company shouldn't make money? That's crazy I mean how can you make products if you dont sell them and make money off of them?
---
Yep, we will love that story
---
Cool? Still a bad game, but hey people enjoy it so who cares about opinions at the end of the day. My comment is as worthless as this post
---
lulz, not even close to a worthwhile analogy
---
A Scorched tarantula. Just when I thought it couldn't be any worse.
---
The person that helped me was level 100 and wearing chromed out power armor
---
I'm from Windows NT. Do you know what that is? I'm from a time where a tiny misstep of code would crash your entire computer to the blue screen of death. Where it would then take 15 minutes to get back to what you were doing. Everything has "bugs." This game has bugs, sure, but I've never lost anything like impatient console people who force quit to the dash board instead of properly leaving a world. Do you know what the phrase PICNIC means? Has the game crashed after I launched nukes? Yep. I just log  back in and do it again. Software is buggy. All these millenials think there won't be bugs? Get fucking real. Even shit as simple as iOS apps crash.
---
Thank you for the explanation
---
so I guess after Skyrim Together we should get a Fallout 4 Together mod?
---
i can raise and lower my cholesterol at will.
---
If it's "easier" than that means a competitive advantage has been given.
---
Which in turn would ban yourself because to use a modded server (in the future) you need to be a "firster"
---
&gt;When the next expansion comes out
---
ahahahahhaa  munchausen syndrome pls stop hahah i cant.
---
"You People" is the politically correct term
---
woot
---
They’ll fix it if you pay them more money
---
Or maybe to test the waters for moving to DLC as subscriptions, who knows
---
The Fridgr sounds like a norse god.
---
im raging you can buy the tricentennial pack as an add on i didn't know that
---
How about quit crying it’s fucking 12$ a month.
---
you only need a nuke and pumpkin grenades, fortunately. mines are a plus.
---
That's really insulting jeez
---
Yes?
---
Thank you kind stranger for the gold!
---
Awwwww yall darn tootin stooopid munchausen syndrome knows whats up. He big brain you Manlets
---
So... You didn't enjoy the game much before, and now, finally, with all of those artificial barriers to ease of play relieved by your 13 dollar additional purchase, you finally find yourself able to enjoy the game?
---
Yes. This is exactly why everyone is complaining.
---
bethesda bad.npc because they priced p. servers similar to other RSP programs, seems reasonable.
---
but HOW DARE THEY! __/s__
---
as far as the other bonus's, yea id like to see them in the base game or AS for a cost, but im not gonna sit here and bitch and cry about it.
---
todd is that you? pete??
---
Does this mean you see 76 as a competitive game? If so, in what way?
---
No problem with p2w mods on private servers
---
Cause despite its issues, it is still a fun game.
---
Bethesda: Of course it isn't pay to win, its pay for convenience!
---
Players: How in any way is this convenient for us? People who are paying get an advantage!
---
Bethesda: Ohhh, did you think we meant convenient for you? No, no, no we meant convenient for our wallets :)
---
The haves vs the havenots lmao
---
I've compared notes with a lot of folks, and we're all seeing the game crashes. Plenty of youtubers are suffering these crashes too.
---
Good for you that you're not having any problems! That doesn't mean that there isn't a problem, or that Bethesda doesn't need to address it.
---
Xbox sry.I would look in peoples vendors considering the plan would have a chance to drop during meat week
---
Modders will fix it. Unless mods stay locked behind a subscription fee, that is.
---
like i said befor im happy with the game and content,the sun goes up for free
---
Whoa, keep calm there Karl Marx.
---
People are justified to voice their frustrations over this game just as you are justified to voice your opinion in this post. Neither are wrong. The fun circle is people posting “this game is bad” and others responding “well I enjoy this game” and the never ending cycle. Nobody is getting anywhere with these convos
---
Good point.
---
$30 for a rare gun is totally worth it. It helps give players a sense of pride and accomplishment.
---
So try to get my hands on a pistol that has Bloddied and Junky. What type of pistol should I aim to get? Like I want revolvers because those are cool but are they good?
---
👍🏻😂
---
That is what he is trying to for I believe.
---
But it’s offline lol
---
I don't agree with the content of Fallout 1st, but it's not a reason to bully those who like it !
---
We aren't speaking of whether Fallout 1st is good or not, we are speaking of people launching the game to go bully those who are alright with it and are having fun !
---
Furthermore, it's stupid AF : instead of uninstalling the game or not launching it at all, making their stats go down, you are launching the game for that, making their stats go up !
---
It does make a lot of sense to me, too. I think there are some incredibly hard working people on the dev side of things, and I just have a much easier time imagining all of these out of touch fuck-ups coming from Zenimax, who have zero interest in playerbase or community or franchise reputation or anything (outside of it affecting their revenue stream.) 
---
The big thing that moving to subscriptions brings is a steady revenue stream instead of a spike every 4 years or so. That, to me, seems like an investor/board of director type motivation.
---
In the end, I suspect the main issue is that the original business model with the atom shop cosmetics probably did not work well. I mean, in a game that sold only a few million copies, has very little social interaction (so not many people see or care about what the player's character and camp look like), and where the microtransaction currency can be earned with gameplay, I doubt those cosmetics are a particularly good seller in terms of real money spent. I always thought, even in 2018, that the pre-release promises that this will fund years of free content (including annual expansions comparable to Far Harbor or Nuka World) were overly optimistic in the long term.
---
I would and have paid for Fallout DLC’s. However, I’m opting out of Fallout 1st. It’s not something I see any value in, but that’s me. Let people make their choices.
---
Can you name me one non MMORPG video game that has a subscription...?
---
I look at it like I’ve bought atoms in the past for items I want, and I know that the game will die unless people spend some money in the atom store, or if they charge for dlc. The price for a one month subscription is basically the same price as buying 1650 atoms, so I want to try it for one month for the outfit, and atoms that I would have bought anyway. The private servers are just a bonus to that. I already set my recurring payments to off so it cancels after the first month. 
---
Now, I just need to get access for those atoms and costume, and then, maybe I’ll submit a ticket asking for help with tying my damned shoelaces! 😂
---
Enough already eh?
---
That is so sweet.  Your daughter sounds adorable! 
---
I also make pretty pink bases. I’ve ever made one that wasn’t “girly”.  However I’m 30! 😂
---
not saying they don't exist but I've only seen them as mods. I currently have the bright version on my T-51 b
---
I don't pick it up. I make it. Lucky Hole mine. I'm assuming you don't know about that place.
---
You remember when this community was nice and generous? Really? Because I’ve been here since launch and it’s always been a shot show because there have always been problems
---
Which would confine him in an endless loop in which he gets First and then get banned for eternity.
---
&gt;The subscription doesn’t hurt anyone at all
---
It does, though. The entire fact that it exists and people are paying for it hurts the health and future of monetization in the video game industry. Exactly like everyone has been saying about this game and the way it tries to monetize itself from day 1. 
---
I don't understand how this conversation is even still going on. It's a pretty simple concept.
---
Oh what other games are doing the same thing? What other non MMORPG games have done this?
---
God of empty fridges and freezer burned meats
---
Bait
---
Yus. Activate hardcore mode
---
pay to win, for me, means any opportunity to purchase power, whether it's by proxy of unlocking a time gate with virtual currency to access power faster, it's still a statistical advantage gained with real world money
---
this includes any purchasable convenience
---
it has to be pvp though
---
pve pay 2 win is just pay 2 win bragging rights
---
Don't show this to your mom =)
---
[https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=pay-to-win](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=pay-to-win) 
---
Most accepted definition. 
---
 Games that let you buy better [gear](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=gear) \[1\] or [allow you](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=allow%20you) to make better items then everyone else at a faster rate \[2\] and then makes the game largely [unbalanced](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=unbalanced) \[3\] even for people who have skill in the game without paying.   
---
\[1\] Better != Better looking?
---
\[2\] Scrapbox is a non-problem gived most of the scrap you need to gather doesn't weight much in reality.
---
\[3\] I dare you explain why items they put as "paid" make the game "unbalanced" even for those who have skills.
---
Tldr; most proably never ever played a pay2win game. F76, as of today state, is not.
---
I know but wouldn't wastelanders DLC without other players be a better offline experience?
---
I dont fawn over the game, but gladly downplay the hysteria.  I'll tell you what I tell my friends who are swayed by the clickbait on youtube and game news sites:
---
Its fun.  There are some glitches, but nothing game breaking (for me)  and it keeps me entertained.
---
Is it the next, ground breaking step in the franchise?  Hell no.  Its more like a fallout themed chore sim.  But its still fun.
---
The guass rifle would look good in all black.
---
So I’m a Marxist because I don’t buy into this obvious rush job of a game. Which only priority seems to be to add more borderline p2w into an already paid for game(a bad one at that)?
---
Weird how many people actually enjoy the game.  
---
Go play something else. Oh wait......
---
I'm enjoying it like
---
I played until patch 10 they killed it for me and unwilling to pay more to them anymore I’m sorry
---
It’s all fun and games until they make wastelanders exclusive to tier 2 of fallout first membership. Only double the price of a regular membership!
---
Yelling at each other is all we got :D Don't ruin it for me :)
---
The best and only use for throwing knives is to kill Mr. Handy Farmhand robots.
---
munchausen syndrome my favourite guns the Todd Howard, you pay per bullet but its oppp. munchausen syndrome you need it moneys no object best gun in the game.
---
Because it's not complaining about the optional sub.
---
Bla Bla Bla corporations bla bla bla money bla bla bla give me the sub for free bla bla bla
---
What's the distinction you're making? Functionally, yes it is.
---
Your mascara is running.
---
Defend those mobile game mechanics bud I'm sure it will get better from here
---
I've only read a few post on this thread but what about ESO and it's pay for tradeskills bags, I haven't been able to return to ESO in years for fear of having to manage my now FUCKED bank because I can't hold anything and I have a gigantic bag of stuff with nowhere to put it all...
---
Ya meanwhile Game Pass was like “Here this is a dollar.” Sure it goes up to the normal price of 4.99 after the first month but Fallout 1st could have easily offered a free first month. Especially since everyone KNEW it would be how they would handle “BETA.”
---
I’m sure they mean well but the vast majority are likely projecting in some way, defending fo76 because they can’t defend themselves for whatever reason.
---
Its true on my case idk if it becuz of this or the fact that i ran out of stuff to do
---
I don't have to get over it. I'm enjoying myself. You guys are the ones with something to get over
---
idk about being a Marxist but your kind is fucking exhausting
---
Just imagine how great it could have been.
---
I don’t see people defending them so much as just saying they still play, or that the 1st thing isn’t a big deal to them. 
---
Almost ALL that I’ve seen at least somewhat agree that Bethesda pulled some shenanigans, despite purchasing 1st themselves
---
600 plus hours still enjoy the game
---
Thanks for the response. I also think that there needs to be some kind of pvp competition in order to make it p2w. Otherwise, I would call it "pay to cheat/avoid challenge."
---
It’s some nonsense term people who spend too much time playing games use. Just avoid the drama. Ignorance is bliss.
---
We busted you there, commie. We have already deployed Liberty Prime.
---
Democracy is not negotiable.
---
I don’t play ESO, fallout 76 is the only online multiplayer game I’ve ever played.
---
&gt;Then you see Dan walking by outside, and he turns and looks at you through the window and waves, and then he shouts out, "Businesses need to make money, right???"
---
Hummm... this should be close to the top. The whole idea needs an editor and a second draft.
---
This is a matter of people repeating things they heard somewhere else. They do not understand and what P2W is or have performed mental gymnastics that are gold mead also worthy to convince themselves that hoarding junk somehow gives you a combat advantage. 
---
Pay to win is purchasing weapons or buffs that give you a direct advantage in combat against other players. These things cannot be earned in game - only purchased with money. That is what makes it P2W - you cannot possibly earn the things for free and these things give you a direct advantage vs players that did not buy. 
---
Fallout 76 is absolutely not P2W. For starters, it’s a coop survival game. Combat is restricted to workshops and consensual PvP. The most important part is this: None of the things you can buy give you an advantage in combat. 
---
The reason people are complaining so much and so loudly is that there *is* value to the Fallout 1st membership. They simply don’t want to pay. Maybe they claim it should be 3$ and not 8$ (or 13$). Doesn’t matter. The see the value and want it enough to complain but not pay. If there was no value they would not be so loud about it.
---
Cause this is where the fanboys/girls hang. Or should I say yes people.
---
I can see that you're not playing the game. Why did you even join this sub?
---
Awe bless em good share
---
well that's why those companies have physological experts in their departements conducting such experiments, to see how they can manipulate people to rob them without them even noticing or giving a shit
---
just tested it, no nerf.
---
Agreed.  This'll bring a smile or two.
---
I almost thought this was non-ironic.
---
&gt; He had the fridge, scrapbot, a 1st subscription, AND repair kits! But you know the craziest part? My game is still shit! Crazy, right?
---
Bloodied and Junkies can't be on the same weapon. There are 1st, 2nd, and 3rd attributes. Your ideal gun would be a Junkies, Faster Fire Rate, Faster Reload speed .44, or western revolver. Steer clear of the single action revolver because the reload speed is painfully slow.
---
Andromeda was not the worst game ever— it was killed because of PC rage and fan boy rage. 
---
As far as the atom shop goes the same people that cried and cried over there being an atom shop are the loudest voices berating fallout 1st. 
---
ESO has a subscription and you  had to pay for elseweir. All of destiny’s dlcs are purchase only. Never winter has a subscription plan. All the Gears of war games charged for multiplayer maps. 
---
Bethesda didn’t create the problem. They’re adapting to the environment. 
---
The suits at the top want their cut. It’s a business. 
---
It’s like getting mad that Macdonalds charges you for food. It’s a restaurant. It’s how they make money.
---
unless you're talking about an extractor, veins deplete like other overworld spawns.
---
even so, I don't think lucky mine nets you 4000 lead.
---
Ok so 44 or Western. Gotcha
---
I just want factions. Let’s put 10 factions on the map and go to war with each other. I don’t understand why this is so hard.
---
They're priced similar to other games, but they don't have the same functionality. Normally when you pay a subscription for a private server, you'd expect that server to be up full time and to persist game state across sessions, which gives you . "Private servers" in FO76 are just normal ephemeral instances that are temporarily restricted to friends of the owner, but you're paying the same rate as a dedicated 24/7 server for any similar game.
---
Because there was no marker for anything within the capitol building, and it still took 20 minutes to complete after finding the guide to find the form without a quest marker. And I got sidetracked doing my own thing and never got around to even starting the quest in Fort Defiance until level 90 this month. The last time I went in the capitol building I was lvl 20 back in July, before the rework.
---
Ironically each and every thing that Fallout 1st offers except cosmetic items/atoms can be an example of P2W.  
---
Tent gives an advantage over fast traveling/looting/scrapping over the non-paying player.  
---
Scrapbox gives weight advantage over the non-pating player.  
---
Private server's give workshop/overall loot spawn advantage over the non-paying player.  
---
Etc.
---
So stop justifying this, while trying to shift the means of P2W to whatever you want to mean.  
---
It gives advantage and that's a fact.
---
HAHAHAHAHAHAHA THIS IS FUCKING HILARIOUS
---
I have 200 hours, I wasn't aware that people had to expressly say they had played the game, I thought it would have been obvious since I joined the Sub.
---
Thanks for the response.
---
I tend to get them often as a reward from the heart of the enemy quest after turning in the scorchbeast dna.
---
r/im14andthisisverydeep
---
Same here😂 she says it reminds her of sims house building
---
That’s true. However, I heard all about how terrible ESO was. I came to it in year 2-3. I got a full year and a half of it being my primary game. I don’t think it has the potential to be anywhere near as deep, but I can see it getting regular improvements.
---
Pay to win is clear in PvP games with gold ammo, but gets muddy in PvE. The more generalizable term, which is more useful for PvE, is paying for power. 
---
In any case, pay-to-win, pay-for-convenience, accelerators, or whatnot are all non-cosmetic transactions, which is really all that's relevant to FO76.
---
Of course it's competitive. You have events, such as horde or UF, where one person can claim all of the legendaries before anyone else has a chance if they have powerful enough weapons. Having a "private" server gives people the opportunity to farm legendaries with zero competition. Not to mention resource hording through the scrapbox and uncontested workshops which with those resources give people essentially unlimited ammo and mats to repair their items. Not having to worry about mats taking up storage space gives people an opportunity to horde othe weapons/resources which can be sold or traded for better items. Just because it's not 100% pvp does not mean that people are not competing.
---
TIL that video gaming growing into the most profitable entertainment industry, thereby ensuring that it persists as a hobby, is 'killing video games'.
---
It wouldn’t the same experience. First and foremost it’s offline. So performance is better. Second, there would be a distinct difference between vault dwellers npc’s and human players. I would love it. I would have no problem paying for additional content from this imagined game lol
---
So, what DOES pay to win mean then?
---
Nobody asked for your help tho.
---
“What do you MEAN you didn’t buy this exclusive premium bag of shit! What are you, POOR?”
---
This has literally made me cry. I am crying as I am typing this. Your experience is unbelievable. I am so sorry for you. To see that a player, no, he isn't a player. A real human being would not do such horrible atrocities. A bethesda employee, acting as a player, would DARE run around with that stuff on him makes me sick. God is dead and Todd Howard killed him.
---
It's as fresh as the game! And I've tried plenty of clean game/driver installs. I've done all the typical recommended fixes, a bunch of atypical (ini mods, removing other hardware, different monitors, different hard drives, all manner of stability tests, etc.)
---
Look, lots of people are suffering the same crashes (and others) and we don't have a lot in common--different CPUs, GPUs, NVMe/SSDs/HDDs, motherboards, monitors, RAM configurations, soundcards, internet connection speeds and types, OSes even (7 vs 10)--it's the game!
---
Thanks for responding. It’s nice to be able to ask this with no spite and receive answers with no spite over this whole thing.
---
Ok, sorry. That's your only post here tho
---
Do you play in the weekday evenings, eastern time? Me and two other friends are looking for a fourth. Usually get on around 8 pm esstern.
---
Pay to Win for me is what World of Tanks has. 
---
You buy Gold (can actually get for silver now) ammunition that does more damage and has higher penetrating power, these "gold" rounds are a must during competitive play. Also, you can purchase "gold" tanks, which are generally better than their silver equivalent tiers, do not require grinding, and give more XP/money per battle. 
---
You literally pay for a distinct advantage over regular non-gold players and tanks.
---
fo76 has pay for convenience, 50 caps saved in fast travel as well as having 10,000 steel scraps in stash will not help you defend a workshop or kill the SBQ. Though I feel the intent is/can be greasy it is not p2w in my opinion.
---
Hol up. You’re tellin’ me? *Smacks Lips* That your dog? **Eats a Skittle** Killed. *Buys second copy of Home Alone 3* a MASSIVE DEMON BAT?!
---
That’s pretty cool.
---
Lol, you are a better man than I.
---
I just give them the shine and tell them to drink it for a buff.
---
Pretty sure you're too dense to understand the post you're on lol
---
No TOS issues that I can think of, but mods are probably still a ways off (especially for consoles), so you're stuck with manual blocking for now.
---
As to vending machine blocking, nothing available to block anyone from using your machines at this time, even if they are powered off. Once a vending machine is stocked, it's open to anyone who finds it, the only thing the power does is displays it on the map. Have heard of folks wanting a level cap on their machines to be able to offer certain things to low level players at a cheaper price. Maybe once they have a level filter, someone will be able to figure out a First filter for you.
---
I dont think I'll permanently quit the game over this, but I've definitely started to play it far less already, especially with the outer worlds out now too
---
don't forget nuclear mines!
---
That's true of course, could be quite a trip modding out Fallout 76
---
Well yes, I only joined this Sub today.
---
they did, and the mire was really intense. I liked it though
---
When did I ever say they're not making loads of money? And why do we care about that? We care about game quality not how much $$$ they rake in for Bobby's next yacht?
---
OP is wrong on this one, but you're not right either, drug addicts rarely ask for help
---
RIP Mum :(
---
\*Please\* tell me we'll be able to hijack the server code someday so this game can be preserved and improved by the players, or somehow apply the engine to some pirate netcode... Bethesda has sounded the death knell of the game by essentially begging for a cash injection, and if this doesn't work, one day we may wake up to an end-of-service blog post.
---
I don't see subs bashing non subs, rather the other way around.
---
Why do you want Bethesda to fail?
---
Do you mean the game is about players fighting over items?
---
Other people do when it affects them...?
---
then what the hell is it? 
---
and then what is an mmo??
---
I wound think* about subscribing if it included some sort of shared character inventory transfer container.
---
That's the main benefit of the private servers I can see. Server admin can be in charge of if mods are ok or not.
---
Keep the public servers a stable (....) level playing field
---
drug users don't ask for help either, they get interventions which is what anyone buying this crap needs. Especially when it affects everyone and you get advantages.
---
&gt; outrage culture for clicks
---
probably LOL
---
I know you're only pretending to be stupid in your comment, but I am intrigued why you decided to respond in that way rather than answer the question.
---
*Really activates the neurons*
---
10mm shoulder mounted machine gun
---
People who like and want to support this game vs.  People who think everything should be free and BGS shouldn't make any money.
---
Nah,  sounds stupid.
---
Are you saying I'm supporting fallout 1st...?
---
Sent a request, I'll pop in whenever and say hi
---
"  For some reason we are letting BSG get away with this. "
---
wut?
---
It's not an idea, it's a simile reflecting my experience with Bethesda and Fallout 76. 
---
Did you think this was about you and your ideology? xD
---
This is beautiful, thanks for sharing! 👋😊
---
This reddit will praise Howard for his courage and innovating spirit.
---
I don't know, it's a sterile argument at this point.
---
It literally was false advertising. They advertised it as a canvas bag. They did not send a canvas bag to the people that thought that's what they were getting. When they paid for it. You know, getting what you paid for? I bought the Power Armor Edition. I bought it for the helmet. The helmet is great, I love the quality, but it's not the only thing I paid for. I like it when I get what I paid for.
---
The canvas bag is one example, but there have been a few more in the Atomic Shop. It's not just false advertising, but the descriptions in the shop are often misleading or lacking in information.
---
For example, the Invasion from the Stars bundle: https://i.imgur.com/Q80EE6g.png
---
The top two screenshots are from the shop/blog. Where they advertise the items. The bottom two are screenshots from in the game. The description on the bundle also failed to mention that the Alien Baton that you get in the bundle is an entirely new weapon, not a reskin. You craft it at a weapons bench, instead of applying it (like a reskin) to an existing legendary weapon (for instance).
---
It's not? Everyone needs the same items to be able to play. When you give certain players easier access to those items it's a competitive advantage. Not sure if youre just too dense to see that or if this is just some sad attempt at trolling.
---
Gotcha; thanks for the explanation.
---
you should try some med-x to resist the pain you're dealing with
---
&gt; defending fo76 because they can’t defend themselves for whatever reason  *what??*
---
Good grief already, it's a damn game, you guys/girls are taking all this way too seriously.
---
&gt;unrealistic
---
In what way?  It is absolutely technically feasible, loads of games have had local server capability.  It can only be 'unrealistic' from a financial perspective.  But... they already made money selling the game.  If it wasn't enough, then I have to say I think that's on them.
---
Aye, watch me conquering Appalachia with my immortal Tent and my endless stock of Cork! Ever upwards!
---
Ok so here is how it works
---
I wear a full Excavator power armor set. This gives you 4x yield when harvesting ore. A typical run through that mine will give me around 440 lead ore. 
---
Hop to a new server and repeat the process. Every new server you go into will let you harvest the ore veins again. 
---
It takes 2 lead ore to smelt into 5 lead scrap. If you do the above mentioned details you will have 1200 lead in in about 30 minutes which would smelt into 3000 lead in less than an hour.
---
Yeah, sorry I was talking about retail. WoW Classic, a rerelease of a 15 year old game seems to be cheaper, it seems. It's a good deal with sub only, which is basically the deal with fo76 now, if you get it at half price, then choose to sub every month.
---
*"You mean actually making a good game? Why do you think it's addictive in the first place?"*
---
Did I really build a strawman out of interpreting these rethorical questions as you thinking addictive games are addictive because they're good? Or did you add a retcon with "addictiveness was an aspect of [a game being good]"?
---
But I agree, there is a level of psychology in the making of a passionate, creative artwork of a game as well, and I can't debate the difference in quality between Candy Crush and, say, Ocarina of Time., except maybe the levels of dopamine kicks you get would be on the scale of orgasming during sex compared to an orgasm for jacking off. Dopamine releases is key to addiction as well, which is why I mentioned psychologists developing WoW, because every detail is built towards addiction, like the sound and visuals from leveling up, the rewards, the amount of grinding necessary, and the fact that it's online and you can constantly compare your progress with your environment.
---
I could say the same for fo76, but the addictive element there is (to me) cosmetics of the character and the camp, not levels, gear score and rank (which are all just numbers) which are way easier to make addictive. Disregarding mount and transmog collecting here, which also are aspects of WoW that people find addicting. But mount collecting is also a number (like 273/576).
---
Sorry if I went off track a bit, it's an interesting topic.
---
You may have signed up for a PC subscription by mistake. I signed up for 1st through the Beth.net site, and it directs you to the Microsoft site to purchase.
---
The only sub service available through the Bethesda site directly is for the PC.
---
You bought a private server and now you're asking people to join it.
---
Madness lol.
---
Alright, shill.
---
Pay to win is paying to have a clear advantage over people who doesnt pay.
---
By technicality, the junk storage IS pay to win.
---
It's just honestly not that big a deal. 
---
I get upset when people can pay for better stats. ( buying gear, stat boosters, locking upgrade mats behind a paywall)
---
Then don't play on a private server? I don't see why you needed a long post about it ...
---
Find a friend with the subscription, it's free for you to join their private server if they are on one.
---
&gt; c) are supposed to make a boring game interesting but helping you save time.
---
Yes, the game was not done when it was released. They added some network code to their old single-player engine. They did not build a rich world or a working game engine, but they sure got money from us.
---
We all thought that they would fix the game and have an expansion this year. Now we get **a second bill for a broken game** and a few skins!
---
BUILD THE WALL! BUILD THE WALL!
---
for better or worse, anyone crazy enough to still be playing Fo76 is probably buying into the sub.
---
if none of the past fiascos drove us away it's not like anything Bethesda does going forward is going to.
---
What is the objective of the game for you?
---
You are coming across as pretty arrogant, is that intentional?
---
ah ok, i wonder what i changed in my perk setup to change it, ill have to do some serious digging tonight
---
This sub is just a sad minority screaming into the void because the economic direction the entire hobby is moving in has completely left them behind.
---
I've seen multiple people here admit they don't play. I even saw one admit to not even being a fan of the franchise so it isn't necessarily obvious just because you're here.  (although combined with the 200 hours statement  made it apparent to me.)
---
I definitely did. Again, just because I didn't agree with your points, doesn't mean I didn't address them. That's a pretty closed minded way of looking at things.
---
If you pay for a private server so when you nuke white springs you get 100% of the ghoul kills, and 100% of the nuked flora, then that's paying to win in my eyes.
---
Private worlds are completely free if they are hosted in one of the player's hardware.  And if the world's sync is am issue due to lag/bad internet connexion there are technical ways to cope that.
---
But without taking this into account, I find hard to not be mildly pissed off by having to pay more for FO 1st than for XBox pass, when the first mainly consists of premium currency, convenience items, skins, armours and a game mode that they where purposely ambiguous about it and its pressence in the releade. Not to forget that it is a full-priced game with both DLC and microtransactions...
---
thanks for this, i must have adjusted some perk or armor and now its off for me, ill have to recheck everything
---
Check player vendors as the plan could be on sale - it was a reward in meat week so there are loads kicking about I'm sure.
---
Depending on how far along in the story you are, if you have Heart of the Enemy available as a daily, do this - it can give a shishkebab as a reward.
---
It's the difference between "it just works" and when things actually work.
---
I knew from the beginning what the private worlds were going to be.  We were told they would host them, they were always online, and that they would charge for them.  
---
I came into the game knowing this was going to be the case, I wanted a private world so my friend and I could play together without anyone else messing up our experience. 
---
Even with PVP being removed, the existance of other players can make things difficult.  
---
I wanted a private world since day one and I knew when it finally would come I would be paying for it.  The other addons that came with it were unexpected, but I won't complain because I only ever wanted the private world to begin with.  I wouldn't be sad if they were given to everyone. 
---
I came into the game without having high expectations and knowing I wanted to subscribe to private servers/worlds when they came out.  Nothing that has been done (yet) has gone against my expectations.  I don't experience the bugs others say they do.  The Fridge and Scrap Bot are not even close to the levels of P2W that people claim they are.  Not that I don't have a line, but even if the crossed that line I simply would not buy into that and continue to enjoy the game as long as I was enjoying it.
---
Did she teach him how to buy Fallout 1st using her credit card yet?
---
everybody hates us for playing this game. we hate them back. Nothing serious
---
&gt; If something isn't done, people are literally going to get priced out of gaming as a hobby.
---
Just came to this realization myself today, but you've phrased it much better than I have.
---
If only I could buy a multiplayer game. And then pay more money for a single player feature. That be cool.
---
You got a real one now! I'm so happy for you
---
What do you mean by that?
---
Then why did Bethesda acknowledge that the health was scaling more than intended, and limit it in a patch? I haven't seen this claim that your referencing, do you have a link?
---
I don't think you know how money works
---
Obama always used *Folks*  I thought he was the epitome of PC?
---
That's weird my specs intel i5-7500, GTX960 4gb, 8gb ram and 3 ssd's, no crashing. I play 2-8 hours per day depending on how I feel. I had problem where my computer would freeze when I played f76, but then I found out it was the operating system not the game, after fresh install of windows the problem was solved. It's possible the hardware at fault.
---
yeah! its my first gold too
---
A paywall.
---
Correct, but the resolutions are completely different, it's a faulty comparison.
---
i historically love bethesda games, and i really want it to be good, but there have been some spectacularly bad blunders. 
---
it wont stop me playing it when i want to, but i’m far beyond financially helping them squeezing every last drop out of this turd which is what f1 is for. the user base obviously isn’t large enough to sustain on atom shop alone and h they are doing is changing that.
---
not that the atom shop has had any content lately that would make me want to spend money, just trash for suckers
---
It's an online shooter. If you have played ESO that is an MMO. 76 has a few fetch quests, no decisions, limited players per map, 1 set of mediocre dungeon raids, one boss, barely any end game content, no trials and lackluster PvP. Compared it to ESO, which is freaking huge and has all the above and F76 comes away looking pretty shallow and empty. 
---
ESO has an optional sub, that gets you access to 15 fully voiced DLCs, many of which are comparable in size to 76s main quest. By end of year 1 ESO had a free high level endgame map, with quests, trials, dungeons and bosses. 
---
Being an online game does not make it an MMO or MMORPG.
---
How is selling in game gear even remotely close to selling what amounts to straight up cheats?  You sound very upset.  Maybe take a break from the internet and relax a bit before responding.  It might help make you posts more coherent.
---
We will just play in our private servers
---
A lot of people use games as a form of escapism, to escape the real world, and real life. When games start having the same kind of problems as real life, like inequality and frustration, of course those kinds of people see it more than just a game.
---
Yeah, I'm usually on after the kiddo goes to bed.  I'm in central time but am sure we can meet up.
---
Then play a different game
---
huh. I was sure they had patched ore hopping. thanks for letting me know.
---
This game has gone to the dogs.
---
(Also, you have a beautiful doggo. Ave, true to Kaiser).
---
Well if you think that passes for an actual conversation on the topic then good luck to you.
---
Ok then! Cant wait to meet you tonight! :)
---
You deserve it. That post is great
---
Kanye was right, slavery is a mentality.
---
Sounds good :) Thanks. I'm excited to get home and start playing this evening now!
---
Lots of peeps like it, and yes many of them also see the flaws.  
---
Reddit is not a complete snapshot of the community. Many peeps posting here are still salty they didn't get FO offline.   Many don't even play anymore (and admit it) but are quick to jump on the Bethesda hate train   Childish entitled behavior, and they will defend it with all kinds of points. They confuse their views with how things must be, and kick and scream with righteous anger thinking it will change things  Also, many points have truth in them but don't apply to everyone.     It's kinda sad when you really think about it.    
---
It will calm down eventually.   Until Wastelanders comes out, bugs are found both big and small, and they will lose their shit again.   Reminds me of the first year of ESO.  
---
Oh well.
---
It’s to tap into our wallets and take advantage of what we all wanted when we first saw the “please stand by” in 2018. This decade’s new Vegas.
---
Bring back Junk Fence pieces, make our camps great again.
---
\#MOCGA
---
Ooo all that salt. Maybe if you do your chores, mommy will buy you the subscription!
---
)) probably on our credit cards for their use
---
players are like drug users man, the dealer gives them a try, sample to get you hooked then you go in for the high cost once they are addicted because they need it and can not say no. anyone who bought that subscription needs an intervention. Just like a user they will deny and say "I don't have a problem!"
---
I really love fo76 community and players. Please give me another "mmo" game with a community like this.
---
Yeah, I'm leaning to that being the case, myself. Unfortunately, it sort of feels like a lot of bad decisions are made by the 'teams' not all being on the same page about how to best move forward. Feels disjointed, which ends up causing issues for the game.
---
Project Paradise is the big one here. Whenever it pops up as an event I never see anyone attend 'cause we all know it'll be a waste of our time watching animals die. It definitely calls for a well-organized group whereas Free Range and Campfire Tales can be effectively solo'd. I don't mind them being part of cycled public events, but for farming purposes it would be nice to at least see them more often. Campfire Tales should perhaps even have its own timer and naturally pop up every time the sun goes down, even if it overlaps with another public event. I think the same should go for One Violent Night.
---
How does that work?
---
It's weird that so many people in defense of these moves from Bethesda are obsessed with trying to make this about numbers. You're totally outnumbered on the net, so you have to conjecture that the rest of the game's players agree with you and are fine with everything? xD
---
Many people continue to play games they have issues with, don't be an arse and assume that just because someone isn't speaking up they don't care. It's not up to you or I to decide what their opinion is.
---
I am quite mad too, since the game is in bad state, not just due to bugs, they should focus on fixing stuff for the players who already paid for their mediocre game, instead of selling a sub for this unfixed game for more money.
---
BUT I don't even know how unlimited junk stash, secondary camps, and private servers can be basic features.
---
Sure they can make junk weight go away, or give everyone the stash, but at 800lbs we actually have good amount of stash space already, it's not like they are forcing you to do this by giving you unreasonably low stash space. If you want more inventory space sure, pay for it like all the other MMOs would ask you to pay as well.
---
Secondary camp is essentially a walking stash box plus a bonus free ft point, need not to say it's not basic to have one.
---
As for private servers, at current state, one might argue why in GTA Online we can have invites only session but in this game we cannot. Well Beth did say they are actually planning for us to use MODs and stuff for private servers, now GTA Online does not have that does it?
---
The only thing I think Bethesda is not doing right with this subscription alone is that they are again bundling everything. There could be more seperate choices, like without atoms or less some features for a lower price.
---
I mean you play fallout 76, how can you talk shit on any game lol. Especially one where the developers actually care about the community.
---
My friend, we support this game with the Atom shop.
---
Also, if people will fight or hunt down other players, at least we can have a good history behind and some fun.
---
Oh don’t get me wrong, I enjoyed it before. Like I said, I got a few months of play out of it early on, and then a few more months over the summer when I reinstalled. But this feels like a more drastic change than I was anticipating.
---
Also check your mutations
---
I mean the flora is instanced so you can get 100% of it anyway...
---
It's bad all over.
---
)) some things never change
---
That's really the only useful thing about the internet these days, is that even if detractors are a technical minority, people who disapprove of something can still make the company and shareholders quake in their overpriced little boots if that criticism is concentrated enough and gets views.  Enough so that at the very least enforce attention to address something, just look at what happened with Battlefront 2.
---
Look at how many controversies 76 has been through, each one has been appearing to get bigger than the last.  And it's not just game controversies, it's real-world ones too.  There's definitely an audience for the crap gaming has put out designed to milk every cent, that's still not every person.  And it's important to remember that this isn't just some free-to-play mobile game, this is a Fallout brand title, so there are plenty of people who can see the direction of 76 having been players of previous titles and say that it's not for them because of that direction, or the issues it has.
---
If the point of your post is to highlight some sort of futility of speaking out because certain things are so popular, I disagree, because if more people organized together, they could change the tune of a game.
---
And one important thing I would like to leave people with is that Bethesda has never graciously provided exact numbers to the active playerbase, or total copies sold. So it's kind of ambiguous on whether 76 is operating at a loss, is behind, or is a success with a large playerbase.  The game definitely has players, but I remember how active it was in the beta, and free-to-play trials, and it doesn't look that way very often.
---
Also, that was 14 people! Not 12, so my point stands
---
I mean that we are buying this membership in large numbers. This is just going to tell BSG to keep doing stupid crap like this.
---
You might wanna read the rest of the post, other than the title.
---
Why promote duping 😒
---
I wish people had this much passion towards Amazon. The same damage is done, and it's not going to stop. That in which you complain has been issue for a lot longer than FO76. The consumers will rarely ever band together against the machine.
---
They can't even stop the Toddrays going through mountains, how are they gonna fix this?
---
Do you wanna join?
---
You were probably better off not sharing this. It's been crashing the servers. People are crashing the servers on purpose just to protest Fallout 1st.
---
I'm sure there are some authentic posts, but I'm sure most just want that karma and popularity and will make up something to get some attention. Hell, there are attention seekers everywhere nowadays.
---
As the other person said; currently the "private servers" are just private instances. They are most likely even on the same servers as public players, they've just added an instanced layer for the 1st subscribers. Also, most of the game data is stored on the server. Aside from certain people's PCs, consoles would never be able to support hosting a server for this game. Not without a separate hard drive dedicated to just the server, and a bomb ass internet connection.
---
P2W is anything that has an effect on gameplay that can be purchased from the developers. At best, it's something like the scrap bot, which barely gives you any scrap. At worst (not saying that this will happen) it'd be something like 5 star legendary weapons that can only be obtained by buying them, with no other way to get them.
---
Sorry but "just don't buy it" doesn't work here because it affects everyone. If you subbed then you're part of the problem will be responsible if and probably when this model leaks over into other games.
---
I don't want them to fail. I was one of a throng of people saying they turned F76 around, but then they delayed wastelanders AND gave us fallout 1st. Just ridiculous.
---
Unsurprisingly, people are pretty upset when the 20 minute long video by internet historian detailing only about 2/3 of the actual issues *Is outdated with the constant addition of microtransactions that are lying to what they told us.*
---
You don't need to defend a fucking corporation, they just want your money, they don't give a shit about your experience.
---
Do you play maxed out settings?
---
I want what they promised, which is what I paid for. This is ridiculous.
---
Explain how an individual player has any impact on the decisions of a corporation. 
---
Cite the metrics for the percentage of the player base (not just this subreddit) that approve and disapprove of this membership program. 
---
Until you can do both, making the claim that it’s destroying something is reactionary opinion and tantamount to passive aggressive coercion. 
---
It doesn’t matter that the tactic is ineffective. It just betrays the helplessness you feel about the situation. You can’t change it so you choose a scapegoat to attack.
---
That’s the approach I’m mocking. Not your opinion about Fallout First.
---
Yawn
---
man the fk up
---
Probably because the only counter argument you few blind sheep have is "hurr durr just dont buy it and go away dont disturb todd fucking me in the ass you dick!" 
---
Like have dignity lmao my god.
---
You’re attacking someone in the same way that offends you.
---
Your comment, and the comment you replied to are essentially saying the same thing...
---
Fridgr is a hookup app that helps you find the closest refrigerator in your area. My username is MaytagDaddy
---
That might be the case. It had a spot for me to select my platform, and I know I selected xbox. But who knows. 
---
Funny thing is that its not showing up in my Microsoft orders or purchases. And the email they sent me has a link for order details that when clicked opens a broken microsoft webpage. I’ll probably have to wait for Bethesda to answer my support ticket. 
---
Thanks for the reply.
---
The Mysterious Stranger in PA
---
Nail-head meet hammer.
---
they might not have invisible players but the worlds are most definitely recycled
---
its easy to test
---
make sure all loot is showing in a place in public, then go into private
---
meat piles already showing? things looted? yup, its recycled
---
I've said the same thing.. they are catist! Mr Pebbles will have his revenge
---
I have heard that they exist, but I have only actually seen the plan for x01
---
You know whose servers aren't crashing, the ones who bought fallout first lol.
---
Like I said. Just passing through on controversial
---
Doubt it, hasn't worked yet but I'll keep trying :P
---
Wasn't going to get 1st but for the atoms it was worth it. Cheaper than some stuff and allowed me to get the special items from both bundles.
---
Still haven't bothered with loading into a "private" server, dont see the point since most seem like sloppy seconds from the previous day.
---
Plus no vending in private worlds, wasted time to me.
---
Now if I could keep going to harvest cannonballs for my ts broadsider, that would be worth keeping the subscription. 
---
Btw buying cannonballs or trading for them - PSN: ChuckNorrisx100
---
Is it free if we are paying via atoms and have already payed though...? Idk if you were like me and bought this game at $60 only for a buggy mess that wasn't a finished product. I dropped the game at like level 11 because it was so broken. I still get wonky sun rays and graphical bugs. I've bought Early Access games for the half the price and "16 times the detail!"
---
But yeah, I get it. They want profit. 
---
I'd say my biggest problem is the reused assets they sell us. The gated scrapbox. The lack of content. Heck, Wastelanders could probably be finished and they just have it on hold for next quarter for the investors to be happy Q1.
---
Oh no no. I have nothing against you or the firsters but if people will fight each other at least we can have a unofficial civil war. With some lore/background and etc.
---
Reminder that companies keep hordes of positive buzz creators, or hire out to actual companies that just do this, and all they do tweet, post on reddit and elsewhere and create fake positive feedback.
---
money provided by only cosmetic items. just kidding
---
You're welcome. If you network with other ammo crafters you could make over 100,000 rounds in a day. Way better deal than just sitting at the ammo factory in a private empty world as you mentioned I believe. If you need anymore ammo crafting tips let me know. I'm glad to help.
---
P.S. not all us fo1st subs are bad guys.
---
I don't buy Atom's nor did I ever have a want to buy any Atom's.  I am not intrested in skins or outfits or any of that stuff.
---
Now I have a reason to spend real money and help out a game that I love. That's why I bought a premium 1st membership.
---
 It blows my mind that so many people don't understand that and just want everything free.
---
That'd be handy.
---
If they're near a car and a player blows up the car, do they take that damage?
---
Did he win?
---
people are priced out of hobbies all the time.  
---
It takes a lot of capital to enjoy some of the pricier hobbies.  Video games is cheap by comparison.
---
For example. A recreational shooter will spend at least 1000 just on introdcutory gear (gun, safe, cleaning supplies, holster, ect)  That doesnt count the 100+ they spend every time they go enjoy the hobby.
---
A motorcyclyst will pay upwards of 8000 just to start the hobby.  Then the Clothing, leathers, helmet, memoribilia, and your up to 10k plus in the first year.
---
Find me a golfer with less than 1000 worth of golfing gear.
---
Skiing, 1500 minimum to get on the slopes.
---
If you think 100 a year is too much for a hobby we enjoy.  Maybe you should see what other hobbies cost.  This is cheap by comparison.
---
I quit playing 76 and started playing WoW classic, which has a $15 a month sub fee, so yeah... it ain't that LOL
---
Thank you for the reponse.
---
People who think Fallout 76 is a MMO have never played a MMO. They should go see Eve Online, a real MMO, with tens of thousands of players in the same game together.
---
Which proves how much more p2w Fallout 1st is.
---
don thine frigid tinfoil robes
---
Oh no, me and the rest of the Charleston Rangers will have to hide in our privet worlds from you guys. So scary.
---
"Proving yet again that what we read about on reddit and watch on youtube is nothing but outrage culture for clicks."
---
I'm sure that's true a lot of the time, but I haven't seen people saying nobody will buy the sub or that the sub isn't selling well. The overwhelming sentiment is that the sub is bad, unethical, part of a lie, etc., and that people shouldn't buy it, but that's far from saying how it's actually doing.
---
Personally, I'm fine with other people paying the bills to fix my play experience if they want, as long as Bethesda doesn't continue to break promises or does something even more dodgey like start gating more and more content behind the sub. I suspect either of those responses to this 'good news' will make them seem increasingly like the bad guys to more and more players.
---
Man up for not wanting to encourage cheating? Ok that makes sense
---
And your a no lifer who victimized themselves for the sake of bandwagoning internet points. Get a fucking life
---
Nobody should LEARN to not be upset about getting fucked about, they should keep being upset and try to bring companies to task for that fuckery.
---
Fair enough but don't ignore the part that makes sense lol
---
You'll probably also get a situation in the future where some talented team of modders makes multiplayer Fallout 4. And that will be free as well.
---
Duping by the millions actually hurt the game more not too mention seeking outside of the game for real cash. 
---
Letting players into survival mode at the height of duping with duped items lead to the demise of survival mode where people didn’t even want to go since they didn’t have a chance... it died. 
---
Glitches and hacks (pc mostly) in NW via numerous posts are making people stay away from that. 
---
Sorry but if we want to talk about what kills the game let’s bring other issues up like the above which directly lead to people wanting private servers in the first place.
---
I know but this fallout first it's a real problem
---
Ah no problem, thank you!
---
Ditto, fellow F1
---
&gt;I'm from Windows NT
---
 😁
---
fo76 has been out for barely a year.
---
and which i remember that ESO whas in the exact same state, and had a payed subscription which gave you advantages. 
---
fo76 has not been out for that long and they are still working on it
---
The time to act was when 76 was announced.
---
sorry man
---
Yeah I agree. There really isn't anything massive about 76 at all. Once you hit endgame it's one shooting bad guys in 2/3rds of the map and nuking the queen over and over.
---
Tatos doing well too. Bumper crop.
---
Texture -high, water - medium, lighting - medium, shadow - medium,  shadow - low, 1080p
---
I see people with the Firebreathers flamer a lot
---
Including myself
---
I feel like some of your are just hostile for the sake of being hostile. The subscription doesn't affect the way anyone who chooses not to participate plays the game, it doesn't change the game's mechanics or stability. It literally doesn't affect anyone except for those that buy it. Everyone complaining really just needs to get over themselves. This is getting a bit ridiculous, even to the point that you guys are personally attacking those that have bought in. The game needs to maintain profitability, or it will eventually get shut down.
---
Now everyone’s starting to think 8 bucks a month is way worth it to avoid idiots crashing the servers.
---
All in all I expected more hostility and more aggressive down voting. Disagreeing with people on Reddit often leads to an almost totalitarian sort of suppression response ;)  
---
But, yes, that, exactly, convenience. The scrap box makes it easier to accumulate mats for fixing stuff, making ammo etc. Does that mean a Firster can spend more time shooting bad guys and less time scrounging? Maybe. 
---
If being a Firster means having the option to toss a few bucks on the table to reduce my grind time...then yes, sign me up!
---
And who are you to decide that?
---
1: 1st isn’t a big deal to me. I would have payed $100 just for the CPD Riot armor anyway. 
---
2: I’m still enjoying the game
---
3: The people that spend money on atoms and 1st are the same people that are supporting the development of future DLC that *everyone* will have access to
---
4: Did I mention that I still enjoy the game?
---
It might be that I'm running maxed out...but that shouldn't be a problem.
---
ESO had Craglorn before the end of year one. Craglorn was huge, free and provided a ton of endgame content.
---
Edit: I get what you are saying though,hopefully all this will get added over time. Whether the game lasts that long is what concerns me. Every bad decision gets plastered all over the net, which puts future players off, whilst the beta players drift off or get pissed off and leave.
---
I have a plan in my selling machine since first Meat Week
---
sound real good to me
---
Thats the code to fake open it - the real one is generated per player by a quest
---
Players can place their survival tent in adventure mode??
---
&gt;The game itself runs on JSON (api.bethesda.net / websockets) packets for data transfer and out of range players. Anyone close is 'switched' to UDP stream for more fluent movement/prediction etc.
---
*starts screaming internally*
---
If you were really sorry you'd take down the post. Y'all making 1st to be more of a problem than it actually is; now you're gonna ruin my experience because of what Bethesda decided? That ain't right my guy
---
You were at a Workshop while carrying Junk, I see flaws in your spec.
---
Riflemen 1 point, Expert Riflemen 1 point, Master Riflemen 1 point and 3 points in Gun Slinger for a total of 6 points. ( Really 3 because I use Semi Auto Rifles) so 3-6 points for 571 damage seems to be a good investment.
---
Action Boy is a waste I use Powered Unyielding Armor. 
---
Besides Sneak and Escape Artist the rest of those perks are not needed when I am doing over 1k damage a sneak attack.
---
Evasive and dodgy I don't use I expect to die a lot with a Bloodied Build that's the trade off.
---
In a true Bloodied Build below 20% Born Survivor would be no help.
---
I've run a Bloodied build since at least a level 100 I am over 200 on my main and 47 on my alt I use for Nuclear Winter. I'm not an expert but I can tell you that with a Bloodied Build the Gun Slinger and Riflemen perks go together like Good Doggy and Canned Dog Food.
---
I did read the entire post, and in that post you claim that:
---
"The rest of us is just either enjoying the game how it is, or while being subbed, minus all the whining."
---
You are clearly trying to argue that the people playing are enjoying the game with no problems, and again, you can't speak for them. Just because I logged in the other day doesn't mean I have no problems or I enjoy the game and don't criticize.
---
So maybe take your own advice, read your post and my reply, and figure out where you went wrong. xD
---
Do you have any source for that?
---
LMAOO my man. I was reading and was about to dunk on you when you said the inevitable “I’m mad that he has extra stuff!”
---
Always happy to see people still playing and enjoying themselves and not letting other people buying stuff get in their way!
---
God this is pathetic.
---
OP is Harry Potter, and Wizards don’t exist.
---
&gt; latest decisions have detracted from the games appeal to new players, which is to the detriment of the games on going future.
---
New players have to add the $60 to the $100, plus the $30 for Wastelanders: who wants to pay $190 for an old game?
---
This is why I am so angry about this 1st subscription. It will halt the influx of new players that were expected once the game is full of things to do. 
---
It makes me think that they do not intend to invest what is needed to build a good game. They did not do it before release, and they are already profit-taking from FO76 (rather then investing).
---

From what I can tell there's a per-player code given by a quest and the 0 just opens the door but not the elevator activator
---
I get you! I was more aiming that at Allahu's comment about installing a mod to ban firsters. I think your idea would be fun to spectate!
---
Yes, the Meat Hook definitely starts off weaker than the DCG.  The only reason it can outpace it is because food buffs seem to affect it twice-over.
---
I got free log cabin walls from a free mod in Fallout 4.

It's actually not. If you enable poor business practices said business practices will continue. It's about as simple as I can break this down for people.

I love it :)

Also try the XB LFG, I am sure a ton of people would love to help you ..
---
It really isn't though. Yall making mountains out of molehills
---
No thanks, you don't even seem to be able to comprehend it yourself!
---
That's literally what a conversation or debate is. You say something. I agree or disagree, I say why. You respond. Hell, we're having a conversation right now about how you don't think it's still a conversation when someone disagrees with you. Which is totally ridiculous by the way.
---
LMFAO, imagine thinking a subscription for a single game that costs the same as Amazon Prime is anything other than a purely insane cash grab exercise in fuckery.
---
I can't speak for anyone but myself but I know I want Bethesda to "fail" because that's what they need right now. In my eyes they've made a ton of anti-consumer choices with 76 alone and it's obvious that they don't care what the fan base wants, just what will make them more money. That's the only reason the creation club was structured how it is, why the Atom store has been host to more than just cosmetic items, and why they are pulling this subscription nonsense when it's not well implemented and is basically charging for a feature that's free in most games (though often times that done through instances and I'm pretty sure Beth is doing dedicated servers for each but that's less about quality, I think, and more about creating a problem to justify charging for it).
---
I don't want Bethesda to fail as a company or as a game studio because they have the talent, the creativity, and the ability to create solid games and really interesting world's, I just want them to "fail" when it comes to these small things that keep hurting the fans and serve only to get the studio more money. That's not good for anyone because the studio then focuses less on making those great games and more of making sleezy features to extract more money from the fans...
---
Oh well 🤷‍♂️
---
you right
---
The first step was when this game was being conceptualised.
---
blooded faster fire rate and a vampires explosive 50 cals to clear mobs and make sure i dont die. silly easy assuming no one shows up.. only took 2500 rounds of ultracite 50 cal.
---
A lot of people join Reddit just to follow things they hate and bitch about them.
---
Serious answer (unlike quite a few people here), since there isn't a 'dictionary definition' for that term, it will depend a lot on the specific situation.
---
What' it *never* means is the literal translation.  There isn't a game where you're competing against other players, and if you pay (or pay the most), you automatically win.  I think the term for that is 'auction'.
---
What it *generally* refers to is a game where you can gain an advantage over other players by spending money (or more money).  'Advantage' is what varies by game, and in this case doesn't apply to any win state (though it can if there are multiple opportunities for an individual to beat other players in isolated situations).  In either case though, pay to win refers to the ability to spend money to be in a position that is in some way advantageous compared to someone who doesn't spend (or doesn't spend as much) money.
---
For games with discreet 'win' scenarios, this can take the form of increasing the odds of someone winning.  A faster car for racing games, more health for fighting games, etc.  Note that this conveys an *advantage*, but doesn't necessarily guarantee a win.
---
For games with no discreet 'win' objectives, this is primarily accomplished through convenience and/or time saving methods.  It allows one person to advance through the game's objectives faster.  This can be accomplished in many ways: granting additional turns, providing extra resources, increasing efficiencies of activities, booting experience gain, reducing in-game currency costs, or providing other additional resources to further objective completion.
---
It wasn’t an insult. A lot of people who play games hours every day feel a connection to the game and take insults to it personally, especially if they’re loners or depressed. That’s just how being human works.
---
Yep. Youtube and reddit are all going "Boo, I will never buy this, greed, pay to win, etc", and then every camp and player has signs that they actually subscribed.
---
I hate to sound like a broken record, but this will just encourage BSG to go full on P2W. What next, a workbench that generates random level appropriate legendaries available as part of the sub?
---
You need to go play outer worlds and free the colony from corporate greed, its like a snickers, youll feel better
---
The last 10 or so times I’ve done PP, it’s been just me... 😢.  Still good for farming acid and food, though
---
The sub is great. If I want to take a couple of workshops and generate some ammo or something while I do events, I can. No more survival rejects hassling me. No more bloodied one hit wonder builds body blocking and one hitting every legendary enemy in Uranium Fever. Then once I’ve done this things I want to do without annoyances, I go to a public world and play with other players. Launch a nuke, go battle the queen once or twice per night.
---
How do you know a player has 1st subscription?  Is it highlighted somehow?
---
Between Site Alpha and Top of the World is a nice walk.  Start at site Alpha.  You do have to first take care of the Yao Gui at site Alpha but, other than the occasional wandering scorched, it's pretty safe.   Just explore the stream towards Top of the World.
---
Just up the stream from site alpha is a ledge on the left bank.  I used to have my camp there.  There are three foxes that hang out by the stream.  When I wanted a break I would just watch them.  If you watch closely, they yawn after they lie down on the bank.  
---
As you get towards the road near Top of the World you'll want to turn back or fast travel away.  The road is usually guarded by robots or Supermutants.
---
Trying to wedge a multiplayer game into the creation engine was a huge mistake. I understand working with what you have but it was never meant to do this and it shows. 
---
Bear in mind that these are people trying to take care of themselves and their families working on this and it’s likely Zenimax, being the principal investor wanting to show dedicated revenue so they can flip the whole thing for profit is the real villain here. Bethesda employees are mostly just doing what they’re told so that they don’t lose their jobs. I can’t imagine they like this situation any more than we do.
---
This!  I wanted to learn to fly helicopters, but due to my weight, I'd have to train in a R-44, and where I live can cost about $450 per hour for lessons.
---
 Amazing. The entitled generation in action. A guy with Prime whining about Fallout 1st. Its very funny, well to some of us anyway.
---
I played Dota back when it was a mod from w3. And how sad that you troll in a sub in a game you don't even play. I guess Dota 2 isn't that good to keep your attention. And rofl @ the Dota devs caring about the community.
---
I also play outer worlds, played most of the mobas, TF, tf2, starcraft, starcraft 2, dark souls series, bloodborne, divinity series, baldurs gate series, planescape: torment, sekiro, don't starve, games from the total war series, symphony of the night, rimworld, etc. 
---
Wanna fight about it?
---
Too bad not for the right reasons. Use to spend alot more time here with hopes and dreams. Oh well.
---
Lemme mail this to BSG quick using my custom FO1st hotline.
---
Im curious if people would be willing to spend more on a game upfront to get rid of mtx period. Standard editions of games have been $60 for at least 10-15 years but the cost to develop and make a game surely has gotten more expensive.
---
So that's bad business practice. ESO saw what they had on offer wasn't enough to bring people in. One Tamriel was the turning point of ESO. For some reason 76 decided to do it the other way around. I definitely 100% disagree about your content size comment. Base game ESO is freaking huge, with 3 main storylines that absolutely dwarf 76s content. That's without considering Cyrodil, an entire PVP map.
---
I see no problem with getting all the ghoul kills either. Nukes last for 3 hours, far longer than most people spend in nuke zones. From what I’ve seen, people generally spend at most 1-1.5 hours in one. And you don’t have to get the kills yourself for the loot; a single bullet will do and you still get everything. All a privet server allows you to do is have piece of mind that nobody gets to the golf club before you. And even then, you need a friend to leave and rejoin the server to have all the ghouls respawn. 
---
I mean seriously, if privet servers were free, everyone would be doing this. Your argument sounds like “I can’t/won’t pay for this so nobody else should either”
---
Thanks for the full response. I greatly appreciate it.
---
Gun Fu &amp; Adreline with a BE Single Action is the most fun I've had in 200 leveld
---
You didn't reply to any of my points to disagree with them.
---
Couldn't he have fast traveled back to his camp as well, dropped the junk &amp; then logged off of hid his movements?
---
Well if you like the playstyle that's cool but it's not a meta build. If you're not going for that then good on you for finding a unique niche you enjoy. I just don't think it's worth steering a new player in that direction it's too complicated.
---
Hell no. It's funny how there were so many MMORPGs in the day which I gladly paid monthly for. Leveling, quests, exploring, all of it took literal years to complete. Yet this game has some little world with nothing going on with it and yet they got some fans to actually pay for it, just because it's fallout. It's sad. If fallout was equivalent to MMORPGs back in the day, I wouldn't mind the subscription at all, especially if they were open about it from the beginning. These guys however can't even let us turn vsync on or off in the options menu in-game.
---
I don't defend it but I do enjoy it very much. Its cool if someone else doesn't like it. This is the first online game I've ever put any time into. Typically just play single player stuff because my reflexes aren't fast enough to compete in PVP games against younger and more experienced players. Some think FO76 is empty and boring but it's exactly my speed. The beauty of video games is there is something for everyone.
---
It's one of the joys of PC gaming really. Your specs are fine to be sure. No mods installed? Have you done a clean install of FO76? I mean, scrub all files/registry keys related to it, then reinstall it? Is there any relevant logging data in event viewer?
---
I'm on a 6700k/2070/32GB/970 EVo with Win10 (current on updates and drivers for all), the worst I've had is server disconnects.
---
How about thinking this as we investing in this game and give them a reason to keep on going.
---
If you are not willing to, it's understandable, Bethesda broke our hearts with the game being so mediocre still after a year.
---
However, now that there are people paying, why don't you just ride on it and happily know you are getting carried.
---
Why? I paid for this game full price and they introduced pay2qol 1 year later when I can't refund it anymore. They waited on purpose.
---
Boycotting bethesda and the players who pay for this shit and incentive it is the last thing I can do.
---
Don't like it? play a different game
---
I said it once and I'll say it again. If you look at this sub as a one time bundle, it's not a bad deal.
---
My understanding that private servers in other games like ARK cost $10/month. With a 1-year subscription, you get Fallout 1st at $8.25/month. I haven't purchased either but I am trying to understand why people think private servers should be free. It isn't free to run an AWS server instance. Where else is the money supposed to come from? Perhaps some think the cost of buying the game should give us unlimited private server access in addition to paying for developers, support staff, and other overhead. That doesn't seem realistic.
---
Plans exist in the game files for each PA (except Ultracite), but are not obtainable.*
---
*Only the X-01 headlamp plans are obtainable.
---
There are many thing to 'defend' in 76, like most other games.  There are plenty of things they got right, and that are genuinely enjoyable.  I regularly defend those things.
---
There are also many things that are wrong with 76, like most other games.  I will call those out as I see them, even ones that are based on opinion.  Sometimes even when it's not my personal opinion.
---
There's no reason why we can't have it both ways.
---
and ESO has been going for years now, changing  several times how the game is played.
---
fo76 has barely been out a year. and they are working on it.
---
Pretty much all the factions that are there, and have an attachment of BoS come in to look into Taggarty and for some recruitment of locals when they come back.
---
I was one of those who insisted that repair, scrap kits and collectron and refrigerator weren't pay to win. I still think they are not, but Fallout 1^st is different. I'll make a couple practical examples I've already made in a few of other threads.
---
I choose as my endgame the farming and selling of stable flux, which is extremely hard to acquire because of the high competition killing monsters in nuke zones. Now that premium users can nuke Whitesprings and keep all the monsters to themselves the market has already been flooded with hundreds of stable flux at a quarter of the price. Nobody buys from me anymore, and I don't have access to as many stabilising materials as them. I can never hope to keep up with their new power over the market. Lowering my prices makes me sell at a loss if I take into consideration the resources I expend to craft them. They basically acquired an advantage over Adventure merchants by paying money.
---
Another example is that people (used to?) barter in 556 ammo. Premiums now have free ammo at their uncontested workshop, and infinite stash space to store materials to craft more. They'll be able to buy everything off online markets, basically acquiring an advantage by paying money.
---
Giving certain features to paying users that negatively affect non paying ones is what I define as pay to win. Placing a restriction on yourself is not the same thing as having one imposed by a price tag.
---
After you downed them, why didn't you stash your junk before they came back and attacked you again? Tent or no tent its your fault you lost your junk.
---
Funny seeing as how Fallout 1st players didn’t do anything wrong. They’re kinda just being prosecuted for nothing.
---
So what’s wrong then? Going by this it seems they planned on using the money for future updates, I’m cool with that. 
---
What it really seems like is that they didn’t plan for 76 to sell as low as it did, an now need other ways to make money to keep it alive. Again, I’m cool with this, not every idea pans out as you planned. Hell, very few ever do.
---
See, this is my dirty little secret as well (dirty at least around here).  I decided to try a month, see what the experience, at least, was like.  And....I'm actually enjoying it.  I played solo in the main game 95% of the time anyway, so it feels like a less cluttered game (as in other players), with everything playable at your own pace.  I know that was always the case to a degree, and maybe it's just my subconsciously knowing I'm  not going to run into other players in the wild, but I swear it feels different in a way I really kind of like.  I dunno....ymmv
---
As I said ESO already had huge updates by the end of year one. All we have had is a few crafting quests, the grindy backpacks and the Sheepsquatch stuff.
---
I payed more than full price since I got the special edition, you dont see people like myself complaining? Yall need to worry about yourself a and less about other people. If you could manage your junk better you wouldn't need 1st lmao
---
Communist content coming soon too - shame survival doesn't exist anymore because it would be *p r e t t y* wild
---
In the end it's not up to you I'm leaving it at that
---
Like every online multiplayer game it has issues and needs work, but it is playable and it isn't "fucked over"
---
Melody Larkin being brusque at us. Hell yeah.
---
It was like probably 3 lbs of random shit I picked up. It's not the point. The point is the tent is exploitable in this manner. If you wanna attack me I have to get into your line of sight from one direction to fight back.
---
I hate to be that guy, but anyone playing Fallout 76 can see that most people subbed. 
---
I encounter less players with the Ranger outfit than without, and every camp has a scrapbox, fridge, and bot.
---
I was against this sub at first, but ended up buying the 1 month version because I really wanted the outfit. I know a lot of people that did the same thing.
---
I will not be renewing unless they add something unique month to month, but looking at this sub as a bundle makes it an ok deal.
---
Bethesda could sell increased camp budget
---
I have a job, I just don't waste the money I make on garbage like Fallout 1st. But thanks for stalking me.
---
This^ lol
---
I would hope they finish the existing vault raids first - there's so much just kicking around in the files that needs some threading / finalization.
---
&gt;Yea, they are giving us unlimited crafting storage. That still doesn't take away from the way you've been playing the game this entire time. 
---
Yes, we have all had a hobbled game to prepare for this subscription. 
---
#Design a game with frustrating grind, then remove the excessive grid for a price.
---
Bethesda was able to make a game that took huge amounts of scrap and grind because they intended to let payers get out of the tedium. They knew they had made the game not fun, and they want to sell the fun back to you on a monthly basis.
---
#Design a game with resource scarcity, then sell access to unspoiled territory.
---
Private servers will give these players an exclusive area in which to gain strength and resources. They are then allowed to take these resources back to the public server.
---
Because we like the game and the content. The real question is why there is so many people who hate this game and don’t even play it still in this sub? 
---
Go away, let us enjoy the game and have fun.
---
I understand the server issues you guys are talking about, but it seems like making a persistant server should be pretty easy for them in the future (crossing fingers). 
---
Hopefully we get persistant servers soon, seeing as in minecraft I believe 7 or 8 bucks gives you a persistant server that people can log into when the owner is offline.
---
I'm really hoping that after the Holidays they reveal that they've been busting ass on this game for the last couple months, I really like Fallout. I would like for this game not to go the way of Anthem seeing as the game is fun (at least to me) and the base game is good, there's just a big lack of content, end game for example.
---
Plus I believe whatever team is on this game needs help, I think modders would be more then happy to mod or fix this game with an unofficial patch like most other Bethesda Game Studios games. Plus they would be getting paid like they should.
---
at least it doesnt have loot boxes.
---
I just think like look at developers and games like Witcher 3, Horizon Zero Dawn, God of War, etc. Are these games struggling to make money? They release a great game and people buy it. They sometimes release 1 or a few DLC that provide great value. A little later down the line they are bundled together in a GOTY edition or something that you can get on sale, for those who might not be able to afford it at full release price. It's a perfect system. Even monthly subscription MMOs like 5-10 a month are nice and something pretty much anyone can afford, and in that you get everything included, the whole game, in pretty much perfect working order. Then there are the free to play, that monetize with cosmetics, or even "pay to win". I have played some of those free to play MMOs and even spent a little on them, or regretted spending a lot when the systems were predatory and manipulative. How do you want your customer to feel? Cheated? Ripped off? Taken advantage of? Who will fall for it once, but then never give you any money ever again? This is the situation. 
---
There's the good way and the bad way. You can't have it all ways. People have plenty of options. There are so many great developers out there. Companies who simply create quality products and are happy with the money the make from it. That's how it was in the beginning, and there's nothing wrong with that model. Don't rush games out broken. Provide a fully polished finished game and sell it and people will buy it. Sell cosmetics and DLC that we have all become accustomed to, if there is quality and value in it. Don't be stingy with currencies and item pricing. Provide a way to acquire currency in game. It's not rocket science. Do it the right way and people have little to complain about.
---
Yes, but these are things anyone can do. He did something you can only do by paying. And that's shelter himself in an indescriptible tent until he was able to wait out the fast travel debuff.
---
Why should I pay for inventory management? Don't you hear how stupid it sounds when you type it? Even worse when they told us the weight limit is on place due to server performance. I guess server performance = $
---
I know what all of those words mean but I’m not sure what they mean in that order.
---
I wrote a living will allowing my scrap bot to pull the plug on me if I ever become terminally ill.
---
Think about it removing that factor of a personal world they could screw us over and add something more pay to win along with the obvious ones added they could easily make it more of an issue not only that no one will want to them to offer private servers for a fee and then on top add a subscription just cause you want them to do that doesnt mean everyone agrees
---
You dont have to pay for inventory management, just dont be a hoarder. 🤷‍♂️
---
Yeah that tent needs to be destructible.
---
I see a lot of people exploiting it during SBQ fights.
---
Friend the majority of people left on this sub are people who defended Fallout 1st. You’re just preaching to your own club of people who deserve all they get
---
I apologize for anything I said to put you on edge or upset you. It was unintentional. Happy gaming.
---
The junks not the point and it was literally what I was collecting in the shop at that moment. The point is this he hid himself in and indestructible free to place anywhere shelter and that's how he got away from me. I care not about the junk. I care he was able to get away by using this payed for item.
---
Not really? Maybe not hosting worlds on Bethesda servers but there's really zero reason why they couldn't have provided a free alternative in the form of hosting games on your own computer or releasing software to host servers.
---
Performance has actually improved slightly for me on public servers. 
---
Mind you - you can still hit ones where dupers / heavy events etc have taken their toll but for the most part I'm finding it's a better provided I'm not connecting to a world on the other side of the continent (NA) which always has a bit of induced lag for me.
---
i want an event that can event the event events.
---
Why you getting defensive when I wasnt directing it to you how pathetic can you get
---
Let's not act like this is an acceptable scenario for a €70 game, either.
---
They're not using it to determine value. 
---
They're using it to compare price. There's no valid claim to be made that a product costs more in one market than in another without doing a currency conversion, and without including relevant tariffs or taxes. That's all that is being done here. 
---
The assertion that demographics and purchase power affect differences more than exchange rates is not supported by the difference here, which is 23 cents. Yes, that 23 cent difference is caused by that. The rest is accounted for by taxes and exchange rate.
---
The OP claims here that difference is "nearly double" and that is untrue because the exchange rate between USD and NZD is not 1:1 or even close to it.
---
Absolutely agree it needs to be just like a regular camp. Cost 40 caps to place, can be destroyed and repaired.
---
I figured out the issue. Its something to do with my login. My Microsoft and bethesda accounts use the same email, but my xbox account uses a different email. So I found the purchase under the wrong Microsoft account. Not the one that is linked to the bethesda account. 
---
Ill have to email microsoft now for a refund. Thanks again for the help.
---
No mods, scrubbed all folders, reg, and inis. Not my first rodeo!
---
Typical: https://pastebin.com/aUy57i3K
---
I was just about to buy my wife the game, since I just bought her a new computer. Guess what I did instead? I uninstalled my game. If fallout wont change for the better, then I just wont return. I also know a lot of people who own the game and need a reason to return, you expect them to come back? Nope.
---
Not only do I get enjoyment out of the game by playing with friends but come on man Bethesda can't give us "free dlc" that money's gotta come from somewhere. 
---
Like seriously,  you must have some understanding of the business model here, they release the game and initial sales money goes to devs and other expenses.
---
They've then promised wastelanders and all other future dlc to be free. To do this they need to continue making money from the game. 
---
All these people bashing on people that buy 1st memberships are just hurting the free future of this game.
---
Scene event supply crates often have them
---
That’s very nice... thank you 
---
- and we love foxes
---
Not saying it's not a thing  but FWIW I have not experienced any issues related to anyone's tents on the public / private servers I've been on over the weekend. 
---
This was on some servers where people moved them a fair bit as we roamed across the map
---
cept Fallout 76
---
is four times the size has lots of trees and stuffs and to be honest i find it a more interesting map /landscape overall. though fallout 4 does have a better story /npcs etc.
---
Are you able to tell what the exact time frame is allotted for the server instance to close once leaving and closing the game? 
---
I ask because people state if you leave the server and join private world again it will put you back into the same world. 
---
I have experienced with this guide a bit over the past couple days and this is NOT the case. It will put you into a new server at times. 
---
It seems to be time based, and a very small window of time I will say, but I'm not sure if it's a set exact amount of time before that world closes and it would open a new one for you.
---
People love toxicity.  Schadenfreude is real.  Look at this sub the past couple of days. People who stopped playing (or never played to begin with) have come here to basically do the "Bethesda Bad" speech.  
---
&gt;If the point of your post is to highlight some sort of futility of speaking out because certain things are so popular, I disagree, because if more people organized together, they could change the tune of a game.
---
If the majority want something (and to be clear we are not talking about any type of civil rights violations or anything like that), is it right for the minority to band together and try to change things?  
---
Let's assume that the actual majority of players don't care or enjoy the First Subscription (or any of the other previously released items).  Is it right for the minority to fight to take that away from those players?
---
Games may be more expensive to make, but there are millions of more people buying games now than in the past. That doesn't hold water. And there's no problem with tier versions of games. Giving away some novelty cosmetic and early access for a premium tier for those who can afford it. I have bought collectors editions of games previously for silly cosmetics, and being able to play 48 hours early or "beta test" for a few weeks leading up to release etc. There's no need for MTX, or having to pay more. There are plenty of developers who are testament to that, who make great games that sell well without any BS.
---
They're random encounters. There's a map on this Reddit somewhere with them.
---
If nothing else they have done up until this point signified to you that they were capable of this, wouldn't you have to just accept that you deserve to get burned?
---
I mean if you were a truly principled gamer you would have realized they were a garbage company long ago and stopped supporting them, voting with your wallet for a better gaming industry, but instead you support them when it is obvious to others you shouldn't. Meanwhile if you'd just been able to admit something was wrong, they wouldn't get money for doing shadier and shadier shit.
---
So basically the thousands of people who put their foot down and said "no. we will not support this we expect better from you". Accomplish NOTHING in doing so, whether it is Bethesda, EA, Activision, Ubi, Epic, 2K, (MOST of which I have been boicotting for the better part of a decade, and have been telling other to do the same), but the people boicotting, doing the RIGHT THING, trying to get them to make BETTER GAMES with less ASS FUCKING, are overshadowed by idiots like you, who forgive and forget and buy buy buy the shit shit shit so they make make make more shit shit shit!!!!
---
Could you imagine what the gaming landscape would look like if most gamers acted with principle, instead of the short-sighted idiots they apparently are? Imagine if people didn't pay companies to be fucked in the ass over and over again? It's really insane, when if a company even tries to get a whiff of my ass, I stay a away and keep my eye on their actions. It's so fucking easy to prevent this landscape. People are just too fucking stupid.
---
Uninstall, loser.
---
do not insult the rangers!
---
I will. Still pissed at Bethesda for lying though.
---
It's the only mission that feels like a Fallout mission. Very well done
---
Yet
---
I'm on PS4 and can make you one. I might even have an extra plan for them so you can make them yourself. My PSN is damian _13_666 but I'm currently at work so won't be on for a few more hours
---
&gt; ok, I think we hit the peak of the dumb mountain...! Are serious right now? Is this a weird nationalism thing?
---
No, it's a weird having a clue about what you're talking about thing.
---
Do you seriously think that the GBP is a stronger currency than, for example, the CHF (Swiss Franc) just because, today, one pound gets you 1.28 Swiss Francs?
---
The whole point of a stronger currency is that it is the one you want to hold.  If, five years ago, you had decided that it was better to hold your pounds because they were worth 2.24 Swiss francs, and so obviously "stronger" you would be feeling pretty sick now.
---
&gt; Even with this, that does not excuse charging the same amount for both Dollars and Pounds.
---
Except they don't.
---
The price in the US for the annual subscription is (pre tax) USD 100.
---
The price in the UK for the annual subscription is (pre tax) GBP 83.33, which, at current exchange rates is USD 107.14.  Wow, it costs 7 whole dollars more.
---
Given the volatility of the GBP/USD exchange rate it makes sense for anyone in the states to bill a bit higher, or they risk losing a lot of money if the GBP falls.  Like after Brexit for example.  :)
---
The major difference in the price is that in the UK, like the rest of the EU, it is illegal to advertise pre-tax prices to private individuals.  Unlike the US published prices always include all necessary taxes, notably the 20% VAT.

I know the feeling all too well. Most of my friends and family members have passed away. I live alone, and the only online friend I made was three weeks ago when some level 12 ran up to my base and started throwing out tons of emotes. I found my headset still in my xbox box. Unwrapped it and started a conversation with this kid about fo76. We now play daily. I thought that FO76 was the worst game on the system.  But the only game to bring me a friend
---
I've never played ESO so i can speak on it's subscription service
---
apparently you can earn repair kits or pick em up in game? cuz i happen to just have one lol.
---
repairing items really aint that hard without em just scrap em up.
---
That’s great! Thanks for posting.
---
&gt;In the end it's not up to you I'm leaving it at that
---
Nice answer it a post with the "Discussion" flair . You said everything that holds your point.
---
Publishers are making record profits though so the development costs can’t be the driving force behind MTXs. People are quite often already paying more than $60 to buy “deluxe” editions filled with useless crap or “collectors” editions shipped with paper and plastic toys. I could actually see the base prices falling and the season pass/MTX system being expanded and tweaked to match players expectations.
---
The traditional P2W meaning has a very strict definition, it means you can pay for power, easily beating someone who farms/plays it all.
---
People are speaking of it pretty easily these days though, I am like come on, really?
---
I did notice less about on my initial runs.   However when I made second pass later, most were there.
---
Came here to say this, have my upvote
---
OP clearly hasn't read or seen the reaction from fans, this is literally what everyone is saying and why Fallout 1st is getting trashed so hard.
---
whoa?  molerats jump out of toilets?
---
I left my teddy bears in my stash (and on display) and everything else I put in my stash box with no issues
---
Me:   Put a stock on a Bolt Action Pipe Pistol or Revolver and you can benefit from both perk cards.
---
New Player:   Cool I'll check it out
---
Turd Party:    WTF is he talking about that's not a META Build it too complicated I just don't understand it.
---
It's ok Turd Party stick to watching You Tube videos on Meta Builds and keep hitting that like button.
---
I felt the same, it's a great place to explore but a little lifeless. I guess atomic bombs would do that :P
---
The quests feel a little like you are doing them for no reason, as the people you are doing them for are either dead or moved away a long time ago.
---
That said I still enjoy it. I like the stories
---
Every online game has a grind. The grind is still there, the subscription doesn't remove the grind. You're talking like it removes the crafting requirements; it does not.
---
The scarcity is still there. Everything is still limited to a global cooldown, and spawn rates, and the subscription doesn't change that. All we get is a separate instance, the same technology they are going to use for Wastelanders, and have used for the raids. Again, you are claiming something that simply isn't true.
---
All the subscription does is allow us to control who we interact with, to a point. We still can't limit which friends can join our instance. It gives us a way to store crafting components that doesn't affect our stash space. It gives us a few atoms, and an outfit. None of this is any kind of ridiculous advantage over anyone else. Your outrage is excessive, inaccurate, and pointless.
---
Loot boxes coming this Christmas!
---
for 1800 Atoms get your chance of getting some l33t loot!!   The more loot boxes you get the greater the chance of l33t loot!
---
fine print:  no guarantee of l33t loot. most loot contained in loot boxes can be found by a level 2 player just outside of vault 76.   1 in 9000 chance of actual l33t loot.  chance grows at .003 percent for every loot box you have bought.
---
The simple fact is that Bethesda is a business and in order to justify the ongoing expenditure of Fallout 76 - because unlike their previous games, it *has* an ongoing expenditure - it must be sustainable.  Hopefully in the long-run.  If it isn't, then one of two things must happen.  Either they find other avenues to make money, or they shut it down.
---
I don't think 1st was greed for the sake of greed.  If that were their motivation, they would have pulled the plug early on like EA did with Anthem.  No sense in throwing good money after bad.  They instead decided to keep at it, and probably came to realize that there were serious problems in the long-term with sustainability at the rate content was being produced.  It's not like 76 is flying off the shelves anywhere.
---
The only thing i want is unlimited space.
---
Just a heads up, the raider vendor in Whitesprings often sells radium rifles.

Sure it is buddy.
---
Ahh yes the old "move the goalposts" "change the definition" strategy. You're never wrong; everyone else is just judging things based off of the wrong definition of what makes a game good.  On a scale from 1-10 how much Fallout is Fallout? FO76 is the worst Fallout game. Period. It's not even close. Average reviews are at least 13% lower than BoS. Lol Bye.
---
Haven’t seen any myself, I thought it was only for their own server.
---
Unlucky ig probably just a glitch
---
Glad you figured it out.
---
I often find one on the table upstairs at Appalachia antiques near Watoga. I found 2 yesterday.
---
Range outfit is pretty cool- the mask protects you from airborne hazards without the -1 perception
---
That fungus actually takes over control of the spider's muscles and forces it to infect other spider's with the fungus. It's sometimes called zombie fungus
---
Of course the raiders always want your shit
---
I actually think that the best way to top the SBQ as a unique boss is to introduce a giant Shelob-esque wolf spider spawning with tons of cave cricket sized children.
---
Have it climb out of a giant fissure hole and instead of sonic blast - it fires a web cannon that can trap players down for 20 seconds.
---
Lore? Crazy Arktos Pharmacy side project by someone who read way to much Hubris Comics. *(thinking of the Antagonizer / Mechanist)*

&gt; Video games is cheap by comparison.
---
This is probably why people that enjoy the hobby are so loud any time even minuscule extra costs are introduced.  A lot of them are young, so they don't have their own discretionary income to spend on it.
---
And, a lot of them are poor and got into the hobby because of it's general cheapness.  And now that that's going away, they don't know where to turn, so they lash out and pretend it's going to change something.
---
Far better than a bunch of you hateful sheep circle jerking each other in your bubble over not wanting to spend real money.
---
I hope Fallout 76 will improve and bring you back, fare thee well.
---
Awesome thanks for the information :)
---
My experience this weekend was a tad different [PS4].   
---
I noticed a bunch of players grouped together near the Prime Fissure with no Nuke event going on.  They had been there for a while.  I wandered down to see what was going on. I was thinking that they might be farming legendary scortch beasts. 
---
I overheard one guy talking in public chat about how he was using a God Mode bug to make a ton of caps in PvP.  It appeared that they were all in a clan and he was teaching them how to use it to cheat to win.
---
In my opinion, it confirms that PvP is completely broken and, despite protests otherwise by PvP players, there is no skill involved.  It's all about OP builds and cheats.
---
Awesome good to know! Thanks :)
---
It’s a multiplayer survival game. It’s missing the “massively” part of MMO. This game type doesn’t lend itself to thousands of players sharing a world.
---
Because I like the game.
---
No, it wont damage the next fallout.  It will cause it to be better, because the developers will have more funding to work with.
---
You can spend your money however you want, but if I paid one hundred dollars for literally nothing functional I'd be pretty mystified by the people defending it.
---
And Netflix gives you far fucking more for your money than this garbage.
---
Selling cosmetics? Dude, at least 3/4 of the shit in the store i wouldnt wear if it was FREE. Ugly, heinously designed, boring, not fallout, etc.
---
 They need new artists badly. Im not surprised the atom shop failed to bring in revenue. Its mostly garbage.
---
So if somebody disagrees with your opinion they are garbage. Cool cool. Good to know
---
Ive already get rid off the game. Sorry
---
&gt; there are millions of more people buying games now than in the past.
---
And a *lot* more games vying for an audience.
---
It's really a buyer's market.
---
This is a very interesting example. I do see why you don't like Fallout 1st (at least that it affects non-paying players negatively/can be used outside private worlds).
---
Yeah but that sounds like work.... so here we’re putting the freestates stuff and raider stuff up again for another 12 days, you like that
---
I agree with you. As someone that owns multiple firearms in real life I would love so see some skins featuring realistic finishes, blueing, nickle-plating, brushed finishes, parkerised, etc.
---
I can see the appeal of the gold skins for some, that gold .44 is purty, but I would really like something that looks like it is for use in the field instead of as a show piece.
---
[](/celestiahappy)
---
They used to drop legendaries, but a little while back they made a change so that legendaries with no stars stopped dropping them.  Later on, they removed the legendary title from those mobs, so 0 star legendaries dropping no legendary loot was a thing between those two fixes.
---
Seems like, as frequently happens with updates to this game, they inadvertently rolled back that last fix.
---
just the sound track from the atom shop alone should have gave them a clue where this was headed.
---
I'd love for you to justify paying for fallout 1st to me lol. Especially when it's so buggy that you don't even get half the shit you're paying for
---
If you want to take workshops without pvp become a fallout first player
---
The FO1st pricing model is only bad because the game launched and has largely remained poorly developed. If 76 was a polished game with a ton of content it wouldn’t look so bad. Once you couple that with the countless other problems like poor network security and the cheap merchandising and the game just sorta looks like one big money grab. I would say a successful grab. Say what you will about Activision but COD is always highly polished, even if the game design gets stale and lazy.
---
&gt;[S]helter himself in an indestructible tent until he was able to wait out the fast travel debuff.
---
That is like being able to cancel the debuff
---
&gt;How was this not an advantage?? I would have 100% killed them and got my junk back without their little fast travel immortal tent.
---
Huge advantage! You had no chance. **Old FO76 is gone...**
---
Your game time is over, your $60 is gone. This is a new Pey-two-VVin game they have given to you in place of the Fallout 76 you loved.
---
&gt; **Once you start down the dark path, forever will it dominate your destiny**

#Non-subscribers are here to entertain the subscribers, right?
---
Maybe throw some artilery smoke grenades in there, a few nuka-quantum grenades. Then his screen should be covered in particles and all twitchy and blurry. Run up and blast.
---
Meanwhile, the sub (well, private servers) is what brought the vast majority of people I know IRL back to the game, including myself, because we can now get the experience that we originally wanted, which is essentially a Fallout world shared with just friends.
---
Also, we have jobs so we don't feel obligated to whine about the cost.
---
marsupial is your friend
---
Responders- they would be a great help to the wastelanders returning
---
Are you on PS4 because I should have an extra Bloodied Pistol in my stash you can have.
---
I am willing to wager:
---
If you were playing before - 80% you are still playing.
---
If you were not playing before or had already stopped - 80% you are still not playing.
---
I have been waiting for private servers for a while so while the current setup needs TLC and QOL love - I can see the private servers actually making things fun in a big *(semi-new)* way.
---
EG: the return of real night mode, hopefully return of survival mode etc,. Workshop persistence
---
Maintenance for a server isn’t free.  What should we tell the ground game employees “you don’t need your own place to live. We’ll let you guys sleep in the office for free”?
---
The ranger outfit is one of the best outfits they have put out. Not because they did a good job, but because most of the stuff they put on the store was fucking trash.
---
Farewell random dude I have never met!
---
Imho not worth if u r running bloodied. Had Sneak and Escape Artist, but found out its obsolete. U should have around 40 AG and that is more than enough. Escape artist worked for me, but I kill everything so fast I dont need to hide at all. Having dmg mitigation perks also helps. Scorchbeast attack is explosive, you can make urself effectively immune with Fireproof perk and non-legendary armor mods.
---
I'm pretty well paid, so that amount for health is on the high side.  The university fees are pretty standard.  (These a French figures, other countries will be different).
---
at least pay a sub for a game with decent dev support, not for skins and in game refrigerators.... 
---
its been nearly a year and it still has some deep issues for an ex AAA game developer, nothing bad to say about the players, heck if its on discount buy it, but to pay a monthly and still read about lighting going through solid walls is just bonkers...
---
quickest way to hit your vendors cap limit for the day is to do a uranium fever, loot everything you can and do the short struggle shuffle to the train station
---
Because it doesn't have a star, same issue with killing too fast, assuming the bug of "naming a non legendary, a legendary" did not revive.
---
Killing too fast is a simplified explanation but the true thing is sometimes the server/game lags and needs time to give the mob proper legendary attributes. Don't kill it unless it has a star.
---
A note about Grahm. It seems like on the private servers I've been to - if you hangout at a workshop or train station for enough time - he seems to appear and stick around longer then I've ever seem him do.
---
Can't say for certain but I think he beelines it to the players on the servers so ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯ take from that what you will
---
If you wanted to double dip on perk cards the gun has to be a Bolt Action Pipe Pistol or Revolver.
---
Yes. 
---
And you made a blanket statement that it’s common knowledge that FO76 crashes constantly.  Which is not true. The fact there is so much variability in hardware on PC can mean it is likely the issue is on your end with something thing being out of spec.
---
Uhhh. ok. I thought we were just talking but I guess you're arguing.      
---
Go ahead and recommend a low health, high risk, complicated to use build that can only benefit from using 1 gun to a player who has no way of getting his hands on said gun because he doesn't even understand how legendary weapons work yet. Makes sense to me.
---
That's where I am at, haha
---
See it's your flair for the dramatics that's the problem... and the over all problem of this subreddit. You get yourselves so worked up. No where did I say that any change is impossible, and noting about rolling over and dying (giving up) but so much of this subreddit thinks the hatred towards Beth and its users is going to change something, it's not. 
---
If you don't like something don't support it, it's that simple. Sure Beth will come out and say they hear your feedback, and maybe throw a token mia colpa but that'll be it. They aren't moving away from monetizing this or any game. It's already been proven a successful business model.
---
So harassing the user base, telling people how to enjoy their game, making fun of them, blaming them, it's just pointless, you're not changing anyones mind towards the game, just towards you and the others like you.
---
Looks like we got ourselves a Liberator Horde Event boys!
---
Everyone understands that buying a PC or console is a large up-front cost and everyone is mostly ok with that. Check a PC gaming subreddit and they're (rightfully) bitching about how expensive RAM has become in recent years, for example. One of the advantages of PC gaming however, is that even though the up front cost is higher than consoles, you can take advantage of steam sales and stuff where you can get dozens and dozens of games for seriously low prices. Like, my game library has over 200 games in it just on steam, and the vast majority of those were bought on sales. Consoles get the lower up-front cost in exchange for less availability of cheaper games. It all balances out in a way, IMO.
---
Everyone was upset when games went from $50 to $60 years back. That kind of an increase is IMO kind of ok, because yeah, games are expensive to make. Of course, when companies like EA and Activision are posting record profits and also laying people off at the same time, you have to wonder if they REALLY needed to increase the cost at all since they live off of MTX now.
---
That said, what people hate about MTX is that they're inherently predatory and often times exorbitantly priced. Just sticking to 76, people have been complaining about atom shop prices since day one, and IMO, rightfully so. Nearly $20 for a power armor skin IS an asinine price, even if you can earn the points through gameplay, since that isn't really a guaranteed thing anyway. 
---
The problem with 76 is that they have mixed many hated "free to play" tactics together in a game that you pay for up front, in addition to seemingly not giving a shit about fixing the game itself. Like, if the game is free and you pay a subscription to access it? Most people are OK with that, since you didn't pay for the game in the first place. If 76 was free to play and cost $10/month and still gave you all the other stuff like the atoms? It MIGHT actually be worth it since you haven't paid the initial $60+ to buy the game, so you could feasibly come out "ahead" on atoms alone, and people would likely be more receptive to that.
---
Something else I'll add: I enjoy the Forza games. When Forza 7 came out, they had some lootbox bullshit in the game where certain cars could only be unlocked by buying the boxes with in game currency. The entire community revolted, and they removed cars from the lootbox bullshit, and later the boxes themselves iirc. They didn't even involve real money, the community voiced their concerns, the dev listened, and they removed them from the game, and it is better as a result.
---
Companies are capable of listening to their community and making positive changes. Some of them just don't. It's obvious Bethesda is one of them that very much doesn't give a shit at this point. Previously they seemed to be "one of the good ones" and with fo1st it's obvious they're not, and a lot of folks are having to come to terms with that.
---
Should have a fallout 1st flair as well!
---
Petition to activate The Battle that Never Was event
---
I mean I’ll never say no to new content. I would just hope it’s well-made, has a new awesome soundtrack, and is a separate world space as I believe that may help with stability rather than increase the map size and add more to an already somewhat unstable world space.
---
So you have to pay more for health care if you make more money?
---
You would have to be a fallout first user to use mods.
---
My understanding is each piece procs individually.
---
As for a cap I have heard (and no longer have a link to the source) you start having diminishing returns after 300DR/ER. At that point you might as well be in PA to get the other bonuses they offer.
---
[](/celestiawink)
---
I suggest looking through what I've posted.. a few days ago.. along the lines of private server ;-)
---
Bethesda found their playerbase of slaves that will buy anything and everything these idiots shit out. 
---
Todd Howard: “people will buy anything” all they had to do was slap the fallout brand on it.
---
I will say I don't know anything about Horizon Zero Dawn, but God of War is a pretty straightforward narrative, right? You play through it beginning to end, you have some side quests, you have a world to explore, but it's finite. Haven't played Witcher 3 but I get the sense it's the same way - sort of a Dragon Age vibe, maybe? Big world, set questlines, strong narrative. 
---
So I wonder if there's really room for MTX in games like that. There's replay potential to an extent, but not in the way something like 76 is trying to have. On one hand it makes sense that this type of game would require a different kind of income stream than the traditional model. On the other hand, look at Ark. The game goes on perpetually, and gets bigger and bigger. It's thriving without MTX (as far as I know - haven't played in a while). But again, it's a beast of a game, and requires hefty hardware to get the full experience. 
---
Like you said though, you can't have it all ways. That's probably the bottom line.
---
The biggest benefit I can think of as it stands is that you do not have to worry about visiting an area and it being bone-dry empty.
---
There's actually so many places that have more . . . oomfph / terroir to them when they haven't been picked clean 100x / filled up with goo piles before you've seen them.
---
As well - getting stuff like lead is infinitely easier. Just visit the always stocked gyms.
---
As for the reports of people seeing dead bodies / goo piles - I haven't seen any on anyones private server.
---
The one thing I have experienced is a one-time glitch (had this happen on adventure mode too) where upon spawning in a densely populated area I killed off a few mobs 'fringe-style' upon spawning in (as soon as I loaded I watched them drop dead in a neat radius).
---
I really hope this gets fixed but it’s infuriating that it’s gone this long without getting fixed.
---
You can yup! I always place mine near v9 for queen runs
---
Oh my god! They heard our feedback! Its just what we as players have always wanted!
---
LIGHTWOOD LAMINATE LIGHTWOOD LAMINATE
---
Not recycled - loot is not instance based - so whether you loot on private or public. It will reflect on the other as well.
---
I bought the collectors edition directly from them, so 240 after shipping and now they want another 100 a year from me? Bethesda is turning into EA and are just going to be making cash grabs everywhere, not gonna buy starfield considering im sure they will do the same thing with the creation club and have modders add content to their game for money, and no way i will buy elder scrolls at launch, rather than launch a working game they are now dropping them broken and charging more money for fix the game in forms of subscription services and creation club. What a garbage company
---
Yeah, I think I remember reading that the other day. You said something like they'll never surrender the code (of course) -- but what are the chances that the code is so simple that it could be reproduced, at least on a small scale for small private servers?
---
EDIT: Nevermind, I'm thinking of someone else. I'm picking up what you're laying down here though... let's do itttt
---
Lmao need a tissue? No one cares you are done. Just quit. End of story.
---
Let's just hope this is indeed a Fallout version of TES for once.
---
Wow bold move, asking for *more* premium content at a time like this...
---
Bruh, this whole thread is about how much it costs in other countries
---
Do you not know that other countries also use $ for their currency? Like, the context is here fully, you're just too stubborn to bother acknowledging it because you're more focused on arguing that you're right when in fact, you are very much wrong here.
---
Not sure - I would assume garbage collection of instances is done immediately once the last player leaves the instance. But without actually kidnapping a beth engineer and torturing him for days on the secrets of how the server instances are managed I won't know :)
---
Its secretly a ploy by the government to get kids away from screens and electronics and go into more physically social hobbies *puts on tin foil hat of sarcasm*
---
I overheard a bunch of guys using exploits like this to win at PvP.  One guy was teaching the rest of his clan.  The simple fact is that PvP in Fo76 is broken.  You just haven't realized it yet....
---
Personally, I like PvP in general.  But instagib isn't my style of game.  PvP should have modifiers that sets damage output and defense levels to the same, with minor variances for different weapons.  At least that way it becomes a skills contest, rather than who shoots first....
---
Sending friend request.   Level 20 typically play solo, but would team up for events and general play (just don’t usually find people with microphones.... which is a pain to try and emote your way through the session)
---
 There is no such thing as a soul. The Buddha was quite specific.
---
for 200 a month you can play on a private server with Todd Howard.
---
That's a distorted view of the other side's arguments and a purposeful downplay of the negative sides of the subscription model as it is right now.
---
There is no denying that there is a lot wrong with it and things could have been done way better. [Here's how I would have done it](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/do6yoc/all_the_changes_from_falloutfirst_should_have/f5kdmaj?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share), if you care to hear the other side of the story.
---
“Bethesda didn’t put anything on the atomic shop that I personally like, SHAME ON YOU BETHESDA”
---
Agree. And it's funny that you can manually start Encrypitd. That one can be done with random players but  you really need some coordination to do PP.
---
Praise Him!
---
Christ alive, which country are you in? NZ?
---
Agreed, I've been playing since beta, even preorder tricentennial, after that slap in the face I uninstalled the game. I can't play anymore cause I just get mad at BGS/Zenimax for how little fun I'm having. I just started over in NV and I'm messing with mods for the first time on FO4. I've had so much more fun than I was pretending/wishing I was having the last year playing 76. Not trying to hate but this is honestly how I  feel.
---
I've got some clown makeup over here for $99 a year
---
Are you speaking in some sort of meme language wtf are you talking about?
---
These good bye I’m leaving posts should be disallowed. It’s merely spam.
---
From a player who probably has 1000+ hours in.
---
Yea man you're right really simple lol.... /s
---
I'm hoping that's what wastelanders does.  I'd hate to lose the existing content in the game.  I think it would be better if the map just expanded out with the people who returned.
---
Can you still buy the fridge and scrap bot or are those gone now?
---
In an mmo, which fallout 76 is kinda like, both phrases are equivalent to eachother
---
My closest experience to that would be when I heard a man and young boy playing together at the man's camp.
---
The man was high 100s and the boy was somewhere around 80s.
---
The man kept talking about the boys mother, calling her "smoking beautiful," "gorgeous," etc.
---
I'm not sure if he was like the kid's dad/step-dad or just some random dude trynna get in this kid's mom's pants. Lmao
---
Perfect
---
I see your point here, but why all the people explored so fast the 76 map?
---
It is literally 4 times the map of fallout 4, that's like a fusion of the commonwealth, far harbour and nuka world with YET another map.
---
Make another map will cause server problems. Look, I LOVE your idea, but let just wait until wastelanders comes out and the games fixes with it. Then, we, as a community will send all the feedback as possible for a new map.
---
Btw, I'm lvl 111 and I didn't even discovered half of the map. What level are you to be so bored of the standard map?
---
I thought Atomic Shop updates on Tuesdays normally?
---
Sweet! I’m gonna try this! Thanks for the tip! I didn’t know the tent was a PvP tank! 
---
Just kidding, I don’t PvP.
---
Yea I am like Halloween is not far away, where are all the other stuff? They already released the Halloween camp pack late enough imo.
---
I feel like some of the map could have add stuff added to it- the northern part of the mire is pretty empty. And the bottom Center of the map also
---
Sure I understand the limitations of the world space and there's a limit to the initial map size, but they could add new areas 'off-site' like they did with Far Harbor and Nuka World. When F76 was first announced I really hoped it would be the Fallout version of TES Online, but so far it's just one severely shrunken state.
---
Try reading that again. I said I did play the game but after I saw BGS wanting more money for shit that should be free I decided it was time to move on and let this game reside in others consoles.
---
&gt;  but the cost to develop and make a game surely has gotten more expensive.
---
The market size (number of buyers) for the games has gone up a lot more then the cost of making the games. There is no need to charge a larger number of dollars, other then the prime-time TV advertisements that AAA games now purchase with the same pool of money that could be used for development.
---
 - Yoda on DLC
---
But he could also do the same without the tent. You're just  snivelling
---
Gotta think on your feet. Still not p2w.
---
For all my posts shaming Bethesda/Zenimax, I will say the social aspect of this game has been incredible. I have met some truly awesome people in this game, and it seems to have a social aspect many games try to achieve and rarely do.
---
Halloween stuff starts tomorrow.  Check back then.
---
 They did nothing to you. You are hyperventilating over a very reasonable charge for the private servers everyone seemed to want.
---
You know honestly depending where the money is going(assuming going back directly into the game) its actually a good thing.
---
I'm sure it will one day, the games got a long way to go if it lasts, so much potential, let's see if Bethesda will ever get there
---
Id kill for my little pony skins
---
People that make post these like this don't understand. This being behind a pay wall does effect you. Would you use these things? If you answered yes, then it has effected you. 
---
Are they "winning" because of it?
---
No, because there's nothing to win, but they are able to have a better game experience because of it.
---
And ultimately, it's about what was promised. As consumers we were promised a cosmetic only atom shop. We were promised that no content would be locked behind a paywall. The only understandable part is private servers, and I believe when that was announced it was even given the caveat of needing to be paid.
---
Horizon zero dawn did something like this for its expansion, added a bit onto the corner of the map you could climb to and was it’s own extra little map! There’s definitely scope to add more map, although there’s areas of the map with very little there that they may rather add too before they add more map!
---
This is pure chaos, I love it!
---
They’re still there.
---
Absolutely agree.  It looks good on the .44.  Not so much the lever.
---
I agree. This was just one huge scam that ruined the game further. We already payed for the game, already can buy atoms, why the hell would they need that much more money?
---
Oh come on...regardless all the shit going on, atomic shop is indeed a joke.
---
Agreed!
---
Online purchases in the US don't always include tax, so you're only typically paying $60+tax if you buy it in person tbh. Even then, the highest sales tax for the state is 7.2% in California, and some states like Delaware and Montana have 0% sales tax, and we don't have a federal one. Some places also have local city or county taxes, but I do not want to do the googling to figure those out lmao. Since £100 is $128 USD right now... Still off by a few bucks.
---
So uhhhhhh yeah fuck the games industry for just milking everywhere else on Earth for astronomical prices.
---
For me personally it's more the fact one can easily out level the forest, toxic valley, ash heap &amp; parts of savage divide without too much effort. Sure the early level grind is actually kind of difficult if you rush it, but if you dawdle too long it's far far too easy in those areas.
---
I rarely find myself in the the first three any more unless I'm thinking along the lines of "well I haven't been there in awhile."
---
I'm still finding &amp; enjoying details I missed exploring those areas across my 4 characters, mostly unmarked locations or easily missed details, but outside pure exploration for explorations sake they're wasted territory especially past 50.
---
I disagree that gaming is innately more expensive now.  I mean, if you were around in the 90s, you know those Super Nintendo carts would sell for upwards of $75 apiece, for games that were much simpler than anything we have now.  Anything with special chips, like Super FX, even more so.  Can you imagine?  Every copy of a game coming with its own graphics accelerator that you have to pay extra for?
---
Nowadays, if you spend full price, you only have yourself to blame because given a couple months, everything comes down.  The people who get fleeced are the ones who have gotta have it first, and maybe it's just me, but I lack sympathy for people with that attitude.
---
I also think that part of what attracts us to Bethesda open worlds is that they generally *are* a good value.  You would whittle away hundreds of hours in Fallout or Skyrim, let alone their copious mods.  They were making "forever games" before forever games were even a thing.
---
Did we just become best friends?  ;)
---
Maybe only for Fallout 1st?
---
For real I had stopped playing because I had no desire to compete with dupers. I came back because of fallout 1st, and I'm enjoying the game much more.
---
Because the state of the game has vastly improved since launch and while its far from perfect it’s still way better than it was at release. They have spent this first year doing exactly what I said most online games do, I was never saying or trying to make the argument that it was now perfect by any means. Also because you’d be surprised how many people are on this sub who don’t even own the game and have never played it, but just come on here to crap on it for the laughs or because they somehow think FO76 has delayed/pushed back the release of ES6 and their sloot mods, probably about 25% of the people on here.
---
I love how you’re trying to justify why you think it’s a terrible value. Go cry elsewhere about how it’s unfair, to expensive or whatever else you think. I honestly dgaf about anything you think, maybe your mom might
---
Level 90-odd. Don't get me wrong it took a while to explore the whole thing, but there should be somewhere else I can vacation without leaving the game to until exploring appalacia feels fresh again. Maybe they could, like, remove randomly discovered places from your map while you're in another region? Like you start to forget them and have to explore them again when you return?
---
You know, the beautiful thing is, you can come back years later, having only bought the base game and still play. Well, that is this hateful, uninformed, fanbase let's it live that long. Hope to see you when things get better.
---
That's honestly one thing im looking foward to when i eventually become a father, showing them my favorite games especially fallout
---
Yeah the community is awesome
---
Hmm possibly, although if it gets too cluttered it would lose the wilderness feel.
---
More like I would rather discuss it but only if it feels like it's getting somewhere but if no ones stance is gonna budge then what the point?
---
It is not hoarding though. I am usually selling 10-12 weapons and 10-15 armor pieces at my vendor. Can’t have more because of stash limitations (even after many hours of tweaking and disposing of useless stuff) so I have to drop legendaries because of the ridiculous daily cap on scrip and caps. Fallout WORST member doesn’t have to deal with this annoying shit a much as regular players.
---
This is why people are pissed off. Bethesda created a artificial problem, just so they can sell the solution. This is extremely poor design and is exactly what they do in those mobile games. Create a promising but somewhat shitty experience, but offer players to pay in order to make it less shitty.  
---
After all, if you enjoy this kind of monetization, you will like whatever Bethesda has prepared for you. But don’t ever expect this game to improve much. Improving it will mean ruining their business model. And nobody wants that, right?
---
Looks like you found the combat armor dense mod.
---
Yeah, I agree- I love the toxic valley but not much reason to go there- I think that will change with wastelanders seems the main base is the space station
---
Either way he sounds like a nice dude.
---
I think your point about privilege is a valid one. It’s also important to recognize that the cost of developing the increasingly massive games that players expect continues to rise while the retail price of games has not. 
---
There needs to be a balance there, and it would be ideal for developers to police themselves—but that just hasn’t really happened. I recognize and respect the need for developers to make more money, but I still expect them to do it in an ethical way. 
---
A good place to start is for developers look at the ethics of what they’re offering to customers. Instead of “Paying more gets a better experience” it should be “Paying more gets more stuff” or “Paying more gets more playing experiences”. 
---
For example, if FO1st offered discounted Atoms and cosmetics only, I would have no issue with the ethics of it. The price may still be questionable, but players wouldn’t be losing anything by not paying.
---
By including things like the Scrapbox, we now have a situation where players who pay more, get to spend less time managing inventory and more time actually playing. Inventory limitations are an entirely artificial construct, so it doesn’t fit in what I would define as an ethical service. If it’s technically plausible to have scrap be unlimited, then that should be available for all players.
---
Now we can look at Private Worlds. While one could argue that those equate to a better experience, it could also be argued that they are simply a different experience. They also carry an additional cost to the developer, so charging something for access to them isn’t unreasonable. This would be an example of “Paying more for more experiences.” Yes, the paying player gets an experience that others don’t, but the player who doesn’t pay doesn’t lose anything either. So, while less ideal than simple cosmetics, I’d still define this as an ethical model, especially considering that it delivers a unique experience that some (but not all) players want. 
---
Basically, charging money for more things, more content or more playing experiences is fine, provided that those new things don’t deprive those who don’t pay of anything—or necessitate the inclusion of “no-fun” mechanics in the core experience just to incentivize buying out of it.
---
&gt;Really? They told us we were getting free repair kits fridges collections and scrap kits?
---
That's not at all what I said, but when you're talking to someone who thinks Zenimax can do no wrong and would eat actual shit if Zenimax handed to them behind a $100 pay wall, it's not at all surprising how much effort they'll put into twisting your words to mean something they don't mean at all. We warned you that more advantage giving items would become monetized when they shouldn't be and you all told us we're nuts. Now here we are, "insane" and able to say "I told you so." 
---
And when I say "advantage giving," I'm not talking about the private servers I would gladly pay for if the subscription was just servers and atoms. I'm talking about the scrap box that should be in the base game and the forward tent that should be behind a quest with skins for it in the Atom Shop so you don't easily confuse your tent with someone else's. 
---
At this point, I won't be surprised if Wastelanders also ends up costing us money. Won't be the first time they've gone back on their word.
---
they'll never surrender the code - but thanks to their lovely coding ways the client tells me almost everything I need to know .. to the point that I can let the client connects to my own server and login ;-)
---
Your comparison doesnt quite work.
---
1. Minecraft does have lots of microtransactions to support free updates. If you don't believe people buy them, I'd like you to meet my nephew.
---
2. Both diablo 2 and 3 had expansions, which I paid for. Lord of Destruction and Reaper of souls. While not microtransactions, they both were the cost of a full game at their reslease.
---
Fo76 has had TONS of updates. For free. And you don't pay a dime for public server access. You are getting the exact same thing as diablo seasons did. And now, instead of black market SoJs people now pay Bethesda for convenience instead.
---
I think the amount of people speaking so openly about their distaste for the game situation is pretty telling, especially since this is THE spot to talk about the game.  There's bad criticism that is not constructive, and then there's good criticism that is.  You'll always find a mix, but it's definitely not all mindless.  People *are* upset.
---
I think there's a big difference between wanting something removed, and just expecting a mark of quality from a product that has been notoriously messy, and unpolished.  And that's not even really debatable either.  Because that's where we stand.  Survival was removed, Wastelanders was delayed, and its stead we've only gotten a subscription service (costing about a quarter of the price monthly of the game itself) that has its own issues despite costing money and being a 'premium' service.
---
Here's the thing, you seem to be implying that because there's an audience for it, that it makes it okay for Bethesda to push out things that aren't polished, or are arguably just bad value for what you're getting.  
---
Make no mistake, there's always an audience for certain things, but that doesn't make everything a company does acceptable for you as a consumer.  So, I guess if you're asking a question of ethics, then it brings me back to when Bethesda and Valve teamed up to create an outlet for paid mods that certain people most definitely were happy with paying for, but when detractors grouped up and found it all very distasteful and that venture was subsequently canned (for a few years at least), then I would say yes, it can be depending on the circumstances.  
---
But I don't think anybody with reasonable criticism is expecting Bethesda to just forfeit on the subscription service and run with peoples money and features saying "We were wrong!", so nobody is going to have their things taken away from them.   But it doesn't mean people can't critique how Bethesda operates their service, and overall how they handle the game.
---
I just think that they should first provide a good product before asking for more money is all... I want 76 to be great and I want to love it but I see this and I think that they're just gonna see this as an excuse to not fix the fundamental issues of the game and add more superficial guff. I wouldn't mind a subscription model like they have so much if I felt like they would continue to fix the game. As I see it now, however, it doesn't look like they're gonna put this money towards improving the game,but rather (from what I've seen from them in the recent past) will just use it for surface level "improvements" that don't tend to the bigger issues and serve only to keep player online longer until they can get more money...
---
No prob bro. Maybe you should just get off the sub and stop playing if it’s that terrible. Focus on furthering your career so 15 dollars won’t break the bank
---
Couldn’t agree more. Haven’t done all missions tho so hoping there’s more like this
---
good discussion.  quick point i'd like to add:  part of the reason pc players are so upset i think, is that beth/fo/tes games u could mod the hell out of.  the way they set up fo76 was to cut that down.
---
taking away that capacity from the players is result in pushback.  idk if beth/howard realize part of the reason ppl play their games for "ten years or more" is b/c of that modability
---
I rarely see people in those spots at all tho. I go to the unmarked pond (in North mire) due to the large amount of Mirelurks but never seen anyone else lol
---
Anything beyond pure cosmetics. If it makes a grind easier, gives you better gear, or even gives you extra bank space in a game purposely gimped to make you want more bank space... it is p2w. If it gives you a pretty pink skirt or a flashy sword, I could care less, unless there is some competitive advantage to having a flashy sword (eg perhaps the world is really dark and you need to pay to have a light source)
---
ROFL.  COMMUNISM IS THE VERY DEFINITION OF FAIL-URE.
---
''' The response on social media, Reddit, and gaming sites has been pretty negative, but internal metrics reveal that a much larger than expected" amount of players bought the one month membership, with "a bit more than what we thought" amount of players buying the year long membership.  '''
---
I haven’t had the game that long so I don’t really know how much this often happens but that sucks man, where is the fun in that.
---
I haven't been there lately, but supposedly, there's a fair bit happening in the northern part of the Mire these days in preparation for Wastelanders.
---
That word doesn't mean what you think it does.
---
No, health care is paid for by your employer, it's charged as a fraction of your wages.
---
It's really an income tax but the money doesn't go to to government it goes to the social security fund, which is jointly run by the trade unions and the employers confederations.  There is also a top-up element paid to mutual owned insurance companies.  Works pretty well, pays for 100% of my and my family's health expenses.
---
Oh I’ll go explore it again today.  Repair your guns first haha. There is an insane amount of enemies in one of the unmarked ponds
---
Theres a new set of glasses in store today.
---
When you play the game the disconnect between reality and this sub is pretty obvious. Players are out there enjoying it while people who admittedly don't even play it spend their time here bitching and moaning.
---
Lol, it's what this sub is going to devolve into haha. Can some one play with me, I need help, it's boring, its lonley in my PW.
---
Did I mention all your personal data is transmitted via JWT session token only encrypted by a single ssl certificate that a MITM can easily circumvent? ;)
---
I think damage resistance is different from damage reduction. In the intinial nerf to Sentinel assassin's gear, Bethesda claimed that people were able to become invincible. But I don't know if there was a cap placed on damage reduction since.
---
Milf
---
You are right, but if Bethesda was smart they would give you the option to host a server on your own computer, then the cost of maintenance is on you.
---
&gt;The mechanics of the game say differently.
---
He killed me
---
I killed him
---
I killed him...
---
Went on for a while until I gave up. Such fun and thought out gameplay...
---
Because there really isn't a real win/lose condition at all.
---
The reason I say the are faulty. Bring back survival.
---
In adventure pvp should be through an invite system. Like teaming up but to fight.
---
On equal grounds, with equal mindsets. Is it really that hard to understand?
---
&gt;He won your junk/caps/workshop/salty tears.
---
I didn't have any junk on me, the cap amount is too low to be considered a win and like most of the times he left as soon as I gave up.
---
And I think it's pretty pathetic if you consider ruining someone's fun a win. 
---
And again he has a private world.
---
It was just textbook griefing.
---
That's your response lmao so clearly you have no response
---
I’m happy for you man, games, no matter what their state is, always has a great/decent player base, it’s good to know I’m not the only one who had a good experience with F76
---
I’ll have to thank you if battlebot ever drops this for me
---
I kinda thought that, but there was a couple more things today. Cool cool
---
Bethesda has destroyed gaming FOREVER with this! It’s the most horrible idea to ever be thought up in the history of mankind! Every decision Bethesda makes is total garbage and I’ll post on Reddit every day what a piece of garbage idea anything they do is! I’ve deleted this game 14 times over the last year in protest! Once, I installed it, just so I could delete it again, and I’ll post here about how I’ll never play this game again every time they add anything ~ Hater redditors
---
&gt; There's no lootboxes, so it's not a gacha game. 
---
Not yet.
---
I explain it in another comment. It really was griefing.
---
I'm betting to you nothing is pay to win.
---
That's sounds good, but again no-one is satisfied with everything this days. So for you and me can be a great idea, but for the others it maybe not.
---
Just think about the map of fallout 3, it felt fresh inclusive being smaller than the map of fallout 4, and it didn't needed that mechanic of forgetting places. Besides, it wouldn't even be lore friendly, why would your character forget about the place?
---
1- the vault 76 dweller lived on pre war Appalachia he knows the place.
---
2- Your character knows where he is before even being there, like if you're near a farm your character already knows he's near a farm.
---
3- You mark the location on the map. A PAPER MAP. So unless it gets destroyed you will always be able to consult the map.
---
Hmm not sure, I didn’t hear no numbers being told haha
---
In this game it's one in the same, PVP is just as much about having more and better items as it is winning against other players in competitive game play
---
I foresee stable flux becoming the new currency with the unlimited junk storage. Players without the ability to store it are going to be at a disadvantage when it comes to dealing in high end items which pretty much defines advantage in this game. Collecting more items then another player seems to be the main type of PvP in this game and combat is secondary.
---
They are rebranding to the less hardcore gamers, the ones more willing to stick around as long as they keep getting cool stuff that don't know any better as they haven't been following the games.
---
You mean the "New Vegas is the only Fallout worth playing" sub?
---
You seem very smart.
---
Thanks for the awsome tips,question though where can i find the plans to make the serums myself?
---
I’ve played since day 1 of the stress tests and still actively playing. Dupers didn’t ruin anything for me personally. I’m not a PvP’er so survival wasn’t going to be a thing I’d do anyways. 
---
I have the subscription and love it especially with friends! It’s been great doing events, launching nukes (only once) and not having to worry about some random high level one shotting the legendary screwing everyone else over.
---
Thats not a spam lol. Check my profile :p Ive honestly stopped playing and simply wanted to say thank You.
---
I came across your other post for post dumps regarding the same issue, so you've been dealing with this for several months already.
---
Do you have a page file setup at all? Seems silly to ask that when you have so much RAM, but some games dont seem to play nice without one, but also dont explicitly state that its required.
---
&gt;Unfortuantely game goes in direction (or doesnt really go in any direction)I am no longer happy with. Anyways it was a pleasure, and I hope we will meet in future Fallout games!
---
Same here! Check back in a few months. Often companies roll DLC into the base game when they see how it stops all new players from joining.
---
&gt;Once you start down the dark path, forever will it dominate your destiny,
---
Cool ill try this i haven't done this before what bulk items are worth more?
---
Nope, no Todd or Pete
---
areyouawizard.jpg  
---
But seriously, that sounds promising. Keep us posted! *(Maybe in secret -- Todd is watching us)*
---
Yeah the same, oh wait a sec... Don't you mean the "OMFG! FALLOUT 76 BURNED OUR CROPS RAPED OUR WIVES AND POISONED OUR WATER SUPPLY!" sub?
---
That scorched inside the airport never will. He's a glitched out enemy and isn't really a legendary. Been that way for months.
---
I agree. I’m having a blast
---
Completely agree! I’ve met a lot of great people out in the wasteland and it’s been awesome!
---
Whatever you say man stop getting offended by something that wasnt directed towards you
---
😂
---
Yup, especially since i had the fast travel point idea over 5 months ago.
---
it has to be recycled as i loaded into a world with dead meat piles in an area i hadnt visited in days..
---
and loot IS instanced based, if someone in public server picks up an asylum outfit, and you visit the same instance and look at the spot where the asylum outfit was the other person picked up, you wont see it, because they nabbed the one the everyone is trying to get- just like with all the workout rooms with lead weights everyone tries to get on each server, once one person gets them, that instance on that server is now gone for everyone else until you server hop
---
Just sent you one (Haikiba) - and to others on here who did also, maybe we'll all get together. Eastern Time for me, can play until 10 usually. Mainly looking for Project Paradise and Vault 94 wacky adventures.
---
P2W in BlackDesert: having the "time gap" of farming for soft cap from 2.5 years without paying to 0.5 year paying.
---
P2W in FO76: Fallout First.
---
But IMO, the problem is not even the subscription itself if P2W or not, they released a fucked up game, lot of promised stuff not delivered, bugs still there, they lied about stuff like 16 times and shit list keep going, and then they do this...its pretty much unacceptable for most people, especially those whom have to work and value their money and hate being treated like a stupid sheep that will do anything for the loved franchise.
---
I don’t recall, but you bulk items at the tinkerers bench.
---
Also another good money maker are certain outfits, like rangers, golf skirt and a few others sell for like 25 ish can’t remember exact and they hardly weigh anything
---
There be a topic.. somewhere in the depths of /r/fo76 that has a discord link on it..  which is still very empty but I do tend to post updates there on a daily basis. Only started not too long ago, but so far so good but still miles to go.
---
Awww this is so cute! I love this. Do you play on PS4 by any chance ?
---
 After seriously incentiveing Amazon, you shit all over the F1st small charge. ;)
---
Yeah those games are basically single player story driven RPGs. Ark was heavily criticized for releasing DLC as it's an early access game. There have been some instances of companies trying to monetize single player games with loot boxes etc. The thing with Fallout 76 is it was sold as a full price AAA game, which had a cosmetic cash shop, which has morphed into selling items that affect gameplay and now a subscription service akin to a free to play. The problem people rightfully have about it is people have paid the full price, some a premium price, and some even spent on Atoms to support the game buying cosmetics, and now it's looking more and more like a free to play. I don't need to list everything that has gone wrong with this game from the start. It was one disaster after another. It's mind boggling to me. They could be giving everyone 200 lbs of stash space. 3k atoms. Something to say thank you to everyone who bought the game and supported it. It wouldn't cost them a thing. They don't know how to treat their customers. They don't know how to make them feel good and appreciated. That's one of the reasons why there's so much anger.
---
The thing is: pay-to-win in a **survival** game isn't just about your armor and weapons considering a very large part of survival games is your day-to-day grind. When you can pay to largely expedite this process and free your time to do other less essentially but possibly more fun or more rewarding activities, yes the release of unlimited junk storage, the ability to farm mobs without fighting for competition, and the temp camps more than qualify in this context as "p2w".
---
Its a timegate mechanic, Bethesda is betting on our need for expediency over our disdain for such an obvious money grab. Exactly like mobile games.....
---
Yet here you are talking about Fallout in a Fallout subreddit instead of playing another game... kinda like an ex who just can’t get over it... lol
---
People need to stop complaining 😂 if you don’t like the game uninstall it and leave the group.
---
There are two types of loot tho, container loot and world loot, world loot is definitely instance based. Container loot is global (i.e. caps container)
---
That's a strong argument and explanation of pvp for 76. Thank you for sharing.
---
It's getting close. Post your own opinion here about how you're enjoying your Fallout 1st subscription and watch what happens.
---
I’m glad you liked what I shared, happy trails  ;)
---
So, non 1st players wear civil war uniforms from the graveyard. 1st players wear ranger outfits. Non 1sts get alpha, and firsts get Charlie and we fight over beta?
---
I've only logged in a few times since i bought the subscription. I am too busy with The Outer Worlds atm.
---
Glad they gave me a chance to support a game I love though. I have 0 interest in outfits and skins so they were never going to see a dime out of me from the atom  shop.
---
Yeah that's just the way the lighting system they've been tacking stuff on to works. The objects can only cast shadows within the engine, they can't make make a building, camp, or cave in an exterior cell during the day lighted like a dark interior cell (which is what the OP is referring to) because you can't "subtract" light in an area from the ambient light. You can only use shadows, and since shadows merge rather than overlap you can only make shadows darker everywhere, which is exactly what many lighting mods do for exteriors. Interiors they have a lot more control over because they can start with a dark or dim ambient light and add dynamic shadow-casting lights to it.
---
For now with FO76 I use Reshade which does a nice job of color correction (there's actually a greenish haze over the game, again) and making shadows and nights darker.
---
Disclaimer: this is just from memory, I haven't used the creation kit in years and don't know what may have changed in FO76's lighting and shadows.
---
Most of us are mad and disappointed that people blindly support these practices. They can't sacrifice something they -may- want to send a message and it feels like a losing battle to the marks that always pay up for this nonsense and that is frustrating to see.
---
Well try telling them how the shiny new Fallout 1st is the best feature in a fallout game
---
You might reconsider the fact that you're so salty about it is why he kept doing it.
---
My friend Moonpie007 is always looking for another female to play with, hit her up sometime!
---
my PSN id is FritoZ, i play alot more than her as she also is playing Borderlands 3 now, but we are very relaxed and play for fun when we do hang out
---
Im all about base building, i have a character with a maze base ill be breaking down soon to make a haunted house!
---
Typical. Thanks for the answer mate.
---
That’s cool. Good thing it’s a video game and not a stock on the exchange. Looks like all I have to do is spend money on something I enjoy and not worry about anything else.
---
Consoles users have to pay a yearly subscription just to be able to play the games they buy and do so willingly. 
---
Many others willingly buy extras to include other subscriptions because they worked hard and have the right to buy what they want and like. 
---
Entertainment overall, compared to say going to see a football game or baseball can also get very expensive! 
---
So in reality... a person is saving money overall for something they enjoy... it’s an individual choice.
---
What’s with the metaphors today?
---
I agree, toxic people are everywhere but it’s good we can share these moments as a community, your not alone out there
---
Said another lonely angry guy.
---
I means it's not a huge issue. Most everyone knows about it too. I'm actually pretty sure he's been that way since the start of the game.
---
I bet you made A in english! Cool story bro
---
It’s not about seeing Bethesda fail it’s their lack of acknowledging that this game has been a dumpster fire. And further more not compensating anyone who spent lots of money on pre orders and other things. I mean fallout 1st is just a spit in the face to all the people who paid extra for all the special versions of the game. At least give a discount for fuck sakes
---
From my perspective, it's when you can ONLY gain an advantage in a game by paying for something.   
---
In fallout 76, for example, you can either buy repair kits or you can get them from the SBQ.  I wouldn't  call this Pay to Win because there is an in-game free way to get this item. 
---
But if you could only gain this advantage by paying for it, then it would be pay to win.  It would be like finding out that the only way to beat a challenge would be to buy special ammo that cant be gained any other way. 
---
The new scrap box with unlimited storage and the ability to access it in both Private servers and public servers (remove stuff only) could be considered pay to win because there is no way in the regular game to get unlimited storage.  So people with private servers can farm unlimited materials and have them available in the regular game.   
---
I would argue that it's a limited advantage once you know how to farm and players have been using second characters as mules since the beginning, but it's still an advantage.  They also dont have to deal with griefers.
---
The problem is that Fallout 76 needs a steady stream of money.  Private servers helps offset this and it would be a hard sell unless there were some perks.  I think that they did their best to balance this while giving a minor advantage to paying customers.  Maybe it's a slippery slope, only time will tell...
---
**WHAT THE ACTUAL FUCK?!?**
---
*Please* tell me they're not sending unencrypted JWTs (as in, please tell me they're at least encrypting the JSON data and not just slapping a cryptographic signature on the token and calling it a day).
---
Collecting outfits seems easy enough I'll try it too thanks!
---
Done the vault twice now with 6 people in a private server along with launching a nuke... it was actually refreshing that there wasn’t issues you deceive that happen frequently on regular servers... my experience has been the opposite and have seen smoother gameplay overall.
---
I love how these guys never actually address what you write, if they did their arguments would fall flat so fast.
---
I have a feeling Wastelanders will add some new landmass.
---
Typically calculated heart string puller of a story does'nt excuse why you are still playing a game where Bethesda have created a dumpster fire of a game and then had the balls to charge subs for a STILL broken game with non-private servers...wake tf up!
---
You can literally leave and rejoin your own world. Repeatedly.
---
Well thank you for that but I was not contesting their price comparison. I was making a separate valuation statement "attempting" (because clearly you missed my point entirely) that an equal dollar to dollar valuation only has solid meaning if that one dollar has compatible purchasing power in both markets. One US dollar is worth about 20% more (right now) but that one dollar can but more of an identical product in domestic US than I can with an equal amount of money in my domestic market.
---
Is that a better explanation or do you feel I'm off the mark still?
---
&gt;A simple thing such as the ability to raise the level of all the enemies would go a long way in making this game more accessible to high levels.
---
Perhaps they are worried that having a private area to farm higher-level enemies would further imbalance the game in favor of 1st subscribers?
---
In this game? Not really... Of course p2w is real though. I just don't see the 1st stuff as winning anything. I mean, I would agree more if you said pay to grief. That might be a thing.
---
Gt listerfeign.  I’ll be on about 6pm est
---
One dumb ass got on stage and said cosmetic only, sure. But then an entire company of dumb asses didn't refute his statement until it got put to the test. As in they didn't back off his statement until they started selling what they said would be free. Which means they either planned on it and then at the last second made a switcharoo without announcing why which is definitely not a good decision considering their failing reputation. Or they never planned on following through, let the idiot talk, and then crossed their fingers no one would remember.
---
Either or it isn't excusable.
---
That’s very noble of you guys, I can’t believe how big the community is, 600 people is insane and I’m glad that’s the case because that’s so cool
---
The greifer thing is unfortunate, haven’t really had that happen more than once or twice in over 1000 hours of play.
---
As for the rest, an empty cart makes more noise.
---
The ones that are okay with things or don’t mind the occasional glitch aren’t posting long essays about how much they hate this or that.
---
And the economy in the game get screwed
---
They actually do technically, under consumer laws, owe a finished product to customers. What consumers got was a buggy mess that is still poorly optimized and buggy.
---
They don't owe anyone monetary value or goods. But they do owe us a functional, bug-free (as possible) game.
---
That being said, complimentary subscriptions for early adopters would go a long way.
---
Can’t exactly raid a private server... but shitty people can harass and ruin others experience in game but that I guess is ok... 
---
If anything people having issues will find another game... but I guess there isn’t any other games since they are still playing this one... go figure...
---
The sunk-cost fallacy is this game’s business model.
---
Once the private worlds have options like placing CAMPs next to each other and in location ("in the red," basically), I hope they allow us to buy them outside of 1st. I don't want anything in there other than the private worlds.
---
Yeah, Project Paradise definitely should have been treated like Encryptid and Scorched Earth. It needs to be triggerable by a prepared group. I always show up whenever it pops up, but sometimes no one else does. Though I will say, a lot of players probably look to see if people showed up, so I've found if you just go there immediately when you see the alert, you'll usually get at least one or two others. If they know what they are doing you can often keep at least one creature alive. But good luck going through the whole process of making the robots non-violent before the event times out. You really need at least two people doing that whole process from the second the timer starts.
---
Well, we all know that money isn't going back into FO76... The game is a mess.
---
People are only defending their sub purchase for a couple of personal reasons mainly, not because the sub has any legitimate value or adds much to the shallow puddle that is 76... Purchasers will find any way to be content with it, even if they lie to themselves.
---
&gt;Another week past and what do we get? A single skin and some fucking glasses.
---
Don't quite follow - there's a whole new bunch of Halloween stuff on sale right now..  it's not my thing but there's toys, decorations, turret and weapon paint, hay bales, fog machines, vending machines etc. 
---
Or has it updated already for next week? What's the single skin and some glasses?
---
&gt;PvP in Fo76 is broken.  You just haven't realized it yet....
---
It's just difficult to rise above. You have to sacrifice a lot of PvE skills for PvP
---
I know what you’re saying but we’re thinking like gamers they’re thinking like a business. The smart move in business brings in money. It’s not right. I get that.  But I see where they’re coming from
---
Fnv &gt; all big iron big iron
---
So Patch 14 made duping items a non-bannable offense?
---
Don't you use mules?
---
Well if we are going to start getting specific I actually was thinking about Tylenol when I made my original statement.  i believe that and ibuprofen get used more often than ASA anymore anyway (except as you describe)
---
I understand, it’s really cool having interactions in games, especially if they’re using a mic, that’s the first player I’ve heard using a mic so it was surprising to me

When you preorder a game, you're gambling on its quality. Up until the review embargos are lifted, you can only base that gamble on marketing; if you wait to preorder until reviews are out, you can see if people whose opinions you trust or generally agree with like it, which mitigates the risk somewhat. Or you can cancel your preorder based on bad reviews and remove the risk entirely, at the cost of missing out on preorder bonuses if you decide later to give it a shot. 
---
I can't think of another venue where you are rewarded for knowingly taking a risk and then losing.
---
I'm not necessarily against a consolation prize, of sorts, for people who gamble and lose on preorders, but based on how consumer-friendly BGS has historically been I don't really see them breaking the ground on that.
---
A bonus or discount for long-term players would be a reasonable goodwill move, though I don't know how warm the reception would be to a discount on a service many people are morally opposed to would be.
---
At the end if the day it's about money and publicity. Every company is that way. Without money there is no company. Without publicity, good or bad, people don't know about what you are selling. Quite often bad publicity does more for a company than good publicity does. People will investigate what all the bad us and end up spending money to do so. You TRULY want to get their attention,  let the forums go silent in addition to letting their wallets go empty. They already know that you're upset, but the bad press you're pushing for is only getting more people curious and wondering if its truly as bad as the claims are. Indirectly you are helping them more than hurting them. Anyway gonna go see what new games are out there and see what piques my interest.
---
The glitch is from the patch that added a max carry weight. Definitely gives them an advantage in market and hopefully Bethesda issues band for at least the more extreme case.
---
Haha basically “you’re a scumbag who enables Bethesda” and constant puke emojis. Been seeing it a lot with myself and others. Feel free to downvote.
---
Imagine reading somebody's critical, constructive, and actually wise opinion, and then say they're wasting their time expressing their thoughts. That's literally part of the reason we get shit like this shoved up our asses, shortly before the fact that some of y'all keep buying this shit. If you know how to be constructive and appropriate, never let ANYBODY take away your right to opinion and your right to criticize. It's part of the mechanism that guides us forward.
---
I thought thats what the atomic shop was for?
---
I feel like most of this applies to any fandom community on Reddit
---
I wasn't griefed. I was attacked in a workshop and unable to fight back because he had an invincible wall he set down between him and myself.
---
Why don’t you cry about it.
---
You really have your head under a rock if you think its a lack of communication fucking up Bethesda right now. Lets be very clear: it is because they have made an utterly garbage game at Triple A price, are overcharging for cosmetic items in the shop, and have now released a subscription asking for people to essentially pay for the game over every 6 months.
---
Even if they warned people months in advance, people would still be very very angry.
---
I can't spend 20 hours a day grinding in this game dipshit
---
Has literally nothing to do with the subscription at all... your focus should be on dupers and if that’s the case, you should be reporting any and all you see with video to Bethesda support. 
---
Flip side... I’m actually amazed that Bethesda couldn’t do a query on someone producing that much steel and wood that quickly especially after all the duping going on. 
---
The player still has to pick up the cleavers which would show in that players inventory one way or another as a whole cleaver or parts of the cleaver.
---
I said this same thing about stability in other comments and I spoke too soon. Last night and today my private worlds have been bad. Bunch of lag in menus and split second staggering when changing weapons or when chameleon mutation activates
---
Oh really? I thought it was only obtainable from a vendor.
---
...I think I need to make some updates to my account now. Thanks for the heads-up.
---
I apologize I should of made it clear I'm not talking about the complaints of the glitches i mean over stupid things for example everyone after every game says that fallout just became ruined by the newest first was 4 then 76 and honestly small things like that get old for example I cant talk to a fan without them talking shit on it like they hate the franchise because of some obscure reasoning that they dont even understand and yet call themselves a fan.

Eagerly waiting for it myself, I assume tomorrow. I also regret buying the glasses pack, they take up the headware slot instead of the eyeglasses slot so you can't wear them with hats, so be aware of that if you're thinking about getting them.

Hey, I'll definitely play with you if you ever get lonely. Fallout is a great game to experience alone, but it's nice to play with friends sometimes. Just let me know if you ever want a partner to run around with!

At the last, therefore, the Valar summoned the Quendi to Valinor, there to be gathered at the knees of the Powers in the light of the Trees for ever; and Mandos broke his silence, saying: ‘So it is doomed.’ From this summons came many woes that afterwards befell.

---
I believe so, or at least if you damage it and it blows up by itself from the "fire" damage it will hurt all players. I think if you detonate it with an explosive or something it may not
---
Sell to who? The vendors still have a daily cap limit.  I've been able to hit my cap just from regular play, selling bulked scrap, outfits, and even weapons that I find.  
---
You can produce more, but there's a limit to how much you can get rid of on a daily basis
---
The problem with the way it was is that no one would know if and when these events where going on. Theres no telling on how many times ive either missed campfire tales or fast travel to it only to get Event Completed as soon as I load in.
---
Right, but he didn't take your workshop. So bascially you were griefed.
---
Uh... Okay?
---
I don't understand how that validates these terrible business practices.
---
All of those hobbies have sizeable barriers of entry in the form of *physical things you actually need.*
---
If AAA video game companies were struggling to make ends meet, I'd 10000000% agree with you. In fact, I agree that overall, the *base cost* of games should be higher, at least, for well made/finished games in this era.
---
But these companies are raking in money hand over fist, funneling most of it into executive pockets. The prices are being raised not because of additional effort being required for the fj ished product, but simply because they can. And they're chopping up the games into parts and selling you one half without the other. It's predatory.
---
Imagine you paid to ski a slope. Half way down the slope, they made you stop and pay halfagain what you just did to finish your run. That would be crazy. That's what is happening here.
---
Uranus Fever would #1 on the list.
---
It’s cool that this game attracts every age,

Yeh that was my slightly unexpected discovery last night :x .. and in a way.. not totally unexpected either.. which is sad :/

Still in denial, I see...  it's okay, you'll figure it out eventually...   (grin)

If you have 30k wood and steel in your stash you'll probably get banned in the next banwave.  After learning about the glitch I've gotten into several arguments with people trying to sell 50k in bullets or 40k in steel because the only way this is doable ( unless your a Adderall farmer) is by doing the glitch. People insist they get the steel legitimately so I leave it alone but I see no value in bullets because of this. Alternatively, if you focus and just kill robots in watoga with a bat over and over again for an hour or so- you'll end up with enough steel and lead to make enough bullets to last you a week of heavy use.
---
Thank you :)
---
I do, with the exception of shadows on low to help keep my heat in check (laptop), but it runs fine with shadows maxed except then I'm running almost 80C instead of low 70's. I'm on an i7-7700hq, GTX1060 6GB, 16gb ram, SSD, W10.
---
I was having some crashing issues but traced it to the bluetooth xbox controller I was using. On wired USB the crashes and intermittent stutters went away.
---
please read at least before you send me a random link. the plan is not in the shop anymore for me at least. And switching servers doesn't help to fix this.
---
I never said anything about what kills THIS game.
---
I said it's killing *the video game industry as a whole.*
---
I couldn't care less what happens to FO76 at this point.
---
Wow. Really? I’m Xbox as well
---
I have chameleon and run weightless or I should say use to... I didn’t like the transition of going stealth and blurry constantly. 
---
I noticed not using it in adventure mode was better overall. 
---
Last night I played on adventure mode and noticed a lot of lag delays like not being able to fast travel to a vendor camp... mainly due to it literally not being there but showing on the map. 
---
I was right next to one on a map but in game wasn’t there. 
---
It booted me once, went back into another world and noticed same issues. 
---
I think it was on there side or something happening server wise or load was high.
---
It's IRRELEVANT, read ffs before you mouth off. They don't want to pay $179 AUD for the service; knowing how much that is in USD is completely impertinent to their purchasing decision. $179 AUD is TOO MUCH, regardless of what it converts to in XYZ currency. How is this difficult to understand??
---
to need steel for bullets
---
I personally wouldn't bully others over it, but considering I don't play the game, I'm not as passionate as a lot of people are, and therefor Bethesda's complete betrayal isn't quite a spit in the face, nor is a large portion of the playerbase opening their mouths and asking for more really affecting me. Other than mild astonishment at how..... dumb people are to actually buy into this crap.
---
You know, instead of just going "oh no the griefers are griefing!" why not think about why they are doing it, and when you have a significant portion of the population of an entire game start targetting a specific demographic, I'd imagine they have more of a reason than just wanting to grief.
---
But its okay keep generalizing these people, it makes it so much easier to dismiss them doesn't it?
---
All of that can be attributed to a group of people with wildly varying network connections.  If you've got people in that group from around the country (or worse, around the world), you're all connecting to the same piece of hardware, but some will be connecting nearby (usually the person who stared the private game), and others who could be hopping across thousands of miles of (somewhat) random network hubs across the globe.
---
The last guy, who took over 10 minute (!) to log in almost certainly had some sort of issue with his connection, whether ir was related to distance or not is impossible to tell though.
---
There are other possible explanations of course, but with one server acting very differently to different people, I'd guess t was something along those lines.
---
Why are you calling me a moron for no reason? If you can't discuss this subject like a civil person then just be quiet, please. And read the rules for the subreddit while you're at it.

Well, he’s not wrong. The only place I can remember the plan being sold is at Whitespring.

Are you on PC and do you use a bluetooth controller? If you do try using a usb cable instead of bluetooth.

Gneeeee gneeeeeee. Done
---
I think so, there's some items visible across the river that cannot be reached. There's a metal bucket some chairs and a few beer bottles across the river from the farms. They can be shot but not reached. if shot they fall over. Also they have twice updated and changed the area near the tunnel in Harper's ferry that would lead somewhere. I'm convinced that going to lead us back to Capital Wasteland. The radiation is really high right there so be careful checking it out.
---
I’m on Xbox and yeah it’s so cool seeing people helping their kids with games
---
It was never really a bannable offense, many of the god-tier legendaries on the market are well known dupes and only a few of the most egregious offenders got punished for it. Many months after they first started duping, that is.
---
but what can I do? that's pretty odd to me. I would like to trade it if it is possible.
---
Wasn't sure, thanks
---
It means I don't like what Bethesda did and I need a buzzword to rally other people that didn't like it behind me so we can pretend we're as relevant as the market forces pushing video game developers to monetize like this.
---
I don't want to die, not now at least
---
P2W is elective by It's own definition dude. But thank for actually agreeing thate FO76 has become P2W.

Do you wanna join me? You seem like a nice guy under all that bashing on others exterior. (: my gamertag is XauTak unless your not xbox then sorry we cant play together
---
Or $129 a year which is pretty close for the conversion.  But the monthly should be $17 to meet the conversion. Either way too rich for my blood.
---
Omg you're so butthurt 🤣
---
I'd like to do these as well.  They are the only events I'm missing plans from.  (IceFire_DH)
---
Who buys steel and wood?  Have I been missing out on some lucrative market?  Wood is quite literally laying on the ground everywhere, and steel is pretty common too.  
---
I have never had a need for either. Now stuff like Nuclear Material or Ballistic Fiber is another story, but even those once you know a good run you can get your daily stockpile.
---
&gt;Not wanting this spend real money
---
Oh, sorry, I'm from a time like 10 years ago when companies actually sold finished games and didn't nickel and dime every single step of content they could, and then add a few more artificial content barriers so they could sell the removal of those too.
---
Sounds crazy, right?
---
Lol. I love this community
---
I’m on Xbox
---
Got it for a month to try it, have 26k steel already. I can run while overencumbered almost forever so I clear an area, loot all weapons and junk items, break weapons down at nearest workbench, and drop my tent. Even if I cancel after this month I will never run out of scrap.
---
My son will sometimes wake up from his nap and sit next to me and try playing the game. Sometimes I’ll let him take the controller and my friends in the party will say hello and teach him things about the game. 
---
His favorite thing is dropping loot for other players haha. So if you ever see a bad filled with 300 stimpaks and some armor chances are it was from us lol.
---
I think anyone still posting in here DOES like the game, or rather, did like the game. I count myself as one of those people.
---
I took a break in August to wait for Wastelanders and other content. I had complaints about the monetization back then, and that's only gotten worse with this.
---
Yes, just turn the public servers into Survival Mode so we can get this over with already (JK)
---
Yeah right? 😂
---
Yet here you are talking on a subreddit for a game you don’t care about... got it... talk about an example of wasting your own time...
---
Yup :’)
---
Nah, it was just so unique
---
its both, no I mean LFG ..  you should be able to advertise you looking and trade.
---
But I am sure you will find someone here as well. Let me know else I can help as well but you better off finding a more active player than myself.
---
Would you like to play with me? We can go try and launch a nuke or something I havent done anything like that yet
---
Edit: I have 2 alpha pieces,1 bravo, and 1 Charlie. I dont know how to get more except a random ghoul soldier
---
I had read mostly the same experience here so far, just wanted this to be a warning to others like myself that this isn’t the magical solution to getting the game running as it should have been in all modes all along. I’m certainly not paying a dime to have the same hamster wheel service I’ve had all along
---
I'd send that support ticket.
---
CH would be pretty cool, I've seen enough of those in CS:GO that I would definitely appreciate that kind of a pattern here as well. Although at this point there's so much junk and so few weapon skins that I'd take just about anything
---
Wastelanders won’t cost money. They have never said something specific would free and then end up charging for it. Hence why I think you are insane. Over and over again they say wastelanders is free. They also won’t be selling weapons in the shop. You all like to extrapolate small changes into this crazy scenarios that are not going to happen. I bet you my entire inventory that wastelanders is free. 
---
And no I don’t agree with everything the company does. Scrap boxes for example shouldn’t be in game, period. Tent should be free for all. These two changes were a major miscalculation on their part. Thanks for keeping this discussion civil btw.
---
The network. Look to your connection. A flaky wifi will always be a problem with this game.
---
Is there a way to find a black Powder rifle on the highest level possible? I am not sure how the item scaling works in f76
---
Sounds crazy you expect free content the rest of your life on an MMO.
---
It's not like the developers need money to feed their families or anything.
---
you can always hide in my private world
---
Someone asked Pete Hines that on Twitter and he claimed they couldn't allow local servers because they don't use servers, they use AWS and th t's what their code is based around. I have no idea what that entails, though.
---
Interesting I'll have to look into that
---
I’ll bet you will be back before the end of November to be honest.
---
Depends.  Do you wanna do karate in the garage?
---
They want to get the $13 one out there for everyone to buy up first, then they might offer other options, private server only for $4-5 maybe
---
People banned? In this game?? Puaaaaahuhaauahhhh
---
Some 800+ hours and having a great time. Now I'm trolling with my Ranger Armour. It could hardly be better.
---
But it's not ONLY private servers. If it would be only that + the monthly atoms and maybe emotes and player icons, fine. But now other people with more money to spend have even more of an advantage over me. Life already is fucking unfair and now my way to escaped said fucked up world has become the same.
---
Dude... the whole point is if you are going to say “it costs $189” we should know what currency you are talking. $189 NZD is way different that $189 USD. The context is not here fully. What are you talking about?? How are we supposed to be outraged when we don’t even know the currency lol. Is 189 a big number? I don’t know. It depends on the currency lol.
---
Someone earlier said it costs 1900 pesos for them. If they didn’t say “pesos” we would have zero context lol. 1900 seems like a big number... until you realize it is pesos.
---
Go TF away fucknugget. You had to take something nice and make it negative. We get it your butt hurts. We don't care.

Lmao contracted plague walker mutation
---
But steel is so incredibly common.  Even my lowest level character is rolling in it.  Just place a camp near a resource node and you're making 20 an hour, not including whatever you pick up from farming.
---
Wood just take Woodchucker at some point and walk through some of the buildings that have wood piles near them and you will be set for wood practically for life. 
---
I just don't see who would legitimately be buying steel.
---
Guild Wars 1 was pretty great. I think there are still some people playing it. I haven't played Guild Wars 2 but I have heard it's good. Eve Online is amazing. If you haven't played it, it's not quite like any other game. You kind of play as a space ship. Like that is what you see as your character most of the time. But you're not stuck with 1 ship, you can buy and fly any ship if you train into them. It has an amazing atmosphere. The ambient soundtrack is awesome. It's not for everyone, but if it is your thing it's amazing and there's nothing else quite like it. It does take time to train skills, but training takes real time and continues while you are offline if you have skills queued up to train they will continue to train until complete. I haven't played many newer MMOs for the past years so I'm probably a little out of date with what's new with them, but MMOs are probably the thing closest to it. Think I might get back into Eve thinking about it.

I assumed that was probably the case, just strange that we were all getting issues or no issues at random times. I would’ve understood more if it was just the farthest away guy having trouble. I didn’t think to ask the folks where they’re located. I’m right in the mid-Atlantic east coast USA so I almost never have issues playing with anyone in neighboring time zones
---
I saw few legendaries at all yesterda, though I wasn't farming my usual routes.  I haven't run into a 0 star since the change.
---
It's a real thing, fixes getting rolled back.  It did cross my mind when they made the emergency update for the 1sters, but it didn't seem like a big enough thing to really worry about (at the time).  It might be worth going back to the update that changed the 0 stars, and seeing what else they patched that might be making a come back.
---
They are young and male and live inside a privileged environment.
---
Why yall hating on any comment I make I only speak from experience lmao
---
That’s really cool, sounds like you both had a good time :)
---
Really good point. Part of why I still play Skyrim is being able to change it up over and over again, as much as I want to. It adds so many new layers to the game. I don’t know if I’d still be playing the vanilla version today.
---
I'm sorry Turdsy I didn't mean to raise my voice. It's stressful Lone Wandering in the Wasteland you know when I get back to C.A.M.P that I expect some cold Nuka Cola and some Yao Guai Roast on the table please forgive me.
---
( Disclaimer for all the SJW's or millennials that are easily offended domestic violence is bad I know this so get the sand out of your vag and move on)
---
I mean I wouldnt doubt if that's a factor I have yet to meet a female player like that.
---
I’m not that far into the game yet, I’m only up to the responders missions lol
---
Well considering they BS'd the whole server instability thing with stacking junk I'd be inclined to believe this is BS too.
---
Yeah exactly :)
---
Ehrm... I have been saying this the whole time. I think you must be confusing me for someone else. Look at my comment history :)
---
Would you mind answering the question? I'm aware you and many others have fun, but since it's seen as a failure by the majority of people, and objectively has had spectacular levels of incompetence, can you see that paying them only encourages other companies to put in similarly low level of effort?
---
&gt; advantage over the non-paying player.
---
This is what it means. How could you not get that from his comment?
---
I fail to see how you played devil's advocate. 
---
Devil's advocate is when you argue for the opposing side, you did not do that.
---
Hopefully nothing bad got rolled back, and the legendary was a Mr.Gusty during AWOL, it wasnt the guaranteed one at the end, it was 2nd wave, part 2
---
Purchasing power/advantages which you cannot, within reason, gain through playing the game.
---
Good bye and hope that Bethesda do change and you(and many others Fallout "orfans") come back.
---
&gt;Sounds crazy you expect free content for the rest of your life on an MMO
---
I never said that. If you need to put words in my mouth to argue your point, it probably isn't a very good one.
---
I've been paying 15/month for subscriptions to MMORPGs since EQ in '99. I have nothing against sub services. I have *everything* against how they did it, lying through their teeth for first few months of release.
---
Perhaps they complain more because they can see others share their opinion. I am willing to bet more in the community outside of the subreddit dislike the new things, but don't say anything because they aren't on any forum-like setting. Plus, the ones still playing the game at this point are the biggest fans. A lot of them are the ones that follow that idea of buying everything.
---
Never had private server lag sooooo sounds like a pp  to me
---
Fair point. Still, I did so enjoy F4 mainly because of the expansions. I spent so many hours in Nuka World and Far Harbor that returning to the main map really did feel like coming home, especially in Survival difficulty.
---
I’m hard-wired in a decent sized city and usually have 100mbps+. Even using my Nintendo switch hard-wired playing splatoon which is p2p I never get dropped. I’ve even had Brits in raid groups before without issue
---
  Advantage over the non-paying player.
---
I’ve played since day 1, I couldn’t care less what the Jones’s had next door meaning if someone had a cool skin on their PA or cool item from the atomic shop. 
---
I have a lot of atomic shop items that I’ve earned atoms Ingame to  get. 
---
The people going after those with 1st subscriptions is literally the main reason they wanted them before and was asked for. 
---
People who enjoyed F4 wanted to do the same in 76 but with friends... unfortunately many have encountered issues which ruin their experiences. 
---
So this subscription happening isn’t a shock at all to me, I saw it coming 200+ days ago here in this very subreddit: 
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/b9tjh3/fallout_76_plus_much_like_the_eso_plus/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf
---
Yes people trade steel all the time on trading subs and discord markets
---
It’s really feels great 
---
:) just be sure to have a second gaming computer ready
---
That was really nice of them, I’m glad F76 has a great community :)
---
He's playing doubles advocate.
---
I’m hardly an apologist-but haven’t those been out for quite a while? Also not to mention some games that came out around the same time as 76-that had just as bad of a launch but have shown little improvement. 76 has a dedicated player base for a reason-I don’t play it because it’s a horrible game-I play because despite the obvious flaws and occasional messes the game churns out, there are quite a few positives. Feel free to downvote. Non black/white opinions are unpopular.
---
 I have never given them a penny for Atoms, that just seems stupid. I spent $18 Canadian for a month of F1st mainly to get the Ranger Armour to piss people like you off. 
---
 If Reddit had not exploded I would not have bothered. ;)
---
Don't care about the game, care about Bethesda and the state of monetization in the gaming industry.
---
Also, look at my name. This is my alt-account for trolling salt mines like this and /r/AnthemTheGame
---
Oh hooray look at all the “I never had this issue so I’ll downvote someone having an issue because they must just suck at this game” people showing up
---
The engine cannot be fixed and should have not been used in this game. It's been broken since Morrowind and now Warcry included multiplayer code to it, and made it worse.
---
They would fix it if they knew how.
---
Star Citizen? lol
---
You can get legendaries of it for sure. Got some 3 star one yesterday, not sure where I got it, wasn’t the queen though.
---
Apparently the [subscription is selling really well](http://mmogfails.blogspot.com/2019/10/fallout-76-and-fallout-1st-fiasco-it.html). Like even better than BSG imagined.
---
Have fun bye....ill see you on thos sub soon complaining about something, after you quit.
---
Yeah there's precedent for charging for private servers, it's already a common practice for online games.  It's charging for the scrapbox and tents (and bundling it all together) that really grinds my gears.
---
xD mcsaltmker xD
---
I don't know ask the data miners but every queen fight I've seen lately there are always a few very low levels and she still dies in less than 5 minutes..  Search for data miners AMA on this sub it's very  interesting in case you missed it.
---
Max caps, plus some. Quad on a Tesla is supreme. Explosive on a Tesla is Legacy. That being said, I don't play anymore but would happily hop back on the wagon if I had this beauty.
---
Its a legacy almost priceless
---
Lets face it, this sort of practice is already happening in many other games. MTX and subs are now the best way for gaming development companies to make money, so B jumped on that bandwagon too.
---
People vote with their wallets, so if you oppose what B are doing then don't sub to Fallout 1st. You can still play the game without (buying atoms) MTX if you want.
---
When modded to automatic That weapon is the meta of the game right now. It might not be the most popular or sought after but it is the most effective in pvp.
---
Pay to win means, the the ability to pay real money for certain advantages over the other players.
---
Need to buy a sub for that.
---
Not a surprise the one month subs exceeded expectations when they pay walled the most demanded outfit skin.  The real question is how many of those people held their nose, and have the same disgust that server stability is being hidden behind a pay wall, along with the unlimited junk stash they told us we couldn't have because it was "impossible".
---
One for me and one for my son. Under normal circumstances I wouldn’t subscribe to game pass ultimate for both gamer tags but given that it was $1 I figured it was the obvious choice.
---
Just see this advert and I came on here to see if anyone else had seen this, its a deathclaw, even when you see it from the rear....i call copy right.
---
Interesting. Question: if you cancel your subscription, you keep the the ranger armor?
---
ahahah
---
Guaranteed there will be additions to the 1st package down the line, it even has its own section in the atom store.
---
I got it to test it out... I also had a MS credit so it cost $40-/+ for the year. 
---
I think many assumed it would be a brand new world stuffed with everything but it’s exactly the same as adventure mostly. 
---
I’ve discovered that items picked up or NOT picked up may not be there the next day. 
---
This tells me that the servers or worlds are also based on other worlds not the sole one. 
---
I purposely don’t pick up items to test it and since no one else is there and the next day those items that always spawn aren’t there... says to me there is more at play on the server side of things. 
---
I say this since I don’t think many think that happens. 
---
I also tested this out with the weight rooms for lead... only once did they show up, I didn’t take them. Next day I went back and they were gone??
---
I haven't had very good luck this year.
---
FO76 (December 2018 actually)
---
Anthem
---
Borderlands 3
---
I'm a glutton for punishment I guess. It seems to be the new trend in gaming to release half baked games and make players wait for fixes.
---
I’m glad you had a good experience like me, I’ll be sure to check out filthy causals :)
---
I for one love playing fallout 76. It is an excellent game in my opinion.
---
  The subscription service finally gave me a reason to spend money and help the game out. 
---
I was never going to spend one dime on outfits or skins since that stuff just doesn't interest me.
---
 I've been playing mmo's since '03 with Horizons so I'm used to a sub fee.  I would rather pay a sub fee than micro transactions. Now i can.
---
 As for the lying, big deal, every corporation does it to sell their product.  That is the world we live in. You need to start learning to not hang on every word everyone says.
---
Yes. In your vending machine.
---
That has more to do with people who have ridiculous melee builds tailored to kill the queen than the number of people. I have a friend that can kill her in 4-5 swings by himself. He hits for about 60k damage.
---
Fallout fans aren't toxic. There are some deeply toxic people who play Fallout, but if they were instead fans of some other franchise, they'd just be miserable in that community instead. See also: Star Wars.
---
Just from your vendor
---
That's a drawback with any kind of private game/server situation.  When you're playing generally, you'll get hooked up with one of the servers that are relatively close to you (sometimes it's fenced off by location, other times it just looks at the ping time to the available servers...no idea how 76 does it).  But when you're attaching to a dedicated game, you're at the mercy of the distance you are to the server that that particular game is running on.
---
Also, almost no one has any understanding of how networks work, and how that affects things.  I can easily point at people using Wifi, where running a microwave can mess up your connection (once upon a time anyway), but getting them to understand that just because the traffic is fine from A to B doesn't mean that it's fine from A to C (...but I don't have these issues playing other games...).
---
Then again, I come from a time when most people had to *type commands into the computer* to use the internet.  I fear for the future generations...
---
Price = Your first born child and a Lambo
---
No I’m Xbox, sorry dude
---
Gotcha... just a troll... thank you for admitting that! I’ll give you credit for that, not many do! That’s actually refreshing to hear...haha!
---
Where did you get it?
---
I'll make up a counter analogy:
---
We are a neighborhood.  We all want nice things.  Knowing that our neighborhood needs money to maintain the roads and do landscaping, some of us are willing to pay into a HOA in order to make sure it keeps up with nice things for us.  As members we get some perks like getting to play in the pool.  
---
On the other hand, you have the individuals who refuse to join the HOA.  They register their cars in another state so they can avoid paying property taxes.  Some of them didn't even really give their money to any house devlopers, they bought the house second hand.  A few try to trick the HOA by paying their fees but then immediately getting a refund on the money after they got their access to the pool for a while.  
---
Sure those people bought their house like anyone else, and it seems many of them missed the fine print in the contract before the houses were even built that said there was going to be a fee to enter the pool, and they wouldn't be allowed to have their own pools, but are now mad about it.
---
Very cool. Thanks guys.
---
Sure, I’m Xbox
---
   Whether we like it or not, we live in a system where us, as consumers, have a vote for the kinds of products we want. That is with our wallet; the kinds of things we buy. Companies will not take the noble path regarding their business decisions most of the time, and they will listen to the consumers, but now what they say -- they'll listen to what they buy. We can rag on them for this, but it is the reality we live in.
---
   In situations ESPECIALLY like these, I do not believe you can resolve the situation by saying people should buy what they want, you can't judge them. By purchasing a subscription, you cast your vote, and what you voted for was a game riddled with pay to win features, microtransactions, etc. Nobody wants this. This hurts even more knowing that if I asked you, you probably wouldn't support such a game. Yet here you are. 
---
   Believe me, I do not think you should be attacked or harassed, really nobody deserves that, especially over video game. But if you care about what I think, I have absolutely zero sympathy for the situation you've put yourself in because people like really ARE the problem.
---
Dead game
---
If I could afford a larger hard drive for my Xbox I’d still be playing this game. I actually enjoyed exploring the wasteland
---
I'm giving you an upvote just to help negate the next downvote
---
Seems like a waste. 
---
But ultimately the issue is still the duping and not the infinite storage of scrap.
---
Wow 300 stims, that’s very kind of you guys :)
---
&gt;As for the lying, big deal, every corporation does it to sell their product. That is the world we live in. You need to start learning to not hang on every word everyone says.
---
No... Other countries actually have laws against this. This is only a fact here in the good old US of A.
---
But thanks for explaining exactly the kind of person you are/mentality you have for me.
---
Conan Exiles comes to mind. Especially the survival and building mechanics.
---
Fallout is a fantastic popular franchise and thus has many personality types that play the game. People are people some good some not so good and when you have a large and diverse amount of people you are bound to experience negativity. 
---
Even at church
---
Well then come back when Wastelanders drops
---
You're jumping to conclusions. I was talking about the people that actually have never played the game, and have no previous experience with Fo76, and yet come here to post angry posts talking about the playerbase, Bethesda and the Fallout 1st subscription.
---
I wasn't labeling anyone, it's just that it seems to be a trend on here. Something controversial happens, and then some people (I'm not talking about everyone) come to the sub just to jump on a hate bandwagon.
---
People who have legitimate concerns and criticisms for the game are not on said bandwagon.......however if someone comes here with the sole intention to talk about how shit the game and its playerbase is, they're on the bandwagon.
---
For example;
---
"The new subscription is shit and Bethesda should do something to change it"
---
: is a legitimate concern
---
"You all are fucking stupid for playing this game, you're all a bunch of shills buying into Bethesda's scams!" 
---
: Is an example of someone on said hate bandwagon
---
omg
---
Yes you do.
---
 The game is just fine. I play it every day still. 
---
 You are just a Reddit user and a majority is here is just loudness. Nothing real at all, and if you take the entire player base almost nothing.
---
 The game is fine, runs very well on the machine I built to play it. A 32" 4k screen that never falls below 55 FPS is very sweet.
---
 The game is a Fallout game they have put online and that's fucking hard. They have done a wonderful job really and although I have some sympathy for console players, its a PC game adapted to them, not the other way around, which far too common.
---
The price is not the problem, it's what they're selling. The scrap box should be free to every player. The extra fast travel point should be free to every player.
---
If they had rolled this out as "pay $10/month for the option to have a private server," it probably would have gone over a lot better with everyone.
---
The point of sharing how much I spent is to underscore the amount of revenue they stand to lose by alienating players like me who had already gone whole hog on the cosmetic atom store stuff but do not want to support a pay-to-win monthly subscription.
---
Come by my shop, all plans are 10 caps. You heard me, all plans, just 10 caps each.
---
There’s always enough to go around so why not, we gotta help each other out sometimes. And he realizes that more than me lol
---
It won't let me craft the mask for some reason.
---
Stop drinking frozen stuff? Or warm it up first? /s
---
From what I've been told on here, if you play NW first, it can 'complete' some challenges for you, robbing you of said rewards.
---
It just feels dirty. I feel lied to. I was told only cosmetics in the Atom Shop, and now we have a subscription less than a year since the game’s release. If this keeps going, I’m going to have to drop 76 altogether, at least till Wastelanders. I’m not even sure the Halloween event will have anything to bring me back, and I still play Junkenstein’s Revenge every year, despite that never changing.
---
Sure, a private world is nice, but the friends I have that jump at the idea of playing Destiny 2, a game with a somewhat rocky history of half-baked content, lost interest in this game before the beta ended. They came back for the events like Meat Week and the Vault raid, played a few more days, then left again. I was trying to get them hyped for Wastelanders, and then it got delayed and we get this instead? Not-so-private servers, broken scrap boxes, and atoms for increasing game-bending items...
---
I want to buy Fallout 1st, I really do. I really wanted this game to be great, I have 2000+ hours in Fallout 4, I love this franchise. But I feel morally dirty at the thought of buying it because I feel like I’m giving in to blatant exploitation. It feels like a repeat of Battlefront 2’s lootbox issue. It is just better to re-mod my Fallout 4 at this rate, at least the mods are free and I donate directly to the mod creator...
---
I WANT to give Bethesda my money, they are just making it increasingly difficult to rationalize doing so.
---
Yep. Hiding that behind the sub was quite ingenious. Greedy, but ingenious.
---
This is relevant how?
---
You’re referencing yet another **optional** feature in games that give **zero** benefit or advantage to those that **choose** to partake in it. 
---
Most battle passes are priced around $10 (some are more I’m sure) which represent a **fraction** of what a completed buy 2 play game costs. Even if you’ve shelled out for 4 Battle passes, you’ve only matched (or in many cases are still under) the cost of a normal game. 
---
I don’t support P2W and I think if there is **anything** in a cash shop that can provide impact in direct competition there is a massive issue. 
---
But the reaction to Fallout 1st is nothing short of a dramatic overreaction. The majority of people with large influence in the gaming community (like Angry Joe and other youtubers) only tried the game out in Beta and **trashed** the game. They never took the time to ride it out or wait for the game to improve (which if you’ve been actively playing you know just how much better it’s gotten). 
---
These same personalities are making the same outrageously over dramatic videos and posts condemning Bethesda for implementing an optional service in a non-competitive looter/shooter. 
---
I’d hate to see what they’d have to say about Warframe’s entirely optional cash shop that is far more P2W than Fallout 1st is. 
---
Oh wait. It’s heralded as the **premiere** game with a cash shop. 
---
🐸 ☕️
---
The people who made those games arent at obsidian anymore though, but I see your point.
---
Super odd- make a ticket
---
So far ive had more stable private worlds than not but we'll see. Here's hoping they figure something out and everybody can enjoy a stable game
---
Reddit is an echo chamber for vocal minorities and a large % of the current traffic to this subreddit is coming from folks who aren't actually playing the game and might not even own it in the first place.  Why? Because they like the drama and outrage.  It's also perceived as part of a greater issue in the gaming industry.  Also there are enough Fallout fans who are angry at Bethesda to where they have some giant grudge akin to Blizzard fans after the Hong Kong drama.  
---
The reality is that those actually playing the game don't give a care, or if they do they'll still buy those things anyway.  Folks want to troll and pretend that they're representing the majority when threads around here usually don't get more than a couple thousand upvotes.  And a good chunk of those upvotes are solely due to folks coming in to stir up the drama.
---
To be honest, as much as an unpopular opinion this probably is, I expect Cyberpunk 2077 to be delayed by a few months more likely than not. With a release date announced almost a year in advance, a number of CD Projekt's other releases in recent years having been delayed, the relative lack of news only a few months before the planned launch, and an apparent industry trend of many delayed games lately, I would not be surprised at all.
---
Discussing irrelevant shit on the internet and crying about people that difffer on opinions: dude get a life.?  
---
Actually braindamaged.
---
"top 10 things bethesda could rape my ass with and I'd thank them for it"
---
Spawn rate is tied to the number of people in the vault, so maybe you're shooting at more mobs while in a group than you were while solo. The only real way to track this would be to count how much ammo was being used for each run.
---
Agreed the nugget of fucks should go attend the hurt of butt.
---
Jelly fingers
---
Try posting there that New Vegas was a buggy mess at launch
---
You kinda need the tent to use the tent though.
---
Following
---
Don’t play nw before you finish your challenges
---
I just mentioned it in another comment, but tracking ammo consumption would give you proof that guns are breaking faster. Any chance you can look through some of your old solo streams and get a sense of how much you burned pre-patch vs what you're consuming now?
---
 Cool. There are many without such a good connection, perhaps some of the people you were playing with were less well connected..
---
It actually is. Paying 100 dollars for skins and a few amenities is fucking moronic.
---
I mean what Gary said
---
You obviously live in a world where there's sunshine and rainbows everyday and just consume product regardless if its good or bad. An Automaton mindless SJW style logic in a nutshell ;-)
---
Whats it like in your own reality?
---
I will buy it, how many caps you want?
---
I totally agree :)
---
What laws are you seeing and what country?
---
Well, at least you're not asking for their stuff, so kudos on ya.
---
Again, you have lost track of the conversation - the comment that set you off on your little tirade was not posted by me. So your talk about hopelessness and scapegoating should be directed at the OP. Please try and  keep up!
---
I do notice however you have decided not to address the comment in its regard to your beliefs on free speech. Sad to see your Constitutionlist stance fall to pieces under the slightest scrutiny.
---
However I did get a chuckle out of the phrase you invented... "passive aggressive coercion" so at least your comment wasn't a total waste of words.
---
How on earth is it possible to influence someone's actions through threat or force (coercion) while simultaneously avoiding direct confrontation (being passive aggressive)?
---
EDIT: I had to Google the phrase and see for myself... turns out there are papers on passive aggressiveness and it's use as an emotionally manipulative device in abusive relationships.
---
I fail to see how a Reddit comment has emotionally manipulated you into changing your spending habits but I do promise to take what you say more seriously in future. Consider this if you will a 'safe space' where your opinions and feelings matter... no judgement!
---
EDIT: a spelling mistake.
---
Same, and i love it
---
 They are mostly children. There are so many, humans breed like fucking rabbits. ;)
---
Hahahahahahahahahahahahaha ok buddy
---
Counterpoint: why waste what little play time I have mindlessly farming all that crap when I could just buy it from other players?
---
That's great, and really you would expect more powerful creatures to be 3 star more often than lower level creatures.
---
I have mostly run into one star scorchbeasts so far with the occasional two star. I'm curious if luck effects the spawn chances for higher star enemies.
---
Woodchucker + 15 minutes south of Flatwoods = 1000 wood
---
Shhh don’t say anything
---
I hope raiders won't be able to steal my tent and scrap xD
---
This weekend I was at 2 in 20, so...10% for me.  I guess I need to up my sacrifices to RNGesus.
---
Stop posting before they nerf it
---
Sort of, but it takes some micromanagement because you have to pull it out of the scrap box and put it in a vending machine, which counts against your regular stash weight.
---
Quit playing and leave?
---
which i find ironic given NV was a hot buggy mess when it launched but everyone acts like it was a flawless masterpiece from day 1.
---
for a while the only quest i could play was "FalloutNV.exe has stopped working." i mean yeah, it did get fixed, but a perfect game it was not.
---
I think duper can get caps much easier buy selling explosive plasma
---
Mechanically, ARK is pretty similar to FO76 and does the building part a lot better. Spin up a server and invite some friends.
---
No civil war going on in my private sever
---
No, luck has little effect on anything in the game, as much as you might hope it did.  Dataminers have checked quite a bit, and it pretty much does exactly what the tooltip says, and nothing more.
---
When wastelanders drops and the sub price goes up, we will be here to say I told you so
---
The price in USD (and therefore projected income of) a service provided by an american company is absolutely never irrelevant to a discussion about the pricing model of that service.
---
I feel like what you're trying to say is that that this person *feels* like it's too much money, regardless of what the conversion is, because they are only contextualizing the price versus their own needs and environment.  The word for that is *ignorance* because they're dealing with a service provided internationally by an American company, who are always going to price things with reference to USD.
---
Just saying "I don't care what it converts to in USD" does not, in fact, make that irrelevant - it makes you ignorant.
---
Lol I just read
---
"Wawawaaaawaaaaaaa :'("
---
Really, wood and steal? Lol you...
---
I’m on XB. I am in my private world 70% of the time.

The other 30% is just chilling and letting people shop.

I’m level 359 and had 1100 hours in game before F1st dropped. I enjoy the features.

I launch a shit-ton of nukes. GT is same name.

The reason is because it has addictive skinner box mechanics that trigger dopamine. We are hardwired to gather food, to pick berries, etc. It taps into that on a deep subconscious level. It's all about gathering and collecting for a lot of people. It satisfies something along those lines.
---
No. U blindlessly follow youtubers who dont even play the game. These youtubers are just freaking out for clicks. AGAIN they havent even played the game for more than 10 minutes. Who is the blindless follower now? Me or you?
---
Nice! I’m always looking for cap sinks.
---
Oh well. It runs so well for me, what are you doing wrong? ;)
---
 I use OpenMW these days but the Morrowind game, modded to the moon, is very beautiful and amazing fun to play.
---
an investment company wants a set amount of cash a month and is forcing bethesda's hand..

because corrupt greedy materialism has become common place in this industry and even tho we complain they still get their money
---
This was an old bug relating to high explosive damage. Shotguns are currently not bugged but useless at any range past melee due to the ridiculous damage falloff
---
You seem to care a bit too much, though. It's just a game.
---
I'm seeing closer to about 33% which is still better than farming WS and WT. Overall I come away with more legendaries per server hop farming fissure sites, and net more XP as well.
---
Oh wow level 359??? I didnt know you can get that high, I'll defiently add you hopefully you dont get annoyed by all my questions
---
But as I remember as a "leftenant" you didn't have the ability to lower them or completely remove them. Which constitutes some type of barriers.

My plans are only 2 hehe
---
I guess when you look at it like that I kind of feel bad for them, but then at the back of my mind there's some management person telling them to do something else, and not fix some crashing issue that maybe affects &lt;10% of the players. It would be nice if everything was completely transparent but we don't know what resources they are really putting in to fixing things people are having issues with. Like if there is a problem with the 1st items, they will get fixed in a few days. But other things that have been broken from the start never get fixed. Who knows for sure. Only people who work there I guess and I haven't heard from them.
---
That’s because you are trying to bait people, your post is not a spoiler just a report for rare bug.
---
There is a market for 76 on reddit as well as several discords. Posting links to the market subreddit unfortunately gets the comment deleted.
---
Thing is I didn't play nw. Literally to avoid that bug
---
Are there dragons?
---
Lag has been great on my private so far
---
You know, I heard that Wastelanders was already released on Fallout 4!
---
My experience is quite contrary, I find the community rather nice. Maybe that means I'm an asshole too, or I've been lucky in my encounters.
---
Additional content maybe... plenty of room to expand...
---
Man, you want me dead right? 😂
---
to me it means "i pay real money to be better than other people at the game."
---
do repair kits, fridges, and unlimited scrap storage suck? sure. but to me they aren't pay to win. they don't increase anyone's skill or damage output or defense. call me when they start allowing you to buy the purveyor's legendary drops with actual cash instead of in-game earned scrips, THEN i will raise hell. until then, all i see are conveniences for people who don't like inventory management.
---
I'm aware of that, but the thing is I actually haven't gone on nw
---
And people in public can leave and rejoin different worlds, giving them an advantage in farming static spots like the trick-or-treat costumes or asylum uniforms.
---
If you’re doing fissure runs don’t forget the kill a scorched with different weapons on your combat challenges. I racked up 200 atoms just doing that yesterday. Bonus; I finally broke out my bloodied black powder rifle. Big change of pace from the handmade!
---
Yes it is. Just the last few days of reading the posts here makes me worry that some of these people are either voting age or will be soon.
---
Then I am stumped. I've had this happen in the past, but never found out a cause.
---
thing is the use of both perk cards is not really necessary imo. ofc you get a great dmg buff, but with all the buff food everything is onehit anyway. with every bloody unarmed weapon.
---
its only good for queen. and even there with all the buffs i can get pretty nice numbers with all the other unarmed weapons, too. i guess even with a bloody knife at this point \^\^
---
Why do people use the word toxic like it has meaning in the context you are using it.
---
Icksnay on the scorchnay...lol shhhhh....
---
I literally just re-downloaded 76 for the 5th time when that was announced. Deleted it *again*
---
Deffinitely YOU! blindly playing a game thats been systematically destroyed in ALL YT videos who loved and hated the game. This current news regarding subs and "private" haha what a joke! servers is a goddamn travesty and people like you are why Bethesda continues get away with this shit. More Fallout fans are uninstalling than ever since this news and are starting to finally wake up to it.
---
This is adorable. Great job!  Pretty cool seeing the real locations. Thank you for sharing!
---
Me too. Something new is I joined social gamers network [gamerids](https://www.gamerids.com/)
---
Rads can be negated (to a point), so the ability to travel would still be somewhat open.  Plus, how did a square box of intense radiation come to surround this particular area?  Not much better immersion (though it is slightly better).
---
Other games use an increasing haze, where you can (seemingly) travel outside, but the surroundings blur increasingly until you effectively can't see anything (at which point, you get a wall, but no message, so you don't know if or how far you're moving).  I always found that to be a bit less jarring.
---
But, in the end, it's the limitations of the engine that are going to dictate what can be done here.  It may not be possible to have a more lore-friendly or believable way of restricting you from leaving the game boundaries.
---
best response I've seen.  This is absolutely not Pay 2 Win, it's pay for convenience.  Some people are upset and think they should get more for free so they scream on reddit and stupid youtube videos...
---
If you have trouble with the interfaces my mod im running fixes most interfaces, except the new scrap box(aka one menu button is missing, otherwhise all works fine).  [https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout76/mods/2](https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout76/mods/2)
---
Jesus fuck dude
---
You need to exit the vault after character creation for the servers to register/save that character.
---
Lol if Ark runs fine for you, you are literally the ONLY person that has experienced it.
---
All you have to do is YouTube "Meshing" to figure out all you need to know about Ark.
---
People have a pretty good reason to complain right now.
---
I can confirm that you do. They even say so in their FAQ section. But you need to claim it before the sub expires.
---
Oh i understand
---
Why does this thread exist? Like seriously, what on earth was the point of this nonsense?
---
You cared enough to make a post about it so looks like you proved yourself wrong. 
---
You know its just as shitty trying to antagonize people and put them down to make yourself feel cool
---
If you don't like them, just downvote them and let it sort itself out. But I agree that these posts are useless to the community.
---
&lt;3 Oh, thanks &lt;3
---
Literally the reason I bought it. I have a lot of RL friends that bought it solely for that reason as well.
---
I can play XB at work (I have an XB in my office). But rather discreetly. I can’t use mic unless I’m at home.
---
Lol Bethesda will fix exploits as soon as possible big leave bugs alone forever if they don’t give an advantage to the player
---
I definitely agree. The argument that, because Bethesda won’t actually enact change, expressing constructive opinions is useless has always seemed like a weak one.
---
Always speak up!
---
That's fine! An xbox at work in your office? You sound very important if you're able to do that haha
---
Yup
---
No, it will make it easier. Fallout first will give beth more cash to make the game better.  
---
Elder Scrolls Online had the same problem. Buggy launch with little content and bad endgame progression. People cried about it's membership program ESO+ being pay to win. That was 5 years ago, today ESO is considered one of the best MMOs ever built.  
---
In 5 years people will say the same about 76.
---
When I heard private server I thought it would have admin control be able to decide spawn rates, xp, legendary chance etc.
---
I don't think anyone is happy with it's implementation.
---
How is it disingenuous for someone to post a positive in-game experience regardless of the glitches/maintenance issues/monetization crisis? They are not always correlated. I am as frustrated as anyone on these issues but I still get feel good moments when I play if someone helps me out/I help them out, or if someone does something funny that makes me laugh out loud. It is the people who the play the game that keep me playing, not the content or updates. I think it is great that people still have great interactions with other players and are willing to share it here to make others smile!
---
I think it is!
---
Yes, and it's glorious.
---
Unless you are comparing it to a heavily modded fallout 4, outer worlds has superior graphics to every fallout game currently
---
I’m not not playing this game as a “Fallout fanboy” I have dabbled in previous games but not completed one.
---
I was hugely into Ark but my new job made it hard to play, I seen my son (Huge fallout fan) playing 76 and I thought that might fill my void...It kinda has.
---
So I’d say Ark is worth a shout.
---
Wow read that again... That is not pay2win...
---
Pay2win is an item/service/boost that gives you an advantage over another person who doesn't pay... Buying cash is a convience MTX no 2 ways about it... 
---
Scrap kits, Repair kits, fridges and collector bots are pay2win as they give you an advantage over others who do not pay for them as thats the only way to get them.
---
probably had a scrapbox or the Ranger armor.
---
Man I did not know that it is carrying over to the public servers, that's really disappointing.. oh I play outer world's it's great!  I hope the wastelanders will be good and that's the game is going to be better
---
what if you don't have a gf but you have a bf? is Todd bisexual
---
Good thing I never interact with real people much less grills. Checkmate athiests 💁
---
I have a character that in 1 week I farmed 40k in steel, it is possible for melee players with ease, scrapping assault rifles alone you get from super mutants can get you in thousands in just an hour.
---
I’ve been down coated so much on this sub it’s nuts.  It’s okay, I still enjoy the the community and love everyone in it.  It’s just sad because you can’t have a civilized discussion without some jumping in and giving you validated reasons in their own mind on why you’re wrong.
---
Trolling
---
Yeah I would say their biggest issue is not helping out the other factions.
---
Scandals and criticisms, there you have it. If you block out the bullshit and just play the game, it’s very enjoyable. Why do I need youtubers and social media influencers to tell me what I like?
---
Now that’s what I call *edgy*
---
For people who still make these stupid posts. Why?  Everyone's already said everything negative that you can say.  No one thinks you're cutting edge since you're basically repeating yourselves.  How come the thousands of posts haven't deterred you from making yet another?
---
 I am genuinely curious.
---
A game about bringing people together is going to separate them again. XD
---
Sounds reasonable. But what if instead, I wanted to pay ~$8 a month for $15 worth of Atoms, and coincidentally also got infinite scrap space, my favorite outfit in all of Fallout history, a second fast travel location, and servers that I could just play with my friends and didn’t have to deal with level 30’s tagging the Scorchbeast queen only to contribute nothing to her scaling difficulty?
---
EDIT: Since I’m top comment let me use this spot for good. 
---
This is a very heavy handed sarcasm guys. Lol look at the chain below this. He’s being satirical because this is literally what the real trolls have been doing.
---
So, what's the player count now..10..15 thousand on PS4?
---
No. Lol explosive is terrible on teslas. The main reason they are good in PvP is the arcs that let you bounce shots off the ground and kill people without having any aiming or vats
---
I did and had to delete my post because everyone was shitting on it so hard.  I don’t mind disagreements but when you’re being called an idiot with no valid reasoning it’s a bit much.
---
For sentinel it’s all pieces works or none of them. DR will always be diminishing return but it depends on enemy dmg per hit, for hard hitting enemies you will see clear difference when increasing dr even for something like 600
---
Actually, it's you who are jumping to conclusions and assuming things about people. But this is nothing new, I've seen this tired old argument so many times. The argument goes: they haven't played the game (or haven't played it long enough) so therefor they don't know anything about it. Everything they have to say about the game can safely be discarded - because they didn't play it.
---
This is such a dumb argument and way of thinking. Just look at what happened to Anita Sarkeesian when she said she wasn't a gamer. Everytime she appeared somewhere people were quick to point out "she's not a real gamer". In other words - anything she says can be discarded.
---
It's dumb. Stop doing it. Most people are individuals who are capable of thinking with their own brain. And Fallout 76 was such a huge disaster when it was released, so pretty much every person with a remote interest in video games know about its problems or have heard about them. It's so well-known that people don't even NEED to play the game or see for themselves to know or form an opinion.
---
The people you say were jumping on the bandwagon were most likely fans of Fallout who were disappointed, and they were expressing their disappointment. Sure, they were probably only repeating what everyone else was saying - but that's because IT WAS THE TRUTH. The release of this game was a **disaster**, and that is an objective fact. You may *personally* like the game and may even have had tons of fun with it, but its release was still a disaster and will go down in video game history as one of the worst launches ever.
---
It's $13 for $16 worth of Atoms and an outfit I wanted since launch.
---
Where is this $100 rumor coming from?
---
Nah, just my employer trusts me too much. ;)
---
So can anyone so that gives literally no one an advantage in that situation or did you buy the ability to farm static spots too? Is that a fallout fuckyou first feature?
---
No. Dont. Overpay for the atoms and make a stand. A lot is riding on your decision. There arent bigger issues that could use peoples energy. This is the one
---
Probably not.
---
I could make a long post but I won't so I'll keep it simple. I play it for the same reasons people play fortnite. I just like to play it.
---
Never that
---
Good thing i don't have a gf, checkmate Todd
---
I meant auto quad Tesla’s in general
---
Yep, I hope so too. I'll throw them money here and there if they put it back into the game and give me things I want.
---
Yep if anything it just shows how much the damn lag degrades the 76 experience, having smooth npc warfare with legendary beasts strolling in is just crazy.
---
Mom or sister? The man has no boundaries.
---
Your trolling😂
---
I work in retail, I could never get away with that haha lucky punk lmao.
---
I imagine that as having a little companion who decorates around camp while your out adventuring
---
What are you babbleing about? Its a game I rather like and play almost every day. As I build my machines to play games, the last one took almost 6 months to save up parts for as I'm very poor, they do so quite well. A 32" 4k monitor that never falls below about 55 FPS is very sweet and the game looks very fine.
---
 Anyone who takes Reddit seriously is an idiot. Do you even play this game?
---
I have been playing other games the past week. I did come back a few weeks ago and was playing again, because I like my farm and my character and the stuff I collected. I was doing dailies for possum badges to upgrade my new backpack. But now I have once again lost the will to play it and am just about ready to move on from here again also.
---
So you are complaining that you lost and you went after them and you didn't see the opening in the tent o shot them?  I mean it is a pretty big opening and yeah you can kill someone in it.   
---
You story sounds kind of fishy, also they took revenge is my guess and maybe turned passive on.
---
I knew my post would trigger someone.
---
Fair enough. But still, if you dont want activision to charge you a nickel every time you look at your playstation then you know what needs to be done.
---
As stated, it was like this and then they changed it. "Realistic" lighting has always been a mod for a reason. Most people do not care about realism as much as others. 
---
I would very much like the old lighting back, but for some I could see this just being bothersome more so than a benefit. I would say just mod in an ENB but this is not possible at this time from what I have found. Good thing new RPGs are coming out to replace this money pit! Think positively!
---
He can have her. She’s a whore.
---
Hell no the coop element is crucial, it's just that damn mule assholes, turret base spammers and in general computationally inefficient "users" are fucking it all up.
---
Load into a public world with "normal" people and the experience is just as good, load into a world with a shitload of lvl 150+ ppl who obviously have their stashes loaded up the ass with contrived items / stress the hell out of the servers with their duped/exploited weaponry and it all goes to hell.
---
I should have the outer worlds beat by then so I’ll be back
---
You can't really have a non-fragmented community when your servers only hold 24 people tops.
---
Bait people in to what exactly? There may still be people who don’t want info on vault raids. Honestly half the topics in this sub should have spoiler tags by any other gaming sub’s standards
---
I like the idea of getting foggy vision!
---
They say Appalachia wasn't hit by nukes (until we came along and threw them around like footballs) so it would somewhat make sense that the outer regions are more rad intense. Harper's Ferry for example is about an hour's drive from Fallout 3s wasteland, DC.
---
Still I agree a big square of none rads is probably just as immersion breaking.
---
Im just a man who sees the gravity of the situation at hand.
---
Trigger? Lol.
---
 I make fun of anybody who uses the term privilege.
---
Fortnite isnt bad though
---
No they didn't it's terrible
---
The point of having it early is so that younger people or parents who play it can still get event items without missing trick or treating
---
After your subscription stops does anyone know if you will still have access to the tent? Or can you only place it while you have an active subscription?
---
This made me laugh pretty hard lol 
---
Change that probably to a definitely.
---
I'm really not certain how this is a useful comparison in any way.
---
Differences in compatible purchasing power, to the extent that they can be, are baked-in to the foreign exchange rate. (They aren't the sole factor, of course).
---
I'm not sure what you expect from a foreign vendor in this respect. If they've decided that they want to receive $X.XX per SKU in their local currency, and operating in a foreign market means they are receiving a foreign currency, and also paying a tariff or tax that does not have a direct equivalent in their local market, the sensible thing to do is to adjust pricing on a per-market basis to compensate for these factors.
---
That said, it's a perfectly good argument that videogames in general are overpriced, but a comparison of the relative value of a product in two markets starts with a comparison after the adjustments in foreign exchange rates and local taxes and tariffs, not before it.
---
In fact, any comparison you'd make about purchasing power would vary radically depending on what category or products you chose for comparison. The purchasing power of USD, for instance, would me much lower than the currency of many other civilized nation if looking at prescription drug prices.
---
So $1 NZD buys way more insulin than $1USD, and the reverse could be true for other kinds of goods.
---
Again, for the company based in the US pricing a product and receiving foreign currency on a per unit basis, I don't know what's reasonable to expect.
---
I don't think there's any valid comparison that justifies the OP's claim that this game either costs almost twice as much, or is somehow worth less than half, based on the prices as stated. Do you?
---
Happens on PC randomly, and at this point my subscribed account hasn't been able to initiate or accept trades since I started the subscription a couple days ago.
---
He will be purely to hurt you.
---
Then gtfo you stupid troll, wtf are you doing wasting our time with your irrelevant opinion?
---
damn i bought it yesterday... Oh hold on someone is knocking at my door
---
Damn, alright then probably won't buy it. Thanks for replying.
---
Iv had all my plans on my vendor for between 5-10 caps, except for decontamination shower which is 100 and excessive adhesive for 3 caps pretty much since we got vendors and iv not sold anything at all so far
---
I think it’s time for you to let go and move on.
---
Reading all of the ignorance in the comments scares me for the future
---
Maybe lose some weight first bruh
---
Yes all of them, if you talk about game it’s a spoiler, notify moderators to update all the flairs.
---
What does that mean it shouldn’t matter how I spend my money it’s mine I earned it Everyone complaining about fall first or just entitled and thinking they should get it off for free
---
Spending 2 hours in the character creator in the Vault is impressive. You can change your character at anytime from in game. It's not permanent.
---
Almost 100% of the male NPC’s are buffoons or evil, while the women are the strong, Mary Sue,  types.  You can put beards on the women characters (I assume the creators would tell you men can have periods too).  And there are plenty of other things that I noticed during the game dialogue.
---
Well, thanks to you all gaming consoles are just paperweights with fans in then
---
1  I paid for all individual dlc from fallout 4. That was expensive considering all the free things I’ve gotten in 76. I’ve got more than my money’s worth so far. I’m glad Bethesda has delayed wastelanders to make it as good as possible. And you never know what more w can get before that comes out
---
Ofcourse you do. I am not at all surprised.
---
I enjoy playing the game, and if I let the actions of corporations and companies dictate where I spent my money, then I wouldn't be able to spend my money on anything.
---
The state its in now fallout 1st subscription doesn't seem worth it to me at all. Would male sense if you could mod it or at least change settings for the server. I agree with all of tnis though
---
Also the smooth as hell npc encounters, it's a completely different difficulty when the ai doesn't freeze up trying to aim at you, but instead actively starts to hunt you down and have no issues unloading on your ass.
---
I can’t believe they didn’t patch the unlimited meat cleaver glitch. UNLIMITED STEEL = UNLIMITED AMMO
---
Absolutely support this. Character transferring is what ruins everything.
---
Iv got all my plans for 5-10 caps except decontamination shower which is 100 caps, also excessive adhesive of 3 caps, iv not sold anything since we got vendors
---
https://youtu.be/moWe3rk7LzQ
---
 This is what I think of whenever I hear some douchebag use it
---
I'm not entirely sure. I'd assume you don't keep the tent because it wasnt unlocked from the atom shop like the skins, scrap box, and emotes. But I'm not clear on the subject.
---
And that is a totally reasonable standpoint but this isnt a time for reason. We are in mob mode bro. Mob mode.
---
I was very antisocial when I first started playing. I would run away from EVERYBODY! I longed for a single player version of 76. But then someone asked me for help. ME? Someone asked ME for help?
---
After that experience I started to open up a bit more as the social interaction increased. That in turn opened me up more to real life social interaction. And just like in the game, I ran into a few ass clowns but never let them get me down.
---
So no, what you are describing isn’t weird or unusual. Enjoy the feeling. Soon enough you will start seeing the same people playing and may be even get them on your friends list. Just remember as you increase in level the woman’s words are true. People will run away from higher level players. Just be kind and pass the good things along. Pay them forward. You never know when in the future you’ll run into the old you. You could make someone’s day the same way she did...with a friendly wave and a few kind words.
---
Ok. I don't have time to watch video links but feel free to describe it to me.
---
&gt;If the cluster hickups, everyone's performance suffers.
---
This is why why we wanted to be able to host a server on our own local hardware or rented servers, like Minecraft, Ark, etc.
---
Well most people dont quit the game before finishing the tutorial
---
Tent goes away. You keep the atoms you had and the outfit. You keep the scrapbox but can only remove things and not add anymore
---
So I guess being a contrary fuck is a better alternative to baiting people to read my post because of the spoiler warning. Which by the way would discourage people from reading it to avoid spoilers. Not sure what logic that is.
---
A bunch of D bags being D bags at a D bag meeting
---
I like it. That’s why. I don’t let YouTube or Reddit our Twitter tell me what to think. 
---
I bought the subscription for 1st s as well, and I love it!
---
I added you! I'll send you a message so you know who I am
---
Battle of Blair Mountain 2: Nuclear Boogaloo
---
&gt; no one really cares what you think
---
oh the irony
---
I agree with the private server thing, what is the point if you cant change anything
---
Your doing a good deed in the long run
---
agree on this, maybe camp budget expansion too
---
I hope this is sarcastic, because this reads as if you actually support it. 
---
In reality, people may just ignore other posts until the issue is talked to death.
---
It literally makes zero sense to downvote other criticisms of the game if your not a fan of 1st.
---
Stop karma whoring.
---
That's the best!! I play 76 on my Xbox1, and I have my 360 next to it for my kids. They have both started (5-6yrs old) characters in fallout 3 and play along side me! My 6 year old has aced 97% of all her advanced reading-deciphering nonsensical words and speaking them correctly- I swear fallout 3 has made the difference. I make both my girls read all of the dialog, every option, and to decide together what choices are good, evil, or clever, and I swear it has helped them SOOOOO much! Learning new words, addressing conflict and concerns in the game, even challenging what little base of right and wrong action they have learned so far. Being a father and watching them try to keep good karma, making sure they read every dialog and not make mistakes... lol... it's so exciting! That's why I love these games:)
---
Yup... and with the infrastructure as they have set it up they are not going to be able to.. easily..
---
Yes i find it incredibly annoying also, i commiserate with your pain. For me it doesn't seem to affect my teammate but i will regularly freeze at least once every couple of days from it.  
---
I have had it happen less regularly if i do the following things:
---
\- Have purified water on my wheel, so i can hotkey drink some without going into Aid. Doesn't help much if you like a lot of different types of beverage though
---
\- I never drink if my meter generates the error and i get the AP hit. If i drink when i get the message i seem to have a 50% change to freeze. I'll wait until i can fast travel back to my camp or its a decent period after i've picked up anything \[in case of rollback\] and then i'll drink.
---
This is true. My friend really wanted me to wait for him and not progress without him so I thought I’d just make my character before we leave the vault together.
---
You tell me i see you tried both, I have no more comments.
---
You’re letting an 8 year old be around an M-rated game with swearing, alcohol and gore, as well as in game purchases with real money, and you think Bethesda is the problem in this situation?
---
&gt;Why? 
---
Because it brings me pleasure.
---
&gt;What drives you? 
---
I love the game, but at the moment it's mostly force of habit that keeps me signing in every day.  Hoping that Wastelanders is an enormous update that'll be worth the wait.  I *could* start on one of the other 2 or 3 dozen games that I own but have never touched, yet...I don't feel like it.  The game is comfortable for me at this point.  It's part of my "wind down from the day" routine.
---
&gt;Why are you still interested? 
---
I'm interested in anything that I enjoy.
---
&gt;Why haven't the thousands of scandals and criticisms been enough to scare you off? 
---
Because I'm an adult who makes my own decisions.  The complaints about bugs/glitches/crashes/disconnects don't stop me from playing because I do not experience them.  I'm not going to say "never" but it doesn't happen to me every day.  Most of my play time is without a hitch.  The 'scandals' have been mostly overly dramatic bullshit.  While I don't think Bethesda has been perfect here (the canvas bags debacle was the worst thing since launch IMO), I also don't think they're the devil for wanting to make the game profitable.
---
&gt;Do you use the Atomic Shop?
---
I do, but I've never bought a pack of atoms just to have atoms.  You can grind for plenty if you can control yourself and keep from purchasing everything they add the moment they add it.  I wait for sales, only buy stuff that I really like, and earn a little bit of atoms every day.  I'm Level 248 right now, so I have earned a lot in that time even when not really trying to.
---
Lol dude you have to add /s to the end of your comments. People aren’t picking up on the heavy handed sarcasm like I did. 😂
---
I'm honestly having a struggle finding them too. I check almost constantly all over that specific area and not once day or night have I found any
---
You realise this was released as a full priced game yeah? 
---
That would be like me selling a game for $60 then when you boot it up it's just a black screen, only for me to then say "Well duh, games cost money to develop, if you just pay $100 more we may or may not make the actual game you paid for. Thanks."
---
It's such stupid logic. You honestly think Bethesda is so strapped for cash that they need to scam their most loyal customers to even finish a game? Dude they are a multi million dollar company. You're subscription fees are paying for Todds handjobs, not FO76 development. The fact people like yourself (and others in this thread) fall for it has actually opened my eyes. It doesn't matter to them if the community as a whole knows its a scam, because the 1-5% of people that do pay is enough for them to make bank. Sad times.
---
I Pay 15€ for Fallout first, get a refoundrefund of 15€ from Microsoft for the mess and I win Fallout first 4 free
---
Listen I don’t really agree with the whole idea of spend money get digital money back but I really enjoyed having my own server to farm and farm and farm but I can see why people don’t agree with the whole money thing involved😁👍
---
well... last question: how to buy fallout first for the lowest price as possible, also, hiding this from your wife?
---
Are you taking tax into consideration?
---
I assume it's the video from the democratic socialist convention.
---
Hmmm most of bias is not directed to game but the devs and their buisness plan based on treating players as lab rats they start with increasing atom shop prices to know how much money they could get from us now this new paid membership with insane high monthly fee, if they were smart they would wait for wastelanders update with this but they go full cash grab.
---
I know servers cost money but come on with that price i can easly rent own cloud server and host 5 minecraft servers and trust me minecraft is really resource hungry ...
---
I will repeat again like i said shortly after release players like to be rewarded not punished on every aspect of game they had improved past 50 expierence but still this mebership lack of more exlusiveness, creating own sessions is cool but not in a way is it now. 
---
Imagine creating own NAMED sessions you can browse in some kind of server browser, as owner you could set up own missions or events making your experience a little more better and put own creativity into wastelands etc
---
And people are threatening to rape me :(
---
I was able to solo the queen last night on my private server. Almost no lag whatsoever and the queen was focused on my the whole fight, made it easier to focus myself on her lol
---
Excellent counterpoint, I really do feel like getting 1st is supporting the game so I'm glad we get a few perks for that
---
Cant you see whats at stake?
---
I believe they said when the subscription ends the tent goes away but the scrap box stays and becomes 'withdrawal only' the stuff you put in it will stay in it until it's used building things or the player withdraws everything, until it's empty. at that point I don't know if it will magically disappear from your camp or it'll just be a decorative item.
---
That’s a legendary trait, not a mod
---
This an age 18 plus game is it not?
---
So ya i see a problem with that.
---
But i guess your blinded and don't see it.
---
When my nephews asked me for a gift card for Fortnite I gave them a code for the co-op version of the game, Save the World, and told them they can earn V-Bucks in that without spending money. But they wanted some skin that was limited time and not going to be available. I wanted to teach them the lesson to make the V-Bucks in Save the World, but I ended up also giving them a gift card and telling them I would do it once but not again, and to check out videos on YouTube how to make the V-Bucks through playing the game. It's a horrible position they put people in. You made the right choice.
---
So I described it fairly well.
---
You don’t have to make a comment about not having a comment. You could scroll along and allow people to read about a technical issue if they choose to or not and refrain from downvoting it for no reason when it’s a legitimate problem. I’m not sure what you think I have to gain from posting about an in game experience is in the first place. I’m not advertising anything.
---
My understanding (though I don't think anyone has actually tested it yet...including BGS...) is that you lose the ability to place the stash and the tent when you are no longer subscribed.
---
I suspect that at least the stash will remain in your camp, until you need to move the camp, though I do wonder if you blueprint it, would you still be able to place it?  No way to know for sure yet.
---
The tent...probably will stay where you last put it after your subscription ends...maybe?  But you wouldn't be able to move it or place it again.  It's possible that the tent, and maybe (but less surely) the stash would disappear as soon as your sub ends, but I have doubts about that.  Maybe you'd be unable to teleport there, or not for free, even if the tent stays.
---
He has 200 hours whats meant he already got more then 60$ can get you on average.
---
Oh good, I'm glad you're enjoying it, I am really looking forward to playing it and experiencing something new. I am definitely going to keep an eye on what is happening with Fallout though, as I've enjoyed my many months playing it and I really like the people in the community. I intend to try the Mischief Night event before leaving for Outer Worlds, as Halloween is my favourite time of year, so I might see you there if I am not too overencumbered to travel! :-)
---
That’s very commendable. I usually set the price a tenth of the default price. Try setting up the camp near whitesprings, that worked for me.
---
You just made me snort my lunch!
---
100%. I would have liked it if they launched the service with completely customizable servers. My girl friend and I play consistently and we want to play on a persistent private server since the whole mantra of the game is "Rebuild America". Why would I want to pay for a server that i can't come back to and pick up where I left off? At the very least we need that ASAP
---
Explosives ruin it. A quad 1* is better than a qe for pvp. Only thing a qe is good for is as a trade/ legacy collectible tbh
---
Uh no?
---
True, but how many times do I have to say it.. these aren't private servers, they are private play sessions, you have ZERO control of them. Not many people should expect to have a private server for free, but no one should expect to pay to play alone in a MULTIPLAYER game.  BTW, I'm starting to be a fan of you OoM
---
Wieghtless is a legendary effect, no plan.
---
Ummmmmmmmmmmmm
---
r/antibigconsolesmasterplan
---
Gosh, it's almost like an 8-year-old shouldn't be playing a Mature-rated game.
---
Well they def shouldnt do that
---
While I am fully for boycotting the game, if you were already doing a dumb thing wasting money I see no fault in giving them less and getting more from it. No reason to annihilate, you're making a point that works for you and don't try to put bethesda on a pedestal even though they fucked players over big time.
---
You can buy them in the Bunker at WhiteSprings, but they cost about 17k -20k depending on your perks.
---
Damn, oh well, thank you anyway. Fingers crossed it doesn't do this again xD
---
Kids are kids, no? They'll want anything.  Fortnite,  shit ton of candy they dont need,  etc. Not the best example to go off. Note that he still wants it after all the youtubers are negating it. 
---
Be happy the kid knows what he wants regardless of what others tell him. Then again watch out for the same reason.
---
Your not wrong
---
Yes, I do (experience taught me it's necessary in case you run out of RAM, else bad things happen). I used to have it on a separate SSD, but moved it to my system drive while troubleshooting this.
---
Seems an unlikely culprit anyway, since it's some sort of graphics issue.
---
So instead of thinking about your privilege, how it affects you and what you can do to improve yourself and become a better person in general, you decide to instead mock people who even utters the word because you once saw a funny YouTube video. Got it.
---
Its so heavy that Ill eat the downvotes with my head up
---
I've seen a few and I'm completely shocked. Sucker born every minute I guess.
---
It's part of the urban dictionary like most slang words
---
That is what I figured.
---
I would pay 1k atoms to reset my perk points.
---
Not a fan of the subscription service but:
---
1. It's their money
---
2. A majority of players do not follow the sub-reddit or read any news articles, they are just playing the game. This post cannot change this fact.
---
3. If you are harassing people in-game and on the Reddit because they bought Fallout 1st then the problem is you not them. You aren't going to convince thousands of casual and likely satisfied people to boycott a subscription in the hopes that you will get it for free.
---
Because I enjoy the universe....because i enjoy playing the game and there is still a lot to explore....because i don't care about canvas bags and rum issues....the criticisms are from a loud minority ( just about every camp i see has the fridge/scrapbot/and the new scapbox that "everyone" said they are not buying) I'm not saying the game is bug free (it is Bugthesda) but I don't have any bugs that stop me from gaming (i have maybe crashed 10-ish times since i got the same soon after launch)...I do use the atomic shop because they have items i want for my character so i either earn the atoms in game or purchase some...I don't play all the time but when i do i see full worlds and plenty of people playing that just want to have fun and don't care about what kids are yelling about
---
But how? In what specific way, is the current game everyone was satisfied with just having Wastelanders added to, suddenly “fucked” by adding a new game mode. 
---
First does nothing different than adding Survival mode (albeit temporarily) or Nuclear Winter to the game. What about the current game has degraded with this new game mode. Genuinely asking.
---
Only 600? casual
---
bro play some multiplayer games and use disc if you want to have soscial interaction
---
Dont get me wrong there are a lot of nice encounters I've had most of my friends are from the  community actually but majority of the time it's always negative
---
Oh, thank God.  I'm marrying her next year, and the cost is skyrocketing every time we talk about it.

Scratch offs are random chances. This is a sub telling you exactly what you'll get

Here’s a couple upvotes to offset it at least 😂

If you’re on PC there’s a DPS mod that shows you yours and your team DPS. What weapon and what perks?

Add VE harpoon to the "yes" list, especially with flechettes.  :)
---
I jumped servers about 5 times and found them during daytime. Be sure to check all the pods next to Dyer Chemicals on the Organic Solution quest marker, some of them might not appear as Stranger Blooms and just Pods.
---

PC. Gotta have my loadout mod haha
---
The scrap box can be considered pvp pay-to-win because you don't have to worry about anyone looting scrap off your dead body and can have nearly infinite scrap to repair and craft with.
---
What's the count of your friends list? Also, Check them all, confirm they have either owned or played the game at a given time. Show your data or your truth is in question.
---
Because its not a server it's just a play session. Huge rip off
---
Mine is on push to talk but it is on at all times.

Why don't you go ahead and teach your kid he can't have everything instead of bitching online? Oh, wait... You don't seem to understand that concept yourself.
---
1 - no.  Breaks the whole idea, I can't see that being workable.  A separate character just for private servers, that can't exist in public would be very niche and not at all what (I think) the intent of the system is now.
---
1a-4 - dead on, exactly what I think.  I'm all for adding more to the sub in addition to the private games (icons, outfits, atoms, skins), but nothing that changes gameplay.  No extra experience, no extra camp/stash limits, just cosmetics like we were promised.
---
I know some people will be opposed to exclusive outfits and such.  I don't discount that opinion, I know a lot of people are completionists, I'm just not one of them. I don't even mind the private games really, though once modding becomes a real thing, I think we may need to revisit that a bit.
---
Not once did I mention MMORPG, that statement is on you alone.
---
Subscription, Battle pass, Microtransaction, Seasonal pass, even DLC, they're all excuses to get the consumer to spend more money.
---
If you only sub for a month, do you get to keep the scrapbox and the tent after the sub ends?
---
Let us know how fun it is a couple months..... When you have 90000 screws you'll never use
---
This is something that i wanted to bring up kinda, to me 1st is no way p2w, its more like pay to grind because there is no actual benefit to you in gameplay. If you could outright buy scrap that would be pay to win but storing scrap requires you to actually farm for scrap anyway.
---
The tent IIRC only has a cooking station and no other crafting benches so the convenience is somewhat limited IMO and one extra free fast travel is hardly a game changer.
---
Don’t get me wrong i’m not defending but rather pointing out these paid for perks are pretty useless, private servers are the only thing that might be useful, but certainly not P2W only perk is no ash/goo piles taking up your chances for loot but again it just means you can grind more and offers no advantage if you don’t put the time in
---
Dataminers said the scaling thing doesn't exist. It's a myth made up by players.
---
Reading is hard and being angry is fun.
---
And while that is a good burn and in large very accurate Todd still intended to do it.
---
I enjoy it. I like the gameplay loop of explore, loot, upgrade your stuff and so on. The endgame can get a bit boring if you aren't launching nukes all the time or doing some of the high level events or the vault raid but I genuinely enjoy the gameplay. It would be better if many of the bugs weren't there but it is what it is. I enjoy fallout so I play fallout.
---
Apparently you didn't notice that they lied (multiple times) and that people aren't "satisfied" with the game. 
---
It's buggy and not a real fallout. They wanted to add wastlanders after massive backlash over them missing from the game. And they said that there will be no paid content or pay to win elements and from what I've heard they're adding an infinite scrapbox so you can store everything you get, witch others who can't pay can't and apparently the atom shop gets items that help you in game too.
---
I wasn't about to down vote, but it looks like you are exactly the person I described in my comment.
---
Pretty much.
---
I just look at the benefits of Fallout 1st from the Atom standpoint and my own buying history with those.  For that reason alone, it makes sense.  The rest is just kind of a bonus.  I wouldn't be annoyed if they made the Scrapbox or the TENT available to everyone, but at the same time, this whole "burn it down" mentality is disgusting and I'm not going to shed any tears if Bethesda doesn't cave.
---
I play on Digital copy and it’s way better . Also I noticed that going from 400+ friends to 50 reduced the lag and freezing almost completely
---
Nice , I play with nt nephews (7,8) I try and teach them the ropes
---
I don't normally agree with raiders but you tell no lies
---
on PC you can change the color in a .ini file, don;t think there is any way for consoles.
---
1.) I don't think the restrictions of characters to adventure or private would work, since not all the players on the private server have to be 1st subscribers.  Non-subscribers can benefit from the resources if they just make friends with people who are subscribers.
---
It also would create a situation where if a non-subscriber had gone to a private server, they'd never be able to come back.  It would also create a scenario where people who cancel their subscription would never be able to play.
---
So I don't think we can do that, though I agree mods (depending on what we're even allowed) makes things confusing.
---
2.) I also feel that, unless there is a legit reason why it can't be given to everyone, that it should be for everyone.
---
3.) I also agree with the tent, especially that it should not be indestructible, Now maybe if they can't give everyone the scrap box, it would simply be the tent without it - maybe that could even be the premium feature, you get a tent with the scrapbox, everyone else just gets the stashbox.  Maybe they put it at the end of some scout quest line to continue that after you earn some more badges.
---
4.) Skins could be nice, I don't think there's a problem with "perks" of some sort.  They could put a scrap box at every Rail Road station that non-subscribers could use (along with ones they could build a their Camp or workshops) but the subscribers are the only ones who get a tent with both.  It's an advantage, but very very minor in comparison.  Or they could make first literally just a  "You get to play with this for 30 days early then it all goes to everyone".  It's a time based exclusive - but in the end everyone gets it.
---
Surprisingly outer world's turned out to be great! I thought it won't be this good and that I won't like it, but it is awesome and I like it. It's definitely a different experience. But I have to play on easy not normal because it's to hard at the beginning for me haha. And the choices you have to meet right after beginning. A lot like new Vegas, and character creation and perk/stats system is like exactly the same. I played this event, just the end of it but it was fun, a lot of people in one location! Definitely have to try and find it again. I love this time of year too! Are you playing on Xbox ? :)
---
The subscription is pretty much identical to the one they do in ESO but with the addition of the private servers. ESO subscription also allows you to have unlimited crafting items but in it's case you don't have to travel back to a camp you deposit them they are just automatically deposited as you harvest or scrap items. I believe they offer multiple things to try an appeal to as many people as possible. For myself, coming from ESO to fo76 The scrap box and the discounted Atoms are pretty much the only reasons I got the subscription.  The tent is a cool addition because it allows me to build  a nice camp without having to constantly move it. I don't do the suspended single block foundation camp, mine is actually a bunch of ground-level buildings set in a circle kind of like a wagon train which makes it kind of a pain in the ass to move. I do think the tenth as a pioneer scout quest would be cool though, I would be good with that. As far as the private servers go IDGAF about them and will probably never use mine. So to sum it all up without the scrap box I never would have bought the subscription. I did decide to go on the month the month instead of buying a year though because I can't guarantee I will still be playing in a year. Just like fo76 stole me away from ESO, another game could potentially steal me away from fo76 and I would feel bad if I still had 5 months of a subscription left that I paid for and had no intention on using. (although I am enjoying fo76 a lot at this point and I can't really see anything other than Elder Scrolls 6 or Fallout 5 stealing me away, and who knows when those will happen)
---
I’ll keep you updated working on 10,000 right now 😂👍😉

Agreed my friend. I'd love an actual server that I could have to myself and be able to fully customize.
---
Sadly thats what it has come down too.
---
He should be spending it on cannabis oils and gambling like his father, right?
---
No I only "gotta" address the myth that people spread because that is how far I could be bothered reading and needs to be corrected.
---
I do not understand how some people don't see massive time savers as P2W. The scrapbox is probably the biggest P2W feature you could add to the PvE portion of this game, not to mention that you will never have to defend yourself on a private server. Pay for convenience IS P2W. Time is money.
---
Ultra-light build plans is best you can get weight wise but only armor marked weightless (legendary) will work with chameleon mutation.
---
To be perfectly honest, I dislike anything in a video game that makes me think about real world money, pay to win or not.  Like most of you, I play video games to escape the worries of the real world and immerse myself in a world vastly different from our own.  Every time I see something that reminds me of real world money and forces me to grapple with my emotions on whether or not I want it and can afford it, I get a bit dismayed.  I still play games with microtransactions because at this point you can't really avoid them, but every time I see them I feel like a little bit of the soul has been sucked out of the game.
---
The atom store is mostly tolerable because you can earn the items through in game actions if you see something you really want.  This is fine because it makes you play the game more and gives you a goal to engage with.  Hearing about Fallout First is more disheartening because it feels like some of that stuff should just be free.  I don't want to sit here and fight myself on whether I think its worth it to buy for the extra convenience.  I just want to enjoy playing the game and not think about things like that.  Also, as soon as I spend money on something like that, I now feel compelled to play to ensure I get my monies worth.  Nothing sucks the fun out of gaming more than feeling like you HAVE to do it.  I'd rather just avoid the decision altogether which means just playing something else.
---
Need some help lifting the sarcasm in this topic title?
---
Almost the same for me. 
---
I will say any pvp advantage that can’t be obtain in game, about getting power faster for me it depends if normal way of maxing is reasonable and you can pay to get it even faster I’m ok with that, if normal way to maxed character is insanely long (like some mobile games stretching it to a year of grind and then selling boosters) then it’s p2w for me.
---
Plus I will add PvE when it’s design to be almost impossible to beat quest or takes you weeks to farm fetch quests before you can progress then selling pve boosters is p2w for me.
---
That point I can truly understand. Less is never good.
---
And the fo76 community shoulda realized from the start that Bethesda doesn’t care about the game or the fan base beyond squeezing every dollar they can out of you but hey I get it.No one likes to admit that they can make massive mistakes.
---

---
I’ll take the downvote because these aspects you’re describing are nothing that I’d describe as “winning”. Scrap has never been a genuine issue for me if you play any time it’s easy to manage it. And I imagine people paying for first are playing their own servers since that is the only logical thing. I don’t see how someone else playing their own single player game affects players. Maybe I’m not seeing it.
---
Due to the fact, that the servers hosting just a session for 1-8 players works better, you are absolute right.
---
This would just cause more complaining from the people who are already upset about FO1st. A private session where you can force spawn whatever you want is already powerful enough.  Yes I own FO1st.
---
Cool in laws. Rare. Todd howard might move you up on the list

While I agree with you when I comes to supporting a game you enjoy but I think they made a huge marketing mistake by moving forward with fallout first while pushing back the release of wastelanders. I feel like had they been released together (assuming the launch was relatively bug free) the backlash against fallout first would have been alot less. As it stands it is basically asking people to voluntary pay for a subscription to the same game that they promised wouldn't have one. It does give you some interesting perks like the monthly atom that I have no problem with but the infinite junk limit is very pay to win (not sure how it even works with public worlds). So while voluntary idea is nice but it may get to the point where the perks it gives, especially if they add more items like the fridge or scrap collector to the store, will make it more of a necessity to enjoy the game. At least that is my fear.
---
I'm right there with ya mate. Although I want a customizable private server. That's what would make me actual think the subscription was worth it. I want to scale enemy levels, make it survival or not, lock the server down, etc. I wasnt aware that's what the subscription for ESO did though. I'm not terribly surprised though.
---
I think one issue is treating bethesda like they are some small indie dev, “keeping the lights on” doesn’t really apply to them, they’re just trying to squeeze out as much revenue as possible for the investors
---
And some of us who don't have it wouldn't mind a subscription if it was just $5 a month without anything padding it out like Atoms or exclusive cosmetics. Also to keep the private server running while our friends are on it.
---
I’m here to laugh at the giant fucking mess that is this game.  It’s entertaining.  More entertaining than actually playing the thing.

Stuff like the tent was supposed to be free. Stuff that put people on a higher playing field than other people was supposed to be free. Hines, fucking VP of Bethesda who should know WTF he's talking about, said the Atom Shop would be cosmetics only and still hasn't bothered to come out an apologize for that lie. The way they're going, I'll be honestly very impressed if Wastelanders stays free. It's not the first time they've gone back on their word. 
---
Maybe they will keep it free, but the way they've been lately, I can't really judge anyone for predicting Wastelanders to cost money or for them to expect weapons to end up in the Atom Shop soon. For all our sakes, I hope OPs predictions turn out to be false, but I won't be at all surprised if OP ends up being correct six months from now. 
---
Sad really. This isn't even Bethesda's fault that most of it is happening. It's Zenimax's fault, and yet most of the anger on this subreddit has been aimed at Bethesda while Zenimax continues on without so much as a scratch.
---
Ah, no, I'm on PS4 so I guess we won't be running into each other in Appalachia after all. :( I am excited to play a game with NPCs and consequences and an element of challenge, as I really have just been doing my own thing and creating my own amusement for months now in Fallout. It is the right time for a break, and to see what else is out there. Do you have any other recommendations?
---
I’m glad to see a positive opinion. This is how I feel about the situation as well. I’ll be subscribing to 1st. I thoroughly enjoy the game. And it will help me enjoy the game even more.
---
Weird and creepy comment
---
THIS is a civil discourse on the topic. Username checks out haha. I’ll 100% give you the credit that Wastelanders getting pushed back to announce First seems REALLY in poor taste haha. I will defend a lot of business decisions since I’ve seen the inside of how game studios operate which gives a ton of perspective to what things costs. The delay was rough to pair with First. I’m sure the finance department had their reasons but in a perfect world, things would have been much better off releasing alongside Wastelanders.
---
I like this community. A lot people who are here don't even play it but are first to hate on Bethesda for everything! It is childish behavior just like you said. The hate will go on with every new bug found, even though most of the bugs arent even bothering me, ( I never encountered any problems with the game to be honest)
---
So you can just leave a place fast travel away and then back and everything spawns again?
---
They did scare me off for the longest time. I'm not really a fan of MMOs because people suck and combine that with the bad reviews this game got at launch and I wasn't coming anywhere near it. When they had the free weekend a few months back I watched a couple trailers it looked cooler than I expected and ESO had taught me that having other people in the world isn't necessarily a bad thing (heroes have come out of the woodwork more than once to save my ass for picking on something I shouldn't, not to mention the in-game fo76 community is incredibly friendly) so I downloaded it during the free weekend gave it a shot and decided all the complainers were either full of shit (or most of the things they were crying about had been fixed between release and when I started it) and this game was a lot cooler than I expected. I bought it before the free weekend was up and have played daily ever since.
---
Not really since its just pointing out how what's acceptable keeps getting pushed. First repair kits were barely considered acceptable and now there are people trying to argue that $100 for unlimited scrap and private worlds is acceptable. Chances are that in 3-6 months Bethesda will start selling legendary gear and there will still people defending it.
---
Yeah ive had my plans up for a while and only just yesterday sold most of them... lol

The goal with Fallout First was to make money while giving as little value as possible.

I have absolutely no issue with you spending money on atoms (not that you should care what some internet stranger thinks).  You do you.
---
I do not support the use of atoms or real money for non-cosmetic items, and the 1st program supports that.  
---
So there's a bit of a quandary there.  But since it's giving you more atoms for your money than just buying the atoms outright, it makes financial sense for you to do it.  So it's up to you whether you want to take a stand against what *I* don't like, or do what makes financial sense to you.  No judgement, that's totally your call.
---
Also, if people give you grief in-game over this, report them to BGS.  Hopefully they get banned.  Also, put them on ignore.  Same goes here, report any harassment to the mods or the admin and hopefully they'll go away.
---
I already addressed the Freedom of Speech portion. Did you need it repeated to you again?
---
And if you think it’s not possible to coerce someone through passive aggressive means, you’re quite lucky. I’ve seen it multiple times, in both professional and personal environments. 
---
Passive aggression is usually intended to alter the other persons actions. It’s a form of persuasion, and since it uses subtle implied negative consequences, it’s a form of coercion. It may not quite fit the full legal definition, but it is the best word I can think of for the particular situation. And it has the added effect of causing a visceral reaction.
---
I think it should be an option that the sub owner can set.  I'd like to see a World Settings menu with options like that.
---
Enemy Scaling:
---
1. Game default
---
2. Scaled to owner
---
3. All high level
---
4. All low level
---
5. Completely random up to owner's level.
---
The random option would be kinda fun, especially if you had friends of varying levels on your World.  They might run into Level 250 *** Legendary Liberators right out of the vault, or a Level 1 SBQ.
---
So let me get this straight. You're shocked that people who play and love the game, bought a subscription to help and support said game?
---
 You know what shocks me? The people that don't understand that.  You know the ones that can't fathom that others can have a different opinion than themselves.
---
 The only sucker I see around here is you.
---
except any adult, much less any human, should be able to figure out that bit with a little common sense. while the esrb is a shithole, the ratings are there for a reason.  its on the parent to buy/not buy the child a M rated game, the parent should also put some research into what the item is at a MINIMUM.
---
&gt;MITM
---
Eh? How would they circumvent it? The point of encryption is to prevent MITM. It would be encrypted before transmission.
---
Ya, it removes the arcs and turns them into single explosive shots
---
&gt; “keeping the lights on” doesn’t really apply to them
---
A much more accurate phrase would be "justify keeping the lights on". Because once this game no longer makes enough to justify keeping the staff off of more lucrative projects it'll be shut down. In that sense someone paying money is keeping the lights on.
---
The problem is lack of reward in exploration. I explored every location and the issue is there's no incentive to invest time in any location. No chance of a unique item or really much meaningful lore. Probably not going to find a item that links to a interesting side quest. Definitely not finding anything other than junk that's identical to the junk you found in any previous location. After a while it's just more of the same and you enter knowing you'll find nothing new. So you just glance it over and sprint to the next.
---
Not what I meant or said. I was saying what the fanboys would call me for not being happy.
---
No you log out of the server then quickly log back in.  This works in public servers but you need a friend as an anchor to ensure you load back in to the same server.
---
I spend more than a couple of FO1st subs worth of money on my girlfriend so he would actually be saving me money.
---
Also curious to know the answer
---
Damn
---
That’s the case for any game in history, so your suggestion is to encourage companies to put up paywalls any chance they get in order to make as much as possible?
---
If you only subscribe for one month, do you get to keep the scrapbox and T.E.N.T. after the subscription ends?
---
.45 rifle? Lever action I’m assuming, if so, then yes you gotta do rifleman. Be wary on having so many perk points allocated to demo expert as well. The damage isn’t increased a whole lot, and you can use the points in other perks/perk cards.
---
The thing is though that the branch covering 76  was one of their smaller branches to begin with, and they still have to cover a lot of costs for making more content. Unlike other studios that start work on a new game after they’re done and as such get new funding from the publisher, 76 has to sustain itself on monetizing love content forever. They don’t get kickbacks from the Doom team lol.
---
&gt; if you were already doing a dumb thing wasting money
---
Anything you spend on a video game could very easily be considered wasted money.
---
I bet they will let you change it soon for money or as apart of the subscription
---
Ohhh I see so if you log right back in and don't wait a few mins it will be the exact same server?
---
Well there's two levels at play here.. They use HTTPS.. which can be decrypted (take any router with DPI and SSL interception).. the JWT token however is -not- encrypted. It's just header + payload + secret.. That secret is only there to validate that the payload wasn't edited during transit, but it's visible.   
---
Also that JWT token is sent from the client to the server as well multiple times (storefront requests).. bandwidth waster :)
---
So a small branch clearly doesn’t need as much money if we go by that logic, and what content exactly has been put up that’s major besides a BR and wild Appalachia? (Which was kind of short in itself)
---
do you play on PC? if so feel free to add me. my username is apeydoodles. I'll be glad to play with you!
---
Watch them add this for fallout 1st members
---
That’s subjective
---
This would only work if characters on those custom worlds weren't allowed on regular worlds.
---
Not a lot of what you have there is a huge problem, but if you create a world where high level drops, particularly legendary ones, are easier to come by, it wouldn't really be fair to everyone else.
---
Think of a custom world where all mobs are 3* legendaries.  Better yet, add the ability to remove certain legendary effects so that god-tier stuff dropped a lot more commonly.  It wouldn't be nice to take someone from that server and drop them onto a regular server.
---
None of that is currently possible of course, there are no controls that you can set for any of that, and it's hard to tell if that's ever going to be a thing.
---
Ultra light is a mod that cuts weight
---
The problem is they are making an attempt at getting their paid mods service that they tried to get us to go for just a couple of years ago, only now they are doing so in a more deceiving and underhanded manner.  Not that their word matters at this point, but there's been no promise that these mods won't be yet another additional cost for players, and paying any money towards their current item shop inventory is only encouraging them further.  I've wanted a co-op Fallout game since my first time playing a FO title, bought the game in the face of the controversy and rightful criticism of its release, pointed out the parts they got right, criticized what they didn't, and enjoy playing it now and then to this day.  All that said, I can't continue to defend the corporate practices Bethesda is staunchly throwing at us, when the base game needs as much work as it does.  I am going to do my part by not handing the company a penny of my money until the situation is made right, and that includes other games I was / am looking forward to playing one day.  Starfield may be a game changer for the industry whenever it releases, but right now Bethesda needs to focus on what they've released already before they lose any more of their once dedicated and loyal fan base.
---
I enjoy playing the game. That's all that needs to be said.
---
What if you could just keep buying the atoms and your own server, and enjoy the rest of that with everyone else?
---
&gt;numerous reasons
---
Names one, which is a subjective opinion at best, and then turns away a perfectly good compromise....
---
I don't understand you, sir.
---
This must also be what people are talking about farming fissure site prime for all those legendary scorchbeast constantly
---
I think The definition of P2W changes depending on the type of game, and/or depending on certain design aspects of the game.  
---
So to try and merge all the definitions into a onesizefitsall... 
---
I define Pay-To-Win literally - that beyond the original purchase price of the game, Pay-to-win means :
---
1. At one or more points in the game, the player will be required to obtain one or more items which can only be obtained by paying real world money. And
---
2. Without said item(s), it would be impossible for any player to complete one or more required games objectives, and 
---
3. without sucessfully completing an objective which requires the item, it would be impossible to either progress further into the game, or it would be impossible to successfully reach and complete the endgame.  and
---
4. if the required item(s) are also available in the "game world" drop/find rates were made so miniscule that it would be statistically or functionally impossible for any given player to obtain. That is, drop rate percentage must be very high whole numbers, not 0-1 with multiple decimal places. (how many chemistry workbench and mole miner gauntlet plans have you found vs how many ultracite targeting hud plans?)
---
  Specific to 76, participation in PvP is not required to sucessfully advance in the game (all materials provided by Workshops are readily available and easily obtainable outside of the workshop/designated PvP zone). 
---
  Since human players are not forced to battle each other to complete an objective, there is not a competetive advantage if you choose to not participate in PVP.
---
Competetive advantage does not apply when using PvP to deal with stealing/claiming a bounty, as game "required punishment" is death at the hands of another player.
---
====
---
That said, Yes, some items now being sold in the Atom Shop make it  easier to reach the endgame, but at this time, none of the items/things are absolutely required to complete the endgame.
---
&gt; It's buggy
---
Every Bethesda game is buggy. Anyone who purchases this game expecting it to not be buggy either has never played a Bethesda game or is a complete lunatic.
---
Over bethesda buggy. It's so buggy it's not charming anymore.
---
I see you have a very strong opinion.  
---
You probably haven't even played it, based on how strong your opinion is.  And that all games  would be pretty bland if put under the same microscope.  Doom is bland.  CoD is bland. BF is bland. Half-Life 2 bland. Borderlands 3. Bland.
---
Pro-tip: You can play it on PC for $1 by signing up for Microsoft PC Game Pass Beta.  Then you can have an experienced opinion without being upset it costs money.
---
&gt; I feel like what you're trying to say is that that this person feels like it's too much money, regardless of what the conversion is, because they are only contextualizing the price versus their own needs and environment.  
---
What else is there?? 
---
What else does one need, in order to decide whether or not to purchase a game subscription? 
---
What other armchair economist platitudes are you going to spout, while you continue to miss the forest for the trees?
---
Then you're just downright delusional.
---
Consider Wastelander’s implications.
---
It’s a completely unplanned expansion that introduces voice acted characters with dialogue trees. That’s a MASSSSSSSSIVE overhaul. They’re essentially making an entire storyline and functionality they never intended to make. That means hiring voice actors, getting your rigging artists working overtime, your programmers now have to do all this dialogue programming, faction path lines which apparently alter gameplay, etc. they’re more or less making a second game on the West Virginia map. 
---
Can you and I TRUTHFULLY, like being totally honest with yourself, can you say that this upcoming expansion most likely has cost them quite a significant amount of money just to develop something that’ll be acceptable enough for all the demands people have made for it to have for the last year?
---
Genuine question from me to you, not being condescending.
---
Yes, with microtransactions.
---
I wasn't having a go:) Just chewing the cud, sorry if it came off that way.
---
Yes we use them mostly too Tylenol being the drug acetaminophen which we call paracetamol (the INN or International nonproprietary name)
---
None of that is progression or advancement, it's convenience. Like most pay for convenience things, what you're really paying for it to play the game less. Neither gathering ingredients to make ammo nor draining the vendors of caps takes all that long through normal play, so the main thing Fallout 1st gets you is the ability to skip the actually fun parts of the game to do so.
---
No one is walking around without pacifist turned on so it doesn't matter if the tent can't be destroyed. PVP's broken enough already that if anything, it lets people who would be getting ganked by assholes break it in their favor.
---
Check OPs profile. His only other post is him asking if anyone knows a casino that allows use of cannabis oils.
---
Cause I'm still having fun
---
This.  Oh lootboxes are okay, it's Overwatch!  But then there was a period of time where it seemed like every game got them and look how many games they ruined because of them.  Look at whoever did the Battle Pass first.  Now look how many games are doing Battle Passes today.  Look at whoever did more than one Season Pass first.  How many games now have multiple Season Passes?  How about "time-savers" that are "optional"?  They probably were optional once upon a time, but now devs are deliberately designing games to be grindier and thus inherently less fun to try and railroad you into buying these "optional" time-savers while you're completely aloof to the fact that they're selling you the solution to a problem that they themselves created.
---
We've been down this road so many times that I find it difficult to believe that people still can't see where that road leads.
---
&gt; Over bethesda buggy.
---
Oblivion crashed every thirty minutes (yes, I timed it) for me when I first played it and there was never a fix for that. Everyone is making a big deal out of Fallout 76 but the truth of the matter is it could be far worse.
---
This is why I always figured my ammo and scrap sold.  If figured it was people that either didn't have time to farm or didn't like the farming aspect of the game.  I noticed that location seemed to matter a lot.  When I was by top of the world I couldn't keep stuff stocked in my vendor.  Now that I moved to a low traffic area I don't sell very much unless someone is looking for ammo then they usually buy all of it.
---
That's the time Id really appreciate cross play across consoles :( oh yeah after the long time without NPCs and the choices that you have to meet, 76 doesn't have it that's why I'm waiting for the wastelanders! The NPCs and dialogs choices it's going to be awesome! Aside from outer world's I'm playing new Vegas now, I never played it before, it's fun, but with a completely different game i would recommend red dead redemption if you haven't played it already, I had a lot of fun with it, most of the time I play fallout 76 new Vegas and outer world's for now. I'd also recommend trying dark souls :D id love to try out the bloodborn though!
---
LMAO..this guy...
---
Genuinely answering, no one on either side of the argument will have an answer. The expansion might be huge and truly change the game for the better, or it can be very short and once again bring a ton of criticism. We can’t asses that yet or assume that it’ll be a success, though I hope it is good
---
p2w is a competitive edge (Gold Rounds / Tanks = p2w)
---
p4c is a time/resource saver (Scrap Box / Tent = p4c)
---
Both are predatory at worst and greasy at best, but for different reasons, but p2w is not p4c and vice versus
---
I'm with you that folks here are too harsh on players enjoying a game.
---
But Bethesda's priority should have been.
---
1. Bugs
---
2. Client stability
---
3. Server stability
---
4. PVE QOL
---
5. Making existing content work (read: the rest of the bugs)
---
6. New content (read: Wastelanders)
---
...
---
99. Some sort of subscription service (read: 1st)
---
Sure, some folks will subscribe (I'm guessing more will take a $13 taste than truly subscribe). But they're throwing up a barrier to sales by not addressing real problems.
---
TL;DR: right on--don't blame the players. But DO blame Bethesda.
---
If you need this many excuses and rationalizing, you're probably doing something wrong. Supporting the product you like is great. But buying into this scheme isn't really supporting it in any meaningful way. It's just letting the publisher know you'll let them get away with doing less work, for more money. And in the long run, that can actually harm the game. If they keep alienating people, there may not be a game left to support.
---
Such troll, much wow 😂 I would give you silver I'd I had it. Take my upvote instead.
---
You’re just assuming things because you wouldn’t have a point otherwise
---
I don’t follow
---
r/insaneparents
---
I don't see how repeating campfire tales more than once a week or so could really be enjoyable
---
Yeah, well, that's just your opinion, man.
---
you win
---
You mean, it's letting people who would be getting ganked by assholes unilaterally initiating PVP against them at a workshop to actually defend themselves. About the only people who PVP anymore are jerks who only contest workshops to kill the owner for caps.
---
Thus far its been better than FO76 was when it had been out the same amount of time (from what I’ve seen)
---
A fair reply. Updooted for being able to have a civil conversation. 👍
---
You must have a pretty sad life if this is what passes for entertainment.
---
&gt; so your suggestion is to encourage
---
I never said anything of the sort.
---
&gt; paywalls
---
That said I have no problems with this "paywall" (aside from the storage stash and tent being part of it) because as someone who has worked with VPSes and dedicated servers I have no disillusion that running a server for a game is free.
---
Well Bethesda told my little 8 year old Virginia that there's no Santa Clause.
---
Lol! Best post yet!!
---
What in this subscription do you actually want?
---
Incorrect. Tim Cain and Leonard Boyarsky are the original creators of FALLOUT. 
---
And they veRy much are at Obsidian, and did creat TOW.
---
I think OP was talking about the green in the menu when you open the pip boy. I thought there was a setting for it under graphics, but I'm probably thinking about 4.
---
I agree that this was a bad PR move on Bethesda's part but let's all be honest, none of this is unprecedented. If anyone here played just about any MMO or rather any MMORPG out there then they'd know there has always been a two tiered system. Free or base game purchase users and the subscription users with perks. Now if you dig much deeper and look into their in game shops you will find purchasable XP boosts, gear stat boosters, buffs, base devices, travel advantages etc. None of this is new to the online gaming world and none of which give you a cutting real edge. People here willfully ignore those.
---
Now, purchasing actually legendary weapons on any MMO is a line that has never and will never be crossed by any game company. I think it's a silly topic to entertain just for the sake of escalating already existing tension.
---
A smaller branch of a huge company. Bethesda has a net worth of over 2 billion dollars. According to Todd Howard, they brought in people from every team. So it wasn't really a small group. And if the current group is small, that only looks worse on Bethesda. It makes it look like this game is little more than extra funding for their big projects.
---
I agree. It's possible to be soaked in enough rads that they can't be overcome. And if you can't retrieve your junk, well guess you won't do that again...
---
r/parentsarefuckingdumb
---
Yeah, bought it for a month to see if the raids and silos ran smoother (for me, at least, they are much more responsive now).  If anyone wants to tussle over it, well, I've had nearly 300 levels to gear up, so knock yourself out...
---
Personally I got Fallout 1st because I wanted to and really don't give a rats ass what anybody thinks or says..
---
I find myself throwing grenades alot - but yes I will be switching to rifleman unless I find a commando worthy weapon..
---
Nice review :)
---
cuck
---
I definitely want to play Red Dead Redemption at some point as I've heard very good things about it. I did try Dark Souls a year or so ago but I found  it too difficult. I became frustrated at getting killed all the time! :-)
---
Yeah but we haven't seen it yet, so it's a non-factor.
---
Thats because you don't need or want opossum badges obviously or are interested in a super fun event that all lvls can enjoy.
---
Maybe nothing more narcissistic than believing you're to thank for the game having an expansion. 
---
Rational arguments apparently equate to hyper emotion, and no, I don't care about a company's affection because companies aren't your friends. I even said that exact thing in my post, which you...didn't bother to read...you know like an adult would do. Meaning no matter how much you defend their actions...they aren't going to love you bud.
---
You truly are representative of the player base. And that's all I have to say about that.
---
I get that! The few times that people have approached me and interacted kindly have given me a lot of happiness because I’m also leery of people. I’m finding more and more that the FO community has some really amazing players. Glad you’re one, too.
---
What rilldo said. Demo expert only increases the actual explosive part of the damage. You would be better off putting the points in the sneak attack multiplier perk, for making that first shot really count.
---
Lol what so he can get some more atomic skins? *cough* I mean check out the sick new content
---
Or I'm just not a picky little incel who would rather bitch about how shitty a game is even though they play it daily. I've always been fallout. All these companies are the same. All about the bottom line. You really think being miserable about it is hurting Bethesda? Not really.
---
Bro. How many of my comments are you going to follow me into? 😂
---
Thanks mate! Any thoughts on FO1st? Or FO76 in general?
---
Potato Potahto. This game is all about playing efficiently and managing your inventory. Scrapbox and private servers give you a massive advantage in doing that. I would rather have the scrapbox over a stronger weapon or armor.
---
I know that quest can be hard, the first time I had to ask someone a low lvl if they could die and I revive them and the second I got lucky and the sheepsquatch (spelling is hard for me) event came up and I got it there easy. Now I just need to revive someone in the water.
---
Y i k e s
---
Honestly I'm not paying attention to names. And for some reason yours is showing as blank to me (and it's not the only one). I apologize if it comes off like I'm stalking you.
---
The junk is per character, not account wide.
---
That would be cool
---
Mostly to help the game succeed and continue to develop. 
---
 Now that I get 1600 atom's a month I will probly buy some camp stuff.
---
 The unlimited scrap components is pretty awesome. 
---
 Having a second free tele camp is pretty cool.
---
 It's $14 a month. I spend more than that on lunch each day so it's not a huge deal.
---
Lol all good. You were just in like 4 different comment strings in the same 2 minutes haha.
---
The community in this game is amazing. Zenimax is not unfortunately
---
Nah dawg
---
Ah ok, yes, that would be good too. 👍
---
"The world itself is client based."
---
And this is why it's driving me nuts that Beth CS is telling people that connectivity is causing client instability.
---
It seems to a lot of people on thud board it's "I don't like having to pay for things I want for free"
---
Actually they need to change the game from a subscription private server to personally hosting server so modders can mod the hell out of it.
---
Avoid controversial, better strategy for future content. One arrow hit two birds.
---
I didn't say it was bad. I'm jus using it as a example since it also gets alot of hate. I dislike fortnite but if someone likes it they have the right to.
---
I don't think scrap is serialized. You could store thousands of each in your own stash and see no issue. But if you store a couple hundred weapons or armor you'll get noticeable lag in the interface.
---
Then camo skins are pay to win.
---
Depends on the type of game. But mostly paying for advantages. If you can progress through a game in a way that is impossible or more difficult for people who don't pay, you're paying to win.
---
Ah damn you coulda got 40 scrip for that
---
&gt; 190 NZD = 120 USD, so that's the same price for the year subscription.
---
It's $100 in the US.
---
Do you see an indication that the legendary loot is generated on the client side or is pushed down from the server?
---
JuiceHead did a great video on this very subject. It would seem the original intent was for the two to be released together, but someone up top wanted the revenue generating part released regardless of how ready Wastelanders was or wasn't. Most likely someone from Providence, because if we're all 100% honest their involvement marks the beginning of a serious feeling that Zenimax has become disconnected from their fanbase. I can't argue that the timing is off, even though I do support the subscription.
---
You're not supporting or doing anyone who gives a shit about this fucked game a favor, by buying this garbage sub fee, you give them the greenlight to continue with selling you workarounds for inconveniences they have created in the first place, rather than develop a proper game in the first place that, if was done well, would keep the light on through simple initial purchase, and even if you're one of those fuckwits who likes to fool themselves into thinking "sErVeR cOstS tHo" is paid for through these "micro" transactions, then you're just making an even worse case.
---
If you buy some food in a restaurant and they purposely don't put any condiments or utensils, then when you ask where it is and they turn around and say you gotta buy those ontop of what you paid for, do you think you're doing yourself or any other customers favor by paying for those? No, all you're doing, is show them you're willing to let them shit down your throat and continue to do shoddy service until another fuckwit decides it's okay to be taken for a fool.
---
Being a true friend. I can respect that
---
I laughed so hard I spit soda outta my mouth. Thank you for making my week.
---
He's not talking about the oils.
---
Well connectivity does cause instability - if the client has to wait for a request to finish and it takes to long, the game goes out of sync. Client &lt;- Local Network handler &lt;- Server &lt;- Other server .. And most of it is in json that is being reinterpreted.. and reinterpreted... and reinterpreted before it ends up in actionscript (flash) to be shown in game ;)
---
Just quickly giving my opinion on your title alone. I Like the new map and story beats in Fallout 76, but having some random person jumping in-front of my face while I am trying to read or listen to a holotape ruins the immersion factor. I would like to have a private server, or better yet, just a solo game mode, so I can play the game at my own pace, and enjoy the experience... This is the only reason I would specifically like a private server for Fallout 76, but I get your point.
---
TL:DR - I would go play Fallout 4, but I want to experience the new and awesome West Virginia landscape and scorched plague story line.
---
Has a lot of potential but there’s kind of a lack in things to do. Not enough motivation you know? I don’t know *how* I got back into the game tbh, I quit from like December until 2 weeks ago. I’ve been playing daily since then and having a lot of fun.
---
The thing is, I didn’t like any of the quests and they all seemed super boring. I had no materials or food/water and had like 9 caps.
---
I think I understand homeless people now. You kind of just give up at one point, but mentally you have to make the effort.
---
I came back and I was like ehhh fuck I might as well start selling all this shit in my stash because it’s full
---
Ended up getting tons of caps, started with 9 caps and as of now have 2400 caps which is the most I’ve ever had I think, and just a reminder I spent a few hundred on vendors who had plans so yeah.
---
Fun game when you aren’t struggling, feels like it’s still in beta, doesn’t need a membership, awesome community.
---
Ooooh you got me bro, I’m burnt bad here.
---
Why are you getting so salty over a stranger calling a shit game shit?
---
Why do you have scrap on you for long anyway?   I had surplus junk in my stash well before the sub that cost about 300-400 units, meaning I had 500-400 units free for anything else.
---
Again, you still have to collect the junk you store, and you can easily store a surplus pre-sub
---
Would you be upset if everyone got access to the scrapbox and tent? Would you still feel like you are getting your money's worth? Sounds like you would if you were already buying atoms.
---
So, all your toxic aggressiveness aside, how do suggest a live game with support continue to update with no micro-transactions. I’m just curious what your solution is and what your qualifications to make these proposals are.
---
Yeah. It also gets way better if you install mods in f04
---
Where do you put down your shop?
---
I had some 50 plans I wanted gone, built just NE of V76, got a pretty good amount of traffic &amp; sold a majority of them in a short bit of time.
---
Being near V76 means they won't have to pay for much fast travel if any, helps coax people. I also found it helped if I hung around CAMP so people would see I wasn't a level 5 selling Chem Stations &amp; base Hunting Rifles etc.
---
Cause it sounds like your prices are more than fair, so I can only reason location. All my plans were at 29c except a handful of jetpack for 99c.
---
I even blueprinted a very basic structure, just a locked room with fusion genny &amp; a switch to turn off vendors, surrounded the building with foundations &amp; the vendors, a stash box &amp; one bench for scraping stuff. That way I can easily just plop it down when I need to sell stuff.
---
That said a modular camp design is excellent imo, smaller purpose built structures are far more likely to place down on the map than a giant grandiose house.
---
Soon this game will be 10 years in development and it still will have no content lmao
---
Might as well.  Its basically the same.
---
and?
---
Do you feel like the tent and other features should have been included, well suited for subscriptions or valuable enough to have been a one-time payment DLC?
---
This is interesting. Im on PC maybe this is why. But I have never experienced this and I rely on Nuka Cola for almost all my healing. 
---
What console are you on? If on PC maybe a sound driver issue with the drinking sound when consuming liquids in the game? 
---
If your on console there isn't anything YOU can do. But if your a PC player, what hardware are you running? Do you use a sound card or on-board audio? External DAC/Amp? 
---
I only say this because Beth games have been the only ones to give me trouble with my sound devices. Oblivion and Skyrim HATED my internal sound cards so I went USB and have been fine since. This was before FO4 was out. They would literally crash while loading certain sounds lol
---
It's not that deep chief.
---
It’s beneficial if you drop a nuke so you can continue to farm flux materials.  Fissure site prime spawns SB on every server so it really wouldnt matter, just server hop.
---
Its like night and day
---
Events and workshops clearly work better on private as there is no risk for idiots to mess it up for you
---
Oh dope, I've been misinformed. Glad they're still around.
---
All loot is generated server side. Client basically only knows there is something to loot (i.e. npc body, container, item on the floor and shows the interact button or popup and requests what it should show to loot). 
---
Not sure if the development room is the same though, some loot might be more hard coded in the client.
---
Lol you think this community is toxic? Subscription debate aside, this is one of the nicest communities ive seen. Hardly any grieving and im a low level that constantly takes workshops.
---
I would start grabbing the perk if he showed up in power amor instead of a coat
---
Many things have happened throughout the life of the game that have affected others the same way, you chose to specialize in Stable Flux as a means to acquire wealth in the game, and you feel this change has softened your market. I chose early in the game to specialize in PA fabrication &amp; Modding services, I worked very hard to get all the needed plans, endlessly grinding events, and buying/using Treasure Maps, it was a lucrative venture, until all the plans were added to the vendor pools, and now readily available to all. 
---
Just because something like this has some undesirable effect on the way you play the game, that doesn't make it "Pay to Win", the only thing in the FO 1st bundle that even remotely resembles P2W would be the Forward Tent, and even that isn't exclusive as I have been using Mobile/Modular Camps like many others for quite some time that provide more functionality and require only a small cap fee to relocate/rebuild wherever it's needed.
---
The Scrap box is very convenient, but provides no tactical advantage, and in the end may significantly reduce server loads as players eliminate the use of Mule characters.
---
Oh absolutely! Honestly, playing on my own server and the atoms alone would be worth it to me. 
---
I’d have no issue if they removed the tent AND scrap box and instead turned them into fun little side quests like the Pioneer Scouts backpack.
---
I've wanted to change the appearance of my character but can't seem to figure it out. How do you do it? I'm on PS4 if that helps
---
I mean this in the most literal way possible. 
---
Get a life.
---
So here are the pros and cons as I seem them:
---
Pros:
---
* Since there are not other people, you don't have situations where you go to an area that was previously visited by higher levels and the mobs are too high of a level for you. This is common near Whitesprings for example
---
* You can take workshops alone and maintain them, this is great for getting all the black titanium you need from the junkyard for example. 
---
* No need to worry about people one-shot killing legendaries at events
---
Cons:
---
* With no one else there, as you said it can make vending tough
---
* It can make some events nearly impossible, or outright impossible, like trying to take on the imposter sheepsquatch. 
---
* It can feel empty, but I typically played solo before just on a world with other people. Many times I never saw anyone anyways. 
---
That said, nothing currently locks you into a private server, you can spend some time there, then when you feel a bit lonely, jump back to adventure. 
---
Alternatively, you can try to make some friends.  Friends, even non-subscribers, can join into your private session and you can get around some of the cons.
---
&gt; most subscriptions are cheaper and offer way more.
---
Just because they're cheaper and offer more doesn't mean they're more valuable to me. If I want to play a video game it's completely irrelevant what the fair cost of a movie subscription is because that subscription won't get me the service I want. Worse yet outside of outlier titles there is only one company delivering open world experiences the way Bethesda creates them.
---
They'll probably see a lot more propaganda. I'm ready for the *inexplicable* downvotes that are about to be thrust upon me. Probably won't get much response though
---
This is such manipulative pull on your heartstrings bullshit. You don't get to paint yourself as a hero to the devs by buying First, just to ease your guilt in buying a product you know is shit. Fuck right off with that.
---
This is how every company gets you to accept their bad business practices. Don't punish the workers. 
---
That's every industry. Think about everything you DON'T buy. With this logic, suddenly you're not supporting ANY of those workers.
---
Lol. I bet that's it.
---
Elevated platform built with scrap boxes.
---
Give her wine and flowers. Then she won't even notice.
---
Just buy the 1 month sub.
---
They are actually one of the smallest developers on the market. They are the only "major" one that isn't incorporated. They can't just sell more stocks to raise money. The only reason they reached 2.5 billion in met worth is because Providence invested about a million in them. Half right before they announced Fallout Shelter, and another around the release of Fallout 4. So, no. They do not have the financial capital to keep a failing division of their company afloat. Especially when that division has other, better things to work on (TESIV)
---
"There is no war in Ba Sing Se"
---
People actually buy steel &amp; wood? Far and away the most plentiful mats. I generally end up bulking &amp; selling to NPC vendor as I know I can get it easily enough.
---
When in game open the map then open the menu that shows atomic shop and quit to menu options. Somewhere there it will have the option to change appearance again.
---
Its your money dude, you work for it, you earn it, stop letting other people tell you how to spend your money or your time.
---
Who gives a shit if the reasons are right, if you want to buy it because it looks like something you want then buy it.
---
This is why most people are pissed about the sub. They put two extremely helpful items behind a paywall that should have been available to everyone through some quest like the backpack. When you combine them with the private server you have a massive advantage in PvE over non-subs.
---
Probably.   “Stop whining it’s not a necessary feature”
---
They should have had the subscription be a thing from the beginning, just like ESO. It would have just been seen as another way to invest in the game, in a more economical way. People would be far less upset if it had been there since the beginning. Also, the game would probably be better off because there would have been more resources to address the issues in the game.
---
&gt; (take any router with DPI and SSL interception)
---
We do the same thing here where traffic gets decrypted/re-encrypted when it enters through our F5 but  someone's Fallout 76 client would need to be communicating through something similar which seems an unlikely case scenario... and in order for it to communicate back-and-forth the game client would need the router's certificate since the data would be re-encrypted by the router to maintain its MITM status. It might be disingenuous to say there is now an HTTPS decrypting boogie man lurking around the corner that can strike anyone randomly :p 
---
&gt; That secret is only there to validate that the payload wasn't edited during transit, but it's visible
---
Yes they're signed JWTs not encrypted. The "signature" doesn't have any value being visible. The "secret" shouldn't appear in the transmission at all. If you have the secret key then that is actually a disaster. That personal data should be encrypted though and makes me wonder how this is handled for players in the EU.
---
I play on PC, its about the same as its ever been. Dead. 
---
I used to fast travel to all the shops to get plans/items I dont have. I now visit the same damn camps over and over even after leaving for hours and coming back. I see the same names popping up all the time. Maybe all the players on PC are no longer merchants? IDK. I haven't even been grieved in months. Something is happening, be it a dying game or just getting unlucky? Without real numbers we are all just guessing.
---
I’ll be your friend in game :) I need more people to play with. What platform are you on? Personally I have it for Xbox and PC So I guess I just hope you’re not on PlayStation 😂 also this is such a wholesome post and it’s moments like this that keep me playing. But seriously, DM me and let’s meet up in Appalachia
---
Supporting a business that has broken their word.
---
so you value pay for convenience. Having more caps or scrap is not a win condition. This game doesn't really have a win condition. This issue is the difference in p2w vs p4c again their is no competitive advantages given, zero. They offer pay for convenience, which you correctly point out is more important to some and does improve QoL for sure. Is it greasy they made a paywall for that? Sure but it doesn't help you attain a victory, like a true P2W does. Again the OP was asking what P2W was, and their is a big difference between P2W and P4C.
---
I would be able to help further if I could see the menu right now.
---
Well, thanks for the polite “fuck right off” first of all. Always nice to see civil discourse on reddit. :)
---
Secondly, your argument makes little sense. I don’t own a private jet. But me not supporting the private pilots isn’t because I have a thing against private pilots, I have no interest in their services. 
---
Fallout 76 I do patron their services however and as such, supporting them makes sense now doesn’t it? :)
---
It could be implemented like the collectron or the fridge an I wouldn't even mind that tbh. Want to give me a tent for 500 atoms, the scrap box for 500, and so on? I'd be okay with it. I'm not overly thrilled about that and would much rather these be attainable through a quest or something but that would be acceptable imo. At least it wouldn't be locked behind a subscription service. Also, don't make any of the utilities more than 500 atoms. Like the fridge. That was overpriced for sure.
---
2 different games buddy
---
FO4 is superior to 76 in almosy every single way. If there's something you don't like or thought should have been added, there's a mod for that. If you want people to look like Disney characters when they speak, there's a mod for that. If you want autonomous power armor to roll around with you like a companion, but also have actual companions, and a dog, and a robot, and vertibirds, and a gun that shoots cars, there are mods.
---
Understood, peace brother.
---
Pro, Sometimes it's easier to find unlooted stuff.
---
Pro, You can take all the workshops.
---
Con, You can't keep friends out yet.
---
Con, Not enough people for some events.
---
Con, No people to buy things from you.
---
For me it doesn't seem to effect legendarys, I think I find more in normal worlds.
---
No it's not. Fortnite isnt a bad game it's made extremely well and has lots of constant weekly support with minimum bugs and lots of communication with the community. Whether it's fun is subjective but its objectively an all around good and well made game. Fallout 76 is objectively bad but that doesnt mean you cant like it or enjoy it. Its buggy as hell with constant game breaking shit happening to nearly every player. It has no endgame and meh content and lots to progress to but no real reason to do it. It has minimum communication with the community so you never really know what to expect next and they add in new content with new bugs without fixing bugs that desperately need fixed and have needed fixed for a long time. Fallout 76 is objectively a bad and poorly made game. What's subjective is whether you find it fun or not despite this.
---
I like 76's workshop attacks better than FO4.  In 4 (without mods) the enemies spawn in particular locations you can figure out, and they can't break through walls you build or anything, so you can effectively block them out. 
---
I find it a bit more challenging in 76 since I can't create small robot or settler armies to defend the settlements.  
---
So for me, taking a few workshops and defending them (including against other players) is a more interesting experience than what I could get in FO4, settlement wise.  
---
I also love building my camps, and even with mods in FO4, I find there are just more interesting, out of the way spots for camps in FO76 than FO4 had - perhaps because there are distinct regions.
---
Agreed. I stopped replying with my thoughts because I just got shit on over and over.
---
I want Wastelanders just as bad as everyone else, but I want them to take the extra time if they need it. I am still having fun with the game the way it is now, and $12 is nothing. I play FO76 way more than I watch Netflix, so it has so much more value to me. 
---
It baffles me to think they'd get private servers for free. I think it's a fair price especially with all the other added things.
---
Well I don't have it, but as a gamer it upsets me. I don't want game companies to think it's alright to do shitty business practices like this in the future, and I think that Bethesda deserves more punishment for releasing and treating Fallout 76 the way that they have. I think that buy it promotes these shitty practices and cushions Bethesda's punishment
---
This Cold War nostalgia is getting out of hand
---
I'm PC. I have run the repair tool, updated all my drivers, and have a tech degree so I'm pretty sure I know what I am doing better than most. This seems to be a wide-spread problem across many different platforms, so I would guess this is a game-side bug more than specific drivers and hardware not playing nice with the game. But I WILL double-check if my sound driver is being shitty. Thanks!
---
Pros: 
---
• No one, one shotting the legendary in events screwing everyone else there.
---
• no worries of anyone trying to instigate PvP with you when you’re just teamed with friends exploring the wasteland and doing events. 
---
• with friends doing events that everyone either knows what to do to complete event or willing to listen to direction to complete it. 
---
• overall smoother server experience, no one changing worlds constantly, no one glitching anything or duping.
---
Those are just a few... 
---
Cons... got nothing yet...
---
That would be a neat way to spot the whales to grief them. I agree with this idea.
---
Lol wtf
---
Not really. Those are conveniences for hoarders, not an advantage over other players.
---
Workshops don't provide an advantage and are typically a terrible way to get resources. 
---
Fast travel locations are everywhere and are very cheap. 
---
Scrap box is unnecessary at all because you can easily have a surplus of scrap and plenty of room for weapons and armor in stash. 
---
You can always server hop for fresh locations. 
---
Stop rationalizing and shift the means of P2w to whatever you want it to mean. 
---
It gives no measurable advantage other than psychological ND that's a fact. 
---
 You still have an upper cap and daily cap limit.
---
100% agreed. The entire game feels like it's still in beta and the only part that even feels "finished" is NW which isn't a mode I play all that much.
---
The point is you can now safely store thousands of each scrap, thousands of units of weight, and have all 800 of your stash for legendaries, chems, etc.
---
Sounds like you built one already... soooooo salty.... have a Snickers... probably won’t help you...
---
It’s almost like vault tec is controlling it..
---
Still vague and subjective as to what "advantage" means.
---
They shouldn't cave. I don't think it should be given to everyone, if for no other reason than how they've reacted. It's become readily apparent that there's a group of people playing the game that have 0 appreciation for how much what has been done costs, or how hard the actually programmers work on a game like this. Often there's a handful of really talented people, on salary, plugging away day and night to make things happen, because that's their passion. If I were one of these programmers/designers, and saw this kind of childish outburst from the vocal part of the community, I would definitely do what I could to make sure those people didn't get anything other than what was promised for free.
---
Made me not want to play anymore and no I'm not a fucking hater before anyone starts. It's the big wigs at Bethesda and there corporate greed.. on that not check out the Outer Worlds until this whole 76 mess has come to a conclusion.
---
The you cannot go this way doesn't bother me personally. What I found weird instead is the fence the runs all across the square, except for the river border with Ohio on the left side of the map. It was there in Fallout 4 as well, don't remember about 3 and NV, but it's the weirdest thing about all the map borders among all the games I've ever played.
---
If I was on I would do it while I told you what it said. But unfortunately I not
---
It's like paying extra for some more bugs.
---
But once the bugs are gone, it's actually not soo bad.
---
microsoft owns obsidian game studios
---
Oh I just noticed I have not played the event yet because it's coming out tomorrow I just saw it on Twitter :D it must have been other Halloween related event. Oh yes dark souls is frustrating I destroyed my controller because of it haha
---
It’s good for looting mats. Some events are better too if all you’re trying to do is maximise legendaries (one violent night, Uranium Fever, Horde events, Leader of the Pack). It’s also utterly fantastic for moving stuff between alts. 
---
Beyond that I’d still rather wander in the public servers.
---
The same way any other game without a cash shop does: by making an actual decent game and respectful of its playerbase, a good start is to not create inconveniences with the intent to sell the workaround.
---
Another good step is to not pretend your playerbase asked for gameplay affecting items.
---
Per Bethesda website; You keep the Forward Tent, and the Outfit, Icons, &amp; Emotes, you will still have the Scrap box and contents, but it will be withdraw only, you lose the ability to store additional scrap in it.
---
Find your confidence my friend. You seem to have a kind soul and we all need more of that.
---
I doubt there is a boogie man waiting on everyone's connection, but if you want to play FO76 on a open wifi that just magically appeared while you are waiting at the airport.. or any other scenario where people expect safety ;)
---
Secret key isn't in the transmission no... it's generated from properties that are transmitted though.
---
Edit: I'm in the EU btw, so no special encryption done for us ..
---
He means what if they charge you for it, but still give it to everyone else for free.
---
The biggest argument is "they lied". They didn't. They never once said they wouldn't offer a subscription service similar to ESO. Seeing as how it came from the same company, I feel like everyone should have expected it.
---
I enjoy it. Sunday my buddy and I went into a world with our level 20s and had a great time leveling up without worry about people getting in our way or setting mob spawns at a higher level. It was great.
---
I'd be more than happy even to at times invite people into my private world, no reason that particular perk has to be locked up, I mean that's why they allow non-subscribers to join the private worlds of friends anyways.  
---
The atoms and outfits were nice, like the scrap box, the tent is neat but I don't really use it (or rather, I'm not really abusing it)
---
Misadvertisment is illegal in every 1st world country
---
You do realize if there really was a god mode bug the people who live to trash the game would be spreading it deliberately, right?
---
Builds can definitely be “OP” though with the right gear, agree with you on that.
---
Why the hell would they do that? What are they testing?
---
How many of these changes you mentioned only positively affected people who paid real world money? *That's* the problem.
---
OK. Why the hell do I need to hoard 100 of every Chem or 1000s of units of each scrap? If I suddenly stopped collecting chems and scrap, that would still give me months of supply from my storage...
---
Youre worrying about not being able to hoard as well. Welcome to every rpg ever. 
---
Inventory management is a pain.   And yes, they should give scrap boxes for every player, I have a feeling they might after this. But I don't think it's pay to win. Doesn't make it right.
---
Did the disappearing junk go away in the bottomless stashbox?  The first of my friends who bought 1st lost all the junk in his stash box.  I know based on that it was not simply an exaggerated issue.
---
Okay let me reword that since you clearly need more time to make up some answer. 
---
How do they MONETIZE this game after launch? 💁🏼‍♀️
---
Thank you for clarifying for us my guy! Much appreciated!
---
How do you know it's shit if you don't even own it?  
---
Groupthink much?
---
Shhh Todd
---
rain furrest 2k20 babay
---
They have been pretty shitty. But I'm hoping they they will eventually go back to their old way and become great again
---
Nah
---
you keep the scrap box, just cant add more scrap to it if your sub lapses. Not sure on the tent yet though. My thought will be that it will be in your inventory but greyed out with a fallout first icon near it prompting you to sub up to use it again.
---
My only interest in F1st is being able to play solo but now that I've completed most things on the map, I can't justify $13 a month since I've got no real reason to keep playing.
---
I wanted BGS to just give me an offline mode, but that wouldn't bring any money in for them.
---
But they don’t deserve to be punished for wanting to buying something in a game they like.
---
• great time with friends exploring and doing quests. 
---
Haven’t placed the scrap box, not sure I really need it, I have a lot of bulk I’m not gonna break down.... 
---
Haven’t placed the tent... not cap poor by any means so haven’t thought about it. 
---
Go figure the scrap box and tent peoples that don’t like the subscription top issues but I don’t use them... go figure...
---
That would be cool but then Bethesda would be getting 0 income from the game which they obviously need very much if they even considered doing something like fallout 1st.
---
It didn't sound like he was talking about false advertisement though. I was thinking something more along the lines of implied warranty or something.
---
Unfortunately I just don't enjoy 1st person.
---
Fair enough
---
That’s your God given right, this is America. I’m just saying, being on this sub is exhausting to see people complain to no end. Just fix it yourself.
---
Won't happen if people keep giving them money for being shitty.
---
Then wait 20 years for a response!
---
Do you go around harassing people who chose to smoke? Maybe throw it in their face they're ruining public health by their choice?
---
You play fallout in 3rd person? I could never get used to the feel.
---
I would actively encourage and probably myself sub to this game, had they done or fixed anything worth noting. The fact is, it's a mess at the end of the day. Why would anyone give money for that. What I really want to know is what half of you are even doing to keep yourself entertained in-game, I can't even find something to do for 20 minutes that I haven't done a million times before.
---
I will check it out.
---
Did you find out how it works?
---
Nah, they advertised the game running smoothly and for a good while it didn’t.
---
You make a pretty good point
---
Yes, go and play it for 20 hours and come back after you beat it and are bored.
---
Free on game pass and made by the original fallout creators.
---
this
---
Do you get money from obsidian for your cheap advertisement?
---
That's about the only con, honestly. I guess if you wanted to nuke the queen, fight the imposter sheepsquatch, or run Project Paradise, you'd have a bad time being the only player in your server. But of course there's no guarantees anyone will show up to those events on a public server either.
---
It is a weirdly different experience being totally alone in that huge map. It's hard to describe and different from just playing solo on a public server or even running around in the other single-player games. No NPCs and no contact with anyone at all (except Grahm, if you find him) is a new kind of eerie.
---
But you're right, there's no competition in Uranium Fever, no one running One Violent Night differently than you want to, no one scooping up legendaries in the farming sites, and so on. It's more stable, too - though if you jump into even a private server with 7 other players, some of that stability can go away.
---
I haven't had the need yet, but being able to kick a player from your server for griefing or wearing that one Vault 94 PA that can crash the game or whatever is another enormous plus. Yeah, it's friends-only in your server, and a lot of players have a bunch of randos in their friends list from trading, so it's entirely possible for some undesirables to join you on your server and create a bad time. At least this way you can do something about it.
---
This game doesn’t deserve moments like this anymore. Honestly though, Thanks for sharing.
---
Honestly. They aren't being underhanded. People heard what they wanted to hear, and it's been misquoted so many times that some people are outraged over things that were never said. They didn't lie. They haven't misled anyone. People just heard "free" and didn't listen to what came before or after.
---
There is some disconnect between the consumer base and whoever has been calling the shots for the last few years, but there hasn't been any truly devious behavior.
---
Shhhhhh don’t let them know.
---
It helps get the perfectly preserved pies!!!
---
I have a quad auto Tesla with FFR.  I rarely use it so if someone is on PS4 and wants to buy or trade let me know.  I’m trying to find a sentinel chest armor piece to round out my set.
---
There are other countries than America but ok
---
Same here. I would definitely prefer 3rd person option, but it's worth playing anyway.
---
Totally agree. Unfortunately the mods will remove this post because they feel threatened by the outer worlds.
---
All I care about is playing a game....the only feelings I have for a company is maybe nostalgia if anything.
---
If I decide to pay for a service or something that makes my play time more fun and less stress so be it.  I shouldn’t be targeted and harassed by hordes of entitled brats like you which is gladly a minority of the player base.
---
I keep hearing PLAY 2 WIN reeeeeeeeeeeee...
---
Play to win what?  How the hell is my sub keeping others from progressing?  This isn’t a CoD ladder where you’re competing for top spot in KDR.  It’s nothing compared to running corporations and building infrastructure in space like Eve.  
---
The only competition is what?  He who has the most junk?  lol
---
Don’t start spouting caps heck I stay maxed caps.....it’s not hard.  Most of my hours I spend buying newbies crap to spread the love and building and selling modded PA.
---
I’ve played since May because no way in hell I was going in at launch with what I could see.  The rest of you “founders” did your trophy come in the mail?  Nope.
---
My point is play the game like you want and try to be happy.  If you don’t agree with the game and it’s direction then go find another game.
---
I’m the biggest fallout fan boy, this game is more fallout than 76.
---
Snowflake.
---
Great post, I think that for people who casually spend money on the atoms each month like myself, this is a no brainer. I think the other things from 1st should have been included in the game for free, but for the atoms alone, this is well worth it.
---
Now I'm starting a career as a gunsmith, not interested yet. But... Nah not interested at all sorry. We'll see on Q2 2020
---
I fuck around mainly. Occasionally spend a couple hours hunting for neat camp locations. I also started leveling a side character so I can swap between Gunner and Melee characters. Other than that the daily quests and atom quests. Do all that and it’s like 3-4 hours
---
Oh do go away, boring boring yawn and boring  👎

Best off getting the Russian perspective but they want to avoid the USA being able shut down their network or hack them I think.

How much access does the rest of the world have through the internet to the country? And whether they can create government operated filters effectivly.
---
Something along those lines Id wager.
---
The other day someone said the game was short. I've spent 10+ hours on the first planet doing all the side missions and picking up just about everything I can find.
---
TriKool HOES MAD TriKool
---
Was it really gone or was it a UI bug like they said it was? My understanding is that it didn't actually dissappear and people still have the stuff they just cannot see it.
---
I love FO76... but I have to agree. Try The Outer Worlds.  It's pretty amazing.  Once I've finished,  I'll head back into FO76. Lol.
---
&gt; I saw a guy coming to brag about how he has a house and three cars and can throw money away on this
---
To be fair I wonder how many people in this subreddit are complaining it's too expensive...  only to buy cigarettes or some other addictive substance that is detrimental to their health.
---
Uh ok?
---
Yep, paying for storage in a pay-to-play game. This is something I was happy to do for Path of Exile, hell even Runescape back in the day, but not in a game I've already paid for.
---
I just use the scrap box because I dont like micromanaging my stash. The camp I use really only on low level characters or next to my friends workshop so I can fast travel their to protect it
---
No, it is not.
---
As I understand, no only during subscription.
---
Oh we’re in the same boat. Being totally fair, I think a LOT of us First-ers would have been totally happy with the atoms and private servers and maybe the outfit (Id have just bought the outfit again outright if it didn’t come free lol).
---
There's not nearly as many people "alienated" as you might think. Also, all this use of words with negative connotations like "scheme" and "devious", "underhanded". It does nothing to help prove anyone's point, and just makes everything seem way worse than it is.
---
It's an optional subscription. They never promised this game wouldn't have one, that was something people incorrectly inferred, because it's what they wanted to happen. Nothing offered by it affects the way the game has been played for free. This is all a complete over reaction, based on people misquoting what was said.
---
   
---
Horrible decision that destroyed the hype for wastelanders and the desire to play 76. I can't seem to understand how they were so stupid
---
Are you serious? You think all the sales happen on day 1 and then the money just dips after a couple months or something?
---
A good game generates revenue long after its initial release by being a good fucking game, that will sell a long time post release.
---
Then content patches that, again, respects its playerbase, drives more sales, and then expansions / DLCs that are well made augment that.
---
Refer to literally any game that sells well without the need to pay for conveniences for that.
---
I think that you need a material difference(?) for false advertising. So if they were to say something like "the story will provide 15 hours of playtime" and you complete it in 14 it's not false advertising. But if they say something like "all DLC and features will be free" and then they add paid features then it is false advertising. At least that's how I understand it. I could be wrong though.
---
Fallout 76. It's not the best choice. It's Spacer's Choice!
---
If they were dedicated persistent servers then I see no problem in the pricing. But, since they are just recycled worlds put into a buggy instance, the pricing is unrealistic. Not to mention we can only have a very few amount of people join. There are many games that let you boot up a free private world for you and friends (e.g. GTA Online). If they can’t handle it then they should have never promised it in the first place.
---
I could definitely see how this game is a huge financial investment for them in terms of development time, staff salaries, and server maintenance. It very well could be that they needed the influx of cash to meet development goals not only for this game but others they are currently working on and the current monetization system in place just isn't paying the bills. I think it's very possible they have a very valid financial decision for the release of fallout first they way they did but it just leaves a bad taste for supporters of the franchise and Bethesda's as a whole and leads to questions regarding their financial decisions given the insane profitability of skyrim and fallout 4. I get that it might be suicide for the stock to admit they over extended themselves producing fallout 76 and aren't seeing the returns they expected but I think it would go a long way toward fan goodwill if they simply express the return on investment they were expecting and how it hasn't been met as well as being more transparent on how it is going to be spent. Honestly if they simply came out an said we need X amount of dollars to have say elder scrolls 6 out by X date there very well would be prenty of people willing to invest early. Of course that opens a larger can of worms down the road than preorders already.
---
That being said I feel like the atom store as a whole has been fairly disappointing if that's how they truly expected to get a return on investment. They could have done so much more with emotes. As unpopular as the opinion may be, could have gone a very fortnite route and included dances, taunts, laughter, and even simpler but useful things like an emote in which your character points at whatever you're aiming at (very useful in my opinion for dropped loot). Also, more plushies, lots more plushies (personally pretty much the only items I've bought). Also simple skins like plain shirts but allow to choose from a range of colors when built, basically allow cosmetics to be more personal than everyone running around with whatever raider mask or mascot head. 
---
Ok well now this is becoming a wish list...
---
TLDR: Basically I'm just saying they could have responded better to the community and if they really needed the return on investment, gotten better feed back on what cosmetics would sell better rather than including gameplay changes (stash boxes increases, fridges ect) people have asked for behind a pay wall.
---
Lol sorry maybe I am delusional
---
I did a little test with a bloody puncturing power fist and a meat hook, both b/ss/90.  Even with additional gladiator perks, the power fist does a couple dozen more points of damage. The meat hook lists a higher base damage, but the armor piercing mod on the fist provides a benefit that outweighs the gladiator boost, even with a mutton and glowing meat steak and in the mix.  The hook might surpass the fist if you eat all the steaks, but the fist is better for normal scenarios where you don’t have all the meats or the buffs wear out. You can also use perk points for blocker and whatever else, since you don’t need gladiator anymore.
---
The ap effect is also true for a hunting rifle vs a lever gun. The hunting rifle is always going to hit harder because of the armor penetration the magazine mod provides. The hunting rifle is more likely to kill an enemy in one hit, but the lever gun shoots faster, so it depends on what you’re trying to do with a long gun.
---
I just have a lot of bulk so haven’t had the need tbh... might in the future just not a priority for me, haven’t made the ranger outfit either.
---
Even if this isn't an example of regional pricing screwing over us Kiwi's, keep in mind the 4K 4 screen Netflix is $21.99 a month here in NZ. So I ask myself, is Fallout 1st $2 a month more entertaining than Netflix? Of course it isn't, so I'm gonna give it an hard pass thanks very much.
---
If you ever wanna see a legitimately egregious example of regional pricing though, give Game's Workshop a look. Change their UK prices to NZ dollars, and then compare it to what they actually charge. It goes from a 2 times exchange rate to a 3 times increase in price.
---
&gt; There's not nearly as many people "alienated" as you might think.
---
You're more than free to prove this claim with evidence. The game has only sold roughly 2 million copies. Trophies on PSN have already proven that Bethesda lied about numbers. 
---
Because right now, it's what you think vs. what I think. And a lot of people are alienated. All you have is anecdotal stories of seeing people online with the outfits or tents. The number of people not playing this game vastly outnumbers the ones that do, and let me tell you, this BS isn't going to win many more.
---
Considering the number of likes, any video condemning FO1st, is in the tens of thousands, I'd wager more people hate this service than like it.
---
exactly
---
That was the initial message I received from a dev that it was strictly a visual glitch. We confirmed in fact everything was gone to somewhere, I simply lacked components to craft. If there is a rollback of characters it will have to be in mass &amp; I wonder what will become of the new junk collected?
---
Iv got a permanent camp built into a pylon east of Morgan town, might have to rethink my camp, iv also got an adhesive farm there
---
Unfortunately it can mean either of those things depending on the person. One of my favorite Youtubers, Gopher, suggested the term "pay to not suck" for your first definition: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MFjepWWv9xA
---
Just the odd sign with 'Here there be dragons' 'No fishing!' 'No Entry! 💀  ' 'Build the Wall' etc would more fun, that fence is simply odd.
---
Good list.  I'd add you can feel comfortable about lining up and organizing all your PA without worrying someone coming by to screw with you.
---
You don't usually get messed with in this game but the threat is always there.
---
&gt;I doubt there is a boogie man waiting on everyone's connection, but if you want to play FO76 on a open wifi that just magically appeared while you are waiting at the airport.. or any other scenario where people expect safety ;)  
---
Like I said it seems unlikely because the game client wouldn't have the necessary certificates :p This works a lot better with web browsing sessions because users are more likely to accept or ignore certificate warnings where the "client" is the web browser. If Fallout 76 did this it likely wouldn't be able to connect because the router would be presenting an invalid cert.  
---
&gt;Secret key isn't in the transmission no... it's generated from properties that are transmitted though.   
---
No the secret key is what you use to generate the signature based on the payload. I think secret/signature are being confused. The secret is a hidden value on both the client and server side. The signature is generated by hashing the payload against the secret. The payload is verified on the server side by hashing it against the same secret. Source: I work with these daily
---
Originally they said it was a UI bug but after more testing they confirmed some people actually lost stuff.
---
It's a shame because the few people that were happy with fallout have become even fewer.. and I really don't think it's our guys at Bethesda (Todd and pete) it's in the investors and all those devil worshippers.
---
Or how about making it so that when it rains, the inside of your everything doesn't get wet.
---
Wait, NV is still buggy, I love NV but it’s a buggy mess most of the time
---
If on a private server rush through them all takes a few for things to respawn in private servers cuz it seems they respond when the next player enters the area
---
I have several friends who own it, I have read reviews, I have seen videos, I have the ability to judge whether something is shit by the fact that I have played hundreds of video games to compare it to.
---
Why do you think it’s good when it’s objectively not.  I’m not saying that you can’t have fun, I’ve played and enjoyed several shit games in the past, but they’re still shit, like 76.
---
I actually put this on a Facebook post discussion and people just ripped me apart for it.
---
I’m disabled. Fallout is my absolute favorite game series, and I really enjoy 76.  I got 76 when I first got sick (launch)  and it’s been helping me through ever since. 
---
I bought a month of 1st, and people are just slamming me left and right for it. I switched icons because idiots kept harassing me in game.  (I don’t mind combat, but constantly following me and being annoying is stupid.)
---
I understand both viewpoints, but come on.  If you don’t like it, don’t buy it. But just let me enjoy the game.
---
But they aren’t monetizing their DLC... and the 76 game already only appeals to specific markets that can only get so big so continued box sales which (being a double bachelor business major With literal video game industry experience I feel it’s fair to say this) is incredibly insignificant compared to micro-transaction revenue. 
---
We don’t live in the early 2000’s dude. Games cost more to make. $60 in 2001 is not the same as $60 today.
---
Perhaps someone should "cough" "cough" take care of the executives at bethesda
---
I've done a couple of sessions as a guest on someone else's server.
---
It is, in effect, the "Single Player" version of 76, just not self contained on your systems hard drive.  Even so, still rather liked it.
---
It's also appealing to the anti-social side of my personality.  Sometimes, I want to play without being disturbed by anyone - which is usually not possible on the public side.
---
Alternately, it lets you play with a small group of trusted people from the adventure side - which I suppose is how you'd complete many events designed for co-op.
---
( I'm sure we've all read stories of players soloing the queen, but  I can't quite imagine sucessfully soloing arktos.)
---
I like the entire '76 game except for other people and shitty servers.  I'd have much preferred '76 be a paid DLC for F04.
---
I will say though that combat in '76 is lightyears behind F04.  Just fire F04 up to see.
---
I was expecting the ranger outfit to look like trash but it actually looked pretty damn good
---
By Bulky do you mean Sturdy?  Cause Bulky is not an option.  You have combat armor, sturdy combat armor and heavy combat armor.  Each type has its own base starting value for protection.  Then it goes up from there based on which mod you put on it.  
---
 [https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Combat\_armor\_(Fallout\_76)](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Combat_armor_(Fallout_76))
---
I assume you mean heavy, and yes it is still considered the same only the heavy, sturdy or light is removed from the name.
---
God God how long did that take?! You a strength character?
---
Ohh didnt know that! Makes sense why it's on there day one!
---
Those are rookie numbers.
---
I dont agree with you because we already paid 60$ upfront, in all other cases that 60$ is enough to spawn Big Expansion DLC AND Sequels.
---
haha don't think just mindlessly consume product then move onto next product
---
Damn... thought I'd be able to finesse them with a month sub. Those two things are the only things valuable to me in the sub. I've been asking for the tent since day one. Felt like a slap in the face knowing its behind the paywall.
---
Those are actually really good. Impressive work.  
---
So how do you sign up for this, exactly?
---
Okay, Bethesda isn’t making you subscribe or play the game. And you are quickly making how much money they have to deliver free content like waste landers “your problem” with all the demands your making.
---
This sounds fun do I just send it to you?
---
http://imgur.com/gallery/hP3GXeF
---
Damn straight. Wish more people figure this out already
---
Bethesda Softworks has lost my business. The games I enjoy (elder scrolls,fallout) are being milked for nostalgia in progressively lazier ways. Fuck this company.
---
Sorry you lost your junk, if you're on PS4 for 76 I can throw some stuff your way depending on what you need. Or if nothing else what feels like a lifetime of fusion cores.
---
Except the numbers have repeatedly show that only a small percentage of people actually buy microtransactions, but those that do spend are willing to spend thousands of dollars on them.
---
That’s really about it, meaning the cons of others either being selfish or purposely out to ruin someone else... 
---
People I play with are cool, even if we PvP we don’t even take others stuff... it’s all about fun, correction, mutual fun. 
---
I get some like doing that stuff... great, maybe Bethesda should maybe change dot color to show players interested in it so they can have at it?
---
I haven't had any of my stash disappear at all thankfully! I feel for those who have though
---
Intelligence if you want more xp, and perception if you want more probabilities to hit on VATS.
---
FO1st o. Its own doesn't seem that bad, its not a bad price (although people outside of the us seem to get charged extra, im in NZ and it'd cost me a6nout $4 extra) and the fact that the atoms you get with it is more than what you'd buy for that price is a big bonus, and make it definitely worth it.
---
Without mod support, i dont feel like private servers are needed. When i was playing, it was very rear for somebody to come along and try to steal a location, or just to kill you. This isn't rdo or gta where there are plenty of people who think thats the aim of the game, the players are friendly like 90% of the time.
---
Finally, when you add FO1st to everything else Bethesda has done to FO76, and to there player base, i say fuck Bethesda, but i dont judge anyone who dose buy FO1st
---
&gt; Why do you think it’s good when it’s objectively not.
---
Why would I debate someone who clearly doesn't know what the word objective means?
---
No one is going to get banned for this. Please stop with the doom saying. As far as dupes go this one is fair benign compared to others. Unlimited steel and wood? Wow I can finally win at this game now!!!!!
---
For ammo lead is by far the bottleneck material not steel. Plenty of people have 50k-100k ammo. It’s really not that hard to come by and people use 5.56 as currency regularly since caps are worthless.
---
Same! I would've easily spent a few hundred atoms on the outfit. Nice to see some positive thoughts out of this. It's dumb that they blocked so many things from people that don't buy atoms, but for the atom buyers, this is a win in my opinion. even with the $13USD a month you still get a few hundred for free each month.
---
I relate to the anti social part. It's a shame that people on your friends list can join and you cant really get rid of them
---
You backwards thinkers make me laugh.
---
You are ONLY buying discounted Atoms, the tent, hermit server, &amp; outfit are the perks of sending BGS $15 a month. 
---
Good for people who buy Atoms regularly because they lack the ability or time to get Atoms thru Dailies,Weekly, &amp; Challenges.
---
Bad for people who don't and will never buy Atoms on principle alone, being we recognize value or when something was stripped from the game only to being used as bait to buy later on because of convenience or QoL.
---
To OP : The lights are only going to stay on for so long regardless of how many times you throw your wallet at BGS. Don't think that you have any control over when those lights go out, you are not a hero by giving your money away for nothing, stop acting like it.
---
So... I came here expecting either a picture of a dog posed with a controller in front of your game or a very poor photo edit over your game. What I got was a chance to eat crow while looking at GREAT pictures of your dog being the most wonderful of doggos. I think it was the one of the Capitol Building where his tongue is lolling out of the side of his mouth.
---
In summary, I'm wrong, and your dog is adorable.
---
I lose hope
---
For real. I've been getting into servers with people in the 200s, 300s, 400s, and 500s in terms of levels and they seem to just endlessly do SBQ runs which I love.
---
I like the look of the jacket by itself... I saw a player who had it on without helmet but I admit I was disappointed by the fact the eyes didn’t glow red... oh well still pretty cool!
---
I thought Flux and vault steel couldn't go into the stash box, am I just being dumb?
---
Im on xbox sadly
---
Fallout 4 deathclaws made me want to play
---
Awesome background story btw!
---
So that's the group. I was game chatting with someone the other day about a responder group. It's cool to hear that y'all are real.
---
All fair points and you definitely seem to be speaking from a position that actually understands RoI and publisher goals which is refreshing! 
---
It would definitely be a nice wishlist thing to see the next year bring with it competitions that let the fans decide. We know the mod community loves Bethesda. They need to just open atom shop concepts to the public like TF2 has done for YEARS.
---
They should have at least given us the option to host private servers ourselves though.
---
Meh, I might get it when wastelanders comes out. Depends on how much I'm playing then. 
---
The only message I really care to send the company is "this is worth the price to me" or "this isn't", tbh.
---
Look, I already apologized to ISIS for comparing them to Bethesda, no need to keep dragging this out.
---
I'm from the west virginian minutemen but heck we are people of peace... AD VICTORIUM AND GLORY TO THE WEST VIRGINIAN MINUTEMEN.
---
Hope to see you more on Appalachia.
---
I'm waiting for the next gen of GPUs before I think of upgrading, considering the 1070ti's cost me a fortune at the time, still not  bad gpu, but it does throttle on 4k. My internet connection isnt great either, in fact it sucks balls, but just this evening I've been playing one  private server and I've had 2 BSODs, for no apparent reason, nothing overclocked, all temps running fine and I've even been playing it with my SO for the entire weekend on public servers (we didn't leave the house) and although I had a couple of minor crashes, didn't have a BSOD. I'm blaming bethesda for that one...
---
No one buys steel and wood.
---
Definitely not! Quite the opposite actually. It’s about picking the right battles.
---
Thank you so much for the offer! Ive been able to farm back a good bit, the flux &amp; vault steel will come over time also. Its nothing I would stop playing for just feels bad at the time 😆🍻
---
I think everyone wanted it to have glowing eyes.
---
I did mean the light emitted by the pip boy, i should’ve been more specific “.
---
Well honestly private servers are not cheap so they probably should charge like.. 3.99? 4.99? For private server and all other stuff should be bought with plans or shop.
---
Maybe not NEED, but it was a very sweet thought. That one's a keeper!
---
1920x1080. It's a predator helios g3-571 laptop so unfortunately I'm stuck with the stock cooling system.
---
I think its totally worth it.
---
Yeah. I ended up getting the game pass promo for a few years, only thing that stinks about this for other consoles (PS4 and PC, which I have all 3) is this almost guarantees that the next games coming out from obsidian will be xbox exclusives. :/
---
Look up “Publisher Development Goals” and “RoI” and then reconstruct a better argument please.
---
What is your build?  Also curious, what are the two pieces of gear in particular stat wise?  
---
Perception is likely better because that increases the detection range of enemies, as well as impacting the VATs
---
INT could be good to keep at home since higher INT can help you get a higher repair on weapon (and supposedly increases scrap you get from scrapping things? I never saw that myself)
---
To add on to my point, Bethesda advertised fo76 as a multiplayer experience at launch, any talk of a singleplayer mode was shutdown as "it's only multiplayer". I would be more understanding of f1st if it was maybe advertised a while back as "we heard you wanted singleplayer, so we got rid of survival to make room for private servers" but instead they dropped an expensive, buggy subscription service out of the blue and baited people with a more convenient way to play the game.
---
I too would enjoy exploring Appalachia on my own and going through another fallout game on my own. It's just not the game I paid for. 
---
They basically pushed wastelanders back, *content we want*, in order to release f1st. Yes we may have asked for some of this content but it's locked behind a paywall. 
---
TL:DR - Bethesda gave us some content we wanted behind a paywall even though it goes back on a lot of their marketing.
---
I agree... it’s definitely cool but it also seems like going to a costume party with many wearing the same thing...lol
---
Ba-dam-tst
---
Haha, thanks.  Just for you, bonus DLC:  https://i.imgur.com/qi0ivBr.jpg
---
Location is definitely a huge, huge factor.
---
If you are playing a multiplayer game purely solo you are doing it wrong.
---
Definitely not need, but yes it's the thought that counts. Definitely a keeper.
---
I havent tested it since the update but it definitely went on that fateful day the bombs dropped 🙈
---
I thought this was a sex bragging story. I was gonna make a comment about you being a champ for 3 full minutes, but whatever.
---
Over 6 months now 😊
---
Exactly, thanks.
---
Watch me do the opposite, the rebel I am!
---
My pleasure.
---
Why was I down voted yet he gets up votes? All I was trying to say was that's funny and I agree like damn..
---
It’s more a general question but on this particular occasion it’s an unyielding weapon weight leg
---
Perception seems like the way to as I mostly use rifles
---
It should be simple, if not just message me again, I don't mind helping.
---
Yah and like I jokingly said in my post, I spend 50 a month to go to the gym 3-4 times a month. It’s a no brainer if you’re already spending money
---
&gt; Ave, true to Kaiser
---
I used that name for an album full of pics of him on FB, by the way.  Great minds...
---
Okay confused wording - I work with JWT tokens as well... the hidden value (key) to create the signature is based on transmitted info.
---
Yep. Which is why I rarely wear it. I use the emblem and outfit almost no one uses. Blue shirt and tan slacks and the old man emblem
---
Because it's not what they advertised to us.
---
Just to add a little context here, you typically are not able to prioritize in a way that strictly focuses your attention on one thing and only one thing at a time.
---
You're paying a team to work on multiple things they have the skills for, and pulling, for example, a tech artist to try and fix server stability isn't going to get you anywhere; your servers aren't going to get any better, and now your art is not getting the support it needs.
---
If you want to pull in more personnel you need to be able to justify the extra cost (i.e. you need to make more money). This is always an optimization problem, and different people are going to want some things more than others.
---
I don't even remember. I check in, see it's at 30/30, and move on. I should go through them, but it's more time than I want to spend.
---
They both can.
---
&gt;If you want to support the greedy business practices of many modern gaming companies sure do so. But you are helping in destroying something many people love
---
Seems I might have missed a point so I went back through all your comments and here is a summary of what I THINK you are saying.
---
You have concluded that the statement above is not considered Free Speech and therefore the poster had no right to make it because:
---
A) They are dictating your actions I.e. how you should spend your money.
---
B) without proof the comment is "reactionary opinion" (which in turn leads to (C))
---
C) it is passive aggressively coercing you to alter your actions i.e. how you spend your money
---
D) it is using implied subtle negative consequences to COERCE (best fit word so not taken literally) you into changing your spending habits.
---
Have I mischaracterized your position or taken anything out of context?
---
(Also please let me know if you consider anything I have said to be emotionally manipulative or coersive in any way. I stand by my earlier commitment to ensuring this is a safe space for you.)
---
No I don't. Because I don't want this to become a habit. I would be fine if the service existed after wastelanders, after we have a large content dump. But now is a poor time to release it after the delay of wasterlanders
---
I agree with everything, im not cap poor either but use the tent, as for the scrap box well lets just say it is great i have so much resources all on one character that it is great. Just in a matter of a few day i have accumulated almost 2k of everything and 15k of steel and wood. I havent even bothered making ammo because its easier to keep it as scrap til u need it. I got the year subscription and cant imagine how much i will have by then so crazy what a great feature.
---
Still working this one. I have all other tadpole and possum badges except the chemist one because of that stupid plan
---
Just saying, if enough FIFA players for example somehow find the strength in themselves to not purchase the latest version of the game for just one year, and publically state it's because of all the anti consumer microtransactions, you bet they can save their next game from being microtransaction hell.
---
The problem is convincing enough people to set aside their personal enjoyment from playing a game for the benefit of the franchise as a whole. Many people feel like, "Hey, I'm a working adult and can afford it, it's just some poor kids bitching cause they can't afford it. Who are they to decide what I can spend my money on?" 
---
They're kinda missing the big picture. Don't get me wrong, the people who get unreasonably angry at people who spend money on MTX are missing the big picture too. It's not about trying to control people's decisions, it's that the only way to change the industry for the better is through mass action, we have to vote with our wallets.
---
Sorry for the wall of text, I just feel many people who are against MTX are too antagonistic and give the wrong impression. OP did a great job of trying to calmly appeal to reason, hopefully some so called "whales" see this and realise it's not just anger for karma, and thay we need to work together if we want shitty MTX gone
---
The choice to not have paid DLCs was a direct result of having a *cosmetic only* shop that was supposed to make up for it, they then proceeded to make a half baked game that drove off a massive number of potential players, and then decided to overprice the absolute fuck out of FPS-banana tier skins, they could've adjusted pricing and opted to not make skins for content that most people won't ever use.
---
Also, the fallout IP, only appeal to a specific market? Give me a break, it's (was, after this game) one of the most known franchise, and a top seller among rpgs, if they expected this game to be a niche they wouldn't have opted for a cash shop as the leg to stand on for post release support. Then again maybe they did, if they legitimately thought this half baked product would have sold any more than a 6th of FO4 by virtue of having the name Fallout
---
It doesnt fail and all of what i said is valid. You just cant admit being wrong and thats fine
---
Hrmm that's not that far out of the way, but it could be a part of the equation for sure.
---
I think locating within a radius of Whitesprings isn't too bad either, people just end up there as well. Maybe this would apply to Purveyor but to a lesser extent, sometimes I'll see it constantly barraged with people other times its dead.
---
To Poster: cool call out bud. Was hard to understand though being a backwards thinker and all. Your logic just clearly is flawless and incomprehensible to the mentally insufficient such as myself.
---
That's awesome! Enjoy the outer worlds, it's a brilliant game.
---
Are you aware of Xbox Game sharing? 
---
If you set your son's Xbox as your "home xbox", and you set your Xbox as your son's "home Xbox" you'll both have access to each other's digital games.
---
With this, only one person needs to buy a copy of the games, and only one person needs Xbox Live Gold and it'll allow both people to play online the same way you do now.
---
The only downside to this is that if you're trying to play games while offline you won't have access to your own library, you'll only have access to the library on that "home xbox".

The way it all works, is that when you buy a game digitally, you basically get two licenses for the game.  One license is tied to your gamertag, and the other license is tied to your "home Xbox". So, if you buy the new Call of Duty game on your account. You'll have access to it on any Xbox you sign into, and anyone who signs in on your home Xbox will have access to it on that console.
---
I hope this makes sense, and I hope you find this helpful. You can save yourself a bunch of money on not buying two copies of games by using this feature :D.
---
My fav!
---
Kind of brings me back to the time prior to vendors. I now look at the map and no green tents littering the map. 
---
The one issue I have is: I launched my first nuke Saturday, on my private world. I did it this way so that I can take my time. I get all the way through, go to swipe my nuke card, error noise, swipe again, error noise. Mother %@&amp;#\^$, I left my nuke cards back at my stash. Oh well, go get it, swipe and launch. Launched on Whitesprings. Begin at the train station, circling counter clockwise towards the clubhouse. Every bloated is dead. I'm the only one on the server. Almost to the clubhouse and the game freezes. 
---
Yesterday, I launch another nuke, this time I had my nuke card, again all the bloated are dead on arrival. This time I log off and back on, now they are all there. I just do not want to have to go through that log on/off.
---
I don't think it's too difficult to figure out the server stuff, if you know what you're doing. You can basically just use some software like Wireshark or something and figure out how the network and database works. I guess.
---
Exactly, not even a server if you cant save your shit and let your friends play without you
---
Can we also stop pretending pvp is the only thing that defines p2w in a pve game
---
The side effects of swallowing the red pill. Unfortunately the only relief is to be plugged back in.
---
Very well said. Thanks again for the post and for bringing in some positive light. See you in the wasteland!
---
Yes, I think it's just a nomenclature thing. So given all this should I assume you're playing Fallout 76 at work and have access to an enterprise router? :p
---
The light will stay on as long as they are making a profit, which means they need people to spend money. 
---
The lack of understanding of how companies make money here is insane.
---
Yes, it *is*.
---
Italics means I win.
---
Might invest in that
---
Where did they confirm that?
---
I needed to quit it for the sake of my blood pressure! 😂
---
Great to hear!! Right now Im having a dilemma of do I download Outer Worlds right now or wait for Death Stranding 😩
---
Thank you for sharring your story btw! I could realy imagine listining n smile wile watching that unfold. I let my 3 year old nephew play my character sometime sitting in my lap, he like visiting all the members and there camps, telling them good morning lol. We realy are more then just some faction or game community. We are a support group 😊
---
No joke thoguh, every time I get a Legendary Walking Cane, the thought of doing a senior citizen melee build occurs to me.
---
Fallout the name is known. 76 is not a typical Fallout game in a lot of ways. You’ve also failed entirely to explain in any way how they could generate money TODAY. They can’t start charging for DLC after saying micro transactions would support them. 
---
I’m literally waiting for you to give me A SINGLE suggestion for them to make money off 76 given all the information we have today. “go back in time and do it different.” Will not be an accepted answer Captain Hindsight 👍
---
OK then. After 100s of hours. I love how you're okay to spend more on a free game with mtx than a game with initial cost and some mtx.
---
I love the rationalized hangups people have. Very irrational. Very human.
---
Pros - you can do anything you want, and noone will be there to stop you.  No worrying about workshops.  No worrying someone will come 1 shot all your legendary events.
---
Cons - its lonely.   This is it.  This is the only Con.
---
If the game was built more in the respect of an MMO rather than being Fallout w/ Multiplayer, then i'd agree to the subscription. Also if the 1st subscription didn't affect the game itself ( infinite scrap storage ).
---
Now that i'm thinking about it, it feels like they are taking a path like Runescape. Member only worlds and Non-Member worlds. Members get more of everything, plus exclusive content. But the takeaway there is Runescape is free to start with, and not a AAA title investment
---
Damn man, so sorry. If I ever lost all my scrap I'd just quit playing personally lmao I've been hoarding for ages
---
Yikes
---
As for legendaries so far with only 3 days of play on private server i am killing it in legendaries i feel like there are more and im not sure if that would be true, private servers are 8 player vs public which is 24 dont know if that plays a part.
---
Something akin to an outer world's online.
---
Or some other company creating a similar feel to that of fo76, with multiple players but without the seedy business practice of taking its loyal customers for a  ride and milking them for every penny in their pockets.
---
I'd be behind that idea, doubtful it'll happen tho
---
I got one month so I could get the emotes and the outfit. I was planning on spending 10 bucks on atoms for the Halloween stuff anyway, so why not get those extras? I haven't even played on my "private world." That aspect doesnt really interest me.  I'll cancel it after the first month. It was the mothman dance that got me.  It was a weak moment.
---
That's the most disappointing part of all of this to me. Since fo76 released I've wanted a persistent world that I can invite my friends into
---
If all you do is hope then they're NOT gonna change. You buying the pass is not helping them become great, it makes them think that these greedy practices are ok
---
Maybe try a fresh install? I had a bug where, on a clean install, I was falling through the world in random places and dying. No mods or anything. And I just downloaded it 3 days prior as the launcher used to randomly delete all the game files (it doesn't do this anymore). I searched around and saw that faulty .dll files will cause this. But the repair tool never caught and/or fixed it. So you can maybe try deleting the .dll files and repair and see if that works, since it will see if a file is missing apparently. If not try completely deleting it and install it again. Although if you have really slow internet, data caps, or whatever, that might not be an option. I'm on PC and never had this happen to me (and I use purified water) and it seems like there is at least 1 other that it has never happened to and you plus another that has experienced it. So it is likely something with the install or hardware incompatibilities. And if this doesn't work, I'm sorry for making you re-download it.
---
Con: From experience this weekend....Tried getting a friend the camera to do the bucket list, the 4 of us went to every known spawn location and it wasn't there. We left and went to public servers and it spawned on the first try. Maybe it was a bug, but just my experience so far.
---
Same. It makes me feel a bit better with all the free atoms
---
Oh look another YouTuber *yawn*
---
&gt; Workshops don't provide an advantage and are typically a terrible way to get resources. 
---
This is true on pbulic server. However on private one is bonus, because you can hold multiple workshops without anyone competing for them. 
---
&gt; Fast travel locations are everywhere and are very cheap. 
---
Which can be totally eliminated between your camp and the movable tent + workshops (see above)
---
&gt; Scrap box is unnecessary at all because you can easily have a surplus of scrap and plenty of room for weapons and armor in stash. 
---
But you have to mule when you collect more and/or start collecting regardless of your current collection of scrap. And with workshops you don't have to prioritize what to collect and what to leave behind. Also drop the tent, scrap all junk in the scrapbox and continue. While the non-paying player has to locate workbench and stash to do the same (while they are many on the map, travelling overencumbered is a tedious task).
---
&gt; You can always server hop for fresh locations. 
---
Or wait 15 minutes and go on your private server. There are people who still hund for the red assylum outfit.
---
&gt; Stop rationalizing and shift the means of P2w to whatever you want it to mean. 
---
I don't have it, it really means that there are advantages.
---
&gt; It gives no measurable advantage other than psychological ND that's a fact. 
---
There is a way to collect more bobbleheads/magazine/plans/outfits in a more efficient way and it's called "Private world" and this is a fact, not psychological, but digital one.
---
&gt; You still have an upper cap and daily cap limit. 
---
But you can sell your scrap, dirt cheap, because it's more accessible. Same goes for ammunition etc.
---
Oh look another downvoter, yawn.
---
Look nothing about this game has jumped up at me and said, Bethesda is really doing this community favors.
---
I mean what positives does this game have at this point. I would like to know from someone who actually enjoys this games what there is for you?
---
Fixing the core game issues and continuing to make cosmetic items for the cash shop rather than opening the floodgate for gameplay advantages, you know, things that might get players interested in giving it another shake rather than giving them a reason to uninstall for good.
---
Oh, maybe adjusting the prices for these FPS-banana tier skins, and make skins that affects weapons &amp; armor that people actually fucking use, of course the cosmetics won't sell if they perpetually release skins for a knife and a sawn off shotgun that nobody uses
---
Yeah I guess, compared to the absolute giants of the industry. But they are by no means small, compared to indy devs. Their size is entirely by their choice. Skyrim alone made $450 million in its first week. If their studio is so small, where is all the money going?
---
I have seen no evidence that Providence invested anywhere near a billion dollars. A few hundred thousand is all I can find. Where is this cited?
---
FO1st is the first content provided that required the use of "real world money", everything else can be acquired from the Atom Shop with in game currency, I know players that have nearly everything because they grind all the events to earn atoms daily. FO3, FONV, &amp; FO4 were all comparably priced (Considering inflation), and DLC content had to be purchased. This game is giving you all the DLC for free, then monetizing the Cosmetic and Convenience items. If Bethesda has no way to generate revenue off this game, it will be short lived, and I for one would like to be able to play FO76 for years, just like I have with all the other FO games, which is why I purchased the Subscription on 2 accounts.
---
[Hehe...](https://i.redd.it/2vckoe5g9bu21.jpg)
---
You're right, it's significantly better than trash like FO76 and they shouldn't be mentioned in the same sentence.
---
So do non-digital stores.
---
Block them and your life will be better for it.  There are some people that will never be happy no matter what you do.
---
I stopped doing that event if others show up
---
Trying not to kill enemies and standing around waiting for more enemies to show up because they get killed so fast is more frustrating than fun.
---
 Good event, not good when there are too many players
---
I play on a normal ps4 slim and it goes really good for me. Totally recommended
---
So... what they’ve done in the past that clearly wasn’t working well enough to pay for the undoubtedly incredibly expensive overhauls to the game that Wastelanders undoubtedly cost. 
---
Alright well, “go back and do it better” wasn’t an option so we’re still at a whopping “0” useful suggestions.
---
Ya haha im the exact same, I always hoard even the basic junk to team with low levels &amp; give their camps surprise makeovers 😄
---
You're basically paying for the atoms and everything else is free. That's the way I saw it anyway.
---
I agree cosmetic mods would go a long way in this game. They already have the creation club market set up for skyrim and fallout 4 it is surprising that they haven't opened the doors for modders to sell their products which both the modders and Bethesda can profit on. Then it could simply be a technical hurdle to make mods that everyone who hasnt downloaded can see(not sure how tf2 does it). Possibly resulting in a game file size that is just too big or server issues. Then again they could have high quality control measures to ensure that only a limited number of the best mods can be included.
---
The tent is the one thing I want the most.. but it would suck to not have the ability to move it without your subscription.
---
On the defense of the same people complaining, it was promised that Add on content would be free and that the atom shop items would be cosmetic only. That's the big reason for the complaints from what i understand.
---
Them adding features and advantages behind a subscription goes against what was advertised.
---
Yeah, I would go with perception then.
---
Comment underneath it on youtube and ill catch you if you made it into the first three who wanted to sign up (not just any random commenter)
---
That's a perfect way to look at it.
---
Unless you want to use the Chameleon mutation (for which you need the Weightless legendary property), your best bet for weight reduction is actually the Deep-Pocketed mod. It effectively makes all pieces but the chest have a negative value with respect to your total carry weight. Ultra-light works better if you want the AP bonus, though.
---
Thanks, comment under the video that you want to sign up and the first 3 submitters will make it into the next vid.
---
Thanks but please comment under the youtube video, i take note of commenters there ^^
---
after i posted it it went to 40% downvoted in like 5 minutes since you are so keen to know apparently.
---
What if Fallout 1st offered both the generous atom stipend and a full-featured private server (including an administrative options menu with staples like invite/kick, advance day/night, etc).  
---
What if the NCR Ranger skin was available to buy on the atom shop independent of the private server subscription?  
---
What if features that alter gameplay like the scrapbox and tent were implemented in the base game (with further cosmetic customization available on the atom shop) rather than put behind a paywall?
---
I agree i am up to only 15k right now after switching to melee build a week ago, wish i did this from the star.
---
I'd disagree on the pvp thing. Many mmos offer pay to win, or pay for HUGE advantage. An example would be say you get a really insanely good item, but you need to "enchant" it to make it godly. Enchants have a 50% chance to fail. Every time you enchant it successfully, you get +1 on the item which makes it much better each time, up to say 10 times. So your "really good item +1" is decent, but "really good item +10" is insane. Each time you enchant it to upgrade it, your item might either revert to the previous level, or a small chance to break completely. Maybe you get lucky and get +10 within 10-15 enchants. Thats optimal. Even getting the materials for those enchants is a huge time sink though. The above example is fine, if that's what you're into, however, most games that have those kinds of systems offer "enchant protection" that will guarantee that your item won't break when upgrading it, and it costs real money. Some offer straight up "enchants always succeed for X number of enchants" consumables in the cash shop. 
---
You want to be the best, and you want to have the best - that's what this game is all about. It's all PvE, but believe it or not, PvE players can be just as competitive as PvP. the example above is cleary pay to win, or pay for huge advantage. They made a problem and they are selling the solution. Sure, you can take your chances... but maybe it took you a month to farm that item. Do you really want to risk having it disappear, even if it's only a 5% chance?
---
Just gotta be careful going to the water park if you go through Grafton. You get the monster and the kill the protestor events.
---
That will come with a 5 dollar day pass with snow. I confirmed that through a source I have inside Bethesda
---
You are completely missing the point. I'm fine with them wanting to monetize, I never said I wasn't. I'm against how they choose to do it.
---
[In an ideal world, this is how I think it should have gone.](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/do6yoc/all_the_changes_from_falloutfirst_should_have/f5kdmaj?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share)

There's a week and a half until DS and TOW is only 25 hours or so, I say go to it! :-)
---
Let's see playing the fallout world with friends interesting world cool emotes camp building among other things.
---
What about luck charisma luck and agility what do they do?
---
Reserve my spot as the third, please! 😝
---
Way to exaggerate what I said. Nobody has claimed perfect bug free sessions. But performance wise this update will stand on it's own. Paying or not everyone benefits from mass amounts of players running vault raids, whitesprings, and workshops in private worlds not to mention scrap are in scrapboxes now and not in our stash.
---
They also take the same cut if not more, retail products are sold for a profit of up to 300%.
---
When, what system?  I had a total douche on area chat this weekend.  Kept it up back at whitespring station running his mouth too.  It was great because he announced how shitty he was from the jump so when he glassed cannoned no one would heal him.  He bitched about that too.  First time Ive ever blocked someone on xbl.
---
I imagine the best solution is already implemented tbh. If they let them offers even make 10% off each sale, people will buy them instead of modding them only because you can’t even touch Nuclear Winter with mods enabled. If people want costume mods, the atom shop having the same item as the nexus wont make them not buy it. Adding community atom shop items, even if they just ran a monthly competition and picked the top 3 or something that we voted on, throw a free player icon for voting to get participation up, they would make a ton of great steps towards that old community engagement that people used to love from Bethesda.
---
Are you trolling or purposely ignoring the part where they perpetually sell cosmetics for content that people don't use? The part where they still haven't fixed core game issues?
---
They had a full year to adjust, and now that they went ahead and full on decided to make you pay to circumvent what they refused to fix you're seriously just gonna be there and say "welp they did it so I guess I'll pay now" ? The fuck kind of thinking is that?
---
OBviousLY that player was WINNINGGGGGGG the gaMMMMe.
---
ARK, Rust, Day Z, 7 Days to Die, Conan Exiles...
---
Just search "multiplayer survival games"
---
Flares need legendary effects and mods too. There needs to be different flares/mods for different events or purposes. Calling cargo bots, vertibots to help you, or starting events. This system could be huge if they put some time into it.
---
I play on the PS4 slim with a hard copy and have since launch, I have hardly had any of the issues folks complain about this entire time. You can count on one hand the number of times it has lagged or crashed on me.
---
WOW REALLY?!!? THE FRIDGE DOESN'T AFFECT OTHERS GAMEPLAY?!?!
---
HOLY TODD'S UNDERWEAR BATMAN!
---
Ps: What a legend man 😂
---
Ur right for railway rifles but for regular bullets u still need lead, cloth and acid so a bit more to it then steel = unlimited ammo.
---
No reservations, comment under the video and hope for the best :P
---
It doesn't help that the guy that sniped the falloutfirst domain hasn't played in 8 months. Like dude you don't like this game. We get it. Now go away.
---
I have. ;)
---
I’ve only made one ticket and got a response and solution in one day (next day)
---
Alright, but how many atoms am I getting to make that feel like a bargain?
---
Agree to disagree. It puts you in a position to obtain better gear and items much faster than non-subs, therefore giving you a competitive advantage albeit still subject to RNG drops. It doesn't have to be a direct damage or armor boost. Being able to solo a nuked WS for example, and trigger respawns by yourself over and over is a massive advantage, especially once they add the legendary player feature where you get extra perks for being high level. XP will be tied to power at that point, and being able to farm XP faster than non-subs will be a direct advantage, not just a convenience.
---
You have a damn good point there! 😁
---
Gotta support Obsidian, my TOW download is at 3 hours now 😅🙏🏻
---
I’ll play it everyday the rest of this week in honor of you.
---
Pfsense gateway - ssl packet capture - although not the initial route I took to get FO packets ;-)
---
What is vault steel?
---
I don't know what the point is you're trying to make.  Stores take a cut of the thing they sell.  So?!
---
Nah, because a lot of game state is being calculated + maintained by the server. You'd need the server software, which would be non-trivial (to say the least) to reproduce. You'd also need to modify the client to connect to a different server.
---
In order:
---
I’d still buy it 100% because I was already on board when I heard the atoms before I knew the other bonuses. 
---
The NCR ranger would be right at home costing what the Starlet Sniper or Nuka Girl outfits cost and I don’t see any reason they’d have to be some badge of pride for Firsters (I’m not that important that my subscription makes me cooler than other people that want the badass outfit imo). 
---
Between you, me, and everyone that reads this, Is give up the tent and scrapper in a heartbeat if they told me I could unlock them through an expansion on the Pioneer Scouts Questline because I had fun with those challenges and quests. Let everyone have a second tent, that’s what being a scout is about, ruffing it in the wild!
---
Yup. Even flag yourself for pvp battles or advertisements for your vendor.
---
Upvoted.
---
It has the same things that fallout 3 and 4 had, minus the unlimited stash, and with the occasional asshole (though I personally rarely ever see those).  And you get an occasional temporary companion to run around with if that's what you want (and the AI is highly improved, for the most part).
---
I couldn't care less about the microtransactions, and I think the majority of the players feel the same way.  Except when they affect gameplay, which is why the fo1st thing is a thing, and that's kinda split down the middle (for very lenient definitions of 'middle').
---
It's broken, just like 3 and 4 were, and it's a bit on the slower side to get fixed, but not that much.  But it has the same appeal, and at least as much of the same charm, that older fallouts did.
---
Plus, Preston Garvey isn't in your ear every 5 minutes talking about some stupid settlers who can't get their shit together, so we have that going for us.
---
What's the point of that comment? Who cares if they were or were not?
---
While i agree that would be really cool....lets get everything running smoothly first. As long as they have a few more events (like the Halloween one coming up) or another "clean Appalachia" ill be happy
---
And quit it with bloody Tea Time
---
Supporting this makes you an asshole.  If bethesda doesnt unfuck themselves I will miss out on future Fallouts and Elder Scrolls 6, which blows.
---
I don't care that much that they're charging a subscription for some premium features, but I'd pinned most of my hopes for this game on private servers, and their implementation doesn't solve any of the problems I'd hoped they would. That's my main frustration with it.
---
&lt;33333333
---
About you, I understand that you have been in love with the outfit, so I can see why you fall for it and pay at least for a month. Most people who buy cosmetics would, if they saw the one and only love for sale. But after you get the outfit I would stop supporting this if I were you, as it can do more harm than good.
---
While I really enjoyed Fallout 76, and I wanted to support it and to go further, I can't see the good in supporting it if it goes down this way. If most of the content added goes behind a paywall it's not "supporting" the game you love, is spending 7 bucks on a fridge, 100 to play all year without getting bored of being overweight because you can't just put up a tent without ruinning your Camp or running out of scrap because you stopped gathering it as your Stash was full. And then pay again every month. It's like an addiction.
---
That's no support. That's pay to enjoy, pay to avoid annoying mechanics like a free to play mobile game, which I don't want for Fallout 76. If there are performance limits that stop me from storing scrap or having more than one Camp, it's sad but I can take it. If you don't allow me because you just WANT MORE MONEY, it's not right and you don't deserve that money.
---
I barely supported it before because I didn't enjoy the state the game was released amongst other things, but it seemed to get better for a while, and after that they just kept asking for money. So much stuff they do just seems greedy, while a lot of their updates just don't deliver. Why is Camp content from Wastelanders visible but still not available? Why are they so stingy with rare drops and put most content on the Atom Shop, for example in Meat Week?
---
Then they remove Survival instead of fixing it, they delay Wastelanders while the last update, a raid, is barely playable and brings no new enemies and no matchmaking. And they just. Keep. Asking for money. Collector bots were even in the guide, they were not going to be Atom Shop exclusive, and the fridge was a suggestion they monetized. 
---
It hasn't even been a year. The game isn't even in good shape between raid performance, server disconnects, and stuff like damage not registering. 
---
I won't pay for stuff that should be in the game, and I don't pay people who have lied to me. They don't deserve my money. Whales can have a field day though, let's see what happens next.
---
Have you played the game? Honest question. 
---
For me, the game is still fun. My buddy and I log in together, group up, go hunting super mutants, take over workshops and defend them from other players and mobs, and we build awesome little camps.   We travel to other people's camps to see how they had them built, try to make some friends, sometimes make enemies.  Sometimes I even get into character as the Plague Doctor I dress up as and try to push calmex on everyone.  
---
Even the NW battle royale mode is fun.  You have a quick burst at the start, but gives a very different perspective to the world. 
---
Even a year later there is still things I haven't 100% completed, I have builds I can work on, new events come out (like halloween event tomorrow and meat week a couple of months back).  I might be more casual than other players, but at $60 paying full price when the game originally came out I have gotten my value out of the game.  
---
Yes, I think that they should give the scrapbox to everyone, and I think the tent should be modified and made available to everyone, we knew the server was going to cost money last august (though most people missed that since it wasn't reported on like the rest of the news). Yes, the fridge and scrapbot have utility beyond cosmetics. 
---
This game, as an open world, survival game, in the fallout universe gives me an experience I haven't been able to recreate elsewhere.
---
This is why I play Fallout 76. This is why I pay no attention to the trolls, or bullies, and why I don't care about the bugs. This beautiful, pure interaction is why I absolutely love this game.
---
I don't agree.  People should realize a game world is more often than not, finite, and not infinite.  The developers having courtesy to tell me I can't go forward is perfectly fine and I don't think there's anything particularly 'immersing' about trying to hide that barrier with physical barriers like New Vegas does (which are really the absolute worst as far as aggressive invisible walls disguised as hills go), or games that just outright try to kill you for leaving (GTA V).
---
I like it. Got the world to my self. No longer have to worry about scrap. The tent is pretty cool. And the monthly Atoms make up for the price. Add to that the further bonuses like the armor and other stuff we'll be getting (as they state and is obvious to keep us subscribing) and I'm rather satisfied.
---
Lol I'm honestly glad to hear there are some positives to this game. All I've heard so far is negative news on this game.
---
I think next week we will have a video on some of the positives of Fallout 76 if we get enough positives in this discussion. 
---
So what is there in  this game for people who want to play solo?
---
Yeah then someone joins half way through and hey presto, a complete respawn of all the robots when you're trying to keep your friendly animals alive
---
PSA: I'll buy what I damn well please. Fucks given cost $13 a month.
---
If you don't mind the rads
---
Ultimately the point here is 90% of these youtubers have not played the game they are all regurgitating the same BS and dont have an ounce of game experience. Its really annoying how most of you have taken to youtube and talk about fallout 76 but only did so after this ordeal have not said anything in close to a year but all of a sudden have things to say. Seriousy its whats wrong with youtube and the mentality of the average youtuber. If you dont play the game you shouldnt comment. People actual like/liked this game and BSG ruined it for a lot of people you guys are just throwing salt on wounds and its not ok nor appreciated.

NightinGery#8190 on discord

Can't argue with that. But at this point, I've bought a $60 license and shelled out for at least as much in atoms. It's a little inappropriate to ask for more at the moment.
---
That certainly is your opinion lol

The same thing happened to my girlfriend when she tried to make her first character. It took her so long to hash out the appearance we had to leave as soon as she finished.

No. This was clearly about a specific exploit where the PvP player couldn't be killed.   I was too late in the conversation to hear the method being used.  It might be something that is relatively new that isn't widespread yet.

No definitely not

Is it like the Red Dead Redemption 2 of the Fallout Series then? I hate anything not disclosed during launch that's going to cost extra money later on.
---
It sounds like there's some good gameplay to be had in there.

ALL OF THE NEWS I had heard has given this game such a negative connotation and the thought of a subscription service left an even nastier taste in my mouth, I had the game for like all of a week and shipped it back to GameStop because at the time the game wasn't complete and I've had a hard time ever picking it back up.
---
Yeah I will look at them today and get back to you... but all of my team has been having the same issue with their guns breaking as well
---
The comment I replied to was saying that Bethesda is getting 13.22USD after just accounting for sales tax, when the number that Bethesda returns would be much lower, not to mention the price it costs them to rent out the server.
---
Private servers have existed for a long ass time as a charge fee bro. Honestly, you are more energy than you’re worth. You clearly have no practical business knowledge and just sound ignorant screaming about “THEY COULD HAVE DONE IT BETTER BY DOING STUFF”. I’m muting this conversation haha.
---
* Charisma - you earn more caps when you complete quests and you get better prices when you sell/buy from robo-vendors.  I don't know if wearing CHA gear also lets you share higher level perks (normally need 3 CHA per 1\* on a perk card)
---
* Agility - the thing I know most about AGI is that it gives you more AP in vats.  
---
* Luck - increases the rate that your crit bar fills, and I think it improves the durability on found gear.
---
I did, maybe Scorchy was just confused. Usually/when lucky they land within the first minute of the fight.
---
Another SB's behavior was weird too: 3 landings &amp; takeoffs in like 15s while having an argument with Sheepy.
---
Adventure mode for me seems to be pretty much single player, fewer and fewer players and very few *single number* vendor icons. I'm just enjoying the space.
---
Yikes,
---
I have done several re-installs because the launcher was being shitty on update and telling me I didn't have enough disk space when I clearly did (At least I have since fixed that). I'll try the .dlls, but they SHOULD have been removed when I did my full reinstalls. And the way I see it, if it is a hardware compatibility problem which can't just be fixed with updates and software adjustments, I am not buying an expensive new part for a single game and bug when it is the job of the Devs to cover reasonable hardware compatibility (I don't have decade-old out-of-date or uncommon hardware.). This is a common and widespread issue, so it should be dealt with via a patch. I was just hoping to bring renewed attention to this problem or find an easy temporary third-party fix, not tear my system apart trying to solve a hiccup that's most likely a game code issue.
---
Yeah.
---
Well you've convinced me. I'm gonna try it again after dumping my copy of the game about 6-8 months ago. 
---
I just can't imagine paying a subscription to this game after the experience I had with it.
---
It is Freedom of Speech. However, they are attempting to coerce someone into an action based upon the negative consequences of ‘peer pressure’ and an emotional appeal, even though such an approach is unlikely to cause that change. 
---
If I ever indicated that having and voicing an opinion wasn’t a protected right under Freedom of Speech, that wasn’t my in the nation and it was either an error/typo of said too hastily. 
---
However, if an accusation is made and cannot be proven to be true, that would fall under libel/slander, which is *not* protected under the First Amendment.  This is why it is important to choose words carefully (which I have not always done, in all honesty) to remain firmly on the side of ‘opinion’ versus ‘claimant facts’. Same idea as why there is an editorial section in most newspapers, the separate news from opinion. 
---
The lines become blurry in debate, especially online debates where time and context can be challenging, and responses are sometimes submitted in haste. 
---
Is it Free Speech?  Yes. Is it passive aggressive and misplaced?  Absolutely.
---
"At the end of the day, people like being paid wages for the work they do  and Bethesda does this crazy program where they need to pay their  employees these wages for the work they do."
---
Tell that to Bethesda, they're the ones who promised free content updates to get everyone to buy the troubled game at launch. xD
---
Also, while people do need to be paid, you have to consider that there are other companies out there-- smaller, less worldly companies than Bethesda-- that are able to produce fine online games without nickel and diming players or triple-dipping. Path of Exile is a great F2P game that has non-invasive cosmetics and so they have no need to lie or bait and switch on players.
---
DOTA is another online game with regular updates that doesn't follow your stated practice of 'minimally harming' their game. 
---
I've also heard good things about Warframe, another game that updates regularly and is F2P and doesn't self-harm.
---
I'm sure there are many more examples than these if you go check out Steam or some other games library.
---
So in the end, I just don't understand why some of you have to cling to this banal argument that 'devs need money', when yea, we ALL GET IT, it's super obvious they need to make money, but that isn't in itself a justification of HOW they are making money. Know what I mean? 
---
If Bethesda hadn't pulled the bait and switch for cosmetics, if they had produce a more polished game, if they hadn't delayed or fumbled content updates for the last 4-5 months, if they hadn't put better performing servers behind a paywall, if they hadn't charged box price + cash shop + sub... if they hadn't screwed up in countless ways, then we wouldn't be having this conversation. Bethesda needs to up their game and start acting like a self-respecting, consumer respecting triple A studio again, instead of delivering faulty products that they then try to monetize more than many F2P games.
---
All that said, yea, enjoy the game you want to pay for. Just be ready for resistance when you try to decontextualize what Bethesda is doing here. :P
---
While I agree with you making an entire character for private servers would be a pain &amp; make most people not interested in them at all. IF mods are ever released they clearly won’t be game changing. Texture packs, Gun skins MAYBE. It’s not like we’re gonna have access to dev room mods from F4 or something.
---
Adventure mode is like staying in class when there's a in school football/volleybally/etc game that you have to pary 5 bucks to go to. You dont have to go but it would be interesting to.
---
Yeah, it is likely a bug, but I was hoping that it was a bad install or something so you can fix it.
---
I love walking around with the 1st icon telling them to buy it
---
I  look for Agi or Endurance for stats on armor. 
---
I run unyeilding so the Str isnt important for me as a rileman build.  I can get far more out of Endurance (doesnt get buffed with unyeilding), or Agility (for more Vats/AP/Sneak)
---
Between Int and Per, I would choose Per.  But thats my personal preference. 
---
It really depends on your build and what you are trying to do.  Some people will look for Str (melees) some people look for Per or Agi (rifles), some people look for Endurance (they want more HP) ect.
---
Same thought.
---
Or junk just should be weightless 🤯
---
Maybe they will add this to fallout 1st!  For an extra 5 bucks a month you can initiate Project paradise, Free Range, and campfire Tales!
---
Yeah but like I said, if you know what you're doing, relatively, it shouldn't be too difficult. They have done it with a bunch of games before, like WoW, Star Wars Galaxies, and others. The connecting to a different server part is probably the easiest thing to do. I have read a little about it and have an interest in it, but I'm not experienced enough. I mean you can google "How to reverse engineer multiplayer server" or something and there is a lot of stuff. It wouldn't be EASY but if you know what you are doing I'm sure it wouldn't be too difficult. I have a basic idea how it would be done, but just lack some expertise.
---
I haven’t received a badge in at least a month from that event.
---
I love the additions.
---
you can buy the plan from Grahm or that's where i brought it at least
---
Thanks OP, I agree with everything here.
---
Thanks mate! I'm glad you agree! I hope someone at bethesda would see this thread and accommodate but I doubt that'll happen.
---
Stable Flux definitely goes in the scrapbox, I’m not sure about vault steel.  I lost thousands and thousands of junk in mine after I moved the junk from 13 characters into one scrapbox.
---
Anyone can argue that anything is "vague and subjective" that does not make it true.   
---
Being able to store infinite scrap and then carry it over from private servers to public is an advantage over those who can't.   
---
Having 3 free fast travel locations (one of these being free to place) is better than having 2.  
---
Having extra stash space freed up by scrap that is now stored elsewhere is an advantage.   
---
You could argue how big/little of an advantage it is or even how the advantage is actually detrimental to the game, but it is in fact an advantage.
---
Loot from the vault raid.
---
Bloodied power armor build, b25 gat plas and about 7ish minutes of continuous fire
---
I bought the game knowing it was the first fallout game by bathesda Austin formerly battlecry studios. So I expected it to have some bugs and glitches and I am fine with fallout first because In my opinion it is not pay to win.
---
&gt;Maintenance for a server isn’t free.
---
A *local* server, is a server run locally.  ie, by the player.  It costs Bethesda nothing whatsoever.
---
i also notice it sounds like your trying to pull answers out so you make more videos to further push your views. Seriously just move on you clearly have not played not once and if you knew anything most people who purchased enjoyed the game period bugs and all, if i was to even take a view of your channel which i wont because i dont support leeches i would notice a common theme and prob see a vid about atlas or anthemand you prob dont own either. just move on seriously its lame and all of you should just be ashamed your all a bunch of leechers and followers that dont have a unique idea or thought among all of you put together.
---
Having camo skins is an advantage, must be p2w
---
And I'm asking them to elaborate because of how subjective it is. And anyone can argue anything, it doesn't mean it's argued intelligently, or we'll reasoned.
---
I’m finding it hard to get to everyone’s comments so I’ll address the most glaring part of your argument as the rest has more or less been covered in other comments. 
---
You cites Path of Exile, Warframe, and DotA. Fallout 76 is literally none of these games as far as gameplay goes and their target demographics are MASSSSSSSSSSSIVELY different than the average 76 player. People that play DotA are ridiculously massive in number (DotA crushes Fallout any day of the week as far as DAU goes), Warframe is an FPS focused on PvP, and Path of Exile is a Diablo “Clone” if I’m not mistaken. 
---
The only successful “survival” game out there really is Minecraft if you wanted to use a “parallel” to the same genre Fallout 76 falls into and that is obviously still a massively different demographic.
---
I definitely agree here. I do, however, feel that the timing was....poor. I'm a big Bethesda fan, having started playing their games back with Morrowind (to be fair, I was still in Middle School when that came out, hadn't heard of any of the previous ones), but this still felt a bit on the nose. I've said it before in multiple threads, and I'll keep saying it. If they had released the PTS instead of this, or even alongside this, so that players could start helping them work on Wastelanders along with helping add in more revenue to keep the lights on at the studio, then I would have had less conflict with it. I mean, sure, I bought the year long First subscription for many of the reasons you even stated. 15 bucks of Atoms every months for practically 8 bucks a month, some cosmetic goodies, a server away from people picking at me and my friends, and the scrap space.
---
All in all, I feel most of the backlash that's being seen right now is a set of poor decisions on the timing of things, and a lack of substantial showings of goodwill from Bethesda to back them up. Heck, the fact that they didn't say anything about the subscription until the day of kinda burned as well considering they said that they'd give more info in the coming days. I know many felt that they had meant they'd tell us about it before releasing it. But either way, what's done is done. The cat is out of the proverbial bag at this point, and to take away what's there wouldn't be fair to those of us who paid into it. I wouldn't mind, at all, if the Ranger outfit and scrap box were put in as things that were purchasable with Atoms rather than just tied to the subscription, because I feel that'd be significantly more fair to the playerbase than what's there now. I had told multiple friends of mine that if the subscription for the server was between 10 and 15 dollars a month, I'd hop on it because that's about what I was paying for the Minecraft realms, and I knew I'd get a bit more out of the Fallout servers than I do my Minecraft servers. (No offense to Minecraft, but I just like my nuclear wasteland a bit better than it.)
---
tl;dr: The main issue with 1st was timing and lack of communication leading to it. Removing it now isn't a good idea, but spreading the benefits out into the atom store would be, as long as the private servers stay behind the subscription.
---
Objectively, not objective.
---
I think that was a BS response by someone at Bethesda.  I have yet to get a real answer from my ticket other than that they are aware there is an issue.
---
Raising the bar really high there! 😁
---
My stash went from 800/800 to 600 something/800 because of the bobbleheads and magazine change. Saw no need for the scrap box. Tent seemed kinda cool since I live near Grafton but realized I'm always bumping up against cap limit so what's a few extra caps to fast travel. The Atom drop looked like a good value but because of a few bundle purchases, camp budget maxed, Challenges, no cool BOS stuff, don't need more Atoms. And I like playing with other players in the world especially for vending and SBQ battles. So no FO1st for me but I see the attraction for others.
---
Nice to see someone else actually realized you still don't have to pay for this and make a rational decision like an adult and not completely lose their sh*t.
---
I’ve already said it but male flares highlight dead bodies and/or give the firing player berry mentats effect for shorter time than the actual chem. 
---
But using them to call for assistance is good.
---
They confirmed it in several media outlets.  Even Forbes covered it.
---
True. But it’s not the only game coming out in Q1 that they need to compete with.
---
I mostly craft chems to make money so I don't really mind. I guess I never noticed rads might be a problem in that area.
---
&gt;couldn't
---
What he means is, they *weren't willing* to design the game with it in mind, or pay the development costs to cope with it now.  There is simply no arguing it: it is absolutely, undeniably possible.  They just chose to create a game where it isn't an option.
---
Endurance on armor doesn’t give you more HP :( Sadly.. it’s a bug.
---
Really? Did not know! Dead bodies as in dead ghouls and stuff or player bags?
---
All you just said doesn't apply to anyone who doesn't recognize the value in netflix, hulu, spotify, or amazon prime. Really it just shows you value and more watching tv and listening to music than playing fo76. Of course you wouldn't value fo1st.......
---
Same I’ll TP out if some pinhead shows up with friends all decked out with TSE and take over. A few events I’ve been to the people there first would spawn their PA to block the doors so no one could participate
---
&gt; Edit: also, make the Nuclear Winter mode free to play and change its content (maps, rewards) way more often, that will help enormously with both selling cosmetics and have actual matches and not 20 people rounds every time.
---
I assume you mean that people could play NW without actually buying FO76, but would those people just not be able to use perk cards at all? because that would be a real turn off.  or would they just be given 50 SPECIAL points to distribute as they want? because that would mean actual advantage for free people over regular players on a character under level 50....
---
They likely wouldn't have charged $60 for it if it was an expansion/DLC. I think that alone would've made a huge difference.
---
This might be a perk of Fallout 1st.
---
(≖︿≖ )
---
A lot of times when private servers of commercial games exist, it's because the server software got leaked at some point (which is also why they're often based on years old versions of the games). Reverse engineering the server is possible by analyzing packets, but studios take measures to make it more difficult by obfuscating the data, and even once you've deciphered all that, you still have to write a whole multiplayer game back end from scratch. People who have the skill to do this can make *a lot* of money in the job market, which further limits the pool of people who are actually willing to spend the time on something that not only won't make them any money but could actually get them sued.
---
I haven't followed Red Dead Redemption 2 news myself, since I'm not into westerns (unless it involves Robots as in Westworld), so maybe?  At least with the private worlds only the "host" has to be a subscriber, you don't get to use the other perks, but non-subscribers with subscriber friends can benefit from worlds that are quieter. 
---
And I think there is good gameplay, I'm not going to say it was flawless. I don't think there's been a Bethesda game that has been flawless. Even New Vegas had a tons of bugs when it was first released (there's a video out of there of the Doc in the beginning with his head spinning all around)
---
I didn't experience some of the bugs that others had at launch, it seemed (and still does) seem to be worse on PC than on PS4 (don't know anyone personally who plays Xbone).   There are elements that clearly are misses - Hunters/Hunted is a feature that's been in the game since the start. I have yet to see anyone doing it since beta. 
---
I kinda get the original design, it felt incomplete because the players were supposed to be each others content (Think of Minecraft.  Yes you have an end goal and an ending, but there isn't any real structure to the game. But if you join a server with others the dynamic can change as you have trading, PVP, house building etc.).  The design didn't think we needed raiders, because they thought players would pick up the reigns and be radiers against each other, and others would be the responders, and others would be the BOS, etc.  
---
Unfortunately, it didn't roll out that way.  Griefers would harrass players, some players didn't want any other player interaction, Slap damage was removed.  Not enough people had mics and/or didn't want to roleplay.  
---
It's a shame too, the game had and still has a lot of potential.  I play a lot of various survival games like 7 days to die, minecraft, etc.  This game, to me, is far more interesting and has more content than games like those, it's just being compared to other roleplaying games over survival games.
---
I love the comparison lol
---
Awesome! Thank you!
---
Meat piles, robot piles, bodies if it’s dead the flare should make it glow. And no player bags or whatever shouldn’t be included. Unless the player manually drops it.
---
nah, they just need to *actually make content*
---
the vast majority of whats in the atomic shop is just copy pasted from fallout 4.  some of it they didnt even bother altering at all
---
Good stuff... you would have had to install a cert Pfsense generated in that case... does fo76 use the windows keystore? Or did you work it into the client keystore some how?
---
&gt;All I've heard so far is negative news on this game.
---
I hate to say this, given the post, but it needs to be said...don't get all your information from YouTube.  (hence the initial dislike for the post)
---
Fallout has been a huge franchise *based* on single player activities.  It's had a few growing pains being turned into a multiplayer game, but by and large the things you did in the other fallout games, you can still do in 76.  Go out gathering, crafting, build and decorate your base (there's a whole sub-culture revolving around cool base builds).  Level up, upgrade your stuff, kill the various things that need killing.  Explore...gods, there's so much to explore, so many little corners with interesting stories.  Everywhere you look, there's a camp, or a terminal entry, or a jumble of corpses that tell you a little tale if you stop to look.  The number of out of the way locations with teddy bears, of all things, posed in some interesting, funny, or sad way is ridiculous.
---
The stories aren't presented in quests, like the old fallouts though, they're through the terminal entries, notes left behind, or the previously mentioned locations.  Some of the stories run so deep that most people will never piece them together (though the community as a whole seems to be able to ferret out *lots* of details).
---
Things do get a little stagnant after a while, I'm at the point where I'm looking for things to do - after ~800 hours.  Almost all solo, by the way.  For the price of entry, I think that's not a bad deal all things considered.  Sure, it has a few rough edges, and plenty of room to improve and grow, but that one number should tell you how much the game has to offer, if nothing else does.
---
Well yes, subscriptions are entirely different from pay to win. The news of Fallout First caught me entirely off guard though.
---
Sick, thx for info!
---
Not according to Todd Howard at E3.
---
Reasonable reasons
---
1) you want the outfit. The vast majority of atom store outfits are ugly gutter shit people wouldn't wear if it was FREE. Bethesda needs to have a serious the conversation with the people who designed outfits for this game. The riot ranger outfit is cool, its fallout, i get it and if it was on the store for the same price there'd be no difference really.
---
2) you want a place where you and your friends can play together unmolested. Thats a fine reason, but the servers arent servers, they are just instances that are often pre used. You arent getting your moneys worth and Bethesda is being lazy as fuck.
---
It is literally unbelieve. I have them all and I think I have scrapped about 5000 of them. The last mod took 500+ scraps. At the costs of 10000 screws, circuits, nuclear, steel, wood and spring. When I got the last one I celebrated.
---
It’s an idea. Not something in game.
---
Yeah I can say I've never had this issue myself. This is the first time I've read about it. That's why I asked so many questions
---
Good points and suggestions!
---
I think a LOT of us First-ers wouldn’t really blink if they removed the scrap bin and tent in like month 2/3/4/etc. from the subscription, gave it to everyone that paid ahead of time for free, then just threw them in the store for similar prices to scrap collector/fridge. 
---
I don’t think really anyone EXPECTED to get these things when we hoped for private servers, they just wound up in the bundle like a weird little bonus we never asked for haha. They also talked about overhauling the atom gain system to make it easier to get them for players so it’s one of those “pay for time” instead of “pay for item” which people seem upset about right now.
---
I'm jealous that you're hitting that cap limit lol I usually float around 1000-3000 cause I'm always buying up ammo that costs a cap. I've seen a lot of players with the subscription on xbox so it seems like FO1st is here to stay. As much as that pisses a lot of people off.
---
That will be part of a new paid flair subscription service. We are still working out pricing.
---
That's not our channel at all. We actually have more positive views than negative ones. We've mostly avoided anthem and we have not covered Atlas.
---
Yeah but there are plenty of people with an interest in it. And anyone can put it on a torrent site anonymously.
---
The blueprint system is pretty restrictive. After so much "budget" on the blueprinting has been used it will just stop adding stuff to it.
---
Generally when it auto-blueprints the stuff will all be there though. I may be misunderstanding. The auto-blueprinted items show up under one icon on the Stored tab and can be "scrapped" returning everything to its individual listing. 
---
Only thing I've found to get the blueprint system to work well is to keep things small and bare and very modular. Generator room, workshop, vendors, house. That kind of thing.
---
Changed the public key in the FO client executable so it would talk to my own app. Doesn't use the keystore - only does public key validation, and only [api.bethesda.net](https://api.bethesda.net) is validated from what I've seen so far.
---
You are part of the problem
---
Lol, I misread, have my upvotes anyway lmao
---
FO4 with a multiplayer mod is better. FO76 is a cash grab with fallout paint.
---
&gt;every detail is built towards addiction, like the sound and visuals from leveling up, the rewards, the amount of grinding necessary, and the fact that it's online and you can constantly compare your progress with your environment.
---
You essentially just described pretty much any game, these are parts of the game that make the game fun, as you said it causes dopamine kicks, you're seeing this as the primary target when in reality addictiveness is a byproduct of games, addictiveness at the forefront would be something like those mobile games where you spend cash to instantly finish your building for example, less quality, more addiction, more profit, but if you've ever played classic you'd know that was definitely not their primary goal.
---
&gt;Did I really build a strawman out of interpreting these rethorical  questions as you thinking addictive games are addictive because they're  good? Or did you add a retcon with "addictiveness was an aspect of \[a  game being good\]"?
---
I didn't "add a retcon", the original statement explains it fully, addictiveness is to be derived from a good game, i never said that addictiveness defines how good a game is and that's what you tried to go with.
---
 The reason I do this on purpose. I will kill everything real quick just because its so upsetting.
---
 I mostly avoid events though, so its rare. ;)
---
Wow, this was an awesome response. I truly appreciate you taking the time to type all that out.
---
PVP works better when everyone participates for sure.
---
I think I'm going to pick this game up and see what I am missing. I'll update this comment after I retry  the game.
---
Not here to give you crap or troll you TC, but your defense of the game is centered on everything not bethesda is missed out by people who haven't "given the game a fair chance."
---
I don't like being lied to, or to have my money stolen.  Bethesda had done both to everyone who plays this game.  They haven't stolen my money seeing as how i didn't get the game at launch and don't need to play the game at all to see i don't want to support bethesda, but in attempt to sell me on it they've lied plenty to me.  16x the detail.. if fallout 4 was 1080p, that would presume 16k, which isn't even possible on todays consumer tech, yet the game released from what i seen with worst detail then fallout 4.  The atom shop is plenty to keep me away and now they are offering private play entirely on a subscription fee (compare to games that offer servers like conan and ark, both of which you can still play privately without, but hardware restraints force a tether to keep payers in an area together so the server (your console or pc) only has to process events in a local area.) .  So far the only thing they cared about being released unbuggy is the wastelanders update, the thing that doesn't make them money, the only thing they've delayed.  If they cared at all about how the customer feels about their game, they would be willing to delay these things that do make them money to ensure they work properly.
---
Not going to keep beating the dead horse, bethesda is bethesda at this point, your full aware of everything they've done i'm sure.  On one hand, I am that guy that says "you do you."  If your enjoying this game then by all means play to your hearts content, i'm not going to bash a gamer for doing what they enjoy.  However, on the other hand, it's heavily in my mind that anyone who could still be spending any kind of money and even give a game like this activity is the entire reason the AAA gaming industry has gone to shit, why loot boxes keep ruining games with great potential.  If the companies doing these things that make us "unsatisfied" keep making money, they have no reason to change course.
---
Hearing the community is pretty much what makes this game so special to you does put a smile on my face.  I personally wish everyone would agree to meet in another game that isn't run by a trash developer.  But overall, you guys do you and i just have to hope you all think twice about pulling out your wallet for this developer.
---
Haha, I was just wondering since this will be the first flair that comes out that pisses people off more than the raiders one. Who even needs actual FO1st when you could just pretend on Reddit?
---
FO4 has tremendous amount of content and has thousands of mods that can improve your experience the way you want it. FO76 is a front for the Atomic shop and has a Battle Royale mode.
---
You're unequivocally wrong. Our consumer dollar affects how companies move forward with products. Enough people uninstall the game and refuse to pay for a subscription, but future products, etc, will definitely affect bethesda's bottom line. And I guarantee you they're talking about it right now in their meetings. Does that mean they're going to lower the price? Probably not because they don't want to eat crow. But you better bet removing your money from a product has an impact.
---
Nah.
---
Except ESO has content and Crowns are useful.
---
Christmas came early!
---
That's pretty cool... good stuff.
---
I want your dog. But I don't want to go to WV. Want to come to Ontario? lol
---
The problem is the feeling you had was something they created by first lowering stash space, increasing tediousness of storing junk etc, then they offer a paid way to fix it all and make the game feel fun by comparison.
---
 A gamer. ;) And you want to punish Bethesda for .... I'm not sure. I suspect its some kind of herd thing.
---
Sometimes on reddit I have trouble distinguishing whether I’m being trolled by a human, or a all-encompassing self-aware ad network with a predilection for very niche memes.
---
Either way tho
---
Honestly have no idea what you’re talking about lol. Haven’t noticed this problem at all?
---
How much support you gotta give it? Sounds like they already buy atoms. How about they support the players and don't lie to us. How does that make me a sucker? People can have different opinions. I'm sure someone thinks the smell of shit is nice, doesn't mean I can't have an opinion that something is wrong with them.
---
I will rephrase this guys argument in the way i always describe my complaints with the atom shop. 
---
Fallout 4 was one of the best selling games the studio has ever made and its initial sales were plenty enough for them to justify making two very large substantial expansions as well as several smaller but still feature rich ones. 
---
The final expansion for Fallout 4, Nuka World sold for 20 bucks and with it you got an entire new main quest line, multiple new side quests, a full featured new companion with romance options, multiple completely new weapons as well as expanded mod selection for several old ones, over two dozen completely new armor and apparel items, and a completely new overhauled and much simpler version of the settlement system geared towards evil players as well as a completely new and large map space to explore. 
---
You got all of that shit for a one time payment of 20 US dollars, now lets see what 20 US dollars gets you on the atom shop in 76, without a bundle or a sale 20 bucks gets you about one power armor paint job and a few player icons or emotes. 
---
Can you possibly see how anyone could look at that shift in cost to value ratio and think to themselves, "wow that is complete bullshit and no one should buy these due to them being worse in value and quality in every way to what i could get from the same company in their previous title." 
---
No game that is not free to play needs micro transactions to fund itself and none of them ever have especially from the big AAA dev teams. 
---
The old model of making a game and then selling the complete game and using the profits to fund further expansions worked perfectly fine before and was very profitable, every one of these big publishers and dev teams that talk about player choice and keeping the players together through free updates are completely full of shit in every way and i am perpetually disgusted by how many people have bought into their complete and total lies.
---
*edited to remove my unfair reply*
---
I think that if you don’t get it, you don’t get it, like with motion sickness in a car. You could drive 10 miles or 50,000 miles, but it probably won’t make a difference
---
I feel like they said that for people to buy the game. With the amount of lies that Bethesda pulled since 2018, I wouldn't doubt that it was their plan all along to announce free DLC and have them make a statement later to claim that "They reconsidered and needed to make monetize to add stuff". For fucks sake, why should ANYONE buy fallout, or any future fallout games, compared to the other top notch open world games, that BY THE WAY, ADD FREE UPDATES AND ACTUALLY BRING NEW CONTENT ASKED BY THE COMMUNITY, THEY DON'T ADD BASIC SHIT THAT SHOULD HAVE BEEN IN THE GAME IN THE FIRST PLACE.
---
I've never played it so I wouldn't know. It seems fun though!
---
Any attempted help is appreciated. :)
---
- Andromeda was killed because it was a bad mass effect game that sold poorly. 
---
- ESO is a MMORPG. Destiny's DLC's are DLC. Neverwinter is an MMORPG. Multiplayer maps are not a subscription they are DLC. 
---
- Bethesda is the first publisher to put a subscription in a non MMORPG video game so yes they are creating a problem. 
---
Anything else?
---
I have played the game for 600+ hours and don’t see any problem...
---
Googled- just because some people don’t like the animation doesn’t mean it’s a problem for most people. I don’t see an issue.
---
 "I haven't had a single server disconnect in days, I don't have players  with names like "xXsniper420kushXx following me around, acting like an  idiot, items I am looking for, are where they should be, scrapbox has  not eaten a single item, it's really not that bad."
---
Same here. Zero problems and smooth as silk gameplay.  A lot of what I thought were bugs seem to be server lag issues glitching out the game in Adventure. VATS, Stealth mechanics all seem work as they should, surprisingly.
---
Thanks! Glad to see someone hate video games so much!
---
Some of the people I play with never have this issue. But others who DO have completely different hardware than me.
---
 \-Having camo skins is an advantage.   
---
Indeed, I have always laughed at the line in Fortnite's store that says skins have no effect in game play.  
---
\- And I'm asking them to elaborate because of how subjective it is.   
---
It needs no further elaboration, it is an advantage for the reasons he listed.  
---
\-And anyone can argue anything, it doesn't mean it's argued intelligently, or we'll reasoned. 
---
That was my point as well.
---
Honestly the chances of those games being good anyways is seriously at question. Bethesda is an obsolete developer tbh.
---
if there was one I would do this just to see the melts
---
I’m the same, but it’s not due to playtime. To be fair, I didn’t realise it was a problem either, but that’s because I don’t suffer from it (maybe it’s due to playing FPS video games since childhood? I’m not sure). It’s really bad for a lot of people though.
---
Think they are expanding it based on what others have said about the North west corner
---
This is literally the stupidest responsive I ever heard on Reddit. Do you even know how the economy works?  Just because you're not splattering their responses all over Twitter doesn't mean that the feedback and loss of consumers and users in Fallout hasn't affected their future plans moving forward or their marketing ideas and future pricing.
---
You do know that this is all over the news. You don't think this affects other consumers in the video game market? Do you really think people are going to pre-order Bethesda games besides the brainless drones that buy anything with the Bethesda name on it? You better believe the mass exodus from the game is going to affect Bethesda.
---
Except it's not. Unless the last decade of video game industry history didn't actually happen.
---
I had 3 regulars utterly destroy my camp. Gotta catch a frog so I can “repair all”
---
Then it should be fixed for me already.
---
Again not implying anything. Just explaining why I asked the questions
---
Depending on the servers required to run the game, it's conceivable they're only paying $12-15/month for a server that would be able to serve 6-8 players throughout that period. So yeah..$3-4 sounds more on point.
---
(Prices based on AWS server costs, without considering any special contracts available to larger firms)
---
And then there’s you, lowering yourself far beneath all of that. 
---
At least the people who play this game have a good excuse. They have fun. And that’s ok. It’s ok if people have fun playing bad games. What’s not ok is someone having fun being a douche on the internet. That’s just sad.
---
You can get FO4, and *all* the DLC for $23.99 on Steam right now. You have far more freedom to build, and there are mods that can even improve that.
---
did you get anything useful?
---
building in fo4 has more options considering you have mods to work with. Also theirs some cool stuff in the creation club for building etc
---
I can confirm that it isnt. Lmao, I wish though.
---
I didn't spend more on a free game. Don't make assumptions. I spend no more than $10-20 on any free-to-play game. I already spent many times more than that on 76. In both cases I spent that money to support the developer for providing something I enjoy. Both perfectly rational decisions. I am choosing not to support Bethesda's practices in this case because
---
A) I can't afford it in my last semester of college
---
B) I don't want Atoms or cosmetics with it. A lower price subscription option with just the gameplay and server elements would appeal to me.
---
C) Their implementation of private servers doesn't even keep the server alive if the one paying for it isn't playing on it. That's something you'd expect from connecting to another player's world peer-to-peer (functionality that is **free** in other games), not a paid service. If you pay for the month, the private server instance on AWS should remain online for a month, not kick everyone after you log off then be recreated when you log back in.
---
Wow what a great response. What are you five? Why don't you respond with an intelligible discussion. Or are you too worried that you can't validate your choices?
---
Pedantic too? You don't say.

Just shows theirs actually courteous people in the game (x
---
No problem, you are attempting to help, which is appreciated. :)
---
It’s not about ‘not liking the animation’, it’s about it causing motion sickness for a not-insignificant number of players...
---
Have you ever paid bills before in your life?
---
Well the subscription allows access to years worth of expansions/dlc so you don't have to buy it.  Crowns can be used on what few dlc aren't offered with +, time savers and cosmetic things.
---
I do not think the two subscriptions are all that similar at all having played both games.
---
You said and I quote "awful games have been selling subscription services for decades" so if you're not talking about MMORPG's which is very different then you're saying lots of non MMO games have been selling subscriptions for decades which is a bold claim since I can't think of a single one. 
---
Can you refresh my memory?
---
I am and always have been a heavy weapons explosive build so all my guns are in my person due to ordinance and bear arms.. the stash thing virtually changed very little to me, WHAT IS my advantage is that I store the scrap for me and like 4 of my friends and any time they need some we pull from my inventory, I get your complaint, but like all the utility items for pay, ONLY ever really help with time... I can store more junk so I forage less, repairkits save me the trouble of repairing my weapons...(even though I never ever would buy those atom shop ones cuz the ones you get from the queen are waaaaay better) it's not something that you have to have... like if I never bought membership, my experience would be exactly the same, it doesn't prevent people from doing any quests or events, so in my opinion, their approach to fallout has been way better than teso
---
U play long enough u will see that most of the players are this helpful, they helped me when i was leveling up and i help those i can. So just remember ur experience and if u see a fellow player getting their asses handed to them jump in and help the best u can. If u see a fellow player new to the world drop some aid for them or buy some junk out of their vendor. If u think about it, its what this game is all about rebuilding Appalachia.
---
I always manually store any outside stuff (foundation blocks, fences, decoration, purifiers,  you name it...) before blueprinting my main structure to give the blueprint more of a chance at successfully placing at the next location. I have learned the hard way that not doing so means you're unlikely to be able to place it elsewhere.
---
I wish I got a 2 star armour and 2 1 star weapons and a completely destroyed camp
---
Fallout 4 made fuck tons of money and had absolutely no micro transactions until long after the final full expansion came out.
---
Skyrim made fuck tons of money in the same way, as did Oblivion, Morrowind, Fallout 3, and Fallout New Vegas. 
---
They have not made a non profitable product in over a decade and they never needed obscene micro payments before and they don't need them now.
---
Bethesda are definitely really struggling for revenue and need to charge through the nose for literal garbage to pay their starving workers, yes.
---
What % are affected? I’ve just never heard of this before. Can you adjust look sensitivity to reduce it? Or play in 3rd person?
---
Tbh that’s the only thing. That and maybe just having to switch worlds to sell to players.
---
Play a Fallout 4 mod instead
---
&gt; quirky, flirty, weirdo female
---
RIP your inbox
---
Your basically telling Bethesda they can keep getting away with shit like this if you buy the sub. I'm not giving any sympathy for some moron who wants p2w advantages.
---
Why are you getting personal dude?  I’ve said nothing to attack you, just said that a shitty game is shit.
---
Why are you so invested in this? Are you a shareholder or something?  Are you a developer?
---
Like, calm down dude, it’s just a game.
---
A shitty game.
---
1. So?
---
2. You're saying it's impossible to bring about change from doing something like posting on reddit?
---
3. Who said anything about the sub for free? I don't even play the game anymore and even if I did I don't care about private servers. The issue isn't that the sub costs money please read the post next time. 
---
3.5. Anyone that supports this is the problem because they're ruining future games for everyone just so they can pay for some very shitty broken services.
---
'I can't afford this because my country's currency is only worth 2/3 the currency of the home country of the service' is a valid decision.  
---
It doesn't make the price of the service unreasonable, or mean that it should be changed.
---
Tanks. 
---
We need tanks. 
---
Wasteland of Tanks.
---
And for the followup, in rememberance of Far Harbor, Wasteland of Warships.
---
I've a terrible feeling it's punishment for killing people with legacy laser/plasma and tesla. You roll the dice every time you fight using those - when you kill your enemy, sometimes they win.
---
When you've done clean installs of both the OS and FO76, do you install anything else (literally anything else)? Or do you essentially install Win10, latest updates/drivers, and then FO76? If you're getting the EXACT same behavior on a barebones clean install of both, this leads me to believe its some sort of actual hardware fault. Though, if that were true, I'd figure it would occur in other games. Which reminded me of the FO4 glitch on 2070s with weapon debris causing crashes. Quite specific..I wonder if its something along those lines with the 2080ti...very strange....have you stepped through the graphical options one at a time? Very tedious, but.. 
---
A guide I came across in trying to get a breakdown of the graphical settings..may be worth a try for you.
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/aqtokr/fallout_76_pc_version_graphic_presets_explanation/
---
Had you noticed when turning down settings if crashes decreased or remained appx the same?
---
I know it feels a bit like flinging shit at the wall and hoping something sticks, but yeah..
---
I feel this on a emotional level
---
Its around the border of the Savage Divide and the Mire, if they are talking about what i think they are talking about. Thought i would narrow your search a little. Its fairly interesting.
---
They did this. 
---
You guys still bitched up a shit fit.
---
Its the thinking of complete idiots who can't form a simple cost to benefit ratio to save themselves, compare what the 20 dollar Nuka World expansion got you in the last game to what 20 bucks gets you in 76 and anyone who is not completely brain dead can easily understand why the entire micro payment system is nothing but greedy shit shoved down peoples throats.
---
Don't forget the Nuka Dark Rum fiasco. 80$ for a plastic shell with an industrial bottle that was delayed for about 2 months since people pre-ordered. The rum wasn't even good lol.
---
I’m not sure on the numbers exactly, though I’ve seen a lot of internet posts and videos about it. It was a major problem on PS4 because nobody could do anything about it before console mods came out. Bethesda swept a lot of it under the carpet too.
---
I’m not sure about FOV adjustment or third-person (good idea though!), I’ll try to give her a try with it. Apparently ginger biscuits can reduce the effects, but it just seems so daft to be having to go to those extents just to play a game.
---
I hope I didn’t come across as militant originally, I’m just very fed up with Bethesda at the moment, please accept my apologies 😊
---
While it would be cool, think of the extra outrage from players. You effectively could make the entire map a high level farm zone. If I was Bethesda I would set aside anything that could alter a private world to be better that carries over to adventure.   
---
Damn it I can hear the future man babies and trolls already...
---
3 didn't have a world fence, just the barrier. However New Vegas was physically closed in via cliff walls with the occasional invisible wall or fences in certain areas, but they never put up the "you cannot go this way" barrier so if you manage to jump over some of the fences you can just wander to the end of the map.
---
Reminds me of that one time my 3 touchy uncle's came into my room at night
---
Fact: I say fact at the beginning of my sentence because it makes me feel powerful. 
---
Oh wait that's actually true.
---
So giving up is getting my ass handed over. Fighting back is being salty. Right. Makes total sense.
---
The power of community. This is wonderful, thank you for posting this.
---
If anybody's working on it, we're years away from it being released. Building a game server is not easy.
---
battlenet?
---
I have a geforce card (and the associated bloatware), and I haven't had any issues with the game at all.
---
&gt; until the issue is talked to death.
---
If the Fallout 76 community has taught any of us anything it's that that is a thing that will never happen.  People will keep finding new and inventive ways to beat the dead horse.
---
Why are battlepasses in so many games now a days? If a company, like Epic let's say, didn't implement a new monetization method, such as the battlepass, that was mostly successful would we see battlepasses in every "AAA" game as we are now? 
---
Also please stop wasting your finger energy typing up large paragraphs that are completely off topic and utterly irrelevant to everything. I mean for fucks sake man you've somehow ended up all the way on "warframe is P2W" like what are you smoking? 
---
It's very clear what's being discussed here has gone way above your head yikes. 
---
Shit I don't even think fallout 76 is P2W at all why are you talking about that lmao? And warframes an F2P game with a very balanced and fair cash shop and economy like jesus lmao
---
Can you FEEL the POWAH?
---
I mean they kinda made multiplayer fallout wrong tbh. All anyone wanted was to play fallout with friends as in coop but they went full multiplayer game, which led to the game being made for multiplayer (public events, enemies leveling to higher level players in the area, etc.) and in turn makes the game barely playable like fallout, solo or otherwise.
---
That's true, ultimately it boils down to that. But I think you can also make an objective comparison between the two (a video game subscription vs. a TV channel subscription) and look at the quality and quantity of what's being offered for the same price. In the future we probably won't even buy and download games any more, but instead stream them online just like everything else. Assuming that service is going to have the same cost as something like Netflix, it would be absolutely ridiculous to charge $12 per month for just ONE game.
---
¯\\\_( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)_/¯
---
Hell the ones cut and pasted are the good ones (Except when they inexplicably remove gloves , WTF is with that shit - gloves are better than shittily digitized hands) the woodsman outfit, the cryptid enthusiast outfit, shit like that is what i'm talking about. It's ugly, boring, i wouldn't fucking wear it if they GAVE it away. they need to have a chat with their artists or whomever designs outfits. They suck.
---
Lmao points for that I try to forget that total scam of a game exists
---
I pointed out on another post that I seem to be the only person on servers that doesn't have it. Everybody else does the dance emote at least.
---
I was downvoted. Not really sure why. Either because I noticed it or don't have it.
---
Here's what I think: the game undersold and the atom shop underperforms. As a result, they need a way to fund the new content. So basically, they made a crappy game with a crappy item shop and now expect those who are still playing (almost certainly the same people who already paid full price for the game) to keep feeding them money. 
---
If the game had sold better and the item shop didn't suck, maybe they would have had enough cash to fund the content without awful cash grabs like this subscription. At the end of the day, they're asking the player to fund their own mistakes, and that's just not right.
---
¯\_(ツ)_/¯
---
I don't care about what you do. It's what most people who complain and try to make your argument do.
---
And if you're not spending money there which is also optional, you're complaining about this optional one because you paid $60 for a while game and they want you to pay more for new features?
---
I agree that there PR team sucks
---
Again, didn't read the post hey? Seriously what's the point of trying to troll when you don't even read the post and embarrass yourself in the attempt?? It's just pitiful lol
---
(¬_¬)
---
I think it was Activision’s CEO who said that if he could get away with making players pay every time they reloaded a magazine in COD he’d do it.
---
ಠ_ಠ
---
I play every day.  I'm increasing their concurrent numbers, but I'm also eating up their resources without contributing anything financially to the company.
---
It's sooo hard to choose how to be a dick these days.
---
here we go again :)
---
I'm fine with pay to win. Did it in elder scrolls online with the ESOplus subscription service....didn't really help me to win but whatever.
---
Your about 3 days and 600 pissed off posts late for this.  But I agree with you.    FUEL UP YOUR ROCKETSHIP AND JOIN US ON THE OUTER WORLDS
---
Well said! Head bob is a real issue for some players
---
What you should do is spend $100 to support these poor developers then maybe they'll let you save your character
---
inb4 "it's not p2w because there is nothing to win"
---
I spend $15 a month in atoms, so this was a no brainer got an outfit emotes and my atoms I would buy anyways. Plus I got the scrapbox and tent as a bonus. I honestly feel that this sub was targeted at people like me who put hours in hate the PK assholes at workshops and spend $15 a month (or more for some) .   
---
On a cool bonus side I had 12 workshops running yesterday for 14 hours and 0 crashes on the private server where if I can hold 2 on a public I am lucky to go without a crash. Hell I am just lucky not to crash with all the assholes doing the throw dupe.
---
Okay. Sadly history disagrees with you but hey whatever helps you sleep at night friend 🤷🏻‍♂️
---
And NZ has a 15% VAT, so it's about $5 of difference over the course of a year.  Hardly extreme.
---
Go cry
---
Cool
---
yup &lt;3
---
BE Gat Plas will destroy all other competition. 
---
The flamer is a silly weapon. 
---
Those are my thoughts.
---
Try the Bethesda launcher instead.
---
Quick question: do you have your vending machines powered? That was my problem at first.
---
aaaww :3 thnks
---
I doubt it. It may not be easy, and I never said it was, but it may be a lot easier than you think. I think a lot of stuff is handled by the client. The database will hold character information and inventory etc. Maybe a disgruntled employee will leak it and help it along. Maybe a worker in the server farm is a Fallout 76 fan and is angry about the whole thing and leaks it. So many possibilities.
---
Haha! I tried to die for someone recently... Jumped off one of those watchtowers naked... and lived to tell about it. The guy had a good laugh while my husband climbed up and jumped off. It worked much better that time. Moral of the story: Take a rad-x to get rid of the bird bones effect first...
---
Gneeeeeee gneeeeee. Done
---
What a dickhead
---
Not you
---
Bruh why are you here if you hate the game so much, fucking egg
---
I do.  I get a little dizzy in 1st person.  Sucks.  That said, I got dizzy w Fallout 4 even in 3rd person at first LOL.
---
The sub has always had people that come in to bitch when there's the latest drama. Often somebody that's never posted or commented here before. It's bizarre. I've never been on the No Man's Sky or RDR2 sub, let alone to stir up shit when there was trouble.
---
On the other hand the fallout first stuff seems different.
---
My Zealots DCG + Extra Claw kills with one swipe. i run Incisor +3/Martial Artist + 3/Tron Fist + 3/Barbarian +[3.At](https://3.At) Whitespring i take out Ghouls before they get through the Door.:-)
---
The Meat Hook + extra Hook always takes 2 Swipes,no idea why,you would think that thing would be lethal.
---
DCG  minimum damage output is higher 330 +.Meat Hook 245 +
---
The Meat Hook is level 45.The Zealots DCG level 50.This could be the reason.
---
Have also noticed Covert Operative (Stealth) works with the DCG and not the Meat Hook.
---
Tbh i am I  surprised at how lethal the DCG is compared to the Meat Hook.
---
I have an Executioner DCG with extra claw and  90% reduced weight in my vendor that still has not been bought at just 500 Caps.Quite surprised. Personally i think these are the go to weapon for farming Whitespring and westek..Every swipe needs to kill when you are overwhelmed by Ghouls or Super Mutants in an enclosed space.
---
Hahaha, I welcome it. I'm such a loner.
---
I prefer no head bob as well and turn it off in games that let you, it doesn't give me any negative effects at least.
---
PS. Can someone do a mod to turn it off IRL as well😊, I tried but the only way it works is to walk looking like a total wierdo.
---
:(
---
Please do buy it this whole “classwar” monetizingBS debacle has become quite fun to watch and partake in if Bethesda won’t add meaningful factions I guess we’ll make our own.
---
The overwhelming majority of fallout 1st isnt pay to win. If the scrap box would just be given to everyone. Than it wouldn't be P2W at all
---
Damn man you pulling up the hater train caboose there.
---
Same thing that unlimited stash will give players
---
ʕノ•ᴥ•ʔノ ︵ ┻━┻
---
You wanna fuckin go kid
---
And it was my birthday yesterday and I spent a whole year thinking I was a year older than I actually am.  So in the spirit of not false advertising I am only 36. LOL
---
Ciuuuf ciuuuuf!
---
How many more days of these posts do we have?
---
It's true, the FO76 community is great. We all love the Fallout universe and see the potential in FO76. I'm sorry you got all those hate comments, but I hope you understand why so many of us are angry at Bethesda. We're disappointed in players like yourself that give Bethesda money for non-cosmetics, since it reduces the chance that Bethesda will reverse-course and make everything free (like they originally said).
---
It's not p2w because it's not p2w. More stash space makes you win? A second camp makes you win? Convenience isn't winning
---
It would still have been the same crap, so no.
---
Sounds like you are primed to spend $100 more on this game!
---
What exactly would be OK to monetize without upsetting people?
---
Some people are going to complain no matter what, this sub blows up everytime something new is introduced to the game, and given a little time it's all proven to be nothing more than a small convenience or even a joke;
---
* Repair Kits, really, I've never bought any, I have 170+ Improved ones on one character, I dropped and destroyed 50 last week.
---
* Scrap Bot, is nothing more than a novelty (Comedy Bot), that provides about as much scrap in a week as I can loot from the map in 5 minutes.
---
* Scrap Box, allows me to store some of what I would normally drop or not pick up in the first place.
---
* Forward Tent, means I can now stop moving my Camp or drinking Rad Ant Lager after SBQ battles.
---
The fact is that the game requires a revenue stream to remain viable, and nothing Bethesda does to generate it will be met with complaints.
---
It's p2w.
---
The OP here has only been on Reddit for a month, and from his post history he is only here to start shit with us. 
---
His post history is respite with single word responses, even so far as just typing in Karma and moving on. 
---
He is a Karma farmer, and not a real member of this community. 
---
Do not feed this troll.
---
I thought the questlines in 76 were ok, but I burned through it in a few days...and I did this on two characters. If you get FO4, you'll be drowning in quests, especially if you include all the DLC.
---
FO76 is very shallow when it comes to content. I think the hope was that people would make their own fun a la Sea of Thieves.
---
Apart from nuclear winter I don’t see this game as very competitive, your not paying to win over another player, your paying for convenience and the ability to have more flexibility in you day to day play through. 
---
Do you feel like a loser for not having a scrap box? If your not losing then how am I winning?
---
no u ┻━┻ ︵ヽ(`Д´)ﾉ︵ ┻━┻
---
Probably until tomorrow, when confusion posts over Mischief Night take over.
---
If you take a look at it from this side yes it's a pretty bad move, people got mad because of the delayed wastelanders and short time after it they announce the subscription people get even more mad and it continues, Bethesda got some bad management I think someone who predicts what they should be doing is very bad at his job..
---
youre not behaving in a civil manner as the rules of this sub require...
---
If you buy their full priced game and don’t buy their microtransactions… they still win because putting in the MT’s cost them nothing. They still sold you the game and made their money. They just didn’t get MT gravy all over the top of it. Make no mistake, even if you don’t buy into the MT’s you’re still helping because you keep the game alive and busy, you keep the uh… poors population up so that the whales have someone to beat on.

lol they have your server up anyway. If they had given everyone private servers, *then* you would have been eating up their resources without contributing financially. Keeping the public servers up is already a cost to them
---
It depends. If the people with the scrap box continue to sell scrap, then potentially it might go down. If they continue to be hoarders, then the available supply goes down, and prices may rise.
---
You posted that already
---
Warframe is probably the most fairly monetized free to play game of all time. You can grind for literally everything you can buy with premium currency. Even if something can only be obtained with premium currency (mostly just colors) you can trade other players stuff you have for it so you can get the premium currency for free. Free to play can be fair and even if fallout 76 was free to play its still being too greedy.
---
Don’t make this about first
---
Oh shit. Ok u win
---
Wow smooth game play good thing it only cost an additional $100.
---
Thanks for agreeing.
---
Look, you didn't deserve to get bullied in that way. But in life when you are part of the out group, in this case the idiot that paid for what should've been a free update, you are putting yourself on notice to bullies. You show that you have no integrity and bad people will exploit it. Now go pay some more money to Bethesda for their wanderer update in a few months and ignore my response. Show them you're made of money and you will pay everything to make things happen. Please.
---
They even left you a quest? Generous!
---
You know I didn't even get 1st (yet). Because I came along before it existed and I do now, I'm not a grabby child that wants everything it sees.
---
I totally understand that they want money for private servers. And that they want/need money as a company. So the deal is okay. Could be cheaper, but who cares, the other stuff is convenience stuff that you don't need
---
Thanks for the comments, much love &amp; respect gamer to gamer for giving a fair &amp; civil opinion. I remember a Bethesda documentary where Todd says 76 was the original multiplayer version of FO4 &amp; the games were worked on side by side.
---
Hell if Im honest Im with you 100%, its just not right to make us pay for the features &amp; improvements we as a community suggested. Solutions to problems seemingly planted purposefully for profit or used as bargaining tools &amp; peace offerings for future mistakes. Maybe Im a hypocrite for still supporting no matter my reasoning, Ill have to decide if Im ready to give up on the game when my month sub is up.. depending on how Beth decides to make this whole mess right I guess..
---
I think there are key differences between Fallout 76 and mmos with subscription models.
---
1) Most MMOs with subscription models tend to be free to play and not charge $60-200 to play in the first place.
---
2) Most MMOs don't promise that their game is going to only have cosmetic microtransactions
---
3) Most MMOs aren't as broken as Fallout 76 is
---
4) Most MMOs don't repeatedly lie to their playerbase like Fallout 76 does
---
5) Most MMOs don't take highly requested features, some of which are ideas created by their own fanbase, and then charge them for it, especially when those features are solutions to major problems people have been having with the game since day one.
---
Bethesda has shown to be completely untrustworthy company who keeps pushing the bar for whats considered acceptable in their game.  Within less than a year of Fallout 76's release, they've placed so many gameplay changing features behind larger and larger paywalls despite most of their fanbase repeatedly telling them that they don't want it. So I don't think its out of the question that they'll eventually start selling legionaries or create an in game auctionhouse/marketplace like early Diablo 3 or Counterstrike.
---
Oh I meant that in a sarcastic dismissive way, sorry that you misconstrued it lol
---
Same here, gforce 970, no issues. No battlenet. I use Bethesda Launcher
---
What??? But you are a fallout first member?! Bugs in the game ????
---
thats what i said. the increase dmg you can get with the meat hook isnt necessary. it just looks nice to hit the queen with 10k hits tho.
---
Its kina mesed up if we cant play the dam dlc
---
Of course the implication is that the characters would be separated and the entired system modified to acccomodate people who don't own the base game. Otherwise players wouldn't even be able to access Vault 51 since they'd need a character that has exited Vault 76.
---
Are you somehow stupid? You already commented this.
---
Hey there, I love this post :). You seem really nice. I don’t have fallout 76 but I would love to play other games with you! :D
---
Wait they didn't steal my money... What I remember is I paid for the game because I wanted and so did you and all the other people so don't tell someone has stolen your money if you willingly gave it to them by buying the game.
---
Because it is. I always point to warframe when i want to talk about fair monetization. I can't think of anything gameplay impacting that you can't grind for. And even if there is, well just make some good stuff and trade someone for platinum and you just got premium currency for free.
---
All of these have been suggested, along with 100 other things.  The team behind the atom shop is in a no win situation. Players who feel everything should be locked into the original purchase price are screwed.
---
Sounds like a complaint to me....
---
Have you ever kissed Bethesda boots?
---
Oh wait.
---
i'm ok to the payment server too
---
That better Fallout games satirized. FO76 made a game out of flinging nukes around. Bethesda turned everything around this game into the kind of profits uber alles fuck everyone else capitalism that, again, better Fallout games dogged on. This is like Disney putting out a movie about the evils of monopolization of media.
---
Thanks for reminding me! I really wish nuclear winter rewards weren’t going on at the same time. Oh well.
---
Could be the next Hitler though
---
I was agreeing and expanding on your thoughts.
---
Don't tell people in a game sub to don't play the game dumbass
---
Let me add in especially after your comment... not having toxic people like yourself tell others what they can’t or shouldn’t buy is also a huge plus...
---
I hope you murdered the hell out of them all.
---
The problem is that Bethesda purposely leaves these features out of the game so that players feel forced to buy the service.  It wouldn't be an issue if the service was additional stuff not affecting gameplay.  Or even for moddable private servers.
---
I think you right 
---
this is Bethesda--&gt; 8====D (( &lt;--this is your ass
---
I'm not getting personal, I just personally think you are totally ignorant about the subject and don't want to hear your shitty opinion.
---
Your arguement is flawed because your private server isnt private. When you log into it you can find mobs dead. Also your unlimited crate space inventroy well congrats it got deleted! Woooweee!
---
I once was blind ti Bethesda's flaws. Now I'm looking forward to outer worlds. A SCIFI game by the giys that did the best fall out (imho) new vegas.
---
Sorry, don't know what sarcasm is.
---
It brought myself, my wife, and three of our friends back to the game, since all we were after with 76 in the first place was playing Fallout with *friends*, not as some poor man's MMO.
---
I like it overall.  I think private server characters shouldn't be allowed on adventure due to how easy it is to get resources without competition, and that characters going back and forth is bad for the health of the game.  I also think the tent and scrapbox should either be available to everyone in Adventure, or only to 1st players in their private worlds.  Allowing them to benefit from those things in Adventure is not the best design choice.
---
Started playing it with a few friends after the Casino update and noticed they been doin' rotations of large in-game sales and bonus cash missions every week, among other things too... Only thing I owned from long ago was a normal penthouse but after getting first heist completion bonus with same team it lead to almost completing the game just playing somewhat casually thanks to the weeklies. 
---
Main objective of GTAO being; owning every type of property so people stop pestering me with phone calls... Just need Casino and Arena now. Bunker makes me the most money during bonus, 420k a supply bar. Not to mention the whole thing is along-side a single player game you go back to whenever you want and you can make solo/friend lobbies for free.
---
I used to snicker at Rockstar being picked on over Shark Cards but honestly the game is pretty generous compared to others. There're also games like GW2 and Warframe that I consider having really good monetization since everything is earned in game, other than the GW2 expansion, but that isn't bad considering the base game is free now. You don't have to buy it + all expansions at the same time + need a subscription like ESO/Zenimax and require loot boxes for randoming the cosmetics you want... Zenimax may corrupt 76 further with things like that.
---
Troubleshooters armour should reduce the damage enough to make it manageable to hold pylons and take a few hits.
---
Cool!
---
Russians never do
---
Report and move on
---
Not really. I have barely any time to play with college and work, but I still manage to enjoy the game and grind a good amount of money. If you know how to do it, you can easily grind 1.5 million a day with almost no effort.
---
Mmmmm. Seems to be working just fine on Xbox. Took out a bunch of mutants at West Tech yesterday using my lever action from a distance. Each shot gaining accuracy, and also the same with Mole Miners at Sunnytop.
---
Are you Russian?
---
lol report.. what kind of kook do you take me for
---
This. People underestimate the value of keeping a good troubleshooter set on hand. It's prob the only situation specific armor that makes sense outside pvp. Silos, Encrypted, and AWOL Armaments are a breeze. Not to mention taking basically no damage while completing the robot atom challenges.
---
Ok first off you complain that the game was released with bugs and should have been fixed before release, then when they delay Watelanders so they can make sure to iron out bugs, you complain again. Bethesda can’t please you and to be honest probably don’t care if you stop playing.
---
they should really just make the game free to play, and give everyone who already owns it 6000 atoms.
---
idk what idiot is in charge of their decision making process.
---
Thanks OP and thanks to your well travelled pooch. Also from someone on the other side of the planet it's really cool to see these places for real.
---
The thing is, you actually got something for your subscriptions in something like WoW. New raids, items, quests, storylines, activities. Each expansion brought in another huge round of content that the subscription then paid for growing until the next one.
---
Fallout First gets you the removal of an artificial scrap limit, the ability to play the game solo, and 1650 fun bucks to spend on Fallout 4’s customization options.
---
It’s not even remotely comparable other than that they were subscriptions and roughly the same price. That being said, WoW’s model is virtually dead in mainstream gaming, whether that’s good or ill is up for debate.
---
That's odd. I'll post a video of it not working in a couple minutes.
---
I didn't say a damn thing about what someone shouldn't but, just pointing out it is a shame that getting a smooth game play requires an additional $100 investment on the players.
---
My favorite tour of WV yet!
---
Good, imagine being stupid enough to buy it. These people should be bullied and shamed.
---
I don't find it *unusual*. I do find it anti-consumer, especially in how it has gone down.
---
Sold full priced game with specific promises and expectations.
---
Receive game with less than promised and expected. Patiently await fixes.
---
Business comes out with pay model to fix some of those issues. Now you have to pay to get things that arguably should have already been there, to fix base game QoL issues.
---
Listen, if they wanted a subscription, they should have just made it so out of the gate. Then this wouldn't even be a discussion.
---
If it is relevant to the tone of a current conversation, and is somewhat recent, is it really beating a dead horse?
---
Not to mention, there's still positives. For example, Wild Appalachia has been generally received to be decent if buggy and untested. People want content, not to pay a subscription service while also not receiving new content
---
It is a different type of game in the fallout universe. I mean that is how it was sold.
---
Yep u are right, stop complaing
---
I don't suffer motion sickness and I honestly didn't even notice the head-bob. That's gotta be rough. Does Dramamine work? (I know taking a pill just to play a game is ridiculous, I'm just genuinely curious if anyone has tried it and if it works)
---
Could have been a glitched server? That's happened to me with other perk cards when swapped around.
---
You just can’t have a comment with out some backhanded comment can you. Videos don’t impact my sleeping in any matter. You seem to be triggered over it so good luck with that.
---
Yes, iv only got one vending machine and it’s definitely powered
---
You had to pay for DLC in fallout 4, and it did have microtransactions soooo
---
HanSwolo87 I’m on every other day
---
It sounds like you get good value out of fallout 1st. Okay that’s nice, but what about how you’re supporting pay to win microtransactions and the ability to get away with lying?
---
Oh I did
---
I rest my case 🤣
---
!RemindMe 3 Months
---
No I've probably put in over 12 hours since the patch. It's consistently broken on every server I play.
---
Your just one of the haters of other people choosing to buy something they want and you’re against... you can either grow up and be mature about it and acknowledge people can make their own decisions and purchases or troll them in a passive aggressive way... 
---
Numerous Factors would be the reason why a server would be smoother... want a list? You’ll find plenty right here in this subreddit
---
Deflect with childish insults all you want, you’ve still not told me one thing you enjoy about this shit ridden whipping boy of the entire games industry.
---
Is there anything?
---
You’re probably one of those “whales” and are so deeply financially invested in this abortion that you feel the need to blindly defend it.  I’m sorry you’ve been exploited and I hope one day you’ll be able to point your anger in the right direction.
---
I’m not sure we get Dramamine over the counter in the UK but we could give some anti-nausea pills a go and feed back to you all, thanks 😊
---
On Xbox?
---
Oh turning it back on me, right outta the playbook
---
Guillotines
---
All you clowns commenting this on my post because you think it's so fucking smart, but you can't even write the command correctly.
---
The problem with paying for this subscription service is that you are telling Bethesda that they should put more and more features behind a paywall. Just look at how many people were very vocal about how they didn't like Bethesda selling gameplay changing microtransactions. It was very clear that the fanbase wanted Bethesda to stick to cosmetic microtransactions. Yet because a small percentage of players bought a lot of them, Bethesda saw that as players loving p2w microtransactions and has now stated they'll add more to the game starting with Fallout First.
---
As much as you love this game and want to support the developers, you are telling Bethesda that they should lock more features behind bigger and bigger paywalls. That's why people who hate Fallout First get mad at players who buy it. Because they don't want anymore mechanics being locked behind expensive paywalls and you are giving Bethesda more reason to do so.
---
The thing is, if I lower the settings and it works, and it works in every other game, app, benchmark, and stress test I can throw at it, it's the game that's broken. That means that there is a configuration of settings that doesn't work, and that configuration should either not be available, or just work.
---
Strangely, FO4 is absurdly stable now. I run it with over 250 mods, and I'm not sure how many 4k textures added in, and..."it just works". I can prime 95 for days.
---
76 is literally the only unstable app on my system.
---
I hear what you're saying about diagnostic process, but my life is more than fallout, and the damned crash dumps should give a dev exactly what they need to address the issue...if they could be bothered to look. And my configuration is different than other people with the same crash. Only thing consistent between us is this game. Not RAM, not Win version, not GPU, not CPU, not storage, not motherboard, not network...just the game. Maybe max settings, but I drink one person didn't...Can't remember.
---
You need a special paid subscription for perks to work. "Broke ass" people don't get perks.
---
Did you try using your personal computer at your camp? I believe they added a part in it that simply marks him for you as a strange sighting or something.
---
That's a different opinion than what I've heard from others. Thanks for the insight my guy! If we had a couple of dlc expansions to go along with FO1st then I wouldn't have any question in my mind that I would buy it.
---
its cause people can't handle people with a different opinion since they are the only ones allowed to be right - cause they are special
---
So how do you know that fallout 1st is key to keeping the developers with a deserving salary, and not just some executives trying to get more money on top of already huge sums?
---
And how do you feel then about studios who put out microtransactions and subscriptions in a way that doesn’t cause an uproar? Are they just being charitable and nice, or do you think fallout fans are just especially awful?
---
Yes, it is about OS and codes. Coding on two different OS is different and in this case F76 is buggy as hell on the PS4. Just because it works fine on PC doesnt mean it works fine on PS4. You probably dont know how coding works.
---
Notice the amount of folks commenting here how they are crashing on the PS4? No other games does this to us and fallout 76 is based on an amazingly old engine.
---
Your ignorance is amazing considering that you don't even play on PS4 and dont even know stuffs about it. No one here should even take you seriously. Probably just a console hater.
---
If the service had just been an actual server that I could invite the full 24 people to, was persistent and world variables adjustable, I'd pay for it.  Hell, I'd pay more than the $13/mo. as dedicated game servers are expensive.  
---
Monetizing features that should be available to all players, if at all, though, that's just pathetic.
---
I don't think Anthem is a good example of anything here. I doubt that game even survives much longer.
---
Good examples would be Destiny. They charge for content drops only, and then have a purely cosmetic MT store to support ongoing free updates.
---
Very odd. I know it worked for me yesterday on at least four servers for hours.
---
FALSE - Secret World, ESO and several other MMORPGs require a purchase of their games $40-60. The base game after purchase is free while there is a subscription service with perks
---
2) Most MMOs don't promise that their game is going to only have cosmetic microtransactions.
---
Most MMOs promise many things not delivered but ALL MMORPGs have microtransactions. 
---
FALSE - You clearly never played FFXIV at launch. It was so broken they pulled the game and relaunched it. ESO is yet another example.
---
4) Most MMOs don't repeatedly lie to their playerbase like Fallout 76 does. 
---
FALSE - Try reading into Randy Pitchford's business practices before playing Borderlands 3.
---
MAYBE - But then again you can always not play the game and simply unsub from r/fo76.
---
&gt; but it may be a lot easier than you think
---
I develop server software for a living. Not game servers (outside of a few small hobby projects), but I have a rough idea of what would be involved here, and for one or two people working in their free time, "years" is not an exaggeration. If you've got a team working full time, that might be a different story. If the existing software gets leaked, then again, different story.
---
&gt; I think a lot of stuff is handled by the client
---
A lot of stuff *is* handled by the client, but you need redundancy on the server side to validate input. So for example, when you try to walk somewhere, the client validates your input to make sure you're not blocked by a wall or something, but it also sends that information to the server to confirm that you successfully moved there. The same needs to be done for taking and receiving damage, looting items, gaining experience, etc; the game can't trust data sent by players, because too many players would cheat if it did, so all of the core game mechanics need to be processed server side. Is it possible to reverse engineer all that logic? Of course, but it's not trivial.
---
I subscribe just to piss you off
---
That's the main thing. ESO has a near identical subscription system and it's very well liked and accepted because the game has fucking content that makes it worth it. The problem isn't the system the problem is Bethesda hasn't proven themselves worthy of offering a subscription with 76.
---
fuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuck
---
Wow really?
---
Dude, you remind me why i bought it. Thanks!
---
( ͡^ ͜ʖ ͡^)
---
Join the Encrypted event whenever you can, even if you're lower-level. Focus on staying under cover, and ready to revive fallen players near the water to get the achievement. 
---
Another option:
---
My teammate and I went to Wavy Willard's wave pool - there is usually at least one Scorched that is unarmed - so we killed the others, he ditched his armor and Perks, and I got some compromising photos of him being bitch-slapped to death in his underwear (just in case he's serious about running for the Grafton Mayor's office). 😯
---
Yes, I revived him; then did the same for him - but he forgot to take pictures. 😎
---
Blocker Perk Rank 3, Med-X, Live &amp; Love Issue #9, about 10 Super Stimpaks, Furious .50 cal....I can hold all pylons and kill the bitch in about 3 minutes solo without a death.
---
&gt;Deflect with childish insults all you want,
---
Calm down dude, don't get your panties in such a bunch. Maybe go somewhere with things you actually like instead of getting your rocks off spewing ignorant shit on things you have actually never experienced.
---
Let's see if anyone else reports in. I'll check again tonight when I'm on, because when I'm doing a sniping run that's my favorite perk.
---
Hey
---
Ask me after the election next year...
---
Did I say I hate on others for what they buy? Don't project on to me. Buy whatever the hell you want. I can still voice my opinion that no one should have to pay so much money for what should be in the base game. People act releaved that lag is better in their private session, I just think it shouldnt take a pay wall to enjoy less lag. Wow there is no getting through to any of you
---
Well you sure like putting labels on people! Anything else?
---
Pretty sure GeForce Now is their game streaming service. You maybe thinking of the GeForce Experience bloatware that was killing my FPS in games (I removed it to play FO4 a few years back).
---
A buddy and I run sneak sets and a bunch of sneak perks. 7/10 times we can grab the pylons, get on the building and stealth and he doesnt see us so he doesnt shoot us so we just stim through the hp drain... ofcourse 3/10 times, something pulls us out of stealth and we get melted. 
---
The troubleshooter is definitely a better option though.
---
What's up?
---
Just pointing out the irony of complaint that people complain and should leave. Luv ya!
---
Most servers will be full or will become full depending on how new the servers are and the the online trading community is as big as ever.
---
Fallout 1st is just a shady way for us to buy their atoms. The servers are free without the atoms. That’s the Bullshit behind it all. It is a frikin pay wall to get to private servers.
---
I can almost promise you options like these were on the table. I can also almost promise you, it came down to a "whats good for our private equity stakeholders" decision. And that drove the final decisions. JuiceHead has some good vids on this topic.
---
We are watching the slow, dying breaths of Bethesda under ZeniMax's private equity ownership. I hope the corpo fucks get their due when this all inevitably crashes and burns. You can't just redeem yourself after this kind of a clusterfuck.
---
Zenimax is basically Halcyon from TOW at this point.
---
Omg😂😂 Ik what you saying but I had to point this out someone has to say it. Now your complaining about my complaining about their complaining. I can do this all day.
---
The problem isn't the subscription nor is what comes with the subscription the problem is Bethesda has failed to earn the trust of the playerbase to produce quality content to warrant a subscription. ESO has a nearly identical subscription system which is probably where they took it from but ZOS has actually proven themselves by producing quality content for the game.
---
When designing a game you have to decide when a feature just isn't worth it. The invisible wall is inelegant, but your suggestion is just a waste of time to have to program and implement. 99% of players will hit the "rad-wall" and just turn around and that's it. And how often do you hit that wall? Most locations close to the edge of the map are still pretty far from it, so most normal players wouldn't ever run into the wall unless by accident or through random exploring. Overall, I just don't think this kind feature is worth it when it has such low use cases.
---
Well it has far more dialog than 76. There's plenty more similarities but your comment is just deliberately asinine.
---
Its still pretty good just more people running aroung flexing the robot
---
Done and done!
---
I get that Bethesda has to wade through folks playing on potatoes who don't know their ass from their elbow. But that's not everyone and that's not me. And it sounds like there's a nontrivial number of folks still crashing. Some of them youtubers, which isn't a good look.
---
Except these aren't even real servers. These are just random world instances that have already been used by other players and get shut off the second a Fallout First player isn't in them. You aren't even able to customize them in anyway. This is like the cheapest possible version of a "private" server and they're charging a minimum of $100 for it
---
Yea and thank you
---
Yes, there are still lots and lots of people playing.
---
Would you happen to still have that quad assaultron head?
---
I personally enjoy scavenging.Selling what i dont need,keeping what i do
---
It is a big part of the Fallout experience for me.
---
Point being,Infinite scrap stash would fundamentally ruin a key part of the game for me.
---
I will happily stay at a disadvantage,and continue with my daily scavenge  through the wastelands of Appalachia.
---
My argument doesnt need any more details, the model i describe worked fine in the past, still does, look at CDPR or Focus Home Interactive and companies that dont try to milk their playerbase dry.
---
Never apologize for warning others about a bug. Even if we don't like that people support this behaviour and rewards Bethesda for it with money, nobody deserves to loose progress due to a bug, Fallout First member or not. You probably helped a lot of people avoid this problem and that's what matters. 
---
It's sad that you were harassed for helping others. Honestly I was really salty at first, when I saw the bug I even enjoyed the idea of people who support this kind of cashgrab getting screwed over with bugs. But that's not your fault, no one deserves to suffer what Bethesda has done.
---
When I got over it and played the game again, the first thing I find after a minute is a guy with Ranger armor at my Camp. Not even buying just, staring at me while I go down the stairs and walk around him. For like ten seconds. I finally wave, he waves back, buys some stuff from my vendor then leaves. I can't hate someone just for buying it, it's Bethesda who should be targeted. Players I just disagree with.
---
I'd personally like it if they locked the tent and scrap box to the private servers. It just seems to game breaking to me. (in that it makes it to easy)
---
No, no one had to say it. Just the same as you say no one has to complain. You can't have it both ways. You have your opinion, I have mine.
---
You mean as a "survival" game? The survival part of the game ends up coming down to chugging a few waters and whatever food you feel like eating cause it's not rare whatsoever. What's left is honestly a very bare bones game with not much to do after the main quests which have always been where the strength of Bethesda games was. If they weren't going for a survival game what were they going for? 
---
A looter shooter? Cause you need interesting loot for that. 
---
In the literal sense it's barely even a role playing game (pay attention to the role part because everytime i bring this up nobody understands my point) because there's no actual role to play a part in anything, literally everyone's dead except other players. 
---
They kinda just left behind what made fallout popular and fun in 76. Choices that matter, interesting characters, plenty of side things to do.
---
You are right!!!!!
---
I will def jump in and help people. I do make it a point to visit the overseers camp when I login to a new game to see if anyone is there and then I will wave to them and say hello and ask if they need anything....
---
Yeah most of the people getting fallout 1st don’t care about other how it affects other players. They’re not villains twirling their mustaches saying “Yesss awesome, I want the haters to have to swallow more microtransactions and p2w mechanics”, after all. But they are affecting other players regardless.
---
you have private worlds to farm any junk u need
---
i got hacked 3 months ago, lost all my weapons,/aid/armor/junk/PA they changed my character perks points and no one from bethesda or any youtuber cared, i just keep playing and getting the stuff again
---
&gt; They absolutely should have allowed scrap to be stored infinitely in a separate storage without paying.
---
but then how would Zenimax executives afford their third house in the Caymans?
---
Any tips for starting out?
---
Sorry, I'm new to Reddit. But at least I can spell... By the way, I agree with your sentiment- I want to be back to remember how people said it would never happen.
---
 I'd personally like it if they locked the tent and scrap box to the private servers. It just seems to game breaking to me. (in that it makes it to easy)
---
Or even better different flare ammos that have different purposes that you can load into the same gun
---
Yep. The problem isn't the subscription or any part of the subscription, the problem is Bethesda hasn't earned a subscription yet. When they start pumping out good content like ESO, WoW, FFXIV, or many other sub games then they can ask for a subscription. If they start showing they are capable of making quality content and fixes I'll subscribe but not until then.
---
Literally my thoughts I just grab woodchucker and packrat and run the entire west side of the map.
---
I still have a 2* w/ +50% vats crit damage.
---
&gt; Everyone in Adventure should be on even footing.
---
Amazes me that something so obvious needs to be pointed out to Bethesda, almost a year after release. This should have been their ethos since day one.
---
That's because it's not a Blizzard game.
---
I'm using a wireless keyboard and pointing device, but they're Logitech's proprietary dongle, not bluetooth. So...usb. Mic/headphones are wired too.
---
I think I did actually disable bluetooth altogether when trying to shake this out, but that didn't change anything.
---
Their server renting system is worse, I’ll look up the meshing issue maybe I just don’t know it by that name. I have friends who play and I made friends playing it. I promise even with basic Comcast internet in the states it runs with no more problems than 76. They never tried to call or promise anything more though. That’s why I personally to hold them in the kind of scorn or distrust I might for Fallout 76
---
It sounds to me like you are trying to discourage such action. I would encourage it personally. And it might be easier than expected.
---
I think the general hope is that the squeaky wheel will get the grease.
---
To some extent, the sub can behave as an influencer that sways general opinion, and in turn forces a company to make concessions.
---
However, raw sales data doesn’t lie and presents true public opinion. It’s a “behind closed doors” situation.  The rock band Nickelback is a perfect example. No one seems to like them, yet they’re still playing huge venues and have major label recording contracts.
---
Gud forbid their quarterly profits be 0.01% lower...
---
You can voice your opinion and I fully support that right... now support others right to have an opinion. 
---
Instead we literally see people trashing others who bought it with snide comments... 
---
$100... so what... I’d rather spend $100 on something I enjoy and my friends and family enjoy for entertainment than to buy something no one likes. 
---
It’s smoother for multiple reasons like no one at all jumping worlds, joining, rejoining, anyone doing glitches or duping with the cleavers... that’s just a few. 
---
Want smoother? Create a post about all of that and give your opinion on that... see how that goes since that’s literally a few reasons many people and Bethesda have brought up. 
---
Oh yeah 6 people on a world instead of 24... maybe lower the amount of people?
---
&gt;Apart from nuclear winter I don’t see this game as very competitive
---
So then the p2w aspects of this game would definitely not be centered around combat thank you for illustrating that.
---
People seem to be so stuck on that, ignoring that the game isn't just about killing stuff and winning doesn't just include killing faster.
---
Sweet, pg&amp;e says I should have power tomorrow lol.
---
Sadly i switched to PC
---
That is too cute! So nice to hear about folks teaching their kiddos and explaining everything to them. It’s nice that she spoke and waved. I had one poor low level run from me... Chick playing as a male character and usually I don’t use voice cause someone harassed my female character (crouched with their face into her skirt several times, bothered me) I gave him a warning shot into the head with a shotgun and dashed off he finally quit following me. Anyhow, the poor person I’d found crouched and was ready to attack and I was like, dude I’m not here to hunt you just wanted to know if you needed ammo I don’t think he did, I just scared the crap out of him, poor guy... I also would leave stuff if I stumbled across someone’s base, before they marked them all on the map (thanks for that Bethesda I liked my semi hidden base near Camden park. if you could fix it so I don’t fall to my doom teleporting there though...). If you need any help and are on ps4 Pm me and we’ll exchange gamer tags then feel free to tag me! if I’m online alone I’ll happily help out if you need anything. My guy’s not the highest level but I can still hold my own... You also reminded me of a story, I was running around in game and get like shoulder checked by this high level player, I was like oh crap. We started chatting somehow and he was the sweetest thing, we added each other and run together when time permits.. I need to see how he is. Also someone got cheated out of all his stuff, a younger guy my fiancé chatted with him and told me about it I was like we’re setting him up, so we helped him out he found us wedding rings in-game cutest thing ever. Ugh also had some encounters of higher levels being douches... do have a fun story of getting back at some people who harassed my friend and wrecked her base.
---
Or maybe level restrict it to 50 or maybe 100 since by then you are swimming in caps and can pretty much just buy whatever scrap as the need arises.
---
Move on bro it's just a game. Life is much more unfair.
---
Jesus christ
---
Would you be willing to sell?
---
The point i was trying to get at is, like the 2 games I used as an example, who knows what the future of this game may hold. They may fix it finally.
---
Scrap every weapon and armour piece you get from rewards / containers / enemies which you don’t want to keep , this means you unlock modifications for said items and also get easy materials.
---
&gt;
---
Also when you get rewarded or find a plan , be sure to actually go to the Notes section of the pipboy and click LEARN.
---
If you’re carrying a lot of junk items , be sure to click SCRAP ALL JUNK at any workbench and then store it in your stash asap.
---
 I dunno ... America. Is that too broad? I like Bethesda for several reasons and they have done nothing I find to be a problem.
---
Get the pharma farma perk. It will help you with getting more healing items
---
Oh man, a expansion with voice actors, npcs, and dialogue trees?!? Man, Bethesda certainly is going all with the big guns with this expansion. Its not like those things exist IN EVERY OTHER RPG!!!
---
But seriously, the fact that you think the bare minimum for any rpg is a now a massive overhaul just shows how low the bar for quality has dropped. Fully voiced npcs and dialogue trees should have been a thing from day one. This is not them making a second game, this is them finishing the first one they released half-finished.
---
I'm not trying to discourage it so much as manage expectations. This isn't coming out any time soon.
---
I’m still buying fallout first.
---
There is a static spawn for those.
---
I couldn't find "Sirligh85" but i found "Sirlight85".  Is that you?
---
Hey thanks for the constructive and non-hostile feedback! 👍
---
&gt;16x the detail.. if fallout 4 was 1080p,  that would presume 16k 
---
What? Resolution is not about details. Compare a typical room in Fallout 3 vs Fallout 4 vs Fallout 76, amount of details grows with each game. In FO3 you had walls, maybe a table and chair, or empty shelf. In FO4 you got a bit more, there was something on the shelf, more furniture. FO76 adds even more to that. 
---
It's most likely comparing best/worst case scenarios of ie interior cell object count in FO76 vs FO4 and also a good phrase to make a fun out of, ie. showing low res textures and quoting "16 times the details" but in long run Appalachia is more detailed environment than Commonwealth or Capital Wasteland and you can't deny it. 
---
All that engine improvements that Told sold us at E3 can be seen in game, they are not spectacular, some are subtle, but they are there.
---
But after all that, I've stopped playing about 10 months ago, when I discovered it's nothing more than Borderlands pew pew paired with Fortnite-level microtransactions. I was waiting for that future of this game, which kinda looked slowly better but now is shattered to pieces.
---
I guess it depends on how many people are on the public servers and where you go. I usually don't have any competition.
---
Love it. Leta me grind at my own pace.
---
*Farm blood leaf and soot flowers;
---
*make healing salve;
---
*stash stims away if you don't feel like wasting them;
---
*spam the stimpak button even when it looks like you don't need it (the healing salve has the same hotkey);
---
*equip perk that reduces melee damage, just in case it decides to melee you.
---
And, given your death osn't instantaneous, the mysterious saviour perk can get you back on your feet even if you got reduced into a pile of ash.
---
I don't use chems in my builds because I find them too unreliably to plan with them, but if you have damage reducing chems use them.
---
Problem... ESO plus subscriptions has the same connections as Fallout 76. The ESO model is very close to the same as the 1st. 
---
ESO is successful and by all accounts in my opinion seeing all the scrap boxes alone, looks to be successful so far, we’ll see. 
---
ESO you also have to pay for upgrades, DLC’s are free however upgrades are not. 
---
This also isn’t the first of its kind... plenty of other paid services and subscriptions are out there and they’re growing.
---
Precisely. They didn't give cosmetics a fair shot before putting in convenience items.
---
Yea its cuz you guys know it's true
---
Or, you could utilize some self control and not splurge when you shouldnt.
---
 Thanks. If you thought a minute, you might come to the conclusion this is exactly why I do this.
---
 If there was not this huge "YOU MUST LEAVE THE LEGNDARIES UNKILLED FOR ALL THE LITTLE GUYS IN THE BACK" I would not do this. ;)
---
Ok, enjoy it. I was on a private server today it works pretty well even for being on a PS4.
---
Oh and don't listen if someone insults you just because you buyed fallout first, it's your money.
---
You do you.
---
True, but the map in fo4 seems really small now .
---
How much?
---
Lots of people in the Fallout fanbase was alienated by Fallout 76. That's why Fallout 76 sold so little copies and went on sale within a week or 2.
---
Can you explain to me why the 'target audience' and genre of the game have ANYTHING to do with monetizing the game and supporting server/staff? 
---
You need to get your thought process back into the 'relevant' category because you just brought up points that have absolutely nothing with what I wrote and in no way undermine my points.
---
TLDR  just because you have a thought you don't need to share it with the world
---
 You pay for Amazon Prime.
---
Never lied, nothing is pay to win about this. You’re just parroting the echo chamber and aren’t worth returning to this comment chain.
---
It’ll be in the atom shop within the next 6 months... the cost? Your sooooooooul
---
This is my gripe as well.  I feel like the atom shop has potential but Bethesda keeps putting out shitty skins and designs.  Not to mention most things are ridiculously overpriced.
---
Shills mad go into your own servers boot lickers
---
Hey cool story. Have fun with Outerworlds! 😁
---
Yeah that’s where you’re wrong. I’m not talking about the story. I’m talking about the experience.
---
The definition of Win: be successful or victorious in (a contest or conflict).
---
what contest or conflict is involved with scrap boxes?
---
Is that not what social media is for?
---
Yes they have and it took a little bit to get them right. People need to give this game a chance.
---
Absolutely keep it a dude in dresses.  Always fun to rock it
---
&gt; We're disappointed in players like yourself that give Bethesda money for non-cosmetics, since it reduces the chance that Bethesda will reverse-course and make everything free (like they originally said).
---
Well said. A lot of people here cares about the future of the game, and watching the collector bot, fridge, and now scrap box, tent and private servers behind a paywall is not a good sign.
---
Consider the fact that there is a massive experiment going on to c how far gamers will be pushed before leaving the game behind I don't believe anyone has fully found a foolproof way to monitize a payed product where everyone walks away happy and I agree eso is doing well and is fairly well made imo fallout first is alright but as you see in bo4 and other games there is a growing danger of paying for a beta game so to speak then paying.for the rest of the game while also paying to look cool and or paying to be apart of certain aspects of the game
---
Enjoy what u get. As a child i grew up playing Nintendo Sega games and when I FINNALY beat those games I wish I had more of what I got outta it. Modern games today fulfill that.
---
Every time i commented on losing my scrap, I’d get down voted or basically called a lair. People posting they wanted video proof. Yeah like I’m going to go do a video just to make you believe me. I lost 100 flux but it literally took me a few hours to get everything else back.
---
&gt; Don’t fault players that enjoy 76 for supporting the developers by buying First because we’re keeping the lights on for all the people that don’t pay.
---
"we'r suporting them" "keeping the lights on for others ! " , no you aren't. Take of your "shiny armour" since it's made of cardboard.
---
Even if you weren't paying they would keep the game up since they are making money with the cash shop. Your just extra money.
---
By using your logic , I'm keeping you playing games cause I "support" nvidia/ati/intel and keep the lights on ! I didn't BUY a product , I support the gpu maker when I bough my gpu , you should thank me, right ???!... lol 
---
Your not "supporting" Samsung when you buy a samsung TV , even if you buy what is perceived as a very bad price/quality one ! You just bough a product.
---
Feel free to enjoy your game , it's your money , and even if I think something isn't worth it , maybe it is for you ( and that's what matters in the end ). If you think you are getting good value of it , more power to you !
---
But don't pretend your some "saviour"/"investor"/"supporter", You aren't giving money , you aren't getting money back out of your investment, you aren't buying stocks or investing into the company ... you just paid for a service, that's it.
---
It sounds pretty slick! I wish fo 76 had been better. I love the IP so much! Actually stole my own fo shelter sign from an old post office in town.
---
Occasionally
---
If you want to enjoy the game fine. But keep in mind that by paying for Fallout 1st you are making the experience for everyone who doesn't want more features locked off behind paywalls  worse. By buying Fallout First, you are telling Bethesda that you want them to lock more features behind more and more expensive paywalls.
---
Nice reply, thanks. I ask Why can't the fix for the reasons you mentioned be something provided by Bethesda or set up already? Why should I have to pay for that? I don't understand why people think that's ok or acceptable. It's a multiplayer game and the solution is to have less players on? How  backwards is that? Why don't they fix duping? Joining rejoining? I'm playing an early access game with 90-100 people on the server. People coming and going makes no difference. To accept a sub par product that they then charge money to get back to or near par? That is unacceptable. I keep posting because I cannot understand how people are fine with that. I play this game tons, nearing 600 hours so maybe this is just for people that got the game for $20 bucks and are under 100 hours. I have no friggin clue.
---
They left them in a scrapbox
---
I gave you an upvote, might be a comment people don't like, but bethesda does  it to themselves. Vault raids were left messed up to delete everything off a character forever with no urgency. Scrap boxes lose some peoples stuff and its patched in less than 24 hrs.
---
My son you must repent for your whaleish ways by scourging yourself in a email to Kotaku and your Congressman. You must tell them how the whore of Bethesda enticed a once pious and vestal member of the PC Master race to part with his shekels.
---
Dont let anyone decide what has value to you, you can decide what to spend your own money on.  No one should be shaming the players who buy into the service, it is not their fault.  Shaming the end users is not going to solve their own problems.
---
Praise him!
---
As you walk farther out it gets darker and darker. Then “Oh your finally awake, you were trying to cross the border and walked right into that imperial ambush.”
---
My my my. Enough to care to make a comment, and even moreso to reply. Its okay you know, you can be petty here.
---
I want free content for life! /s
---
"Well I first met him by stabbing him." Well, kudos for honesty! lol Is this how you always meet new people?
---
You really did make his day. Did he even know his junk dropped??
---
Sure, but only on private servers since obviously the public ones can't handle it
---
You hit the jackpot with a spoon! Not once got anything from one
---
Because it makes everyone else's experience worse. More people buy Fallout First, the more Bethesda will want to lock more features behind a paywall.
---
I thought it was for cats and food pics?
---
Ty. I don't know why I get down votes. Maybe I sound shitty, but the points are valid. This is a pay to fix the problems subscription.
---
**Advantage (noun)** 
---
**any state, circumstance, opportunity, or means specially favorable to success, interest, or any desired end:**
---
And it only has to exist to be considered advantage, whether you agree(use) it or not.  
---
For examples, you can see my other comment. I am sure you know which one.
---
Geforce Now has had problems updating fallout 76 for months.  Every so many patches, something goes wrong and it reverts back to an older version in their system; so when you login, it needs to download the latest update and install it, which usually take about 20-25 mins (every time you log in).  They had this problem back in September, and the game went down for 3 weeks while they were fixing it... it came back just before the 50% off legendary sale, but broke again after the Fallout 1st update.
---
Psn gokhan3rdo add me 😏
---
Honestly man how many people do u know of hand that have self control when going shopping or clothes shopping? That's the deal some people won't have any issues but a lot of people will it's the idea of giving someone there lottery winnings a sum of money more than they had they go spend it feels good suddenly it's gone but they want that feel good still so they continue going till they run out
---
But never post YouTube links haha
---
Thanks for the link. I needed to find something to spend my refund money on 😅😂
---
Just play Outer Worlds. Hell, trade Fallout76 for it.
---
If you do decide to pick it up, I do hope that even if you decide in the end it’s not for you, that you have some fun.  That said I do have a few suggestions to hopefully maximize your odds:
---
1.) Do not treat this game as an RPG.  Do not compare it to any other fallout, Outer Worlds, etc.  Treat it as a survival game like The green Hell, 7 days to die, the mist, even Minecraft.  The whole story was that after you left vault 76 you are here to rebuild America.  Go out with the goal of collecting all the cool camp objects.  Get the frog in a jar.  Try to get the decontamination arch, try to get the best building sets of Metal or brick walls. Same with food recipes - See if you can find the recipe and make Megasloth Tenderloin, make yourself some s’mores, learn to make Vintage Nukashine. 
---
2.) Interact with other people, if you can stomach it - role play.  It might be a bit harder depending on the level of everyone on the server, but I still see low level characters.  Be silly - try being a door to door salesman, knocking on the doors of peoples camps (when they are there).  Role play as a responder and try to question anyone who is dressed in raider clothes. Try taking over workshops or working with people who are taking them over.  Even just a couple of people in your friends list can really change the dynamic of the game, and role playing can really make it fun. 
---
3.) Go slow.  Bethesda may not be the best with narrative storytelling, but they still have some top notch world building.  Notice the placements of skeletons and think what happened when these people died?  There are some unmarked quests even in the game, such as (small spoiler) the guy in the fridge early on in the game.  You can get a holotape that directs you to some treasure, but it’s never marked on the map. 
---
4.) Do challenges. You can earn a good chunk of atoms (that you can then use to buy some stuff) from the daily, weekly and set challenges.  Even some as simple as “level up while in a workshop” encourages you to play the game slightly different.
---
But overall, I think coming into the game with a different mindset on what genre it is and trying to interact with people will make a world of difference
---
There are crews out there that help with the grind of public lobbies, and using those crews it hasn't been too difficult for me to take advantage of events like double sales weeks. With 2 full large warehouses on double sales weeks you can sell them and make over 20 million but I agree they did make that game into a very hard grind.
---
Thanks for continuing to lower the bar of quality for this industry! :)
---
This...they really need to throw those of us who preordered a bone.
---
What? You can get stuff form them? Here I thought they were just there for the look of em
---
Ok, just have to keep at it
---
I was expecting everyone to boycott it but almost every camp I visited had a scrap box. I think most people purchased the one month though.
---
Find a resource node to put your base on. Water sources or lead early game are essential.
---
Solid answer. I'll keep the porch light on. You and your dog are welcome.
---
I wanna say the common comparison is going to a movie. Generally 2h at around $10/ticket for an adult (ignoring the obligatory overpriced snacks etc). 
---
That is $5/hour. 
---
Say you paid $60 for FO76 and have 200 hours. That is $0.30/hour. 
---
Of course this will vary wildly between each person as their definition of value and their times worth will be different. But I even stupidly sprung for the $80 tricentennial edition and have around 800 hours in this game. That is $0.10/hour. To me that is more than fine.
---
Download mist play grind some shitty mobile games till you get enough point to afford a $15 xbox live giftcard.
---
That wasn't because it alienated anyone, that was over scathing reviews, and people being uncertain how an online Fallout would play.
---
Also, please, PLEASE improve your grammar. It just takes practice, and it's really not that difficult.
---
Got a Rad-X from one once.
---
There is lag, but once you start at the correct time, you can complete them even without sprinting. Only Camp Venture punishes mistakes if you don't sprint.
---
1 hour of range time = 100 bucks (20 for range fee, and 80 bucks for the ammo you will use)
---
1 hour of lane rental at a local bowling alley = 15-20 bucks (plus shoe rental)
---
1 2 hour movie = 15 bucks a ticket (this doesnt count snaks and soda)
---
1 12 hour day at disney world - 115 dollars (not including any food or souveneirs)
---
1 12 hour day at Cedar Point = 72 dollars (again, no food or gifts)
---
1 ticket to an NFL game 100-550$ (3 hours)
---
For most fallout players 200+ hours for 100 bucks/year, assuming 2 years of play (100 bucks for 400 hours)
---
For entertainment hours per price paid, Fallout is still a damn good deal, and one of the best you will find.
---
So some people will spend hundreds of dollars per hour.
---
Name checks out, have a laugh lmao
---
No problem man. And hey, feel free to keep providing such valuable feedback, you’re truly a gem for this subreddit. Wouldn’t want to lose your thoughts to the sheeple.
---
Thanks for the kind words. Im still sporting my atomshop bomber jacket &amp; space helmet but i grinded challenges for those. Im a courier on the market, thats my favorite part of the game.. just helping others &amp; having a good time. The games about working together not flexing on others, theres always been obnoxious ppl here &amp; there that behavior just kind of highlights it unfortunately
---
&gt; Except these aren't even real servers.
---
Most "servers" you rent online aren't "real" either. A VPS is basically a virtual machine running alongside other VPSes on a single machine. In fact Bethesda themselves aren't even getting real servers because like most "cloud" servers Amazon AWS is a virtual machine sitting on top of one or more physical machines.
---
Actual physical servers are expensive. A few years back when I was playing around with private server files for MMOs I looked into the cost of physical hardware. A very basic server was a few hundred dollars while a good server with frequent backups was easily in the thousands per month.
---
&gt; You aren't even able to customize them in anyway.
---
That's fine. I can't think of a single thing I would want to change from vanilla (I do mod most of their games but almost always just non-gameplay changes like the UI). I'm perfectly fine with just being seggregated from the people I don't want to play with.
---
&gt; This is like the cheapest possible version of a "private" server and they're charging a minimum of $100 for it
---
My expectations (based off of my career of game development, past experiences hosting private servers, and multiple MMOs) were way more realistic than most people here. I fully expected the service to be $15/mo. That it's only $8.33/mo ($100/yr) made me happy not upset.
---
Speaking of expectations I fully expected them to break a few things, and that it wouldn't be worthwhile to subscribe for a few months, and it looks like they proved me right. Bethesda is totally predictable. Anyone who expects anything from them to work the first time is either fooling themselves or has never played one of their games.
---
And people who don't pay just deleting this game. So you keep the lights for yourself
---
I think the simplest fix for PP would be allowing us to heal the animals with stimpack diffusers.
---
Yep. Once you knock them down you can search them like any other corpse.
---
I was going to joke and said buy them but...it's the sad truth.
---
*and he was never heard of again...*
---
Sure, but Fallout Winter will be an additional 12.99 and there will be a bug where each snowflake counts as 100 large items in your camp while randomly deleting 1 item per minute from your stash.
---
Better luck next time kid
---
*teleports away*
---
This sub gave it alot of a hate, but the people actually playing are buying it. So, things like this are going to keep coming.. saddly. There really isn't anything else we can do since alot of people aren't on board with boycotting not buying it
---
It's only plausible to those who believe the world is controlled by oligarchy of shape shifting reptilian pedophile aliens.
---
For sure. I was poor growing up so we couldn't afford to buy games except for like Christmas. But we would hit the local rental place every weekend. I spent my formative years with bleeding thumbs learning how to scrape every last penny out of a video game.
---
The way FO76 has been handled definitely plays into my feelings on purchasing future titles. Brand and reputation means a lot and right now they are struggling. They really better work on redeeming themselves and this game. I'm not alone in my disappointment and frustratingly enough I really love much of what FO76 is, and so do many others. That's where the anger comes from........Wasted Potential!!
---
FOR $60! None of us for refunds if we overpaid! No thanks, no atoms, no nothing.
---
God damn right memorizing every cheat code lol
---
Where did he go? ◉_◉
---
I just thought they were annoying little decorations for the world.  I never knew they had anything in them, over a year and never bothered trying
---
I don't care if it's against the eula at this point. It's not like they'd know or be able to stop it if it's localhost anyway because they can't ban you if you aren't connecting to their account system anyway, and if you make the emulator open source, good luck to bethesda trying to get that horse back in the barn.
---
What is ironic? You may have a misconception 😁
---
So when I re-located the "stored" tab shows various blueprints.. I moved these to my storage to replace the items where I see fit and half of them were missing. No explanation other than my stuff disappeared.
---
China is a huge market with very strict rules about what can and cannot be shown.  Bethesda isnt the first and they wont be the last.
---
If anyone insults me that’s petty so I’m just going to say all I hear is broke😂😂 I’m kidding that’s mean😂😂
---
I have a job. 13 bucks is nothing to me.  But come on man. Just look at the state the game shipped in. Yes improvements were made but there's still way more that needs to be done.  This game has no business asking anyone for a subscription fee.
---
Have u finished most of the non daily/weekly ones already? If so id say no.
---
I'm chalk your cheese... comprehende? Sometimes I just blurt abuse at things I don't like.
---
Yeah there would be zero connectivity towards bethesda or amazon webservices. I would open source it as a ya know... research project :)
---
Thanks! I was wondering about this too - I may throw $10 down to check it out and get the armor.
---
They are great for rads
---
16K is 64 times higher resolution than 1080p.
---
1080p = 1920\*1080=2073600
---
16K = 15360\*8640=132710400

132710400/2073600=64
---
And resolution isn't what they even meant by 'detail', though the statement is still dubious no matter how you look at it.
---
It sounds like a reasonable idea!  Which is why you can bet that either Bethesda will ignore it if they can't figure out a way to charge you for it.
---
You don’t have to be here reading it either, Chumbo!
---
Most of the people I know actually.
---
Maybe it is a culture thing.  I was taught to save, not burn everything I have on frivilous BS.
---
&gt;So some people will spend hundreds of dollars per hour.
---
We call those people "boat owners". (Former boat owner)
---
You're right but with China making all these businesses publicly kiss their metaphorical ring it makes me wonder. Not trying to start a red scare. Just wondering if the community would boycott over that
---
Mmos have been charging people to pay for decades. Theres also been several games that have been released very similarly to F76. Some arent even big on the scene in english speaking countries but are massive in Korea etc.
---
The extreme salt comes from the fact that Fallout and Bethesda were nerd heaven/apple like relationship to alot of ppl (just look at the following to Todd before F76) and now that relationship has been blackened similarly to what EA and countless others do.
---
Works fine for me on my sniper build on PS4
---
Are dead horses needing a beating?
---
Ya I think it's only a railway rifle bug. It's working on my fixer.
---
wow, really nice, good work :)
---
If patchbot is reliable they are claiming over a million people are playing still.
---
Exactly, you have a point
---
Thankyou!:)
---
I haven't, where do I find them?
---
But now the folks who created OW work for Microsoft.
---
Don't sass me.
---
Your account is 1.5 yeas old with -3 karma and 3 posts separated by 6 months, all on Fallout 76. The very nature of your account is what spam ad accounts look like. You are very likely a spam account controlled by Bethesda to monitor and manipulate the subreddit.
---
I’ve gotten a few calls from them.
---
Edit: Caps. I meant caps. Getting calls from dead scorched would be scary.
---
You can spend 10 bucks to buy them. 
---
or spend 13 bucks and get 1650 and some neat items and skins.
---
Check in the Combat section, there are some you may be close to with regular gameplay:  scrap power armor components, kill scorched with..., mod shotguns, ect.
---
Currently use an AMD Ryzen 1700, which is similar to the First Generation Threadripper 1900x. Unfortunately had serious stability problems including crashes, BSOD, and pausing during the game before finding this advice before to which I slightly amended. Hope this solves your issue.
---
The solution for the systematic pausing at Charleston was discussed in an another thread so I don't take any credit for the answer. The issue is down to the Infinity Fabric design of the Ryzen CPU and how it bridge Hex and Octo Core Processors. Load up the game as normal, press CTRL-ALT+Delete and select Task Manager. OR Windows Key right click Windows Icon (Bottom Left Icon Windows 10) and select Task Manager. Inside Task Manager select details tab - find the Fallout.exe. Right Click the Fallout.exe, and select set affinity and untick CPU 8- 15 or leave ticked 0-7 CPU's. Press OK and continue with the game. This should resolve the majority of the Freezes.
---
Found the original thread so please give credit to this user - The solution is discussed here: https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/af9qav/fix_for_0_fps_or_crashing_to_desktop_in/
---
There is plenty of role playing. It's just possibly not your type of role playing.
---
I've come across hunters, raiders, crazy clown players and really nice cultists. Your role in the world is what you make it. You can be friendly, you can be mean, you can even be something in between.
---
You can be a heavy gunner in an awesome 4 person fireteam, or you can be that melee lady with only a mask on. You can give aid to those who need it, or you can choose to be the reason they need aid.
---
All of those are roles. You seem to not to want to make your own, but would rather play a preset role in a story. But thats your preference, it doesn't mean fo76 lack roles.
---
I've always heard that owning a boat is awesome for your friends...
---
Dude that's awesome in all honesty most people ik will spend there way to only having enough to barely make it by paycheck to paycheck but in all honesty those are the people being targeted here
---
Because its a fo76 sub you asshat! Anyway whats an egg gotta do with anything lol?
---
My opinion contrare to the hate you see here. Im always seeing busy servers etc....
---
Who you lumping me in with lol I am all for paid DLC and would love it
---
I like that this sub just upvotes the same post over and over now
---
Yes... That's true. But I really don't wanna give them my money. There really should be a way to get them easier. But ah well. It's just a game in the end
---
Never attribute to malice that which is adequately explained by stupidity - Hanlon's Razor.

In Challenges on the ingame menu screen.
---
1) ESO is also probably the only one that didn't crash and burn. Secret Worlds is essentially dead at this point and most MMOs have gone free to play. 
---
2) But again, most MMOs are honest and upfront when it comes to their microtransactions. Fallout 76 isn't.
---
3) Yeah, FFXIV was so broken that they literally had to reboot the entire game to fix it and make it successful. That doesn't counter my claim that most MMOs aren't broken, especially since FFXIV is not only one of the only examples of a broken at launch MMO that was able to recover, but also only became really successful after they put in a lot of work to fix it.
---
4) Even ignoring that Randy gets a ton of crap for being a massive liar, Borderlands 3 is not only not a MMO but is also far more consumer friendly when it comes to its moneziation than most live service AAA games these days. That also still doesn't counter my point about Fallout 76.
---
5) Oh no, how dare I, a massive Fallout fan, want Fallout 76 to be a good and honest product like previous Fallout games. I should have realized that I must fully accept everything Bethesda does and never criticize them in order to interact with this holy fandom.
---
I tested it. You are wrong. Bug happens today, even with a non explosive shotgun. At close range.
---
It cost me $23 to see Endgame and the entire movie had already been spoiled for me.
---
But it isn’t and fallout first has brought in a lot of income so it likely isn’t going to change
---
Yeah, let's see. I don't really need it that much. Got bills to pay tho... if I could I would!
---
To the cringe
---
Hopefully soon
---
Alright thanks
---
The bullying will stop once they start thinking like the others.
---
Oh
---
I remember saving up money for what seemed like a year to buy NFL Football on the NES for $80. Words can not describe what a massive steaming pile of crap that game was. It was essentially unplayable, as many NES games were.

On PS4 you go to the map screen then press the right arrow to see a list of challenges that mostly reward you with atoms.

Yes this is true but in all honesty they are beginning to experiment more blatantly across larger audiences to c how much they can pull from the communities it's becoming a bigger deal to do it and most companies look to c how others do it then mimic it while pushing the envelope to c if they can do it better wich is why we got some of the nonsense we do now

Re uploaded link
---
I would kiss Todd Howard's feet if it is but I doubt it.
---
Ahh, I see! Thank you!! If I grind these I might actually be able to get it!! Yaay
---
Lol that was great
---
I get that. Some guy (lvl 200 or so) followed me(lvl 12) to each of the workshops I had claimed and tried to pvp me on all of them. And once I finally got the upper hand on him he tried to give me all of his legendaries
---
Swalesey82
---
69, of course
---
Yes. Thank you!
---
Reading this as I play a video game is comical. I paid $20 for the game and spent $12.99 for one month. But omg I'm "killing gaming". Go yell at the fuckers who purchased this shit pre-order then get back to me.
---
I’m level 25 in the game. These days all the higher level people I come across seem to go around and bully lower level players like me. I have a reflex now when I meet them and get attacked to where I quickly log out before they finish the job and take my stuff. It’s really ruining the game experience for me.
---
I really wish people didn’t go around attacking others in adventure mode, regardless of level differences, and just focus on the story and being a bro to each other.
---
* When it came out I loved the fallout franchise enough to get the power armor edition.
---
Not sure why this was downvoted, but have an upvote.
---
who is tom howard?
---
I bet you got an F- in human kindness. Cool story mate.
---
Same can be said for all events. Mind you there is no hint and tips from B in game that tells you the best approach. Ah well on my private server we get 3-6+ legendaries on some events, cause theres no trigger happy uninforned players. Uranium fever can net you at least 3 legendaries if done right.
---
Or the person with a different opinion about microtransactions then yours.
---
My bad Typo Todd Howard !
---
Todd would have a fit if there was a free copy of Skyrim in the game.
---
they should have already made the map bigger and maybe even a 2nd map for year one but its 76. it has to fail
---
Oh sorry I should have mentioned I havent played since just before the ps4/pc port of GTA came out, soI shouldnt have given my stance on that since there were like 100 content updates.
---
I just remember getting something abysmal amounts of currency from activities until I was gifted a few mil for some mistake the devs made
---
I'm a pretty big fan of Gunnm/Alita, of which I had never heard of before the movie came out in February.
---
I must just love underdog productions, cause I was already well into 76 at the time as well. Both were surrounded by a certain level of hate &amp; extreme Fandom. 
---
Must've seen it 4-5 times in theaters heh. That cost me as much if not more than 76 &amp; have a few ticket stubs to show for it. Then bought the blu-ray after it was released. Two Steelbook, actually. 
---
I suppose my math above doesn't account for what one values their time at, but that's a personal number &amp; one I've never really considered for myself. If I'm enjoying what I'm doing it's not even a factor, so I dunno.
---
A better comparison would be gamepass. Has a shit ton of games and it's less. Be hard to argue fo1st over gamepass if you had to choose. 
---
All Bethesda needed to do was do a $9.99 monthly with a $60 yearly subscription and let everyone get the tent for free. People would have still been pissed but there would be something for everybody. Even as a paying player I'd be super happy if the service was a few bucks cheaper and non-paying players got something.
---
I mean, anyone with a bloodied setup is hard to kill. Ive been testing and retesting mine, and while using stimpacs and quantums im pretty invincible - for 3 minutes.
---
But nothing beats the satisfaction of pulling one from a machine man! And I think they are different. One is whole and one is a slice.
---
Yup. It's already happening. Had a guy show up in my private server through the add friend glitch and he invited 4 people over. I had no idea what was going on because I was managing workshops, next thing I know someone launched a fucking nuke at my camp which is next to the munitions factory while I was idle making dinner :/
---
I think its great. If you like the game and the people you play with, do it and ignore the ignorance on reddit and learn from experiences of your own, dont be mad about bugs but submit tickets and make it better and continue not complaining on reddit and garnering opinions about the game.
---
So Fallout 76 gets reviewed poorly(both by critics and customers) and sells terribly in comparison with the franchise, and that doesn't even slightly hint towards people feeling alienated by this game? Really? 
---
Also, what was bad with my grammar in my previous post. I'll admit that I can sometimes make mistakes but I don't see how my previous post was so bad that you had to point it out.
---
Jesus what did you do
---
This all sounds reasonable....but not if Bethessa's aim were to make money out of FO1st. 
---
Your plan involves transferring some of the benefits of FO1st to everyone and then placing a crippling limitation on anyone still somehow interested in FO1st such that they could not actually benefit from having a private server. Who would buy that?
---
&gt;Ive met players old &amp; young, selfless kind hearted folk that would give you their last cap if you needed it.
---
lol I was one - of hopefully not *too* many redditors - that messaged you when I saw your post on MrMattyPlays, just glad you got hooked up. The reason I remembered your u/ was the post where you were hooking up the poorer players with The Fixer plans pre-purveyor sale, so you're unquestionably one of those kind hearted folk! I've met many more and if nothing else, the community is epic. Not this toxicity over 1st, but the desire to help others have fun, give them ammo and such is amazing! I love putting free purified water in my CAMP near the overseer's CAMP, dropping ammo and if the low level new vaultdweller doesn't run away too fast giving them some stimpaks, radaway and a deep pocketed piece or two
---
We got off on the bad foot... there’s a lot that doesn’t make sense however that’s with me assuming... for example. 
---
I have ESO also ESO plus (it was 50% off on Black Friday and I was given it as a gift) 
---
The world is massive and literally tons of players you see... not on a map but in all the larger areas. 
---
Playing both, I could actually see Fallout being as big as ESO... expansion into other areas or states in game on a larger map area since it was a world war. 
---
Duping and glitched... honestly I’m baffled when it comes to this and why Bethesda doesn’t at least terminate the accounts by doing a system query of who just accumulated 50k in steel and wood for example... or who has a stack of TSE’s in identical condition. 
---
I’ve even seen players admit in forums that they still have characters that weigh in at over 25,000 pounds... people say they can’t do anything... wrong... they can still sell items in their vending machines and they have others buy it for 0 to move... (player was bragging about it) . 
---
But nothing... meat cleaver glitch and mines is still going... even how to videos with players names clearly visible! Again nothing. 
---
Jumping worlds... this was also an issue brought up with others above for reasons of server issues... well in ESO for example fast travel (only one world) cost is reduced over time so a cool off period. 
---
They could have a cool off period in Fallout. Quit the world you get to wait. People may not like it but they chose to leave a world... now wait (if that helps). 
---
No one really knows what is going on behind the scene... no one even had a hint about the subscription at all... well I did 200+ days ago and people thought I was crazy or it wouldn’t happen... 
---
Take a look: 
---
Yeah, it is an RPG. A good one, like fallout. But thematically they only share the sci-fi roots.
---
This story right here? It's why I love the community so much it's so friendly and helpful made me love the game more
---
 r/PKOA is a great community that can help you with literally anything you need 
---
Also, we have players from all 3 platforms
---
Ah yes, but the end message we're supposed to glean from all this...  buy a subscription!
---
Ok fine. I just think its such a shame that Bethesda has fallen so far since the glory days of Skyrim and being a real fans studio that actually listened to us back in the day :(
---
I've received 1cap a few times. I'm guessing 1/100 searches.
---
Yeah that is pretty weird, never had that happen, but I don't move CAMP all that often
---
I would have fought tooth and nail through a questline to earn those cosmetics in game.
---
Paying for private servers is nothing new (the delivery on this "feature" has been heinous though), but the game is in dire need of some content - this would have solved that problem and gotten some people interested in the game again.
---
Depends on the weapon?
---
And well done for publishing how to dupe. I agree it should be patched but don’t encourage people!!
---
I think many are just bored honestly and lack of content for them or new things to do... its limited. That if anything is the reason people have taken a break from the game.
---
How could it be...it's so much better. Obsidian took a hot Dookie on Bethesda
---
They're putting F2P tactics in a paid game. I wish there was an easier way but sadly no.
---
No problem. I'll be here the next time you try arguing that npcs now suddenly require a massive amount of work to make :)
---
I also dont support the coke company being the most polluting company but I still drink soda. I dont support McDonald's using palm oil but I still eat there. Amazon treats their employees like garbage yet I buy from there.
---
Millions of people are hypocrites and support bad businesses.  But guess none of that matters cause it doesnt directly affect you.
---
Pointless. Most I would sell anything for is 9k
---
So much this. It is more of a traditional roleplaying experience than most electronic rpgs specifically because it has to be played in a more tabletop rpg sense. You have to act out what you are playing, not leave it up to clumsy dialogue chosen by the developer.
---
I think its a waste of money.
---
I want no part of it so i completely ignore it..
---
barring some disappointment once in a while when someone has a gun that would be great for me that I cant afford its worked well for me so far.. 
---
I dont sweat it.. I just keep on grinding
---
Absolutely doesn't help they set wastelanders back and dropped fallout 1st in it's place so to speak lol
---
Thanks to OP there's a Tom Howard working in custodial maintenance at Bethesda wondering WTF he did wrong.
---
i think it’s crazy haha, who pays real money for a weapon?! i cant imagine what kind of people sell them. i met a guy once that wanted 90k 5.56 rounds for an explosive shotgun, only had two stars, ridiculous
---
You care enough to comment twice about it.
---
One day you'll learn how to troll properly, smh.
---
calling this a monthly pass is outright deceptive. you can look at it many ways but a monthly pass it is not. it could be a monthly atom pack subscription or a monthly fee for access to private servers and other benefits (this is actually what it is but everyone spins it the other way to forward their bias. any other game with private servers do the same when it comes to hosting costs if not more.) 
---
its not going to change anything the way you guys are trying to go about it. the majority of the attempts that ive seen are people being extremely toxic about the situation, no one offers up any sort of actual CIVIL argument, and it ends up just devolving into a bunch of people calling others names. 
---
If you like the game then support it. if you dont like what they are doing then dont buy stuff from them.
---
i totally agree, it’s whack
---
oh thats true i never thought about pc modding
---
That’s commitment right there!
---
Ah, what a touching story, where do I insert my credit card to subscribe for more stories like this?
---
Needed to use the Stash box in Flatwoods, so wiped out the ghouls at the Red Rocket, and scored a lvl 1 / 1* Troubleshooters Pipe Revolver. Went past the motel, and got a lvl 5 / 1* Leather leg armor from a mole rat. 
---
Used them both for a while, and repaired them to 200%. Upgraded the pistol to a Hardened .45 cal Revolver Rifle, and bumped the armor to Studded / Deep Pocketed. 
---
Couple days later, FT'd to the Vault and dropped 200 ammo, Stims, food, Disease cures, to the first player that didn't run away. He had no mic, was fumbling the emotes, so "Jump if you can hear me" and "Jump if yes" was his side of the conversation. 
---
Also gave 10 minutes of "getting started" tips, and suggested when they outgrow them that they pass them on the same way. 
---
Player was burning up AP jumping down the hill like he already had Marsupial . . . 😀
---
Could be due to more testing and not releasing a “beta” or bugged experience... they want to make sure it’s strong and that it can’t be completed in a day.
---
If you think I am wrong please show me the correlation between the franchises. I am willing to bet they will all be more generic sci-fi or rpg elements than anything that makes the fallout universe what it is.
---
yep, i would be saving up ammo for the rest of my life to afford some of the guns i’ve seen
---
This is just PR doing damage control.
---
Imagine saying this on a FO76 sub lmao
---
It surely was intended to launch side by side. Why they didn't postpone 1st is beyond anyone though. They probably assumed there would be backlash but likely not to the extent its gotten.
---
That’s whatchu get for giving Bethesda money doe 🤷‍♂️
---
https://falloutfirst.com/
---
i don’t think i’ve ever sold anything over 5k before, i feel like i should help people have a fair deal, especially if it’s not something i’m gonna use and it’s just gonna sit there in my stash. people are crazy
---
Thanks again for the info. Based on this post I'm not sure what your take is on this paid sub. I still don't get why it has me so worked up.
---
Buy it, or don’t buy it...doesn’t matter to me. The developers can’t simply make everyone happy. The company needs to make money and they don’t make money when they are giving away free DLCs. Negative comments will always shine brighter than positive ones. Nobody ever talks about how smooth the server went today or yesterday. But people complain about this one time the server crashed on me while I was in the middle of doing one mission and had to start over. Or someone posts something negative that they heard happened. So if you solely want to go on the negative reviews....so be it, that’s on you. If that’s the case, I hope you never buy a car because it’s the same way on car forums. Everything in life has issues. Everyone wants wants wants, but nobody willing to give something up. Everyone should have unlimited stash space!!!!! But it better not effect my server stability. The moment it does, let the game bashers come back out and say the servers suck....when they don’t. I haven’t been disconnected from a server in months. I’ve had very minimal glitches in months. So again, buy it or don’t. Doesn’t affect my fun times with my friends whether I’m on a public or private server.
---
I thought that too, but there isn't an option to load different ammo types in this game, just mods. So I figured it could use flares in different flare guns with mods for specific purposes.
---
Just buy them man. Support fallout 1st
---
To this i agree I was just saying doesn't exactly help that they dropped a payed deal in place of it and something that doesn't exactly offer a different experience then we already have ofc solo by yourself is somewhat different but there's no difference in what you really do idk
---
&gt; Just wondering if the community would boycott over that
---
Probably not. I encourage boycotting as a form of protest on principle, but unfortunately, the percentage of the gaming community that pay attention and participate in things like this is vanishingly small, and the Chinese market is huge.
---
Can we launch nuke on bethesda office?
---
Oh most definitely agree with that.
---
How much do you know about doing business in China? It goes alot deeper than adding outfits in a game.
---
I also am curios. Why come on here and ask if "we" are gonna protest? This is why I asked how much you know about business in China.
---
If you knew the full extent, and were an empowered person you would have started ages ago, screw reddit for validation. I personally stopped buying Chinese made products a while back but its impossible for some things.
---
I usually keep things low. But I did sell the unstoppable monster for 9k.
---
So bothering someone for going something you don't like is ok?
---
Ok, that’s fine. Lots of people are upset. I sure am. I definitely won’t be buying any more Bethesda games without doing plenty of research beforehand. Elder Scrolls 6 was an insta buy console seller before... but not anymore.
---
Just don’t be a wanker about it. Don’t go around shitting on people just because they don’t see it your way. Literally all that does is make your point of view look foolish to them, which in turn makes the opposite point of view look less foolish. In other words, you’re actually helping Bethesda’s image by being this way. If you want to educate people, talk to them, don’t insult them.
---
Lol....very true if fo76 sadly.....it had such dam potential.  Tho I'll agree the interactions with the player base helped a ton.
---
i totally understand that though, i would pay 9k caps just to have it
---
I thought I read they actually hold useful stuff in NW? I haven't been on that mode since it dropped though.
---
Depends what challenges you’ve already done. There are a lot that are ~80 that aren’t too bad. How many do you currently have?
---
What would you expect to find out there? A randomly generated world map with nothing in it, perhaps?
---
A fool and his money...
---
Real money I would never do, but As long as it’s not duped I don’t care what anyone else does
---
For the record I still RP as a vault 76 survivor who picked up the BoS banner where they dropped it. There are still pockets of people playing roles out there. I am hoping private worlds will facilitate more of that type of play.
---
I can't wear power armor and troubleshooter's armor at the same time, can I?
---
Then why did you share this thought?
---
Challenges...
---
and most of the time, it probably is
---
"ALL CONTENT WILL BE FREE TO ALL FALLOUT 76 PLAYERS" 
---
That is all
---
Sorry dude. I don't want sound like a douch, but fallout 1st is the greedist thing I've seen in a while. Hope you understand.
---
There are thousands available. You can do it!
---
And you got an A in gullibility.  Oh hey I heard they are fixing all the server issues!
---
I need to get back into it more. Did a lot at start but then stopped after a couple of awkward exchanges
---
Except you pointed out it doesn't have to involve either contest or conflict.
---
Funny how we've only heard from people being fucked with by one side.
---
Adding communist outfits is not appealing to China lol. They are the enemy in the game.
---
Most of the people screaming at fellow players have gotten more hours out of 76 than any equivalent game would provide. You aren’t allowed to use logic or common sense here though. They wanted to LIVE in 76.
---
I also don’t like them charging for the scrap box, but I’m not so blindly ignorant to not recognize I’ve gotten 500+ hours out of the game. My last ten game purchases combined didn’t pass that. A lot of “AAA” games these days seem content with 15-20 hours of gameplay.
---
🥁☠🐴
---
Its nuts. That people have 5 characters max capped. Im not switching characters to pay 30k plus for an item. Somebody once messaged me calling me dumb basically cause i sold an item for 15k when i couldve got 40k+ sorry but i got other stuff to do, not build up alts and mules.
---
I pay bills. I've never had had to lie to any pay them either.
---
Sounds like we have similar stories as well as other players, that’s so amazing, I liked the role playing with setting him up with Redding rings, that’s so cool and I’m not on PS4, I’m on Xbox but thank you for the offer :)
---
Verscharren1, you need to take vocabulary lessons again i think lol!
---
Idiots. Especially those paying on eBay.
---
exactlyyy, i would never pay over what my person can hold at once
---
This is a very good point idk man I think the management is somewhat disconnected with the game could be wrong but just the way it seems priority thing's just seem idk un important to a large degree like idk I would think a big priority would be cleaning up some of the more buggy area's instead of nerfing things or cleaning up area's heavily geared toward new people instead of working on atom shop things or atleast fixing some of these damn bugs that effect the core of the gameplay experience instead of working on something like fallout 1st and having it release now instead of a few weeks from now closer to the holidays..idk if that Makes any sense or not lol
---
Thank you, I play a few games so DM me the games you play 👌🏼
---
The difference is who got the money.  If player A gets their TSE shotgun from a legendary, and then Player B buys it for $100. It’s a player who got the money.
---
It’s still a shitty black market but the net effect was still only one person had the item and it wasn’t sold by Bethesda
---
6k?
---
It was released with bugs. Wastlanders being delayed is most definitely not to iron out bugs. Idk what makes you think that. Guaranteed it's for investors Q1. In what world would released FO 1st benefit them around COD and TOW release? Only investors and stubbornness for cash. They also don't want to please the customers. Look at the past roadmap of 76. You'd be blind if you thought they really wanted to make you, a loot bag, happy.
---
I am with you on the awkwardness. I wish we had some kind of roleplaying flag we could fly
---
I play on Nintendo switch and pc. I have a wide library with triple AAA multiplayers and indie multiplayers. Let me know :D
---
It’s the ability to accumulate unlimited scrap.
---
Yo, Enigma Boy
---
I think if Bethesda was getting the outrageous amounts of money  the Ebay sellers are getting (in totality) they wouldn't have had to charge for Fallout 1st, paywalling content that should have been free for all players.
---
Besides that, there are surely some players who are enterprising. If you can get someone to part with their hard earned cash in exchange for intangible pixels then all power to you. Bethesda doesn't seem to care.
---
Hell ya brotha! I play with Red &amp; the PKOA family anytime I can, helped me a ton as a low level! 🍻🤙🏻
---
I quit at level 319.  The game has absolutely massive issues (tho I heard some have been fixed).  Stuff like loosing my entire camp to the void, having legendary items fall through the map, dealing with the scorch beast queens endless spam amd unwillingness to land just to have ot glitch as soon as she dies and kick you off.  This wasn't stuff from a youtuber, I didn't level cheat to get there, it's just the way things worked out.
---
Now the interactions like this guys were great, some players were outright awesome.  Others tho intentionally griefed just to do it, stabbing u endlessly till u logged out (I know this was fixed).
---
But don't just outright defend the game as not having issues, it has had some pretty bad ones that were outright ignored by the devs for months on end.
---
how is it not against the rules??? i don’t understand. just be a good samaritan and not rip everyone off geez
---
Vamp minigun is what i use when taking more than one conduit, supperessors or troubleshooters 50 cal if dealing damage.
---
Medex up as well.
---
I agree, no matter what goes on with the game or others opinions, it’s about what you like about the game and what your opinion is
---
If they do another meat week, I’m going to cry
---
I got fo76 free to my new pc  I needed, because giving them away in Germany was less moneyloosing then actually trying to sell them or burry them in the desert of nevade with the E. T Games... I don't mind anything these circle jerking idiot brumbel about, I got shit for free and enjoy it, end of story, no atoms bought, no subscription and every time I make a new character some people just push me and help me, for no reason, but hey shitting on 76 brings karma I guess.
---
Yea trolls are marching through our lands, but they are not here to stay, soon everything will start to dry and trolls will move on the hunt for fresh muddy paddles.
---
But in the end it is still p2w, especially since most of those who sell are dupers. You go and see the inventory and they have for a single vendor 20 tse handmade in stock. 
---
In the end it still is a p2w. It just change on who gets the money.
---
And if i wanted to win, i think a tse handmade is far more effective than throwing my infinite junk at an ennemy
---
Of course it's pay to win, but that's not why people are quitting. Most people quit after the first few months. And now it's about the lies, and the principle of what Bethesda has done and how they have treated the players with their actions. Unless you can follow the money through ebay sales and trace it back to some Bethesda or Zenimax or some investor shell account, it's not totally their fault....
---
Oh hell yeah, never had this happen before lol yeah they really solidified myself as a player for F76 and really did make it to the point F76 became my main game lol
---
Some dont realise the worth on some items. And yeah check this out, its at least one angle to the knowledge you seek:
---
 https://www.google.com/amp/s/kotaku.com/the-runescape-players-who-farm-gold-so-they-dont-starve-1819720013/amp
---
Diff game and its gold but the principle remains.
---
What if you earnt more selling game objects then you RL job? Youd be crazy not to take it up as full time.
---
You need a dendro-retraction to remove that stick from your ass. And in post op hopefully they prescribe a chill pill.
---
The hell are you talking about?
---
This is something that has been happening since the 90s.  See Ultima Online. 
---
Selling online game items on Ebay is not something the industry can control.  The transaction and sale happens outside of their network, so there is no way to know who sold it, or to whom. 
---
These people are breaking the EULA, and they can only get caught if they go onto bethesda/sony/MS servers and start bragging about selling x item for x dollars on ebay or craigslist or whatever you kids are selling pixels with these days.
---
By the time I unloaded 27 rounds into the tent to realize it was immune after I respawned and then got the the front they fast traveled away.
---
Lmao they would too
---
I think of Bethesda hasn’t caught on to what the crowd thinks of fallout 1st yet, a few people buying it isn’t going to change anything.
---
Yeah, I did exactly that, it all happened so fast, like something outa a movie
---
jay, honey. i’m talking to the people ripping everyone off for real money
---
15 is nowhere near double 13
---
People just want a reason to be on the Bethesda Hate Train.
---
No problem:)
---
What does the genre have to do with being able to monetize a game without 'self-harm'? What do demographics have to do with anything? (and you can't even say it's different demographics because 76 has tried to target PVP, PVE, endgame, and casual players) 
---
Then you go on to call Minecraft a survival game... and claim it's the only successful survival game... and on top of that you believe Fallout 76 is a survival game foremost? When the survival aspect completely falls off like 15-20 levels into the game, and the rest of it is clearly a looter-shooter?
---
Holy shit dude. You know what, I don't want to hear your answer. Anyone who brings up this much irrelevant and false nonsense is in no way going to provide a coherent counterpoint to anything relevant. You, sir, are blocked into oblivion. xD
---
And to do what with it after? Yeah sure i got 1000 bulk glass its never gonna do anything. If i have 1000 bulk acid its never gonna go that high, its gonna be smelted right away for lead. If youre at a point where yyou have 10000 lbs of junk, youre just hoarding it.
---
If you could place that junk straight up in your player vendor and that it would have no effect on your stash box, yes it would have had been a problem
---
In their defense.....and it's barely there. A lot of the current problems are driven by the finances that come with larger companies.  It's the same thing that kills most small indie companies that eventually grow to this size.
---
Replied the sad angry guy.
---
How is adding Chinese outfits, which is a very real “faction” in the game, supporting Xi? Just because Fallout has Institute outfits doesn’t mean that Bethesda supports kidnapping, or that Roman outfits means Obsidian supports holding woman as slaves just to pump out new soldiers.
---
Yeah i noticed that too my weapons are not hitting with much accuracy anymore even at close range.
---
Thank you and we most certainly do
---
I think your confusing me with someone who thinks bethesda is capable of that.
---
Yup it maxed me out and i was happy. Plus i tried for days to sell that on the market subs and nobody made me any offers like that. Those subs got nuts in what people want. Like you said 90k rounds of ammo, i havent shot that much in a year of playing let alone lying around.
---
It's OK - but I don't find the server runs any smoother than on a public server. 
---
So that's disappointing . I like having the option to play public or private but not sure whether I will continue it.
---
So tell it to someone who actually said something about ripping people off.
---
I did try this, and I still get crashes.
---
By and chance, you don't happen to have any of the dump files from your crashes? They're in the game folder.
---
Yeah I don't think they've got their priorities straight at all. Communication has left a lot to be desired as well. 
---
For example the Ash/Goo piles. Instead of getting that fixed first, they went and fixed the anti-armor effect for energy weapons, which then immediately created way more ash/goo piles. Maybe the fix ran deeper than they thought, or some other complications we don't know (cause they won't say either way), but that commands one extreme lack of foresight. I stopped playing for 2-3 weeks cause of that slick move. 
---
I don't want to poo on NW as people genuinely like it, though I never play it, but I don't think it was the content anyone was really hoping for. An additional mode like that would've been more logical to release once you got the base game itself working better and with more to do. May just be me though.
---
They are 100% right to behave this way cause they made the game. If you don't like, don't buy it.
---
It's not Reddit for validation, it's Reddit for discussion. Also the current trends with the NBA and Blizzard has me wondering if there's a push from China to currently popular entertainment corporations. What's wrong with saying "we?"
---
Depends on your disposable income.
---
Well you asked where to find the plan. It’s in a Whitespring vendor. If you want to trade somebody for it you should ask who has it, and how many caps they want for it.
---
Can’t knock the hustle I won’t do it but I can’t fault someone who can find a way to make real money off something in a game
---
It's the feel of it. Fallout 3 was magical for me, and this game gives you that same feeling just in a slightly different context.
---
Dystopian future, hibernation, learning things that everyone else takes for granted, companions... The list goes on.
---
I'm sorry this happened to you :( 
---
No one deserves to have their hard-earned loot disappear on them, especially after pitching in extra real-life money for a feature.
---
I'm not a subscriber - I would be *just* for private servers if they actually functioned like typical private worlds w/ admin controls, etc. My friends and I were really excited to chip in for a server like we've done for Minecraft Realms and other games - and then this whole disaster happened. The Scrapbox just looked like another overlooked bug that shafts players who just wanna have fun in game. 
---
I tried to bring up the Scrapbox's instability as a reason why Fallout 1st wasn't worth it (yet) and wasn't fair to players and I got told by a subscriber that I was just "another non-player" who "hopped on the hate bandwagon" and "was part of a generation of entitled young people." 
---
It sucks. It sucks when people think just because you don't subscribe, you don't play the game for real or get to have an opinion. I think Bethesda launched a nuke into the community with this feature - not sure what will transpire from here on out.
---
I hope the Outer Worlds is a reprieve. I know tons of people would gladly help you get your scrap back if you want.
---
reread my statement.  I said "I think", which clearly identifies a statement of opinion, not fact.
---
If you think its worth it, go right ahead.  he wanted my though. my thought is that buying items from ebay is a waste of money.
---
Because there hypocrites and morons, easy isn't it? Self loathing, circle jerking haters who don't even fucking play the game, complaining about it and then fucking go and play the new COD brought you by Chinese bootlicker Activision....
---
Again, I don’t think people are saying it’s not Pay to Win in the sense you paid money for an advantage, but rather that it wasn’t designed in the game To work like that.
---
I like ESO and one thing is crafting... you have to research and craft a ton of stuff. One perk is unlimited crafting material space. Otherwise each time you have to go out and gather stuff all over the map in specific places which takes most the time overall. 
---
From day one in Fallout I saw the similarities of ESO. 
---
Unlimited crafting material space 
---
ESO you get X number of crowns, Fallout - atoms to use in the ingame store. 
---
Access to member items (like statues or skins) 
---
ESO plus gives you access to all the DLC’s for free. This shouldn’t be confused with upgrades. 
---
ESO plus members still had to pay full price for Morrowind, Summerset and Elsweyr. It’s only the DLC’s that we’re free. 
---
I saw it a while back and sure enough it happened so I wasn’t shocked since it’s the same company. 
---
The bad... I think the gamer loses the ability to manage certain aspects like being a horder. That’s not a good thing and I leaned when junk was only 400 pounds! Happy at 600 and ecstatic at 800! That was a huge improvement! 
---
It’s nice to have the option of a private server but don’t think it’s perfect! It’s not! 
---
I purposely didn’t pick up items and specifically picked up others... waited to check respawn rates... sometimes it happened other times it didn’t. 
---
That tells me that objects in private or adventure have larger perimeters than I thought. If I’m the only one ever in this world, why is a static spawn not there if I never took it? 
---
I think hype and a bad initial release is why many are made however I use the word many loosely . 
---
Look around at camps... all the anger about collectrons and fridges... now most camps have both! 
---
I’m seeing a ton of scrap boxes as well so I’m thinking that there are more people subscribing than not overall. 
---
This is also Reddit... I’ve seen more negative overall about this here many from non players or people who uninstalled the game... sorry but I’m not buying their 2 cents... 
---
The game goes on and people from early on still can do everything the same as they did last week. 
---
Does a dipper weighing a million pounds, did that really effect anyone playing overall? Nope... life went on.
---
So. 76 is all online. All multiplayer. .. but it isn’t an mmorpg. You know mmo stands for mass multiplayer online ( not co-op)
---
Maps are about as dlc as horse armor
---
Fallout76 isn’t a single player game. It’s always online.  It’s a mmo. 
---
And andromeda was not a bad game. Gamers hated the facial animations and the ugly npcs. The gameplay was literally almost too mass effect. They didn’t change the formula. But they did give into pressure and kill the game. 
---
I’m just glad Bethesda has at least kept trying.
---
I'm skeptical you finished "many other games" and still decided to come back to 76. I'm not even sure if you're actually the guy who got the free copy. Matty said that the person he gifted the game to doesn't play any other games, which was the main reason why he gifted the game. Anyway, the 300 comments aren't hate when there is valid reasoning behind them. The "trolls" you talk about and former players are the ones that made this game somewhat decent, because they didn't accept getting fed shit. There was also no division. Almost everyone on this sub knew to stand up to these unethical and anti-consumer practices but it seems you weren't one of them. Beth loves people like you :) And the "special bond formed between players" can be formed in a plethora of other better games. You seem to have played the wrong games.
---
Here's the clip in case you were curious- [https://xboxclips.com/ChiIy/4384b97e-492b-4016-ad1d-e5d44e04243a](https://xboxclips.com/ChiIy/4384b97e-492b-4016-ad1d-e5d44e04243a)
---
Ahhhhhhhhhhh thanks ok  [NOT CRAZY]  here's your certificate to say you're not mad after all =)
---
Sounds a lot like whataboutism tbh. I mean there's a huge amount of commie stuff about to be introduced in game. Even more than the 2800 atoms Free States bundle. But you're right, it's probably just another atom bundle to flesh out a faction lacking in support. Could have went with the Shi though
---
I agree
---
I saw the subscription coming over 200+ days ago... not kidding and not bragging either... it’s business and a working model by the same company... take a look: 
---
The tent and scrap thing should be a world-wide quality of life improvement to compensate for the delay of Wastelanders.  The sub should only provide the private servers, 1650 ATOMs, and exclusive costumes/dance stuff.   It would probably be just as successful without creating as much of an uproar.
---
Better question is Whale...I saw that term so much last week for people saying they were only going to subscribe for a month...a $13 purchase picture that...
---
But are now owned by a evil corporate giant.
---
Such disassociation, nevermind the consequences of their actions its theirs!
---
I traded in some games to get a copy of FO76 so basically got the game for free. I got the subscription because yes it's buggy and has a few issues but I'm still happy to support the game however I'm paying for the subscription on a faith basis that in return within the next 6 months we will see more bugs being fixed, new content like wastelanders drop and more skins for weapons and armour. If after the 6 months nothing has changed then I will cancel the subscription.
---
I do agree with one of the above comments that they should have released wastelanders first and then paid private servers. I also believe that to release private servers for a game that is still a bit buggy (looking at you atom challenges) is a bit of a smack to the face however the lack of lag while fighting the queen and grinding vault 94 is a positive. 
---
I don't believe they should have locked the junk stash box and the survival tent behind the subscription. The emotes and the clothing and the "free" atoms I can agree with. Saying that tho give it a month or two and after everyone has signed up for the subscription Beth will no doubt release the tent and stash box in the atom store at a ridiculous price.
---
Thank you, Ive had a few people come to my camp and buy stuff but that’s as socially close I get 😩
---
Naw man I agree it's like there children running around saying oh look shiny what's this ok let's do that or this instead of setting a gameplan of some sort or having a team directly over finding fixing bugs managing there employees in a decisive manner instead of if it floats throw it in
---
Thank you for the offer but I’m on Xbox
---
No worries. Im done venting. Had to get it out its so frustrating but bad timing I know. Apologies.
---
Nice 👍
---
I wouldn't mind if mobs don't spawn. As long as the building tools work, and I can use admin commands to spawn in resources to build with lol.
---
I'd rather have a tightly scripted story over the ability to just wander around.
---
You forgot to mention that the ESO subscription gives you all of the paid DLC as long as you sub too.
---
&gt;My point is play the game like you want and try to be happy.  If you don’t agree with the game and it’s direction then go find another game.
---
DW everone is munchausen syndrome
---
B.O.A.T=Bust Out Another Thousand
---
Yes the state of the game has improved but it was really a mess in the beginning...so we are talking about an improvement that startet on a very low level. I played the whole Beta (just bought a beta key for 99cent online), than I bought the game for 15 Euros about 4 weeks after release. Didn’t actually plan to buy it that close after the beta but because the price dropped so fast i thought ... what the hell. 
---
I played for a while and decided, that the game is still not really playable yet. So I waited a couple month and tried again ... but it was still so messy and had so many problems because of bad game design choices that i dropped it again after a couple weeks. A couple month later i tried again, this time with friends because it’s supposed to be better in a team. We again gave up annoyed after about 2 month because of bugs and server crashes ... but also because the whole system of doing quests in a team is so fundamentally brocken that it’s just annoying. It’s like playing a single player game as a team. It feels like you are playing parallel and not together.
---
Maybe I give it another try with this NPC update but my hopes are low. 
---
I really want to like this game because i loved and played all fallout games but it just doesn’t work for me. It always feels empty and lifeless when I play. Bugs and Server crashes were still constant and everywhere the last time I played ... about 3 month ago.
---
Everybody i know IRL completely dropped the game and is not looking back. There are just to many other options to play for most people, so they don’t see any reason to give bethesda more time to get their act together. 
---
I am very pessimistic if bethesda will have the time to improve this game enough and add enough content that the game has a chance to survive. For me Fallout 1st looks like a last straw that bethesda is grabbing to somehow generate enough profit to continue with the game ... but the way Fallout 1st was designed really makes me doubt that this plan will work.
---
Why so many skins though? I mean sure it's probably for an expensive bundle. You guys are right, probably just fleshing out another faction. Maybe they'll be featured in Wastelanders
---
By a gameplan I mean releasing fallout 1st but a few days before releasing a large patch covering multiple highly anticipated issues in game and a handful of much smaller one's Imo hones opinion a game such as this should have a large patch once a month and 1-2 smaller one's covering specific area's of the game so they can stay more up to date on what's going on how thing's are breaking down and what to do to manage the breaks in a efficient manner instead of large patches coming damn near as much as updates to the game itself wich is unreasonable
---
That leads to another problem with 76 though. They wanted all of those to be players. Idc how dedicated of a fanbase you have, you're never going to get a full server of people (not including private) roleplaying things. Id say at least 95% of players are just gonna play the game and not even think about playing a role. Really most of the problems of the game stem from they were relying on the multiplayer way too much to do everything for them which also kinda sits with me as being kinda lazy. 
---
And to your role playing points, that's a type of role playing, yes. You were kinda right with how i see it though. Ig i just see playing a role in something (as in a story) differently than role playing (acting as a raider or whatever) but that'd be more arguing over semantics.
---
I thought the scorchbeast queen didn’t have scaling difficulty. Also yeah, I understand that. Still a shitty move on Bethesda (or zenimax). They DID lie, and I wish they’d change what they did. But the atoms and emotes and suit would’ve been maybe $20 on the atomic shop if they didn’t
---
Yea you’re right everything should be free 🙄
---
You people can’t take a joke
---
I can relate to that, my first fallout was fallout 3 and for me it was very educational, I learned all these new words and they inspired me to use them. I’ve always loved the fallout role playing element.
---
The way I see it, if Blizzard can't stop people from making private servers for WoW, Bethesda doesn't stand a chance. I got my own localhost classic WoW server courtesy of the Mangos team. :D
---
Only problem is you can't solo raid bosses...
---
Atom shop skin?
---
Wasn’t that the original premise of the game?
---
&gt; they think that selling weapons for real currency on ebay is not pay to win but getting private server and infinite scrapbox become pay to win
---
Who's 'they'? And when you do identify this group, you'll need citation for that claim.
---
A game company has control over one and not the other. Sponsored content is pay to win (whatever your definition of win). Rogue, grey-market items are not controlled by Bethesda.
---
That’s hypothetical. The ability to do so is the reality
---
Real life
---
Wanted to be a dweller
---
Damn dude got any other predictions cuz you was dead on with that
---
What mtx did f4 have? I genuinely don't remember
---
Nah m8 encountering some God forsaken other player is funny...
---
My guess is the poor soul is referring to this: https://www.spirithalloween.com/product/pip-boy-device-fallout/150632.uts
---
Caps are worthless. They are the MetroCard of FO76.
---
How fitting
---
I'm sorry that you like many others have suffered from this delima, just one thing I want to know (and please don't take it as a hate comment I am genuinely curious) why did you buy the subscription in the first place? I get that people are able to spend the money they earn the way they want but I just don't see the value or justification behind this subscription.
---
Anytime :)
---
Dude. I wouldn't want to get a call from one of those things.
---
There's very noticeable head-bob when in power armor without weapon ready. Is she having issue with that? Or is she having issues with even the very slight head-bob with weapon ready or when out of power armor?
---
Sprinting also seems to have moderate head-bob.
---
Ooohh i had this the other day. I couldnt fast travel but i have infinite stamina and god mode. sad thing is most creatures didnt see me so they didnt attack me or come run at me. lol
---
I’m glad you found that experience, it so cool having someone asking you for your help, it makes you feel special haha, I’ve been playing since the beta and I never encountered someone that nice, obviously because I’m very antisocial but I wouldn’t miss an opportunity like this again because it’s so cool
---
How is this related to Fallout 76?
---
If they really needed cash so bad they should have released this as a 5 dollar convenience pack DLC. Because what they are offering (minus the monthly atoms) is honestly only worth 5 bucks. It's real functioning storage, a convenient fast travel camp, a set of armor, private servers (sort of), and some emotes for christs sake. They could even getting away with selling it as a $10 one time purchase and people wouldn't be so rightfully mad.
---
I’m on Xbox my dude
---
I was a tank build forever and was always resistant to the bloodied build. Power armor and All Rise All Day. :)
---
I never wanted to be that low on health but **Oh My God bloodied** is it the greatest build in Fallout 76 once I embraced it. With Rifleman and Adrenaline perks, bloodied armor and weapons, I do so much damage that nothing comes close to me for it to matter. I can kill a Scorched Beast with one mag and have taken down 4 at the same time easily. And one-shoting Wes Tek Muties.
---
Also you gain mega strength so all you need is 2 perk cards there. Carry weight increases the lower your health and with a back pack and deep pockets you can carry 350ish.
---
I sport a chest piece of Chameleon armer and you do risk getting killed if detected. But it's a high risk mega high reward build. I just never carry around a ton of junk that I want to risk losing. I can still take a lot of damage tho because of the strength it provides. Obviously you do need to wear Power Armor in a nuke zone but you can kill the Queen if it's outside of it.
---
There are many different great builds out there. I just wanted to chime in if anyone was wondering. I was resistant all the way through level 150.  Now I'm level 260 and would never go back. I destroy anything and everything Fallout 76 can throw at me. 
---
As a matter of fact if anyone wants to trade I have a 2SE 50 cal that obliterates things if you have 15 points in Strength cards.
---
Cheers. :)
---
It’s not.
---
I walk a lonely road, the only one I have ever know.
---
General fallout
---
Alright, good to know. I hope you have fun my dude! :)
---
:D
---
The server shouldn't have to be private to perform adequately.
---
&gt; 1. All posts must be from, directly reference or talk about something to do with Fallout 76.
---
You want /r/Fallout if you want to talk about General Fallout topics.
---
Are you talking about the cheap costume piece at spirit Halloween?
---
Even with the very slight head bob when out of power armour! I’m not sure whether it gets worse when the head bob is even more noticeable, we’d have to check. It would be interesting to see if there’s a correlation, though
---
Except this model has existed for ages. MMORPGs do it. They're not the first company to set up subscription fees for extra features and they won't be the last.
---
It’s because while yes it is pay to win and no one is going to argue with that, it’s about the amount of control. All online games have the issue of people selling gear and services for real money, but unless the seller or buyer is stupid and brags about it, the company won’t know as its outside their network. People are angry with Fallout 1st because that’s entirely up to the company and within their power.
---
Sadly even in other paid games cosmetics require $$$
---
Rust, GW2(was p2p), TESO(was p2p), CSGO...etc.
---
A full set of Troubleshooter's armor (Sentinel preferably), the insulated backpack, and a fast firing Vampire's weapon. Jump onto the top of the  shack and fire from up to. You may have to use a few stimpaks but you shouldn't die. Now, if you hold 1 or more of the pylons as well it gets tricky but still doable.
---
They brought in the creation club way after launch with paid mods.
---
That would be cool. I keep carrying one around to fire off when I find a Sheepsquatch in the hope that someone nearby will come get a few shots in. Surprisingly, nobody's joined in yet.
---
Then don't play? Problem solved?
---
Wait, that legacy crap sitting in my stashbox might be enough to cover the $60 I wasted on this game in the first place? Sounds like a win to me.
---
I dont think he realised it to be honest. On a side note I was feeling kinda snappy stabby after an hour long hunt of me chasing down a person wanted through the woods.
---
The stash is a constantly negative experience in an otherwise enjoyable game. Server performance is a constantly negative experience in an otherwise enjoyable game.
---
Demanding $22 a month from me to fix those issues is disgusting.
---
People would be less mad if you could pick a subscription that comes without atoms and costs 10$ less. And if you do chose with atoms then you should get a hefty discount on them.
---
These small moments,be it with your friends or I. Your case a stranger. These are what gaming should be about. It's awesome OP. May we all have more of these!!
---
When i did my Vault Dweller costume i used that one over the Fallout 4 CE one as it was smaller and much much lighter. I only payed $25 though.
---
1) You’re implying that battlepasses are inherently bad. They’re not. They’re a cheap
---
money sink that enables companies to put out content in a manner that isn’t overwhelming. I didn’t bring up battlepasses, you did. 
---
2) Warframe enables you to literally pay real money for things you need to grind for. You can skip **all** of the grind for a few $$. It’s far more P2W than Fallout 76. I’m not hating on Warframe. I’m literally pointing out what its cash shop is. 
---
3) You aren’t even putting together a counter argument. You’re literally screaming and stomping your feet like a child because you personally don’t agree with what’s going on.
---
Indeed.   Fallout 76 can in no way compare to The Outer Worlds, and it is both cruel and absurd to expect Fallout 76 players who can't afford it due to their Fallout monthly tax to have to hear about it.  
---
All jokes aside, yeah...  no one wants to hear about better games when trying to enjoy the one they're on. We've all probably stood by a rough or tarnished diamond in the past.  I stood by this game right until first, and can remember enough what it was like to have to justify people who didn't get it.  Don't beat a dead horse, just be with the fans who love what you love &lt;3.
---
Fallout is post apocalyptic, not dystopian. 
---
All those things are just sci-fi or RPG elements, not specifically fallout. But I do understand what you mean about that feeling.
---
Something something we all knew this would happen something.
---
It was strictly business! They have a model that works very well and very efficient and successful. Why not implement into Fallout? 
---
My prediction... the no go areas like across the river and other areas will be accessible in Wastelanders. I also think the map will be expanded, if not in Wastelanders but later. 
---
Remember the world was on fire and at war... why not expand? 
---
Fallout 4’s world was way more massive IMO, imagine taking all the things people like in 4 or at least a few and bringing them to 76? 
---
Build a NPC settlement? (Probably in or on private server, be hell to place a whole city) 
---
I think the map will expand for sure! Items you can see are there you just can’t get to it... cars, trash, life preservers... 
---
ESO’s world is massive so why not? Currently you have a transition when going between lands much like walking through a doorway in Fallout... well if they expand the same thing could happen. 
---
I honestly just see this getting bigger!
---
i thought it was just me i found 1 thing in them ever. And in youtube videos i see people pick caps etc from them lol.
---
But yea i use them all the time for rads
---
In a word, greed.
---
In several, they were more focused on pushing the boundaries of what they can do to milk their playerbase, rather than considering what cool new methods of game design and storytelling they could explore. It's part of this new trend that developers have of releasing an uninspired and/or incomplete game, then promising improvements to keep the players hooked while dropping microtransactions and DLC on them. Making a good game is hard. Making *half* a good game and replacing progression with an in-game store is a breeze. This is how Overwatch and Fortnite came to be. Bethesda is trying to see how far they can dip into this philosophy by cutting their staff costs, rushing development and pushing out whatever scam games they can until enough people call them out that they have to make something mediocre to make up for it. "No Man's Sky turned it around" is not an excuse, "companies need money" is not an excuse, "it's optional" is not an excuse- There is no excuse. I'm hoping this blunder pushes the community to realize there is *never* an excuse for placing monetization or greed of any sort above the most basic components of game design or, god forbid, *releasing a complete product*.
---
...So yeah, tl;dr, greed.
---
Sir, it is not the best choice, it's Spacer's Choice
---
because one is done by players and the other is done by the actual company
---
All MMOs are broken on launch. There's no avoiding a definitive QA by having the public break the game. In order to give a proper review of ANY and ALL MMOs you'll need to circle back in a year or more. There's unforseen bugs, balance issues, stress on the servers etc. To say there are MMOs that launch in perfection, that is disingenuous. ESO, FFXIV, SWTOR, DCUO, Champions Online, this list goes on and on. All launched in a terrible state and all took a year or more to gather their bearings.
---
Microtransactions are expected in every MMO. There's NO financial sustainability for any free or server dependent game without microtransactions. I'd love to be proven wrong on this one. If you somehow expected 76 to have little to microtransactions and still keep the servers going then I have a bridge to sell you. Should they be transparent, absolutely. That I can agree with the outrage.
---
As for ol Randy, this guy has lied almost as much as EA and yet people flock towards Borderlands. I don't care about his personal squabbles but he's stolen assets from artists, lied to the public on game features, pulled bait and switch tactics yet the outrage isn't quite the same as 76. Sure his games aren't MMOs but it doesn't seem as trendy to harp on his business practices. I agree that Bethesda should have better customer relations. But let's be honest, the hate is far more toxic due to the trending hatred this game gets.
---
Look, at the end of the day I can understand the disappointment but frankly I don't really care. I don't care for the 1st membership or its perks, I don't use or care for a silly fridge or repair kits and I certainly don't care to play on easy mode with unlimited junk. I just log on occasionally to explore with my wife and unwind. It's really not the end of the world.
---
Note: After Randy Pitchford screwed me and many others on Aliens: Colonial Marines I vowed to never give Gearbox another cent and I haven't since despite being a major Borderlands fan. If this game upsets you to this extend just be a person of principal and phase it out of your life. You'll feel better, trust me.
---
I have finally given up on something I knew would be fixed. ( been loyal since Fallout 1 until now) But it only got worse with the legendary gun nerfs and patching unimportant glitches that screwed up huge already "fixed" bugs. More often than not it made new ones. There are several new games out there Borderlands 3 &amp; Outer Worlds, just to namep a few and now I actually enjoy and look forward to playing again instead of 2 steps forward 333 steps back. You can bet Bethusa is laughing all the way to the bank. No Conscience Todd? No problem, no customer loyalty or base.
---
That's because hordes of non-whales left the game after having nothing to do.
---
Of course, that would be great :)
---
hoard less shit
---
i bet they dropped 1 star armor tho :-p
---
edit: nevermind lol 2 star armor ftw
---
👌🏼
---
Punishment for using legitimate weapons and not cheating? That's crazy. Also god mode can happen without using legacies or teslas.
---
Check their return policy OP
---
Where is the event
---
$22? Whereabouts are you? 
---
I do think the price is high however ESO is $14.99 a month which is a Bethesda game as well. 
---
Year price was way cheaper for both and I’m going to assume like last year, Black Friday had a 50% off deal on the pass.
---
Oh, don't worry, it ain't just your position. Wastelanders and First are both collections of features which should have been present on release. They also should have been functioning.
---
That's how I'm using it
---
Yeah that works.  You on now?
---
And?
---
What does PvP give you?
---
now that would be useful!
---
I bought the game for 80 Canadian dollars.. I feel so mad about what they added. Oh well anything good left of zenimax is gone, I like Bethesda and fallout 76, because I know they aren't in charge of the decisions made by zenimax , oh well anyyyyyyhing gooooes (fallout 4 song)
---
This smells like a fake account to push positive PR about the game.
---
If we're talking precedents, then players should be able to set up and host their own servers freely on their own systems.
---
I've been overcumbered since beta lol need to get rid of stuff but that'll take to long
---
I messaged a lvl 12 the other day and asked if he wanted me to build him a camp. All I saw was 2 turrets and a chair. He never answered so I dropped him 30 plans at his camp and messaged him about it. Then I split but watched him on the map go back to his camp to get his loot lol.
---
Rad barrier would be nice, but people would probably still find a way to get around it. Something like rad sponge combined with the ridiculous rad negation of power armor/hazmat suits in this game would probably make anything above thousands of rads per second manageable. It would have to be more irradiated than that river from the pitt. Also, I think it would have been cool if they did it the way NV did where the scenery leads you around in circles until you get sidetracked instead of just leaving a lazy fence and saying "nah fam not here". Some parts of the map do this pretty well, especially up in the northwest of the map, but then places like the cranberry bog just suck
---
I would say unless you are a kitted bloodied/junkied it will not be any faster, and that you could still do this on a regular server (many people one shot things all day during a whitesprings run anyways to keep the loot for themselves as it stands). Now if they added briefcase nukes (like NW ones) to the atomic store I would consider that p2w more than p4c.
---
Bro I have thought the expanding at some point deal since first found a barrier and was heartbroken that it was there was just a invisible barrier but places still to explore out there I honestly love the game but throughly annoyed with there lack of current creativity I believe strongly they have more hiding behind the scenes then just wastelanders that they have been prepping for release at some point in the future but been holding of to c what is loved liked neutral and or hated in the world they currently created so they can revamp there idea's and works of art to fit in with what people enjoy love
---
$8 a month for 16 bucks worth of atoms, a private world, a super convenient quick camp that doubles as a second free fast travel point, infinite junk storage, exclusive outfits, multiple icons, multiple dance emotes, and the ability to famrnevery workshop to get infinite ammo, fusions cores, and junk seems worth it to me personally.
---
Agreed. Its Zenimax probs calling the shots and Todd and Pete just have to be the meat shields to take the consequences of the corporations actions.
---
Some online games allow that, but it's not universal.  Call of Duty let you rent servers but you couldn't host on your own machines.
---
I believe in a free market.
---
Maybe you shouldnt be suckered into the group think of youtube clickbaters who dont even play fallout. YOU DID GET SUCKERED. Ill enjoy the video game with my own thoughts and money, meanwhile you will be stuck in a group think stupid idoitic mindset because a youtuber who you sub too said so!
---
Guess what that youtuber is a click baiting rat, and so are the copy cats. They are rats. I am not a rat i am a self serving thinker. HAVE A GREAT DAY AND ENJOY YOUR GROUPTHINK
---
I got stressed just looking at this. what a fire hazard! 
---
(jk haha. looks AWESOME)
---
Thanks, all
---
I suppose there is plenty of joy in bashing others work. If you’re in denial then leave it be. The game is great, it has problems but they have not abandoned it. The level of commitment this studio has is respectable and if you had any level of understanding on what it takes to develop games, you wouldn’t be bashing them at all.
---
Yes, who gives a shit. You want the police sitting on video game servers to make sure nobody gets bullied? There's a reason even a broken mess like this has mute and block options
---
People are walking away from the game for many reasons. PvP advantages are one of them. Biggest might be because endgame Is getting boring and instead of giving us wastelanders, they removed Survival and offer Is pay per play private servers instead. 
---
I am playing Fallout 4.
---
Same
---
Know what? You’re absolutely right. They don’t give the 11 at night calls you want.
---
You seem to have ignored the part where they are charging for basic fixes to the game. How much they are charging is irrelevant.
---
There is no point where it is acceptable to sell us the fixes to problems with a game we already paid for.
---
Capitalism says we’ll need a major credit card to help you with this problem.
---
A few user in this subreddit and a few on Facebook went beyond the barrier on PS4 and pc platforms. 
---
They said it looked identical and showed pics plus map locations. No content but still looked the same. 
---
Xbox I tried numerous times could do it. 
---
I had my camp up north by vault 51? I think, almost on the edge of the map. Vault is closed but one day it literally just appeared. No update day either, it was just there.
---
I can see why you think that but it’s 100% true
---
Just saying bro, chill 🙃. There’s no discussion to be had, you nor anyone else have the power to tell anyone what choices to make. Stay butthurt 😉
---
Get ready for the wave of angry comments XD
---
8 dollars? It's like twice that in European money. Even the yearly bundle costs the equivalent of almost 140 US dollars.
---
Man that’s really nice of you 👌🏼
---
It looks like there were some small efforts back when the game launched to try that, never went anywhere though, with the most recent update from either being 11 months ago.

&gt;Then make private servers require a different character than Adventure and don't allow any back and forth. This ensures no paid advantage and the possibility of real control over servers when modding drops. Release a lower cost subscription model that doesn't give atoms and it's purchasable with them.
---
Or..  Make a subscription only version of FO76 called 'Communities' charge the same amount with the 1650 ATOMS and include as part of the sub: private servers, huge increase in  CAMP budget, get rid of workshops (increase loot yeilds to compensate), and make it completely non-PVP and add a ton of more explorable/lootable areas with better than average legendary drop rates and provide venues for gatherings not  solely related to getting legendary gear and more for social activities.  You can take as many characters you want from Adventure into the world but it's a one way trip. Maybe give a one-time option in the first 30 days to go back to Adventure, but that character cannot re-enter the world again.
---
The subs will pay for world content/maintenance and ATOM SHOP can sell costumes, CAMP decorations and minor convenience items up the wazoo for profit.
---
Snow will be included in our Wild Winter bundle with the same Santa hats, CAMP decorations and emotes from last year for the low, low price of 2000 Atoms! 
---
But wait, there’s more! Fallout 1st members can get the bundle for an exclusive discount at only 1700 Atoms! You got that right, join Fallout 1st today and you’ll get almost enough Atoms to get it right away! You’ll also get a free bonus item—Atomic Mistletoe! It looks identical to the Fasnacht Branch Garland—and nothing like Mistletoe—because it’s Atomic, not because we reused the asset, but this one works in doorways! (May not work in all doorways at launch but there are plans to address this in an upcoming patch.)
---
And don’t forget, to go along with that Atomic Mistletoe, all players can get a new Kissing emote and photomode pose! They’re just 500 Atoms each for a limited time! 
---
That’s what they’re banking on. That’s the most expensive option.
---
Depending on next month's dance emotes I might not cancel it
---
I asked since it’s literally twice as much as what is charged here... so in your defense I asked since I think it should be the same cost for everyone. (Aside from currency value and rate)
---
Upvoted because someone on this earth still remembers UO.
---
No one comment 
---
This dude is just after upvotes and to rile up others for his own amusement
---
Sure would suck if 76 went the way of Lego Universe.
---
Hahaha Rexar voice "well played"
---
Lmao plays good? Are you serious? It’s a PASSABLE game now. But plays good? Lmao what games do you enjoy?
---
Yeah i officially quit the game the day fallout 1st was announced after playing it from beta to now
---
I'd say there needs to be a balance of actually enjoyable time spent, "boring" time spent on  grinding/inventory management and even negative time spent like dealing with bugs and crashes. Making a game specifically to pad out play time with boring mechanics isn't a good comparison as a movie that you're meant to actively be enjoying the full way through or something like that. Still, sandbox or RPG games specifically will net you a lot more time than something like a call of duty campaign
---
This game's ratio of enjoyable time spent to boring/negative is pretty low compared to others in the genre, but it's still decent fun for the price if you can actually enjoy it
---
No, that isn’t it at all. The *entire* reason the Fallout universe exists is because China (and maybe America, or at least Vault-Tec) nuked America. They’re the reason for the Great War. Which, in 76, only happened 25 years ago. Plus, there’s literally a hidden Chinese base in game. With what, a few Red State flags and an **American** suit of power armor? Chinese officer swords? But no uniforms at all? Having uniforms in the game, even if you have to buy them, makes complete lore-friendly sense.
---
Sounds like something a communist would say
---
Haha why even have cap limit?
---
The fact that you have to say why you bought it is absurd to me.
---
You're encouraging shitty practices, essentially contributing to making it worse for everybody, yourself included.
---
What did you expect? A pat on the back?
---
Is it on the golf course? That spawn is pretty cool
---
Nope, it just says nothing under the “next payment”. So I am guessing you have to buy it each month instead of auto buying it.
---
I should just get it for one month and do nothing but farm scrap. Then my stash will be half empty and ill have loads of scrap for the future. You can still access it after the month runs out, right? you just cant add to it anymore
---
There will be eventually, last patch had a bug fix for the event afaik
---
So, let’s look at it this way. China is portrayed in a very bad light in this franchise. They dropped the bombs and ended the world. If China really wanted to push Bethesda to add pro-Chinese stuff, they’d be telling them to retcon a lot and have a terminal say that China never dropped a single bomb and that the US launched every nuke.
---
They have this as an option on they're "Bethesda plz" list, but it will cause server instability for sure, who knows what madman can build with 30% more budget
---
Enjoy! It is a fair price, games should cost around $120 now.
---
They should just bring it inline across the board. But I'm guessing they don't want to deal with currency fluctuations and taxes. I don't think its applicable to be taxed in the US.
---
Its $8.33 USD per month if you buy the year.
---
Just as a side note, on PC here and I remember some odd games way back in the day would give me really weird problems due to sound issues. I know ford racing 2 has an issue because it uses some obscure sound system that pretty much no modern machine has, and you essentially need to illegally modify the .exe to make it playable. It just crashes on startup without it. Pretty sure I also had some crashes modding fallout 2 when there were incorrect sounds applied to things. Probably some other things but I can't recall specifics right now
---
In Europe, it's the equivalent of almost 17 US dollars. I can get almost 2 months of WoW game time for that kind of money...
---
I think from now on I will be only commenting and posting the following content on this sub: Fuck Bethesda
---
I would have reinstalled the game that night for this lmao but they fucked up
---
And yet you commented
---
There were some datamined for the wastelanders bow, so they could be coming soon™️
---
Oooh good idea!
---
-2 days later-
---
 Bethesda: *Adds to Fallout 1st, however it deletes all your ammo on use*  Yet another ‘success’ for Fallout 76, super epic game of the year!
---
Awesome! This should be on wastelanders! Try to contact Bethesda they might actually get this in the DLC :)
---
All awesome ideas.... but the one i would love the most. telling me what power armor in my stash is what. 
---
power armor frame
---
now where is my BOS Jetpack t60? 
---
seriously is it that hard?
---
They're a story element. I'm glad that they're there for that purpose, especially when you find a place with some sort of note and there's one of them. I stopped bothering to search them early in the game after I realized that there wasn't anything there and that they're going to irradiate me when they fall apart.
---
True, but it could also see some people build some mad/impressive stuff.
---
Same! Its so fun when you hear people raging. I got a 3* though, and they didnt!
---
And you read my comment. Are we stating the obivious?
---
YES!!! SO MUCH YES!!!
---
Definetly tho the challenges on combat section, the ones that require you to mod weapons can be completed fast if you happen to have a skin for said weapon.
---
I'm really getting shafted as a European then.
---
Yeah guess Bethesda neglected to mention a annual pass is necessary to get the full experience
---
all theyd have to do is make another subscription option without atoms. just deduct them from the price. 
---
its 12.99 incl 1650 atoms. now on a sale youd get 1500 atoms for 10$ (normally 1000) so im thinking just make a 4.99 subscription without atoms. i understand people will say it should be like 1.99 or 2.99 but thats just not how things work. 4.99 would seem more fair and it would mean that for an extra 8$ youd get 1650 atoms. which would be a great deal, if you buy them on the regular anyway.
---
So they will change every month?
---
There’s nothing that really makes the sub worth half of what they’re asking anyway, Zenimax/Bethesda accountants have been bad with regional pricing for a long time.
---
The point is that you just said "don't do this thing I'm doing"
---
&gt;Most people quit after the first few months.
---
Are you sure about that?
---
Sorry to hear that. I'm just providing info is all.
---
They will never do this.  The numbers are already in and they sold more than they expected to with the current pricepoint.
---
If a company sells more than the projected outlook, they will not change it.  They are going to keep it as it is, because they blew past their prospective sales targets. 
---
You dont lower sales prices or targets if you are currently meeting or exceeding said targets.
---
And hey, if we are on the same platform in always down to play! I'm working on maxing out a private server, always room for other kind players!
---
Probably won't want to hear it, but they mentioned that its coming...but pretty sure its tied to the subscription. 
---
&gt; Private worlds will continue to evolve with new features such as expanded building areas, increased C.A.M.P. budgets and Workshop persistence. We’ve also received a lot of questions about playing Fallout 76 with mods and this, too, is something we’re excited to add to private worlds in the future.

I’m still waiting on that Mothman backpack that was in the concept art. How am I supposed to show my loyalty to our magnificent moth friend if I can’t wear a replica of him on my back at all times?
---
That’s because y’all got taxes.
---
Yeah members will get several perks for staying subbed
---
I don't even play the game, I was just casually exploring this sub and saw this post. I honestly  agree with you, tho.
---
I have no problem with silos when using power armor, but the imposter melts it.
---
Be happy to game / talk anytime. Lev 319, PC.
---
You made my choice easy then. Thanks
---
Well they could make more money if it cost less, thats how discount companys works. Why make 13 bucks on two custommers, when you can have 10 buying a 5 bucks subscription.
---
I like where this going...
---
I think anyone that’s left playing needs to be a fairly nice person - patient, optimistic kind and forgiving.
---
Pal, I don't know why you're so argumentative. Here I thought this was just gonna be a normal conversation, too bad you just want to argue.
---
I'm not defending the game or Bethesda's business practices. I wasn't even saying people coming here to talk about their concerns and issues with the game were bad.
---
I literally said the only people that I consider on said bandwagon were the ones without actual viable opinions, and that only come here to say, "you all are fucking stupid for playing this game, Bethesda is scamming you fools."
---
If someone comes to this sub to voice their actual opinion and talk about their concerns and issues with the game, that's perfectly fine, even if they haven't played the game.
---
Oh god😂😂
---
Thank you, Very useful!
---
The old adage still holds true: you vote with your money. You are voting that the direction of the game is correct.
---
Is that what i said? Pretty clear i did not use those words and thats not how a quote works. Should have called me a hypocrite or something, that would at least have been close
---
Make sure you do all the dailies and weeklies, even vault raid ones.
---
I can probably help you in about 25 minutes if you are on now. I'm also usually on later around 10:30.
---
You bring discounts into a market if the product isnt selling at full price. 
---
This product is, and they have the numbers to prove it.
---
Definitely happening, and not for free.
---
If you had to own fallout 4 to purchase it it’d change whole lot, it’d go from Bethesda’s worst game to their most ambitious add on
---
I’ll be on on 25 mins, pm your gt if you’re down to help :)
---
Goddamn
---
Yeesh, have you tried a dating service?
---
Well I guess that it just depend if they want to retrieve a part of their fanbase or just let it go.
---
It's a full prized 60$ game that was released less than a year ago with special editions, pre-order boni and a big cash shop. Now it's getting a 13$/month subscription. Bethesda has long crossed a line and there is no going back, at least not for me personally.
---
They want to be able to control what their population has access too since it works pretty well for the POC.
---
Some good ideas on there, especially the log cabin one. Bonus points for some usable structures.
---
Yea..but peeps in 🇨🇦 get free-ish healthcare, if you pay a bit more for aspirin you are asking the wrong people to feel for you, We in 🇺🇸 have to be Damn near death for insurance to cover anything.
---
Even if you add some arbitrary VAT, the numbers still don't add up and I'm still getting scammed a dollar fifty monthly. Besides, that just an awful excuse. Wow doesn't do that, no other subscription based service does that. Not WoW, not Netflix, not Amazon Prime, nothing.
---
Try running the lode barring event, use excavator power arnor. Granted youll need acid but youll get lots off copper
---
If the part of the fanbase they are looking to recover is the same people who  havent done anything but trash the company and game for the last 5 days, then they probably dont care to have them back. 
---
If you continually berate and abuse a company, they no longer do business with you.
---
Was this person 'Atom Bomb Baby' in Flatwoods by any chance?
---
I'm sure this will come when they add the abilty  to mod. I for one can wait for a max level forest to explore.
---
It does smell like /r/HailCorporate stuff.  Especially after the week they've had.
---
Prevent inflation. Which already happens. If you don't play the game you would be surprised at how high trading for caps goes. It's the same reason Slocum's Joe's coffee and a jelly doughnut goes for thirty bucks
---
It is what you said just not in those exact words. Also quotation marks can be used to outline a phrase within a sentence without being a verbatim quote. Nice try, and you're right to say you're a hypocrite.
---
You have 76 upvotes. Nice.
---
Bethesda needs to know that it's not cool to just release half finished, buggy, unpolished games over and over again. Then Bethesda should learn that this is NOT the right way to deal with a broken game. You don't slowly release half baked patches and updates and slowly make the game more pay to win.. not if you care about your customers at least.
---
Bethesda should be punished for making anti-consumer products and being greedy. If you really don't see a reason why they should be punished then you're either blind or delusional
---
everytime something new comes out I always wait a week to see if any issues arise, its saved me.
---
ill get it for one month anyway. because im going to want some Halloween items from the shop and this is a way to get cheaper than normal atoms. and i want to stash all my scrap plus all the scrap i can find in one month, in the scrap box. to free space from my stash. also i want to farm some items. i really want one of those special color asylum outfits :D   .and who knows maybe in a couple of months ill do it again if i want some atoms anyway or to refill the scrap box lol
---
oof. I guess I won't hold my breath then.
---
I would love to see the snow. 
---
I'm afraid my ps4 will melt.
---
And now you can see where Bethesda fails.
---
I agree that the hate has gone, again, out of hand, but the people who are hating on the game are the ones who are getting the most heard of us, unfortunately; so it would be better to retrieve them and make them happy about the game, instead of leaving them with their hate.
---
" Networking wise this game is a mess tbh :) "
---
Why do you think it's so messy? I mean, why didn't Bethesda do implement clean networking?
---
Ill be online in an hour and  a half or so.  Still at the office. 
---
If you want some assist, send me a message GT: SmakzMS
---
That's what the robobrains are for, didn't you play f4? ;^)
---
All I can say is they weren't real friends if they were nowhere to be found. Just saying rethink your social circle.
---
I have to do something while i'm on the toilet, might as well bask in the schadenfreude of people paying bethesda to serve them reheated leftovers 🤣
---
You would have had to wait for a sale to play a new game because you bought the f76 subscription. I have no empathy.
---
The people getting the most heard by bethesda right now are the ones talking with their wallets.
---
Money says alot more than words do to a business.
---
Absolutely. Very few games retain their players, and none with such poor reception and abysmal failure every step of the way, with a game riddled with bugs and crashing. Most people just won't put up with that.
---
To be honest I never understood your system but conversely don't kid yourself. Nothing is "free" just socialized.
---
Do you know how shitty it is when even books say $9.00 US or $16.00 CDN (way more than just the FX)
---
They don't have to make private servers free becouse it cost alot if money to run those servers
---
Now I hope said mother will do the magical thing of teaching the child, how to do the uninstall, and go play The Outer Worlds instead. :D

Ahh I see the magic carpet base is now a tent. I will remember this.
---
Still , buying a weapon on EBay is still better than Fallout 1st &amp; the Atom Shop, at least you are getting something of value buying from EBay.
---
Would you like someone to deliver your coffee too?
---
I didn't get the game until March or so, but I think the best thing for Bethesda would be to definitely give everyone who pre-ordered a free YEAR of 1st. It's the only way for them to get even the slightest but of redemption. I also think the tent and stash box should be for everyone, just like the backpacks.
---
If I cared I would have taken an effort to help a fellow person not get swindled, to do something to prevent the unseen hand of Todd Howard to pilfer money from their wallet. It might be cold, and unfortunate to say, but if you've bought fo76... you're a lost cause 😔
---
eh, i bought it just because i was gonna buy atoms anyways, just get all that free stuff and more atoms along with it the way i look at it
---
That's what I heard too.
---
Why is no one commenting about how this is the first post this account has ever made, and they have no prior comments to this. They created this account 2 months ago, yet they've never bothered saying anything until Bethesda's big fuck up. This seems really fishy to me.
---
This is true, but how could they expect to sell any copys of the next Fallout game if a good 80% lf their custommers lost their trust in Bethesda ? And even if they prefere to hear people who love the game and those who buy the subscription, they just cant ignore all the people who realy arent happy about this.
---
&gt; Appalachia is more detailed environment than Commonwealth or Capital Wasteland and you can't deny it. 
---
This is very true. You can't walk 20 steps in 76 without something unique to look at.
---
A lot of care went in to making the world we played in. Then it's like someone else with no connection to what was made shoehorned in the story and other awful mechanics on top of it.
---
Doesn't work with through hiker. If you use the perk, water will be lighter.
---
Lmao I can do the same with escape artist and fast traveling. That’s completely free...
---
Also, stop carrying junk into workshops. There are countless threads of people crying about this but it’s your own fault for going into a PvP zone with junk. 
---
You don’t know what P2W is and if you want to see, I suggest looking at Warface on the PSN or Xbox store. It’s a free DL but wait until you see the in-game item store.
---
1) Are there a lot of bugs during the launch period of a lot MMOs? Yes. Are most MMOs as broken as Fallout 76 at launch? NO. Most MMOs have betas months before release in order to make sure to get rid of as many bugs as possible before launch. Fallout 76 on the other hand had one of the most broken AAA releases in video game history.
---
2) You don't seem to understand what I'm getting at. I'm not arguing that other games don't have microtransactions. I'm arguing that other games are honest and upfront about their microtransactions unlike Fallout 76, which promised it would only have COSMETIC microtransactions and has since repeatedly broke that promise. Had they been honest about having p2w microtransactions from the start I wouldn't have as much of a problem with it.
---
3) I never said he wasn't a liar. Hell, you're the one who brought up Randy to begin with. My point is that Bethesda lies more often than most MMO companies.
---
4) Gee, I wonder why people hate Fallout 76 so much. Maybe it was because of the multiple lies, the vague marketing, the broken launch, the false advertising, moldy helmets, overpriced microtransactions, doxing people, and the lack of content at launch. Bethesda really doesn't have anyone to blame about the hatred towards 76 other than themselves.
---
5) You do realize how hypocritical you are right? Here you are telling me to just stop thinking about and paying attention a franchise I love just because I hate the direction they're going in, while you yourself won't stop talking about what Randy did to you years ago and will randomly insert how much you hate Randy into a conversation that has nothing to do with him.
---
Another person twisting what they think is correct with whats actuall correct, not really a nice try
---
Guys I think battlenet in the title was a typo
---
MS2 NA does something similar.
---
Someone get this dude a beer.
---
If they can make extra money by adding a second option for people that are now not buying... companies might give more options tho
---
the vocal minority is not 80% of their fanbase, its more like 1%
---
I came here for the downvoted comments. Best 3min of my life?? WTF really?. So this is the kind of people the game has retained? Too funny. Oh BTW Brand new account only post.
---
Or in this case have both.
---
That's a interesting camp and a good video. But I think it would have been better with a spoken guide trough the factory. 
---
And two things are missing in your video. 
---
     - Where can we find your factory?
---
     - Can people visit the factory? (and if yes, when     
---
       and where can they book the tour/ visit the   
---
       place?)
---
Just my 2 cents 😊
---
Edit: Formating on mobile is horrible 😁
---
I heard someone say Bethesda nixed this idea. But it would be really cool. I played Guild Wars 2 for many years and they just kept on adding more and more zones. But this is Bethesda, so temper your expectations.
---
ESO plus is $14.99 a month and pretty much offers the same (yes a few different items plus and minus) and is successful. 
---
I don’t think a lower cost will happen. 
---
Pay yearly is cheaper and hope there’s a Black Friday deal on a year!
---
Couldn't have said it better myself!! They would have attracted new players and brought back a lot of the people who gave up on this game. Very bad decision especially so close to the launch of the outer worlds.
---
For mod access I'm guessing you will need a sub and have to pay atoms to unlock them. Cosmetic mods will be allowed in public lobbies and game changing mods only in private lobbies. Creators will revive payment for  their work in either $ or atoms. Characters in heavily modded lobbies will be flagged as modded and won't have access to public lobbies.
---
You are telling me all of your other services adjust monthly to reflect current exchange rates? I don’t know ANY company that does this. Or are you saying they don’t charge VAT? If they aren’t charging VAT they are breaking the law.
---
How much are the charging annually in €?
---
True, but this porcentage, whatever it is, is the one that is getting heard by other people, who dont play the game, and even some who play it.
---
No offense, but did you just recently create your account?  I looked at your profile. It looks rather new.  👽
---
Absolutely. And that is a lesson they will learn in time. You sound like the kind of person who would run a company into the ground for your ego. Walmart, McDonalds, Steam, what do they have in common? They became giants of industry because they sold to mass market at low prices. Shortsighted short term profits, and some "targets" who knows how low being met mean nothing, when your reputation is in the gutter and lifelong fans will no longer do business with you.
---
Fallout 76 sold 3 million copies at launch. 
---
This sub has 200k subscribers.
---
Of those 200k subcsribers about 5000 are pissed off.  These happen to be the people also promoting the 3 or 4 players on youtube who have done nothing but spout hate for the last week. 
---
The numbers are not on your side in this argument, and the sales numbers for 1st launch are in and they sold more than expected.  So the playerbase is not dying. 
---
Couple this with the fact that most bases are sporting junk boxes now, and I see a ton of people in game using the emotes or wearing ranger gear. 
---
There is no evidence that 80% of the playerbase up and left the franchise. 
---
There is however evidence that a very small very vocal minority are pushing an agenda that everyone is pissed off.
---
What I'm saying is that way more people would buy this subscription if it was cheaper, and that Bethesda would make more money this way.
---
 Well seeing they make consumer products and are not that greedy I disagree. ;)
---
I'm half tempted to download it again just to join in on targeting the idiots supporting this asinine product.
---
Why believe anything Bethesda says anymore...
---
Anyone who actually buys the subscription, needs to be lobotomized. 
---
Hell, anyone who still plays this absolute shitstorm Id be concerned of. 
---
Why arnt all of you playing thru Outer Worlds yet?  Geez. 
---
Time for some lulz!  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QlBmOj4tUiY](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QlBmOj4tUiY)
---
I tend to agree
---
Don't quit your day job.
---
the only people watching these videos and reading Reddit about this are people who are looking to perpetuate the narrative. 
---
New players are being coaxed in by the existing playerbase, not videos shot by fly by their seat youtube personalities that noone really likes anyway.
---
I thought it was a hub shooter.
---
👻destiney.....   dinkalidge.
---
Humbly sharing how those three minutes affected you in turn made me feel good and more positive about people...thanks for paying it forward. :)
---
the difference is that now the perk "covert ops" now applies to all unarmed weapons except the meat hook, which makes the power fist the best weapon in the game with the highest base dmg and 3.5x sneak attacks. it works on the DCG too
---
North of Camden park, and I don’t plan to move this camp yet as I am working on camp other camps on other characters, so if you see my username in lobby on PS4 yournansbowl, and I’m at my camp, I’m always happy to give a tour, give a few to passers by as I was building it😁
---
Also I would love to do and get to that, I currently record and edit this using only a PS4😂 I only have a £5 mic right now so recording commentary comes out awful. But I hope to save up and get better quality hardware to improve my videos. Thanks for the input tho 😊
---
It's easily worth it as a bundle. 
---
$12.99 all those items AND 1650 atoms. Well worth it.
---
No idea why you're getting downvoted when this comment is literally true, anyone who lives in a country where Activision (or Bethesda) got a tax refund is paying them money, whether they bought their games or have never heard of them.
---
the new perk change is "Covert ops" which applies to some melee weapons instead of ranged like its supposed to. the meat hook does not get this new bonus.
---
Id just like to point out that astroturfing on Reddit is rife, and that OP has no other posts but this one. Id like to believe its real but the cynic in me thinks otherwise
---
No, was obviously in the free version, I can't see why people think it's related to fallout 1st
---
That's because Minecraft uses a dedicated server on the host machine which costs no money at all, just your electricity bill. FO76 uses servers from Amazon which cost money, they'd be losing money by giving away free private worlds.
---
Except this "vocal minority" was and is large enough to make headlines over their targeting of the people that bought the insane subscription.
---
And if there are that many people willing to harass, how many more do you think there are out there that aren't harassing others?
---
I understand they need to make money.  But with 76, there is way too much at stake to think about money at this point.  They need to think about their reputation, which is in very real danger, IMO.   A reputation that is in the crapper sure as hell won't help their bottom line when it comes to future titles.
---
(sits down with the popcorn)
---
 Let me have Liberators for my CAMP and I'll go straight up commie. ;)
---
Sure, but releasing shit tier content that is on par with the stuff they released that is "forcing" them into this option in the first place is not the way to go.
---
release price hear in Aus was near $100 so it is twice not thrice
---
test the card "covert ops" with "ninja" at the same time for 3.5x sneak attacks on melee even though the card says its for ranged. it works on every unarmed weapon except the meat hook.
---
Sorry but 300 per flux was always a bullshit price. Market standard on the other subreddit and ingame was always 75-100. Nobody payed a cap more except the occasional violet flux going for 150
---
 A lot of new people are showing up. I have not seen so many low levels running around since the start. ;)
---
nah
---
Release scrap box and tent for free as in-game rewards, replace it with something else in fallout 1st. Problem solved.
---
Its a great example because its in a shape similar to Fo76.
---
They are doing it on purpose.
---
Are your vendors powered?
---
I’m not gonna lie, this is definitely me when I’m jealous over a video game
---
You assume im against it but i really dont care that much. because i see a great value in getting it for a month, just not for a year. im just saying they could give another subscription without atoms and might make some easy extra money while at the same time making it easier for people with less money to spend.
---
Still need help? DM me your gt. I'm on now
---
This is my first post, I never felt the need to post on here but I had to share my experience
---
I agree. Hate the company not the people
---
Sent it
---
No need for the snarky comments bud. Next time you're going to criticise someone else for absolutely no reason other than to be a jerk - just don't.
---
No worries:)
---
I get it.  I thought I would miss having NPCs, but I decided to play the game that was there instead of the game I thought I wanted.  I had fun.  You can too.  
---
Looking back, I preordered the xbox version but cancelled that order.  So, it was the PC version that I ended up buying twice and that was it.  So I'e spent about $40 on the game.  I have no regrets for the number of hours I've been able to play it and the fun I've had.    You get out of this game what you put into it.  There is a LOT of story telling in it that is implied, in holotapes, and visual in the setup of tons of things all over the map.   Finding those things is part of the fun.
---
I understand why you would think that, I barely use Reddit if I’m honest, I had to share this experience
---
It’s just a lil story of how someone made my day
---
I like it! Fallout NV vibes! Will go well with the Ranger Armour!
---
Well I personally like the outer worlds and obviously F76, maybe she will or maybe she won’t
---
Well said.
---
Thank you, I’m on Xbox one
---
When it comes to real money, I don't think it should be a thing, and it is illegal if I'm not wrong. And at the end game, caps become worthless. You make so many caps that you just don't have a place to spend them on. As someone who actively used to trade, ammo is the new currency, specially 5.56. It is the most used in game by players for their weapons. I understand paying outrageous amounts, some stuff is now unique and almost impossible to get. And I'm sure if a player had the choice between duped and original, their pick would be original.
---
It had gotten to the point where me and many others have made characters, mules, for carry weight(since the unlimited storage wasn't here, and even here it doesn't cover weapons and armor) because we have good items we use on trades or that aren't selling as quick. The end game has become trading for many, since there isn't much else to do. It's a faster method of finding the things you are grinding for.
---
Are you sure you still want my help with I am Become Death.  Im one of those filthy 1sters.
---
Thank you I appreciate it but I’m on Xbox unfortunately
---
Awww
---
I was sarcastically defending 1sters, of course I still want your help :)
---
I got 4.. how many did you get?
---
Holy balls thats amazing progress, if you need an extra hand getting shit working or pushing that towards a truly private server DM me (not a network guy but I do work in the data and technology space).
---
Copying Elderscrolls online. 😊
---
they have their servers. going on public ones wearing the ranger outfit and/or using the premium icon is just asking for trouble.
---
Not aha it’s not like that, for me it was a rare occasion so that’s why I’m making a big deal out of it
---
Yes it was!
---
You said you have no friends, and I dont have many that wanna play 76 with me. What platform are you on? My xbox is Redux Zef if you ever wanna play :)
---
They're both p2w, but only Fallout 1st is designed to be in the game. The other is not supposed to happen but players have exploited the game to profit. Bethesda didn't make the exploits, and certainly doesn't want them to happen. I'm certainly not going to buy duped items.
---
yep
---
Reporting for duty sir!
---
We do from time to time like to venture into general population to assist people with questings or nuke launches, ect.
---
And I will be sporting Ranger armor and tossing up gang signs (robot Dance FTW!)
---
Alright, I just find it suspicious. I'm not doubting it happened, but considering the recent timeline of events and the lack of post history it's better to be distrustful. I've seen plenty of obvious corporate accounts make positive comments to deflect from the issue at hand.
---
Nobody likes to be lonely man
---
My 6 year old always sits with me and plays. I can't give her the controller in WS since she just wants to shoot the guns and make her room in my camp super girly. Turn her loose in Watoga and tell her to stay with the buildings. Even if she hits a bot she won't agro them all. Tons of places to explore on the outside.
---
There is no Fallout Union.
---
This is not the UAW.
---
Just have 30stimpacks, running perks and first aid and run around all the time, occasionally getting a hit. I'm a melee build and usually get all 3 pilons but hardly ever die
---
Yes, it's a good deal until you realize you are reducing the chances that Bethesda starts giving us this stuff for free like they said they would...
---
I will continue to ignore everybody in-game, per usual.
---
Glad I got an immediate down vote on this. Eat a dick.
---
I think that if you put that much effort in a video game, you should stop playing entirely because you need a life.
---
Do what?
---
then take off the outfit before going into public servers.
---
You are humiliating us. Don't have words to describe you bethesda..... I won't spend another cent on you ever! Hope u will pay for what u have done. Die in peace.
---
so youre insulting people here who play the game? that isnt very civil...
---
Bring it on. I'm game for for pvp. First one to kill the other 5 times wins. No hard feelings just something other than scorched or mutants shooting at me. 
---
Yes it can be annoying sometimes,  but it can also be fun. 
---
Oh and P.S. Stealthboys are for fuzzy little girls.
---
On a side note do you guys think we could get a 4 v 4 on a private server. Enclave vs BOS. (5 deaths and your out) last team wins. That's the whole Map to play.
---
You’re allowed to enjoy yourself, it’s just stupid and irresponsible to ignore Bethesda fucking it’s player base over. People like you ignoring these disgusting monetisation decisions *is* a problem, it’s how we got into this mess in the first place.
---
Got it.
---
But the game is also ridiculously easy for us high-level characters. Why spend all that time and effort  trying to get god-tier items when your current items are already sufficient?
---
Awesome. I’ll be sure to hit you up man, you clearly know the inner workings of game production and are a wealth of relevant knowledge.
---
don't be surprised if people keep tossing pumpkin grenades at you.
---
If they had advertised from the start it was going to be a paid subscription type of game, I probably wouldn't have bought it. If it was a one time pay DLC, I would've been fine with it.
---
To me, the issue isn't so much the amount you pay, it's the fact that they most likely had this planned from the start and advertised the game would never be like this.
---
If they had said from the start that a subscription would've come into place, I would be expecting it at some point and thus not bought the game.
---
When I reach the cap limit, I'll sometimes overpay for an item.
---
If they want to waste their ammo and explosives, thats their problem. 
---
I stay in Pacifist.  They cant do shit to me.
---
You make a good point, it saddens me that people would make stuff up to take away attention from the negative stuff, which is good but not if someone made it up
---
They aren't praising the game, just the interaction it gave them. 
---
After the last few days, maybe there's been enough negativity  &amp; that might have inspired them to post something positive.. This post isn't promoting the game or fallout 1st, it's promoting  some of the people who play it &amp; that can be the best thing about this game.
---
I mean that I am the guy living paycheck to paycheck even though I make enough that that shouldn't be the case because of my bad spending habits.
---
TLDR: I am a pay pig that purchased fallout 1st.
---
Yeah I’m on Xbox :)
---
Looks lime I'll buy FO1st when wastelanders drops just because you're calling FO1st players scabs. 🖒
---
Probably a bot, gave an up vote for balance.
---
Some of the shit I've read in this sub is ridiculous. If you don't like it, that's great, if you do like it that's ok too. Get off your high horse.
---
Strong. Enough said.
---
that's not entirely true. which is why I said pumpkin, specifically.
---
also nukes. be careful where you park your camp. don't idle in general, really.
---
Damn dude yeah that sucks lol
---
I'd imagine if people keep making posts like this, it would encourage MORE people to do the opposite.
---
There is nothing else to do. I've had sufficiently good items after my first 100h. Then I switched my build and got them again faster. Trading and grinding for perfect rolls is all there is left to do in the end game. At least from my point of view.
---
Edit: hell after my first 50-70h
---
Well given that we have already seen the whole Nuclear Winter effect, I could see something work. Maybe color swapping it to be lighter (actually white instead of ash grey), slow down the rain effect to be more like a slow snow fall, etc.
---
Lol.  Now theres a union?  Who do we pay are dues to and what benefits do i recieve?  Oh and what day is labor day in fallout?
---
Everyone knows Bethesda games are broken, but they still keep making and selling new ones. Skyrim and Fallout 3 were glitchy AF, but fallout 4 still came out and ES6 is on its way. The only difference is 76 is an online game so people hold it to a higher standard for some reason.
---
Friend me! I've been playing on my ps4 today but I'll most likely be on my xbox tomorrow :)
---
Shouldn’t have bought the subscription, further enabling these con men.
---
I know what f'ing advantage means denotatively. Those bonuses aren't advantages as p2w. But you know what's an actual advantage? Trading on the forums with 2 characters caps worth for a weapon, or buying legendary item w real money.
---
I upvoted both of your posts. This community can’t take criticism of this dumpster fire of a game. Bethesda is out for greed and it shows with what you said. Basic game systems don’t work, some menus don’t load. But you can bet your ass that atomic shop loads perfectly every. Single. Time. I agree with you.
---
Maybe I'll buy a month, thanks for the heads up.
---
I just hate the fact that I never had a real pvp fight in adventure. It's always the same scenario. Lvl 5799876 enters your workshop throwing hearts. (To a lot of players emotes actually mean something) and as soon as you turn your back they one shot you with their explosive stuff using the glorified aimbot named VATS. And as soon as you leave they are gone as well. And really the game has a pvp mode.
---
i have enough scrap in my box to craft my camp from scratch 10 times over.
---
And its really easy to server jump if someone drops a nuke at my camp.
---
I have 2 minutes to move my ass.  Takes half a second to push power.
---
If you want to spend 30 minutes of your time, a shitload of ammo and resources just to try to greif someone who can run away.   Go for it.
---
If I was a billionaire I'd have a vault built.
---
I bought it ¯\_( ͠° ͟ʖ °͠ )_/¯
---
Out of curiosity, why do you use barbarian instead of blocker?  No judgement, just curious.  Flat out ignoring 45% melee damage seems like a much larger benefit, especially when you’re fighting nothing besides ghouls.
---
So there’s nothing you actually like about the game?
---
Running away from them also works.
---
OP pretty much just does troll posts I've seen it before.
---
It seems like it happened to me the day after the patch, but only once. Been silent sailing after that.
---
Fallout NV was balls 😅😂🤣
---
Fallout 3 and 4 are legendary
---
Fallout 76 is just as good
---
LMFAO. Just had to add my 2 cents. Seriously tho all the Fallouts are amazing altho I will admit that NV is my least fav out of the bunch.
---
My bad, I don’t stay on the sub a lot to see everything. I just feel bad for the players getting treated like this and wanted to make a post about it.
---
 Its why I bought a month. ;)
---
Obvious point incoming, but someone's gotta say it.  The problem with this formulation is that it doesn't factor in the quality of enjoyment and treats everything as a binary yes/no.  Also, you're not factoring in lingering enjoyment.  Let's say you go out with friends and have the time of your life--60 bucks for 6 hours ($10/hr).  Now let's say you're playing a game you don't enjoy THAT much but is better than doing nothing--$100 bucks for 400 hours by your approximation ($.25/hr).
---
If your sole concern is money/hours burnt, then playing Fallout has 40x better value than going out with your friends and having the best night of your life.  But if you had a 100x better time going out than you would playing Fallout, then $10/hr eclipses $.25/hr in net enjoyment value.  And if you and your friends can talk about that night out for *decades* and you think back fondly on it for the rest of your life, then the value changes completely.  Someone mentioned Endgame--my enjoyment of that movie was not limited to the 3h I was in the theater.   With large games that I'm playing to burn time, I get extremely low lingering enjoyment--hell, I often get lingering regret over time spent shortly after I quit playing.
---
TLDR, money/hours spent isn't always a good way to determine entertainment value.
---
***Edit:***  Even if you accept this model and talk raw time consumption/$$, $100 for 400 hours isn't even **that** good, certainly not *"one of the best you will find."*  Witcher 3 GotY is $15 right now and 180h is reasonable for a completionist run.  $.08/hr, not factoring in replay value.  Warframe and Path of Exile exist.  You can routinely pick up Beamdog bundles (classic RPGs enhanced)--the Baldur's Gate package alone is something like $8 for 350 hours ($.02/hr) with high replay value, about 11x more value than your FO76 sub estimate.
---
The interaction is very positive though, and gives a good impression of the community. The community of which is going through a huge split due to the issues. I'm not doubting an event like this could happen, but showing it so soon after some well deserved criticism sounds somewhat like deflection to me. It doesn't help that the account has no history to it whatsoever.
---
Or just run pacifist and ignore them. Seriously all the hate towards FO1st has me really thinking about buying a month
---
gunsmith. level 5. specially if you find yourself an explosive one.
---
Do you think you would have more fun if you just switched to another game? I spend more and more time playing other games these days (like right now I'm playing Fallout 1 and 2).
---
Want cheese with that whine?
---
You will have to risk communicative diseases, stock up on antibiotics and disease cures.
---
My heaaaart
---
That's experience talking. I'm a little dumb and generally I forget those things.
---
Back to the ranger armor, are you sure that the armor stays if the subscription ends? It kinda looks like a little tied to the 1st.
---
Getting 1st was WELL worth the money. See the up coming content isn’t free to make so in order to continue to keep the lights on the have to charge for something. Everything can’t be free. The atoms alone was worth $14. I’ve stacked so much from my server I don’t need anything for a long time. No lag. I mean it’s great.
---
Plaguewalker.
---
Sheep! Why sheep?
---
 Its why I got it. So far no one has seen fit to attack me, which is a bit disappointing. My main is kinda beasty though, maybe I'll try it on my low level and see what happens. ;)
---
you underestimate the power of a squad tossing rad grenades and mines around. whatever, I don't care either way. to me the most attractive thing about 1st is not having to deal with people, ever.
---
I beg to differ from mr. heretic01.
---
thx , i appreciate your comment. I'll follow your advice
---
haha, yeeeeeaap. pretty much
---
I'm level 80, never nuked anything too lol, so i think i have to reduce turrets number and try to see :D
---
Lol yeah it's an item from the shop :D
---
GM has been silent since the patch for me.
---
I checked one of your latest videos and I must say that your audio isn't that bad. It might be not high quality, but it's far from awful. And your voice is definitely good enough for making good videos.

that bloodied damage is what I want to be able to put out and still be able to use a gun if I just dont want to deal with things. Come a year from now I wanted to match melee builds with my own if I felt like pvp, to a point where nothing could get between either of us, not even the sbq. Really it's where I would want special points at and it seems maxing out strength and agility with 5 intelligence, 3 perception and charisma, and varying amounts of luck and endurance is how most builds go for a super hero.

&gt; As a Canadian I pay 15 to 20 dollars for a bottle of aspirin that you can buy for $8.00. (Yes, same make and size)
---
How large of a bottle are we talking about here? Because for $8 I can purchase a two year supply (two bottles of 365 tablets each) of low dose tablets.
---
 Well done. Some of us were born to trouble though. ;)
---
Wasn't talking about 1st just general players, always run away safest option.
---
Console player here but I can't believe it's not on steam yet. With how popular steam is this seems dumb.
---
I don't understand how anyone in the community disagrees with this. Would you not like to have a stable game and instead dump more money to get SLIGHT improvements?

a digital bandit throwing fake grenades at my fake persona does not impact my ability to walk across my living room and push the power button.

Thanks r/medic1089

&gt; she had the most beautiful voice I’ve ever heard,

 the first time someone noticed me, waved at me and spoke to me.

So when is the wedding?
---
DB Legends, every FF Gacha, DBZ Dokkan, Marvel Strike Force are some I can name off top of my head. FFBE has now started selling characters in their own 25$ bundle....except you need a dupe unit to make a 7 star.

Metal Bed plan for Fixer plan seems like a very fair trade. Sign me up. I'll throw in the Single Action Revolver Ivory Grip plan as well.
---
 Explosives! Really ... I can stand on a car and blow it up. I take a bit of damage but I think that's probably ballistic from crap flying around. ;)
---
This thread is glorious. 76 really is the shitty gift that keeps on giving.
---
I was really looking forward to private servers, but Fallout 1st has killed any desire to return to the game
---
Exactly right. I will in the near future get a sub so I can play with my 2 girls on a private server without worrying about other players taking away from their experience.
---
Writing has never been their strong point.
---
80/20 Pareto rule too.  They need to let another company fix it.
---
it's the rad portion you should be scared of.
---
Please understand that not everyone shares your view. I understand why some people are upset, but I don't share the same views &amp; there shouldn't be anything wrong with that. 
---
I did purchase fallout 1st, not to support Bethesda(Yes I know it does as I'm giving them money) but because it suits me playing the game with my son. 
---
He was griefed a bit by morons when he was low level &amp; it put him off the game.  I was always in the same world &amp; i would rush back &amp; kill  them. But when morons keep doing it,  it sort of sticks in your mind. Now we can play the game &amp; he can build up his confidence again.
---
People are buying fallout 1st for many reasons, please remember that it's not so right versus wrong.
