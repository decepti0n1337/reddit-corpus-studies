Hopefully in the future they implement some form of profitable base raiding. Currently there is no real reason to attack a base.
---
---
---
Platform?
---
I've never seen it and without this subthread would not even have noticed it.(not native English speaking)
---
Xbox
---
You‚Äôre the one who doesn‚Äôt know what they‚Äôre talking about. The way the RNG works is off percentage, you were obviously carrying mostly diluted stims which is why you lost them all when you died. It was more likely because you had 356, if you need to spam stims that much on survival you‚Äôre bad, which is why you died and lost them all. 
---

---
Even if you had full stash space you can sell the damn stims or just drop them. There‚Äôs no reason to have 400 stims just sitting there it‚Äôs not like they‚Äôre rare items be smart and manage your weight...
---
There goes that lack of comprehension...again.
---
What a guy!
---
You don't like modding?
---
Obviously Bethesda would ultimately control the cost of the items and which items get selected to enter the Atomic store. 
---
The goal isn't to make things cheap. It's to increase the quality and quantity of items available.
---
I have marsupial. Gotta see if i have the flux for it when i get on a bit later.
---
ü§£
---
Can we please not give them more ideas and reasons to break their agreement on anything P2W or non cosmetic in the Atom Store further than they already have? Thanks.
---
I recently found a missing poster for the kid from Wavy Willard's. I'm guessing its been there the whole time, but that was the first time I'd noticed it.
---
Ha that guy must feel pretty stupid leaving his stash in the open
---
Int gives more durability on stuff you craft. so if i ended up having 60+ and were to craft a full set of power armor. you wouldnt have to worry about fixing it for a lonnggg time. and also you get more materials from stuff u scrap. especially with scrapper perk. i had 20 int and did uranium fever and walked out with 1400 steel from guns and junk
---
and also if you have high intelligence, you‚Äôll do more damage with energy weapons with it as well.
---
I tend to get the perk cards I already picked myself. And mostly duplicates so not sure useful for me.
---
I have twisted muscles and adrenal reaction. 250 each. I'm on now, so join my game or send me a msg if you're interested.
---
Oh! I see. So Luck is better for farming legendary gear. INT is better for crafting it from scratch.
---
That's good to know. Might have to mull that over. Cheers!
---
And I found one on the Grafton Station vendor
---
Along with a Leather Traveling coat and a couple other ultra rares
---
Best day xD
---
I've experience this only in places like whitesprings where the bodies just pile up. It seems as if it clears them to make room
---
I got it as a reward for  one of Bivs dailies I just grab whatever I find and supplement it with everything Bubbles sells 
---
I actually had no idea about that one though, so that‚Äôs pretty cool
---
Which*
---
We burn witches. At least in FO4.
---
And my axe!
---
So saw it happening again last night on sell screen.  After I sold an item, it would scroll down to middle of list if I had alot of items and to the bottom if i just had a few.  For sure some kind of glitch and really pisses me off.
---
it depends if your a bloodied build or not if your not than vanguard if you are the bolstering
---
basically yeah! but its good to have some mid level luck so item u find got some good conditions. rn my CHA, and INT are high rn. was thinking of sacrafising 2 STR for more luck
---
Not Bloodied
---
Explosive build, I‚Äôm using grenades and some melee damage
---
than vanguard
---
With luck at 33 and crit savy, every other shot is a crit.
---
For those that don‚Äôt know, the creator and mods  of that sub got caught in an extensive price-fixing scandal that was seriously screwing over players. After getting called out and burned down, they tried ‚Äúrelaunching‚Äù, claiming they wouldn‚Äôt do it again. If you get confused about all the downvotes whenever they are brought up, that‚Äôs why.
---
Do yourself a favor and go Fallout Market instead.
---
The reason that tag is in the game is cuz it's also became part of a huge campaign against meat eaters saying I'm more than just a number. 
---
Bethesda was trolling them by using that number.
---
I mean what the point of making more armor, if enemy do not even attack me?
---
wdym
---
I mean that if my build makes my play like I‚Äôm one shot enemy and they do not even attack me, why should I use vanguard? Maybe using Bolstering smarter? Cuz if I‚Äôm in trouble it could save my life
---
If you are playing a single player game, sure (though you oughta play it at least once as it comes). If its a multiplayer game, you‚Äôre cheating
---
Why not go berserker build then?
---
You‚Äôll never get the rad resist for pa or a suit
---
They have hidden values too which prevent you getting rad maimed
---
That perk card is useful for fighting shit like charred ghouls who hit for HP &amp; Rad damage which can wreck you pretty quick if you get swarmed
---
Now, I say useful, for the above. But there are much better options for 4 points
---
Cuz it sucks I believe

Hi! Your post has automatically been removed because your post's title appears to be in breach of rule 6:
---
&gt; Use descriptive titles. Clickbait or extremely vague titled posts will be removed.
---
Reddit does not make it possible to edit titles, so you will have to post again with a longer, more descriptive title. 
---
*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/fo76) if you have any questions or concerns.*
---
Even then, their tactics have largely been drip-feeding content to make people spend more. They release a bit of everything once a week or so, so most people who like atom shop stuff end up with *something* they want to buy. If suddenly they have new power armor skins every day, I doubt most of them would get any traction
---
yea i guess it‚Äôs really your choice if you want better armor when you have more health or when you have less health
---
I did the same, except I took it all and slowly made my way back to my camp.  lol
---
Nah man vault-tec fired the bomb, theres too much creepy lore behind them. About how they knew it was coming, an how they got all those people in the vaults in enough time. Not necessarily everyone, but a large percentage
---
But if they arent hitting you anyways, whats the point of armor at all?
---
[removed]
---
It makes Sense
---
So everyone use vanguard if not Bloodied build and it‚Äôs good I believe?
---
yea for the most part if you aren‚Äôt a bloodied i would recommend using vanguard
---
&gt;.. looks just like the Overseer‚Äôs silhouette which can be distinguished by the hair from the former mentioned quest art.
---
Uhh. No.
---
If you make 2 color sihoulette of a woman, you don't have a great deal of pixels to work it, to make it apprear as woman.
---
Fuck bethesda for these challanges
---
Thanks! I also wasn‚Äôt complaining at all about the state of the game, I enjoy it. I was just genuinely curious what other people tend to do.
---
I didn't know about that! Now it makes sense! =]
---
Thanks for the feedback
---
I mean ya it is. Do you understand the lore of fallout? Not every vault dweller is a timid wastelander.  People are violent, look into the lore of fallout.
---
ok thanks
---
Good deal. Thanks for the heads up.
---
Really don't think so pal
---
I didn't know about the campaign! So, they probably did it on purpose...
---
Ok appreciate ur help
---
It sounds like you already know what you want.  Why ask for other people opinions if you're just going to argue with them over what's better for you?
---
Respec is not pay to win in any way shape or form. It would be used for switching builds for different guns or to fix a build that you may have messed up instead of making a whole new character just to use it efficiently. It's like if you're playing a melee build but then get a TSE handmade. In order to get the most out of that handmade you'd have to possibly spend 30 lvls just getting perks and moving points over, which if you're already lvl 50 that would take longer to do then just making a new character.
---
Because respecing isn't pay to win.
---
I think a mix of armor is the better choice, it does depend on your build, but a mix may work better &amp; help out in a wider range of situations
---
I run  3 unyielding a chameleon &amp; a lifesaver piece, but I do run a Bloodied build.
---
What‚Äôs the best subreddit ?
---
If you still need this lmk.  I can do it when I‚Äôm on a little later or tomorrow. PSN rip67
---
Just because moderators do not post often does not mean they are not extremely active members of the moderation team. There are hundreds of moderator actions each day or week taken by the team.
---
Checking Mod Matrix, In the last month there were  11542 moderator actions taken from our team. Just because each action isn't a comment from the team, does not mean we are not all putting in a significant amount of time into moderation.
---
I only slightly agree. I really enjoy the lowered weapons and for style map mod for 76, are they cheating?
---
That's what I thought: you can track down the one sheep that turned into the Sheepsquatch. =]]]
---
I'm willing to pay for content like DLC (like FO4 season pass) to cover costs and profit but I don't like seeing consumables in the Atom store.  The only time you see consumables in a store is for PTW or PFC items. Cosmetics do not need to be repurchased nor are thy destroyed when using them.
---
Yup sir! Tomorrow will be great! My psn is lucianoschaeffer so u can recognize me, ill add u tomorrow for sure, thanks!
---
Oh, ok have to try, thx for response !
---
yeah i was thinking this too, ask for peoples opinion then pretty much say wrong this is better for me like wha?????
---
....and please let us apply some different floor types to these stairs - I dont want the mesh version at all in my build, but would love the wood version.
---
Different floor types apply to foundations, so why not these stairs
---
Bethesda is all about the hidden Easter eggs. And any chance they have to use a number to hide a code they will.    Example being the crashed space station, the code for that 111418 is the release date of the game 11/14/18
---
Same
---
Assuming I understand your statement correctly,  I have to politely disagree. 
---
A mining helmet is meant for dark areas and a pickaxe in hand. 
---
I combat helmet is meant to protect your dome while in combat. Last thing i want is a light telling the enemy "shoot here". Lol
---
This made me laugh so hard..... Best post on awhile.
---
I think its a bug similar to how I can put the raider paint for excavator on the left arm of X-01 or ultracite power armour
---
This has been happening to me for the last two patches on ps4. Areas are also loading slower too and it can be frustrating.
---
Cripple it w enforcer!
---
The experience is more important than the atoms!
---
Thanks!! I appreciate it :)
---
Is this a joke?
---
I wish they had implemented a mini-map with those ones. Especially with 76's paper map look, a lot of map detail is missing for people who like a map to navigate by, rather than just showing what the general theme of an area you are in is.
---
There is LITERALLY a light on the combat helmet.
---
I can make that rifle on PS4.
---
Completing that crash course event right at the airport always rewards concrete.
---
Borderlands 2 had a feature like this.
---
Do you have any 5.56 by chance?
---
There is a way to remove it by adding an option to the custom.ini (would have to google it, im at work atm).
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Really do wish there was an official slider, I wouldn't even mind the music if it didn't destroy my ears every time I login/server hop.
---
Wait... there is? I never noticed that before. If it has a light, I agree. It should function. I still wouldn't use it for reason stated above. Lol
---
I can make the combat rifle as well but I won‚Äôt get the add ones like walking faster in sneak.
---
Ah, that's pretty cool, I didn't know that!
---
I would make the argument that Rad Resist could possibly be useful for low level players but it's not even obtainable till level 34.
---
Unfortunately, there's a lot of Endurance perks that really need a remake or buffed stats because they get far outclassed by other cards or items in the game.
---
Endurance: Dromedary/Slow Metabolizer, Iron Stomach/Thirst Quencher, Natural Resistance/Vaccinated, Hydro Fix/Munchy Resistance. All of these could be combined with each other into three point cards like Lead Belly or hell even two point cards. (Chem Resistant is only two points at the most in comparison) This would give us some better early Endurance options and open the way for some new Endurance cards to be created.
---
It would still me a nice function
---
I got the impression that was a Mole Miner. Gasmask, Heavy Coat, not human
---
Nothing has worked for me
---
Take off the scope
---
It'd be nice if the quest would complete properly first. I've got all the holotapes on the challenge, and the challenge completed, but not the quest.
---
You can get it as a reward from Technical Data, or you can buy it for around 500 caps on the market subreddits :)
---
I received it along with both the BoS jumpsuit and the Whitespring jumpsuit from a quest in Monongah, where you use a special modified Syringer to make creatures talk. You'll start the quest in a basement laboratory in the South Western part of the town.
---
Oh neat, thanks
---
I‚Äôve personally told off several people who briefly spammed the sub with trade posts.  When it happens, it‚Äôs annoying.  There is a bazaar sub as I understand it.
---
I honestly don't give a fuck if they get to choose what card they "trade" for, there's no "abuse", if anything it's the equivalent of getting a level. All they have to do is include some kind of cost in caps with each trade.
---
Honestly, it's a perk card, I'm level 138, which means I have well over 50 perks I could gladly live without. How would trading in a card for any card you want be exploited? I get a level, I get a card of my choice.
---
Honestly, the idea is stupid because getting a level accomplishes the same thing.. the idea is only useful if you get something useful out of a card you otherwise wouldn't be using.
---
Nah I want it to look like a hunting rifle not like a sniper rifle
---
My bad. I forgot people can't enjoy things and have an opinion
---
.... healing ......
---
I was taking a picture during the Free range event (BBQ shack) took a pic of a bunch of players herding cows, waved after taking it and ended up in Berkley Springs.
---
Armor's just so dependent on how much you get hit. Have a bad day and you can burn through the condition. Have a good day and you barely get scratched.
---
Cranberry bog is where the action is.

 Ash heap is too jittery ( performance wise ).

 Toxic valley is death valley.

Damn you're right. Still think the Overseer is either going to contact and bring in outside factions and/or open the Vaults to release NPCs who become the next generation of factions

To no upgrade right? I don't like how huge and clunky these things are
---
Just join my game in 18 minutes or so
---
She is still out there, which is why the quest isnt finished. We havent finished following her journey
---
Anything you do to tweak the game for any advantage big or small in multiplayer is cheating IMO.
---
Some people got plans to make "The Fixer". Maybe this dude can remake exactly what you need.
---
Got it
---
No there‚Äôs a couple of upgraded ones that still  look like a hunting rifle.  I can put them on if you‚Äôre on PS4.
---
There are a few spots in the top of the map close together Willards,Kelly monument, Phillipi (?) cemetery near Pricketts fort. I got lucky there after wasting caps all over the map.
---
I‚Äôve never seen one
---
They weren‚Äôt ever that great in terms of usefulness, but there are definitely times I could have used one. So I do miss them.
---
Thx man can u do me a favor and tell me what to change the stock to?
---
I didn‚Äôt know the plans dropped anywhere. Then I am sorry for the attitude. Like I said I‚Äôm pissed. Less than I was half an hour ago.
---
I‚Äôll be there. Thanks

Appreciate the feedback

It‚Äôs ok to tell someone they did a good job... I promise
---
There's a flashlight on the helmet.
---
That‚Äôs not the problem I have. When I was low level I maxed out 3 levels of a melee card but now that I have my full build together I really only need the 2 level version. So far the only way to get back to that that I know of is to level twice and re-learn that card. So now I have 5 levels tied up into 1 perk card.
---
Key word being advantage, both of those mods provide zero advantage so I don't see an issue.
---
I have been informed. Lol. I never noticed it before (probably because it doesnt lite up. Lol)
---
To be fair, I took a loooong break due to the unplayable nature of the game a few months back
---
Now it‚Äôs my go-to which I am throughly enjoying
---
Just a few shitty hang ups still floating around
---
Launch nukes and kill scorch queens.  I leveled up 4 times yesterday.
---
I believe so, If not, Im sure I can get some for your help!
---
Oh im counting on it
---
You could swap your entire build from melee to rifleman whenever you go to fight the queen(or even just encounter a scorchbeast in general).  You could swap points in and out of charisma whenever you join a team or want to buy an expensive item.  You could swap points in and out of intelligence when you go to craft something because its not like you need intelligence for xp anymore.  All of these things give you an advantage over someone who doesn't pay real money and needs to have a build and stick with it.
---
A pay-to-respec option is significantly closer to p2w than repair kits.
---
There have been other ghouls.  They lived in the Galleria until they were forced out.
---
Also please let me run conduit through the fucking thing.
---
and the old ones are still there clogging up the place and you have to move through em
---
So that's why my armor is like that, I stand corrected. 
---
My armor is indeed assassin and sentinel, but it says Sentinel's yatta yatta. I also have assassin sentinel poisoner pieces and poisoner takes precedence.
---
What if the map was clouded like skyrim or mine craft and you couldnt see or people or events or FT to them cause you havent been there yet?!
---
THIS \~NEED\~ TO HAPPEN
---
After doing three queen fights yesterday, and using the improved repair kits to fix my armor and my gatling gun immediately after, I'm a fan! Definitely not going to spend the atoms for the basic, will happily do a silo run and fight the queen and finish the event to get some more kits. 10/10 Bethesda
---
I'm corrected then. I suppose the game doesn't always take the primary for the name then?
---
IMO, if Rad Resistance remains a 5-star perk, then the Max Rank should provide something *close to* what the Hazmat Suit / PA do.  Maybe not as good, but enough to survive in a Nuke Zone for a couple minutes.
---
Right now, something as basic as a Trapper Torso with Lead Lining can get you 50 RR, which makes Rad Resist completely pointless.
---
I've got a marsupial and a healing factor sitting in my stash box right now, if you still need it!
---
So far found all mods for the crook but not a single staff, club or shard plan. Not even base ones
---
I‚Äôm in the same boat, i e been fighting the queen for the repair kits and viewing the other loot as bonus.
---
Fuck me. Your base looks like it had a stroke.
---
This is happening at random spawn locations?
---
Since micronukes can't kill things more than 20 levels lower than me, it's worthless for anything but celebration fireworks!
---
Yes I do!
---
Okay! You on now?
---
You have the choice of bald, or not bald, already.
---
What other choices could you possibly need?
---
The game in its current state is what it should have been at launch. Still a few bugs but nothing too major that I‚Äôve seen.  If your jumping in with a new character you will have quite a bit to do and explore.
---
Yes a random spawn location that I'm server hopping to hopefully spawn the albino deathclaw again.
---
I get the X and Y buttons (xbox) but both say Pacify... I can't figure out if that means make more budget space or what.

---
Why is this upvoted ? Then people will complain "this guy buyed 30 respect with 8 he can craft whatever he want and with the other 22 he counter my build in 2 minutes. P2W game"
---
I did the exact same thing. 
---
Early on, I just roamed and never really did any of the quests.  Not even "Follow the Overseer" mission.  I had, however, created a stash box at my camp and stuck some junk in there.  
---
Then, not long after, I started the overseers mission and came across the stash box at the Overseers camp.  I saw it was full of stuff, and got excited.  I hurried to grab all the stuff in there before someone else came along.  I wanted it all to myself.  
---
Then I proceeded to slow walk my over-encumbered ass across the map to my Camp. Only to arrive and find my stash empty.  It wasnt until after I stuck all my "new" stuff in there that it finally dawned on me.
---
Head-slap moment, for sure.

What are the drop rates of the improved repair kits?  Do they have a 100% chance to drop every queen kill?
---
Yes
---
Someone data mined new perk card animations. I'm hoping it is part of a larger overhaul of the perk card system.
---
I can help you now but you must come to my server psn is same as u/
---
Please have a mic
---
I have an explosive Gatling Plasma with the splitter mod. It basicly creates a circle of fire within which anything that is not a boss melts in 10-20 shots, which is great because the recoil is insane and that's about where it starts to become uncontrollable. Each core gives something like 250 shots before intelligence bonus to condition if I craft them, and the only thing that requires me to reload it is group bosses like the SBQ and the Imposter Sheepsquach. I have finished AWOL armaments with one plasma core.
---
Oddly, with Gunsmith, condition is a non-issue. Last time I broke it in a fight, I went through something like 8 cores on the SBQ nonstop because I forgot to craft more minigun ammo.
---
Thank you for this
---
That refers to legendary players. With no further info about that. Well, some datamined perks, but not how it actually works.
---
Adds an air of class. Purely decorative
---
If you exit the vendor's menu, wait a second, then go into it again, the items you sold to it will be in its inventory to buy. The server needs you to exit to confirm all the changes in both you and the vendor's inventory.
---
Annoying, but logical.
---
Yes they should have finished the quest and started a new one that picks up where she comes back in
---
It kind of looks nice i guess
---
I‚Äôd like some dreadlocks please if we‚Äôre on the topic of hairstyles üòì
---
Okay, I will be on in about 20 mins if thats okay! I have a mic
---
Then look at the comments, someone posted a very informative link.
---
All the time
---
Cool. See you soon üëç
---
I‚Äôm not sure but they vary with amount. It‚Äôs a pretty high percentage. I‚Äôd say more often than not.
---
One way of doing it could be is:
---
"Warning: Attempting to extract the data by force will likely trigger the self destruct program of the selected tape(s). The data in question could lead to a hidden requisition code intended for special personal only. Do you wish to proceed? Y/N ?"
---
Could dedicate this program to a small quest about some guy who delved into the code behind the relay towers and the requisition tapes. Every destroyed tape gives you a code fragment or something. Or, the guy could have a made a custom tape drive that can allow a terminal to read 10 tapes at once.
---
If you think being allowed to pay to move your special by paying when the alternative is a small XP grind (I‚Äôm 128 &amp; I easily level up once a play session) then you‚Äôve got a bigger grudge you need to let go of lol. As someone who has never spent a penny on this game I literally could give 2 fucks less about repair kits (you literally get the improved ones from the SBQ which is so easy nowadays) &amp; I could give 3 fucks less about special moving kits you can purchase. I‚Äôll continue to grind the free way &amp; enjoy my favorite game of 2019!
---
Benefits to crafting durabilty and condition max out at 20 INT. Anything beyond that only affects XP to a certain point.
---
My friends kid did this. It took both of us explaining to him that it was his own stuff.
---
if y can help me on PC ill pay 3k caps
---
i wish i knew brother i woudl pay someone 10k for this plan right now
---
I think it's the same, although I recently changed my Intelligence layout a bit so I could fit Nerd Rage in at all times, which meant Makeshift Warrior and Gunsmith took a hit to ranks 3 and 2.  I find it somewhat difficult to stay on top of the maintenance now because I've become lazy about farming and end up buying Bulk as I need it, because the parts required to keep all my gear in order are beyond what I can mentally track.
---
For the moment though, I'm sitting on about 30 Improved Repair Kits from SBQ runs.  They have weight, so I decided to use them, mostly on guns which don't benefit from being over-repaired.  While not a perfect solution, they do address one of the ongoing arguments about the SBQ not being worth the repair/ammo expenditure.  As long as she drops 2-3 Improved Repair Kits, at least you'll stay afloat on one of those fronts.
---
Right. Always forget. PC.

Wait what

I‚Äôve found the mods a couple times doing the Top of the World run. Starting at shooting range there are two work benches, then turn left and head towards the fire trip.  One bench just before the fire trap and then go up to merchants row. There are plans/mods in several stalls but at the end of the row there are three spawns in the last two stalls. 
---
Added bonus there are 3 lvl 3 safes and another spawn in the cabins to the left merchants row.

Yes that‚Äôs correct, certain effects lose the primary name slot to others. Like sentinel, cavalier, poisoner, or powered when they are paired with assassin, i.e Sentinel‚Äôs right arm, or powered left leg.
---
It kills me bc I have a chest piece with one on it but it‚Äôs a lvl 40 light combat armor piece from when I was low level.

I still wear it anyway just because of the dense chest. I need one bad.

I still can‚Äôt install the targeting hud

Am I the only one that thinks behemoths should be more common. Literally you could spend 200 hours in this game and not even see one.
---
Why so hostile? None of us were being hostile.  We‚Äôre just stating that it would be easily abusable.  No one even mentioned a cap cost before, the cap cost would 100% make it better because then its not abusable because youre actively losing caps in the process.  
---
Think of the past fallout games, you specced your character down a certain path. You made a specific build that you wanted, and they gave you limited options so you cant be OP in every single aspect. That is the purpose of picking a single card upon leveling, so you dont get OP in every single skill. If they give someone the option to just switch out a duplicate for any other card, then that person can and likely will become OP in every single aspect.  
---
If there is at least a cost or some other downside for trading one card for another card then it is not abusable. You would have to trade 2 cards for 1, or spend some caps, or put it on a timer.  That way you can still get a more OP build, but you cant just abuse the system by trading a card over and over until you get the new card you want.
---
It is redundant as you say, but still a cool concept
---
No, all random.

Possibly. I did the queen fight three times last night, and all three times I got 3 improved repair kits each

May I ask how you got the plans to be able to mod them like so?

Okay, Ill be on in about 5-10.  My psn is awheaton65

Yep. Right after they give it a least 1 DR. These paper armor helmets blow.

I did one run today and got three as well.

I can't say for certain as i haven't paid that close attention, but almost seems guaranteed at least 1 always drops.

What the actual fuck?! 2000 caps? Game crashes and its on us? This game is fucked up...

you dont get more xp the more int you have in this game, i have a buddy of mine who tested it out and his power armor white cond bar didnt make a dent when he crafted his x01 with around 40ish int.

Immersion? Lol. It takes me all of 2 seconds to yank the sheets back and hop into bed. As for getting up, you ever wake up and realize that you've overslept and gotta make it to work on time? Yeah, .05 seconds from bed to bathroom! Probably less when there's ghouls surrounding you beating on your ass.

This exact same thing, in the exact same spot, has happened to me before. I died.

More agi = more action points = benefit of staying in vats longer or running and jumping longer.
---
From what I've noticed since I started using unyielding gear and keeping low health, my farming has been far better. My drops prior dont even compare. I'm not sure if it is the increased luck or charisma, but i have definitely seen a mass improvement in both drops, rolls and starred legendary enemies.
---
I love how these events bring us together.

I criticized a mod, amd suddenly get TONS of downvotes? Not suspicious at all.

"I've briefly tried to ruin one of the few things pumping this community up". This place really has gone to shit. r/fo76filthycasuals it is.
---
Is this Deathclaw near a nest and a dead Deathclaw?
---
That one isn't tameable. I've tried myself on PC. I assume it's because the game doesn't consider it a "Lone creature" random encounter, the random encounter has to be a single creature and *only* that creature. If there's anything else, be it a another creature, corpse, or a world object spawned with the random encounter, it doesn't count. 
---
IMO, taming just isn't worth it right now. If you pet even makes it to your camp (which it doesn't 80% of the time), it is prone to glitching out and dying for no reason (had it happen to me) or permanently disappearing from your camp entirely (also had this one happen to me). Other players can also attack and kill your pet. If your pet dies/permanently disappears, you'll have to go tame a new one.
---
What are the stats?

There's other subs better suited for trading, no need to clutter up this one with trading/services too.

You're not the first to ask for this...it's been asked for since the beginning.

Train stations.
---
Are you sure you have not had your account hacked? I would change your password ASAP. It can't hurt and it may help.
---
Its a fucking shame that in today's world, Bethesda has not implemented two-factor authentication in this game.
---
I agree except for the ones that make your weapon last longer passive should only be cards that don‚Äôt give an advantage over anyone hacking lock picking and base building as well as modding weapons, because it‚Äôs out of control currently. Perhaps passive cards are required to be locked in so youd have to leave a dungeon to redo them so you‚Äôd want someone with lock picking and someone with hacking. And it could make dungeons more difficult giving people one path or another if they try soloing it, and it would prevent people from 1manning dungeons that are meant for 2 people minimum
---
This 'feature' has been in the game since day 1. The only time it's useful is when running the silos and all of the turrets explode.
---
I'd really like to see a clean shaven head. I dont mind the buzz cut I guess. I shave my head everyday, (for years because I'm so fucking bald anyways). And I really like to try and get my character to look like me.
---
I assume you got booted...?
---
Thanks. I didn‚Äôt think about starting over with a new character but I might try that.
---
We can rename weapons now...
---
Headed into site alpha
---
The other day I had a dead ghoul chase me. It was super weird because it kept slowly slowly creeping up on me from various angles. I walk up to it and can loot it whilst it moves. Was honestly super spooky
---
I‚Äôve been waffling on about having a 3 deck system for QOL since pretty much the beginning. It‚Äôll be great if this could finally gain some traction.
---
I would be cool with this more than repair kits. It's allowing you to use what you already have in a different way, not adding or modifying an object in game for an advantage. Still not cosmetic, but this is the least performance enhancing item I can think of...
---
Sbq?
---
I also agree with you and feel the cards should work around this way. It make things easier. I just want it to not be abused.
---
PLEASE let us have this Bethesda. When I turn down the music in the audio settings I would love for it to also turn down the title screen music like most other games.
---
Then let's try to get this idea off the ground and on Bethesda's front steps. I thought I was alone on this idea. Glad to know others were thinking the same idea.
---
My name is Zak Bagans. I've never believed in ghosts until I came face to face with one. So I set out on a quest to capture what I once saw onto video....With no big camera crews following us around, I am joined only by my fellow investigator Nick Groff and our equipment tech Aaron Goodwin. The three of us will travel to the some of most highly active paranormal locations, where we will spend an entire night, being locked down from dusk until dawn....Raw...Extreme...These are our Ghost Adventures.
---
I don‚Äôt think we will EVER get NPC‚Äôs but maybe they‚Äôll give us ONE (the overseer). I still don‚Äôt quite understand it. They never gave a really good explanation as to why we have to talk to robots for every goddamn thing. Of course I don‚Äôt make games so I wouldn‚Äôt know the intricacies but damn do I miss NPC‚Äôs. Went back to F4 not too long ago just to walk through Diamond City &amp; Bunker Hill always loved them man. Nothing in my heart will ever beat Megaton but still love the life it gave the game (for me at least!)
---
But you can max out
---
ooh fancy

I have four copies of Quack Surgeon. I‚Äôve never manually chosen it.
---
I thought I was just getting lag spikes, but boo on this being back. Only way I know to "fix" it is to exit VATS and re-enter, and it will work as it should. It's terrible
---
you still there bud? :)
---
I think that considering how buggy the game was on release, they didnt have time to implement the more complicated AI of NPCs. They have been working on them this whole time hopefully. We need alive factions like Raiders, BoS, Enclave, etc. That we can actually join. Each faction would give different perks and benefits but you could only join one at a time
---
Congrats? Bethesda sucks now and so does this game. :(
---
If you do a search on the sub, there have been many posts that got 500+ upvotes from over 4 months ago about just this thing.
---
I agree with you, but I guarantee Bethesda is aware we're asking for it.
---
Your post turns me off a little as in it seems more like promotion for yourself and "your" ideas.
---
I didn‚Äôt know that, gonna delete my comment now
---
yup
---
My strategy is to use weapon artisan on a drill, make it barbed, and use gladiator and radicool perks along with unyielding armour and the adrenal mutation. Barbed drill ends up doing about 100 dmg per tick, so I just sneak up on the Sheepsquatch and let it rip :)
---
I got a few early on in the beta that were useful and I still use, but haven't gotten anything useful in ages (and numerous repeats of the hacking and lockpick cards too).
---
&gt; As most of you know you need to collect code pieces to be able to launch a nuke. 
---
You actually don't need a single one. You can just look up what the weekly code is online. You only need the pieces if you want to actually trying decrypting it yourself.

How would it not fit the lore? We have a literal robot that fists people, a robot that gets drunk on alcohol you give it, and a hotel/mall entirely run by robots. A robot that collects and trades trading cars would 100% fit the lore. 
---
And even if it doesnt make sense lorewise, that doesnt really matter.  76 already rewrote several bits of fallout lore.  Super mutant lore was changed twice.  Originally the first mutants didnt exist until 2103, but then fallout 3 changed it to 2078, and now 76 changed it AGAIN to even sooner.  And theres the BOS retcon too, and im sure theres plenty more.  Why cant they do it again with some robot that collects trading cards?
---
Yes I do PSN yota151 and there are 2 nuke zones in my lobby

+karma  nice job thanks
---
Because you use the word "abuse" and it makes 0 sense. Literally, getting any perk card at all.. it's what you get for every single level. Leveling doesn't make anyone "OP". Nothing you've said makes any sense in regards to "abuse", trading in a card, even if you get to choose the card, cannot be abused. All it actually does is trade one card for another, that's it. Every time you level you get one.
---
So literally nothing you've said makes any sense, that's it. It isn't hostility, I think the entire idea is stupid unless you get to choose the card you want. The whole system needs to be reworked anyways, and the dumbest thing Bethesda could do is have players trade in a card for a "random" card.
---
I got one on tuesday. It was marked combat armor but unlocked it for marine.
---
Oh, suck!  Why didn't it have the camera?
---
Is it a one-per-customer, ever thing?  That would be dumb.  Hope you have better luck at the next spawn.
---
Looks nice, gives you a slight increase to accuracy, and serves as a good training tool for learning how to aim without properly aligned crosshair.

1. Yeah, don't PVP in power armor. Ever. Especially if the person you're going up against is out of power armor and appears to have very little health
---
2. Lots of people have that "shiny cookie cutter" armor nowadays, which somehow ends up being 10x better than whatever power armor you're wearing
---
3. You're not playing the game "as intended" you're playing the game the way YOU want to
---
4. They're not cheating, they're just smarter than you when it comes to PVP and armor and builds
---
5. Bobbleheads stacking got taken out of the game months ago, so that's a hard no
---
6. Chill
---
I did this my first visit to Red Rocket... saw a box and thought it was someone else's loot, took everything out and ported to my camp and went to put it in my box... found out it was my own stuff... It was during my first 1-2 hours of game play...
---
Much as I feel it shouldn't be an issue, I don't feel its a good idea to create a method that could result in people actively losing cards either (I can see this issue happening to someone eventually).  So either there has to be a hard limit on the # of cards you can't trade below or perhaps something like an extended cooldown per trade would work better (and prevent people from flooding such a vendor resulting in a line forming while people trade tons of cards).
---
when it comes to PVP a lot of things can slice clean through power armor. most Serious PVP players run pure damage resist non-power armors. like Sentinels Assassins prefix stuff. theirs is a +75% standing still and +40% against players. not specific damage types but everything a player can throw at them. yes there are ways to bypass it but only if you know about it.
---
I was so happy when I saw it on the corpse. Much less happy when I went to the armor bench to mod my chest piece.
---
Thank you so so much!!!
---
I understand there are a lot of assholes here. I want to help you, what power armor do you use?
---
yea i was fooled by that marine one a few times before they added the (known) feature
---
Nice reading. But I keep reading from reddit, forum or youtube videos; they said that anti armor and explosive combinations are bugged. Is it true? I can't find any comments from the OP or anyone mentioning about AAE bugged damage.
---
example Quote : " There were reports of ppl on reddit before and after nerf that stated  either the effects of anti armor and explosive do not stack correctly  with one another or is a bug, or simply just doesn‚Äôt stack as high in  damage compared to other legendary effects."
---
Same wheres the mohawks
---
   Fmk
---
They probably are, which is why the readability is a problem.
---
The AA effect on weapons with their corresponding anti-armor perk means your high DR is as effective as a wet paper sack.If you're up against bloodied, you're not going to beat their damage output. You have to get the drop on them and if you're defending in workshop PvP that's just not likely to happen as they control when PvP starts. 
---
The reason they're not in the PvP servers is multi-faceted. 
---
1 - Caps payout is now 1/8th what it originally was. There's no caps benefit to being there. 
---
2- Aid drops have been nerfed, and most carry only a bare minimum and don't drop anything. This ties into #1. Less loot means less incentive to be there.   
---
3 - Finding a bag with actual loot is pretty rare now. It was quite common when they first opened up to find jackpot loot bags. Piles of stims, a bunch of junk, etc as people weren't prepared.  Not the case anymore. Most loot bags are nearly empty.    
---
4- Many players game the system.  They enter survival with no caps, little to no carried aid, and no carried junk.    
---
5 - The amount of PvP exploits being used in survival is significantly higher.     
---
By contrast, many in adventure aren't expecting PvP and are carrying junk, have caps, and will payout on death their level in caps as opposed to 1/4 of it.

Getting one card per level is different from trading one card for another card.  You already chose your one card, you should not be able to just trade one card for another card of your choice at any point.  There would be no point to getting the random cards anymore, they might as well just give you 5 cards of your choice everytime you would get a perk pack instead. 
---
And say you didnt get to pick what card youre trading for, say you give up one card for a random card.  If its on a 1-to-1 ratio it is abusable because someone would trade the card, get one they didnt want, trade that new one again, and continue repeating that until they got a card they wanted. 
---
There would absolutely need to be limits on trading cards if it was implemented. Whether its a cap cost, a 2-to-1 ratio for trades, or a time limit. Otherwise everyone would be divided even more, youd have the people who would just spend hours trading cards until they got what they wanted to make a build much stronger than what they currently have and youd have the people who dont have the time to do that with much weaker builds. That wouldnt matter so much for high level players like you, but the low level players would definitely feel it because we dont have nearly as many cards as you guys. So those low levels who grind out their time for trading cards would be at a sever advantage compared to the regular players

Her corpse is not an unique object, but actually randomizes each cell reload upon entry.  It chooses from various raider tagged inventory items, so sometimes she is hooded or helmeted.  Her armor changes as well.  Her face stays constant being a present, but her overall appearance will vary.
---
I know what you mean.  I put a Dense mod on my 2\* Vanguard's Chest Piece at the time.  I've since gone over to Unyielding and have little use for it, but knowing how rare it is now, I'm not going to deal with it until I have a Unyielding Sentinel or Cavalier Combat Armor torso.
---
Thanks for the advice. I tried a few things, including a reboot of the router and it seemed to help. I played for about an hour without any disconnects.  
---
In addition to the reboot of the router (via its configuration interface) I did a release and renew, set custom DNS servers for my PC, disabled/re-enabled the adapter, restart of a switch (between the router and PC), and restarted of my PC. Whatever it was it seems to be addressed now.

Would you like me to remove this post?

Crappy part is once you hit level 100, all exp per level is doubled what it was for 1-99.
---
I recently grinded 60 levels from 107-167 to respec. It took 3 days and 8 hours each day at West Tek. With rested exp and relish. I wanted to die.
---
Then two days later the double exp event started.
---
Either way, it isn't a fun or good experience. The killer part isn't moving the points.. Its the perk cards. I needed 46 levels just for my perk cards.

I was going from 2H Melee and PA to Rifle VATS Crit and Stealth.

&gt; perk prestige system
---
Well, in the summer, they're doing a "legendary" player prestige system available to characters over level 50. Granting such players "more powerful abilities" or something along those lines. Perhaps perk will come into play with that.
---
I definitely think they could do more with Rose, or other characters in regards to events. Rose is one of the few characters to actually chat with you during quests and it was a shame they didn't do this more to help get over the lack of NPCs. I would love to see more integration of things like this in events (possibly leave an on or off toggle for players who do these events a lot) or even just have pre-recorded messages announcing the start of major events on the radio. It'd make the world feel a little more alive.
---
Thanks alot!
---
When I open your post, the title is there, but the the body of your post says [removed].
---
Makes me think the mods took it down
---
I remember reading this, but the build-up they give added to their limited details, generally sets everyone's hype levels up way too high.
---
This is one of the issues that just feels **so bethesda** that they didn't do. Since 2015.
---
I appreciate that! There's some things i'll do differently next build.
---
I acquired one yesterday from the inner Grafton vendor.  Not the one at Grafton Station - the one inside the town.  It's the same place I've previously found Dense mods (rarely, for all of them) for Trapper and Leather.  He also carries Excavator plans, so I'm not sure if that means the Camden Park vendor also has a chance of carrying them.  I verified that it was for the Combat Armor, not Marine Armor.
---
This is my second sighting in almost 500 hours of play.  To say this mod is ridiculously rare would probably be an understatement.  Now I know, though, that I'm not going to blow it on anything less than Unyielding Sentinel or Cavalier.  It's too hard to find.

There's hype around it? I remember it just being a single sentence. Rather hard to get much hype off that.
---
What I don't understand is I'm 110% resistant to every damage type once I pop my phsycotat.(as long as i have ap for dodgy to work) 
---
HOW is that different from 50% player damage and sent armor resist plus phsyco tat. I know the perk cards work with the power armor vs everything else in the game. 110% damage resist should be 110% damage resist. 
---
the only time I take damage is when I run out of ap from to many fast small attacks. 
---
that is the true source of my frustration. looking at the data presented on the perk cards they present a pretty clear picture. In order to achieve those resistances I had to sacrifice most of my quality of life perks
---
I'd say that there should be a cool down system of one trade per day (that helps keep the value of perk packs and would prevent people from taking up the vendor for ages at a time too, since plenty of us have a number of cards we would probably love to do this with).  I also would say the robot shouldn't be programmed to collect them all (since he would eventually get them), but should have been programmed to trade cards for some event or other (this explains why he would possibly not care about their value etc too).

Yeah I heard from somebody that they'll eventually fix it where you get better loot. Which why I hold onto em. But hasn't happened yet...so idk maybe trash can soon too for me

My armors been good, feels like my weapons degrade a little faster but honestly couldn‚Äôt tell you if it‚Äôs from a patch or just me using them more and not noticing

I wondered about this when I first bought it in beta. It's shameful and only a matter of time until passwords get cracked.

You're misreading me. People hype/get excited off what they hear or off information fed to them. When the information limited it's hard to  gauge where your excitement should lie.

oh ok well that still is good cause i used my last mod and i found a better chest so that gives me some hope till they patch it

Also, legendary armor perks are not active when you wear power armor, if that's what you're assuming. You only get what's on your power armor, nothing else stacks on top of it unless you take a chem, but that's not even really anything. Again, if you're going up against a player who has legendary armor with the best legendary perks, and you're just in power armor, you're getting mowed down. Also, your weapon sucks, which definitely doesn't help you in PVP. You gotta have really good perks maxed out and equipped and be wearing that end game type armor if you want an actual shot against people who are prepared 24/7 for PVP

No. I have a left leg that turns me invisible when crouching but not when im wearing power armor even if its underneath.

The adrenaline perk has really helped me deal with spongier enemies. The first will take the same amount of hits to kill but the second will normally take one less hit to kill then then third one less to kill and so on. You need to get a kill every 30 seconds to keep the perk going and to get it to stack and refresh the timer, but it‚Äôs been extremely helpful in taking down large groups of super mutants at their max level

Might have just been something on your router.  I have no idea how true it is but I remember reading something about how each time your router restarts it will pick a different server connection to use based on best speed.  I only know the bare bones basics of networking so probably not true.
---
no thank you I want help comprehending not free stuff I can get all the mods and stuff. recommendations and guidance is what I'm looking for, and I needed to vent.
---
You got kbow where to get the mods to mod it I just bought it and dont wanna be sadder than what I already am
---
Same on PS4, as well as random glowing grounds like the earth is radiating lava, uranium or borderlands eredium!
---
Good luck.
---
He returns by staggering you and heals 100%.
---
Now what?
---
I had to time a saved crit to immediately follow up a power attack juuuuust after a stagger.
---
Ok sorry i don't know much about pvp either
---
Not sure what your confused about. Just trying to prevent a hacker from stealing your legendary items and selling them off for money.
---
Two factor authentication: You log in with your password, the site / program then asks for a single time generated code that is sent to your cell phone by text or generated by an app. This is the same technology used by bank websites, gmail (and every other email site), and a variety of other sites.

Just add in the marine helmet
---
Not sure....but have an upvote on me.
---
I can usually kill him without him hitting me about 50% of time, but yeah it he hits me then I‚Äôm screwed LOL
---
8, could use more animal parts,otherwise pretty good
---
To sort of co-opt this discussion -
---
I've heard in the past about players pacifying (not taming, obviously) the Scorchbeast Queen.  Is this actually a thing?  Does it actually work?
---
I agree with lit3raltrash69. Power armor is a huge handicap in PvP. It's massive, so you can't hide, and it's loud. Good luck sneaking up on anything in PA.
---
A few weeks ago I noticed that when I started selling stuff the ‚Äònext‚Äô item was bouncing up and down instead of going to the next item down the list. I‚Äôve also had the issue where it refuses to go upward, dropping back down to the item I didn‚Äôt want to sell. 
---
I‚Äôve sold a few armor pieces on accident because of this. I‚Äôve had to slow way down to ensure that I don‚Äôt make this mistake again
---
You realize that dodgy is one of those perks that randomly procs, right? It's not like lone wanderer where you equip it and it works all the time. Also, if I remember correctly, dodgy is specific to melee attacks. And I think it's the same with blocker. It randomly procs.
---
Either way, you're not always at 110%. You're only at 110% when your psychotat is still working, and when dodgy and blocker both proc. They'd have to at the same time in order to have that 110% protection. And that's just for melee, at least with dodgy it is. That protection also doesn't last very long. So, while it's possible for you to have 110% protection, you have to be in a very specific situation in order to actually have it. Even then, you could still die in one shot cause your opponent has better perks and a better build and better armor
---
I concur.
---
No, there's zero difference between getting one card of your choice per level, and being able to trade a card for a different card. Literally, zero difference, at all. None. Zilch. You have the same number of cards, and you could have had whatever card you're trading for- you simply made a choice you later decided wasn't the right one.
---
There is no reason to need more than one card for a different card. Literally nothing you said makes any sense. Whether it cost 100 caps or 10 atoms.. any kind of "cost" would simply be for convenience sake, after all you can get unlimited levels, it's a matter of time until you're going to get whatever cards you want regardless.
---
Honestly, give up your argument because you must not understand how it works.
---
[The Combat Helmet](https://images.app.goo.gl/gb35PzoGC9pKJGKC8) is different from the Army Helmet.
---
The Death Guard's thing is durability. I would go with a standard mixed one hand mellee (chainsword/ripper), auto rifles (bolter/assault rifle), and power armor perks and then everything else into bloodied and damage mitigation. 
---
Here's maybe what I would do, though admittedly it is stretched pretty thin. If anything I'd maybe switch to either all mellee or perhaps big guns then use the other points into more damage mitigation

If they take inspiration from Fallout 2, the wanderer built a small tribe with wastelanders and an ancestor went to retrieve a GECK to fix their lands. If the Overseer wants any real change, it will involve a GECK, stopping MODUS, and their Scorched Plague. 
---
Maybe we'll get to explore another unused Secret SuperBase IRL. [**Mount Weather.**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Weather_Emergency_Operations_Center) This is where any Enclave remaining would be, only 30 minutes East of Harpers Ferry. Ironically Harpers Ferry is where another unused bunker is, for the secretary of interior. Where there could be a secret underground rail system connecting two government black sites.
---
Anyway that's my inspired fan version of how I would write the next chapter.
---
Thanks, I really don't care about fake internet points. I just thought it was a strange comment to downvote.
---
Yeah, people like their builds and it's a excuse to keep low luck. Good farmers know better. It used to be much lower luck needed than today. Level plays a part in the enclave lottery for x01 mods and you get more tech documents at higher level too. Basically level/luck.
---
skellyassassin. drop in whenever. If my team's full, just hang out anyway. drop your /u/ in the request
---
Nice!
---
I stopped using them once they included the steal from feature. Kinda ruins the whole point when you only get one use from it, someone can steal it, and you can't really share it like before.
---
Your tellin me. The dumb ass "I....what?" comment is getting upvotes. Who would have thought that people on this sub were for hacking and loss of items.
---
The whole reason I posted this was that I have seen a few "Where did my items go" threads and no one had pointed out that their account could have been hacked.
---
Honestly, idk. If you played a week you probably didn't experience it all anyway, so it's not like you know if it's the gameplay loop you dislike or just the bugs and imbalances. Those aren't quite gone yet, although the worst of it is gone. Duping is functionally gone, since now you get banned for it and most of the methods were patched. The damage bug can only be caused with an automatic tesla gun. Camps are *relatively* stable, and there are some QoL updates to them since launch. Energy and automatic weapons were buffed to the point where most of them are actually viable now - laser rifles/pistols still break after a hundred or so hits, and the alien blaster is still pathetically weak. Scorchbeasts give decent loot and no longer roleplay AC-130s. PvP is now isolated to workshops and survival mode. 
---
Although, obviously, they introduced a whole slew of new issues as well. Such is life
---
They just have a RR logo on the door iirc, they're just plain warehouse on the sides. They're not even that cleaned up because I believe people were complaining about the Atomic shop images being misleading because they were not as dirty as the in-game RR garage door.
---
That‚Äôs pretty awesome. I‚Äôm gonna follow all of this except the perception tree. Here‚Äôs my question, why not go for higher endurance? Is the HP gain per point not worth it? I was gonna end with around 10-12 endurance specifically for higher hp pool and more sprint. 
---
I appreciate the tank build though. I‚Äôm gonna use it but throw my syringer tactics into it.
---
Almost every train station, yeah. Just walk the tracks. There's at least two dozen of them every day
---
Personally don't give a shit if someone managed to 'hack' me and get all my legendaries in the game cause, ya know...just a game. I'd be more concerned about them getting my payment information cause that actually affects my daily life, but that's just me
---
Still happening, im on pc was using tesla
---
I run luck on all my armor pieces, except the torso. Haven't been able to find one.
---
Well the same account you use for logging into the game in PC is the same Bethesda account. So you kind of are out in the open without 2FA when it come to that.
---
Warframe costs a grand total of $0 to play, as well as allowing players to freely trade the premium currency in exchange for other items. There are plenty of people playing Warframe that have put literally not a cent into the game and are still rolling in cosmetics and rare items.
---
I had this with my two shot pipe pistol. I run gun fu and it only ever happens on the first enemy targeted. It will go away if I immediately un-vats and vats and fire before the hud animation finishes.
---
Damage needs to be at least double for each one. They were already garbage on launch, but nerfing demolition expert just made it worse. I have an anti-armor missile launcher that I use exclusively for shooting scorchbeasts while they fly around. It still barely does any damage to them with demolition expert.
---
Doesn't he know he shouldn't get high? He's really putting his life on the line this time...
---
A lot of the perks to help mitigate damage don't work in Power Armor so I used the points for Endurance for other things. If you arnt going with the Perception perks I would drop that down to 3 or 4 and put them into Refractor for more tankiness then use the remaining into endurance for Life Giver or more Adamantium Skeleton or something.
---
Get legendary versions of the rifle(bloodied/anti armor/two shot).
---
Get the adrenal reaction mutation if you are comfortable playing at lower health.
---
He did mention he uses Gun Fu, I don't however. So maybe that's the difference at least with his experience and mine... Hmm, interesting.
---
They didn't point it out or go to "hacks" cause items disappearing has been a known bug in the game. And thanks for calling me a dumbass, crazy ass ;)
---
Awesome thank you
---
No problem man
---
Is your IGN Wheeldogz?
---
Uses casual lining, which if memory serves, isn't in game outside of the dev room.
---
Go to Harpers ferry to get treated and resistant linings
---
There are bugs and issues getting the other linings
---
I'm having fun doing my own stupid stuff in the game. but this game has so much potential but yet the cool small things to do are duds. They really need to add minigames. be able to put stuff on shelves. and be able to make settlements like they have in other fallout games. I got the dartboard thinking it was a minigame
---
Bloodied mess in Luck 
---
Better Criticals in Luck 
---
Tenderizer in Charisma 
---
Demolition Expert in Intelligence (if it‚Äôs explosive)
---
Nerd Rage in Intelligence (if a bloodied Build)
---
Tank killer in Perception (ignores targets armor)
---
Thank you for all the work in supporting game and the community.
---
I'm going to get more of the wall mounted heads and use those in the next build more, thanks!
---
Im done responding to you. Other people have agreed the system would be abusable, anyone can see that. Youre clearly not understanding what ive been trying to say, because youre responses have generally not understood my point.  Ive tried to rephrase things several times and to explain my points differently, but you still arent understanding.  Theres no point in me trying anymore
---
I have the Abraham Lincoln outfit
---
Nice so there under mods ??
---
Got it done but thanks
---
Happy to do it :)
---
You are literally the first person who has expressed any concern about TFA in the game, and I'm still lost as to why cause you sound kinda crazy. You already have to sign in to your console or PC when you want to play the game, so why the sudden demand for TFA in the game? The sign in to the game is automatic. If you're that concerned about someone hacking you and taking all your fake weapons and armor for real money (which, lets be honest, we can both agree how dumb that is: paying for in game weapons/armor with IRL money) then if you're on console, make it to where no one can sign you in unless they have your password. With PC, password protect it, too, upon start up. If shit hits the fan, which I hope it doesn't, then I hope you know what to do in that scenario
---
Oh fuck. I interpreted that wrong too. Fuck me.
---
Awesome
---
üëã
---
aaaaah.
---
Incisor alone brings my resistance to their melee damage down to 85% all by itself. THAT is the missing peice of the puzzle . I thought that incisor would bypass the armor value of the peice ie i5 50 physical armor it would do 25 percent over on phdsysical damage. 
---
add in the fact that the fist is anti armor as well. 
---
then multiply that damage that gets through by all the bloodied perks. well that makes a lot more sense now. 
---
to look at the rest of your post seems like I'd have a better chance of defending on the pvp server. instead of waiting for them to initiate I could just post high surrounded by turrets and gain first strike advantage. 
---
im getting ganked anyway if I get ganked there I might as well pay out less caps. 
---
thank you for bringing clarity to my armor conundrum. that was the explanation i needed.
---
Very late to the game.  When you step up to the red laser grid at the elevator on the first floor, a voice says you cannot enter.  Recruitment blues should start.  4/28/2019
---
Have them repaired to 200% condition
---
been broken since patch 4 or 5,
---
I use hard bargain rank 3, grape mentats, and beer with party boy level 3 equipped. I only have 7 base charisma though.
---
I got one
---
Thanks. The little biscuit followed me all the way to the pond which was a longer journey than it should of been thanks to the mountain wall. :\[
---
[Here's](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/330511405264535552/572254926680621066/unknown.png) the crappy picture I finished it with.
---
The Tattered Mole Head actually gives you 1 DR but I haven't seen anything else provide any.
---
I made similar post about respecing Specials. It would introduce variety of gameplay, made it more interesting.I would like to try so many builds but I cant be bothered to wait 50 lvl to respec char and another 50 to change back or go for something alse. New character is out of the picture to. Grinding through same areas that I already spend almost 250 hours of real time, would kill me.
---
Unfortunately peoples didnt like the idea to much. 
---
Still dont get it why.
---
Dodgy always works as long as you have AP. That's the kicker though as it takes 30 AP per hit. Anything automatic will leave you with 0 AP in short order.
---
I'm not actually lying i never have i always read the title of it twice and it says something about it going to yours or what ever
---
I found them thank you
---
I found some that I can put on it aint no marine suit but hey I'm happy it wasnt a waste
---
Yes it is. Weights go farther in significant digits than the display does, and stacked items round. To test, pull out all your plastic from the stash box, then bulk a bunch, then put the bulks back. Always bulk everything.
---
She is proving that fall damage is a myth spread by the government
---
The Marine Helmet has DR. It's from the Dev room, but Bethesda didn't take it away from everyone. Scrapping one gives you the recipe to craft more.
---
your also wrong about dodgy every attack cost 30 ap and it procs every time regardless of the size of attack as long as you have AP. I think your mixing dodgy up with  serendipity. 
---
and you are correct as long as i pop phsyco tat and have AP i am at 110% my frustration was not understanding how the damage was getting through even with phsyco tat and ap but I didnt understand how anti armor perks and weapons worked. now I do I'm less fristrated now.
---
I truly hope that is the case if she ever falls...
---
So in the PVP server they can get in your stash?
---
lol no but i have seen that guy around seemed friendly !! my ign is garlandtd.
---
28.
---
Just go into the trade with agreed cap values for the items. Example I want item A and you want to trade for Item B. Both items are worth 7k respectively. I offer item B for 7k you offer item A for 7k. Once the trade is done you both will have the items you want and your caps back and if someone try's to scam at least you have the collateral cash.
---
I'm close to level 200 and my advice is to accept that taking a workshop is die at least once. If they gank you fast, server hop and try again at another workshop. If you don't want to PVP (which with your set up, you don't) Crouch while you're at the workshop. 
---
The way the game is, you can't rely on perks and chems to keep you from harm. Next guy is gonna have a bloodied sneak build with explosive rifle. Boom, you're dead. Then it'll be a team. 
---
Unless you're outfitted perfectly for PVP you're going to die a lot if you keep taking them on. Maybe even then. Relog and save caps. Those guys are douchecanoes.
---
2k
---
You're brilliantly mad. I like that.
---
Dude, let's talk about this crazy trend of spending real money for some meaningless code.
---
I play with a group of people that know people, that know people. Was playing today with one of those people of people. He paid one of my buddies $20USD to collect all the necessary junk to craft cryo cells.... Mother fucking ammo man.
---
I was mind blown.
---
Damn, I didn't know that. Bethesda better ready up the Ban hammer.
---
Are you sure or just guessing
---
Love the webpage! My suggestions would be to add a section explaining how to solve the codes (since I always end up on Nukacrypt for them, might as well have an explanation there :) ), and links to Bethesda's streams.
---
I also really appreciate the map initiative! Keep it up!
---
Sure. It‚Äôs one of the last to unlock though
---
its look ok.
---
but it looks like The Red Power Rangers helmet.
---
needs Nuka cola Writing on the sides.
---
I can mod it for you if you don‚Äôt want to wait to unlock it. If you‚Äôre on Xbox
---
Yes and no. You do need to have time to grind unfortunately, which I really dont. Im not bother about kits, will bever use them. No need really however to be able to respec by in game content, (not p2w) would be so nice. I havent play a single mmorpg whithout this option (WoW, Neverwinter, Guild Wars, ESO etc.)
---
I don't like it.
---
I LOVE IT.
---
I've scrapped tons of hunter rifles and I haven't gotten the .50 round yet I haven't gotten any mods in ages that's why I'm not sure if you can it must be a rare drop
---
He paid $250...for junk...to craft ammo?! Literally what the hell?! Why is THIS not talked about more omfg
---
Guides are in the works :) , should be the next finished thing actually.
---
20 atoms for this one, but I still agree with your reasoning. I was hoping two separate shots would do the trick. Getting pictures after their death is a nice trick as well.
---
I have noticed a different with pieces breaking faster now.
---
For the past 2 months I've been pretty much done with the game but still logging in to do daily challenges which would inevitably get me hanging around, chatting with people, trading, etc. These challenges have been such bullshit lately that I didn't even log in today or yesterday for seriously the first time in months.
---
Well $20. But yes. He's not the only one that does this. My buddy that did all the shopping often buys 3* legendaries with cold hard cash. 
---
Just don't get it...
---
Sneak attacks
---
Aw heck yeah! You've been putting in the work bro, when you getting that Patreon?
---
Smh I read that WAY too fast I'm sorry üòÇ $20, still ridiculous. Just use caps or do trades for in game stuff like damn
---
Magnetic personality in a group.
---
Also sweet roll stacks with grape mentats (maybe beer too, not 100% on that one)
---
yeah your right thats part of what bugs me. I want power armor and gatling laser to be able to hold their own at least. If im not using those two things I Have no reason to take a power plant for fusion cores. however because I do use them and like them very much I am kinda stuck farming them unless I want to server hop at whitespring all day or run around with a bunch of 25% full fusion cores in my bag. almost empty fusion cores weigh as much as full ones and I use 2 to 3 fusion cores per scorch beast and about 10 to 15 per queen fight. even with batteries included they start to get heavy after 40 or 50.
---
Ok then it wasn‚Äôt me! :0
---
Both these guys are avid collectors. One main and four mules. And trust me, they trade with caps and cash all the time.
---
No, it's whiskey. All my God roll gear has been dropped when I was drunk on whiskey.
---
Dont get it why they down vote You. Respecing is something this game needs to refresh gameplay and avoid boredom of being stuck in one build. Like I stated before I havent play single mmorpg whithout respec option.
---
That's insane holy cow
---
They left it in on purpose. They could have removed it if they chose.
---
When they did the dupe-scouring, they left 1 of everything in characters inventories instead of 0.
---
¬Ø\\\_(„ÉÑ)\_/¬Ø
---
God, I hope not. A guy I randomly bumped in to gave me one... Should I toss it?
---
Is there nothing this big won't eat!?
---
No I'm on Ps4 but thanks anyways
---
I prefer my lever action. With all three rifleman cards maxed and a hardened receiver, my base damage is 149. Add bloody mess, tank killer and all that, I‚Äôm pretty happy. 
---
I have a junkies lever action though, I have to stay on the edge of drunk to bump it up to 180 
---
I prefer being a sneaky sniper over a commando. It‚Äôs all about your preferred style
---
Right now actually!
---
Well the 50 cal mod for the sniper rifle isn‚Äôt worth because I‚Äôm fairly sure the 308 does more damage
---
Sorry I was saying it in a joking way in my head when I wrote that. They probably won't ban you but instead remove it and flag you as a cheater. You should be fine but you never know.
---
I was able to find the .50 round schematic at one of the stations months ago before they made them all buyable. Just look around abit. But be warned the .50 is less damage if I remember correctly.
---
I cackled at Level 18 bambi
---
Oh no.
---
I just said that instead of the two I'm going for which are combat rifle .38 and pipe revolver .308 I didnt say pipe revolver because I haven't found any proof it exists but a single thing that does and I think it does cause the same website says it has a .38 and I did get the .38 from an event
---
Yes, for some of them they are really dumb. Not worth the time. 
---
I don't like the daily level one now either. Some times it may seem easy to put together the three options (might only get one level, if that, since I'm at a high level already, so I've got one shot). But then to remember to be in the right place, wearing the right clothing, just at the time I hit my level, uh, no thanks. I skip it every day , even if there are easier ones on certain days. I wish they'd do away with that challenge. Missing 10 atoms, at least, every day.
---
actually i helped him defend red rocket, blew up a car and got wanted then had him kill me to clear the bounty.
---
.309 pipe revolver sry
---
No. They're all learnt from plans only, and so you don't find many since they broke the vendors.
---
Flag me as a cheater!? You aren't making me feel any better, I'm 100 percentage ditching it.
---
She involuntary gave me 3k caps earlier
---
Yeah. Great bunch of guys though. Even if a few of them are looney toons.
---
Yeah the vendors are my biggest problem set plans are cool but I'd rather have the randomized
---
Ok have fun adventuring the wasteland
---
Fallout 3*
---
That only gives extra damage for melee weapons.
---
Joining now, thanks for the heads up, I‚Äôll give karma post SBQ battle
---
Oops
---
If the description of the mod says "changes to automatic fire" it becomes automatic. The mods that do this generally have automatic in their name as well. Everything else keeps it as is. 
---
Hunting rifle stays non auto through all its mods. Handmade rifle could be turned into an auto with any of the"automatic" receivers.
---
In terms of rifles, the only difference in perks are using Rifleman for non auto damage, and Commando for auto damage. Both rifle types are affected by Tank Killer, Long Shot, and Tormenter.
---
You also lose armor resistances and added carry weight. Just consider any armor unequipped while in power armor (sometimes it shows as unequipped in pipboy, sometimes not)
---
Nope....works on my levers and handmades
---
I think they all stack. I got some great prices combining the 3.
---
Dope sauce.  I‚Äôm pretty picky but solid 9 my friend.
---
Good feedback thanks
---
Same to you. Now back to tracking down the overseer. Next up, the top of the world!
---
Mine stopped following me once, I just kept running in front of it and took off my weapon and was about to fist it but it howled and bit me and started following again.
---
Adrenal reaction mutation can boost damage at the cost of heath and stacks with bloodied weapons
---
Testing suggests that having 14Chr and rank 3 Big Sale gives the best possible price for selling and buying. There is a cap on how much you can affect prices.
---
Thanks to all of you though
---
It not necessery needs to be bought for atoms but rather as a in game content.
---
Having all inteligence perks I can craft whatever I want anyway so it doesnt make a difference do I respec or not. Having hard bargain perk and grape mentats influences sale anyway, how ubout unyelding set increasing stats? 
---
Discussion is more in regards of changing gameplay and trying new things instead of being stuck forever in same character build or grind for x amount of hours (taking into account one have as many) to respec and change back if something doesnt go to the plan
---
Changing gameplay style is refreshing and ads variety and makes game less boring.
---
Not a single mmorpg is whithout this option.
---
I think it is outside bravo silo. The one near the lake. Inside the building.
---
I got starched genes from my level 30 pack. Just saying.
---
I have hundreds of them, I only use them to give gifts to clusters of low levels!
---
The green website makes me feel like puking
---
Think they mixed up the short and the long barrel too.
---
SPOILER 
---
There is a spot you can find one every time. It's a bit southeast of The Vantage (which looks like a pair of binoculars on the map), which is southeast of The Whitespring Resort, but before you hit the mountain ridge. The behemoth is chilling in a lake. I dropped a map marker there for awhile, so I could return to kill it a few times, day after day.
---
I do think they should be more common though, and found wondering around more. Maybe they could be apart of a wondering hoard of mutants. The only other time I see one is the occasional attack on Whitespring, usually during a nuke.
---
I know the traveler's leather coat has a backpack. Not sure about the rest
---
agreed that has been my standard MO . I only put in the work bench resources and I dont build them up much, duck in and out only to collect resources and defend from the pve spawn, if it gets contested  I just server hop. I went through considerable effort making my character tankier so I would be able  to stop running and it was all for nothing. Worked really hard sacrificed all my Quality of life perks and it failed. it took about 40 levels or so to shift from my old build to the new one i am super dissappointed it was for nothing on the pvp front. On the bright side I can face tank the hell out of everything on the pve side now.
---
I would love to have really long hair as a male character so I can look like myself. The current option is only just shoulder length.
---
I kept getting its attention back several times, but it would always give up after a certain point. Didn't matter if I tried leading it elsewhere either. Didn't go any further wherever I went.
---
I think their are, but they are purely cosmetic and part of an outfit... however, a future update will have backpacks available that will increase carry weight, maybe other benefits.
---
Mission accomplished
---
I don't know what level you are, but as a stealth character I obliterate it from a distance without it ever laying a hand on me, or even seeing me.
---
Storm chaser works in the rain, so have used it when that happens sometimes.
---
The green isnt great and may get changed in the future, but I wanted to keep it close to the original for now.
---
They seem a bit puss
---
Two shot sux.
---
you can earn atoms in game.
---
Suger Grove bunch of beer bottles You can get springs, screws and some oil needed  make some of the explosives
---
In case you didn't see the other comment above, you can just buy your stuff back after exiting and re-entering the vendor.  Yeah it sucks that you lose a lot of caps, but at least the stuff isn't gone for good.
---
Needed so badly.
---
You rock!
---
Sometimes it glitches out and works, but this is like 0.002% of the time, it happened in F04, and some earlier versions of 76!
---
 Christ no. Her voice is fucking grating. I could not get through her mission fast enough and she's the reason I wont be making a new character.
---
Where is this located? I‚Äôve only listened to one holotape about The Interloper near the Mothman Museum but I‚Äôd love to learn more.
---
Do you know the trick about firing, then zooming?
---
The sight is trash, but it's still my favorite heavy.
---
Power armor weakens melee users!

If you give him chance, yes. If you attack first, he had no chance tho.
---
Just because I am one of a few who have voiced a concern (not the first. Search for yourself) doesn't mean my concern is unfounded. Two factor identification has been a mainstay of MMORPG games. Blizzard used to sell 2fa dongles. Eve online sells them today. Fortnight of all  games uses it. It's common place in the MMORPG field and it's rediculous that I have to shame Bethesda about it. 
---
I have played mmorpg games for 20 plus years. I have had my account hacked multiple times. I have lost all items I accrued over many years of play. I have had characters deleted. I have had accounts completely wiped and had to start over from scratch. In none of these cases did the publisher of the game do a thing. So yes I am calling for two factor authentication because a single password in today's age is not enough. Not when brute force programs can crack any word in the dictionary and substitute numbers and symbols for letters like people tend to do.
---
I didn't call you a dumb ass, but I sure did call your post one. You brought nothing to the discussion about the use of 2fa. It would cost Bethesda barely anything to use it and most likely would be optional. So if you wanted to not use it you could continue to do that.
---
For real though
---
Yeah it was &lt;3 
---
Next time please don't kill people, there were 3 guys with red arrow on head, i had zero ammo and 214caps is a lot. I was super stressed. Thanks god they didn't notice :D
---
To my experience blueprinted ones don't work, as them working relies entirely on what slope you can clip them onto!
---
He's at the lucky hole mine west of the cranberry bog. Theres some narrow tunnels inside and I went through some dead cave vines that lead into a secret tunnel where I found him and the cult members.
---
I'm aware it works in the rain, the problem is that it doesn't rain very often in the game and in my time playing since the Beta I've seen about two rad storms in total. 
---
For how rarely those events occur it's just not a good perk and it becomes highly situational. Now sure you could switch it out when rain or a rad storm starts but is it always going to happen when you're in combat and can truly use it?
---
Allowing it to include Nuke Zones would make it far more useful for the combat situation you would have in a Nuke Zone.
---
Right!? They treat style like it has some kind of relevance in the post apocalypse. I wanna see guys with polka dot hair cuts and bald women wearing a rat tail damnit!
---
Rad storms are indeed rare, rain? It rains almost all the time!
---
Look for IGN jims1973, he does them for mats. Great stuff. He has some posts here too.
---
Thanks so much, I completely forgot about this.
---
Wtf you got downvoted even though you're 100% correct
---
I've not had any ultracite armor mods for my last 17 SBQ kills...
---
Heres a picture of his full body. If you dont want how he looks to be spoiled then I wouldnt suggest clicking [this link.](https://www.reddit.com/user/BlackDog2774/comments/bijx62/the_interloper/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share)
---
I got lucky with my last card pack as I needed power patcher, and was going to take one level in it, but I got it in the pack instead. That's about the only one I've had that's useful aside from filing empty specials in the first ten-twenty levels
---
Im not saying get rid of the legendary, just get rid of the exploding effect legendaries have.
---
Can you craft one? Or do you need the broken base model?
---
Yeah, its decent workaround, its just kinda silly that the only sight it has doesn't function. I agree though, still my favorite heavy!
---
I had a ghoul do the same in Fort Defiance after I one-hit it while it was sleeping; spooky as hell.
---
Thank you guys for the info, I was just curious cause I didn‚Äôt think it was possible to have the carry weight item, but thank you again!
---
It‚Äôs cause my tag is raider üëç
---
shes a she? sounded like a he. hmm maybe the name was hotwheelz now that i think about it.
---
Ive blocked automod.
---
I have no idea where to find what mats they require
---
Maybe for you, it's fairly rare when I get on most servers.
---
But you got those sweet sweet repair kits.
---
So small and subtle! 11/10!
---
It's not really worth looting, the reward is the quest, the body is just a normal legendary with incredibly rare chance of having anything decent, yes it has the potential for a 3* drop, but you have a better chance of winning the lottery!
---
Even before repair kits got added!
---
Nope. Ive got mostly duplicates and crappy perks that don't pertain to my build. Ive got like 3 different copies of Concentrated fire.
---
Bethesda needs to implement a reroll system for unused perk cards at the cost of caps.
---
Like you would put three cards into the reroller and it would give you 3 different cards.
---
Y used to week hunting down the plans and now want to buy them for 750. Two weeks of caps collecting from vendors is 19600 caps. If you can come up with that I'm sure you get them in no time... Seriously not serious hehe.
---
I‚Äôve used .38 receivers lots on the combat rifle, definitely got them from scrapping.
---
Lol today i accidentally broke into someone‚Äôs camp and when it said I was wanted I thought ‚Äúaw shit here we go again‚Äù
---
Or give us the ability to change it.
---
Think about it. A robot that loves perk cards? Perk cards is just a game-element like skills that you select in any game. 
---
A robot that loves alcohol is not strange to me, it can be programmed.
---
But a robot that you want would be like a robot that is aware of the actual game. Not sure what you mean with a robot that fists people?
---
Thanks that's the proof I needed
---
You can get repair kits from the SBQ? Well that explains why I have 2 repair kits.
---
Same here.  When your lvl 300 and there is little to no chance of getting equipment you want since it's all fucking random drops, you switch to something you can do like collect atom to get fun skins.  There is no way you can convince me that this is not intentional.  We get radstorm challenges which are virtually non-existent, we get camera challenges when it's not even out, we get alien picture challenges that don't register, we had ridiculous alcohol challenges, just to name a few.  The Plague skin cost 1800 atom, that's a month of grinding.  But I guess they gotta pry the money outta us some how.
---
Except that you can't explain what would be "abused", and instead hide behind "others agree with me". 
---
Unless someone is under level 75, it's doubtful *anyone* would even use this trade in feature. At. All.
---
The best case scenario is that someone chose lockpicking for a skill, and rather than simply get another level *to choose any skill they want at all*, they would trade in a card for something "better".
---
Once any player is level 100, it's almost 100% certain they have any and all skills they will ever want. Being able to trade a card for any other card isn't going to make them stronger, period. Full stop.
---
So the only people that could "abuse" this are people that are too lazy to simply level up. That's it.
---
If you have some sort of explanation for what this supposed "abuse" would be, you need to explain it in some way that makes sense. Otherwise you can hide behind the excuse that other players agree with you.. when the reality is that they need to be equally uninformed about how the game works too agree with you.
---
But that's okay, because they may be noobs too. You'll learn that perk cards have very little effect, and that you don't need a high level if you've built your deck right the first go.
---
Clean lines. Nice use of space and having defined separate areas. All grown up but still got posters on your bedroom walls so...9/10.
---
I did see that and it‚Äôs great advice. Have you run in to the same issue I‚Äôve been having?  Curious if it‚Äôs a big bug. I‚Äôm on PS4
---
5 its pretty average nothing that really stands out just a normal house its better than alot but I've seen plenty of much better builds
---
&gt; Mobs will be acting normal then suddenly make their death noise and are dead. 
---
This happens sometimes with scorched. I'll be sneaking around the bottom floor of the ski shop in he eastern part of The Forest and hear one walking around and grumbling upstairs. Then suddenly "ugh" and falls dead. No idea why.
---
That's the proof I needed thanks
---
Do any helmet actually have a protective quality? Or just power armour?
---
Agreed, seems to happen anywhere that alot of bodies pile up. Though for OP's point, you still find meat on them, even on ones you didn't kill, you just can't butchers bounty them
---
I can confirm on this too. I always sell alot of junk to the vendors and sometimes if I go back to sell somthing again, I can see the previous things ive already sold.
---
Wow
---
Healing factor and marsupial pls
---
if i never have to hear or think about that awful, awful voice ever again, it‚Äôll be too soon
---
It‚Äôs a thankless job friend
---
Appreciate it! any advice from the builds you've seen?
---
Better yet get done killing a high level enemy and have the bosy dissapear as soon as you approach it.
---
It's the union outfit
---
I had something similar happen at the Grafton damn. A super mutant was laying on his side in his death pose, but had his gun out firing at me. He slid along the ground as he moved back and forth, still reclining on his side. It was so funny I almost hated to kill him.
---
Thanks! Kid at heart, yknow.
---
Hah thank you very much, appreciate it.
---
One of the bos outfits you get while doing the quest line has a backpack also, but not benefits
---
So am I, honestly If it weren't for other things to do I would constantly be changing things however once I feel like I can step away happy, I'm usually good. Otherwise I go crazy lol. Thanks!

Add me Xael501st.  I'm level 45ish always happy to team up. Heavy weapons power armour
---
Forgive me if I've misunderstood, but the blueprint of these rug glitches should work. I recreated this glitch last night and I've since been able to place and re-place my glitched Purifier from my blueprint.
---
This drives me nuts. I'm glad i'm not the only one who uses it daily and thinks hey when the fuck are they going to fix this? Bethesda please.
---
I mean itz pretty solid and their is tons of garbage out there so maybe its actually a 7, you should check out, Miz Traceys vids on youtube she's done like 16 great base videos
---
He did last a while with my Heavy Gunner. Non-stop Gatling Laser on that badass. Took me a while but he did got down. I can't remember correctly but it might have eaten 3 or 4 cores, and i play with a lvl 3 power user perk card.
---
That‚Äôs how you get windows! Why did that never occur to me?
---
Which building set are you Using?
---
Yeah it‚Äôs a pain. Really, your biggest problem might be being alone. Engaging in pvp, you really need at least a two man team.
---
Also, you mentioned high endurance. Are you aware each endurance point only gives you (a staggering) 5 hp? That‚Äôs flat, not per level. Yeah, if you‚Äôre already getting killed in a couple of hits, there‚Äôs not much difference hp wise at 200 between 3 and 15 endurance.
---
I‚Äôm always going crazy. Every time I log on I have about an hour of base edits then I actually start playing the game. üòÖ
---
Looking good.
---
just warp to like vault 76 and log out and when you log back in and warp to your base it will be back to it's normal spot
---
Ya its Miz Tracey
---
If you are not running a bloodied build, you are missing out on several additional perks and mods that‚Äôll increase your tankyness in PA and allow that to give you a fighting chance in PvP situations. 
---
It‚Äôs not always about the armor, but usually more so about the perks.
---
Yep. The going rate for a 3* something explosive handmade is $40. I can Google and find 5 plus sites that will deliver me what I want in under 30 min. These sites will get their items in game through trading vast amounts of caps or through other means (which is what I worry about).
---
I'm on PC, and I notice that sometimes it pops the selection to where my mouse cursor is even if I'm scrolling with the keyboard, and I also notice that the behavior is different when at the very top of the list vs the bottom, but I haven't had it bounce around semi-randomly on me.
---
Nope just a skin
---
Your damage resistance is not 110%. The DR is multiplicative, not addative.
---
Anything that provides armor penetration works directly against your ballistic rating. If the incoming damage is around 6.5 times your remaining ballistic DR after this calculation, you will reduce almost none of it. Please refer to this article, particularly the Fallout 4 section: https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Damage_Resistance
---
A player does not need to be Bloodied to melt through power armor. VATS alone can make a huge difference. If you want to survive, you need to counter the methods they depend on to kill you. See this other post for some advice on tactics: https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/bdcxs3/8_steps_to_surviving_workshops_in_adventure_mode/
---
Also, you can kill people just fine with a laser gatling and in power armor even if they are fully pvp geared. I encourage you to do that research on your own, or stick to adventure mode without workshops.
---
I think you get prime plans plans from Scorched Beast Queen drops or get it from another player.
---
The faster reload speed, does that one work for in-between shots for bolt rifles? Or just for a full reload? Would be good if anyone could confirm this.
---
I understand, blueprinted purifiers work in a glitchy way, only overhanging an edge, doing it fresh and it goes ANYWHERE. blueprinted rug crops doesn't work at all and become separated when placed!
---
So my weapon is explosive, I equipped dem expert for 20% more dmg and the dmg went from 69 to 71. What kind of math is that?
---
You probably know by now but there's also a burning mod for it, looks so demonic and badass
---
Want to say they threw their pa inside the edge then got into it, from outside i remember seeing a post a few days ago
---
In fallout: new vegas there was a robot that ‚Äúfisted‚Äù people.  Fisting is a sexual act involving your fist and someones ‚Äúholes‚Äù.  
---
And look at it this way, the perk cards in game are used for perks.  But in the fallout universe they were just collectible cards.  Just like how the bobbleheads were just collectible bobbleheads and didnt actually give people any benefits in the lore
---
Ok, similar issues then. Glad I‚Äôm not crazy
---
You hold it to the left of your target. Unconventional, but still moderately functional. Better than nothing.
---
I'll but you one if you want
---
I love Marsupial.
---
But they only float when they also have bird bones.
---
Is it the height or the hang time that bothers you.
---
It was in one of the pre beta release talks. I recall watching an interview about the game. They took human NPCs out because of PvP, players had to be able to tell if it was another player that was hostile or a hostile NPC quickly as you would have to respond differently.
---
Omg Clawdia
---
i have the card ready to go but wont be on till later tonight.  psn Xael501st may have timezone issues im in Australia
---
It'd be cool if they did a few limited time events that brought folks in too.
---
Did a silo run after finding a server full of 100+ players and dropped a nuke on SBQ and only 3 of us showed up. Failed the quest big time. Thought for sure we'd have no problem getting folks to do it with the double XP, but I guess the SBQ just isn't the draw anymore. I am still trying to get some plans from it, but no one really does it on PC anymore.
---
+karma
---
Nah it‚Äôs fun
---
I just scrapped 150 pipe revolver... nothing I'm sad that was 200 screws and 100 adhesive I'm out of screws and I only have 7 adhesive left
---
I got from 15 to 27, really feel like I progressed way too fast though.
---
I will keep on trying thoigh
---
Human NPCs we're in the game at one point. Listen to Rose as she talks with you. It feels like they reworked her into a robot half way though. Alot of her lines make it seem like she was a human NPC. Then got changed at the last moment to be a robot. Hell look at the Roslyn corpse in the Charleston police jail cell. It is a very well detailed body compared to all the other corpses we find.
---
Oblivion.  üòë
---
An improved version would be nice for something like the Burrows for sure. Place is a maze.
---
Nice find!
---
Murdered out. God that was an awful quest line.
---
What about with the hazmat suit? That won't help either while wearing pa right?
---
Nice shot!
---
Trapper chest had a backpack too
---
They removed the Dr from it. It's still on PC but now functions like a normal gas mask.
---
I enjoy using my auto grenade launcher.... against packs of weak trash. Actually using it seriously? I have a AA 50, TS 50, or TS minigun that'll actually do work.
---
And female! Hairstyles in general are needed
---
Great job!
---
My most wanted addition to that map would be plan/recipe locations, but obviously that's a big one.
---
You guys rock, keep up the great work.
---
There are other bodies in good condition as well like all the responders and vault dwellers foe example. Could definitely see them making Rose a robot halfway through development
---
moveto player
---
I took my alt from 20 to 50. Now she‚Äôs ready to become Legendary while my higher-level main stays as-is.   Bethesda saving me from the grind is highly appreciated.
---
U get more damage then heal if ur stupid enough to try that shit
---
hi this is messing up on my mobile device is it mobile friendly?
---
r/unexpectedthanos
---
Haha, yeah I get that most people like it. It's both the height and the hang time that bother me. It's seems so effective to be almost mandatory and I think that's part of the problem.
---
Buy it? I thought it was a mutation from radiation.
---
Just a skin, they plan on adding more themed around the other three horsemen but that's about it
---
I think it's all random luck. I feel like I went nearly a month without seeing a single nuke, on Prime or otherwise. But in the last week or two I've probably seen over a dozen, most of them SBQ.
---
You can buy serums from the Enclave bunker
---
Or make them
---
You can buy every mutation in the form of a consumable serum, they're fairly cheap online but extremely overpriced in the Enclave vendor pool. 
---
This cuts down on random mutations jumping into your build and it's 200,000% quicker
---
Did you try looking away and sprinting away? You have to sprint away IMMEDIATELY. But I seem to be able to cancel lying down by sprinting away. Just walking away doesn't work. But if I sprint away, I can cancel the animation entirely. Just try it a couple of times when you are safe, and see if you can get it to cancel to.
---
I would call it a solid 9.5 out of 10.  I'm not personally a fan of the mesh stair case and really wish they made a solid one.  Everything else about it is fantastic.  Keep up the good work.
---
P.S. don't forget level 2 starched genes in the luck perks.
---
now it just comes down to whether you like immersion more or floating around like crazy more. First time i saw a dude with marsupial i shit myself
---
I prefer semi auto for ammo consumption and damage per bullet. I couldnt imagine how much 556 id go through if i was auto.
---
Just read the last part, when *will* it be mobile friendly?
---
This glitch isn‚Äôt no joke lol, I flew for a solid min then the game froze !
---
Oh? Ok. 
---
I hadn't gotten one yet, guess there's no hurry now.
---
if you search recipe/plan on the map a few show up. but those are only for plans that have a 100% spawn rate/spawn placement. I havent looked into putting leveled lists(the random spawns) on the map, but ill add it to the list to look into :)
---
The map isnt mobile friendly, the rest of the site should be. If your seeing something funky for the main pages please screenshot and send it to me.
---
I don't see why the hate for pvp. I think it makes the game way more interesting personally. I quit 76 for a couple months until survival mode came out. Just have to figure out how to defend yourself better honestly, I like that aspect of the game. Would be too easy most of the time otherwise.
---
I've had the Mirv mod kill me all the time because it launches weird.
---
My teammate (who doesn‚Äôt follow social media) joined up for the first time in a while yesterday, and could stop raving about how great the atomshop repair kits were. He was totally stoked because:
---
A: he‚Äôs right at the level where armor takes a ton of ballistic fiber but he hasn‚Äôt got perks to make repairing manageable 
---
B: he hasn‚Äôt played enough to commit knowing where to find things like asbestos/screws quickly
---
C: is totally casual, doesn‚Äôt care about the atom shop and isn‚Äôt the type to make purchases. 
---
D: is usually running with much higher level players and is just hanging out. 
---
It surprised me, but it‚Äôs an interesting distinction from the p2w argument people often make. Anyway, the repair kits made his day, for sure.
---
Boost your luck and you'll be swimming in pie
---
Good event. Almost failed, but I'm glad we rallied back just in time.
---
yeah, persistent CAMPs and player vending are what i am waiting for.  got my bar and grill set up.  shop is ready.
---
some friends and i have our CAMPs as close together as we can.  i sell alcohol and foods, recipes, and food / drink crafting items.  the others are selling weapons, armor, ammo, etc.
---
the way we see it, if PvP ever gets off the ground, those players will be looking for this stuff........hopefully.
---
Yeah I'm all about immersion, I think this is why it bothers me so much.
---
Good tip but I love my high Strength and Agility
---
I was at your SBQ fight, Ripleyx01. I saw you go down right at the end and ran over to revive you but the beast‚Äôs big fat body got in the way. I hope someone revived you in time. I thought oh no the person who launched the nuke died and may not get any rewards, ahhhh!
---
Thanks alot! I also hate the mesh. The only flooring it works well with imo is the mesh flooring. Really does suck to be limited to that one staircase being it's the only with that design but oh well.
---
That‚Äôs awesome! I get stoked every time that red icon pops up and then I remember, oh yeah I got these sweet kits.
---
I hope they add it to other bosses like the mirelurk qween, behemoth, sheepsquatch.
---
Or even just make it a rare random drop all together.
---
As much as I loved doing it the first time, I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôd want to do it again lol
---
Hahah yeah I feel that.
---
No it does not work on ranged! Stop bullshitting! Only on melee if it has not changed
---
Hey! I use 3 with this build. Brick, Metal, and Barn.
---
The site Is satisfactorily 
---
Color isn't satisfying though and it's a bit cluttered on my screen wish it was more spaced out
---
Old post, but this just happened to me. Was doing the Main Quest with the DMV and I got halfway done and was booted. Forced to restart the quest. Very Frustrating and I don't know why it seems like this post was ignored.
---
Not the best response...
---
But it's definitely true that one of the best ways to get the answer you're looking for is by saying something that's you know is blatantly wrong, and having people correct you.
---
Oh sounds good! I havent heard of her but I'll check her channel out for inspiration, cheers!
---
Fuck no
---
wouldnt know,  havent played since this postvwas made
---
It happens for the vampire effect too. My Vampire plas-gat is pretty much unusable in difficult fights because of that and the other new bugs (after firing one shot it will stop firing or just deplete your whole core).
---
is it, though?
---
Can also do it with gear/food/perk cards that boost alcohol
---
Barring a better, non existent option, I prefer the sight to no sight.
---
I‚Äôm not hating on the site, just saying visually it makes me feel sick and I‚Äôm sure it might for others
---
I am lone wanderer for many reasons.
---
I have a dog, a wife, a kid, a phone from work I have to answer. life itself conspires to interrupt my game time. 
---
I tried being in some groups on discord and I do random parties at times but I always end up impatient and not enjoying myself. The party system is frustrating and annoying, this is a typical play through of when I did try to run with friends. I would spend time loading to their server, no the server is full, so they come to me, crap need food, cook corn soup almost ready to go, nope player C has a phone call, player D just realized he needs to repair his weapon, holy crap the dog needs to go outside. ok going to the silo to start clearing haul ass to let the dog out while I'm on the loading screen, ok I am in and clearing the robots making my ID. get past the laser grid, player A and B just get in, they don't know how to get past the laser grid so i turn around and go show them how, get everyone through the laser grid , dogs scratching at the door , kk afk one sec guys, boom haul ass let the dog in give him his Fn treat haul ass back to my chair, robots have respawned, burn 3 stim packs recovering, someone on discord not in the silo is asking a question I want to help but I cant walk and chew bubble gum at the same time so I try to answer but have trouble talking and thinking because we just got to the room with the sentry bot and player A got downed, stim pack him get him up player B is smashing cores i start smashing cores, player C disconects and leaves party, logs back in and wants a party invite, go to social invite him back in to party, my wife gets a phone call and I get to hear half of her conversation, the discord conversation, and my parties conversation all at once. I'm shooting things so i cant really do much about it but try not to yell at everyone to shut the Hell up. finally get to the launch room and start defending the launch crew but oh crap i have a phone call mute headphones and mic and keep shooting "hey this is Dave whats up? no .. yes .. maybe .. sure. ok then bye bye now," whoooo finally got the control room cleared alt tab to get the nuke launch codes and boom nuke is launched baby, fast travel to nuke zone go get in position start fighting the queen, crap randoms went out into the nuke zone and are fighting it there, do come here emote to get them to bring her out of the radiation feild but they're not responding,  fine so me and the two other people say F it and run into the rdiation feild to fight her there with everyone else, her health is dropping slowly but looks like we will get her, ah crap she just flew away and kept flying, .... ok so chasing her down.... ran all the way to the edge of the map only a couple of us actually chase her out of the zone though but we start shooting in case others show up a few do but not enough. nope not enough time.. not going to finish it. I still hear 4 conversations at once. 
---
   Currently I only very rarely join parties. if I get interupted i run into my base or workshop and get in bed to avoid hunger and thirst. I go when i want to stay when i want to , I never have to wait on people and i can leave voice on auto, i only server hopw when i need to and its just so much less stressfull. I get pissed when i get my butt kicked but i would take that over trying to deal with al the other stuff that goes on with running in a group.
---
Thank you
---
Are there pictures of the garage?
---
The local maps in 4 were there worst out about the game
---
The Pleasant Valley Cabins. There are several building near the cliff edge on the north? side. It's kinda in the middle of those buildings, and a bit smaller. There's one building that you have to enter from behind it via a set of stairs, or by jumping onto the balcony area via marsupial or jetpack. There's a room behind a door with ~39 beer bottles.
---
you just need to learn how to jump good.

I just don't understand why posts that elicit aggressive responses warrant disallowing them from the sub. This sub is over-zealous about many topics, but it's not like those are disallowed. I agree trade posts are better suited for trading subs, but I think this is a bad precedent in rationale.
---
Ha, thanks
---
I do, but it's always after I've gotten it at max
---
I'm doubtful of it being her, given the silhouette lacks the Vault suit markings of the obvious Vault boy silhouette, as well as the fact you're seemingly gleefully robbing a vault.
---
But now we have separate modes one for PvP preferred players so maybe they can work something out. I miss NPC‚Äôs man, as much as I love this game if I‚Äôm not grinding events or something like that then I feel so lonely on the game. Just feels more dead than the wastelands I‚Äôm used to.
---
That's what I figured.  I think it would work well for a two story garage or barn but it just doesn't work with normal floor.  We all have to make some sacrifices in our designs. I use the brick tile set and it annoys me that I can't make interior rooms without one of them having a brick wall.

That would also be great

Who cares?? Smoking cigarettes is fucking disgusting.

nice camp. Mine is literally 3 floors and 8 walls with 3 windows and a door and a roof over it with a sleeping bag, a light and a stash box.
---
Hm, I actually didn‚Äôt pick up on that but I did think Rose sounded more human than Robot she kinda reminds me of Moira‚Äôs drugged up raider sister lol. I just don‚Äôt get why we couldn‚Äôt have select ones to start out. Rose is up in that tower by herself &amp; the vendors could easily have some humans. Or even a human wandering vendor like Grahm.

I think it's how workshop PvP behaves. It is not contained to the workshop, it gets activated by the one trying to steal it. Meaning the current owner doesn't know when PvP will start. When the workshop got changed to being able to capture it anywhere in the workshop area it got worse as you never could tell where it would be coming from. Also the fact that most people who use the workshop to initiate PvP will find you on the map start the claim and fast travel or have their friends fast travel to you and kill you. It's unbalanced and unfair to the owner. The pop up blip that says your workshop is being claimed by another player shows up so fast and goes away so fast you don't notice that PvP has started. Another killer as they don't have to fully claim the shop just attempt and let it fail, after killing the owner attempt to claim and let it fail again to kill the owner again. A lock out timer on a failed attempt would prevent this style of abuse.
---
I know that a set in point pleasant in a basement, but I'm not sure if there's any plans for it.
---
Do people really need a sub to trade for in-game items?
---
I mean, the whole point of the endgame is to strong legendaries items.
---
Yeah, what's up with the blackberries? That's the only thing I'm allowed to plant for some odd reason. Keeps telling me I have no dirt, but the blackberries don't seem to have a problem being planted in the same area... now I have a shit ton of them.
---
I think this is moot. They already said there was going to be some sort of prestige system on the horizon.
---
You just have to find a broken one and craft a new one from it at a workbench.
---
Yeah, but not Atom shop
---
Need some new earnables in game, lol
---
Start at huntersville, kill all baddies except a hound if it spawns then head to the behemoth slightly southwest of twin lakes
---
Right? I was thinking the same thing when I was playing yesterday. Where are the garden plots? I figured I just didn't have access or was missing that stuff...guess not.
---
I already explained this in the original post.
---
Basement of the Mothman museum in Point Pleasant.
---
Most of the perk cards you get seem to be quality of life ones. If you hold off on quality of life perks, you can save yourself some levels. Your build might feel complete at 55 instead of 65, and so on.
---
Ah yes sorry forgot about them.
---
Whew, I hear that. I‚Äôm lucky to have one decent teammate sometimes, but nothing beats solo to play at your own relaxed pace.
---
It was cool. I didn't get to play much this weekend. Just played for 1.5 hours and went from level 48 to 50 in anout an hour, and I was not even trying to power level, just screwing around in the forest and looking for ritual bindings in Point Pleasant.
---
thank you for your work!
---
First time really designing a site, will definitely look into that to see what I can do :)
---
The Union Soldier outfit has a backpack.
---
I 100% percent agree. If we could have selectable factions with LIVE NPC‚Äôs it would truly bring the world together (or against each other depending on how you look at it). Getting certain faction-specific daily &amp; weekly quests &amp; maybe mini-main stories for each one but as you said you can only pick one! All should have faction skins you can earn by doing faction events or faction specific guns &amp; armor. Faction specific vendors that give good loot for each faction :-) maybe I‚Äôm getting a little full of myself I don‚Äôt wanna set too high of standards although I think Bethesda has done tremendous work with the game since the launch. Easily my favorite game of 2018 &amp; 2019 so far. Can‚Äôt really grind any games like this one I always end up coming back
---
I just started a new character and I hate not having it
---
As if the imposter goat quest isn‚Äôt already frustrating, theres a pond in the middle with interactive stuff around.
---
yer mum
---
You‚Äôre very right. Just had a buddy with some rug glitched crops come online. Blueprinted them, placed them, and they separated :(
---
Legendary characters are on the horizon sir, I think it‚Äôll solve some of those but I totally agree. If they allowed people to pay to respec they need to also make it a little more accessible for us free to play. We tend to forget (myself included) that not everyone has the same amount of time to play typically.
---
Dont stress Bugtesda now my friends. Game has only been out 6 months üòÅ
---
Whatever you want to think...I made it a point to see if it works and it does...had a 5 to 10 % increase so a bump up is a bump up as I see it.
---
being blunt (because people probably won't advertise this because they're shitheads)
---
I wouldn't regularly go into this site if it wasn't heavily advertised plus people are mobile as well including me.
---
I like the site though map will come in handy so please message whenever you get it up and running for mobile friendly people.
---
Good one for a first attempt tho! ‚ô•Ô∏è
---
Strange ...im lvl 294 with 950h ingame...never happened to me when repairing, you must have got lucky
---
-50/10
---
Because carry weight glitch. :)
---
Looks absolutely amazing!
---
Oh wow!
---
That's incredible!
---
I have bad news... she died fighting thanos
---
Try instigating the dragon. I know that there are no dragons in west virgina but a scorchbeast should suffice.
---
Legendary characters is what you‚Äôre referring to. Not any concrete info yet but sounds like it‚Äôll help a lot with some things. Interested to see what kind of things they have in store starting with Nuclear Winter. It‚Äôll be a very interesting 2019!
---
yup nap20000 made me rethink anti armor affects and i realized what i was missing. thank you for the effort. also the 8 steps guide is something I was doing (in fact he added one of my comments to the guide about over spending personal resources on the base.) and yes i can kill people with the laser gat and i have but only on the rare occasions i actually got the drop on them usually they hit first and i die before i can even get the laser shooting. one guy straight up sniped me and i never even got to see him. I think if you put that many points into endurance it sould count for more than it does. one shot pvp fights suck.
---
They came to visit me too! It‚Äôs a lot less lonely with them around. They even called some friends and now my camp hosts a sheepsquach platoon. They‚Äôre currently standing at parade rest.
---
thanks for the advise and yeah i know that its the internet after all i can handle their criticism its people like you im here for not those guys
---
Great work! Everything you've done so far is amazing. I'll be using it a lot in the future.
---
Did you boost your intelligence before repairing? I noticed the bump the higher the higher the intelligence
---
I have 5 unyielding, about 20 int. Not tried lifting it over that though
---
yeah as i said it shouldnt be hard to implement
---
I know the actual item spawns unless this is also where the plans spawn
---
I dunno...maybe it's  a glitch, maybe I'm lucky, either way...I hope it doesn't go away..lol
---
I don't think there are plans for it.
---
yeah i know that however with a gunslinger we cant really get adrenaline maxed out unfortunately
---
You stop being able to pick them up at 255. So, I have five toons full at 255 each.
---
BROTHER!!!!!!!!!
---
Lol; same here. A bunch of us tried reviving him, it got crowded
---
I agree. They've been surprisingly absentee in the past but to their credit, things have picked up a little more in the past month or so.
---
Give it time and see how the new mod team works out.
---
Mothman eggomlett for +2
---
I'm going look into it- the problem is I don't want to be a glass cannon in pve. I only take the shops for fusion cores. out of an all day session i might get attacked once, if i have to make the whole rest of my game suck to accommodate that one thing its not worth it. that's the crux of my beef with pvp. thats what i am complaining about. it forces you to take specific skills and play a certain way. i will look into bloodied build but i have seen so many of those guys get waxed by some of the simplest things in pve. they may have been bad at running bloodied build i dont know but i do not want to spend every ten minutes respawning.
---
I‚Äôm on my third character (I restart games all the time) and this time I‚Äôve gotten hacker, lock pick and expert lock pick and two hard bargainer cards in the random shuffles. Not ones I usually pick but great to swap in when I need to. So lucky me :) üçÄ
---
If you have a ton of stims you can get a medic pump.. But I agree, power armor could use a buff.. bad enough it's so slow, it should be more tanky
---
When I started playing this game O did dimilar thing. So I find this stash and take everything in it think how lucky I an. Took me 10 minutes to walk to my camp heavy uncumbered. Finally when I got to my stash and rellised its empty it get to me, I burst in a laugh muttering to myself ‚Äúyou stupid dumbass‚Äù.
---
For the sake of accuracy, 32 is the hard cap for server pop. Technically the cap is 24, but some extra players can get on by grouping in the main menu. 
---
On a less pedantic note, I figure the reason people fail to turn up for the  queen fight much these days is a combiniaton of the lack of a decent garunteed 3\*/any drops actually worth having for beating SBQ, Vs the ammo expenditure, especially now that serum recipes appear to have been removed from her loot tables.
---
I've posted something similar after I dropped mine thinking I had a 'bug' when the camera wouldn't leave my inventory. 
---
The bad news is this (as far as I know) after a few days server hoping/searching for the 'broken' version of the Deluxe ProSnap camera it simply doesn't exist after picking it up to start the Bucket List quest. I've found both dead npcs numerous times and none had the broken camera (had the holotape). It cannot be found in the 'world' as far as I know. I've found broken cameras and broken ProSnap cameras but not the DELUXE version. I've had people say they found another 'Deluxe' version but all have turned out to be the regular ProSnap cameras.
---
There is a plan to make another camera along with the film in the Tinkers workshop but you need the deluxe broken version to do so :( and as far as I am aware as mentioned it just ain't spawning in the game 'world'.
---
I guess that highlights the issue. It's so useful everyone wants it.
---
&gt;So, I googled the number on the ear tag of the Sheepsquatch and found a stock image of a sheep!  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;[https://i.imgur.com/JyEooeB.png](https://i.imgur.com/JyEooeB.png)
---
So that's what the Sheepsquatch looked like pre-war. Nice find!
---
You need the broken version to make another camera sadly :(
---
Instigating Executioner would be interesting.
---
Thank you sir!
---
Lol that's wild. Never seen it with a living enemy.
---
My ghoul encounter reminded me of the Creeper from the Scooby doo cartoon. It just moved in slow motion. Always 20 feet behind me. Watching, waiting, creeping.
---
As far as I've seen over the past few days the vendors do not sell the fixed version of the camera. Now I ain't seen Graham or the vendor bot that can spawn near Charleston Station so I'm holding out hope they sell it :)
---
Dang didn't think about that. That's solid. Start off strong and finish strong. Nice!
---
Thank you chadodious - when this started happening i started looking at damage reduction cards in order to survive the first hit. but in power armor theres no surviing the first hit that i have seen even with chugging super stim packs and phsycho tats
---
You made me wonder if wxcavator require full set to have that carry weight capacity. Something that ill look into today.
---
Demo is not worth it anymore. It gives to small boost to be worth 5 points!
---
Strange in Numbers causes an actual pause in the air.
---
I ran born survivor and it wouldnt proc if I was firing the laser gat at the 40% mark. I suspect that stimpacks will not be used as long as the weapon is firing. I also cannot seem to add mods to my power armor currently. adding mods seems to be bugged for me. I have all the perks for it and fully modded my X-01 with jump jet and kinetic legs etc but I went to mod a friends and it was a nogo.
---
do you know if it would fire in the middle of firing a gatling gun for instance?
---
edited for content
---
Bloodied instigating less vats explosive lever, mix that with Gun Fu perk &amp; you'd annihilate most hordes.
---
I just jumped in game and that's a broken ProSnap camera not the Deluxe broken version. I'm wondering if they (the deluxe version) are not set to spawn 'in-world'?
---
Use the per weapon artisan. Will repair ALL weapons to 200% (except gronaks axe) I do it all the time. If your on PC I'm more than happy to repair your weapons to 200 for you to prove the point. I have 15 in int and wear PA (no unyealding sentinals etc armor) he'll I'll even so it in my skivies. Just tired of this rumor about repairing weapons. And if u could get fraps to work again I'd post a dam utube vid to prove it.
---
I got 4 I wanted out of my last pack, thought I was seeing things!   Usually get 2 junk, 1 duplicate, and one ‚Äúhmmm interesting‚Äù.
---
Lol I had someone drop a nuke right on top of me as I was loading out of Van Lowe Taxidermy. I got the Ground Zero trophy for it too
---
Adventure really needs rule set changes to make pve more rewarding and keep pvp in survival. Theres many perk builds and playstyles that should be more rewarding to use, and bloodied shouldnt be the alpha omega that it is.
---
i only know about Freds BBQ shack
---
Much better than the physics-defying stuff I usually see, 10/10
---
Here's another trick: tap fire without zooming.
---
There's a certain rhythm to it, but if you get used to it it you can double rate of fire compared to just holding the trigger.
---
I image its a bit like precasting spells in WoW.
---
The server has a certain amount of slack to allow for bad latency.
---
I meant two shot as in die in two shots.
---
Several, actually... But mostly trash I'll never use or duplicates of cards that are single stack and get eaten.
---
Ofc i been using that. Never bothered checking if it affects ranged weapons . Got to test it. I always repair armor&amp; weapons to 200 when possible
---
This game easily has the best volumetric lighting ever
---
Groves Family Cabin in the NW, Big Fred's BBQ Shack and Southern Belle Motel

---
It's too much trouble to go through to repair the station and then chase the drop. At least have a way to consolidate them into better dropped loot or the chance at better equipment. That, or just remove them from the game.
---
The connection to 3 here wouldn't be Harold it would be the Dunwich obelisk, the Krivbeknih and Ug-Qualtoth.  Parts of me are hoping they expand on all of this at some point with an event and simultaneously hoping they never touch it again and leave it mysterious.
---
I will be totally interested tomorrow
---
I give this a -4/B
---
yup - i like building up the workshops, I dont like getting ganked, i take the power plants for fusion cores but i aso really just enjoy building them up. its a waste of resources to do so and i only really make them big when i need to burn mats. all mixing pvp and pve on any game does is create a gank meta which every d bag on the planet will use and the pve players get griefed.
---
Can't get on but where was he for future reference.
---
Killed her twice today.. üòéüëç
---
I wish we were limited to one mutation. It would've allowed for more diversity. Now instead everybody gets at least marsupial/bird bones/speed demon and it's boring.
---
I will Totally be on tomorrow. Tbh I'm drunk and feeling generous. But I am a man of my word. If you hit me up tomorrow until 5pm.cst I will totes do it for you.
---
I feel like one of the few who apparently haven‚Äôt done this
---
so this is something I see a lot of people not understand when they first try to get how PvP builds work. There are two types of Damage and Damage Resist stats. Hard numbers and percentages. a hard number is something like the Damage read out of a weapon, or your defense/armor read out of your power armor. Then there are percentages, these come from legendary effects and perks. like -8% dmg for assasins armor. so basically you could have over 1000 armor, but if my legendary effects and perks bypass 95% percent of it, its basically not there. percentage modifiers are what make PvP builds work so well, and currently there are a handful of really good ones out there, like bloodied builds, VATs crit snipers, sent/assasin unarmed, shotgun stagger, etc. and the sad thing is that power armor just doesnt cut it (i feel u bc i also love power armor in FA). but, there is a silver lining, after recent stealth changes u can't one hit kill anyone anymore in adventure mode. time to kill can still be exceptionally fast, but you can catch people slipping. alternatively, if u just dont want to PvP they made baby mode...er I mean passive mode.
---
I got and I was like ‚Äúoh hell yes‚Äù then I tried using it and I was like ‚Äúthe fuck is this thing?‚Äù It‚Äôs actually the most useless thing in the game. All it does is add weight
---
i got rid of it but i think it still talks if you keep it
---
My suggestion is to avoid players that are clearly there for PvP. They most likely have duped sets of armor and use cheese mechanics.
---
it does
---
I made it from 130 to 158.. 28 levels. 2 queen kills and a WS too.. üòéüëç
---
So people who were victims of duper gear don't suffer by losing their gear+caps. I have a TSE gun probably from a duper, but after the nerf I never touched it again.
---
This is it exactly.
---
Plus, like the top comment said, anyone posting trades here is trying to take advantage in one or another.
---
Us heavy weapon users request aim dot for 1st person...I mean or place a dot on the center of your tv
---
Hey, no worries! I‚Äôm free to play from the 22nd of May onwards so add me up
---
Yeah
---
I try but sometimes they just won't leave you alone. It's just odd there health won't drop below zero. It has bounces.
---
Not that i know off, i have hundreds of em i‚Äôd love to share
---
Oh, then i agre :D
---
The only part I want it for is to show exact door locations.
---
I found mine on the shelf of a locker in a mine months ago.  Forgot which one sorry.
---
I did 206-215lvl. If i had fucking ammo (80% of time spend trying to get lead for 5.56 eating handmade) and some people to farm SBQ, i could be 230 maybe even more now. 
---
It was so awesome to have 1000+ xp per scorchbeast.
---
i think it should always be an option, it‚Äôs a frustrating problem especially for those of us who go with bloodied/unyielding builds and always have to deal with that, the bonus stats dont apply when you‚Äôre dead so a lot of times it doesnt even let respawn anywhere else than on a friend
---
Do you know if you can only trigger it once per server?
---
I feel like the cards in packs aren't random. It's like the game is trying to push you towards some type of build or another.
---
I just want to say, OP, that I feel your pain. I just got verbally abused by this "TacocatRacecar" guy and it was super annoying. I highly suggest everyone who has been harassed by this a-hole report him to Bethesda and follow-up so it gets submitted with them. Bethesda needs to be aware of his behavior.
---
If it's an upper floor try building a single flight of stairs down, connect that to a foundation on the bottom, then try to delete in top down fashion.
---
i have never seen one . i've tamed a wolf , dog , and mongrel but never have seen a mutant hound , but I wont say no but i do have 1200 hours in the game
---
Bloodied 40% swing speed powerfist the third star would be anyones guess lol
---
I think helmets don't give DR for fashion purposes, but I guess they could just add a toggle button to hide them
---
might be worth noting that if I made an estimate as to when I got it, it was at about 500ish hours. Maybe you‚Äôll have better luck but you‚Äôve got lots of guns to scrap.
---
you can activate it multiple times, like you can activate it in one place, wait for a bit and go to the next location and activate it there, and repeat that. there‚Äôs probably a cooldown on the event but it‚Äôs not that long so you can easily get a few events within an hour, at least i could
---
Hope its something the devs look at. my guess is the potential for abuse is why we cant in the first place.
---
Yup! Also agree with that, really does bug me.
---
There are weirdly a lot of guns where the long barrel weighs less than the short one for what's we reason
---
I will update with pictures soon!
---
Nothing wrong with that, thanks!
---
That's an insane amount of weight off your back
---
Carry weight glitch? Are you saying I'm using that? If so, I don't haha. Thanks!
---
Lol thanks
---
Thanks for your rating lol
---
I feel like noone here commenting actually took in what you are saying. Pvp isn't fun. It's all just 1 shot meta where the aggressor always has the upper hand.
---
Pvp would be fun if encounters lasted more than a second.
---
I think heart of the swamp is a free state event. Also there is an event that happens at random relay towers where you repair and guard an eyebot that is free States.
---
Yikes man, well I can sympathise with you, when I died I lost like 300 springs n 300 screws along with soooooooo much lead, so I guess whichever lucky bastard who went inside AMS got a bit of a treat, if they didn't die before enemies loaded in and didn't face the fatal can't spawn back on map.
---
Seems to be that this glitch happens a lot inside interior cells weirdly.
---
They're designing the game around the pace of the casual player it seems. Putting it as far out as nuclear winter seems appropriate. I would imagine that's when the more casual player base is going to have many of the over-leveling issues. The rest of us are already experiencing it
---
I believe when the health fluctuates like that you're dealing with a latency issue
---
Thank you for your hard work.
---
I made a post about .50cal heavy weapon and i had no idea there were trading subs. It was the first time i even made a post about a trade.
---
Just wait until they balance things out for pvp so all get a fair chance since Most of the dupes are there with assasins + sentinel armors fully modded and AAE full auto wepons. For a "new" player there is no chance of having a fair fight, shure you can vats crit em in the head if you are a rifleman and you take em out with ez, but for the melee builds and others, well thats a other story. 
---
So i feel your pain even tho i quite enjoy survival, but the fact is there is a balance problem and it needs go be adressed from Beth.
---
What you're seeing on the HP bar is just a guess, probably based on bad information. I suspect the client doesn't know about player damage reduction (eg. sentinel/assassin/dodgy), and it would certainly find out late about stimpak use.
---
There‚Äôs a location where you could simply pick up perfectly preserved pies

I cannot build stairs downstairs downwards because they will be out of bounds. And even if I could build them, I wouldn't be able to connect anything to them because they would be totally inside the rock.

Hi,
---
not while you are in PA but it can help when you get out of PA while in an heavy rad environment.
---
For example falling in a deep pond of water while in power armor with no way out by walking (happened more than once to me :) )
---
really just depends on what your build is, if you‚Äôre going for bloodied/unyielding it might be easier to have one or two bolstering pieces or one chameleon piece (if you‚Äôre going for stealth), i have a chameleon, the rest is unyielding. or if you‚Äôre going for a tanky vanguard‚Äôs build it might be better to have all vanguard‚Äôs
---
Damn, sorry, thought that would do it.
---
I don't think so, I have around 3 luck if my Unyielding doesn't kick in, and the game has been chucking me assassins/unyielding sentinels and cavaliers and a couple explosive 50. Cals.
---
I just think it's pure RNG. Luck actually just increases the health of the item you find I believe.
---
I leveled a couple newbie characters to 30 in no time just server hopping  the dirt track.  Didn't even have 2x xp.
---
I leave one full wall open just so I can have that effect.
---
Weapon made by the gods
---
This is one of those situations that you are not sure if it is genius or insanity. Good work.
---
No worries amigo. I just hope I'm wrong and I can find one with the help of the RNG gods but I got a gut feeling it's a bug and that's why the broken Deluxe version ain't spawning in the world. Why else would they give the plans to make another camera and not put the main 'piece' needed into the world - oh well just have to hope it'll get sorted one way or another :)
---
I thought the same until I used it, I cant  play without it now.
---
Good Lead locations:  
---
Penitentiary - Loads of cans inside and out and recently the weights were changed to be pick up able  
---
Charleston Firestation - Weight room  
---
Green Country Lodge (North of Flatwoods) -  Weight room in corner  
---
Camden Park - can traps around the rollercoaster, often can leave with 100+ lead if it hasn't been looted  
---
Objects to look for: Weights, Rat Poison(5x), Combination wrenches, Tin Cans (especially the traps 15 lead each)   
---
Hope this helps :)
---
Yup, I get this happen quite often.
---
Seems to happen if I try to move too soon.

Similar for me. My eyes constantly defocus, makes me feel a bit dizzy and nauseous. I think it's a problem with the low contrast between text and background and that it's all the same color, just lighter or darker. Makes my vision go completely haywire.

I was thinking about this earlier today. I love marsupial, but t is crazy powerful. Skipping a floor of enemies or a lock/terminal by sneak jumping in through a second floor window feels somewhat broken.

OK!! this chat has been productive. What I want is power armor and Fusion cores for my gatling laser.

IF they do manage to kill me in survival mode they only get a quarter of my cap payout and 0 stimpacks (i never carry junk). since i am not relying on first aid i replaced that with stabilized and i already own an anti armor laser gatling. i dont know what percentage armor ignore AA weapons are but with stabilized im looking at at 45% plus the AA part of my laser gat. for pve and more sustained fighting i need to get a vampires gatling laser but even if i cant get one of those i should be able to chug super stims in really tough fights. those are my thoughts. think it will work? i dont care about going after peeps i just want to farm cores.

Sounds good but doesnt seem very realistic for a post apocalyptic game.

Did a SBQ run yesterday, quite a few turned up and I got the distinct impression they all turned up just to kill the mobs and not the queen.  Wonder if killing endless mobs was a quicker way to lvl up than hitting the queen?

Thanks for this, i was in all those places, but i will go thru 2k ammo per none silo+SBQ :(

i find someone on reddit who told, in lucky hole mine is 1k lead, but i didn't find so much lead deposits there, not even 100. I will switch back to melee soon.

Is this the randomly placed legendary sheepsquatch? I have encountered 2...one level 50 and one level 80. Didn't have a problem with either. Used my all rise (I think that's it, the super-sledge you get that weighs 6lbs) and was fine...only wore power armor. I didn't think it was that difficult honestly, but it was nice to see something new.
---
Now if people would learn to read the damn instructions on the screen during the Cryptid event that would be wonderful. So tired of watching all these people whack away at the monster for nothing since the pylons are not active.
---
If you have a good build it is gonna be very good (especially in vats because limb damage). I'm using a level 35 bloodied handmade rifle and can still kill a Scorch beast in 6 shots with my build
---
I havent played in quite a while but if I remember correctly its an old fashioned gas prices sign. I dont know if its worth anything but it looked great next to the garage in my camp.
---
But at the same time, Bethesda did say Fallout 76 has more voiced dialog than Fallout 4. But I don't feel like we've seen anywhere near that in game so far, which makes me think they're sitting on massive amounts of dialogue and NPC banter that we simply haven't seen yet.
---
So who knows. Perhaps the Overseer has tons more to come.

Went from 10 or 11 to 38. Got a mix of t45 and raider power armor then was able to make my excavator at 25 then killed a sheepsquatch at just south of the train station in ash heap. I got 2 legendaries from him, quills and a sheepsquatch skull.
---
Was a very fun and great experience.
---
The vendors finally restocked, none of the selling things worked when I tried before, I tried armor, bobby pins, weapons, misc (like burnt books), and junk. Since they restocked I hope it doesn‚Äôt happen again.
---
lol when I was very new i came upon a camp with a dumpster stash, and I thought the same as your buddy.  I emptied it all and crawled home only to find my stash box empty. I just stood there facepalmed for a good half hour.
---
Its not really Camp Griefer's that hit camps at whitesprings.  Well some of the them might be; they take things a little too far.   Anyone that builds a camp near the golf clubhouse will most likely be torn down.    People build camps that shoot rockets into the doors/windows of the gold club so they can loot legendaries easier.    But that really disrupts and steals from other players.   
---
Your turrets will shoot anyone attacking your camp, sure.  But anyone that builds in whitesprings are usually targets by normal players and griefers alike.
---
Add effect like this https://codepen.io/lbebber/pen/XJRdrV throw in some nice font, allow to choose color (amber mandatory) and this will be a blast ;).

I tried every possibility mentioned in any comment, none of them worked, today they finally restocked and I didn‚Äôt have the error, hopefully this wont happen again.

"You can also earn badges that show your mastery over traditional activities, like swimming, **archery**, cooking, athletics, and more. In addition to measuring individual growth, badges will come in handy at Pioneer Scout vending machines. Trade your badges in for themed loot that you can use to enhance your C.A.M.P. and show off your Pioneering spirit. "
---
From Wiki:

" **Archery** is the art, sport, practice, or skill of using a [bow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bow_(weapon)) to [shoot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shooting) [arrows](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arrow). "

---
for some reason the mutations i selected arent showing when i check the link- they are herbivore, unstable isotope, healing factor,speed demon, and electrically charged. the goal is not to be great at pvp I want to continue to have high health and do well at pve but be good for farming fusion cores in adventure mode. i think this will work.
---
99% of legit users don't want that 1% of cheaters/scammers going back. Bethesda does very well keeping them out of the game.
---
True, you do not have the to worry about it from other players.  But IMO, you should not need to worry about it.  Problem with Repair All is that if they destroy Decon Arch then the Repair All option may not be feasible anymore.  Your better off just moving the camp by paying caps than paying up all the stable flux to repair the thing.    However, I know if I move my CAMP, I am probably not going to be able to place it back down again.   Do I want to waste 1-2 hours of my time just to rebuild it at another location plus fork over 150+ caps?
---
Had a great time, too. Went from 98 to 114. Fought and downed the Queen for the first time with a bunch of other players. Also, nothing but positive interactions which is a big plus. Love to see it again.
---
I have not seen any notes from Bethesda about that specific thing.  Only thing I read was they were thinking about solutions for the WS thing.   I am hoping they do that though.  WS is definitely the most scenic place in the game and many people like the nice flat area as well.   But the abuse of the turret camps behind the golf clubhouse is rampant.   So I do hope your right about this.

Have you tried the half height industrial wall that's all window?

With my unyielding bloody build my mole Miner gauntlet without any extra Buff's does 1200 a hit. What I'm getting at is just play the style you're happy with trying to make your character more PVP oriented while you want to do PVE still isn't going to work for you
---
exactly so why would he go mess with a level 12 dude? the mentality of the 1% dbags in the world never ceases to amaze me. 99 % of EVERYONE in fallout 76 are cool chill peeps who help each other out or at a minimum stay out of each others way. then theres that one percent that arent bright enough to even understand why they're in the wrong. then they spout out lame justifications like "its just a game." Ive come to discover if you have to explain to someone why something is wrong they're never going to understand anyway.
---
Yos
---
bugs fixed and is that yes to the repair kits thing?
---
The repair kits were never only sold in the atom store. The actually useful ones can only be obtained in game ffs üôÑ
---
Low levels carry junk too. I once killed a level 6 at a workshop. Turned out it was a mule and I cleaned up. Don't know until you try.  Now after I take someone's junk, I usually leave them and their workshop alone ;)
---
dude why so salty? I said i havent been around okay? Sheesh
---
I hear that all the time if you just ask me I'll give you the workshop I'm not going to the workshop to claim the workshop I'm going to kill you and see if you've got any goodies in your junk I'll even lose caps traveling to you and then claiming the workshop
---
Unless he sells/drops the "junk items" first so he can fast Travel.
---
Bugs mostly fixed,lots of cool free dlcs and people with repair kits are not so annoying that it ruins the game for you,but still bethesda promised no ptw and they did just that.
---
Not really, however, I just wish the waypoints in buildings would wake up sooner. I feel like I need to get strangely close before I will see a physical waypoint in the dungeon/building to help guide me to what floor or direction I'm going. Many quests will send you to a place only for you to wander a bit until the objective pops up. 
---
Oh man, Sugar Grove for Mistress of Mysteries. Being Level 25, that was fun to aimlessly trot about in as level 40 Robobrains zapped me with no visible marker until I got within 80 yards? Feet? Miles? Hotdog lengths? But it finally happened and I did the thing! Yeeeeeah.
---
Honestly the repair kits thing was way over blown, I just cant imagine them selling alot or anyone buying them at all. Considering it would take you 10-20mins of resource farming or a fast travel to repair just about any weapon if you really didnt have the parts or access to a workbench. Like you gotta be one impatient person to even think about using it.
---
No way did I find you on Reddit
---
Agreed - its as annoying as it is usefull paired with birdbones as well. need to hop that small fence and loot that legendary just on the other side? not today paco let stick you up above it for 3 minutes. Had it Hated it Got rid of it. and yes it looks stupid as hell.
---
They‚Äôll never respond to you once you are permabanned from BGS/ZOS.  
---
They block messages from that account or at least you‚Äôll just get an autoreply saying the same thing over and over.
---
Sorry and you probably don‚Äôt want to hear it but you‚Äôre most likely done in terms of FO76, go play another game.
---
Heh, once a guy tried to get a drop on me in one of my workshops but ultimately failed, the moment he died I grabbed his loot, went in sneak and fast traveled to another workshop. If they‚Äôre trying to be scum they better watch out for players competent enough to fight back ( usually they just go guns blazing so they die fast if you see them ). 
---
In the end I just hope they can fix this issue with the unfair pvp and camp damage. You have my sympathies mate
---
Your best shot is to post 10 mins before you start the event on Reddit. Then people will join. You won‚Äôt do it by yourself
---
Let's say you're a shotgun build and you drop a TSE gatling plasma. It's definitely worth money but what would you do with it? Sell it for 500caps to the bots ?
---
What's the dirt track?
---
Nice place
---
Forgot to mention I was level 42
---
Make a new account, buy the game again, play, and this time don't cheat.
---
If you wanna farm using workshops your best bet is dont linger in the workshop.. If you linger and you're not in sneak mode you're an easy target.. Also take advantage of turrets and walls.. they will chew up any hostile players and possibly soften them up for you.  I usually make a tower with missile turrets with a little workshop inside behind brick walls to give me a few seconds to duck and cover and prepare
---
I agree it looks dumb af but it‚Äôs also gonna be so hard to adjust if they remove it
---
I feel personally attacked.
---
Lucky Hole mine is really good for lead ore.
---
I was like that at first.
---
ok first youll have to smash through the wall then the barricade you wont be able to jump because the floor will be above you and i will have barricades, and i will be spinning up laser gat OR just leaving the map. also rocket turrents inside.  and i cant play the style im happy with because i need fusion cores and i like to farm the power plants but i cant because gankers just show up and one shot me for 200 caps per hit. if im gona get ganked then its going to cost me less on survival mode at least.

Unyeilding armour at low health is the best way to get the best prices. Shoots your charisma up to +15. Even just 1* junk armour will work.

Bobbleheads are not part of the lore, just the game just as it is with perkcards. Have you ever heard a robot or any npc who mentioned perk-cards or bobbleheads, how about a note or a computer entry?

As far as in concerned I haven't and i haven't heard of anyone who have.

I got 5 new characters to 50 this weekend. Just save up Stimpacks and Purified Water then spam craft Diluted Stimpacks with all XP buffs running. ez
---
Some I just levelled to 26 which is the level I feel characters become "playable", they have Travel Agent, Lone Wanderer, Hard Bargain, Inspirational, Pack Rat, Travelling Pharmacy, Thru Hiker, Good With Salt, Commando and Expert Commando. Give them a level 25 Legendary Handmade and set up camp next to Grafton Steel. Run straight to the workshop and cap. Clear the whole location while waiting for the defend event, defend then relog. Even if you relog onto the same server you get to cap the workshop again for full XP. So much more efficient than staying on the server. At 35 I give them a level 35 leggy Handmade and go to The Mire. Cap Berkley Springs, do the location quests around there and the new Sheepsquatch side quests and events (I kept my second account logged in for Inspirational bonus but you can just random invite anyone on the map). At 45 I was clearing Harper's Ferry and the nearby Red Rocket for about 450XP per Super Mutant.
---
Now I have a whole account of characters in Excavator PA with Calibrated Shocks, they all have all the weight reduction perks and I can start seriously storing Legendarys for the vendor. Productive weekend (for someone who hates leaving the house lol).
---
Only if you kill it when invisible
---
would rather pay out 50 caps than 200 caps. and with no loss of stim packs and a chance for the AA gun to spin up it might actually get risky for peeps.
---
Only free state world event I really know of is: Constant Vigilance. If I remember correctly, it appears at a random radio tower.

excellent advice and agreed
---
I took Dec/Jan/Feb off
---
Very much enjoying the stability and where the game is at atm personally
---
Forget about the repait kits. The only real scenario to use them would be right in the middle of a boss fight (Queen or Imp). But that only if yo uare careless and start the event before first checking the status of your weapons (given there's a weapon bench at the Queen fight anyway).
---
Yes they‚Äôre working on making CAMPs invulnerable to player damage soon
---
Consider having Marsupial. A good Vampire weapon helps a lot.
---
Do you have a donate button?
---
Sorry that happened to you.
---
Just for reference. Idk where your camp is. but alot of people will destroy anything near the golf clubhouse.
---
Good news! The next patch should enable invulnerable camps to anybody who you haven't attacked!
---
Not to sound too harsh, but if you didn't play for the past 6 months - we don't need you to come back. Who cares if you play with us or not? It's what you want to do that matters. Personal opinions are just that - personal.
---
If reviews and numerous YouTube videos put you off of getting the game - good. Stay away, you won't like it.
---
Fallout 76 is like a new dish. If you never had it before you might like it or you might hate it. But if you keep hearing it tastes like shit, when you try it - you will hate it due to the preconception you will already have.
---
I value games on how much fun I'm having playing them. I don't care about P2W mechanics or if my chosen build isn't optimal after an update or new content added. I'm playing it to have fun. Better yet if you have friends to share that experience with.
---
I did have a witty response for when your inevitably responded that you were banned, but that was 2 days ago.. so I forget.
---
Right up at the top ;)
---
Mutations should have worse negative effects and be way more rare. It is in fact ridicolous that everyone jumps like that. On the other hand, once yo uget use to it and strt a new char... it's hard to get used to normal jumps!

sure you have the right garlandtd? your name seems familiar and I  know we just chatted a bit ago in that other thread. hmm yeah Ill need to buy some serumsbut I have to level up 7 times to change over.

Fast travelling away and coming back has cleared it for me.
---
Absolutely. Still playing everyday.
---
I really like settlement building. FO 4 had some nice mods that made it a treat. Bethesda did not take any notes. ('sept the moveable C.A.M.P format, that's cool)
---
I did the exact same thing as a noob. Snuck into the house and nearly creamed myself when I realused the sap hadn't locked his chest. But when I came home the bastard had raided my chest aswell!
---
Give everyone a pipe pistol and no armor and let the skilled people shine through..
---
There's hardly any consiquesnce to anything we do in this game as it is. It's already too easy, adding this option just makes everything pointless.
---
  My advice would be just make a good rounded character and stop trying to be this 1 shot pvp god that has bloodied and all the low health perks, because sooner or later Bethesda are gonna make changes and your build will be redundant and all your hard work lost.
---
My character can switch between heavy guns, rifles, shotguns, pistols and melee weapons. I have enough special in each category, to have at least 3 of the respective weapons damage perks and plenty other quality of life perks.
---
It's a bum hole
---
Yea it‚Äôs definitely worth, especially with upcoming updates that look enticing.
---
You placed a few objects in a room. Cool. 0
---
welp due to our history if you want junk goodies ask me first im usually sitting on at least 100 plus of everything, and if you hook me up with serums we can test some things and you can take my caps while i go through the learning curve. i will have to do some trial and error.
---
yeah, 1/3/4 are cavalier
---
Mine got so far and wouldn‚Äôt continue, then it just died and disappeared.
---
Now if they'd only allow us to build our CAMP's closer together and let us actually build a community.
---

Sounds like you should ask you friend what perks he has and attributes are on his armour to find out the difference between the rad accumulation while in the same area.
---
Otherwise I have the smart a** remark of, your in a nuke zone of course your gonna get radiation damage....
---
Get team mates and use rad sponge. Never worry about radiation again. Other than that that suit im pretty sure has some kinda mediocre stats for nuked zones.
---
You again ?
---
How about you spend less time pleading your "innocence" on a subreddit filled with noone that can help you in your supposed case and more time emailing Bethesda or ZOS?
---
Are you max level with level 45 excavator parts?
---
Always ***ALWAYS*** pop a Rad-x or Rad shield.
---
Me and my mate also have one point in rad sponge, so we continously cleanse each other.
---
Top left of map ish
---
Top middle left
---
If you're playing in a team, someone should grab rad sponge and share with team and another ghoulish and share with team. One will take away radiation so no more radaway or radx needed. The other will heal you the entire time.

Doesnt work. Anything you wear underneath PA dont work.

Oh really! Level 60 and I always thought It did. Well thanks manüòÇ
---
Game is considerably better than launch (but still a buggy mess and it always will be)
---
Repair kits can be acquired in game, though it could be a harbinger of what's to come for the Atom store.
---
If you think you have the patience and can find it extremely cheap. (Got mine for ¬£13) Go for it.
---
Otherwise, wait a little longer to see if Bethesda ends up shitting the best with the monetization.
---
Be prepared for crashes and server disconnects. Be prepared for frustration. This is the more honest, unbiased answer I think I can give you.
---
My guess is that you are wearing a low level PA. Get max level, it has better radiation protection. You will get some radiation even in the best suits of PA. And 1 hour is a long time.
---
Np :) Many people dont know this. Been this way since fallout 4. You can easily check for yourself by looking at resistances when you are in PA and out of it.
---
But yea, everything gets removed once you jump in. So if you are wearing armor it only takes up inventory space.
---
50 minimum, I'd day. Though I've seen 200+ go down like they were nothing.
---
Full level 50 power armour or a solid build of you're not in PA is mandatory.
---
As a new player to 76, I had immense fun. I managed to level from 28 to 70 with the help of a kind stranger. I even found a solid legendary which I managed to trade for my "favorite" weapon.
---
I've never felt more ready to tackle everything the game now has to offer. Im excited to complete the main storyline and explore without worrying of entering a high level area.

I don't see an expiry date on the codes? I've been caught out using expired codes in the past would be good if you could list expiry and auto croos out if the have expired and new ones not yet been posted.

I spent almost the whole weekend building a new CAMP so didn't get the full XP benefit but still went from 106-111
---
Level 200 ish lots of hours in this game so I have seen pretty much every aspect.
---
I bought the bundle of regular repair kits but somehow keep getting the advanced ones. I kill a lot of scorched beasts and do a lot of events but i am not sure where i keep getting them from. 
---
Servers are pretty stable for me most of the time but there is still the occasional hiccup especially after peeps drop nukes.
---
the new bulldozer and camp placing changes are nice.
---
increase stash capacity is nice.
---
tells you when you already know a plan now. 
---
for me the social interface is a huge pain in the butt and not worth it but for many they seem to like it.

pvp is still horrible for everyone but the alphas. if you do anything but specific builds you're just a loot pinata.

All of that being said I enjoy 99% of the game 99% of the time. the 1% of the game that sucks for me is all of the fast travel and loading screens. line in the sand is a brotherhood of steel event that I absolutely love when it works properly but it glitches out on me about 1 out of 3 times. 
---
Fallout games in general are not for everyone. including fallout 76. I cannot tell you if you are going to like it only that for the most part I do. 
---
as a frame of reference concerning stability I have had only one server crash for 3 weeks.
---
Right well thx man
---
Someone gave me one of those with 18dr , but I ditched it because I didn‚Äôt know it was safe or not to have it
---
Hey man, if you want to add a "Hints &amp; Tips for New Players" I can sort out a all the ones I've gathered over my time on FO76 and share them if you like. 
---
Some are really strange like Butchers Bounty (Extra Meat from Dead Animals) having a desperate button to be pressed, and some are just helpful for everyone (where to find photos you've taken).
---
Honestly, just Google fallout 76 holotape games. Bam. Done.
---
oh and for example the other day we were fighting the queen and she just decided to fly away. she went all the way to the world border and just stayed there. this was after a considerable investment of ammunition and wear and tear on our weapons. not everyone chased her so we ended up failing. it does little things like that from time to time.
---
It's not in the game right now. I think we get more lenses in future updates.
---
Not sure I understand, but that sounds super useful. Have any references for me to take a look at?
---
Wear the community down to the point they are begging Bethesda to add cash shop items. You poor souls.
---
Yup. It's the same model as the one in F4. The modding community made, well, a mod which added functionality to the helmet's flashlight.
---

---
I spent ages trying bog town only for there to be behemoths but no hounds anywhere in the area (even tried the steakhouse). I hopped the above location ~10 times and a behemoth and hound are one of the attacker group spawns. 
---
Because it's a narrow gate is reasonably easy to get both in shot.
---
I can take some pictures when I get home and see if they help
---
While it sucks when my camp gets attacked. I don‚Äôt think it should be removed.
---
&gt; The server has a certain amount of slack to allow for bad latency.
---
No, not really. It's a function of the way the game client and server communicate with each other. It's called tick rate and every online game has it. It's commonly abusable in FPS games.

It was the only way I could like your post enough because the provided ranking system was inadequate lol
---
As much as I'd love a clock counting down to when they expire this could be hard work, as I'm not sure if it's the same time every week (and Day-Lights Saving Time might mess it up) but even just a "Be carful using the codes late Monday Night, Early Tuesday Morning as this is when they normally reset" would be helpful :)
---
When? How about: when they feel like it?
---

---
I loved the Double XP but at the point of quitting the game until build diversity, and many more improvements come to the game. 
---
I'm a pistol player and I've moved my points and stuff around so much trying to figured out what to do and it's fucked me so hard. 
---
I loved Gunslinger in normal fallout games but just feels underwhelming unless you get a decent legendary drop or you take advantage of the Pipe Revolver using rifle perks stuff. 
---
I've tried a few different builds and everytime someone's like no I don't understand why you're doing this, your going 3 stars when you should go 1 star in each perk, and the others are like you should put 3 stars for maximum damage. Like FFS I give up.
---
All these "You have to do it this way to be viable and get god ttk" have burnt me out and making me hate the game in general.
---
You have a respec kit, it's called leveling up. I just leveled my rifle toon up 38 times to respec it. Thank you double xp weekends.
---
Then why are the cast bar mods for WoW based on your latency, as to when you can start to precast?
---
LOL thats great. I did not try to steal my own stash. i could not play right away when it released so I had to wait. while i waited i watched ALL the you tube videos. I knew all the basics and a lot of advanced  before I even downloaded it.
---
Getting there; however, You‚Äôre missing 2 of the 3 most important (absolute must have) perks for pvping against Sentinel builds with heavy weapons. Concentrated fire (required for all pvp builds) allows you to target limbs.  Use a vats crit to the head to near insta kill by bypassing the sentinel effect.  Additionally, you need one gun army which will stagger the opponent temporarily negating the sentinel effect.  Heavy weapons drain ap rapidly so you‚Äôll want something like critical savvy or four leaf clover to build crits quickly and have one saved in case someone attacks. 
---
Acquire a powerful fast fire rate heavy such as an lmg.  1* anti armour is fine. One with vats less action points cost may be helpful (haven‚Äôt tested if it‚Äôs helps enough on this type of weapon).  It definitely can‚Äôt hurt. 
---
Finally, Stealth boy torso mod is REQUIRED for pvp in power armour, and always stay crouched to avoid being targeted with vats!  If you can be vats‚Äôd, you‚Äôre dead.
---
i have had the same problem afetr giving up on finding the alien i tried doing the robot challenge but the camera will not recognize corgobot/vertibot so it will not complete, the take a picture of a player doing X are not much better if you don't play in groups
---
I was coming back from a run down at prime on the weekend, on my level 43-ish non-PA one handed melee character (I'm RPing as a knight, hoping they implement shields one day) when the dang thing jumped me. 
---
I ran to a stranger's fortunately placed camp to heal, but when I shut the door to keep it at bay for a moment I didn't realise the door would lock. I wasn't about to log out with a worthy foe at my door, so I picked the lock and got a bounty.
---
The portal opened, I leapt out and dueled the beast down to about 30% health. It was smacking me like I owed it money, but I was healing and dodging behind trees and nibbling away at it, the Blade of Bastet cutting deeply into its fleecy hide.
---
It was a running battle, and led me almost to the border of Watoga. At one point it had pinned me between a rail car and the platform, but I managed to squeeze out while it was feeling from my blow. It was at that moment that the owner of the camp appeared, slaying the foul demon with a single blow, and sending me following it to oblivion with another.
---
they spawn at where ever magazines spawn ..that's it no special way to find just them
---
Incredible!
---
Considering it's roars can be heard on certain prewar holotapes, this thing IS prewar... the only question is, what the hell/who the hell made it?
---
Several things here are important. 
---
1. first and foremost, **this isn't an mmo** stop comparing it to mmo's. 
---
2. This game has a respec, you acknowledged it yourself. If you had enough time to make the character, then you have enough time to remake the character. Will it take just as long? Yes, but you'll get a lot of good stuff on the way and have a great goal to work towards. You're saying you don't have time to grind but if that were the case then you wouldn't be playing the game at all. After all, literally just playing would eventually get you there. What you mean is you're not patient enough to deal with it.
---
3. The games that this is more comparable to (arpg's like looter shooters and hack n slash) often have limited respec ability, much like we have here. See Path of Exile for instance. I admit most games these days do allow for respeccing if they have a serious time sink to build the character, but not always. The more hardcore the game (survival and dungeon crawler games come to mind) the less likely respec is a thing. Considering this was intended to be a survival game I can see why they've done what they have.
---
If it does indeed turn out to be the Overseer on the cover art then it's clear she is raiding a Vault with us or wants us to raid a Vault. My theory is that she wants us to raid these Vaults in order to find G.E.C.K.s to regrown/rebuild the wasteland instead of nuking so maybe instead of creating flux plants like the nukes do these G.E.C.K.s will have a smaller affected area but make flora more vibrant and more common as well as giving more plants for each harvested plant and also disinfecting water in the affected area so it gives purified water instead of dirty water.
---
Just some speculation, 99% it won't happen but still would be cool to finally see a G.E.C.K. that is usable by the player instead of it just being an item to retrieve for a quest.
---
Wow, again. I've got the 105mm already. Thanks.
---
To me, the mutations add immersion. The game is set in a Post Apocalyptic nuclear wasteland (obviously with some artistic liberties taken). Ghoulification is technically a mutation. Granted we don't "see" any in Fo76, but they're still there via holotapes/notes/dead bodies. So to me, the mutations only add to the immersion of being in this Wasteland. To me, it's a way that the radiation can actually affect the player and not just a way to give you a debuff. I remember the first time I saw someone with speed demon. I was blown away by how fast they moved. I had to look up why they ran so fast, and then it made sense to me. The only part about mutations I find break the immersion is that there are no obvious physical distinctions between people who have a mutation and those that don't. Examples being if you have bird bones, you should have feathers sticking out of your limbs. Or if you have egg head, you should look like one of those Cone Head 90's movie characters. And I'm sure you could find a way to make each mutation easily visible (granted that would take A LOT of effort on Bethesdas part, and we don't want to push them too hard).
---
Because you're both right, there is a tick rate for peer to server response but if you have bad latency then you can 'precast' as you called it and that's what the Mods helped with. 
---
The tick rate is normally low, and if your latency is higher the tick rate sadly will go up too (and that's why things not client/peer side like a SBQ will sometimes suddenly be flying and not on the ground anymore).
---
Don't pick them up...
---
Bloody executioners
---
I love this game.  And it gets better all the time.  They made it launch-worthy six weeks ago (no sarcasm) and have been adding new content weekly since.   Give it a try.  And kick neckbearded you-tubers in the fat roll covering their balls.
---
Vuy a new copy of the game or move on. Oh and this time don't dupe/cheat.
---
It would be interesting if you slowly generate your own maps, based on exploration and Intelligence and maybe Perception. The higher your skills and the more you explore an area or building, the better you know it.
---
*Ring-a-ding, baby!*
---
They said Rad Storms now count as Nuked Zones now... though since they have said that, I haven't seen a Rad Storm daily....
---
Solid 10!!, I feel I do the same. I spend alot of time on my camp when I'm building it. At this moment in time my camp is a frag grenade throw away from Berkley Station. I'm preparing for the update on May 23rd, because of the area my camp is in is constantly hostile, all my turrets are missile turrets. Also found out that a sheep squach spawn is right down the road from me, but I don't need to worry because my missile turrets destroy it every time. But solid 10 on the camp Love it!!
---
Thank-you :)

I hope you get unbanned.   And will buy an extra 40 in Atoms the day you do.

With my sniper, it took me some good 20 head hits to take him down (3 starred). Stoopind hting was he could not see me due to my build (I was always in Caution, not Danger).

With my TSEs characters, it goes down pretty quick, despite the stars.

I like spending time trying to build a nice camp but I have trouble making the area feel less empty would you have any designer tips?

Thank you in advance!

I love that idea! Like a que mode for a deathmatch were armor and weponperks meens nothing!
---
He meant 100+ level, not amount
---
You somehow need to prevent people from last second removal of an item way before people press the buttons. Some kind of preview/review trade for confirmation where the deal is shown to both parties and need t obe confirmed a second time (with a different button).
---
Excavator has little to no Radiation and Energy and mediocre balistic protection. This type of power armor is actually just made for farming ore and nothing else. Get yourself a T51 for ballistic protection or a x01 for energy and rad
---
Eh.. dude you dont have to listen to anybody. Do whatever build you want, it doesn't need to be that big a deal.
---
One man‚Äôs treasure, *is the same man‚Äôs garbage*. üòÇ
---
Go in with excavator armor and you will get 4 lead ore per grab. I walked out with 270 ore in one go.
---
I use prime plasma for the first life of the SQB and then fall back to my .50cal. It saves a lot of bullets.
---
No, he's wrong. I didn't say latency wasn't involved, but what he said, "the server has a certain amount of slack to allow for bad latency."  is wrong. What's happening is because of tick rate, the rate at which you can fire would be based on latency.
---
Well when it comes down to kill a lvl 60+ mob and it takes 1.5 to 2 clips to kill it's a tad bit frustrating.
---
Given how far we are from launch and given this is something that probably should have been there from day one, I wouldn't hold your breath.
---
I am not that interested in reconnecting to the last server. In fact, that container hsa probably gone down completely. But if I have resources (workshops), the money I have invested there (caps for taking them over) should be refund.
---
Sounds good! No rush, I'd like to see that though for sure.
---
Ohh lol, well thanks alot. Appreciate that!
---
Thx . I did have the same problem with the x01 but I did have the Electrically Charged: and unstable isotope mutation as well. 
---
I think one of these mutation caused the acceleration of the radiation, not shure about it .
---
Now Im cleared from those 2 ,but did not yet test the x01 suit.  
---
Thx for the advice
---
Yep, I stood at pitchfork with my historical outfit offering myself for the daily challenge. No takers since I can't broadcast it to the server or maybe everyone already has mules.
---
Solid plan! Thanks alot for that. For me half the fun of the game is moving my CAMP around.
---
Agree, all those specific ones lately are often not worth the effort. Same as some where only doable with server hopping and that is what breaks it even more.
---
Instead something doable casual endgame like "kill X scorchbeast" etc. It's something like
---
"drink a Blackwater brew while dressed as a sheepsquatsh in the mire taking a pic of a deathclaw hugging a mirelurk queen at night while another diseased player takes a pic of you with the nightvision lense" - for 10 Atoms
---
Classic Bethesda.
---
I spent 30 minutes yesterday dressed in civil war gear up at the fort thinking of helping people get easy atoms.  No one showed up so I started messaging a few and still no one.
---
I also have frustration regarding getting 1 shot-ed especially when they do not see my exact position.  I think the main culprit are TSE weapons, they are way to over powered, gauss rifle with 1400 damage makes no sense.  These take all the fun out of the pvp experience, and pve workshop experience.  If neither player is using a TSE, the gameplay is actually fun, with some counterplay options available.
---
   I have been cloaked/crouched, get the drop on a player just to have them turn around and 1 shot me countless times.  I only have a chance if I have full ap and a VATs crit saved up, - a chance mind you.  In pvp often times you do not have these conditions, and all they have to do is fire once in your general direction ending the encounter, not fun at all ( even for said TSE player, im sure that gets boring after 3-4 hours of murdering people with no challenge).
---
Very well done.
---
Could be a daily challenge lately...
---
"Take a photo of 4 Brahmin and a airdrop" lol
---
The best tip I could give without seeing exactly what you're working with is never make a big room unless you're planning on adding walls/rooms within. The reason being is there's really no items in the game other than the pool table that you can place in the middle of a room and make it look good (imo)
---
The more wall space you have means more items can be placed. I personally like the look of a smaller building that feels cluttered and homey, rather than a large building with only things along the walls and then nothing in the center.
---
Another thing is include different buildings, so not everything has to be in your one building. Like for instance I have my decon shower and fusion generator in the shed, and a workshop separated from my main house as well. This makes your CAMP look larger and spaced out.
---
I guess the last tip I have is try that every room serves a purpose. I purposely only have a cooking station inside my house, rather than in the workshop with all my benches. Not only does the cooking station work in the kitchen design wise, but it gives reason for myself and others to enter the house..likewise with my decon shower.
---
This is more difficult than getting Trump and that rocketman from North Korea in one photo.
---
Two **very** different things. Those mods calculate your latency in with how long a spell takes to cast, it's not like they're doubling up your cast. They don't let you cast twice as fast which is what's happening here.
---
Thank you.
---
havent tried mapping quickheal to my side-buttons, i have auto-run and and toggle run/walk on mine
---
Damn harsh weather in the bog. Keeps raining like cats and claws every day...
---
Cavalier + ranged weapons is no bueno. What are you gonna do, sprint towards me and bash my face with your Handmade?
---
I bet if they actually fix it people will complain about the crappy sight in the way.
---
I have no idea what you mean, or it's just me?
---
Go to Grafton Steel, claim the workbench there and repair the helipad on the left (if you go from spawn point workbench is on the right). Vertibot spawns when you repair helipad - make the picture, DONE! :)
---
I think they mean the weight reduction legendary effects.. But I'm just speculating.
---
Never, NEVER pop a Rad-X if you actually want to utilize your mutations. üòÜ

---
I've got all of them for myself, even some doubles for sale for 100 caps each.
---
I don't recognize that exact location, but it looks like you are saying that a group of mutants with a behemoth and a hound, have a chance of spawning as an attacking group just south of the entrance to the whitesprings bunker? Like one of those groups that constantly spawn outside the compound and attacks the robots?
---
If so, thank you very much for the info! Its highly appreciated, I'll try it out.

I wish synths were invented already so we could give Rose a human body and marry her
---
Unless or until we have at least carried out the first or maybe second defense of the workshop from critters, investments should be refunded, after that we accept the risk.
---
They might have been low on bullets. 
---
It is not always the amount of people that gets the queen but also the level of weapons. Found one event just to late with around 10-12 players that failed and then had another with just 4 and we made it with 10 min to spare. 
---
If on the map i always join the fight... if i have the bullets.
---
I went crazy, scorchbeasts, sheepsquach, glowing ghouls galore......fun times. Leveled up 6 times!!!
---
Yeah, there is that. Then use diluted and rad shield, since they don't suppress.
---
Yey! "Another how is the game now?" post!
---
Sounds possible, I'll have to go test it out.

You could always upload a video tour to YT

I hate, when i am overcumbert and came across camp, that have locked fucking doors, if there was not bounty for taking that ugly cube down, i would completly destroy every camp that have locked doors to work benches.

I'm running an old but still loved msi gtx 750ti, I don't get this problem, but have settings around medium and vsync forced off in nViDia settings, I get some tearing but reasonable frames.

Lmao true, but when running with cav, the effects stays on 10secs after u stop sprinting.

Also headshots arent affected my sent or cav

Aaaand it is good, if you want to farm farmhands in flatwoods.

concentrated fire for gatling laser? would that be better for an assassins cryo ?
---
stealth boy torso mod sounds nice but i am not sure if it will let me mod the x-o1. yet its been bugged lately. if i am understanding correctly its to drop out of vats targeting capability only. i doubt i could be sneaking around in it very well. 
---
one gun army sounds nice but field testing it it seemed to hardly ever cause stagger, 
---
captain oob a you tuber mentioned someing about having to come off target and back on to get the stagger effect. 
---
also i have a level 45 assassins cryogenic gun, considered modifying it to fire the pellets. ??
---
I use radx diluted as it doesn't cancel mutations. But it doesn't really seem to lower the rad bar either...
---
I couldn't play much of it and I only leveled up 10 times. I probably could level up 30 times.
---
That's a solid idea, I think I may do that tomorrow since there's been some interest.
---
Nice, thanks.

okey thanks i will check it, so far i have been taking pictures of flying ones and it won't register

it does seem unlikely, i would be happy if they just stopped the servers crashing so much, it's been months we souldn't be havong these kind of problems with a AAA game

my current heavy is an anti armor laser gatling plus 10 to health while aiming and +1 agility 
---
and I also have a one star assassins cryolator
---
Because i am overcumbert and you fucking locked your workbenches, selfish boiz gona lose their houses.
---
Hate to point this one out to you but starting again would have been quicker and "easier" and if you have a friend willing to help you can mule items back and forth. 
---
Plus it means you can try another build while keeping the first one 
---
Once you are above 50-80 (depending how much trash you need to replace from the lower levels ) your kinda at peek power aside from items which as i said before if you already have items that would kit your new Vault dweller (vault-leaver? like what are we calling ourselfs for this game we certainly aren't the courier.) out you just shift them across. 
---
tbh i started again for the survival mode to try a shotgun/stealth build though its rapidly losing the stealth cards and they are becoming DR cards. And getting it where i wanted it to be was much faster(depends on what exactly you want though i guess) than it would have been to reshuffle all the stats and then fish out all the cards at least from 1 you get a bunch of peak packs to open so you get a reshuffle at them as well.
---
You are ugly, is there any quest about you?
---
1) mtx for skill cards and card decks lootboxes
---
2) scrap lootbox system
---
3) publish and sell game
---
4) implement lootbox system again? With card disenchanting, glides, and shit? It's not overwhelmingly competitive advantage since you can grind every card with your time.
---
I hope this is a joke.
---
Current respec system is bad already. (I saw it was was proposed on this forum, but not every good idea is a good idea). Respecing one stat to another keep character progression in a stale total specials state, while his level is +1, and every next level requires more experience. It would be logical to do respec *instead* of level up, or respec as option with level up, or totally redesigned.

Well done man!! My husband tried that yesterday but the hound got killed by a bunch of scorched on the way. Then he tried luring the behemoth to the hounds but as soon as we killed the behemoth it's body disappeared and respawed at the pond. We're going to try luring the hound again  before reset.

after the first crash i spent 30 mins server hopping looking for a nuke zone when i ended up back in the first server it was still up and running, turns out only 5 or 6 people had been kicked from the server (those close to the SPQ) and the rest had stayed in the server
---
Hair, PA, and Weapon skins on the atomi shop are how they'll keep this game afloat. Been saying it since launch!
---
It must be a generational thing. Many younger people who have grown up with the constant 'feed back' from social media are unwilling to take risks or make personal decisions without first running the idea through their social media filter, they need external confirmation before taking the plunge.
---
So we get these regular posts about 'how is the game doing' or 'should I buy this game or that' even when the game has dropped to the price of a cup of coffee and a toasted sandwich, still they cannot just take a small risk and buy the damn game.
---
Yeah. Nothing about 76 is particularly 'AAA'.
---
Bethesda developed games have always been rough around the edges. Bringing one online seems to have been a bridge too far.
---
Say what you will about ESO, but 76 not being handled by Zenimax Online is a bit weird to me. They have the experience with this kind of thing.
---
two years after release......
---
'How's the game doing, should I buy it or wait...' ??!!
---
anyone know if the event has a cool down and how long it is if there is one?
---
People accuse me of using exploits all the time in survival servers, but I legit have never heard of any exploits ever and have never seen any since the last patch
---
Yes, she gave only a bit over 1000 xp. Keeping the mobs of the players gunning the SQB is just as important though because you do not want to waste your strong weapons killing easy enemy.
---
your name though.... Dude!
---
so yeah. I failed to consider that utterly.  It was late and I was tired &gt;&lt;
---
and ill have to add marsupial to make up for the loss of jump jets.
---
That would be so dope.
---
Yeah the legendary effect on my armor piece, do not work for me. I mean with or without that, my weight doesn‚Äôt change, so I wonder is that bug or what
---
i know, at the very least you would think Zenimax would have sent over some of their staff to help set up the game or at least give them some advice
---
tens of hundreds of PAs spawning and despawning absolutely won't hurt server stability
---
the market is a great place to get stuff, but damn if it can some times take days to get an item.
---
it has declined in people as more and more are leaving fo76.  early on, you could go to the market discord and make trades right there and then.  now the discord is vacant 24/7.
---
it is actually sad that trading posts are no longer allowed, as here and the forums are about the only place fo76 people frequent any more.  with player vending coming in a few weeks, how else am i suppose to say, "hey!  here i am!  open for business.  here is what i have for sale."  it is not like i can rip off people.  i post here what i have for sale.  what times i am available.  prices.  where my CAMP is located.  you then come and look for your self.  if you do not like what ya see, you do not have to buy it.
---
not being able to post here just reduces the number of people we can reach.  how is that beneficial to this community?
---
Make sure your texture setting is medium. I think that card has 4gb. FO76 eats through that. That one setting alone should give you smoother fps.
---
\[\*cues\]( [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1VpwYAIrE8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1VpwYAIrE8) )
---
It also works with the cargobots that drop the supply packages that you call in with a holotape.
---
I think i had at three occasions a glowing whitespring without rads. Almost thought it was on purpose.
---
We had a blast of fun!
---
okay, I'll try that.
---
Tell me about it, i had to borrow shotgun-shells a few times so i could carry on my cripple-train.
---
\[cues\]([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1VpwYAIrE8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1VpwYAIrE8))
---
I‚Äôve had similar occurrence with my special stats not being added to from my Armor, I needed a restart of the game then it worked.
---
üòÇ
---
8gb does seem a bit low given the OS etc overhead even before loading the game files, textures and everything.
---
What lens are you using because you have to get really close to stuff for it to register?
---
I doubt it. I have a 970gtx and 8gb of ram. I get the occasional stutter and a bit of rubberbanding, but no massive drops in fps, as long as textures are medium. Your card is just being overtaxed.
---
Currently headwear is cosmetic; if they gave it stats everybody would feel like they *need* to wear a helmet. I personally quite enjoy the current variety of looks.
---
Buy some cheap Kingston ram 16gb to test, you can buy RGB pimped super charged overclocked water cooled sticks later üëç
---
Its the same on console though. Xbox anyway.
---
Isn't the Tesla 100% energy and aa shouldn't work?
---
i will try that i have still have a couple of them, i gave the rest to a low level player
---
They are not supposed to -- you are supposed to be able to pick headgear for looks, not function.  This is a bit fucked up by masks, which can have function and sometimes stop you wearing headgear.
---
None the less, the light on the combat helmet should work, it does on the miner's helmet and the miner's hat.  I guess the fact that it's off-centre makes it harder.
---
\[PS4\] I'm looking at buying the Nite-Kid Roost with the Working Man building. How would I get in contact with someone to do that?
---
i have the 105mm zoom lens the camera seems very hit and miss with what it will tag, i was standing right in front of a senty bot at whitesprings and it still took ages to get it to register.
---
Based on what? I run full weightless and OF COURSE sneak works. Works for everyone who is hidden
---
Went from around 35 to 60. Could've went higher but I had a second character I tried working on.
---
But it‚Äôs all broken and sad :(
---
You won‚Äôt be invisible when you are wearing weightless and sneaking.
---
And a pink princess bed does? üòÇ
---
Yeah, so all I had to do was turn the texture setting to medium. So thank you :)
---
It wouldn't be that hard, you don't have to consider time zones just to know the time the codes reset which I believe is consistent as its just a count down to a specific server time. The are lots of java script countdown scripts out there.
---
The only consideration is how the codes are populated on to the site as I assume he is not just   updating the HTML each time and instead assume he loads them to a DB.
---
If using the DB, you would just add an expiry time column and a counter and dynamic font updates would do the rest.
---
Eyyy fellow bomber jacket and beret wearer!
---
Upvoted üëç
---
Currently have 60 of them. Do the rewards get better the higher level you are?
---
Yeah I've noticed that with both the camera and pearly peepers. I've just done the robot photo challenge with an unmodded camera and I had to stand right on top of everything lol.
---
Or you pick one previously that you want and then it comes in the next pack when you already have it
---
&gt; This type of power armor is actually just made for farming ore and nothing else
---
And carrying shit.  +200 carry weight is not to be sneezed at.
---
Now do the right thing and ban posts that are "How's the game? Worth coming back? Still trash, right?" that clog up 50% of the New feed.
---
I use excavator PA and don't have a radiation problem with diluted rad-x. The stat difference between PAs is underwhelming.
---
Still bugged for me on xbox1.
---
But it's useful if you want to jump out of your PA and play the piano at Whitesprings.
---
yea from the sounds of it it‚Äôs crazy bugged on XB1
---
&gt; server not responding - we really need an option to reconnect to our last server
---
Assuming it's not dead.
---
Maybe you should make some friends?
---
In fairness the longest hairstyle for women is the same length. Presumably it makes life easier with less clipping issues.
---
Yep, that‚Äôs been my experience as well. Maybe u/ladydevann can speak to the issue and offer some insight if this will be addressed?
---
+100. It sometimes gives +200 as a glitch but exiting and entering the PA resets the bonus to +100.
---
Thats why you combine it with the chameleon mutations... Thats the whole point
---
in some places it‚Äôs bugged and doesnt let you activate the tower, usually it‚Äôs in specific places so i‚Äôve just learned to avoid going to those. in one event in the mire the tower is on a cliff so the scorchbeast sometimes spawns on the ground below so most of them are really buggy
---
I run party boy and drink a lot of whiskey
---
I suspect it's been eaten by now.
---
They should just let us do seperate builds for your character. 
---
I hate having to equip all of my crafting perks when I have stuff to craft. Just let us create 3 builds at least.
---
That's correct, there's a gatehouse near the road and a bunch of robots there which random groups of mobs attack. Happy hunting!
---
So what's the meaning for the combination on the Tanagra Town warehouse?
---
That is why i have a seperate workshop specifically left open for other players :)
---
When i was crouched with the mutation it did not work for me so could‚Äôve been my gane messing up gotten rid of the mutation since then though
---
Unless you have calibrated shocks. Then it‚Äôs +200, with the glitch my carry weight is 540
---
I'm surprised that Bethesda haven't announced a photo contest yet. You'd definitely be a contender.
---
It‚Äôs wasteland, it‚Äôs an homage to wasteland. It plays like the grognak holotape game but your a vault dweller instead of grognak.
---
With weightless pieces on? One piece must be bugged. I have tried that
---
On one hand i agree, would look great as other options to decorate our camps but imagine there are many, many players who would do this - some exaggerate for sure lol - and bye, bye server stability, even more like every now and then.
---
Level 103 me died like 5 times last night.  I can usually get through the game without much difficulty, 3-4 scorchbeasts at a time, no problem, but the Imposter Sheepsquatch just makes it clear I'm not very good at games :(.
---
It's doable if you are working with people who understand how to use the mechanism, but people who get distracted like me.... we're fucked.
---
Exactly.   The first time I came across them standing in circle in the road I kept looking around like wut?  Now I shoot them all point blank in the head.  Always.  Something evil going on with those creepy f$#$.   üòâ
---
Reason I'm not making a new character is because of all the hard work I've put in my current. All those quests, being comfortable asf with my current build, and just completely restarting.
---
People have claimed that you can use the Deluxe ProSnap Camera to find the body.
---
Lots of weights at the top of the monorail elevator too.
---
Also useful if you feel a burning need to play the piano.
---
Actually,  they are all waiting for the bus ...
---
Cool pic
---
I don't even know how to use them and im pretty sure I have 50+
---
Thanks, I was always curious when I first saw the name of it.
---
Yeah i had weightless and Some wood pieces because people were telling me that wood doesnt count as armor either so unless they were lying the game must have been bugging out
---
If you are willing and able, I would recommend that you try out the "Fast" Vsync setting. For me, it eliminates both tearing and input latency. Using that in combination with "iPresentInterval=0" in a Fallout76Custom.ini has allowed me to play the game comfortably on a system that does not meet the recommended system specs (i5-3570k@4.2, stock EVGA GTX1050Ti SSC). Limiting the shadow distance via the aforementioned ini (I use: fShadowDistance=40000.0000 fDirShadowDistance=40000.0000) seems to help but requires further testing to say for sure. Of course, there are many other settings that you can also try but these three have made the biggest difference for me. I recommend using the "medium" in-game preset. Any lower and it looks worse but still runs at an unacceptable level of performance. YMMV.
---
150 is nothing.
---
I've scrapped maybe 1,000 leather arms looking for the deep pocketed mod.
---
you can also add +2 strenght to the torso, so that should be 210 added carryweight
---
Plus marsupial
---
It's a good idea in theory, but much contemplating would be required to implement it successfully.
---
What would happen when a player levels up to 51? Would they be booted straight away, booted after a quest, or given a timer to leave?
---
Would all quests be available to players level 50 and under?
---
It'd split the player base and friends, so how would friends play together? Private servers?
---
Would certain activities in private servers have XP nerfed, since it'd be much easier to obtain?
---
It opens more questions.
---
Supervisors in Fertile Soil equipped with Fat Man's? That'd be fun.
---
Lol never heard of that. Only weightless armor works with the chameleon mutation. Armor type doesnt matter
---
Hoarding is properly playing fallout though
---
i also roll herd mentality with strange in numbers for another +3 strenght average, so that should be a grand total of +265 carryweight, not really what i'd call useless XD
---
Even 1* Rad Sponge shared is enough in most cases.
---
Feels like they nerfed it when the repair kits came, I remember almost never having to repair my lever action but now after a few rounds of farming it's gone. Could be just me tho
---
The Perk system is not easy to figure  out imo. Struggled with it a lot my first months and i play every day. Now i use a sneaky rifle single-shot build + shotguns for close combat.  Farmed for legendarys at WS and have rebuilded my Perks more than once. Didn't use VATS for targeting and crits first but now that i do it helps a lot.
---
Definitely SBQ related. I can attest to it occurring twice.
---
&gt; Did one today and somehow got a chinese officer's sword in it. Seem's a little silly.
---
Seems.
---
But you're right, the US Government handing out Chinese officer's swords in as survival supplies is pretty funny.
---
Welp looks like i‚Äôve been fooled
---
Noticing it to.  My axe and lever action both seem more delicate.
---
But if they increase durability then they won't be able to sell as many repair kits in atom shop!
---
something is wrong with you perks, i just used my handmade over the weekend, I think i used around 1.5k rounds on it and i didnt had to repair it.
---
Until that happens, I'll be leaving my decon shower in storage.
---
If my camp is being attacked by a player with a rapidly increasing bounty, I'll quickly close the application.
---
I only mess around with players if I need that damn workshop.
---
Nobody buys them anyways. Just farm the queen
---
Cavalier + ranged is more interesting than sentinel + ranged. Its a game where being seen means being dead. Cavalier is useful when your current position needs to be vacated and you gotta GTFO to better position. This is why my character is a sneaky sniper mixed with cavalier. At least, unlike sentinel, it is useful sometimes.
---
My stepdad has that.
---
I'm not sure why the support web site isn't functioning correctly atm but both the minimum and recommended system specs state 8GB of RAM ( [https://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:JCARMzlHqnQJ:https://help.bethesda.net/app/answers/detail/a\_id/43433/\~/what-are-the-system-requirements-for-fallout-76-on-pc%253F+&amp;cd=15&amp;hl=en&amp;ct=clnk&amp;gl=us](https://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:JCARMzlHqnQJ:https://help.bethesda.net/app/answers/detail/a_id/43433/~/what-are-the-system-requirements-for-fallout-76-on-pc%253F+&amp;cd=15&amp;hl=en&amp;ct=clnk&amp;gl=us) ).
---
Doesn't it still make you wanted?
---
Mine is heavily modified. So its like butter
---
Whaaaat? I run with cavalier since January and I deny this 10sec stuff
---
Calibrated shocks.
---
Oh no it'll be fine. I've totally never seen a server issue with this game. Like why not make it even better by removing the camp budget while we are at it and you know what 3 nukes isn't enough, how about Max of 35?.
---
Way not nearly enough luck. Why shotgun perks if your main weapon is gonna be rifle?
---
Same problem as the goodies from the Mistress of Mysteries questline -- lose the originals and then you're fucked, they've gone forever.
---

---
buils i ran recently should work fine plenty of carryweight 
---
great survivability
---
melee works good for pve basically any melee build is powerful enough for pve no need for bloodied build
---
The train station he's going to spawn at has custom music playing now
---
If you find a duplicate electric staff or electric club mod, I‚Äôll gladly buy them or trade for something. I have extra Burning Barbed mods for both the club and staff
---
Do power armor users dream of mechanical sheep?
---
That will do it, lol
---
But you can!
---
1. Place a wall with a door.
---
2. Place another wall next to that wall.
---
3. Change the original wall to a flat wall if wanted. (PC: R - T - select new wall - E)
---
You may have this already but the Power User perk card helps with the fusion cores and calibrated shocks on the legs give you 100 more carry weight.
---
I also don't bother the 25% cores in world. Just kill a couple sentry bots and take their 100% cores or do the fusion core workshops
---
130 to 145 was icing on top
---
Double XP gives 100% of normal. 
---
Wise Mothman gives 5% for one hour. 
---
Well Rested bonus gives 5% for 2 hours. 
---
Inspirational x3 gives 15%.
---
Survival mode gives 20%.
---
That's 145% XP right there. Idk if it stacks if your teammate shares the Inspirational perk and I have probably missed some but in the end, but 145% XP is great.
---
Twice the references, double the fan service!
---
Buy repair kits with your money thats why they here :))) no sarcasm
---
I think a week free trial with a double xp weekend after it would entice a lot of people to hop in
---
Idk what rad storms even look like.
---
It's still bs though. Such a pain on the ass to be constantly repairing.
---
Excavator is the only PA with a carry weight bonus. 
---
Also; and this might come as a surprise to some; calibrated shocks and jetpacks aren't the best mods out there for PA
---
They have been able to since the event released. They have random encounters as well as their spawn in free range.
---
Then change the stock.  With a scope it'll still be called a sniper rifle, although you can rename it.
---
I came across this, too. I can't remember the area, but it wasn't an event. There were a bunch of creatures fighting it, but I can't remember what they were. I *think* they were super mutants, but I can't remember for sure. I'm a level 21, and I was by myself, so I just got the hell outta there. I *do* remember that it was a level 50 legendary though.
---
Is this still a thing?
---
Demolition Expert only increases the explosion's damage, and by default I believe the explosion deals 25% of the weapon's base damage.
---
Tamed a lot of different Animals and i've not seen one either. 
---
Hopefully they develop the pet Taming to be improved sometime soon because its very glitchy
---
Would never happen. XP would be heavily nerfed. Nuking Whitesprings or The Burrows in  Adventure+ would completely break the game.
---
no, it definitely sounds like vram
---
I had one at Ash Heap station. Had 95% health fighting super mutants. Killed it with my .50 mg. He regens health too i was surprised but only the one time. Also mine just stood there throwing spines. Killed him after about 750 rounds or maybe 800. Got 2 legendaries one was a 2 star. Nice upgrade for a level 34.
---
Haha. Not a chance
---
They just need to make every other region except the starting area to scale with the average level of the players :/ I still love the western  forest side and ash heap region but everything is weak and has no real challenge anymore. 
---
Right now new Players already suffer from way to high mobs because they follow the main quest line into areas with high lvl players and those mobs are a pain in the ass for those players because they dont change their average lvl. People would'nt cramp up in only 2 farm areas if the whole world could be a potential farming area.
---
yes they can spawn at some of the random spawns either by themselves or fighting a group of other things
---
Nah, but there should. It might make the game more interesting
---
* Zealot's Hunter's : +60% damage against Scorchbeast and Queen and 30% damage against the scorched adds.
---
* Zealot's Executioner's: +80% damage against Scorchbeast and Queen when they are below 40% health.
---
Generally, I guess any versus + Executioner's.
---
Lol, u weren‚Äôt the geezer who fired a mini nuke at it at point blank range and nearly killed yerself?
---
Hey @se_1983 it's me selling it if you're interested
---
 I'm looking for 8500 caps or near that psn is beejay1308
---
It's actually Westelad. I even have it for sale for 100 caps (I'm on PC).
---
Negating vatsability is the main and most important aspect of sneaking
---
I say if you really didnt do anything to get ban then why are you, I like many here have not been ban. I wonder why that is...........
---
dude you fucked up now man to it and stop crying and stop trowing you boddy under the bus becuase you got hit and he didnt. (thats a bitch move)
---
buy a new copy. play again and dont cheat, or dont and just move on the next game.
---
Marine armor was actually the strongest non-power armor in Fallout 4, I believe.
---
been force to respawn to one spot for been  overncumbered its the stupidest thing ever.
---
Yeah I know what you mean, It's pretty dumb.
---
Not sure, although I made a video of how to do it as soon as it was released I haven't looked into the numbers for any meaning yet..  it could be something it could be nothing but Bethesda is all about the Easter eggs, it's just a matter of figure it out there code the crash satellite code is really easy cuz it's just a straightforward date some of the other combinations are numbers that coincide with letters that spell out a word or another type of cypher. To figure out everyone in the game you would need some serious code cracking skills, they type that the army would pay you good money for lol 
---
Ill try to look into it more later this week when I get a chance
---
10/10 wow, I have trouble building a shack and people are making things like this
---
So first of assassin sentinel domianted world of slap damage, but in survival, its only applicable on extreme distances where your enemies cant vats you. The gear that is very efficient for PvP is mostly neglected, and 1* armor is enough to get you going. In good hands, fixer is weapon good enough to kill assassin sentinel people. The extent to which old dupers meta is relevant in open PvP is much smaller than in the times duping was rampant and TSE were pretty much oneshotting everyone.
---
Yesterday some guy started encrypted, so I went over to help. Turns out nobody else came l, so it was just two of us. 
---
I'm sorry, level 45 guy trying to do the event, but I'm not going to waste my stims on something I know we can't do.
---
Is it allowed to post trading shop camps?
---
Using the ‚Äúforceful‚Äù stock mod or whatever the bashing one is called normally adds about a third durability to the overall gun.  I do it on all my shotguns and I can go days without a repair from a 200% over repair.  I don‚Äôt notice a difference in recoil or hip shot spread.
---
Its already skill thats shining. But I'd love to play separate gamemode with no legendary gear where crafting your stuff is a thing.
---
Yeah sorry mate, you need access to the dirt to do it yourself!
---
About 20% of all mods in the game have completely scrambled statistics and descriptions, I don't know how they've fucked it so completely, but they managed it.
---
It's not a texture it'll be an animation change.
---
The mire location (near the cliff) is half-bugged - scorchbeast usually lands down below and is outside of event area, so only ranged build can kill it (I play melee, so I fail). Both Ash Heap locations are ok, was able to successfully finish the event, but the Cranberry  bog location is bugged - I couldn't press the switch.
---
I'm sure they will...
---
FOR THE LOW, LOW PRICE OF 500 ATOMS/DAY! BUY NOW!
---
I don't know whats going on because I play on ps4 but good luck
---
Xbox?
---
Ps4 sorry
---
Then may our lord and savior Mothman bless you.
---
I dont have that unlocked yet. Sadly
---
Unfortunately Todd has stated that we more then likely wont be getting joint camps. To much stress on the servers. The buffer room is tech restricted, not choice.
---
Yep, same here. Couldn‚Äôt believe how much stuff was in there... and how all of it was suspiciously familiar.
---
Survival awaits you with its +20% xp and heartless enemy players.
---
100% doable to add a countdown, however not high on my list of todo right now. Its scheduled to clear the codes out exactly at 5 PM PST(reset time).
---
Other than the Luck affecting item condition, I don't think so. I run a Luck 10 Charisma 3 build (lvl 205 atm) and during the weekend, I got 4 3\* armor, one of which is a *Leather Chameleon +25 poison resist Sentinel* armor, but no Explosive and no Handmade (I want versus Handmades). Also Patch 8 most likely changed drop chances as for me, 3\* enemies drop 3\* loot drop 20% of the time and used to be 40%.
---
I know nobody who has high charisma and also tallying their loot drops so I can't compare my results. Unfortunately, it takes roughly 60 hours to build up a fresh character to be competent in defenses/damage output to do mass farming.
---
Or Wade Airport :)
---
Don't need any of that, just two rules
---
+If they're below 50, they can't connect
---
+The level caps for regions are entirely lifted
---
Noob here. Cheese hits from PvP? Or end game pve?
---
sorry, just passing by and noticed you seem to know your stuff, would you take a moment to suggest to me as well what should i set the graphics to? i have an i7 7700, 8 gb ram and an nvidia 10500, my framerate is usually an awful 30 fps which i can handle since i play melee but is annoying nontheless
---
Its true
---
Tl;dr
---
Raise your radiation resistance. That's literally all there is to it.
---
I got from 172 to 181 without really even playing much yesterday.  What a difference the boost in XP makes.
---
Aim for it in time, also I am assuming you run 5 gunsmith for less wear on the weapons?  As you level up you get a ton of QoL perks that don‚Äôt make combat any easier but they make managing your time in game cake. Over repaired weapons, doubling ammo yields, scrapping weapons for 19 steel or 10 plastic each.  
---
I run an exclusive PA shotgun/Explosive build.  Wes Tek Super Mutants drop enough gun powder, Plastic (Scrap Laser Rifles) and Steel (Scrap Assault Rifles) to come out positive on ammo making materials at the end of a run.  I only have to hit up Lucky Hole Mine once every other week or so for Lead.  Shotgun shells don‚Äôt take much lead.  My point is utilizing QoL perk cards saves me time and can almost allow me infinite ammo if done correctly.
---
I went to 77 to 102 yea I hope they do it again a lot of XP from the past 3 days
---
&gt;Chassises
---
Fuck it
---
Because i may use shotgun as well. Is vats crit even viable in pvp? What perks should i have in luck?
---
But I spent hundred of hours as cavalier, lots of that spent on my friends shooting me to see how weapon behaves, and as soon as I stopped sprinting I always died instantly. This 10 sec additional protection is a myth.
---
I always say I want this, but then I remember I'm not creative at all and my camp is just a foundation with a bed on it with crafting tables scattered around....
---
I found one at nar west of watoga fighting a scorchbeast
---
may be, but I couldn't make a photo (that will count towards the challenge) that way - on helipads it doesn't move, so it's easier.
---
Then is cav really only viable for melee? My issue is with sent i always end up moving, and also headshots dont get affected by sent, so when you‚Äôre standing, someone can easily headshot you
---
The solution is more memory. Both system and video. The stuttering is your poor system having to violently swap data in and out of memory because it can't handle everything the game requires simultaneously.
---
The closest thing to a software solution you can get is turning down LoD as much as you can and lowering texture resolution. Even image resolution if you're desperate.
---
I can recommend low spec gamer on youtube, he makes excellent guides on tuning games for the best performance at the cost of visual quality.
---
Wrecking camps for no good reason?  I don‚Äôt get it.  If you are parked behind WSGC with your missile turrets going full bore that‚Äôs going to draw some attention but otherwise why?
---
Vats crit is mandatory in PvP against several high-profile builds. One of two main tools, besides stagger, where you reliably get through sentinel/cavalier effects. Its power is that it ignores armor and legendary armor properties.
---
Four leaf clover - each hit has a chance to refill your critical bar. Each pellet in given shot is a single hit with a chance to trigger this effect. Having a shotgun, or shotgunified weapon (flechettes harpoon, beam splitter lazer) might allow you to refill your critical bar in a single hit. The most mandatory luck perk.
---
Better criticals - at least 1* is highly recommended. 
---
Critical savvy - depends on weapon choice and amount of luck, might be great, might not be.
---
Yeah, literally anything honestly
---
gotta have that to carry all the junk legendaries I pick up.
---
My best guess from watching things happen, is that when someone has a floating rocket deathbarge out back, it draws the ghoulies, and when the ghoulies come, it could include Legendary ghoulies
---
Taking said legendaires from everyone
---
Yo i went from lvl 1 to 71 in the weekend and i havent played more than 6-7 hours. Westek and a friend helping XDD
---
Oh that is awesome.
---
Ahhhhh that burns xD i'm sry for you man
---
This happens a lot when the nuke zone dissipates. There is currently a naming bug that "Diseased" overrides a "Legendary" in the name so better check every corpse for legendary loot. Many times, 1\* Eyebots spawn and they drop 1\* level 1 items (not many items have level 1 variants). I usually gift them to fresh players out of Vault 76.
---
No, cavalier is much better for ranged characters than majority perceives it to be, and people play bad. This game is all about map control and its cavalier that gets you less squishy when you move your character.
---
With 3x aprefresh legendary mod, two 'custom fitted' craftable mods and marathoneer, you can run for about two minutes...
---
Power armor lights are visually off center on the model but function the same. I don't think that'd be an issue.
---
You are not kidding, i switched sessions to rebuild before bed (which i decided not to sleep, yay me) and it was suddenly attacked again by a low-level bounty bait trap.
---
His high level stealthed buddy was waiting 
---
That started a 3 hour affair, which thankfully, fellow players come to my aide like the champs they were.
---
We evenetuslly gave them a taste of their own medicine, found their camps and attempted to raze them, they ran before we destroyed more than a few walls.
---
Now normally, i wouldn't reltaliate in thst manner, but they were a special breed of assclown
---
Exactly my thoughts. Sentinel wont work for me. Cuz either Im gonna melt someone, or im running. ( i melt through friend‚Äôs assassin sent set), so unless I already won the fight, Ill be running so cav is best for me
---
r/fo76bazaar they banned trades here.
---
They could adjust the sights part of the model with no impact on the animations, since the sights aren't mounted on moving parts.
---
Yeah, I was working on making my build into this
---

---
But an individual I've played with a little bit and text chat with on Discord says I'm wasting points and sacrificing damage. 
---
I've already wasted points and picking perks trying to switch into this and I'm already at lvl 70 or close to. So I'm extremely frustrated and it's making me not want to play at all.
---
Fallout 4 had them
---
Thx for your suggestion. I'm as sure as i can be i think.
---
All in all - scrapping seems not an issue while i scrap nothing as it occured both times.
---
Renameing was an idea in this case of the PAs but i set them back last time and the Tesla wasn't named.
---
The "too quick single item pick up" idea isn't the issue as well cause mostly i tap pick all up.
---
I think it is a bug that might occurs while fast travel/complete events/pick up legendary items.
---
Stangely what also happens a lot that from nowhere i get the legendary item presentation screen also.
---
I dunno... Maybe just bad luck for me.
---
I've never fitted it. What's the problem with it?
---
great guy, I can see why you hang together.
---
Sorry didn't know
---
Would be ok if there was a limit of one per camp then I'd be ok with it,  similar to the fermenter.
---
yeah that would be ok
---
Just wish they'd do it for the week. I work weekends always. I missed all of it.
---
PM me
---
I take over nuclear plants and just stack cores. I try to keep 40 or more in stash.
---
In my opinion, most of the damage and damage resistance perks should be exempted from pvp.
---
I'm not a techie or anything. Just noticed the issue myself when I started playing at launch, and well, there's a youtube video for everything (just looked up card model and F076; the first video I watched clued me in). But your card is either the standard 2gb model, or if it's a Ti version, 4gb.  If the former try textures on low, or medium if it's a Ti.Not going to look great but such is life.
---
Im pretty certain the reason they dont is engine limitations, too much built shit in 1 area makes the game lag hard, trust me, i built huge settlements in fo4 and it pushed my reletively good pc to crashing points, consoles absolutely would not handle it and and low to mid end PCs wouldnt either
---
You can do that by hitting with an instigating and then swapping weapons to an executioner
---
Okay honestly i thought id done the Sheepsquach questline, but clearly not. At precicely what quest name do you find him like this?
---
34 .. 35 is TOO much
---
Using the perk card is recommended. Using Anti-armor weapons/mods is good if you don't have a versus weapon (30% more damage is better than 50% armor ignore due to how damage reduction is calculated). If you really want optimal damage, switch to an Executioner's weapon when the enemy is below 40%. You can experiment with perks/mods in my [weapon damage calculator](https://akarnokd.github.io/rng-76/weapons.html).
---
Instigating anti armor on a hard hitting rifle
---
Well, they buffed the damage on the energy weapons and the durability. Laser Rifles are also very accurate and fire fast, so with Explosive, they do pretty good.
---
Never I hope.
---
Bloodied anti armor melee weapon
---
Of course they did lmao, how else are they gonna make those repair kits sell.
---
Nope, still worked as of last tuesday's patch, unsure about tomorrows patch, probably will still work.
---
To counter that, energy weapons can no longer get Explosive prefixes in the wild, and the only ones that have it now are 'legacy' weapons that had it before balancing.
---
But the thing is, This system isn't low spec. It's mid range. not the best, but very, very, VERY far from the worst.  It is capable of running games like GTA V at high settings, while being able to push out a consistent framerate of 70 fps. 
---
The reason I am getting such low fps in Fallout 76 in these areas is because of Bethesda's shitty optimization. Literally proof of this is me putting the texture detail down from high to medium, and I instantly gained 20 more fps when I restarted the game AND the lag and stuttering the locations I mentioned before was gone.
---
i do this right now depending on the situation im on, really not a big deal. yeah it sucks to use points but lets face it after a point you will just collect skill points. 
---
im at lvl 125 and I think I have like 14 points that I havent used.
---
Exactly.
---
Well.... They are, the gun moves in your hand as the anim plays. To adjust the model to the anim would make it super long and skewed to the side it'd look weird.
---
I think they made it face that way so the user can get the full effect while in first person view. Unfortunately it is too big to see the top in first person.
---
i encountered that for the first time several days ago. needless to say i was confused
---
No! No stats!  Except -PER stats.  Those are OK.  No stats for you!
---
No.
---
I have played this all weekend on both adventure and survival and have not had a single person destroy my camp but have had the scorched make an attempt.. are you 100% sure this is people doing this?
---
I do think that they should remove the ability from adventure mode but keep this in survival,
---
My opinion is that adventure mode is a passive mode, you are all in the same world but you cant actually do anything to each other and survival is for all out chaos.
---
[I don't see how moving this sight post on the model slightly to the right would change any animation in any way.](https://imgur.com/a/lUZ1sRK)
---
i don't have a mic which makes it hard to communicate with just those emotes, everyone else i do know have quit the game
---
The price of the seriums in the white springs bunker is outrageous
---
It's a shame they didn't make workshops into joint settlements.  The resources provide an incentive to hold them.  Most of them seem like places that a settlement might spring up.
---
it's seems to be the most common disconnect place in the game
---
I levelled my new stealth commando 25 times during the double xp weekend!
---
I hope Bethesda would feature this on their Instagram page! They often post fan made content and this definitely earns the attention. Like the best way to advertise that DLC (or whatever patch the sheepsquats is called...)
---
me me me me me me me me me me me me me me me me me me me me me me me me me me me me me me me me me post lol
---
I occasionally add comments on FB or Twitter saying I'm still playing FO76 and enjoying it, but I still get the hateful comments from people saying things like " Damn he must be the only one", I used to respond and vigorously defend FO76, but I'm tired of the bullsh\*t and infantile comments, so I tend to now block on FB and Twitter, which removes them from the discussion, I care not IF you think me blocking them could be also regarded as childish, but if you want to act like an ungrateful petulant child, I really don't need you in my online life. Social media has a lot to answer for, giving everyone a soapbox to preach from, and yes by definition, that includes myself, but it just amplifies the negative as much as the positive.
---
They are random encounters like the grave, tank, downed copter and deathclaws nest etc.
---
Still no reason to log in. Just a miracle for me how to top line 100hours without burning out.
---
R u sure? I got one from a drop 3 days ago, haven't looked to see if it has DR tho
---
The problem with this approach is if you only do what the game considers "slap" damage nothing spawns for you anyway. You have to see the health bar move. This has happened for me on the SBQ and on one of the sheepsquatches I was fighting on a low level alt.
---
And that one respawn is the opposite side of the map, costing me 28-50 caps to just respawn, and DOUBLE THAT if I want to go back to get my dropped loot!
---
Camera works nice, taking photos of some funny bugs and glitches appeares to be so easy now))) 
---
p.s. photo is supercool üëç
---
No
---
Pretty sure this is the spawn point at cranberry bog. Just outside abandoned bog town workshop. 
---
And this would be the real Sheepsquatch not the imposter.
---
I personally leave my CAMP unlocked, but I do have a garage door that has a switch inside and outside for players to get in, but random enemies like scorched or ghouls can't get in. Also have, like, two stash boxes outside just in case. But destroying someone's camp just because they're locked up is definitely a dick move, dude
---
I‚Äôve an explosive handmade max level if you want to trade me for a sentinel chest...
---
I hate seeing trading posts on this sub, for a number of reasons.
---
1. They foster no discussion. 
---
2. By their nature they are short lived.
---
3. If you don‚Äôt trade the item, you are likely going to repost.
---
4. This sub is not equipped with the means to monitor scammers.
---
5. They create unnecessary clutter. Each item will likely be it‚Äôs own post drowning out actual discussion
---
The majority of game subs and forums I visit have dedicated trading sub/forums or at least dedicated threads. Been that way since Diablo 2.
---
Shoot, even the FO76 GameFAQs page has a dedicated buying/selling/trading. 
---
It makes sense to have them in a dedicated section so as not to be ignored as well as not create unnecessary clutter
---
My friend did it at lvl 30 and she got tons of help, but she check that she was on a server with lots of high level people before initiating it. Personally I was lvl 200+ when i did it first time. I also got lucky, lots of professional help. Later I bought a recall card. Total catastrophe that time. Never doing that again!
---
Yeah, it's shitty. But they won't change it, heavy graphic engine work is basically a no-go zone post release.
---
I'm just providing you with your options
---
But wouldn‚Äôt it be nice!!
---
Although yes, rose was awesome in my opinion.
---
Screw u all.
---
once you hit level 50 you gain the access to adventure+ servers
---
players over level 50 could still connect to both servers, so that higher level players could help out low level players or play with friends.
---
at the minute most of the map leans heavily towards lower level players so that high level players never return to take park in events like fertile soil, but if we had servers with no maximum level you could do fertile soil and fight lots of level 50 supervisors with fat mans and that would just be one event it would open up the whole to higher level players again, like an event where we have to defend vault 76's entrance from waves of high level enemies (king of the hill style) and at the end you can unlocked some vault-tec themed camp items or retake morgantown airport from a super horde that takes the entire sever to beat
---
just as a bye the way note for anyone coming out the vault.Go pick up the pistol to the right,and then go BEHIND the vault.nobody seems to find this,to busy looking down.
---
as to the forest till level 25, if you want,sure, but dont be afraid to venture further afield.
---
I,m a 'wots down that road' and where does that bridge go to above flatwoods,ended up in the ash heap way below 25, harder,yes , but way more fun.level 100 now and still not done much in the forest.most stuff will find 'you', leveling up is not the end-all.
---
any way you want.
---
as to the rest   ,yup,   pretty much, get used to it, google helps.
---
Thank you for the info! How important is dr? Are the dr sprint perks I chose not worth it? Same with barbarian since ill probably have to drop some str to put into luck
---
I‚Äôve got loads too, this would be useful when helping lower level players as we could ‚Äògift‚Äô them tapes and they could get a drop relevant to their level. Currently when we‚Äôre in a mixed group you often hear the disappointment when someone says that the legendary item is too high level and they can‚Äôt use it!
---
I think there are actually 2 lights, one on each side. I might be wrong about 2 but there is definitely one on the right side of it
---
SBQ is not invincible. Rethink your perk cards and what weapon you use.
---
No, they're not? Reg. Jetpack I might agree, but Calibrated Shocks are a must imho. Which one you think are better?
---
He spawns like a regular mob (besides the Free Range quest of course). I often see him near Watoga on the way to Quarry X3 fighting with some scorched or supermutants.
---
you would not need to increase the xp gained from enemies you just get the same xp as you would from enemies in the mire or canberry bog but you are fighting them in the forest region
---
Maybe read through this guide about PAs posted here some time ago
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/b7oyri/comprehensive_power_armor_and_mods_guide/
---
TL,DR: Excavator carry bonus only applies for the full set. Get calibrated shocks for both X01 legs to increase it's carry capacity.
---
It was so great. I only feel a little bad about playing video games for 12 hours straight yesterday. Got from 83-92 not as far as I wanted. But it was still a fun time. (Spend too much time sorting/breaking down/selling/repairing)
---
It will be found in any of the silo entrances, but only after a nuke has been launched on that server.
---
Fusion cores aren't a real worry because you can claim the power plants and farm cores. I usually carry between 15-20 cores at a time. There's only a 100lb difference in carry weight between the X01 and Excavator PA.
---
I don't really want an explosive as it is messy and self-dangerous. I think I'll hold onto the chest in case I can reroll it into a Weightless Sentinel with the legendary vendor cheaply.
---
Nature did. Nature made it as with many of the Cryptids, they occurred naturally (but maybe also due to the high levels of pollution present in Appalachia from mining and dumping of nuclear materials)
---
this is a common problem for new players when we started there was no high level players camping in those zones and effecting the level of the enemies there
---
this is a way cool photo
---
from what i know of survival it's still a mess that needs fixing, i don't use god weapons i don't want to go around being able to one shoting everything thats why we need high level servers
---
You haven't seen any?  I hate trading posts on this sub, for a number of reasons:
---
1. They foster no discussion on the game, 
---
2. They are short lived, and you have to hope that once the trade is done that the OP removes the post
---
3. Combined with the above, this sub is not set up to have proper rules and bots in place to facilitate trades, such as ensuring that the poster marks and item as traded, ensuring that the poster marks what platform they are on, providing any way to track feedback on scammers or anything of that nature.
---
4. They will often get ignored, since they are very limited in who will even care, this can result in the OP posting again in a short time
---
5. If a person has multiple items for trade, their are best off posting a single item in a single post, meaning that a single person may need to create multiple posts
---
The vast majority of games subs and forums I visit have dedicated areas for trading, going all the way back to Diablo 2.  Shoot, the GameFAQs  board for FO76 has a dedicated trading thread.  
---
It makes sense to have trades in a dedicated area, it helps promote the economy of the game as people can search previous trades, you can help protect players by having ways to monitor scammers, and by having a dedicated purpose it's easier to keep the sub rules for that one purpose in place.
---
I ignore those mostly, DR is a parameter of third importance, the first being legendary mods and the second craftable mods.
---
I do a mix and match.  even though some areas are predicatable relative to enemy spawns, you never know what you'll run across when, and I generally dont have time to change armors before I'm in the fight (melee build)
---
So I have 1 piece for chameleon, one for -15 ghouls, one for -15 mutant, 1 for health regen, and one for -15 robots.
---
I dont play bloodied/low health, so bolstering doesn't appeal, and I melee, so often get below the threashold for vanguard...
---
Here's a link to my stealth commando bloodied build. It's stupid OP, using 1* bloodied handmade - note: I realized after taking the screenshot i forgot to take ammosmith off, usually it's action boy there
---
https://m.imgur.com/gallery/WdFxaNj
---
Add a set of 1* unyielding armor and shielded enclave under armor, this is what my special looks like
---
https://m.imgur.com/gallery/fDg8gpM
---
Like I said, stupid OP with stealth crits, and with 37 perception I can VATs from ridiculous distances
---
Did it last night with my alt level 20 with a mole miner gauntlet and a sniper rifle.  I just stuck to the pylon and let the heavy hitters do their thing. Got another fedora out of it. Died a lot and the imposter disappeared. Good times.
---
And then you go to that sub and realize one of their rules is no trading posts....
---
Level 74 to 91.
---
Only criticism would be ending it at 6am east coast time. Should end these events like 9-10 PM on last night. Meaning the day it ends they should stay away from a very early ending of the event.
---
Ah. I feel those perks may be wasted as well. Cool then :)
---
Also how much do chameleon cav pieces go for?
---
Cunningham's Law is the term for this situation.
---
I get the same thing from people.  I love this game!  Sure, there are bugs to iron out, but I‚Äôm patient. I can still play and enjoy myself.
---
If there wasn't so many low-levels during SBQ fights that don't do anything useful and only raise her HP... It's a plague now - last time I've counted 9 leechers below 50 lvl, while players contribute to the fight was 6. It's pathetic, that they have guts to tp to the event and leech, running in between others waiting them to do the job.
---
I found lvl 80 in cranberry bogs  just this morning
---
top of the world - random - also on the road into harpers ferry.
---
both level 80 legendary
---
top of the world was kind enough to stand still (cos of barricades), and let me shoot it.
---
if anyone interested - gauss 224/3\*tank/2\*bloody mess-----120 rounds. + shot gun @ 147+ boost if target below 40%.....another 60 rounds. so definatly not a little lamb.
---
the one outside harpers - not even close to being kind, got bloottered
---
set up one turret in your camp.  
---
It should help with some of the enemies that meander through.
---
Mongrels, dogs, and wolves are rarely solo critters.  
---
They generally run in a pack of at least 3.  They circle around you, and attack sequentially.
---
I think a separate thing from the Camp would work. As in Fallout 4 where there were simple trading stands....that would do. All in a row would be awesome. People would flock to that area if it existed!
---
Yeah me too
---
Good feedback I agree
---
Omg this 100% idk how many times I've claimed a workshop. Built extractors to be disconnected from a fucking server. It's infuriating.
---
Jet pack is a gimmick mod. You only get bragging rights if you use it.
---
Shocks are overrated as heck and the usefulness is actually pretty limited. They're not helping you during a firefight. If you're good with weight management having shocks is simply a waste of a slot.
---
Meanwhile a mod such as AP regen legs will provide help in battle, AP is always nice, regardless of your build. Then there's the really fun part. If you get enough AP regen you won't actually be hurt by being overloaded. You won't be able to fast travel or sprint, sure, but you will perform much better in a fight and you can pretty much ignore the carry weight limit.
---
I've spent the last month by being grossly over the weight limit. Did SBQ fights, sheepsquatch, nukezones, silos. 
---
Shocks give you 100 pounds of extra carry weight.
---
Lots of AP will allow you to pretty much ignore any weight limits and still move on. Currently i'm farming west tek with about ~650pounds of crap in my inventory. No slowdowns whatsoever. Shocks wouldn't allow me to do this.
---
I was near  the "lost home"
---
The regeneration bonus of kinetic servos is high enough to eliminate the drain from overweight? Nice.
---
for the moment
---
Ballistic: Explosive + Executioner
---
Melee : Executioner + Vampire
---
Did you consider Luck of the Draw? Taking for granted you repair it to 200%.
---
Only really worth using on a new character a few times. I remember I got my first 50 cal machine gun in one when I was level 25 or so. Also got a gamma gun in another which is only noteworthy because I never find them.
---
But yeah for the most part you won‚Äôt get anything better than what you already have once you‚Äôre level 50+
---
I see a lot of people level 90 who cannot solo the Golf Club at the Whitespring's. You should set a clear threshold when yo usay elite.
---
doesnt incisor(3) = anti-armor ?
---
I'm on PSN can anyone help me calibrate my legs/shocks? I think I have the violet and hardned mass just not the nuclear stuff or the plans. I have caps..
---
THIS! OMG this, happens at least twice a day. Its especially bad when you work to get a power plant back online, then the moment you build extractors....Boom, disconnect...start all over again. It's bad enough having to hope a lvl 150 who one shots you doesn't come to take it from you after you do all the work, but having to worry about server issues makes workshops almost pointless.
---
Core assembly instead of jet pack and ap legs. I do have Lone wanderer too.
---
It won't fully negate the drain, but it's really slow and for some reason sometimes the AP bar simply fully regenerates when it's at 30-60%. It's happening quite often too. 
---
If i stand still  i get from 0 to 100% in about 4 seconds max but there's no need to do that. When you loot a body for example you may stand still 1 second, that's enough to regenerate a pretty big chunk of AP.
---
True, but what if they stacked?  
---
The blade of Bastet is so good because it's 100% anti-armor if the garb of mysteries and eye of ra are worn.
---
Well, if you think about it, not everyone would have the ability to make a massive mansion in an IRL post-apocalyptic society, so it would represent a sense of realism?
---
Those were the times.
---
Yeah, not suggesting it's urgent and appreciate the effort it takes to build and keep these things up to date so thanks for continuing to support.
---
I get through around 200/250 rounds between my tse handmade breaking. It‚Äôs laughable. (Im level 120+ with max gunsmith, weapons artisan, rifleman build)
---
Action boy/ girl might be useful too. The kinetic servos acc. to the wiki only regenerate when you move though.
---
Yessss I worked so hard to get the PP up in the mire to farm FCs, boom seconds after I finish disconnect. I hateeeee it.
---
It's always like that, but not every item has the possibility to teach you the plan - some, like BoS's found as rare spawns in cranberry bog won't. Ones that can still depends of your luck (not SPECIAL stat, your luck in general) - I've scrapped dozens of Combat Armor Helmets and still didn't learned the plan. RNG...
---

---
Third person gives you a dot when aiming. Tricky to get use to but you can snipe with a gatling that way.
---
You only really benefit from Vats crit hits if you are sneaking and are Undetected or you are using some automatic weapon where you are able to use them way more often. If you are seen by enemies as a stealth build you will do absolutely no dmg
---
good point.

this is what i run
---
I hate that my all rise breaks in the silos
---
Most likely decat rates were increased with the addition of repair kit. That's just my guess, but they upped decay rates on food in prep for refrigerators too.
---
It probably cost more than 500 Atoms to obtain the canvas
---
Lesson learned - I suggest skipping PvP, its a pointless activity in a builds based, equipment dependent game.  I'm far from the best in most PvP games but in ones that player skills actually matter, at least I still have a decent fighting chance.
---
You can win PvP fights easily enough by playing the meta here, but that's beside the point, its just gearing up and picking the right build for it.  I'd venture a guess most of the PvP players in this game wouldn't be able to hold their own in a true skills based PvP shooter.
---
Personally would like to see a hardcore adventure server with no PvP. Strictly one life!
---
Past a certain level you can't really gain any more survivability than you already have. This isn't like fallout 4 where you get more health each level no matter your endurance.
---
That‚Äôs neat. Didn‚Äôt know that. Is that the place near Harper‚Äôs Ferry?
---
Oh snap
---
Whoa! 
---
People still play fallout76?
---
It only flies like 20 feet before it splits.
---
I love you. ‚ô°
---
Got action boy too, forgot it. Grim reapers sprint for in-combat ap regen, and yeah you have to move but there's this lovely trick for power armor.
---
If you move sideways/forward you get normal AP drain while overencumbered.
---
If you move backwards/reverse the ap drain is inanely small. The perks/mods i'm using are able to fully regen with 0 drain. I'm a vats rifleman; in combat i usually move backwards, to keep the enemy in front of me. 
---
Not sure if the lack of ap drain while moving backwards is a bug or not but at the moment works really nicely.
---
Update. Having tested reloading and turning round with Chameleon mutation and weightless armour. Doing both does not put you out of Chameleon. There is also no noise when going in and put, plus no bright blinding light, as the chameleon armour does. 
---
On the minus side. My Weightless armour is not as good as my Chameleon armour, but that is correctable. Also I don't think I'm as invisible as my Chameleon armour. I was spotted way quicker when in Whitesprings.
---
I've still to test it against Harpers Ferry or a tough boss, such as Sheepsquatch or Scorchbeast.
---
So far, I'm leaning towards Chameleon armour.
---
Both two shot and explosive cause more durability decay, as does an auto receiver. I have an AA/E semi auto handmade with 4 ranks of gunsmith and I‚Äôd guess I can put a couple thousand rounds through it before it breaks.
---
In fallout 4, the missile launcher and Fat Man were among the most powerful weapons in the game. In this, they are a meme I only break out to reduce carry weight.
---
Sure enough. Just at level 200+ I'd kind of hope you'd have a relatively optimised build / decent gear to not immediately be cut to ribbons.
---
But yeah, I know everything past 50 is technically superfluous.
---
Do you feel adamantium is worth it? And how do you think adrenaline effects things?
---
The Fallout theme has a lot of potential to create interesting game world. However Bethesda has failed to do so. Game is more like a broken testing environment where none of the game mechanisms works properly. There is no end game content at all. AI is the worst I have seen in gaming history. It practically does nothing. Enemies are just standing still and you can just kill them easily. If enemies move they are being spawned around you to create a illusion where they flank you. Most of the challenges are broken so you can't earn atoms because it is impossible to finish those goals. Just a few things to be mentioned. I love Fallout as a concept, but this kind of poor game design will kill it sooner or later.
---
I'd strongly recommend fitting 3 ranks of One Gun Army (under Luck) into your build. The stagger gained can be a lifesaver and also serves as a counter to the sentinel and cavalier legendary effects (15% damage reduction while standing or sprinting, respectively). In other words, staggering a player wearing legendary armor with those effects will temporarily nullify them and give you a chance to start doing more damage.
---
Right.. it was possible in 4 why not 76?
---
Yeah all the explosive heavy weapons need a significant buff. Even the grenades could use some love as well. Right now the only grenade that is even moderately effective is the plasma grenade. My power fist hits for 3 frag grenades worth of damage, and it's not even a bloodied build. 
---
Demolition expert did break explosive guns, but the Nerf crippled heavy guns.
---
No? It was a challenge yesterday
---
They're a pretty good source of income for lower level players. I've been told that it makes you more susceptible to Mothman encounters as well, though I can't confirm that.
---
I had similar idea to make survival unlockable after you complete main quest in Adventure mode. Then survival could be much more challenging :)
---
Adrenaline is 100% worth it, the damage you get it crazy. Aduamntium is worth it if you don't wear power armor. It completely eliminates cripples and limb damage..

yesterday we had a server full, been a long time since I saw that many respond. Field was full of high level players with good equipment. good players too, cryo attacks, wing crippling etc. we got her down, just barely with under a minute left.  I looted her about 3 seconds before the server crashed. I dont think many others were that lucky. I spent a good chunk of that day farming 5mm.  I think I forgot how expensive a queen fight can be.

The new one I have seen is replacing the doorway with a full wall in edit mode before they leave when it's obviously normally where they enter because of the steps leading to it.
---
I had a jump around and could see workbenches by windows so could have got in if I wanted but i just moved on.
---
They do extra damage. I'm a vats rifleman, every 2nd-3rd shot is a critical.  
---
You can test this really easy. Get a mid tier weapon, shoot a ghoul, see the hp bar. Charge the critical bar and critical shoot another ghoul. It will deal way more damage.
---
I‚Äôm going to move a bunch of crap to a mule so I can drop thruhiker. Ive been debating dodgy or adrenaline to replace it.
---
Exactly what i do with a lever action on super mutants, 1 hit leaves them with 15% health and so does 1 crit.... even with better criticals. What weapon are you using
---
Yes. Mothman will be unhappy with you.
---
You need full set to have the extra carry weight
---
There‚Äôs only one part though that is needed to get the bonus ore collection
---
No there are none but they are a good source of food and caps if you aren't that high of e level ;)
---
Omg those posts drive me mental.
---
"Haven't played since beta, whats the current state of the game? Still trash?". Just read through some of the sub....

The chameleon armor effect stacks per piece for NPCs (obviously not players). I've run chameleon since day one. There's a huge difference when you've got an enemy walking by you while cloaked by 1 chameleon piece and 5. Easiest way to see for yourself is equip the whole set with escape artist, run close to or nearby NPCs until you get danger then duck. Escape artist triggers cloak while crouching to lose (almost always puts you in caution) and you stay cloaked with the chameleon armor effect. Time how long it takes you to go to hidden, most times with fewer pieces, you don't even get to hidden. Honestly, if you want chameleon for non-pvp use, I'd say run 5 pieces or there's no point at all because even 4 pieces doesn't help you enough in a lot of cases unless you're just stalking an enemy's travel path.

Griefers who couldn‚Äôt cut it in survival, have to get their feeling of power somewhere else.

Fwiw, if you‚Äôre camped in a high asshole traffic location, but don‚Äôt want to move make camp blueprints and block the asshole GT whenever you can.

I like it

imma go check right now :)

Our community is growing closer slowly overall. This weekend after White Springs got nuked it was great to see players tagging glowing ones and then leading them to other players to get a hit on the enemy as well. People finding spawns and then calling others to share in the fight. I t has become pretty standard to see players greet other players.
---
Yeah..... not really, the flatwoods monster is an alien, the mothmen were "summoned", wendigos mutated from cannibalistic humans, the Grafton monster and snallygaster were West Tek FEV experiments that got out...

Claudia: "Where's the curve?"

Been there, during the beta I saw someone using a box at a train station, I crouched in the corner waiting for him to leave and then emptied it. Didn't realise until a while later exactly what a STASH box did..
---
started a new character and got him up to level 53 this weekend! the XP runs are so helpful
---
I think that any occasion where you can get them for caps is a lucky shot and its a trade-only domain. I got one for which I'd gladly pay 25k, and the guy wanted 800 caps for it.
---
I have a damn good reputation with the people I trade to. Enough that quite a few have hung out a while and even dropped their high end weapons so that myself or one of my buddies could modify it for them. We trade fair, we treat people well and even make sure they have enough food or water before they leave my modest house. Not everyone here is trying to take advantage of everyone. Some just wanted to post on a sub that had a large amount of subscribers. Its just business.
---
Damn. Okay but its worth 25k? 
---
I can just trade something for it later
---
I never got the "power armor only in nuke zones". I have an unarmed melee character who has a lot of damage resist perks and mutations. I slap on a hazmat suit for nuke zones and I do fine. Blocker and the perks/mutations means that glowing ones don't really hurt. The only thing I have problems with are Watoga and Harper's Ferry super mutants in a nuke zone.
---
well, having been one of those leeches (particularly on my lower level alts), I can testify that I have "participated" in many, many SBQ events where the game thought I didn't contribute enough to even be worthy of having completed the event, much less get any loot from the queen. So there's frustrations on both sides.
---
The first time I saw someone elses camp I went to use his/her tinkerers shop and at the same time managed to somehow get a wanted status. I was deathly afraid of other camps for about 30 levels
---
Or your in pvp, In pvp their devastating even against sent assassin
---
I just spam random people with friend requests, there are always a few who accept you.
---
Worked pretty well when I found a tourist -- sent friend requests to everyone on the server with the location.

i7 9700K + 32 GB + 2080 Ti + fiber connection here and game still lags time to time. Any other game with much better graphics and more details will work 100+ fps without any problems or frame drops. Fallout engine is so poorly optimized and created that it will never give smooth gaming experience to any computer setup. The Fallout's network code is also broken and increases latency and lag. Fallout needs a new modern day game engine and game developers that are not the cheapest and most incompetent in the gaming industry.
---
They defiantly do more damage if you‚Äôve ever pvped you‚Äôd be aware of that, particularly against sent assassin users. I‚Äôve at times been 1 hit by good crit builds and I run a full marine sent asssassin set
---
&gt;Meanwhile a mod such as AP regen legs will provide help in battle,
---
Only if you use VATs, which I never do. 
---
Calibrated shocks are a godsend for my  heavy weapons build that doesn't use vats.  It allows me  to skip the batteries included perk and use all 3 levels of stabilized which is a must for a heavy weapons build. 
---
Jet pack drain is negligible on fusion cores if you have all three levels of power user.
---
If you consider the drunk pilot drops the damn thing at random points on the map not even close to you, it makes better sense  /s
---
Fortunately, CAMP vending machines are supposed to show up on the map when powered on, according to the files. Whether or not they'll show what you have is a different thing.
---
I frequently log on and have multiple level 62 ghouls destroying my stuff. I‚Äôm only level 25 so they kill me often.
---
Adrenaline. It makes a huge difference. Even against the SBQ, you kill 5 spawns and you only have to kill one every thirty seconds to maintain the huge boost.
---
you can kind of make inner corners yourself, but your walls end up higher or shorter. but if you put down a half wall with a sloped roof next to your full wall at 90 and fill the gap with the "upside down triangle piece" you get an inside corner. but for it to work your upper floor has short half wall dormers, or is 1.5 walls high

I think it would be logical for the vaults to open and the dwellers repopulate Appalachia.  It wouldn't be a stretch to have raiders, settlers, and caravans return to the area either.
---
are those not available from (one of the) faction vendors at whitesprings?
---
Don't ask. Either play and see or don't. But don't just ask. Google? Search this forum for updates?  But don't ask us to convince you to play.
---
I feel bad for people selling those types of items and not realizing their value but not so bad that I don't immediately snatch them up and giggle like a loon all the way back to my stash box.
---
That‚Äôs no so much bc of a crit I have full assassins armor and I‚Äôm built to not to get one hit there‚Äôs a glitch with the perk concentrated fire that lets you target one limb and when you do you only get the protection of the one limb. If they do that and use a critical it‚Äôll probably one shot you bc your going from like 140% dmg resistance to maybe 40%
---
Yes no yes
---
Got the master hacker card in +80lvls...that is all
---
PVP primarily, but it works against both pretty well.
---
I've found numerous 2 shot and Vanguard armor pieces at vendors.
---
No that‚Äôs not what it is, if you don‚Äôt think crits don‚Äôt do extra damage have someone shoot you in the head without crits then with a crit, hell I‚Äôll film myself and my friend testing it with full sets of Sentinal assassin for you
---
Define "crashing".  CTOD? Server Disconnect?
---
I've had similar issues... I think it might be my older Xbox, which was "certified refurbished" because I have no problems on my newer Xbox, which I bought retail at an MSFT store.
---
It‚Äôs awesome, especially compared to the gatling plasma which is a massive disappointment...too weak
---
Ad victoriam
---
Yeah, I found that out over the weekend at the Burrows. Longest 9 minutes of my life!!  üòÇ
---
An X-01 PA?
---
Plans to craft X-01 mods are not obtainable in the game. Only way to get them is from the Modus Armory vendor in the command section of the bunker. Which mods are available for sale is also completely up to RNG, with stuff like jetpacks and calibrated shocks being particularly rare. You can find people selling them in trading communities, but it will run you around 2-3k caps for each calibrated shock.
---
I hate dealing with other players selling stuff, I just don't have time to do that. I happily take what the vendors give me and how someone else finds then useful.
---
I just recorded a bit of gameplay with a lvl 35 quad lever action rifle. I took off adrenaline so it won't drastically increase the damage output. Had to use a weaker weapon otherwise the mutants will all die in one shot
---
Upload finishes in 1h38min 
---
BUT, the critical hits definitely work.
---
Lvl 48 mutant - 3 regular hits to kill.
---
Lvl 48 mutant - 2 hits to kill with a crit.
---
Lvl 68 mutant - 4 regular hits to kill
---
Lvl 68 mutant - 2 hits to kill
---
When i finish uploading i'll link it
---
Probably never.
---
They won't unban people until they can institute unique ID's for items, trade logs, and some way to track our inventories in real time. I'm not sure the game engine can handle that workload without blowing up. Not being a coder, I don't know but I suspect those are things that need to be included in the code from the ground up. Not things that can be added to the single player engine they have now.
---
Also ‚Äúbuilt not to get 1 hit‚Äù you run assassin armour man, please don‚Äôt start talking all high and mighty when you clearly don‚Äôt understand mechanics. There is no bug with concentrated fire that‚Äôs how it‚Äôs meant to play, and even if you target my head I still have Sentinal and assassins affecting not just trashy damage resistance, btw damage resistance means nothing in pvp. Anyway if you shoot me in anywhere but the head which isn‚Äôt armoured, you won‚Äôt do any damage whatsoever. You should me in the head you‚Äôll do a maximum of 3% of my health, if you crit me in the head you‚Äôll chunck 80% of my health
---
Why? The pulse of the community around then was pretty much of the mindset that the game was terrible and felt it was a bit of a cash grab. I'm asking because I would like to get the overall idea of what all of you guys think of the improvements, what kind of stuff expanded the endgame, etc. Why google search it when it just gives the technicals if I can ask the community what they think, all things considered? I am not asking you to 'convince' me to play again. I am asking because I want to understand the pulse of the game. If you are gonna be a dick, why bother answering at all.
---
basically, new game +
---
I think bloodied builds save on armor degradation cause we are always getting one shotted.
---
How do you activate the event?
---
Yeah, hahahahha
---
I think it would be "CTOD" if he was playing on PC. But it's Xbox; it crashes to home. I effectively had to use a much newer console.
---
Yeah that's true, my All Rise still breaks as fast as it used to do and I haven't seen anything about a nerf like that so it has to be some kind of 'stealth nerf' or whatever it's called
---
Classic Bethesda
---
While we are fixing stuff around here, can we get a minimum karma?  Nothing crazy, just enough to stop some of the throw away posters crap posts about bans and spamming downvotes?
---
I hate to tell you this but whatever information you received is false and you need to recheck every single one of your facts. 1. Regular assassin armour won‚Äôt do anything, 2. Built to not get one hit, smh not possible even with sent assassin 3. That‚Äôs how concentrated fire works, enemies don‚Äôt have armour pieces they have natural defence hence why there‚Äôs doesn‚Äôt change when using concentrated fire or AA doesn‚Äôt affect them. 3. Crit shots are insanely overpowered if you‚Äôve ever pvped and had a decent build you‚Äôd know that 4. Crit shots work, if you really want proof I‚Äôll get my friend to demonstrate with me 5. Damage resistance means absolutely nothing in pvp 6. Damage resistance doesn‚Äôt apply a raw damage reduction %  and of it did it  wouldn‚Äôt  hit anywhere near 70% let alone 140%. 7. Once again your mis informed in so much :) Stay woke, P.S if this comes across as harsh it‚Äôs not really meant to be, it‚Äôs just slightly infuriating when people try to argue about a topic they know very little about

Yeah they can spawn at any of the high-level random spawn areas. Just south of top of the world is an area I like to go to hit higher level creatures now and then and ran into a level 80 one star legendary there the other night. That was a fun fight.
---
Fair enough, not going to argue. I only know stuff about AP/VATS/Rifle builds.

Bro chill I‚Äôm not taking abt dmg resistance I‚Äôm talking abt absorption I gtg tho I‚Äôll argue later
---
We still have yet to find the purpose of Vault 51, maybe it‚Äôs a Faction HQ if NPCs do return?
---
I 100% agree because they bring life to the locations. The one with the bandit posing as a pastor and poisoning those people was a good location. 
---
I only put together what happened when I 
---
found the bathtub in the back room with rat poison scattered around it. I'd like it if I could've found out how the bandit ended up
---
The only consequence is that you‚Äôll have Mothman eggs. And maybe the local Scorched will have a go at you. It wouldn‚Äôt be a bad consequence.
---
I ran into one at the southern end of the ash heap whilst doing the overseers journal quest line tonight. I‚Äôm only level 22, it was lvl 50 legendary. Thankfully 2 awesome peeps came and saved me.
---
What about those who are just wondering around and happen to stumble on your workshop possibly without even knowing it?
---
Of you can't solo Whitespring's GC at lvl 90 you should sort your build out. Have been doing it since lvl60 and only the bloated glowing one was a pain sometimes
---
Southern ash heap by any chance? I got trapped there tonight by one that was fighting super mutants
---
You get them untill you take rad away or go through a rad shower without starched genes, you can take them with starched genes equipped, done this on several toons. Can't live without marsupial and speed demon, be warned once you go marsupial you will never be able to enjoy the game with normal peasant jumping again.
---
kind of but you don't restart the main quest (but that could be a option if people wanted to), it's more about opening up the events again, at level 1 every event in the game is aimed at you but by level 50 you have out leveled most of them, when was the last time anyone over level 20 did feed the people
---
I have 2 garage doors next to each other, on opposite sides of my top floor so I can open it up for a beautiful view of Appalachia :)
---
VATS in PA is a big miss IMO - way too many issues.  Plus using a core assembly over something much much better like Emergency Protocols?  I gave up on VATS in PA, its just a stupid drain on fusion cores, much like the jet pack is too.
---
With perk switching (lucky PC player here) Calibrated Shocks allow for fast travel in PA.  I do use Optimized Bracers for lower power attack cost though.
---
The one with that bandit/pastor didn't have a holotape only a couple notes but needed one
---
Been grinding the Patrol Duty for 2 weeks to get the handmade plans -- no dice
---
I know Anti-Armor only applies for ballistic damage, and therefore doesn't work for energy weapons. This may also apply to explosive damage, but I'm not sure, will try and look into it
---
Had the best four days playing since I started, went from Lvl 69 to 89 and got a couple of good 3 star legendaries. Went through 5000 rounds of 5.56 and used up all my lead. Killed 2 sheepsquatch, 2 mirelurk queens  and 5 scorch beasts. Can't wait for it to happen again.
---
I've only attempted it twice. The first time it was me (a level 30) and my partner (a level 135) and a bunch of randoms (ranging from level 70-110) who helped us fight the imposter. We managed to take it down in time.
---
The second time, it was me, my partner and a bunch of randoms (levels 60-120) who stood there and did nothing. We lost horrifically.
---
The Encryptid event is not something for 1 person to do alone - especially at level 42. My partner can't solo it at level 135. You really need a decent team or a good bunch of randoms who actually help.
---
I still get two shot.  I can face tank 3 scorch beasts, a mirelurk queen, whatever have you.  I end up with like 30%health from one hit, so it's just a matter of luck avoiding another hit for a couple of seconds.
---
I've 'found' it with the camera, didn't make any difference, the corpse was gone or below the ground.
---
I *have* found it invisible when it wasn't sunken, just invisible, by determination (and knowing roughly where it died).  You can still see the distortion from the invis effect if you are close enough.  I suppose if you didn't know where the thing died, the camera might help you find it.  But it's no guarantee.
---
No one here has seen a mutant hound?? The green four-legged beast that roars as soon as you get near a super mutant camp? Nani?
---
all i want is that the workshop pvp is confined to the workshop...
---
Drop traveling pharmacy too
---
If ur on Xbox, I‚Äôve made tons of alcohol that I‚Äôll gladly sell ya, whenever you need a fix :)
---
Wait, what? You can‚Äôt do that already? So it spawns you somewhere else?
---
&gt; I effectively had to use a much newer console.
---
By "newer console" you mean xbox one x?  xbox one s?
---
Yeah. It's right next to the Berkeley Springs fast travel point. Although, according to some data mining he may actually have multiple locations.
---
Google it then.
---
That's my current set up.
---
I support this idea
---
I got credit when it hovered just above the ground while it dropped the pod, but yeah, your way sounds easier.
---
You can!  A friend of mine thought of this when I couldn't find the body, we found it with the camera.
---
"I should buy a boat..."
---
Xbox one S.
---
The mustard gas?  Yeah, I herd they don't like that.

So google is going to tell me how you feel about that game? Got it. As I said, I get I can google the fundamental changes, but that tells me nothing about what the players think.

I admire your honor.

As soon these people entering the area they should get a message like ''Watch out you are entering a workshop area that is claimed by X. Proceed with Caution!''
---
Did you look around for it - the camera tells you the general direction.  Just swing camera until its out of view, then in view, and you know which exact direction to look for the body.  Slowly move forward in that direction with the camera till it disappears from the camera, move back again, and the body should be just right in front of you.
---
It‚Äôs not a bug, just laziness and convenience for the dev. Instead of four or five different custom mesh they make only one and call it a day.
---
Your specific question was what has changed about the game.
---
Often times I‚Äôll join a defend workshop events near me for xp.  No, this isn‚Äôt a good idea.  In adventure mode I find 90% of the time people you stumble upon randomly at workshops apart from munitions factory and power plants mean no harm.
---
I see both sides of this.  A helmet protects the most important part of your body and should offer some serious DR considering it may be stopping a bullet from hitting your face.  It SHOULD help save your life because that is the sole purpose of helmets in real life. 
---
On the other hand, I dont really feel like I need more damage mitigation or life saving stuff.  I so rarely die in this game, and when I do, its usually because I did something stupid like forget to swap perk cards back after crafting or head to SBQ without stimpacks.   I dont even run any damage mitigation prefix/suffix armor, just a full set of combat armor and some perk points.
---
Cosmetics...
---
If I can wear a bathing suit over a full set of combat armor without seeing any of the combat armor, I dont see why I couldnt wear a bowler over a combat helmet the same way.
---
IF someone don't want to destroy anything in my camp, why would I tread him as uninvited guest? My camp is open to anyone who like to use it, everyone are welcome to come by anytime unless they want to destroy anything. I don't claim workshops (only if it's a challenge - then I claim and immediately switch server), so I see no reason to do anything PVP-related to CAMP defending in Adventure mode. Especially, that Bethesda already claim they plan to make camps indestructible (by other players) in Adventure mode.
---
Are those Brahmin lvl 25? Welcome to the free range event man, new real sheepsquath
---
Ohhh damn. üòí
---
I grab them to eat for a charisma boost before using vendors..
---
or replace the model with whatever cosmetic you equip.  Much like wearing a fancy dress over marine armor.
---
I didnt noticed their levels.  But its possible
---
Roses quest will send you places a L25 should probably not go.
---
Might be best to take your time with that one.  That is, leave it active, but don't do the parts on the Far side of the map quite yet.
---
From what I understand, the reward is level based, so the close you are to L50, the better the reward.
---
Personally, I've had Roses quests since I Was about L32....now I'm L72, and just recently completed all the taskings...now I just need to get back to Rose to report...
---
Your site Rocks!
---
  
---
How altruistic of you, protecting people from themselves.
---
Dick.
---
As I understand it the main difference between the xbox one and the one s is the graphics card.
---
Or maybe your old xbox one was just overheating?  Could it be full of dust?
---
the sheepsquatch is in the game i ran into it twice at dent and sons and in the ash heap near Lewisburg.....the real one not the imposter he is a legendary cryptid with a skull head and a little bigger then a deathclaw
---
You already paid $60. You shouldnt have to go to work inside a premium game for a haircut.
---
That‚Äôs probobly what it is, unique named Brahmin in the mire region? I know the event has a spawn and runs between harpers ferry and abandoned waste dumb so I assume so man
---
You've done great work and I appreciate it so much. Thank you.
---
I'd rather they just remove PvP entirely from adventure mode.  Workshop contests summon a wave of enemies for defense, if owner is MIA and doesn't show up to defend the workshop, and the other person who initiated the contest kills the attackers (PvE) then you get ownership of the workshop.
---
This game is super ram hungry. I have 16gb and ram usage often creeps up to 13-14gb of usage. 8gb is not enough to get perfect performance unfortunately
---
Its not far from the spawn point.  Just cross the river and you'll see some ruins
---
Yeah, it's new as of the real sheepsquatch update. That's right where my camp is (was)
---
Mystery solved, it‚Äôs to do with the free ranged event
---
Destructible buildings and environments are like the holy grail of gaming. It's definitely not going to happen in this game.
---
I spent what felt like 10 minutes camera-scanning the area (was probably closer to 5), and did exactly like you said.  I pinpointed a pretty small range but wasn't able to find a lootable corpse.
---
The invis shimmer is pretty easy to see (at least I think it is) if you're in the general vicinity - I was able to find one that was pretty hidden by terrain/foliage, but one that I couldn't find was in a pretty clear area (just south of the shack).
---
I played a game that had mechanics similar to what you‚Äôre referring to.  It is a super cool game mechanic but sadly it would require a ton of redesign and possibly an entirely new game engine to run those type of physx in FO76.
---
TIL there are Behemoths
---
Im just surprised they don‚Äôt charge atoms for these obvious loot boxes
---
Also the sights on the handmade. Every other time I zoom in it's a brown opaque scope that fills the whole screen.
---
Just another bugthesda special I suppose - another one of many problems.  I'm so done with having 3* legendary kills drop 1* wood armor pieces too.
---
I feel like that‚Äôs how it already is for me. I run into level 68 super mutants all the time, the occasional level 30 and the rare level 10-15‚Äôs but most of the time I‚Äôm fighting level 50+ enemies all the time already.
---
Sadly, these items were most likely sold on accident due to the selling glitch that‚Äôs been unpatched for about a month.  You think you sold a 1* item, the 1* item actually leaves your inventory but when you logout the other item/s have been sold and there‚Äôs absolutely no way to get them back.
---
XBOX, join on your "recent players" tab in your account profile.
---
No animation change would be needed. Just a change of the position of the sight on the model :)
---
Yeah so basically it just completely freezes and I have to close the software and it does it every time I play.
---
food for thought - if you claim the workshop- its [yours.no](https://yours.no) one can steal,destroy or pvp.
---
same for your camp.
---
should you leave said workshop (like an event area) then you give up the workshop as if you've logged off.
---
take pvp out of adventure mode [entirly.No](https://entirly.No) attack,no fight back,cannot steal,cannot destroy. let those wishing to play fallout do, just that.
---
survival mode - different story. those logging on, do so by their own choice and volition,give up their rights (nearly),in the full knowlege of what they might expect.
---
(camps at whitesprings may be an exception for being a pain in the ass)
---
Whitesprings was [exceptionally good](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1qtrJVYcwz60aokD5QenY6lhMpHgiIyYQQGq_XgKtJz0/edit#gid=947439519) in terms of legendary enemy count this weekend. Solo, no group and no other players around. In terms of desired loot, I still didn't get a Ghoul Slayer's Handmade, but I'll keep farming.
---
Green house walls then?
---
Oh, I‚Äôm good on that one as well ;)
---
I had the same issue, blueprints absolutely didn't work for crops (I was hopeful).  I was able to find a small spot where I could drop plants, and managed to get a couple carrots on a rug (nothing else seemed to work, though I think you may need to server hop to clear the ghost plants before you can plant in the same spot again - experimentation needed).
---
I found that the roof I made (out of wood flooring) wouldn't take the rug though, it stayed red trying to place it.  But I was able to drop them on a wire mesh floor next to the building.  I wonder if the roof tiles might work but the floor tiles don't...again, need to experiment there.  I didn't try the blueprints there though, so...experiment #3!
---
Just a fun suggestion,I didn't really put much hope.
---
The game is much better, there has been many changes to the game, there has been additional content added, there are still bugs and issues on occasion.
---
Yeah Ive got to replenish my ammo for my gatluling gun, .50 cal and my .308 lmg.
---
Off to search for lead and steel.
---
True, i thought of that before i posted, but i just have that tiny bit of hope it will happen.
---
I don't think it does make you more susceptible to encounters, as I harvest them very often and I have only encountered the Mothman a couple of times and I have been playing since day 1.
---
If you google image search *green carbon fiber* you get an assortment of nice patterns that i think would fit with your style.
---
luckily, Bethesda just happened to have released weapon repair kits! no, its not at all suspicious our weapons started to degrade faster at the same time... not at all suspicious...
---
A respec kit would actually be a problem.
---
&gt; And they will try to get in your line of fire to trigger PvP.
---
Always keep pacifist on in adventure mode to stop dick moves like that.
---
Do you already have the traveling pharmacy perk? They don‚Äôt stack, weight reduction for anything caps at 90%
---
Cool build. Now you just have to do it 999 more times for an ample enough dataset to evaluate.
---
i agree with you, its like some shady mobile game shenanigans they are pulling, but be careful, superfans of bethesda hear you saying this they will flip their shit
---
Yes it was, I hope it doesn't stop lol
---
Oh, thx that‚Äôs the problem 
---
Didn‚Äôt know that they didn‚Äôt stack
---
You never know!!  It could happen!!!
---
its the same on Ps4 for me, I can see how mainstream people without the love for fallout make fun of the performance of the game
---
I still find it to be a mixed bag.   I had one violent night pop up, and some B/Vats sniper sat on the roof and one shot the legendary ghouls and the wendigo before they could enter the building.  While ignoring all of the regular ghouls for us suckers inside.  Didn't realize what was going on until I heard him hop down to collect his spoils and then fast travel away.
---
Whitespring at the bar, there's a bunch if you need to top off.  Watoga usually has a bunch right by the station, more throughout the area (and check the other vendor area, I think there were several in there).
---
Definitely; I didn't check and I know I've had it for a while, and it was even bought "refurbished" so there's no telling. 
---
Fallout 76 isn't the only game where I have issues on the old Xbox, but a seamless experience on the Xbox one S.
---
I debated getting into that in my initial post but then figured someone would bring it up and I'd keep the OP short. Workshops are marked on the map and if the workshop is already owned that is displayed on the map as well, so it's not a hard thing to avoid.
---
I don't think there's any issues with that personally, but I do actually play Survival mode the majority of the time so I know my mindset isn't exactly aligned with the typical Adventure mode player, hence why I wanted to gauge what other folks on here thought of the idea.
---
That all said, the current set up is heavily biased towards players seeking to contest workshops and following the caps loss on death changes in Survival mode I've seen an influx of posts on here of Adventure mode workshop owners being targeted by players who are apparently cool with ganking people but too cowardly to play in Survival.
---
Any other suggestions on how to balance the workshop owners vs. attackers dynamic or how my "defense" ability suggestion could be tweaked?
---
All they gotta do is put 24 vending machines up on Top of the World on the Mezzanine. Each player on the server would have an opportunity (if they have hard bargain 3 of course) to rent out a stall / machine. You could come back now and then and check to see if you sold anything, it could be a player hub, it would be fantastic but no.
---
I still haven't even found the camera lol
---
Me and a few of my friends found a place where our camps can be relatively close together. I can stand in one spot and see three fully built camps. The view of the fourth is obstructed by mine and the landscape
---
Man, I‚Äôm in the same boat.  It‚Äôs absolutely a bummer to be held back by a random spawn.  What is the meaning of life anymore?! I just don‚Äôt know anymore...
---
I remember the first time I found the Stash box at the Red Rocket in Flatwoods, I had recently built my first CAMP, and stashed a bunch of 10mm ammo since I didn't have a weapon to use it with yet, I then picked up a 10mm pistol in Flatwoods but only a few rounds of ammo, so my first though when I found the Stash box was Wow! I just doubled my Ammo supply! Then I realized what it was, big disappointment for sure.
---
At level 300 how many hours have you put into the game anyways? Do you not feel you've gotten your money's worth because you're running out of things to do?
---
I am already hooked like crack on it I nursed a level to get the 2nd lv of starched genes so I can keep it perm. Good bye scrounger lol
---
Wish I'd have known this yesterday!  Well, next time we get a challenge to photograph a mothman, a wendigo and a behemoth at midnight, I know where to go.
---
I'm wondering the same question. Where can I get PVP Rules? Noone really knows them. All I know is next. It is possible you can be "oneshotted" by melee, but you can never oneshot anyone as sniper (even with critical headshot made by dragon), you also need at least three shots with TSE shotgun. Starting PVP against melee is ALWAYS not worth it with ranged build. Don't forget about broken stealth boys. 
---
With CAMP destroyers I started to "save at CAMP" all my workbenches. I used to have beatifull CAMP with always opened doors, now I only have cleanwalls with turrets around garden and waterfacility. If I need to remove rads I just place nuclear reactor with ARK, after it I move it back to "save at CAMP". Reward for killing CAMP destroyer in caps is not worth the repair cost in materials.
---
I think there's a lot of Adventure mode players who would agree with you. As someone who primarily plays Survival mode, I'd have zero problems with this.
---
Yes I like this idea, it would make things a lot more interesting as there's not really much of a challenge for high level players in areas that spawn low level enemies. It would also add a lot more new places to grind for XP or legendary enemies.
---
Best suggestion would to server hop in the same place opposed to trying to go to every location on the map to find it. That's how I found it - looked up a location and just server hopped there. Didn't actually take very long at all. You can also look for people here who post that they have found the tourist as well and request an inv.
---
Yeah the unused Beckley train station, seen a few vids about it
---
Running a bloodied unyielding vats crits here.. :-)
---
I hope they plan on increasing our maximum caps, because there are going to be die hard merchants out there hitting it easily.
---
Brilliant! I've been wishing there was a single page with all of the important article links. Thanks for doing what Bethesda neglected to.
---
If they holster their weapon = no threat.  
---
If someone came into your house with a gun in hand.....you would be worried
---
Luckily I knew exactly what an "ewnder chest" was from my Minecraft days. I took about 3-4 things from my stash before I said to myself "wait, maybe my stash is shared..."
---
That was my Adventure mode experience as well, but following the caps loss on death changes in Survival mode I've seen an influx of posts on here of Adventure mode workshop owners being targeted. I made this suggestion in one or two of those posts and people seemed interested so I figured I'd make a post and to try and get more folks' thoughts on it.
---
lol
---
Did they buff the SBQ recently? Seems to be much harder now to complete this quest. A while back (maybe a month or so), someone launched a nuke and I took about 2 minutes to finish up some tasks and got the message that the SBC was dead. I was surprised by how fast she went down but I wasn‚Äôt there to see it.
---
Plus, it gives you something to look forward to one day.  Being able to instantly order any armor you want in the aftermarket to satisfy the current meta kind of defeats the point of the game, at least for me.
---
Lol yes, this was me as well. I have 4 level 50+ mules now - working on kitting them all out in gear that reduces junk, ammo, and weapon weight. They have all the weight reduction perks too. I also finally made a "buff bot" (not actually a bot, just an afk level 55) with 15 charisma so that I can provide my main with a 5 star Adrenaline card, as well as empath, and muling.
---
The HUD compass shows the Workshop location, and you can easily check a map to see if someone already owns it.
---
Probably just trying to make the game run on consoles.
---
Yea maybe ill give that a try, I really hate server hopping.
---
What spot did you hop?
---
Thanks for the info, I try to get as much detail as possible before I try to replicate!   
---
will document and report.
---
ya know... I hear they have a mode just for you.
---
Yeah I tried to redo the roads in sanctuary with marble and it killed my game.
---
I used to as well but at some point with all the crashes and what not I just embraced it in order to get rare plans/clothes and things like this. It‚Äôs frustrating that we have to do so but idk.
---
I don't build a wall on the rear and leave much of the sides open so I have a great view. I pick a spot that allows the front wall to cut off access to the whole site by virtue of the cliffs it is built on. It is basically a triangular lot with cliff edge creating two sides of the triangle...the front wall cuts off the third leg of triangle and access to the interior.
---
I never thought about the caps changes, and you could be right!  Especially since I don‚Äôt take as many workshops lately.  No plans to farm anymore, full up in mats, etc.  I usually ft to the workshops to join the defend events.  Now you have me thinking....
---
This can happen, but it is wildly inconsistent (unlike the loading screen tip that says you can learn the plans for anything you scrap).  One particularly cruel example, imo, is that you can't learn Responder gear through scrapping it, even though there's a Daily Challenge to do that, and a few Responder things are normally irreplaceable.
---
Yep üëçüèª ^^^^^^THIS^^^^^^
---
Man have you ever used the Cryolator, it's as weak as a paintball gun and breaks within a 2 minutes of using it Lol.
---
You want the plan for the helmet, or the plan for BoS paint?  Scrapping *any* Combat Armor offers a chance to get the BoS paint for the helmet, not just helmets.
---
What the hell...?    
---
The checker board is especially odd, I assume it's not happening every time?
---
That's actually how it currently works in Survival. Given the Adventure mode crowd is generally much less interested in PvP, I think it'd be better to make the "defend" option something the workshop owner has to activate.
---
As for camps, I think that might be too easily abused given their mobile nature (for example, a player could drop their camp next to another unsuspecting player and immediately attack). That plus the fact that Bethesda is working on making camps immune to player damage in Adventure mode is why I didn't include it in my post.
---
If you're a hoarder then Speed Demon helps immensely
---
No, it isn't tech restricted, it is poor optimization on the server software they run. There have been many many other online games that have much larger and more open building than this game and they have much higher player counts. Star Wars Galaxies had player built homes in the main world not instanced, and they had entire suburbs of player housing right on the main map. This was back in 03, so nearly 20 years ago.
---
The only reason they can't do it is because of the piss poor coding, not a tech issue.
---
Great idea. I want the whole map to be relevant to me not just the eastern portion of it.
---
Yass I went from like 316 to 329 heh heh. Good times! I love getting so much XP from ghouls at WS just like the olden days
---
Agree, there are still some of those players. Sad to say, luckily they are in the minority.
---
Yeah, I played a ton over the weekend for double xp, but I've decided to be zen about the camera. If it's meant to be, I'll get it when it spawns, otherwise I will make peace with the idea that I may never experience that piece of content. I keep checking spawn locations when I'm nearby.   
---
Imagine how obscure it will be for non-hardcore players who don't even have confirmation of the places to look!
---
Responder HQ!!
---
I was thinking about something similar. How they could make a second adventure mode we unlock after completing Overseer's Mission quest once we're able to.
---
This would be something like a second season to the game, allowing them to change the current in-game locations, introducing a new story to it, add new and stronger mobs to those locations, 4 &amp; 5 star legendaries. Hell, even make some factions/NPCs come/return to the Appalachia.
---
Imagine coming back to Flatwoods, seeing a group of NPCs cleaning the streets, rebuilding the church/houses. Few of them patrolling the streets, taking care of any hostiles coming their way. They would call themselves the New Responders, doing what those before them have failed. BoS reclaimed the asylum, few guards outside fighting of an occasional wave of mutties. You get the point. There's a lot of potential.
---
Not really. Having bloodied builds in the group can make the fight seem too easy, now and back then too. She still has 32k health and 300 resistances, plus the damage mitigation that reduces all incoming damage to 30%. This fight, none of us was bloodied.
---
So in one sense, having more people is now easier as there is no scaling anymore. In another sense, 1-3 non bloodied people are probably impossible, unless she glitches.
---
I'm actually specifically talking about workshops, not camps. I don't think a "defense" option would be good for camps given their mobile nature (for example, a player could drop their camp next to another unsuspecting player and immediately attack) and the fact that Bethesda is working on making camps immune to player damage in Adventure mode.
---
Probably because that build literally can't do anything but 1 shot things. The entire build is as much damage as possible on first shot.
---
I've seen this issue several time lately.
---
Luck of the draw man. I see lovely SBQ fights all the time. Especially now that energy weapons don't break as fast, the fight is ON like Donkey Kong. But yeah people are nuking HF just as much as WS now
---
You‚Äôre perms flagged pvp when taking ownership of a workshop for the remainder of your session on that server.
---
I remember one of the most epic SBQ battles I was in happened when, midway through, the "This server is going down for maintenance in 5 minutes" came up.  We didn't manage to kill her in that time, but holy crap there was so much going on.  And no one left.  Everyone attacked until they couldn't attack anymore.  It was pretty glorious.
---
That would be awesome. It would be great if we could start to rebuild Appalachia. I doubt it's happening, but I'd be happy to be wrong.
---
Indestructible C.A.M.P will lead to allowing people to block certain areas of the map and make it inaccessible.
---
I say that destruction should be allowed, but rebuild cost to the player should be free.
---
&gt;  but some extra players can get on by grouping in the main menu.
---
This explains why I can be suddenly disconnected from a server for no reason ... and no one else is. Some team formed in main menu and when they load in, I get kicked. Or someone does
---
I server hopped at wavy Willard‚Äôs. It spawns beside the only car facing forward towards the park.
---
I think the opposite would be better. Level 1-50 server. Then they could scale some of the harder locations a little better. Whitesrpings is always filled with high level ghouls despite it being a level 20-40 place for most people. Becasue it's farmed by high level, the enemies reflect that. It's be nice to check out whitesprings and actually have a chance to explore the place wihtout being destroyed when I make a new character...
---
Only took like 3 or 4 servers. I just server hop while doing something irl so it‚Äôs not as boring
---
I've seen players do Wavy Willards
---
I‚Äôve never had a bounty persist through server hop, that‚Äôs crazy!
---
They could still be used that way sort of. Find a spacious one, build a town with your buddies, then blueprint everything before logging out. Defense events could get intense. üôÇ
---
I'm so dumb!  I was going to start a alt and instead leveled up my main from around 88 to 97.  I could probably have gotten a alt up from nothing to 20 in the same amount of time.  
---
Oh well...no alt for me for a while.
---
I'd be fine with removing PvP entirely from Adventure mode honestly because I primarily play Survival mode. I've also seen some great suggestions of making workshop contesting in Adventure mode something other than PvP or allowing workshop owners the option to simply relinquish ownership rather than fight.
---
As for Whitesprings camps, Bethesda really should just make it so you can't build so close to the back of the golf club.
---
Well then this hunt will take me a long time thanks for giving me a hint of the future
---
this
---
Were you on the Survival Server? if so someone may have placed a bounty on you.
---
Sounds right. I did a fight yesterday and it took us almost the entire time to take her down but I did notice the most damage was when she was on the ground and some melee fighters were attacking her.
---
Even after the workshop is no longer yours?
---
This.  The only bad thing is then you need to find enough acid to smelt it all.  Also make sure you have Super Duper equipped when you do it.
---
I was talking about Helmet Plan, not BoS paintjob for the helmet.
---
I have been noticing this too, ever since the repair kits were release my reg armor has been needing repairs at least two times in about 4 hours of playing and 3 hrs Is just farming / vendor hopping. That‚Äôs with a maxed out white knight. Prior to patch if I repaired individual pieces once in a couple of days that was a lot.
---
Yes.  If you take ownership of a workshop you have essentially consented to pvp.
---
I just ran into him yesterday. The fight wasn't as hard as the imposter and her did less damage than a Colonel Gutsy but had more health. Terrible drops though.
---
Would be cool if there could be a community. Doubt a old ass console could handle it. Still tho, could get some pretty cool events together or something. Close as it could get to a community.
---
Yes but its also as easy to miss when youre just looking around and exploring but i get your point
---
There should be no PvP on Adventure servers. Stop trying to re-invent the wheel, PvE and PvP servers please.
---
I have fought off quiet a few people while having it, I was just trying to kill some trolls... I am ok with a smaller bounty but it glitched so high up its annoying.
---
quest - help defend blah blah blah. weapons out and firing- no hostile intentions towards workshop + all
---
workshops are essentially,public places. ie power up power plant, except someone has the workshop ?
---
Oh, get a team mate? Just get a team mate? Why don't I strap on my Team mate helmet and squeeze on down into a team mate cannon and fire off into team mate land, where team mates grow on team maties?
---
What are the good trading subs? I had a player drop me about a dozen legendaries last night.....I'm too overencumbered in power armor, and my stash is full.
---
I mean, level 1 synths are probably around at this point.  Maybe?
---
I just use the built in crosshair my monitor lets me put on the screen in the options for the guns with screwed up crosshairs. Might want to check if your monitor also has it. Mine is the acer 34" gaming 3440x1440 ultrawide monitor they came out with like 3 or 4 years ago.
---
Workshops are a mess right now with the pvp mechanics.
---
I think the owner should be notified of a defend event if a rival tries taking it. Give them like 2 minutes to arrive. 
---
The workshop can only be contested by being in the workshop zone.
---
No more team kills across the map.
---
Owner should be able to relinquish the workshop at anytime by opening the map and clicking on the location.
---
Workshops can only be contested once every 30 minutes by a rival or rivals team.
---
Excavator is barely over 50% of what ultracite and x-01's offer. It's pretty significant.
---
I'd suggest getting a friend to kill you then trading the caps back, that's what I do with Golf Club turret camps.
---
Launched a nuke with my friend yesterday and this is exactly what happened, but everyone was acting this way not just one person. Ended up leaving the server cause enemies wouldn't spawn as everyone was camping the spawn points.
---
There is a guaranteed spawn at whitesprings, in the park to the right 200ft of the pavilion. Where the deathclaw sometimes spawns.
---
Thank goodness, tired of see trading posts.
---
Oh ok. So I can just shoot anyone who owns a workshop? Or do I have to contest their workshop first? I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôll grind workshops as much anymore. I don‚Äôt feel like their worth the hassle of getting griefed.
---
10 of 10 would do again!  The Sheepsquatch ride was awesome üëè üëè
---
May want to check if your monitor has the ability to add in a crosshair to itself. Mine has the option to use like 5 different crosshairs in the menus of the monitor. If your monitor is an Acer, you may want to check and see if your's can do it too.
---
I climbed the mountain near it and the walked along the top of the monorail to see where it went.  Then when I got there I was all proud of myself until I realized you could just take a elevator up and down.  :smh:
---
I think she's easier now, if anything, as long as she cooperates and comes down once in a while.  There are times when her AI seems to get stuck doing the same action, and if that action is "hover-in-place for 5 minutes barely within VATS," well, that can be a problem.
---
Likewise, I find I have serious problems with her wing sweep attack these days.  Sometimes, I'm dead in one hit.  Other times it does nothing.  The part that gets me is that Blocker seems to make zero difference, so either that attack does so much damage it is instant-kill even with Blocker 3 (like the Imposter Sheepsquatch's melee) or it's something beyond the scope of Blocker.
---
They are flagged and you can openly attack them anywhere they go on the map.
---
was it supposed to be only the weekend ? i've had double xp for more than a week ?
---
and the sheep are exceedingly unfriendly
---
Yeah...it would be hard to work the finer details. I think joining events prevents PVP until the end of the event (at least it does in Survival mode) but I get your point.
---
Yep I‚Äôm on ps4 and it disappears completely once dead
---
I'd love this feature, but I'm wondering why there isn't one.  
---
Perhaps they scrapped it because the vendor shares inventory between players. Imagine selling something and then someone else buying it and then trying to buy it back, but you can't because someone else bought it!  
---
It's not to say they couldn't make it work, but there would have to be some extra considerations in the shared inventory environment.
---
Thanks for the info!
---
OMG yes I would totally pay for respec kits! Tired of grinding lvls just to change builds.
---
Sometimes you have to take a moment and enjoy the finer things in life!  üëçüèªüëçüèª
---
Go to Bolton greens and just server hop, the body of the tourist is in the fountain in front of the building
---
Camps should be no-PVP zones and all things inside indestructible (Adventure mode), workshop should stay as it is, workshops are generally useless anyway (in my opinion).
---
Absolutely!
---
Two days ago we killed her with just three, (four at the most) people before the clock ran out and I still don't know how the hell we did it.  My friend is running a blooded build of some kind. I'm power armor/ heavy weapons and I had an anti- armor .50 cal and an executioner's mini-gun which I broke out when she was down to 40 percent health.  My friend and I are over 100 and there was a level 61 guy there who was a melee build. As far as I know we were the only ones.   Was only two minutes left on the clock but we pulled it off.  But oh man it was way more expensive.  I spent the next day doing nothing except farm ammo.  I didn't realize that player count doesn't scale her anymore.
---
Yeah, or buy something fro. Them for all my caps then just go on a camp rampage.
---
I server hopped at the palace, there at least you can hit three relatively close locations with one hop.
---
Is this an item that will get you banned if you get one? I'm on PC and have never seen anyone wearing it, but would love to have one. It has armor rating right?
---
No adventure, I am more PVE then PVP player. Mostly
---
Went from 36 to 83! It was sick, picked up a bunch of Grognak Axe‚Äôs too!
---
this would be great, having to farm the same 6 areas during double xp weekend showed that once you're past 50 you only play within one area of the map
---
Server hop at Wavy Willard's, that's how I got mine.
---
Long time ago, I went face to face as I could tank her with a Vampiric weapon. It was necessary as she was very likely take off if nobody was in melee range to her. Now, I usually stay outside her reach (which is like 20 meters!) or very-very close as she somehow misses. Often though, not sure why (Tormentor 3?), she just stands there and does nothing. That's when I shoot her in the face.
---
this is the type of feedback that is important to the game, good balancing seems to be lost on the devs now
---
i mean, a missle launcher should be very very powerful
---
as it is, they are useless
---
I played it several times in my low 40s, high 40s, and 50s. 
---
In the low 40s, it was all I could do to just sprinting around spamming stimpacks/colas and trying to be a conduit for a pylon. The Gutsy's murdered me if I stood still for longer than 2 seconds. 
---
In my 50s I was able to stand toe to toe with the gutsy's while being a pylon conduit, and got some fairly useless shots on the SS too, but I like to think it helped. 
---
As long as you can survive and be a pylon, you are helping the other people in the event. Low 40s is a minimum in my experience, but it'll cost you a lot of supplies. 50's is very reasonable.
---
Yes, I have the same problem
---
One thing I've noticed that seems to help for me is bringing the Endangerol Syringer.  Before I go in with whatever Bloodied weapon I have, I shoot her with one of those darts.  It lowers her resistance by 25%, which at 300, is nothing to scoff at.  Definitely some correlation between the damage I'm doing with it versus without it.  If I dart her, every hit I do is noticeably reflected in the health bar.
---
All great ideas! Now you have me thinking maybe adding a buffer period between when a player initiates an attack on a workshop and when PvP kicks in would be a better solution, that way workshop owners wouldn't be able to murder innocent/friendly visitors.
---
Me too! The perk card system needs a serious overhall but odds are they just new perks or perks unlockable once you become legendary.
---
not so,  i've joined event,not knowing the workshop was even there, and ended up wanted for hiting a spike trap. bummer (adventure mode)
---
It's not really functional. When you "aim" with it, it's way off to the side.
---
Was able to level 10 times on my alternate (45-55) !
---
I killed 2 sheepsquatches, once alone near the Federal Disposal Field HZ-21 and one at the Aaronholt Homestead (during the brahmin herding event)
---
Is that the main place it spawns then as I have been server hoping for 2 hours at  wavy willards, PH cemetery and Cnl Kelly monument.
---
I haven't experienced this,  but I run with perks on that help and change them out when repairing and crafting.
---
Must not be playing much survival if you think people aren't buying them.
---
Been server hopping for about the same amount of time on Xbox one today. Still had no luck either.
---
Good luck on your search dude!!
---
Best I can do is...
---
37 to 55. Double xp made me pick the game back up and I‚Äôm not stopping after. Good tactic.
---
Sure ill be on at 4p.m. gmt, ill msg you
---
Now I learn this after selling me Explosive tesla Rifle
---
Yeah it was helpful, i got 20 levels and managed to get auto pistol and heavy gun perks for the first time
---
I like to PvP in Adventure. Don't really care about the caps, only loot bags if you get salty in area and would never destroy a person's CAMP. I'm in it for the thrill of the kill.
---
Couple things you can do to gain the advantage: create a kill zone with turrets, LOS your opponent, get height on the workshop (marsupial,)  block points of entry, get a stealth mod for your PA (VATS can't lock on to a stealthed target,) consider using another weapon for workshop defense, have a separate perk deck for PvP, and finally consider armor that mitigates player damage.
---
Hope we bump into each other ;)
---
You too bud
---
I read that it has been data-mined that the queen has a static HP, not based on the number of participants.  
---
No real experience to back that up personally, but the people doing the data mining have a pretty good track record of getting things right.
---
"Valley"
---
My peeps took my level 2 alt through the burrows once and I hit level 16 just doing that! Lots of fun!
---
The Excavator's rad protection is quite good. By the numbers, for rad protection: 
---
1. X-01 @513
---
2. T-60 @475
---
3. Ultricite @453
---
4. **Excavator @426**
---
5. T-45 @420
---
6. Raider @401
---
7. T-51b @370
---
Yes, the excavator was designed for mining ore... including uranium ore. My guess is that the OP is still using level 25 Excavator parts and might benefit from rebuilding level 45 components.
---
You talk about taking chem fiend and how that can negate the effects of certain chems. What do you mean?
---
Is there any possibility of this becoming an app at all?
---
Ya, the 2 minutes gives friendlies a chance to get away as well.
---
Another issue is the resources at workshops. They are hardly worth the trouble.  We need more spots like the ammo factory. Imagine making:
---
-ballistic fiber
---
-canned food
---
-nuka cola products 
---
-screws, springs, gears
---
-alcohol brewery
---
-etc
---
These types of shops would be worth fighting for and defending.
---
case in point about an 1hr up the posts
---
makes sense, thanks for your time, i will change it to low and that should do even though it will look like crap. welp, i have my eyes on a nice 2060 so that should fix it for good
---
I counted it. Yesterday I played 8hrs straight (Sunday freedom and Boredom) and I crashed 13 times
---
That‚Äôs more than once an hour. I‚Äôm talking walk into buildings and load screen stops working, randomly walking around then everything shuts off and I‚Äôm on Xbox dashboard, fighting SBQ and everything freezes. Every type of crash. At this point I feel like the developers seriously don‚Äôt care about having their game actually work.
---
That‚Äôs one of the many places the camera can spawn. I found it there because it is easy to access.
---
Honestly, as useful as this site is, I wouldn't mind some non-intrusive, mobile-friendly advertising on the page if it helps you keep this site up and sustainable long-term. 
---
Regarding the map, are you pulling coordinates out of the files directly or just manually adding locations?
---
I like it.  Far too much of the map is set at a low level, in turn it makes the 'actual playable map' (ie. a map with any real challenge) too small. It's a shame because there are some cool areas that are really mundane due to their level.
---
I was thinking about this yesterday (I hit level 50), but I disagree with the implementation.
---
I think it would be nice to have the servers zoned 1-99, 100-199, 200+ and you have to meet the level minimum in order to join a level-locked server (you can always join low level servers any time).
---
With this, I feel like enemeis should (obviously) spawn at higher levels, with the minimum spawn being the minimum level req for the server, and we see a hell of a lot more legendary creatures and boss enemies, and more/different resistances. In exchange, loot and exp is scaled to match. Maybe even give some enemies better weapons - I think someone below mentioned Mr. Handy with a fat man. Also, starting at a certain level - say 150 - enemies are always boss level and at something like 190, enemies are all legendaries.
---
Let's take this one step farther, and make it a New Game+ of sorts. All quests are reset to incomplete, and you can finish them all over again. Also, maybe make some new mods, plans, and even perk cards that are only accessible in these higher level servers...but nothing game breaking. Take the weight reduction cards for example; in one of the "prestige servers" weight reduction cards are now only worth one star, but they give the benefit of the the 3 star card from the normal server.  Also, some rarer resources are easier to find.
---
I think it would make the game a lot more challenging, without making the enemies bullet sponges and allowing the player to adjust their character accordingly (i.e. with the perk card system).
---
I would bet that a very high percentage of the time that you get dropped from a server it‚Äôs because the server itself died, so here‚Äôs nothing to reconnect to.
---
If they changed it recently and SBQ has the same amount of health no matter how many players do the event, it's ok to have leechers if they don't interfere with the fight.
---
If the servers were properly coded, that shouldn't hurt stability at all. Look at all the other online games, even those from almost 20 years ago, they had building and the ability to display items, Hell SWG had player towns full of player built and decorated houses, and they weren't even instanced and the servers could handle thousands of players.
---
Especially handy for gathering extra lead ore for making ammo.
---
[](/celestiablink)There's a level 10 Grafton Monster I've been farming whenever I need fuel. You can find it next to Charleston Station if you follow the tracks and jump into the ditch next to Poseidon energy plant.  
---
It's still not great, but until they make it feasible to craft otherwise it's a good option.
---
As I said elsewhere, this shouldn't be an issue at all. The only reason it is is due to poor coding on bethesdas part.
---

What about cranberry relishhhhhhh. Don‚Äôt forget the relishhhhhh
---
[It depends.](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1qtrJVYcwz60aokD5QenY6lhMpHgiIyYQQGq_XgKtJz0/edit#gid=197047020) Whitesprings is good for the sheer amount of loot. Events could be good as well but rare. West Tek, Harper's Ferry and The Burrows take too much attention right now so you may end up with no respawns or enemies spawned for a previous player.
---
Yeah, I tend to rock up with a fat man and about 15 - 20 mini-nukes and just remove all the chaff mobs from the face of the earth.
---
I went from 32 to 50 myself. Congrats, and hoping it comes again as well.
---
On the PS4 I went from level 64 and a half to just over level 65!  Days Gone made certain of that.
---
Also i have found that a few times I am put back on the same server i just left.
---
Awesomely timed shot! Hope you got them out all ok though...
---
They moved the weapon bench a couple of patches ago, supposedly because the camera used to clip through the wall when using it. I haven't noticed other changes to Flatwoods besides that.
---
Why even take the time to design something and put it into the game if you're just going to design it's usefulness to zero and have it never be used? I don't get it.
---
With no perks, plans for motion assist servo's  are 480 caps @ whitespings.
---
hard bargain 3 and a grape mentats significantly lowers the cost.
---
targeting hud was 4 digits, but I dont recall how many.
---
Yeah, I was ambushed by a level 80+ legendary sheapsquatch, I managed to kill it but holy crap he took a while to go down
---
Agreed on camps, I wouldn't make the "defense" option available for camps because that would just be ripe for abuse. But for workshops, owners are currently at a huge disadvantage to attackers, so I think something needs to be implemented or changed to balance that out. I get that you may not care because you think workshops are useless, but there are plenty of people who don't feel that way and would love for contesting to be more balanced.
---
The great thing about this game, in my opinion, is there are so many different ways to play it, especially when you're ok with not being the most optimized/efficient build possible (something I've personally always found to be boring in Bethesda games because of how low difficulty is). I loved taking workshops in Adventure mode (when it was the only mode available) and still do in Survival as well so I can build up all the resource collectors and leave them unlocked for my fellow vault dwellers :)
---
Yeah, poor sheepy... It got a pretty bad case of the rads... =]]]]

This is a list of links to comments made by Bethesda employees in this thread:

---
Wrong, if you are talking about hack and slashes and such, then look at diablo 2, had respeccing, borderlands had respeccing, PoE lets you respec anytime they change ANY skill. So if you are going to use POE as an example, then you should be pushing for respecs as well, because POE gives out respecs any time they change a skill. So when bethesda nerfed the hell out of white knight everyone should have gotten the option to respec.
---
So if bethesda followed POE's system I doubt most people would have a problem with it due to having had the option to respec pretty much every patch.
---
Wait why we're they letting more people on servers? Isn't the cap 24?
---
Hopefully, if Bethesda is that kind
---
Fired a mini nuke once. Had the high ground looking down at a couple of radtoads, so I knew if the nuke didn't work out it'd be an easy fight even if I aggroed all of them. I just wanted to test how the trajectory worked and see what kind of blast radius it had.
---
Nuke hit the end of the launcher I guess, because it just blew up in my hands. No damage to the toads whatsoever, instakilled myself. Scrapped the fatman and put all the mini nukes on the ground. WTF.
---
Yeah, at least we have the picture... ah, the memories... =]]]
---
Pulling spawn locations from the files. Getting the scaling right for that was a PITA. Its still not perfect but its nearly there. Its got most items and flora (corn, gourds, etc) right now. Even the radstag corpses that spawn in raider camps hanging up are on there.
---
Thank you for the explanation .. I didn't know this. I claimed an unowned workshop and got PK'd. After respawning I ran back to see if I could possibly retrieve the stuff from my corpse, and was promptly killed again by the same guy.
---
I voted yes for service, but I would prefer that only free service post be allowed here.
---
Gained like 5 levels, playing casually. Managed to get my build sorted out!
---
To find mine, I just kept /r/Market76 sub open on my phone and just searched for 'ansel' or 'tourist' every so often while I played and sort by new. People post on there when they've found him so you can friend them and join.
---
That's a Thanos quote lol üòÇ
---
Yeah there are a few different "Combat Helmets"  The Combat Helmet which they are talking about, army helmet and the marine helmet.
---
Maybe one day, though ive never done an app before.
---
yup same on PS4
---
sometimes its a disco floor with multi colored tiles
---
also simply running to fast into new areas makes the whole game seem to be unable to render things fast enough
---
I‚Äôm in a good size group who farms it regularly, seem to disappear more often for the person who initiated the recall. Which make buying that keycard even more of a pain. Ps4 btw.
---
That‚Äôs on console right? Never saw something this social on pc
---
Or they could just allow you to respec in the game like every other online game that has skills and stats you place yourself. Hell diablo 2 had it over 20 years ago. No reason for them to not have it in this game, except for the fact they probably don't know how to code it in, even though modders added it to fo4 years ago.
---
One does not simply finds the camera.
---
The camera finds you if it wants to be found.
---
Have you seen the trading sub reddit? It has hundreds of post a day.
---
I use an explosive lever Action a lot that has the faster Crit perk, so every 3rd shot I can use a Crit, and it definitely make a difference, Level 68 SuperMutants and Ghouls take 2 shots normal, or 1 with a Crit.
---
I would love to see workshops buffed as well. Given how Bethesda has tried to nudge people towards giving PvP a shot (some examples include making taking a specific workshop a weekly atoms challenge, doing the first bonus xp weekend in Survival only, adding the legendary weapon challenges in Survival mode), you'd think that buffing the resources gained by holding a workshop would be a no brainer.
---
Looks amazing, please don't sign into survival with this camp, people will straight up trash this work of art :c
---
The physics engine is the constraint, and detail. Not purely graphics. The physics means a whole lot more then people think.
---
Exactly.  It would make the rarer items and resources easier to get. In a way. Especially if you team up to conquer and defend.
---
Perk loadout manager lets you make "perk card decks" you can swap out with a single button in the perk menu. So you can swap off all your damage perks, and put on the crafting perks quickly without having to manually go through all of your cards just to find power patcher 3 or master science.
---
I've been a fan of fallout since the first one released.   76 is the only one i feel no satisfaction in time played,  i do feel gyped.  Unlike previous fallouts, in 76 you could play for 1000 hours and not get the outfit or gun/armor you want.  I feel the 'you played X-hours so you got your moneys worth' is a stale argument for a game that is incomplete,  drags out teased content and then the content is still buggy as hell (there is still bugs in the game from launch) .  People are in fact spending money on atoms, i did and regret it.   We will never get value for the money spent.
---
Yeah it was really fun, lvled up an alt pretty well and killed the Sheepsquatch at least 6 times.
---
It does eventually show up as a meat/melted robot pile if you wait. Saw this happen a few times.
---
ROFL, combine this with perk load out manager and you could literally change your build from a melee build to vats rifle in 2 clicks on the fly. That would be P2W as all hell.
---
Part of the performance enhancements if I had to guess.  Less stuff to render, better frame rate?
---
Thanks, but i am running with the .50 right now.
---
Have a steady level of 10 000 that i constantly keep topping up after every nuke.
---
no no it doesnt
---
stop spreading misinformation
---
but, feel free to prove me wrong, make a video of your handmade increasing in damage when repairing it
---
then we'll talk
---
Dude, this is the best photo I have seen!! Excellent job!!
---
Thanks for warning me about the future... the future is depressing because I need to get it for two weapons and the combat rifle will be much harder than the pipe revolver...
---
How is the ability to change your build from a melee build to a vats crit rifle build with 2 button presses not p2w?!?
---
I just encountered a guy at the Leader of the Pack event.  Running toward the first wolf, I get the message that it died, the second one a few seconds later. Fast travel to the third, pop out at about 60 meters out and start sprinting, just catch a glimpse of a guy in power armor punch the last wolf and vanish. The horde boss died within a few seconds of it spawning, even though it wasn't near a fast travel spot.  Seems silly to cheat on a level 10 event.
---
Almost like you're...rebuilding? :)
---
This bug has been a problem for me with this event since it came out on xbox. The sloth at the end of the parade did the same thing.
---
Upon reaching level 30 I got Starched Genes in a perk pack so I maxed it out exactly at level 30 so I can use mutations. Pretty lucky!
---
Do you mean 500 hours of just grinding for it or other things included...
---
Let me know if you find it as i am starting to think that we can't get it anymore.
---
The Queen had a fixed HP pool, doesn't matter how many people show up.
---
im glad people keep posting about this, it would be a great addition to the game
---
i have a great friend who is super nice and lets me mule but that is time taken from her gaming waiting for my loading screens, so if we could have a way to do it without having to bother friends that would be great
---
If you want an architecture students conjecture on why we don't have these already, its because the walls you propose are very much a modern or post modern architectural piece, which is a more advanced style that Bethesda is probably too lazy to study and learn how to implement in a competent manner. Fallout while set in a style that was around at the height of modernism doesn't really seem to have much modernist architecture. I genuinely think that is because it would have been too time consuming to actually create them well. For perspective, sanctuary in Fallout 4 was supposed to be a new neighborhood that was inspired by the 1950's but futuristic, which means they should've been drawing inspiration from structures like this  [https://static1.squarespace.com/static/560af446e4b067a3343ac5c1/t/571d1845b654f9be4d8728c9/1461524573548/Haarkon+Modernist+Architecture+Building+Design+Bridlington+Yorkshire](https://static1.squarespace.com/static/560af446e4b067a3343ac5c1/t/571d1845b654f9be4d8728c9/1461524573548/Haarkon+Modernist+Architecture+Building+Design+Bridlington+Yorkshire) , which is a modern house from the 1950's which as you can see utilizes large glass walls/windows. I think Bethesda has completely forgone modernism because I'm sure that would've been hard to do. To be clear, I love your suggestion and the styles that would allow us to do, it's sorely needed
---
If the weapon is not compensated, try aiming at knees/waist for first shot, then do  3-4 shot bursts (instead of holding down the trigger.)
---
Have not been impressed with the larger caliber autos - as you noted, low damage.  Per shot, my hardended 308 sniper does almost 3x the damage of the 308 lmg - making the bolt action sniper faster kill than the MG.
---
Galaxies had a physics engine as well. Same with many other online games that offer player building.
---
I want my Warhawk for my gruff ex-raider!
---
Yeah would be even better
---
Yes, I've made no changes to my normal Perks, and armor is degrading about 300% faster, and even degrading when hanging out in CAMP with no combat.
---
I routinely gather Ballistic Fiber from several sources, and had around 400 prior to the patch, and even occasionally sold some to other players, but since the patch I have burned though all of it and even bought 200 from other players.
---
I haven't looked into the fine print of how it works, but if I have pacifist on, my explosives won't slap damage other players, whose explosives would then damage me back, and we'd initiate pvp, right?
---
I've considered raining grenades and explosives all over, as my build would do a pretty good job of it, but I don't want to accidentally start pvp in the middle of a SS fight.
---
Clearly the SheepSquatch was having a blast. How does it feel to be a pin cushion /s
---
Yes its a be lever my build is optimized and at 19% health it does 636 damage and to the torso on a level 68 super mutant it leaves them with a little bit of health that is without tank killer. When i use a crit i dont notice an increase.
---
I also have a Bloodied +50% crit damage gauss and i test it on level 65 scorchbeasts it puts them to 20% hp with a crit and when i use the better criticals perk i get the same result... you would think an extra %40 damage would be visible on the healthbar but i think nothing changes...
---
For my perks i dont use demo expert cuz its trash now barely increases damage for 5 pts, but i use bloody mess and nerd rage and all rifleman perks giving me 636 for the BE lever and 998 for the B50 gauss
---
Edit: just tested on a 65 scorchbeast withthe b50 gauss to the torso with and without better criticals it took 2 hits to put it to about 5% health so 3 to kill
---
Edit: i think distance has alot to do with testing on scorchbeasts making it inconsistent will retry with super mutants
---
Edit : ok so crits do indeed increase damage but the increase is so minimal even with better criticals. For more consistent results i tested at point blank with level 68 mutants shots to the torso using vats
---
Hit : health bar under start of word Mutant Crit; health bar under ¬´¬†e¬†¬ª of Super
---
With better criticals crit: health under ¬´¬†P¬†¬ª of super
---
With tank killer : Hit:  under U of Super 
---
Crit: Kills
---
You can pop diluted Rad-X without suppressing mutations though.
---
Ignore that shit and have fun. Both setups are viable for different chores . That's why we can get so many cards.
---
Using no sneak and hitting the torso?
---
This is exactly how I wanted to go about it too, hopefully ill have better luck today
---
Something else that also happens is that her constant radiation actually triggers Dodgy.  When I die, there's probably some correlation with not having the AP to cover the hit, either because Dodgy depleted it, or because the server is being slow about refilling my AP.
---
I try to avoid going literally face-to-face unless she's in one of those "stands there and does nothing" states.  As long as she's skittering around, being in front of her is suicide.
---
Slap damage has been removed now, but yeah, pacifist won't do anything at all, even if they slap back, pvp won't start.
---
I stopped using White Knight some time back when it got nerfed, but even tried putting it back on, but it doesn't seem to help significantly if at all.
---
Someone told me it's a bug related to a mutation, but I don't want to have to scrub off and re-install all my mutations again to fix this.
---
2 of them, neither of which I was ready for, but I was able to cheese the first one by luring him down to that southern most firebase and shooting him from atop one of the trailers.
---
I can't remember who said it, but there was a post here a while back detailing what someone thought nuke zones should have been, in order to increase replayability.
---
Every nuke zone, or at least one nuke zone per region of the map, would spawn a "boss" creature when the nuke dropped. Think SBQ, but region liked...so a special mirelurk, maybe a special deathclaw, etc.
---
Each "nuke boss" would drop plans, legendaries, etc that you can get only from that nuke boss. I'll try to find that post and link it....but it would have been so awesome
---
A better solution would be to use the scaling system ESO uses so everyone could group and it wouldn't matter.
---
Explosive Tesla is meh, the explosions break the arc.
---
What? You couldn't sit or lie down in FO4 if enemies were nearby. What exactly are you talking about it making it through previous iterations?
---
Killed your first queen at level 100????
---
In theory it -shouldn't- work that way. OTOH, as much as I love them; Bethesda gonna Bethesda...
---
I havent been a fan of the series since the first one released, but I have been playing them for a decade now and have replayed every one released many times. 
---
I was even more dissapointed with 4 than this game because this one was never marketed as a typical Fallout game and is completely different.
---
If you played enough time to reach level 300, and dont feel satisfied with the game, that's perfectly reasonable and understandable, but there was clearly plenty of content to get you there, and to bitch that the game feels incomplete or lacking or unsatisfactory simply because you cant get the gun you want as easily as you could in other games that are structurally completely different games anyways, is sort of childish.
---
I've put nearly 100 hours into this game and I'm starting to feel like I'm running out of things to do aside from farm for better gear. However, I enjoyed that 100 hours and feel I've gotten my money's worth.
---
Why on earth would you play to level 300 on a game that you dont enjoy and felt zero satisfaction playing? You never needed to spend money on atoms either.
---
If you were playing just to hope you would feel you were getting your money's worth, all the way to level 300, you were deluding yourself from the start of a game you werent going to enjoy anyways.
---
I see your point and indeed it shouldn't be an issue but for now it is sadly. Fingers crossed they take big leaps in the future also with taking more care when implementing new stuff.
---
YES! Melee is all sorts of messed up now, you can HEAR the sound of you hitting the enemy, but it doesnt register as a hit
---
really hurts if you are running a  glass cannon build, those missed hits allow the enemies to hit you when they should have been dead
---
I‚Äôve got my own bar built up on top of Seneca Rock, affectionately named Seneca on the Rocks. But mine is no where near as impressive as builds like these.
---
Thought you wrote corned beef for a quick sec and got excited.
---
Next SS fight is going to be fun. Gonna MIRV the crap out of that place.
---
camden usually spawns under L15 scorched - only since I passed L45 or so that it stated spawning L32s.
---
You can also score several Fusion cores there on a good day.
---
It's been that way since launch. Cap is 24 individual players joining, but unless they've changed it, up to 32 people can actually be on the server from groups joining from main menu. Ofc, very few people -actually do- that, so its pretty rare to have more.
---
You're right. And that's true, not only are perks and playstyles not being developed but workshops are being unused to their full potential.
---
Glowing blood packs are very helpful.
---
ive only seen ONE piece of armor drop with Sentinel on it in all my time playing, i have 3 chars, lvl 103, lvl 98, and lvl 74
---
good to know, thx.
---
I find them worth it somewhat, but thats just me. It usually gives a rare weapon, not super rare but typically a rare.
---
Thank you for this site, I only just launched my first nuke last night and would probably not even have bothered if I could not have so easily gotten the launch code from your site.  The process for our group was pretty tough, most of us not having done it ever or in a long time, so it would have been so much more painful figuring it out if we also had to do the code!  I'll be checking out the new features.
---
How long did it take you to find him by switching and where is it on the map
---
How so?
---
It was great,  I wanted to make a stealth sniper alt and went from 22 to 55 over the weekend.  Now it‚Äôs time to get out and really explore.
---
They aren't going to sadly. You can tell by their recent actions with this game and elder scrolls blades. They don't give a flying fuck about the players, they just want to suck as much money as they can out of you.
---
Which is why as soon as the private servers are released I'll never touch a bethesda server again and never buy a single atom from them. Not to mention won't be buying any future games from them.
---
Could try wes tek or any location with super mutants. They usually use laser rifles which I assume still count towards pistols because it only changes between pistol or rifle after a certain part of it is modified.
---
A question for mods:
---
Why is mentioning the most popular trading subreddit (the one with m-a-r-k-e-t in the name) cause for instantly killing the post? Is there some bad blood between the two sub reddits? Will we be able to direct people there if they ask where to do trades in fallout 76, now that trading is disallowed here?
---
I bought two 3\* armor pieces off the Watoga Station vendor a few days ago, Couldn't inspect them so it was a gamble, and 1 turned out to be the 50% limb damage reduction, but the other was a Vanguard's Cavalier piece for less than 400 caps, Score!
---
I could see some really high level players hassling &lt;50 level players if they were able to be in both types of servers. But then again, that happens already, and a level 50 could own a level 5.
---
Apart from the higher level disparity in adventure+, I think I've destroyed my own point. Oops!
---
Since 200+ are already in the same servers as 1+, you're right.
---
I still think that its implementation would need careful consideration, but I like the concept.
---
Wes tek
---
I had the same issue running with 8gb RAM and I upgraded to 16gb and it improved dramatically.
---
I have zero issues with a pay for respec system honestly. The game needs some method to do this that isn't the current system and Bethesda needs money from the game.
---
Hi good job. Im not playing often, but found your web app views quit useful. I have a couple of questions for you.
---
What service do you use for hosting source code -  github/bitbucket.  Is your repo public? Im a web developer, maybe could contribute to your project somehow  :)
---
This is great! I'm so sick of trying to remember where a plant spawns when I need to craft an alcoholic beverage for Biv. Questions/suggestions:
---
If I click on the map it adds a marker but there's no way to remove it.
---
Are you still adding more of the existing items? For example, search for 'aster' and it seems only half the map is populated. Same with 'recipe'. 
---
Are you planning a selectable list of items on the map so we don't have to know the exact name?
---
Suggestions on things to add: Crafting workbenches, random spawn locations (split by type as there are 4 categories), toggle map locations on/off so I can see the nearest fast-travel point, interior cell items
---
And finally, what could I do to help? Been looking for something like this for a while and all the other maps seem to come up short for all the random crap on the map.
---
All you have to do is tag the ghouls with a molotov and then let the turrets do the rest. Why waste ammo when you can let the turrets do it for you?
---
Nice camp! Great design with good placement and use of budget
---
Seriously
---
Yea in my&gt;300 hours I've never seen hundreds of people on a server. It would crash before it got anywhere near that.
---
Aren't there at least 2 full on green houses in the wasteland, not counting the Ag Center in Flatwoods? So the assets exist, it just needs implemented on the C.A.M.P. side.
---
Yup, which is why I'm gonna be moving my camp to the whitespring golf course right before that patch so I can set up my own turret base there, that won't be able to be destroyed by players.
---
Using Sneak, but I don't use Better Critical perk to target specific parts.
---
I'll buy it off you if you still have it when I get home tonight. -Nymith
---
They so they drop laser guns or laser snipers
---
If you are on a team share, or have someone share rad sponge. Stay close to each other . One point version is all that is needed.
---
All of my tests are without sneak for consistency
---
They said they have their base in Whitespring...
---
Did you start playing the game today?
---
Thanks so much, I have to keep myself from fidgeting with everything lol üòÇ. I could add more but the turrets became necessary...sadly.
---
I soloed a Legendary Sheepsquatch and a Moth Man last night. The Whitespring bots by the guardhouse there did not make it however.
---
Is the player vending out yet and what‚Äôs the news on the new vendor, I haven‚Äôt been able to play in a while
---
He had his camp at whitespring. Someone probably thought it was a turret base.
---
Ill be honest, right now I don't host the code anywhere. First project Ive done that really left my home PC. Learning a lot, but havent spent the time to set up anything on that front yet.
---
It's to sell repair kits. What happens is this:
---
A. People's armor just breaks. It's is no longer based on damage taken it's just over time no matter what.
---
B. People spend their ingame earned atoms on repair kits
---
C. The weekly atom shop update starts to get unique limited time things, making people want to spend money.
---
You either spend money or have a massive disadvantage. It's the pay to win hidden aspects.
---
The Hemlock Holes Maintenance workshop has three acid deposits you can but extractors on. It‚Äôs not a huge amount, but it‚Äôs a decent haul
---
I love to come by! I am not apposed to giving advice either. Up to you let's grab a drink! üçª
---
My best strategy I could come up with is to capture workshops that have 3 oil, 3 acid, and a high steel one such as grafton steel. You can get maybe like 50-100 fuel for every 20 minutes or something that way
---
He said his camp was built at the whitespring. I am thinking people thought it was a turret camp. which is why they raized it.
---
Yeah it was def worth doing. 181 on Friday and 196 on Sunday.
---
You are not the only one that is surprised by that, but you are the first one that is not directly witchhunting people and call them ugly griefers. Respect boy.
---
That's a pretty clever strategy.  I might have to try that.  Luck is tight, but you did drop Bloody Mess.
---
I have to admit, I dismiss perks like Mysterious Savior because their description text isn't very... you know... descriptive.  Rank 1, sometimes he will save you.  Rank 2, he'll save you a little more often.  Rank 3, he'll show up regularly.  OMG, Bethesda, can you give me some actual numbers here?  What are we talking here?  25/50/75%? üòÇ
---
Hey there! I will reach out and see what the status of this is and update you when I get an answer.
---
You got downvoted but I design roofs for a living. You're right. This game is missing valley sets.
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JPN8qI1w0I
---
There's the clip. You can clearly see the difference between crits and regular hits.
---
There is a heavy sheepsquatch staff as well
---
Even worse is a lack of two factor authentication combined with our ACCOUNT NAME on display 24/7.
---
Like there was no real discussion on security here at all.
---
Just launched the launcher.
---
Hey, I have a question for you. Does you camp get attacked constantly? I was coming out of the train station the other day, and a guy had built his camp directly across the road. He definitely didn't seem to be home but there scorched attacking his turrets, follow by liberators just moments later (they took at least one of the turrets out). Thought about moving up that ways but not if it means constant repairs.
---
Ye im convinced they work, but for me the difference is minimal read my latest reply to you
---
I love your camp and appreciate the creativeness that you used with this build!
---
Time and time again i see beautiful camp builds but there is one thing that sticks out like a sore thumb and it's that awful mesh staircase. Bethesda needs to give us other options (yes we have a skin option on the basic steel staircase).
---
I might finally be able to get all 10 golfers at white springs
---
Fallout 76 code is more powerful than internet says.
---
but internet says otherwise so it must be true.
---
I‚Äôve got so many cool animated cards that I‚Äôd love to use but I already have levelled up non animated ones, so that makes sense haha
---
Just need more plants to keep them distracted lol I'm set up just west of W.S and always come back to enemies trying to wipe out my razorgrain but they are much lower level over there
---
Thank you.  I really appreciate it and all the work you and the other community managers do to keep us informed.
---
Yup, and now with them changing how camps work people are going to be making player traps they can't get out of. Imagine once they stop being able to damage CAMPS, someone makes a camp right where you spawn in from a map marker and boom, you are inside a camp with no way out and no way to destroy a wall to get out. Would be even worse if you are Overencumbered, then you'd be forced to drop stuff just to leave.
---
I know I'll make a character that specifically catches other players with camp building. If I see someone over encumbered? I'll drop my camp and use a blueprinted cube as a trap. Then you get free stuff from the other players since they won't be able to leave, or fast travel due to over encumbered.
---
It does but I see a ton of 5.56 rifles rather than laser guns... but I will try it cause it's my best bet
---
wait, did i see you have a flamethrower trap set up to go off if anyone sleeps in the bed? brilliant!
---
use nuka grape or glowing blood packs.
---
Right now the search on the backend only returns 300 results, so if there are more than that you end up with the half results you see on the map. 
---
The click marker is for a player marker, so you can search for items near your player specifically.
---
As far as a selectable list im not sure what you mean, I plan to add a search suggestion feature + advanced search features so that you can narrow it down if you dont know the exact info about the item.
---
Interior cells will be rough, mainly because to make any sense they would have to either all be the same point, all items in an interior cell would point to the door to the cell, or they would require their own maps, and sadly there are no interior maps for 76.
---
As far as help goes, im not sure, right now everything is set up privately with no public repo etc. I have got several other requests to set one up so people can help, so if I end up doing that I will let you know!
---
That would be incredible, I would love that so much...
---
I could say also check BoS locations. They some times have laser guns near scribe bodies and other BoS bodies.
---
So many fun events with everyone jumping in
---
This. The mod in WoW (I used it on my destruction Warlock during Burning Crusade) shows your cast bar and your most recent latency as a section of that bar on the end of it. You use that with a macro that does two things - first it stops the current cast, and second, it starts a new cast. These things happen instantly, and if timed right, you can cast very slightly faster - around 100-200 ms faster usually, which knocks .1 - .2 seconds off of your cast. That might not sound like a ton, but if your cast time is 1.5 seconds, that could be like a 10 - 15% increase in how many spells you can cast over the duration of the fight. However, if you screwed it up even once, you'd lose a full cast and be set back by quite a bit.
---
I‚Äôm on Xbox, GT: Cable526. Feel free to stop by if we‚Äôre on the same system sometime üç∫
---
There is a trip wire thru the bed that closes the door and a pressure plate under the bed to set off the flamethrowers. It looks hilarious going off :)
---
I freaking love my monitor's center dot overlay. Makes using gatling gun / .50 cal so easy.
---
I'm a Stealth Build, so I even stay hidden or caution on SBQ battles 75% of the time, and regularly complete an entire WS run without being discovered.
---
Yeah, sadly for some reason the super mutants like to come and steal my booze! But, yeah that's why I had to have the turrets in the wall. I find if you don't have a ton of plants/water they tends to be less. Since I cut down on the plants it's been less attacks.
---
Well regardless, the function itself is super handy. Thank you for creating such a helpful tool!
---
Yay 10 seconds of fuel
---
Could I tag along? Level 70, PS4 as well. Psn: yawnbringer
---
I'll try that too
---
This is fantastic, thank you for your hard work.
---
I'm pretty sure they all turn into one fusion core and you lose a bunch, don't do this
---
Last few days I've been repairing my armor a LOT more than I'm used to.  I guessed it was due to trying new play styles.  Ballistic fibre was a pain to find this last weekend, too.
---
I think I went from Lv. 173 or so to Lv. 185.  Killed maybe about 8-10 Sheepsquatches all told.
---
Maybe a hardware problem.  Check your cooling?  (Dust removal).
---
Xbox here as well. GT is the same as my username. I will üçª
---
Hey there! Unfortunately, there is no cross over between platforms for characters or Atomic Shop items.
---
Thanks for the info as I always have like about 30 of those things. P
---
Thank you this is great I can save 70 pounds I've been storing legendaries for the purveyor that's about 70 more legendarys...
---
I found it second time I looked at a location(didn't even server hop) and this was the day it launched. Is this lucky
---
I've done it for a while and they always seem to stay separate.
---
I have a lot of video but overall I try to not put random peoples tags in my videos, so I probably won‚Äôt upload any. I did put one random in this one tho :) thanks for checking it out :)
---
Sure. We‚Äôre normally on evenings CST/EST.
---
As far as ik the shield operator has the highest strength get the under armor from the enclave then get the plan at tanagra town it‚Äôs behind the keypad door
---
Very helpful! While things tend to destroy my crops, I didn't realize they were attracting them as well (thought it was primarily my generator). I've got some floating razorgrain to get rid, . . .
---
My ign Baronik, will add you when I'll be back home.
---
True. Plus we can just initiate a trade request and look through an inventory to identify potential hacking targets. Then it's just brute forcing a person and looting the spoils.
---
Internet? No, not internet. Former game dev who now is working on the private server mods, and helped create the skyrim together mod that allowed multiplayer in skyrim.
---
Yes me too with my main character which is why i am wondering why it's so hard to find this time.
---
sure.
---
You're doing something wrong.  Do you have any points in Gunsmith?
---
This is so great!
---
Holy moly. I thought lvl 200 was high.
---
There is no way to beat this challenge unless you lure a hound all the way there. Bethesda needs to check their weekly Challenges.
---
Yeah, you can check my post history, I worked for Midway games a couple decades ago, helped create the series san fransico rush and its spin off's. Recently I was one of the coders who helped create "skyrim together" the multiplayer mod for skyrim.
---
What's ajunk extractor good base though
---
I tried that spot. Several times. Not one behometh yesterday. Then when I saw this thread and saw a guy had to kite a mutant hound to it and that it didn't spawn with other mutants/hounds, I gave up. If Bethesda is going to do challenges like this they should be worth more. But that means giving out more than a measly 60 atoms a day.
---
50 atoms for this one
---
(X) Doubt.
---
I mean, all you have to do is not rush in the middle of the ghouls so you don't die of radiation. Nothing hard.
---
That's great to hear! Glad you had fun with it :)
---
I just kept changing servers at the middle cabins until they spawned ;).
---
Heavily modified how?  Is it automatic?
---
Congrats on the new PA!  
---
A week ago I dropped off my complete LvL 25 Excavator at Sutton station.  I hope somebody was able to use it, even if they just sold it to the vendor, LOL!
---
They should fix the one inside Charleston Station too. üòâ
---
The sheepsquatch gave me an explody bullets mini gun. 
---
5/7 perfect weekend.
---
I have had good luck lately at grafton steel, they are low level and dropped charging laser rifles, i got the scrap 76 laser weapons challenge done today there
---
Like someone else said they need to do a 7 day double xp run so those who work can get a piece of the pie.
---
No need to be rude and make personal attacks on another player, i never said you were bitching or being childish or deluding yourself.  Attacking someone for expecting more because that's what was advertised seems like a overly strong reaction.   Bethesda did advertise the game is playable for a long time and the money spent would keep the game and content churning out.   I feel it's not, if the content dropped so far is any indicator of future content,  buyers were definitely mislead.   The game industry as a whole has lowered people's expectations including Bethesda and that's sad.
---
I still have a sheep sasquatch recall If you guys would like to do one with me XnukedtoastX
---
Lol, thanks a lot... one of my party members ended up getting me. I actually ran out of stimpaks near the end and went down twice :P
---
I started playing for the first time last sunday and I must have crashed 15+ times so far lol
---
Thanks
---
colonel kelly &amp; phillippi. 1 cap travel, twice the coverage. then hop.
---
Bollocks.  The food decay was a bug which is fixed, your speculation about weapons degradation is totally unsupported.
---
Does that lucky repair perk work for melee weapons? I feel like my handmade gets repaired often enough that I never have to worry but my All Rise breaks all the time.
---
Got it, thats fine.
---
Anyway, I would recommend to move a source code to web storage, in terms of reliability - no need for a backups. I have to mention that Github and Bitbucket both have a private repositories for free (for a small teams), if you not going to share a code with others.
---
I got my money's worth. But Bethesda is not looking for just my 60 bux. They want us to continue playing this game and paying for atoms. They won't get that if we end up getting frustrated and just leaving (or doing stuff that makes me not buy atoms on principle alone.. and then getting frustrated and leaving cause they want earning atoms to be just too annoying to actually do).
---
I did this in the Beta and several weeks following. Lost 15+ cores and several spare power armor pieces, because you used to be able to store those too.
---
Someone posted this, re-uploaded so I don't have to go looking. [https://i.imgur.com/X4ecqTS.png](https://i.imgur.com/X4ecqTS.png)
---
went from 20ish to 53 during the weekend. Felt like I skipped over half of the game.
---
Is the proximity search not implemented yet? That would be a great solution to the 300 problem: show the 300 closest to the player marker.
---
Selectable list: Yes, a list of things to search for. Maybe a drop down that does the search for you. So you would pick what you want and it returns the exact items. For example, treasure maps locations are listed as 'mound'. So you would just pick Treasure Map from a list and it would do the search for mound. Like how the other maps are done, like at [fo76map.com](https://fo76map.com), but with more and better locations. 
---
Interior cells: the location within the cell isn't as important as knowing that a cell contains X item. For example, Poseidon has a power armor inside but it doesn't show up in a search for power armor locations. Maybe make a list of all the unique items in a cell and list one marker for each unique at the entrance to the cell or fast travel location. So, for example, if you search for cigarette, it would only show one marker at Sugar Grove instead of 100 for all the packs that are in there.
---
That's incredible! Can you explain the camera to me?
---
Any high level located supermutants horde event can work. Plus Bog town &amp; the general's steakhouse.
---
West Tek for sure
---
My thoughts as well. So people who work on the weekend can get a slice of the xp pie.
---
I don't know, therefore [aliens](https://knowyourmeme.com/photos/158326-ancient-aliens).
---
That and people who don‚Äôt have the game (and complain about it) will realize how wrong they were
---
No problem! Just received an update on this, we do have this currently planned to be fixed in Patch 9.
---
8 personally just don‚Äôt like the small inside my camp is a 4x4 and it‚Äôs still a little to small for me
---
I think that this would be the best option. Completely remove enemy levels, so all combat is on an even footing and loot is dependent on your personal level. 
---
It would remove the annoyance of other players walking into your current area and drastically reducing (or for newer players, INCREASING) the level of enemies in the area. It would also ensure that endgame players aren't restricted to such a small amount of the map for things other than resource gathering.
---
I would want a single caveat though, and that would be for Flatwoods and the "No-nuke zone." Have these areas remain "lower level" content, to ensure that newer players are able to have a more peaceful area to learn the ropes.
---
My man, I‚Äôll make you a Targeting HUD for it. 
---
Just because. 
---
I‚Äôll be on around 6:30pm western US
---
Part of it is novelty, they're legacy weapons after all. The beam splitter mod turns it into a pretty accurate shotgun as well, and explosive is pretty effective with those types of weapons since the damage is per pellet/beam. They have poor durability, but managable with luck of the draw since they were buffed (actually the improved repair kits are a godsend for them too, since mine still breaks relatively fast and sometimes I have bad luck with LotD).
---
Weird. I've only done this since long after beta, and never had this issue. I only tried it on empty frames though, so maybe that had to do with it. I still haven't lost any, but 76 is always surprising with it's glitches.
---
I killed a sheepsquatch but failed the event. But I also finished the main story line and I‚Äôm gonna launch a nuke and explore the burrows this week so that should be fun. Double xp brought me back to the game and I went from 37-55
---
Honestly, his explanation makes perfect sense really on why he'd play 300 hours. F2P games are designed to work on a gambling type mindset, tease you with possibility of reward, just enough to keep playing, but obviously not give you too much cause they're trying to keep your money. Except this time it is tease you with promise of getting nice item if you play enough and make it just out of reach and then offer something to "Shortcut" getting it.  This is exactly why I oppose non cosmetic microtransactions (or really any microtransaction they let you "work" for in game can get this way... note the chore for earning atoms to get customizations in this game. It's why I actually was not ecstatic you could earn atoms, I felt it would have been better if customizations were just outright something you had to buy. It would make the game less manipulative and they could focus on making it fun and not put stuff that once you realize how grindy it is makes the game feel hollow cause most your work was fruitless).  
---
That said I've overall enjoyed the game, but I either need to stop playing it or give up on caring about getting anything in the atom store. Because the grind for atoms is starting to really just make this game feel like work.
---
It stopped working several patches back, didn't realize till I lost a few. Not sure if it's working again or not, but I suggest not getting into this habit and just carrying what you need and no more.
---
Laser rifles or laser sniper rifles
---
How the hell is that possible
---
Perk Card system is probably one of the less desired features.  I get the why, just not the do.
---
On paper yeah it‚Äôs neat.  In reality it does not actually enhance anything.
---
The flatwoods monster is an alien.
---
I never take starched genes off, I always get the proper effect from serums. Seems safe to me.
---
I think charging laser sniper rifles,
---
that sounds fun, i  would enjoy being your guinea pig to set off the traps
---
ill try to remember to send a friend request tonight after work
---
my PSN id is FritoZ 
---
:)
---
I got it at Landview Lighthouse -- there are only two feeble ferals and a radroach between the spawn spot and the top of the lighhouse where the tourist spawns.
---
How often so super mutants drop laser rifles not laser snipers
---
Never tried torso shots because it's a bit silly, why waste a crit on non-weakpoints?
---
Anyway, i'll test it later too
---
At minimum levels. Not at lvl 50. 
---
https://gamestoday.info/pc/fallout/comprehensive-power-armor-and-mods-guide/
---
I like some of the cards themselves but the packs are just not an effective idea.
---
It is yes but it‚Äôs not counted as an alien in the challenges
---
Id say a realistic price is 5000 caps for sure
---
but, you could always start higher and test the waters at 10,000 caps
---
Great idea I'd love to go back to what are normally low level spots and see what they could put there
---
Still got them legacy pa storage containers. Probably got like 30 cores in one of them. In just afraid to take them out, because if you enter it they wipe all of them.
---
Sadly for me it's one of the few doable ones. I find now that I can maybe get 30 or 40 atoms from the dailies (I used to be able to get them all usually) including that one (long as I don't have a full level to work for).
---
Yeah it would be cool. At high level you can't so easily to get excited to most of the areas. 
---
Which as high level looter/explorer I'm not super fond of. At 700+ hours I've barely explored maybe 30%-40% of map.
---
Every now and then I found new fun things. Mostly very little, but it's still fun to encounter them. So it would be nice to have levelled up enemies while doing that. And whenever you encounter a 3 star enemy, there's a lot better chance to get something useful, if it's at least level 45.(some mid level and even low level legendaries are okay in my book, it's just far less likely)
---
And more generally, loot should be more even and spread out. Certain ammo drops a lot, while most everything else drops either little to none.
---
I‚Äôm a melee, so when it dies, it dies right in front of me. I have done the event twice, and both times the corpse was visible. (Xbox) May be a pc thing idk
---
This game was a lazy money-grab, that's how.
---
Wish I was on your server, I would have easily taken that up. My friend I play with hasn't been on a few days and I didn't even try to bother with that one cause of that (But I would have if some one offered to help me. And I'd let you take a pic of me in return).
---
For the sake of testing lol and because when aiming for torso using a high end weapon its usually a oneshot i dont bother aiming for the head except on super mutants where i have to go for the head and the accuracy isnt the same so i thought torso crits would kill since normal hits almost do but i was wrong
---
I've been playing since BETA and have only had 2 hard crashes in all the time.
---
If you say so.
---
Looks like your curriculum is important to you.
---
How "can't" solo? The game doesn't have hard death?
---
Pretty sure rifle and sniper are the same. Its just a mod that changes it to sniper. Could be wrong though.
---
wait until the game crashs when you think "some more bullets and we got the SBQ down" ;)
---
Nothing to do with "say so". Just pointing out that the fo76 architecture that is currently running on the amazon cloud servers is beyond bad, the skyrim together mod has better server stability than this game. There is no way anyone who has any understanding of game engines would call fo76's engine "powerful". It is over a decade old, it is literally the gamebryo engine they used over 10 years ago.
---
killing one completed the alien challenges for me
---
In ESO all content scales to your level no matter where you are and no matter what level other people in your group is at. It is pretty ingenious.
---
I went from 120 to 160. It was insane lol.
---
So never fire the Cryolator on the move then?  Good tip to know.
---
The paradox with every thread about this question saying google it is, these threads show up on google. So then someone comes here to ask.
---
Well, actually I think many got tired of that because their ez caps were nerfed.
---
Absolutely.  Of all the roof pieces on offer, this is the one that is conspicuously absent, and I run into this quirk frequently when I build.
---
A good video that shows off the Plague armor very well.
---
I heard they are making a legendary prestige system!
---
I was lucky to boost my alt from lvl 17 to lvl 38 :) bonus to that, some kind stranger left full X01 PA next to WS train station
---
You don't need to take off Starched Genes when you take a serum.
---
Fortunately for me, I know this feeling.  Picked up a Quad Handmade at Lewisburg train station for 600 caps.  Installed a perforating magazine for 40% armor penetration....works great with my rifle build.  
---
I know I've sold some valuable bits to vendors because I couldn't find someone to buy them through forums.  We really need a trading system in the game.
---
For a game that has no NPC's, I'm spending more time listening to NPC's than i did in fallout 4. Honestly, the only real difference is removing the redundant chat system from FO4 (hold up some pip-boy cutouts and pretend they are the NPC's talking).
---
It‚Äôs not killing one that‚Äôs the challenges, it‚Äôs taking photos of one and it doesn‚Äôt register on the camera as an alien, it registers as a flatwoods monster both when it‚Äôs alive and dead
---
How much Radiation the counter saying that you are taking?
---
Should be about 2/ Sec. With Rad-X you can get it down to 1.5/ Sec. That should be more than adiquate. 
---
Also as others have mentioned, 1\* Rad Sponge shared with a team mate will remove all your Rads, IF that option is available to you.
---
In all honesty.. I wasn't actually looking for him. I just happened to fast travel nearby and got engaged by him. And thus this picture came to be.
---
I've seen no difference in armor degradation, or even it degrading in camp while not actively fighting.
---
You need calibrated shocks.
---
Yes this is on Xbox. Anytime someone has a shop open there‚Äôs a line of people waiting.
---
Luck hole mine with excavator one clear = 1000 lead
---
Can you just respawn at 76, and then fast travel to camp? Or does that not work, either?
---
On my first character I got 5 different animated Pack Rat cards.
---
I do too. I ended up doing a run and then hopping. Ended up finding Ansel at the big teapot and rediscovering a lot of locations i forgot about. I probably hopped once an hour, as i ended up doing a lot of events.
---
&gt; If you get enough AP regen you won't actually be hurt by being overloaded. You won't be able to fast travel or sprint, sure, but you will perform much better in a fight and you can pretty much ignore the carry weight limit.
---
Well, apart from burning fusion cores like something you burn quickly.
---
I've wondered why they didn't do this since fallout 4. It seems like a huge thing to miss when creating a building system.
---
Ah that was good
---
If it's invisible when killed, then the corpse will also be invisible, also it doesn't always appear in the same place for everyone which makes it very difficult to find sometimes.
---
Best option seems to be "time", just work the area over looting all metal piles, the Imposter will turn to a metal pile after several minutes.
---
Huntersville is always good for a few as well
---
Ok so you are actually confusing the renderer engine and the net code engine.
---
Are you really sure you understand what you are saying?
---
It's also a common argument (in the internet) to say gamebryo is old.
---
well... guess what... directx is old too, opengl too. Part of the Carmack Quake2 code is still used today in many engine too. A lot of code in many app is old and works.
---
PvE enemies aren't shooting your head. Players are.
---
So of course you don't need head armor when you are doing only PvE. But for PvP you'd need.
---
Bethesda won't even let you use the _word_ "flamer".
---
I feel it was advertised that they would keep updating it with content that keeps you coming back to play when an update is released, which, for the most part has been followed through with after bugfixes and such.
---
Maybe it's just a difference of perspective here, I personally dont have enough time to sink into games anymore, and for someone who has more time to spare it may be different.
---
I apologize for being so defensive and rude in my previous comment, it was unnecessary.
---
I was trying to say that if there is enough content to get you to level 300, then I dont really see how there can be a lack of things to do, and that's definitely a couple to a few hundred hours put in, if not more.
---
The future updates on the roadmap look promising. Personally, I havent been dissapointed with the content updates, they give me something to do and keep up with when I hop on every few days and it's nice. The content that there is is thoroughly enjoyable and the updates they have released are definitely of higher quality, just not enough quantity.
---
Decrease the mods and you will notice a huge difference. Weightless guns and overall weight of gun heavily affects durability. Use armors with +intelligence. Hope this helps
---
Perfect thanks
---
I've never purchased atoms. I've never felt the need to. Maybe that's just me.
---
Thanks friend. What's up, I'll try and help out the best I can.
---
That first one is dumb. Why can't they join under level 50? I've had plenty of character builds that can do all end game content at like level 40. Soloing SB at 25 and soloing the imposter at 45.
---
Why couldn't I put that character on those servers? I would prefer to kill those higher level mobs anyways.
---
gotcha.. I haven't done the camera stuff yet. I just figured that since it marks off the "alien" challenges and achievement, then maybe it should count towards everything.. maybe a glitch/bug in the game?
---
&gt; If you move backwards/reverse the ap drain is inanely small.
---
This one weird trick drives fusion core generators insane.
---
That's fucking nuts.  So you spend all your time in PA moving backwards?
---
Thanks, I will be on in about 8 hours
---
1. Yes, like the ones you get in the wild they are permanent. The only thing temporary about them is the suppression of the negative effects which lasts 1 hour. 
---
2. I've heard you dont have to take off starched genes, but I always remove it just to be sure. 
---
3. Speed demon and marsupial work fine together. Those were the first 2 I had, and I never looked back.
---
I would love this to death. No more having to nuke the golf course to have any hope of slightly challenging mobs. Not that they are, really.
---
And make the new servers have few fast travel points, maybe like survival. Your camp, train stations, your team members(not friends- teamed. People have a friends list 1000 people long for the travel) Random encounters are actually a threat again- make em count!
---
Np
---
Nuke zones count as radstorms. And you even don't have to be in it. it just shoud be on map
---
People generally consider combat the best.
---
So what about lower level characters that are min maxed to where they can fight on par or even better than most level 50+ characters? Like I have a level 40 character that can solo the imposter, could solo scorch beasts at 25, and I spend most of my time with that lower level character in areas much higher than me. 
---
She could 1 shot the lvl 63 bloated glowing ghouls at the whitespring at level 30. That change would basically make that character useless and force me to grind levels on her when she doesn't even need them, just so I can join the end game servers? That seems rather silly TBH.
---
Just like everything else in the game, it comes down to personal preferences and build. Heavy Leather is killer because it's cheap and provides serious energy damage resistance. If it breaks scrap it and build fresh since it's cheaper to make than to repair. I ran only leather through level 50. Robot and Trapper armor provide rad resistance.
---
If you place your CAMP near a resource node you can place an Extractor on it like in Workshops.
---
&gt;What would happen when a player levels up to 51? Would they be booted straight away, booted after a quest, or given a timer to leave?
---
I wonder if the engine allows for level scaling. Like SWTOR does. Make a high level that groups with someone on Adventure server scale back levels to match their companions. Or the opposite- allow a level boost for gear and health to 50 for a noob that joins the + server with a friend so they can level together. (maybe restrict- can only do this if you have a 50+ character already)
---
No, when overencumbered you cannot respawn at 76! Only on the one you are randomly given, or for free on team mates!
---
One time, while in the Cranberry Bog, I randomly got a mutation called "Scorch Beast Dingus", and now the SBQ won't stop texting me.
---
It's probably only +10 carry weight and mostly done for aethestics to be able to sell more skins.
---
Can I get an invite lol! I'm GMT been dying to find a group to run with.
---
kiddj1 is my PSN
---
When you get to level 25, just be sure NOT to register the excavator PA before you get to the part of Miner Miracles that gives you the excavator plans. Only register it (which also completes the quest and gives you power armor station plans) after you get the power armor plans and it tells you to craft it. Otherwise you will never be able to craft it yourself.
---
Yeah but for assassin cav stuff I mean. I wanna know what leather assassin cav pieces are worth? Same with robot?
---
Nice. On PC I never met a shop and only 2 ppl with a microphone. I‚Äôm like lvl 90 or 100. didn‚Äôt log in for weeks now :-/
---
Yes there are consequences. But dont worry, just good ones. You will be granted plenty mothman eggs to make into omelettes and sell for a fair price.
---
Fair enough.
---
I have about a hundred hours and I've never focused too much on things in the atomic shop. Sometimes I check what there is and spend the atoms I've accumulated, but personally I've never farmed challenges for atoms to get stuff.
---
Some things in the atom are pretty cool though, and I can see it being something people would want to grind for.
---
It always has.
---
Unless you have high INT for both demo and smith, most people run demo expert in the INT slot for explosive weapons, which I'm assuming his handmade is.
---
you should be dead now ;)
---
Thank you so much
---
I would love to see the main factions and then a sort of wheel of interactions between them. On one end you have Brotherhood of Steel, who are closely allied to the Free States, and dislike the Responders, and hate the Enclave. Then you have the Enclave, who are closely allied to the Responders (good for PR, try to keep whatever is left of the constituents alive, supply medicine and medical expertise), dislike the Free States and hate the BoS. The Order of Mysteries and Raiders are opposed to each other, but I see them more as outside the main wheel, since they seem more like wildcards.
---
No, it sounds totally believable.  Some people just refuse to believe that the game crashes lots for some users and almost not at all for others.
---
What system are you on, what region are you in and what is your internet connection like?
---
(Me, I'm on PS4 PRO in Western Europe with 1Gbps fibre internet.  I play most days, get some kind of problem (CTD, hang, server disconnect) maybe 2-4 times a month).
---
To say the least, the acupuncture was great.. Would I see the SheepSquatch again for another round? *probably* not..
---
1, I agree with you, I don't like it either
---
2, Mutations, for those willing to buy from Dupers, are far too easy to come by.\*
---
3, You should be limited to 1 mutation, and Class Freak and Stranger in Numbers should not exist.
---
* I struggle to believe that at 19k6 (24k base) per plan that people managed to get enough Caps together to buy all the Plans for all the Serums legitimately. Especially when they then sell serums for 150 caps each, that it bad business sense, if they had to actual earn those Caps/ plans they would sell them at that price, just look at the PA Crafters market, 6k for a Calibrated Shock plan, fitted for 500/ leg if you supply the caps.
---
&gt;I think its punishment for hoarding.
---
No it's not. You can be overencumbered only because you're doing camp stuff in your camp, with certain weight reduction perks disabled to equipt crafting perks instead.
---
Sweet! I tried it once before I made the comment, but maybe I mistyped or didn't let it load. This site rocks.
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BffgC5DKQG0
---
System, region, internet?
---
Thank-you for the kind words. Glad you like it.
---
I went to every one of those spots lol. The upside is I havent explored in a while so that was cool.
---
This makes me sad :(. PC has the hardware to give fallout its best potential. Do you think it‚Äôs because it is on the bethesda launcher and not steam?
---
&gt;Also well, you actually can't compare Skyrim together servers with Fallout 76 servers, they just don't stand in the same league at all.
---
True, the skyrim together can handle more players than the fo76 servers can. LOL
---
&gt;well... guess what... directx is old too, opengl too. Part of the Carmack Quake2 code is still used today in many engine too. A lot of code in many app is old and works.
---
Except the current engine they are using isn't working well. If it was there wouldn't be the massive amounts of bugs STILL in the game. Dupes wouldn't STILL be in the game, people wouldn't be getting crashes just for launching 2 nukes. etc.
---
&gt;Ok so you are actually confusing the renderer engine and the net code engine.
---
You don't understand how fo76 works obviously. There really isn't any netcode, the client side of the game does 99% of the computing, it is why you can see fabric items lose physics when they are out of a players FOV, due to the physics being run on the client not the server.
---
The "server software" they have is one of the worst designed things I've ever seen a triple A developer put out. FFS it still doesn't even do any sanity checks. It is why the fucking "cheat engine" program still works in this online game. Same with how the server software didn't even do sanity checks on player positioning, allowing people to uncap their framerates and get "speed hacks" just by doing that.
---
Yeah i guess before i starte dplaying nights were darker... my very first reddit post here was basically-    
---
Why are nights so bright?
---
A bunch of people downvoted me, saying the nights used to be darker but so many people complained they went too far the other way and now nights are basically day time
---
So, maybe Bethesda could dial it  back a bit? Nights reallya re too bright, basically there is no need for the nighteyes perk at all
---
we all have pip boy lights and PA headlamps... use them if it gets dark!
---
i think the game would be much more immersive if the nights were actually dark
---
Remember when you could store a stuff inside the power armor frame but had to be extremely careful not to put it on because it would delete it all?
---
Im thinking this is the best bet because they are so close
---
Not yet.  No news.
---
Bunch of spoilers have been datamined, but I'm refusing to read them out of a perverse desire to discover things myself.
---
Mine hasn't been degrading faster. I repaired to 200% a week ago and have only gotten to 100% on one piece, an arm that already usually degrades faster.
---
PS4 Pro, NA and my internet is fine the game just crashes to the ps4 menu all the time. My brother playing on a much older regular ps4 has maybe 1/3 the ammount of crashes I get.
---
Try attaching a doorway and see if the floor will store then.
---
If not, I think you may be stuffed mate. I've lost countless objects in this way :( usually power connectors lol.
---
Can't click on your link, maybe because I'm at work. I tried to craft some additional PA the other day to update my sets now that I'm over 60, but it looked like what I could craft for excavator was trash compared to x-01 and ultracite, which is unfortunate because I bought the bone skin for exc and really wanted to use it late game. 
---
I did find this link, which shows excavator coming in at 366 rad resist vs. 395 and 453 for UC and x-01 respectively, which is relatively comparable. But the the DR and ER for the exc are almost useless. You can get that kind of performance from regular armor. 
---
I guess I just don't see any reason not to wear ultracite or x-01, considering they are just as easy to acquire as the excavator. Unless you're going on a mining run to get ultracite to make/maintain your ultracite PA, so the excavator armor is only good for obtaining the ultracite armor. Excavator is the internet explorer of PAs.
---
Much more stable now.  And has been adding new content frequently since early March.
---
to people downvoting- WHY do you want the nights to be so bright? and WHY does anger you all so much if someone wants the nights to be nightlike?
---
I'm giving up for now but will still be playing so please anyone let me know if you find one.
---
Warm Regards
---
It drives me crazy.
---
Um well don't laugh but I'd have to hit options then scroll down to photo gallery and the carefully select the field of vision, frame, etc and of course I'd be dead by then.
---
:O Such an honour.. Thankyou for the kind words.
---
I still find an *occasional* quill here and there, I'm just recovering after my unscheduled acupuncture appointment..
---
I've seen it reported that fast travel can make the melted robot appear.
---
I honestly hadn't noticed till you pointed it out. About 30 hours into the game doing Rosie's quests.
---
üëç we login around 20.00 - 21.00
---
I‚Äôll send you one
---
lol i was wondering the same thing
---
Upstairs at the agricultural place at flatwoods, in an office behind a door with a picklock there is a spawn for a laser pistol, I see it there a lot when I call in there for the cap stash on top of the desk.
---
Probably not possible without loading the game world first.
---
This would be because of Bethesda's decrepit engine though. It's totally possible in other games of course.
---
It‚Äôs my favourite when I get a card I REALLY like and then I get to look at it once every 41 days while I‚Äôm digging thru my cards haha :)
---
I believe so, it‚Äôs to avoid buying stuff from vendors and reselling for more caps. Although it would be more fair to sell it for 50% similar to scrapping camp items.
---
Do you mean there's a glitch that you can mess up the quest by going to register the PA you got from someone else?
---
It's good to say know. I've thought about trying T-51b on my main, and giving my excavator to my level 53 alt who haven't had any intrest in doing the quest. Now if I were to go down there I would likely do the quest in proper order, even if Im already wearing excavator, but I can see it handy to know in case I sell the excavator to someone else, to warn them in case they don't have it yet.
---
You did a great video tour. Usually I get a little dizzy but not with yours! Great seeing the conduit used looks great, all of it! Great job! I have built alot of camps and know you put alot of time into it and it shows. Thanks for sharing it. :)
---
Making the list of what do (or did) not work well in fallout 76 doesnt make you an expert in anything...
---
And you are still confusing renderer and net code, this is terrible... you are embarrassing yourself.
---
but well.
---
I leave you to you self estime.
---
In all honesty, I enjoy this fight alot more then I do the Imposter.
---
The levelled varients of the SheepSquatch are really cool too.
---
Yeah, the legendaries I've recieved as drops haven't been all that good either. But oh well, a new mob to fight and I'm always on the look out for the *real* SheepSquatch.
---
Like my friend. Hes on the fence sbout the game.
---
It's not actually because armor isn't breaking quicker
---
Yeah, it's fucking weird.  None of the obvious explanations seem to work.  Maybe it's just a question of who the Mothman smiles upon?
---
They just need to add an approval feature for  trades (aka summary of offers on both ends with a consent layer) and a final approval layer where you can accept to reject the trade.
---
Yeah it's definitely usually another player, my fiance is rebuilding her camp as i type this because some player destroyed her camp and messaged her trying to goat her into pvp. They usually claim to be role playing as raiders to justify it, but my guess is they are survival rejects who couldn't hack it so they harass people in adventure.
---
Is it over already ?
---
i think they are focusing now on atoms tore stuff over regular game issues unfortunately
---
Thankfully, with my T-60 Helmet, I live to tell the tale.
---
I've killed a couple and they didn't count for me :(
---
no, you should stay away.  You'll just get eaten by a grue.
---
yeah it happens sometimes for me at whitesprings and used to happen a bunch at watoga, the robots would dies as soon as the doors opened to spawn them
---
im not sure  if it is still happening at watoga since i stopped going there now that there is no legendaries
---
I have separate "Guest facilities for people who stop by out on the edge of my build radius also.  This seems to have reduced the incidents of camp griefing for me at least. My reasoning was they would start with the easiest stuff first and so far I have been right.  This has also given me time to either get there and deal with them or jump servers when I realize my camps being attacked.  I am not sure how effective the no damage camp thing is going to be because I can see at least two exploits the griefers can use through the turrets to attack your camp.  It will all depend on the exact rules governing the update when it comes out.
---
I think it's poor programing that I thought on of the updates was already supposed to address, but didn't.
---
Yes. The shielded operator is a +3 strength, which is the highest.
---
&gt;  I remember it just being a single sentence. Rather hard to get much hype off that.
---
Bwhahahaa.  Hype will tend to a max until it's released, then be replaced by outrage.
---
It breaks substantially quicker, without taking damage, even when unequiped.
---
Usually about 20k a piece if you can get them for caps
---
I usually keep an eye on the vendor in The Enclave. I've gotten the plans for the jetpack xo1 there on the cheap. And several other xo1 items.
---
Well, every economy has a black market. It's just the nature of it.
---
Well I think that's a bit off, considering OP spesifically said he has teammates of some kind already.
---
But yeah I kinda get what you mean, nowadays people don't want to team up even just to quickly collect some flux from nuke zone and then go about each others merry ways. I have to equipt the streched genes and keep pumping that radaway shit to ward off the radiation.
---
No that was the only time for the checkerboard. I have had the ground look like its covered in snow or the dirt turning black as I would walk forward. Any raised objects in the ground like rocks and logs were ok, just the dirt changed color. Those both happened in the Ash Heap before 8.5 but I didn't take pictures
---
Well thank you very much. I wanted to finally try and use the conduits on this build. The placement of the Generator made it a lot easier. Also they save on budget providing both light and electrical current. Also long as you don't make the structure to large. Making large structures I see is the biggest mistake in CAMP builds. Walls/foundation take a lot of budget. The less you use, the more you can decorate! üòÅ
---
Twat.
---
No it dosen't that is absolute crap if it is true why isn't it known everywhere? Why do i never need to repair my mask?
---
They added a new quest line based on the sheep squatch and cameras. They are planning to add legendary vendors, backpacks, and two more major updates over the year. They also added repair kits that can be purchased in the atomic shop or earned.
---
Eastern Regional Penitentiary's courtyard. I find more Supermutants there have the laser rifles than the ones at West-tec. It might be due to a level effect, or might just be illusory RNG.
---
Sorry kind sir but I strongly disagree. One may play call of duty where no builds are necessery at all, just a good gun, when follow by your logic. Half fun in playing mmorpg is tweaking your character build and enjoying it.
---
All of PA has huge hidded radiation resistances. The nominal displayed values are completely bullshit. Excavator is about as good as any other PA.
---
I've not seen any new ones yet........ I'm just sat in my camp staring at the wall patiently waiting....
---
I played from beta.  I leveled to 175 before all these crazy updates came out.  I quit around Christmas because my explosive guns would always glitch.  Also they were rebalancing all the guns and damages so I stopped because I couldn‚Äôt keep a build for a week before Bethesda changed the damage output
---
I came back to the game last month and it feels so new! The gameplay and glitches that bothered me are all gone and now I‚Äôm back to blasting.  
---
I haven‚Äôt played the new update with sheepsquatch much but it‚Äôs something new so that‚Äôs good!
---
TLDR: give it another chance. It‚Äôs a whole different game now compared to 7 months ago.
---
*SheepSquatch used quill attack!* We don‚Äôt know its effect!
---
The same happened to me! I sell the spare one for 1K
---
Look, just read the responses to the people that ask this every damned day
---
It's easier to just shoot them down. More fun also. Like the prize and advertising bots that give you crap. They're good for scrap.
---
You are very welcome
---
I got my jump suits from a messenger quest near all the abandoned mansions.
---
I had an absolute blast this weekend with a new character. Teamed up with a few randoms, did loads of events with others and even stumbled upon [this sheepsquatch](https://steamuserimages-a.akamaihd.net/ugc/840394753475991004/B24C1B0FA9DD0AA29CC9E9AB6DF9A448D02E9D26/).
---
Best part was beating it on my own and getting to getting to [gloat](https://steamuserimages-a.akamaihd.net/ugc/840394753475981046/7A2F08A7D75FA05D2A7D0E7EC3CC181B708F8B1D/) over its limp body.
---
The ammo I used to take it down was preposterous but, eventually I managed to take it down but I did have a random scorched taking pot shots at the sheepsquatch so I guess I wasn't technically alone.
---
Looking forward to the next one myself.
---
There are a lot of people in the same boat as me. I have literally 1 or 2 items in the entire game that I possibly want so I will trade for that. Otherwise I pretty well won‚Äôt trade. Caps are too easy to acquire compared to god rolled items to fix the economy they‚Äôd have to slow the rate at which caps drop. Which would also piss everyone off. (Just look at when they fixed cap stashes)
---
What's 20 more levels?  If the character is one-shotting glowing ones it should be pretty easy to get to 50 quickly.  Not everyone levels their characters up with perfect efficiency, indeed most don't.  I don't see it being an issue.
---
I‚Äôm asking this because I wanted to sell it too, but I‚Äôm worried that for some strange bug I end up losing my other U-PA.
---
You obviously don't know how the cloud based servers work. The netcode is garbage. That is literally what I'm talking about when I mention "server software" I'm talking about their netcode.
---
The thing is, on most online games the majority of the calculations are done server side, NOT client side. FO76 does almost ALL calculations client side. It is obvious you are either just being overly pedantic, or you honestly don't understand how this game is coded, especially with the cloud based servers.
---
The reason I bring up the engine that is running client side is because that is the software that is doing the VAST majority of the calculations.
---
Ya exactly. It‚Äôs a straight shot and it lingers.
---
Are you saying you loot so many sentinel/cavalier items of quality that you can afford to sell them? 
---
I've seen ONE in approximately 200 levels of playing. I don't PvP but I wouldn't just sell it to a bot if i found one.
---
Because masks don't break anymore fuckface. Read the notes. And stop being a fan boy. It has issues. It isn't a perfect game. Bethesda's parent company is forcing monetary choices on them and denying it means you have no solidarity with BGS.
---
I wouldn't say Heart of the Swamp is aimed at level 1, but overall it's still a really solid idea.
---
I almost completely fixed my horrible all over the place build going from 105 to 122.
---
They go to 80+!!!
---
ok buddy
---
Thanks for the heads up, I believe he destroyed my base when it was all wooden but that was ages ago.
---
You will not, I just did it and I leaved mine in the stash and still got it. They are not linked to each other
---
Probably had full sentinel gear on
---
I don't want to level the character higher, that is the point. It increases the caps lost on death in pvp.
---
Same here. Didn't change anything, but now my guns keep breaking.
---
Sweet I'm home from work at 6:30 and find myself online all evening lol
---
I thought about doing heavy guns and pistols. Right now heavy guns still unsure on secondary.
---
I bought a quad cryolator to help speed up SBQ kills. I used it about 5 times. First 4 worked great, the 5th one it got stuck in a super slow animation which would have been great had it stayed on the ground. But as soon as it took off it was in the air for the remainder of the event.
---
Most people did the quest mayor for a day. This mission stopped the robots from being aggressive towards players. So basically just running around killing pacified robots.
---
A workshop repair with the right perk cards and place is always much better. The repair kits serve as a repair but not as well as one done in your workshop.
---
Yup pretty much
---
Lol nah not all the time, it's only something i do when i fight more than 5+ mobs at a time and i badly need AP. It's also the instinctive thing to do so the mobs won't surround me.
---
Fireproof (End) is pretty useful for dealing with explosions and scorchbeasts. Personally, I'd get rid of those food and water endurance perks. Some combo of adamantium and fireproof would make your build pretty tank-like. 
---
You might want to consider Blocker if too.
---
I was actually planning on posting this same sort of idea today. You beat me to it.
---
The game NEEDS a mechanism to keep high level players interested in exploring the whole map, and not only that, but all the events as well.  The entire Northwest corner of the map is a complete waste of time for anyone over level 50.  I'm level 136, and did the Sheepsquatch event up there today, and realized I hadn't discovered Aaronholt Homestead or any of the locations around it.  Other than that event, I have no motivation to ever be up there.
---
I think the easiest answer is the "Adventure+" option just like you said.  No changes to the game or map, just limit enemy spawns to a minimum of level 50, with normal enemy scaling otherwise.  Unlocks for players when they hit 50, but anyone can still play "standard" adventure mode.
---
It was somewhat cheap that you could farm legendaries with no real danger from all the other robots. That is the only explanation I can see for the change.
---
np!
---
It's bugged on PC. We had four people show up for it yesterday in the Mire near Watoga, just after a nearby Census Violence ended, and nobody was able to click on the tower.
---
So let me ask. We (me and mrs) both have lvl 200ish characters from prior. Do you think the content be suitable / challenging for characters of this level?
---
Hope this happens, been asking for it for months on different threads. Even made a post but got 0 attention.
---
Because it was on the punchlist right above ‚Äúfixing casual shielded so it drops.‚Äù
---
He is part of the new content üòÅ
---
So the endgame content is what has changed?
---
Got a clip of the level 45 solo imposter?
---
Borderline hard to believe, but I mainly just think that'd be pretty impressive. 
---
Stealth rifle build, or? 
---
I'm just wondering how you kept all three activated while also not getting overwhelmed by mobs.
---
Out at the cranberry bog is where I found him
---
Was able to kill it a few times with others and saved the cows only 2 times lol. Sadly after we were able to kill it the damn body disappeared on me twice.
---
Worse, I ran into a squad of people who spent the entire nukezone trying to body block me and intentionally take a hit so theyre friend could engage and kill me.
---
I know I could have turned on passive mode and I eventually did but I usually leave it off because I go to survival a lot and forget it's on.
---
Mostly just having a go because none of my friends play this game and I'm a little bitter they won't get on board, but also there's a lot of advice in these threads like "get team mates with rad spunge," oh, just never go into a nuke zone without a set team and have them all respec to do it? Sure, no problem. Or people recommending stacking legendary armor with certain properties, like sure I'll just get end game gear and *then* I'll go into a nuke zone. These people looking for advice aren't experts at the end game yet. They don't have end game gear or end game knowledge. 
---
Nah, just get in some PA with plenty of rad resist, pop rad-x if you don't care about mutations or diluted rad-x if you want mutations. Rad away as needed. You don't need anything outside of what comes naturally to you by questing or isn't cheaply available from any given vendor.
---
It will be 1AM in Poland, I'll be sleeping. We can meet at May 1st (bank holiday).
---
You can't instantly order it by trading, it's quite rare
---
i really hope this is what nuclear winter
---
Also thanks for the heads up
---
I don't know if it's a glitch-- perhaps it is. I just know that people who have skipped going into the terminal and getting the download of the excavator plans and just registered a PA that was given to them do not have the plans and can't find a way to get the plans. It doesn't prevent you from ending the quest if you wear the PA and register it, even if you haven't done the quest.
---
I was given my excavator, but I had already gotten to the part where I got the plans. I was just in the middle of collecting the resources to build. All I had to do is register the one that was given to me.
---
But yeah, if you give the excavator to someone, just tell the person to make sure to complete Miner Miracles to the end where they get the plans. And I think they should not be in the PA when they go in the terminal to get the plans, but I'm not entirely sure about that.
---
As far as I know they still only have the base mounts (excluding the wendigo mount).
---
You have done amazing things already for the community, this is just outdoing yourself. Well done!
---
Maybe because I would kill everything then start looting? Who knows. I used to accidentally sit at desks all the time in Fo4.
---
Bethesda's biggest trait has always been world building. They can design and create immaculate worlds with deep and rich lore. The mechanics of making that world work in game has *always* given them challenge. The world's depth, along with decent gameplay, made their games so good you'd look past the bugs.
---
But it's hard to look past certain bugs in an online game. The online experience is one of the *defining factors* of the game, and when connectivity becomes a problem, the entire game falls apart. Bethesda needs to refine their netcode more. It's not terrible, but it's not great either.
---
Nuclear Winter (?)
---
yeah i noticed it, i play waaaay too much so any changes are noticeable
---
Oh my, why would I laugh at that? 
---
I still use Photomode as well when I find something I want to photograph however with this photo. I actually used the recently added ProSnap Deluxe Camera that was recently added to the game. *Alot* less feature then Photomode but with it, Everyone can pull off photos like this on the fly.
---
It's all about timing and location! 
---
If you've played Fallout New Vegas, and did the quest  *"Classic Inspiration"* the Codac R9000 camera given to you during the quest. This new camera gives me nostelgic feels when I use it and reminds me of my time playing FNV.
---
I hope this helps and answers your question friend.
---
Not every twenty minutes, but I did crash to desktop six times yesterday on PC. It was a bad weekend for stability. Nearly every-time I was trying to access my inventory and it would freeze and then crash.
---
I haven‚Äôt tried yet but,  once a player unlocks it can‚Äôt they just craft one for you?
---
There‚Äôs a guy with that exact name on Xbox and he‚Äôs carried some big bounties. I can‚Äôt speak to more than that but I was surprised to see him listed on pc. PS4 folks, chime in?
---
It's better to be sure. They've added some interesting DLC. They've made efforts to fix bugs although that still needs enormous investment. They've stabilized the servers ...er...well..made them more stable at least. They added a few quality of life thing, like increased weight limit and stash limit and more weight is coming in a few weeks. PvP has it's own servers, although it's not implemented as well as it could have been.
---
However, BGS added "utility" items to the Atom shops that people are debating over. They are non-cosmetic, and some consider them pay for advantage. There's also a general debate that the end game isn't great, which I would agree with. 
---
I've taken a break until Patch 9 lands in early May. Until we get player vending and the ability to do something with bad legendary drops (both of which are supposed to be included in patch 9) I don't feel the motivation to play.  If you're on the fence, wait for Patch 9 and then give it a shot.
---
So a 25k item trade is overpaying? or is it decent enough?
---
Yes. Nice little touch.
---
Wow, really nice camp. Great job ! ! !
---
I thought the same thing.  Love the look of the weapon but attack animation looks odd
---
Thank-you friend, I'm glad you like it.
---
This.... This is why I don't hate fallout 76. This makes me happy. This is awesome.
---
This ain‚Äôt Dark Souls!    One of the new questlines has a boss tougher than the Queen.   But the rest are still easy for a high level character.   But it is still *fun.*    New snippets of storyline to explore.   And if you are into PVP the new survival mode would be challenging as it requires different builds and strategies than PVE.
---
Same thing.
---
Thanks, I'm glad you think so. üëç
---
I don't care about fusion cores. Go to whitesprings where there are those 2 sentry bots kill them, sometimes i you loot quickly before they explode you get 2 cores/sentry bot. After you kill those 2 just server hop. Rinse and repeat. 
---
10 minutes of doing that and you're set for a few days
---
Exactly,  if I‚Äôm going to Morgantown for plastic the enemies are a nuisance more than anything.  Now if I encountered some higher level ghouls or super mutants in the high school that would be more of a challenge.
---
Oh that‚Äôs interesting...
---
I‚Äôd do it if i was after the armour. That‚Äôll help insure you get it over someone else
---
It seems they also nerfed three star legendary over all after latest patch. I‚Äôve only come across a few three or two star items out of three star creatures after latest patch, most of them only drop one star melee item. It‚Äôs fun to collect legendary items, they probably realized this and want their cut, hence the nerf and possibly atoms for legendary tokens.
---
Only the event masks don't you fucking idiot i mean gasmask or the enclave gasmasks. I'm not being a fanboy I'm calling out complete bullshit that people spout.
---
fair enough, true
---
Roll with the troll.  He has a weakness, just have to find it.  Think of it as an exercise in psychology.
---
Thanks so much. I was a huge fan of FO4 settlement system, even with it's flaws. Can you tell? ü§™
---
I've heard (haven't studied myself) her damage resistance is RNG and perhaps related to # of people attending
---
Their main use in PvP at the moment is the fact that they can kill players using Sentinel as they stagger easily.  My Bloodied Explosive Laser Rifle slaughters people in full Assassin-Sentinel/Caviler.
---
Maybe they'll add floating ceilings, everything else floats.
---
Caps are worthless tho lol if you know you know
---
DUDE! That picture is sweet!
---
Guys! Remember when all those power armor pieces started disappearing? What if they‚Äôre coming back to us, better than ever!
---
When you use beam splitter do shotgun perks work with them?
---
This is great!! I use your site and I‚Äôve been glad to chat with you about how the nukecode solving works. 
---
I think I can speak for everyone when I say we appreciate the work you do to get nuke codes each week and allow for assistance solving codes on our own. 
---
Kudos!
---
Ya she seems the clingy type.
---
Using 5 pieces of sentinel armor, and a auto combat shotgun running furious so each pellet adds to the "each consecutive hit".
---
I'd thought it would be neat to have different tiers of server where players who've reached a certain level and completed certain quests would begin loading into those servers. 
---
That way any 'world-changing' quests could actually have noticeable effects on the game for those who've all completed them without having to worry about resetting for players who've yet to complete those major quests. But then I guess you'd have to consider players who've completed certain major quests early on or those who've simply leveled up without actually completing any major quests.
---
well and it also doesn't mention that, like with life-saving armor, there's a one minute cool down
---
found that out the hard way
---
It is worth returning.  The game is now stable.  And they are systematically adding new content.   Try it out!
---
There s an Irish lad ,me and another fellow countryman ,we use microphone as well .we speak English
---
Ya the probably had gear that way outclassed your weapons. It also sounds like you weapons aren't pvp suitable
---
Yep. It should feed player vending though. You sell something (non-unique) for half it's stated value, both seller and buyer win.
---
Many did get tired of it but many still remain.
---
Personally I wouldn‚Äôt want that to happen since I love running into new players and give them plans and what not and help them level up and build their camp. As for dealing with high level players who are *** I don‚Äôt really have a solution on dealing with them besides just blocking them.
---
He definitely thrives on annoying/abusing other players. It is likely that‚Äôs all he does. Idk... sociopath?
---
If you get a complete set the effects matter more than level or type.
---
 I speak English and have mic :D
---
Now I'm just clock watching :')
---
Yeah. I've got 20+ kits just already. They're insanely easy to get. I figured they'd start to build up. Same thing happened in ESO.
---
Nope. Perk packs are fuckin' dumb. Just there to light up the gambling part of your brain not actually improve your play experience. Classic skinner box game design.
---
I've gone automatics on 2 of my characters - there's no automatic receiver for a hunting rifle.  The Handmade is my primary automatic rifle, and automatic Tesla for crowd control/low mobs.  I'd rate these 2 as the must haves if you decide to go full auto rifles, both benefit from Commando perks and Tank Killer.
---
I use AA Handmade/Quad Tesla on my non-Bloodied, and Bloodied variants on my Bloodied character.  You do end up blowing through a lot of ammo but its not that hard to keep up with Ammosmith and Super Duper.  Also switch to heavy weapons especially for Scorched Earth, and most times for AWOL Armaments.
---
Hopefully that expansion will have some sort of new game mode for high-level players that *isn't* PVP nonsense (sorry PVPers I'm a PVE scrub).
---
It‚Äôs bad enough when they bug you to PVP with them but to destroy someone‚Äôs base is super annoying and never really gets them anything.  It‚Äôs just a waste of good ammo.   Yes, it‚Äôs just a game.  But there should be limits.  Hopefully the next patch will at least fix this part for people in pacifist mode.  
---
To add verbal abuse is just going way too far given that they have no idea whether the person on the other end is a minor or not.  Even though it is a game, there could be real legal consequences.   Hopefully you‚Äôve lodged a complaint with Bethesda.
---
You know Bethesda isn't going to increase weapon durability now that they are selling repair kits...
---
The messed up a lot of IDs I‚Äôve seen the ID code on a few quest markers and Brahmin rather than the real names. Lol
---
WestTek or Harpers Ferry or anywhere with a lot of super mutants. Some also suggested that if you have the plan you can make a bunch of barebone unit and scrap them to unlock everything. I haven‚Äôt tries this myself but sound much quicker than fighting super mutants
---
Your link reflects the numbers I added. And you are absolutely correct, Ultracite and X-01 are better. The advantages to excavator is earlier availability, good scaling, reasonable maintenance cost,  and doesn't require a lot of questing. You can run around, grabbing raider, then T-45, T-51, etc. but that's super tedious and somewhat dangerous at level. Once you reach lvl 50, and can manage the quest lines, definitely go after the end-game armors for nuke zones.
---
&gt;I'd rather they just remove PvP entirely from adventure mode. 
---
Glad to see someone else besides me saying it, and also delighted to so that you are getting up votes.   In the past it seems as though people were down voted into oblivion for saying such things.   Yeah I fully agree.
---
Looks like bethesda is planning to sell flamer fuel in atom shop soon
---
Make a side build. Sometimes you can‚Äôt always one hit everything. Makes teammates made when that don‚Äôt gets hit on things. Not crucial to the game, but would make it more fun in my opinion.
---
I had a level 91 next to my camp in the mire, he was definitely a fighter
---
I had a worse experience of someone trying to help that didn‚Äôt actually help last night. 
---
I have a CAMP that has a full perimeter of those concrete walls, and I had someone blow out some sections for murderholes. 
---
A rando came by later and started fixing them. Asked him to stop; he said ‚ÄúI know what I‚Äôm doing‚Äù.
---
When I told him they were there on purpose he said ‚ÄúI know‚Äù.
---
When I asked him ‚Äúso why did you fix them?‚Äù He said ‚Äúcuz I could‚Äù.
---
TL;DR I need new murderholes made on my CAMP
---
One spawned at fissure site southwest of the White Springs while I was fighting s scortchbeast and scorched. On the way there fought Mothman.
---
you shut your dirty mouth!
---
j/k but i do love me some jumpy jump action
---
you can pry the marsupial serum from my cold, dead hands
---
Yes that‚Äôs a good point. And yes I did submit a comprehensive report to Bethesda.
---
Oh my! Thank you for the kind words. I never expected my picture to get this much attention. Didn't realize Bethesda had an Instagram page, might have to give it a look.
---
I'm thinking with the introduction of the SheepSquatch, it would fall under the "Wild Appalachia" DLC arch.
---
Yeah... I want to disagree with you but you‚Äôre right. Unless you want a steady stream of stuff to trade for trading sake, you‚Äôre going to eventually get close to your perfect build. Why sell something for caps when you can swap out a godly item for your last perfect piece?
---
Starting new characters, an influx of new players, or an entirely new class of weaponry (5* gear, maybe all new perks) are about the only way I see people buying and trading the lower tier stuff as everyone levels up.
---
I went 38 to 50!
---
Sheepsquatch doesn't exist. It's a myth
---
YES!!!
---
everytime i hear the "I'm walking on sunshine" song when i airwalk
---
Thanks that explains a lot as all the ghouls we're replaced by diseased protectron with crappy low level 1* to 2*  legendarys, almost every protectron dropped a crap legendary I was filled with crap legendaries to sell it's day 3 and I'm still haven't left WS because I can't fast travel with all this crap to sell off.
---
I don't think so as far as I'm aware.
---
X1000
---
Great work. Sent a small donation your way. How do you crack the nuke silo codes? Is it a team that collects the code pieces? Do you need help?
---
yeah if you are ok with 30 foot tall mutated mirelurk queens and giant mutated bats  i think you should be ok with mutated high jumps
---
Yeah white springs has been crazy lately with the amount of 1* and 2*
---
As most people have pointed out, this is the real SheepSquatch and not the *Imposter* Sheepsquatch.
---
Also thankyou for the kind words.
---
Buy them on vendor -- Harpers Ferry. Or I can sell you the plan for 4k caps.
---
Nice keep it up just got 2 of my buddies excavator armor this weekend... all my screws are gone üò¢
---
Wait is the Free Range Event over??
---
I like having head-wear be purely cosmetic. It's yet to cause any problems and being concussed in-game is easy to fix with a stim on the rare occasion that it happens.
---
Ghouls are friggin' **boring**. I liked the robots and usually made a run around Watoga, rather than go punch buttons at WS. The burrows is just more of the same, boring bs.
---
If I remeber correctly, You're right. I had fast travelled into the area to attend to a hoard event when I was engaged  by the SheepSquatch.
---
9/10 you lose a point for not having 10 turrets.
---
Haha. Thanks. Glad you like it.
---
I am a software developer, anyway that I can contribute to the project?
---
I took portable power and swap out parts on the fly for the need, jetpack for when I need to get up high, the auto stim one is my primary to save on perk points. Calibrated shocks for if I need to carry more and the AP regen legs for if I have to Sprint alot. With portable power 3 these things weigh no more than a mini nuke or less.
---
Took me 50+ hops at the water park over two days so I sent messages to everyone on the server and posted here when I finally found him, helped about 7 people get it over the 40mins i stood there although one guy didn't check his messages and was blue that he logged off the server before seeing my message
---
i mainly get three stars from nuking burrows but i only get 1-2 stars from whitesprings
---
Oh wow, that's high praise. Thankyou very much for thinking that. Made my evening, much appreciated friend.
---
For sure. And for the record if I do happen to spend caps I do have lots to sell for caps but I have 5 characters maxed on caps. I just end up buying stupid shit. I have a junk mule that weighs over 1k from buying junk. I‚Äôm running outta stuff to get haha even pointless legendary items for the vendor. I have 600 pounds on a mule of 3 star items. Sometimes I get as frustrated as the new guys that can‚Äôt buy shit lol
---
I played with a guy who did this too.  good thign we were low level
---
They thought it would be easy way for casual players to farm legendaries even though they were rare.
---
id recommend server hooping friday or saturday nights
---
11 to 28 in like 4 hours.
---
Yeah, most of my engagements are in the Bog. Bar those I fight during "Free Range".
---
Same dude destroyed my entire base like a month ago.
---
I think that if the workshop can be contested from anywhere, then turrets should have the ability to target them anywhere.  Turrets should ignore walls and any cover that the invader hides behind. 
---
Just think about it for a second. 
---
If someone can contest the place from anywhere in the workshop,  then why shouldn't they be targeted anywhere in the workshop?  Make it so missile turrets shoot through walls or any cover that someone is hiding behind.   If they can contest from anywhere in the workshop, then they should be targeted anywhere in the workshop.    Make the turrets heat seeking and able lock on to the person contesting it so that even those hopping around with marsupial or cloaked with  stealth boys get blown so smithereens.
---
yeah its bad for me on ps4 pro with hardwired 1 tb fiber connection
---
also, of the last few patches i now get in game freeze ups when in my inventory, usually trying to eat food, the whole game freezes on that inventory screen and has to be shut off totally
---
before i just got server disconnects and blue screen CTD's, now we can add in in game freezes
---
I make and sell bulk serums to a BoS faction so to store all the mats and caps my wife and i share 3 or 4 mules, i got fed up one day and had my lvl 2 mule take marsupial, no starched genes or anything. Like you said anything less is peasant jumping.
---
Thanks for posting! What a jerk...
---
At level 25-ish, I came across a lvl 50 legendary sheepsquatch being attacked by a pack of scorched. It glitched and it was barely attacking me or the scorched, so I decided I'd take it on. Took like half an hour and nearly every last piece of ammo and grenade I had. It took so long that I had time to hit up a tinkerer bench to make some more ammo .308. It was pretty underwhelming when it was said and done though. Not sure how much damage the scorched were doing, but I'd like to think they helped out a lot. Sadly they all died by the hand of the sheepsquatch before the end of the fight.
---
Thanks for the donation!
---
There is a team that brute forces the combinations every week. IT used to be me personally but now there is a seperate group that does it every week. If you join our discord(in header of site) there is a nuke code solving channel that you can check out :)
---
I think the PC version desperately needs an implemented chat function. The way it is it just feels empty and dead to me and I finished every fallout game except tactics at least 3 times because I adore the world and the lore.
---
Can you possibly actually respond to the posts people are asking about with the nonworking challenges? Or are you under orders from the higher ups to ignore all the legitimate complaints and bugs? 
---
Because the fact that the "community reps" here only respond to the positive posts is obvious as hell and making this look even worse than the bugged challenges coinciding with the p2w repair kits as it is.
---
INCOMINGGGGG!!!!
---
Yup nothing but ghoul farming now a days. Hope legendary vendor lets us skip the hullabaloo of having to farm ghouls to get a better chance at getting good gear since still haven't found a proper 10 mm legendaries and thats with me playing since beta.
---
The easiest location, for me, was the Colonel Kelly Monument.  The tourist will be on the wooden bridge right at the spawn.
---
Agi gives 5 AP per point. Proof is watching your AP pool go up. Same with sneak rating.
---
Perception adds .4% accuracy to VATs up to a hard cap of 95%. Adds approx 12 ft to compass range too.
---
The rest has been covered.
---
*Fredrow suffers minor poison damage for 10 seconds* Nothing more than a free acupuncture session and a sharp poison jab to boot!
---
I have a 3-star Explosive Flamer and let me tell you how exciting it is to find those antifreeze bottles. I'm deciding now on what acid pit is worth moving too to sate the hunger of my Flamer. 
---
It really is a shame how difficult it is to craft decent amounts of Flamer ammunition. Even with the Rank 2 Ammo perk I can only make it in batches of x9. Meanwhile I'm cranking out loads of .308 for my Anti-Armor LMG. Crazy.
---
I wish leveling up actually meant something after about level 60. Can't wait to see what they have in store for the legendary player thing.
---
Nice job on the camp.
---
I had no idea about this. Whoops.
---
*Attempts to Matrix* Annnnd... I fail.
---
The atoms missions have been rather bad lately. Especially undoable ones like take a pic of alien.
---
I loved this event! I got all the way to 97 and I killed several sheepsquatches to boot
---
Happened to me too, some one explained to me this bug somtimes happens when a nuke dissappates and anything diseased is counted as a 1* legendaries. I grinded white springs where the ghouls turned to protectrons and litterly got over a hundred of crap legendaries luckly most items scaled to Max level, got a furious ripper which is kinda nice, and assassin wood/leather armor set which I was able to trade
---
what about to stablish a monthly "doble xp weeked"?
---
I think it was a win-win situation: many of us played more the game (as intended), new alts were created, even new accounts, everyone happy with the initiative...
---
I'm sure you have everything worked out, and far be it from me to tell another man how to live his life, but...
---
You need to negotiate a man-cave and some alone time, bro. :-)
---
*witty sarcastic comment about server stability*
---
*Fredrow is badly poisoned!* -10.HP
---
Lol, that was harsh. Forced help
---
It‚Äôs funny you should say that because I am on Xbox and I recognised the name straight away!
---
hahahahaha
---
It's worth investing in the Gun Smith and Weapon Artisan perks if you haven't already. I run a heavy weapons build and I've yet to have my LMG or even my Plasma Caster break in combat.
---
I don't think it needs careful consideration, I think any alternative to what we have currently would simply be better.. balancing and fine tuning could come later.
---
The game needs something like this if it's *ever* going to entice players like me back to the game. Whatever new content there is makes me curious, but not enough to return to the game.
---
I was leveling up my alt this weekend and had many great experiences with players helping me out.  Went to WS as a 5 and pretty well got my ass handed to me, as I expected.  Many times I‚Äôd be sitting on the bus with a sea of ghouls around me and a higher level would come bail me out, kill the ghouls I had tagged and ask if I needed water or ammo.  A guy in the resort gave me his set of raider power armor.  I ended up a lvl 21 and had the best few days of game play ever.
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/bigeay/meta_trading_posts_are_no_longer_allowed_on_rfo76/
---
This is even stickied
---
Yeah I agree. I thought PC already had a chat function?
---
I've had him too! Blocked and muted after i was spawnkilled at vault 76 at level 12 and kept getting servers with them and their friend. They aren't the only ones I run into.
---
When I made a post someone said the blocked people just show up more often, but I haven't had a chance to test.
---
I jumped in for a bit, the game felt good but I'm waiting to see what they do with the PvP beta before I put real tine in, that's my ham
---
Lame. Thank you
---
Level doesn‚Äôt really matter since as soon as they are level 50 they‚Äôll be able to equip all the good gear. I get where you are coming from but it wouldn‚Äôt work.
---
ha! its too bad you dont see the obvious connection
---
For most of them, you need corn and/or razorgrain. You can find both at the little farm next to Morgantown airport, as well as snaptail. Glowing fungus and brain fungus can be found in Flatwoods, though I'm sure there's a closer location for those.
---
Don't forget to equip Green Thumb!
---
Np. The other two trading subs have been good to me.
---
It's a trap! Or at least don't scan it when you get to that mission. Otherwise you'll lose the ability to have the plans and make your own.
---
ü§£ü§£   tik tok tik tok
---
Nope. If anyone's figured out how to complete this, they haven't posted about it. Pretty sure it's yet another impossible challenge just like the several we had last week. Not a peep from Bethesda about it, either.
---
Ooo being spawnkilled and at lvl 12 no less. Da fuq. That‚Äôs brutal. Thanks for posting. 
---
I thought you weren‚Äôt supposed to be placed on the same server with a blocked player but that‚Äôs assuming there are enough servers available to keep players separated. Maybe Bethesda needs to look into that.
---
This is like biting your own leg- Game has sh#tty trading system, lets make it against rules to post trades, so that it would be even harder for people to trade. If anything, trading should be encourage. People who say to OP that he/she is in wrong sub, should be the ones, who get banned not the ones who post trades.
---
Ran into this one walking the road north from KMAX to Red Rocket Mega Stop.  Killed him with my TSE Gatling he was a bullet sponge.  little bit up the road heard something behind me turned around had a glowing Deathclaw on my ass and no bullets in my Gatling Gun. I didn't stand a chance. DRT.
---
The flamer is not cool; a cool weapon would be the cryolator.
---
I went from 49 to 56, and played way more than I have in weeks. Tons of fun.
---
That's the trade off tho. If you want more durability, you have to sacrifice the benefits of the mods.
---
Enclave medical wing vendor
---
I‚Äôll just stay in adventure then, more rewards for killing people. Thanks bethesda
---
Well then stay in the hypothetical noob world..
---
Get on the ground! GROUND GROUND GROUND
---
This is more of a utility item. Meant to freeze opponents. Then your team does the heavy lifting
---
I would gladly, GLADLY, sacrifice almost all of the crappy park pack cards for just one reroll.  I have so many damn duplicates of useless cards.
---
Haven't seen them yet...
---
Only a mod, nothing official. So without the social component and no content left i assume that most of the ppl who are left on pc are either newcomers or ppl who would also enjoy Asia grinding games, idk :D
---
Im convinced that like 95% of the ‚Äûomg I tried this game, it is a blast and the community rocks‚Äú posters are console players who actually have a community :D
---
joined. Awesome. Thanks.
---
We shouldn't have to pay real world money for a basic ingame feature. Don't make the game tedious and have us pay a fee to fix it. Thats BS.
---
Exactly! I‚Äôve never had any dealings with him but I generally avoid people with big bounties on adventure mode. There‚Äôs usually a reason for it, and it‚Äôs never good.
---
They are sold by vendors? I thought they were SBQ drop only?
---
You can't complete it since there are no aliens in game yet.
---
One can report this to Bethesda, yes?
---
And? Eventually you'll be capped on caps, I look for any opportunity to lose/spend caps.. PvP for me is a relief for exactly this reason.
---
And no, your build isn't better than players over level 50.. whatever reasons you've dreamed up to stay lower level are just making you a mediocre player in the end.
---
Except I'd like to be able to continue to run nuke zones and other end game things. Nowhere in this game is there level requirements for any quests or places. So why shouldn't I be able to join whichever server I prefer?
---
I see your point man and that sucks. I thought FO76 would‚Äôve been booming on the PC. Have you tried r/Market76 ? It‚Äôs a subreddit where you can trade with other PC players. If you ever come back to fallout 76, I‚Äôd highly recommend using this subreddit.
---
In my original post I mention that I did report this to Bethesda, but yes I did and others I was playing with at the time did too.
---
I'm already capped on caps, I'm a trader. I'm not just going to give up my caps freely as I use them to trade.
---
Doesn‚Äôt work :(

This. Assn/sent, uny/sent, assn/cav, uny/cav are ultra rare. In 600 hours I've gotten maybe 3 or 4.

Lmfao, I love this comment. I never thought of it that way haha.
---
Theirs still alot it's just not easier. The HS, CC I've noticed more legendary spawns then before.

"Nothin' personal, kid."

Nah. That is the most raider embracing roleplay I've seen.

I‚Äôve never thought of this idea for some reason. This would be fucking awesome
---
I got mine from the landview lighthouse. I tried finding the camera naturally while exploring, but after almost a day of searching and coming up with nothing, I just started server hopping at the lighthouse. It only took me maybe 3 or 4 hops, and the body spawns at the very top of it.
---
I am having a hard time daily with just using the pipboy screen or quick access screen. It will work for a couple hours maybe 1 hour then I go to take a drink or food and the mouse freezes as does the game, computer days it's not responding do have to end it in task manager. Mind you brand new üëΩ ware desktop with just fallout 5 and 76. With a 1070 and I 7.
---
Very discouraging.
---
I mean why not?
---
lol yeah I did it the other day, still wasn't worth it at all
---
Yeah it was a nice treat. I think I went from 70 on Friday to 88 last night? Maybe I was already 75 idk. 
---
Turns out I'd misrembered or misunderstood the loot changes from a couple patches back. You can still server hop to get enemies, you just can't server hop for ground loot (like all the damn lead at Charleston fire station üòîüò≠) 
---
The only decent drop I got from running west tek was a one star bloodied hunting rifle, but still a good experience overall.
---
Yeah they were bullet sponges, luckily was able to hide in a doorway he couldn‚Äôt get through

I‚Äôve seen the community managers reply to many negative posts. They can‚Äôt just give out information. If they just give out information that wasn‚Äôt approved by the higher-ups then they‚Äôd have the same situation as the canvas bags.
---
Yis
---
Well when you take a chem while it‚Äôs active you don‚Äôt have the neg effects of addiction so if you use the perk that increases how long chems last (there are armor mods that help this too) then you are bulking out the negatives of having an addiction for longer.
---
This is 100% why, but that won't stop the subs conspiracy theorists.
---
Why thank you! It was a labor of love üòç
---
If my turrets could reach the clubhouse from thebtrain station, that'd make sense. But,i neither have rocket turrets, or turrets in general at my CAMP
---
They would rack up a huge wanted bounty, then kill each other to get rid of the status, and I assume give each other‚Äôs caps back
---
That‚Äôs great, hopefully they keep adding new events to keep u interested... I ended up failing to but got the kill
---
I went from 31-46! I was on vacation this week so I really got to take advantage of the double xp! Sad it‚Äôs over but it got me to a level where I can actually defeat higher levels without dying 10 times over. I hope they do this again just for the people who don‚Äôt get to play often so they can catch up!!
---
I want one!!!
---
You can buy almost all of them from other players for 200-300 caps each. Just head over to /r/fo76bazaar and post a request.  If you're on xbox I have adrenal reaction and twisted muscles for 250 each.
---
Why I said "people thought". The anti turret tower people aren't very smart. They basically go after any camp that is built near the whitesprings.
---
I had a blast! (Pun intended). I never saw so many nuked queens! It was great!!
---
It‚Äôs unfortunate people can game the system.
---
Woof, that‚Äôs a hundred and twenty pounds. With Power User 2, twenty can last me over a month
---
Can you point me to one of them responding about the broken challenges we currently have? Not just the camera one?
---
Unfortunately
---
Thank you! I was taking pics all over the roof, the face, the nests, the offices and getting frustrated.  Standing on top of the terminal of that blinking antenna thing is the only place that worked.
---
Great picture
---
It was great having the double XP! I haven't see the sheepsquatch or a camera yet lol.. I was able to level up to 158 from level 130! 28 levels. Hopefully we can have more double XP weekends again soon!
---
Leadership bobble head for another 5%
---
I‚Äôve never said they‚Äôve responded about specifically the broken challenges. They just have to make sure of when to tell people it will be fixed. It‚Äôs not as simple as saying ‚Äúit‚Äôll be fixed tomorrow!‚Äù
---
I like this idea, but maybe let lower levels join and have the scaling ignore anyone under 50 or something. I'd love the challenge of trying to start a fresh new character in an environment meant for 50+.
---
Because it's not 2 buttons? You still have to place every special point, you may not even have the perk cards, and  you'd have to switch weapons/armor. Literally all it does is make it easier to try new builds instead of making a new character or leveling to use the respec system already in place. Not everyone likes to have multiple characters and grinding for exp and doing the story again is the worst part of the game. It's all for convenience. At no point is it pay to win.
---
What system are you on, and are they on. Hmmm?
---
Nope, still uncompletable as of today
---
Never been a local map on ‚Äò76
---
Faster fire rate is why
---
I was in a server on Saturday night where some players coordinated a simultaneous triple nuke blast stretching from Whitespring up to the Top of the World. Then everyone in the server got together and did a mass run from the southern tip to the northern tip and I leveled up twice, made it from around level 39-49 just over the weekend. 
---
It was cool to see these high level characters helping those of us with relatively low levels. If you were there and you aided in the nuke launches or in the mass run afterwards, I love you and I hope to see you again in Appalachia.
---
There's never been an in-pipboy map in FO76
---
On PS4. Went from 60 to 73 doing silo and SBQ runs. Only played Friday and Saturday for about 5 hours a piece after work. Does it end tonight at midnight or was it last night at midnight
---
Perk loadout manager would literally make it 2 buttons, "respec" 1 button from mousewheel, then "perk swap 1" a single button press. That is literally only 2 buttons.
---
Even on semi auto?
---
Yeah I wish they would have kept it like fallout 4... u can basically become a god in fallout 3 and 4 but it New Vegas and 76 you‚Äôre just like a guy with a gun
---
All the ground babies are commenting.
---
1. Game is rated M so ‚Äúminors‚Äù shouldn‚Äôt be playing it anyways. Therefore no need to worry about ‚Äúverbal abuse‚Äù.
---
2. Destroying your base is fun, watching you cry over the mic is priceless.
---
3. Legal consequences?!?! .. hahaha!!!
---
4. Get down on the ground!!
---
I'm talking about the broken challenges, that is why I specified it in my original post.
---
Awesome. Thanks
---
Had hoped for it being a generic mod for any armor, but too good to be true
---
I saw him on xbox, he has a few friends who bounty farm and kill players. Killed him once he had a 1250cap bounty and only got 1cap out of it. Serious bad business.
---
Not possible - they seem to want us to kill a walkin-around Zeta, which is not yet in the game
---
I think the new game+ will be with the ‚Äúreset after level 50 option‚Äù with those new perk cards. Personally I enjoyed the main quest so this would be a awesome feature
---
its gone I'm sure.  old post.
---
Either auto or semi, ultracite should average same DPS with higher fire rate but lower damage
---
Just fast travel and y will find the sheepsquatch imposter much easier if you don't know where it died.
---
No way! This game is the most stable and least glitchy game ever/S (although for real I still stand by that new vegas was far glitchier and still is)
---
Ah some people made it sound like it
---
Great thanks
---
I thought they made camps immune to damage unless you where in PvP with that player?
---
They could do paragon levels like in Diablo maybe. All leveling up does for me right now is make my cost in caps upon death go up. Lol
---
Folks have tried dead aliens in a truck, toy aliens, mounted alien bust, etc - the models for Zetas are in the game (found by data mining) but they don't spawn in world yet.
---
I love this 3000. 
---
Bethesda is good at making single player games, but with 76, it's more under "games as a service" where players need new challenges and ongoing stuff to progress through. 
---
New game + just makes sense. I'd like to see more legendary enemies spawn as well.
---
&gt; Unfortunately, no picture except with my camera in-game
---
On PS4 at least pictures taken with photomode can be found in your PS4 album.  Maybe camera ones too?
---
You can complete a quest in Watoga that makes the robots there friendly towards you, thus eliminating all of the challenge. You canthen run up to a robot spawn, wait for the robot to pop up, kill the robot with little to no challenge or punishment (it takes a while for robots to become enemy, and even then the others remain friendly), and repeat to farm legendaries as much as you like. 
---
That's why they removed the legendaries there. It was way too simple to gather legendaries in Watoga.
---
Not yet. Next patch
---
Yeah I got days gone, tried it to see if I liked it (I did) but then I played fo76 all weekend
---
Days gone feels like ‚Äúthe last of us‚Äù and ‚Äúrdr‚Äù had a baby lol
---
&gt;Did a silo run after finding a server full of 100+ players 
---
You can have 100+ players on a server?
---
Ive scanned every foot with the camera and it just doesnt exist after death on most of my runs.
---
What are you looking for specifically 
---
Experiences only or personal in game thoughts about it?
---
Hey there thank you for the tag! Looking into this, it looks like this will be addressed in Patch 9. I should have more solid details for you closer to that when the patch notes start coming in.
---
Oh damn, well that bites. At least it's coming.
---
I missed our due to other responsibilities,but really wish I had a chance to play now! I'm home sick today so I'll be making some time up
---
It's also possible that you can get them in defend workshop events -- lots of people reported getting warned about Sheepsquatch waves before they were added and finding some other kind of enemy.
---
Haha, same!
---
I think its because now they have survival, its clear that adventure is for passive survival is for PVP :)
---
&gt; Yes, she gave only a bit over 1000 xp.
---
That‚Äôs fucked. One behemoth gave me over 1200
---
Thanks for the info. I got the sense he and his buddies were very intentional about being wanted.
---
This video will help you. It shows all locations for the camera spawn which starts the related quest......

---
I managed to get that picture on the roof itself, myself, next to the hole on the roof. It didn't work ontop of the junk mound- just the roof.
---
I‚Äôm at the best number right now: 
---
69.
---
Thank you for responding! I really hope it does get addressed, I really enjoyed taking photos with the camera.
---
I really hope it works by trading in legendarys for legendary tokens and than we can pay like 3 tokens for a  for a random roll, or buy effects too
---
I checked today and it was back to regular XP
---
I like the mutations but.....I think we should only be able to have 3 at a time. It would be more interesting I think.
---
Agreed, it is refreshing to see someone take it in stride for a change.
---
So who did you bet on?
---
i love the world building that bethesda does so much i bought skyrim just because they made it, i knew nothing else about it except it had dragons and in the end loved the game but you are core mechanics like connectivity need to be spot at launch not still having problems 6 months later
---
Inflation isn‚Äôt the issue. Rarity is. If there were literally only 6 &lt;widgets&gt; in the world, but these widgets were the absolute best you could have to do your &lt;job&gt;, what do you think their value would be to people with deep pockets? 
---
 If any of you played WoW back in the old days, think of it like Windfury or Sulfuras, except obtaining it was pure RNG, and it didn‚Äôt bind to you. How much do you think someone would be willing to buy one for, if you found one? The absolute best weapon in the game?
---
Is it a TSE? That's kind of the trade off for those weapons. They cause a lot of weapon damage while being fired. My TSE minigun full modded breaks at a significant rate than a minigun with the same mods.
---
Complete agreement.... the twitchy camera and trouble with the game registering what we are taking a pic of is working is really frustrating. Wasting a lot of film and trying to figure out the sweet spot of where to take a pic and when it registers correctly with the camera and trying to find the right spot at locations that it will count. A lot of work. Ontop of it we have the challenges getting really specific and complicated. Behemoth and mutant hound in the same frame? Watoga municipal center roof only counting when on the terminal? Taking pics of players in specific outfits and fighting specific rare spawns? Come on.

---
I'm pretty sure you exchange DMG against all enemies for a buff against the scorched
---
I look everyday and make at least 4 server hops and I've yet to see a single calibrated shock mod appear in the enclave bunker, but I'm hopeful that someday.  Till then I'll run my T60 with calibrated shocks and have my backup excavator also with shocks when things get too heavy.  My X-01 armor may never come out of the stash box.
---
Ach, missed that in your post.  That's what I get for posting from work ;)
---
Yeah I made a new character specifically for survival as a heavy gunner build and in the 62 levels I've had with him I think there were maybe 2 times where I wasnt killed instantly maybe 6 times where the person was visible (either legendary armor or stealth boys) and the only person I managed to kill was someone who tried running at my minigun head first with a sledgehammer. I really wish bethesda would try and balance it at least alittle. Almost every gun just shreds through people like they're paper. I'd be fine if it was like that without gear but it's kind of ridiculous when I wear ultracite power armor and die in one short burst of someone's explosive handmade.
---
I don't know, I honestly felt like it was kind of pointless. Leveling has never been a problem in this game, most people already have level 120+ characters. 
---
What I would have rather seen that would have been cool was a temporary map wide drop buff. Not a big one, like a 20% increase in drop chance, or increased legendary spawns map wide.
---
they should have one every month, at the least. And every holiday, and every in game holiday, and to go along with DLC/new content releases. It gives more incentive to play.
---
Playing vending will fix most of this. 
---
Right now there is only a small percentage of people that play FO76 who actively trade on Reddit or in-game because most of us are introverted and don't want to deal with people, or deal with the xtra work it takes to market items. 
---
It is far easier to sell to robots so you can get back to playing the game. Even easier if you are at almost at cap limit, and have a full stash, to sacrifice that rare legendary you can't use for a measly 10 caps. 
---
Side Note: Since they move all of the vendors to whitesprings it pays off to check each vendor. I have seen some pretty awesome stuff for sale, especially after a nuke zone. 
---
For some people that trading and marketing in FO76 is the game. Not so much for the majority however.
---
Once that factor is taken out of the equation with player vending, you'll start to see those items that are being sold off or traded at high value start to drop as people realize that to make caps they'll need to be competitive. With player vending everybody is now a trader and the people who would unknowingly shed high value gear, or dump stuff on robots because they just don't care, will be in direct competition with the market as it is now.  
---
Once you have 5-6 different choices of easily accessible rare items through player vending, the prices will naturally drop and the value of the cap will increase. We will also start to see less of a need for price checking as the value of certain items become far more stabilized.
---
What they really need to do is eliminate the cap limit, although keeping it will help keep value artificially low so people aren't hitting their limit, and will allow for only serious traders with alts and secondary accounts to shine by having a greater limit to work with. 
---
I can very well see these serious traders hitting up all of the player vending machines, buying up a ton of shit, and then reselling using their marketing talents across their many characters. We would be very well on our way to a true economy... sort of lol
---
However, without another cap sink (maybe the player is taxed when selling items thru vending, like maintenance costs?) and everybody selling their shit the biggest complaint is going to be hitting that limit and having to go back to just dropping stuff to free up space.
---
have they fixed so it shows the most recent players first, i'm on ps4 but we have the same thing
---
I agree I meant someone that gave me a badass legendary shotgun, it allowed me to hang with the big boys for a bit lol
---
Nighttime is brighter now.  If you're an Roleplayer that liked the atmosphere at launch, that may not sit well with you.  Lots of new content to play with though, and lots of launch bugs were fixed.
---
why's this downvoted so much
---
Yeah that didn‚Äôt work for me, only on top of the antenna structure but glad it worked out for you!
---
Absolutely. I've been hunting down these reports and sending them over to be investigated and tested. Once I get some solid answers I'll be posting in those threads as well. I just didn't want to post until I had something of value to comment with.
---
Oh no, I know this. But I have full characters from Cap and item mules. I also don't prefer to have more than one main character.. Just my preference. Plus I knew my transition would be permanent anyways.
---
Me. ;)
---
I have a bloody meathook that does about 2500 damage and Ninja (x3 damage), so I snuck up behind it and offed it with one hit.  The scorch beast flew off then and I wasn't able to hit it.
---
I found my camera mission at sweet water
---
Kind sir:
---
1. Maybe not as massive but definately multiplayer online role play game.
---
2. Indeed has respec but way to slow. Some peoples have to work to support family and dont have as much time to relax and ‚Äúgrind‚Äù. I am more casual player as I guess quite few peoples is these days. But I wouldnt mind to try different playstyles to add variety, refresh game and enjoy it at every aspect.
---
3. Any game with rpg elements has respec option, and its rarely so slow to achieve.
---
Yeah its the odd ingrediants i need a closer resource location for
---
Nice, thanks but location isn't the problem, it's finding one that spawns the god damn camera lol
---
I got my first lock picking card from a perk card pack - and it was Master Picklock.  So I had master before I had the first basic Picklock and/or Expert.  Aside from that, I believe most of my perk card packs have been duplicates.
---
I soloed 5 of the bullet sponges at different locations around the map, but haven't done the event yet. Also leveled my main from 160 to 168 and in my spare time took my new melee character from 5 to 15 (survival points x2 FTW)
---
\+karma
---
Heavy combat is as ugly as shit and not much more DR than heavy leather, which is way better at ER.  But if you're going legendary you should just throw together the effects you want and wear a clown costume over it.
---
i now ignore most of the map when looking foe events to join because the enemies are too weak
---
no, I know what happens most of the time 
---
People using TSE'S and grenades make it fly off the map
---
It's a really cool idea, but I fear that with all these separate modes we'll be fragmenting the community too much. I understand why we'd want separate pve and pvp servers, but having separate servers for every possible preference could end up being a major mistake. I'd rather see people be able to better shape the game to their preferences within the existing modes rather than dividing and further dividing the community across many different modes and servers.
---
1 ticket for the Mothman's  express to the lighthouse please ....ü§£ü§£
---
No prob
---
Just walk to the location. If it spawns in, you'll be notified. I don't know if you need to literally walk there vs. fast travel, though.
---
I would love more frequent incentive weekends. Not just double XP overall, maybe double XP ghouls or Scorchbeasts. Maybe a double flora weekend where everyone has green thumb (would be great for springtime)
---
Killed two sheepsquatches this weekend, one in an event and one that I just found out in the wastes. Good stuff!
---
It looks realy cool üòé
---
Cool. Good thing literally no one fucking brought that up then huh? Also perk loadout manager wouldn't work because you'd still have to place special points and again a melee build wouldn't have riflemen perks. You literally just made up another mechanic just to try to justify your bullshit arguement.
---
the mire and cranbery bog are the only areas that are aimed more at higher level players but they are small areas compared to the rest of the map
---
No worries! I got the automated report email from Bethesda, and I made sure to respond to it. So they definitely saw it.
---
This weekend was mainly spent doing trades and ammo sales.......somehow I managed to go from a level 96 to 117.  I can live with that.
---
I encountered a lvl80 Legendary Noxious Sheepsquatch.....wasn't ready for it, but still won after seven minutes.  
---
Only did one Cryptid event.....yesterday.  Got a mascot mask!
---
Defeated one during a brahmin hunting event. Luckily tons of people were there + my rifle/explosive build did the job nicely.
---
Awesome job, i love the camp settled like village, have one myself, not so big :)
---
That's the problem though, there is no single "best" weapon in the game. There are preferred effects, and preferred combinations, but people lean heavily on Legendary effects when really victory is mostly determined by perks and the player's individual skill. When I started it was TSE, and that was post nerf. Then it went to AAE. Then BE. Now it's faster fire rate. So you get people with max caps on all 5 characters and suddenly anything with those letters in front is worth 25k+. Mostly because you have to hope that you find someone that has one and is willing to part with it through channels outside of the game. If there was a mechanic in game that allowed a player to display their wares to all players across the game, and then those players could buy the weapon remotely and have it mailed to them (or delivered via Mr. Handy or Cargobot even) then the economy would definitely level out, because supply could catch up more easily with demand. I know they want to make this game as unique as possible, but sometimes they are doing so at the expense of functionality.
---
The only issue is that what so we do after that? No reason to grind for legendaries means no reason to play by the endgame. I mean grinding ghouls to get better guns to grind for more guns is kinda all there is left to do.
---
I still havent seen my first Behemoth
---
I started my present char like a pistols+rifles build without using VATS  except for highlighting enemies. Had 1 point in Luck, and used manual aiming, also had 2 perk cards for the 2-handed melee. It was a mess i guess. My present "adventuring build" is this more or less and works pretty good : https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=4f245bf&amp;d=sd0su0so0sp0p02pd2pk2pp2pr2eo1c72ig2ir0i10a72an2a02a40am0ld2lr2l71l11lk1lv2&amp;w=&amp;n=Rifles+shotguns crits bu&amp;m=1cf
---
They also break incredibly fast.  There is just no reason to use them because they are a chore to maintain and deal very little damage.  And the projectiles tend to be duds from time to time because they do no damage and sorta disappear.  It is mostly noticeable with the Fat Man.
---
I wanted to use a Missile Launcher with the Targeting System to take down Scorchbeasts but they seem to be immune to explosives.
---
Thanks. It was a great weekend in game. üòÅ
---
I stumbled upon a legendary Sheepsquatch by accident and spent 10 minutes killing it. I found a cliff he couldn't get up to and used canned dog food to re-up health every so often from his ranged attacks.
---
PC player here Nah, I have seen WAY more. Seen way more legendary in general. There are Lucky servers though. Hop a few times go to a few spots where legendaries are if you see not server hop.
---
it happens sometimes, it's just if people see the post before too many more posts get added and it ends up at the bottom of the page
---
The weight rooms in the nuke silos are a really good place aswell
---
I didn‚Äôt get to play much but I still jumped 15 levels. People were doing stuff on the servers again. Nukes were getting launched left and right, and even the minor quests had multiple players of all levels showing up. The game was like it was when it first came out in that regard, and it was nice. I even managed to find and kill 8 of the unruly golfers by some minor miracle.
---
Superfluous, not redundant. And you are still wrong. The post clearly references the explosive effect blowing the body away. There is no "even if what I said were true", because it is true.
---
Leveled  10 levels (112-122) killed 2 sheepsquatches and 2 imposters and got loot from both. (Thank you whoever figured out the camera view thing) got the animal friend wasteland wishiper perks( time to find a pet) and found some choice legendies. Totally awesome weekend. Thanks Bethesda not /s
---
Had that yesterday doing a quick WS 'loop' while the server shutdown timer was ticking.
---
I did however find a 3* among the 'rabble'.
---
Unsurprisingly I got a drill from him.
---
But I did get a TS harpoon gun so I have that going for me I guess.
---
They're all over, either choose one spot and server hop 5-6 times or just wandering around a whole server, and you'll get it.
---
I honestly walked into many workshops by accident and got wanted due to that old bug where merely walking in front of the red workbench for workshops would trigger a bounty on you.
---
By .4% do you mean 4/10ths of 1%?.....or 4%?
---
If Perception adds 4% per point and hard caps at 95%.....that would mean that you don't gain any benefits to Perception after 24 points. This would mean that full sets of Unyielding armor and +1 Perception weapon/armor perks would be undesirable past 24 points.
---
PvE dungeons aren't competitive.
---
Well this is fucking shit. I had to do work all weekend to ensure I didn‚Äôt have to take my finals this week and now I don‚Äôt have shit to do but play fallout and double xp is over
---
I managed to level up 20 times. I‚Äôm now level 105! I ran the burrows tons of times lol
---
Such as? I'm not in front of my PC, but I can try to help if you know what you're looking for.
---
yeah if the whole map was 50+ it would bring people back to areas they might not have been since level 20 and open up new locations for camps and bring in new events for those areas
---
Both. The experiences are important for the piece, but so are the ways they've shaped how players see the game, its potential for growth/improvement moving forward, etc.
---
It never disappears completely the first few minutes to my knowledge. But the sheepsquatch imposter always dies with the stealth on after the last patch making it hard to find, specially if the body flies far of when killed.
---
Don't forget tarberry in the pool behind the vault tec building :)
---
At Morgantown next to the Airport is a row corn and in direction of the Pub there are some raizorgrain.
---
Also Aaronholt is an option - bit further away - but has cranberry, corn, honey and razorgrain.
---
The theoretical reason, provided there is a reason and it's not just a bug or an oversight, is that once the protectrons become passive it's almost quite literally just shooting fish in a barrel for legendaries. I think the better solution is to treat the Watoga bots like Whitespring bots and an attack on one is seen as an attack on all. Meaning ofc that once you aggro one bot the rest stay aggro'd at you for like an hour or so or until you switch worlds, whichever comes first.
---
It needs to go back to king of the hill and the capture ring.
---
Yup got to hate that accidental click on furniture.
---
Both ones I found in the wild and KRIEKE!
---
THEY BE FIGHTERS!
---
Hi uh I don't know if you're aware of this or not and sorry if I'm bothering but there's a major glitch regarding the camera 
---
Basically while in third person if you use the heart emote and or others with the camera out it sends you flying across the map and past barriers in certain instances 
---
Just wanted to share this again sorry if am bothering.
---
I killed the sheepsquatch at the event in two different locations numerous times and in the wild stumbled upon and killed FOUR of them!  
---
I also leveled 29 times. I was committed!
---
They are literally the only currency in the game lol. What kills me is people will have one that has less than perfect legendary rolls and they will "only trade for the best weapon in the game"
---
ROFL, yes the perk load out manager will place special points if you have them already set up in the loadout on n&amp;d.
---
As for melee not having rifleman perks? Uh, you realize you can still get the perks without using them right? You absolutely can get the rifleman perk cards and not equip them. Especially if you were building around using respec kits.
---
If ya need lead check out Lucky Hole Mine. If ya use the Escavator power armor you can walk outta there with 100+ lead ore pretty easily. Make sure to spam X on the more veins, you can gather em more than once if yer quick enough.
---
IMO They should have made the robots act like the WS robots. Friendly until you go hostile to any one at which point they all become hostile. All they did by removing legendaries was the leggy grind, you can still go around killing the bots for easy exp. Changing the hostility parameters would've taken care of both issues.
---
You‚Äôre a boss. Came here to see if it was bugged before wasting too much film.
---
You clearly dont know lol

If rad sponge isn‚Äôt an option try hazmat suits or rad shield. Hazmat usually has more rad resist than PA but no DR, rad shield adds 300 rad resist for a few minutes.
---
I've heard some people have encountered Zetans during the beta (not the Flatwoods Monster). Supposedly, they are rarer than cryptids.
---
This has been a concern since before the beta. And there must have been a few dozen posts like this since that time. But, happily, you‚Äôll have no worries once they complete the beta. The developers have stated that they will separate the two modes and require new characters to be created. And they are looking to the idea of ‚Äúseasons‚Äù which will also require brand new characters as each season begins.
---
There are SO many different posts and threads about this but NOTHING that I can find describes the whole budget/pet experience. Also I have YET to find anything that I can actually tame. It's so frustrating.
---
PC here too (not that it necessarily matters).  No shortage of 3 stars, same as they were before (not that that's a lot).
---
The 'lucky servers' thing seems to be real.  I've heard about it before, I've definitely had instances where ghouls were dropping a lot more (mostly 1 star) legendaries.  I didn't ever go out into the wide world to see if that persisted though, did you continue to find that same thing outside the greater WS area?
---
everyone is in the server at the minute but if you gave level 200's the chance to go onto a higher level sever i bet most would go and that would leave the lower level players to carry on without as much hassle
---
Melee?
---
The end game gets better with most every update though. Probably won't have a great end game until vault raids
---
great community bar none
---
I had a bunch of 200+ guys show up at watoga station while I was looking for plans at the vendor and dumped TONS of plans into the blue suitcase I got 8-10 I didn't know including some of the sheepsquach weaponry. Thanks guys!
---
I believe they said a change for the flamer ammo crafting amount is coming with Patch 9.
---
It disappears completely and instantly for me and my friends on ps4
---
While we're at that too let's remove all the diary posts about people quitting the game too!
---
Yea that would of actually been a better idea. West Tek has gotten too bad with disconnection issues. Most time game crashes going inside. WS shows three star enemies and drop one star. So I hated to see them stop another grind place stop spawning legendary.
---
But then it would be harder to go claim power cores from noobs who didn‚Äôt lock the resource generator! ü§£üòú
---
Or just make a few loops at Watoga and pickup all the beers and liquors sitting around.  
---
I haven‚Äôt made one single thing for the Biv dailies.  Even though the quest says ‚Äúdrink a fresh‚Äù you can drink ones already on you.
---
The rarer challenges I have gotten from previous quests so I already had them in my stash.
---
That wouldn‚Äôt level out the economy, because supply would not catch up to demand. That‚Äôs why I said it‚Äôs a rarity problem. The chances of getting any specific legendary/item combo is like 1/500,000. Now, I don‚Äôt know the player count, but for the sake of argument let‚Äôs say there‚Äôs 1,000 people looking for that specific combo. There would need to be half a billion *3 star legendaries* killed to satisfy that demand. 
---
But this is why I have high hopes for the legendary vendor. If it allows us to reroll or even straight up token-buy what we want, it eliminates all that insane rarity and RNG
---
Aw man I wish I realized today was the end
---
:(
---
I got a few levels and found a sheepsquatch fighting some mole miners
---
Only got a spear
---
Bolt action and pipe revolver takes both rifleman and gunslinger dmg perks. Requires rifle type stock I believe.
---
I run 13 Int, 5 smith, 5 Demo, 3 Nerd Rage.  Demo is really powerful for shotguns and how explosive works per pellet.  If anyone would like to see my build let me know.  Running 100% PA makes it a cheaper build as you don‚Äôt have to shop for expensive Unyielding or sent gear.  Shotguns are not buffed by legendary gear so it‚Äôs not needed. (I don‚Äôt run crit build).   My guns are pretty expensive thou. 
---
My sniper uses a AAE Handmade and I worked demo into that build as well.  Although he‚Äôs much lower level and not as fun (subjective) as my shotgunner.
---
I went up 20 levels just grinding workshops to keep up with my ammo.
---
Solo'd a sheepsquatch outside white spring. I ran toward the robots and jumped up on a roof. Chipped him away in a minute. 
---
Also lucky me and unlucky other guy. When my ammo was super low a rookie tried to steal my shop in survival.  I used my chameleon armor and 2 long shots to get him. He dropped so much loot lmao. I took it all so he wouldn't try for my shop again. 
---
Great run. Just wish I could make friends on my server but they too busy killing each other for hours. That shit storm went near my camp for a while too.
---
I have a character with 1700 lbs of legendaries, most of which are junk or 1 star. I vendor stuff like cloaking or the mutant slayer/ghoul slayer. But I keep every anti armor/bloody/explosive/two shot variant I find, as well as low level legendaries.
---
We just really need a way to stabalize and centralize the economy. A proper market or auction house, and a way to ship items to other players without having to be in the same server or even in game.
---
I‚Äôm pretty sure they know about it, but thanks for letting them know anyways! :)
---
It definitely does affect xp.  I'm sorry to say, you're just wrong on this.  I get around 385 for a 68 mutant warlord.  I take off the unyielding it is under 300.
---
True so I was hopeing they would add two things into this game
---
1) Collection Book
---
I would love a collection book that tells me what Im missing for mods, weapon/armor blueprints, and camp items as that would give me something to do, could even tie it in with pioneer scouts storyline. 
---
2) Companions in form of either our alternate characters or dogs
---
Let our alternate characters stay at camp and protect it, thus give us a reason to make out our alternates plus make our camps feel alive. I would even pay atoms each month for it. Even a dog companion would be fine if we can lvl him up.
---
But yea we really need more proper dlc for this game or its not going to last long.
---
Our economy ONLY has the black market lol. We just need a way to streamline it and make trading more accessible and efficient.
---
I mean datamining the information has already explained exactly what the issue is. This camera challenge is looking for an NPC with the type tag "AlienRace" which currently isn't implemented in the game and only are found on the 4 Zetan(base,lieutenant,general, and starlord I believe are their prefixes) NPC's planned on being added in a future patch. 
---
It has been like this for the entire week, making that entire challenge completely impossible to collect. Much like the previous weeks challenge requiring pictures being took with the camera before it was added to the game as well.
---
What other information do you need and how will this be remedied? Will we be getting the atoms we were unable to collect credited to us, or add these challenges onto the challenges for next week so that we have the opportunity to complete all of them?
---
I use a TS crystal cryolator in boss battles, I don't remember ever being frozen maybe slowed. but I think i slowed down other players by accident. It's a great help in big battles but no one wants to do it, because it eats up ammo which is a pain to keep up with because of the crystal. And it's hard to aim and keep on target since it takes up a 1/3rd of your screen. I usually have unstable isotope, electrically charged and plague and reactive plates to deal with minor nucinces while I focus on the slowing the big guys.
---
Ammo increase for the Flamer an Cryolater is supposed to come in Patch 9.
---
the balance in this game feels off anyway because so many of the events and areas lean so heavily towards lower players that it feels like i could just walk around most of the map with a normal 10mm pistol and just one shot everything
---
I loved it! I leveled my heavy gunner BOS alt build from 46 to 80 - it still required me playing FO76 all weekend. It was hard, but I was able to make the sacrifice! ;) I hope Bethesda does it again soon as I'm already planning my next build.
---
The game is fun to play, players take things unnecessarily seriously but the game is fun in most aspects, there's going to be more content for the game fairly soon which people are excited about 
---
In turn Bethesda has made the game enjoyable despite limits and are currently investigating issues on a regular basis.
---
The community itself is *Acceptable* for an online community nobody is nice most of the time (minus a group of germans I play with a lot) 
---
The game is nice for a fallout game and the lore is amazingly complicated for this game only and brings a lot of discussion and real world elements into the game.
---
I enjoy fallout 76 and my experiences have been pleasant so far.
---
I think the growth of the community Is unchanged which is unfortunate due to me wanting to make friends.
---
Game is fun, has it's ups and downs but is still fun to play alone.
---
Hope this is what you're looking for.
---
Agreed, and in every other online RPG it works that way. Bethesda is trying so hard to be bnb unique, but it's at the expense of functionality.
---
Good look, bruh. I'll have to check that out later. I'm not really hurting for lead with my camp on top of a node with an extractor set up, but this does give me freedom to move out again aha.
---
PS4, should have said that. 
---
I‚Äôll make OP one for free, and if anyone else can get the supplies, I‚Äôll make more. 
---
Can‚Äôt afford the flux for a lot at one time.
---
It‚Äôs way more stable than it used to be, and I am not nice to the game- I alt-tab out a lot to browse the web, and I‚Äôm also running 2 clients at the same time, which definitely makes it cranky. But I get far fewer full on crashes. Even on the (now very rare) times when the client starts getting very laggy during big fights like The Imposter/Queen, that used to be a guaranteed crash. Now, it usually recovers after a bit.
---
Seems legit if it's on one server session. If they cross servers, then it's an issue.
---
Has anybody tried taking a photo in the medical center near Charlestown? There‚Äôs an homage to ‚ÄòAlien‚Äô on the operating room table (Jangles is John Hurt and the toy alien is, well, the Alien.)
---
The OP said CLOSE to white spring, NOT in white spring.
---
If the OP put their camp directly next to a spawn point, yeah I agree trash it.
---
But if the OP was considerate enough to make their camp available to others I don‚Äôt think they‚Äôd put it right across the golf course.
---
To the OP, Please advise.
---
ok so if the player thinks they can handle the higher mobs let them in with a warning that all mobs are at least level 50 like we get for survival mode
---
Laser pistols/rifles are the same thing, so just changing the stock on them. So farm mid-high level super mutants.
---
Add me, PSN SupaFlyEbbie. We're not an actual group but a conglomerate of friends who like to launch triple queens at least once a week
---
 Close.  It's  10 base.  Herd mentality and a couple of the unyielding pieces have extra int.  By my calculation, the highest possible would be 46 before mentats.
---
I think heavy explosive weapons should deal extra damage for direct impact, currently there is a glitch that causes it to do less damage when it hits the target directly
---
So I left a 3 star TSE flamer in a trashcan once, I was overencumbered and just needed to get back to Watoga. I still have my TSE Cryolater &amp; TSE Tesla though.
---
So I have  a question: does an explosive flamer burn at all or just do explosive damage? I mean, on the TSE flamer I had, all I saw was explosive bullets, never saw a flame coming out... same with the other TSE legacy weapons. All I see is the explosive part, not the freeze or electricity
---
Why is this a thing?
---
But I'm looking for one to run today m8, still down to add you tho
---
i honestly didn't understand half of this but it sounds like a good idea anyway
---
Next patch they will fix camp damage when in pacifist mode, this way the griefers can destroy the camps in Survival only.
---
I just want higher level servers balanced for players level 100+ I want to fight actually tough cryptids
---
I saw one near Whitesprings while doing Rose's quest. It didn't attack me, and I'm only lvl19 so I wasn't going to force the issue. Then a few moments later, it was aggro'd by a group of ghouls which it promptly destroyed. 
---
The model is cool af.
---
I agree with that for the most part. The only part I question, mostly as a game mechanic, is the vending itself. It's been pushed back a few times now, but the original announcement was that it would be a machine at your CAMP, which means unless people were online and logged in, and you were on their server, you wouldn't be able to see their inventory. Which, to me, would lead to a lot of server hopping, and with that comes more server instability. Which this weekend was absolutely ridiculous for lag and crashes.
---
It just might happen tonight friend, but I can never tell until I see everyone online. 
---
See ya in the wasteland, I'll holler if it happens.
---
Same thing, was disappointed at launch so I've been grinding RDR2. Now I'm Maxed on what I want on Red Dead: Online and there's no new content yet so I popped in FO76 this weekend and me and my son had a blast switching off and messing around. Glad they fixed the bugs from the beginning and adjusted stash sizes, etc.
---
But overall to answer your question, it's worth it to try again!
---
/u BillTheInsomniac this was meant for you lol, wrong button.
---
Nobody buys them lol
---
Starting basis was the Prima Guide and locations I found myself.
---
I got one of the missing Lookout towers added, and if there are additional items, please let me know
---
i have played ESO and the combat in that did feel much smoother and more even with players of different levels joining a fight
---
It‚Äôs rare but yea this happens to cryolator users and you can only fix it by logging out and in which is annoying when you own workshops, I had one this weekend in fact.
---
I don't understand what you're getting at.
---
From experience it seems to do both. Imagine lobbing explosive napalm. I still see flame effects when it impacts and often (when it doesn't outright obliterate enemies) it will set them on fire. Mine isn't a 2-Shot though (I got a Suppressing Flamer with the Explosive and Rapid Reload traits), so that might possibly affect how it fires. Idk.
---
That'd be good, then you could have all the lurks covered in nets, or with nets in them when they die, to show how fucked up modern fishing has become
---
No, played since stress test
---
Also imagine how fucked the economy would be if all of these items weren‚Äôt duped to shit? These items would literally be unobtainable. The only reason they are somewhat obtainable is due to exploits otherwise there would probably be like 50 tses in the whole game. Etc
---
Why I said elsewhere further explaining, someone probably THOUGHT it was a turret tower. The anti turret tower people aren't very bright, so it doesn't take much to confuse them. I mean they are anti turret towers, so they have to be pretty dim. 
---
Like how dumb does someone have to be to not know how to use someones turret tower. Literally just throw a molotov on the ghoul horde, that will tag all of them. Let the turrets kill them, then collect the drops. Saves you ammo because the turrets don't use ammo.
---
I see he made you a ground baby too, he made me one and capped my wurkshop even though I was in pacifist !!! WTF?!?!  I'm pretty sure he's created an account on all platforms to maximize the influx of ground babies!!
---
Not saying duper‚Äôs are good but the inflation would be real then.
---
I‚Äôd really like to come home, put my armor in it‚Äôs station, run around and do all my stuff, and jump back in my armor and go, I know it‚Äôs not that important, but it would feel really good.
---
 According to the psn trophy stats, slightly less than 4 percent of player accounts have a character who made level 
---
I figured it would be much more than that myself.
---
I haven't been playing since launch but I've had alot of good experiences with it so far and I've only been greifed twice. 
---
I honestly started out in the anti 76 camp. I had heard nothing but negative things about it at launch so I thought I'd skip it entirely. But as I watched it slowly get fixes and updates my mind started changing. On a whim I rented it to see how it was coming along. After a weekend of playing with some of my freinds who were also skeptical about it we decided that in a lot of ways it is exactly what someone would want in a fallout game. Granted I still have some issues on the business side of the choices being made for the game (please take the repair kits out of the atom shop and just make them dropped loot....and not just on high level enemys. That's a poor business model and will wind up hurting Bethesda in the long run) but on the gameplay side of it I really enjoy it. It's the first fallout that I can make my avatar and build the way I always wanted to.
---
I am XB1 in Europe but I set my system to connect to American servers because I want to play the game with other Americans
---
Rather have the explody mini gun vs my explody LMG. 
---
I need a sign for my power armor "Will XXX for 308 ammo!"
---
Fight for the rights of every man (except commies)
---
Oh hey, cool - that's our market! I guessed from the headline, then the picture confirmed: this is the vendor market a few of us [ran last night](https://www.reddit.com/r/Market76/comments/bika8n/xb1_h_9pm_pacific_flatwood_market_3_live_vendors/) (and have been running pretty regularly for a while now). That's my booth in the middle there! We're usually in operation on Sunday evening, but it depends on our availability.
---
We often put a post up on the market subreddit, then send punny messages based on usernames to people already in the server, inviting them over - the world usually fill up quickly and the lines start forming. A small but fun few anecdotes about the guy in the picture trading with me: he realized he had cut in line by accident then scooted off to to the side before getting back in line - it was this perfect little 'whoops' moment of politeness. He also had a lot of legendaries above his level, and kept offering them for very few caps, so I kept pricing things he wanted from my inventory for cheap, and we traded a bunch of fun things that way.
---
Some griefers also rolled in and destroyed the base repeatedly, but even that ended up being pretty entertaining. We put ourselves on pacifist so they couldn't really do any harm or interrupt trades. And when they got bounties, customers would kill them. At one point, this one customer stripped down to his underwear (no armor) then proceeded to slaughter the entire griefer team. Everyone gave him a big thumbs up. While everything was literally falling down around us (roofs crashing on our heads, etc...) people either just traded calmly on pacifist or fought the griefers. Crazy, but fun.
---
That's what I thought too. I don't remember what the increase is.  
---
If the normal and prime rifles had the same overall DPS then why would you put the effort/ammo cost I to getting prime?
---
You can disable it in .ini files if you're on PC - in the \[Interface\] section one or both of these lines will do it (I have both):  
---
bDoRadialBlur=0
---
iRadialBlurLevel=0
---
At level 53 you‚Äôre just getting started, just give yourself time to enjoy everything the game has to offer, not just grind all the time.
---
XD
---
Sounds interesting. I'm sure there are plenty of great stories here, but you might also want to try the filthycasuals sub as well. Many there are super high level and extremely dedicated to Fallout in general, but just get tired of all the complaining/raging that happens over here sometimes. There's even a West Virginian professor over there who gives in-game historical tours and such (I wish I could make it the times when she does them).
---
If you read the OPs update, his camp is outside the WS Train station..
---
i started with level 50 because thats what the game considers endgame but anyone could join the as long as they knew that all enemies would be 50+
---
It would make it easier for people to post things that they've found for sale. I've seen ridiculous amounts of weapons with preferred rolls at vendors, I usually snatch them up for resale.
---
From what I understand, the legendary vendor will let us select one specific roll we want, and we will have a higher chance of getting that specific effect, plus whatever else happens to roll.
---
I love your site, and it has made the game a lot less stressful, is there any chance you will release a mobile app? I would personally love it, anyways keep up the good work man
---
That'd be great with me. Just don't want to see smurfs get locked out just because some choose to play differently. This game is too easy as it is, have to put restrictions on yourself to make it fun. Otherwise we'd all be running around in t-51b's swinging bloodied 2h's.
---
What time do you jsually launch?
---
I'm chronically overencumbered. Would be happy to make my way down to watoga in advance. 
---
Seems like the launches I see are often around 11 Eastern Time, which is later than I want to start a queen battle.
---
I am on PC and totally forgot about that haha, tho i do sometimes play on console with friends so it‚Äôs an issue for me and my mates on PS4
---
I'm down to do it at any time today
---
Lol - idk what a ‚Äúground baby‚Äù is but it doesn‚Äôt sound good.
---
Valid point. They did remove a lot of them, but they couldn't have removed them all.
---
Honestly, I've found.... 4 or 5 myself. I get explosive, anti armor, and bloodied drops like crazy.
---
... Are you trolling or not even reading what I'm writing?
---
I'm on PS4 and he also terrorizes people there! He has an account on all platforms, he told me I couldn't hide from him even if I started playing PC, and then he called me a little girl.
---
i know it gets repetitive real fast when we have whole and can only really use a small bit of it
---
Ya and the marine one too
---
I have just been using the camera to find it, only way I can
---
That is why i added the player marker, just need to adjust the server side query to get it working.
---
I see what you mean with the list, basically just a toggle for common items.
---
As for interior cells, I can definitely look into it, will have to take a look at tying the cell to the door that leads to it. Though i think most if not all interior cells are tied to an actual map marker, so that shouldnt be too hard.
---
My experience with the game has been awesome. I‚Äôve met several communities and a lot of friends along the way, I do have to say the game doesn‚Äôt come without issues which my biggest would be the lack of endgame content. I do not see as many bugs as people say there are and I don‚Äôt think the lack of NPCs has been devastating to the game. I love the features such as workshops and camp building because it gives me a way to show off creations I made but instead of having to have someone install my save or something of the sort like in 4 they can just stumble upon it while adventuring. Currently I‚Äôm about level 150 and I have nearly perfected my build, armor and weapons. I personally love the game and I hope it stays up for years to come.
---
I play PC, most pc players have 100+ chars. I was going to actually say 200+ in my post originally, but I lowered it because I didn't know how it was on xbox or ps4.
---
You're not wrong, having a kind of server where everything everywhere is potentially challenging really seems like a natural choice.. and I don't think it needs overthinking like the person I replied to suggested.
---
I really feel like anything like this would be a good change. I would love every encounter being a challenge again.
---
I was disappointed to have to say goodbye to all that sweet and easy loot, but I fully understand their rationale. Though, it is a little annoying, since I never really would have bothered to kill all those goddamn bots if Bethesda hadn‚Äôt set all those challenges which require you to destroy a bazillion of them.
---
xbox most recent was never broken...
---
You‚Äôve responded repeatedly attempting to justify your comments.
---
I‚Äôm not trolling, I do think you‚Äôre incapable of admitting you‚Äôre wrong.
---
Blocked..
---
Agreed.
---
Once we discovered we could install our vendor market between the columns at the bus stop, we knew we had to do it - turns out it works perfectly (and IMHO looks cool to reuse an in-world structure!).
---
9 out of 10 , good job really nice.
---
This kind of issue is almost always due to RAM and pageswap issues. I would def upgrade to 16 GB of RAM. Multiple sources confirm you need 16GB for a modern gaming PC. No big benefit to having more than 16 (yet).
---
I don't know that 4GB on the card is insufficient though. I think that should be ok.
---
I feel the same was "Nuking Whitesprings in 10 minutes, PM to join" posts when there's three different platforms, and only a handful of users could join the event anyway due to server populations.
---
Azure DevOps is another nice place as you can track work in cards like JIRA and link it to your code repo all in one place.  
---
If you need any help getting a repo setup I'll be glad to help!
---
Don‚Äôt report people for Griefing, it‚Äôs a part of the game whether you like it or not. Not everyone is sunshine and rainbows as you might have been led to believe.
---
You aren't understanding them. If you look at my original comments in this thread, I said they THOUGHT he was a turret tower, not that he was and that idiots attack any camps that are near whitespring because they are dumb and think they are turret towers even if they aren't.
---
That is what THOUGHT means, they thought something about his base without knowing it for a fact.
---
I feel I could make a dent on a lvl 50 at least, I'm not saying it would be an equal fight nor I think it would be but at least I would expect to take 1/4 of his HP with a missile before he kills me, it would still be fun, I wouldn't complain.
---
The same lvl 50 could get owned by a lvl 70 but maybe give some fight. But a lvl 200 coming at a lvl 30 he was just farming me lol. Next time I might as well just run and if I'm in my camp bye bye camp again, it's a given I'm gonna lose it
---
the loot system needs to be looked at, it would be fun to meet a high level 3 star enemy somewhere quiet like in the forest, maybe something like a mothman
---
Does your friend know how to read? Legit question.
---
 That sounds like a lot of work for 500 caps.
---
4 random sheep found me. Sliced  it nicely. They are fairly easy, took hardly any damage. Kinda suprising.  I enjoy the sheep event. Kept soloing it
---
Thank you! It was a real team effort - and we have a lot of fun running these markets.
---
How often you planning on doing This? I'm sitting on 12 keycard. Was gonna start dropping once I rebuild my ammo
---
yeah fewer fast travel points would make for more chances to have random encounters in the world with some high level enemies away from the normal spots like whitesprings
---
You can still do that in adventure mode, personally I roleplay a responder and I try to craft aid and give it away, I was just thinking this for the survival mode only.
---
&gt;So now I have 5 levels tied up into 1 perk card.
---
It sucks at first, but by the time you hit level 150 or so you'll have so many duplicates and spare points to play with it stops mattering.
---
I'm sure I wouldn't have made a dent even if he was naked lol
---
For some reason, it always disappears for me and one other guy on our team no matter who initiates it.  We can never see it.  He can and says it is right here, I'm standing right on it.  He will even shoot his weapon at it.  We can't see it or access it.  We can usually find it when it meatpiles, but it is always somewhere else and we usually can't tell if it is actually the imposter or just a legendary gutsy.  Usually the imposter will have more junk than a gutsy, but you can't always tell.  It needs a marker of sorts.  Even "Assaultron" would be fine.
---
Does he own a workshop? Owning a workshop disables Pacifist mode and opens you up to pvp attacks.
---
I think the OP means within walking distance of Big Al's, no fast travel. I think I found brain fungus and glowing fungus in the Morgantown High School.
---
I agree that you can get most of them by drinking found booze, but stuff like cranberries, you're going to have to fast travel.
---
this would be a easier change that what they did with survival mode because all they need to change is the spawn level
---
Want fuel?  Make flamers. You get a full tank (100) when you make one. It's less resource intensive and you can scrap to learn mods.
---
Yeah, this almost seems like a good way to grief new players. Give them the excavator PA and don't tell them. Or even worse, offer to help them register it so they can use the targeting hud or some other lie.
---
Thank you very much
---
Yeah I went up like 8 levels in 24 hours, all without even really actively trying to level . it was awesome!
---
Probs 3-4 times, ince my friend gets on
---
If anyone wanna nuke add me psn: chlebostrom
---
Most of the times I activate the Lure, and then when the SB is flying at me, it aggroes on some other mob and then I fail.
---
IDK how to get it to work.
---
That‚Äôs where I had my camp but constantly get getting destroyed. I‚Äôve moved mine down near the lack now as it‚Äôs a good spot.
---
If you have it on PC, then most definitely!
---
I both got an alert my CAMP is being destroyed, and travelled to said CAMP watching  to society rejects blast my camp away with their explosive shottys.
---
They had a third guy not on their team take off their bounties when they got too high
---
May i introduce you to 490 minimum damage per second? Its called "Melee". Get a bloodied something and perks for it, radicool, full unyielding set, and you wilk be good to go as starter! For extra flavor, use adrenal reaction mutation, nerd rage and eat only glowing steaks!
---
I‚Äôve seen a level 64 take out a 170 it‚Äôs really just about the right gear and he won‚Äôt get more then 7~8 caps off of you since you are only level 30.
---
i was looking a that and wondering if might be something like this, some of the old loading screens during the beta referenced a deathmatch mode and nuclear winter could be it
---
There are going to be major content drops quarterly and I between will be micro patches related to said drops. Hence what we've seen with Wild Appalachia.
---
Sadly i was away for a majority of it but luckily got  to lvl 150 from 146 so cant be too sad. I hope they do this time to time, hell maybe a double loot drop of some sort ot increase spawn of 3 star legendarys
---
Thank you for the tip! It's currently stashed away at the moment. I realised after that the person also gave me plans for the Power Armour Station
---
yeah i don't think most fallout fans came here for the PvP side of the game, we really want more stories and quests
---
Brain fungus for one
---
now that would be extreme
---
Sad it has come to this but, if you want to use the flamer and need fuel, get the perk card that lets you disarm traps. Remember the old bug that people used to gain stupid amounts of levels? That still works only for just a few minutes. You can spam disarm on the flame traps and get tons of flamer fuel still, just like back in the beta. Only it doesn't last indefinitely only until the trap is finished firing.
---
Would be even better if they didn't choose a weekend I was away for lol
---
He‚Äôs not losing caps just by being attacked he only loses them when he dies
---
Fair enough. But sad indeed about the reduction.
---
I feel like I could repair any camp I ever had for far less than 100 caps in resources.
---
I can't say with certainty that mines is degrading faster, but I *think* it may be. 
---
I do know that a piece of legendary combat marine armor is apparently made out of tissue paper.
---
I feel he wasn't after the caps just the kill count and maybe the little aid I had on me. Hope he liked that Razorgrain Soup :p
---
As an aside, had anyone else noticed that the assaultrons in Watoga will run away and wake up every robot in the city if they start losing? I think it was just the legendary ones, but still. It was hilarious.
---
That‚Äôs where I saw 80+ legendary too. Took ages to kill but did get 2 legendary and a awesome handmade.
---
Great work! Now go outside!  *continues server hoping the same location for specific items for the 50th time today)
---
Can you always repeat the quest?
---
There's a bit going on there 
---
1: Power armor doesn't provide carry weight by itself. Power armor has a basic strength score of 10 (11?). If you have more strength you get that, if not, you use the power armor frames strength. This can improve carry weight, but isn't a direct carry weight bonus. Excavator is 100 carry weight for the whole set, but it doesn't have any of the military mods (stealth boy, jetpack, recon sensors), and has low defenses. You have yo use the complete set though. Lots of people use it all the time.
---
2: all jetpacks chug fusion cores. AP drain is tied directly to fusion core consumption. It's not an X01 problem, it's a power armor problem. The only non-ap drain that I know of is the stealth boy, but I haven't used mine in a long time, so maybe that drains AP as well.
---
3: yes I can calibrate your shocks on excavator tonight if you're available. You'll need 10 violet flux (5 each) and assorted screws springs aluminum etc.
---
I am having am awesome time playing fallout 76. I have had very few issues with griefers and have met many lovely, helpful people! I think of it as more of a post-apocalyptic sim than a game; I'm living as best I can in the world after the war. I tend to play alone most of the time as I have an odd work schedule but am happy to team up occasionally. I also do a lot of crafting, and loved building my C.A.M.P. Most of the people insisting I can't possibly be enjoying it because it's so terrible haven't even played it! Sure it's got issues but it's one of my favorite games I've ever played.
---
I remember seeing a post someone had 25 tse handmades on their account and had 8 left after they removed them all lmao
---
Probably I go in with minimal food and chems otherwise I‚Äôll be overweight
---
Welcome to online gaming in general. ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
Thank you! I am trying to stay away from using Power Armour at the moment until I can collect enough Fusion Cores to make it worth it.
---
yeah there is and in oreder to unlock season 2 content with all the npcs back you first need to complete season 1this would give both new and existing players something interesting, the scorhbeasts can't be the main enemy forever the game needs to move on or the players will leave
---
Then you can report the mod and the player using it since you think it gives them an unfair advantage. Because your issue here is the instant switch which isn't even part of the game. But I'm done. You are just pushing a bullshit narrative. Respecing was already added once and Bethesda thought it was fine so plain and simple you're just wrong. Have fun living in denial.
---
Since when does she not scale off the number of players?! I never saw this announced.
---
Reverend Delbert Winter's trailer in Flatwoods, or in the church in Helvetia. Those are the closest locations I'm aware of.
---
Use this. I didn't make it, but the guy who did is amazing. Absolute game changer.
---
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1m4sA-lJt2lV5r4NjkGNgyVUGNwjRMLN-ishup58v_Qs/edit?usp=drivesdk
---
Yes indeed
---
Yas, like portal 2 coop emotes would be neat
---
Bethesda has no problem with the mod, hell they have shared screenshots of people using it on their twitter.
---
I looked for a trading subreddit on the right side menu and found none, you might want to fix that before enforcing the ban =)
---
i'm still at 6 after killing everything i can find, i think the mr handy sent us on a wild goose chase
---
Nah if they were naked you would, lol
---
I guess I‚Äôm the unlucky one and get the dups of bad cards I will never use.
---
I am just addicted to that Junk Extractor... I don't think I be able to not build on one ever again...
---
that would be cool
---
I've only really come across one asshole in this game who only liked to pick on low levels like myself. Every single person though has been helpful in some way. I do the same, I get a lot of purified water and I end up having like 50 in my inventory, I just drop them next to low level players.
---
let hope so and that it's not more PvP content
---
Yeah I have everything on stash now. But it makes it more exciting. For the first time while I was running around to get wood for the repairs I was thirsty and because I had no water source near me I had to resort to drink beer laying around. Now that's true survival haha
---
I did 2 levels. I dont know what to do in game after l50 üòû
---
Still not found camera, etcüòû
---
That's a lot of cores!
---
Very true hopefully one day
---
fucking hell you again lmao.
---
I took six photos in various locations before noticing the challenge was the Municipal building. I was convinced it was the Civic building. Even went inside to take a photo from the top stands when I couldn't get it working on the roof. Silly me!
---
I did manage the real photo on the first try, though. I took the photo about four metres in front of the elevator, didn't  require anything fancy, I thought.
---
Left it in my stash for now. Not going near it until the quest tells me I need to
---
They need to get on this, I hate having to close and restart the game application to play again.
---
I‚Äôm lucky if I‚Äôm not ‚Äúsigned out‚Äù by Bethesda, only to have close the game again and check my internet to default the game into letting me play... I‚Äôm running at an average 38-52MB/s which is quite good for where I‚Äôm located and considering I can play Destiny/Warframe/ESO for extended periods without disconnecting, BGS has some competing to do
---
I didn‚Äôt do the quest I just cleared it out. There‚Äôs probably like 20-30 enemies each clearing. I‚Äôd just hop servers and keep doing it. It‚Äôs also good for getting legendaries
---
Thats my thought too.   
---
The PVP games that I‚Äôve enjoyed in the past always had a relatively level playing field for defense and health while having different weapons. 
---
Only the sniper rifle could take you out in two shots and they were always vulnerable once you found their location.  The rest required real in-game skill and one-on-one fights lasted long enough to enjoy it.   Of course these games also never had VATS. 
---
The only way to fix this in Fallout would be to automatically do forced leveling for weapons, armour, health, and perks when PvP is initiated.  I don‚Äôt see this happening so it will always, in my opinion, be broken.
---
As someone that played exclusively with friends, it was less than 5-10% of the time the server going down, almost every single time it was individual disconnects. Once every few days to a week or would kick us all.. so that's just a bad assumption to make.
---
Lol! Playing on PS4 Pro and it runs smoothly. Watch a lot of YouTubers playing on PC and the stuttering looks really bad.
---
Can't wait!
---
I can only think of one interior location that's not tied to a map marker and that's Evan's room at Mt Blair. I can only think of about 3 dozen interior cells total as most of the locations are actually part of the world. Three power plants, Nuka Cola plant, Whitespring, 2 high schools, West Tek, a few in Watoga, VTU, Tattoo Parlor, Morgantown Airport, Penitentiary, Vault Tec Agricultural Research, Charleston Capital, AVR Medical Center, Hornwright HQ, Garrahan, Big Bend Tunnel, Riverside Manor, Fort Defiance, a handful of mines and caves, Glassed Cavern, RobCo Research, burrows, Valley Galleria, the bunkers in the mire, Dyer Chem Sewer, Missile Silos. Probably others I can't think of. Maybe prioritize by the ones that have good items. Like ones that have power armor should be a given. Maybe ones that have static plans or recipes. Then do locations that have rare junk static spawns.
---
that is a good idea that way nobody can skip ahead and the world wouldn't feel so unchanging
---
Are you PC? Ive been hoarding .308 in the hopes of one day gettings a decent 3star lego
---
Unfortunately I have come across one asshole player who liked to pick on low levels only. Quickly dropped from the server when a level 300 came across though.
---
Quick tip on reaching best vendor values: 11 Charisma with lvl 3 Hard Bargain. 2 Unyielding armor pieces will do, assuming you have 5 points in Charisma. If not, many types of beer  give +1 Charisma which can be increased to +3 with Party Boy/Girl.
---
Good job.
---
It actually is based on tower location. The best one I've seen is the one south of the monorail elevator, SW of lucky hole mine. Usually gives max level weapons and whatnot. It's a great way to farm mods.
---
Hopefully they kept it and is using it!
---
That was the reason I built there and anyone who comes in my new camp tells me about that spot. I‚Äôm a hoarder and collect everything I come across so have way too much junk. But I still can‚Äôt help clearing out every useless item I find.
---
 more legendaries are a must
---
Plans are randomized drops, so there's no way to get a specific plan immediately. I've found that the best way to farm plans is to capture workshops and defend them. More times than not you get a new plan.
---
Just buy them from Free States vendor. They're not too expensive if you have Better Prices and some Grape Mentats.
---
I've lost count as well and have only found it once, so I have shocks on my right leg, and not the left.
---
Too many people are buying them up to sell on the market.
---
Great response... Adding nothing to the conversation, good job.
---
Even the random Legendary enemies in the Emergency Services building &amp; Civic center no longer spawn, Watoga is now a ghost town, only good for gathering Dog Food and some Nuka Cola.
---
I have about 3 cards and down to join you my friend.
---
Psn is ItsKingSaber.
---
No, that happens sometimes in new zones, where it takes a while for the new thing to appear. Since it was in a nuke zone it could have just been lagged out.
---
Oh damn. I wonder what level I could have reached. Level 20 and was doing the Quest Into The Fire where I had to do the final exam. For some reason the Scorched in there were level 48+ yet nobody was around me.   
---
I always thought they scaled it depending on your level.
---
Correct. Sneak to eliminate vatsibility. 
---
I believe that not being able to apply mods has been patched. If you build another torso for the stealth boy mod you can switch them in and out like a piece of armour in your pip boy.  Heavy, though.  Yes to marsupial.  
---
Can‚Äôt confirm but I‚Äôd rather have some stagger than no stagger. 
---
Not sure about the viability of those to be used as primary weapons in pvp because I don‚Äôt have much experience with them. Cryo gun seems like more of a support weapon to be used on a team and the spin up time of the Gatling laser might become a liability.  Anti armour is said to not work for energy damage at this time. That‚Äôs why I suggested the anti armour lmg.  No spin up time and high ballistic dps.  You can still use your current weapons for pve and you can always test with your friends to see what‚Äôs effective.
---
Congrats!
---
3 cards?
---
Why not get a mic? The game is much more fun when you have friends you can actually talk to.. you would also be able to make new friends.
---
Hell, I'm using earbuds that cost like 5 bucks from Walmart. It's not difficult.
---
I definitely will. I need to start using my mic more in game and actually thank people instead of just using the emoji things
---
He was probably an alt if he knew to kite the mob to another player and knew to ask for PA.
---
They already have a lot of work to fix that pile of trash they call survival mode.
---
i haven't been back since it was first launchedand i lost almost all my caps in about 10 mins
---
.4%
---
Perception 13 5.2% bonus to VATs
---
Perception 14 5.6% bonus
---
Perception 15 6.0% bonus, etc
---
It is definitely more noticeable when you are using head shots in VATs, you can see. Find a gun with 33% VATS bonus, target head with and without said gun. Scopes also affect VATs hit % as well. Bigger is better.
---
Probably had the most fun I've ever had in the game this weekend because I stumbled across the irradiated landscaper meta. Some poor sod vendored an Instigating/+40% power attack/-40% damage while power attacking Mr. Handy Buzz Blade so I over repaired it and took it for a spin with my unyielding armor set.
---
With two ranks of Sneak, Escape Artist, and the high agility from the unyielding gear I can sneak up to most enemies in broad daylight without them seeing me. My opening salvo with a sneak attack is over 1000 damage and then it's 140 multiple times per second if the enemy somehow manages to survive. And this isn't even my final form because I still have to pick up Radicool.
---
Also, shout out to Captainoob. He did a video on a similar weapon and I found this one at the vendor the day after I watched it. Probably wouldn't have given it a second thought without that video.
---
If you check the market 76 subreddit you might find some. But they're gonna be costly. Best bet is to just keep hopping. It took me hundreds of hops. Like, real world weeks. And that was just one shock, lol.
---
After giving up on my level 100 trophy that never registered on my level 155 character, I started a new character a couple of months ago just to finally get the trophy. To say getting to level 100 on a second character was a struggle  would be putting it mildly. I was at 94.5 after months of slogging through, but with this Double XP weekend I finally got the ambition to get it done and after a 6 hour romp between the burrows, WhiteSprings, and a Queen SB kill I got my trophy! Thank You Bethesda! PS Do that shit again soon.
---
Nothing in or around morgantown though?
---
3 nuclear key cards.
---
This was included in an update before, completing the BoS questline grants you a set of Ultracite Power Armor.
---
Doesn't make a difference to me, he also didn't seem to know anything he was doing.
---
No, it's not possible. He has to be engaged in PvP and die to lose caps to another player.
---
BTW, there's no PvE server. You open yourself to PvP in Adventure mode the moment you take a workshop or shoot a player with pacifist mode turned off.
---
PS4
---
I also want to know where trading subs are. Are there good subs for partying up as well?
---
it's you and me and anyone else he puts on the ground ground ground .
---
I hear this was removed.
---
Any foolie that claimed to have the actual plan for sale was fronting. I tried.
---
Yep I know. Right after TS and E nerf, I got my first explosive shotgun off Harpers Vendor. 
---
I paid about 200c so the player leaving it there got about 50c. I used it a lot for the next 3 months or so, until I finally got a severe improvement, I E combat shotgun, and sold off the previous for about 6k. Of course it's not about caps or profit, long run nothing like that really matters, it's about utility and convinience. I'm never been able to find an explosive shotgun to loot. Other explosive guns at decent amounts, even got a level 40 ultracite laser gun just a day before it was taken off the loot table, hell it even has super mutant killer as first effect, really handy as super mutants have low energy resistances.
---
Lately I've picked up stuff like 3 star max level melee. Like bloodied, SS +end pole hook. Sure it's "only" pole hook, but those are pretty handy effects it has, and the damage is decent. The vendor charged 69 caps for it so whoever sold it got like 20? I mean I can imagine the players selling them to vendors know someone might find them and buy them if they found some use for them. Vendors retain their inventory longer than stuff dropped onto grouns and probably longer than any containers.
---
It's kinda shame you can't sell plans to vendors. Because if you could, I could imagine vendors having all sorts of nice plans you don't have yet, simply because someone sold them there.
---
I really hope and expect this trading to become much easier and convinient once player vending drops.
---
It depends on which tower you use. The level of the area the tower is in determines the loot. The ones in savage divide get better the further south you go. I like to use the ones in the mid level areas for unlocking handmade and lever gun mods. Saves me a ton of screws.
---
Honestly, I like killing bots at the whitespring. I like getting the free fusion cores off the sentry bots, and really the only bots they have there that are at all "dangerous" are a few assaultrons, they don't have any lvl50 gutsies.
---
Rolling dice would be a good one. When you use the emote itll roll two dice and give u a number. Can turn that into a casino game lol
---
Take them to a relay tower, repair the terminal, and insert the holotape. Same way you would insert the video game holotapes. Then a message will pop up asking if you want to request the drop.
---
This should've been a no-brainer from the beginning.
---
Look through the white springs furniture merchant, or defend workshops. Be aware that workshops put you into pvp mode and you will likely be tracked to your CAMP and it could be destroyed.
---
Ahh gotcha. He didn‚Äôt actually put me on the ground but he clearly wanted me to fight him and to just generally piss on everyone who happened to come by.
---
Im down,  PM if you want.
---
Yeah i was thinking maybe have the location marked, and then on hover it would show up with a list of rare/high value/items of interest items in that location.
---
Past that if you search for an item that is within  the cell it would mark the cell and then on hover display 'X number of Y in this cell' like you said.
---
Definitely need to start creating unique markers for each of the item types though.
---
Haha never even thought about that that actually would be a lot of fun
---
I use a Cryolator pretty extensively. The durability went up significantly with the energy weapons buffs, so it doesn't break as fast as it used to. 
---
Also, though most people know it for its freezing ability, the crystallizing barrel has some very interesting interactions. Most flying enemies like Stingwings, Bloodbugs, and Bloatflys seem to take *way* more damage than normal enemies from it. Other enemies like Mirelurk Queens, Yao Guai, Deathclaws, and Ghouls also get shredded in seconds. Other enemies like Super Mutants seem to take extremely little damage from it. These days I use it as a specialty weapon for certain mobs (listed above) because it absolutely rips them to shreds.
---
Jesus, leather is great haha
---
Wow great shot
---
Great weekend; next give a free trial out of the game to everyone for a week with another double xp weekend following it and you have yourselves a WIN
---
I assume you mean Wastelad, but yes, it's basically a simple top down turn-based RPG along the lines of OG Final Fantasy or Dragon Warrior. You start the game by choosing 2 other party members for the 4 or 5 available options, and then wander the wastes killing mutant centipedes and ghouls and whatnot. 
---
It also saves your game so you don't lose progress between sessions.
---
Not heard anything, but very much like the idea. I have been wanting to make a basement/bunker but the foundations has been a pain
---
Wait you lose caps when you die?
---
Sending request. Eskimointexas.
---
I think we're almost ready, can you come online?
---
Fucking broken auto mod
---
It's not it's from the developer room that people cheated into some time ago
---
It was awesome - went from low 30s to 48. Hoping for more weekends like this.
---
i have tried using a mic before but all everyone on area chat would be able hear is 2 small kids and one very loud dog
---
Not yet.  Next patch I believe
---
last time I got that spawn, 3 yao guais had killed a group of mega sloths
---
Yupp. Hopping online rn
---
That's pretty Raider-y. I'd just block them and leave the server.
---
You the one person in the world that google searching doesn't work? Found some instantly while searching.
---
What is the pavilion? Is that the little dome shaped structure with the columns in the garden between the back entrance of the main building and the golf club?
---
I‚Äôm not familiar with where a deathclaw spawns.  I already have the camera on my main but my alt needs one.
---
Not that I know of. I checked the wiki too, didn't see anything closer.
---
Then you must have been just a little girl, you evolve to a ground baby if he kills you, if he just harasses you you're a little girl.  I'd just get on the ground and do what he asks if I were you.
---
yeah the servers feel more unstable now than they did 2 months ago, it does need fixing
---
Rad arches can be a pain to fix until you like doing Nuke zones, but other wise yeah.
---
All legendary mobs can do that, I've had legendary scorched do that at the church in Harpers Ferry. Was ridiculous, I swear it was playing hide and seek with me.
---
Thanks for answering, the reason I ask is I'm looking at automating and populating maps directly from the game data for reliability and 100% coverage. I thought if it had already been done there wasn't much point
---
I don't see it as griefing at all. If I'm marked as PvP, I expect to be attacked. If I keep running back to the guy that's killing me, that's my fault for being dumb.   
---
Now, if this guy was just hiding out near a workshop and killing everyone that claimed it just for the sake of killing people, then possibly that might be greifing. Or maybe he's RP'ing that it was his daddy's shop before the war and he's defending it. Who knows.
---
Nah. 5 characters.  25k each. More than enough.
---
Also internal walls!!
---
Why not allow us to combine the pools of the 5 characters at least
---
So you've played it? So you own the game? Maybe try it out for yourself?
---
yeah but they can get away with it because they say it's a beta which is funny because the entire game still feels like it's in beta
---
Right? I just wonder how *anyone* has a whole set without exploits
---
Not a bad idea.
---
Oh. Had no idea. Might use some then.
---
Yeah, I have a Quad Cryolator too and used to rely on it and recommended it to others as well, but the risk of this led me to not use it anymore.
---
Granted, I could just let the SBQ kill me.  That's an option too.
---
A increase in drops or legendary would be cool. Personally I really loved the double xp weekend because I've had the game since December but I rarely get time to play and I was able to get from level 22 to about level 31 just playing casually. I could see how it's meh for high level players, but for new people and super casual players like myself it was a godsend haha
---
Thanks my dude
---
I've had friends with a lot of background noise, it was never a big deal.. everyone has a real life, so it never hurts to try to be understanding of that.
---
it seemed to be messed up for me on ps4 at least but i don't know about anyone else these bugs are pretty hit and miss
---
No it's not, because the game doesn't fully use those numbers and those alone.
---
Certain armor pieces can exceed excavator in radiation resistances, but because armor pieces don't have the magic radiation immunity PAs have, you can't use normal armor inside nuke zone unless you are getting high level rad sponge, preferrebly off from several team mates.
---
That would be super fun. Double exp is nice, but higher chance of legendaries and rare gear would be even better.
---
And mark it to all on the map
---
Worked last time I made one.  Perhaps it'll change when the fix the crafting of fuel.
---
yeah like it did when we first started thats what we need more challenge
---
That's a really fantastic idea. Thanks!!
---
Takes all of 5 seconds on google to find Fallout 76 markets on reddit.
---
Yeah, I like both those ideas. The ability to know at a glace if a place is worth farming for an item is great so a summary list is smart.
---
For me, the biggest head scratchers I have right now are 'where's the nearest X workbench' and 'where's the closest place I can find this ingredient for a recipe'. I hate it when I'm out and about and have a bag full of fresh meat and can't find a stove to save my life. Or a broken weapon.
---
I don't think there needs to be an increase but being able to pool caps together would be great.
---
In pvp
---
I made a post about this right after survival mode was launched and I was shot down, even by the passive players lol. I'm glad the winds are changing though.
---
I've never found more than 4 at West Tek, and 7 at harpers, but WS will sometimes spit out legendary items from more than 50% of the Ghouls (More often when Nuked), with Ghouls constantly re-spawning, I have looted more than 50 on several occasions, and these sessions are usually followed closely by the " Server going Offline for Maintenance" warning.
---
Any time I get the warning that the server is going down for maintenance I go straight to WS and Farm Ghouls until DC'd.
---
I killed one but killed the SBQ twice and killed around a total of 20 Scorchbeasts in general. A friend of mine needed to get to the rank of General in the Enclave.
---
I very much appreciate your post here. You‚Äôve passed on some information I haven‚Äôt considered. I‚Äôm going to keep trying for a little while. Thank you kindly.
---
So what is the solution if I find this again? Wait? re fast travel to a nearby zone? Something else?
---
I would like the option of "wallpaper" to texture the walls differently. Plain colors or actual wallpaper patterns would be great.
---
I think it's next update.
---
Yeah, if there's a solution at all I think that's a moderate one for sure
---
Damn. Thank you
---
What is the solution to this? Wait in the zone, travel away and come back, or something else?
---
Crystal is readily obtainable from Lucky Hole Mine.  With Excavator armor, you can get at least 40 Crystal per run.  The Cryo Cells weigh a fair bit anyway, so you don't want to have an excess if you can help it.  As far as screen real estate, I play in third-person mode, but I can imagine how large the weapon probably is in first-person.
---
beta for the beta... And they're wondering why f76 doesn't give enough money
---
I too got tired of not finding it.  Paid about 1700 caps for the Handmade plans at one of the vendors in WhiteSprings on PS4.  That‚Äôs with the Better Prices perk and Grape Mentats.  
---
I finally found some of the T-60 and T-51b plans by going the Mire Treasure maps.   I‚Äôm still missing most of the plans, though.   
---
And, yes, farming for power armor is easy, it‚Äôs just that I would like to round out what I can build should a piece disappear into the ether or I accidentally scrap something.  It saves running around just to fine one piece.   Plus, I could then build for lower level players if I‚Äôm feeling generous.
---
In the mix of all this I actually saw a flat woods monster üò©üò©üò©üò© it was AWESOME
---
Sounds like you're just a jerk. 
---
My legit reply.
---
I got my toilet plan from defending the Gorge Junkyard.
---
Get a PS4
---
Just tried to do it...  bugs out when trying to reboot the system
---
Gratz btw they should have given you 420 more atoms because your char looks like he smoked a joint while doing it 8)
---
Yup. I normally go WS, then hit the Dump just north, you know you have a good server when most or all of the Super Mutants at the dump are legendary, I have had 4-5 spawn there all legendary and one 3 stars. That dump is generally the litmus test for me. After that, I will go to all the places, The steak house, West tek, etc. Generally, just wandering will produce random spawns of all types of legendary.
---
The quest, I know, that‚Äôs how I got my first Ultracite PA.

I don‚Äôt know if this was intended in the dev‚Äôs original vision, but STASH capacity limitations have lead to some odd examples of generosity. In that they are not so much encouraging players to work together, as they are doing a great job encouraging diverse builds with widely disparate material requirements. 
---
With some builds certain scrapped junk materials are effectively worthless. You can‚Äôt use it. You can‚Äôt sell it. And, there‚Äôs no point hoarding it with inventory space restrictions.
---
But for other builds, they may be absolutely desperate for this material. Resulting in a situation that they‚Äôre super excited to receive your trash.
---
Was it not dated for the 9th May?
---
Wrong, played at a friends house. It‚Äôs people like you that made the population flee from this game just as much as the shaky launch did. 
---
Believe it or not there was a lot more pretentious pricks like you in the beginning. At least everyone else had an answer that I could appreciate but this is just dumb.
---
I think not enough time had passed for people to realize how broken the workshop PVP stuff is.
---
I can at 3 and after 9, when you doing it
---
Jeez....that woulda been a scrap to see.  I bet the Yao Guais made short work of them.
---
Good Doggy and Cola Nut, my most often used perks.
---
Lol
---
Thank you! Your advice really is getting my gears turning on how to better design my living space. It‚Äôs a really nice place! I hope you have continue building cool places in the future!
---
it would only need to be the 2 modes, 1 for those that are learning the game and then 1 for those that want more of a challenge, most people would quickly end up on the more challenging servers with most players now even hitting level 50 before switching over
---
I just go back to my CAMP and leap off a cliff.  That seems to fix it.
---
In the past, I used to have a blue halo effect when affected.  That remained even after death and restoring normal speed (which is why it very much seemed like a bug), but I didn't see that last time.
---
You could use both Intelligence Bobble head (+2) and Brain Fungus Soup (+2) to push to 50. Xcell has been known to stack with other chems, so that might push you to 52.
---
That was my response. He swears that's not what was happening. 
---
The context was PvP following a queen event. 
---
I can't say with certainty, but don't think he had taken any workshops beforehand.
---
Sounds like maybe someone with bloody mess got it and caused weird effects?
---
Did the cap loss changes only apply to survival mode?  As in you only lose 25 percent?  God that's incredibly stupid if so.  Assholes you use PVP to farm caps are almost certain to limit their griefing to adventure if that is the case.
---
Doing it now, pst
---
Yeah. I get that. Just distinguishing between the normal server and the PvP.
---
Lol rip intelligence üòÇ
---
yeah well if they asked the players we could tell them
---
It doesn't make me sick, but it looks like shit.
---
Yea lol it‚Äôs awful
---
Yup. They can't handle survival mode so they come prey on people in adventure. There's other tactics too, like a level 300 getting a bounty of 5 caps so that if they do lose PvP they only lose 5 instead of 300. The bounty should be added to the PvP loss, not replace it.
---
I've also been damaged by another player while in passive in adventure mode. I think it had something to do with my electrically charged going off; they had a super fast swing speed and were able to hit me several times as the animation was playing for the EC mutation, and I actually took full damage. Fortunately it didn't count as being "in combat" so my healing factor healed me pretty quick, but still. PvP in adventure mode is just so much more broken now that they are trying to make it more casual. They just need to separate it entirely. Kill players in survival, play with players in adventure.
---
I used to horded too, but I've been stashing legendaries for the vendor so my junk weight is limited. I just keep what I need to repair my armor/weapons and sell the rest.
---
K. I'm on your server gathering supplies. I'll wait for your lead.
---
i will have a look for my old mic and give it a go
---
My Lv.30 Rifle alt started out by gained 6 levels from a single Scorched Earth event and continued to level quickly to 54. Then I ended up finding [this](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/330511405264535552/572472638086316055/unknown.png) 3\* Gauss from an impostor sheep to end the event on that I been messing around with.
---
I ran into Sheepy twice while I was looking for a Megasloth in Cranberry Bog. He's pretty tanky but has bad perception so I can keep sneak attacking him. :\] ([pic1](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/330511405264535552/572470044894953482/unknown.png), [pic2](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/330511405264535552/572473794837610527/unknown.png))
---
I wonder if his skulls will be used to make the new fist weapon. His parts don't scrap with scrap all.
---
Id Have agreed with your Turret tower though, if there was a single point on my CAMP capable of being even remotely thought of as a turret tower.
---
The issue is, i went through and intentionally built as innocent looking as i could for intentional reasona, the most "aggressive" looking building i have is the all steel wall shed i keep my fusion generator in. 
---
These guys had no concern about turret towers, it wasnt quick destruction, they knew my CAMP was in a harmless location, they knew it was undefended, they saw everywhere they looked there were locations for other players to utilize and help themselves so as to avoid going through loading screens in Whitesprings proper.
---
They made the councious decision that, "Hey, fuck that guy, lets blow his shit up and bounce around like our asses are on fire".
---
And the very fact that shortly aftet i arrived to see the destruction they decided to run up, not only swing at me but "Tbag Circle" my feet, tells me these idiots were greifers. Not a case of mistaken CAMP-denity
---
I‚Äôve had at least five hard crashes since I started playing in March. Imo, it‚Äôs just part of the experience for Bethesda games. It‚Äôs worth it to work around it.
---
He might‚Äôve accidentally shot someone or got shot by someone else but there is no way he lost caps if he didn‚Äôt die
---
I remember someone said that Bethesda is gona fix the  cost for flamer amo and cryo amo
---
Didn‚Äôt kill the sampsquamch but got some good pics of it busting my ass
---
Yeahh. He's level 130-ish. 
---
Pretty sure he knows how it all works.
---
this or something very similar
---
asking players... haha! better add repair kits to the shop
---
I have to admit I've used the exploit of having a team member contest a workshop while I was stalking the owner on the other side of the map.
---
Leave some fertilizer on their bed. It's the universal symbol for "Cool house, bro".
---
Probably, yeah.
---
Measuring setbacks like that may keep you from this plan. I wanted it, bad, for what reason I don't remember now. Anyhow, sayin, it might be worth the headache if you are hungry like me.
---
Bro same!
---
That's what I told him. He swears that something is glitched and he was losing caps with each attach.
---
This should have released instead of survival mode.
---
Excellent point. Bloodied looks safe for now üòÄ
---
You might want to make a choice between shotguns and rifles. A good compromise is to (for example) keep your shotguns cards maxed and only put 1 point into each of the three commando cards.  Or do the opposite.
---
Hard bargain should only be used when trading with robot vendors. Suppressor and tenderizer are perks that you might want to consider using instead when in combat.
---
&gt; the scorhbeasts can't be the main enemy forever the game needs to move on or the players will 
---
Hmmm use mods that make the condition bar bigger
---
I play on PS4 and average two per session.
---
I remember when the game went live, I was around level 20 when the beta ended.. I couldn't find anything to reduce my rads, and I was thinking about it like other survival games.. needless to say, shortly after that the difficulty pretty much disappeared.
---
Now I keep my rads at about 90% and never struggle with anything, it's my build.. and it's pretty bulletproof. If I'm ever going to come back to this game, they've gotta find a way to challenge players. By build should in itself be a challenge.. yet it isn't.
---
Likewise.
---
I kind of wish one of the Whitesprings vendors was dedicated to selling non-luxury CAMP plans, as an option.
---
If the servers werent running on potatoes that would be perfectly fine. But since they are its never gonna happen.
---
I'm sorry if the OP's camp got razed but I've been playing since launch and I haven't had any PLAYERS destroy any camp I've had COMPLETELY. Enemies will wear your built things down if you don't catch the games warning.
---
I've always knew that placing camp in any cherry picking sites was trouble. Think of it, if no camp destructions possible ever then in the future will be complaining when access to WS/WS TS/ any other town is blocked by other ppls base turrets murdering other players who just wanted to go into the town without a  way to destroy said turrets.
---
It wont be all good dude like you seem to think. Imagine running a gauntlet EVERY TIME you need to go to vendors just because some OTHER players wants free kills. 
---
You say you just wanted a waypoint for travellers but imagine the flip side ijs..
---
PS4 as well, 1-2 crashes per session, but disconnects seem to have got better.
---
I'm noticing the same thing in complete honesty. I've repaired my armor lately s lot more than I used to have to. However I'm wondering if its because I play survival a lot. There was talk about dmg calculations working differently in survival to adventure.
---
I‚Äôm in Canada and it‚Äôs hard to convince my friend to buy an 80$ game that constantly is shit on
---
If my stash is not at full max every time I get a bit worried. You never know when 300 bobby pins are going to be useful.
---
Even if that multiplayer isn't inherently versus?
---
I'd say somebody hoarding kills its far more offensive than any of the QoL mods on Nexus.
---
man... I just took a better look at what is Skyrim Together, and I must say... you probably don't want to keep that in your proud list of things you've done...
---
I was wondering why i cant finde one
---
Yes! Double XP was legit! Hope we do this 3 or 4 times a year, that would be great
---
My understanding, which could be wrong, is motion assist servos are for all PA types.
---
Many plans/mods I have seen specify which type "T45 headlamp" ,  "T51 reactive plates" etc).  Obviously, those will not work on other than the named armor type.
---
For the plans/mods that do not specify an armor type, also if I understand correctly, then it applies to all PA types, and can be built as long you have the required materials on hand.  (and I'm sure you know more than one way to acquire Ultracite as raw material for repair/crafting)
---
If the above is correct, then the plan named "motion assist servos" available at (at least one) vendor will work for you.
---
I can confirm it‚Äôs available in game. I met a player who was wearing it. I friended him and tried to convince him to sell but no luck. I‚Äôll try to grill him to see how and when he got it (i.e. plan or item drop) and report any new info I can get. Note: i did trade with the guy and checked the item so it‚Äôs not a skin mod or anything. It is in fact a gas mask.
---
Step 1. Create a new account
---
Step 2. Buy the game again
---
Step 3. Dont cheat again
---
step 4. Enjoy the game
---
I tried for over an hour last week hoping around trying to find the camera on my main with no luck.  Created a new character for this weekend and went to the lighthouse after the overseers camp.  Boom, camera.
---
Sorry my data ran out for gaming
---
This guy! Lol it‚Äôs time to start a rebellion. Across all platforms, everywhere he goes, people should point and laugh and call him something... something disdainful but not incendiary. Everywhere he goes he cannot escape. No one fights him no one trades just taunts and blocks. Give him nothing to fight against. Just scorn.
---
With player vending coming soon i think they will rise it a bit or at least merge with other toons in same account hopefully....
---
Interesting. 
---
The +1 perception legendary effect sounds like it's worse than 40% bash damage.
---
Thanks for the input.
---
Ye player vending will make a huge difference
---
Did you get any of their user names? Might be worth posting here so Bethesda can look into them if they see this post.
---
Once duping is for sure taken care of I think it will probably happen.  I'm sure Bethesda knew at release that duping was possible.  The cap ceiling limits the damage from that.
---
You can look at the turrets and find their name that way and send em a msg... put I agree... maybe when they start these play vendor there will be a way to do that
---
Make caps accountwide. Problem solved
---
Are there still duping issues? I didn't realize, that sucks
---
Thats just it, i actively saw them doing the destruction.
---
Yes, i get their are players that will harass you until you leave for sneezing in the wrong direction, but its to my understanding, CAMP turrets dont acyively shoot at someone who doesnt have a bounty/isnt aggressive.
---
Am i wrong in saying the only people affected by what you said are aggressive players/players with bounties?
---
Ive only been shot at by a players CAMP once, when i had a 5 cap bounty for lockpicking a container i didnt realize was player locked.
---
So, the only people running a "Gauntlet" would be those people actively causing issues, right?
---
Aside from the few accidental bounties.
---
I've got one... and I got it by scrapping one I found.. same as every other helmet
---
Most of what you see online is the vocal minority, and they are typically angry and petulant.
---
Because if you have a single foundation Cap, you literally can.  Just move it an inch to the side, pay to Move CAMP, place the blueprint, done.
---
Are you on PC?
---
Probably the Colt Single Action Army
---
It out performs fo76's servers in every metric.
---
Pool the caps of all available characters you mean? I like it
---
Yep, cap loss changes were Survival mode only, Adventure mode you still lose caps equal to your level. And you're right, I think a good chunk of the people who PvP to farm caps saw that change and went straight back to Adventure mode.
---
I wish people would call it the Cap Cap. I mean it's a terrible pun but it's RIGHT THERE.
---
He Def has it. Have someone hold him for ya so you can reload into the world. Or have them check and buy off the person. I believe it's around 200 for the plan
---
Yeah they should upgrade server stability and then they should add that.
---
Single Action Army
---
I only i goy friday night. Hopefully I can get in tonight before 6pm!!
---
I think some of it is how much your frozen, this weekend I was just a little chilled so it was really hard to notice, it was most visible when I went invisible, as the frost was still there.  Before I was frozen hard and was white with ice all over. 
---
I don‚Äôt remember if I tried killing myself, you would expect so.
---
do the enemies in the main quest and side quests scale with your level. as I have loads of them to do and I'm only just got to watonga and have just started looking for fort defiance? I'm Lvl89.
---
Hey now, not everyone who doesn't lock the resource generator is a noob! I almost always leave all my resource generators unlocked to help out anyone passing through :)
---
If they up the camp budget I might give it a shot but right now to get the overall look I want for my camp I'll just have to live with it.

---
Every camp I have built his been missing one corner square because of this (I like to build large areas) and it drives me nuts, everything else is perfect so that one concrete floor will go in seconds after the patch hits and I will never remove it.
---
It's a mad restriction considering some of the floating camps I have seen so there is obviously a way around it.
---
I was lucky enough to kill 2.
---
No idea
---
Haha, I actually wrote that originally and changed it because I thought it would confuse people
---
I've tried holding him with another player and reloaded dozens of times. Everyone he spawns the same plans.
---
Yeah this is very annoying. I had the final shot last night. It was visible and as it died it wasnt. I looked for about 20 minutes and eventually found it. Completely invisible, a little hint of the camo as I walked very close to it.
---
Quest complete marker should pop on its body for a couple minutes or something.
---
I have the names but will not post them in a while public forum
---
Nope I'm on xbox... you can find it random around the bog...  I've never got it off a creature.. it was just lying on a table somewhere
---
Maybe, I don't know. I've heard them make some dumb claims even if you don't have turrets out. "they have the turrets stored" or other things. The anti turret tower crowd isn't smart and will use any excuse they can to act like griefers, it is why they are anti turret towers, it is the only acceptable way they can grief and be backed by the community. 
---
They just use "turret towers" as their excuse for why its okay for them to grief others bases.
---
Yall make the event sound fun. Maybe because I like the fact that survival doesn't seem promised and seeing the battle goin both ways forcing team support to survive is what Beth wanted. More events need this
---
ew.
---
At queen event I have been one shot killed while in pacifist with no workshops and my power armour insta breaking 
---
Has happened two times total
---
There were some learning moments in this fallout, for sure
---
You got a pic? Cause without any pics (and the fact you could just plug a xbox controller into the pc game) it's easy to take this with a grain of salt
---
You the real MVP
---
If you're solo at Whitespring you can just pop over to the enclave bunker and take a shower instead of using your radaways.
---
Never having completed that quest for myself, I was under the impression that the robots becoming friendly wasn't something that remained true for long?
---
It is pretty sad, I don't see the point in trying to PvP with someone who doesn't want to.
---
I think there was a post on here within the past month where someone had discovered you can get flagged for PvP in Adventure mode if someone hits you and your EC mutation hits them. Similar issue existed for reactive plates though I think they fixed that.
---
I've been at 25K for awhile, I still pick up caps even though it says max. I use them for events to fast travel or buy fusion cores, plans etc. it doesn't take long to hit the 25K though. It's off subject but I have a lot of perk cards - points as well not used. I'd like to see a overhaul of the perk system card - point allowances..
---
This is actually really cool. Have you hit level 100 yet? /s
---
How do you give caps? 0.0
---
Sounds like some creative raidering to me.
---
Wow. Absolutely fantastic. I can tell this took some time to get right. I'll have to add you and come take a look. My base is near the Top of the World as well. Except I have mine on a lake with an acid node (where the flower on the map is). Pretty happy with it but it needs way more decorations. GT is ResoluteSpark19 if you wanna check it out.
---
I'll get one whenever I get home in a few hrs
---
I want flagged by it but they were able to damage me for brief periods of time. I've had friends killed that way.
---
Cheers mate!
---
If I'm being honest, I'd say 6-7/10  
---
Its good, but it doesnt feel natural, theres a lot of open floor space in the middle of the rooms like everyone who lives there is perpetually playing VR and had to clear all furniture out of the way.  
---
Other than that its a good build, maybe a little OTT in the garage with wall decorations though, sometimes less is more
---
Had server hopped at Wavy Willards about 7 or 8 times and didn't find the camera. Tried Uncanny Caverns and every time I tried to enter the caverns my xbox crashed. First time I went to the Miners Monument found the camera. Don't know if it was because it's kind of an obscure place or I just got lucky.
---
Great to know, I'll keep that in mind for when I have a decent enough arsenal to hit up the good farm spots.
---
Buy one item for the total amount of caps you want.
---
This, is REALLY GOOD!. Going to make one myself if you dont mind :)
---
PvP is broken in general. They really need to keep it totally isolated until they get it resolved. I have seen level 300s, bored go get a 5 cap bounty and then go stand at the whitesprings station. They are of course wearing full assassin sentinel, and use this to farm caps. The only way to really beat it is a gamma gun.
---
managed to kill two in the wild never seen them before, my first one I saw, I thought it was a sleeping deathclaw, and would be easy.... Nope took me 5 drums of 5.56 from my explosive handmade whilst screaming like a scared child standing on the concrete base of an electricity pylon, whilst it spammed its thrown attack as it couldn't reach me. The second was easier as I had help from some scorched and their pet scorch beast.
---
From my own experience, Charleston Fire Department is almost always empty of lead weights I assume because so many people go there to farm them. So I can‚Äôt help you really with the exact respawn rate, but seems like you need lead and that I CAN help you with.
---
Eastern Regional Penitentiary yard has a bunch of lead weights
---
Vault Tech University has lead weights both in the fake vault and in a classroom in the same building (no need to switch zones)
---
Flatwoods motel (also very popular, also almost always empty)
---
Events in the ash heap, namely mining events will get you a bunch of lead ore you can refine into lead scrap using acid
---
because bounties DO stay between server hops
---
Grats!
---
You should make one! Make the rules for the attributes whatever you need them to be. I just tried to stick with the general idea of each one. Perception was a stretch for me. That one is the 5 senses. I made it cleaning because your senses are happy when your house is clean. :)
---
What data are you basing this on?
---
The cap loss is now 25% of lvl, down from 200% of level. The Aid loss has been reduced as well, or so I'm told.
---
I've had more trouble in Adventure from assholes attacking my Fusion Core Workshop as a tag team and killing me in 0.5s. Have resorted to heavy defence emplacements around the drop.
---
Yes. Something worthless for 500 caps
---
I tried for a few hours last week hoping around trying to find the camera on my main with no luck. Created a new character for this weekend and went to the lighthouse right after the overseers camp. Boom, camera.
---
I like being able to play in either world.
---
oh hell yes, it is annoying as hell when scavenging to constantly sitting down or laying down.
---
yeah, to reach max Charisma is pretty afordable, one way or another, even at level 3, having the tools from other characters.
---
For alts I use to max Charisma very son:
---
casual underarmor clothes +3, 
---
beer +1, 
---
Sweet Roll (if available) +3. 
---
Grape mentats +5
---
Other options that I don't use are Unyelding pieces (boring), Mothman eggs (inferior to Rolls, don't stack) X,Cell (worse than Grape mentats), Day Tripper (ditto).
---
Its the same game you played before, on slightly better servers.
---
If you stopped because of technical issues. You will enjoy starting back up. If you stopped because of the grind or the drops or the myriad of issues people have with the actual gameplay mechanics... it hasn't changed.
---
bethesda creates a problem to sell the solution
---
Basically. When I transferred all my money from my main to my alt (that I basically just made for kicks) so I could have a sort of savings account, I bought one Bobby pin from my brother for the amount then he bought one from the alt for the same.
---
Agree 100%. I missed out on all of it.
---
Are you sure its not the [Tactical helmet](https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/fallout/images/3/30/Fallout_76_Marine_Tactical_Helmet.png/revision/latest?cb=20181130205512)? and not the Assault Helmet https://i.imgur.com/kZXgRgC.jpg
---
You should still do the mission to get the power armor station bp
---
Can you send messages on pc?
---
Sounds like it‚Äôs high time for a barn raising üòÇüëçüèº
---
The Colt Single Action Army, aka the most famous handgun ever made, Peacekeeper, and Peacemaker.
---
Good tip
---
Meanwhile, on console I had a level 171 attack me when I was claiming a workshop. Me and my teammate killed him, and then he spent the next hour following us around until he found my camp. He then proceeded to tear it down completely. Such community.
---
So my guess is like payday you reset start from zero and get better perks with each prestige rank probably up to 3* hopefully it raises cap and stash limits!
---
I just want my level 25 trophy..
---
I'm level 38.
---
i agree, but if they are set on pvp in adventure through workshops this is how it should be:
---
**Workshop PVP in Adventure Mode should stay in the Workshop**
---
THIS is how it should work:
---
I take a workshop, and i leave the workshop area to go about my business, then, i see someone has contested my workshop
---
I should have 2 options:
---
1) I ignore the contesting player, and i lose my workshop, pvp is over as i've lost my workshop
---
2) I decide to defend the workshop, pvp does not start until I return to the workshop and enter the green-border limit- then PVP is on! PvP can then happen anywhere on the map until either myself or the other player dies.
---
that is it!
---
ill say it again: WORKSHOP PVP in Adventure Mode SHOULD STAY IN THE WORKSHOP
---
none of this "2 players team up, one stalks the workshop owner back to his house, the other then initiates workshop contesting, then the other teammate who has been stalking the other player simply 1 shots them at their house"
---
In the past, they've talked about having the CAMPS remain even after logging out.  I'm not sure if anything will come of that.
---
There is a mounted alien head in the taxidermy place where Lying Lowe is started, I haven't tested it myself, but maybe that would count for the pic of an alien challenge?
---
Wait, you have a shielded casual underarmor? I thought the protective lining was unobtainable due to a bug which makes the shielded lining also unobtainable.
---
Or drowning yourself in toxic water when you don‚Äôt click the right pixel for bloodleaf that‚Äôs half submerged
---
That's not why I wear it, but it is a good fringe benefit.
---
Playing the game daily and being a trader. It isn't often that someone doesn't have a level 100+ on their account, unless they are brand new to the game. Leveling rates don't slow down, so leveling doesn't slow down either.
---
Also, bethesda did say the average play time people who play the game play for is 4hours+ so if people are playing 4+ hours at a time, they are going to have high level characters very quickly.
---
Nope it doesn‚Äôt unfortunately
---
Is it one per server? If not,  I can find the dude at whitesprings on pc and just hang out there.
---
Anybody that goes to adventure mode to PvP is a scrub.
---
 It just means they can't hang with the big boys on the PVP servers so they have to go pick on people who don't want to PVP. 
---
Brush them off and know in their sorry little existence it makes them feel better knowing they can kill someone.  Even if that someone doesn't want or care about PVP.
---
I feel pity for people who play that way. They just aren't good enough to play and survival.
---
The Z-Fighting will be getting fixed in Patch 9.  I got a response from one of the CM's in my post here: https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/bgzinw/walls_clipping_through_floors/
---
Aways love to see others builds will def give an add!
---
Went from 60 to 80 and havent used a point since i wanna try to fix my build into a good rifle build but im too lazy to look one up. I really thought about making another character but theres still so much to do on my main.
---
I use maxed sneak, covert op, all 3 rifleman, bloody mess and tank killer. Escape artist and the armour repair chance (can‚Äôt remember the actual name lol) are handy too. I use a suppressed 2* instigating gause rifle for sniping and a tse handmade for what‚Äôs left. 
---
I switch between this and a heavy weapons/power armour build as at level 120+ you can easily balance special points to give yourself a couple of different perk load outs so you can vary play styles depending on what you are doing.
---
No kidding.  I don't know how many I've got stashed away, but it feels like a chore to hike up to a radio station, clear it out, plug in the request, then hike all the way across god's green country to the drop zone to get a short hunting rifle, more stimpacks, and some random ammo that I don't use.
---
Anything to make the things more useful would be nice.  *Allegedly* you can get plans and other useful things from them.  I'm pretty sure it's a myth though.
---
Im pretty sure, but not positive; that these run on two systems, if they junk is in the world, it is lootable to you, ie, no one else has taken it yet, unless, if you have already taken that particular junk from any server, in that case I believe it is just gone to you on all other servers for 20 hours. At least this seems to be what has happened with me and a friend, I haven't tested it, just an anecdotal experience of the two of us.
---
Absolutely, went up about 30 levels and got to fight the sheepsquatch, which was a lot of fun
---
&gt;most people
---
Some people.  I don't see many on any server over 80.
---
Congrats
---
Same here.  Ever since Patch 5, Grahm's inventory has basically mirrored Watoga Station for me.
---
I assumed he has unique plans when he starts, but it's a first-come-first-serve kind of thing.
---
Just out of curiosity, is that a professional knowledge opinion, personal observation as an educated guess, or just wishful rhetoric?
---
I only as as just because you 'think' something can work doesn't mean it can. It is like saying a 1964 Shelby Cobra Daytona Coupe went from 0-60 in 4.5 seconds so a bigger car like a 2018 Dodge minivan should do it faster. It is nonsensical.
---
it is one of his rarest plans
---
It was awesome. Went from level 36 on Thursday to level 57 yesterday. All thanks to whitesprings and scorchbeasts, 900+ xp per scorchbeasts
---
That doesn't mean they don't have other higher level characters on their account and are playing on a second or even third character. Sorry I wasn't clearer, I mean have, as on their account. Not that they are playing.
---
Loved the double XP. Wish I'd had more time to play!
---
I don't remember the level, but I found one in Survival. Another higher level guy shows up and starts dropping mini-nukes on it. I'm melee... He only killed me once somehow from the nukes though.
---
I have a single piece of casual cloth that I bought like three months ago.
---
I use it to level alts: +3 CH and +3 INT (it raises xp won +6%) 
---
I've been trying to buy some more shielded casual pieces at reasonable prices or the shielded casual plans with no sucess.
---
You doing this in Adventure or Survival mode?
---
Either way, I'm interested. GT is raidenbckbckfwd. If I'm reading your requirement of a character around lvl 20ish right though I'll need to make a new character to prep first.
---
Same, I like this game a lot. If there were 2 things I could change it would be the amount of time I spend managing my inventory and the amount of crashes/disconnects (typically 1 per hour), but outside of those issues I‚Äôm enjoying it a lot. Went from level 60 to 85 this weekend after taking 2 months off.
---
As a PS4 player, I find it hard to find a server with enough high levels to attempt the current end game bosses. This would be a good solution.
---
Dam that thing must be a proper bullet sponge!
---
It's permanent once you do the quest. If you attack one, it might fight back, but the other robots won't care.
---
Im really glad you like it mate! and hell yes! Ohio need's some love too!
---
I did enjoy the xp boost - "finished" my heavy weapons and sneak vats characters, getting most of the perk cards. I really wanted to start another character, but I'm thinking I'll wait for the backpack mod to come in, hopefully you can start leveling with it early.
---
If you server hop the BBQ Shack you'll get the Free Range event eventually and there's a Sheepsquatch at the end (two if you do it with others). I pretty much farmed that event this weekend lol I even solo'd the event with all three Brahmin still alive once.
---
Very nice. I'd like to have the option to fast travel inside a place I want to go to. That's pretty much it. Cant wait for backpacks.
---
Lol - so he sounds like a virtual god then. As long as he‚Äôs grinding ground babies everything is right with the world?
---
The real galaxy brain is not using power armor in the first place.
---
I don't really use PA as much as I should because of the head bobbing. Its not as bad as it was in FO4 but used to give me really bad headaches
---
Got my platinum by taking advantage of it
---
Damn, I haven't played in a while.  I wish I'd have known about it.  Did Bethesda do emails, SN, or anything?
---
He should take a capture of it to prove it. :D
---
The guy that gave me the power armor messaged me the following......‚ÄùIf you ever need help anytime message me and I will help you no matter the cost.‚Äù  That‚Äôs a quality individual.
---
we need something like a visitor log-book when visitor could write something and this also could help to know if our camps is in common location
---
Is it related to the time of day? Like the nocturnal legendary effects.
---
Lucky Hole Mine in excavator armor will net you about 400 lead ore. Smelted with super duper you can get a lot.
---
Server hop and get on a server without the nuke in that area.
---
You should definitely talk to the murder church guy. And the catapult trader.
---
It's a video game, better he be a troll in a game than a sociopath in real life. Bethesda have you tools to avoid them, block and server hop- you don't have to deal with them again.
---
But, also realize that there's a rule against witch hunting, so your post will likely get removed if you don't take it down.
---
The most common explanation I've seen for dick behavior, is that they're role playing. Perhaps they're just being a raider. Perhaps they just have no friends and nothing better to do. But trying to smear their name makes you the bad guy.
---
Nah, I have Instigating gauss. When I‚Äôm sneaking it deals x2.15 damage without perk 
---
With perk it should do x3.25 I believe
---
But it still does x2.15
---
honestly its been up and down for me on PS4- when i first started playing in december, it crashed all the time
---
then they banned dupers and the game ran great for like 2 weeks
---
then, ever since, its been bad again
---
server disconnects, CTD, in game freezes in inventory while trying to eat things
---
Swg?
---
my bad.  I'm being pedantic.  I think there is a good majority of players who are still under level 100.  My wife and I have been playing since launch and we are only 47.  Parenting/work/etc doesn't give us opportunities to get lots of hours in plus we tend to fart around building our camps and exploring more than grinding for levels.
---
if they would just let mods be open  then we could get all the bugs fixed in like 1 week
---
Trading posts are not allowed here anymore.
---
And you Runned around it? What if you could scare it away!? It's rare to find wild perfect preservet pie alive and you almost scared it away!
---
rats.
---
Well, it was worth a try
---
Should've searched around on the ground he goes invisible
---
Sweet! And I'll take any advice you've got to make my base a bit more homey. I plan on staying here for quite a while since it's close to the middle of the map.
---
The most fun I have had with Fallout 76 came with a "community event" that was made completely by players themselves. Someone turned their C.A.M.P. into an arena with seating, viewing areas, a bar and the whole works. Everyone would get on voice chat and cheer on PVP fights in the arena. Players made bets on each on who would win and so on. IMO, I really wish Bethesda would make organizing community events like fight clubs and flea markets much easier by adding some features to support gathering a lot of people on one server.
---
Really? I‚Äôm sorry then
---
I tried that once too - vloosh* went right down the shitter.
---
Nope.
---
Yeah, sometimes. Didn't figure out why, but my sneak damage modifier varries from time to time with same gun
---
Its kinda hard to use anything but rifles or pistols as secondary for Heavy builds since melee and shotty perks which would be more powerful are both in strenght as is heavy gunner
---
On PC, the OSD says to use 'Q', but the reality is, whatever your V.A.T.S. key is, that's what makes zoom work
---
Hah, good on them!
---
This is not true. I don‚Äôt believe it‚Äôs OK to say, ‚Äúwell as long as he‚Äôs not being as asshole in real life he can do what he likes online.‚Äù
---
Second, I don‚Äôt buy the excuse that role-playing as a raider gets you off the hook for anything. 
---
Bethesda implemented the reporting player feature for a reason. And I have had enjoyable PvP experiences with players in game without them yelling ‚ÄúFUCK YOU‚Äù at me for no reason. 
---
He wasn‚Äôt role playing and having fun - he was being an asshole. This is the only time since launch I have reported someone. And if warning the community about a player like him is a ‚Äúwitch hunt‚Äù then so be it, but I disagree.
---
Sandman only works at night
---
A guest book.
---
Its not the price of it its hes concerned its going to eat up his limited data i ternet connection.
---
Wait what? Why? There is no info on perk card
---
So much fun! Went from level 33 to level 50
---
Totally agreed on the PvP being limited to the workshop. My post/suggestion was really more to deal with the fact that if the owner is already at the workshop it's really easy to get ganked because the attacker gets to choose the exact moment PvP is initiated.
---
If workshop owners were given the ability to initiate PvP against unwanted visitors this would help them avoid this. Though obviously this would also allow workshop owners to initiate PvP on friendly visitors who had no intention of contesting as well. A great solution /u/re-bobber mentioned in this thread was to have a countdown timer activate prior to PvP initiating in order to give any players who don't want to participate in PvP time to leave the area.
---
I think I was more scared of it than it was of me!
---
And also one for pvp, and also one for whatever Nuclear Winter ends up being..
---
It's a cool idea, this just isn't the way to go about it.
---
Energy weapons hit like wet noodles already why would you even consider grounded if you're going to use them?
---
There‚Äôs not? I thought I‚Äôd said it I‚Äôll check rn
---
I don‚Äôt think it takes up that many resources. I have over 1000 hours in and I‚Äôve never gone over my internet cap
---
https://np.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/bigeay/meta_trading_posts_are_no_longer_allowed_on_rfo76/
---
I wonder if that's a static spawn point, or if it has a rare chance to spawn in place of moldy food?
---
 I have noticed my Twisted Muscles downside of 35% less accuracy seems to do nothing as I don't use VATS. I can pull off my headshots just fine, even with no Class Freak slotted.
---
Maybe an option to Autohide the Codes for people who want to do it on their own (if there even are some) :D
---
How is VATS in PA a big miss? 
---
Here's me using VATS in PA https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2PQrqbthn4
---
Emergency protocols only does this in case you forgot: When installed on power armor speed is increased by 25% and damage received is reduced by 50% when the wearers health is below 20%. 
---
Core drain is okay with just 1 rank in power user. Combine that with the infinite cores you get from whitesprings and i completely fail to understand your point.
---
I have Russian client of the game so maybe it‚Äôs problem of translation
---
https://www.falloutbuilds.com/fo76/perk=1056
---
You do realize that private servers will be a source of income for them right? All will be through Bethesda and whatever server provider they choose.. this is why they haven't put any kind of real focus on making money with atoms, the real money will come with private servers at the end of the year.
---
So yeah, whatever private server you play on, you will be creating your share of demand that helps put a little bit of someone else's money in Bethesdas pocket.
---
Can confirm, hundreds of hours of farming WS and West Tek, lucky server is a thing.
---
"fuck the rest" probably not the best idea.
---
 I don't use VATS, but I had to bind Q to it, to make the zoom work.
---
I'm on Xbox, hope that doesn't matter üòÅ
---
I don't think it's on a global timer like that. I server hopped a lot last night for some lead and sometimes 2-3 hops in a row I would be finding lead and then nothing for a couple more hops.
---
Ok you saved away. I wanted to prepare my execution platoon.
---
I saw that. I am too!
---
I also use an instigating gauss with covert op and sneak maxed, maxed riflemen perks and bloody mess. I‚Äôve honestly never even looked at the sandman perk.. but I will now!
---
It‚Äôs says ‚Äúat night silenced weapons do additional 50% sneak damage‚Äù that‚Äôs at rank two and my source is fallout builds website
---
yea its different each server but not sure if its one
---
You just gotta find a spot, I look for tin cans more than weights now. Seems to be much more bang for your buck and people always run past them. Flatwoods and the Firestation are 90% of the time empty because those two spots are the first thing that show up when googling lead farming for fallout 76. Just gotta find another spot that isn't well documented and farm there or else you are going to be hopping a lot more often.
---
One example is the one-week Fasnacht event.  When the event was active, players from across the server would gather to complete the event for potential loot and costume pieces.  The event was rife with opportunities to sabotage things (from killing the quest NPCs, to blocking their progress so that the event didn't complete).
---
Where plenty of other situations can (and sometimes do) result in chaos, things went surprisingly well during these events.  In my several *hundred* attempts at completing this event, I witnessed outright griefing only 2 times (neither were successful), and only failed the event once or twice due to errors or inattention.  Maybe it was the nature of the event, being limited time, or maybe I was just profoundly lucky, but I though the community cooperated nicely, at least for that one brief week, and pulled together for everyone's sake.
---
I know, luckily I‚Äôm melee
---
Why dont you just go into the Nuke Silos and gather the dumbbells for lead, server hop and do exactly the same again :x Everything you need in just two or three runs
---
I think that's a console-only perk.
---
Raising cap limits or allowing for a cap pool doesnt remove caps from the in game economy.  So it doesnt change anything theyll just cycle back and forth between players as more and more enter the market.  Prices will only keep going up and up.
---
I love you, is this a suggestion? no? i still love you.
---
Also, I can‚Äôt see how my post is a witch hunt at all. I‚Äôm not instigating anything. I‚Äôm not harassing him. I‚Äôm not doing anything except warning others to stay away from him. 
---
And if his behavior is excused by him playing as a raider, and someone seeks him out to fight him in-game isn‚Äôt that what he **wants**?
---
Ok now I see. In Russia it says that 
---
Ur silences weapon do 50% more damage while sneaking attacks.
---
Can we help you in some way with the map? sending you something like some herbs or moobs spawn ?
---
BTW it will be very cool a challenges section too.
---
well it's only a 12% reduction if class freak worked right
---
Excavator armor doesn't have much rad protection.  The best radiation protection you can get from power armor (AFAIK) is the X-01 suit.  Hopefully they'll release the FO4 paintjobs that enhanced rad resistance too.
---
[You can find a listing of all of the armor stats for max level armor \(45-50\) here](https://old.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/a0iq9v/all_max_level_power_armors_stats/)
---
Patch 8. That's when data miners found [the perk card](https://imgur.com/a/UchNpQM) as well as experience with fighting her with 12 people and actually winning.
---
No, the atomic shop tells you which suits you can apply it too
---
&gt; They never gave a really good explanation as to why we have to talk to robots for every goddamn thing.
---
Sure they did. Everyone either turned into scorched or were killed by said scorched. That's also why one of the very first main quests has you finishing the vaccine research so there's an in-game explanation for why us vault dwellers don't contract the disease.
---
Found Ansel at the Tyler County Fairgrounds - [https://imgur.com/PSCmdwC](https://imgur.com/PSCmdwC)
---
Yeah, I'm pretty sure it was somewhere in the Ash Heap. I've recently started questong in that region. Usually, the enemies are ones I can handle, but I sometimes come across one that's in the 50s or 60s range, and I run like hell. This was one of those times. Lol
---
I‚Äôm on regular PS4 and in a 5 hour play session I‚Äôll get 3-4 crashes and 1-2 server disconnects.
---
Congrats! just got lvl 450 (thanks double xp). Cant wait to become member of 500+ club!
---
it's not always there but yes that is a spawn point for the pie
---
Good to know, as I haven't bothered to do much PvP apart from melee against players who wanted to loot free junk off me, or who had some axe to grind for whatever reason. What about using the enforcer perk with shotguns, stabilised with PA and heavy weapons, or tormentor with rifles do they all stagger too?
---
Remove all your perks and then put them back on. Class freak with grounded works correctly for me
---
So I find out about this on monday. Great
---
Yeah i new that but I didnt know that laser sniper rifles are the same too everything has just been me being an idiot
---
Well yea of course I know about that but I‚Äôm talking about spawning randomly around the map there super super Rare sometimes they spawn at abandoned bog town but that‚Äôs the only Place I‚Äôve seen them spawn in 600 hrs of playtime
---
double xp and still 0 fallout story elements
---
Not the person you replied to, but there's been tons of games that have accomplished far more, with far more players, many as long as 20 years ago. Being able to expect a modern day company to be able to pull off a simple thing like this.. it isn't like your example in any way.
---
The issue here is that they're using a game engine that was never intended for online play, and that's why there's issues like this.. that's why we can't actually expect servers to perform as well as any game that *was designed for online from the ground up*. But all things considered, they've done a truly great job making it work at all!
---
Maybe you haven't played Anthem, but that game *should* have the kind of stability we describe here, because it has no excuses.. it should have been designed for online play, it isn't using some old game engine, etc..
---
Fallout is actually doing pretty well when you consider how badly that game does, with a newer engine, with fewer players.. I've got more hope for this game by far.
---
I play on an older PS4 and average close to 1 crash per hour. I‚Äôve put 100 hours into FO76 and 100 crashes sounds about right.
---
The prototype is the only ultracite paint available for atoms. It‚Äôs a shame as I have the wasteland wander, camo, patriot and blackbird sets and they‚Äôd all look amazing on the ultracite lol.
---
I wish that‚Äôs how the perk actually worked
---
Killed many sheepsquatch. And muties. And ghouls. And Annihilator MKII‚Äôs. And Scorchbeast. Went from 134-154, almost enough points to rebuild! It was great.
---
Yes to all this. Add mr.sandman at night, during the day I switch it with adrenaline with 2 points.
---
Gauss rifle is great for dmg, lever action is great for a balance of dmg and fire rate. The better legendary you can find the better. pve instigating is the way to go.
---
Throw in a fair number of perk points into luck too, more vats critical/better damage, and starched genes so you can have the eagle eye mutation.
---
I've got a few of those puppies in my stash box. Most came from right there (can't bring myself to eat them though)
---
You dont need any perks just run along either of the walls separating the 3 sunk in areas in front of there (has a bunch of paintings and paint cans in the left one facing the pie REALLY good place to get a decent amount of lead for ammo crafting)
---
No kidding? I'll have to give that a try!
---
His above comment says he‚Äôs on Xbox
---
500 hours just playing, scrapping 90% of the weapons I‚Äôd find.
---
Tf2 üòé
---
I think my kid ran across you the other day! He was telling me about the ‚Äúweird Mothman worshippers‚Äù lol
---
Question do enemies stop leveling with you at that level? Or do you run into level 400 enemies?
---
Still interested, you all speak of the "explosive laser rifle", what since it's not obtainable anymore, what about non explosive laser rifle ?  
---
Are they decent ?  
---
Thanks !
---
There was also the Ultracite Raider one, but it‚Äôs gone now.
---
Damn son! That's more free time than I have honestly. I play as often as I can and have only played 350 hours.
---
Im trying to coinvence him.
---
I'm at level 213, and my white whale has been x-01 calibrated shocks.  I spotted them for the first time this weekend and was promptly disconnected from the server.  My husband saw my entire range of emotions: elated to bummed, bummed to laughing...cause of course!  Of course I was disconnected after finally spotting an item I‚Äôve NEVER been able to get from day 1.  Thank goodness for the training forums.
---
I hopped at the monument and got it second try. The initial spawn in point is super close to where the body should appear so it's not too hard to hop there
---
It appears you're promoting a discord server or community. This is not allowed under Rule 5 and your post has been removed.
---
On PSN profiles only 7.8% of players have the achievements for level 100. I‚Äôve put in about 115 hours and am only level 85.
---
Prices have already inflated dramatically since release. Raising max caps seems like a band-aid solution to a damaged market. My understanding is that 1* legendaries used to be sold for max 1k caps if it was just ordinary. Now even the lower-end 1*s are selling for up to 3k caps. Anything high-tier can get well above 25k, even up to 50k. Raising max caps isn‚Äôt going to make the value of the bottlecap any higher. It would actually make it worse with creating a larger barrier of entry for newer/less time dedicated players in the market. If there is a smaller max caps, trading is fucked for anyone who just bought the game or doesn‚Äôt no-life it. Having better and larger ‚Äúcasual‚Äù sources of caps, alongside an easier way of getting good loot is probably the best route to fix the shitty inflation
---
I have a bunker I can show you mine if you are on xbox
---
That still doesnt remove caps from the economy.  Just makes people spend caps less as they focus on getting the legendary they want.  The amount of caps will float back and forth as more and more and more caps enter the economy.   While i do think that the legendary vendor will bring more 3\* rolls to the market, i dont think it will have any effect on things overall, unless its super easy and 3\* flood the market relative to the number of players.  I dont see that happening as that ruins the point of the grind in general.
---
Even with player vending, and players buying/selling back and forth; same problem. Thats just a transfer and not a removal.  Game needs a good cap sink.  Like spending spending caps everytime you use the vendor to get a roll.
---
I‚Äôm on XBone and frequently send messages to Camps I am impressed with! ‚ù§Ô∏è
---
There's a mechanic in the game for the other ones that hasn't been enabled yet that involves maybe killing an enemy of that type to get it. It's not totally clear but they have. A script added on called "unlock taxidermy recipe"
---
Go to Grafton dude a daily event
---
Yeah, it visually stays equiped in your inventory, just like any armor pieces, but they aren't in actual effect.
---
no. SBQ is the highest level i seen. There is no mobs higher than 98 i believe
---
I hate wearing it - the stompy sound makes me nuts. But I DO wear it when wandering swamps and jumping off cliffs.
---
hey man, nice shot.
---
(Everytime I try to take a picture while in combat I get booted up in the air and teleported backwards and the screen crashes black.)
---
Yep, I've also never gotten this to work properly.
---
I know but I didnt know that laser sniper rifles are the same thank you you gave me the idea to check the weapons mods and in its mods is sniper barrel so thank you I would have never found out how to get the pistols mods
---
If you are using a weapon with a silencer, two ranks of Mister Sandman will increase your damage more than 2 additional ranks (5% each) on your rifle perks. You will do less during the day, but the increase at night averages out in your favor.
---
I modified my pistol build (low perception, high agility) to take advantage of a near god tier rifle I got and it seems to work out well investing in bonus perks over damage perks. Why spend 9 perception to increase base damage by a factor of 1.6x when I can use concentrated fire, covert operative, and mister sandman (8 special) to increase it damage by 5x-7x? I only use rank one of the three rifle cards.
---
So while we‚Äôre on the topic of not liking it, for me it‚Äôs not the stomping or head-bobbing but it‚Äôs that weird scrape noise it makes every two steps
---
Yup. I know. I found evidence contrary to my original position and posted it a couple comments above. üòÄ
---
Congrats! I used the weekend to power through from 40 to 56 and am LOVING that I can finally use all the kewltoys I‚Äôve had stashed!
---
Ahhh okay, I‚Äôm about to hit 100 myself and was wondering if enemies scaled health and level wise that high up. I‚Äôm having a hard time with super mutant overlords they‚Äôre just tanks right now for me.
---
I agree!!! Had a blast!
---
I sold my gun and sword from the Mistress quest back when we had the 400 pound stash limit thinking I could make them again.  BS that they do this to players, especially with a item like that camera being used in the daily challenges.  Hope you find one.
---
Mmm that kind of defeats the purpose of trying to kill all the glowing ghouls in the burrows after a nuke.
---
When you say ‚Äúgone for you on other servers‚Äù do you mean it would be invisible for you but a teammate could see and loot it, or that joining the world ‚Äúremoves‚Äù that junk from the world for everyone?
---
I tried some of the PA as container thing, don't know if it could accept anything, but I tried having a huge pile of power cores in one spare frame. 
---
It semi worked and then eventually I messed it up and they all got dissapeared.
---
All that fine tuning delicate thing, to be eventually nothing. Im glad most of the bigger glitches are gone.
---
This looks amazing!
---
She even used to have a fetch quest to bring her chems
---
I was happy to trade a 12% damage reduction for the 100 damage resist (until I realized it was broken).
---
So it's not just me crashing on my way into west tek
---
I tried this and my friend did too - didn't work for us unfortunately (on Xbox, FWIW)
---
Thank you. Not there any more, made myself a tree house.
---
Just so happens VATS is set to the same button as ‚Äúhold breath‚Äù while aiming. Oh well
---
Yeah, but he's not saying that he died. 
---
Oh well. So if it's a glitch, he's the only one who has experienced it, which seems very unlikely.
---
I‚Äôm happy to share - PM me, please. 
---
I‚Äôve got a few great stories to share, both with friends and with total strangers. I‚Äôm also a little outside ‚Äúnormal gamer demographic‚Äù (42/F) and have been a mad Fallout fangirl for many many years.
---
https://imgur.com/5fPusNe.jpg
---
These things are spawning all over
---
Yeah. I guess so.
---
I've done it before is how I know.  Use PA for sustained damage output ie. continuous fire.  VATS is best reserved for high burst damage potential, you sneak a lot better outside of PA, and normal armor has other benefits.  Emergency Protocols will save your life, while your Core Assembly is utterly useless from preventing death.
---
Damage reductions keep you alive, and with a bloodied build you do a ton of damage anyways.  VATS is more of a novelty these days, its not like previous Fallout games.
---
I get more inspiration at how people make roofs. It‚Äôs always the hardest thing to make and not look boring. You did a great job here.
---
Her HP is set at 32k, but she has a special perk that mitigates 70% of all incoming damage before her armor value is even factored in. This gives her an effective HP pool of 106k to start, and then she regenerated at the half way point, effectively giving her 159k HP.
---
There's no RNG or scaling involved whatsoever.
---
Well I don‚Äôt think his views are simply ‚Äúunpopular‚Äù but I will digress. 
---
I read the subreddit rules and I this post can be in violation of it because it mentions his name. Mods can take it down.
---
Supers have low energy resistance. Find laser/plasma with +30% to supers to melt them. Pulse/plasma grenades are handy
---
 too
---
Nope all this weekend I crashed 75% of time. Rule #1: Don‚Äôt die in west Tek with junk on you lol
---
You can fast travel in.  It starts when you're in the vicinity.
---
Mixing Ultracite and X-01 isn‚Äôt a bad idea, actually.  I wish Excavator didn‚Äôt require the helmet to get the extra carry weight bonus.
---
Trading might be fucked in that case for buying, but that won‚Äôt change legendary rolls and what people are paying for them at that time. New players can come in, hit a decent level, and start selling their decent rolls just like the next guy.
---
Oh no! Sorry my man, not on PC.

I have been a Fallout Fan for a long time and I enjoy the rush at the launch of a new Fallout game, this one was no different.  Getting a Fallout multiplayer game was going to pose a number of challenges and I was looking forward to seeing how BGS managed those.  Its funny, a few years ago there was a leak about about a multiplayer game called Fallout 76 and a lot of people, including myself, dismissed it since everyone knew that Fallout was strictly a single player experience and the title was not "Fallout 5:XXXXXX".  I read and watched anything I could find about the game pre-launch and I liked what I saw.  The "Whitesprings" demo, where the game was revealed to various influencers for some hands on play looked promising.  My first concerns arose during the beta.  It was not like any beta I had participated in before,  it seemed more like a stress test than an actual beta test and knowing this was going to be a mishmash of Fallout code/resources and bolt-on netcode I thought the game would need a number of beta sessions to sort out the inevitable issues that were sure to arise.  The voices of the critics swelled into a chorus of complainers in no time and Fallout 76 supporters started taking a lot of flak in game and on social media.  And there were serious problems that spoiled the game for a significant number of people to be sure that were magnified during the game's launch and Bethesda seemed overwhelmed without a strong social media presence/community representatives to help.  I met people playing the game who told me there were there to grief other players and drive them away because they wanted the game to die.  That is some hard core hate and I did not really understand the source of that, and I still don't.  Even with all that I still enjoyed playing the game and I was determined to stick with it.  I feel Fallout 76 is something unique, and as long as BGS was willing to work to make it better I want to keep playing, after all it was a Fallout game which I liked, in a unique setting that I liked, with a unique story line that I liked that involved solving a mystery.  It was also buggy, sometimes items were lost, server connections were tenuous, claiming a workshop often did not return the investment due to disconnects, let alone workshops being pvp zones that you needed to defend to keep the benefits which attracted some nasty minded people at times.  Then there were the exploits people were using to crash servers intentionally, and those people were using to duplicate rare items into the millions which created a black market that some players felt forced into participating in to 'keep competitive'.  Fortunately Bethesda countered by patching to correct problems (which sometimes created new problems or reinstated problems previously patched) and then they got better at patching problems and communicating their intentions beforehand and demonstrating they were responsive to reasonable player concerns and implementing a stronger community presence.  They started adding new content too.  And they got complaints about that, but even so people were enjoying the game more.  Initially I was an adamant  solo player avoiding teaming and trading (there were rumored problems with trades and I was not willing to try it until I was certain they were fixed) but I did enjoy very much the communal events that popped up in various places and portions of the reddit community (shout out to the Filthy Casuals especially) became more supportive of the game despite the toxicity elsewhere which was encouraging.  I began to have pleasant game-related conversations with other players on occasion and actually joined some teams which I found more fun than I thought they would be.  I was surprised at the number of women playing and even found fun young people I could play with (I am more towards the old codger end of the spectrum).  Each month that goes by sees the game get better and I note there are fewer and fewer encounters with anti-social types as well.  My hope is that this trend continues for the life of the game and I am encouraged by the responsive actions of Bethesda and the members of the gaming community.   Fallout 76 is fun to play and that keeps me coming back and I suspect that will be the case for a long time, I sure hope so.
---
I'd also be interested in seeing footage of a level 45 soloing the Imposter.  
---
Cause that's hard to believe.
---
There aren't. At least not on xbox. That last vendor patch put a bullet into it. I think it's gone forever now. Everyone that played in the first few months now have a crazy leg up on everyone who didnt. A couple months ago, you could buy the best weapons and armour for dirt cheap. Today, trade only. So if you dont roll something amazing (very very slim chance) you can't get anything amazing
---
Got me from level 50 to 75, so I‚Äôd say it went well
---
Mine is bugged.  I used to be able to read the description and look at the sample images and now I can only click x to pay and unlock.
---
That's from where the bombs launch when someone nukes an area.
---
That's the nuke silo where the missiles come out
---
Quest items should all be plans you learn so you never have to go thru this. Lock them to individual players like atom items so you cant craft them for others, only yourself. But no one would have to worry about scrapping or selling the wrong thing again.
---
Can you camp there and watch them launch?
---
I have a 3 star Medic's flamer I have been holding on to for a team medic build. Man it is eating up useful stash space though.
---
Yes.
---
And then he delets his comment, lol. That guy is very often swearing and yelling at people, i doubt he would last long in the other sub
---
I don't even have the camera yet
---
But that wouldn't really match the storyline. You are putting yourself on a tech's whitelist. As a tech you should be able to attack one to test it out defenses and not have all the others attack you.
---
Oh, look, the next trade stealing glitch. This week it's armor breaking faster than normal. *Yeah*, a few other people chime in, it *is* breaking faster now that you mention it! No, sorry, zero proof of any of anything stated, especially the part where it *happens by itself at camp.* But take our word for it, it's a conspiracy to sell repair kits that are worse than the ones you earn in game. I don't even use White Knight, just Fix It Good, and there's been no difference. Prove it.
---
That looks pretty awesome. Nice and open.
---
I like this idea. In FO4 I use a mod that lets me swap legendary effects to different gear, so when I inevitably get a cool cripple effect on something stupid like a pipe pistol I can at least add it to a weapon I would actually use. Something like that would be great in 76.
---
I mean, economically speaking, money ebbs and flows from place to place without ever really going away, and we constantly print more. Maybe adding in being able to purchase unlocked buildable items for caps in lieu of using junk would be a good way to eliminate caps from the market, or make modifying and repairing items at certain locations, like the Whitesprings vendors, have a caps option as well.
---
It didn't occur to me, but you're right, this is another benefit of power armor!
---
I'm really annoyed because of the myriad of combat challenges involving "kill 1000 robots with X," I had decided that one day I'd get around to farming Watoga to knock out those challenges, but now there's pretty much no reason to do all that now just for a few atoms.
---
I see.  Ominous indeed - thank you.
---
It needs video. I was able to get a lot of "rooms" with branches for walls, and a branch archway entrance.
---
LOL yes. so way back when my 18 year old was 2 i read an article about how pc gamings detrimental affect on the social interactions of people could be counteracted by putting the PCs in an open space. I adopted that philophosy but i do have regrets from time to time.
---
I think that's too elaborate and time consuming to actually happen.
---
My favorite is the legendary Super Mutants. They talk shit until you get them down to half health the second time, then they run away screaming üòÇ
---
I went from level 1 to 43 yesterday. Cha-ching
---
I guess but that such an insignificant detail. On the same logic, you should have to re do the quest when/if you change your character's appearance since you upload a body scan to get on the whitelist.
---
This guy lmao
---
I remember finding one too not in the machine. I think it was on top of a building near the gun range in toxic valley.
---
I‚Äôm on PC and would love to get some 308 if possible. Have random junk or heavy weapon ammo in exchange.
---
I can understand that when they're younger but 18?!  I have two myself, but sometimes you gotta have some no-distractions fun time!  But I'm sure you're a wonderful dad so, that's what's important. :-)
---
As far as I know it's only the two areas in Point Pleasant. Close to the river and inside a bit there between the rows of buildings.
---
Same actually happen to me on ps4. Someone drop nuke on prime fissure site but only 3-4 players invluding me showed up. After 10 minutes of worthless fight everyone gave up and left.
---
I was able to buy the plans off him at level 100+ so I don't think there's a level cap or anything. Can't help you with the plans but I'm on PS4 if you want me to swing through and build one at your camp for you?
---
oh man, sorry.  I was hoping it would help since it worked for me. 
---
Bethesda has a lot of problems when it comes to custom keys.
---
on PC, if you don't use the wasd keyset for moving, good luck getting things done in builder mode.  They override custom keys.
---
It's frustrating, sorry bud
---
Booooooooooooooooooo. Grind like everyone else.
---
Sure.
---
I can tell you how to dupe weapons in Final Fantasy 4 for $25,000 US.
---
Do charging laser rifles give you mods for laser weapons? I don‚Äôt believe they do. I barely know any laser mods and I have scraped many, many charging laser rifles. 
---
In fallout 4, the charging laser rifle was a variant of laser rifles, it was its own weapon, like the laser musket. It had no mods. Try to mod one (can‚Äôt believe in all this time I haven‚Äôt tried). I bet you can‚Äôt mod it. You won‚Äôt learn anything scrapping them, only moldable laser pistols/rifles.
---
Screw the golf course camps, blow them up every time
---
I had him visit me when I was camped on top of the cliffs across the Potomac from Harpers Ferry.  So, yeah, he seems to like the view from cliffs.
---
Make sure to have the super duper perk on
---
You've been gone for a while huh lmao
---
&gt; Eastern Regional Penitentiary yard has a bunch of lead weights. Also inside with all those empty can alarm traps.
---
This is a pretty good spot for lead.  Lots of super mutants to deal with but lots of good lead.
---
Good point...
---
If it does work like that then I can see problems with the servers crashing from hopping, and people not being able to join a particular server with a vendor they want due to it be filled up. 
---
As the other commenter pointed out the vendor could be persistent after logout, but that may create problems with people having their own CAMPS in the same area or close by.  
---
I don't think it would be possible to have everybody's vendors persist after logout and on all servers as well... Is there even enough space on the map with what will probably be over 10k players on a single platform alone? Probably not, and if so the server lag would be insane trying to load all of those items on every server all at once, for every player, 24/7.
---
They could also go the route of creating a single place for everybody to have their vendors at, like white springs. But once again you run into the issues with trying to maintain server performance with all of these vendors persisting across all servers. 
---
The only way possible to pull this off would be to have a machine at your CAMP, which is only available to someone while you are online and on their server. I'm not sure how they would do it otherwise without creating a much bigger problem. 
---
Could be why they are holding it back...
---
I agree with this guy. I have been in and out since launch. I am only level 43 but the game is in pretty good shape right now.
---
I must have been at the same event as you as this is what happened to us last night.  It was awesome!!
---
Sandman is night time only.
---
I'm level 200+ so idk if that makes a difference.
---
Blows my mind they've allowed so many different impossible challenges to be in game for so long.
---
I agree no issues as well, my pvp armor breaks fast as heck but that‚Äôs because of pvp, my pve armor lasts for ages I repair my armor about once a week , my guns last forever
---
I dont get it why they just cant make it to find it so easy. One spot to get it at 100% rate nad thats it. I havent got it either. Ive tried for a while but I dont like wasting my time.
---
Absolutely! They are breaking all 420 laws in all 69 states of fallout and the real world! You should start a gofundme so we can donate to your well being after this incredibly scary and violent situation! The internet is supposed to be a safe place free of bad words and mean behaviour! I‚Äôm extremely sorry you had to go through this, and I‚Äôm sending my thoughts and prayers in these dark days‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
---
Contact bethesda so we can find them and have their throats slit and decapitated as if they were islamic deserters.
---
Sniper is a mod for laser rifles, but ‚Äúcharging‚Äù which is the only thing I‚Äôve ever seen a mutant drop, is a unique weapon of its own class. You don‚Äôt learn mods from them.
---
You know I plumb forgot about that perk! I'll have to pick it next level. Thanks!
---
PS4 is limited to 50 photos in the FO76 gallery. 
---
Its very easy to keep hitting that limit.
---
My understanding is the photos are duplicated on the PS4 proper (so when you delete them from the game menu, they are still available to you at the PS4 level)
---
Thr plan is called powered gates i believe. I would be wary of putting a camp at whitesprings as people often destroy them just because. Up to you though.
---
Things like this killed the dinosaurs. Hopefully it gets fixed soon.
---
Farm events
---
wouldnt that just end up being a rare plan drop?
---
I could definitely add a section for the weekly challenges. As far as herbs spawn locations they are already on the map, though maxed at 300 results. Just search for corn,firecracker etc.
---
At some point in the Brotherhood quest, you get a plan for a brotherhood rifle. 
---
I've never seen a legendary version, but that would be good to have.
---
He's mistaking one helmet for a different one.
---
Well this isn't what you necessarily want but: razorgrain and corn are available at a farm by the creek just south of the tattoo parlor. For glowing fungus, bloodleaf and snaptail, the section of creek between the overseer's camp and Flatwoods is teeming with the stuff.
---
For tarberry I fast travel to the Super Duper Mart in Watoga and head to the creek. I start behind that blue building by the dinner and work my way around the north shore to the alley behind the Mart. For tick blood, I go to the moonshiners shack just south of 76 and then for thistle I heard to just east of Wavy Willard's. I'm trying to think of what else there is. Maybe mutfruit juice but heck I grow that stuff so I wouldn't know where to look other than the farms up north on the border of the Forest and the toxic valley.
---
West Tek.
---
Odds of the exact weapon you want dropping are 3,720 to 1.
---
Also wondering
---
I've found explosives but from imposter sheepsquatch event
---
Fucking trash garbage game lolololol
---
I'd suggest skipping it entirely - 12% if it works correctly is still enough to make a difference given most energy weapons don't do a lot of damage to begin with.  I took Grounded off one character, no regrets...  but I do have it on my other character that doesn't do energy weapons.
---
What do you mean:
---
&gt; but because armor pieces don't have the magic radiation immunity PAs have
---
This doesn't make any sense to me. You seem to say regular armor can exceed PA radiation resistance, then turn right around and say it doesn't.
---
Can‚Äôt believe all these people said farm super mutants. You‚Äôd be better off looking for brotherhood corpses with an old laser rifle on them. 
---
I‚Äôve seen a few but I haven‚Äôt been keeping track of where.
---
Thanks for all you do (and have done sine the start of 76). I especially appreciate the devtracker!
---
If you need the X-01 and ultracite to play, you must be a bullet sponge because I have all the power armors and find myself using the excavator the most, especially for nuke zones. It does enough damage resist - ballistic, energy, and radiation - and I hardly ever have to repair it. Granted, I'm hardly ever not on a team running rad sponge, but I'm always in the thick of it. It's too versatile to be the internet explorer of the PAs. Maybe try it without just looking at the paper numbers. After all, on paper PA looks like it might be viable in PVP, and everyone should know by now that ain't the case. I do appreciate folks like you buying my mods though.
---
&gt; PvP is broken in general. 
---
Yes it is and I don't know if there's any way to fix it if Bethesda isn't willing to do things that will piss a lot of people off.  There's still a lot of gear out there from the early days when duping was rampant.  I've long maintained that the only way to fix it is to remove everything that was made through duping.  And yes, that includes removing them from people who didn't know that the gear was duped. But I don't think they are willing to go that far for fear of the backlash.
---
Raiders are the trashiest faction imo
---
What happens when you stand on it when the nuke comes out
---
The easiest way is to to buy one from someone RNG in the game sucks they‚Äôre not really cheap though
---
4% isnt really bad at all considering getting to 100 takes a bit of time.
---
In RDR2:O according to my trophy list only .7% of people have hit lvl 50
---
I never got one, as far as I know. Finally built one and posted that I wanted to t r a d e it for something, only to have my post pulled because of the new policy. 
---
That would be funny if I finally had one show up in my inventory.
---
As I've experienced it, we could both see the object but when I could not pick it up, I would get the prompt but not be able to interact, however he could and when he did I would no longer see the object. Mind you, this was not testing really, just what we were observing in our play. Lol, I don't rule out server weirdness or Playstation network screwiness. On my own, when I collect items outside of my base, I won't be able to collect them again no matter how many times I seem to hop they are gone altogether for me until the next day.
---
I started to get curious and look into this more and apparently some people think the item reset has to do with the amount collected, which is possible, I do sometimes just collect a few things and then sit on ass talking to others and trading what have you, so I may be in a feedback loop where my thoughts on how it works feed me doing certain actions which fulfill the prophecy lol.
---
Whitesprings over and over and over and over and over and over again lol pick up all the junk to you can sell it
---
Use t60 legs and the x01 torso, getting the calibrated shocks for t60 is easy, and it‚Äôs insane how much cheaper they are to repair. Especially since the legs take most of the damage, this works really well
---
Arms it‚Äôs your choice, I do t60 there too for the ease in repair.
---
He probably got destroyed on Survival and decided to regain some pride on Adventure. Shame he only managed to embarrass himself.
---
Not a lot of info to go on here, but if you feel he was violating the ToS then best course of action is to record his behavior with a tool like FRAPs then use the in-game report function.
---
After reporting a player you will get an email from Bethesda looking for more data, and they specifically request video evidence if its available.
---
i can hook you up with adrenal reaction and marsupial, ign helkaexe. 250 caps each
---
Max out Perception at 15 (mandatory), then Agility as high as you can (9 at least).
---
Strength: Strongback 4, Bandolier 2, Shotgun 3 (30%)
---
Perception: Max Rifleman, Concentrated Fire x1,
---
Agility: Sneak 3, Escape Artist 1, Covert Operative 3
---
Luck: Starched Genes 2, Class Freak 3, Bloody Mess 3
---
Mutations: Speed Demon, Marsupial, others as they suit your style
---
This is just a suggestion based on what has worked for me.  Higher Agility is better, but I split it with strength.  I like the versatility of a rifle and shotgun.  Then Sword of Bastet to save ammo on low levels.  During a Queen event I can swap out Shotgun perks for Heavy Weapons and grab the mini gun out of stash.  With Bandolier you can carry all the ammo you want.  Then learn to NOT carry every stimpak you come across...you just won't need them.  This is such a fun build!!
---
That's where I'm built too....mine is more meth shack looking though, lol.
---
Do levels mean anything past 50?
---
Could be, I haven't seemed to be able to do that in a while now. In the past I could but now it seems like if I take it it's gone til at least tomorrow, but like I said above it could be my own feedback loop and confirmation bias.
---
Hi, what's the angle? Good, bad, neutral? What's going to be the tagline or don't you know yet? Happy to communicate privately if you don't want to say all that here. Also did EGM approach you for the piece or did you pitch this to them?
---
Not entirely true.  Money gets destroyed on a regular basis, as the gov prints more money.  Also money tends to gravitate in geographical economies and tend to be isolated after that.  So the dollar going to products in china etc.  Also things get thrown away en mass as well, that doesnt happen as much in fallout.  Rate of ingoing vs. rate of outgoing isnt even close or balanced.  Also the value of money is in flux relative to other markets, here there is only one market, per platform and they dont intermingle to balance it out.
---
Humans are creatures of convinence, so conceptually, for Bethesda,  they would have to make it convenient to spend caps in game through the vendors or some other means, in large quantities.  Making everything cheaper to purchase in game (plans, junk, etc.) would be an easier way that way its easier to buy from a vendor and fix there rather than barter outside the game.
---
I did both times, all over but nothing. Still got the complete event at least and some of the cows made it home. Next time I'll look at the spot I see the beast drop, thanks for letting me know! 
---
and just to check, you are talking about the real beast, not the sheepsquatch imposter correct?
---
Is it in the stairs section? If its not, check the defense section, i remember there being a stair platform in there, maybe its a variant of that?
---
Forgot to mention but yes I did report him. My original post violated the subreddit rules so I had to repost.
---
I dont usually see many people attack other camps at whitesprings and just to make sure I will be placing rocket turrets on almost every corner.
---
It's more the ones near the golf club that get attacked, because they are pointless. I want to place my camp closer to popular locations so that I can actually sell my items through the vending machines
---
Plans pop in and out if you jump him with a friend. The enclave is like that though, you'll see 1 or 2 x01 mods instead of 3, someone already bought it.
---
The plan I didn't think existed until I found it recently was domestic kitchen tables, and that was on grahm. I don't know if they added it to his loot table or if it's really rare, but there it was. I've seen the starburst clock a couple times. He walks right by my camp so I see him quite a bit.
---
Yes I am
---
Yes it did but the Wendigo still agreed
---
If we get this we should also have proper windows for other wall sets. There's currently no glass in any windowed walls so rain and crap can just come inside.
---
Works with railway rifles. Finally found a decent one and crafted and scrapped 8 to learn mods, only to find later I was 80 pounds over weight limit, turns out scrapping one gives you 100 spikes.
---
I think another good way of going about it would be to make the legendary vendor cost caps per star, or process. something small but significant.  300 caps per star or like 1k per 3\*.  Something cheap and easy.  Or lowering the price of the targeting card for the sheep squatch and seperating the loot tables for the queen and the sheepsquatch.
---
But I've never heard anyone say her \*hp\* scales with the number of opponents, just her damage resistance. So I don't understand how this clarifies anything.
---
Thanks for your honest feedback! That may actually be my PoV because I really do hate empty middle of rooms. I will upload a video tour for better perspectives. I appreciate your rating! I'll work at even less empty middles next time.
---
Data mined?
---
Pilaged Watoga bots for months on end and found 80% of all my explosive weapons in that desolate city... It has forced me to find a much better method of farming, but I ain't telling anyone because it would be patched / Hotfixed this exploit is so damn good. Don't ask either, this is one secret method I'm taking to the grave and it's better than any weak dupe glitch. I'll say one thing about it... Everyone is killing legendaries the wrong way...
---
Someone who insults you with verbal curses and stuff like that is not a raider and he is not roleplaying. Someone like that is not a Raider nor a Roleplayer i just want to repeat that for clearification. Roleplayers don't do such stuff and never will. As a Roleplaying Raider i really don't like it that this is a common topic in this sub and that Roleplaying is getting mixed up with Rulebreaking behavior.  He/She/It is either a troll or some Social Akward violent tempered. You deal with such people exactly how you would in reallife. You ignore them and don't feed them. You report them so they get banned for this behavior and you will set em on your ignorelist so you never meet again.
---
No worries, I'm by no means the best and theres plenty of better advice out there but that's just my 2cents I guess haha. Thanks!
---
The Vanguard is really good but considering that there will be a lot of damage from the Assaultrons and Sentry Bot, Troubleshooter's would probably be a little better. I would go with Troubleshooter's but that's because I like to have a few rads on my side (for Radical).
---
Thank you!
---
Never tell me the odds
---
I don't run PA in the normal environment, but for nuke zones I'd use it just to up my rad resistance. That being the case, I'd opt for the stuff with the best rad res., which is ultracite or x-01. And while they are at it, they are *way* better in the other resistances, too. I just don't see the point of excavator beyond getting mats for the other armors, hence the IE function.
---
 A big part of my game is finding my own stuff. Have fun with your "economy". ;)
---
Good suggestions.
---
I swear I am taking more damage in my full set of excavator power armor. I have no real data to back that up. I just noticed I am taking more damage than before the last patch.
---
I don't have an answer for you but a possible method of testing this would be traveling to watoga and see how much damage you take from a single bot with both sets of armor.
---
Nice. I was hoping for a tantric experience.
---
Bobs are getting stronger until lvl 120 or something. After that just perk cards and respec points. And more punishment for playing survival
---
Sometimes I really enjoy just having a modern, familiar CAMP, I actually have a garden here that I didnt really get a good picture of but I'll upload a video tour on youtube and update the post with it . Thanks for your comment!
---
That's a good idea, I'll give that a try üëç
---
Troubleshooter by far
---
I like the idea. Nothing like looking for events to do,and there are 8+ on the left side of the map, and none on the right. Even the events on the right don't give lvl 50 rewards.
---
you sure? mine says it was 12% ..but when i took class freak off the damage didnt change ..you might want to test that as well
---
Solo pvp in power armor is a really bad idea. It's big, loud and squishy and you're always the target. DR means nothing to anti-armor guns. If you insist on using it I would recommend emergency protocols and getting bloody. We have a heavy gun PA user in our group that does really well but he's always the target while I'm hidden and rarely die. 
---
It probably helps to have Assassin's Sentinel but to be fair, they die pretty quickly too. PVP in this game is about your gear (more damage output than armor), using the terrain to your advantage (a lot of hiding/chameleon) and build. Pretty much everyone is a glass cannon these days and bloody is king.
---
I was looking on Ebay for a copy of 76 for a friend. I swear about 70% of the results are legendary weapon sales. Super frustrating having no way to filter that out.
---
mix and match your PA to get the best of all worlds. I wear an X01 helmet for the glowing red eyes. T51 torso because that is the jetpack plan I found. T60 legs and arms because that is the mods I have and they are cheap to repair.
---
I tried excavator arms, hoping Id get the mining bonus. But no go there.
---
Except the excavator. all or nothing there.
---
Better off farming Canned Coffee with CanDo, 25%water and 300 AP regen. You can completely negate the slow walk while over encumbered.
---
Did I say anything about a helmet? I answered op question lmao feed me down votes
---
Level up through the main quest a bit. Following the overseer. Don‚Äôt go for the rose quest line for a while. After getting decent armor and weapons farm the white springs golf club for weapons and armor.
---
Just a very precise ratio :-)
---
Or run AWOL Armaments in both. I use troubleshooter in the silos bloodied and have no issues. Leather is good for energy but you need some ballistic resistance. I am the designated silo runner for our clan, so I always use the best troubleshooter I can find.
---
Tottally forgotabout double Xp and it was even posted. Fml
---
This. 
---
Or any place that has a decent chance of legendary mobs spawning.
---
 Combat Armor Dense mod is gone. A plan I've never seen.
---
 BoS mods are pretty rare. ;(
---
Haha thanks. Mole rats and lv 1 scorched just need a whack from my camera hand and they're dust.
---
The single greatest benefit of PA. They really need an "are you sure?" Message before you use a chair or bed.
---
The other day I took my unarmed tank to the Watoga train station and smacked the lowest level of a three player team. The other two reversed course and walked straight at me. I got one before the other two got me. On the respawn, I took all three out plus another on the respawn. After they got me again, I got a nice 100 lbs of junk off one of them. They opted to fight me again, I stashed the junk, came back, and accepted the duel. 
---
We went back and forth a bit with myself coming out on top. Not trying to flex or anything. After all was said and done, they were convinced I was cheating. They told me they all filed (false) reports against me convinced I was a leet hacker. They told others I was hacking and encouraged them to report me as well.
---
An open dialogue helped to cool them down a bit. But they still pegged me as the asshole for winning a duel they all accepted.
---
I guess my point is, in relation to your post, it does not matter if you act as a friendly duelist or hate-spewing douchebag; we are all labeled as griefing assholes. What's the point of being a friendly PVP player if we all get treated the same as actual assholes?
---
I kinda like the nights, it makes it easy to use stealth and great to see the beautiful world Bethesda took a long time creating.
---
You might get a drill.
---
And plenty of boards.
---
I pointed out the confusion the person you responded to had. No idea why you are crying about downvotes, I had nothing to do with any of that.
---
Yeah i wish it was more consistent across the environment, but I've noticed it depends on the server. If i experience any lag when i first load in, melee hits not registering etc... i hop worlds. So far i haven't disconnected from any sbq and experience less lag during the fight.
---
Also helps if you don't get too close to the queen and all the other players and explosions etc... the more going on in a confined space, the more lag/crashes occur. I find that if i get back a bit, where I'm more spaced out from everyone and all the mayhem, i experience less lag.
---
There are some "ifs" to that in the notes and it applies to Adventure too.  If the person attacking your camp is hostile to you for whatever reason, then the camps will take damage.  This can be exploited directly through the Workshop challenge.  If you take a workshop and you are challenged and become hostile, then your camp is vulnerable.  A bit of work for the lone griefer, but doable and I'm sure some will test the boundaries.  The specific rules for this haven't been published as far as I know, but it should be an improvement over what we have now
---
They need to totally over haul them. They haven‚Äôt done a thing to them except remove the ability to get exp from building. 
---
The pvp mechanics surrounding them are totally flawed. They need to change -something-, I‚Äôve read lots simple ideas could bring the focus back to Wanting the workshop instead of ganking people by surprise for caps while they are helpless to fight back. 
---
I think what you build should be persistent as well. I hope we get to that stage at some point.
---
Main story gets ya most of bluprints ya need to have a functional camp then work twards lvl 25 for power armor quest gives you the station as well as far as random cool stuff goes for camp most vendors have the prints for different walls and decorative stuff.
---
Thanks for your honest feedback. Yeah it's a preference thing and I just happen to like the smaller cluttered homey feel of it where every turn has multiple things to interact with and look at. It could simply be I'm just not good at making larger spaces look great.
---
Don't worry about the camp untill after level 5, or later.
---
Scrap weapons to learn mods and gain crafting material.
---
Follow the Overseer quest and Responder missions.
---
The Pipe Revolver can be modified so it benefits from both rifle and pistol perks, cheap to build and repair, valuable tool.
---
The game will unfold very well.  Enjoy!
---
I found two whole pumpkin pies so far out there in a wild..
---
yea i need that plan I have dense for everything else cept that
---
Then I guess I've been doing something wrong since I never died in pve, in my 250 hours of playing this game.
---
Yeah really. 
---
My damage output is already pretty damn high, I can already one shot pretty much any mob without having to sneak. Yeah if I would follow your advice my damage output will go up but only on sbq/sheepsquatch and so on. I'm not sure it's such a great idea to reinvent the wheen and completely change my build just for boss fights. It doesn't matter if I can do 900 or 1000 damage when the mob only has 500hp. I hope you get my point. 
---
To me it seems that everyone wants to defend their own character builds and everything else is not as good. I get it, I feel the same most of the time, especially when people question my vats pa build, but perhaps we can agree that all builds are viable if the user is having fun? I love my build, won't change it anytime soon. I can deal lots of damage, I'm sturdy enough to handle pretty much anything, and I'm having fun. I'm sure you feel the same about your build.
---
What platform are you on?
---
Follow the main story line, no need to rush into placing your camp until you've explored the map some.  Taking over work shops will get you some plans, but makes you vulnerable to PVP.  What system?
---
You need to find all the overseers tapes and complete the quest, the end boss is awesome.
---
r/market76
---
Thanks! Lol, I have already but this is well hidden. Although after the video tour is uploaded I feel like it's not going to be.
---
I literally saw 6 enemies total when I went in there. 2 gutsies earlier and those 4 which spawn in the last room
---
The biggest things I taught my friend were to set up your base with some food and water so that you have some for if you run out. And set up your base as if you never plan on playing with others, that way ull have everything you need and wont rely on friends bases for crafting benches. If you have friends that play, try to put your base in a location that is beneficial to cheaper fast travels, but also that u like.
---
Oh, I don't run it anywhere but nuke zones either. I prefer the excavator there because I can carry 210 pounds more. That's super helpful when acquiring legendaries and cleaning meat piles for nuke zone hygiene at Whitesprings. Also, it really does break less. And I don't get hit enough to need those other resistances in nuke zones. Gotta feel where those bullets are coming from.
---
Thank you! I dont claim to be the best, and others have made that clear haha but I was thinking of uploading some tips on YouTube and a video tour today so I will update the post with it later.
---
I ran into an alien at the bottom left corned of the map.
---
While I believe you that the house you linked was built in the 1950's, it's not what I would *think* of as a house built in the 1950's. Part of selling a setting based on the real world or historic time period is using things that are recognizable to the general public which is a limitation in some ways.
---
All good, thanks
---
If we had a quad exp, i hust might creat a 3rd character
---
l know, crazy
---
I started a new character, went from a sniper to hitting things with a sledgehammer.  The change on play styles keeps of fresh for me.
---
Yes please. Hey maybe nuclear winter will be like that, no level cap.
---
I wouldn't consider the grahm only plans rare, as you can simply find someone to hold him and server hop back over and over to get them all. Of his plans the disco ball and the domestic kitchen tables are probably the most uncommon.  As mentioned here combat dense and I think marine dense (don't quote me on that one) are pretty rare.  Assault rifle and marine lining plans seem to drop rarely from events.  BoS T-60 paint plans are recorded as being pretty rare in terms of their TD turn-in to drop rate (5-6%).  Tomahawk is on a lot of peoples list, but I'm not sure it's rare, as I've never done a leader of the pack event to see how infrequently it might drop.
---
Power armor part plans are fairly rare between distant thunder and treasure maps. These are the plans to craft the power armor limbs/torso/helmets.  
---
Finally ultracite power mods are VERY rare for some of them. They only drop from scorchbeasts, the queen and the marketplace/bazaar reddits.  The most sought after being servos, shocks and targetting HUD. 
---
there's well over 1000 plans now in game, for some of us it's the only thing left worth doing is trying to get them all.
---
If it is modded I would keep it. 10 weight for the Fram ain't bad. I have 2 sets on each of my characters
---
Very true. I, too, thought it was odd how little you see them randomly. And then to find one everytime at that lake, it just seems a little planned.
---
Just throwing out the help to whoever would like it.
---
sorry but im very skeptical about this, i mean what is even the point of posting this? 
---
Im convinced ill never get any good drops, ive been playing for over 5 months and have never gotten any explosive drops or sentinel armor etc etc
---
And now they remove one of my favorite ways to TRY to get a  good drop, and then you stroll in basically rubbing it in my face that you got good stuff
---
I am not pretty sure how to create the structure for the Challenge sections, but even so, I have some interesting ideas (at least for me haha).  
---
If you need some help I am a C programmer and java, I am also learning some PHP and if you are thinking of translating the website to other languages I can be helpful in Spanish.
---
Me personally, i don't mind repeating daily quests or events as i get to hang out with my friends. It doesn't seem like much of a grind when you can share the experience with others. Hell, sometimes we don't even talk about the game, regular conversation, smack talking, joking around etc... 
---
You can also help out the newer players now that you're experienced in the wasteland. Hook them up with weapons, supplies or simply assist in their quests.
---
Other than that, it's mostly grinding for that perfect gear/weapon while you wait for the next major content drop from Bethesda.
---
To me the excavator is a valuable 10 pounds especially with calibrated shocks.  You may find yourself needing that extra carry weight.
---
it could be, that would be than another PvP mode
---
Personally I collect power armor.  I can make goals for myself after so many
---
Thanks! Ps4
---
the only event that really gives end game loot is the SBQ fight which is really buggy and often crashes
---
Maybe in a few months I'll monetize a YouTube video and post this method for viral $$$, but spilling the beans for free on Reddit for this method to be patched will never happen. Down vote away.... It means nothing to me.
---
Nice,  thanks for the insight,  i'm getting to the point of trying to get them all,  but I wasn't sure what all even is at this point.   Disco ball?  Grahm is a big dancer,  is he?
---
Just 1000+?  Geeze...
---
Will do, thanks!
---
Do you have photo proof?
---
Seasons sounds horrible. I can understand it in a battle royale but this game is so grindy. I can't imagine losing all my best weapons and armor at the end of the season.
---
the ‚Äútoken‚Äù you found is probably just from the amusement park
---
Its a variant of the current 2x1 stairs + grated floor combo. You can switch to it but its locked, if you try to buy it it says error. 
---
Really hope they add it in soon and is available to anyone who bought/will buy the matching stairs that go with it. It really should be a set.
---
There‚Äôs a difference between an asshole and a raider. Seems this guy was just an asshole
---
Do the events in the Forest area to get plans, gear and chems
---
If u make ur own bullets keep it the harvest boost on ore is worth the 10 lbs.
---
Man, people really don't like your joke. I chuckled.
---
I view trading as a means to get the gear I want.   If the legendary vendor makes it so that everyone can do so, even better.
---
i had the same thing with the shocks server crashed before i could buy and to add insult to injury when i logged back in i had lost both of my T-60 Calibrated shocks legs
---
Shit sorry rancher hope it gets fixed for u soon
---
Hmm. 
---
I deleted them from the PS4 menu. $aybe need to figure out how to delete from the game menu.
---
I.M.O. keep the Excavator PA, I think it is easier to find mods for it and plus with the 100 pound carry weight addition to your base strength is a plus. The Excavator doesn't have all the rad and damage resistance as the other but that has to be watched anyway. If you do scrap a PA I.M.O. the Ultracite would be the one, but I would as least sell the individual components and you have an extra PA frame for a new build.
---
You alright buddy? You're being pretty toxic
---
For anyone interested, broken camera found here https://imgur.com/Y2EXH4f.jpg

Hah.
---
[](/celestiafrown)I feel your pain friend, I'd cure my Grounded mutation if there was a way to only cure it. Might have to break down and do it any way, I've gotten some really mint plasma weapons, and a sick flamer I still want to use.
---
Better but not great. I an AA ultracite laser rifle and it's pretty meh next to an AAE handmade. I tried it as a rifle and automatic and it broke after 2 magazines when auto. I have a couple legacy energy weapons I plan to try next including a suppressors ultracite explosive. We'll see if that's any better.
---
That solved it. Thanks!
---
I sent you a friend request to come see it in person
---
I have a screen shot of it yes. I will send it when I get home. Eta 4 hours
---
chances are that nuclear winter is going to be some sort of PvP mode, my guess would be deathmatch
---
Keep it around for the extra carry weight.... or don‚Äôt, you can always make a new set
---
Whitesprings is a joke for farming legendaries. Even nuked it drops pretty much only 1* garbage.
---
Not sure if different in pvp, but in adventure mode. When you die you get option for revenge or respawn. Respawn you choose location. Revenge just respawns you withing range of your enemy
---
Awesome!
---
The Troubleshooter set is strictly better, aside from the rad resist. Assuming that those are max-HP stats, the Vanguard set would reduce incoming ballistic damage by 36% and energy damage by 61% at most.
---
I was not aware of that. I‚Äôm going to try that out over at the lucky hole
---
If you say so ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
&gt;The issue here is that they're using a game engine that was never intended for online play ‚Ä¶
---
My reply is exactly related to this. I completely agree with what you said. All of it probably. 
---
My statement previous is based on assertions that contain words like "poor coding" and "shouldn't be an issue at all" 
---
Those have nothing to do with FO76 being on the platform it was built on ‚Ä¶ they are a platitude of personal desire and clueless insistence.
---
Whether FO76 should or should not have been built on the platform is not the metric ‚Ä¶ what the platform is capable of and observations based on that are.
---
Many users conceive of some random idea with no actual knowledge of the practicality and when they can't have it the run off their mouth about shit they do not understand with puffed up indigence. 
---
@Silentbtdeadly - again, I agree with you 100% ‚Ä¶ as FO76 finds a stride I am sure there will be improvements and, given how much fun I am already having, it is all something to look forward to. I just think BSG needs some credit given how much they have done with then engine. If it were mine at start I'd have said a player-centric scripted environment like FO/Skyrim converted to a MMO would have been a fools errand.
---
Took the words right out of my comment XDDD
---
In fallout 3 there is a terminal in vault tec HQ that has a list of orderable merchandise including lunchboxes and clothing, this terminal also has bobbleheads as one of those merchandise items. The terminal says that vault tec employees can order the bobbleheads with a deduction from their paychecks. Then also in fallout 3 theres a letter that calls the bobbleheads a toy.
---
AWOL armaments, guaranteed 3*, sometimes 2-3 before it's over. Even with server hopping, I still only see this once a night.
---
I think it'd be great if they'd do it once a month or even every couple months. Weekdays would also be nice...
---
If you have 33 luck then I'd assume you aren't using a level 3 critical savvy card?  I've been trying to do some testing myself, and with 22 luck (no unyielding for me sadly) plus critical savvy level 3, it's every third shot.  I think if I used critical savvy level 2 I would get the same result.  BUT when I use any gun with faster critical fill rate, it fires a critical every other shot instead of every third.  And with 21 luck it's still every third shot.  So there is a noticeable difference right there.  
---
Sounds like you, with 33 luck, could probably get away with every other shot even without any, or maybe level 1 only, critical savvy, if you have a critical fill gun.
---
In my experience it appears to only affect attribute penalties. For example, the 50% increase to hunger/thirst while moving with speed demon doesn't appear to change based on ancedotal observations.
---
If you have been playing it since launch and are level 120 you've got your money's worth
---
There is no option to seek revenge in survival. You're only SUPPOSED to be able to place a bounty or respawn at a Camp or train station exclusively, after death.
---
yeah i launched a nuke earlier on the SBQ but forgot to check whoelse was on the map turns out it was a bunch of level 20's and 30's that stood no chance against the SBQ and just 1 other 100+ Player, end result event failed and the queen flew away so no loot from her, this would balance the game a lot more
---
I went with Rifles as secondary to my heavy build. But once i got an explosive LMG, i went full Heavy Build with a TSE Gatling gun for my main and LMG for when when I need to dispatch stuff very very quickly, then a Weight Reduced Ski Sword that is basically less then a pound for weaker enemies or when i feel like hitting shit. Between my LMG and TSE Gatling I was able to get rid of my Rifle perks and pour them into Fire Proof and some other Perks. Plus the LMG is lighter then a fully modded Handmade which is strange. 
---
Perception stayed at 3 so i can swap out lock picking or butchers bounty for Tick Blood  or Green Thumb, Or the card that does more damage to glowing enemies making Nuked WS or HF much more easier to deal with using the Gatling.
---
Especially since diseases are aoe, have a wide range, and affect waaaay too often
---
Hey, thanks for all the time and effort you put into managing this. 
---
I'm sure it was mostly a thankless job.
---
I understand it given my blunt and direct reply came across like a jerk, but it is a real question. 
---
I asked if he can read because I constantly see the same post made with almost certainly the same outcome every time. 
---
The only reason any person should be flagged on PVE for PVP is claiming a Workshop, attacking a players base and destroying something, attacking another player outside Pacifist mode, and or being in a party that did so. A lot of people are unaware that when they claim a bench they fail to or don‚Äôt know how to read the prompt that informs them that they, and anyone in their party is then subjected to pvp if and when another player flags the bench.
---
I'm almost positive the vaccinated perk doesn't work at all with how often ghouls give me bone worms or rad worms.
---
Well from alot of speculatoin you get item x from your junk legendaries then use y of x to reroll your legendary that you want to be beter its still gonna be an rng crapshoot just mitigateable by farming any star legendarys.
---
Seems the horde events for the mire, ash heap, and toxic valley all put you right near the boss, but the other regions dont.  Cranberry bog is hit or miss, I've had it go either way
---
Collect treasure maps. Get naff weapons, but the plans can be good. Never bought anything of value from Grahm.
---
Too many people have treated me unkind on here, it's nice to hold the winning hand and know everyone else is just wearing their best poker face knowing they are losing. My husband found the method actually, but over the weekend we've found over 20 3* explosive weapons, 8 pieces of cavalier armor, and about 4 pieces of Assassins sentinel. Having a carrot to dangle over this toxic community of haters is just payback. We will release this method but it won't be for months, we are going to benefit the most before all the haters on Reddit do.
---
I got a level 10 quad explosive reduced weight hunting rifle a couple days ago.  I'm using it on my level 220 anyway, the damage isn't that much lower than a level 50 version
---
Also the token item you found can be turned in at mineing terminals.
---
Probably because they were non-hostile after completing the related quest. It was like shooting fish in a barrel. Yeah it was fun but legendary implies something is difficult to kill and has survived ages. Robots that lumber around letting you one-shot them aren't very legendary.
---
I think if you pot shot enough of the watoga bots though you can still force gutsy's to spawn and those can still be legendary because I'm pretty certain they aren't "watoga" bots. (someone correct me if I'm wrong)
---
Congrats! Go celebrate by taking a workshop and holding all of your junk!
---
I'll be around shortly...
---
Decent idea, but I don't know if it would help the core problem. Which is- lack of things to do after a certain point. 
---
You find yourself exploring the majority of the map through the main quests and the smaller POIs soon follow as you scour the wasteland for things to see and do. 
---
And then all of a sudden the once massive map seems incredibly small with nothing really to do but farm the following: Whitesprings mutants--&gt;West Tek--&gt;Burrows--&gt;Cranberry Bog-- over.and over. and over. and over again.
---
I'm afraid Bethesda really dropped the ball with respect to end game content. Which is surprising to me, because in 2019 one can plainly see how much time people devote to games these days, and with the aid of social media and the like, they zip through game content at a blistering pace. 
---
Even a new game mode using this same map might be a letdown for me. I've just seen all of it, and there is nothing new. 
---
I hope the vault raids alleviate this concern, but at this point I am beginning to look at other games, unfortunately.
---
you can claimthe workshop without powering up the power station up just need a fusion generator or a bunch of smaller generators, not a lot we can do about the assholes at the minute but they will get bored and move onto another game soon
---
That's missing the entire point. For this to be a successful MMO, keeping the existing base engaged, is just as important as bringing new players in. They need to find a way to ensure playerbase growth outpaces attrition.
---
I don‚Äôt think the food mutations do either anymore. I used to eat spoiled vegetables and fruits all the time without blinking as a vegetarian. But I‚Äôve been catching dysentery and parasites a good bit lately. 
---
That said, it‚Äôs hard to tell if that is a bug or a tune.
---
Not hard, literally impossible lol
---
When this vendor trading thing comes out, you can buy all of mine. I have about a dozen or so.
---
Forgot the /s my bad
---
Strange. I scrapped one after I saw people reporting this was gone and got no fuel in return.
---
I wish a PC modder would do a collection book mod. It seems feasible.
---
I could see them being a temporary item that makes you immuse to one desease at a time. But a permant bonus for 2.5k caps? I could make myself totally immune in a day. That would be way too powerful
---
Drills are actually quite good.
---
you can do that all day long...
---
thats a really good idea. it would give the crazy ass gear perk combos a challenge if the leveling is done right, and dropping good loot makes it worthwhile. i really like this lol
---
do share locations if you remember!
---
Yeah I used the weekend to punch my way up from 91. After 100 though theres no more point to worrying about your level. Which is nice af
---
Yes, they certainly are petulant.
---
I think the same too. I'm on Xbox and remember wanting this in Fallout 4. I thought my wish was answered when a mod came for it, only to find it was buggy and pretty much useless.
---
That is an excellent point, but I sure hope that we get some info on it.
---
yeah im thinking like borderlands
---
Yes cuz after 100 levels and 52 on my alt, I know for sure that holding lots of junk makes workshop takeovers go faster.
---
For the encrypted event some people just chill out of bounds so they can get the legendary and let people do the work for them its a terrible tactic and no one wins if the thing doesnt die
---
I agree, it was good fun hopping all over, especially with chat (pc) there to help.
---
I've leveled a few characters on xb1, so starting over on PC had me feeling burnt out. This past weekend I probably had more fun than the past few months combined; got to enjoy a bit of cattle ranching, and even the utter chaos of the cryptid event! (Hitting 45 and getting my watoga run out of the way wasn't bad either!)
---
I thought so to, but don't those have a different name?
---
i totally agree and cant fathom why so many people seem to hate on this idea of nighttime being nighttime
---
Ive made this same post a few times before, but each time so many people seem to WANT nights that are as bright as overcast days
---
it makes no sense!
---
i want realism and immersion, and dynamic appropriate lighting really helps
---
I‚Äôm a level 163 with full unyielding sentinel heavy BOS combat and all the requisite perks to include: Barbarian, blocker, dodgy, serendipity, evasive, and ironclad.
---
This didn‚Äôt happen lol
---
Could be they run a group with a hidden empath/fast travel point alt tagged along.  Gives them a quick access and reduced damage.
---
Interesting, well if that's the case. I'm leaning towards bug/exploit maybe? 
---
Only other thing that comes to mind.... does survival allow fast travel to teammates? If so, if they don't die at exact same time. I can see them quickly choosing to respawn on teammate right before they die, and continuously repeat the cycle.
---
I can‚Äôt re-prove it but I have some older videos I recorded in november I can show you to prove you they absolutely work past 15. Well...some anyway.
---
Strength - Increases carryweight and melee attack damage forever.
---
Perception - Literally always max hit chance to any limb in VATS when extremely high.
---
Endurance - If endurance is made extremely high, it will literally refill AP instead of draining. This is because ‚ÄúIt affects your action point drain from sprinting‚Äù. Eventually it reaches negative numbers and starts giving rather than taking AP from sprinting. Total health has a rather low cap however.
---
Charisma - Everything related has a cap. No further benefits.
---
Intelligence - Increases XP gain. Recently they added a max cap for how much xp can be gained per action, but back in the day you could earn any amount of xp for any action. (Example, 20.000 for a radroach)
---
Agility - Will keep raising action points in VATS forever.
---
Luck - Only thing I noticed from luck was the perfectly preserved pie machines successfully grabbed pies every single time.
---
And I think I'm hearing about the 2xp weekend a tad late it seems. Shucks.
---
A few patches ago all of my Power Armor sets got a nerf of 60 dmg 60 energy and 60 radiation resistance. 
---
I have 11 sets of power armor. I wrote down the statistics of all my sets at both 100% and 200% condition. Two of my sets are well below 100% on all pieces and even they have the same 60 point nerf. 
---
I believe your theory of the Power Armor Chassis no longer counting towards the Power Armor statistics is absolutely correct.
---
Ahhh... Thanks for explaining that to me.
---
Would be a nice boost for the 6 month anniversary
---
about tree fiddy
---
at the minute the highest level enimies outside of nuke zones are level 80 scorchbeasts all other enemies are capped at level 60, if you look for a gothic looking building between cranberry bog and savage divide (west of watoga) that is fort defiance, the enemies are around level 40 i think
---
It's not actually VATS specific. Twisted Muscles increases the cone of fire angle by 50%, both for aimed and hipfire shooting. For reference, two-shot increases the same value by 150%. Class Freak probably doesn't work on Twisted Muscles either.
---
Welcome to West-Tek.
---
So you believe that nothing is going to change then outside of the game?
---
I usually just start the events solo, and if someone shows up, I'll still finish it, regardless of their participation.
---
just be sure to place lots of rocket turrets on the base, people really enjoy those at whitesprings
---
That would go agaisnt the design philosophy of this game i'm afraid. They want you to repeat things over and over again.
---
Like fixing the power plants, you would think it would be a one time thing but nah they expect you to fix the plants every time you log on.
---
They probably removed them because they were the laziest, easiest and lowest risk high level legendary farm in the game. Do the mayor quest and then just waltz through the streets without having to touch a thing but the legendary spawns.
---
As in, enjoy destroying them or enjoy watching them explode everything?
---
Agree. Also, I found a 'clean miners lamp' for the first time recently. And for some reason, although when examined it shows a light - it completely disappears when worn. More helmet light strangeness from Fallout.
---
this is a cry for help!
---
yeah it's one of the game big problems there is no challenge anymore and it's only been a few months, even if we had some proper story quests to get into that would be something
---
Thanks)
---
Thank you)
---
It seems like a lot more players were online which in survival was a lot of fun.  I‚Äôve been in there before playing 30-40 minutes and not seeing or encountering one other player.  Lots of action this weekend.
---
Me too. But there are times (lots of the actually) where someone else finds something I want. That's why I personally enjoy the trading aspect so much. I take you don't trade?
---
It was a typo. He's right there is some sort of hidden rad shielding built into PA.
---
Even if you stacked 500 rad resist with reg armor which may be possible with all legendary and rad-x, you will still melt in seconds.
---
Hazmat suits all but eliminate rad damage but are impractical unless you are a fan of being one shot Ted.
---
I know. Especially with how they were describing their build.
---
There is nothing really interesting after level 50. Bethesda didn't bothered to create any end game content at all. They thought it is enough if people just buy the game and level up character to 50 level. 
---
After next autumn when small DLC is released there won't be much updates anymore.  Next year there will be probably one server per continent left, because no need for more. We already see how poorly Bethesda is fixing glitches and bugs that were identified during Beta and they are mostly still in game. They aren't even interested anymore to fix numerous of known bugs and glitches. They just cherry pick some individual bugs time to time and make big promises, which never come true.
---
Only reason why some triple digits are still playing are probably, because they are unemployed, need escapism for some reason or have no social life at all. In this game it is really easy to evolve to the top, because there is no challenge at all from other players so this game is probably only game where they can be on top.
---
How so? Maybe I‚Äôm missing something, but I don‚Äôt see not having diseases all that huge of an advantage.
---
You‚Äôd have to spend 50k caps to cure all of them. Even if you could collect that many caps in a day, it‚Äôs only mitigating issues you could have fixed with less caps through buying fresh food, antibiotics and disease cures.
---
Try west tek runs . Still pretty easy but definitely not as mind numbing as whitesprings
---
Excavator is worth keeping for the increase in harvesting when farming ammo mats.
---
It's the only reason I have a set.
---
it's seems odd that they didn't, i don't remember seeing anyone on here asking for a PvP survival mode but everyone wants a challenge
---
Whitesprings and The Burrows are the best place for farming Legendaries and RifleGaming's video on it actually proves The Burrows are better for Legendaries.
---
Great info, thanks, will update the thread later.
---
Equip the new Prosnap Camera, look through and use it to find the bodies of enemies and players. It will show the text in the corner of the dead mobs. I found the imposter sheepsquach and enemy corpses underwater doing this yesterday.
---
I will keep saving junk 3 stars until then.
---
Awesome pic
---
I found one...sucks you can only place 1...and, ya can't get meat off her... but still cool I guess
---
wow sounds like you and your husband are kind of toxic to harbor so much hate for people you dont know....just because some people are toxic doesnt mean you have to turn into them
---
anyway, good people do what good people do, not everyone is toxic
---
if you could see my base near overseeers camp i made to help new players for the last 5 months, you'd understand
---
of yes we can't live without those repair kits
---
What was that the pumpkin house I'm not too sure where the other one was a bit too far away
---
There is nothing to do in adventure mode for high level players, they moved to survival.
---
I tried server hopping for a while at the water park and had no luck.   Then I decided to try all the possible locations within a single sever thinking that that *must* work.   Got lucky at the Teapot where some others had some luck.   Give it a shot.
---
Too many people put camps trying to farm the enemies, don't be one of them.
---
Whats more important - ER/DR/RR, or carry weight?
---
Ult adn Ex have about the same RR.
---
I believe you can add calibrated shocks to both legs of the Ultracite PA for the 100 carry weight bonus.
---
But you will lose the extra ore provided by excavator. 
---
OTOH, If you add the calibrated shocks to excavator, then you get te base 100 + another 100 for a total of 200 carry bonus.
---
IDK about the durability -  I've been in 45 Excavator for &gt; 20 levels, and have only needed to repair it once.
---
i rarely see it that often
---
Supply vs demand basics until there is an ingame auction house i dont believe the need/want for specific legendary loadouts will change so the sales and tradeing will continue it just may slow down for a bit if the reroll rate is reasonable enough for people to try the rerole vs farming them out becasue we all know how bad the farming rate is.
---
I play because I just enjoy the game.  I'm level 142 and I love running around farming enemies and resources to add to my camp.  I love running around discovering new places or running around with my teammates, doing different events.  This game keeps me engaged, lets me block out everything else, and keeps me entertained.
---
The only challenge I‚Äôve had recently was a spawn and respawn of high level colonel gutsys at Watoga HS.  I had about 7-8 jump me right away and then another half dozen came after me.  That being said, I still took them down but blew through a fair amount of shotgun ammo.
---
Indeed. I have a character created for just that purpose alone.
---
Yep. Players want to make demands and they think it's all so easy, when in my mind it's already a miracle they've pulled off what they have, as well as they have.
---
And as much hate as this game got early on, Anthem is a great example that games *intended to be online only* can perform worse than this game ever did.. and yes, when Bethesda truly hits it's stride, I imagine they'll have something truly unique.
---
I kind of look at it like ff14, a game that took a long time to really become something unique.. I didn't give it a chance until after a realm reborn. 
---
These little things people want, I think some of it will likely happen over time. Like we can build containers in our camp, but right now we can't put anything in them.. it's a pretty safe clue that will likely become something in the future.
---
For now I'm happy there's new content and less crashes, overall more improvements.. hell, they got me playing for the first time since February!
---
 Great sugestion, im tired of stay 2 seconds close to a ghoul and catch a disease, then need to run to whitespring sulphur fountain to heal.
---
I don't regret getting the game,I mainly just needed to vent a bit.
---
With all the sketchy trading bugs in the beginning I've never been one for trading. If I don't want something you get a bag at ur feet lol
---
I do. West tek, AWOL, Watoga buildings, anything that lets me move around.
---
I've heard rumors there's still a way in the game. Just whispers tho
---
we need lots of new content not the drip feed we have been getting
---
No problem.  We all want to know when the bugs will be fixed.
---
I have a closed bunker right in fissure prime on top of the Junk Deposit, until they patched the fireplace glitch, I used to open up the door with full access inside, but unfortunately I no longer can do that .. I suppose I could supplement down the road with some work benches and an area for people to use. Gets trashed often by the scorch beast, so workbenches and pieces generally don't last long. On XB1.
---
Xbox 1
---
Account wide caps pool would be great.
---
this or something like this would be great but as long as we get something to do because right now i'm bored with what little there is
---
yes
---
See I love that same thing the open world run around do nothing but kill or scavenge or tr√§dƒô for hours at a time
---
I wish I had guns for that stuff. I always need at least one other person.
---
Honestly the game was a real struggle for me up until about lvl 30.  Once I got past lvl 75 or so I felt comfortable competing in most areas and events.  Now as lvl 180+ it‚Äôs difficult to do anything in Adventure and stay challenged.  I usually find myself heading to Survival if I want a legit challenge.
---
I just traded for that plan last week. Person I got it from says it's extremely rare, but does still spawn.
---
I killed a lvl 50 sheepsquatch at lvl 54! ;) after two failures I finally killed him üòÇ
---
Oh I have no issues with anyone trying different builds - I'm finally working on another VATS build, but I'll just skip using it with PA.  As you say, you can already do enough damage, why bother with a tin can suit?  The PA is only really useful/relevant for boss fights and that's exactly when you want that sustained damage and higher damage is preferable to take down the SBQ/imposter SSQ faster or you're just hosing ammo out the wazoo.
---
I just don't see the need for PA aside from boss fights or nuke zones, and VATS is not really that useful or necessary in those 2 situations.  I used to be a tin can bound PA only player myself - there's a lot beyond that suit of PA if you're willing to step out.
---
He doesn‚Äôt keep it there 24/7 only when we fight the queen so like once every few weeks he will spend 40 to move it to the outside of he blast zone
---
No they are just called token
---
Have none of you people ever played an online game before this? This isn't news worthy.
---
I'm assuming it will be ‚≠ê tokens.
---
Trade him a ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê you get a ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê token. Same for ‚≠ê‚≠ê and ‚≠ê
---
You can use the respective tokens on gear with that many stars for a single reroll.
---
They will NOT let you reroll a specific attribute, that would make it too easy. So if you got a rifle with Insect slaying, VATS crit and VATS chance you can't just reroll the insect slaying in hopes of bloodied, you will need to reroll all 3 stats at the same time.
---
3rd character, probably hiding nearby that they respawn on.
---
Power Armor doesn't protect you from catching rad worms the first time a diseased ghoul swings his arm near you. Yeah, it should, but I've had them for so much of my in-game time that the worms are only about 5 levels lower than my character.
---
I leveled from 200 to 206, and solo killed, with a Bloodied Deathclaw Gauntlet, 3 Squach on a single Free Range event. Failed event, but gained a level from it, LVL 206!   Hooray 2X XP
---
I saw someone get one shotted in the middle of the Enclave a couple of days ago who had just joined by server to trade with me. She hadn't taken any action against the other player. 
---
For all the certainty that people offer, there seem to be exceptions. 
---
This friend swears that he was seeing his caps decline as he was attacked. As unlikely as it seemed, I thought i'd see if anyone else had experienced the same thing.
---
I am not going to be farming the ghouls at the golf club anyway, and plus any enemies killed by turrets dont drop loot nor give XP. My camp is south of whitesprings in the centre of the golf range
---
Ever wondered what it‚Äôs like having your INT several thousand high? 
---
This was in november and is no longer possible, but it sure shows a difference x)
---
https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=dFQNd_ICRis
---
This. I run a 2nd account with an empath character that has 15 charisma so I can get extra perks.
---
I have yes, but regardless it doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs OK. Like, what‚Äôs the limit? If every online game is like this and people roll around being assholes is that cool because it‚Äôs common?
---
r/inclusiveor
---
Because you are removing a game mechanic, with no drawback. Paying caps is a no brainier for this. Plus it could prevent people from completing challenges
---
&gt;why bother with a tin can suit?
---
I actually like power armor and getting a good set of regular armor is way harder than using PA. 
---
I might give regular armor a try when the legendary vendor shows up. Not really a priority tho. I'm a bit intrigued because i've heard that the legendary powered effect is better than ap legs+core assembly.
---
Right, mine isn't there 24/7 as it is on on an alt character, in hindsight I wish I had built it further out of the blast zone and a bit further away from the scorch beasts who trash it repeatedly. Unfortunately it is a bunker which can't be moved, so it is there to stay until Bethesda break it. But it's a good idea to at least put a weapons workbench maybe on top in a room on the ground floor. I probably won't build more than 1 bench and a stash box which is probably the most important two, but that's a good idea. I do see people running around the bunker trying to get in or just curious about this looming structure in FP. It's fully enclosed which is cool, so if I am in survival I can't be touched which is rare as it provides me with somewhat of a safe haven. I will see how much budget I have left to build something useful stuff for players. What do you think are the absolute minimal essentials for FP ?
---
All sorts of things you can do while you are waiting for the Nuclear winter update....
---
Try these, for starters:
---
Locate and clear every location.
---
If you have unfinished quests, finish them.
---
Check the (platform) trophies list.  Try to 100% the list.
---
What challenges?
---
I use a 1* vamp auto handmade I found, for the imposter squatch event. It works well with all the bots around and spamming stimpacks.
---
Free range you can draw aggro from real squatch and run around until it dies. Just make sure to kill the bugs that spawn first. It can get hairy keeping all the cows alive when 2 spawn, but I still haven't failed an event solo.
---
I have multiple posts saying the same thing: legendary nerfs and their ludicrous RNG will kill this game. Not everyone should get a god roll every drop, but limiting your chance through the constant nerfing of the drop rate is sucking the life out of the game for me. I would rather have the excitement of killing a legendary and hoping for my quad bloodied explosive two shot crossbow, than hours of seeing one or two legendary enemies. I will wade through thousands of nocturnal tire irons for that one diamond. I can only check vendors so many times.
---
I found it!
---

---
You can respawn on teammates that‚Äôs probably how they‚Äôre doing it
---
Its better all around. Less issues and bugs. The new additions are all super fun. And the addition of survival mode made adventure mode a safer place. And survival is much more pvp.
---
This. Or a week long event. Few builds I'd like to try but I can't get over the "ugh all that same shit again" hump
---
I also found a union uniform lol
---
Honestly, I tried survival for about 10 minutes and it just seemed like a PvP fest.. at least near the random train station I loaded in at. But it was the one near white spring, so maybe I just was in a bad spot to give it a try?
---
What's actually different, besides no fast travel, respawn at the vault, etc? I really haven't looked to see what all was added in recent patches, so that's what I'm trying to figure out now..
---
I think they made bloodied, stealth and VATS crits too strong, and as a consequence they had to nerf the base damage of ranged weapons in a dumb attempt to balance it out.
---
If you're running a rifle build then you need to abuse at least one of those things, or your damage output will be miserable. Stealth and VATS are a bit of a pain in PA, although bloodied is easy.
---
Hope they also change the amount of fuel you find in the world, finding 5 fuel is a joke.
---
Thanks for the info. I imagine they will all have some sort of mini quest where you kill one and get it.   Do you data mine or did you just find this info somewhere else
---
That wouldn't explain why they respawn at MY camp, they shouldn't be able to do that. It needs to be fixed.
---
I know I spent 2h hopping Charleston Herald last night to try &amp; get the Pump Action plans.
---
As far as I'm currently concerned, that bastard is rare. I saw tons of plans spawn at that location but never got a Pump Action &amp; gave up.
---
If you find your mic, feel free to add me, same as username but with a - at the end
---
Why the toxic attitude? and what does this issue have to do with Trading.
---
Seriously I have no need to prove anything, and I don't believe for a moment this issue has anything to do with the introduction of repair kits, if that were the case then everyone would be experiencing the same thing. I have been told that data miners discovered a bug that is causing this for people with a certain mutation (can't remember which one).
---
I have not experienced unequipped armor degrading, but I used to repair my armor about every 4-5 hours of gameplay, and I am currently needing to repair it after every battle, and pieces are getting broken very often, which previously never happened.
---
In other news this basically confirms Bethesda has some kind of Zetan content in the pipeline.
---
My camp should NOT act as a fast travel spawn point for enemy players...
---
Tesla rifles stagger in pvp too ?? Or just the laser ones
---
Maybe they should make something like players photo album? Best shots submited would be on fo76 general photo album
---
Oh I built a fusion generator + heavy turrets + missile turrets. But.....I have yet to have that setup tested aginst the kind of people that kills X-01 in 0.5s
---
What bout the sheepsquatch imposter
---
Wow, love it! Everything looks meant to be there. If I stumbled upon this, I would assume that the fo76 design team made it as a part of the world (meant as a compliment for sure!).
---
Never saw that before. I thought the inventory was reset for everyone individually, like the caps total.
---
Oh how about rent a build
---
Yeah I feel you but if someone finds a way to harrass then his/her indestructible base of perfect placement if it griefs even one player would be indestructible and would step up an awesome/ bottleneck that someone could capitalize on that would be permanent. Noone would go for workshops if other players set up to easily attack defenders. 
---
I feel your pain but invulnerable cramps wouldn't be good because invulnerable ANYTHING player controlled would reward the first to log on
---
Is my location in my other comment wrong? Turned out the broken camera I picked up there is just under junk..
---
There are only 2 guns using 10mm ammo: the 10mm pistol and the SMG you have.
---
Look for a legendary - anti armor, bloodied, furious, two shot, vampire are very good. Then for 2nd star, explosive or faster fire rate are great ones.
---
Use agility perks for automatic or regular pistols (depending on your receiver). Put a suppressor, try sneaking for that sneak bonus. Unfortunately, damage to pistols and sneak are both in agility, so you're limited.
---
When you hit level 50, do the park quest to get a lvl50 Perfect Storm. It's a great weapon to use until you get one of the above legendaries.
---
I've probably seen your base once, just wanna say thank you
---
Yeah this has bothered me for a while..
---
Save up your caps and buy them off here. 191 levels and I've never picked one up off a drop.
---
Nope. You can buy whatever another player sold, and there are some whoppers in there. Best to date:  Two Shot/Faster Fire/Reduced Weight Cryolator and an Explosive Bloodied Western.
---
Fusion cores are so easy to come by for most PA users.  I have never Workshop farmed them and I have been in a PA frame since level 10 and started using Raider Armor at 15 and worked my way up.  I think the lowest I ever got was 5 cores.  As long as you don't use a laser gatling for a main weapon, you will be fine.  You can also fabricate your own cores from pure flux later on.  I make most of mine at 111% .
---
Yes you‚Äôre right. I quit playing about one month after the tse nerf and Am currently attempting to get back in to it. I really enjoyed overpowered tse guns and when legendaries and ghouls were plentiful at white springs. Now I just get bored exploring trying to level up. And to top it all off they basically made legendary hunting not worth it. That is all I do
---
With chameleon the projection is the only display mode you can use :x The standard one is horrible if you are stealthed and invisible because your pip boy also gets the effect which means you dont see anything
---
For another point of view, try the Plague Walker mutation.  Let all those diseases get straight to work damaging your enemies, while you and enjoy eating spoiled food and drinking pondwater.  If they had vaccines, I'd probably get them - but until that time, just embrace your infected self.
---
I get a lot of wood ... foot tap, tap, tap ... Not!
---
I get a lot of wood armor.
---
The spawns and the left overs from the TSE duping means I am done with survival for now, I'm afraid.
---
I used a TS 10mm pistol for all the weaker stuff so I dont have to use any of my good ammo on them it works really well.
---
I play about 95% solo.
---
IMHO, camps are more fun than anything else - Yes they have utility, but keep it small in the begining - (cheaper to move if needed), for starters.
---
Adhesive farm and all that, or set on over a resource, but at lower levels, maybe not a priority as much as hunter/gatherer.
---
Personally, I think I've been to my camp maybe 3 times in the last month.  I've found what I needed in exploring the map.
---
beyond that...follow rthe overseers questline.  
---
Hang out in the forest until L15 or so.   To discover, avoid fast travel. At 15-20, head to toxic valley.   Stay there until 25.  Do the Western side of the divide.  Some locations on the western divide will increase enemy level if a higher level player has been around. Come back later.
---
L30ish, head to the ash heap.  45+, up Easern divide, the mire, Watoga.
---
With a good weapon and some PA, you can start farming whitesprings about L27
---
Same here, and plus you can easily farm 20 power cores in 30mins if you know where to farm them but most of them are at 25+ power but comes with extra loot and can be done nonstop throughout the day.
---
The submachine is pretty good. That damage at that fire rate equals out to 309 damage per second. To out that in perspective, the base automatic handmade has around 337 DPS.
---
Are you asking about good legendaries for 10mm guns? Anti armor covers pistols lack of armor piercing perks. The submachine gun gains armor piercing from rifle perks, I think. -25% vats costs on an automatic 10mm pistol or submachine gun should give you more AP than you can use before needing to reload.
---
The fire rate on a submachine gun suggests furious would be the best for it. It fires 9.1 rounds per second. You would be at the 50% damage bonus cap in just over 1 second. Then the other 10 bullets in your clip would be on par with TSE damage.
---
That is just not true, at least I'm still getting legendaries to spawn inside the EMS. Maybe not as often as before, but sometimes even three supermutants do spawn as legendaries.
---
There is an acid pit just a stone throw south west of the golf club workshop that also itself has 3 acid pits.
---
Leveled an alt from 30 to 40. Did kill one legendary Sheepsquatch from the free range event.
---
Some rare plans like bos in a warehouse by grafton steel. Someone posted another location too. Treasure maps. Watoga vendor in the city has a couple non static that show up too. Run down the train tracks from watoga station and there's some plans that spawn in that train car too.
---
This thoery sounds the most plausible. We'll all still need to pray to RNGesus
---
We still use emojis, even with teammates and others in our PSN party who all have mics. üôÇ
---
I recently switched to projection mode because it saves time and there's less lag when opening or closing it, I kept doing stuff I didn't want with the regular mode üòë
---
Would love to tell you, but I don't know you enough to trust you not to tell anyone else. We don't harbor any hate for anyone, but it is nice to tease a bit. We understand not everyone on here is a hater persay, but true hating would entail us to never release our findings and string everyone along for our amusement. Seems you are having troubles finding good gear and I can empathize with that because I was in the same boat. Keep your head up and fingers crossed for now for those good drops, wish I could tell you about the method, but good things come to those who patiently wait.
---
But Fallout 76 is online and you can't just change the time
---
Do you need a calibrated shock mid for each leg
---
Wait there was a double xp weekend
---
I loved the old Whitespring where every new player caused a spawn and legendary enemies were plentiful. Now if you aren‚Äôt the first one there, everyone is dead and you have to hope you can hit the next respawn in 20 minutes. Infuriating.
---
I don't think i've seen a legendary Scorched aside from the Horde mission.
---
Beam splitter makes it fire 5 shots with literally pinpoint accuracy (there is no "spread" probably a bug) it also does full damage each beam.
---
So with a bloodied explosive laser rifle, you end up with a 30 clip weapon that does nearly 1000 damage per shot (~230 x 5 with AdrenalReaction at &lt;20%), high accuracy, long range and very low recoil.
---
This legacy weapon is stupid powerful, even on PvE. It's only downside is Beam Splitter degrades durability at 5x speed. Still, I can probably get four clips (120 shots) from 200% durability w/ gunsmith 5. Would probably break in one clip without those.
---
Yes, one for each leg.  50 pounds carry weight for each.
---
I don't agree with it, but from their point of view, it's not a terrible tactic at all, as they do no work and lose no materials (like Stims or Ammo). Either they get loot or don't, but at no cost to them. It's stupid, and it's a colossal waste of time usually, but people are like that some times.
---
  Depends on your POV.
---
I've not done the start up a powerplant, so the caps I paid Grahan for the fusion generator plan was a good value for me :)
---
Ahh, it's like playing ranked in Overwatch all over again...
---
ok, good thing is you can simply post pictures of your inventory with all this loot you got...right? 
---
20 3* explosives weapons, 8 pieces of cavalier armor, and about 4 pieces of Assassins sentinel...
---
or... you could just admit you are either making it all up or a  duper
---
I just want a helmet light slot so I don't have to wear my mining helmet to get better illumination.
---
Which ones? I have the one that increases hit chance and damage maxed out
---
You can sometimes find the helmet in Morgantown, on the table in the large tent in that area on the main road with loads of tents, just down from the high school. It can also be found elsewhere, but this is the location I find it most often.
---
I'm pretty sure I can craft them, so there must  e plans, although I cannot for the life of me recall when or how I got them.
---
Same.  Level 197 and I have never found a TSE.  I have found exactly one explosive pump shotgun in all this time.  They need a reddit support group for people with no FO76 luck.
---
You're having much better luck than I am then, I haven't found any in about 12 visits now, so I quit going to Watoga, and my Camp is only 4 caps away.
---
Don't forget the lack of stimpack animation...
---
You learn crafting through scrapping. Check Grafton Bot Greg on a file cabinet
---
And Calibrated Shocks and the torso STR enhancer...if you're gonna, go whole hog...
---
That would be cool
---
Oooh~ I'll have to have a looksee at the area then.
---
You must be a dad
---
Got a 3\* Furious Combat Rifle and a 1\* Two Shot Combat Rifle, and Executioner's Explosive, 15% faster reload LMG, and tons of other pretty decent but useless weapons like, Vampire SMG, a few 2\* Fat Mans from one server. 
---
other times Legendaries are just everywhere, had 3 of them in the small strip by the Harpers ferry vendor once. Nothing good but I've never seen such a concentration.
---
Adjusting the POV setting up to 90 or 100 can help too
---
yes the original is visually nice and all but the "quickboy" is well much quicker and I can still see my surroundings
---
Yes sir.
---
As far as I know there is no plan for, but I could be wrong. For location, would need to check forget off the top of my head but I would think any spawn locations for hats of any type have a chance to have it. Then if that takes to long maybe any military location I think that were I have found all my helmets
---
&gt;This doesn't make any sense to me. You seem to say regular armor can exceed PA radiation resistance, then turn right around and say it doesn't.
---
That's because the game doens't make sense, and you seem to have completely ignored the magic effect I just told you about. Only mistake I made was calling it "radiation immunity", as it's not pure 100% immunity. It's just pretty close.
---
Armor pieces can exceed DISPLAYED radiation resistances of weaker PA. 
---
But because the unlisted magical near-immunity effect, any weaker PA, is superior to best radiation resitance armor. Using a lot of rad-x you can pump your radiation resitanse up to 2k. Or even 20k. It doesn't matter because the main thing that matter is the unlisted effect PA and maz mat suit has.
---
If you go only by the displayed numbers, you can conclude correctly that certain PA have much better radiation resistanse than some other PA. But the actual differences are very small.
---
Nope I'm a data miner.
---
It's a bit irradiated but there is a spawn point for a lower level Grafton Monster very close that will pop up just about every time you travel back.
---
I think if you want to do a PA build then you need to go with heavy weapons.  You can take advantage of the stabilized perk that ignores 45 percent of targets armor.    Gatling gun with bloody mess, stabilized and one gun army perk is good for just everyday use even with no legendary effects.
---
In addition to Daedraels list, theres also an executioners 10mm smg.
---
When did you last see the sun?
---
That makes sense, and I'm 100% the kind of person to use what I think looks better even if it means I use twice the stimpacks. Especially if I spent Atoms to look better. If I don't use it, I wasted Atoms. If I do use it, I'm wasting stimpacks. I can make stimpacks at the chem table.
---
It started on Thursday. That‚Äôs how I managed to get some time in.
---
Will do. Do you know if i can craft bloodied combat helmet if i buy the "bloodied combat armor" skin from atom shop?
---
let me guess, die a few times by a 3\* legendary then kill it. Since you are playing with someone they can sit by as you respawn on them
---
I met a 1* lvl 50 once when I was 31 in cranberry bog. Pulled it to a close by BOS location with two rocket turrets. Took them a while, but they killed it :)
---
You shouldn't go around spreading Targeting HUDs. I have seen no confirmation yet that the related bug has been fixed yet. It crashed clients left, right, and center. Look it up.
---
At least you got a shotgun lol. I've only got a explosive supressor western revolver.
---
Are you on PS4?
---
Benches. (Multiple of each) food sources and stashes.  And mortars because when you enter an event area the mortar is usable for everyone in the area so you can rain hell on the queen when she lands
---
Beautiful!
---
it's not like we don't find gas cans littered absolutely everywhere or anything.... /s
---
Interested in helping me out I've been looking for somebody who does data mining is willing to look at the updates as soon as they come in and help me out with some of the info as I don't data-mine.  if you can consistently give me good info obviously I'll hook you up with payment or something we can figure it out.
---
I've got another guy who does it right now but he's a little slow they wouldn't mind having a couple of people being able to do it to help me out
---
Thanks a lot!
---
Add me on discord and we can talk about it more. Eckserah#0001
---
Not at the moment, but being a dad and a good one is my main goal in life.
---
I am a rifle build and while I love rifles, they just can't compete with a melee builds.
---
Weird, I‚Äôm LVL 56 and it spawned LVL 32-LVL
---
That's pretty awesome! I may have to do that Quest
---
Big fan of this. I went to do an event last night (got back into the game after a while) and there was a lvl 215 there. He was first so I got wiped by lvl 50+ bots while I'm lvl 15. Neither of us should've had to deal with that. He should get harder events and should be in a completely different ecosystem
---
I just got a 3star TS 10mm SMG. Doing a perception heavy build with commando and tank killer, with reduced recoil barrel+receiver+stock. This thing SHREDS. I‚Äôm talking like 3 clips is enough to kill a Mirelurk Queen from full. This thing is going to be my tried and true until I can get my hands on a TSE
---
Learn how to do the event without help. Ignore the idiots that blast past for no reason and focus on yourself and your rewards. 
---
For imposter sheepsquatch, cola nut and nuka cherry negate the pylon damage. I use a quad explosive double barrel and about 10-15 nuka cherry per fight and have solo'd her many times.
---
Sorry but I have no idea if atom shop armour skins work on helmets. The helmets can be modified with things like reinforced, so if they can be modded with that then perhaps the skins work too. But I have no idea, I haven't got any of the armour skins myself.
---
Curious if it's the same guy I ran into at Whitesprings yesterday.  I saw him near Charleston after I got away from him.  He was wearing raider PA level 47 I think and followed me into one of the rooms in Whitespring and shut the door and stood in front of it blocking me from leaving.  After I managed to get by he followed me for about 10 minutes blowing up every car to try and kill me. I gave every emote possible that I wasn't interested but he was relentless.  I can't complain because I have a had a great expierience so far but this guy was super effing annoying.
---
Yeah collect caps if you're not into getting serum recipes and the rest. Biv isn't too bad to get it all, stick it into your daily cap cashout. Camden is crazy, almost there myself but 3 tokens a day, 450 to get the suit.
---
Sun? can't remember it's some new content?
---
Also the mirror ball is rare from graham, it doesn‚Äôt appear in his inventory every time afaik.
---
Yeah part of the new dlc dude it‚Äôs so cool!
---
I only have a tiny bit of budget left and might be able to squeeze a bench or 2. Ideally I agree, but I also don't want to have to repair benches nobody uses but want something absolutely essential hence a weapons workbench and stash, maybe a chemos bench. A mortar might be a good idea. Thx
---
On one character?
---
LOL - I was referring more to it mitigating the rad add (which I could be wrong on), but yeah I‚Äôm right there with you. Maybe should set up a play date for our parasites some time haha
---
I've not seen one until the went to the lake where they are a guaranteed spawn
---
Had a guy with a Death Claw Gauntlet try to fight me a while back but i walked away only to find a CAMP down the road. I was about to walk by, when i stopped and looked at it and sure enough it was his. I walked up to it planning to stash my junk and pull out a fat man. Once he realized i was heading he logged off immediately.
---
We are aware there is an issue with the Alien challenge registering with the Flatwoods Monster and plan on addressing this with a future update. 
---
&gt; Another thing that's happening is when we're taking photos with the camera of whatever item on the list, it doesn't always tag it to complete the challenge (even when you make sure that the camera is saying what the thing is in the recognition feature). This makes it difficult when we're tracking down the rare things, such as the Mothman, Flatwoods Monster, legendary creatures wanting to rip our faces off. I've taken countless photos of different 'wildlife' that just haven't counted towards the achievement because for some reason it's just not picking it up that I've done it. 
---
For this comment here, do you have a specific challenge example you can give us?
---
Yeah sounds similar. This guy was no PA but was definitely a griefer and wanted to make me as angry as he was. It didn‚Äôt work.
---
Let me help get your joke out of the negative, I thought it was punny
---
This needs to happen. Would facilitate player transactions from out of the game much much easier. Send them an item to be sold at X price and then they can agree or disagree. Just like World of Warcraft has basically. FO76 could learn alot from other MMO's
---
Whoa are you carrying those on you or are they tucked in the stash?
---
Don't make another to get Fixer, you can get the plans to make it from sheep-quash and make it lvl 50 to boot. But yea sold my legendaries to vendor by accident and had to pay through the nose to get it back.
---
PC
---
Keep in mind that as your durability falls so does your resistances
---
No problem man glad I could have helped you out if it was me that‚Äôs the reason the base exists
---
Managed to gain a few levels, enjoying my time with Fallout 76. Still fun
---
i hope i don't have to pay atoms for it
---
No thanks. I can‚Äôt stand games that are too dark. To each their own I suppose.
---
Im saving all 3* items even low lvl for the legendary vendor
---
Which is why you always exit and re-enter the server :) 
---
It's not sometimes, it's very consistent. The extra glitch is always present if you start your game while inside the excavator. Exiting and re-entering the excavator will void the glitch.
---
Depending on your streght you can have about 520-570 carry weight in with Excavator. That's nearly twice as much of regular pocketed/deep pocketed armor. With high strength, some food bonuses you can get close to 600. All fairly easily. More temporary effects from alcohol, drugs ect can push it further, same as teammates and perks. It could be max is around 700, or close. But practically even reaching 600 takes a bit effort or fairly high strength. I have normally 540 with my str of 8, and with marsupine. Easy food increase it to 565 I think, and food lasts 30 mins at a time, which can be fairly easily sustained. Temporarly I often go little above it, and just use alcohol and drugs to be able to fast travel back to vendor/camp do unload stuff.
---
In the past when i had the stimpacks i would activate 2 pylons and run around like an idiot hiding as best as i could, take one pot shot to get my legendary but my main focus was to stay alive, not to do damage. Sadly there have been times no-one gets the 3rd which makes it much harder to stay alive or they don't even bother fighting. Once i realize this i just walk away.
---
Heres to all the people that keep engaging in a pvp mechanic and complaining to the internet when they get killed. 
---
Big thumbs up
---
Most rifle builds rely on vats and crits.  In PA you drain your core way to fast when vatting.  Also, legendary armor heavily buffs vats and crits with legendary effects, not possible in PA.  In short PA and rifles are not a very good combo.  Now PA and shotguns or heavy guns, very good combo.  I play exclusively a PA Shotgun/Explosive build.  Not having to buy expensive legendary armor allowed me to use all my caps for Explosive shotguns.  I have IE, BE, AAE and TSE pumps, db and combat.  I can one shot mire lurker queens, 68 Super mutants basically anything under a SB,  no crit or sneak gimmicks either.  I love the build.
---
Take your time, learn the mechanics, follow the main story line but do some side exploration.  Pay attention to your perks and what materials are good for crafting.
---
There‚Äôs PvP and there‚Äôs just cowardice. Like I said ‚Äòin the workshop menu‚Äô.. so not even able to fire back..
---
You can find 5 flares for the flare gun in a container. That's borderline more useful
---
Sentinal is 15% dmg reduction regardless of the item level. Would more than make up for 5-10 levels of DR.
---
Umm..... I may or may not remember since the last time I counted.
---
bingo was his name - oh
---
Will accept it within 15 minutes!
---
I think there is a tangible tradeoff on armor repair vs ammo / weapon repair materials between the two builds. The balance may need heavy tweaking, but
---
as an unarmed / melee player I am regularly trading stacks of copper and lead for ballistic fiber to players running ranged builds.
---
because you would play around 10 FPS on Mac
---
I have literally all the armor I need and I'm 90% happy with my guns. And my mule still has over 2300 pounds of 2/3* legendaries. 
---
I stopped trading with others now and just hoard like a maniac.
---
I can craft you a helmet, I can also craft a Polymer and BOS skinned helmet
---
Awesome job, on the camera shot! I love photography as a hobby. I  was not sure what to think about the camera being introduced to the game play, now I see why! My concerns were just that, getting attacked and killed before getting the perfect shot. Lol. But you proved it possible. Keep up the great work, I hope see you in the wasteland in the future. I wish you all the best from my wasteland family to yours.
---
Based on what I've seen of the dev intentions so far, there are two possibilities I see:
---
Unintentional bug (always a possibility with this game)
---
They believed it was too cheesable, because after the mayor for a day quest the robots stopped being hostile to you. That way you could guarantee an easy sneak attack crit fighting them one at a time. Getting essentially free 3* level 50 legendaries is not necessarily balanced in comparison to the rest of the game. Before a war breaks out, I'm not saying I agree with it, just giving the potential rationale from the devs
---
How can you kill it when it's invisible if it's only invisible when it's in invincible?
---
I've yet to find a situation where I need more than my excavator armor.
---
They're no worse than "RaIdeRs", who only engage when they have a ridiculous advantage.
---
*Cowardice¬†is a trait wherein fear and excessive self-concern override doing or saying what is right, good, and of help to others or oneself in a time of need‚Äîit is the opposite of courage. As a label, "cowardice" indicates a failure of character in the face of a challenge.*
---
I used the perfect storm for the longest amount of time, even though it was only level 40 for me. I got a furious 10mm smg later and switched over to that. It's still the best 10mm legendary I've got. I don't even have any good pipe guns, the best I got was a quad pipe bolt action, which is pretty much useless
---
I fought one yesterday,  he's frickin tough
---
I drop missiles, but try to drop nukes where someone can grab them like whitespring
---
That joke stopped being funny after the first 2 or 3 hundred times someone made it.
---
Lag, that‚Äôs why
---
Next time I will remember to try and kill someone when I have the highest chance of dying.
---
I have a perk that makes heavy weapons way hardly anything, so I just carry around my missile launcher, using up my missiles as I get them
---
Thats a lie.
---
Workshop claim/defend quests will give you CAMP related plans as part of the reward, so you could spend some time claiming workshops. If you want to fast track plan learning as a low level, claim and defend Gorge Junkyard then server hop and do it again until you‚Äôre bored with it. 
---
Also, when in a workshop, you build with the workshop‚Äôs materials as long as it holds out so that‚Äôs good for experimentation without burning through all your own building materials. 
---
The ‚Äúpowering up‚Äù power station events can reward you with generator plans but those events can be challenging for very low level players to do alone.
---
I did make a heavy weapons build on this same character and it worked out well but still I can‚Äôt get over how good melee is.
---
Give it 200 years and good ol deathclaw would ruin it
---
Checked my mutations effects /stats through my pipboy this weekend with and without Level 3 Class Freak. Everything reduced and increased as it should except Speed Demon.  For Grounded, my energy weapons reduction shows -12%  with perk slotted in the effects tab which is on par for energy weapon damage. Don't use energy weapons, so I have no actual damage data, but that is what it should show as reduction.  All my other mutations seem to be in range except for as I said, Speed Demon, which is still unaffected by Class Freak and has been reported as such for months now.   My Twisted Muscles was showing right for gun accuracy reduction, but my melee damage was down on all 3 Grog Axes and I traced that to leaving Bloody Mess off after I did some chem farming with Pharma Farma. Many people use armor/perks that can offset these mutation penalties even more.  Perhaps your friend changed some of his armor or left out a perk and didn't account for it?
---
Well, guess we know what kind of person you are. Enjoy that. 
---
Why even bother in Adventure mode.. isn‚Äôt PvP mode enough for you?
---
Right? I‚Äôm surprised I don‚Äôt see more bug posts about CAMP items.
---
Yea I remember the first time I cam across someone's drop with loads of missiles and like 6mini nukes. Was so excited till I got back to my stash and then had to throw away half the mini nukes and most of the rockets. Lol
---
No problem at all....
---
Quad explosive double barrel with reduced VATS cost. I've got one but it's level 35. Favorite gun ever.
---
People don't rage enough :)
---
exactly what i said.
---
"anyone posting trades here is trying to take advantage in one or another. "
---
seriously???  that person said that?  i have NEVER had a bad trade here.  once again, the 1% ruins it for the rest of us.  so sad.
---
i also have an excellent reputation for trading.  some trust me to the point of holding weapons, armor, caps, etc, while they go PvP.
---
as i said in my post, all this new rule did was eliminate the number of players i can reach out to.  "hey!  i got a TSE shotty for sale.  highest bid wins it!"  you gonna delete my post now?
---
players are already leaving fo76 in droves, now you have just given them ANOTHER reason to leave.  way to go bud, way to go.  :-(  ::shakes head in disbelief::
---
Drop them.
---
The damage output is low. 
---
Their effectiveness is absolutely weak.
---
I really feel like if this was another company with less bugs, there would be a focused pushback against the overly rng rewards and nerfed drops from everything. Theres just too many issues to rally behind. Ive got quests that are broken, still crashes, and the whole encryptid mess.
---
Mojave Deathclaws: Hold my beer.
---
Usually I just leave a beer or nukashine at their front step
---
Not that type of survival, its just the same game but pvp...take "the forest" type of survival for example
---
until they actually start to sell it
---
Yeah, the right build can counter the weapons and armor but I refuse to exploit the broken spawn mechanics and want them to be fixed.
---
Power armor should prevent all types of disease. Prove me wrong
---
First time I did a sheepsquatch, I got a vampire lmg. Working on speccing for heavy with auto backup.
---
not sure what country you are from, but over here where i am at, we can express our opinions freely.  if you do not like their opinion, just move on, ignore it.  just like i am going to ignore your reply.
---
Mostly playing around like fireworks and chaos. Not actually for combat. BTW, I think I have 40 grenades to give away. Back on in 5ish hours.
---
Someone get this man some Daytripper!!
---
Environmental, sure. But not from eating or drinking.
---
Cazadores: if you die you will never live this down
---
Good bot, even if its not the right place
---
Oh no my friend. The survival genre has already been perfected. You just need to buy minecraft now.
---
Yeah, or I could ask reddit so I could trade within the community, dude.
---
They don't care about banned or suspended players. Move on. It's shitty but if they would've listened to anyone's bitching it would've been mine. They suspended me after 900 hours. I bought a new account and am 430+ hours in.
---
Legendary Bloatfly: Sheepwho?
---
Anyone else take a minute to compose themselves after eyeing a good legendary, just before frantically swapping out charisma cards for hard bargain, popping grape mentats and rushing back to the vendor? I seem to do this even when I'm alone in a location. You never know! Just me?
---
Sorry let me not be sneaky at all with my sneak attack build. Ill just walk up u
---
announce my intentions and wait until hes ready for me to kill him. Sike!
---
it is a sad state of affairs that the single best weapon I have (after 110 levels)  is a 1\* vampyric buzz blade - even outshines All Rise and my 3\* Bloodied SMG.  Personally, I think the game tracks what kind of build you are trying to run based on perks and intentionally gives you gear that is absolutely useless. 
---
I would just about kill for an instigating hunting rifle, but Oh No - the game thinks I needs 20 copies of the same gorram troubleshooter's lead pipe.
---
I honestly think most people only focus on the pvp action on this server and save the nukes for adventure mode
---
Go to the golf course and aim as if you are heading to Flatwoods over the mountains. There is a gap in the wall just past the hole in the ground for pipe repairs so head through it and up the hill where you will find a lead deposit which you can mine with your camp for added bonus. 
---
I had my camp there for ages and it was always outside the nuke zone. Took me 30 seconds to go down the hill to enter the nuke zone with glowing bloated ones waiting for me and was close enough to go back to repair etc if needed.
---
Of course not.  Add a helmet mod that either makes food disease 0 or Water disease 0. 
---
But getting slapped from a ghoul should not give me a disease if a .50cal can't "penetrate"
---
Yes, it was just Awesome! I  would love to see this as a twice a month event. As per the sheepsqauch, I had a three some in the bog on Saturday, strange phenomenon, but I was attacked by 3, the first two together, and the other almost knocked my head off. Lol. Haven't seen any more since? Must have been a glitch. Nonetheless I survived. I hope to see you in the wasteland. I wish you the best!
---
Nice. The weather and clouds always amazes me in this game. I saw a strange rain cloud the other, and I spent 10 mins just watching it form and disperse through my gun scope. Was so realistic.
---
Should they challenge you to a duel and then wait patiently while you rearrange perk cards and reload your guns?  The workshops are the PVP area of Adventure mode.  They are *supposed* to be tense and dangerous.
---
missiles are useless I try not to pick them up but I can't pass up a mini nuke even if it's just to shoot at a mole rat
---
I was teamed up with a guy that went to a large player created event which he described as a "rave in a brothel"  Just a bunch of players(15+ players I assume) naked (in underwear) and dancing.  Then they did events together as a large group.  He said it was the most fun he's had in game.  Not my experience unfortunately.  
---
In the earlier months of the game, when someone nuked watoga, everyone had to go.  You would show up to the scorch beast queen and the whole server would be there, bullets flying and mobs ragdolling everywhere, it was truly a sight to see.
---
Oooooohhhhh I totally forgot. I thought I got good at this game, now I know it was just a double xp weekend. Well great I'm still shit then.
---
I thought that *was* a no-CAMP area? Did they leave out the one spot people actually wanted CAMPs removed from?
---
Anyway just do what I do, take a TSE or an Orbital Strike Beacon and unleash hell on that motherfucker.
---
Initially they might seem like a waste, but you've clearly haven't used the missile launcher or the fatman yet. They simply don't do enough damage to justify the weight or the cost of crafting the ammo. The missile launcher is about as effective as a decent shotgun or rifle, making it worthless in comparison. The fatman doesn't at all hold up towards end game. It's far more likely to get you killed than help at all.
---
yup.  +1
---
i love these "tweeners" and "child adults", as i call them.  you say any thing even remotely negative, and they just slam you with some nonsensical sewage leaking from that gash in their face.  (keep your heads out of the gutter guys!)  ha ha!
---
It does sort of. I started using it yesterday, though the damage isn't as high as I think it should be. I do   
---
X 2.50 sneak attack damage and with mister sandman, I would expect that to rise to X 3.75 as it's +50% sneak damage. However, I only get X 3.50. However I found it makes a big difference with my main sneak/sniper build. I went from 4 shots to two shots when taking out lvl 59-68 super mutants with a calibrated Lever-action rifle and fully specked Rifleman perks.
---
Lol. I don't even have a launcher for nukes. And my rocket launcher is so heavy I've never had it on me.
---
Ah, a man of culture i see
---
This would be nice. Currently being apart of some Buy Sell Trade groups on FB it is getting stupid on some peoples asking or bidding of 50-80K in CAPs for a item. Inflation of prices has already happening.   
---
All we can do now is just increase the CAP limit and hurry up with the legendary vendor. Hopefully have his items truly be legendary.
---
Maybe your stash keeps but your character/perks reset because they're tailoring challenges and events to different kinds of perks and builds. Like each season has kind of a different gameplay style goal you can choose to rebuild and chase
---
That's also to assume the builds are revamped a little because it's a little lackluster ATM
---
It was fine early on with the body always there but last times I found the body only once even with the camera trick. Only thing I notice was different was the amount of explosive weapons being used.
---
Our group only has one guy that uses a fat man, so we all collect all the mini nukes we find and save him having to craft them.
---
thx, but no thx.
---
Yea me too and I also loved farming Watoga, but now it sounds like they nerfed that too. I dislike the grind in this game
---
Yesterday to my surprise someone actually launched one. I was on a 12 hour binge and probably went through dozens of servers. So no, not common.
---
For this particular point I don't really care if they do or not. I'm just trying to tell you that the law of diminishing results destroyed that joke months ago.
---
With backpacks i should be at 575 carry weight with ex. Dont scrap
---
Workshop priorities: stash box, any crafting table for scrapping. Then after I've scrapped/dumped, get turrets up for the inevitable defense event. When that's done, get extractors running and set up cooking station, fast travel mat, bed, and tuba. 
---
That's when I let my guard down.
---
Wouldn't hold my breath unfortunately. They are batting like 0.750 on delays thus far.
---
It‚Äôs it‚Äôs lvl 15 or lower I‚Äôd happily take it off your hands
---
"trowing you boddy". 
---
Even if this guy did cheat, you're an idiot.
---
Maybe you could submit a ticket to Bethesda so that they can perhaps have the translation updated? It seems like a very relevant omission in the translation.
---
Make it level 76 (just because!) instead of 50!  Once you hit level 76 you should have quality gear and a decent build made up.
---
Great idea though. I think they need to figure out a way to make all the creatures able to scale to 50 though. Aren't some of the mobs locked to lower level like mole miners,and bugs?
---
I recently started using a 2 shot powerful automatic 10mm that had been sat in my stash for ages. I only started using it as I‚Äôd noticed I had accumulated almost 8k 10mm rounds I‚Äôd discarded into my stash without thinking about it. 
---
So I‚Äôve fully modded it out and have been using it when farming in lower level areas. Its actually made a fun change and has made me nostalgic of a time 120+ levels ago lol.
---
Unless you actually made the comment without any humor intended. Then I'm not sure what to say. Must be awful to live life so stressed about things that havn't yet and don't have any actual indication that they will ever happen.
---
So true story I was on survival yesterday and someone placed a camp where I had mine so I got the typical stay and pack up or find another world  pop up.
---
I chose find another world, like 5 times in a row, and it constantly reloaded into the same world.
---
So I don't think alot of people are doing anything in survival.
---
I was also in the top 3 consistently all weekend even though I haven't killed anyone.
---
I launshed my first one in survivor this weekend...I knew I couldn't keep playing for too much longer so I launched toward top of the world  are where the leade had been hanging out and popping people....anything to disturb them lol.
---
I don't think you actually have to capture the workshop to spawn it. I had this idea when I went to do them days ago, and I went to the Munitions Factory workshop and just walked up to the helipad, repaired it, and then took a pic of the vertibot.
---
Just blow it up
---
Unfortunately its level 40
---
WOW!!!  now the mods here are going thru this thread DELETING all the comments expressing our disbelief that we can no longer post trades here!!  mine included.  so sad.  here is what i said that got deleted.....
---
it  has declined in people as more and more are leaving fo76.  early on,  you could go to the market discord and make trades right there and then.   now the discord is vacant 24/7.
---
it is  actually sad that trading posts are no longer allowed, as here and the  forums are about the only place fo76 people frequent any more.  with  player vending coming in a few weeks, how else am i suppose to say,  "hey!  here i am!  open for business.  here is what i have for sale."   it is not like i can rip off people.  i post here what i have for sale.   what times i am available.  prices.  where my CAMP is located.  you  then come and look for your self.  if you do not like what ya see, you  do not have to buy it.
---
No thanks
---
True, but cavalier would be much more useful to me
---
I think if there is customization, it will only be on the last two stars with some new effects.
---
If they allow you to add one if the current effects (I.e. bloodied, ffr, etc) the market won‚Äôt really exist anymore except for legacy weapons.
---
Forgot about that, thanks for reminding me
---
Why buy other games for survival when the perfect survival game already exists? NGL I still bought Rust (and hated it) as well as Stranded Deep (This one's pretty cool)
---
My biggest question is whether or not we'll be able to add \*s to existing \*/\*\* items... Mostly because I already have \*/\*\* versions of the stuff I want and just need to slap that third \* on. Heh.
---
I had a somewhat similar experience over the weekend.  Attempting to fast-travel to a ghoul horde kept putting me inside Garrahan Mining HQ.  The map marker for the horde wasn't even remotely close, but after a couple fast travel attempts kept putting me back in the HQ, the ghouls eventually spawned in the next room over.  Weird.
---
The more space they give us the faster we will fill it all up :(
---
I think we need a more fundamental solution like junk going to an unlimited crafters stash like ESO in subscription mode.
---
So that's why they won't let endurance gain from Unyielding. Basically like the armor glitch that gave unlimited carry weight.
---
I'm interested in Perception. It seems like even if it isn't capped there is still a point where your VATS accuracy out performs the range of your weapon. At that point you would probably want points to go somewhere else. I'm strictly luck, agility, and perception and don't need perfectly preserved pies so maybe I'll look for armor and weapons with agility.
---
Thanks for sharing.
---
Yeah stranded deep is pretty cool, you should try out the long dark, if you're a fan of survival games, you're gonna love it
---
You missed the point of the post, huh?
---
I hope the way it works by... you can turn legendarys for tokens... and you use those tokens to reroll the effects of any legendary... get 3 tokens for a 3 star... cost 3 tokens to reroll for all 3 stars... maybe to have the choice to save 1 of the stars and reroll the other 2... but it would still cost 3 tokens
---
Survival mode feels like one big pvp grief fest
---
That was a well times nuke launch, lol
---
Good stuff. Didnt expect anything like this happening with nukacrypt
---
At least now when you do the Side Quests that give unique weapons they‚Äôll be max level.
---
I wouldn‚Äôt come back if you weren‚Äôt satisfied at launch. They havent added enough, or fixed enough, to justify the amount of time it takes to start playing this game again.
---
Anti-armor weapons with crippling perks/attachments attacking her wings to bring her to the ground. Then melee heavy hitters with crippling perks/attachments to keep her down. And don‚Äôt throw grenades. I personally use a buzzblade and attack her legs and wings to keep her crippled.
---
That would be nice to see, though I think it‚Äôll be some time with the servers before we get a crafters stash
---
That was a really cool CAMP! I liked how you added lots of depth with different levels and heights. There were some preference differences but If everyone built the same, none would be interesting and unique. Really enjoyed seeing yours, thanks for the tour. I took a few pictures for inspiration with later builds!
---
No haven't used the Fatman yet (not in FO76 anyway) that's what I was kinda thinking though.
---
I will check it out. Is the Forrest worth it? 
---
Aslo, Little I die game called "Force of Nature" is pretty good if you can get it for cheap.
---
Very much sounds like raiders. Gross
---
To help stop the washout, i like to go to biv's. It has a nice mix of light and dark, and it's easy to see the difference in sharpen and tv/monitor brightness.
---
Just buy it at the vendors almost all of them have it
---
If they‚Äôre actually gonna he canvas this time.
---
Did you read the post above mine? You can respawn / fast travel to party members. All it would take is a 3rd person hiding out nearby acting as a respawn point.
---
Someone should be using the endangerol syringer and keeping it going the whole fight.  Other than that it's pretty straight forward. Keep the random mobs off the melee guys and keep shooting.
---
If you need ballistic fiber just do a few runs of Fort Defiance on the 3rd floor, if no one takes the military ammo bags it‚Äôs a pretty fast way of getting fiber. Also if you do the new free range event and kill the sheepsquatch or any sheepsquatch at all, they drop mysterious fur which also scraps into fiber.
---
Have you met a raider in any other game? They are all assholes
---
And who's fault is that?
---
 If you don't like pvp avoid workshops
---
Spamming the Vertibord in Converted Munitions Factory.

Have you met a raider in any of the other games? They are all assholes
---
Use them to permanently unclog my toilets.
---
I have a combat armor camo skin that works on combat armor helmets. 
---
Haven't tried it on the standard combat helmets. 
---
I assume if you bought the blood washed skin that it would work too.
---
Raiders cut people's heads off and put them on pikes.
---
Bad language is totally in the bounds of their behavior.
---
congrats?
---
If they decided to take out PVP from adventure mode, but they left PVP in only for workshops or certain events, like monster mash, I would be SO down
---
Pick yourself up and learn from this. Next time stash your stuff first at camp.
---
Literally
---
I'm personally not too fussed if armour isn't max level. I only have one endurance point for Radicool, I run Adrenal Reaction too. The extra DR isn't too important; I'll still be a soft target. With weapons on the other hand, it's painful. It can be a pretty significant gap in damage output.
---
Oooh, good ole' force of nature, i almost forgot about it, and yeah, the forest is really good, hard at first but once you get used to it, its easy
---
Yeah, perfect view from your place there too lol. Very nice.
---
been hearing this story way too often lately.. I have not experienced it myself...
---
For luck I use crit savvy 2, better crit 1, bloody 3, serendipity 3, class freak 3, starched gene 2

---
&gt;Horse armor is much more cosmetic and not part of an online game
---
Which is part of the reason it was so hilariously dumb. If you pay for cosmetics in an online game, at least other players will see them.

The strat I usually see is 4-5 guys with souped up rocket sledges pummel her when she lands and keep her landed, then guys in PA with Gatling guns/Tesla rifles/handmades fend off the scorched/adds
---
I don't understand why they stress the server with additional 100 weight,when they could have made a 30 weight universal stash ,to let us move stud between characters.
---
Don't get me wrong i'm all for extra weight,new stuff and customizable, but i prefer stability before all that.
---
ive played this game for 1300+ hours. I treat it as if other people dont exist, because they are almost always unreliable.
---
Well I guess that's good to know I'm not the only one
---
I got it on pc,bought from the boss bot at watoga,scrapped it now I can make it .
---
Agreed, happened to me yesterday. Only my friends and I actually activated the pylons and everyone else just watched us die.
---
Same. I honestly tried but in the end, only got him to around 23. My main went from 35 to 60.
---
Np ill be on in ab 30
---
It did change. It was hugely expensive to die in survival mode. I would lose 300 plus caps ( double your level) every time I got sneak shot. I just wanted them to cap it at level 76. Then the most you could lose was 152 caps. That seems fair, IMO.  So basically a level 5 dies in pvp and loses 10 caps, a level 25 loses 50 caps, a level 300 loses 152 caps.  Still a decent amount but not devastating to anyone.  
---
I did the very first survival weapon challenge and must have been killed 15 times, while minding my own business. I then only played long enough to win the weapon and go back to adventure.  Shortly after they dropped the amount to something piddly. Now people go and exploit pvp stuff in adventure mode.
---
Get to the lighthouse I got it there.
---
Lol, right?! =D
---
Ap regen is my fave, both had it with the cav
---
So keen to test it out. Was up late faffing about and there they were, haha
---
1k every 5 minutes sounds pretty slow to  be honest.
---
Its a multiplayer game, and you still replied to a comment about playing with other people by saying you dont play with other people.
---
Yes. Mad panic of cards and chems. There are times with others hovering that I just pay the extra 20 caps.
---
When you have two people on your team and you die you can simply respawn on your corpse or your friend's corpse. If it's at your Camp it would respond people at the general spawn point of your Camp. If you guys are at a location it would spawn people at the spawn point for that general area. It's all about spawning on your teammate. That's why they keep showing up in your camp
---
I don‚Äôt care about the junk or the caps, both are plentiful in the wasteland, it‚Äôs just such a loser thing to do..
---
I agree. I have been wanting to create Haunted Houses this Halloween, but other than building in The Mire there aren't many atmospheric options for it. The current lighting also renders the pipboy or PA light rather moot. I rarely use either unless it's inside a cell like a bunker.
---
Maybe we need to adjust out monitors and in-game brightness setting?
---
Very interesting ideas here.
---
I was getting more XP @WS just screwing around. And way more many of the times WS was nuked.
---
Not sure if Bethesda will be looking at this one again, but Im unsure of the link to the main suggestions page.  Quick equip perk builds would be nice to have as well. Its so tedious to have to take off perk cards to switch them for another if you want to say switch from melee to heavy or weapons crafting. The option to save 3 or 4 diffrent builds, so that one could quickly switch between them would make the experiance  better.
---
I have a set of each. I‚Äôm a hoarder!
---
How do you take a specific mutation off? I thought it was random
---
Don't worry, i know the numbers and what i should have. Thanks for caring on this case, but that's not a durability problem.  
---
People gave the stats of armors a long time ago already when this kind of bug first appeared (which was linked to some undersuits &amp; armors), and it was really pointed at, and got fixed by Bethesda.   
---
Today, like back in the day when this bug was around, there's 60 points missing from the total we should have. Since it's a raw missing of 60 everywhere, i'm pretty sure it's the chassis that loose his resistances when you put pieces on it.
---
I agree
---
I had idiots trying to run in front of me when I was fighting mobs. Just to get me to hit them.  Pretty pathetic if you ask me.
---
Nice try Bethesda...
---
Everyone was already mayor, there was zero risk for garentee reward. It was a stupid place to farm and needed patched. Simple as that.
---
I'm thinking it's going to be a variation of 1.  Turn in a 3*, same result as killing a 3* in the wild.  Ditto with 2* and 1*. That is, complete RNG.  This would have minimal impact on world economy and overall legendary quality.
---
Thank you, I was going for a county jail kinda theme
---
I use to camp right along the fence line at the southern end of the golf course (there is a junk pit on the outside of the fence line).... Never got hit by a nuke being that low, and as I walked up to the bunker entrance would pass two cap stashes
---
I recommend checking before you drop a nuke, if one is there, swap server.
---
I‚Äôd give the cryolator a hard pass, that western though
---
The prima guide has the local maps.
---
Throw them on the ground. They are not hard to find or craft and they take up a ton of space. If I‚Äôm fighting moleman who drop a lot of missiles and missile launchers sometimes I‚Äôll fire them off just for the hell of it, but otherwise I drop them immediately.
---
I was tempted to put it near there, but recently my brother placed his there and his camp was always getting attacked by super mutants and stingwings
---
well, you do you!
---
I jsut hope you both are able to find some friends in game, it makes the experience so much more fun
---
I was about to give up on the game when i started playing, but a few very kind people helped me out and showed me the ropes, and ever since then i have remembered that and now try to make others realize how much fun can be had with jolly cooperation
---
if you are ever on PS4 you can check out my helper CAMP,my psn id is FritoZ
---
I suppose the new "interface" is more clean, but I have to say I liked the old background(?) image more.
---
The site and the background of hacking the codes weekly, is great advantage to everyone.
---
Not to mention the weight
---
Yeah I get the same issue.
---
the answer starts with ‚Äúthey don‚Äôt‚Äù and ends with ‚Äúcare‚Äù
---
I got gunned down by the new turrets on someones workshop when I went to defend it for them. Lol. Never again.
---
Sure, as long as they offered zero protection and maybe -carry weight, lol
---
Side note. I was also much disappointed in Anthem üòÇ
---
I prefer to call it broken. Can't really judge you for using it, but Bethesda really needs to do some balancing.
---
Seriously tho. The double xp on a level 62 charred ghoul is like what, 320? 350? And there's like what, 25? 30? in the clubhouse that takes like 5 minutes to clear. And probably another 30, 40 shambling around the rest of Whitespring? Sounds much more lucrative to me.
---
Okay thanks for the info. No love for lasers :(   
---
But, lasers are not the only problem, a lot of weapon are pretty bad and need some balancing.
---
I have yet to die of a disease. Though it is a pain to keep getting them if a ghoul even looks at you.
---
If you're already at WS when you catch the disease, just run over to the sulphur water fountain at the gazebo. One sip and you're cured. More sips and you're rehydrated. Plus you might get lucky and run into a deathclaw, Yao Guais, or Grafton monster on your way there.
---
I only ever had a few mutants attacks.... usually when the robots couldnt deal with them. If I had moved a little more east along the fence I would probably not been bothered by them at all
---
thats like 2-3 kills at west tech, which take seconds...
---
or a 5 kills? of ghouls at burrows or golf course...
---
I agree with this. Nothing else in the game is destructible. The only exception should be doors to camp.  If some guy accumulates a huge bounty and hides in his house there would be no way to get him with destructible camps. On the other hand having the poor bastard sit inside his house afraid to leave would kinda be like a self imposed jail sentence. Lol.
---
I carry around a daisy cutter just to shoot mini nukes as I get them
---
Very nice. Thanks for sharing!
---
Im not so sure they have removed all legendaries from there. Another thing that fairly recently happened, the vendor changed, made it so that any particular location is no longer needed to be visited, to collect caps from vendors. 
---
I think it's more about less high level players visiting the area. -&gt;less legendaries.
---
Bro, you can change the brightness of your pc
---
"Fuck, if the rabbit didn't want to die, it would have a set of Unyeilding Assassin's armor like mine." -Hunters
---
I think they are more rare, but definetely seen them.
---
This would be the simple way to do it. There does need to be some type of timer though. What's to stop the owner from never going back to defend?
---
Buy the plans for the 10mm SMG.  Build and scrap to learn the mods.
---
A level 50 SMG with full Commando perks shreds.  Unfortunately no suppressor so stealth is out, and you do need to get pretty close.  
---
For stealth a 10mm automatic pistol is a better choice, but most people don't have the perks to fully advantage it.
---
I dont even pick that stuff up anymore.. if i get it for a quest I dump it in a high traffic area..
---
It‚Äôs fun for queen freezing
---
Yea.  Honestly, they could remove the whole day/night cycle now and there wouldn't be much difference.  They blend so smoothly into each other it makes stuff like the Pip-Boy light, NV Scopes, and the Night Eyes perk extremely situational.  They gave us all these tools specifically designed to explore throughout the night...but now nighttime is so bright we don't need them.
---
Absolutely they do. I almost exclusively scrapped charging snipers and specifically recall getting mods.
---
By clearing up radiation and praying to Atom above that it gets rid of the mutation you don't want.
---
I think the workshops are fine with pvp but it needs to be fair. What's to stop one guy from running the map and taking all the workshops?
---
The "loser move" as you put it, is to engage in pvp then complain and call the other player names when they sneak up on you and kill ya.
---
Tried twice to kill SBQ with 5-8 high level players &amp; couldn't bring her down in time. Lots of wasted ammo. Hope they balance that. Most disappointing
---
Same I'll stick to adventure mode for now, because even though they said they fixed slap damage, I still get one shot at level 100 in Survival. My build is admittedly not that great but I don't like getting my cheeks clapped. Eventually I hope to fix my build though.
---
So...just the nest or is the sheepsquatch near?
---
Thanks for letting Bethesda know who you are. They'll be right with you.
---
When I first read the title I thought it said, "Please add venereal disease."
---
Glowing Pustules replies, "Hold my beer."
---
I don't think it will have any effect on their business model, other than giving players a quick way to spend 50 cents in a pinch. Literally, if you don't buy any, why should it effect you? 
---
Unless a player is truly unprepared, it's not going to effect PvP in any way.. so what is there to complain about?
---
Not even high level. As long as you're level is high enough the supermutants in the guard towers at the penitentiary will have them.
---
I farmed two days ago and got plenty of it by the row of building and in front of club house.
---
Legendary Deathshead Radscorpion: Who's the newb?
---
Yea, Im not seeing that *sad panda*
---
I'm 600 hours in and regardless of the reward I'm going for it. But only 20 atoms, come on.
---
LvL50 Perfect Storm...my second toon was knowledgeable enough to hold off for this!!!!  Well worth the wait.  I don't know why its so satisfying seeing a Scorched spend the last moments of life not only full of holes but on fire as well !!!  Its kinda sick.
---
Exactly, I'm fine with a long term goal. It'd just be nice if when I got there.. It was good. I'll be playing no matter what, but still :/
---
I‚Äôm on Xbox, don‚Äôt know if that matters. I farmed crimson, cobalt, yellowcake, and fluorescent.
---
I remember mininukes being devastating in fallout 4, but in fallout 76, they can certainly one shot SOME enemies, but the heavy weight, the smaller blast radius, the lesser damage, and etc, just makes it very underwhelming and doesn't give you a distinct advantage compared to cheaper alternatives. I suspect that the mininuke is underwhelming simply because if it carried over the same damage potential from fallout 4 to this game, the damage against players and player structures would just be too powerful.
---
Did that yesterday, actually had to go steel farming had so much lead. 1 trip = 8000ish 5mm rounds
---
I have one alt character with 800 lbs of armour in stash and 450 on her, another character full of weapons, and one full of junk/ammo/plans lol I‚Äôm dying for this update. and my main character is almost maxed lol
---
With that same comment they also mentioned adjusting cryo ammo.
---
I always just pay the cap difference. It's 20-40 caps.
---
Notice this game struggles to handle twenty players. We gotta get realistic
---
Same, but fluorescent isnt spawning for me. Ill try resetting and see if that fixes it.
---
Great idea. The game right now lacks end game content, and the end game we do have is all on the east side of the map.
---
Respawns it happens at the worst times :/
---
I farmed it multiple times this weekend and found a ton of it each time.
---
You could farm acid from yao guais, grafton monsters for oil, and get steel from iron ore. All of those combined would yield much more in a similar amount of time, but even then it's just not worth it.
---
I got a pre-patch Explosive-Junkies-?Something? Gatling Plasma. Post-patch, it just *melts* anything short of the queen/Imposter Sheepsquatch. Bought it for, what, 400ish caps from a vendor. Good times.
---
I never had an issue with darkness in FO4, but I have to say 76 was way too dark during the beta. My first time out of the vault the sun had just gone down. Trying to get to Flatwoods and go through the responder quest was way more difficult than it should have been because I couldn't see squat. Went back later in the game and didn't recognize the place because of the difference. Yes, some 'nights' are too bright and if it wasn't for the crickets I'd have no clue it was night. But the original levels were too dark. If they could find a way to darken it outside but lighten interiors and most of the mire, that would be ideal. The mire is still too dark for me 80% of the time. I just see silhouettes against a bright background and the lamp causes me to lose stealth. Or make it user controllable? Let people with ultrabright monitors darken it up and those of us with black calibrated monitors dial up the brightness.
---
I'm hoping we can add stars and chose which stars to reroll. For example of you have a 3 star weapon you can randomly reroll the first, second or third star. Only being able to randomly reroll but select which effect gets rerolled will give everyone a way to get the gear they want but still keep some of the endgame grind for gear. No guarantee how long it will take but you will be able to get the item eventually with enough legendary farming
---
TS .50 mg/ TS minigun/TSE handmade/AA Instigating gause for sbq. 
---
Vampire .50 mg /AA instigating Gause rifle for mobs.
---
Far from the most effective, but I‚Äôve stacked perks for heavy/power armour and stealth/Rifleman.
---
Honestly, I'm okay with delayed instead of canceled.
---
I didn't hear about it till this morning. üòû
---
 No. I take a delight in selling Legendaries to Wallace although if you have your ears on I'll give you stuff including whatever I have found and don't want.
---
I dump missiles. I drop nukes on random unsuspecting targets for luls.
---
I can‚Äôt stand running at a legendary and either it drops dead or it drops out of sight for 3 seconds and is no longer legendary.
---
I'm on ps4 and haven't crashed at west tek at all the past 2 weeks, so maybe that crash is platform specific.
---
Same happened to me. Tried 3 times this weekend didn't kill her once. Every single time we had 8+ players all level 150 and up. This happened about 4 months ago after an update. You couldn't kill her for about a week or 2 till they fixed it. Glad you posted this so I know I'm not the only one.
---
I died to a lv 19 as a lv 90 w god tier armor because the world wouldn‚Äôt load in and I was getting shot at by shapes and lost 300 quantum‚Äôs trying to complete the action hero challenge. I kept serving hopping and ending up in the same world the servers are pretty dead.
---
I found this guy as well.  Super cool dude showed me in.  Obviously unintended by Beth.
---
I'm with you OP. People justifying ganking someone who has been peacefully gathering resources and taking everything, only to ensure you have literally 0 recourse or ability to reclaim your stuff, are idiots.
---
Congratulations! The recent updates have definitely made the game 100% more enjoyable, glad there are still people around to notice! :)
---
There wasn't one. And swapping server right after going through the hassle of dropping the nuke is the last thing, I want to do.
---
Telling people the secret spot! Lol
---
Currently in Survival (or any PvP):
---
\- Power Armor will get you killed, period.  In fact if you're in PA expect to die first, because usually you'd only be in PA if transporting a lot of junk, and you've just labeled yourself as a "junk pinata" and someone's about to get a payday.
---
\- Shotguns when used with correct Perks do stagger, but with their range you'll be dead before you can use it unless you're going against melee.
---
\- From what I've observed on Survival, heavy weapons are rare. And when I do see them they are laser/plasma gatling guns with legacy explosive.  And even then they are too inaccurate vs laser rifles/pistols (or most other weapons).
---
\- You'd need to use Tormentor with VATS.  And currently most high-end PvP'ers are using Stealth Boys like candy, so no VATS on them.  Most of the time when/if you can spot their stealth shimmer you've got very little time to aim and fire, let alone trying to line up shots to their legs to stagger.
---
Kinda wonder why you aren't in Survival smacking the lowest level players in a group, but hey, no judgement intended. Point is, you shouldn't be treated as an asshole or reported if you smack someone and they choose to smack you back because that's their choice to engage or not.  Win or lose. Right in line with the game mechanics here. If you just keep smacking them and calling them names on chat and obstructing their access with no response, then again, you haven't really done anything against the game mechanics, you only are being generally annoying, maybe in possible violation of TOS, Depends what you say. I'm leaning towards asshole here, but I'm not sure everyone gets as upset about this as others .  I usually just move on and they eventually get tired of harassing an undamageable turtle and move on themselves.  My team member got banned for 24 hrs. this past weekend for bullying because some kid got butthurt my friend wouldn't pay the asking price for a gun he was selling, the kid initiated PVP, my friend killed him about 4 times and the kid cursed him out over chat.  My friend texted him to Quit Crying and got reported and banned for bullying.  My opinion of all this is and always will be that Asshole does what Assholes do no matter what side of the fence your on.
---
Staying alive.
---
Unfortunately, upping monitor brightness affects everything in the world including all light sources, and not to mention the UI.
---
Well they could nerf sentinel &amp; cavalier effects on armor (normally 75% in total) to almost zero, but leave the assassin's effect at 40% as its not hard to obtain assassin's armor from PVE drops. That would be the first step.
---
Next on the list would be crits against other players, if they could make those enemy-specific. They already fixed a bug that gave crits for all the \*remaining\* bullets in the magazine on automatic weapons (instead of resetting the crit meter correctly).
---
You can set up a camp behind the Golf Club that will draw out half the ghouls and just kill them through the windows. I built a base there to help me farm XP, but the turrets are deliberately blocked so they can only fire on stuff I lure out for this reason.
---
Wish we had truly daily events. Like Mothman Mondays where you have a much greater chance to encounter a mothman and the event at the lighthouse has a shorter cooldown and is active every hour. Flatwoods Monster Fridays? Sheepsquatch Saturday? Wendigo Wednesday? Ok, I'll stop.
---
Or special events that only happen one day of the week on a certain day. I feel once you get to the endgame and aren't farming for legendaries or camp building, the game seems to loose some drive and purpose. Fasnacht was awesome and I had a reason to rush home and hop on. I'd still be doing it to get rare masks if it was still going. I wish Encrypitd would auto fire if no one had started it in a while. I would join every time but I don't care to pay 2k each time to start it.
---
I totally disagree, I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs something about my display (oled) but I couldn‚Äôt see anything at all at night, even using pa lights or pipboy it was barely playable, and not fun at all. It seems a little better now, I still need a pipboy to see anything at night, but  god it used to be awful.
---
I've been playing around with a vampires explosive 10MM smg. Same thing. It just eats through ammo. But it's insane I heal instantly as long as I'm hitting what I'm shooting at. Sheepsquatch couldn't kill me the other day one on one. Then I ran out of ammo.
---
The work around is remove mutations until you remove the one you don't want. Then purchase serums for the ones you do want on the market from another player. Then take serums. Then put on Starched Genes and don't ever remove it if you don't want to acquire a mutation that you don't want in the wild.
---
I picked two of the spawn locations that were close and fast traveled between them and server hopped. Found it at the lighthouse on my like 10th server hop.
---
You can't. It's a gamble
---
That is a very plausible scenario, but what about the 4th and 5th star?
---
If the workshops are PVP mechanic, they are a terrible one. They are not rewarding enough to justify fighting for. They are barely worth the effort to maintain without the inconvenience of dealing with wankers. 
---
All they do is allow wankers to achieve a false sense of self worth as they annoy another type of person who's obsessed with getting the stuff to build their Barbie Wasteland Dream House. At which point one or both people leave for another server. The wanker basking in the annoyance her or she has cause another person by stealing their bag of crap that they have no use for and can not easily sell.
---
There are times when I have had five of the top workbench sites on the map for hours and never get jumped once. More often than not people show up to help with the defense events and leave. Other times I've been jumped while experimenting with one of the worst sites on the map.
---
As a PVP mechanic it is a failure. It is to PVP what premature ejaculation is to sex. I call them wankers for a reason.
---
People do this because it's insanely profitable. You can get stupid amounts of caps quickly and all the junk you will ever need. Workshops are PvP areas, they literally give you a warning prior to claim it. Enter sneak mode while your in a workshop, makes it SIGNIFICANTLY harder for someone to gank you. Best of luck out there.
---
Is there a chance that only the vegetarian perk goes away?
---
It's in the card description?...
---
I liked having a Double XP weekend, but I just wish it hadn't been "THIS" weekend where some of us had gone to see Avengers, Game of Thrones, and (in my case) have a relative to go help who was recovering from surgery. 
---
I only managed to go from 69 to 71 in like four hours of playtime, but I tried to do as much as I could to take advantage of the time.
---
It would be nice to do a double XP event again when the other vaults open so we all have a dedicated reason to sign on.
---
Use diluted radaway and lose them one at a time and hope the one you want gone is the first to go
---
For good camps, do the main quest until they send you to Top of the World, at which point you'll need to level some. That will get you a lot of base camp plans. Beyond that, do Workshops, which also give plans, and check every safe and toolbox you can, because they also drop plans.
---
What platform are you on my friend?
---
Slim to none.
---
THIS IS A TRADE POST AND SHOULD BE REMOVED BY AUTOMOD (Kidding still salty)
---
It started Thursday night at least, from what I remember. Sort of a compromise.
---
This is about the only place on the whole map people wanted blocked.  They even supposedly updated this. I still see them though.
---
Damn, was gonna give you mutation serums for nothing :(
---
Me too man
---
Whitesprings, West-Tek, Burrows
---
Aww man :( thanks anyways though
---
No worries good luck :)
---
Even the weak need to eat.
---
But, you could find an independent vendor and but the serums much cheaper.
---
The only thing it does is give electrical damage to robots. Prime would be pointless as it would negate the bonus damage to robots. As far as named legendaries go, Somerset Special is a better gun and is my backup for lower level areas to save wear and tear on my primaries. Just wish it had a silencer option to keep my stealth. The anti-armor bonus is great. With stealth and criticals maxed, I can one-shot the WS ghouls with it. I feel the bonus of voice of set is less useful as it only targets one enemy type that's not very common. It wouldn't be wise to use that as a primary for taking a silo and outside of pre-mayor for a day Watoga, there's not much use for it in my opinion.
---
When you fast travel to white springs, he is on the car right in front of you
---
In a word, no. It is quickly outclassed by pretty much everything else you can get at a comparable level and is not modifiable
---
Yeah, that's what I was getting at.
---
I had a camp at Site Alpha set up as a little repair and resupply point for anybody heading into the silo that I had to move further away because of that update and now I find out the *one* spot people wanted unbuildable is still fair game. Bethany what the hell
---
on the day they released repair kits I repaired my armor to 100% within an hr it was broken. which at the time seemed a tad quicker then normal.
---
Travel agent and gunsmith. Why? That's 6 points wasted on some materials and a few caps.
---
If someone‚Äôs a repeat offender and bothering more than just one player; we should be allowed to name and shame them.
---
How would I do that? Where could I go?
---
From drinking it? Because if so just go into your inv
---
Blimey. That some serious effort. Looks fantastic.
---
Time probably had a lot to do with it but the story allows for the lack of human npcs. It's not something I would like to see in other fallout games (especially not the usual single player games) but it works for this one. I like the idea of them fleshing out the factions more but I also think they can give players the tools and activities to do so. Like if you decide to rebuild the raiders, you get missions to attack camps, locations or even other players. If you side with Mysteries, you can get missions to protect places and players.
---
Travel agent because of yes a few caps but I would rather keep them and gunsmith so my explosive gauss doesn't break every two seconds
---
I'm aware of how to remove the mutations, just sucks that the game clearly states the symptoms are surpressed yet it clearly isn't.
---
I've never had this happen playing daily since beta day one. However, I recently started a second account on an old laptop for a mule and the game runs like crap on it. Due to the lag and other issues, I have inadvertently dropped, scrapped, and sold things I didn't mean to. I'm wondering if something like this is happening to you or others. What system are you on?
---
I didn‚Äôt engage in PvP I was in the Workshop menu..  like shooting someone who‚Äôs playing an instrument or lying in bed.. and then running off to another server
---
My understanding is it's just a different skin, but I'm not sure.
---
What if you already did pro quest too late ?
---
I've lost items out of my stash over the past couple weeks. Couple weapons, armors, and magazine/bobbleheads. Nothing game changing but still gone.
---
I‚Äôd recommend checking at nukedragon and creating a build on there. 
---
Strength - 15
---
Max incisor
---
Max martial artist
---
Max barbarian
---
And 2 points to each perk related to your melee weapon (unarmed, 1h, or 2h)
---
Endurance- 7
---
Max adamantium 
---
Max life giver or ironclad (build dependent +2 sp pts) 
---
Radicool
---
Intelligence- 5
---
Max makeshift warrior
---
Agility- 12
---
Max action boy
---
Max marathoner
---
Max adrenaline 
---
Max dodgy
---
Luck- 11
---
Max starched jeans
---
Max class freak
---
Max serendipity
---
Max bloodied mess
---
This leaves 3-5 points to play with. I‚Äôd recommend beard rage party boy
---
They already announced a prestige system coming in summer so this idea will not happen.
---
Yes I know what they do. But you're dying a pve build not a caps/material saving build.
---
Exactly
---
Yo, no
---
I'm definitely going to give your suggestions a good test and see if they improve things for me, the tearing only seems noticeable when my character is close to doors and walls and panning so not too bad, but it would be nice not to have that happen.
---
Not tried the "Fast" Vsync setting so that will be interesting to test out, I do use edits in the Fallout76Custom.ini so I'm used to changing things there. A nice improvement for my lowly GPU was turning off grass in the ini, makes Whitespring go from a hideous sick inducing slide show to something quite reasonable. The grass there is so over the top in my opinion, a bonus is I can see so many more golf balls to snag for my shotgun shell plastic, hidden in the grass before.
---
Thanks for the suggestions :)
---
Use your imagination u have a giant sandbox at your disposal.. the best adventures are the ones u create
---
There's other subs around that specialize in bartering. Not sure of the rules. So I'll leave the rest to you.
---
Legendary if so 3 star ?
---
because they want you to go to the burrows
---
But junk is plentiful anyway.. and what do you need all those caps for? The only thing I spend caps on is fast travelling.. 
---
And it‚Äôs not even like I had a lot of junk.. 
---
I get PvPing for the thrill of the hunt, whatever you want to call it, I enjoy PvP mode too, but this just seems pointless.
---
I've seen three certain kinds Sheepsquatches over the weekend. I don't want to spoil it for anyone but will give more info if I need to. I got a Two Shot Explosive Double Barrel from the burrows but died quite a bit. I think I went from 66 to 76, roughly 10 levels. It made each kill feel so gratifying the double XP. However I found the observatory and that's one of the biggest challenges of the game.
---
I added shocking and plaguewalker to my unstable isotope ... had much regerts and took a gamble and jumped into the shower for a sec and locked out ... no more plaugewalker
---
You might be able to get away with just swapping weapons; this happens so frequently with speed demon that after every load screen or entry into power armor I do a quick weapon swap to make sure my reload speed is correct.
---
Not really. Some PC players might be found from the forum.
---
I thought they were going to introduce a way to Prestige all the level 50+ players in an upcoming content update and give us something to incentivize us to keep grinding since weapon leveling stops at 45/50.
---
I mean I'm fine with something like this too, but it splits the player pool in half needlessly.  I like getting assists from randos at high levels sometimes.  I would much prefer to have some method of prestiging my character, keep me in the same map and let it go at that.  My wife worries about running into high level players because they spawn higher level enemies, but honestly, I'm at the point (lvl 71 now) where I will only run into the occasional 80, but I know I'm approaching a ceiling and won't have any problems since I've yet to see enemies over 80.
---
Nope, unfortunately not, best we can do is travel to them, hope they have voice chat on and say good work, providing they dont run away
---
Isn‚Äôt this game for over 18s?
---
Can't I do both? What is wrong with that? I don't want to just waste materials and caps for no reason
---
I got a lot in int for stims/rads him I have 5 or 6 lvls saved up I'll head over and look
---
It's not available anywhere. Anyone that does have this used "cheat codes"
---
The did. There was a keyword added that disabled the ability for legendaries to spawn.
---
I probably killed 5 sheepsquatch solo over the weekend. I went up against two at the same time, while playing solo (I still kicked their butts). Also, I helped kill another 10 or so while playing with others during the Free Range event.
---
I try to carry a missile launcher with targeting computer,  I often use it to aggro SB's that are out of rifle range, I also use it to take out the cargo vertibots.
---
You engaged in pvp when you took the workshop
---
That‚Äôs what I thought, but doing so violates the subreddit rules.
---
Sounds like you need a squad.
---
I've had instances of glitchy flux at whitespring and Harper's Ferry, it's just the nature of the game at this point
---
I hate that I probably won't be able to pick up others' discarded legendaries. I've only earned a couple pieces of my armor and almost none of my weapons from enemies. I've picked up the rest from vendor bots. The flipside of that is now I will maybe have a use for a 3 star pipe or some other crap junkie\\nocturnal\\mutant slayer weak melee weapon I get. Last night I got 3 legendary boards in a row. I was not amused. Nothing worse than taking down a sheepsquatch and getting a cloaking wood arm that you just drop on the ground in frustration. Maybe now there will be something I can do with it.
---
Oh boy... What did that do?
---
My thin is, surely, they'd have a workaround.
---
Say, its an event like that, your turrets kill someone, if they seek revenge or whatever, your CAMP is now destructible.
---
Same as if your on pacifist, and you kill someone thst leaves you open to their retribution.
---
Indestructible CAMPS isnt a bad idea, it depends on how they handle the aspects of it. How they balance it. 
---
Most people i see don't hsve bounties, if they dont fire back, or kill the greifer, they've nothing to worry about
---
Its mostly about control.
---
Granted they'll be a few mishaps here and there. But i don't beleive a CAMP thats indestructible is a bad idea
---
You asked for suggestions. There it is.
---
the damage stacks up to 6 times, no farther then that. 
---
rank 1 is 6% while rank 5 is 10%, each kill resets the 30 second timer
---
I can confirm the blood washed skin works on the combat helmet
---
Inadvertent honestly! I usually don‚Äôt use the shotgun but now I may switch once the queen is killed.
---
You just said they were a waste, you haven't suggested what to put the points in instead or anything
---
ENB works fine to bring the light levels down
---
Nope, I took a workshop which turned on PvP, and I would have been happy to defend it had I not been in the Workshop menu trying to put down a resource collector. But you do you, dude. Enjoy.
---
Weird flex but ok
---
&gt; 3. Any game with rpg elements has respec option, and its rarely so slow to achieve.
---
Again, this part is absolutely untrue. I gave you an example, but many action rpg's do not have respecs. Ark has massive rpg elements and doesn't have a respec. It's level system is quite similar to fo76, you level up, you unlock perks, but there is never any respec, or at least there wasn't when I played.
---
You say that like you think it's an argument to my post.
---
You wanna do pve. Start putting points into damage.
---
Maybe go on a SBQ Slay tonight to improve my characters mood
---
Has it really been 5 months?
---
He didnt stick to the script...  
---
YOU SHOULDNT HAVE COME HERE!  
---
HIDING! LIKE A LITTLE BITCH
---
if you wanna be a raider you gotta stick to the script.
---
Lol dont let me tell you the story of my psycho murdering second character Dr Carla, they should have never let her enter vault 76... she is bat shit crazy with a BE Handmade
---
There is a difference in having a Bad language because you play it and pretend and someone going after you and starts insulting YOU, not your character.
---
Yesterday I server hopped atleast 15 times and spent too much fast travelling. Today I decided only to server hop and focus on the monument statue near the gold course. Within 3 hops I got it.
---
Drop em
---
They are all over the place, not sure if in low level areas, I don‚Äôt really going there anymore, but in high lvl areas, while exploring I found them every 10mins now. I don‚Äôt fast travel much and always when I hear some fighting near, going to check it out. Most of the time is sheepsqach attacking mobs. First I kill everything else to get adrenaline up and after sheepsqach. It is bit bulletproof, still easy fight, they don‚Äôt do much damage.
---
 Turning on and engaging are really the same thing. But whatever.
---
Most of the people doing stuff like that are the ones who have already lvl up multiple times and done everything. They are the people who just wanna lvl up multiple characters ot redo builds. Besides what's it matter as long as isn't hurting my gameplay why do I care how theirs is.
---
That pretty much sums up the only locations I go to
---
29 to 55 lol literally just farmed never ending glowing ghoul spawns in WS for a few hours, just glad i can use my gear i brought over from my jacked up build
---
Lmao
---
I think whether or not a weapon is drawn affects sneaking
---
For example if two players have their weapons holstered and sneak, they‚Äôre ‚Äúhidden‚Äù even in plain sight of eachother 3 feet away but if one of them has their weapon drawn they‚Äôre automatically flagged as hostile and thus each player‚Äôs detection title from the same scenario would become ‚Äúdanger‚Äù, I think it has to do with a visual cone and radius more than equipment weight but chameleon mutation/armor does change the field a bit
---
Aren't they adding prestige?
---
Could we get some more pics of those gorgeous dormers.... maybe from the verandah.
---
First was taken 7th December, the second today. So it's closer to 4 months 3 weeks, to tell the truth. 
---
The game as a whole has been out 5 and a half though!
---
I'm really interested in how they are going to pull this off. Each theory I come up with seems to have major flaws.  Lol!
---
I agree though that it can't be too easy to craft epic legendaries. There has to be some grind to it or eventually you would have the best everything and nothing left to do.
---
Bethesda definetly needs to continue to add new enemies and challenges to the game. When they unveiled the imposter SheepSquatch the troubleshooters stuff was suddenly relevant. I have a buddy who found a whole mismatched set and said the event was cake.  Heck I found a troubleshooters lever action I used exclusively to farm Watoga bots. I like that all the equipment could potentially have a use. This makes the game ever evolving.
---
Try either of the monuments, server hope. Lol see what i did there?
---
While I agree let‚Äôs be honest it‚Äôs a sad excuse for not having NPC‚Äôs. There are 3 other vaults around the map plus all the holotapes around the world show actual humans came to Appalachia &amp; died (like the BoS) so it‚Äôs not like humans can‚Äôt come into the area without contracting the scorched virus. I think with that final roadmap DLC we‚Äôll get at least one human living npc as it shows the Vault Dweller skipping with what looks to be another Vault dweller although a lot of people think it‚Äôll be the overseer which explains why there‚Äôs no possibly way to finish her main quest line because it‚Äôs unfinished still
---
I sincerely hope they continue at least one double XP weekend a month! No level cap makes hitting those higher levels a pain in the ass!
---
Killed two sheepsquatches around the south central side of the map. Great new enemy in my opinion.
---
Lol, and you know, when the little fake computer AI dies it‚Äôs just gone and you move on in the little fake computer world. 
---
In 76 when a ‚ÄúRaider‚Äù comes up and starts yelling at me it‚Äôs a different story.
---
My wife can confirm. 5 months going on eternity as far as she‚Äôs concerned
---
There are challenges to earn atom points, one is getting infected with all the deseases
---

---
First off, you're totally ignoring what the fuck I said... just to be an ass I guess?
---
&gt; I admit most games these days do allow for respeccing if they have a serious time sink to build the character, but not always.
---
Yeah pick and choose the ones that do, I said the whole genre and PoE only gives out respecs during major patches and that's not typically mid season, so you're absolutely wrong. If Bethesda ever gave any respecs based on PoE's way of doing things, they maybe could have justified one when they did all the perk changes, most notably to explosive. **However** the reason they did not is because they already do offer a slow respec option and PoE does not. If bethesda fucks up your character you have recourse in FO76 and you do not in PoE. That is the main difference.
---
Another example of limited respeccing in hack and slash/looter games, Grim Dawn. You can respec your skills, but you can't respec your stats. This is why I didn't give out specific examples, because you can name options that do it and I can counter name options that don't and we can go back and forth all day, but the fact remains that there are games in the genre that don't allow respeccing and or only allow limited respeccing. So at no point am I wrong, unlike you.
---
Hah I've done this.  Snuck into a base, looted it of it's hundreds of supplies. Fat walked out to a vendor. Sold what I could dumped the rest. Fast traveled back to base.....nothing g in my stash.....
---
Last time we beat it w 3 ppl.  Also the place the nuke was launched made it so we were fighting outside the nuke zone!  So I could use my fucking amazing MEAT HOOK OF DOOM!!!
---
I got it as bg as i could and i get maybe 100 xtra rounds
---
This was cool and good for me, considering I play on the weekend, it was nice to level up about 10 times in 2 days just fucking around for the most part.
---
The what? Oh no....
---
I fought a Legendary Noxious Squatch at NAR yard who was slaughtering the Mole Miners there
---
Full auto with drum. I just unmodded it quite a bit
---
Wish there was a hidden Dr Strangelove Easter egg where you can ride the nuke from launch to impact. Would be fantastic fun.
---
I don't know what the deal was we pounded away and her life wasn't going down. It has to be a bug.
---
I just use the advanced ones. And i play plenty of survival
---
You need a broken camera to craft a working one, so no...
---
I missed it. Also got my butt handed to me when I at level 60 with 4 others attempted to take on the sheepsquatch. Now I‚Äôve lost the recall card so either have to buy another or team up with someone doing the quest.
---
How the fuck do you not have ballistic fiber, that shit is easy to find. If you have trouble finding ballistic fiber you might want to find a different game to play
---
Saw a legendary Mr. Gutsy three star in Watoga last night and killed it so I know they can still spawn there despite everyone claiming otherwise.
---
Great site! Only suggestion is add an 'Updated On 29/4/19' or a date range like '29/4/19-5/5/19'
---
Reset days are when sites like yours are the most useful! Thanks for everything you do!
---
All 3 were Legendary  I only got 1* drops though
---
Thank you for doing what you do.
---
I'd keep the Excavator, mine is the workhorse, easy to repair etc., carry weight is better. My X-01 is a trailer queen lol I only bring it out on special occasions :) I'm working on getting the Ultracite tonight actually, keep the Excavator..
---
True. Why fix something that we get currency that circumvents spending money for?
---
I run rank 3 gunsmith with rank 5 demo expert
---
Yeah. I‚Äôve gone there just to get them occasionally.  
---
I‚Äôm hoping they‚Äôll be placeable items in CAMPs at some point. Need me some pie.
---
Dont pick them up and if one find their way to my inventory I instantly drop them
---
Seems like a real issue since the last patch! Today I lost my main weapon, when I dropped some spoiled food and ammo!! I just discovered it because I checked the paperbag.. and I know for sure that I didn't went to the weapons while dropping the junk
---
The plan?
---
Great question. I've never seen plans but my understanding is they are in game. Saving post, will follow. GL
---
yes sorry
---
In my experience I don't get xp or loot from creeps killed. Unless you tag it I guess?
---
There's more events that reward the plan. It's probably one of the first plans I ever got. 
---
https://fallout.gamepedia.com/Plan:_Tomahawk
---
That's all I had, sorry.
---
I do a lot of pvp in survival and Ive had people literally almost walk into me while my weapons drawn and they don't see me so I'm not so sure about that personally. I've heard that before tho too, not sure if it's because of my armor. I have a chameleon and other armor that helps sneaking.
---
Why do people want the plan so bad? I learned it before it was hype and it‚Äôs trash.
---
It seemed like these had dried up a few weeks ago... was it just rng or have you noticed an uptick again?
---
No problem at all - you have inspired me to add some to my current CAMP
---
I hope next time it isn't the same weekend as a massive movie release. I had a lot of fun but missed on hours of gameplay for Avengers Endgame
---
Meanwhile 2 lead ore weighs .2 lbs and you get 5 lead scrap from smelting that.. And i am guessing that those giant 100+ lbs weights u get from prison yard don't add up either..
---
That's great to hear, thank you.
---
Because Bethesda never figured out if a 1lbs of lead is heavier than a 1lbs of feathers.
---
In the fake computer world, yes.
---
A lot of people get protective and fast travel to their camps if I stick around for a bit.  
---
Nice camps get a bag of whatever plans I have on me, and a thumbs up.  
---
That‚Äôs the best I can think to do.
---
So are you saying you have two mutations at the same time?
---
I don't give a fuck about the bad language. It was his disposition towards me.
---
I noticed the other day that you can now pick up the weights in the courtyard of the Prison.. not sure what patch they brought that in with but there‚Äôs a lot of lead there!
---
I have a melee weapon with limb damage, a shotgun with limb damage, twisted muscles. I carry an endangerol syringer. Sometimes a cryolator. 
---
I go down there with options. Chainsaws and buzz blades. Bloody explosive guns. Bloody limb damage weapons. Pumpkin grenades. tick blood tequila. Whatever.
---
They're awesome for leveling. They do a good amount of dmg for beginning of game. Idk I use quills because they're fun
---
But leads heaver than feathers
---
Yeah those prison ones are new aren‚Äôt they? You never could pick them up before?
---
Such wankers playing the game the way it's designed how dare they.
---
The whole game is the same boring bs at this point. At least Watoga gave me something to do.
---
Time to play something else
---
&gt;Raiders cut people's heads off and put them on pikes.
---
I actually got my conclusion from those ‚Äòlucky servers‚Äô because they provide a large data pool in short periods. Most three star creatures only drop one star rolling pins and tire irons now. They did drop those in the past but it was a mixture of one two and three star items including range weapons and armors, now it‚Äôs mostly garbage melee stuff. One-star creatures on those lucky servers are about the same as before, a mix of everything. Only the three star spawns are heavily nerfed. Just killed a SQB an hour ago, got a wood leg armor piece. Killed four legendary gutsys at robco events, all one star wood leather and melee stuff. It‚Äôs not an accident.
---
I got it at Whitesprings, about 10-15 server hops... good luck..! üëçüèª
---
There's no definitive end yet, overseer's questline will supposedly get more entries with future updates.  Once you've gotten all her journals, killed the SBQ, done the Brotherhood and Enclave questlines to completion, there really isn't anything else besides dailies, weeklies, and misc challenges in terms of built-in goals.  Time to start making up your own reasons to keep playing like specific character builds and whatnot.
---
This is a little off topic, and kind of a newbie question, but how do you have so many sets of PA? When I tried in the past to equip armor pieces on different chassis for storage, it would only ever deploy my main one.
---
Lol It's kind of driven up the price of aluminum lately, not exactly game breaking.
---
Who would want to watch a stream of someone shooting vertibots over and over?
---
Explosive pairs well. You get the weight reduction from right to bear arms and explosive damage is in intelligence. It needs a big buff though, I have an AA auto grenade launcher that I break out occasionally for big mobs but it's really not great against higher level enemies.
---
It‚Äôs not as if legendary enemies drop good weapons at any significant rate, anyway. Like... so what if I can mindlessly kill an extra 3* legendary robot now and then? I‚Äôm still going to get a 1* wooden right leg 75% of the time.
---
I sell them for 10c a piece
---
Yesterday I'd just started looting a Gulper I killed and it disappeared before I got everything. Sure enough, after searching around a bit, I noticed it was now hanging from the tree it originally spawned in, too far up to reach. Seems like dead enemies are occasionally getting reset to their original location prematurely.
---
I didn‚Äôt ignore it, I had no idea it exists. That‚Äôs why I said it doesn‚Äôt make sense to me. I only knew if displayed numbers, which clearly makes some PA better than others.
---
Same, that's also supposing that you're lucky enough to land a hit...
---
If only they would actually put all their changes in the patch notes instead of purposefully leaving out nerds EVERY SINGLE TIME. Then it wouldn‚Äôt be a distrustful guessing game.
---
Can‚Äôt have unyielding and assassin on the same armor, try again.
---
Deliver gifts to lower level players at their camps. make them think they are gonna get griefed by letting them see my higher level. then proceed to drop them plans for stuff they more then likely will not find until much later
---
Did you ever figure this out? I know I used to have spotlights set up behind vault boy cardboard cutouts to make shadows on the ground, and it worked great. Now, they don't seen to cast any at all.
---
I agree with you, I've noticed since its inception that melee is what the game is pushing towards. Hell, my first couple levels out of thr vault were most melee perk cards. Im a shooter, always have, but the melee system isn't right at all.
---
If your CAMP turrets kill something (without you tagging it) you don't get XP, but you do get to loot the bodies.
---
\- Shotguns (explosive ones) with the right mods do pretty good damage even at mid-range. A TSE Combat shotgun can fire \~10 times per magazine, its quick too, and if you target the ground below or at the legs of an enemy, the explosions reflect off the ground beneath them giving some major splash damage. Its great for killing glowing ghouls in nuke zones or even just crippling their legs so they can't melee you.
---
\- I didn't think Tormentor needed VATS, but its probably down to the accuracy you get in VATS rather than free aiming, that makes it not viable without VATS. Still if you have an explosive rifle, could the explosions themselves stagger other players?
---
Yes, it goes on and on my friends.
---
They will be op af since everyone runs mutation and itll probably be a situation like the 2 shot explosive wave
---
Well yeah, installing game in default location silved the problem
---
You'd think people would have figured it out, but meh.
---
And, move your base there. Don't build anything, just put your CAMP there so noone else can drop a blueprint of their missile-o-rama there after the nuke falls.
---
The second part of what you said is not quite true- they all originated from cheats, but a lot of people traded for them after they were "discovered" and before it was widely known that they came from a dev cell, and scrapped them to learn the plan.  So a lot of non-cheaters ended up basically getting scammed, and can now make them.
---
Possibly but as it is that mod is pretty useless lol
---
game key 15 bucks max
---
Maybe you and I should start a support group for hoarders
---
Just eat all the spoiled stuff and avoid the accidental drops!
---
Just drop the nuke a little further back so it blows the camp up too
---
I went from level 37 to 50.  Did a bunch of firsts for me:
---
*killed a scorchbeast (with the help of guards at Whitesprings gate)
---
*killed a Sheepsquatch
---
*killed Level 20 Mirelurk Queen (which was much harder then a level 20 should be.)
---
*Got my first legendary wooden armor
---
*Got my first drill 
---
It's much more fun playing when you can level up faster.  Started to feel like my character was a little more powerful
---
If you frequent the trading subs, you would have seen plans for them available recently, but they sell for 8k+ caps.
---
Are you serious? The loser things to do is expect immunity until you are "ready" in a specific PVP zone... Hold on, hold on I'm not ready yet üòÇ
---
Wish I could remember this one clearly. 
---
If you uncheck all of your quests but this one and then click the R2 button (PS4) does any location show up?
---
Not sure what country you are from, but where I am at, (America) your first amendment protections, like most others, do not trump the rights of the owner when present on, or using, their property.
---
The least I could do after seeing such an atypical camp was take the time to give it an atypical rating.
---
I *think* there's a bunker that has the missing part you need.
---
Most of everything you see online is is the vocal minority lol
---
My bunny played fo4 and did assaults, I went melee.  His reaction to me running up to and 2 hitting a deathclaw with a heated, super sledge was great.
---
If you have the spare points I‚Äôd max them both out, if you don‚Äôt and you find yourself running into Durability issues. Swap em and go Gunsmith 5 Demo 3.  I heard a rumor that explosive weapons ruin durability faster but can‚Äôt confirm it.
---
It was designed to be one. A game that use players‚Äô assets as incentive to promote pvp is essentially promoting virtual murder and robbery. Just let it die already.
---
Ahh, I really don't want to have to do that, but I'll try a scan and repair first. Thanks!
---
So that's why I had double XP. It didn't say anywhere and I didn't want to question it in case it was a bug. I think that we level up too slowly in the game as normal. If I 'd known what was going on I might've tried to speed level a new character.
---
The lighthouse by Vault 76?
---
Ssd huh?
---
Oh, sorry m8
---
AA doesn't work with the AGL or any explosive weapon (or energy weapon) since AA only works on DR and explosives work on a different resist stat. I have a TS AGL and it really only works against hordes of weaker enemies. I use it to clear the club house when I'm server hopping that and that's about all its good for.
---
Man, I noticed they fucked up the lighting, but you can really tell how bad they fucked up in your screenshots. Can they do anything in this game without breaking it? At this rate, it may literally never be properly playable or finished.
---
I got about 3900 rounds i can throw you if you want. Just add CallmeGimli and invite me to a party next time you see me on.
---
Do not underestimate Blocker in the STR 'tree' if you are going the 'in your face' route rather than stealth.
---
Personally I enjoy more the latter flavour (Unyielding+Bloodied+Stealth) but both can be fun.
---
Is the grenade thing because it'll crash the server?
---
If he hasn‚Äôt explored the bog yet, fiber is difficult to come by. The only reliable place I found it was fort McCoy and everyone was cleaning that place out. If he‚Äôs low lever without the right perks, easy to burn through what you can find in a day
---
Actually it should be luck 34.
---
I recall the formula being (Luck x 1.5) + 5. So a luck 1 adds 6.5 to critical meter per shot and 15 adds 27.5 per shot.
---
With C. Savy 3, you need 55, which is two shots at luck 15.
---
At luck 34, each shot is 56, so you still need C. Savy 3.
---
I'm not sure how the 15% faster legendary effects works. Do I get a flat +15 to each shot, or I get 15% of my per shot, but I'm intrigued.
---
Anyone using explosive bait to try to entice her to land?
---
Can confirm this. I don't use flamers so would toss the literally tons of fuel you can get. It was a good source of aluminum (not so much for XP, but it wasn't a good source of XP back when the bug was larger either)
---
Everything is on NVME, just the boot/OS drive is only 512GB, while the drive I have the game on is larger and where I keep all my games.
---
I have him right now. GT is same as username
---
Even when people play the objective in Free Range I've had plenty of instances where the brahmin just get swarmed by whatever mob spawns directly on top of them and before we get shots off they're at half health. Its basically RNG if you'll have a good or bad time in that event.
---
no sir I don't like it, It would be better to have more variants of the existing armors instead of creating quirky PA, perhaps in the future expansion we might even see the Enclave's APA in full glory, and like Fallout 4 did, more revisions of armors, such T-51C, D, E...
---
I can't imagine using needing needing the glowing card, my shitty AA gatling can tear up glowing ones in a few shots a piece, I can only imagine I'd be 1 shotting them if I used that card let alone if I had a TSE gatling. Then again I usually run with a group and we have to actively try to get everyone a tag before the enemy dies and it can be a chore.
---
Well i have 240gb and theres still plenty of space for games, maybe you should move some stuff at least to see if it helps to have it in default location
---
Bethesda this you need to look at
---
I‚Äôm not entirely sure about this but I‚Äôm noticing a lot less bobbing with T-60 over Excavator.
---
Yeah, up on the railing is one of the spawns
---
Darker nights - if you've watched got the past 3 days, you'll realize you dont actually want darker nights :/
---
That and they are sparse as fuck when it comes to exploring.
---
I forgot about how hard it is to get decent suits of normal armor - its definitely something you have to build up into.  I do like power armor too but unfortunately it gets outclassed unless you need rad protection most times because good legendary armor just has all that sweet effects!
---
You the man. Looks like I'm in for another 2 hours of server hopping!
---
Its made me feel less naked
---
I love darker nights
---
While we're at it can we add sights to the Heavy Guns that lack them? Also the 10mm SMG lacks a male aperture or any other sighting options.
---
There's no seek revenge in survival?, I was pretty sure there is.
---
I'll have to give it a shot. Don't suppose you can try something like [this](https://i.imgur.com/tg439q7.jpg) and see if the cutouts throw any shadows? I know mine used to, maybe they changed CAMP objects to no longer interact with player lights?
---
Are you sure it's not in your inventory? I've run into a problem where it replaces it on the wheel but I still have it.
---
As someone else mentioned, you can look at the turrets to see who owns the CAMP ... but you can also simply look at the CAMP device itself, if they don't have any turrets.  Both display the name of the CAMP owner.
---
Not being at full life, the mongrel breaks a leg and triggers that dumb head swaying animation, then I have to reload my weapon. It can attack 3-4 times during each of those sequences. 
---
Also I used to have scortchbeasts spawn around my camp pretty often so they'd kill me as well.
---
No clue but that‚Äôs the Enclave bunker buddy
---
You are correct.
---
There was one just south of Camp Venture, right underneath a big long distance power line pylon. 3*, was also sleeping next to Brahmin.
---
Was the first one I have come across, I'm liking some of its special moves. The shooting of needles, super annoying, super awesome at the same time.
---
Well i dont have the game installed rn and also its 1am in my timezone so im sorry buddy
---
You‚Äôre lucky! Truly great Camps like this are so rare
---
Tens of hundreds...you mean thousands?
---
I had multiple turrets set up. But this ridiculous mongrel decides to go THROUGH the walls of my house rather than around my house to get me . So I found it in a random corner inside where the turrets couldn't see.
---
And having turrets inside my house would totally kill the vibe...
---
Everytime this event pops up I'm not sure if I should bother or not, past 5 times I've done it I've gotten lousy legendary's. That's if I can even find the body to retrieve them, and nothing but a white fedora. 
---
How many damn times do I have to do this event to get something other than a white fedora, it's frustrating as hell.
---
Yeah I know, eh?  Just like those wankers who whined and complained about Scorchbeasts shrieking too much, or not landing enough, or complaining that the game doesn't play itself anymore...   \*rolls eyes\*  The way the workshops are designed right now is STUPID and should be changed.
---
I was in this fight. At some times they were respawning on each other's corpses.  I killed both of them in rapid sequence 2x  and one respawned then the other.  We searched the area, there was no 3rd 'charisma' character.  Regardless, respawning on teammates is intermittent at best.  People respawning on a teammates dead body has been happening.
---
All good man, thanks anyway.
---
Id like one like the cultist outfit
---
Do we need more pvp based legendaries. I though the assassins instigating covered that lol
---
I could ghostwrite an apology to Bethesda for you for being naughty.
---
We had double XP
---
I don't disagree that the workshop design is stupid. Call people wankers who use it is infinitely more stupid though.
---
Tried killing a sheepsquatch at level 23... high levels came by but didn‚Äôt have a damn clue on what to do.
---
I missed it too. I wanted to get to level 100 so badly =\
---
I annihilated one with 10 orbital strike beacons the other day.
---
I'm not home yet will you be there still in about 34-40 min
---
Oddly I prefer to level up a character until I can get their full build that I planned out between 60-75, then I try to make a new character with a different build for a different kind of playing experience. I could just keep leveling a main and respec it but that just doesn't seem as fun to me for some odd reason.
---
The double xp weekend really helped with that so I could get a new character to 20 with the short time I had available.
---
Well put! When you put it like that it makes alot more sense. But then again the whole controversy is from the fact that you can buy atoms for real world money. I like earning atoms and sometimes it's really hard to save up because I play casually and then they have some cool stuff for sale.
---
Could be a thirteen years old with a drunk mother, as you go through life there will be a lot of times you don't agree with people and what they do, don't let it bother you so bad
---
Considering it was fairly obvious sarcasm, I am not deeply concerned about not naming the right meta combo. But thanks for the information.
---
Idk but every time I get a mutants slayer item I sell it for dirt cheap or toss it at a vendor cuz noone wants that crap lol
---
Disappearing?) Today I had two exploding after death legendary ghouls just as robots do. Wtf)
---
The spawns are frustrating, and swarm of duped items out there (a full PVP set still runs like 200$, not including the ones being traded back and forth in the markets) does make it frustrating, but as long as they are hacking they can be taken down.  As Jive said, the right build, with the right 1 star legendary, can drop those rabbit jumping as combat skills pay2win tools.  
---
But the spawn mechanics allow them to grief people. Thats stupid.  They may as well just unlock all spawn points so solo players aren't disadvantaged.
---
I think I remember reading that it only let's you spawn at the last place you physically visited. Which could potentially be very far away. 
---
Say you fast travel back to your camp from across the map and your buffout wares off and you're over encumbered and you die somehow. You just kinda got fucked while following the rules of the game.
---
Welcome to 76 in general, enjoy your stay.
---
To the north of whitesprings is a mountain range. There are a few resource nodes in that area, and it generally does not get hit when people nuke the area.
---
Yes, and the launch can kill you as well.
---
We're aware of this, and we think its broken. Spawning on a corpse can't be intended when bethesda stated after dying it would be your camp, V76, or a teammate.  I'd argue a teammate in the area should be locked out so it doesn't turn into a forever battle.
---
As a man with patchy facial fair... I can't use beard rage. Lol.
---
I have makeshift warrior but only use it when crafting. I quit using any perks that stop degrading weapons. Materials are just to plentiful, so I just repair a lot.
---
Is there any other benefit to running makeshift warrior full time?
---
Well I‚Äôve been playing off and on for 900 hours killing super mutants left and right and know virtually no laser mods. So I‚Äôd like to know your secret.
---
It unfortunately doesn't have a page on Fallout 76, but imfdb(dot)org is my go-to site for weapons featured in video games or movies.
---
First time I've heard you could do that
---
Nocturnal and stalkers are the real trash ones there lol
---
Weird....  I took the elevator to the roof, walked to the edge, looked down with my camera in-hand, and took a picture.  My challenge updated right away.  Had no issues like this.
---
I must be lucky, found mine first spawn @ colonel Kelly monument at the top of the wooden stairs there a guy laying on a bench, so far i have found like 10 on ghouls and other beasts
---
This is the first time I've seen it too lmao
---
Intriguing question, look forward to the answers
---
I disagree on armor repair perk if you're going pure sniper. The idea is for things to die at long range, so armor will not get damaged frequently (never mind if the perk is actually working/worth it nowadays).
---
Short answer is no... but if you have the time, read this previous post in which smarter people than me explain it....
---
Specifically towards the end it has a small table indicating anti armor + incisor etc instead of =100% ... highest it ever reaches is 88%.
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/bhvz9d/guide_indepth_weapon_legendary_effect_mechanics/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share
---
Is stalker that bad? Idk I dont pvp much lol I'd figure it was good with a vats build but again not a pvp guy so idk
---
This was my situation. Thank you for clarifying.
---
Same happens to me usually when there are a few of them
---
My buddies are the same way when I run into crowds and start hammering away. It's fun. I can one shot a Max level glowing deathclaw with all my perks. But it sucks with enemies that have guns cause you take so much damage having to be I'm the middle of everything. So it's a fair trade off.
---
Not sure but I've ran across the same thing
---
  the sheepsquatch is really easy but yes the double xp weekend was amazing! I leveled up 20 times
---
My television is incredibly dark in this game only, and there's no slider to adjust it. If I'm outside at night it's pitch dark, even though the stars are out.
---
Plague Walker was making all animals take dmg including my own cow and chally the moo moo and causing agro so it had to go.
---
I tend to just use stimpacks, easy enough to craft, managed to buy the plans at White spring bunker
---
I don't think people wanted to carry 150lbs :D
---
i switch between 8 loadouts for unarmed/2handed shotguns/heavy weapons, and already have lvl 100+ char with pistol/explosive build
---
Oh yeah this game has been ridiculously skewed toward melee since the beta.   It improved somewhat after they gave a damage boost to heavy weapons and slowed their breakage with one of the patches. 
---
But it still feels out of whack.
---
I grew up in the woods where there wasn't any light pollution, and I don't remember it ever being as dark as this game is every single night. They really need to add the slider back
---
On the Excavator, it's a weird, high pitched squeak that drives me nuts.
---
I don‚Äôt know, I prefer earning it
---
Excuse me while I scream in the bathroom
---
its dumb cause u can goto monorail elevator. grab 200 pounds of lead weight and get 20 lead scrap.. or goto lucky hole mine grab 10lbs of lead ore and get 200 lead scrap or something (rough estimate)
---
So true. In beta  I had to mess with my TV brightness settings to see more than 5 feet. If lights are brighter now I would not mind going back to dark nights though.
---
Nope it's random, I've had my respawn be somewhere I've not visited this week!
---
Post a link with the exact build you use?
---
Enemies kind of stop leveling to your player around 120 but most have level caps much lower like 68 for super mutants, 80 SBs, 91 for deathclaws. Enemies levels are also capped for most areas except for parts of SD and all of the mire and bog. The higher your level the more likely a maxed variant will spawn, enemy weapons get better, and for some things respawn timers are quicker. From experience around level 210+ super mutants start all packing miniguns which kinda makes them an actual threat.
---
Or take a power core producing workshop for about 15 minutes. I usually take it, power and lock it, drop some turrets for discouragement, and wander off. Come back later, take cores, log off server so someone else can have it next. Never actually had that workshop taken from me.
---
No you didn‚Äôt. It‚Äôs not available in game.
---
You‚Äôre doing lucky hole mine wrong. Excavator PA gets me around 2,250 lead scrap when the ore is smelted. (Average around 450 ore per run)
---
Maybe if your a long range super sniper build but one your detected then any bonus the effect gives you is lost. It‚Äôs kinda annoying as most mid to high level enemies have very high health so multiple hits are necessary. (With my build at least)
---
Satisfying as hell running into these on survival, super rare as whitesprings is a pvp hunting ground. The ability to destroy them and thier owners with no other provocation and continue hunting them with no repercussions just the best.
---
If you‚Äôre on pc I have a few thousand fuel I could sell you.
---
I only found 1 plan in the game that someone has been selling. Bought it immediately.
---
OP if you're on XBOX I'll craft them for like 2 caps a piece for ya
---
Man that stinks. Oh well, I mean it is still almost 90% armor penetration and against super mutants, scorched beasts, mirelurk queens, and other heavily armored enemies that can do a ton of damage. Thanks.
---
Less lol.
---
Miss the days of the deathclaw being the apex predator. New sheepsquatch is badass though.
---
Had a glowing Yao Guai attack after the Sheepsquatch showed up, so please, for the love of atom, everyone keep an eye out for things other than the sheepsquatch. Its like the wolves and bugs vs the sloth at fasnacht all over again.
---
If you‚Äôre on pc I have a few thousand fuel to sell.
---
Try it out.  I know with savvy 3 and 23 luck I can crit every other shot.  Might be easier than maintaining a full unyielding set
---
And again you resort to name calling. What a chump. 
---
Remember that pop up you agreed to when claiming the workshop? The fact that someone snuck up and killed you is your own fault, noone elses
---
You might want to post this on the fallout 76 market reddit, marketfo76. Someone there might have one
---
Best advise yet!!
---
Like I have to say all exploits are bad. I'm not saying that one is particular is game breaking g or OP but I need to have a firm stance against it. There is no grey for me, my dream is to have a game where no one will cheat or exploit but that's all it is a dream.
---
I seriously had a blast I want more! I almost wish this was just how it was. Loved being able to work towards a build . Went from a crap pistol build to full punching madman
---
I've updated the post with a video tour if you'd like to check that out!
---
I've uploaded a Video tour, feel free to check it out! Thanks for the suggestion.
---
Yes, the effects from the helmet mods and berry mentats can "bleed" into nearby players. It's pretty common when your running non-PA around PA users.
---
Awesome thank you so much! I will for sure check out!
---
It wasn't there when I launched it. Even if it was, it takes like 5 seconds to repair...
---
You are right and my calculations were way off.
---
Yep not what i expected either. However still worth a read, it has a complete section on anti armor. The way i understand it, even though it says 88% max anti armor,  it still increases dmg output. So somehow that extra dmg output ends up cutting through the remaining armor anyway. So comes up to around same if it had 100% armor penetration.
---
I‚Äôve got the plan? How much?
---
Ah I c ya that kinda sux
---
Is there anything in that event that would ever cover the cost of the 2k caps to make the recall card?
---
There 100% is not.
---
Source: I almost exclusively play Survival.
---
I totally agree I‚Äôd love to have several characters but I‚Äôm not able to put that amount of time in
---
About as far as you can throw a shell
---
2 feet ok
---
I've noticed that too
---
Don't know if any of this will apply to you, but I'll still tell you how I use the perk.
---
I'm a stealth sniper build, so most of the time, I usually don't get hit by many things. The only time I'll use a healing item is when I get caught in a tricky situation. With the perk, a Nuka Cherry is my go to; it restores my health and ap bar completely, meaning I can survive and get back into vats asap.
---
This, paired with the Healing Factor mutation, means that my Nuka Cola supply is relatively sustainable. I rarely have to go out to farm nuka cola, and when I do, I go to the Red Rocket Megastop.
---
Also, I can sell all of my excess healing items to other players, and I can use a bunch of my standard Nuka Colas to craft the Overdrive chem to buff my dmg/crit dmg. This setup, in my opinion, is very sustainable and profitable.
---
The other types of Nuka Colas (Grape, Orange, Wild, Quantum) are more of niche drinks with the perk. Nuka Cherry works just fine as an all-rounder.
---
What would be worth server hopping at West-Tek for? I‚Äôve done everything except launch and nuke and go to West-Tek it seems.
---
That's even worse! Getting fucked turns into a lottery that could fuck you a little bit more.
---
I'll spend 1000 caps for the neon letters. But no more.
---
That and a massive game release, I had a huge weekend
---
My 76 story:
---
I was hesitant like everyone else on launch day, given the bad reviews and complaints. My friends and were pretty excited until those reviews dropped. We all decided not to get it. Fast forward to day two and I broke down and got it on a whim. I couldn‚Äôt pass up on a fallout release, I‚Äôve played them all since fallout 3 at launch and for months after. I started it up and I was hooked. Mind you, this was while I was in the epilogue of RDR2, which was my most anticipated and most enjoyable single player experience ever. But as soon as I started 76, I actually never went back to wrap up the story in RDR. 
---
I played 76 in the early days, experiencing a lot of the broken mess many of us remember. When it worked, it was fun. I played solo and worked my way through the main quest, side quests, events, but mostly just explored wherever I wanted to go. It was the exploring that hooked me. There is literally stuff everywhere. Everywhere you look you‚Äôll find a scene set up in a way to make you wonder, ‚ÄúJesus, what went down here when the bombs fell!?‚Äù. There was so much to see, shoot, eat, build, learn, and collect that the time just flew by. 
---
Fast forward to the Fasnacht Parade event. Prior to this event I had been watching a lot of Jug‚Äôs videos on building and some others, and have been building bases very frequently. I had learned a lot of cool tricks to make my camp look unique. When the event started, I relocated my base to my first semi-permanent location, right by Helvetia (by the end of the parade so everyone could see). [I made it look like a store](https://youtu.be/RTYsTFUBzz4) with stocked shelves in the spirit of a thrift store. I had collected a lot of duplicate plans too and decided to sell them to people since some didn‚Äôt care to farm workshops. I posted on reddit some, but also just got a lot of foot traffic from the event. It was a huge success, I was selling and trading plans constantly. I wasn‚Äôt even doing it for the caps, just to see others piling into my shop and being friendly with one another, getting plans they‚Äôve been looking for and being excited about it. 
---
It was such a good time that I decided to keep doing the plan salesman thing for the foreseeable future. I messed around with some other locations after Helvetia and finally landed on the area right across from the Whitespring Station. The foot traffic is insane for a few reasons. Since I‚Äôve opened my shop there, it‚Äôs gotten almost non stop business. I made it pig shaped and flashy to draw people in and it definitely works. It was initially hard to keep up with customer demand, but I found some good grinds to get plans people wanted. Selling. Trading. Buying. Constantly. But once again, it‚Äôs just fun seeing the player interactions. 
---
One thing I‚Äôve wanted to do from the beginning was be the NPC that Bethesda didn‚Äôt give us. So I‚Äôve strongly stuck to my no mic policy. The emotes and messaging works well enough to get points across. It almost feels like a second life type game. I feel like I have a second job at times working that damn shop. And on paper, this wouldn‚Äôt be something I would find fun or want to play. But that‚Äôs the thing about 76, it‚Äôs way more than the sum of its parts. I‚Äôm now 750 or so hours in and don‚Äôt see myself stopping anytime soon. It‚Äôs not about the end game, the SBQ fights, TSE weapons, or any of that. It‚Äôs about just living in post nuclear Appalachia, being friendly with your neighbor, sharing resources, helping others along the way, making it fun and interesting for others adventuring. 
---
I have a million other things to say about it, but I‚Äôll end it here. Oh, one last thing, those friends I mentioned earlier... I bought them each a copy of the tricentennial edition because I found them cheap on amazon. We all got together for a game day and had a blast exploring Appalachia as low levels. Played about 6 hours non stop laughing and having fun the whole time. Goes to show sometimes you just gotta try it and form your own opinions.
---
Good luck bro
---
I wish that‚Äôs how it always was
---
.....
---
Then why even reply?
---
 To exhibit some sense of superiority?
---
This would be such a great container if it worked correctly, the worst is it sticks up out of the top and so out of the floor above.
---
Yeah and I think the speed demon negative effect of getting hungry and thirsty faster when moving should also be addressed.
---
Yeah - that was addressed in the original post.
---
Thanks for sharing, I suppose I should have mentioned my build is a hyper-mobile assassin, so I use lots of AP, and do take damage once I've engaged many enemies, so perhaps what's sustainable for you, may not be for me
---
I totally agree, this was a busy weekend
---
A helmet with damage resistances??? Lol
---
What perks are you using to get that kind of power?
---
I will be on the server, he is at the Water Park in the Toxic Area
---
I often encounter a few 3* legendaries while walking down the road that runs from the mire to Watoga.
---
2 people downvoted you so woooosh on them
---
Actually I thought so too. And that's how it seems to work a lot of time in my camp, if it gets attacked by something tiny the turrets can handle compeltely and I wont care to interrupt my crafting.
---
But sometimes for whatever reason, sometimes things completely killed by your turrets, are lootable. Haven't actually payed attention to XP.
---
I don't know why mostly they seem not to be lootable, yet sometime they are. I got no spike boards on my latest camp, its just turrets doing the damage.
---
Or one full week lol.
---
Well that's no fun is it üòâ
---
I mostly ask because I like the idea of niche builds, and healing without the animation + gaining back hopefully loads of AP is very appealing
---
I don‚Äôt see that going in your favour unless they‚Äôre just a low level trying to farm experience, and they‚Äôd probably have regular bullet turrets in that case.
---
He wasn‚Äôt thirteen I know that. He sounded in his 20‚Äôs. Could be late teens; hard to say. I‚Äôm actually more bothered by so many defending assholes on here. I wasn‚Äôt too bothered by him. I got away, blocked him, reported him. Honestly it‚Äôs been more disappointing hearing people say, effectively, as long as it‚Äôs online let them do whatever they want. 
---
That‚Äôs not true and it‚Äôs a symptom of a bigger problem.
---
I ended up biting the bullet and just clearing mutations until it went away, then reapplying the other ones I lost. It's a pain, but I have a few energy guns I use semi-regularly, especially in PvP, so can't have 'em at half damage.
---
People on PC have it... And have had it for months...
---
That's impractical. During that time frame, I would be missing out on resources [lead and purified water] that my C.A.M.P produces. 
---
Plus, also have to pay caps to move my C.A.M.P there, pay yo more it back, and use screws to re-lock my resources when I move it back...
---
Me too, maybe I'll take a pic Lol.. could be wrong but I'm def going to check again now
---
Honestly you should be able to convert fuel into fuel. But you actually have to convert it into oil and then convert back to fuel. Lol. 
---
Huge tanks of Mr. Handy fuel and other propane tanks, all are ignition fluids that can be used for a flame thrower. Sure some may not burn as hot, but it's fuel!
---
Yeah lol.
---
I first heard about it on instagram
---
Yipe!
---
I've found the plans once since I started so they're definitely one of the rarer ones, but do exist.
---
If you haven't done the Excevator quest yet, he has now broken it for you, as you cannot learn the recipe if you already own a set!
---
My artillery is by the creek under the land lighthouse. I make it just before Flatwoods. I hope that gives you an idea.
---
Well shit. The search for a better grenade launcher continues.
---
You really gotta go with a team preset with roles. The 10min timer on that isn't for pugs. Since it requires minor coordination, you should run with a team. If you plan to he the pylon person, let them know and you could probably pug it. But I have a character who is a bloodied build and can't pylon without being completely worthless and dying nearly immediately even in x01 armor and perks unless that's literally all I do. So I coordinate with friends on the friends list in a group chat and see who can bugger with this sheepsquatch.
---
West-tek is a great place to farm legendary muties... so long as nobody else runs in with a bloody melee build and one-shots everything.
---
lol, all I did was recommend an easy way to prevent them from placing their CAMP there. Personally I am constantly bulking and selling my steal and purified water just to keep my weight under the 800 stash / 255 carry limits.
---
PS4 logan2raw I'd love to spice up my camp with the sweet decorations
---
I'm on Xbox and if I get this, I'll be able to get a PA skin like my friends!
---
Probably SOL
---
Great advice, cheers

I'm only lvl 35 so far so haven't gone that far yet , but I read on a thread somewhere here a few days ago about it having a decent legendary spawn rate. Not sure if it's true but it was something about a good spawn rate for legendary mobs to farm.
---
What does SOL mean
---
Shit outa luck
---
Okay, so I noticed this too, was this another stealth nerf or did I just miss it in the patch notes? 
---
I understand that legendary weapons are supposed to be rare, but they are already bad drop rates as is. Especially from the end boss  (enter SBQ rant here).
---
That really sucks
---
For some reason I don‚Äôt think it will be enough of a buff, but I hope it will be.
---
I'm on ps4, I just want to get the vault tec bundle. I have a few saved up and it will give me enough to buy it atoms
---
Yep... also I'll actually be relieved when legendary vendor comes around and I can dump all these legendaries. The true stash purge.
---
Fully honesty, don't hold your breath. Count your losses and move on. Refunds for stuff like that are more non existent than rare. Maybe you'll have luck by submitting a ticket but I wouldn't guarantee it at all. Make a new character and grind atoms or something, that would probably be faster than you even getting a response :/ good luck, though
---
People still do this event? If you want another mutants wood armor or a furious rolling pin I'll give you one.
---
Its already balanced. Melee have to be in melee range. This also puts us in range of enemy melee which is much harder hitting than enemy ranged. Higher risk for higher reward.
---
Well some people have issues that's all I'm saying, hopefully he gets better Lol
---
Yes, I was really hoping to be able to add the glass walls to my CAMP. Part of the reason I use just the wood walls instead of the brick (which are much prettier) is the amount of light and airiness opening the shutters gives you.

XB1 A new power armor skin
---
I just noticed the washed out models after one of the past few updates. On the red stove and the stash desk. They both look awful now.
---
There's a few mutations where the "negative" effects aren't affected by negative effect suppressing spells. I think it's actually by design. Empath is one. Herd mentality is another.
---
Ok thanks, just a quick question how do you submit a ticket on Xbox (I know I sound stupid but I really don‚Äôt know)
---
I have a blueprint that is a base, ladder, floor and 3 missile turrents. Pop 1 or 2 od those with the perk that lowers build supplies by 50% and your golden. Take all the workshops.
---
I think I was married to her once.
---
Yeah, no worries and I appreciate the recommendation - but, it's something that Bethesda should patch because it ruins everyone's gameplay (not just mine)...
---
You named a non existent armor. There is no obvious sarcasm in text, tone implies sarcasm, there‚Äôs no tone to find here.
---
It does seem broken - I haven't actually timed it out in any rigorous way, but seem to constantly crave silt bean soup. Seems unnatural.
---
When was the last major content drop?
---
Yikes
---
Hopefully I get unbanned soon! :D Sounds really fun!
---
Xbox GT: verify sanity. I would get the horseman armor skin. I really wanted it but can‚Äôt afford it. It ends tomorrow morning. If the drawing is after that, give it to someone else who would benefit from it more!
---
[PS4] I want to get the Sheepsquatch plush and some signs!
---
The best I can remember was on one of the roofs, not in a greenhouse, but on one of those planting tables.  I was surprised I even spotted it.
---
Gotta go to Bethesda / fallout 76 support online.
---
I kill them and they fall into the ground. This happens a lot with my deathclaws at the substations. Happened to me with a 3* sheepsquatch at the end of free range event too.  Hurt my entire feeling.
---
I did it off each side, from on top of the elevator, and on top of the junk and none of them worked for me.
---
And there's no reason too avoid splurging if you find something you actually like! But when they introduce something that's useful rather than just cosmetic, and on top of that it costs less than going for your dailies.. it isn't inherently a bad thing.
---
Honestly, they could add more useful stuff and I would be happy. Like, I haven't played the game for over 3 months, and some friend of a friend just destroyed my whole base because I took something of his after some friendly PvP. I didn't, but now I would have to gather materials to repair my base, and frankly after playing less than 2 hours, and having someone's friends destroy my base- I have no interest in getting back on.
---
Now imagine they had a base repair kit, even if it simply filled in a few missing supplies to repair your base- getting griefed might not be so bad. Sure, it may suck if I had to spend 50 cents worth of atoms because someone wanted to be an asshole.. but that would have lessened the negative of the overall experience.
---
So yeah, useful things that don't give players an unfair advantage are welcome as far as I'm concerned. If they had considered a repair kit for your base I probably would have bought one, rather than turn my back on the game *again*.  Hell, I got 700 atoms for something I did shortly after logging in, and I didn't even notice what it was for..
---
But yeah, they've got more work to do to make players want to come back, more positive experiences to overcome the negative ones built into the game.
---
Xb1,GT- frizatronics. The new Warning sign set, Neon sign set, and Metal stairs. To upgrade my roadside diner.üòÅ
---
If you mainly deal with open combat, and don't sneak, I fear it may be hard to manage your Nuka Cola supply. You'll probably have to consistently farm for them. If you do continue with your Cola Nut build, then I'd try to trade with other players. From what I've experienced, people hold onto Nuka Colas as a habit, and then try to get rid of them. Essentially, free/cheap healing items up for grabs.
---
Joining now
---
hey am on ps4 Chronic\_Coit.
---
I'd love the atoms so i can buy some PA Skin :) really would like it.
---
Eh, honestly .50 on the Hunting Rifle is much better just for the fact that you can craft it much more easily than .308 or .45 ammo, and it's worth the slightly less damage it does imo, expecially on legendary rifles that are going to oneshot every NPC anyway.
---
With the odds in the hundreds of thousands to get a drop you want I really wish they would stop nerfing legendary spawns.
---

I really want the pink armor/princess bed. :)

---
Xbox here. Cheers. Like to grab some power armor paint systems.
---
Huh, guess I'm putting a toilet in my living room now.
---
Where is the legendary vendor? I haven't found it
---

---
Even if .45 ammo is relatively common, if you get a .50 receiver on an hunting rifle you have an huge advantage when it comes to crafting ammo at the cost of slightly lower damage per shot.
---
Would be a nice idea, but you have to bare in mind that, if you go on a server with only high level players, you increase the odds that one of the guys you are doing the event with is one of the dbags who oneshots every enemy the moment they spawn.
---
Get rid of blocker, rank up the slugger to max
---
Consider removing marathoner for evasive
---
Party boy/girl is largely useless, use that as a trade in &amp; out for when you want to take booze (can only be affected by one at a time, they don‚Äôt last long, like 3mins?)

Thanks dude

Take a picture of an alien....,

Jk, have you explored the taxidermy shop completely?
---
You have got to be kidding me
---
I think it's worth a try at least. Good point on trading though

Near Harper‚Äôs Ferry, where the tracks end on the left. The unmarked train station.

Really neat to see a Bethesda'er applauding our trading post. Thanks, u/Ladydevann! Drop by anytime we're open for free gear or a cool glass of lemonade!

Xbox here! Thanks for doing this!
---
Would go for the TacOps Underarmor and the sheepsquatch plushie. The plushie is really adorable.
---
XB1 Tactical Underarmour
---
spamming vertibot is Garbage move.
---
also i agree 1000xp in 5 mins is Slow as,
---
i can farm twice that just doing whitesprings or Westek i can get more :).
---
And also who comes onto the Community to Brag about Glitching exploits to get XP.
---
You sir are A low life lol :) enjoy being outcast for using glitches and bragging about it
---
Yep u can find around 3 or so. Plus high level muties give good xp.
---
Nope, I still want my .50 receiver on my BE hunting rifle, it's part of why that weapon is so OP, insta-shot everyone except SBs and SBQs with 1K Stealth damage and use stupidly easy ammo to craft at the same time.
---
It's especially annoying when it even does injury animation to the enemy but no damage.
---
We had griefers at one point at our market too, but other customers killed them, so it all worked out. Always going to be some good and some bad mixed in ;)
---
Xbox here and I would put it towards these new rider skins they‚Äôre bringin out!
---
They left out fixes/positive changes too. It's a messy department and they need to get their shit together
---
How much for the plan then?
---
Hey! I'm on ps4. I love camp building, I used to build camps for people as a side business and I'm a guild camp builder now. I would love to be able get some beautiful, new shinys for my hunting cabin build ie. Deathclaw rug, metal stairs, some beer signs.
---
With the new brewing stuff, I've started leaving a 6 pack of beer in people's camps, figured that'd get the point across
---
Xbox. New C.A.M.P Items!
---
a real single action Revolver called the Colt :).
---
The benefit of not planning my lower levels well. I had about 5 points too many in intel and a bunch of perks I needed.
---
The guy has 20 people watching, so there‚Äôs a market. I left because it was boring to watch.
---
I don‚Äôt think so.  
---
IIRC, I gave some repeat magazines of mine to a friend and they didn‚Äôt count for his challenges. 
---
But holotapes could still be different. Sorry it‚Äôs not a definite answer.
---
Games, Games never change...
---
I‚Äôve seen it a few times at Philippi cemetery
---
People are definitely getting better about it gradually. I won an Encryptid and like 3 or 4 Free Ranges in a row today, which is like a record for me.
---
Dude thats awesome
---
I‚Äôll buy sentinel piece from you
---
I miss the worthless fireworks from fallout 4. I know it would be harder on the server, but it would be awesome to put on a show now that it's online.
---
\^ THIS!  Wtf Bethesda?  In general, keymapping is miserable on PC--C and Z to flip inventory categories...*unless you're in the Pip-Boy!*  Which means I often accidentally try to move my CAMP.
---
Anyway, thanks to dsalter for the tip.
---
Yeah but why not a totally new, bolt action 50 cal rifle model? The SIZE of the hunting rifle makes no sense for firing 50 BMG. It should be heavy, and have silly recoil. The one advantage over the gauss should be craftability, no need to charge up, and cheaper ammo. Give it a supressor, recoil stuff, whatever.
---
I also kind wish rifles were still viable outside of sneak attacks... le sigh.
---
Ps4 . I would probably buy a rider paint for excavator. With many weight problems lately this PArmor is my savior for moving around.
---
Rifleman all perks completely filled
---
All very good ideas.  Thank you.  Yes. I do need lead but I was also just trying to understand how it all works.  Thank you everyone!
---
...OR whatever you mapped you VATS button to on PC, as stated above.
---
Shoot them at things
---
Just when you're used to protect and serve the whitespring turns your world on its head and says serve and protect.
---
Nice! I'm guessing ALL rifle based perks apply, then? I think I heard Sandman applies as well?
---
As far as i know no. When i tried for a mistake ,i was directed to the ps4 site ,that says every purchase is finale ,thx,go f yourself.
---
You on PC? I have a spare TS agl I think. Idk if I still have it.
---
I feel old
---
If you have too many 2XP then no one will play during regular XP days.
---
Yes, you can

---
I'm a builder and normally I am very much against attacking another player's camp but in this case it needs to be done.  I would rather that the area was just a no build zone but we have to draw a line on acceptable behavior.  
---
If the camp is just a place to drop off stuff I'm cool with it but if it's there to screw with other players it needs to be nuked from orbit either with an Orbital Strike Beacon or failing that another nuke centered right on their base.
---
Sometimes hostile robots can spawn at the clubhouse.  
---
There‚Äôs also a chance you hit a friendly robot accidentally at some point, and the hive mind doesn‚Äôt like that.
---
What I gathered was the Nuka Dark last 30 minutes and only 5% addiction chance. So that would be an extra 6 str and 6 end.
---
Maybe a 10mm or sniper rifle
---
Maybe weights aren't made entirely out of lead. I just move on with this kind of stuff. It's bethesda I try not to think too deeply
---
Supplies for killing people at workshops duhhhhh
