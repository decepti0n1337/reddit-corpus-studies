What do you think THAT means?

Or they could just add them
---
Same. Levels everything. My favorite DMV, west Tek, Burroughs farm tool. Unfortunately restricted to indoors as it blows bodies 200 ft in the air
---
I'm getting that same, different error code on xbox - maybe it means they're working on something ob the backend
---
Didn't see the "first" post...
---
Aesthetic reasons.
---
That's usually how that works lol.
---
In 20 minutes...   
---

---
Hey, my answer is just as accurate as anyone else who replies...
---
Now, if you started a drinking game (for the adults only) based on posts about the servers being down, you really wouldn't care right about now....   .grin.
---
Also duh... bad builds get stomped by good ones. I dont see anyone asking fof pvp to be removed from wow cuz they're bad lol
---
Let me call Todd real quick
---
The explosive effect won't break your stealth, if that's what you're wondering.
---
I’ve bought an insult note for 15k for this exact reason.
---
I won't say how the settler wanderer gave it to me, but it involved a stick of butter.

I love my suppressed lever action. It’s my long range weapon of choice and I’ll use a fixer for enemies near by. I use a bloodied lever action and it works for my build. A lot of people say that instigating it a better prefix on a legendary lever rifle though. You’ll get more damage on the first shot and with sneak bonuses it should take out most thing quickly. It’s a great gun for a stealth rifle build.
---
Jeez people...
---
What's going on? Have I missed something?
---
Thanks really shouldve looked there before anything its just 3 am right now cant think straight
---
Tbh, I’d probably nuke it.
---
This whole thread made me giggle. You are all great 😊
---
Troll elsewhere coward, you’re exactly who this post is about. Though I doubt you even play fo76
---
We’ve all been there.
---
Well it might be little after....
---
Well Beth can surely adjust the penalties without permanently losing a customer. Actually since they are doing real money tradings they will always come back, no penalty is too much.
---
I also got the game two days ago. I've played about 3 total hours and have noticed that the game is littered with bugs/glitches.
---
My username is gone. This isn't good.
---
While I respect your opinion that has nothing to do with the question friend
---
same on Xbox not working yet
---
I'd buy that for a dollar!
---
"We take your security seriously"...that's why we invest into the cheapest helpdesk software that accidentally publishes your customer info to the internet - Bethesda
---
Clearly the work of the Illuminati.
---
Teamed up with some fellow redditors to drop a nuke and one of them took us to tanagra town, that place was *filthy* I had like 50 or 60 glowing/hardened masses and the same with high radiation fluids after about 30 minutes. It was so heavy I had to vendor half of it.
---
Right? I feel like they should compensate people who subscribe for the days they can't even use it.
---
After all of this .. 1 hour later .. "Fallout 76 Glitch
---
 Infinite X" .. and am i the only one who is late for every glitch ?
---
It really hurt to destoy or scrap some of the pieces I got  while trying.
---
In an amount of time
---
Just curious, where did you see that?
---
Ok, I'll tell you my secret source of legendaries.
---
Bots on parade. The enclave event. The one in the cranberry bog.
---
Seriously.
---
It just works.
---
- Todd Howard
---
It took a little over an hour to do. That alone should tell you how insane the grind is. Without it, months easily. It's not exactly riveting gameplay. But it is nice to have a list of things I can buy. It gives me a goal on how much gold to work for or whatever. Honestly it shouldve been like this from the get go where we can view the whole list. Maybe instead ranking up unlocks some sort of perk or lowered prices in the surrounding cap shops. Really poor design on Todd's part. Now I only wish I could do the same with the settlers. I just want those damn garden foundation plots.
---
Thanks for the tips man. But I thought that in 76 INT doesn’t increase XP gain, but only the CND bar of items you craft and the durability of the weapons you use. I may be wrong tho.
---
It can take a while letting that little thing bite away at you!
---
&gt;This sub is out of their minds. 
---
&gt;Not even the devs of this game probably agree with being forced to monetize their game in this bullshit way.
---
You, sir, are hilarious.
---
people do that all the time, they have tournaments for it, especially on console
---
Pvp is dead on fo76 no one likes it just play fortnight if u fight someone lol
---
Shovel because it make shovel sound.

You gather resources in each habitat. A,B, and C. These resources go towards an animal youll have to protect later on. You put these resources in a feeding trough. The more you get the stronger the animal from bloatflys to deathclaws. Stronger the animal you make easier it is to protect from waves of predators (1,2, and the alpha predator) . PS you dont need to do every habitat to Pass just need to do at least one. Most of the time it will be only one habitat you do because of limited people.
---
ffs what more handouts do people need, lol.
---
I am on reddit for the same reason I shop walmart. I wish things weren't this way. It's not a good place for people who aren't agreeable or silent.
---
I like the idea but actually tying into the story their are somewhat trying to make is a little ify. Maybe it becomes optional once you’ve completed the 79 heist and the gold standard is finally like covered (tho hopefully not used as the currency) but you could also get invited in by a person who’s already done it. And I’d also like plots to not automatically be given cause I’d rather buy than sell. My only worry is a system like this may undermine existing systems like camp shops or interpersonal trading or even the reddit market place which runs pretty efficiently
---
Haven't had many problems with bugs/glitches. Most common is AI movement and behavior. Most have been pretty funny for the most part and fairly infrequent. Visual bug involving top left chat history box appearing black and being mostly see through. But that hasn't been too bad. Other than that i haven't noticed any others.
---
Welcome to Fallout 76!!
---
Trust me I know, which is why I'm so mad at seeing them do dumb shit all the time. I just hope this is a covid thing and not a "This is how we act after wastelanders" thing. They had redeemed themselves a lot after it but it's slowly getting lost on the fact that it still doesn't address how bad the end game of this game is. Again it feels like everything else these guys have done. Give people a super nice looking thing at the start but as soon as you dive deeper you can see it's hollow and full of problems.
---
The *true* meta is a JE laser and a glitched never ending JFFR Tesla rifle. Ass/sent heavy combat or SS armor. Nuka Cola Quantum and Orange and Grape spamming. Different Nukas stack.
---
Yes, some of the camps are amazing. I am seriously impressed by the way some players come up with inventive ways to build.
---
I keep my camp close to 76 and sell stuff pretty cheap, just to help out newer players. But I also don't have a clue what things are worth in terms of what players will pay as opposed to what pops up in the vendor. 
---
Most plans are 10 to 50 caps and I lower prices for other stuff, too. I dont ever have many caps so I know how much it sucks to really want a plan but not be able to afford it.
---
I am fairly new to the game and I have been seeing a lot of posts concerning the "death" of pvp both here and the Bethesda forums. I am confused.
---
I thought Nuclear Winter was all pvp.
---
shhh
---
...there's cards to pick up?
---
I think player marketplace should link up to vending at camps, easy access
---
Damn you still have alot to do man I have 3 toons over 500hrs and I'm just now running outta stuff
---
So I'm sorry if you haven't even hit 50 your biulds garanteed to be incomplete and unless you have a friend that's a high lev theres no way you could solo any of the minimal endgame that there is
---
Have you launched your own nuke, have you kill a wendago colossus, have you completed the tadpole/ possum challenges I just feel like at lev 40 theres no way you could be even close to done. I've seen guys at 700 +
---
That's so weird. It literally takes more effort for him to move the slider down to 0 than to just list them for the default value. 
---
Plus if he never intended anyone to reach the machines why even put legendaries in there? What a dummy.
---
Sounds like y’all need to create the MommySalami faction - a bunch of scorch-killing vault dwellers
---
The *rent* part could be taken away and instead made to where 1% *the amount that goes to trade venders currently* pays for the rent?
---
My Vampires Buzzblade is pretty fun
---
I want fallout 1st but I don’t want scrap box withdrawals lol
---
I like the idea.
---
I would like to put a limit of maybe ten items per player.
---
So that way the majority of people would put only their best items in there.
---
If you have the ghillie suit it pairs surprisingly well with the deathclaw mask for the time being.
---
Google fallout 76 builds.  There are tons of reddit posts and utube videos.  Then check out nukes and dragons for their build planners
---
I have a Suppressed AA2525 Handmade and a Suppressed TSE Fixer. I'm a sneak commando build. I find that the TSE fixer, even suppressed, puts me in "Caution" much more often than the non explosive Handmade. But, enemies still just look for me, sometimes walking right next to me. You should be fine.
---
Bruh it’s just RNG, you can be swimming in bloodied next time when you craft. Also Super Duper doesn’t work for legendary crafting. 
---
Edit: Super duper didn’t craft those extra ammo for you, when you craft a weapon the system gives you some ammo, people use this to make fusion cores.
---
Every time I play, I consider camp-hopping a regular part of “maintenance” (e.g. managing inventory, selling off extras, restocking my vending machine.)
---
It's ok I just made one right now again. So you don't need to.
---
I have 6 skins none of which can be applied to the small standard backpack, there was one on the Atomic Shop recently that could be applied to the small, but they are few and far between
---
Yeah sorry man as a pvper, there is literally no skill in this game’s pvp. It’s fun to instakill someone that thinks they have a sick build because they can destroy sbq, but it doesn’t take skill or even thoughtfulness. I’m pretty convinced that everyone throwing a fit about this stuff is just mad that they can’t bully people to vent stress about having a micro penis. You’re not good at a game because you have a meta build. Same as people meta abusing in destiny 1 and calling you shit because you aren’t using a prenerf thorn lol. It’s just not reasonable. I really agree that they should bring back survival mode for pvp focused players to have a bit more fun. The state of pvp now just isn’t fit for adventure servers.
---
Bruh
---
I was over level 200 when I did that particular quest, and was actually amazed at the damage she did, I remember thinking: “wtf, I’ve never had a 10mm pistol do that to ghouls!”
---
I remember doing that every time it popped up good to see it’s still relevant!
---
What about T-65? Do you think its worth the grind? Same question about Gauss Minigun if you used one. I saw a bunch of reviews and most people find it underwhelming
---
My bloodied swing speed reduced weight shovel, hands down.
---
Looks like one of the hamsters died.
---
Seriously. I was shit talking someone last night and they brought their clan in to fight. I love when people bring in their backup to fight me. This update is gonna fuck it up.
---
That's part of the problem with shotguns though, the are super potent in vats if vats actually works and you don't get the regen bug.
---
Seems to fit since it’s not just fo76...  Bethesda you should probably hire this guy lol
---
Servers are expected to return to normal operation "soon". See "soon" for further details. 
---
Soon: A period of time in the future that is neither defined as "a long time" or "within a moment". "Soon" is the period of time between these two fore-mentioned points of time. However, since all descriptions of these time tables are based on individual perspective, no specific standard of timekeeping has ever established specific values in units of accepted timekeeping to be ascribed to the period of time that should be assigned to "soon". Thus, it is widely accepted that when faced with the time period of "soon" it is best to relax and try not to become impatient.
---
I like to use Berry Mentats and it didn't take long to learn a harvesting route that I enjoy, and get xp for crafting the drug. Searching and harvesting can be part of the game. 
---
I dropped out of the bullion, rep, cap, legendary grind and now the game for me is less frantic and more interesting as I'm discovering more as I travel about just doing random things, feels more like Fallout 4 to me now.
---
That doesn't mean that changes for the PvP game mode have no effect on the PvE. If they are in fact using the same game assets, then on some level there is a base damage number that applies to all areas of the game. Yes, they can change multipliers separately, but that only goes so far.
---
&gt;Destiny also does it.
---
And changes to weapon damage for PvP in Destiny ABSOLUTELY affect the rest of the game too. FFS, some weapon archetypes have become completely useless in PvE at various times because of balance changes for PvP. How long have you actually played Destiny??
---
I had to make a point of turning off hard bargain to sell so much shit I picked up. I had to make a couple of trips to Harper's as the amount of grenade launchers gets ridiculous.
---
Ran into a few of these players recently. Trying to get me to pvp. Melee, get in front of shots. And go into my camp and kill my Brahmin. I just wave and continue on. If they continue to pester, I document them and block.  Don't have to deal with it anymore.
---
Servers are 100% down
---
Depends on your router. I have a Netgear and it's under Advanced home&gt;internet port&gt;connection status. Then just release and renew.
---
Found the carried player
---
check the fo76 subreddit and see if anyone has posted about it
---
Bethesda deleted the servers by accident.
---
I do, but it’s not the same of what could be
---
i can't even log in lol. the 'press any button to sign in' brings me to the error page
---
I've done the responders and the wastelanders settlers and raiders ones. Not in a position to experiment at the moment but I am curious which do/don't.
---
Hahahaha. I did (sometimes do, still, depending on how much loot I have) the same thing, usually I will try to get as much as possible per item from a vendor, but being overloaded from that farm spot I took hard bargain off and let it go as cheap as possible because the only other option was dropping it.  I think after that I made like 20-30 stable fluxes and then still had around 10 of each item to sell on my vending machines.
---
Crazy can't even log into the website now.
---
And that's my point, it doesn't change much.
---
RNG is not a bug.
---
Executioner's Explosive 90% Reduced Weight Flechettes Harpoon Gun. Never runs out of ammunition and you seldom need to fire more that twice. Base damage without perks is 483. I'm not running a heavy weapon build now but I keep it around for old times sake. I built a small nautical themed display case for it naturally.
---
Honestly, I've always liked the idea of a public auction house. Like RuneScape's one or something. You just put stuff up, set a minimum price, and let people buy what they want.
---
It's definitely not top priority for 76, but I'd love to see an auction house added to the game down the line.
---
Yep when I look at the ones I crafted, including gauss mini and shotgun, bloodied isn’t even the rarest, I still haven’t seen some prefixes (nocturnal?) and hope I won’t lol
---
Honestly, I’d just settle for a wife
---
Right, i farmed Fasnacht hard and after the event I was surprised to see I had 398 notes!
---
I have over 900.....I do several Encryptid per day.
---
Lmaoo
---
I just meant I dont get why people aren’t doing this event more often, it’s definitely one of the better events
---
Digital store is still up lol
---
Can't get your account hacked if no one can log in.
---
i didnt say that, i simply suggested that if his girlfriend is having trouble with people harrassing them they could turn on passive mode, and then you called me a coward, cause people picking on others like that are just griefers
---
Your idea is good, but i'd make the mods free (since you already pay for private servers) and give players the option to donate to modders if they want to support them like the nexus does.
---
Maybe they should "Fixer" the servers first
---
Oh yeah so many legendaries its amaze, moat of the time I just see people serving hopping to check out shops.
---
Why doesn't Bethesda post the issue on their site???!!!!???
---
the difference in WoW is that you cant walk infront of me so that i accidentaly hit you anywhere in the world and then you can instantly murk me and take some of my coins.
---
Fisto? Did it come with a manual? Never mind, I'll figure it out. :P
---
I'm definitely not warring on Bethesda, but sometimes I just wanna take a workshop nobody was fuckin' with on a public server. 
---
I'm level 66 and ever since I hit 50, I can't keep level 100+ players from trying to PvP. I'd say those are the real cowards, tbh. That's why I usually just play on a private server if I'm alone. 
---
I don't really get it - do people just enjoy smashing other players so much their level is irrelevant? Is it the only part of the game they like? I don't see why you wouldn't just play the fuck out of NW if that's the case. 
---
The other day I was playing with a friend who's around level 80 and I took a workshop to load up on lead and steel. Dude who's three times my level pops up right after I build everything and shoots me with a fuckin Tesla rifle. I was cool with it - like, dick move, but that's how the game works. My buddy didn't like it though, so he killed him - over and over, because the dude kept coming back, and was talking shit the whole time like "reeee it's 2 against 1" when I didn't shoot him once and was hiding the whole time.
---
How are you even enjoying yourself at that point?
---
the RNG is bugged if it is putting completely unrelated attributes on a weapon.
---
Gotta put your fedora on every time you start reading a post starting with “dear ...”
---
&gt; “We take your security seriously” is the “thoughts and prayers” of computing. 
---
I thought "thoughts and prayers" was more "we hear your feedback" and "we'll pass it onto the team".
---
Seems like it's just going to turn into the same thing with people teaming up after they start fighting so they can try doing cheesy shit.
---
My reference point is always RuneScape. Big fancy auction house location. You plop things in with a minimum price, and let people have at it.
---
I made so much money in RuneScape back in the day, just selling basic shit like Clay. Just shove a ton up at a time and undercut everyone else's price by a few bucks.
---
What a time to be alive. I hate to see it.
---
Oh man, I did this last night in Whitespring and didn't realize I spawned in the Scorched by trying to harvest the Ultracite Ore.
---
What can I do other than daily quests and explore?
---
Yep the sound effect itself is the bonus.
---
*M'lady's legs quiver as I tip the fedora*
---
Your so be it means nothing to todd
---
Ba dum-pshh!
---
It is, but people can’t use their over powered guns and builds.
---
I got one by lying to Davenport that the raider captured me. You need 8 charisma tho to lie to him.
---
This. If I wanna grind out ridiculous amounts of money, I should be allowed to.
---
Besides, wouldn't having a small cap like it currently does, mean that people are gonna play less? If I can't make money, why grind out loot to sell?
---
The 1400 NPC vendor limit has the same problem. I usually hop on once a day, get my 1400 caps, do a couple daily atom things, then quit. I wouldn't be quitting so fast if I could grind out more caps.
---
yes but the people who harras people, try to walk infront of htem while they are fighting or need to lure someone else into another persons group to inniatate arent the people like you who are looking for a fun and 'even' fight.
---
the game just is in a really bad spot for pvp, and i honestly believe right now its doing more harm then good. so unless revamped pvp just has no place for now.
---
Well now it's not giving me an error code any more, it's just saying my password is wrong.  Progress?
---
 IDK, it's pretty damn disconcerting.
---
ohhhh sad! Are you guys on xbox? My husband and I play "couch party" mainly because I don't love playing with strangers. We do combat together, kill scorchbeasts, do the atom challenges, and sometimes just do C.A.M.P. stuff while enjoying the group buffs. Neither of us are awesome at combat but it's so much more fun with two. If you're on xbox pm me your gamertag, I'll combat with you :)
---
It's like how PokemonGO won't let you rename your Butterfree to Butterfree because it has "butt" in the name.
---
People like you have no actual fun in life and it's sad.
---
I found a bloodied explosive fixer in a npc vendor
---
Well they managed to change the error code so that must mean something
---
Any time travelers who visit the past would likely experience a manufactured blip in a temporary pocket of existence. Although this all relies on whether or not you believe in free will. If free will is to be accepted, then the total outcome of this reality must not be set in stone. Meaning it's either malleable, or it seamlessly transitions between possible realities. This would mean that we could not experience time travel until we reach a point when it is guaranteed in our future.
---
So as for going back in time, either a) we can't make it back that far, or b) if we did it wouldnt be on this exact timeline. Which considering the present inconceivability of the subject could also mean not making contact with an actual reality at all. Which would again explain why we have no contact with time travelers.
---
But also I am not at all educated in the field sooooooooooo don't take my word for it. What were we talking about? BETHESDA FIX YOUR THING.
---
ah yes, let me just shelf out about 300 bucks so that i can play pvp.
---
if they revamped pvp, maybe added a new server that had no legendaries or tweaked legendaries with seperate characters and balancing, thatd already be a good start, but pvp in its current state just is an unbalanced clusterfuck, that lets be honest, is mostly used to grief other players.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
i wont call ALL pvpers griefers. but i see very few people that are looking for a clean or even fight, its mostly just douches that walk infront of you or try to get one of their friends into your team or try to provoke you.
---
[https://bethesda.net/en/status](https://bethesda.net/en/status)
---
&gt; If they are in fact using the same game assets, then on some level there is a base damage number that applies to all areas of the game.
---
Then separate number tweaks is all that's needed in this new pvp gamemode. That wouldn't spill into pve lmao. Not really a herculean feat, NW is already different.
---
Besides that, BGS could force players to make a new character every season (like they said they were going to do for survival) and limit legendaries on *that gamemode.* 
---
&gt; And changes to weapon for PvP in Destiny ABSOLUTELY affect the rest of the game too.
---
I was talking about how Destiny's gamemodes change the power of gear.
---
Free XP is another perk of it as well, if you have the relevant perk card, or you get the once-in-a-blue-moon random that has it, and opts to share it with you
---
I have tossed the bones and the elder spirits have spoken. Sometime before Half Life 3
---
First I've heard of it...
---
JK😉..but thank you. Actually on PC
---
UPDATE: I saw a guy with free ammo in his vend earlier today and thought of ur comment. May be the first time I actually witnessed that.
---
I’m just posting so I can see live comments
---
that would make sense, there are heavy gunners that run bloodied.  VATS is not an attribute that we learn its not something we use.  It would make sense if this was my rifleman and I was actually able to craft my own legendary gauss rifle, but this is a heavy weapon on a build that does not use VATS at all.
---
yeah some ammo, I ended up with 2k rounds of it.
---
I have it as well. Total buzzkill.
---
I'm pretty sure the answer is "no."
---
Which is unfortunate.  I like to insure my "keeper" weapons with custom skins to make sure I don't accidentally vendor them.
---
Yeah lol. Somedays the RNG blesses us but we tend to remember the majority of days where it runs us over and backs over us for good measure.
---
if they are not up in 20 minutes, OP can read your comment again and wait another 20 minutes.
---
I used to solo Patrol Duty (truly boring event) every day hoping to get handmade plans then I got a shotgun. 😂
---
Good Community - Still not used to it
---
https://reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/hbkxx0/are_the_severs_down/
---
Bethesda are all borked currently. Nothing much is working.
---
They make good paper weights at banks.
---
servers are down dude....
---
Literally everyone.
---
People are going to buy Last of Us 2? I thought that not only would the release of the leaks about the main characters being killed off but that they were killed by a diversity hire would have killed any chance that people would play that game.
---
who are the Jeez People
---
Yeah didn’t you hear?
---
I now understand why people reported blumpkin
---
They need a "thanks, but no thankyou" style emote. My main is lvl 267 and ive veen playing off and on since launch. 
---
Recently I was levelling an alt, level 12. I had to basically run away from higher level people trying to give me free shit. I didnt want to be rude and give a thumbs down or no emote so I just ran off haha
---
Your passwords can now have 16x the detail. Loving the new change.
---
So then by your logic all weapons are bugged? 
---
Pipe bolt action pistols with FFR? Bugged
---
Combat shotgun with added DR when blocking? Bugged.
---
Just because you’re not getting the rolls you want isn’t a bug
---
What
---
Bethesda whenever you find out who's doing it perma ban their IP.
---
Yep, on Xbox. I believe the full gamertag was LilCumstain69 or some variation of that
---
Yes.  A lot of people.
---
Although, in a way, you're lucky.  Some of us can't even get the game to launch.
---
Nope, everyone else is in, and I've seen zero other posts  about login issues
---
I'm partial to my B25 Ultracite Gatling Laser.  Renamed it Death Star because it shoots a nearly uninterrupted beam of green death that melts everything in front of it.  Just primed that bad boy last night, can't wait to take it for a spin on the SBQ...
---
👏👏👏
---
I'm always helping out new players...or I just drop random shit off at a train station for whoever to pick up. I need friends to play with bc I have nothing to do anymore and get bored
---
I’ve got the same issue going on rn. I know they’re busy fixing what’s going on but just hoping for a fix soon.
---
Any advice on what to do?
---
as it should! lol
---
Aww
---
Came to write just this.
---
I recommend, if anything, following BethesdaSupport on Twitter, and get a notification whenever they post a thing. Chances are much higher this might get you the note you're looking for. \^\^
---
Finally get time to play😭
---
Have you tried the instigating one? It should be magic with the correct barrel.  
---
Also assassins on weapon is useless as well, people who PvP doesn't use assassin weapons
---
Lol
---
Yea the wait is the most painful, we really want ‘something’ and that makes it rare in our minds, while in fact it probably isn’t even the rarest lol
---
I'm being an asshole, its down and nothing to do but wait. There's a ton of posts here about it ;)
---
Just an FYI, for all of you who believe that base budget glitching, is just one of those things that Bethesda is letting everyone get away with. Bans are happening. They have not actively been going through the servers locating glitches but they are however responding to players reporting base glitching and are banning players for violating Bethesdas TOS. All it takes folks is one player whos so morally uptight or just mad because he can't glitch like everyone else to start reporting everyone else who is.
---
i already got my settlers maxed while the glitch still worked lol, i meant it was unfortunate for everyone that didn't do it while it still worked.
---
I am only Level 25 but my humble little farm is right between the Wayfarer and 76.  So I hear it going down at the nearby Homestead and a Level 2 player is getting lit up, so I help him out. Brought him back to my house, fixed him up with a full set of brand new leather armor, some outfits, food, and a ton of ammo.  Helped him out with a couple quests too.  I've had some great higher level players hook me up, so I'm glad when I get to pay it forward.
---
Bloodied 1\* &gt; AA/E
---
I'd buy that for 10 to be honest.
---
My wife does the same thing with me... except her scream is from the wendigo that is twice her level while she's first in the mire (she walked down the road into the pre-placed encounter).
---
NEVER!!!!! /s
---
It'll be fixed when it's repaired.
---
When they fix them, probably.
---
Not as quick as this post gets deleted
---
It is weird that the Digital Store is still Operational.
---
I’m gonna start posting about turning things on. Like turning on lights, generators, etc! 😂😂😂
---
Edit: whoever downvoted this does not understand sarcasm or humor!
---
as they say.. you cant fix stupid...
---
I don't think punishing the people that want to play honest and fair by completely eliminating pvp is any better of a solution though. The people that want to grief and exploit the game always find a way. The DDoS shit is a prime example of it.
---
It's just a lazy solution to make some people happy.
---
So sad! Does anyone know when this will subside?
---
I’m beginning to think it’s mine end game too! ;)
---
some events are specific, of course, but those are the events added with the DLCs:
---
- campfire tales (rewards scout badges)
---
- encryptid (rewards the imposter sheepsquatch outfit, the sheepsquatch mascot outfit and the fixer plan)
---
- project paradise (rewards arktos pharma lab coat, new chem plans, bear arm plans, a backpack skin)
---
- riding shotgun (rewards backpack skin, caravaneer outfit)
---
Haha was just eyeing mine up.
---
When you buy the Fallout 2nd subscription
---
They didn't pay their Fallout 1st. subscription fee.
---
Well a new code not the 3:0:8... it’s now just 3.0.9
---
I'd assume they'd make private worlds free by than.
---
I thought most would agree so I didnt bother including that detail. Mb
---
I have but it goes nowhere...
---
I'm using weight reducing perks (chems and junk). I can't remember the rest. I have all the rifle perks and a few AP perks.
---
Every game with pvp seems to attract this kind of toxic player who gets off on griefing others.  It’s been kept to a minimum here.  Hopefully they will just go away.
---
[It just works.](https://bethesda.net/en/status)
---
let it be a lesson for future games, you'll remember it when you see them or some other greedy company pulling the same shit
---
If that. Maybe the usual by the way guys it's back on (if you didnt know). But you right. Kinda like when natural disasters occur. Once everything's goin like it should we all just go back to normal old us. But when it happens, its everywhere.
---
Aw man that has actually made me tear up!  It's because of fantastic ppl like you and Mr. Level 5 that keeps me playing, through all the bugs and nonsense, keep up the great work sir!
---
&gt;Then separate number tweaks is all that's needed in this new pvp gamemode. That wouldn't spill into pve lmao. Not really a herculean feat, 
---
You don't know any of that. 
---
&gt;NW is already different.
---
Which at this point in this discussion is entirely irrelevant.
---
&gt;I was talking about how Destiny's gamemodes change the power of gear.
---
Honestly, I don't think you know what you were talking about. You clearly don't have a clue how weapon balance works in Destiny, that's for sure.
---
i said.. check the fo76 subreddit and see if anyone has posted about it..
---
not the bethesda forums..
---
i only see floating bases lol
---
I like this idea, this is a good idea.

Like I said it goes nowhere

He cant read! I mean if he could he woulda seen the 100 other posts.
---
lol fallout 2nd
---
I've gotten into the habit of crafting low level weapons and tricking them up, ambushing bambies coming out of the vault by powerlanding in front of them in PA, then dropping stims and guns for them before vanishing like the armoured nerd I am.
---
I want those screen dividers so bad. The moment I saw them at the palace I was like yes please!
---
+1 I agree with this because alot of pvpers are mad at Bethesda for the UPCOMING update for PvP it hasn't been released and there already mad. They're already calling "war", what ever Bethesda does to them they deserve it. It's there own fault of they have to use assassin's armour/armour because they always die. They need a advantage to win because they can't play on a level playing field like Nuclear winter there is nothing op on that it's completely rng for bobble heads for guns, for EVERYTHING.
---
Me too. It makes me happy to help the new players out. Some higher levels did it for me and it's my way of saying thanks. :)
---

---
Intermittent, lol its just down!
---
lol, who‘s gonna tell them?
---
There is a list of Legendary Effects for Ranged Weapons and one for Melee Weapons, you can roll anything out of that list for any type of weapon. This is how the game works for absolutely all Legendary Weapons, why would the Gauss Minigun be different?
---
If you took out all VATS related effects from the list pretty much all two-stars and three-star Gauss Miniguns would be a god roll since it already has the explosive effect built into it and the only major modifiers would be Bashing damage increased by 40%, +10% damage while aiming, 25% faster fire rate and +50% limb damage.
---
I had to go through about 40 Legendary Modules to get two Bloodied Gauss miniguns, with one of them having a single star while the other had two VATS effects. When I saw that I was absolutely thrilled to see the +33% VATS hit chance on it. You should really get yourself up to date with how some of the legendary effects currently behave in the game, +33% VATS hit chance/50% limb damage/Bashing damage increased by 40% are the best secondary effects you can hope to have on a high ROF weapon at the moment. Go check AngryTurtle's video on it or something.
---
Oh I like this answer.
---
Scroll down...
---
Yes let’s see...
---
Desire for that mode is basically "I want to use bloodied 1-shot builds vs. people in PVP".  Unless it was balanced like NW, it would quickly devolve into "you're either this meta or you die".
---
Free range has about 25 plans you can get for a number of different weapons. Riding shotgun also has a couple plans and unique outfits.
---
i wouldn't expect anything, you should think about the sub and if bethesda really deserve the money after all they've done, if you feel like you need to pay for the scrap box to continue enjoying the game, it's probably better to try and find a game that doesn't make you feel like that.
---
I use an explosive lever with sneak, works out ok.
---
Try getting another character to ash heap and sleeping outside.
---
You've got the magic duo of mutations? Speed deamon and adrenal reaction? Plus life bringer perk?
---
2018 called. They said that this meme was tired even back then.
---
Yea vats isn’t that useful for gauss mini or the minigun, but it does work well on certain heavy weapons such as 50 cal, gatling and the plasma caster. You can use those weapon to ‘snipe’ and one shot most mobs.
---
They could also make a bank. Thatd be cool.
---
Lmao
---
Learn to scroll down
---
Lol, if you are on pc, bro, I’ll give you 5 of them!

I believe there is several posts on YouTube and wiki also has a list of events and their treasury note rewards.

happy cake day!
---
All servers are currently down.
---
You'll find the servers down right now, but I've played for a while now and this is not a common thing. It's never been down for more than a few minutes unannounced for me.
---
Which skins do you have? As far as I can tell, all atom shop backpack skins can be applied to the small backpack as a mod.
---
I have the nuka-cooler, 4th of july hardcase, responders rescue pack, and the communist backpack. None of these could be applied to the small backpack until the recent backpack vanity update, but now they all can.
---
3, 2, 1 .  .  .  Deleted post
---
Of course this happens just before I log in for the first time in a month or two.
---
I appreciate that but I woulda just dropped it anyway lol
---
I know what happened. Last night I thought to myself- its been a long time since I've played Skyrim. 
---
Todd is a very demanding overlord I will not comply.
---
Yes.
---
Or you can look at the subreddit and see a trend.
---
No. Services are down.
---
Thing that make you go “hmm”
---
I think private servers should not be free, maybe not cost as much as they do but give the players the ability to playtest mods only on private servers would  make alot of money for beth, and given how modders made bethesda games so replayable and better it seems obvious that bethesda should start working with modders on this game.
---
Yes. So far as I understand it, the downside to explosive, besides the extra durability loss, is that all AA effects *with the exception of the legendary AA effect* are disabled on an explosive weapon. The only benefit gained from running Tank Killer in this situation is the increased chance to stagger opponents through the extra explosive effect.
---
It’s not you. Something is fucky at BGS right now.
---
Oof bud. You're going to be in for a rude surprise if you're trying to login now...
---
Riding shotgun is terrible for notes. Takes a long time and only gives 2 notes. My favorites are swarm of suitors which can be completed in under 2 min, heart of the swamp which can be completed in 30 seconds if you hit the heart for around 90% of its hp on the first hit, and lode baring which you can start and then go do other stuff or just afk and then come back when the timer is ending. One violent night is also great. Uranium Fever isn’t the fastest but it’s still worth doing for scrip and selling weapons for caps. If you see people doing project paradise or radiation rumble, make sure to join those because they give 4 notes but you won’t be able to solo them. 
---
Other events take too long for the notes they give. If you don’t have a group to do multiple queens and encryptids with then those are your best options imo.
---
No he was way over on the west side of the map,south of mouthman museum. On PC.
---
Half-Life 2.5
---
Definitely.
---
The developers don’t have degrees in economics or business. I do, and I think it’s intentional. They want it to be hard to get anything in this game. It’s a deliberate attempt to cut costs and up sales. Damn near same business model as ESO.
---
When Ward finally finds someone with the guts to help... 👌
---
They getting ddos'd?
---
&gt; Which at this point in this discussion is entirely irrelevant.
---
No it's relevant, considering it's **already in the game.**
---
Hell, when NW *was affecting* pve and giving lasers more damage, BGS patched it out because it was a glitch. Kinda goes against your narrative.
---
Having a separate pvp-focused gamemode with different rules would be a welcome change and gain interest from a lot of players, especially since BGS Austin could rebuff TSE. 
---
But apparently, you think everything has to work like Destiny. *shrug*
---
See if it'll happen for you again and take a pic.
---
Pipe is life...
---
I would agree, but the moderator(s) woke up and finally removed all the "login Posts"
---
Ddos?
---
No, it isn't weird because it isn't operational either.  The account authentication servers are down so you can't log in to shit to buy anything.
---
They deserve every bit of it.
---
Yes, but Butterfingersthesda accidentally dropped the servers instead.
---
 
---
As I was sitting here getting updates on the server status of Fallout 76, I saw that the servers are down for TES Legends, Doom and other Bethesda titles. So I started to think about the possibilities. Could it be that servers just went down for technical software issues? Sure.... but not likely considering this is for several different games. Could it be that servers went down for hardware or ISP related issues? Also possible, but just as unlikely as this issue is across many countries and platforms. So what could it be? What is the most likely possibility? As I thought on this, my mind went back to a story I heard over the past week, where the "War on Bethesda" group threatened to take down servers in retaliation to an upcoming change to pvp that would remove group flagging.
---
Now I am not suggesting that this is what has happened, but it seems far more likely that targeted attacks on Bethesda servers could be to blame than it does to think that a hardware or software issue arose on multiple games, in multiple countries all at the same time. I would love to get other peoples take on this thought, and maybe even a statement from Bethesda as to the nature of the issue.
---
You're missing out.
---
Only issue with that hypothesis is that it mainly stops when I lock my doors and restarts when I unlock them. That and the fact that I spend a lot of time at my camp and never see any enemies, and that I have walked in on people doing it. So yeah. I am pretty sure it is humans and not me failing to notice something smacking things inside of my house. Thanks.
---
we don‘t call the Burrows a „dungeon“ here.
---
I'm also at my 2 month anniversary and I've really enjoyed FO76 so far. I love going up to players, regardless of level, and giving them 5 purified waters because hydration is important!
---
You're the only one.  No one else has said a thing about it.  Probably your identity got stolen.
---
Well in bugthesda defense they did break there login servers trying to give us 2fa we wanted.
---
No, OBVIOUSLY players duping Fasnacht masks caused modded Elder Scrolls to stop working! /s
---
That would be the least-bad possibility.
---
That would explain the troll group that used bait vs. the Faschnat bots and tried to blame me, then got salty when I had pacifist mode on when they tried to PVP me.  I told them if they want to PVP for real, I would be down to kill them in NW (I said as I stood in my Hellfire power armor lol).   They declined of course.
---
Let’s start taking bets how many comment before deleted. I say 8
---
That's (sadly) my best guess too -\_-

True but you'll still cripple yourself with fireproof 3 using enforcer unless you run Adamantium Skeleton.

It wouldn't be Fallout 76 without a thread full of people throwing hissy fits and threatening to cancel their 1st subscriptions.
---
OK, I didn't know you had seen them or it was damage inside buildings.
---
Thanks.
---
The link is as dead as pvp
---
I literally cleared a bunch of space and my reserved fallout 76 space, trying to improve the choppiness. Try starting back up and strange error code ..
---
Glad this is here or I'd be sure I broke my game haha!
---
I would enjoy Nuclear Winter more if hackers weren't so prominent. I like the idea of PvP with no legendary gear but NW hasn't a different feel to it I don't like as much. I think Survival or something similar should be brought back with no legendaries to make it more balanced and challenging.
---
Removing PvP completely would give me one less thing to do and at 3k hours there aren't many things I haven't done a ton of already.
---
.... I agree they need fixing but you seriously compared this to BLM?
---
I know where you are.  Grew up west of you by a dozen miles.  Never heard that term before but hey, doesn't mean it doesn't exist, just that the group I hung with was different.
---
Yep.  Everybody.
---
I believe rolling for these armor pieces and weapons improvement is akin to doing the brotherhood of steel paint quest. It just takes many times for most of us.
---
They were implementing 2FA today. Something likely went wrong.
---
No, you'll be perfectly fine using a **suppressed** AAE Lever Action gun.
---
Lmfao
---
Wow I wish I could get my wife to play PS4 maybe she would complain I play so much.
---
Ty info. I should have just tested.
---
They have not said yet.
---
yeah... But the game does NOTHING to suggest the years you spent in the vault. It's a bad excuse on Bethesda's part.
---
Well, the stores are all up...
---
no you got it wrong there. all bethesda servers are down and it has nothing to do with the 2fa or fallout76. this is more like a targeted DDoS attack.
---
Was your post in reference to getting an error message upon logging in??
---
Servers are down across multiple Bethesda titles, mods are going about they biznass, you’re just behind the times.
---
Has no classification as of yet. People are hoping it falls in heavy eventually. But bethesda hasnt gotten around 2 it.
---
You’ve been compromised. Execute order 66
---
Because it was probably related to the current system outage.
---
K?
---
Sentinel is a legendary perk on armor. The perk has a 75% chance to reduce incoming damage by 15% while standing still. If you have multiple pieces, the perk stacks so it essentially gives you a 75% chance to reduce incoming damage by 75% while standing still.
---
Very useful perk!
---
The perk cards....
---
for sure, I wasn't planning on ending up on a fortnite build, but once i had speed demon/birdbones/marsupial, it was too strong to abandon. Now Im not sure whatd id do if i couldn't jump on mirelurk queens heads, or jump into the face of an aerial SBQ and drop her health by a quarter
---
only every motherfucker on the planet with a bethesda account and a reddit account...
---
In my experience, which is extensive with shotguns, the Instigating non-explosive shotty is king for one shot kills due to the lack of armor penetration on the explosive variant.  The only one better is the Bloodied Gauss +33Vats because it sustains that damage on subsequent shots. In VATS, the Gauss is just a beast.  Your shotty is a definite keeper.
---
For whatever reason FO76's bad reviews were in part due to a large host of kids who wanted it to be another Rust with bases and characters that remain when logged out so they could grief and wreck Daddy's stuff while he was at work.
---
Best guess: a lot of people are asking that.  And there are duplicate threads.
---
If it helps, I don't think your account is compromised.  Or if it is, then a lot of people's accounts are compromised, and Bethy is going to have to do a roll-back.
---
Thanks for a timely and informative reply.
---
You're banned
---
That's a pretty good set, especially for 100 modules.
---
When you don't bother scrolling down at all.....
---
Sure will. But, when your phone goes absolutely bonkers, you'll know something important has gone down, it could hopefully be 76 coming back on
---
Because 10,000 other people posted the same thing in the past two hours and you couldn't be bothered to read all of their posts before submitting a new one.
---
PVP balance is always going to be garbage in a PVE game.  Every MMO ever created has this exact same problem when PVP and PVE use the same character/gear/abilities, which is why PVP is trash in these types of games unless you "clean slate" and 100% remove anything from the PVE game and make a pure PVP only template for the player to use.  Only way PVP will ever be balanced and reasonable is if they literally did a Nuclear Winter level special rules server and clean slated your character, limiting what types of weapons or armor you could acquire and what perks were available/in what strength.
---
I forgot to mention I use sneak. I didn’t know this about Rad-X. Thanks.
---
I’m sure the server stability will be at an all time high post apocalypse
---
Oh look it's nukacolariley, a notorious pvper who levels other players camps and preys on low levels at workshops. You think you're hot shit but you are not. Killing a few level 15s with that lorespade bastard over and over again then destroying their camp is shitty. Trucking people into pvp is shitty. Nobody wants you here, and your videos along with lorespade and your other goons don't deserve they views they get.
---
I would have never thought to look there.
---
[Bethesda.net](https://Bethesda.net) said my password had been changed. I was asking if that means someone has hijacked my account. I know that I can't play when the servers are undergoing maintenance.
---
You are a beautiful woman
---
Ya nope I've seen and been part of d-dos this anit it. Login servers borked the same day bugthesda rolls out 2fa, or that limp dick PvPer fraction who couldn't do shit when they said they would stating shit now.
---
30 years IT, Bethesda played themselfs
---
I’m playing right now ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
---
...sounds unnecessary when I can just check thier outage page every 20 minutes.
---
Nah, pretty sure they got hacked. They’re incredibly hush hush about it and normally there would be blame getting tossed around by now. It’s quite possible they got hacked by the same people who just took Honda &amp; Acura out of commission for a week. Good luck if that’s the case, because if it takes Honda a week to fix we’re just going to see how Fallout 5 looks and without multiplayer it might just come a lot faster.
---
I'm getting 3:0:9 instead of 3:0:844424930263043 so I'm guessing they are still having problems with it. It's 1:35 am here in the UK, so with luck, it'll be fixed when I get up
---
I forgot to mention I use blocker and stealth. I’ll see where I’m at in adding fireproof. Thank you.
---
I just came back after a year.  It is still fallout 76...  but they have definitely made improvements
---
Yes... the store itself is literally operational and you can browse all the shit you want to your hearts content because it's just a webpage hosted somewhere that has no connection to their servers until you log in to try and buy something... which you can't do because their authentication servers are down.
---
Not just u.  Man I have been waiting all day and I sit down and wtf!! I cant log in. Fml. Man.
---
Y’all are about to make me reinstall this and quit playing Day Z.
---
You’re very welcome, no need for thanks! Let me know if you ever have any other questions, I’d be glad to help you out. 🙂
---
lol awesome..
---
so glad this isnt another butthurt workshop'd thread.. lol
---
I could get into a garden simulator dlc where there are a variety of things you have to do to plant certain plants similar to the alcohol dlc.
---
Yeah the launcher will still load some resources, all you get is a black screen and a map usually. 
---
You are not in game though.
---
WOOT WOOT!!  My husband and I started playing as adults, together. Both of us had only played early video games on PC years before, and someone lent us Skyrim for Xbox and we were hooked. We get excited to watch E3 every year (RIP 2020), follow mostly the same game franchises and trends and have in-jokes from the game worlds we fall into. Some couples watch TV together, we play video games. Having simultaneous consoles has been a ton of new fun into an already great pastime.
---
Why don't they shutdown half the servers (or less) at a time? Or wait until midnight? I played yesterday; can't see any groundbreaking reason they have to close everyone down.
---
Or make private servers free. If I want to quest by myself and not worry about downed servers, it should be a given.
---
but 2fa isn‘t rolled out onto doom or TES, yet those games are down too. and doom held up last, it‘s also on a different provider. and given that amazon averted the biggest DDoS attack ever yesterday i‘d say it‘s a realistic assumption.
---
They are the commonly used abbreviations of Legendary effects. I made a one-page cheat sheet to help [here](https://www.reddit.com/user/plaguewiind/comments/gk11q0/rtrade76_legendary_abbreviations/) and it is divided into Ranged/Melee/Armor
---
As somebody who has been griefed by these kinds of coward babies willing to toss a low level on their team headlong into a workshop so they can snipe people caught off-guard for a half-second, I hope they cry themselves right out of the game servers. They're on the same level of "micro-dicked wannabe badass" to me as someone who hunts bears and wolves from a mile up in a helicopter.
---
Get bent, get lost, good riddance, and don't let the vault door hit your little diapered bottom on the way out.

I've been dealing with it on ps4 too

Ive not been able to sell fusion cores. I thought they couldn't be sold. Every time I try it just won't add them to the vendor. No message at the top left nothing. It just won't add them. And yes Ive got stash space for them.
---
That’s what my exact reason why I wanted one too!
---
That is so scary! So I watched a video Monday about building underground. Video was old. Decided hey, why not just see if I can. Tried it, it worked, but I was in a lake area, too much stress, too much hype, kept falling into upside down water. 
---
Mind you, this is the first time I had moved my camp in over a year. I only moved in the first place because it kept showing up as a mission, so ... xp?
---
Ended up building camp above ground, neat and tidy.
---
Today I log back in, but I can’t. Thought for sure that I was banned for my infraction. I would have been okay with that, but it was still disheartening because I really like this game.
---
This has taught me a valuable lesson
---
Woah now, I’d say you just changed my life but lol it’s broke so I can’t see ☹️
---
I am also having login issues, restarting the launcher verified their servers are having issues
---
Get the joke
---
I think [3:0:9] error is code for Welcome to Fallout 76 new player 😂
---
Hahaha fuck
---
Only those who complain about Bethesda are having troubles
---
"Mechanics" my ass. Hopping up and down with marsupial, stealthboys, and Tesla's is so low skill it's sad. The pvp in this game is brainless and I used to do it myself.
---
Yeah, WAY down
---
Servers aren’t under maintenance. There is a technical problem occurring affecting almost all of their online games. Perhaps you are getting the message as a result of that.  You’ll know once the servers are back online if you’re not able to log in at that point.
---
I dont care if there are cheats or just an OP build that allows someone to one shot the queen, but people using them should at least have enough class to let everyone else get a few shots in so they can get their loot.  Its kinda the same rule with legendarys at other events, use your lower power weapon, take a shot, and back off till everyone else there gets a shot.  The loot you screw people out of could have been that uber weapon you wanted to trade for!
---
Bethesda has a Centralized login system yes? To play any of those games you must log into besthesda.net which is what the upgrade was rolled out on today yes? 
---
..............
---
B2525 fixer
---
So glad I waited until I was able to buy it at 1/6 price
---
I'm Down....voting you.
---
I've noticed showing up in the same server I left a few times over the last few days. I find it has been as high as 20% of the time. 
---
Might have to do with their server matching server and placing you in the best one's for your location.
---
Great info. I’ll check out some of those suggestions. Thank you!
---
I don’t get it
---
It is the gift of free fast travel.
---
Way more often than it should for a game that has been out this long. I'm disconnected from the servers (usually in the middle of something long and difficult) every other day. Loads of game glitches and issues, and about once a month some nonsense like this happens where it's completely unplayable.
---
What is this about? From the comments I’m guessing there was some change done that some do not like and that also this is possibley why I can’t seem to get on today cause these people are messing with the servers? Did I get that right and If so, what was the change (I’m gathering it makes pvp even harder which is totally fine with me).
---
Same, I guess I’m not playing tonight.
---
Yup, I spend most of my time doing Public Events and I find that, especially in the longer ones, as the events finish I barely have time to get back to my CAMP and store my stuff before another one fires.
---
Forgot about Nerd Rage. Thank you.
---
I have had the same thing happen a few times lately.  Left and got placed back in the same server 3 times this morning while shopping camps.
---
Thank God, I need to buy more overpriced junk!
---
If I'm prowling for mommysalamis, do I go with casual or roleplay?
---
Me too, anyone know what this is?
---
I got like 50 of em, day 1 of playing. I still haven't tried one. Posts ike this are why.
---
Same error just now
---
Lol if you let people get close enough to regularly tesla spam you then you are doing it wrong.
---
Any idea how long this may last? Have really been enjoyimg the game for the most part...
---
Use this downtime to buy more. You gotta Do the Dew
---
Ps4 here and same issue
---
or hell, like premade phrases and a lot more emotes would go a long way if they really don't want text chat.
---
There was one post from 5 hours ago asking about the servers being down, which I am already aware of. This did not prevent me from being logged into the client or web site, so whatever has happened since I rebooted is a new thing that I don't see anyone talking about. Thanks for the clarification!
---
Never forget the fella who drank Tesla out of one.
---
Throw the first one to force them into a box like backing up or into a corner immediately throw the second.
---
It doesn't really matter what category it falls under as each of the armour perks have the same effect (currently). You just have to make sure you select the right perk to go along with it.
---
Someone like you is how I figured out nukashine existed- than a google got me to the quest after the blackout lol
---
Got me laughing thinking anyone gives a shit if a word is real or not on reddit. 
---
"Just a for your information" is shit grammar btw since you seem to care about that stuff.
---
If you thought you were the first one to make this joke then you've been wrong twice.  The digital shop is "operational" in the literal sense that it is a webpage which you can visit right now.  You cannot however actually log in or create an account to actually buy anything.
---
I had 500 before faschnat and after 700. 20 shouldn't be an issue if you do photo opportunity and the two dailies plus a couple odds and ends (feed the people tea time lode baring). I basically just did every single public event possible. I'm much more selective now. Also... If you don't see an event or have been waiting try server hoping. Usually the events kick off back to back.
---
I actually use Blocker. Couldn’t login to remember what I had. I use CSA if we’re actually fighting in the nuke zone but damage output is so much better in unyielding. Think I’m going to try out so lead lined armor. Thanks for suggestions.
---
I suspect that you are correct.
---
Full ones I do 25 80%-100, i vary the price between 20 and 24 and anything under i dropped
---
You drink it, it changes the colors on your screen, and then you black outand randomly fast travel somewhere on the map.
---
Never carry junk that you need, never.
---
Great suggestion. I didn’t know that. Thank you.
---
Lol percent reduction is better than resist number so heavy combat would be back on top if it doesn’t count lol. I can see them not including it like here’s this armor that you waste your life away getting to be the best now it’s shit. Classic Bethesda move.
---
It's quite a trip!
---
Hahaha
---
8,646,057 mask awarded... 17 Deathclaw masks.
---
That is a great idea!
---
There is actually a petition out to bring survival back now
---
I keep my punch bowl stocked with vintage nukashine. I have to restock 2-3 a day...always makes me giggle a little bit when I see there’s some missing
---
Been a huge Cyber attack here in Australia too, Gov said it wasnt just your typical script kiddie DDOS attack either but a full on high end attack using tools and resources not generally avaliable to the public.
---
They have determined it was a foreign government led attack, my guess it was China, they have been pretty down on Australia of late.
---
Weak troll, block/ignore. Don't feed it.
---
You probably won't get much love for this post, but I got the joke. Lol.
---
Ok so you can start a public team with Building as the goal. Except building in each others CAMPs is disabled while part of a Public team. So how does that work?  Am I missing something here?
---
I've always found the lever action really satisfying to use. That counts as fun right? It just "feels" good to use it.
---
Edit..litterally just got into the forum...theres hope the game will be up soon?
---
Initially couldn't log into the Beth forum then it died, about 20 mins ago it was back to up, but cant login, now a few are able to login.
---
I'd think it's the ID as well
---
Got that glitch the last four times I started the event. Very frustrating buying recall circuit boards for nothing.
---
I am with you, no idea whats happening, and all theses stories are weird, I have held workshops repeatedly to farm up mats etc and no one has ever messed with me.
---
I’ll look into it. Never even heard of cavalier armor. Looking into it right now. Thank you.
---
That is dope.hope that's what it is
---
Would definitely look forward to one; on that not I think a fine gold paint would look good along with engraving done on the receiver.
---
cant fix stupid yo.. let it go... lol
---
I’m not IT but I presume that when a server that authenticates credentials is suffering from an outage, automated error messages would be sent out, but maybe you know, you clicked on that spam email and have a keylogger.
---
Yeah, this one will probably much more difficult as you can go long stretches without finding good gear, assuming your not buying weapons from player vendors
---
Wait. People actually contest workshops? I have yet to see a single person contest one of mine.
---
Anything with a (!) on the icon, plus Riding Shotgun. 
---
Easy and very easy events are 2, medium is 3, hard is 4. Riding shotgun awards 2. 
---
Swarm of Suitors awards 2, but only if you stop the Queen from spawning. 
---
Some examples, I don’t know them all off the top of my head: 
---
Hard events: 
---
Scorched Earth
---
Radiation Rumble
---
Encryptid 
---
Project Paradise
---
Medium: 
---
Line in the Sand
---
Heart of the Swamp
---
Easy/very easy:
---
Feed the People
---
Tea Time
---
Distinguished Guests
---
I'm in a sour mood, being a dick to dicks makes me feel better haha.
---
Server outage.
---
Even with explosive weapons, and anything else. It's so devoid of skill, people just vats you, hit you with explosives. It's all just stealthboy people jumping up and down shooting at each other, it's stupid. I'd rather play any other game than pvp. And just for good measure I didn't use Tesla rifles, and didn't let those bastards get close. It's just the fact that it's braindead that made me quit pursuing it.
---
I might start an alt. Thanks.
---
Service is down for everyone. 
---
https://bethesda.net/en/status
---
Do.... Do you people just not read the subreddit before you post?
---
I'll state right here, I'm being sarcastic, just making sure you understand that.  I'm really just commenting on how unnecessary some people can react immediately by posting first on reddit, THEN checking reddit posts only to see 300 posts about the same issue there.
---
But seriously, I'll be slipping back to check occasionally anyway.
---
Yeah servers might down or something, do a quick search and see if anyone else has mentioned it? good luck
---
If you need some supplies let me know..
---
If you are on pc
---
Problems at Bethesda. Https://Bethesda.net/status
---
Offline mode should reaaaaaally be a thing.
---
Alt F4 helps closing the game if you can't get to the menu normally
---
Did you know?
---
If you block these folks then you won't ever be bothered by them again.
---
At least in the sub.
---
Bethesda doesn't like to release skins for weapons people actually use.  But you can get a battle mace skin for your sledgehammer, hunting rifle, one for the death tambo or plenty of skins for flamers and laser rifles. Shotguns, mainly pumps, got several.  
---
The handmade has a couple skins, and the gauss weapons did get one skin which IMO isn't much of an upgrade over the standard one. The Fixer got jack, the LMG nada, the Gatling Plasma, the list goes on.  I think there is a .50 cal skin.. a raider one maybe?
---
I'm pretty sure during low traffic times the amount of active servers is reduced, it's a guess but would make sense. Otherwise waiting 10 seconds to hop has never failed me during active hours.
---
By “any other” do you mean TES
---
You have this on the clip board by now I’m guessing? Lol
---
Ah. Sounds obnoxious. Time to put some in my bowl.
---
I remember claiming a workshop, all seemed quiet so I made a workbench to scrap shit. *SMASH* *SMASH*. Two melee attacks to the back of my head and I'm dead. Nah man, that ain't cool. Sneak mode on, 10mm with 50% armour ignorance, 10% extra damage when aiming down sights and my classical wit made sure that every time that player tried to 'seek revenge' he couldn't. 20 minutes later and several hundred caps lost, he eventually fucks off. Fool me once, not cool man. Try and fool me twice, try.
---
Best is that he was using a bloodied build with melee. I was using a 'I enjoy using these weapons, these perk cards fit to that' build. Was quite satisfying.
---
thats why i felt pretty lucky for that amount of modules
---
it's just people being salty they can't grief.
---
Lol FN dupers hate me......
---
Sidenote: Bethesda should replace the settlers and raiders with the Grinders and duper’s and let the real story of 76 unfold.
---
Grinders for Life!!!!!
---
Shouldn’t be atom shop though
---
I was minding my own business just grubbin some flux from someone elses nuke zone, walked into the forest area near prime and there it was, just lurking around. First time i ever daw one and i was all by my lonesome. Is he suppossed to drop anything cool? I just got some poopy legendary : /
---
usually you dont even know its contested until youre looking at the respawn screen...
---
youre either scarry looking or lucky...
---
Yes, you are a bully and your YouTube channel demonstrates that.
---
They delete everyone’s accounts and everyone is starting from scratch because too many of us are at end game already. Let the grind begin, oh and all those legacies and B2525 , gone. I know I would be done with the game, and possibly Bethesda in general.
---
Lmao thanks, legit thought you thought it was a straight up good idea just for this specific Info. 
---
Upvotes all around.
---
1.) You can only play the German version of the game.
---
2.) A child is in the room. He thinks he is the one playing, but his controller is dead. If he realizes the truth, you lose.
---
3.) Every time your character jumps, you must jump in real life.
---
Yeah man my post said hell in a subreddit for a Mature rated game and got removed🤷🏻‍♂️
---
Set up a vendor with small items like canned food for 25 caps with a note next to it that says "Tip Jar - Buy something if you like my camp."
---
I like seeing the garbage they say, it amuses me.
---
lol
---
Im so fucking bored with no servers..
---
I’ve never used PA but it may be fun to switch it up some and see what I can do with it.
---
I’m having fun watching the posts pop up....and then.......just disappear lol
---
Same here ps4
---
Yeah Same here I tried to see if fallout was back up but instead I got the $LoginError
---
Fuck id forgo my 1* lead pipe to see that at least once
---
At what point can you start earning these? I'm just now doing the quest lines for both factions. Do you have to completely finish this before you can start earning notes?
---
The Fixer is basically a skin for the combat rifle, with a few upgrades.
---
Ps4 down, USA. 3:0:9
---
Correct you need to complete the wastelanders storyline before you can earn notes
---
Well after testing everything you said, except the m79, idk how to test reload speed differences in NW, here is what I found.
---
Yes you are right. Pistol perks, expect damage perks, do effect the subs, both the 10mm and .45, but this wouldn't effect the ttk. 
---
Just like the pistol perks, the non damage rifle perks do effect shotguns. But again wouldn't really effect ttk.
---
Tank killer and longshot both say rifles in their description but doesn't specify autos or non auto. Just rifles. The game looks to see if your weapon is listed as a rifle then applies the perks. Tank killer is the exception because it specifically says to exclude ars but for some reason, even in adventure, it still effects ars.
---
Yeah.... I'm not seeing that IGN news literally anywhere. No one saying it on Twitter, no one from IGN saying anything on it, no reports, no other Reddit posts, just you. So.... where's ye source? Hell, I even looked up their IGN line-up... Bethesda was never on it. So.................................
---
Had the reverse happen to me (Level 62) the other day.  Chillin' at my camp by Top of the World modifying some power armor and a Level 200-something drops a bag of about 40 plans, including ultracite plans, jet pack plans, and other great stuff.  Before I could grab my mic and send a heart emote he was gone.  Made my day there.
---
Ransomware?
---
I jumped on the balloons waiting for someone to shoot them from under me.
---
I felt so bad for my boyfriend when I convinced him to play some GTA Online with me.

"Someone just killed me! I was just standing there. I didn't do anything to him!"

["Yeah, they do that."](https://youtu.be/Kd82puG0D5w)

And of course me going back to Fallout 76 after playing GTA Online for months pretty much had me in [mode](https://i.imgur.com/1gwJ7MW.jpg?1) for the first hour whenever I saw someone else.
---
My two shot explosive railway does more damage but I can normally one shot an enemy with my instigating railway. I have to shoot them twice with my two shot explosive.
---
Did Bethesda try turning off the degradation and back on yet? 😂😂
---
Does this happen often? I'm new...
---
Do those things actually work?
---
I'm level 24, wearing the cowboy outfit and a tophat.
---
I put it in the box at the Overseer's camp.
---
You hit “paste” and re-read before you hit “post” didn’t you lol
---
I’m not sure if workshop PVP will be effected
---
They’re just mentally ill tbh
---
*3.) Every time your character jumps, you must jump in real life.*
---
I'm too lazy for that
---
Ooo you gotta make a hard build, like a nerd with no strength and perception or a low intelligence/luck build
---
As someone who started with Wastelanders release, I feel like this has been around since atleast then, I've no idea how the algorithms work for joining servers, but its possible it tried to put you back into your previous server IF there is still a free slot, with the playercount dropping off over the last few weeks since fasnacht ended and most people have finished grinding, there are less people on (steam for example was averaging 16k per day, is now below 9k) and as such, servers are not being populated as fast, hence why you can be put back into your previous server?   
---
I really don't know what the answer is, but it seems to fit with the player numbers dropping off.
---
Yeah, I’ve got several mutations with those two being in the pool. I haven’t tried Lifegiver as I’ve not read great things about it late game but I’ll check into it and see how beneficial it will be. Thank you.
---
Fair enough
---
\^  
---
There are dozens of posts being made about this, most of them are getting remove because they're redundant. [This is the main post about it](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/hbkxx0/are_the_severs_down/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x).
---
It’s probably my fault. I picked up a bunch of toilet paper yesterday and put it in my vending machine for $12,000. Now someone is hacking into their system to look for coupons to buy it. I’m sorry. I won’t do it again. I’ll lower the price when they fix the servers. XD
---
This is a great idea.
---
A mini nuka world group would be cool.
---
Made my day with this... I do miss nv. If there was any game I could pick to remaster.. this would be close or at the very top of my list.
---
I think it's all in good fun. Before I logged off last night, I accidentally drank some in this exact situation. I'm looking forward to some fun whenever I can log in again.
---
its like a mini game at this point.. lol
---
Usually on the fusion core producing ones, I’m camped near the thunder mountain one and I usually grab it first thing after logging in, I get a few contests on that one every other day, the poseidon one is much more prone to contests, since usually low level players take it over and the “pvp” crowd usually swarm in.
---
I had called it quits when they stopped player traders by giving us a max weight limit. I came back because my friends talked me into it when Wastelanders came out. Then I got suckered into FO1st. That unlimited scrap box was too nice.
---
I used it and it sent me to a place I actually wanted to go
---
Yeah no weapons and armor from vendors would make sense. Though I could not keep them for long anyway.
---
I’m almost 80 and I have very excess scrap lead/steel, and gunpowder so i go up to levels 1-25 and I’ll just ask you what weapon they use most and drop them 500-1000 of that ammo
---
Just put damage mod on backpack but I think I’ve got enough possum badges to get lead lines to swap out. I think this will be the first thing I try. Great advice. Thank you.
---
You should at least get them in a team and then go to them when they fast travel.
---
Bloodied explosive .50
---
Something kinda like the imposter sheep squatch outfit but with the deathclaw mask and a deathclaw gauntlet...oh yeah it’s all coming together
---
Spock??
---
Fair enough but my granddad (62 years old) is retired and has over 11,000 combined hours in Destiny and Destiny 2. He manages a clan of over 100 people as well and schedules raids near daily, as well as chases World's First clears. And you better believe he's skillful at it too, even with the thick calluses on his hands from his many, many years of physical labor.
---
Multiple Services can be run on a single server, if you take a shelf out of a bookcase, all the books on that shelf are going to fall off.
---
I swear I remember BGS was trying to fight server hopping from the beginning. I even noticed early on things like trying to server hop just to be confronted the same 3 scorchbeasts I was trying to escape, or coming across the same animals I killed. That's why I was always skeptical when it asked if you wanted change servers if your camp couldn't be placed.
---
The most fun weapon I've used was a Two Shot Plasma Shotgun that I nicknamed the GoopyBoi because I liked watching the 16 balls of hot goop turn things into moore goop
---
Their a link or something to read these notes?
---
The problem is I am legitimately down for fallout 76, stop rubbing salt into my wounds :(
---
If anything they’d make a larger bulge a Atomic Shop option.
---
One day I logged in minding my own business at my camp and 3 guys came and kept shooting at me and throwing explosives and calling airstrikes on me. One of them was below my level..."the baiter" I assume. Then two high level guys kept hiding in the area with their chamelion armor. So I fast travelled away...they followed me and kept hitting me with melee and wouldn't get out of my way so I could attack anything for fear of hitting one of them back which is what they wanted obviously. Annoying!
---
&gt;Some better lv up system passed lv 50. Look I get that you want to balance the game. But after lv 50 it feels like there is no point in leveling up. There is nothing that actually makes you stronger. At that point your lv is just a number. Maybe increase the weapon/armor lv on stuff to 100? Anything really that makes it worth going passed lv 50.
---
Legendary perks are the key to this, and they pulled them from the next update due to community feedback, so hopefully what they come back with is better thought out.
---
As to rest of what you said, there are numerous bugs, If we collected them all I'm sure it would be pages and pages of bugs right now.
---
Probably not tonight the way its looking
---
Wait... do you seriously  think that three star enemies dropping one star gear is just a bug that they haven't figured out how to fix yet?  That's not how loot tables work... all they would have to to is remove one and two stars from the pool just as easily as they add two and three stars to it.
---
They're doing it this way on purpose because it controls how many three star pieces enter the game and by extension how many good three star pieces are out there.  If they ever "fixed" something like this it would just be balanced out by having as many fewer two and three stars spawning.
---
Bugs need a fixing before the buldge issue gets addressed.
---
Curing it might move the clock to zero though.
---
I don't know though.
---
Sounds like a simple system to prevent getting disease bombed.
---
[Totally down!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UUMTV7YYj2c)
---
Legit info.. Upvoted.
---
I think they got seriously hacked.  This outage might be a long one.
---
I’m over here just like...
---
“OH! There’s another one!” 
---
*goes to see if anyone commented yet*
---
“Damn! Someone beat me to it! Eh, it got removed already anyway”
---
Id prefer more mobs myself.. nice to pick up some XP farming that place..
---
Im bummed the NPC they added removed like what was that 5 mobs?
---
awesome early/mid farming spot even after youre leveled beyond the mobs
---
https://twitter.com/CaptainShishou/status/1273705357311868928?s=19
---
This work I can find more?
---
It really just depends, ive grinded the game for hours in one day and i don't have any problems except for the occasional lag spike, other days I'll get a blue screen, overall the game has run fine for me, not saying this game doesn't have its problems tho, cause it definitely does. But it runs fine for me 95% of the time I'm on, unless something like this happens, cause im on Ps4 and it seems we're all experiencing this shit 🤷‍♂️😩
---
people are miserable and they want to make others miserable
---
Have you done the nukashine quest? Go to a station and have a look on the bulletin board for the frat party poster if you haven't.
---
VATS has always been problem for me. I just exit our VATS and it should work as intended.
---
This, and the fact that every hoard boss, no matter what region they’re in,  are ALWAYS under leveled. Most of the three stars I see are hoard bosses, but it doesn’t matter because even if they’re in the Bog they will never be max level so there’s no chance at getting max level gear from them. Besides scrip there is no point in chasing down some hoard boss, especially when it makes you search three different locations across the region.
---
I agree. For now I use a heart emoji plus thumbs down.
---
Same here on Xbox One X in North America.
---
Was thinking about a max endurance survivalist type build. Think it would be  bad idea to focus too much on weapon damage for a single type anyway sense I'll be switching so much.
---
This what I got
---
I think it gets slightly bigger with every level. At least it feels like my bulge budget increased a tiny bit. It’s barely noticeable, but just take a picture of a brand new char and a lvl 500 and you will notice! Also they finally need to add a bulge perk card. They’ve promised it since Fallout 4!
---
If I had a nukashine for everytime someone posted this trying to be edgy or funny.......I'd have alot of nukashine!
---
Yeah im on ps4 as well, its been about 5 hours since its gone down. Apparently a lot of Bethesda games went down around the same time. Hope it's fixed soon...
---
Ah I guess you enjoy pulling your hair out too. 😀 Welcome.
---
You can check the status of server at the link above at any time.  Still down as I am writing this, 2055 EST.
---
Bethesda got hacked. All their services are down. It means nothing really bc it's happening to everyone as the servers are down
---
I dropped my nukes to avoid the main players and hit the super mutant spawn north side of town. That way the critters would still respawn and the event would continue with only minor added difficulty.
---
Be glad you didn't pay $200 😭😭😭
---
Does anyone know if the servers are down ?
---
Asking for a friend....
---
How about A TRADE SCREEN WITH CONFIRM BUTTONS ON BOTH SIDES why is that so hard it makes total sense and we've been asking for it since launch. If you can't do it at least explain to us why so we stop asking.
---
Usually the first thing I do whenever I come across an error message is to google it.
---
In this case, servers are temporarily down probably because a careless elbow and some coffee. Nothing to do but wait.
---
Severs still down on ps4
---
Nope I got 2 alone
---
I need a hoagie
---
They tried to make and accurate buldge for you but the inverted mesh caused this outage we are in
---
LoL I'm unfortunately not that text savvy so I don't really know what you mean... But from what I think you mean, no I legitimately typed this an posted it.. Why do you ask??
---
&gt;Execute order 66
---
Okay well I'm gathering that the recently activated two factor authentication may have resulted in some kind of meltdown, so it is possible that all logins have been disabled temporarily, if not the entire authentication system.
---
After remembering there is a Bethesda server status portal, I can now see that the entire accounts system is in outage status.
---
It would have been nice if the moderators or whoever would have posted this link and mentioned that accounts were down for now.
---
[**https://bethesda.net/en/status**](https://bethesda.net/en/status)
---
Thanks for your help
---
So glad I just renewed 1st today, getting what I paid for......
---
I think they all went home for the evening tomorrow's another day.
---
Same here ps4 2 different errors in one day wow!!.. Never seen this on any game before. Come on I know the game was bad when it came out hell I didnt play it till last week but come on cut us a break help us out a little bit bethesda!!!
---
Hmm, yes. Let's fight bethesda by playing their game. Oh, and lets hand out shiny guns that rapid fire mirv pods, that will make those people wanna stop playing right.
---
If they actually wanted to make their voices heard, they'd flood the customer support/feedback platforms.
---
Oh, so I am not the only one, ok. Gotta say goodbye to that 200 gold
---
Ok time to make this very simple, so maybe you can see where your fundamental misunderstanding lies.
---
Bethesda has proven repeatedly that all they really care about here is maximizing profit. If this really were so easy for Bethesda to do as you seem to believe, and the player interest was actually there, *they would have already done it.*
---
They haven't, because one or (most likely) both of those is not the case.
---
I was commenting to RF_Huntr
---
No not really most times If the servers are gonna be down its for maintenance and they normally let you know ahead of time
---
I wish it was easier to trick people into drinking it..
---
love a good ol punchbowl FT
---
We have a Bugthesda employee here boys and girls
---
It just covers up all the rust, etc and puts a candy cane striping on the claws
---
Just get yourself a bigass gun.  The ultimate replacement for lack of a bulge!
---
The best way for mods would be just make it private with a mod only character so u couldn’t bring a character boosted from mods to public. But in the long run it’s more of just play fallout 4 for mods
---
What are they holding my Xbox for ransom??? Lamo??!!
---
Nice. 15 others got lucky too then.. :-) Well it seemed like that to me anyhow... No luck I guess.
---
I have a level 3 I want to turn back to level 1 also. I don’t think you can rank down cards either
---
What stats?
---
I love seeing it in vendors for a few caps... often ill say: "these prices are outrageous" then buy and drink it and see where the world takes me.
---
Get the Excavator armor at level 25. Gives +100 carry weight and good protection. Hang around higher level players and talk to them. You will get great advice and free stuff by the train load.
---
Yea. I like the way the fixer looks. But I could still accidentally scrip it if I’m not paying attention (which I know would totally be my fault). But I never have to worry about scripping my TSE handmade.
---
Thank you very much! It took me a while to remember that site existed.
---
There were like 100 comments talking about exactly what was going on before you ever commented to ask.  You could've read them.
---
Aww bless. So sweet.
---
once Im leveled I usually carry one with an ammo my main guns dont use for low level areas or tagging legendary mobs in events..
---
-eta:
---
not really relevant to your post I guess.. but its all I got..
---
I just hit level 80 and this is my first playthrough. So far my funnest weapon a Vampires gatling gun. It's not really practical in most situations but now that I'm at a level where me and my teammate can handle scorched beasts it's my go-to weapon.
---
It just feels right shooting giant winged terrors with a big gatling gun that feels and sounds like a proper anti-aircraft weapon. Plus since it has a slower fire rate than its 5mm machine gun cousin or it's energy variant the Gatlin laser I just hold down my trigger the whole fight lobbing round after round without a reload.
---
Ideally I'll find and exploding variant one day but the Vampires effect is great in that  I rarely have to stimpack. 
---
You really feel like John Rambo laying loud thumping gatlin rounds into Scorched Beast Queen!
---
Lol what’s going on here. Sounds like a case of smol pp power. 
---
A hit of Daddy-O (or several) might help!
---
Lamo gotcha still sorta new to reddit so my apologies!!
---
From what I tested just need 110 rad resistance. Back back will give 90, just need to pull 20 more else’s where whatever thru perks or armour mods 👍🏼
---
Good luck
---
mine too, automatic billing is up
---
I always look for low levels to give stims to and my 1 star good stuff I don't  want to hold on to and can bring myself to script. I also dump all my ammo I dont need for them if they want it, regardless if they are a mule or not. I have them as well and always need something on them and appreciate what others give.
---
No perk cards at all. 
---
Can’t accept any gifts from friendly players. 
---
Only play solo, no teams
---
No problem, I don’t profess to be a genius and I’m sure some of my builds have flaws I haven’t realized myself but Fallout and Elder Scrolls can be fairly confusing for new players
---
I used a vampiric assaultron sword for low lvl areas
---
lol OP’s username right now.

Boo-urns, just tried to log in and saw the error, and now I see this has been ongoing for 5 hours? Get it together Toddy How.
---
Time to fire up Animal Crossing.
---
i agree.
---
meet my pipe missile launcher.
---
Lots of thanks! (for the info)
---
No one has been banned for underground bases. What's going on right now is because some PvPers are salty they can't 4v1 new players anymore they're DDOS'ing the servers.
---
If you get people that know how to use cover well it can be pretty fun but I haven't seen that very often. I like running my handmade without using Vats depending on they fight. I ran around with an Anti Armor faster fire rate 10mm pistol a few times just to make things more interesting. PvP just like the game can be as fun as you make it. Find some friends and have a fight with noting but explosive bows and no pvp gear. Try out some weird weapons and tactics.
---
Agreed pvp trolls deserve a quick kick in the rear.
---
Some mods are plan bound, usually night vision scopes, prime mods, etc.  you cannot learn all mods through scrapping.
---
not 100% sure, but i think some of them are only available from npc vendors. also, the prime recievers are probably also only aquireable from drops. could be wrong though.
---
&gt; guess I have to be productive now. 
---
No reason to do something crazy...
---
If they do the perk load out before legendary perks they are gonna have to do a whole other update to implement legendary perks into the perk loadout . Which may not seem like a bad idea but knowing Bethesda it would break the game again
---
I didn't think that, but I wasn't about to read all the posts here. Sorry I hurt your butt so hard with my dumb observation, but I guess everyone needs a place to direct their anger, so feel free to dump it on me since I'm a higher up at Bethesda.
---
Power Fist! 
---
It's one of those super iconic Fallout Weapons and just looks cool, also 4.4k Damage per light attack :D
---
a three star lead pipe is still a lead pipe. 
---
I recently nuked white springs and wound up with about 10x 3* items, mostly leather and wood armor. I don't think there was even 1 item i did not scrap, and I and saving good items for my toons or my sons toons.
---
Why am I paying for something I can't play
---
👍
---
I want to laugh because you said they’ve been “down on Australia” but nothing else you said can be joked about. How quickly we could go from complaining about Fallout 76 being offline to living in the Fallout world... well we won’t actually be living but you guys get it.
---
Don’t u craft the whole torso with jet pack not just mod a torso
---
On one hand, I love to drink out of other peoples punch bowls because it feels good to come back to your camp and see if someone has drunk from your punch bowl, but I definitely calculate whether I have time to deal with a nucha shine black out before I do now.
---
Me
---
Some mods are plan only. Hunting rifle has quite a few scopes,receivers, etc. that are that way.
---
It’s a dick move. 
---
That said, I have my camp right next to Vault 76 and have a nuka cola machine and several punch bowls with nukashine up in front. Still a dick move. But also funny. For me.
---
The thing is a lot of the things I listed have been issues since launch. I just got back on last week after not playing for over a year due to how buggy it was, and though it has improved I figured surely they would have resolved these by now. Most of those are pretty serious issues.
---
seems weekly - just sitting around and wondering when servers are coming back, or if everything is entirely fried this time XD
---
Didn’t you just say that? :)
---
Rename it.   At the very least I put a "\*" in front of the name of all of the items that I want to keep.  All of the \* Weapons are then listed first in the list when sorted alphabetically.  Also makes it quicker to swap weapons.
---
No it’s only you and no one else. Prepare for your account to be purged soon.
---
You need signs calling this thing out, lmfao.  I would wander around your camp for ages looking for it hahaha.
---
You should! Whenever I run out of things to do, I'll drink a Nukashine and then see if I can find my way back to my camp without checking the map.
---
Are the servers down?
---
As I am aware VATS is currently broken and nearly useless I would say I am very up to date on how the legendary effects behave in the game.
---
That does not change the fact that PVP effects are rolling for a NON PVP crafted weapon, they should not be; period.
---
I think the idea for the limit is that such a janky weapon would struggle to fire heavier rounds.
---
Yep! 3 * actually in front.
---
Yeah, recently DDoS attacks have kinda spiked.
---
Have been getting the log in error for close to 2 hours now.
---
in all the times Ive posted
---
&gt; check the fo76 subreddit and see if anyone has posted about it
---
not one OP has questioned the fact that this IS the fo76 subreddit.. lol
---
*Only play solo, no teams*
---
&gt;!I have no friends so the challenge would be finding a team !&lt;
---
Out of the loop, what changes were made that is causing some people to whine?
---
Er um sandwich
---
So your saying theres a chance...
---
[errrmygerrrsh](https://bethesda.net/en/status)
---
Completely agree, never understood why they got rid of it anyways.
---
awww shucks
---
Bethesda accidentally dropped their servers when they should’ve dropped the trailers
---
Are the servers down?😂
---
Don’t be a bitch about it
---
Are the saying boo... or boo-urns?
---
Maybe.
---
Are you a Mister Handy?
---
Same here on the PC. They must be down. edit: yep there are issues:  [https://bethesda.net/en/status](https://bethesda.net/en/status)
---
Furious Swing Speed Shishkebab or Furious Swing Speed Combat Knife, I’m a bloodied stealth rifle build with low strength, but sometimes it’s fun to take out a flaming katana or knife and kill low level shite with it. Sprinting full speed at an enemy and power attacking it with the shishkebab while not even stopping is oddly satisfying. (Like I’m running at it, I swing and hit it, and just kept on running, never stopped running once... Like Hijikata Toshizo from FGO. “Slice and Advance!!”)
---
Or another weapon I’d choose is the orbital strike grenade, sometimes it’s just fun to nuke something from orbit... like a single squirrel. (I love dropping them on single enemies and then look at my buddy and say “...I might have gotten them. I’m not sure.”)
---
Oh. I realized I wasn’t banned when I came straight here, but what is 4v1? You mean that 4 people could attack a loner if they were a team? That would be an amazing relief for us lone wanderers! Bethesda needs better password protection including numbers, symbols, and upper AND lowercase letters (I don’t know what ddosing is either, so it’s just better to have a strong password to protect against it).
---
I was saying boo-urns.
---
Yes. My name is vlad.
---
Half-Life Two and a Half (Life)
---
Me, too.  What are we gonna do?!! I don’t play ANYTHING else...
---
I’m not sure I would call it a high quality game mode, but it’s definitely fun lmao. I had an absolute blast learning the game and playing around with all of the weapons and nukes and stuff. It’s just a long way from accessible. I think that is the biggest issue. It doesn’t really make sense if you aren’t already a fallout player, which isn’t a crime, but is definitely a reason that it hasn’t blown up. I think with a little tweaking to the way that the perk system works, and a little more server stability, they’d have a fantastic piece of side content for veterans and newcomers alike. That being said, it’s a vast improvement on the current adventure pvp system, and I think that restricting pvp like this is a fantastic way to side step their complete inability to balance pve and pvp at the same time lmao
---
Thanks man
---
PVP effects rolling for a CRAFTED non PVP server weapon = BUG.
---
Well shit. If that works, too I'm guna have to make a ton! lol
---
I just love how it gives you a reason to use those worthless .38 rounds you always get that you never use and end up putting in your vendor for months and then finally drop them at the feet of a new player along with a heavily modified Pipe Gun that you got during the Mole Miners event.
---
I've moved mine to the Pristine Nuka Cola Fridge in the same building as my vendors.
---
Knowing Bethesda, very unlikely 😩😂🤷‍♂️
---
Power Fist + Bloody Mess = A Bloody Good Time. The deathclaw gauntlet is a suitable alternative as well.
---
Just to let you know that anything you add to your cooler counts towards your base budget.
---
Holy shit that was you, OMG I can't believe I found you. Thank for the help but I am all good I am level 7 now and got some grip on the game, GG my dude and thanks for the suit, it kept me rads free for the time I used it lol. Keep the Stims and Phantoms, I just bought this game and want to experience all of it on my own but thanks for the help!!!!!
---
Considering how heavy ordinances wight like a chunk of your carry weight it's absolutely bullocks how piss poor there damage is ntm the weapon degradation should be like 50-100 shots not 10.
---
I have a complete rolling pin and shovel collection of 3*'s. I just need the camp budget to show them off. They take up most of one of my toon's storage space.
---
I see, thank you!
---
Hey Scottish buddy!  I remember you!
---
Yet somehow you can manage to make it fire .50 caliber rounds (with the Bolt-Action at least)
---
I did a SBQ fight then travelled to a players camp to dump legendaries in my stash.
---
I looked at the vendors just because and bought the mounted SBQ plan for 10k.
---
When I went to read it I had 2...oops
---
I have the same thing but it’s a level 25 now. Been grinding with it in hopes that I can slowly respec it since I fudged up and don’t want to waste levels.
---
I use the Imposter Sheepsquach Outfit and Unstoppable Monster with my Deathclaw Mask.
---
Before the game was released i was fairly active on bethesdas 76 forum, excitedly speculating with everyone. There was one guy who would pop up on every thread insisting that what bethesda was creating was a griefers paradise. He would go into long detail on how he planed on exploiting it and fuck with people. I counter argued with him several times as i had watched and read basicly everything there was to know.
---
That guy could not have been more wrong about this game
---
I think that would actually make for a good legendary perk. Add in some usable bash damage as well.
---
Can you smell without a nose?
---
Have you tried bashing with it? I'm wondering if that applies the effect. Based on Bethesda's track record, I'm 50/50 on whether it does.
---
Man I wish I had that kinda luck I'm somewhere upwards of near 100 and I've only gotten 1 tolerable piece which is a Unyielding +1 Perc 20% WWR, at this point i'd be happy to just get some 1-2\*'s just for placeholders so I can sell heavy bos set
---
I'm back. Looks like I won't be playing some more tonight. This does have a certain sense of dark humor irony about it. As does this statement, "In hindsight, everything is 2020".
---
Same issue here too also on the PS4...I was playing earlier and the game crashed on me...
---
I just thought it was funny way of saying bumpkin.
---
That was my first guess. It seems the most likely culprit.
---
I always just use them in a combat rifle chambered in .38 so they get used fast
---
Imposter Deathclaw outfit you mean?

Be careful what you wish for. I've had a gamer wife for several decades now. It's great most of the time, but sucks a lot other times. Balance in all things, I suppose.
---
What’s happening now? I’m a bit out of the loop
---
I kill almost all enemy's with my pipe gun. If it's I lvl 80 scorch beast then I use the radium, queen gets its mouth washed out with the prime handmade.
---
Yeah, that would be cool and they could still add that because the event would only be active one week every year so all that other time those mobs would be there
---
Edit: misspelled mobs
---
Wait, the servers are down? I can’t play tonight anyways, so at least I’m not missing anything.
---
Damn the white knights hit you hard, I can't believe those freelance shills are still so faithful, cult of the moth man ain't got shit on the cult of bethesda.
---
FO76 no longer is a thing
---
Damn, you’re right, that’s stupid.
---
The player base for 76 dips all the time, I'm sure, as other diversions come along. It's always here, though, waiting for you. 
---
I took a long break for Death Stranding and then for Witcher 3, but here I am back on FO76. 
---
I have The Last of Us 2 pre-ordered, but I'll be taking FO76 breaks during it because that's such a tense and heavy game.
---
good guy here!
---
Its just the truth. Having a .0001 chance to get a god-roll item is what is keeping the majority of people playing consistently. People dont like to face this fact but its true. For the hardcore-play 5+hrs a day group of players, this game is just a slot machine, drip feeding dopamine a little bit at a time. Just like all MMO's/Mobile Games
---
They are its dumb they've been for hours just in time for me to get home from work and exercising ):

---
Makes sense in a way.  Have you ever tried building a gun, let alone an automatic one. Gun designs stick around for a long time in the real world and are copied over an over.
---
Where did i say it’s a bug? It’s an issue they havent acknowledged is what I said.
---
You missed my point on the whole Fasnacht thing but I really don’t feel like getting into this with you. Please read what I said clearly.
---
Magic weapons deal increased damage, you don't need to use VATS for it to work. Watch [this video](https://youtu.be/vno3BICsakI?t=459) and [this one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BtsB55vH0g0). The first video literally compares a Bloodied Gauss with +33% VATS hit chance and a Bloodied Gauss with FFR at the point I have bookmarked and the first deals more damage than the latter.
---
Do you know how to spell Appalachia?
---
How about fixing the Stanley skin for the Grognaks so I can use it or at least make it so we can remove the skin and be able to use it again. I didn’t trade a legacy for a weapon that I can’t even use now. This is why I haven’t used atoms on weapon skins anymore.
---
That’s a good way to put it
---
RUDE
---
.. have a thumbs up.
---
Right, that's what bloodied. 38 combat rifles and fixers are for.
---
That’s smart. I might need to do that with one of my Combat Rifles.
---
Haha that is funny and well said!
---
The best advice I can give (since I don't power/meta build) is play the game like a normal Fallout game (well... Like Fallout 4...).
---
Most of the base stuff and events will work fine for you that way.
---
If you need more, look up some builds online. They may help make you more powerful.
---
Of course
---
There appeared to be what looked like a "black" skin for the combat rifle (maybe the Fixer too) in the latest datamine.

Put it on your cook pot the one with the fire ring, I drank outta mine by accident many times.

So what is it like to be at that high of level? I'm a level 40 and still suck at this game lol. Is being level 500+ a walk in the park or do you still find the game challenging enough not to become boring?

In general FO76 is my first new game in quite a while. I'm in my 30s and usually stick to my economic/civ/total war style sims. I've been playing the same games for 10 years but just getting really crazy with building mods. I only started FO76 because my brother got me on it. I totally feel like I suck at this game but it's still fun!

unfortunately there is no shortage of people with weak minds and open wallets

It does take some time for them to change the status so that’s a fair point.

Unless it changed with Wastelanders, and I don't think it did, each point of INT gives you a few more % XP. It was reported incorrectly when the game was released that INT doesn't affect XP but I can assure you it did for the longest and should still. It's easy enough to test, kill any enemy, eat a mentats or berry mentats, kill an identical enemy as the first. It will be a small change but it adds up over time and more buffs to INT like from Unyielding, underarmor, base stats, Brain Fungus soup or (INT food buffs don't stack at all) cooked Scorchbeast Brain, and so on. The biggest one after Unyielding is Egg Head. And oddly it's a mutation people actively avoid b/c it hurts carry weight while they seek out Marsupial which hurts leveling and then they can't figure out why they're leveling more slowly.
---
I'm on PS4 as well. If you're not insistent on doing it all yourself, I can loan you low level stuff for leveling, share cards, help get a backpack, and get you started on some max level gear.
---

A better way to phrase it is that RNG isn’t game design. It is the explicit lack of game design.

---
Bethesda: 'hey someone new just purchased our game, let's show them what we are really about'
---
Mostly it's because people are cheapscapes and want a free fast travel. You just happen to be in the area they want to go to.
---
almost 7 hrs actually
---
I did too! 
---
My favorite part of the fallout series has always been npcs, and side quests. When the game first came out and I read they didn’t have these things I didn’t bother.
---
I honestly didn’t even know there was an update to add these things tho I’ve just really been craving the fallout experience. I’ve played fo4 so many times I just thought screw it and got 76. And I’ve been quite happy with the world so far. I thought it would feel empty and it doesn’t. Quite a nice surprise. Unlike the servers right now:(
---
I havent played COD since they moved away from WWII now that you mention it...
---
I kind of got on before. There was a HUD but no world, and I could open the map, but there were no marked locations on it. Weird.
---
I was able to grab my bullion and everything seems normal
---
Yeah that sounds crazy to do once you know what kind of nonesense lurks out there.
---
I can 1v4, I am against this change but there are many other ways to kill you guys. :)
---
I like this one. No perk cards. You can still level up but you can’t use the perks. Also I like the idea if only being able to use weapons you find until they break. That would mean you wouldn’t need to pick up junk either. No sneaking and no fast traveling. Also no buying ammo, if you run out then you better have a melee Weapon. 
---
I could go on further but I think that’s good for now.
---
I’ve been doing an explosives build myself and I can safely say.. it’s horrible. But at least it’ll be **less** horrible once I get my hands on dynamite.
---
They should add it to the weekly endeavor's while they have them.  Say consume 3.

Wouldnt a pipe shotgun just be a hollow pipe, shotgun shell and a hammer.

Depending on range and the shot type.. They can do far more damage than a bullet any day of the week.. Also there are far more different types of shot than pellet.

Why can't shotguns use Solids..

---
Do we want Bethesda to give the perk loadouts the same treatment that the legendary perks have had?
---
I'd rather they take their time and get it right first go. Big ask but who knows, anything could happen.
---
 I could ask you the same thing.

---
Love this!! I thought they should have added a pvp group finder. It would have taken very minimal coding. They could make it so it shows general areas of pvp teams and you are flagged to all groups on that server for pvp. Give 1 bullion, 5 scrip, and or chance at 1-3* legendary. Instant griefers gone.

Oh god. Put a warning on that. Lol!

Seriously, that's in interesting sub, though.
---
Pipe Revolvers and Bolt actions are also underated. 
---
Fact they double dip with pistol and rifle perk cards means you can get them very high in damage.

I've seen people on a bloodied build get one around 700 damage on weapon. That is very respectable.

I agree.
---
I play passive and as a rule anybody who tries to goad me into a scrap gets the mothman dance. Sends a clear message and hopefully rustles a few vulture feathers. For me, the Fallout experience has always been defined by its atmospheric tension and I find PVP to be the least immersive gameplay element in any game so I feel the more restrictions they impose to protect their player base, the better. That said, since PVP is an integral part of the Fallout universe now there should definitely be dedicated servers to serve the PVP crowd.
---
People keep saying bring survival mode back. People straight up dint like the mode and if that was not true, then they wouldnt have removed it in the first place. NW exist for that very reason. NW is determined on how good you are a stealth and wether or not you can actually aim (yes this isnt something most Fallout players know how to do, because we have an assisted aim bot since the 1st game). This is even more true seeing people using aim bots on PC. The sooner you guys realize that most of us are a crowd of single player gamers, the more sense Bethesdas decisions make sense. Now, I believe NW should be updated more often. The mode needs atleast 4 more maps and more equipment to bring up the novelty again.
---
People need to get over the fact that a huge majority of people do not care do not want or do not participate in PVP. Why waste dev resources on something that a handful of people want, then have to constantly balance.
---
Great system? It was trash, and totally unbalanced. Keep chugging the kool aid

If you find a way to kill Ward, I'll trade you a B2525 fixer for the knowledge
---
Do quests, do events, kill-loot-scrap your way across the wasteland, plan your build at [nukesdragons](https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks), do your dailies. Play a bunch. 
---
Set some goals for your character. I launched 54 nukes in seven days (51 against the queen) and 21 over a weekend. They were fun challenges and I got some pretty good arms and armor from doing all those queen fights.
---
Didn't realize the "war on Bethesda" was a thing until reading this, so I looked it up. Only found one post promoting it, which seemed to go mostly ignored or outright flamed. Are people really doing this shit?
---
I was there for that!
---
Utterly terrifying
---
That might be true, I think I've gotten like 5 total, my characters are 208, 120 and 82.
---
And most of them were completely crappy like a Hunters/limb/90 or something.
---
Also lever actions! I can't remember when I've got one of them the last time.
---
I'm level 118ish and am just starting the Free States part of the main quest. *So* much of my game playing is just wandering around and a slow, peaceful grind.
---
Hey I'm new to the game. How do people get scammed via trading? Can people steal your stuff?
---
I played the tutorial and watched the first cutscene of Disintegration. I don't think it's for me.
---
Absolutely, and in the words of one of my favorite scoundrels "Never tell me the odds!"
---
I never have this issue on public adventure server
---
aight that one was pretty weak ngl cuh
---
&gt; they would have already done it.
---
They did. Ever heard of Nuclear Winter? Hell, Bethesda even has a whole studio behind it. If/when NW falls off (depends entirely how this anti-cheat system works out) then they should 100% go back and work on Survival mode, but *don't half-ass it.*
---
I don't think you really understand what you want out of this conversation. I mean, if you wanted me to say "yeah, no pvp, ever, done deal" sorry cuh.
---
Fo76 is down right? I was trying to find a post asking about it. I’m getting login error is this universal?
---
Dude that seems incredibly cheap
---
Yes lmao
---
lucky you.
---
r/justiceserved
---
Coming soon: Imposter Deathclaw outfit 
---
Coming in Winter: Imposter Raider outfit (Wear a raider skin, literally!)
---
Coming next year: Imposter Imposter Outfit (Wear the skin of another player wearing an Imposter outfit!)
---
VATS broken and useless? The best build in the game currently is Stealth Commando using VATS heavily. You have clearly shown trough your posts you don't know what magical weapons are, plus if you think Assassin, an effect that can appear on literally any weapon, rolling is a glitch then you clearly don't understand how legendary effects work on this game.
---
Stop being salty, this is an MMORPG and RNG is an integral part of ALL MMORPGS, from World of Warcraft to 76. You can always get more modules and craft more, it will still be easier and quicker to get the very specific weapon you so clearly demand this way than lucky out on a random drop.
---
Yes, everyone (except this one dude apparently?) Is getting that same error code on login. Been down since the early afternoon
---
The most frustrating thing is, there is still no way to quit the game without logging in. I'm stuck in a loop, and finally had to kill it in task manager. Same thing happens if you get booted out from sitting idle too long.
---
There are people behind these screens, what happens online is generally trivialized but it should not be.  I have seen harassment in this game, and it should not be taken lightly just because of the anonymity that online provides.
---
Pssst. What are you god?
---
That's counting for every pellet though. If a single pellet were moving at the same speed as a bullet it would not perform the same, especially encountering armor/solid bodies. Naturally shotguns do more damage when you add together all of the pellets. My reasoning above was to explain why individual pellets don't each do the full damage of the weapon.
---
And tbh I wish there were modifiable ammo types that add slugs to the game.
---
If any game is going to take away mass amounts of players from the game its going to be cyberpunk 2077. Especially if it eventually gets some kind of decent on online multiplayer like iv seen thrown around a few times.
---
Gross.
---
Flying toads was the unexpected highlight of Fasnacht for me. It made me laugh. Someone was launching them during Path to Enlightenment yesterday. Not sure if it was intended or not but those things have the the most hilarious ragdoll physics
---
How so? I know there are always  going to be balance issues, but it had potential.  The way in which it was unbalanced was To have a much higher player against a much lower player or a team of people against one player.  Once people realized that a lot of players were not interested in PVP, just a few interested in tanking over low levels or singles that had no chance everyone turned on pacifist.  To be PVP there has to be a chance for either party to win.
---
God you're a fucking clown, you need to be in your safe fucking space because you can't handle being killed in a game, wahhhhhh. Blame bethesda for even shipping this game with the caption "ANY INTERACTION WITH ANOTHER DWELLER CAN TURN DEADLY"
---
But not until November now :)
---
Pretty common item, all u have to do is take over on of the fushion core places to get them, so to me they have very little value and most power armor users just take over one of the areas
---
Same Error. Had it all day, still do 😣
---
Honestly this post says more about how much time I spend AFKing in the atom shop
---
A glass of Jack would be much better imo
---
Laughs in minecraft 2b2t anarchy server
---
Actually the Gauss shotgun has 2 skins, one was a limited time one tho
---
is down
---
How does one go about achieving such a thing? Asking for a friend...
---
&gt; so far thats .0180555555555556 cents. much less if you paid for the year.
---
You pay 54c a month for First?
---
If you're going to troll at least don't make yourself look like basic math is out of your reach.
---
I don't know.
---
What do you think about attacking all the humans?
---
Thanks for all the replies. Maybe I'll get to try it out before I have to sleep...
---
Not looking good..
---
&gt;In fact, there was a great system for PVP in the beginning, but only for those with honor.
---
Only if  you define "honor" as wrecking other players with the duped meta gear of the week.
---
I actually wouldnt mind a little PvP as long as its 1v1. Not 4v1 like it is. Im glad they are redoing the PvP system in this game.
---
I was doing limited fast travel for the first half of the last run. Only going to places that cost 0 caps( home, tent, vault 76 and events). Theres just not enough random enemies though, lots of wasted time. May try it again though.
---
I believe you just need the explosive effect.
---
Nah, nukashine isn't a trap at all. Most people know what it is and it's harmless fun. I got trolled by it when I returned to the game a few weeks before Wastelanders. I found a camp with a mothman cult shrine in a dome. Saw the punch bowl, didn't know what the liquid in it was and obviously drank from it. Had a good laugh but wasn't mad at all.
---
Sorry these are players I dragged in from the wow classic community. They’re extra toxic but the good news is tomorrow I’m telling them about ESO.
---
Easy now. Dont lose hope....
---
Have you seen her channel? It's blatant griefing and bullying. I don't care if I'm killed, but attacking other people who don't really want to fight in the first place and destroying their camp is just plain shitty.
---
&gt;In hindsight, everything is 2020".
---
You mean everything has gone to shit, like 2020 has? 🤣
---
Can't even log in, launcher says incorrect password
---
Aw I’m sad I hadn’t played in a few weeks and was going to come back and binge it. I’ll have to check tomorrow.
---
You just made me ROFL irl
---
My buddy was able to launch a toad over the southern mountain peak, overlooking Helvetia, with his explosive cryolator.
---
What do you think the people that play the game 12 hours a day are doing right now
---
Breaking news! : purchases within the atom shop for atoms have tripled!
---
That's a new one to me, but in line with the myriad of issues everyone is having.
---
**Fireproof** is also occasionally useful.  Especially for exploding robots.
---
Probably not that important in a SBQ fight, but for my character it's enough to prevent an instant kill if you don't get away from that legendary bot fast enough.
---
Same, also shotguns should do more damage than they do then customers would use them.
---
Anyone that is mad about that just wanted to bait fights against low level players and kill them with 4 people because somehow that is fun or the people who would show up to your camp and like 2 would be invisible with wrecking ball equipped and 1 would fight you then the other 2 would blow your camp to hell
---
I am sipping on some sake brewed and bottled in Japan. So good.
---
Its the only thing that is fun in the game, you think the pve is challenging? The only challenge is other players, I've killed her and lorespade with my camp. Get creative or stay in pacifist. It's made for people like you and these people who don't want to be griefed.
---
Say what... How? Dont tell me they can just take stuff from your inventory from the trade screen because that actually sounds like some bs.
---
If you don't like PvP then leave the server its not that damn hard to do just stay in sissy mode and deal with it grow up
---
2 players agree to trade an item worth more than 30k caps. one player has to go first, on some time scale. Since its an item to item trade, there's no confirm window like literally every other online game with trading. 
---
Scammer will wait for the other play to offer an item, take the item and never put the agreed upon item up for trading and just walk away.
---
It's pathetic that people do this, I lost a QFFR tesla and a nice handmade myself. One of which, to a player who was literally not on an alt or anything. The only way around it is use a courier as an escrow and only trust people with good trade history - but that's a pain for something as simple as an item to item exchange.
---
 Definitely. 
---
 Is there life beyond the stars?
---
A simple search of the sub says yes
---
Its an outage its happened all day
---
Bethesda services are down. 
---
Please use search or just scroll a little bit. There are hundreds of these posts.
---
This! Not just in PVP. They played less than 50 hours and think they should have a say in how Beth does things. They are hating on everything as it gets them the negative attention that they miss from their mothers. Im sorry. Its difficult to not be judgmental. There is so much hatred everywhere you look, yet this is a great game. People are upset that its not like the other Fallout games. The thing is... It is NOT supposed to be LIKE other Fallout games. It is an online game. A whole different environment. I say to Beth... You keep doing you because you saved my life.
---
Thus bringing about the cult of fuzzy
---
I love this idea. It will be the Fallout Flea Market. 
---
But will this replace CAMPs entirely, or be like a smaller subsidiary plot?
---
Everybody wanted Co-op fallout no me asked for PVP, PVP is just used for trolling at this point. Also, I say remove it altogether before we start hearing "handmade is to OP, please nerf" whining.
---
Bethesda are scrambling for 3 radio vacuum tubes as we speak.
---
Lol, thought it was just me. xD Glad but also sorry to hear this.
---
Look at top post
---
Servers are down. Going on 5.5 hours
---
Choose a build early (look around online for one, [Kevduit](https://www.kevduit.com/fallout-76/) has some which I consider very good if not fully optimized) so you don't need to prepare for late game, then play the game like a normal Fallout one: do the main and side quests, explore a bit around the areas you're currently on. However, whenever you get to the late game the structure will more and more stop being of a traditional Fallout experience and shift to be closer to that of an MMORPG, whenever you get there having an optimized build will help. Then you'll get down with the grind: gold bullions, legendary scrip, bottle caps, and god-tier legendaries are what you'll be mostly looking for, and for that, there is nothing better than Public Events (the ones with exclamation marks), followed by Dailies.
---
Same as me sitting in the corner shaking/crying/praying to the gods, you know the usual.
---
I'd settle for Fuzzy Brenda acknowledging me as an employee, and telling me which game the boss wants calibrated that day.
---
Oh. My. God. Thank you.
---
Yes, I should have scrolled down first. Sorry. Thanks.
---
And soon to be deleted post.
---
I find the explosive crossbow's work really well for launching frogs- the impact area seems to be greater even without grenadier and the bodies don't break up into smaller pieces right away, allowing for some great flailing.
---
What? Any word as to why? Or when it will return?
---
On here posting if anyone else is having trouble logging in.
---
Then you're probably one of the losers that thinks it's ok to crash servers because nobody besides your going want to pvp. I used to pvp, but it takes no skill and it dead as a doornail so I stopped. Nobody wants it.
---
Finally someone with the guts
---
This is part of the reason I buy the whole "bethesda only uses this game as a cash cow"  there is so many ways such as this to.maxamize revenue.  Hell they barely even bother putting out weapon skins which is easy money.
---
Wow! Yessir! Sorry about that. I will do this next time. Thank you! \^\^   
---
Is there any word on when it will be back?
---
bonus points for trickshotting them multiple times in air before it hits the ground
---
LOL!!!
---
I completely understand that and on fo4 I download hyper-realistic gun mods, but for fo76 shotguns would easily become the new meta if they dealt the weapons damage per pellet, or even if their damage was made to be more realistic. I personally don't remember why the rubberbanding is happening but I do remember it happened before, and then they fixed it.
---
You nailed it
---
Retrace steps? You out of caps or over encumbered? 
---
I'll just fast travel home
---
It was cost per hour. Yes, its not exact. I knew you were coming by, and would mistakenly assume i calculated per day. I did it specifically to upset you.
---
🤷🏻‍♂️ Its stressful times and people just wanna relax. I completely understand it but people really do need to chill. Its a very real possibility this isn’t even on Bethesda. This could be some kinda ddos attack by people throwing a tantrum because they feel left behind as the game evolves. i mean apparently there has been some groups of pissed off pvp players threatening to shut down the game until Bethesda meets their demands.
---
Nope on either of those
---
Somebody beat you up homie?
---
Yeah great idea, until they make a change to them and your Grognaks with the awesome Stanley skin becomes unusable and you can’t even take the skin off. Yeah just be glad your handmade skins haven’t been “fixed” yet.
---
I'm pretty active on nw and there are a couple people who also will use modded controllers
---
No it's 1 shot for every 'Are the servers down/error message' post annnd I'm halfway smashed already
---
There is a toggle. You are in pacifist mode. Go to game settings to check. If you are in pacifist, you take and inflict no damage.
---
I experienced this too.
---
I got a furious fixer
---
Good, you're not a flake.
---
We’d all become addicted to penny slots in seconds lmao
---
Even better.  1 shot each time someone posts about the servers being down or what the error code is about =)
---
Most of my irl “Vintage Nukashine Experiences” end in me being out of all currencies.
---
You and the other player need to attack each other first, and then you will both deal damage to one another.
---
How about for every "I cant login post"?
---
Yeah, it's very confusing. \*starts slow clap for Best-hesda!
---
Like really it’s honestly kinda fun doing it plus it gives me an excuse to actually do luck hole and look for iron /lead
---
None that is public. Been down for about 4 or 5 hours now. You can periodically check Bethesda.net/status to see. Also their Twitter I hear is a great outlet for such things but I dont use Twitter.
---
Both players need pacifist off and both have to do a small damage kind of like a gentleman's agreement to duel.
---
Currently if you or they are on a team it will pull whole teams to be hostile. It also allows them to attack and destroy your camp.
---
Also pvp is broken guys with good rolls and builds usually just kill in a few shots.
---
The fast majority of the player base usually just stays in pacifist mode.
---
You could always try nuclear winter.
---
OP is going to be dead by tomorrow from alcohol poisoning .
---
Respectfully, if I heard that terrible song from Murmgh’s gramophone playing in your camp, I would nuke you. I would.
---
You are correct.
---
You mean get ready to get Tesla rifled
---
I dont remember the whole list of perks that affect gauss weapons, I just picked up the game again when wastelanders dropped
---
But iirc gauss weapons are ballistic weapons (in that a ballistic projectile is charged using magnets then launched at high speeds) and energy weapons (due to the ammo type?) And the rounds are explosive by default (I think that's due to how fast the round is actually travelling, it explodes on impact due to its velocity) 
---
But I dont actually know. Youd have to ask bethesda about it.
---
If getting killed in a video game makes you miserable, you have far greater problems my dude.
---
I too basically boycotted this game at release for obvious reasons. But damn I wish I had those legacies. They seem the equivalent to unique weapons from the other games. Which I lived to collect.
---
Lol. I was about to delete it myself, after finding out. I appreciate the mods for doing the hard work around here.
---
I believe some people do it because their mind goes to the worst-case scenario; Some of the error codes are similar to those of banned players - while others are getting non-codes that sound like it's a client error. Some people don't realize it could be a server issue as a result.
---
Here's a status link for people btw: [https://bethesda.net/en/status](https://bethesda.net/en/status)
---
yeah pretty much. would be funny if you actually used a hammer and it had a chance to explode and cripple your arm.
---
The game detected you weren't wearing your mask and kicked you out.
---
Insert “It ain’t much, but it’s honest work” meme.
---
None of this is that outrageous to ask for
---
Be good if they get some Enclave gear to help that,like they did for Raiders and Responders.
---
Doesn’t really help if you’re over encumbered or if where you need to go is nowhere near the vault, it’s free but I’d rather not spend an hour walking from 76 to everywhere else on the map.
---
(Least that would be my reason, a new player might not know that the vault is free fast travel, I know I didn’t my first few days in 76 when I was stuck in the bog.)
---
The point is that all of your assumptions are fundamentally inaccurate or outright incorrect, and you keep arguing for them to double down on game modes practically no one wants. 
---
&gt;They did. Ever heard of Nuclear Winter? 
---
Ok, so why are you even commenting here then? If that's all you want, why bother commenting at all? Because it isn't. Because you want them to keep wasting more resources on shitty PvP that the overwhelming majority of their fanbase DOES NOT WANT.
---
It doesn't matter if it's a different studio working on it, they're still only getting so much revenue from the game, and it's not coming from PvP players. Any of that money that gets spent on PvP **isn't** being spent on PvE, and is almost entirely wasted on a disproportionately minuscule minority of the playerbase.
---
Going back to what you commented before: 
---
&gt;Loads of people want an actual fallout 76 pvp, but they don't want to play a battle royale/deal with legacy weapons/deal with the million ways the game discourages pvp.
---
**No. There are not.** There never have been "loads of people" who wanted *any* kind of PvP in Fallout. 
---
If you want more PvP, go play an actual PvP game. Fallout 76 will never provide the PvP you're looking for, and expecting otherwise is delusional.
---
And that's all the time I'm wasting on this.
---
Yeah :)
---
I was insinuating some individuals have such shit lives this is the only medium where they have control.
---
Anybody else keeping track of gamer tags just to irritate these sweaty crybabies when the servers are back up? 😆
---
That's not really what a coward would do but I agree
---
I’m on Xbox so it couldn’t have been you, but I saw quite a few flying radtoads during Fasnacht, always gave me a bit of a laugh. Never saw any go that far though lmao
---
Not true. If I leave the event + you accidentally shoot me I will kill you but you don’t drop any junk. Me + my teammate do it all the time
---
They already took their time with the legendary perks. Around a year, last time I checked. It seemed to make little difference.
---
Ah, great to know! Wow, that's a bummer. I'll go ahead and do that. Ah, okay. Thank you! (:
---
It would be awesome, but I imagine they would announce that to avoid all the pissed off customers.
---
Yikes I live life at nerd rage as is
---
I was giving a full ultracite power armor from some lvl 15 who was on a alt account yesterday’s and just noticed he gave it to me today when I logged on this morning
---
Look at how stupid you are. You can't have a discussion without attacking someone and not the thing we're discussing. I'd rather not talk to a bumbling Pollock like you.
---
Thats a good one they said summer so we'll get it in the end of August lol
---
It's garbage.
---
If we’re lucky
---
The three things I just mentioned theres 4 or 5 side quest lines that have cool unique rewards ( mistress of mysteries, cold case mayor for a day etc.) 2 of the new allies have rather long questline theres alot more hidden stuff outside the main quests
---
The biggest problem with NW is the load times.  Too much fucking down time between matches.
---
it helps when people aren't hacking.
---
you're thinking to small. How about they just max reputation with both factions and remove the grind all together. The daily's are a long boring, mindless grind that lasts months. All it would do is allow us to see a list of things to buy. Similar to how they removed randomized vendor plans. Oh yeah plus they should throw in a few free skins bc why the hell not.
---
Making a parody of an annoyance just adds to the noise.
---
I’m a patient good person, here is the explanation. I hate you but this game and subreddit are generally wholesome so I’m going to respectfully answer even though I’d rather casually dump ketchup in your ice cream.
---
Was it eye bleach?
---
Yeet, thanks for checking r/new
---
Seriously. I play casually and am like lvl 120 at this point. Had a lvl 50 guy come into my camp one day while I was just crafting at my camp and he started attacking me with a flamethrower (I have on passive but apparently the fire does damage) so I was like fuck it turned off passive and went to kill him cause he wouldn't leave then three people in power armor came out of the woodwork and attacked me. Had to switch servers cause they wouldn't leave me alone and kept killing me and destroying my camp. I honestly hate the pvp people
---
True but you cant say you wouldnt want to see your character riding a carousel.
---
You're welcome. 
---
I wasnt trying to be a dick by saying use search. It's just really useful for things like this. Also useful for build advice, camp ideas, etc. There are a ton of posts for nearly every topic that offer great help. Take care.
---
Incredible that Biff would actually comment on it. Oh the irony.
---
I may have been around and seen this. I was wondering why radiated frogs where flying higher than possible.
---
Lol. Gotcha. Haven't tried to play until a few min ago. Found out what's going on from a friend
---
If I want pvp then I go nw and floor a bunch of losers who think they're the shit in adventure pvp
---
Take a shot for every "Are the servers down?" post
---
Take another if there's someone rudely telling them to search up previous threads 
---
Take 2 more if a argument starts as a result
---
Take 1 shot for every post that thinks they were banned 
---
And then another if the post gets removed by the mods
---
Down the bottle if the servers actually come back
---
Down every other botfle you currently have if it turns out they only came back for all of 5 minutes and we're back to square one and lots of waiting yet again
---
I meant to explain that each pellet does less damage than the total of the gun for 2 reasons, 1 pellet (it doesn't matter what size) does not have the same power as the entire weapon itself. The weapons power comes from multiple pellets being fired at once.
---
Also, I'm kind of ignoring any round besides the buckshot because they're not in fo76, but you are right, slugs do a lot more damage. 
---
As far as the damage output, theres a lot of people upset with the rubberbanding that's occurring using a lot of weapons in fo76 rn, and I think that if they fix that issue, the shotgun will start performing a lot better. This issue happened before after the game was initially released, and when they fixed it a lot of weapons saw an increase in their percieved damage output.
---
Fair, but there’s not some deep psychological issue behind it most of the time, it’s only a game. Some people are indeed assholes, others are just bored and tired of running the same events 1400 times.
---
Booted up the LG smart air fryer and logged right in
---
Shit u right
---
Edit One: OMG thank you so much for the upvotes I’ve literally never had two before. I love this community!!
---
Gotcha. Haven't played all day till now. Friend explained what's going on
---
Have the best of both worlds turn Camden park into a gladiator ring for raiders using the coaster as the stands
---
Just feel free to add my bf Nekrosias and if any of you have the balls to do anything about it, come to us!
---
What if I was already drinking?
---
Thanks for the love and engagement, boo boo.
---
Cause they cant use their full build based around pvp that takes no skill to actually use in that mode
---
They could be installing it now and just have everything disabled until then.
---
So you want me to blackout by reading one thread I see?
---
A visual illustration of visiting this board lately

---
Exactly!!! Which shows how broken their system is... Mommy Salami sounds cheeky to me but not offensive. Whereas I've seen plenty of rude, crude and downright nasty names at the upper levels echelon and yet they are still playing on.
---
If it was, it's going about as good as some of the previous patches so who knows... :)
---
That wouldn't explain TES being down at the same time. Most likely a company wide issue.
---
Kevduit intensifies
---
No, it works to well to be a patch.
---
Wastelanders was supposed to come out last summer and it came out spring of this year instead lol.
---
I think I only popped 1 set of balloons. I was pretty focused on repairing all the broken ones LOL.
---
Ya it would be cool, but if you look at their server status portal basically everything is down from elder scrolls to rage
---
Remove daily bullion, cap and scrip limit and bullion, cap and scrip caps.
---
Yup. Go chug em', tiger
---
Medical sub showing some real bad injuries, interesting but made me wince seeing some of those
---
Normal SB you can loot of you just tag 'em once. The client side body for enemies is usually different for everyone so it's likely that your copy of the SB followed you but for everyone else it remained in the Bog
---
Aye fair enough
---
Some medical subreddit. It's extremely graphic but was actually interesting, if a bit nauseating...lol
---
Yes
---
I would set up a casino near the way ward with good low level legendaries in it
---
&gt;Its the only thing that is fun in the game, you think the pve is challenging? The only challenge is other players, I've killed her and lorespade with my camp. Get creative or stay in pacifist. It's made for people like you and these people who don't want to be griefed.
---
Much love to you, bro. Anyone who can kill me is awesome.
---
I've sauced so many people in 1v1s and either they whoop out a broken tesla rifle or they being there squad in lmao
---
I am telling my kids this and sending them to this post every time they ask me when we’re going to be there. “Soon”
---
Signing in, seeing he alone is online: "*I* just work."

[Super Soul Bossa by Ray Lopez,](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=2BChZXckdbo) to be exact.
---
There's also [Rio De Janerio](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=EQhiRD5X854) by Lounge Crew.
---
Dunno about the 3rd song, though. Nor the songs that were in the Shop pre-Nuclear Winter
---
you can take away the cap limit, but first you have to pretty much wipe all caps from the game and start over with an auditing system so that when people hack that stuff can get removed later rather than have people with infinite caps able to buy everything.
---
I was wondering where the hell they were falling from
---
Yeah imagine that there's 4 dudes with explosive auto Tesla rifles being able to kill someone they're not engaged in combat with within 2 seconds.
---
Roll Tide Roll! :)
---
LOL, that is an insanely good event if you're not after legendaries.  2 minutes, 120 caps + what the mutants drop, fusion core, some lead, bench right there and it's up constantly.
---
I was sleeping in my Fallout 1st Tent and I was trying to leave my guy AFK so I could go take a sh*t, but my phone died and my PS4 got disconnected from my hotspot. Decided to deal with it when I got back, hour later I came back and couldn’t log in to the game.
---
Gonna hop on and say I’m near Whitesprings and got a lvl 20 on my lvl 95 char
---
That's difficult to answer.
---
Coud you survive a nuclear blast?
---
While it's down go watch angry turtle on YT one of the best tubers who has broken down what works and why in fo76 atm.... And does a variety of builds great base material.  
---
Basically your gonna end up tossing or recrafting everything you make pre 50 so don't worry about it. Except quest rewards sometimes you need the old one to make the new one don't toss them.
---
First character just chill and treat as a story playthorough learn what you like, you can always go back and make another with a plan.
---
I really rather just run in and grab all the chems, lead and nukas.. then GTFO with some light combat
---
Yep. same on PS4
---
To be fair...i worked all day. i just got home an logged in an saw all that error.code stuff.....so i know ppl are tired of seeing the posts...but i sort by new...so ive only seen one post.
---
I get yall are tired of it but for those just literally coming home an literally opening reddit for the first time...as i scroll thru new i only see a couple of posts but the comments are dickish.
---
Not sure how many players, but there are 0 servers.
---
Yeah me and the girlfriend I have that is totally a real person were playing together and needed some Gatorade we are so random!!
---
It wasn’t a server crash, but the last time I dropped a nuke, my power went out literally the instant it dropped. My block was the only area it was out and it was like 5 hours before they got it fixed. I’ve been too annoyed to go through the silo again since then.
---
I believe a lot of the stigma about shotguns rn is that they do a lot of damage over a considerably short amount of time, so when the game rubberbanding enemy health it seems like they arent doing as much damage as they should. 
---
I have a pretty fast internet connection but sometimes it slows and I actually get to see the rubberbanding in it's full glory. It's frustrating, and it's an issue bethesda has seen before, and hopefully are fixing with patch 20
---
I really like that about FO76, though I feel it could’ve been implemented better. As it stands, we all have the ability to sort of be master-of-all-trades after some card shuffling over and over again. I really wish we had an opportunity for different play styles to be really viable, rather than somewhat passable while a couple legendary equipment dependent “builds” present the only really effective approaches to later gameplay. Was hoping legendary perks would make different specialty play methods viable, but we all know how that’s going. As earlier posters have pointed out in regards to the OP’s mention of quest complexity, much of the player base doesn’t really opt for real teamwork or tactics, and I feel that just feeds into the game development to not really focus on improving things so tactics can really be a thing in FO76. I hold out hope for the future, but feel it is reliant upon making it so support rolls, scouts, and tanks can work together in a functional manner rather than everyone working to a solo min/max play style.
---
Try the Sony toaster oven, I was able to get on long enough to spend a couple atoms earlier.
---
I got the same login issue on the xbox
---
I mean those daily's would still be there.
---
No posts yet but I’ll keep checking! 😜
---
I’ve got over 1000 hours in this game, I just pvp because I’m bored. I’ve done a few different builds, played through it a couple different ways, there’s just not a whole lot to do for people like me. I like the game, I enjoy the people I play it with, but I can only do the same shit so many times. The new content is never a challenge, and it can always be completed pretty quick. I’ve had more fun with my pvp build than I’ve had with any other aspect of this game, but I don’t get real world angry when someone kills me, trying to stay alive is half the fun.

Bring back Survival 
---
https:// www. change. org/p/ bethesda-bring-back-survival-mode-to-fallout-76
---
Your missing it, I’m afraid...
---
From Bethesda’s point of view, of course there isn’t   any innate ‘offense’ to the status of the words “Mommy” or “Salami” in an individual basis..
---
It’s when they are combined in that particularly reprehensible format of “MommySalami” that feelings start to get hurt..
---
We all want this to be a ‘Safe Space’ don’t we?? Of course we do! 
---
That’s why MommySalami has to be cancelled!
---
Explains why I got the login error...
---
Thats just the way the game loads up, you didn't actually get onto the servers, you just managed to bug out the main menu and have it load into a black screen, but it hasn't actually loaded a character or anything. I can reliably get that to happen just by spamming left mouse button on the press any button to start screen.
---
Can just tell im gonna get slated for this but I think if they made it when you’re engaging in PVP you’re weapon legendary affects are supressed it would probably be more balanced, because I enjoyed the nervousness Survival Mode brought and if I encountered a player that didnt have God Tier Gear it was fun because If they decided to attack or I did, there was a chance of beating them but when its like level 300+ in full power armour one shotting you with an explosive gatling, its not fun, its irritating and completely breaks the fun of the nervous encounters because there is literally no way you can come out on top against that.
---
I'll 1v1 you.
---
It was and remains my pride and joy. Thanks for asking 😀
---
😂🤣😂🤣
---
I would love this!!
---
You don't suck. You're level 40 and what matters is that you're having fun. :)
---
https:// www .change. org/p/bethesda-bring-back-survival-mode-to-fallout-76
---
Yeah it's only made better when it's against a non pvp build. Look at Mr cool guys over here these four with their bloodied explosive Tesla rifles are able to beat me and my stealth sniper, non auto rifle build I use to kill npcs they are just sooooo skillful
---
Not but 7 Ate 9
---
She won’t bring it up, nothing will change.
---
Why is this downvoted to hell? I don't know how many times I loaded in a low level mule holding enough God rolls they cannot even fast walk, and then had some lvl 40 try to drop me a few stims. I reject and they keep shooting the bag until I pick it up. I feel bad but don't know what to do about it.
---
But then the exterminator perk will be useless!
---
I saw a guy at Fasnacht use his jet pack and fly straight up into the air so high I couldn’t see him anymore...
---
He never did come back down.
---
I'm 47 been in love with gaming sense my dad brought home an Atari when I was 5
---
There’s also a search bar at the top
---
Yes they are. I was just wondering if they were any other ways
---
yeah bullion doesn't matter. but there's just too much duping an hacking that affects these other pools in some way.
---
Bring back survival. 
---
Yes, have been for .. 6 hours? The forum just reactivate about an hour ago.
---
My favourite weapon in the game is a 2 star QE pipe rifle, just saying.
---
I don't really wanna argue with anyone saying it's a glitch.  It's just not what I would call it.
---
AJ... there will always be nice people to answer, feel no shade for I am merely messing around cause I’m bored.
---
I chuckle every time.
---
I haven’t seen anything.
---
But how many Mini Nukes where fired at the Efigiy??
---
YES
---
Don’t comment about pvp when you know so little.
---
If your on PCs and steam client you can just hit the windows icon on your keyboard and the click on the 76 icon then close
---
No, I wanted that worthless piece of shit to keep up so I could finish the fucking quest faster. I had to wait for useless ass to get back up so many times it took twice as long to finish.
---
Bring back survival 
---
Crazy enough I’m pretty sure PC has around 10,000 - 50,000 average every day (majority on Bethesda’s game launcher because people are lazy to switch to steam). And consoles have around anywhere from 250,000 to 500,000 playing at one time. 
---
For servers I have no fucking idea, pretty sure that’s private information only for Bethesda’s eyes.
---
https:// www .change .org/p/bethesda-bring-back-survival-mode-to-fallout-76
---
I love your ideas.
---
I want a back pack that's a plush mega sloth hanging from your back
---
Cooments like this show how brain dead players are ots not a 4v1. Its now impossible to 4v4
---
I prefer the opposite TBH, but I get hate mail about being in god mode when I mop the floor with a full team of “tAnK bUiLdS”. It’s fun when it’s friendly, but you PVE guys are the most toxic people on earth when someone else kills you. I’ve gotten more nasty ass messages from the roaming hoarders than I ever had from other pvpers.
---
No, all of the servers are down, not just 76 of them.
---
;)
---
As an Aussie i get rubberbanding health on everything.. I've pretty much quit honestly due to bugs.. my dailies only pop every three real days..
---
Maybe you should pack a punch of your own.  I didn’t have any issue clearing the handful of ghouls.
---
It's a DDOS from the PVPers upset about the patch 20 tagging changes.
---
I don't have time to keep track of salty foodies. They just flock to Mama Riley.
---
I've enjoyed RPing in games in the past, will definitely be keen to see how many people set that as a group goal and actually follow through
---
I'm 47 loved my Atari. Can still remember the day my dad brought it home.
---
It’s fun regardless if it’s evenly matched. It’s a little easier on a team because of the bonuses you get, and the ability to share cards. I usually go in solo, and almost always end up outnumbered, but the challenge is what makes it enjoyable.
---
I'd say welcome buddy.
---
See, I can appreciate you because you understand how to turn on passive mode.
---
Bingo. They're never safe.
---
I had a level 2 come to my camp and buy a 3 star bloodied tesla for 3500 caps. I don't think anyone will judge you for shopping as a newbie. ;)
---
Excuse me. I'm on server 826.4 and it's working just fine.
---
Just a game crash, but my son and I were fighting Sheepsquatch for the first time, we got him down to about 1/4 inch of health and BOOM booted. I was so pissed.
---
&gt; Use descriptive titles. Clickbait or extremely vague titled posts will be removed.
---
If you have a question about something, please put the question **in the title**. Reddit does not make it possible to edit titles, so you will have to post again with a LONGER, MORE DESCRIPTIVE TITLE. Once again, MAKE A TITLE WHICH IS LONGER AND MORE DESCRIPTIVE.
---
I think the trading system from Borderlands 2 would be great in 76.
---
Trading an item for item, both players put their items up, once both players hit agree the menu counts down and the trade goes through. No more “going first and getting your sh*t stolen” BS.
---
The M79+lock and load reload speed buff can be tested if you have someone to help you. Just have on person run lock and load and shoot both of your m79s at the same time. I haven't checked it post Wastelanders but I haven't heard anything about it being nerfed. I did hear the AGL had a huge fire rate nerf in adventure mode though. Do you know if that was applied to NW too?
---
Are you 100% sure about shotguns?  Nothing was ever datamined about rifle perks working with shotguns.
---
Don't fall for the trap of weight reduction cards early on. Learn to drop or sell garbage you're not using. Use all the damage cards you can. Turn in the crap legendaries for scrip and eventually you will get something usable or really good. Do caps grind for a while by getting the 1400 per day and vendor hop at player camps. You can often get good stuff for cheap from random people in game, so you'll want to have the caps available when you do find something.
---
Best way to get easy caps is serums but if you're new that won't be an option unless someone makes them for you.
---
Next best super early is shoot stuff near a vendor, loot weapons off them, sell those weapons.
---
After that, find a Marine Tactical Helmet plan. Scrap all those weapons you used to sell for plastic and steel. Get glass pretty much anywhere. And run through Grafton HS for basketballs once a day for rubber.
---
Another option is cooking meat. You can max out 1400 caps a day selling flesh to robots easily. Also, don't fall for the trap of buying things from robots except for plans you need. Their prices are crazy and will burn your caps away very quickly.
---
Once you have caps well under control, grind for legendaries. If you aren't finding enough legendaries to max out your scrip daily, vendor hop and buy theirs as if it you're buying scrip at up to 20 or 25 caps per scrip. Unless there's a sale at Mumbles's, start small. Roll 1\* items until you get something that matches how you want to play. Then go for the 3\* stuff over time.
---
Oh dear lawd.... you’ve been inconvenienced
---
I got hoes in different area codes too
---
Roblox was down for my kids a few nights ago...ddos
---
I thought this just after servers went down.
---
At this point they need to reboot to 19 and put 20 back in PTS.
---
How long is a piece of string?
---
Seriously. They want this game to turn into the Sims, apocalypse-lite. It's a fucking survival game.
---
No one is expecting people to be on reddit all day and know what’s being posted at all times. It’s just a simple fact that using the search feature or scrolling a few pages is actually quicker and easier than making a post about a topic that’s been posted 50 times in the last 6 hours.
---
more than a few hours apparently
---
I pointed this out months ago while watching tv with my family, the commercial came on and I was like “damn that sounds familiar as fuck” and then about an hour later when I was playing 76 that song played in the atomic shop and I lost it and called my family together to hear how they were the same. They all basically rolled their eyes but I was right damnit!
---
Reddit needs to get over the fact that plenty of people enjoy pvp in this game, its not fair to constantly dismiss us even when we try to find middle ground.. Even when you can still opt out you'd rather rally against.. It's freaking weird.
---
Yeah, about 75% of all of Bethesda's online presence is down right now. 
---
No shit, OP seems to think we need a full team to kill anyone 🤣. I’ve got mules that would rinse 90% of the people who post here.
---
Ohh educated me wise pvp master...
---
Tell me how people dont spam duped nuka quantums and stealth boys and telsa guns so they don't have to actually aim while leaping around with their mutations so some guy they got to actually fight them can't aim or get a melee swing in....
---
Or how they use their bloodied explosive heavy guns to pepper some dude so fast he cant react...
---
Or some cloaked dude you can't find popping sniper shots.
---
Or spamming gamma guns and rad rifles so they have to radaway then heal.
---
And to top that off when they got three of their friends fast travel in to gang up on a solo player.
---
Yes educated me in how the open world pvp isnt utter shit.
---
Looking for width or height?
---
They also are starving and famished. Their armor is broken along with most of their weapons.
---
Bring on the cheesy shit!
---
Ps4, same here. Finished work early to go home and play, now I have to do my housework and be a decent boyfriend.
---
Mercury Retrograde is on fire today!
---
We had our global  networks go down for no reason today at work. They still can't figure out what happened. It's been an odd day before all the network troubles. 2020 has been crazy lol...
---
Beth must be in total panic mode lol it's still not up. Hopefully  they can fix it soon!
---
It varies based on region, time of day, day of the week etc. with only 24 players per server, plus thousands of people going solo on private worlds....likely as few as 1,000 world instances at some times and tens of thousands, of not 100,000+ at others. 
---
You’ve gotta remember, each world isn’t a physical server. They just rent server space from AWS. They’re likely spinning up physical servers all over the world as needed and each one of those servers hosts multiple world instances, and probably other things as well. That’s what allows the game to flex with demand.
---
Honestly I've been vendor hopping a lot recently and every three/four servers i see someones name i recognize.
---
You think they are keeping them down on purpose?  Money is being lost the longer they are down.
---
fucking hoarders.. the worst...
---
Dont really like putting partially charged ones in my shop taking up usually an individual space, and worse added weight
---
Or just make the game singleplayer like Fallout 4, that would be better..
---
What?
---
Maby if my ex would have been gaming with me we would still be together.
---
They haven’t turned it off and on again, give it time.
---
I just want them to release a pristine mr fuzzy suit, like they did for the mole man one
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/
---
You two crazy lovebirds
---
I love how no ones questioning this.
---
*looks at all the threads about fallout 76 and other Bethesda game servers being down* eh looks like I won't be playing these games anytime soon
---
Not to mention all limbs crippled and no stims.
---
Literally just about to start Encryptid for the first time, used my keycard and everything. From what I’ve read online it’s my understanding that the keycard is now gone and I have to sell an arm and a leg to get a new one so that I can finish what Bethesda interrupted. Suuuuper disappointing.
---
maybe they should ask AWS for more disk space.
---
Can you link the subreddit?
---
Nobody wants to play shitty PvP because it's full of mindnumbing easy legacy weapons and nuka quantums builds that instakill players. You don't really sound informed on the state of 76 PvP, and just write it off probably off of fear.
---
You can't really comment on a small audience, because nobody wanted an online fallout, period. The fan base didn't want fallout 76 either, apparently.
---
Like I guess if you want to be as basic as you want to be, why bother adding an endgame? Go play a better loiter shooter rpg then.
---
Try not to have a hissy fit at the next guy you talk to.
---
how badly did they fuck up an update?
---
Now she is with someone else and gaming with him. Go figure.

The error code is being given the swedish roundup.

That was not enjoyable for me as mother to two of those kids...lol.

I'm 100% sure about shotguns.

Agl did get a fire rate cap but the m79 is now broken with its fire rate and can reliably double, triple, quad fired without reoalding.
---
Here’s an idea for a location - Sutton.

sure.. I just need your SS#, D.O.B. and mothers maiden name...
---
I thought it was just me wandering around at 100+ and still haven't launched a nuke.
---
Yepperinos
---
OHHHHHH sorry my bad, yeah they would be more ways to get them, like some of the mini games you see such as whack-a-commie would work and give you a certain amount of tokens depending on ur score. Basically like the nuka-world arcade in F04
---
Have they implied it was an attack?
---
What's the point though? I mean if this was ark or something i'd get it. I wouldn't agree with it, but i'd get it.
---
No it would not.
---
The mods are deleting hundreds of these repetitive posts.
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/hbkxx0/are_the_severs_down/
---
I find it funny how people automatically assume all people that are upset with the changes are “cowards who grief and don’t fight fair”. What about the people that enjoy fighting in team v team shit? Now that’s ruined and people will have to all tag each other every time. It’s kinda stupid. I understand WHY Bethesda would do this, but what I don’t understand is why it’s FORCED instead of a toggle. Players should be able to choose, just like with passive mode.
---
Oh god yes I'd love that
---
They have more than 76 😜
---
All 5 of you must feel pretty mad about it
---
Yeah I feel your pain. My son was one of those kids. Was still fun trying to teach them patience and if I remember right it was down for over 24 hours. Let’s hope that’s not the case here.
---
What'd they change?
---
That’s exactly what I’m talking about.  That is not PVP.  Once everyone turned on pacifist and all that’s left are bullies fighting other bullies they don’t find it so fun anymore.  And just as an aside, there are a lot of awesome fun great PVP players in the fallout community so I don’t want to throw those people under the bus.  I have seen videos on line, seen them play against each other, and never once seen them run up with a flamethrower while 3 friends in power armor were waiting outside...because they enjoy PVP...not whatever flame bait is...lol.
---
Probably gonna get down voted but the really issue with the pvp is the legendary effects.  There are way too many damage modifiers to make any pvp match a fair fight. Especially when only a 1/3 of the legendary effects are usefull.
---
Point is in any pvp it should only come down to the base dmg weapon, the armor, the players strategy and skill.  Plus the craftable mods.  Doesnt matter if its 1v1 or 1v4 in Rust, Ark, RDR2, GTA or even COD there are plenty of examples of people winning a pvp match against multiple players with everything from a pistol to a rocket launcher.  
---
Legendary effects should only apply in PVE only!
---
:)
---
Reddit does not make it possible to edit titles, so you will have to post again with a longer, more descriptive title.

I for one believe you. I dont care what everyone else says, I always liked you.

See, I knew believing in my boy would pay off! We are back!
---
I might contest it just to see if you wanna fight, but I’m not interested in destroying your stuff or taking your resources. If you’re legitimately farming, I tend to just drop you a bunch of what you’re collecting and go on about my business. I popped by Grafton steel last night and a dude was straight trying to collect a ton of steel. I dropped him a few thousand and left, babysitting workshops for minimal return sucks.

Lmfao! Just priceless, and for everything else there's Mastercard!

Nice sentiment, but judging by what I've read I don't appreciate you.

Decided to redownload fo76 last night.

Very coincidental it seems- that I havent played for several months, and the day I decide to download sh$% hits the fan. 
---
my bad
---
Yeah
---
I’d play NW more if the loading screens and matches didn’t take so long. It’s like 10 minutes of preparation, 10 minutes of farming, and 12 seconds of actual battle.
---
not working on ps4, "loginerror_gamecodefailure 3:0:9"
---
It really would..
---
To be fair, if everyone is min/maxing then no one needs support lmao.
---
Also, the only real advantage min/maxing gives you is that you dont need a team to take on heavy fights. My character is in no way what you would consider the "ideal" stealth sniper, but I can still solo a nuke silo. 
---
I would actually really like to see support roles become more prominent in the game, but 
---
1.) I cant see a lot of people willingly taking the time to respec their main (or build a brand new char) to be a support role when they have min/maxed chars that could wipe the endgame boss in 3 seconds. 
---
And 
---
2.) I dont see support roles becoming popular with how little you can actually do with them. For legendary equipment you have 2 legendary affixes that give any sort of healing or support buff to yourself or the team, *vampires and *medics. *Vampires is nice, but its entirely selfish and I cant see a team medic employing that to help the team, and *medic's only works with vats crits, meaning unless you have the character maxed for vats crit you're not going to be helping the team as much.  For perks, you have exactly one perk that heals teammates when they're still alive: Friendly Fire (which only works with flame weapons like the flamer, and not molotovs)
---
Personally I feel like there isn't enough for support characters to be a viable occupation, especially with the current meta for builds. The only real builds rn that I can see being viable are tanks and dps.
---
If you are going to post in each of these topics, you may want to get a link that isn't fucking useless.
---
Don’t care about the displays at all personally, but the like spawn mats from FO4 would be abused af unless they made it so other players bases can’t hurt you (punji boards and traps). The fast travel stuff needs to be fixed like... yesterday. The longest of failed attempts are 10 or so. This was literally just me trying to fast travel from foundation to whitespring station.

Agree to disagree.

There are no servers.

That's not a joke.

Bethesda is using Amazon's cloud service to create virtual "servers" for each instanced world on an as needed basis.

OK no problem. I'll post down below let me go get my reading glasses.

The floppy disk the engine was made on is on fire 🔥

Funny, I don't recall ever saying I had trouble. Just because the overseer is a useless piece of shit doesn't mean I had any issues. I just hate useless Npc's. She was completely unnecessary.
---
Yeah people are giving me crap about asking a question, I didnt scour the subs to see if everyone had issues, and from what your saying them about deleting the posts is why I didnt see anything. Hence my post being a legit question.

mash it.

Can confirm I just logged in on PC, no fallout 1st access though (its greyed out in the bottom right corner) as is the atomic shop.
---
[Proof](https://imgur.com/a/fGRNPTR)  
---
Can't seem to get into any servers though, it says world found, does the countdown then gives me a server disconnect error and spits me back to the main menu. So I guess its progress?
---
Totally agree. Legendary effects should be for PVE only.
---
Most likely due to the authentication bull crap they implemented without testing.
---
Must be break time, give them a couple more minutes.

Definitely my furious explosive railway rifle so fun to dump the mag on bosses with the auto receiver (I'm a rifleman build so its not for max damage)
---
I never thought of that. It’s brilliant.
---
Damn, feeling pretty good about snapping mine up for 4k yesterday then!
---
I know, right? I remember being completely disgusted with how they were acting at first (until I assigned a chore for every complaint I heard). Now I feel that in my soul...lol
---
Depends.  Is it an African or European string?
---
You can keep up to date at this link:  https://bethesda.net/en/status
---
It's the official Bethesda site showing a widespread outage
---
Maybe they should sell a solution for this made up problem. Fallout First - Server Edition?
---
When will”then” be “now”?
---
Up. Down. Left. Right. L1. R1. O. ∆. X.
---
if it was supposed to be a joke, I think the problem is you, not me.
---
Why are you asking? 
---
 Do you know how we got here?
---
Be pretty cool idea beats going there killing the same scorched everytime and it make the world more lively
---
I do scroll an sort by new...but i only saw a few posts within 2-3hr elapsed...maybe they all got removed or whatever...but i just came home 30 mins ago...so i didnt see a post about it
---
Also no social tab, gives an error about something going wrong while syncing friends list.
---
I got 350 hours out of it so its not that bad if you are willing to dodge the bugs minefield, pay ridiculous amounts of money for cosmetics and subs then deal with toxic communities daily..
---
It would have been GOTY singleplayer lol
---
I hope they‘d just tell them they’re investigating the problem and might add more disk space in a future patch! XD 
---
... and don’t forget the „Thanks for your patience!“ .......
---
I’m alright at it, it’s just kind of clunky. XP being tied to survival instead of kills makes everyone camp anyway.
---
People should put more effort into it - but lets be blunt... People are dumb, and reddit doesn't do a good job of offering good posts by default. "Is server down" isn't H-O-T baby, so it's fecked.
---
I *never* login to reddit, and I did.. just to give you a smiley fallout boy thumbs up~
---
I don’t know that!
---
Saw it too! Ruined it for everyone
---
Me neither....everbody always talks about toxic people on pub servers but literally everyone i run into is awesome. I take the same workshops everytime i log on, no pvp ever. If someone takes the shop cool if im there they usually just ask if they can take it...i just dont get why pub servers get so much hate, so many cool people!
---
PC is a very small player base. I run into the same people all the time. With Steam now though I have been seeing some new and more people on PC. Read something while back said now the largest group might possibly be Steam + Bethesda.net.
---
Don't have to scour, just scroll.
---
no
---
Check the last 100 or so posts on the sub
---
The irony is that the literal only junk item that isn't valuable enough to be hoarded would be pre-war money (so you literally shoot money at problems to solve them).
---
Guys remember it just works ;)
---
well at least you can pass the logging screen, it's something
---
You can rejoin certain world if somebody from your contact list is on it, they act like a homeing beacon. Easiest way to target a certain server.
---
It should be an addition in adventure pvp with balancing not NW.
---
you should block me so you dont have to see it
---
I want a drone that you can scout terrain for enemies. Ok, what I really want is the lmg in the weapon pool
---
It's your cake day today
---
Gimme dat cake boi
---
Oh i know...this sub is generally cool...ive met a lot of good teammates since BETA...and i hear ya...im just saying that for someone like me...i had absolutely no clue servers were down
---
came home quick shower and get error codes an i come on here (since i sort by new) i saw one that was a few hours old so i wondered if it had been fixed or whats the deal etc.
---
Well, unless they changed it so that teammates can't edit your CAMP, you should still be careful.
---
Well if there's been an update that would explain it, i wasn't aware. It's about time because it was ridiculous buying a skin and not being able to use it.
---
FYI, I have the 4th of july hardcase, black backpack with shovel (not sure of exact name), the two that came along with the Settlers and Raider Bundle when Wastelanders came out, the plushie mothman backpack, and i know i have one more, though i can't for the life of me remember what is is at the moment lol
---
Its not just shotguns everything but my 25% faster fire rate minigun doesn't kill anything.. the minigun kills things in secs luckily.
---
They always are, welcome to games.
---
Twist it..
---
atleast a new map tbh
---
I feel you. Carry on.
---
November, last year. I said to myself: let's get the plans, just because.
---
I did the event like 100 times and never got it. A friend gave it to me for free. Learned it. Did the event five times and got FOUR Fixer plans in two hours. 
---
So, range, or who knows what.
---
I dropped my power amour by accident after crafting my first suit of X0-1. Before I could get in the game crashed.
---
Hmm I couldn’t see that working though. Would cause extra load time as the game would have to load your base first then your character. Like the people who do the “flying” bases would just die most of the time because their base isn’t loaded in.
---
I know I play it almost every day since break it early beta. I preordered the bitch.
---
Its cool man, I already deleted my i
---
Useless post, and already got all the dick comments and basically why am i even breathing.... I just thought anyone can ask a question and get answers.
---
I'm on xbox, and I'm having the same issue. What does game code failure even mean? Did Bethesda's one tech guy take the night off?
---
they tweeted some inane shit about looking into "intermittent"(ell oh fucking ell) connection issues...
---
 aimbot and certain things like faster movement generally, it's subtle but it makes a difference
---
They may not know why.  I imagine if they knew what was happening they’d have fixed it already.
---
I remember that. I also remember talking to my brother on Xbox, and hearing his kid having a fit in the background because of it.
---
same on Xbox. seems like signs of progress, though
---
The times I have checked Steam stats it always seems to be around 4k-6k at that time . I'm not sure how much the Beth launcher will have since you got a copy on steam if you bought it and connected your account before a certain date.
---
Try playing from Aus with a 250-350 ping time then get back to me on the fun aspect..
---
Thanks for your reply.
---
when you are in a public team, a player can no longer pull the rest of said team into pvp. 
---
 public teams are more or less going to be 1v1's now, where only the players who choose to pvp are involved.  private teams afaik are unaffected.
---
the "PvPer's" are mad because they cant  join the public team team (you can just join public teams, no invite needed) -&gt; start pvp with friend -&gt; gank the victim with the system
---
Signing in now
---
SOON
---
I mean is she really a PvPer though? She fits the “I can’t fight people that are actually skilled and I kill low levels” description.
---
My punch bowl has normal alchohol but i put shine in my kegs
---
Lucky
---
Are we playing this retroactively? It's been down for about 7 hours, so 21 shots sounds right. Here we go, people!
---
This dude fire bombed the servers!! Proof here!!!!🔥🔥🔥
---
Poor Bethesda nothing. It's horseshit.
---
Oh see I was picturing a Bike helmet, tight fitting spandex shirt and shorty shorts. Bright Blue with reflective yellow lines and some geeky looking cycling gloves and glasses....
---
I am going to kick you in the genitals if youre lying to me
---
No FO 1st access here either on PS4. 
---
Locked out, which is odd.
---
Edit: can't actually connect to any servers. FML.
---
Daisycutter, the 90% reduced weight Fat Man. Not practical in any way, and downright suicidal with MIRV mod without Fireproof 3 + Dense armor, but damn is it fun to shoot it straight in the air and laugh maniacally as everything around you blows up...and probably still not die if they're high level enemies.
---
As long as it needs to be.
---
Triple xp, 1000 scrip, 500 gold and that’s still not enough
---
lol. Yeah I feel their pain. Good thing they don’t know that we are going through the same thing they were. They might start assigning you chores. My son just start laughing and giving me crap but I am doing my best to not let it get to me rn. 
---
I really just wanted to go “shopping” and drop a nuke and kill a few things before bed. But now It’s looking more likely that I will be as disappointed as when I was married and was getting ready for “bed”. Sad day.
---
Right there with ya.
---
Yeah but its not consistent, I just alt f4'd and its back to the 3:0:9 error, when i press a button on the main screen and it tries to login, usually it fails within a second, whereas when it logged in, it sat there saying signing in for a good minute or so before proceeding.
---
Can confirm! They are up for me as well (PS4)
---
Purveyor 50% off sale too while your at it lmao
---
Recon and night vision are different.  Recon being better IMO.
---
Patience pays off? Was there any other option than waiting?
---
Is it a magic weapon?
---
Can confirm!
---
I had to try several times before it actually loaded into a world.  Now I see that I have 0 atoms after having about 1500 earlier today. Hopefully that will be recitified.
---
There we go. That’d be good too
---
  🙏🏼
---
Yeah. I wouldn't mind the spawn points for the boxes being completely random as well as your spawn point. Would add some spice.
---
Don't sweat.it will all come to you.
---
Wait, are you inferring that they are not providing us with 16xTheDetail?
---
1st thing came.to.mind was thw restaurant scene in Super Troopers where they dress as bikers. Her a motorcycle gang biker. Him a sports biker.
---
Thing is, there's nothing really in 76 that you can't already do in Fallout 4, aside from the multiplayer stuff.
---
If you want a single player 76, just load up Fallout 4. Plus 4 has mods.
---
The reason I enjoy 76, is seeing other players, hopping into multiplayer events, camp hopping, vendor hopping, and selling at my own vendor.
---
well I don't even have the logging screen anymore lol,  is just showing the random background lmao I bugged even more the thing
---
You’re killing me. Hahahahaha
---
Also just a heads up its a recurring charge so if you are on steam remember to go to steam account settings and click manage my memberships if you ever want to quit on steam, i looked everywhere.
---
Just be straight up with us. Say we don’t know shit is fucked, it would probably be the most honest thing they have ever done. It’s ok to admit fallibility, just keep and open line.
---
Same. Just went past the load screen, it will say world found, but then disconnects.
---
I'm not sure about that.
---
Do you know if you were born or made?
---
if you like pvp you can go to NW or grow up and deal with them preventing grief abuse with public teams
---
Me too, but the Atom shop icon is spinning and can't be loaded. Guessing/hoping it will resolve itself.
---
Apparently there's been a vanity update that allows skins to be added to small backpacks.
---
The fact you couldn't for the longest time is the only reason I did that headache of a Tadpole quest
---
This. I thought it was just me. No sign telling me servers are down.
---
If a problem this big isnt figured out at least what's wrong after 6 hours, they're fucking up big time somehow or not doing shit
---
I’m on PS4, so it should be easier to find.
---
Love that, role playing at it finest. Wish you the best of luck!
---
It's not, you can confirm for yourself whenever the servers are back online (hopefully soon xd). Not only does it not award Treasury Notes, but it also does not have the exclamation mark, does not show up in the top left corner whenever it comes online, and does not have a preparation phase before the start of the event proper, which all public events have.
---
That's a visual error. You still have amount of Atoms you originally did.
---
I made a post about camps awhile ago that got some traction.
---
Basically camp loadout A, B, and C.  Only one can be chosen prior to logging in. If you decide to change camps while in game it packs up whichever one is deployed and then you choose a different one to place.
---
Bethesda: Thank you for your idea! That will be £10 and you can only apply that really cool design to the board weapon!
---
Bravo, goddamnit. Bravo.
---
After going a long time without experiencing griefers, my fiancée and I encountered one. He is relatively high level with a good load out. He doesn’t normally PvP on 76’a Adventure mode but he will if it look like someone with similar weaponry wants a fair fight (which is rare). He was at his own base and a guy much lower level but with a nice gun showed up acting like he wanted to PvP. So he was like “ok let’s see how good this guy is” (can’t remember specific deets). The second my fiancée returned fire, a couple other dudes who were just outside his camp instakilled him and then started destroying his whole base. I started yelling “RAGE QUIT” so they wouldn’t get to blow up EVERYTHING. But. They did. Took a lot of inventory to rebuild everything. Fucking HATE people who do this.
---
Nope
---
Yes thank you finally someone has the balls to say it
---
That seems to be the common situation for everybody right now. Not much, but it’s better than seeing that error code.
---
Very true, but I rarely get the chance to do the event and love the backpack so it's a win win really
---
Only kind of can’t find server
---
Yes, exactly!
---
D8
---
I have no idea. I throw them and stuff dies usually
---
This made me think, it would be really cool if they added a dlc where you get to run a vault
---
Just be patient, clearly not all of their services are back up, they're still in the process of fixing or they would have updated their status page to show that things were back up. Until you check  [https://bethesda.net/en/status](https://bethesda.net/en/status)  and see everything back online, just assume any account issues are related to this.
---
There was a fallout 4 mod that had arcade machines that worked in the same way. Would be great camp additions. And could encourage someone to build a full arcade using the mr fuzzy and rocket rides aswell
---
It is for me but atom shop is fucked and worlds aren’t loading. No friends list either
---
I feel sad for veterans, i only started at steam release and i've already lost my patience, sorry to you buddy.
---
Has it been hacked?
---
😎💯💜💙💚💛🧡❤🖤💯😎
---
Saying it’s all their games not just fo76 isn’t an answer.  I can look at Beth.net and see it for myself.  So, that’s not actually any info that I couldn’t find myself. If all of their servers are down, that sounds pretty serious. Just say, we don’t know, we have no clue, I dunno how this happened, maybe it was bills fault ( joke)
---
proof?
---
I don't buy that, sorry lol...one flick right now...sorted by new...five or six posts about it. Another flick, another five posts. It's just finger laziness, and it makes no sense to me either. It takes a lot longer to post than to flick up once or twice. Not saying you specifically, just don't get Anyone that can't be arsed to scroll down a bit instead of posting a question that was already asked fifty times in the last couple of hours. Same for all the "What happens if I cancel fallout 1st" questions every day. I'm going to geuss people don't know how to use the search option either.
---
Divide by Zero is what happened.
---
I don't get it, it's just a free teleport. The way people were hyping it, i thought i was going to explode into a massive nuke or something. Was disappointed
---
Still not working for me. Xbox. Will keep trying.
---
They should add a donkey emote!
---
I also do not have any of my atoms, I had 3.2K and now I’m at 0
---
You’re not fooling us!  You’re clearly a protectron in a Sean suit.
---
Fire bombed? What does that mean? I maybe level 207 but what does that mean?
---
Same thing for every online game Bethesda has up right now. Probably won’t see the games fully functional again until tomorrow.
---
I imagined that I was not the only one to come up with this, for the people that love making really creative builds, this could be a really nice feature.
---
Maybe they have something like this in mind with the CAMP Shelters mentioned in the roadmap. But it would be awesome to have camp loadouts too.
---
I hope that’s the case, but that’s not their track record.
---
lol. Yeah I guess Reddit will get my attention until bed time. I was thinking about playing Skyrim but then I remembered that I got bored with that game after playing through it a dozen times with different builds. Maybe FO4, no I played that too much too. I would watch Netflix but I have watched nearly everything I wanted to on that during quarantine. Damn my options are very limited. Bethesda, hurry up I am getting anxious and need my fix before bed.
---
We'd be lucky to even get 50 atoms lmao
---
I’ve seen the same man in game four times
---
I sell mine for 5k, have sold about half a dozen now, I'd put them up for more if I could be bothered with mule characters, but accumulating huge amounts of caps in this seems so pointless to me, I enjoy running the event so if I make 5k off it occasionally I'm still happy.
---
I only meant to point on the irony considering the downed servers. 
---
I love the franchise too, and it’s not my intention to cast aspersions on you or your username. 
---
See you in the wasteland my friend. Soon, I hope! 
---
Be well!
---
I’m in a world kn PS4.
---
Haven’t been able to get past world found
---
Can’t find world
---
This. Thank you. Reddit did not show me similar posts and I wrote a legitimate question because there was no maintenance warning anywhere to be seen. Got two honest answers and six assholes complaining.
---
anyone else try logging in an get stuck in a weird unloaded world?
---
i could scroll the map, do emotes, try to stim. basically like a shell of a character.
---
I’m already not close to ok home probably blackout and open a perk card pack
---
That's how rednecks do it.
---
In hindsight, maybe the MIRV Frag having the opposite effect is making it more powerful than if it properly worked. Because now that i think about it, 9 explosions in 1 small concentrated area all being applied to one target is going to do a LOT more damage than 9 scattered explosions that each only deal their damage to 1 separate target.
---
Huh...perhaps frag MIRVs are the true boss killer explosives.
---
What? No!
---
Hey, are you ps4? Just got into my game!
---
I just kept trying to login eventually it let me to the menu and after that kept trying and after a few disconnects it let me in. It's definitely working for others too as the server filled up in a half hour after I got in. Atom shop was disabled. Was able to run and kill monsters normally in my toon. 1st seemed to be disabled as well. I'm betting they are testing the servers and it's on the last bit of maintenance
---
I can change my name if you don't like it
---
i dont know about the in game related stuff they are trying, but yesterday i noticed, on a certain sub that cant be names here, that some dude was giving away a legacy laser rifle, all you had to do was try to come and brigade this sub with "muh pvp" posts
---
Wait what? Yes I am
---
All good then.
---
I heard that this daily us bugged and doesn't even award any atoms
---
Same
---
Didn't realise it could drop that easily, in that case I'll make sure to run it more. Does the amount of returned lost cargo affect drop rate?
---
I’ll take your word for it. I was going by this:
---
https://fallout76.wiki.fextralife.com/Event:+Manhunt
---
Aaaaand.....someone nuked the event area again
---
Yeah nuka cola grenades are great. Also the mines to craft with inert bombs seem good the couple times I tried
---
That's pathetic.
---
Why so many down votes
---
It's bugged...
---
Ya it truly is endgame for a lot of us.
---
I have an awesome camp that I don't really want to dismantle to create something new to try out. They really need to look at this especially since new atom shop items keep coming but the budget remains the same.
---
Good post op!
---
Argh, I hate the powering up events with a passion...
---
I had to do it in combat today and felt like an idiot for playing.
---
Man, I just got my jetpack today! I was sooo excited! Only to go a slight bump...ugh...AP build, here I come?
---
Xbox is stuck on world found...
---
And I hear you on having watched and played everything else! The only other game I have that I haven't played yet is Witcher 3 and I died real quick every time I tried.
---
Because you need to get over it. Look at you getting all worked up about something you're never getting. Like ever. The petition can't even get 50 signatures out of a measly 100. Sorry if it's not the explanation you like to hear but feel free to continue with the emotional outburst
---
Hmm, it's almost like making a storage space that isn't unlimited, forcing people to leave lots of junk lying around due to there being no space isn't a good idea, if only the scrap box wasnt locked behind a paywall
---
2 hours later: Bethesda servers have encountered a fatal error. Calling all brothers with an engineering background..
---
I was able to get into a server on PS4 and bought a couple things from player vending. Attempted to server hop and now I can’t get back in. Stuck at “searching for world...”
---
So that’s the problem.  They keep skipping the optional stuff.
---
Try again! I feel like a giddy kid. Lmfaoo
---
Only if they finally give us a gnomestick skin
---
I dont know, I'd rather have the effects stay, but a different system used for engaging pvp for caps and resources. 
---
Like, I'd prefer the old system stay, but if someone hits you and you hit them no one loses their junk or caps. But if they request a 1v1 or a TvT, a timer starts the actual pvp, theres no risk of becoming wanted, and you get to see if they're inviting their team to smash your face in.
---
I personally chase after high level pkers and people who are 100+ shitting on level 20's, so I directly pick fights with people who are higher lvl and have better equipment than me, but you get to pick who your opponents are with the current system. Unless you're confident you can melt the lvl 500+ wearing power armor and wielding a Gauss Mini faster than they can melt you, you probably shouldnt engage them with pvp.
---
It was *made* by hacks, is that close enough? 🤪
---
Good night.  Hopefully can get my atoms I would have earned tonight first thing tomorrow morning, if servers fully work by then.
---
Nope. Still getting errors
---
Seriously tho - still down after 7h, unable to
---
Login? Pretty brutal, even by the abused fan base standards of Fallout 76. There’s a certain genius that must exist to keep us muggles coming back to such a brutally flawed game.
---
Bethesda is too OP. We can't possible fight against them to bring up their own servers. Needs nerfing.
---
when i logged on reddit and saw this post...as i scrolled down i only saw two that were within the last 2-3 hours...i see more now and a few that theyre back up.
---
 but in the timeframe i logged in...i didnt see it.
---
and u can check my post history i comment on here quite often so i know what youre talkin about with the fo1st ones...esp during fashnact
---
but sometimes i know ppl remove their posts if they get 4-5 comments talkin smack to em
---
so for someone elses refresh they might have been there but not on mine.
---
Server hardware degradation is the gradual breakdown of the physical parts of a server. There are several general areas where server degradation problems occur, including power, temperature, management and memory.
---
(Off of google)
---
Just started this game last week. It's soooo good
---
"I planted a new patch of razorgrain in my camp. Now I'm level 593!"
---
Good for you.  Atomic store isn't loading, can't get into Public or Private world, it doesn't see me as a Fallout 1st member...   So, nope, not up yet....
---
It let me in after this on PS4 keep trying to get in. It will let you. I got in three times and my friend once
---
No it isn't
---
They really are though. It just let me log in.
---
Edit: im stuck at loading the server though. https://i.imgur.com/jXoJnqB.jpg
---
Something’s happening, progress i guess.
---
It would be!
---
Two shot faster fire reduced weight auto grenade launcher. 
---
It is my event weapon. You kill, cripple or tag everything and everything flies high, specially during scorched earth.
---
Same. Just keeps saying “searching for world”
---
The atomic shop isn’t functioning yet though but I’m in a full world it looks like
---
Only as fallout first isn’t working and I was a bit worried about our info for first users if it has been off due to rumoured hack.
---
Go bows and arrows nothing is more punishing than that haha..
---
 [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dVLURiigzaw](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dVLURiigzaw)
---
Amen
---
Yea I'm just kind of sitting here waiting still .-.
---
I don’t care if your name is dildofacemcstinky.  I was just pullin your extension cord.
---
I guess that 'authentication' is why I cannot log in. Crap I am sick of reading about how to fix this mess.
---
Update... yup, hit set up authentication then I hit remove authentication and started like a charm.
---
Are they i cant get in a game tho
---
Them dang mole rats.always meddlin'.(shakes fist)
---
wow someone dropped a plan at the fasnacht event that i picked up c:
---
Yup! Right now
---
I loaded into a server then IMMEDIATELY crashed to desktop after running 3 meters forward
---
I like walking the map. But grinding dailies I will not give up fast travel. Good luck!
---
Best response ever! Love it! Are the servers really down?
---
No. I had trouble finding the one in the train car for a bit, completing with only three, and it dropped.
---
They just use hacks instead.
---
speculation tends that way.. seen some mentions of DDOS also..
---
one guy is just convinced the servers are over encumbered and will come back when they drop enough items to get under weight...
---
speculation is a funny thing
---
Just use the blood ragel outfit and the bandana that came with the wasteland raider bundle
---
I have a full set of sentinel that came easier than trying for acrobat pieces. Good lord that took over a month!!
---
3. A server
---
Still searching for world
---
I can log in
---
Also if you can hold your self then just don't hit back
---
Same here.
---
Searching for world for about 10 minutes still.
---
Probably trying to nerf Rocksy and Ward. Can't have people getting free ammo a month before they should be lol.
---
Someone drop a nuke?
---
The plot idea is genius!! No matter how you design, it will always spawn
---
Wait, you can leave the vault???
---
I would love this, but I’m curious how they’d handle reaching max caps. Also it seems a lot of the good weapons people put out for sale are on display, and not in their vendor. they’re just for trade/not for cap trade. 
---
Maybe they have a display 5 weapons with a “make offer” option. Though I would settle for fix trade screen.
---
What do you want? What can they possibly say other than they're working on it lol
---
Its not the craziest thinf but it is different.
---
Must be the only one who can then.
---
Some people just want to watch the world burn.  
---
Nice
---
They’re up if you consider able to see your characters but not play up.  It’s progress though.  Hopefully normal soon.  It’s only been like 5 hours 😳
---
No ur not allowed
---
I was online on xbox with no FO1st access. Fast traveled reluctantly and was DC'd and now stuck on searching for world.
---
https://venturebeat.com/2011/06/13/lulzsec-bethesda-hack/
---
They aren't getting in, just to the main menu and searching for worlds...  
---
Nothing is up.  No Atom shop, no Fallout 1st membership, etc.  Mine is just Searching for Worlds and when it did connect I got booted immediately.  A lot of the "its back up" posts were posted prior to actually getting into the game.
---
Witcher 3 that’s a game I played for like 30 mins then stopped cause it got boring.
---
I got my poor english from the US public school system..
---
It took a few minutes for it to find a world for me.
---
Yikes! I’ve been stuck on the “Searching for world...” screen for the past 10 minutes with no luck. Might have to call it a night and see if Bethesda performs a miracle somehow.
---
\- PA Displays &amp; Clothing Mannequins
---
\- More boss fights / areas worth nuking *other* than Fissure Prime &amp; Whitesprings
---

---
The stuff you pick up from the environment doesn't.
---
Oop, yeah, though I haven't been disconnected lately, though there bad Lag Spikes lately
---
LMAO. Me too
---
I personally think that Bethesda is doing a good job at making the game better. Obviously not perfect but I'm having fun with the game
---
Fatfingers😂
---
Bethesda games are down since early today.
---
Just give some time.  Sounds like stuff is coming back online slowly.
---
See with the right perks bows are actually pretty OP for stealth, unless its a scorchbeast then your fucked.
---
Then Just say it, honestly, people are, generally, understanding when you are up front and honest. If they put it out that they have no clue what’s wrong or why it happened I’d get it, it’s human to make mistakes or not know.  Just flat out say “ we have no clue” even if the community rips them for not knowing, at least we can respect them for being honest
---
Thank u sm
---
Yea, that's unfortunate as well, I was hoping to solo grind in private world.
---
Oh god a 3XP weekend would mean I would do literally nothing else with my days off
---
2 Cannon Balls
---
1 Moldy Food
---
speculation is all we got with no communication though. and since most of us have nothing better to do, its something to do with the time XD
---
Yeah, wasn't impressed. The show was awesome though. 
---
Glad you got in!!
---
dammit.. missed one
---
One moron compares it to BLM, another to this "cancel culture" schtick the neo-nazis are posting everywhere. sigh...
---
Well said.
---
Same so far
---
My experience is all of them sometimes, none of them all the time.  I’m looking forward to seeing if other people experienced the same.
---
See im thinking with this character it will be a pure roleplaying character, so I wont be focused on dailies, purely for my own imagination, gotta stimulate the brain during lockdown somehow
---
I have this idea where 51 players are radroaches with MIRVs and one player is a Deathclaw with Jingwei’s shocksword.  We all have invincible Vertibird and Chinese Stealth Suit. Please read Beth!

*Restarts Game* *Tick-tock-tick-tock* 
---
BRZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ
---
Guess I’ll play something else.
---
To be fair, it’s better than RobCo or The Enclave trying to fix it? Lol
---
Agreed and I didn’t get it. Still says searching for world... doh
---
Still can’t “find world”
---
Yup, on xbox here, can't find world. Atom shop is down. FO1st private world down too.
---
Really shows signs of intrusion and accounts getting deleted or a single line of code being turned faulty as to make it difficult to fix. Definitely an intrusion as why would devs work on a live server. They usually announce updates prior so they must have a private server for testing. Also must've been when they're out of office for timing and delay.
---
Which one had the best outcome for weps you think?
---
Dang it. Keep trying. It's a bit laggy for me but I'm running around!
---
You gotta learn a bit about how the internet and online services work before you go off on a tangent like that. If you've been paying attention to anything tech related you'd know there has been mass DDOS attacks across many platforms, it seems to be ramping up as of late. Its a bit larger than "hurr durr Bethesda don't kno nuffin'!" Because it affects more than fallout 76, or just video games. Many people lost cellular service a few days ago because of DDOSing, and if these attacks scale up further you could be looking at more than internet getting messed with, power grids, cell services, communication services can all get brought to their knees man. Its a bit broader than Bethesda messing up, its an attack by an outside party that most companies have very little defense against.
---
actually.. they tweeted some inane shit about looking into "intermittent"(ell oh fucking ell) connection issues...
---
I got 3 and 1 each of the other 3 rares. Never did get the omw helmet though
---
Something tells me the mangy mooses know each other
---
We all have our flaws
---
Ya. I tried and had the same results. I figure they're turning things on one bit at a time to see what caused the issue, if indeed it was on their end, and if something crashes it again they know where to look.
---
Attention Vault Dwellers.....
---
Assume the position.
---
Nice! Hey if you ever wanna play together you can add me. PSN is same as here. Hopefully I get in. Might have to try private server
---
Did.. did you just compliment yourself?  I’m seeing double.
---
I guess you missed where I mentioned my rifleman my VATS rifleman, I also have a Junkie VATS rifleman as well yes; VATS is broken.
---
push fire MISS push fire MISS (does that say 98% hit chance?) push fire MISS MISS MISS MISS MISS MISS MISS MISS MISS MISS MISS MISS MISS MISS MISS
---
You can't damage the target if you can't hit it with a near 100% chance to hit.
---
I have an entirely different actual rant about the state of VATS as well as darn near an hour of video to post about just how broken VATS is.
---
Anyone that watches the streamers on twitch knows how broken VATS is.
---
I am well aware that some weapons may inexplicably do more damage than it seems they should
---
For example I have a quad pipe revolver rifle on my junkie that does more damage per hit than his junkies  revolver pipe rifle, why? I have no freaking idea. Its a one star Quad  revolver pipe rifle its attribute does not even relate to damage its ammo capacity. I got it off the SBQ, just like the other one I see absolutely no reason why it does more per hit damage than the weapon that actually fits his build its why he is still carrying it, that and it comes in handy for dealing with lots of little crap.
---
You are also missing the point this is mostly about an attribute that should not even bee in our side of the game being put in our RNG we are not on PVP servers, we are not crafting weapons on PVP servers, PVP legendary effects do us NO benefit, I am not built for PVP I have 0 perks for PVP I have 0 hours in NW or Survival.  Half of my RNG should not be clogged up with that crap.
---
I don't use hacked weapons as that appears to be what you are actually talking about.
---
You'll get em next time
---
Are they updating the map and such?
---
I never take workshops when I play, It's not worth it almost ever. When I had FO1st that'd be the first thing I'd do on my priv server but that's the only time.
---
Truth is the first few HOURS they wernt even sure what the hell was going on.
---
Never even met.
---
2011 lol
---
Beckett's end quest reward is pretty bitchin'
---
Is the wrapped cap that matches the tattered field jacket rare? Never see much mentions of it but I've only ever found 1
---
Excuse me 5 hours?!
---
Tell me lol
---
They're all random, they have a bunch of different missions they seem to give out, like rescuing someone and sometimes you will be asked to retrieve a weapons case, thats when you get a legendary reward, its not that often though.
---
Glad I did it this morning.
---
Because of how the game is setup, one person must put an item up first, that opens up opportunity for someone to "steal" the item by baiting the other for a trade
---
display cases that dont look like ugly fishtanks
---
Ok, lets do some simple math. 1000 levels = 1000 perk cards/levels base + 200 perk card packs with 3 base and 1 gold card each. So you would have 1,600 perk cards and 200 gold perk cards, which equals 2,600 legendary perk coins. (With the old system.) A legendary perk card required 50+100+150+200= 500 perk coins to max out. Meaning you would need 1/5th of the levels you claim to have needed. That is the literal definition of being hyperbolic.
---
Oh and I do admit to having said 40% instead of a 30% nerf, that was indeed my bad, and purely a typo on my part.
---
There's a bug/feature where stable flux disapears from loot bags dropped around SBQ

That's how it was for me when they did it awhile back. My wife asked "What I wanted to do this weekend?" I told her I was busy: 3XP weekend on FO76.  Eye roll ensued.
---
Lol someone at Bethesda is sooo fired
---
That's why pvp in this game can't be taken seriously at all. There's no skill needed. It's all about what op legendary gear and perks you have. It's just use vats (literal aimbot) and shoot, or shoot a tesla in their general direction, and spam stims or quantums.
---
(Change)If somone shoots you, only you and the attacker can fight (current)before it was if somone shot you, you and your freinds could circle them then fire apon them until thier corpse was no more then a bullet riddle meat pile.
---
Servers are not back up. You get to the main menu, no AS, no FO1st subs showing, joining a game world either times out or if you get in it kicks you right away.
---
Sooo y’all related or just both have good taste?
---
My least favorite is Vats Unknown. It spawned at level 20 for me the day before yesterday as a level 80 turning it in. I started her quests at around level 65 as well. Felt real cheated that it's a known reported issue that still happend.
---
Traded it last week as a bundle for a legacy
---
Same thing here - Xbox NA
---
Better be. I didn’t pay 100 for only getting 2 months.
---
Was thinking the same thing
---
Pipe is life.
---
I feel sorry for you Nick. Your movies have really gone down hill as of late.
---
Are they all 3* legendary usually ?
---
Okay Karen.
---
When you get them
---
This admittedly is a step in the right direction. What they should definitely do next is 'Factions' similar to 'Guilds' in ESO. That would earn Bethesda so much good press from all of the actual Roleplayers/Faction groups.
---
Figures they finally get it working when it's time for me to go to bed... Over this garbage!
---
I was in knowing! Meaning I know your lying!
---
Would go great since it’s sneak!
---
Yessss!!
---
I would assume they are working hard and trying to get business back in order. Things happen sometimes. I would rather Bethesda be all hands on deck fixing whatever happen. Rather then wasting time giving updates. when they know what is going on they will tell us. Who knows we might even get some kind of apology gift out of it. Until then chill out and play something.
---
I've actually no idea who u/TheMangyMoose82 is.
---
What are you guys talking about? I'm playing on my Switch 2 on the moon *right now*
---
Yep.
---
I demand to see the MoleMiner Foreman !!
---
I have the Settler Forager and he seems to give me mostly weapon quest. The Raider Punk usually sent me to kill cryptids. I didn't care for the Settler Wanderer or Sofia.
---
Oh my god it is so much better than my house internet. House internet has like 700 ping because we live out in the middle of BFE. On my 10gb hotspot stuff just happens instantaneous, before there’s a few second delay. On overwatch it took about 100mb after an hour of playing, and that’s a 6 player vs 6 player game. Playing alone on my FO1st private server probably half as much usage an hour, maybe even less. I love how high speed it is.
---
Awesome, I can log in but no Worlds available.....
---
gimme my fo76 right meow Bethesda!!!
---
We do have good taste though I’d say.
---
Do you have a source or proof of some sort?
---
This is what we devolve into without the Wasteland.
---
Living in Texas, I noticed that FO76 is connecting to server farms out in Phoenix AR using HTTP methods and DTLS 1.2 for UDP game stream. Today it's not happening at all. As if the entire infrastructure is down. I'm guessing that their primary hosted gateways or load ballancers are down. Seems some Amazon AWS stuff in there too. Could be a fiber cut on a primary CDN backbone. Who knows?!
---
Exactly haha. Or maybe all black for a sleek look
---
Login, but can't find world to inhabit.  This is an improvement over earlier
---
Well you both made my day!  I don’t know if anyone wants to know about the time I met two MangyMooses on Reddit but, god damnit, they’re all going to hear about it.
---
Swear they said they fixed that too, but I had the same thing happen, at around level 150 I finally got around to doing her quest line and got a level 20 V.A.T.S Unknown -.-
---
There is still an outage
---
Reward: 1 ☆ Nocturnal Pipe Dream
---
- This makes you think everything will be 100% a-OK when you wake up in the morning after the minor outage.
---
This is awesome
---
Yeah. I saw someone on ps4 the other day who was lvl 1 and in Chinese Stealth armor.
---
This whole thing could have been avoided if they made pacifist work on a team/workshop. Can't go into pvp whatsoever if you're in pacifist mode. Cant claim workshops if you're in pacifist, cant pick player locks to get wanted if you're in pacifist, etc
---
 We don't care about jumping someone 4v1, but what you caused will break the fair 4v4's now. Team fights are going to be hell to get started now because of some people got griefed.
---
Mine was/is Stand Fast
---
It's a dark blue combat armor chest with a star. For awhile with the flag under armor I rped as captain America
---
I have a mutants with swing speed and reduced weights. It's my "forest" weapon. Such a satisfying sound!! 👍👍
---
We had 2 full teams come to my friends camp and attack him the other night. We adjusted our perks and we spanked them repeatedly. By the time they were done I had earned 10k caps.
---
I normally don’t like PVP but winning is fun
---
It’s already been about 7 hrs for me in Arizona, I’m jonesing lol. And welcome to the raider clan my man✊
---
Why 2XP? Make it 3XP
---
Don’t forget Christmas 2014
---
Yeah, I thought about getting it until I saw prices. Too rich for me!
---
I might have a tasty bourbon later.

---
Hopefully our accounts being backed up Bethesda sided is a thing. Xbox acknowledge us that's why we can get past error code and search for worlds.
---
I honestly can't remember, I think so, but you'll just have to try it yourself, I don't even remember the last time I got a weapon case fetch quest from an ally, it was weeks ago.
---
Damn... Those barrel shields are just genius!
---
Microsoft processes the paments for fo76 transactions on xbox.
---
At this rate I could take a shot of water for every 20 minutes the servers are down and still end up blackout drunk.
---
they dont owe us anything.. not a fucking thing...
---
that said.. 
---
Im really hoping the mob considers demanding MEAT Week.. Id be down for that.. its time
---
Why stop there?
---
I gave up drinking years ago. It was making me angry moose.
---
I feel the same way lvl 48 and this game kicks my butt! Especially robots.
---
Final Word, Perfect Storm, All Rise, Slug Buster.
---
Honorable mention for shittiest weapon possible:  Vats Unknown
---
Very cool 😎
---
At least 300 from me
---
Ah thank god...the Moon servers, that's reliability at its finest.
---
That’s exactly my point - there isn’t currently a place for tactical gameplay so there’s no real means of implementation right now. The content we generally get for higher difficulty is just enemies that are more bullet-spongy with slightly different special attacks and sometimes associated small mobs, not groups of enemies that require any real plan of attack or consideration of how to deal with them. The imposter sheepsquatch introduced some interesting elements and some consideration was needed fighting the strangler heart in the vault raid, so some potential exists, but many players don’t really go along with it. I honestly don’t want to see an attempt at pushing the current Adventure Mode version of the game towards this sort of development, since I don’t trust it could be pulled off well. 
---
I feel that a new mode (such as Nuclear Winter is a completely different play mode) centered on factions with territory expansion and border skirmishes would offer an opportunity to dabble in setting players up for starting as different specialty rolls within the different factions could work. Play different rolls to unlock new quests for that specialty and to earn contribution points to unlock different levels of gear of different types (instead of a currency you turn in to buy things, you just check out of a commissary loaded with gear appropriate to your level). Instead of a grind for gear, play to unlock new quests and functions that players can combine in fire teams or run sabotage missions or maintain a perimeter and keep players + NPCs going during a siege. This would need a totally different mode to pull off and the devs that would be needed to build it are needed to fix the issues we currently have in the base game, so it won’t happen, but I’m going to keep making noise about it, hoping some people join my bandwagon :)
---
Tell us how you really feel.
---
Not gonna lie. I was one sentence in before I started laughing.
---
They’re keeping them down just to P.O. OP
---
Lame
---
I’m talking in game items not my finance info
---
It’s not a Bethesda issue. They use Amazon Gamelift. Amazon AWS just had a record DDOS attack today.
---
Wut
---
and 10 missles
---
They must be hunting wabbits.... since they are so wery wery quiot.
---
Seriously though, what ever happened took out many aspects of their gaming platform. Shows how shallow their backup/redundancy planning is. All we can hope for is that they learn from this mistake..... But who am I fooling, they will give us a weekend of 2x XP and we mindlessly smile and think how nice they are (for running such a shitty setup)
---
I thought I was just high. I knew I made the lens. Went to take a picture. No zoom. Had to make another.
---
Whew thank god the store is still up...
---
Oh god.
---
Lol your on Reddit not a bar calm down
---
Great weapon!! Still have my first one. A level 35 J/E I got before the fabled tse nerf. That thing used to hit for 725 damage before sneak critcals were figured. Absolute monster!👍👍
---
Triple Scrip and Gold Bullion Weekend with no limits?
---
You could do a bloodied build if you've never done one before since just like survival in Fallout 4 which is what I think you're going for, enemies were just as squishy as you.
---
Sir this is a Taco Bell.
---
The reward is a low level pipe pistol, ammo you don't need, and a half hour of play before the servers crash again.
---
Moose are cool. And we use good guns. 
---
https://i.imgur.com/SRbLHoB.jpg
---
Because they've done 3XP recently, have yet to try 4xp or higher. lol
---
yes. this is me.🤦🏻‍♀️
---
I could use the 2x XP
---
To be fair, I don’t need to know anything about that, I’m a consumer. I need clear lines of communication, not a break down using technical jargon.  Very few people would even understand. But if you wanna go that route I can talk to you all day about power grids, I can explain how large companies pay millions for guaranteed power. I could say well the SSDT flashed and the t bodies weren’t connected right. But switching around at the substation routing it back through the 1000amp would correct it.
---
I didn't read your first part of the post saying last few seconds, so I was kinda like "okay the chimes are similar I guess" then the last few seconds hit me all at once
---
Lol he said hive mine.
---
Max lvl plumber perk should allow us to chamber any round we like I agree 
---
Sidenote; the combat rifle chambers .308 in Fo4 why did they stop this??
---
I can finally feel safe when joining a random team now
---
Yeah that’s unlimited scrap box got me. I am a hoarder when it comes to grabbing everything and breaking it down into junk. I need it otherwise I would have mules with junk. Right now I have 3 mules. Ammo, weapons and armor mules.
---
In my latest play through I played a stealthy sniper build and had a lot of fun with it. The new Chinese stealth armor was incredibly helpful.
---
Perk cards are awful, I can't believe the game even shipped without card sets.
---
because they burned the Wendy's down.
---
Plus we have huge racks. So we got that going for us.
---
I can see what your saying but maybe, instead of a bullet trade to engage pvp, an invite to pvp option like the "invite to trade" option.  Maybe also adding a wager mechanic so there could be reward for winning or no lose of items.  
---
I suppose the no legendary effect in pvp would be better  if they brought back survival mode.  But I mean lets face it, is it actually fun when when you and the other player can do 1 hit kills?  I may not have the most optimal build, armor or weapons on my character but Im pretty sure it doesn't matter how much DR, health or chems you have when the other player is dealing 5k-15k damage.
---
Super smart! How long did that take you?  Such a bs cop out insult. Just label them, that’ll work.
---
Lol it's gotten be before as well, as soon as I know I drank some I try n drop a tent near where I was
---
Dream big, I want 10x XP..... 
---
Does it really matter, they run a shitty shop and we mindlessly clap and smile with a little xp. I just want them to be able to recover quickly and not "have" to give us extra xp so we all clap like trained seals.
---
I noticed that too the other night. I was pretty damn confused about it.
---
FO1st private worlds are “locked” or inaccessible also.
---
Why would you care? We're all safe in Adventure, and on Survival people would be able to use the legacy explosive energy weapons all they want to kill each other. I might even hop over for a bit after stashing my junk, just to see if my armor stacks up. :D
---
Yeah the other games is the reason I hoard everything in this one. I barely use the atoms. It’s all about the scrap box for me.
---
Have an upvote, sir.
---
Click on the fo76 sub and there’s 3 dots on the top corner of the main page, it’s under flair
---
Oh, God, the whining I dealt with at work with students. Fully half the middle schoolers were crabby and bitching about it.
---
I meant on your account
---
I can log in, I just get caught in an endless Searching For World loop
---
(Xbox, Australia)
---
Best sniper in the game!! Just keep your eyes peeled for a max level one.  Perfect roll on your weapon imo. 👍👍
---
Lol right
---
Interesting, I am going to try this in my private once the servers get back online!
---
I'm betting its 7 hours 60 minutes, remember it just works.
---
My meaning is that for all the deserved griping about this deeply faulted game, I still am annoyed at not being able to get on for a daily fix. 
---
The outage is long enough for me to say, what exactly am I missing anyways? That got me thinking about a day in the life of your average lvl 92 mook - what keeps you grinding?
---
1. Login. Half the time, camp can’t be placed. Find another world
---
2. Head straight to Prison yard to farm lead weights for Ammo materials. .50 cal specifically, for Last Word, which has become the 3 star weapon of first resort for a sub lvl 100 player.
---
3. If no lead, Head to gym at Vault Tec University. Then check Flatwoods Motel. Then check Charleston Fire Hall as last resort - which almost never pans out. Anyways. Must find lead.
---
4. Find mining vending machine and farm some stashes. Return to home workbench to assemble some ammo for .50 cal and new snipe fav Slug Buster. Don’t have as much ammo as I want, but on to the hunt for Steel.
---
5. An hour has passed. The laundry needs to be turned over, and is promptly ignored.
---
6. Off to the mire in search of bloatfly glands as part of a pointless quest that will reward with 30x .45 rounds and 3 RadAways, to throw onto the pile of 90 already in inventory. There are  no bloatflies in the circles area of the mire.
---
7. But there are charred feral ghouls that would outrun Usain Bolt being chased by a bear, and they blink into existence a rad and disease causing arms length away where there was previously no sign of life. A frustrating switch from the weak-weapon (a Modded Tesla rifle chosen for its non-specific aiming requirements and ability to AOE string together multiple hits.
---
8. Ghouls dispatched using too much ammo for not enough reward. A gold spoon and a toothbrush. Life altering.
---
9. Head to Sugar something labs and encounter the true hardest enemies in the game - a lvl 52 Col Gutsy and a lvl 45 Assaulton. Again, they spawn inches away and there’s frantic flailing of VATS and much wasted ammo. The reward is a handful of Fusion Cell rounds and steel scrap. 
---
10. The kids are fighting upstairs, so a token yell of “HEY” in booming dad voice - but no movement. Still looking for that bloatfly gland. 
---
11. Longer than usual load time, going to Fort Defiance to deposit some Schematics just to feel a whiff of accomplishment in what has otherwise been a wasted 90 minutes
---
12. Access the Fort Defiance HQ command Center terminal. Server lags. 10 Mississippi, and it drops to the main menu, with a server disconnect error. 
---
13. 10 seconds of frustrated silence in the basement, wondering...why am I like this? What exactly am I doing here? 
---
14. Realization that the quality of the game, objectively as an engineered product, doesn’t warrant the thought and time I give it. Yet - the eternal grind of pointless consumables and the ammo sponge enemies that drip them out in wildly unprofitable sessions continues. Only a day long server outage can break the cycle
---
15. Closing thought - if Bethesda we’re able to actually make the game....fun....on a more consistent basis, they’d really have a mega millions a year property on their hands.
---
it's an event worth server hopping to, mutants evens spawn regardless of the event being up or not  and all mutants hold caps
---
Yes. 400k players pay for FO1st. That’s 4.8million a month, approx. .1millon of that goes to our unlimited scrap. The rest goes to their pockets.
---
The Gutter+15 S+max gladiator. I electrified mine too so it’s particularly nasty
---
People who own fo1st are pretty much getting the worst part of the stick sorry man
---
Im just bored AF yo.. 
---
IDGAF other than fluffing MEAT Week
---
obviously the post is a WOOOSH moment for them... lol
---
Let me just stop you right there OK. We already met behind your back and we also are not sure. We are kinda fucked now but dont tell him how bad it is.
---
We'll be lucky to get 50 atoms. lol
---
Good I'm not the only one have the year so figured something was up
---
&gt;Take for example the latest post talking about pvpers being cowards.
---
kinda hard to take this seriously when your to afraid to post on your main (3 day old accoint, 1 karma)
---
&gt;The claim there was that pvpers are a bunch of no life griefers who do nothing but bully others.
---
while it does not speak for ALL pvpers, it happens enough to be a problem
---
as far as the rest, you completely missed the point, with the new team system it would be extremely easy to abuse/force unwilling players into pvp with a "gank squad"  it only needs 1 "ganker" to join a team, __no invite required__ to enable pvp for all the unwilling players.  they are removing an already abused thing from a system that will easily fall victim to it.
---
Every week should be a three star enemy is a three star reward week. It's random anyway and 99% of it is trash or novelty.
---
I just want more scrip turn in. Couldn't care less about double xp tbh.
---
Travelers.
---
no information???
---
their server status page tells you plenty, sure it does not have specifics but it tells you they are investigating which means they are still trying to figure it out themselves
---
Servers down me too, says I need to purchase fallout 1st even tho I did a subscription for 1 year, hopeful that’s it’s just a glitch due to the severs and atomic shop and social friends list being down. I’ll check again when they resolve this and servers are back up.
---
It’s the reason I got upset about the weight limit on our characters. I was playing in beta and was hoarding everything because that was what you did in fallout 4. You had to hoard everything. So I did just that. Then I got in trouble because I had mules overweight with a ton of junk. Oops.
---
You a member or their board or how did you actually get a player count?
---
You'll be lucky if bugthesda even acknowledges that there was a problem.
---
Waco
---
I tried to complete it, but my game just crashed.
---
wu assasins pretty fun
---
LMAO! Oh I am sure that was the best day ever
---
But the suggestion was to carry another weapon anyways.... even if you need to use the pipe rifle example, it’s not like it needs to be bloodied to get the tag, and it’s pretty dang easy to craft a level 1 pipe pistol and throw it on your favorite wheel for legendary tagging. I’ll admit it’s not even something I always remember to do, but when I can remember I always grab or craft a pipe pistol before I head to something like Uranium Fever or Fasnacht when it was around.
---
Anyone else lose all of their atomic points?
---
how about everyone gets 1lvl up and can pick any non legacy weapon of their choice?.. but no XP weekend
---
Whats going on?

Don't pay too much, people duped the crap out of basically every plan recently.

I literally had someone start screaming swear words for not giving up my AA FFR fixer. That thing won’t go anywhere. I feel you.
---
I'll take this into account thanks
---
My point was that the guy had no idea what he was talking about and everyone else just blindly follow
---
I noticed this as well when watching the commercials on tv lol!
---
I only just found that the other day, I was stoked to represent my raiders
---
and the overhead is? the taxes are? 
---
youre taking that post way too fucking serious yo.. it ends off saying I want MEAT Week.. relax.. move on
---
I managed to get in. I can't access my friends list, but I can see who is in the server. I can't place my tent (cause I worship daddy Todd and I have one of THOSE). It took me approx. 30 seconds to find a world, which is admittedly longer than normal but w/e.
---
With “The Last of Us 2” coming out in about an hour this sure as hell put a nail in the coffin for me for this game.
---
Rumor has it, it was a major ddos attack at the people who host there servers
---
i thought it was kinda stupid we cant make a pipe shotgun. like the easiest thing irl to make and we cant make it in game.
---
I'll have you know I am a forensic accountant and I have scrutinized Walmarts finances regarding this game and dont find any mention of said money! Not 1 cent! I suspect fraud!
---
Thanks China
---
That on Netflix? I heard good things about and simply haven’t taken the time to look into it.
---
Said the hard edged, craggy man with a face that always seemed to be in shadow. He leaned forward to emphasize his point, "Anyone that plays a video game differently than the way I like is a dickwad. Like, a TOTAL dickwad."

See if you can play now. I’m currently playing on PS4.

it is mate, and is fun as hell, have the avatar felling too, give it a try i hope you like it, Dont expect AAA CGI tho, but good fight scene and awesome plot.

Gimmie like 5 minutes and I'll log off and then you'll get your turn to do ur grind. It seems like thats all everyone is doing-- wait someone just dropped a nuke.

When I hear about Internet People declaring war on a software company because the game, that they continue to play, isn't to their standards... I just smile to myself and know that these people haven't really experienced life yet.

They will. And shit like this will soon seem stupid.
---
You only get 20 atoms for playing 7600 hours.  I think you have your sights set a bit high.  Maybe 1 atom.
---
Atomic shop is down though. Ps4
---
uh-oh someone needs to go re-watch the E3 announcement again, you know where they said prior to launch that death won't set you back, or that it will be nothing like other survival games (rust/ark)
---
I’m in a world on PS4. Friends list and fo1st aren’t working currently though.
---
But they were able to thwart it, correct?
---
This wiki seems to classify all events as public events for some reason, even the horde ones.
---
I NEED people to validate me and my views!!!!

How's man in the high castle?

This made me laugh. Thanks for cheering up someone whose first night being able to play in a week was tonight yay.
---
Saw a Sheepsquatch and a Yao Gui duking it out. The squash smashed that poor thing.
---
Now why would I do that? ;)
---
Well you misunderstood that I pray on the poor souls who dare claim that one workshop 90% of the time I kill them before they stash their junk.
---
Yeah I was just seeing some posts/threads on that.
---
I was just able to log on no natomic shop though.
---
Lol! I just started playing about a month ago. Just before Fasnacht. I was warned before that I couldn't keep everything so I sell a lot of things or help out the noobs.
---
Just speculation, but I think it was them pushing out update 20 but it seems to have gone horribly wrong. 9+ hours of downtime is basically an unmitigated disaster.
---
Nah they are banning all the dupers lol
---
So is this still down? Bc I can now enter the game but It doesn't find servers. Plus my 1st membership is out even with a billing date set to June 24.
---
Reality Z its an ok Zombie thing but they killed off all the characters literally half way through so no real reason to continue.
---
I’m on Xbox and while I’m able to log in, I’m unable to join any servers. Not to mention no access to private severs at all.
---
It really has come down to what you say.  No skill at all.  Atleast if the legendary effects were only applied to PVE then players could explore more team based builds with the legendary effects.  Medics effect for healing, PA or bolstering for tanks and even suppressors effect for wearing down.  Players have already proven they can be friendly and work together.  This way we could make boss fights and events more fun and dynamic.
---
I’ve considered hardcore runs. Delete character on death.
---
A less extreme version is drop all items on death.
---
Fox News
---
Another update for you all - We are continuing to work toward resolving the issue preventing logins for Fallout 76 and other Bethesda games.
---
At this time, we are seeing some players manage to log into Fallout 76 successfully. However, if you are able to log in, you may find that some services like social menus, the Atomic Shop, and Fallout 1st benefits remain impacted. We are still actively working to correct the service issue as soon as we possibly can.
---
That’s smart. Glad they warned you. I was never warned. I just figured it’s a fallout game. Need junk. lol. Thanks Todd
---
thank god.. I am SO fucking tired of shitbirding..
---
Stuck on searching for world for 10min.
---
Don't tease me! Lol

*We Play Caravan at high noon on top of Watoga, be there or labeled as a coward!*
---
I thought I'd get off my but &amp; mount the tv to the wall &amp; it should be fixed by the time I'm finished - same as you can't find a world, the wives home, now ill have to do more work :(
---
You’re on fire tonight. Cheers.
---
That also happens to me as well lol
---
I was getting that same error code like everyone else but I tried 10 minutes ago and made it to the main menu, Only issue is the atomic shop won’t load, my Fallout 1st won’t load so I can’t go to my private world, and trying to join a public world yields an endless “searching for world” thing.
---
The thing I'd want from them is improved communication, telling us WHY the servers were down.
---
I remember thinking that the VATS Unknown was only bad due to the glitch giving low level variants. Made a new character during double exp weekend and rushed to lvl 50 for Daguere's quest...only to find that the VATS Unknown at lvl 50 still sucked.
---
Or how about when Epic servers got taken down and kids weren’t able to play Fortnite?
---
\*Loot\*
---
what you expected loot?
---
FO1st private world's down too
---
Are we down for maintenance? Or just down
---
Atom shop won't load. Friends list won't load. Says I don't have 1st so I can load private world. Just says searching for world if I try to join Adventure or NW. 
---
 Guess it's better than a error message that I was getting all day.
---
It’s letting me log in now but seems unable to find a world.
---
Lol, yeah I was horrible in 4. It was so different than 3 or nv, so when I found out you had to pick up the junk I did it with a passion!
---
Because the viability of those modes becomes an issue, which is part of the reason survival mode was axed to begin with.  Everyone wants to be the wolf, no one wants to be the sheep.  When you introduce a mode where you have a character expected to exist in PVE and PVP, you either end up with PVE being nerfed for the benefit of PVP (which is unpopular if the PVE population outnumbers the PVP one), or you have situations where people are placed at severe disadvantages to get items good in PVE (good example: The legendary rewards they used to give out in survival mode).
---
Ozark
---
Who the fuck?
---
The system is a large grind that amounts to 30% less damage.
---
doesn't matter now, since it's getting worked on. Even with all that long ass hard work, you'd get better defense out of an ultracite set
---
Anyone who sends a message to someone because they died in a video game is either a 12 year old or they need someone to hug them lmao especially in this game. It's super easy to avoid pvp. It does suck when you finally shoot back at somebody and you think you will live longer then 3 seconds but they have a better set up. I think alot of the people who get mad are people who want to use power armor but get murdered by anyone with good legendary gear.
---
Even if they hadn't nuked it some fool would've started throwing explosive bait when the event was almost complete. Either way we're stuck waiting another hour to try again.
---
Prefer Hungry Jacks
---
Just down.
---
 I just didn’t want to log in and have an empty account or something to that effect.
---
Same on Xbox.
---
Haha, my wife and daughter get home in 1 hour. I had a whole morning of gaming planned...
---
is there... steam coming out of the server room?
---
Fallout New Vegas for first time
---
I started a new character on New Vegas lol
---
I've got my eye on you...
---
I’m fine with a war on the brokenness of the game lol
---
ugh have my gold
---
I use Bloody mess, nerd rage, full adrenaline, +3 full commando cards, tenderizer covert op i get 500 ish sneak damage first shoot and 1100 damage with full adrenaline +sneak, with ballistic bock Psychotatts &amp; small guns bobble head you do 2k damage at full adrenaline maybe more
---
Nice find.
---
Fallout 76 PVP is a joke, compared to real survival games like Rust. 
---
For this reason, I consider Fallout 76 to have "no pvp" as in, it's not a PVP game... at all. 
---
Why... why would you do that to yourself? Why would anyone PVP in this game? IT. DOESN'T. WORK. PERIOD. 
---
Go play Rust. Consider Fallout 76 to be "vacation time"
---
Well in a way a guess that's maintenance lol
---
If you're reading this, put your hands up in the air, give Bethesda your energy. Only people who upvote this comment gave Bethesda their energy.
---
Honestly 2exp is literally nothing in this game.. 5x exp might actually be noticed.
---
oh sorry a hunting rifle
---
I got a 3 way better than that I will give you for free if you are on xbox when shit is online again
---
Finally, someone with the guts to help.
---
I was in for awhile then made the mistake of trying to change servers - infinitely stuck at Searching for World....  Please Stand By....  now.
---
Same. have been reading on the LFG in Xbox that some people have lost items
---
But then it would be a fair fight and those crybabies don't want that, they'll get their ass kicked there. That's why they don't play NW, can't get OP or cheated guns there to ambush some newbie.
---
DeJaVu
---
Last thing I read was that they were investigating what happened themself.
---
There is really nothing worth having to use it on..
---
I got in the Atom Shop, but not any world.
---
I assume they are on a workbench crafting new mainframe cores
---
I recently picked a two shot 25% fire rate Gatling laser. Primed it. Threw on Power User and Stabilised. Took it to SBQ. 1k of lasers per fusion core on a gun with zero recoil and dispersion. It’s like a cutting beam that melts everything you aim it at. Absolutely joyous to behold.
---
An honourable mention goes to plasma flamers for being utterly ruinous.
---
Just started watching Westworld. It gives me some Fallout 4 vibes albeit synths not being in 76.

Omg I'm so jealous.  To play fnv for the first time again 😭

LOL - Many thanks 👍

God, that would be so cool. 
---
Anything from the casinos in new Vegas, really.
---
Right! It was a whole new thing to do. I loved it. Added more replay to the game and more grinding value. Made me want to go back to places I had been before just to get junk. Also made it satisfying to see your junk piles grow and be used to build awesome bases. 
---
Still waiting to get in to a server btw. Might have got my hopes up too fast. Oh the inevitable excitement then let down...
---
Username checks out
---
Yes there are a few SCADA systems but none of them would effect power.  You can’t hack SCADA because it’s a closed circuit network. Everything is hard wired, connected by cables,  you can interrupt it for maybe a millisecond before the USD realizes there is no fault and continues. I’ve been doing line work for 20 years and any power company that can be hacked is in violation of the federal guidelines.  I’m sure that municipality got all their funding pulled. Have their contract pulled and be re-orged
---
i can't wait for mod support.
---
That was my first thought as well, modify auth and everyone having login problems in the same time frame... probably not coincidence.
---
They probably know at this point and are working on fixing it.
---
I've heard this fedora, is it rare? I saw one for sale in a plate for for like 20 caps once.

he‘s finally playing along and y‘all are still downvoting? shame on you guys, let the poor sod live!
---
Lol, LADWP is a joke, try again
---
Since i finished the main quests, i tried all the events, now all i do is the same 3-4 events that i like, the usual dailies, sbq of course and camp/server hopping. i found soooooo many stuff for dirt cheap that i am now hooked to it big time. 
---
but now i ran into this vicious circle that i have too many caps and my vending machines are fully stocked and are selling steadly as well. So to not get maxed out and lose caps, i keep buying more and more plans and dirt cheap 3 stars guns and armors that i can resell 5 to 10 the price... to the point where i have over 1500 plans and 50 some guns and armors to sell back and im soon to be maxing in caps...but no more space so now the anxiety is kicking in big time!😄
---
i sold all the chems i was hoarding as well, sold all the ammos i barely use.
---
So now i might need a mule but i just dont how you guys transfer stuff into a mule if you dont have 2 tvs and consoles or a friend to help. im pretty much a loner on this game.🤔
---
I got a plan I'm working on selling, I don't need caps, don't want legendaries, I'll give it to you for some 5.56 ammo if you want to trade
---
Bffr LVC fixers would become worthless over night
---
I agree that would be amazing!
---
I can be okay with severs being down if I did jt have to worry about having to complete my daily scrip and bullion count..
---
It's more broken Bethesda. During this time I'm happy to see this sub flooded with "Does anyone know whats going on?" It will make sure all 257k members of the sub know there's another fail. Maybe the rest of Reddit too. 2 fully modded Power armor's vanished and gone in only a month because of their broken garbage. I'm happy to see hate. I endorse it. It makes me happy.
---
So, I can get to the menu now, but I can't find a server to load into, and Atomic Shop loads infinitely.
---
It would explain why the game doesn’t recognise me, yes.
---
please no, you know they'd stick some cool rewards behind them and pve players would be forced to grind some godawful pvp in a game that was never even designed to be multiplayer
---
So do YOU
---
im not the biggest fan of the change but i dont think its that big of a deal
---
I still use that as a level 116. Aside from Secret service I think it may be the best chest piece in the game
---
All u ppl just point out is how my account is 3 days old, but this account's age is the same as your mental age. And btw thanks for proving my point u hive
---
I can seemingly connect online but it won't load any worlds. My fallout 1st subscription also appears inactive even though the payment date is for the 26th... is anyone else having this issue?
---
Oh I see. I guess I still don’t understand what it means to “dupe”?

 I don't know.

---
Wishful thinking. If not tonight then tomorrow. I only have about an hour left to get in before I say screw it and go to bed.
---
I didnt hear anything about ddos'ing, I heard things about people trying to crash the server by shooting hacked weapons but nothing about flooding the servers with network traffic.
---
Idk dude- maybe you should have a talk with your Vault Dweller! °~°
---
Ancient Aliens 👽
---
Maybe it's because the atomic shop is down. All I know is I want them back. Those points are expensive.
---
ugh, I feel this on a very deep level. I honestly am not sure why I put up with all this, but I do.
---
Your good just switch out the 3 commando rifle cards I put with rifleman cards and you should have massive damage for any bloodied rifle build &amp; those chems/ consumables give you a really good amount damage perked up or not 👍
---
I can tell by the dozens of replies you’re leaving in this thread that you’ve maybe had a bad week/month, so I’m just gonna leave you alone.
---
1st and shop not working for me atm, and constant searching for world
---
Some things just burn in my brain for answers...like you know when you're out in summer, it's like 90 and full sun, and there's always this one dude walking down the street dressed like it's mid-December and snowing? Or that one old lady in the grocery store wearing slippers and buying fifteen loaves of bread and nothing else? I just wanna go up and be like "WTF are you doing?".
---
Fallout 76 pvpers generally are a joke... among the players in Rust.
---
Can confirm.
---
I very nearly got it, it just gets hung up on searching for world. 
---
(USA, PC/steam)
---
Everyone's level 1,000!

Yes, it's been the same for me on PS4.

High levels PLEASE stop one shotting the mega server. Let us get some hits dang it !

Can you interface with a terminal?
---
It really is kind of ass that events made to be stupid hard in general or take a long time, often reward nothing but garbage for completing them x.x (Looking at you encryptid/SBQ)  
---
Most of my 2/3\* Legends I got from just hunting regular legendaries x.x far faster t ofind, kill n the like, usually give better rewards without sinking loads of time into them x.x
---
The first time it happened to me I thought it was player controlled lol
---
With Bear Arms 3, it becomes a featherweight "mean thing go boom" tool. It still sucks ass due to no armor pierce, enemies having innate explosives resist, and missiles still being heavy as sin, but it's fun using the targetting computer on a nuke code cargobot and watching the missiles chase that thing down as you maniacally laugh from memories of trying to shoot it down with literally any other build.
---
Those people with ARs why aren't they attacking police instead of doing selfies..
---
Yeah I agree to an extent.
---
so depositing the ore as you go does not work as well?

please explain, as this is how i usually do it, i collet 2 rooms deposit on my way past then collect the remaining 2, and return to make my final deposit.

Yep. Spoke to soon. I’m 4 in and searching

As a long-time computer gamer by night and commercial lawyer (four decades) by day, I am not offended by "Salami" or "MommySalami" by any means. And were I the one exercising discretion in approving or disapproving of it, I'd approve it.
---
But I'm not. Here's the relevant portion of the &lt;a href=" [https://bethesda.net/en/document/terms-of-service](https://bethesda.net/en/document/terms-of-service) "&gt;Terms of Service&lt;/a&gt;:
---
&lt;blockquote&gt;Some Services may require creation of a user name, such as a "UserID", "Display Name", "Character Name" or "Guild Name" to represent You in the Services, and which are tied to Your Account (collectively, "**user name(s)**"). You may not select the ... any name that ZeniMax deems in its sole discretion to be vulgar, offensive, or otherwise violates these Terms of Service. Subject to the Statutory Obligations (as defined below), ZeniMax reserves the right, in its sole discretion, (a) to delete or alter any user names tied to an Account; and (b) to restrict, suspend or terminate Your access to or play or use of any Service or license granted to You, for any reason whatsoever, including, without limitation, any suspected or actual infringement of any trademark or trade name right, copyright, or other intellectual or proprietary right.
---
By creating an Account, You agree that You do not own the Account, any user names created on the Account, any Content stored or associated with an Account (such as digital and/or virtual assets, achievements, virtual currency, and other Downloadable Content), or related data associated with the Account.&lt;blockquote&gt;
---
So you just &lt;i&gt;thought&lt;/i&gt; the name "MommySalami" belonged to your mother because she made it up. By agreeing to the ToS, she's instead given up her rights to it or any other name she might choose. And even then, the company has the "sole discretion" to decide if it's "vulgar \[or\] offensive" — which if course is an intentionally arbitrary standard which will vary according to the eye of the beholder, but only the company's viewpoint counts.
---
Language like this is universal in video game terms of service, and generally stands up very robustly when challenged through legal means. Generally, attacks on ToS leave the customer SoL (or worse, owing the company for its legal fees). 
---
So as I think you've figured out, your entire recourse consists of asking the company nicely to change its mind. I don't mean this sarcastically at all when I say: "Good luck with that!"
---
i enjoy the combat knife and ski sword.

it's fun to run through low level areas and chain vats destroy things.

I'd complain but I still haven't taken the 5 minutes to install the mod so...

I guess I got lucky. Only happened once. I thought they did it on accident, but maybe not...

I downloaded tale of two wastelands for the first time, really excited to play this
---
I don't do it any day so its meaningless to me to miss it.. All the items are pointless my default minigun does better damage and i didn't need any grind to get it.
---
The issue is the dps isnt there and events and quests with hordes of enemies are very hard with a bow. They're neat to clear a location, but they dont really have a place in the late game meta yet.

I would not blame them one bit if they went to the trouble of finding a working paintball gun, then located your camp and painted dicks all over your walls.
---
Yeah, it's because the sheer amount of energy from a .50 would destroy any sort of blowback action made that shoddily.  5mm could definitely work though.  The bolt action one actually makes sense though, because with a manually operated action all you have to do is make sure the entire thing doesn't explode, a much easier task than wrangling the sheer force into a functioning action.
---
My internet is balls.  But my phone be flying and my business pays that bill lol.  Might run it for a month and see.

Is she the event starter now? I've been wondering.

This might sound like a dumb question, but what changes did they make to PvP? Any info would be appreciated
---
Yeah, I hope I still have mine when the atom shop is back online.
---
I like the idea that our online characters are off doing shite while we’re not playing the game. Then when we start logging in they’re like “Oh sh*t my player is coming back, where did they leave me last? What was I wearing?? Ah screw it I don’t feel like it today... [Error Code can’t log in]”

Meaning you cant just go to a random enemy and blast a cap in their ass and expect to get bonus XP. It has to be an Event like Scorched earth.

Okay so then why hasn’t there been an update by Bethesda in the last 7 hours to tell us that is/was the issue?
---
Also it’s not working for me yet. I’m only able to log in but not join a server.
---
It's 2XP weekend and I'm so close to being a lvl 1000+ player. Was gonna max out my NW builds too. Guess I'm gonna have to spend my anniversary with my wife instead.
---
I knew it was a bad idea for Bethesda to have all its servers on the T-Mobile network 🤦‍♂️
---
Someone reported mine and I lost MajorPubes and got assigned a stupid alternative.  The game has npc's dropping f-bombs and I can't be MajorPubes.
---
I'm waiting to see if Beth will let me have one of my three other choices they said they would consider.
---
If MajorPubes are offensive, shave!
---
ha same.
---
Lucky! I'm so sad I lost mine when I moved camps! It stored the case separate from the lights :'(
---
Hey I knew I had heard that on my tv the other day. I thought I was imagining things
---
And to be fair the same logic can be applied to you be even responding to me. Why did you even take the time
---
Wait how do you get a phantom device?
---
Doing the same thing to me on my Xbox and I’m in the us..ugh
---
I don't do any events, honestly the rewards aren't worth bothering.
---
+karma thanks
---
Right, but if your goal is to get XP - then events are already a good way to do that. So giving an additional 100% XP on top of that is huge. Compared to very minor stat increases and a pitiful XP bonus on legendary kills for the other group types. There's a pretty big disparity.
---
Quad exp + a weekend no limits on scrip and gold.
---
Your URL is broken ...
---
+karma Np
---
Yikes.
---
It’s true!!! The PVP gods called for blood, and it’s here!!! 🩸🔪🔥
---
How are you almost lvl 1000? What do you do to get high levels?
---
So what you're saying is wait until they say the servers are working again
---
Wow!  Honestly just finishing it by yourself had to feel better than almost any reward you could get.  I felt that way the first time I nuked by myself...which I know is not near as big of a deal as encryptid, but that’s awesome.  Great job!  So now you’re officially ready to carry the rest of us right? Lol
---
I got bored i haven't even bothered, Reddit is more fun sadly.
---
seriously.. and youre shitting on MY jokes..
---
holy smokes man.. you suck at comedy
---
Come on man. Read the room.
---
Yea, multiple Bethesda games have been down for the last 6 hours or so. They are working on the problem...
---
I joined a server about 15 mins ago, all ok except the atomic shop and Fallout first stuff is not yet operational.  My inventory was otherwise normal.  All weapons, armor, junk, mods, aid, etc intact.  Proper dailies active, nothing lost.
---
2 drinks every time someone mentions taking a drink every time someone asks if the servers are down.
---
Thanks but I give up I'll just rebuild. It won't be as good as the one I built up over the course of the game. But hey in the immortal words of Todd Howard; IT JUST WORKS!
---
Oh ok thank you I will try later
---
Bethesda deleted a bunch of accounts this afternoon for cheating.
---
You have no one to blame for this than yourself :(
---
I couldn't sign in a few hours ago, but I can now. But when I try to join adventure mode, I can't find a world
---
My thoughts as well. Why not revert if they, Beth, caused it.
---
That's an awfully long bowel movement
---
They make other games for Xbox! I was surprised too
---
They killed my boy(PvP)😭
---
(desktop explodes)
---
damn synths
---
Do petitions work? Depends on who you’re appealing to and how many people back it. I’ve gotten several updates from petitions that were successful. If it’s a change you believe in you may as well try.
---
you sound bitter. get over it.
---
Wait so is the raider punk equally as rare?? Because I acme across him today in cranberry bog, can't recall exactly where but was so surprised to learn he was a companion when I started talking to him, now I just gotta wait for these servers to stay working again do I can set up his radio in my camp.
---
Finally someone with the guts to do something. I've got my eye on you!
---
It's as if .. the game servers were down or something
---
The servers are still F'd up, for whats its worth fallout 1st is showing as active on my steam version of the game but I cannot find a world. Are you on PS4 btw? Because the fallout 1st sub doesn't show in subscriptions, but services, apparantly.
---
&gt; I should show them some respect from now on. 
---
Don't. That's truly too much praise for someone whining about exploits getting patched out, just because they're too scared to fulfil their PVP needs Nuke Winter like the ones with actual (metaphorical) balls.
---
I played the original EQ in beta and then became a volunteer "Senior Guide" on launch, and for some months was effectively SonyEQ's sole customer service rep on the Rodcet Nife server. My phenomenal cosmic powers included the ability to rename any avatar, and my personal policy was to ask the players with questionable names to pick a new one less questionable, failing which *I* would choose a (humorous-to-me) new name for them.
---
And in the early days of EQ, everyone got to choose a surname at level 20. Before the company automated the re-naming, a Senior Guide (or more rarely, a company GM, but those were more scarce than hens' teeth) would have to manually change the avatar's name to include a surname. Accordingly, time permitting, I would always pop into the world in my all-powerful guide avatar, make a server-wide announcement of a sur-naming ceremony, and then role-play a unique conversation with the recipient (typically with a couple of dozen other players watching). This was tons and tons of fun, but impossible to automate and therefore impossible to scale up. Ah, the old days!
---
Why are you asking?
---
Anything else you wanna talk about?
---
Lol what happened?
---
I’m XB1. I quit the game and reloaded now I can’t get in a server.
---
lol @ you
---
Junkie's shovel w power attack boosts.  Honestly love roleplaying as Leaky Eye Luca
---
Same - my atoms are currently missing, friends list broken, but at least I can kill some fool that bought an osmosis kit off Ward.
---
out of all the hilarious replies to this post, yours is my favorite. LOL!
---
So in your mind fixing an issue in an online infrastructure is the same as warming up a frozen hunk of meat? 
---
There are a ton of moving parts where one change leads to another. Take a deep breath and realize that they want their source of income up and running as soon as possible.. if they know the issue then they will fix the issue.
---
Same here, at least I can look at some things...beats the error screen for sure!
---
I think they’re therapeutic. Just go through one-shotting scorched (most of the time), and then scrap/sell the weapons.
---
Launching a nuke by yourself is an awesome feeling, it's the moment you realize you can nuke whenever you want
---
As annoying as kids that age can be, it was also kinda funny. I'd never want to go back and live that age again, but it's amusing to watch sometimes.
---
They just found other stuff to be annoying with until Fortnite went back online.
---
hey check out: [https://bethesda.net/en/status](https://bethesda.net/en/status)  , also when you go to reddit changing sorting method of posts from "hot" to "new" can help you get informed about current/last minute news.
---
I feel strangely different somehow...
---
I've been playing since day 1 of the BETA and have tried to lvl up once a day. Usually during XP weekends I'll use up all my bobbleheads, xp meat, cranberry relish, xp mags, 3x inspirational in teams, well rested, launching all 3 silos a day, and hunting in areas with lots of Super Mutants or other high level creatures in the mire and bog. oh, I also am crafting a lot of ammo!
---
They nerfed most of the pvp combat out of adventure, and scrapped survival, to vaguely say they would revisit it, to saying that no one has interest in adventure pvp. It’s bullshit to cut costs.
---
Just found one on PS4.
---
I like the guys theroy that went something like.. the servers were over encumbered and wouldnt restart until they dropped enough weight...
---
speculation is a funny thing...
---
I'm on PC and fallout 1st is now working again, store and social tab still offline though.
---
I save mine on my main character. He has been insulted 14 times last I checked my stash.
---
Yup, dribbling down the lip of every nosebleed edgelord out to punch Bethesda's ticket.
---
Looks like I’m in. 
---
I’ve got no caps or gold or scrips. 
---
Inventory is intact.
---
I've been getting more weapon quests from the settler wanderer
---
I saw in another post that players are spawning in with WIPED INVENTORIES so I would wait until Bethesda gives us the all clear before risking my loot if I were you guys
---
Is the outage one one, or more platforms?
---
I lived at my old base till they evicted me when wastelanders dropped. That was my only fear te whole time!!!! I got lucky when they auto blueprinted my base. In sorry to hear that :((
---
I definitely think a wager system would be great, you both put an equal # of caps down, and the winner gets both sides caps + a payout multiplier (like ×1.5 or something)
---
My build isnt a one hit, and it's not too op either. I rely on stealth and quick and accurate shot placement to kill people (usually no vats unless I'm messing around with my shotgun) so to me pvp is strictly about skill, especially when you do have players putting out enough damage to 1shot. 
---
To me there is no greater exhilaration from this game than taking out a lvl 400 bloodied build with nothing but a stealth suit and a bow.
---
No offense to your mother of course, but I mused at this. I could see some motherfucker referring to his dong as "mommysalami"
---
In the world now on PS4...trying to find the scorched that’s always just standing two feet away from my wall and shooting it.
---
Source?
---
To be fair, it's because they were kind of straddling the line.
---
I'd love a full on Fallout Survival game.
---
I'd also love a full on Fallout Co-op 'mmo'
---
What we got was a weird hybrid that doesn't fully satisfy either the hardcore or the casual.
---
I think a lot of players dont mess with lower level players. I'm level 94 roleplaying as a raider, but I only hit players near my level and mostly higher. Late game builds scale really hard with good rolls.
---
Raider punk and forager spawn in the basementa of crater or foundation.
---
The real deal is that I'm living in Beijing, where there has been lockdowns from Scorched Plague for nearly 6 months, so I pretty much don't go out. My wife watches Netflix or Hulu next to me while I play. I do like leveling, but also hate grouping with strangers. My only friend who played quit a few weeks ago, hence why I just bought my 4th account and started leveling it.
---
I want all the benefits from grouping (especially with public teams coming out), without having to rely on other people. I can move at my own pace as a "solo player", but still get all of the shared perks, bonus exp, +3 to all stats (Herd Mentality + Strange in Numbers), and solid damage reduction (3 characters in bed with Empath mutation). Also, I can store up to 600k caps across 20 characters/mules, as well as up to 20k scrip for legendaries.
---
I have a good system for leveling, lots of great 3 star gear that I hand down from level 1 to 40, and make sure that my fresh-from-the-vault characters have all of the mutations and supplies they'll need.
---
It's probably not what many people would consider fun or their cup of tea, but I genuinely enjoy it.
---
Ah my iPhone runs off of straighttalk, that phone service that runs off the phone cards? With the phone card I get my phone data is unlimited and I get 10gb if hotspot data for 55$ a month. It’s really nice.
---
They forgot to fix the pipes, it gives more time.
---
Yes, it did feel good. Amazing wearing a full set of troubleshooter's armor before taking the pylons the Mr. Gutsy's and the Imposter were barely denting my health. I had heard the armor would also help when taking the pylons but damn it started draining fast. The quantums took care of that problem but it was still a bit dicey keeping the .50 cal on target and an eye on my health. Very satisfying finishing her off.
---
DONT TRUST THIS GUY HE IS A SCAMMER HE SCAMMED ME FOR MY RED ASYLUM DRESS THE VIDEO IS IN MY PROFILE IM JUST WARNING EVERYONE
---
Holy heck my dude
---
I've only been insulted twice so far, I just shoot em in the back when he turns
---
Also the same jackasses that initiated PVP with me and had their team mates level my base. Fucking obnoxious behavior, thank god they did something.
---
Holy hell my dude thats alot
---
If I post it fully it gets auto deleted
---
Found one on xbox
---
I really wished you got plans to remake this stuff, even if it was sole locked, as some stuff you can just never get back, like the veil of mystery....
---
Back up for me.
---
Found a world on xbox!! Were back in business
---
And 16 mini nukes
---
I finally logged in, my fo1st sub loaded along with my atoms, and I signed in on a private server. So maybe working for everyone now? (PS4)
---
Prob nothing saving lol.
---
I’m in! What should I do first?
---
I feel like that's an impossible request with how servers and joining servers is currently handled.
---
Besides that, I would still like to see the possibility to trade gold/scrip for random pieces of armor (it keeps the grind alive) but I do think that a factions quarter master with role specific equipment would be cool
---
Welcome to the "I can now easily grind treasury notes every few minutes" club. It's quite nice 🤙
---
I want the ability to put regular Nuka-Cola in the punch bowl.
---
Bloodied revolver perked with pistol &amp; rifle cards is so ridiculous, deals - 4\~5k dmg with each shot.
---
17 undroppable mini nukes
---
I was one day away from crafting my 203 right thorn armor arm hoping for ap refresh... this time. 
---
Way to go!
---
Do you mean gold bullion? Cuz if so I would say the guass weapons are worth it
---
Communication, that’s all. If it’s a chunk of meat I’d like to know that the grill is busted. If the server got hacked I’d like to know that too. Information is everything. Regardless of circumstances.  Do I need to pull my bank card? What info do they have access to? Communication
---
That is so true.  I felt like it opened up a whole new game.
---
I want my character to be level 76 with an extra 7600 caps and 760 scrip and 76 atoms from the shop and all quests marked as cleared. Seems only fair.
---
Always happy to have new people to hang out with in game. My PSN is d-m-storm
---
Are you missing items as others are stating? I'm not risking it unless they announce it.
---
Would you look at that. I found an exploit. If you spend atoms in the shop it glitches you past all the barriers and puts you in a server as of you did the event.
---
Interesting. All because of a bear suit.
---
Everything in my inventory is there
---
System. Country?
---
It’s literally been a year since they mentioned it’s coming “soon. Also frankly I’m afraid to say anything but great things about anything this studio f’s up because of this delusional circle jerk fanbase.
---
Have you seen the pipe shotgun mod for fallout 4? It was my all time favourite mod, it would be nice if all weapons had that level of modularity
---
Sign the petition on change . Org to bring back survival servers and they said they’ll stop holding 76 hostage.
---
I've only ever bothered to launch one by myself cuz players launch enough nukes these days that I don't even need to put in the effort of hunting down codes
---
Sorry I was in bata and just didn't know where to target so I nuked the most populated area.
---
That is awesome and super smart using that cola but with the quantum’s.  Some of those nuka colas are powerful with that peri, or at least extremely useful I mean.  Gotta try this...one day. Lol until then I listen for that sound!
---
8,000,000 Berets that's why they are releasing more of them.
---
Nor would I. That would be prettu damn funny.
---
Hope my nuke helped
---
This quest has been bugged for a year and a half. Doubt they’re going to fix it now smdh
---
Hilarious!
---
Same. I just trade for my legendaries lol. I'm still happy for OP that he did it. Grats to him.
---
Everything is back up for me, including all Fallout 1st content, except the Social Menu. Which is a pain because I wanted to do Nuclear Winter with a friend.
---
Xbox One, Indiana US
---
That is true...most servers have a nuke on them at some point that I play—which is exciting that players are so engaged in that.  I want the encryptid and project paradise to get that attention hopefully with play teams.
---
You rode the short bus to school didn’t you champ
---
This EXACTLY.
---
My Playthrough rn consists of "Fucking Around", I run a Semi-Competent Bow Build with some Heavy Gunner Perks because Arrows run out fast for my level 60 ass &gt;_&lt;. And I spend alot of time building in my camp.
---
So I was chilling at my Camp, Working on a Lake House on the Ohio-River, a Guy wanders into my house and starts firing off mininukes, I get irritated and laser him with my Legendary Gatling Laser. Than what happens next, I kill them a Good 3-4 Times but than they put on their Chameleon Armour and sneak up on me and drop Plasma Mines at my feet. It was so cheap that I just moved from the Area because that build was gonna be associated with that shit and I'd rather start over.
---
I just realised you can start the load bearing event, literally do nothing even on a private server, go have a coffee then come back 6 minutes later and you have earned 3 treasury notes.
---
I can second this.
---
Lets hope Bethesda actually decides to do something about their crappy security and buggy game.
---
Happy cake day!
---
I can join a public world, but no fallout 1st
---
Dude I’ve got a pile of some of the saltiest messages from grown ass men. I’m like super nice to most people, shit I’ve even given people stuff and shared my build to help some of them out. It’s hilarious when one side is legitimately having fun, and the other is 3 seconds from destroying their tv.
---
I wonder if Cranberry relish will stack?
---
My game is working now
---
I've only seen project paradise filled with players once so I got my chance to play that then and I've never been on a server with people who could complete the encryptid event
---
I know he’s not too common in the wild, but you can also find him at Crater hanging with the other raiders.
---
I was one day away from rolling a bloody 25 25 fixer
---
Sorry everyone, my bad
---
Server status on the website still shows down, could be per area maybe?
---
You'd be surprised by how creative hackers can get, there is a class of IT specialists called Penitration tester, or pen testers (since people can't stop giggling) there they're commissioned by companies to put their systems to the test. One of my teachers told us of how his friend got a job some place by just dressing in a suit, having people boss him around until he worked his way to the server room and took a selfie with the racks of vital equipment and a hand drawn map of how the entire buildings system was set up that an it guy made for reference. Then sent said pictures to the CEO in an email. The dude legit could have been slapped with a felony and locked up for a large portion of his life but they gave him a job cause "shit we need him on OUR side" pen testing is more than just trying to "hack" into a system.
---
That's not a razor in the commercial. That's an Improved Repair Kit for your face slot.
---
I thought so the entire time.
---
Just realised I should have kept that troubleshooters 25 25 fixer I had instead of selling it
---
Just got in on Xbox
---
Not really the guass weapons are ok but expensive, the shotgun is overpowered and will get nerfed, the minigun isn't much better than a standard minigun or 50.cal that took no trouble to get.
---
for those wondering about, a couple posted in discord...
---
https://i.imgur.com/lpCG99I.jpg
---
I thought that was him
---
Ohh yeah I always murder him after. I can't let such insults stand even from a bot. Haha
---
These guys and trap boaters are the scum of 76, you want PvP do it on even ground in NW. I do not want to fight the mini nuke minigun and the broken ass armour your trying push on me.
---
No, the issue is that they think *everything* is optional stuff.
---
I'm on PS4 and playing on a private server now.
---
I still haven’t listened to his holos. Feel bad so I’m ducking him.
---
Free atoms is free atoms.
---
And you're an angry person who apparently has a problem with legitamite complaints about a poorly programmed game, and has a hard on for me having issues getting through a couple ghouls when I clearly didnt. Don't worry, I block special people like you. I'm sorry you can't handle complaints since you're clearly a fanboy who won't tolerate any negative comments about a broken game. You should just go back and play more. Oh wait, you can't because Bethesda fucked up everything. Lol.
---
I don’t understand what you’re getting at. Literally everything was working besides fallout 1st. I haven’t seen anyone else mention it. You’re literally a waste of fucking space on this planet.
---
My second character was Heavy Weapon + PA, basely loosely on [Knight Wanderer's writeup](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/bgaoyi/end_game_pve_build_guide_bloodied_heavy_weapons/).  Spec your character on the nukesdragon's website and you'll get a tailored plan for which perks to buy at what level.  Plan on leveling with whatever trash gear/weapons you can scrape together until 50ish, where you'll be able to get all the necessary heavy weapons perks.  Junkies for full health, Bloodied otherwise.
---
I just want insult not to live at my camp and walk around insulting random things.
---
Trees, Beckett, the fire pit, beckett, that mounted SBQ head, Beckett, the rustic water mill, oh, and beckett
---
Until they remove them in the next update.
---
Good God, you don't fuck around.
---
Absolutely. The failure is on the Pacifist mechanic being unfinished and incomprehensive.
---
The mode is entirely misleading and does not protect the player from PVP interactions in any way. All it does is prevent the Pacifist player from being able to retaliate in PVP situations.
---
Team based PVP now requires someone to get greased 4 times trying to set up PVP flags that should be automatically processed.
---
This isn't something to celebrate. They've made the PVP interactions even more frustrating to deal with - regardless if you want to participate or not.
---
I would not touch this game with a ten foot pole for the next day, maybe longer, and I play it 8-10 hours a day.
---
I think I got it from a quest, Vampiric ultracite gatling laser, literally invincible while shooting an enemy with it, unfortunately it's only level 30 for me tho, even tho I'm level 93
---
This or let friends merge their camps into small settlements even with a few NPc's. Though honestly I just wish there were persistent servers so the world felt like it was evolving more.
---
I think once we have play teams it will help.  So many people don’t do it and then do it once and not again for a long time I think they don’t know what’s going on.  Heck, that’s still me on project paradise.  Only seen it once, but I watch videos so if anyone else does do it I will now how to help more than hurt...hopefully! Lol
---
I have to kill him because the insults are just so bad lmao
---
Same!
---
I believe it’s based off where on the map your CAMP is situated.
---
Have it for n cranberry bog?  You’re good to get a level 50.
---
Have it in the forest?  Lol fk You.
---
Up for me. Xbox/Pacific coast
---
Ps4, us Texas
---
Couple goals 👌🏻
---
I think we’re good to go ladies and gents. Seeya in the wasteland
---
Yep, services coming back up 😁
---
Just got in on PC
---
That’s a bit harsh.
---
There is a universe outside of this planet you know.  I’m a waste of space in all of it, not just the planet.
---
I still have my bloodied explosive flamethrower from around launch. It is so damn powerful &amp; I love it.
---
The only downside is feeling bad when someone notices it &amp; asks to buy it, then refusing to sell it because it's irreplaceable.
---
i got in. 
---
Smiley still doesn't have any gold. I'm still sad.
---
Well I haven't gotten the other ones besides the pistol and I'm loving it , tho idk how I feel about its perks, increases damage the lower my damage resistance is, +1 perception and vats fills 15% faster
---
🤣🤣🤣
---
Lmao God no, as I said in another thread, those limp dick gankers couldn't get there shit together when they said they would, let alone now.
---
Simple put bugthesda intros 2fa ( 2 factor authentication) to there login servers, 2 hours later login servers shit the bed, they spend rest of day trying to fix login servers.
---
Excellent, just sent you a friend request
---
You too man, you too
---
I usually check their profile before I help
---
If you want to go the extra mile, don’t use legendary weapons either ;)
---
she was resting at a street behind my camp, I got to talk to her and see died out of nowhere in front of me today, I'm pretty sad to be honest
---
Reports indicate it’s coming up for others.   Wait a bit and restart the game
---
PVPers and Griefers are not the same.
---
Second this. I generally hate PvP, but the legendary weapons had me and my spouse stashing all our scrap (and most of our good/hard to get aid items)  for a tense two-man stealth run through survival to try and complete the objectives and GTFO as fast as possible.
---
We had no interest in fighting anybody, and usually managed to get in and out without any PvP combat, but the weekly adrenaline fest capped with a cool new weapon really added to our enjoyment of the game. Heck, we got some of our favorite legendaries from those runs. In the end, we were actually sad to see survival go.
---
Only take a workshop if it's a daily atoms. And only at the end of my time login.
---
Yes! This! 👍
---
Same (ps4)
---
My god a lot of people don't know how evil robco really is, glad you do at least
---
It’s shown that people play this game cooperatively anyways. Rarely do I find griefers. Well aside from hacking plebs.
---
Thanks dude literally all I wanted to know, didn’t see anyone else post about it. I see where other people’s server are down but that happens for me once or twice a month.
---
People in adventure mode that call themselves PVP are sad. Can't aim manually and say everyone in NW is aimbot because they can't face the idea that other people are simply better than they are. PVP in adventure mode isn't really PVP, it's whoever paid money on ebay for whatever OP weapon combination is the current meta.
---
Then maybe wait and log in when they give the all clear.
---
Just because its coming up doesn't mean its all working.
---
It'll likely come up and down in waves until its fixed, not to mention errors.
---
Characters inventories are likely stored seperated from other parts of the service.
---
People are going to log in stuff isn't going to load they will panic or they will load start trading and muling and farming and it'll go down and things won't have saved that it transferred and get lost.
---
I'm antsy to play myself but we should just chill for a bit.
---
"Cowards?"  I think you meant "fuckin' nerds."
---
Now get out of my face kid.
---
As someone who has played 76 since beta, I wouldn't hold my breath that anything will come out "on time". Nothing is ever as they say...wastelanders was delayed by months, even other things last year were delayed here and there. If anything goes as planned I will be pleasantly surprised.
---
Although I do agree that it would be nice if we could get the loadouts sooner then later.
---
Huh! That's one salty little squeaker there. xD
---
As if Bethesda (or any sane person / company) would even listen to anything like that.
---
If anything, kids roleplaying terrorists will only drive Bethesda and the community as a whole even further from appreciating and even considering PVP.
---
I - as a person who  is really cool with PVP - definitely have to say, that if THIS is what the "PVP crowd" identifies as, that I'd appreciate Beth getting rid of ALL PVP elements altogether to cleanse the community of... /This?...
---
Heretic.
---
A what now?
---
Ack I wouldn’t consider myself an old player I played for like 2 months after beta then stopped until like 1 month ago
---
Yeah shit happens some times and cascades and knocks everything out. Like Amazon Web Services was out one afternoon one time and broke a big chunk of the internet. Could even be as simple as Bethesda doing some kind of unintentional software update and taking everything down by accident.
---
Thanks a lot! :D
---
Restart your game
---
Website says it's still down but I'm able to connect on PC.
---
bethesdas entire infrastructure is down, not just fallout lol. the forums, the creation club, ESO, TES legends, quake chanpions, rage 2, wolfenstien, blades, doom eternal, bethnet mods.
---
pretty much everything is down, crashing 76 servers wouldnt do this lol.
---
Well, I hope you at least get to play tomorrow! Freaking Bethesda.
---
Yeah, the best I can hope for is maybe creation of some more side quests with the settlers and raiders coming back in and trying to reestablish the various groups. Wish the settler in Flatwoods and at the Charleston Fire Department had associated quests.
---
But I want a territory grab mode and I want a system for effective and faction-specific gear that you earn the rank to check in and out rather than buy, so I’m going to keep blathering about it in the various forums, even if currently impossible and all the devs needed for it are needed for more important game fixes.
---
if u some how got on in the last few hours (not sure how u could) Servers have been messing up and not letting people on.  Might have to do with that.
---
They let you buy the game and atoms with spaghetti dollars though right? I mean, if they knew the product was going to be pretty fucking iffy even after a year or two, maybe fo76 should have been 20 bucks on release, if not f2p.
---
Since they charged full price for it, I don't think they care that much. There's one or two people paid to "care" on here, but the complete shoddiness of how each fix is implemented, the nonstop feed of bugfixes leading to new problems or even weirder, old bugs coming back seemingly at random... There has to be a point where it really just isn't good enough. The effort being put into this product does not match the enthusiasm it is being awarded by fans, myself included.
---
It really just isn't good enough.
---
That’s scary, no joke. It’s just not possible at my company without an armed incursion. I get where you are coming from though.  It’s possible, just not probable. Maybe at a small municipality,  but not anyone who works on transmission lines.  Such a LADWP who don’t own or operate transmission. ( those big metal towers that span the country) their transmission lines are operated and maintained by federal govt workers. Which are still over seen by the NSA.  And as much as we try to make everything automated and colorless by SCADA  90% of all of the switches still have the be thrown by hand.  Even I’m the substations we still have mechanical switches ( which are sick to watch when you arch 21,000 volts )

In Xbox actively in world atm 20+ people in recent

Certain one's are good and pretty easy to do yourself.winding path.heart of the swamp.mothman lighthouse.teapot.great for easy notes.
---
Services are coming back up.   Some are reporting no atomic shop or fallout 1st, then it starts working for them.
---
I got three melee weapons one time all three were 3* rolling pins. Definitely not just you but there does seem like a lot of crap to go around.
---
Well, thank you.
---
The only answer I was hoping and waiting for.
---
Hope this teach anyone that if you don't know, don't say anything.

You must be new to fallout
---
10 nuka cola quantum grenades.
---
And here's three pieces of heavy armor.
---
I’m online right now in my private.
---
This exact same thing happened to me thinking i ran out then I accidentally bought another years worth -.-“
---
They work now. Fallout 1st and atoms are disabled though.
---
Not all people in PvP bait players.
---
I paid 3 days ago and its saying mines out.
---
It is a nice idea, but I can see this going terribly wrong. 
---
If I find a camp and don't see anything I want, I just buy something. At level 225 I have plenty of caps and can max out the daily earnings easily, so spending 200caps or so on something is no biggie to me. I usually give it to someone lower level or just hold onto it for another day
---
Services are slowly coming up for all.   Wait a bit, then restart the game.
---
i get decent stuff, every 3rd or 4th purchase.
---
Oh lord. I make Nukashine all the time and I have twelve in my inventory rn. I'm not sure I wanna know what she gets up to
---
I got on PS4 about a half hour ago. It took forever to find a world, but it eventually worked and everything else is normal for me.
---
I noticed it stutters and glitches a bit more in NW. Compared to adventure.
---
On adventure I rarely experience much lag, while on NW it will spike randomly almost like a player detector lol. Since each time just about when it does that I've encountered enemies jumping around with frog legs. It's not all the time, but frequently it will happen. Then there's this strange glitch where certain buttons stop working. I can fix it though by pressing pause and unpausing.
---
Some stuff needs work I guess but still I've had fun in NW.
---
I play a Bloodied rifleman character, and normally rely on my FFR Fixer, or FFR Handmade, but I rolled a Bloodied Guass Shotty last week and I'm in love. It hits like a Mack Track, even level 80 Scorchbeasts get shredded in 2-3 shots in VATS. Without a single shotgun perk card when I'm under 20% it'll hit for over 1000 damage. Just like the Gatling Gun, if I go into 3rd person my fire rate is easily 20% faster. With 3 levels of Shotgunner cards, that's jump to 1400-1500. This gun is making me re-think my perk load-out entirely.
---
Did that fix your fallout first not showing up or are you just suggesting this because it didn't work for mine.
---
This dude is one of her boyfriends.
---
Careful, she has like 7 boyfriends, and at least one of them knows karate IRL.
---
Now all we need is them to sell random 3star legendaries for 60 scrip again
---
It’s part of the server problems they’re having right now.
---
You should go and make yourself awesome.
---
Wow, great business model Bethesda, really gonna make players wanna come back. Sorry that happened to you.
---
3*walking cane
---
Sounds like the best love story of 2020 tbh
---
maybe to do with the servers being down all day?
---
I mean the current garden tiles for gold don't auto grow. I'd even be fine if they worked that way.
---
That fixed it
---
Servers are probably limited atm.
---
It was on PC, Xbox, and PS4 and included multiple games
---
To solo encryptid with a gun, you'll need a ffr vamp/heavy gun (something with more than 25 rounds). I tried it with a troubleshooters ffr lmg on my heavy/pa toon, which solos it, and burned through all my stims/nukas before killing it.
---
Have been to a few shops in the first world loading into second for shopping all seems well
---
Servers have been down for about 7ish hours now, that's definitely what's causing your guys subscriptions not to show up
---
Sometimes I thunk there are so many bugs and issues,  they have zero time for qol improvements. Even if they are financial.
---
There's only a small number of legendary effects that are actually worthwhile. Most of them are useless (Ghoul slayer's, Assassin's, etc) and just clutter up the loot pools with useless garbage.  
---
Not only that, but the quality of the items themselves varies hugely. For instance, the melee loot pool is cluttered with useless weapons like tire irons and wrenches.
---
All this combined, means that the RNG chance for something actually good is not in your favor.
---
Also, rolling for 3\* weapons is usually a waste. It's more economical to roll for 2\* weapons instead.
---
How is that not PVP? As long as they aren’t glitching or anything I don’t see anything wrong with that. That’s mainly what I think of when I think of PVP, high levelled players in groups hunting down low levelled ones for easy kills. That’s even in like Runescape except if you are playing in survival mode you are always in the wilderness
---
The irony that a supposed group will crash severs to a game they actively play on just to make a statement makes me laugh.
---
Vending machines have been working since the last update
---
Keep in mind nothing is officially up.
---
Some users are saying they have no inventories or atoms etc, others are fine.
---
I'd personally be too worried about logging in creating some sort of account conflict and losing stuff for good or something.
---
Im just checking in after a while
---
The servers had an outage?
---
That was hilarious.
---
I like them, though they can be tough before knowing all the spots to go to. The bummer for me is I have never been able to power up more than two before I get a crash or bump from server, erasing all the effort I put in before I can get all three running or reap the workshop benefits of powering them up. Even on a private server, I have yet to get all of them fully repaired and operational plus claim and build in the associated workshops that get powered up from them before crash.
---
Is it taken care of?
---
Its a "Protest" on the recent changes to PvP. Players who are protesting are creating hacked weapons(s/a; Miniguns which shoot Mininukes in an Attempt to crash the servers). 
---
The Changes which they are protesting upon are that when 2 players intiate PvP, The Teams that one of those players are apart of will not be dragged into PvP aswell. This was in-part done to stop players who will purposefully gang up onto a Player.
---
 As an Example, Player 1 is attacked by Player 2. Player 2 has a Team of 3 others, The Team will not be able to contribute to the Fight outside of Emoting or potentially healing. Prior to the change, the Team of 3 would enter PvP, Resulting in Player 1 being cucked over by the Team and Player 2.
---
Exactly what I got on my last queen run
---
It's server issues, I have Fallout 1st too and can't load into a private or public server.
---
I have had a similar bit different issue for 4 days. I assume your issue is related to the current server issues
---
I have full use of my FF perks, but when I login to Bethesda, it asks me to sign up amd doesnt recognize that I already am. This is from days ago too not just today.
---
Do you remember the location mort was at? I need to go back to mercy kill him
---
What is this AF King you speak of?
---
I highly doubt this is them. That seemed like a pretty small, all bark no bite thing. 
---
If it is, then this is much more serious than an in-game protest thing. Deliberately crashing all of a company’s online services like happened today is a crime. An actual crime that people go to prison for. PvP in Fallout 76 would be a pretty dumb hill to die on.
---
You can do the daily for each everyday.
---
If you are managed to get logged in keep in mind game is still officially on an outage. So anything not working now is likely a result of that.
---
Yup. Sadly child logic isn't necessarily logical. XD
---
Idk about you, but I use a handmade in PvP and VATS has been broken for some time now. Also, never spent a dime on eBay. NW is a battle royale, PvP in adventure is something totally different. BR modes aren’t the only types of PvP out there. Don’t be condescending cause someone doesn’t play a game the way you play.
---
They specifically referenced sections 2.1 and 2.2 in the code of conduct as the reason she needs to change her name in the ticket. Those sections say that usernames that are "racially or ethnically defamatory, sexually graphic, hateful, and excretory in nature" and/or "Protected Category names under Federal or Maryland State law" are against the code of conduct.
---
Last I checked, MommySalami doesn't fit any of those criteria at all.
---
But, while I appreciate the Law 101 lecture, nobody is talking about taking anyone to court. Far from it. Not sure why you think actual litigation was being proposed by anyone? We are simply asking them to reconsider, since the system appears automated that banned her. I would hope a real human reviewing this will see that there is no violation of the cited sections in the Code of Conduct and allow her to keep the name.
---
If not, they'll just upset a long time fan and player of their games by denying her the use of her nickname. Someone who they've already recognized in the past directly.
---
I got in. Yay
---
Alright that's good to hear, hopefully they will be up soon.
---
Its also used in a car commercial.
---
IKR. Just like the powering up events.
---
Even though rng for armour is worse,  I find more variety in the demand for armour so I get pulls people want more often.  **
---
This list summarized my own thoughts but much better. Great post!
---
I want a million real dollars for my horrible pain and suffering... /s
---
no not really, exp hasnt been too helpful for me for a very long time, too many of these bonus are aimed at people who hardly play. Give us a limitless weekend with no boulion / scrip caps
---
Fuck robco all my homies repconn
---
Jesus, I wanted to be a lineman when I was a kid but when I saw a transformer practically detonate with a blinding blue light it honestly scared the hell out of me when I was 12, I still remember the hairs on my arms stand up and the smell of a fork in a microwave probably why I went into IT and not electrician work xD
---
You forgot, release self-hosted server options so we can mod it with our own stuff
---
It just works
---
I'm on xbox to
---
Awesome!! Lol
---
I liked that. Or better yet, half price scrip days
---
When you see a ranger don't worry.they are here to patrol and protect.from the mojave to mountains of Appalachia.
---
Gonna guess you already got off?
---
I hope so too, I'm bored af and wanna play 76 lol
---
Ya after I finished the amazing story mode and jumped online, I noticed a lot of bullshit and etc.. which made me jump on fallout 76. 
---
It's been a year since I played and heard news about it's updates before. Then I remembered about it when I was looking through my physical library which consists of 4 games on disc lol.
---
It's not really lucky, it's just how it is. In 1500 hours I've had maybe 4 people attack me outside a workshop and have never had anyone destroy my camp, not even when slap damage was still a thing. I have several characters and only one is high level so it's not like this is people just being wary of picking on a high level player.
---
This morning my wife stumbled onto a level 80 legendary sheepsquatch, and "requested" that I help fast travel to her and help her. I sent her a group invite, and fast traveled.
---
As I was fast traveling, she fumbled the hot keys to accept the group invite and alt tabbed to the desktop. When she alt tabbed back, the client crashed. Then my client crashed.
---
And then I got yelled at for sending the invite.
---
There ya go: a 100% true un-fun story about playing FO76 with my wife.
---
Yeaaaa that would be sick, do half scrip days on the weekends then we could build up our scrip through the week and get a shit ton of legendaries on the weekend
---
I got in you’re good to go now
---
This seems fair. I’ll be honest, a part of me misses the PvP features of launch, and the original wanted system and slow health drain, but I couldn’t go back now. People forget that the story of 76 is about rebuilding society. It is meant to be like the Wild West, with duels, rather than no man’s land.
---
Yes. Just finished a match
---
And 138 40mm grenades
---
yeah. Currently at about 9 hours for the outage.
---
Pc PS4 or Xbox?
---
What platform are you on ;p
---
Don't worry friend, it's just because their servers are acting up for the past 8 hours
---
Not bad at all.
---
You know what my favorite part about line work is?  Replacing something that has been up for almost 100 years. Probably dumb and no one gets it. But someone did a really good job.  The oldest pole I have ever climbed is from 1935 ( they have date nails/ tags on them telling their age) second was hanging from a rope under a helicopter in Yosemite valley attaching lines to trees. Either that or long lining during fire season.  And having a sweet helo pilot land me on a new pole let me tie in the wire and flying me to the next.
---
Good to know
---
I have full unyielding on two characters; one sentinel piece total with 180 modules (9000 scrip)
---
It's more balanced, but we still have Jotunn (the exploding fusion rifle), Last Word, etc. Not to mention exaulted (long duration) supers and rocket launcher spam. 
---
The difference is that PVP and PVE are two seperate modes, Gambit being the hybrid of the two and perks CAN be way weaker. Different classes are more accustom to different modes and have more ups and downs. It just isn't a clusterfuck using a movement system on an engine from 23 years ago
---
That thing is getting eerily good at his insults too. I worked on my house for 3 hours, next thing I know an insult bot is rolling up telling me my house sucks. My buddy dies in PvP, an hour later here comes insult bot to tell him his PvP is worst in house. That thing comes for blood
---
I can relate gave a guy a few dog food, water, and stimpacks, he have me a good ton of beer
---
Cowboys don't fuck around. They are too busy for peoples bullshit.
---
Can't stand him or that bloody prize bot. I'm trying to get the jump on a legendary Assaultron and all the sudden one of those fucking morons comes bumbling through the ambush yelling at me.
---
Needless to say the first few rounds cut down the stupid-bot just as it deserves, and then it's on for young and old vs the Assaultron. 
---
Thanks, stupid bot.....
---
They changed the way squads/teams are in PVP.
---
Prior to the Update, The Squad/Team would be dragged into PvP aswell. Resulting in Uneven Match-Ups and General Griefing.
---
Its RNG and bad RNG at that lol welcome to fallout 76 where you spend 1k script and get 1 decent roll and maybe just maybe 1 god roll. 9/10 weapons will be junk. 
---
Dont expect  3 handmades and 2 fixers when you spend 1k script lol
---
Do you my friend
---
That or just working storms in the bay and fixing lines for people who have been outa power for days... both are rewarding.
---
GTA online incentivizes toxicity with cargo tracking and what-not. I can really appreciate that FO76 doesn’t recommend PVP in any way unless you accept.
---
I think deep down we all have that masochist in us, don't worry i get the feeling too
---
But what about Beckett
---
Hahahahahahaha 😂 if I could upvote twice I would!
---
And drop all that duped stuff at last...
---
Todd loved that
---
 [https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Recipe:\_Cutting\_fluid](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Recipe:_Cutting_fluid)   
---
According to that its a drop from the guy you speak to in the wayward questline, the one who tells you he has been giving payment to the free radicals. I've no idea what its for though, as that same wiki says cutting fluid is just a junk item.
---
😞 dey twicked me
---
not even from the recent protests tho.
---
Just did the same with my yearly sub 😕
---
Yes!
---
Fallout 76 is working for me now.
---
A lot of people are on, have you tried again recently
---
You stop getting SPECIAL points at level 50. So really the only difference between lvl 51 and lvl 501 is more chance to get weapons/armor with perks you like and time to tweak your build. 
---
I’m 312 and while I can breeze through a lot of it, certain events are still a pain (or impossible) if there’s just me.
---
This is actually a standard thing in games with trading for **years**. now. Even Runescape and Diablo 2 had this.
---
Restart application.
---
I just bought an extra year by accident 😕
---
Report him to the rangers.we will take from there.i could destroy his whole world in 2 minutes.drop some orbital strkes and watch him from a distance freaking out...XD of course you need a wingman to pull this off so he doesn't kill you and take your stuff.your wingman kills you so the asshat gets no caps..then spawn back and finish the job.
---
Oh looking further, it looks like a way to convert items like acid and bone into oil.
---
The junkyard by the highway the workshop in the forest
---
 Oh, get gud? Just get gud? Why don't I strap on my gud helmet and squeeze down into a gud cannon and fire off into gud land, where gud grows on guddies?!
---
There’s hundreds of posts about this. Scroll down
---
I got it, but no longer get Legendaries from the Purveyor.
---
Joke's on you, I've been suicidal for 6 years, my dude. And I'm still alive. Ain't that shit funny?
---
I’ve got a two shot submachine gun that I’ve never used. It’s just been in my inventory. Might have to pull it out just for fun now. It’s only two stars though. And I think the second effect is +10% aiming damage
---
Lol ok
---
That sounds amazing, one of my bucket list things is repelling off a helicopter. And I've always had fondness for old electronics, I never knew the real size of those transformers and the parts up on those lines until I watched the linemen working on the downed power line on my street after a tree came down and completely knocked a pole. It must have been a hard impact cause a 3 foot long splinter of the wooden pole that got snapped in half by the fallen tree was embedded into a brick wall of my neighbors house like a damn javelin. My neighbor made the joke "so thats how paper beats rock"
---
I did this too with my explosive bow.
---
Speaking of that! Anyone having issues with private servers not finding worlds? Lol
---
My question is, if I go and kill ropper, can I report it to him? Or do I havr to make a new character juat to do that questline all over again?
---
Nope, still running around.
---
Hey heads up OP, just wanted to let you know that if you wanted to inform a user of a certain thing, put a u/ at the beginning of their username. For example putting u/Tamashi55 would let me know someone mentioned me.
---
A few minutes ago, I may try again tonight when the kiddies are asleep!
---
Why Gillette disabled comments???
---
Does the resulting damage make you wanted?
---
Cheers!
---
And if you have Fallout 1st and it doesn’t load up, restart your system completely. I accidentally bought an extra year.. I better be invested lol
---
A lot of people. It was posted on the reddit forever ago multiple times. lol
---
AND AN OVERSEER THAT CAN FUCK OFFFFFD
---
Must be invisible cause I don’t see you online on either fo76 or PS4.
---
Yeah I forgot about lever action. I think I’ve only gotten a few of those. I rolled a TSE lever action on my heavy gunner before I made my alt and sold it for like 20k caps. Regret it now since it’s be amazing for my alt.
---
Console or PC?
---
Whatever it is, it’s not the game. Bethesda’s entire online server is crashing along with any games relying on it. For how long this is taking, I’m assuming someone or something caused serious damage to the physical servers.
---
...and a random chance to recharge fusion cores while they're at it and being shot by flatwoods monster wearing crococolossus backpack in a radstorm.
---
I was just testing this against my alt account on a private server and the first return hit was doing zero damage. So they had to hit you back twice to start doing damage. I like the timer idea though.
---
No idea man, try speaking to him and see what he says? Maybe because Roper has been "dealt with" he may still give up the goods? I'd totally forgotten about it and just handed it in on my alt-turned-main and got a recipe for radaway, I got the cutting fluid recipe on my first character though as I remember seeing the option to craft it at a chemistry bench. Also  [https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Cutting\_fluid](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Cutting_fluid)  according to this it can be found out in the open world too.
---
Time to stack all my bobble heads and whip out my tse dragon to one shot this bitch.......OH WAIT
---
Forgot about that. I changed it. I do that do my sons buddies dont think he is online. It's an old account and he doesn't use it so the friends he has on here aren't people he talks to anymore really.
---
(Optional) Use community mods that have been out for years to fix long standing issues.
---
sad thing is, no one at bethesda will take part in this event.
---
Bwa ha ha I have 52 because of the mole miner event. I’m still drinking all the booze I got from that event... tis a good day to be a Party Boy.
---
Personally, I'm down for PvP but I'm not the type of person who enjoys it. Aswell, Its hard to find a Fair Fight in Fallout 76, You either can find a Genuine PvPer who enjoys the even odds or a Team of 4 looking to steal your Scrap and some Caps. Unfortunately, Its mainly a Team of 4 looking to steal your Scrap.
---
What sick fuck steals a monkey.....
---
Thanks for the gold.
---
You know, when I saw that they added 2fa, my first thought was "Great, let's see how they managed to fuck this one up."
---
*golfclap*
---
I laughed unnecessarily hard at this. Thanks!
---
Or just let us tame that guy so it could reside in our camps and greet visitors with some AAA-grade insults.
---
But they're just so ugly
---
Most likely a serious problem with Bethesda’s servers. I doubt whatever is happening they have any control over it, as almost all online Bethesda games are down.
---
That is good to know!
---
I bought a surgical mask, from a player vendor, once because I had never seen one before. I still haven't run into one since.
---
Whoops. That one went completely over my head. Guess I should probably stop browsing Reddit at 3 am.
---
Maybe the ppl that want pvp weren't playing around this time
---
Maybe they got swamped by the fallout community lol
---
I doubt they could do better than what the PC mod author has already done, so offer to buy it from him.
---
You weren't here for Fasnacht were you....
---
Also do me a favour and take a few Workshops on public server ;) Give it a try it's a great way to meet peeps I swear.
---
Update: I logged in for about 10 mins on adventure and my fallout 1st is working again.
---
So you’re saying they put more work in the credits than they did into the game?
---
Passion project vs MTX machine.  
---
Work of art vs business venture.
---
“Great”
---
I thought other players cant destroy your camp unless you engage PvP with them ?
---
...august 2021
---
I thought to destroy someone’s camp you had to be pvp flagged or something? No?
---
Very fitting as children only ever cry about the things they want and break the things they already have. 
---
Also Happy Cake Day!
---
I was there for fasnact never had a bad one and whenever I claim a workshop no one cares about it
---
Update: logged in for about 10 mins on adventure, 1st is working again for me now.
---
Agreed with your final point. Always 2* until you get something solid. Sometimes a good secondary can make a sub-par primary roll worthwhile, or at least become a few caps from your vendor. But a good third star is never going to salvage a bad roll.
---
Ill see tomorrow what happens. Thanks gor the info!
---
If I'm upset with somebody's prices, I just leave a bag of rotten food or fertilizer on their doorstep.
---
But the money Bethesda gives T-Mobile each month has helped T-Mobile buy a 4th hamster to run on the wheel that powers their network.
---
Someone posted to restart the console (ps4 here) if this happened. 
---
It did, I did and it worked.
---
Many thanks!
---
And yes, you're absolutely right. ^.^
---
I'm not saying that, but I know this much...
---
Whoever put together the credits, including their senior managers, managers, regular staff, and interns, not to mention thier contemporaries for 11 other nationalities, had one hell of a job putting that together. Btw, I'm still watching it for the first time myself. So far, it's been going for an hour.
---
No my friend she be a dirty bitch to us all. All slap no tickle. 
---
Convinced if I walk I naked with no perks equipped I get true RNG. I'm gonna do it soon. As she'll see my supressor and give me another 50Cal or power fist.
---
I bought a two shot Gatling laser from a player vendor for like 3k caps and I used it a lot on my heavy gunner just because it saved on ammo so much. It was a 3 star but I don’t even remember the other effects. It didn’t deal a lot of damage per shot but it still shredded. Only problem was how fast it broke lol
---
Yeah, mine was like that at first but a few minutes later it recalculated itself: I still have around 1,000 Atoms.
---
As for those worried about their Fallout 1st: Don't fret, you still have it. Give it a few minutes and it'll pop up.
---
Yeah I picked one up from, well, somewhere, about a week ago. Sorry I can't recall where.
---
lol pied piper'd you right to death yo.. for sure
---
Reward: 1 star assassins ripper
---
Off the top of my head as I'm not on right now, but this is how it breaks down.  Full set of Buttressed SS armor is 327 DR.  All Vanguard is 175, so 502 just from the armor.  Shielded Enclave under armor is 9, could be 12 with BOS.  Ironclad is 50, Barbarian 80, Evasive 30 (could be 45 with more AGI). 671.  Scaly Skin is 50, Armored backpack is 90.  811.  I might be missing something from a mutation or something, but boosting my AGI and switching to BOS underoos would put me at 829 DR with a full set of Vanguard Buttressed SS armor.  I can push 700 in my scout/bos combos, just depends how hard I want to tank.
---
I love Fallout 1st too!!! :)
---
Definitely PvP kill lol people want to test out their new PvP builds so they find suckers who are gullible.
---
Oh ok. That’s fair. If you ever see me on feel free to come visit. I may be a lone wanderer but I still enjoy playing with others
---
I dont have fallout 1st
---
Final update for this evening: The login and connectivity issues are now resolved and you should be able to head back into Fallout 76. We apologize if this put a damper on your adventuring plans this evening, but thanks for sticking with us while we worked to resolve the issue. 
---
If you continue to experience login issues, please send us a ticket via https://help.bethesda.net/.
---
Thank you!
---
This game - and this sub - really are some great people, like yourself. 
---
I’m a solo player, but the one thing I need to do is launch a nuke to finish that quest. Haven’t done the whole silo thing yet. 
---
Once the servers are back up again, I’ll hit you up and you can take me thru my first silo. I’m level 50, with great armor, weapons, and ammo, so I won’t be a burden. :-)
---
I got on
---
For a small fee of 40 caps you can blueprint your camp and move it and when you place it down it's not destroyed anymore.
---
I'm too poor
---
Yeah that’s fair, man. I think everyone gets a little tense when they can’t have their crack.
---
That's what I thought. I had someone shoot at my camp before and it didn't do anything.
---
Is it possible OP was wanted?
---
Here's an idea! Party Menu/Options; set by the host, and any joining members will have to agree to them.
---
Flag team for PVP? There ya go! Survival mode implemented in a more controlled environment.
---
Option to have all Train Stations as "safe zones or combat zones" for PVP.
---
Deathmatch or Objective Matchmaking; search for another team on the server looking for the same experience. Preferably includes an entire interior map, but using the Nuclear Winter circle boundries it can be done anywhere on the map.
---
The above suggestion can also be implemented as a form of player made event like a nuke, or random spawn location on the map "All in the circle is flagged for PVP" I do prefer this idea because matchmaking seems more difficult to implement, and you would very rarely match with another willing team.
---
The menu would allow you to access interior cells easier, Fast Travel to party leader at interior location. Would love more caves &amp; dungeons in the game. Explorable with your entire group, and a good ol' raid battle at the end of each one. Not to mention lovely level scaling!
---
Same to you! I don't have a mic at the moment but I can borrow one of the boys' if I need too. :)
---
5k droppable level 5 pistols but you have to drop them one by one like any other gun
---
Can you even do that?
---
lvl 100+ Dude dropped me (lvl 91) 240 Stims the other day.
---
It weighed a fuck ton even with travelling pharmacy but I appreciated them.
---
If you enter the workshop circle someone can instantly contest it and you become hostile to them immediately. As long as you stay outside of workshop bounds you're safe. Once you enter workshop bounds you stay hostile even if you leave the workshop area (to an extent, since it automatically ends hostilities when you get far enough away from each other).
---
So yeah, he was probably baiting you there.
---
Anyone else not able to access their fallout 1st stuff like private worlds and placing survival tents? It's saying I don't have it at all when I just renewed it last week. My survival tent is still on the map but I can move or use the scrapbox.
---
1* min level ripper
---
I want to go to there.
---
I tried wearing employee outfit, and a full Mr. Fuzzy costume, no additional dialog. Such a wasted opportunity for something fun or unique.
---
I just got one from the ranger office yesterday
---
Now get out of my face, kid.
---
Ahh, I was sorely aware of the fact that teammates would be dragged into PvP, been griefed multiple times. It's good to know that they finally implemented a fix that makes these kinds of things unable to happen. Thanks for letting me know!
---
Damn. I wish I could just buy an extra year outta nowhere like that. I haven't even gotten a month because I can't afford it. Lol
---
We got time to kill the scorched queen. Lets finish this first.
---
Ok ty I’ll keep hopping
---
Survival was the endgame and people wanted to change that. When they got their way these people got mad and are now using the easily accessible hacks Bethesda has done nothing to stop. Honestly this was inevitable.
---
The prize is making all of your quest items weigh 20 weight until you get rid of them
---
I think it's randomly awarded tbh. There's no rhyme or reason. Theyre usually shit weapons for me... Lots of gamma for some reason....
---
Np
---
Xbox
---
thank so much ,cheers guys
---
If that really happened you should quit teaming up with whoever was on your team at the time, because one of them had to be in pvp with those people and be at your camp with them for them to be able to do damage to your camp like that.
---
Just because you can play it now doesnt mean there isnt major lag
---
Ok that’s good to know
---
Indeed...but still...i really want to one shot those motherfuckers e.e
---
Ur on the right track. Swap to rifleman perks scrap hunting rifles to get mods try and unlock the 50 cal receiver there are several but they give the most damage.if bloodied get adrenal reaction serum think nerdtage perk helps as well.good luck.if your on xbox I can mod some stuff for you.might have some unyielding armor as well
---
They're still out? Damn.
---
Boy do I want persistent group camps! Would be worthwhile to take a workshop if I could return to it after logging off - especially with a private/party server!
---
Almsot my build but with rifleman cards.works good
---
PC and PS4 seem to have a lot of people that like to mess with low levels. Don't know about Xbox though.
---
Or maybe adventure could be renamed as survival and have adventure as the no pvp option.
---
Vault 94 was removed with wastelanders the way to get the plans not is vault 79 with gold
---
I've had people fight me for Berkeley twice.
---
I think it's because I make the place look beautiful
---
Nope, just a crazy Mr. Fuzzy enthusiast that hangs out with scorched.
---
Got one of those for sale at the moment, at least I think its tan. 
---
Like a pale white colour I think? Been a while since I looked at it.
---
Can bases be damaged outside of PvP? Like, seriously? I've never bothered with any of it. I just throw money into people's machines when I like something.
---
Neither can I at the moment, but my credit card could 😔
---
They can't just destroy your base like that, for any reason. We're missing some important information here.
---
Now, if you'd said someone dropped a nuke on it... that I'd believe.
---
This is why the experiment that was 76 died.
---
Everyone is a crybaby.
---
I just played for over an hour, though I was locked out for most of the day.
---
Is anyone actually irresponsible enough to be “in-office” right now if they don’t need to be?
---
They're too pathetic to warrant a post. But since they already got the attention they so badly wanted, I'll add this: they must be snorting some of the good stuff if the infamous damage bug hasn't been fixed since the beta, camp structures needing support has been a meme for over a year, and to this day more than half the weapons in the game have some significant issues preventing them from functioning correctly, yet they think throwing a tantrum and using hacked weapons to crash a few servers will cause bethesda to fix something
---
You can have up to 3 other players with you. If you are team leader they can join your instance, and fight all the mobs. Only you can interact though
---
I have this problem right now.  **FO1st Private World: Failed to find world. \[4:11:2\]**
---
That makes sense.
---
I was meaning just to be more effective at protecting the people being pylons while my bloody unyielding ass hides on the roof shredding robots.
---
...to be fair I already do just that with my bloody FFR combat rifle though.
---
Being bloody I can’t solo the event if I have my health low (pylons are a no no except to stay downed for 30 seconds so other people can kill the IS) so I’d have to change my set up.
---
Have an upvote. LOL
---
Shoulder pads use to be big in the 90s
---
He is a good guy and he has been through a lot.  I’d say to see insult bot wreck him all the time.
---
...scratch that, I’m sick of hearing about what he misses about gang life.
---
I always wondered about pvp engaging outside of workshop area. Thanks for the info.
---
Similar thing happened to me. Guy kept attacking me. I ignored him. I run pacifist mode. He keeps attacking and finally asks me to kill him (he was Wanted) because he had been trying to get rid of it forever. I oblige. Buy stuff from his CAMP.l and then go on my merry way. His CAMP was right down the road from my own. I get to my CAMP, crafting and minding my business, when someone comes up and starts shooting at me while I’m cooking. I was going to ignore him until I realized I was taking heavy damage. When I came back, guy is there destroying my CAMP. I retaliate only to then get jumped by two others. It’s now 3 v 1. I had to hop servers because I wasn’t equipped for PvP. I hate PvP. I believe that the initial guy was the “setup” guy. 
---
This is why I don’t respond to team requests or trade requests or anything generally. I just don’t trust people.
---
was working on getting all the "kill scorched with x" quest done before the bullet sponge update comes in this week. and i made a lvl 50 (45?) explosive crossbow. that was fun to use.
---
That is true, I was just saying that because some people may not know that you could gain extra rep from donating pictures for Davenport’s daily and all the rewards from vital equipment. It definitely helped when I found out.
---
Apparently i'm still locked out of my fallout 1st server even though i have a membership.Wierd??
---
I'm with you, total stranger. I see everyone eager to jump on now that servers are coming back up. No siree, you ain't gettin' me today Todd, I know better.
---
I don't know if you even play the same game... this gaming community is very toxic from my experience
---
I love nw too. I made a comment elsewhere about the cons, but I hope they make a death match mode.
---
I'm the a steamroller type of player. The longer I stay in a match, the more focused on it I get and the more my reflexes start honing in on stuff.
---
I mean I have won one nw match with another team mate and also last until I'm in 5th place. Still getting killed early then waiting around for things to start, screws with the flow of everything. Not sure why I'm like that. It's like a switch clicks in my brain &amp; I get mildly frustrated going through the cycle of going back to the main menu and repeating.
---
Either way still love it and it's pretty fun.
---
Joking. Joking.
---
J.O.K.I.N.G.
---
I was just being facetious about the whole waiting for servers being down. The comment was aimed at having to find a part that was missing to get the server back online. Sorry if that got lost in putting on here.
---
In your vending machine? What’s your psn I’ll take a look.
---
The whitespring is the usual target now that fasnacht is over.
---
What event?
---
My level 4 mule jumps around buying all cheap legendaries for scrip. I've got 5 pieces of deep pocket weapon weight reduction gear (to help with the haul) and a modded quad FFR pipe pistol.
---
People often try to drop stuff for me or trade me stuff, even though I may just have spent 10k at their vendor. I don't have an easy way to say no thank you, and I hate using the thumbs down emote.
---
I usually just don't pick it up, but one time I had a guy follow me to 2 different camps trying to get me to pick up some aid items. Shooting at the bag, doing the gift emote, jumping around, and talking in Area chat (which I have turned off). I felt bad because I think maybe he thought I was just some clueless low level character who didn't know to accept his generosity.
---
If you're out there, 091523475 (or something like that), thank you for trying to be a nice person.
---
Pipe fatman or Pipe Gauss lmao
---
I haven't slept in 36 hours. It went over my head.
---
Id like some starfield gameplay if thats not asking too much.
---
This.  I think sometimes Bethesda just wants me to stay overencumbered and wondering why.  Funny and very annoying that most of the side quests in wastelanders rewarded nothing but auto grenade launchers, missiles and tons of 40mm grenades.  WTF.  How the hell is that RNG?  That was by DESIGN.   I just got into the habit of automatically throwing down a bag of useless crap after every fetch mission.
---
Ah, sorry bud. I'm PC 😣
---
Better than the crap I actually get most of the time.
---
Or I can just post it too? I just spent money I didn't need to I rushed to make a post.
---
Bummer. Thanx tho.
---
Great power brings great ugliness unless it's a fatman
---
For them pvp is spamming quantums and stealth boys. If you kill them they take out hacked guns out.
---
I can get my bloodied bolt action up too 1200. Fucks my agility up to have that many gunslinger perks but it’s still cool too see it go that high.
---
15 bucks, little man, put that s*** in my hand
---
Send him to YouTube?
---
I like them for plunking before starting full combat - like using a black powder rifle but silent. Hoping they do stay lower power than guns, though, since there’s no good reason for an arrow to have more stopping power than a rifle round. Poison or explosive can do to be buffed, though!
---
I have a badass vampires swing speed reduced weight spiked chef's rolling pin that really isn't THAT bad as a viable weapon.  Kind of fun to run around with once in a while.  I also kind of dig knuckles and boxing gloves.
---
Rather annoy someone on here rather then the customer service rep for Bethesda.
---
That's how I feel about the Settler Wanderer ally lol, I prefer to listen to my forager say "Pull my finger kid! Oop..too late!"
---
LOL there was always "That Guy" at fasnacht telling everyone not to one shot the sloth, only to be completely ignored.  I hardly even tried to get a hit most parades.
---
Goodluck in your search! 
---
If it's any help I found mine at the little antique museum place outside of Watoga.
---
I did just start a year of it. It's been super freeing, especially the survival tent and scrapbox. Would be nice if they added a scrap option for weapons and armor in the survival tent though! Haven't tried the private server yet.
---
If you don’t deposit all 100 ore at once then you’ll have to deal with Deathclaws, floaters and snarlygasters. On top of the ghouls. If you deposit all the ore at once the event will end before or at the same time that the extra enemies spawn
---
Not as choppy as public for sure
---
I was having connection problems with a few different service info sites I use for work today at home and work, and my kid couldn't get on Minecraft this morning or WOW this evening either. Seems like something is up on a wider scale maybe.
---
I did it once.  ONCE.
---
He'd rather watch me play the game than people on YouTube
---
really! Never noticed any choppiness. Maybe i should avoid it to not get spoiled. Currently loving vendor hopping though.
---
Bring back Survival mode. Before some one says. Go play NW. Battle Royale and Survival are two different types of PvP! I enjoy the gear I’ve collected since beta and the characters I’ve created! This is an online apocalyptic survival game, why can’t we have that survival against other players element?
---
Thank you for the quick response! That's actually really awesome you can do it with 3 players. Robot quests make my stomach turn.
---
No problem. I had a lot of gaps in my knowledge of the weird pvp rules in this game so I took advantage of having two accounts to pvp with myself to figure out as much of it as I could. Now I hear they're making more changes soon so I'll have to figure it out again I guess.
---
He sounds like a true leader, I would follow him.
---
Metro series has a few handmades.
---
Bastard SMG and the double barrels are basically the same as pipe guns in Fallout.
---
Bastard SMG earned it's name because it's a Bastard to make work
---
Do want you cause a pirate is free!
---
At least the atom shop is working. I said it.
---
What a hero
---
Just tried to log on in the UK &amp; got the whole connectivity issues thing myself. Logged out same thing. Kept telling me I had no internet &amp; that Beth servers were up. Finally let me in after 5 mins
---
Just bought it and can confirm you can!
---
Is it still in your quest log?
---
Stock too in most cases. They're pretty ez to make tho 
---
You have to be one strong ass mofo to pump out lead without a stock.
---
Priority Responder Message Incoming:  Immediate evacuation of the Bethesda Servers required due to swarming vermin. Burrowing in this area does reveal salvage only well equipped personnel can recover.  Civilians must remain clear while the bells ring.
---
Now THAT'S some vital equipment!
---
What a woman, lol! Good deal, sounds like my wife, lol.
---
Ty I heard that was another good head gear spawn. 🙏🏻
---
Yeah, I'm on PS4 and saw the same guy a few times in a week during Fasnacht. Let's just say he has a memorable name. To be fair, I was server hopping quite a bit for beeswax.
---
Used to be you'd only bump into familiar faces in Survival (looking at you, Trill Cosby).
---
Mort is the ghoul in the wayward, you're probably thinking of Lou.
---
Awww
---
Oh yaaa you're right
---
Or, you know, if the game didn't only pop up some weird "login error" with an obscure nowhere-to-be-found error code...
---
they will just come and clear you out with a mule..
---
I have never been a fan of PvP in the game, especially because the more sluggish controls aren’t meant for it. I love how fallout feels, and I don’t mean “sluggish” in a bad way - you aren’t supposed to feel like an action hero. It’s just that it doesn’t feel right, and it is hard for me to fight for that reason.
---
At least you can access him here. I once had him floating like 15 feet on top of his trailer. I had to jump up at just the right spot to get him to enter dialogue. LOL
---
That's funny, because I can't get into a private world I paid extra money for. What a shitshow.
---
No, the dick move is the ant one that has the -carry weight debuff after a bit
---
I've mentioned the multiple camps idea before.
---
My one suggestion for displays is to give non owners the ability to examine the item in the display.  When I see a super sledge in your display I want to know what's special about it.
---
Definitely Buzzblade pre-nerf/bug fix.
---
Oh I definetly agree, I just meant like as a Side Activity.
---
Right as I searched for the key here, I saw it on a side table...
---
Metro has one so it isn't as if they can't peek the design a little
---
Anyone else missing the possum tadpole badges? Is this something that happened during the outage?
---
I actually like Hunter v Hunted, but I always feel like it ends up as a game of hide and seek. In fact, whenever I encounter my target, they often let me kill them for finding them!
---
If only explosives weren’t nerfed to hell...
---
I had been looking for this for a while to post it,  i get flashbacks whenever i here it.
---
Carry a fixer on you increases your chance for a drop. I have got 10.
---
Yup, ranger office still spawns
---
Check the vet area with the dead beaver too though, it had a chance to spawn in there too
---
It’s rare to see Hunter v Hunted, but because it’s so rare, if you start it, people are quick to jump in!
---
For once, he isn't asleep in his bed while everyone else is working.
---
Can’t launch a nuke  it won’t progress any in launch prep.  Don’t know if it’s a fluke or something new
---
It’s because your a foodie paladin bailey, have you ever heard of good weapons? You should try one, oh wait you haven’t heard of one because you’d just scrip it
---
The dude just creepin in the background 😂
---
Had a lvl 15 come into my base while me and my bro were playing. Nagged us for 30 mins to let him join our team and do a mission with him. Finally added him to the team and as soon as we did 4 high level players FT into my base. The lvl 15 went over to one of the high levels, took a shot from him and shot back, made our team and my base hostile and the proceeded to SHRED through my base before I realized what was going on. Immediately logged out of the server but damage was done.
---
Yup this can still happen if you own a workshop. I saw a YouTuber pvp a workshop owner while his teammate destroyed the players camp he was attacking.
---
Depends on the workshop. I'm in the 400s and show up to help with defend events then leave. If I want workshops I'll go to a private, I'm still scarred from the days when people could start workshop PvP and attack you out of nowhere on the whole other side of the map.
---
Once it’s taken care of, you’ll have to reboot the server. Again.
---
Yup.
---
They’d have to take one additional step to add PvP teams—make them joinable from the main menu, so you can be placed on a server with other PvP teams. Otherwise you’d just end up with the same situation you have now, farting around in Adventure mode for hours hoping to find someone who wants to PvP. 
---
I agree that it’s necessary, but it needs the extra step to actually work.
---
Oh are there two places? I thought it was only the dead beaver room?
---
No rare drops. Some just do that, others will attack you.
---
Todays inside the vault by #Bethesda
---
This is kind of true.  My main character is 359.  I started a new character when Wastelanders came out to replay the story.  I refuse to give him gear from my main, as I wanted to get the new 'experience'.  Got him to level 52 and he runs around with an instigating sickle.  I've switched characters to buy a decent Tesla and a few plans I've found.  I do try not to buy obvious 'gifts' to low level players, but the the level 1 Anti Armor Explosive 1 Perception Hunting Rifle was just too damn tempting at 80 caps.
---
Same. The drops I get are as laughable as they are insulting... some of these would be almost ideal
---
But that would be non-canon.
---
Well, that's disappointing, it seems pretty rare, first time I see one in more than 150 hours of gameplay.
---
I mean, a Spirit Bomb is technically a nuke so...
---
Don't sweat it, I'm over level 500 (non-bloodied) and I died 7-8 times going solo. My friend I was playing with went to eat and missed out, lol. Got him down...that was the first encounter.
---
Actually just got it behind the front desk. Thanx again.
---
No worries :)
---
"With it fully upgraded"
---
I'd just hang out and see if it comes back.  It will control the other creatures in the area and can be quite entertaining.  Look for purple enemies, then he's in the area.
---
Can’t find your gt are you on rn?
---
I did it last night. Team leader completed the quest. I got nothing. You have to be the leader.
---
Having trouble accessing 1st scrapbox, specifically putting stuff in. My acct is current, just a note. Also atomic shop not loading
---
It's pretty rare to see them. They're a bit like the mothman. The lower level one is more for show and will vanish. The rewards are a bit of a let down but if you come across another and kill it that will contribute towards 2 challenges and taking it's photo for a 3rd.
---
I mean, like the other poster said they should just bring back Survival, but public PvP teams would be a nice way to deal with the boredom while waiting for ~~Godot~~ this game to get an actual endgame that isn't a brainless grind.
---
The double and triple xp is not fun anymore.
---
Used to love it, now my old xp running grounds are full of little bitch wastelanders.
---
Give me an unlimited scrip weekend so I can make some legendary gear and unload all the junk I get.
---
Ah, the memories...
---
Thx
---
Guy in background ::sighs wistfully::  “she blows every guy but me, woe is me.”
---
Dude I know exactly how you feel lol. I am stuck using the Enclave officers outfit just to feel like an Enclave member. I even have Daguerre(Space Ally) in the same outfit.
---
They had that. It was survival mode. It was removed from the game on October 1st 2019. Everyone always says “oh it’s because there was no interest” But I lived in those servers. They were always packed.
---
With a team too small it's almost impossibile to create a really bug project because of limited time and knowledge, but with a too big team it's really difficult to be coordinate and we can clearly see it in this game. Good idea but it is so fragmented. I hope they will change philosofy for the next game
---
All you can do is join private until its fixed man.
---
I knew I wasn't hearing things. Thanks OP. I did hear that familiar tune in a tv ad.
---
Yeah that's what patch 19 was. It's about the only thing that patch got right lol.
---
Yeah. I actually have a "free stuff" vendor, specifically for low levels. I mean, I'm only level 24. I'm low too. But I'm near the Wayward. I'm talking free stuff for legit new new players. Players walking down from the vault and stuff.
---
I'll usually plop some purified water in there, and some random clothing and armor. If I find any level 5s and such basically.
---
Problem is, I keep seeing higher levels walk buy and nab the water and meds. Sometimes even taking the low level armor just to sell or something. 
---
Like, you high levels don't even need this stuff. Chill.
---
He seems very secret service-y to me
---
Paid 4k for my second one, found the first one.
---
I haven't heard of this boss.
---
They have if it's a public team, not sure about private.
---
Skinguard only available to Fallout 1st subscribers lol.
---
Sex is a currency
---
It could have been undercover agent before the war I couldn't make it back to the vault
---
Thank you! My partner isn't concerned about the drops and mostly wants to take his time doing quests, I just want to get it over with! Our agreement for me starting over would be for him to help me with the vault raid. My Xbox build was super squishy, and my perk cards were all over the place.
---
We’ve listened to your feedback and gone ahead and added a giant thumbs up hand to the atomic shop as a skin for grog also axe
---
yeah we really need perk loadouts! 😁
---
I love that hes got no explanation or back-story. It feels surreal how he just appears with a seemingly infinite supply of gold right after you finish the main quest. Very Dark Souls like.
---
You'd be surprised. I came across  a camp with emphasis on electric chairs and the N word written on all of them... The Fallout 76 community is nice overall, but every game has their rotten apples.
---
It was mysteriously removed from the list. Not a word from anyone about why.
---
Combine similar legendary items to increase the gears primary effect. Destroys the second weapon to enhance the first weapon. It should be incredibly expensive to do, like 10k caps and 100 scrip and/or 100 gold for the first enhance and double for the second, maybe up to 3 tiers. This could potentially also stabilize the economy and make certain weapons or armor even more desirable and rarer.
---
Can you tell us what was causing the problem and how you solved it?
---
or is it... confidential?
---
*looks at map and doesn’t see anyone* NoBoDy PlAyEd SuRvIvAl
---
This is extremely wholesome content.
---
Is that for the Motherlode quest? If so you need to manually extract it from a robobrain body by pressing triangle(PS4) or whatever button your platform uses
---
It would make great bethesda customer hold music
---
awwww (I find all of this just devastatingly cute)
---
Well, no ones markers showed up on the map unless they were ranked soooo that’s probably why you didn’t see anyone.
---
Im on PC so my experience might be different then your. But I think Bethesda may be be doing a slow test. I can’t get into my private server either but i just got done spending about an hour playing on public servers. ran through and did the daily quests and turned in scrip on three separate characters. Got right into a public server relatively fast but private is being stupid.  My guess is private servers may be temporarily offline that way if something goes wrong again Bethesda can have a better chance at fixing it fast. whatever happen today must have been really bad.possibly even a ddos attack. I mean  Every Bethesda game had issues on every system today. I mean Even their website went crazy for a while.
---
I was just talking to my buddy about how cool map in harpers ferry or Watoga would be.
---
Yes. We actually announced that.
---
He tweeted that, with bucks changed to caps, when Wastelanders launched.
---
I thought vault raids got taken out of the game
---
customizing appearances
---
My 1st time in v76 i spent ages looking at everything thing and jus taking my time soaking it all up lol
---
What the other guy said it's a harvest not a regular drop. And there's always 2-3 robobrains at the loading dock of robco. On pc it press space to harvest same as the scorch east DNA for the daily etc...
---
GTA makes there money from people beings dicks and such, sells the combat vehicles faster. 
---
RDO is just a dead game and the people who play have pretty much run out of content.
---
Even if its not the best at least Bethesda kinda tries and add decent content and not push with in game currency pushes.
---
Ha! (I laugh, to keep from crying)
---
Yeah, it takes a few bashes to kill a fly, and I don't remember it causing the effect but not 100% sure
---
Dude yea like the fighting ring thing that they put in Watoga, but it's an instanced area.
---
Yeah that was the joke
---
I'm convinced that guy is a damn synth.
---
You mean Smiley?
---
Woooosh lol. Sorry. I’ve been having a day.
---
My guess is creating thier characters. On top of that you may get some people wanting to explore the place as much as they can. But creating a character likely takes up a lot of time.
---
Not quite that easy, it’s a bitch to place again if you can get it placed at all
---
I do stuff like this too. I like to see how much someone’s greed will betray them. It actually is quite sad that some people are willing to blindly follow me across the map on the promise of a reward. Says a lot about society.
---
I got like 2000 acid during the event, I know that much. Thank God for the honey haus.
---
RDO can still be a little fun if you have friends
---
I'm pretty lucky, my mates are all heavy weapons fanatics. When one of them got the Fixer plans they gave it to me because they have no use for it.
---
Now I just have to farm the Bear arms. But no one ever turns up for that event.
---
Didn’t bethesda themselves literally say this in one of the ITVs?
---
Sorry, I meant the wastelander vault raid.
---
They could use the Raider fighting arena in the shanty town near Pleasant Valley Cabins
---
It's classified as heavy armor in the PTS.
---
Check my reply to buddy below. I agree the time slowdown part wouldn't be viable in this fallout. But it could work in a different way working around AP regen and the likes.
---
Sorry, this post is about the wastelander raid! My bad, I forgot about the pre wastelander vault raids. I never attempted those!
---
No ones gonna finish that left over booze and party food if we don't! That said, between character creation, getting a little too into the pip-boy game, exploring what there is to explore, ~~glitching into rooms you shouldn't be inside,~~ listening to the Overseers tape, and going to make a coffee, I can see people taking around that.
---
It's classified as heavy armor in the PTS, even if that is not reflected in the workbench menu.
---
I remember looking for hidden loot for like, a fucking minute. Did not expect to be able to scavenge so little in there.
---
As long as you're having fun while blundering your sorry ass around the wasteland it doesn't matter buddy. Go make some stupid moments
---
one last fap
---
Ah man, you are going to kick yourself... Not fun. What others have said, there is a dedicated button to 'extract' it from any robobrain you kill.
---
Not too different from my strat. I pop a MK-3 steath boy as soon as I recall and wait on top of the building until I can take pylons, run and grab all 3 using about 4 quantums to survive, and spray it with my JE laser from stealth.
---
Quite sad to see someone justify being a dick in-game by blaming people for accepting gifts lol.
---
I also get people to follow me... and then I give them gifts, because I’m not a dick nor am I lonely enough to waste all that time to maybe get some scrap.
---
I’ve only had it happen to me once. A friend and I, lower level at the time, absolutely obliterated by some high level guy. He was taking over all the workshops on the server. He was a streamer and I guess that was his thing to do... No one else has ever bothered.
---
He's mostly gameplay; but he might even/also be the 'official' middleman between the Secret Service agents and the wasteland, making a start of that whole building a new economy things, taking caps and their value on in return for bullion and thus taking one out of circulation and adding the gold.
---
At night I wonder what Vault Samuel comes from
---
Yes he was setting you up.
---
I got kind of lucky. Same deal with the Officers uniform,but the Atom Shop recently had a discount going for an eyepatch set that included one with the Enclave Insignia on it, and I had Atoms sitting there. Added a few deep scars on my guys face around the eye on that side,equipped the patch with its gold E and stars circle, and he looks like he got his General rank by coming out of the Whitespring Bunker and taking on a hoard of Scorched Muties barehanded. And winning. Lol.
---
To the best of our knowledge the only survivors were the agents we meet, but there is no reason he can't be a trusted/vetted middleman.
---
I saw a youtuber that did exactly this, he moved his base right in front of vault 76 and took advantage of every new player that emerged.
---
He's still in the vault crating his character.
---
* Repair faulty Challenges for atoms.
---
It's life time problem I have too,no fix.you just have to wait
---
Its ugly
---
or just turn your camp into a fighting ring!

I've seen people reference lolicon, killing Jews and Nazism in their usernames so this seems particularly bullshit.
---
love this idea Maybe we could even have modifiers for it as well. Like players can choose to have a standard  PvP or allow the option add spawning creatures to the fight. Everything from low level radrats to max level buffed versions of assaultrons could spawn in during the fight and attack all players. 
---
Could also include the option for betting. Each player adds a certain number of caps to a machine with the winner taking all. Maybe even have players be award 10 scrip at the end of the battle. With a max 50 scrip earned per day just for participating in the arena.
---
Mount Blair is another one. People seem to love stealing that one from other players
---
Checked my current char and he had a B 50LD 1A pump, an I33 pump, a J33 1P pump, and a Q 40B 1A pump all just sitting in stash. Testing is going ridiculously well so far, one shotting scorchbeasts :P Thanks for the tip!
---
I’m impressed.
---
Depends, one that said THIS IS A TRAP (and I am too)\* was obviously a platforming puzzle that had decent prices on its plans and crap legendarys. you also had to fast travel to get out (or hope the punch was not also a trap)
---
\*Trap (Slang) for a male who can pass as Female.
---
If we could grow cranberries in our camp I'd probably marry Beckett. The selection of plants we can grow is a little disappointing
---
I think they've been a bit preoccupied with the whole server crash thing.
---
Better yet, fill your punch bowl with a mix of different alcoholic beverages so that it becomes a lottery
---
If you’re on PC, add me. I have 3 keycards that I wanna use :)
---
Am I the only girl/guy losing fury and psycho, I never use or sell I had over 10 of each went to offer a high level for helping me I have zero .I know this isn't the correct chat sorry,
---
well I can say I’m definitely not going strong with my Wifi, I’m talking about the og Xbox One, the one more in par with the PS4 the op (i assume) is talking about, hence my garbage frame rate.
---
As someone whos played there games since Morrowind I'm surprised at how good it is currently....but then they probably realized they had to actually try and fix there crap themselves for once.
---
Probably because the people in the full team trying to gank the one guy will all obviously have it toggled on. So when the individual player who thinks he's only engaging with one person slaps back, and is all of a sudden killed by four people three of whom he didn't even know were present, your solution doesn't solve the problem
---
Thats cool i love it nice one🤘
---
Hey I'm on ps4 and I have an extra one of those I could hook you up with.
---
lol liking this PvP
---
You know what thought did? He thought he had a fart but he shit his pants.
---
I'd like to have a box where people could leave me notes about my camp.
---
I wanna read all the Orange Man Bad Salt.
---
Thanks I want to get more videos of it filled with audience members and fighters to make silly montages with lol
---
It's a long way away. You haven't heard of it. And I don't remember where it is...
---
When I was in there, I was exploring everything I could. I spent a ridiculous amount of time messing with my face. An extra amount of time taking a nice photo. Then I wandered around pressing A on everything I could. Seeing if I could pick anything up, activating things, looking at the decorations, kicking the soccer ball. I enjoy getting immersed in a Fallout game at the start, so I took my sweet time.
---
Not into pvp but I wouldn’t mind watching a good showdown 🙃
---
Smiley is Regs guys. Its Regs with a star spangled outfit and a hat. He took off his glasses and hid his bald spot lol
---
Is it maybe project beanstalk?
---
Project Beanstalk!
---
Nah, he's just that guy that is in every town that tries so hard to be cool that he ends up creeping everyone out and lies about practically everything to impress people.
---
Only one works, it does not stack. So use a different mod for the other arm.
---
It does add, but with all damage increasing effects still has diminishing returns. I would recommend one arm brawling and one arm weighted.
---
It makes me nervous to think it could be from the Vault 8
---
Yeah project beanstalk left of flatwoods
---
Just found one thank you so much tho.
---
Yeah I'm from a vault, doubt you've ever herd of one of those before. Nice pipboy, did you know that thing monitors your vitals and functions as a Geiger counter, psssh probably not, you can thank me later *finger guns*
---
Yeah it was packed. With people I see all the time. Was kinda surreal to see only about a dozen people playing the mode in my region
---
YEA. That was it! Is it still here? Or is it gone cuz of wastelanders
---
My camp is a dojo on my alt, fight camps unite!
---
I think it's still there. I don't really pay attention though haha
---
Wait... has any one checked him for... a vault boy puppets and/or giant ants in his room?maybe the number 77 means something?...
---
Are you watching their dot and timing them?
---
Yeah, I have to get a nicer bed. I have one, but it doesn't have blankets or sheets on it. It's a fancy bed frame, but then it's just a plain mattress on it. Wanna find one with actual bedding.
---
When they teleport off like that I always say "you go tell your alien brothers, that Ronnie Cordova says they’re gay!"
---
What's so special about it ? It's up on my server. It's still there
---
I'm not op, but I do check my map a lot. I've built my camp near the Wayward and have a free vendor for new players to get some water and stuff. So I regularly look to see if new players are spawning in or walking down. 
---
I've seen dots sitting in the vault for ages.
---
I bought all the beds that arent on the atomic shop so I know which one u talking about. I would recomend buying the "vault-tech bed" it has some nice blue sheets and white pillows.
---
I feel like he hasn't responded to anyone because he may have put his fist through a monitor xD
---
I was able to play most of the afternoon despite nobody else being able to join me, so whenever the servers didn't go down completely but people were locked out if they weren't in before whatever happened.
---
This is on my main. Got all the benches and things I need. I use it to settle disputes in the wastes lol
---
The toggle is for choosing if when you engage whether it’s one person or the whole team that turns hostile.
---
I don't think I've seen that one yet. Or at least, if I did, I didnt notice. I'll have to keep an eye out. Thanks.
---
HELLO RONNIE
---
At Sunny's all gold bullion and treasury notes are all the same thing. They are all ravioli.
---
Fr? I havent seen it in over a month lol
---
They sell it at the Whitesprings 
---
Server-hop until u find it
---
That’s good stuff. Bad internet is the worst.
---
I usually do events for legendaries and roam around fissure prime. Events are great for farming scrips, the hordes leaders are always legendary and show up on your compass, super easy and ammo efficient but usually under lvl 50 so it's good for scrips. You can usually find legendary scorchbeasts at fissure prime and there's a lead deposit if you want to set up camp. I used to have 3 legendary scorchbeasts waiting for me when I logged in, but the repair bills forced me to move.
---
So is what you're saying that a player should have a toggle to choose whether or not to engage just the person they're engaging or their entire team?
---
You can buy it from a vendor rarely for about 8k. If you buy it from another player expect to pay about 5-7k.
---
I've never seen a player vendor with one. 
---
How would someone even get one outside of spending a ridiculous amount of caps on it?
---
It takes you off the map, but people can still interact with and purchase from your vendors without power.
---
This is not true at all it should all be optional except for adding new shit and restarting the servers
---
Imagine it being crafted as a legendary, two-shot one will be a good starting point for legit dupe builds :D
---
Thanks for the link, I didn’t find it!
---
*It just works*
---
I take back what I said. Just got a 3* nocturnal broadsider. Everyone wants that.
---
So wholesome. My wife and I both play 76
---
Im Nuka Dad and she’s Nuka Momma we own the wasteland together often
---
I make mini nukes &amp; nuka cola quantum grenades.
---
These rewards are garbage.id rather have caps notes and stimpacks.
---
I think it come with one. Makes it deal bleed or poison or something like that
---
There are none. The bone hammer (bone club?) has a mod slot that adds bleeding damage, but I've never had the guts to try to remove it.
---
It's funny, when I visit other's CAMPs I feel like I'm being nosy when I start straying from the vending machines, but when others visit mine I encourage them to come in and look around. I know most players with well designed CAMPs probably want to show them off as much as I do, but I just can't help feeling like a trespasser.
---
Absolutely! Got a BE one from a friend recently, it's a goddamn stealth sniper rifle! Loving it :D
---
Ah yes, salty ganker tears
---
3*buttplug

Project Beanstalk,.and yes it's still in the game. I see it quite often

Me and my brother used to play squads with him on fortnite, I was pretty shocked to hear his voice when wastelanders came out, sorta did a double take and asked him next time we played, he said it was really cool working with bethesda.
---
And here's your receipt for your fallout 1st membership this month
---
I think I only missed clearing it a hand full of times.
---
I've had the best luck with roamers or just getting lucky. Harpers ferry is always nice, plus you can hit the Burrows too. West Tek is reliable for max level spawns. There are plenty of instanced areas that are max level too now like some of the Watoga buildings, and the Charleston Capital building. You can farm mobs at events for trash legends or just hit the Whitesprings. If you have caps to blow, you could buy out vendors that just sell scrip items.
---
It only spawns in the vendor inventory. So unless someone is selling it at a loss, you'll probably have to shell out about 8k.
---
Same here. All the comments are assuming everyone already knows what’s going on, but I also have no context
---
You’re BREATHTAKING ...!!!
---
Just think of a really douchey number and thats probly it.
---
On the contrary, it's actually an Instigating Fat Man.
---
It's a lot better than what we have now
---
I’ve got my eye on you
---
The person who runs the event can bring 30 stimpaks, activate all conduits, and then chill.  Being conduit wastes health and stimpaks so most people enjoy providing fire power. Otherwise maybe no one would show up.
---
What was your camp defense setup?
---
I like a lot of what has already been posted, but 2 stick out for me, bows and plasma shotguns.
---
Bows kind of suck, but there's just something satisfying about having to have your character both nock an arrow and knowing that your shot is going to be worse if you don't let the pull animation complete(less damage/range/accuracy).
---
Plasma shotguns are in a WEIRD place, using Rifleman(or Gunslinger) perks but being shotguns and (to the best of my knowledge) not benefitting from any shotgun perks. But I feel like a bona fide badass when I use one! That sound and all those numbers popping up? So satisfying.
---
Vats doesn't work in pvp anymore so maybe try to pvp first instead of just assuming everyone is using aimbot or God tier gear.
---
FYI, I run a shit gear and one star junkies handmade and can drop anyone except for nuka cola spammers
---
Hmm you play on private server often? Maybe someone has to actually move over there and trigger the event? Just assuming
---
Depends on the plan
---
AHHH HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA.
---
I completely understand why this happened. I just did this quest last night and was wondering why after 5 eye bots, the item wasn't dropping. 
---
Then i noticed the little bit of extra text when inspecting their inventory saying to press triangle.
---
I don't entirely disagree, but I personally like the slight tension that comes with the concept of being able to be attacked at any moment. Knowing that you have to be careful to not get caught off guard. It's a bit of extra thrill.
---
Not sure why anyone just walks around with junk they care about on them
---
Dang man you have a real arsenal there.  Enjoy!
---
Loyalty. Does it mean anything to anyone in this god damn place?
---
Get a group, at least one person needs 1st. Nuke whitespring. Make the route n end at the station. Someone leaves server, then rejoins. Will respawn the ghouls. Seen as few as 2, and as many as 8 in one run. Good luck
---
When i was a lower level i tried to activate the Dolly sods campground workshop, i was building defenses and some high level with an explosive handmade contested it and destroyed me. He wouldn't stop and I tried to just just get my junk and leave but he was just trying to mess with me.
---
Hey show some respect to the walking cane!
---
I'm not even all that high of level on my main, but I made an ALT because I wanted to try different play styles and to avoid high levels giving me stuff on an old character that I barely intend to play I decided to only play him on private servers until he is high enough level that people will be less inclined to give him free stuff
---
It appears you're promoting a discord server or community. This is not allowed and your post has been removed.

&gt; Please come back to my camp, I'll have two Super Stimpaks and a Phantom Device waiting for you. :)

Allowing others to express their gratuity is a solid social skill, even in this case where their gesture is obviously not as valuable as your gift.   Just take their portion of the "trade" and say thanks.

Honestly I think it's more because of the lack of communication, its like we're all foreigners who don't understand each other so we just emote, smile politely then bye bye. 
---
Once they add text chat watch it turn into cancer fast..
---
Yeah i missed that discount lol. Id have gotten that pack xD
---
Legendary death law gauntlet is so fun
---
Swallow them
---
False. It does stack with dimishing returns.
---
Oh no! I have done this, too. Smh. I was so pissed.
---
So basically what I'm hearing is that you cannot build a decent PvP build.
---
As the previous poster I agree with your second point. However some of the primary prefixes aren't totally useless but are very situational.
---
For example I have a 3* Ghoul slayers handmade which I can 1 shot everything at Whitesprings with. I imagine the same would be true of Zealots or Troubleshooters. Great in certain situations against certain enemies but not ideal if you want 1 weapon that does it all.
---
The problem is the meta is so OP compared to the other primary prefixes that nobody is interested in anything besides bloodied, junkies or maybe furious for big boss fights.
---
You proved it's not real pvp. Whoever has the most of whatever meta item, like nuka cola, is the winner. No skill compared to NW.
---
Not like anyone who gets in your way will be alive for long with that damage
---
Don't you think this is strange haha
---
What's wrong with it?
---
I think if you don't do the one, the other one will show up the next day. But I am not positive of that. I will try and report back.
---
That is what I use, nice.
---
Congrats to OP! What an achievement. Most of the times I've played even with multiple others they still fuck it up somehow.
---
Is the white wolf fedora considered a valuable/rare item by the way? I've got one from completing the event ages ago. Not sure if it's a sought after/rare collectable or junk.
---
I ended up buying the Mothman twin bed from the atom shop just because it looks clean and has blankets and pillows, it really does make my room look so much better
---
Not fixed in the UK on PC
---
 I tried to login an hour ago &amp; was constantly getting told I had connectivity issues. Finally got in then 5 mins ago the game crashed &amp; it took another five minutes of logging out &amp; in repeatedly for it to stop telling me I had connectivity issues to get back in

Rock solid fibre optic connection, high speed broadband

As someone with a whole floor as an arcade in their camp (Mr Fuzzy Rides and Personal Teminals), I have to say this would be great.
---
Rare for this to happen.  Runs decent most of the time if you have good internet speed.
---
How long does it usually take for them to fix it?
---
The fog crawler was doing pretty well until I mowed them all down.
---
The bugs are part of the charm in these game engines. Most of them are benign.
---
I came to my camp and some guy was screaming into his mic about how I scammed him. I look to see my punji boards destroyed when my vendors and benches are outside. He got everything in his inventory back and he even took the stuff in my extractor and purifiers.
---
you really think the story in 76 is better? fo4 was no masterpiece but i found myself thinking "that's it?" when i finished the 76 story
---
Few months ago it was up to one day but recently it's around 1-2 hour.its rare problem so not many players know it. don't spam the joining it doesn't work,you have to wait
---
It probably takes longer on initial login. Join adventure mode, then switch to your private world.
---
Nuka grenades. Made so many it took me days to use them all. Most fun I've had during outdoor events in ages.
---
they dont need to buy it from him if he used the creation kit, possibly even if he didn't
---
Same, recent snag for me
---
It's odd that you look at this as a PA gives you so little carry weight and not why does unyielding give you so much carry weight.
---
If you compare Max bonuses for normal VS Max bonuses with PA, they're comparable.
---
I haven't done Project Beanstalk in a while, but I have seen it pop up on the map recently.  You mentioned "Camp Adams", but it actually happens at Silva Homestead, a little north of Camp Adams.  The bot and the computer terminal are always in the small shed right behind Silva Homestead, with the big silo on it.  You can visit the bot, but he probably won't be responsive if the event is not active.  Play withe computer terminal, to see if that triggers the event.  I don't "think" it does, but I have only done Project Beanstalk once, and it was a few months ago, so I don't remember much about it, except killing a bunch of mole rats to protect the bot, while he is spraying the crops.  If nothing else, pop by there for a quick reminder of exactly where it is, so you can be sure you are checking the right spot on the map for it, so you don't miss it if it does pop up.
---
BONUS - Silva Homestead is part of my regular Bobble Head/Magazine route.  A Bobble Head will sometimes spawn on the desk with the computer terminal, in that shed with the bot.  A Bobble Head will sometimes spawn in Silva Homestead, on the second floor.  A magazine will sometimes spawn in that metal building with the Power Armor station in it.
---
For most things I'd say the FE but for the queen Final Word. Try both with damage numbers on.
---
Omg my father (May he Rest In Peace) used to say that to me when I was little. 
---
Lmao 😂
---
Am I the only one who came here thinking the post title was about something else?
---
Dont forget your repeating dailies...
---
Wow, some Freudian description there. Sound a wee bit jelly?
---
Okay 2 things:
---
- if you compare max bonusses they are comparable -&gt; this still isnt right because in my opinion PA should have more carry weight than normal armor...
---
- i disagree with that unyielding is broken because yes they give huge special bonuses but the trade of is that you have to be at low health and die easily... Sounds fair to me
---
Why even is there a cap limit its not like its a competitive multiplayer game where it would need a limit for balance reasons just seems like a way to screw over players also does anybody know what the actual limit is I only recently started playing Fallout 76 again after wastelanders came out so
---
No. The attacking animal does the damage to the camp. You do not directly do the damage. Works on the same concept as a trap base. The camp does the damage to a visitor.
---
I just found one today, in a raider vendort bot, costed like 8k. It was on my private server, the bot near the overseer's house.
---
Looking at it, I feel unyielding and other legendary gear and traits was an unintended mistake by Beth. Even more so that some guy with no health left has a higher carry capacity than a dedicated piece of earth moving machinery. Excavator should be at the pinnacle. Period. It sacrifices combat effectiveness for hydraulic lifting power and protection from rockfall. It should be a behemoth physically. 
---
ESO gets fucking slammed by 'balancing' by ZOS. I dare say the entire gear line of F76 could use some serious work.
---
Power Armor, Laser Weaponry... The staples of Fallout have utterly lost their relevance and identity to shit like Unyielding armor and 'marsupial'.
---
I enjoy private server mostly because I can keep some semblance of the Fallout world going, even if it means I pale in comparison with respect to damage and attributes.
---
They need to bring in the Handmade Shotgun from FO4.
---
I don't charge at all, it costs some steel and glass if I remember correctly, so no point to charge for such stuff.
---
(Optional:) Destroy the 800kg stash limiter
---
PLEASE
---
thank you. I watched the video. I find it strange that it doesn't affect the shown damage numbers but still change the damage output.
---
Saw both of these on other people's location videos. Cool places though.
---
230+ no nukes
---
I want it back but a petition just seems lame and entitled.
---
Well shoot I've been looking and was only aware of like four caves.  I also found one way up north west but Bethesda level designers put too much crap in it to build.
---
You obviously weren't around since the early days. 
---
Were you around then, you would have known already about how many people complained about being forced into carrying PA because of the superior carry weight vs normal armour. That normalised around the introduction of the backpack. Tipping the scales too far back the other way is just going to create an arms race of carry weight.
---
The only singular thing that massively tips the scales is unyielding. Remove that and the best of normal vs the best of PA barely tips it out over PA because of +1 str legendary effects. Add in weight reduction which is pretty rare, and we're talking something that's pretty much a unicorn, only affecting those that heavily trade in duped items.
---
As for unyielding, it's grossly broken and OP, and this is coming from someone that uses a bloody build on the regular.
---
A full set of bloodied gives you +15 to each special other end END. Thats:
---
* \+45 carry weight &amp; sizeable strength bonus for melee
---
* greatly improves to combat to hit chances
---
* Gives you massive bonuses for buying and selling
---
* Sizeable XP boost (I think in the ballpark of +30%ish)
---
* Solid increase to AP as well as making you harder to find in stealth, even without any stealth perks
---
* Very fast crits refill and high durability for found loot
---
All at the cost of 80% of your health with which a large number of perks and the bloodied effect synergise with. 
---
Oh let's not forget the +5 Str/+25 carry weight bonus for 1 rank of Radicool.
---
Yeah, unyielding isn't broken at all...
---
If I recall correctly, it is the "Y" button on Xbox.  On any platform, when you are inspecting the dead robobrain, and you have that loot window showing, look at the tiny text at the bottom of that window.  It will tell you which button to use, in order to harvest the interpolator.  There are several special item looting quests in the game, where you have to manually extract the item like that.  It never shows up as regular dropped loot.

&gt; I never said anything about the morality of stealing or scamming irl. I was pointing out that just because someone scams in a video game doesnt mean they scam irl 
---
That's fair and true, but I think the understanding of the other people in this comment chain were talking about the morality/decency of it, not just the link between the two.
---
And I still think there is a difference between stealing from someone in a game within the games mechanics (where it'd might not be nice but is part of the game), and scamming people outside of a game (which is not a part of the game).
---
&gt; And if I were to log in tonight and my entire account had been wiped, it would definitely suck hard. I would be furious, but ultimately all I would lose is saved data. 
---
You may see it this way, but other people may legitimately take it more seriously. Take a kid collecting baseball cards or something. If someones collection got nicked or destroyed a more casual collector might be annoyed, but say 'ah well, it's just bits of card'. However, someone who takes it more seriously and who has invested more time/money/love into it might be devastated.
---
&gt; If I were to go home and find my house burned down, that would be a much more devastating loss. 
---
The difference in your example isn't because one is a game and the other is irl, it's because one is a luxury item, and the other is pretty essential. Also, the amount of money spend in a game by even the biggest of spenders is unlikely to come that close to that of a house and all it's contents. A better example would be to compare an in game hobby to a real world hobby (that someone would likely feel equally passionate about and have invested a similar amount of time and money).
---
&gt; And some stuff I would likely never be able to replace. 
---
Presumably this is talking about sentimental value. Why should this be fundamentally more the case for real life? You may be less sentimental about your in game character and items, but they may have just as much sentimental value to someone else, and be just as irreplaceable.
---
&gt; You cant compare the value of video game data to the value of irl items. 
---
Why not? The people selling the data do. You can with other things you invest time into? Why is it any different just because it's less physical? 
---
For what it's worth, I'm not arguing this from my point of view - personally I don't invest that much money into game data, and the time I spend on a game is it's own reward. However, my point of view isn't the only valid one, and I can respect that what is a casual hobby for one person, another might take much more seriously.
---
People are often very quick to say that x doesn't affect them in some way, so it's no big deal, but we all have different values and experiences, and I think it's important to remind ourselves that our isn't necessarily the only/correct point of view.
---
Playing the guitar at the same time? What a talent. Where can I find such a wasteland service?
---
I saw it about 3 hours ago, so ya it's still in game
---
Lots of people here like to defend their bloodied/unyielding build.
---
Yeah like the mysterious savior perk card, Todd shows up and sweeps the 3* legendary off the floor so you cant loot it and says “It just works!”
---
They should introduce a backpack for PAs, that occupies the same mod slot as jetpack/protocol. That way we can choose between survivability and carrying stuff.
---
Did the same. I heard the sound, saw the colors, and was like oh man, here we go... a good laugh till I had to spend 20 minutes getting back to where I had been before.
---
i think im a bit out of the loop, what is this about and what happened?
---
Eureka!  I found a video that had a trick with the portable toilet...  that results with no extra pieces, place toilet place rocket stash, store toilet and stash stays  
---

---
Whatever floats your boat. Other players are resources to me.
---
Nice find! That looks cool and thanks for sharing!
---
I am around since the early days but no offense taken lol.
---
I still disagree with you that unyielding is really broken. In my opinion power armor should have an initial extra carry weight bonus for all suits so that it will be comparable or greater then with unyielding armor.
---
Kinda wanted to just comment something so I’ll get notifications for the post
---
Why is that wrong?
---
I like the Idea of a backpack for power armor but no one will give up emergency protocols for that i guess
---
fallout 1st of all, dont be sharing dodgy shit and let bethesda employees know ur doing this shit, but gg too late now
---
If you accept their offer you need to censor your gamer tag everywhere and probably delete some of your old videos in order of not getting banned.
---
I still use the Unstoppable Monster legendary weapon on my main. When I'm going lead or rubber farming I often use it to save myself some bullets. 
---
I would honestly much rather have preferred to keep Adventure Mode instead of getting Nuclear Winter. NW is fine and all, but I just always had more fun on the PVP servers instead of trying to coordinate a team of muted whilst being shot at through a wall by a hacker.
---
You are delirious. Go to the infirmary.
---
Yeah go for it. This game is a lot more fun when I can interact with other players. All of my friends that I play with I met in game.
---
Take the money mate, play a burner account just in case, censoring tags was good advice.
---
If you check our follow bgs Twitter you can get real time updates rather than secondhand answer from reddtards
---
Bethesda’s taking a pretty hard stance on RMT. I wouldn’t go for it unless you want to censor out your IGN.
---
Look. I got this dream, it eats me up inside. I've been traveling with this crowd for a while, and well... I need to get away. You feel me? They're well, don't get me wrong. I still wanna stop by and hang out with them, see the sights, but I need quiet, calm... I need to hear the world. I got a radio, I know some people. Got a buddy here in Crater, a hunter pal out in Foundation, know some people all over. I know people, man.
---
The Deep made my Berry Mentats farming route soooo much easier now. It was always an absolute headache trying to find the starlight creeper berries in the forest since they blend in with the foliage so easily.
---
I can help you this evening (CET) , like craft some decent armor and a weapon. Also helping with a few quests ezc
---
I have the same problem! Thank god im not the only one.on xbox
---
Whenever I find free stuff vendors I clear them out and dump all of the stuff in a river
---
Sure that would be great when
---
You can already add me, my Gamertag is Vanathru
---
One solution is to replace your current allie workshop item with the allie workshop item from a different allie
---
I'm online at arround 5pm-7pm CET
---
Fake. Players can no longer destroy CAMPS without being in combat.
---
Only when barbed.
---
Sure when
---
The problem with PVP in FO76 is that is is not what they said it would be. the purpose of my suggestion was to create a dedicated game type that would be repayable and directly benefit the account over the individual character being used at the time.
---
As there would be no fast travel you would have to make your way to an event. to combat this i would add an exit option after completing an Silo run (nuke launched), this would allow you to pick a static spawn point to exit to. one could be the bunker by fissure prime. just a door in the back. to further RP this the exit room in the silo could be turned in to a subway with multiple exit points so as not to break immersion.
---
Nuke fall events would be announced server wide, but as there is no omnipotent map, you would not know directly where it is unless you were within the targeted area. 
---
The workshops would act as trigger points for PVP as there would be more people on the server than workshops available. they would essentially become the players home. you could open up your workshop for general use if you wanted to incentive people not to destroy/take over it.
---
Seems legit.
---
agreed cheater s suck
---
this is not survival or NW. there was no incentive to play these game modes beyond cosmetics for NW
---
One bottle per minute
---
There are lots of small bugs like this in the game. The damage numbers is just one of them :)
---
I think this is poor design on the Bethesda's part tbh.
---
Hard to say if they will ever redesign it.
---
Finish the quest.... but seriously, did you check the turrets? Like where one is broken and starts shooting the others, then they shoot back, and you've got to replace the turrets. It's a known bug.
---
Bethasada isn't that creative anymore
---
Fallout1 premium mode removes stash limits completely ....
---
Its probably from the duplication glitch since the duplication glitch required you to put the item you wanted to duplicate in your stash so he had to have duplicated radaways and stims and just left them there
---
To me they should add a carry weight bonus to PA frames or the ability to put a mod on the frame (backpack alike)
---
I don’t run a specific build as such, just SS armour and I still get like 390 carry weight. The backpack makes such a big difference, with the high capacity mod.
---
If fallout 76 was made properly with lots of time, dedication and passion it would actually be an amazing game or atleast very close....
---
Instead we got a dumpster fire that may keep you warm, but might actually be killing you in the long run. This is my opinion.
---
agreed survival did.. 
---
this mode would take the game and remove the level grind (to a point) and allow the player to progress the account as a whole. the rewards for playing this mode are primarily tied to the supply boxes that can be moved between characters on the account. 
---
the game play would integrate both PVP &amp; PVE in to a mode where you are truly alone.. you may play with friends but with no direct team function you would need to be extra vigilant and aware of your surroundings to succeed.
---
the purpose of this game mode would lock a character to it. you you would not be jumping to adventure to complete these actions. (please see another response of mine within this thread).
---
If you do, make sure it's a good one. I bought what I thought was a decent mic and people yell at me for the crackle. I just gave up.
---
excuse me, what?
---
700+ hours since beta
---
Only time it's happened was the Ammo workshop and less then a few months after release. I'm capable of taking workshops now but there isnt really a point.
---
I might be the minority here but I get a dopamine rush every time i see/hear that sweet cap and the “cha-Ching” regardless of who’s buyin my shit
---
Survival servers were full until they started nerfing everything patch after patch  so everyone left and survival servers were replaced by Fallout 1st.
---
Only junk limits bud
---
Yes, thought the same.
---
Not to mention that if often comes of Duping....
---
thought only for scrap...?
---
There also was a glitch where you could somehow go over 800 Lbs into your chest and after that it's unlimited.
---
- Replace FO76 with remastered FNV
---
Careful, a friend did that during Christmas for presents.... He got banned for having to many
---
Based on your post, they're winning.
---
Certainly makes trading easier, being able to talk to other players. A lot of folks don’t use them unless they are in a party/team but some do. It’s worth it for the times other players do, met some great people this way.
---
Yes, I have that problem today. Just change server and now work fine.
---
I'll tell you what. We were at a camp and 3 guys happened to be on in group , my gf bought out all their stimpacks and we could hear them talking about it, then offering to sell her more. It was wholesome because it was at the same price and they just wanted to help. I ran into the bedroom trying to pair every headset I had to be able to jump over and thank them, yet nothing worked. I was so mad and sad. I know with voice chat you have to anticipate the good with the bad. I'm so damn shy. But I really want to participate in that next level of communication. It's pretty stupid but even still I get nervous like "do they even want to hear what I have to say?". I suppose that's why I asked.
---
rust is ok yes, but its not FO.. 
---
My vision of a PVP mode would be Day-Z light. the mode should feel expansive and daunting at the same time, where you are extra vigilant of sound and movement. rewards should feel earned and progression should be fluid 
---
personally i hate the current implementation of PVP within FO76. i find battle-royal games to be laborious and shallow. the market is saturated with these and MOBA type games. its over gimmicky and for some reason AAA publishers seem to think that every game they make has to have this as a pvp mode. (COD Cough)
---
Jungfrau means virgin. 
---
Its a Bit complicated as "a young woman" translates to "eine junge frau" (but little/young girls are mostly called  "mädchen") but Men can also be referred to as a Jungfrau in the Sense that He is a virgin.
---
I did find the dense plan for my chest on a vendor, I still crippled myself pretty quickly tho... Will experiment more. 🤷🏻‍♂️
---
Yup
---
There is a few posts every week here like the op and no one ever points out that it's not possible because the op left out details
---
I've seen tons of players running around with 5 cap bounties and I'm beginning to think low level players dont realise lockpicking someone's shit gives them a wanted level.

I found her wandering through a camp near Charleston Station getting attacked by Scorched. I had no idea she was rare. She asked me to put out her guitar at my Camp, which I will do if my Daguerre missions disappear again.
---
nice
---
He already posted a video with the ad before making this post lol
---
Doubt they'll find out, his channel is pretty small
---
I was intrigued by this so I thought I would try it. I nuked West Tek, and I've looked all around the southeast of the West Tek building, and cannot find the ore deposit? Is it pretty close to the building, and is it the kind of ore deposit the is coming out of the side of a rock  or is it one of those craters in the ground?
---
Servers are up
---
I find the general Fallout community to be worse than the 76 community specifically
---
If you simply get over the idea that you HAVE to turn in the quest immediately, you could viably set up a loop around the map that you follow which hits up and completes dailies as you encounter them.  You may be taking a quest for Ward one day, completing it the next, and getting back around to turning it in on the third day.  Of course, this would be how all of your quests get completed so with enough time for it to set in as a routine, you’ll be able to turn in just as many quests per day as you would fast traveling around.
---
I find the Bethesda community overall to be entitled, whiney, and toxic.
---
Funnily enough, I got the "Death from Above" nuke warning while I was still faffing about in the vault.
---
You know what sounds like the best bet for your hopeful thinking? Play another game
---
That's certainly big fear of mine. With so many companies extending into multiple areas of different industries it makes it hard of who you can trust. I've made that mistake numerous times. Those persuasive temptresses! To be honest I keep trying to get my Afterglow's to work on it. Even though they only have an Aux for Xbox. Daddy didn't raise no quitter lol...
---
You forgot "repair the economy so people don't have to become basement goblins to earn enough caps*
---
claim rights
---
Bit of both. I use the wheel most of the time, but then the keys when Im pure shitting myself in combat :D
---
https://akarnokd.github.io/rng-76/weapons.html
---
You can calculate it there.
---
They could just make a legendary perk that increases carry weight &amp; DR for each matching PA parts equipped, 5-10-15-20 per parts, +120 total when maxed out.
---
These facts are so terrifying that people don't want to face them that's true.
---
Good thing we have you to red pill everyone.
---
Life will never be the same for me.
---
I heard they didnt bother since most of their player base was on console before the steam release... even then its such a simple feature, crazy how it hasnt been added after all this time
---
I think to accomplish this yer gonna need Goku asking the universe for energy again
---
I had the luck of being gifted a radiation shower, the treasure hunter outfit, and a level 50 rad stag hunting knife that I still use to this day. This community is nothing short of impeccable when it comes to generosity and selflessness
---
Arent recall cards to activate the event a thousands + caps or something, though?
---
There is a text chat mod on Nexus. I do not dare install it yet... I do not know how many player use it.
---
yet another BASIC feature that this game doesn't have. Wastelanders was a big improvement and I actually enjoyed the game quite a lot. But so many QOL features are missing that it just builds up  and I eventually got fed up of the game.  I have 300+ TN  right now, so all I do is login buy bullion, scrip some of the hundreds  and then spend some currency just so I don't reach cap.
---
That would most likely end up in a complete shout fest drowning out anything you want to read like all other mmo,'s with that feature..
---
Ah ok, that makes sense. Thanks. Was proper baffling me.
---
Loads mate, go for it. I use it and wouldn't play without it.
---
It depends on your characters hair color. Blonde usually look most fitting because the original also had blonde. You have to remember, if they are going in for stealth, they need to look like the people they are trying to cover. But I really disagree with your second part for very obvious reasons
---
It makes a new ini. Would it let me in NW with it?
---
Hmm but that would take lots of time to get there as max rank Will be lvl 300 😅
---
I would prefer power armor frame perk or mod for carry weight.
---
And maybe a legendary "Hoarder" perk card which makes everything weigh 50/60% less on max rank9
---
What the hell are you talking about lol
---
No it won't. I keep a copy of the original so I can swap between when I fancy some PVP.
---
The devs when they realized that they would actually have to fix things in the game instead of relying on community made patches:  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umDr0mPuyQc](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umDr0mPuyQc)
---
I mean you are right in the sense people will nitpick anything.  Evey game that has maintenance has a few people who complain no end.  
---
But in this case it's a little different.  Anyways I honestly respect your reply.  Takes a bigger person to admit sometimes we could be wrong.  Very rare to see these days.
---
Thank you. So you only remove/swap (since it keeps the old one in the folder with the new one) the new ini, then readd when you finished killing others?
---
I keep two folders, one with all my mods and ini files in it, and one with the original ini. When finished with NW, close game, swap files back round and re-launch. Sorted.
---
1. No one force you to buy anything from player vendors - if you don't like the offer you don't have to buy anything. 
---
2. If you think you waste your time and caps to fast travel to such vendors check point 1.
---
You should seriously consider doing what I do man.
---
Use discord trading or head over to r/Market76
---
It's way easier.
---
Thank you. Will concider this :)
---
Kind of disappointed
---
it's not the fast traveling that bothers me (alltho now that you mention it: loading times and caps are wasted time too)
---
it's the fuckign time i wste BROWSING THROUGH YOUR USELESS SHIT THAT NO ONE WILL EVER BUY
---
oh and care to explain how i can see a exact list of a players inventory WITHOUT traveling there and going through his shit? ah, thought so, not possible.
---
I need to hear more about the pastor.
---
Can you PLEASE stop telling people how to play THEIR game? Cashed up players with a stunning sense of entitlement that others should cater to their immediate desires and theirs alone honestly shit me to tears. just because you cant find something that interests you doesnt mean what people are selling isnt of interest to someone else.
---
RNG is a bitch mate. There are literally tens if not hundreds of thousands of possible combinations for stuff.
---
Not if you have chat channels, like local, map wide, friends, and party.  Filtering like this would make chat useful like in other mmo's with this feature.   And being able to block chat coming from obnoxious players is important too.
---
I sell bloodied, unyielding and mutation serums.
---
COme right up.
---
Perfect demonstration on why the majority of the community doesn't want to deal with sweaty PvP tryhard, the toxicity in f76 PvP is ridiculous. Weaponised autism at its finest
---
No I won't. I sell stimpaks by the boat load so why would I stop just because it offends you. I also sell ulttacite PA plans for 33 caps and they sell, obviously to people who don't know any better, so I won't stop selling them either. 
---
One man's trash is another man's treasure my friend.
---
You gave me an idea. Praise be to Mothman.
---
Yeah. Server hop and buy until you have 80 or so, then grind out Encryptid for several hours. One day and you'll have weeks worth of notes 🤙
---
Well... the expensive / premium items are reserved for the market subreddit, so do not hope you get a godrolled item for 2 caps... or rare plans for 10...
---
as long as you don't have ashtray and ultracite plans on your vending machines -\_-
---
Item that you called shit might be attractive for someone else. The whole idea of player vendors is to sell what you want - it's easy as that - if someone put shit (in your opinion) and it sells, means it's that shit as you think. And I repeat again - it's free market - you can sell what you want, even "you've been insulted" notes for 25k, no one can force you to buy something if you don't like it.
---
Bethesda did, though I'd agree it falls pretty short of actually being one.
---
i am not asking to get god roll shit for 1c.
---
i am asking to not see fucking ashtrays and ultracite BS on every fucking machine
---
Quite welcome.
---
Maybe in time these things will be added.
---
just hope that annoying respawn glitch is fixed first
---
thats why every single machine has 10 ashtray plans ... because they are sold out as they are so popular...
---
When my brother an I first started playing (level &lt;10), we did the quest where you have to drink nukashine.
---
We were both overencumbered and unwilling to drop our loot, but hadn't unlocked much of the map or found many stations/red rockets, so we were stuck where it put us. It put me in the forest, but it put my brother in cranberry bog.
---
I managed to find a stashbox so I could fast travel to him to help him out as he was really struggling. Together, taking on/avoiding enemies way higher level than us, we got him to a red rocket so that he could fast travel again.
---
The whole thing was pretty stressful, but I'm glad it happened then - if we'd had done that mission when we had more of a clue about what we were doing it wouldn't have been nearly as interesting!
---
"Every time you switch a perk loadout, there's 20% chance to explode your character."
---
The same reason any other big company with their game would neglect to add it: Mostly laziness mixed with a bogus excuse explaining either why it's not coming, or why it's taking so long.  
---
If I'm not mistaken, Red Dead Online has this same feature omitted despite it appearing in GTA Online.  It's a very 'consolized' thing to omit a feature like text chat when making a PC port of a game with multiplayer, perhaps so they don't have to give special attention/features to PC compared to their other versions.
---
I'll use your advice to try and make a comparison that better gets my point across. The baseball card collector, those cards are real, tangible, and valuable. Not valuable just sentiment wise but some baseball cards have high values of cash. If the collector were to lose their collection, they havent just lost their hobby, they've lost wealth. And chances are that some of those particular cards are irreplaceable, they aren't made anymore. 
---
Now compare that to a video game, FO76 in this case, and there is next to nothing that could not be replaced in the game if your account were to be wiped. The major difference in the two scenarios is the irl one can actually sustain serious irreplaceable losses, while the video game one can't. 
---
The point is that when it comes to x in real life or video games, it's not the same kind of loss when its destroyed or stolen in either. If you're baseball card collection was stolen, you would contact the police. If your FO76 account was stolen, you would contact customer support. The latter being much easier and much more likely to be replaced or restored.
---
Are you looking at your badge status in your pip boy? If so that doesn’t work all the time. You have to go to a vending machine to check it out correctly
---
Eeeeeeh really not worth the caps at all. Just do regular events and save your caps.
---
If you are referring to the section on your pipboy for collections not showing them then dont panic. I have the same thing on PS4 and its a visual glitch. Go to one of the scout vending machines at Camp Adams and it should still show how many you have available.
---
I guess that depends on how many caps you have 😁
---
Maybe they're taking a dump before heading out.
---
that's all the fun from server jumps for player's vendors - 99/100 vendors I visit sell items not interesting for me, but then you'll find one which will surprise you with BE90 Gatling Plasma for 20k inside (yes, I bought this gun for such price around 2 months ago). It won't be fun, when 99/100 vendors would offer such steals ;)
---
I mean what are you even looking for? Decent 3\* weapons &amp; armor I assume? Those are harder to find in player vendors because they're harder to find in general &amp; most people would probably just rather keep them. Plus the really good ones sell fast regardless.
---
I'm pretty sure you won't be able to do it anyway. This move was possible in the early game but was later patched bacuse "fuck building".
---
With every build there are things you can do and things you can't, you found one you can't. I can down them with a minigun quire quick, without any perks equipped.
---
IIRC you can rejoin your private if you're quick enough and it saves for 15 minutes
---
Another cool thing could be that power frames themselves could be modded, one that reduces all weight by 50%, one that completely eliminates rad damage, one that boosts defenses, one that greatly increases AP, etc etc
---
I can totally see that too. A ton of the issues plaguing fo76 would have been fixed in a few days by modders usually without the modders breaking 4 other things to fix one.
---
Im almost always at 30k cap, but I would still rather use them for gold or trading or etc.
---
maybe i am not trying to find anything, i am just sick of scrolling through the same fucking lvl 1 ashrtay plans and ultracite plans on EVERY DAMN MACHINE
---
Sometimes it's easier depending on location. Ones in the Mire can be a pain because of all the tree cover. If you're lucky you sometimes get ones just sitting in one spot. My favorite are those right around the Blackwater mine. The miners will help fight the escorts, and the drone stays low. In any event, always fast travel to a spot that is well beyond its current location but in its flight path, then run back towards it if you have to. Always aim for a thruster first.
---
Alright but ever since I got a two shot grenade launcher it has been my only real defense against scorchbeasts so now I love 40mm nades
---
I use Final Word to shoot those down (the 50cal machine gun you get from doing Becketts quest). It makes mincemeat of them. I know its neither a bow nor stealthy but its a gun you may have on hand already thats effective
---
Their camp, their vendor, their choice.
---
Maybe you should try to be less entitled.
---
Still don't have text chat, which even the very first online games had. There is NO excuse whatsoever why hey lack it, even games back when 28.8 modems were a thing had text chat, pretty much every console game with online play has it too, other than fo76. Would do wonders for communication. Sadly would let trolls annoy people more but thats what ignore is for.
---
Thanks! Have yet to rejoin on it, but I typically have used crashes as a stretch break to get up and get something to drink or the like - good to know I have a chance at keeping my progress. Still would like to be able to save between log-outs :)
---
how the fuck am i ENTITLED for not wanting to scroll through the same fucking useless shit OVER AND OVER AND OVER AND OVER AND OVER AND OVER AND OVER AND OVER AND OVER AND OVER AND OVER AND OVER
---
?
---
Bethesda absolutely loathe to do anything just for PC. They've demonstrated as much a number of times.
---
I heard from an ex Bethesda employee that internally they go with the mindset that console is king. Everything is geared towards that. 
---
Unless PC massively outstrips BOTH console platforms, I don't see this changing any time soon sadly, even though ESO has text chat for all platforms.
---
uh la la la someone's feeling funny tonight
---
Replace the rent with taxes, and this legit sounds like an amazing idea. Of course, a little stall with some decorating options would be nice too. but that's just me.
---
The stone arch one is super popular because of the lead and acid deposits that can both be mined.
---
That mod still needs a lot of work. There aren't enough people that use to to make it worthwhile. I've yet to find someone on the same server as me to chat to. It's all global or trade chat, just like a scuffed discord.
---
The mod author is working on it but right now unless you're really into player trading, it's probably not worth it.
---
Yes this shit almost ruins my day
---
Everybody and their grandma is selling 100's of mounted plans to.
---
How about players stop making these kinds of posts? Seriously. Every single time some high level player gets their panties in a bunch over something so trivial, they have to come make a big ranty post about it. 
---
Can this become a banned subject? No more, a Player did something that is totally their choice that I don't like, and now I'm going to waste people's time making another post to go with all the other posts about this!
---
I'd find out more about this person and report them. They deserve to get burnt.
---
That's awesome man!!
---
yeah that too.
---
Oh no! how many times it happened to me, welcome to the club,

Yep, i have the same problem (PC), also... the Atomic Shop is not loading. I bet this has something to do with the outage yesterday evening/night.
---
&gt;Can this become a banned subject? No more, a Player did something that is totally their choice that I don't like, and now I'm going to waste people's time making another post to go with all the other posts about this!
---
they waste my time and traveling caps and i waste your time with this post. seems like a fair trade to me.
---
you guys telling me no one forces me to browse through there shit (yeah, imma gonna know telepatically if there's something in there that i could use) so i am gonna tell you that no one forced you to open and read this post.
---
There there bud. Have some chicken tendies and a nap. You'll feel much better afterwards.
---
Sleep is for the weak.  Yeah being well rested gives you a 5% XP buff.  In the time it takes me to sleep I could be killing scorch beasts.
---
I heard they've postponed the event - it's too buggy right now (check CaptainNoob's video regarding the subject).
---
sorry, can't find the chicken inbetween ALL THIS FUCKING ULTRACITE PLANS
---
It’s very common for that event, but if you don’t do it a lot, you won’t see it very often.  The same can be said for any item that you can only get from content that people tend to have trouble with.  You get an Arktos lab coat almost every time you finish Project Paradise, but I almost never see them in player vending machines.
---
The stimpak diffuser and bear arm plans are much more uncommon, like the fixer plan from Encryptid, and sell for a good amount, but since my two buddies and I have started doing this event every time it pops up over the past couple weeks, I’ve gotten one diffuser plan and two bear arm plans in a dozen or so completions with all three animals surviving.  I only have a relatively small sample size, but I guess that rarity is relative to the amount of times a player or group participates and their ability to consistently reach the top level reward table.
---
Not enough players to start event
---
It's likely a visual bug. Go to a possum vending machine and see how much you actually have.
---
😬Without friends to help you with transferring items...and if you have Fallout 1st (using a private world) it still can be done with risks...also I believe there are mule services offered on this subreddit That help with that?😬
---
This happened to me to, in pc you must press space, it's not in the robot "stash".
---
imagine thinking youre good at pvp when you cant handle a single guy alone
---
Keep having these nightmares... Just floating in space... Forever..
---
Just get yourself a hunting rifle and snipe each of the 4 thrusters on it, that will stop it dead in its tracks, then you can work it down with whatever you want for however long you want.
---
Yeah I've found the same problem just now, I just reset the game came back and it seems to work fine now
---
Just stop shopping through vending machines and start browsing trade specific discord servers. Maybe try some breathing exercises also, it’s just a game, relax.
---
What exactly can a stealth bloodied commando not do? Before you say be tanky, there's youtube videos of this very build soloing Encryptid, tanking the 3 pylons and destroying the ISS.
---
The dried lake bed by New Gad would be a great central spot for an arena. I dont like pvp but i like watching. 
---
Instead of the stupid hunter hunted thing that no one uses, just drop a map location for a new Raider fighting ring. Let people even pay to join. Put in say 100 caps each.. and have it be winner take all. Theres so much they could do to keep all player bases happy.
---
Farming nuke zones is the only way.
---
They tend to drop about 2/2.5 less frequently than the masses I find. You also get masses in multiple quantities where as the fluids only drop in singles.
---
this is me being relaxed.
---
He's a stealth archer, so pretty irrelevant really...
---
i am not asking for god roll deals for 1c
---
i am asking to not see the same fucking useless shit on every godamn vendor
---
Agreed. The people who're saying 'go for it' are nothing but scumbags ruining the game even more.
---
Bethesda needs to be notified immediately because whoever is in charge of that shady site needs to be prosecuted to the fullest extent. That individual is breaking the ToS immensely.
---
Then I very much would not want to be around when you’re riled up.
---
Ha ha I'll make a new camp solely out of gramophones just for you ;)
---
like someone told you already - play the game you like and let others play how they like, you have no power to told people what to do and don't, you're just one frustrated player in the ocean of other players who don't give a f...k about your opinion...
---
You might be right that it's easier to restore game data (although depending on the circumstance, you may or may not be successful in getting support to help).
---
I guess I still disagree that something being easier to recover makes it intrinsically less valuable.
---
My money in an online bank account has the same value as the equivalent in cash, despite the fact that the money stolen from my account is probably easier to recover.
---
In any case, I think we can probably just agree to disagree on this. Thanks for the interesting discussion though. It's quite refreshing to have a conversation from two different viewpoints that doesn't devolve into insults.
---
you cared enough to comment
---
maybe no one cares about YOUR opinion either, hum?
---
Nuke whitesprings and farm the bloated glowing ones. I have had the best result with those dropping high rad fluids.
---
" would that it twer so simple.."
---
Well maybe they could add easy items like this as the free weekly items. We've been getting a lot of repeats recently.
---
upvotes of my posts and flood of downvotes for your's points quite opposite...
---
No
---
Yea same! There's been a few items like that I wana steal n take back to my camp ha ha
---
oh wow you got a whopping 5 upvotes somewhere in this post? xDDDD
---
there there, you can feel like you realized your life's work. god approves.
---
Do it, but equip all fighters with predetermined, non legendary loadouts upon entering, that get unequipped afterwards. Even the playing field and make fights entertaining.
---
I‘m not going to spend my time fast traveling there only to watch some legacy explosive plasma fucker melt some poor fool in .5 seconds.
---
There is a new dupe that requires crashing the server, maybe that's the problem.
---
I'm new here, what exactly is a trap camp and how does it work?
---
dude, I don't discuss with you for upvotes, I just want you realize most people think your rant is just stupid...
---
I hit 40 tonight and got a lvl 41 card.
---
It's doing it even on a Fallout 1st server. I'm on my own. Unless it's crashing all servers, even if they're not on it.. that ain't it in my case.
---
Theres gotta be a way to do it...
---
They do seem to drop less these days, early on I would come back from SBQ or Whitespring runs with a tonne of em...
---
Fucking dupers. Let the banning begin!
---
Damn yeah then it's probably just server problems, I havent been on since before they went down there will most likely still he a few things that need ironed out..Or it's just bad wifi lol who knows with bugthesda these days
---
North of red rocket mega on top of the hill is a gold deposit. And anout 30 seconds to the east between RR and the freak house is an oil seep. Death claw spawns on the north sode of the cliff from the Gold deposit, so get your black titanium and gears too
---
If we could have check all the vendors on the server from our console (CAMP) before traveling, I would be so happy.
---
There are a lot of bad items stored in vending machines like lvl35 broken lever action etc. It is a high rng what you find.
---
On my 10 checks I usually find 1 usable item or plan. After a while you develop a sense where you just ignore a lot of stuff. Still travelling, loading screens and caps are being used.
---
(smooth whisper from the wind: Action house)
---
I would love to have JES-2R from Freddy's!
---
you consider the 5 butthurt people that didnt like my comment "most people"? you know that thausands play the game and read this /r right?
---
the fact they dont care to comment or even vote doesnt mean they didnt read it.
---
and if i manage to get just ONE person to realise how shit their vendor setup is and change it, then this post is a fucking success
---
Thx!!
---
Definatly secret service,after meeting us in vault 79,they must have clicked on that caps are the new currency,so by sending an agent out into the wilderness,and selling bullion at over inflated prices,and knowing full well that eventually that gold will find its way back to 79,its win/win all the way down the line for the secret service,value of gold crashes,so be it,they have a ton of caps,and vice versa.
---
I'm a crouching ninja with a bow and arrow. Meta SHATTERED
---
I have no problem with walking. You really don't need meta in this game.
---
😎 only slightly, I've spotted a few of your type too
---
Use a different weapon. I'm a bow user and I always have a fixer on hand for this stuff.
---
I think with that attitude more people who already have good items in their vendors will decide to put shit instead to make fun of you :)
---
I know I was being sarcastic, I totally agree with you and I dislike meta builds in MMOs which is why I never make it too far in them but also why I enjoy them a lot
---
sure, coz they know for a fact i will be on their server
---
/smh that's gonna be the most idiotic thing i've heard in a while.
---
thx for the chuckle
---
I honestly had to google it to answer the question.  I've lived around lots of closeted(and a few openly) racist people and I've never heard it before this thread.
---
I'm guessing it's extremely regional.  There are some truly bizarre ones out there, and hopefully they'll start dying off soon.
---
Lol, no worries. Obviously the builds are decent otherwise they wouldn't have thier place but it's always good to experiment. Afterall, it's through experiment that someone discovers the new meta and plasters it all over YouTube for others to discover
---
Nope, working fine here
---
I can't see any adds in his channel .....
---
oops...
---
Free market, bro.
---
Demon asylum does it in every video he posts and his videos are about doing glitches like duping, reputation glitches, caps and other stuff. Posts his gamer tag an everything. Has his own discord server to. If you wanna you can but just know you'll be passively hurting the game like he is.
---
Depends on the type of person you are. If you have any integrityat all, then no. If you want to be known as a bottom feeder who promotes cheating and duping, just for a little cash, then yes.
---
free "waste of time and travel caps" shit, bro.
---
Rocking Enforcer with Explosive Shotgun. Ghouls are worthless.
---
I'll try an intercept near Blackwater, thank you.
---
because of the humble bragging "you should beg for my b2525 handmade"
---
I think I've got that stashed actually, ha. I'll give it a shot.
---
I keep thinking that because I have no perk investment in the weapon type it'll be useless...
---
Oh for sure, hence the disclaimer about not being angry, lol
---
It's just a bigger roadblock than I was expecting. Getting some great advice out of it though.
---
Goddammit, I didn't think of disabling specific parts. Too focused on headshots.
---
B.E.T.A.?
---
there ya go...telling our secret again lol
---
Whoosh!
---
No couple months after f76 came out
---
Literally your own fault - plenty of trade groups if your looking for specific shit, bro.
---
Nah. Its an anti armor weapon with a faster fire rate so its pretty effective on its own against the cargobots. I have no perks at all really that help with heavy guns and it takes them down pretty quickly. You might eat some ammo for it though which is the downside
---
been there, done that.
---
i am not asking to find god tier shit for 1c at a vending machine.
---
i am asking NOT have to scroll through the SAME fucking useless shit OVER AND OVER AND OVER AND OVER AND OVER AND OVER AND OVER AND OVER AND OVER AND OVER AND OVER AND OVER AND OVER AND OVER AND OVER AND OVER AND OVER AND OVER AND OVER AND OVER AND OVER AND OVER AND OVER
---
Maybe even play radio that'd be cool.... A searchlight too? Not a bad idea OP
---
You could maybe make it where you need a certain amount of water production for each crop or just for 'special' crops.
---
That's what funny, they're pathetic that they have a *big* PvP community, what 10 people? This game ain't built for PvP and I just found it funny tbh 
---
If you're one of those PvPers, well done, you're the laughing stock of this community lol
---
I get this sometimes too with NPC vendors and the legendary machine. Just look away and look back and try again. Do that a few times and it usually works for me.
---
How did you know that player was part of that group? is everyone pvping on this game part of it?
---
270 no nukes, not really interested, my loss I guess.
---
You just know there's at least one lvl400 in the peacenik club ...
---
There are a few gold ore deposits in welch IIRC, along with loads of other ore nodes.
---
I'm on PC so my only cheaty mod is glowing plants, it make it a pleasure to hunt plants, at night time the whole forest takes on a magical quality.
---
Yeah. I just moved my camp over the oil seep. So now i have to walk to meet my death claw friend. Found the oil slightly more useful than the gold, but the view is not as awesome as the cliff above RR.
---
There was a camo skin for it, NW rewards along with the ghillie suit. It’s gone now though.
---
I still feel like I suck and I’m 135 lvl
---
This.
---
Yeah I'd imagine there is.
---
how dare i tell people exactly where it is, so they can find it once Bethesda's network came back up.
---
anyway since the forums are now working again after at least a 6 hour downtime, here is your precious link
---
https://bethesda.net/community/topic/413615/what-s-new-in-the-pts-updated-june-16?language%5B%5D=en
---
Fancy shotgun with broken effect is my meta :)
---
I'm reasonably sure it's only available in the Arktos Pharma biome labs yeah. I don't think I've ever seen them anywhere else.
---
Yeah they are available down there anytime. You dont have to wait for the event to pop.
---
Yeah I hear you but in all honesty I think a lot of the good stuff is exclusively traded within those groups because most people aren't actually looking for caps, and then the redundancy of shit items is a reflection of the poor drops we ALL hate to get... over and over and over
---
Thank you. I was hoping that was the case.
---
That does sound like an improvement. They really need to balance and improve PVP in the game, so many complain all the time, it would encourage player engagement and less criticism of the game. I don't like PVP but so many do it seems.
---
Maybe the same artist/creator has that sound as a paid stock somewhere? xD
---
Yeah I know they are only available in the labs. Just wasnt sure if I could access those labs outside of the event. And apparently i can. Thanks though.
---
You can harvest 40 if using Green Thumb at any time, no PP necessary.
---
Sorry, pays to read the title fully! Yeah you can.
---
I'm always showing offline, but yeah I went to bed.
---
Good to know! I have green thumb equipped all the time so I dont forget it.
---
[Ok](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BW1aX0IbZOE)
---
Ash rose at Lewisburg,  Silva and Billings Homesteads.
---
That makes sense, thanks.
---
They shan't ban as I don't think they know who is doing it yet.
---
Thanks for the tip

Here you go
---
The issue with E weapons is the damage rubberbanding issues, if it ends up doing that, which 90% of the ones I have owned do, then it cancels a lot of damage out .
---
Bunker Buster missil launcher and a few demolition perks.. it has targetting computer 😎
---
Me too I still have my level 25 fixer a random player gave to me. I don't use it anymore and tempted to name it payitforward and stick it in my vendor for zero caps 😁
---
I could buy the idea that you could cobble together a home made gun out of plumbing parts, that could safely shoot common pistol caliber ammunition, but I highly doubt commercial iron pipe could handle the internal pressures that a .50bmg would produce.  Even if it didn’t explode in your hands, I’d guess the barrel would start to bulge and become very unsafe very quickly.  I’d guess that even .308 would be too powerful for the mild steel or wrought iron the homemade barrel is made of.
---
Of course, the whole idea of creating a rifle out of plumbing that was capable of any accuracy at all is squarely in the realm of video games.  You’d have to have access to some machining tools and know what you’re doing to ream out a barrel.  I guess that a .5 or .75id inch pipe could have an inner .38 or .45 sleeve inserted.
---
We’re shooting at gigantic glowing crabs and huge green men, so we may as well have high powered rifles made from materials you can get at any hardware store. I’m guessing it was a design choice, along with other receiver and magazine changes from Fo4 to F76.  The devs seemed to have opted for “tiers” of weapons, where a pipe rifle is inferior to a combat rifle, which is inferior to a handmade, which is inferior to a fixer.  There’s quirky outliers that occupy their own little niche, like the SMG or Gatling Gun, but for most weapon styles there’s a hierarchy of good&gt;better&gt;best.
---
Beckley Mine Workshop, 3 oil nodes.
---
With fallout 4 most of the buildings are built in the block system ie walls floors roofs, just like 76 camps. With fallout 4 they locket it so u can’t modify and remove these walls and floors in locations that aren’t in a settlement but the reason as to why it doesn’t lag the shit out of everything is that it’s all ‘locked’ if they gave this locking feature in camp building we would be able to create giant, more elaborate structures without the cost of frame rate. Also more freedom placing shit would be good
---
Everything in this response shows why it should be banned. 
---
You think everyone else, and this forum are only exist to serve you. 
---
We aren't upset that we read this post. We don't like how MANY of these post there are. We can generally know if a post is worth reading from the title and preview. I mean, I don't have to read the whole post from a whiny headline like yours. 
---
All we have to is scroll through and see multiple posts complaining about the same thing. Just like the hundred posts that started yesterday about, WTH is going on with the servers. 
---
So again, it's not that we read the post. It's that there's always several of these going on at the same time.
---
Because you are to selfish to read and see that.
---
👍thank you kind fellow
---
I can't play without marsupial, I never PVP but it is so good to be able to jump like a Roo.
---
What works for me is to back up until the trade option disappears then advance forward until it just appears and it should open fine then
---
Similar to BW mine, if you catch one over Watoga, the bots will eventually take it down for you.
---
See, you feel like being snarky, but in the end you do good. Not everyone knows there _is_ a PTS forum.  Context matters, people!
---
Are you not ENTERTAINED!?!
---
It's a fun time be had!
---
All I did at the start was fight players and explore. The PvP was great and no one just went invisible and waited for there level 400 friend
---
I'm camped in Charleston at the pond near the Train Station vendor. I usually have a vendor selling level 10-15 armour and weapons for new players at low prices, and there's always level 100+ players that empty the vendor of everything.
---
Berserker's Heavy weapons build....no meta here! 😉
---
Yeah that's true I didnt say anything about banning though that was the other dude... But im gonna guess that if a youtube video gets made about this new dupe, yeah they'll have to do something if it is causing server crashes lol
---
Beckley Workshop, 3 oil nodes one gold I think.
---
So how does it work? I thought once shots were exchanged you get into PvP with that person, not everyone.
---
How long does PvP mode last?
---
oops 👍
---
All good 👌
---
&gt;Not everyone knows there is a PTS forum. 
---
&gt;its on the bethesda PTS forum, iirc the update notes from the 9th.
---
i mean, it was quite literally the first sentence of that comment....
---
... or where to look for it 😜
---
ultracite jet pack and all it's ultracite shit friends... 🤣 ikr!
---
Yeah I am, I really appreciate it. I'm pretty well the same, I'm figuring out stuff as I go along. My first build was a disaster, so I'm currently rebuilding him into a bloodied. But yeah, never got to do the vault raid, never dropped my own nuke, never completed project paradise, never done encrypted, ect.
---
I'm like level 80, she is around level 20, trying to get her up there. Lol
---
But heck, of you want to game some time, yeah I'll send you a GT. =D
---
Wow. That is great that it worked out that way.
---
Yeah I can see that. It is a blessing/curse in disguise.
---
When we bought a house/moved intogether, my partner and me already had a console and a TV each.. and now we have a gaming room each, which makes it easier to justify being in party chat with him haha.
---
And yeah, I googled it.
---
Top results for “Fallout 76 PTS forum” are reddit, devtrackers.gg, forums.mmorpg.com, gamesradar, screenrant, pcgamer, destructoid, nexusmods, ... no link to Bethesda.
---
So, despite the snark, I’m really happy and grateful you posted the link!  Thank you 🙏
---
Just be nice to ra-ra so you can get the slug buster plasma rifle
---
Let people play how they want :) If I waste my time fast travelling to people's camps that's on me, not on them. I understand the annoyance of browsing through the same plans and 1\* weapons all over again, but I take responsibility for my own actions instead of blaming others :)
---
Bought on release and left after 3 month of struggling. Constant disconnects (support blamed me or my network company) ruined it, besides all the other flaws everyone had to experience in the beginning.
---
I returned 2 weeks ago. Surprisingly, i never had a disconnect, which beth software support blamed on me for weeks back then. And only 1 freeze and no crash at all.
---
Imo game is fun now. But i won't forget about the problems and (in my case) ignorant support, hence i will not buy for example "elder scrolls 6 online" or what ever bethesda plans to release next. I will wait for month, see the horrible reviews, pick it up for like 10€ at gamestop when everybody hates it (remember no mans sky which was sold for like 5€, or fo76 gifted when you bought a controller?) and start playing after a year or maybe even 2.
---
Fo76 is a good example of how important independent mod authors are for bethesda games. Imo, their games rely on the community to make them enjoyable in a reasonable time after release.
---
And the common Fasnacht masks now.
---
Don't lie to Johnny! And be nice to Ra-rah.
---
I seriously doubt commercial black plumbing pipe is made of strong enough steel to handle the chamber pressures that even .308 will create, assuming a solidly constructed bolt assembly.  Best case scenario, I’d guess it would start to bulge or crack after a few shots.  50bmg would probably explode the chamber immediately.  Theoretically I might actually try .38special or some kind of low powered 410 birdshot, but I wouldn’t be very confident.
---
Well good thing I was nice to her
---
You won a personnal challenge. It's better than any other reward.
---
Is there anything in the vault I should pay attention to?
---
&gt;shit me to tears
---
A laxative will work wonders at such times 💩
---
What happens if you lie to johnny
---
Not really, ither than be prepared to fight a number of robots and turrets
---
My atom shop works, has ever since the servers came up.
---
This gaming community really is the best. I remember all the players who helped me in this way, when I was a noob. It really makes the new experience so much better.
---
I'm level 395 and I just learned something. Thank you.
---
idiotic answers like that are one of the reasons that keep us motivated. have you ever thought that we might love the fallout franchise and we DO play different games BUT we want this game to be fixed? pvp was advertised and every other lootshooter has pvp too. how long have you been around my guy because at the start of the game with no damage cap pvp was so present you can't even imagine. your argument is 100% invalid
---
I see then well thanks for the info much appreciated
---
He didn't even want to play with human NPCs, now I understand why, "It just works."
---
I get the sentiment. To be honest, I mostly just spend my caps right back into NPC vendors now for bulk lead/steel because I'm far too lazy to go farm up lead and steel to craft up ECM rounds since it's actually amazingly hard to find people selling ECM rounds. Though to be fair, it is also heavy ammo.
---
Don't forget 15 40mm grenades

This happened to me today.  I am a full stealth build/rifleman.  I get one hit and he is on me &amp; I am dead.  I even used a Stealth Bobble Head and he still finds me after the first hit.  I have killed other Legendary Kings in the Mire while farming cranberries.  They do not seem to see through my stealth like the one in the cave does.
---
That would be great... It would solve a lot of discontentment with the PvP community. We have events that rewards you tokens and coins for prizes, so why can't we have a similar system for PvP? Each kill in the arena rewards you with 1 coin, then you can claim your tokens for rewards, anything is better than nothing. I think the Watoga Arena would fit right into this concept. It's new content going to waste... just for one quest :(
---
Mine worked not that long ago, I purchased a floor set.
---
I want to see Todd stream this game. I want to watch him build. I want to watch him play Encryptid with randoms.
---
HeHe, well hello there! Aye, the Turbo-Ferts are pretty pretty pretty good!
---
I know you're not justifying it, just trying to explain it, but I guess it's coming across that way to some.
---
Personally I think there doesn't have to be some deep  psychological issue behind it. We're talking bullies, not serial killers, but just because it's not the worst it could be, that doesn't mean is not antisocial and unpleasant behaviour.
---
And for what it's worth, I don't think that being bored justifies such behaviour. If someone is bored of running the same event 1400 times, then they can go do something else. There are tons of alternative things to do - ranging from other games to play to stuff in real life. Trying to detriment other peoples gaming enjoyment shouldn't be the go-to alternative option.
---
Idk how to mark spoilers on mobile...
---
But he dies.
---
I totally agree with you, I'd add a second suggestion. To add a token/coin reward system as we have in several events right now like **Lode Baring** and **Monster Mash.**
---
dont forget to mention that in the raw material inert stage they weigh nothing!
---
10/10 idea. Would not do pvp myself but I would totally watch. It would be really cool to wager caps on a fight and make bets as to who would win. It would really change up the economy.
---
It started working now it's stopped again
---
F in the chat.
---
I tried doing that when I used to play WOW. I burnt out quickly.
---
My heavy gunner is using a junkie/+10% aim/weightless plasma caster.  It definitely scratches that pew-pew itch, hits pretty hard and has some serious range.  I didn’t think it would replace a Gatling gun for shooting at long distances, but I really enjoy it now.
---
The only things I’d change would be to add a little bass to the sound it makes and give it a better sight.  It can be hard to see your target with that retro/future diagonal glowing reticle and overlapping hipfire crosshairs, especially when it’s very dark or very bright.
---
I just got three of these last night, thanks for the heads up.
---
It's a pain in the arse to farm. It makes me realise why America keeps liberating places for it. Places like Blackwater Mine and Camp Venture has quite a bit. So does Camden Park and Abbie's Bunker. I'd only recommend taking a workshop on a private server as pvpers all have a bug up their arse at the moment and extractors produce dismal amounts of oil for the hassle of holding them. It's best to tag oil for searching and try checking around.
---
DIIIIING!
---
I didn't realise this, you learn something new every day. Thanks for the heads up, I'm going to have more than a few blast mines for the vendor now. 
---
It was staring to get old scrolling past them in my inventory.
---
Wade Airport (workshop) has some (i think 3?) Oil seeps which you can farm.
---
Reminds me of one time, fairly early in the games release when I was playing an alt with 2 friends who had just started. We were in Charleston and I was trying to find the quickest entrance into the building to do the inoculation mission when 2 much higher players showed up and decided to attack. Back then it was still fairly easy to murder players without fighting back, we tried to fight back, even almost killed the mele player in their team, but their power armor player stepped in and wasted us. This community can be awesome, but some of the players are just dicks. Oh well.

No.1, it's not an answer, it's a reply. No.2, PvP is there in a separate mode Nuclear Winter. No.3, I want the game to be fixed too, but not at the cost of my freedom to play the game in peace without people destroying my CAMP and shooting at me to get my loot every few steps I take. Griefers were a huge problem at the start of the game. I played day 1 of BETA, I was killed 5 times on day one, as was my son who was playing with me. It was demoralising. By all means have a logical debate, but ruining the game for others just makes all your arguments null and void.

Just a decent terminal to play them on would be a step forward. The standing terminal seems like a natural fit (despite how damned huge and ugly it is. Give us a desk one!) but doesn’t play holotapes. Wat?

Humans... so small.... so weak....

I just threw so many of these away the other day and I think I've been scrapping recall cards. I had a feeling I could use both of them for something but I've been playing for damn near 200 hours and never had to use them.
---
Craft pa pieces with super duper on a blank power chassis you can have two of every piece and mod em
---
I borrowed one during last Halloween’s Mischief Night.  The perfect weapon for that event.  It’s so funny how one shot lands roughly where you aimed and the other blows up 50+ meters to the side.  It’s so pointless aside from randomized mayhem.
---
&gt; With every build there are things you can do and things you can't 
---
Umm... you were saying...?
---
Nothing works properly or consistently in this game, you get used to it
---
I'm not sure it would solve the discontent. If they want fair-ish pvp they have a whole mode to play on. They demand pvp, and the less consensual the better, in adventure mode because they like easy kills to buff their ego.
---
Never mind, has been delayed for a week.

Now that’s a good legendary perk!

I don’t come across Tesla’s that much, but 90% times it definitely seems to be either Heavy gunner PA or Stealth Commando.

The rest 10% are usually unarmed.

POWERSALE! HIGH VOLTAGE ONLY! CATCH THE CURRENT... and get yours today!
---
Thanks. I've been carrying around 3 forever, and haven't know what to do with them. I've kept them just because they don't weigh anything, but now I might actually use them!
---
Yeah it is, but they are investigating the problem and will fix it in a future patch! 
---
At least that’s what they said!

Why would you get downvoted...?

For items to respawn you need to collect another 180 items, 60 for containers.

No problem here with my atomic shop. Maybe it's a platform-specific thing?
---
That weapon belongs in your hands. I have all manner of other shotguns and they don't even come close to what Fancy can do in VATS :)
---
Iv had this happen a few times, I'm on xbox.
---
But at least they said they are aware of the problem!!!
---
Fancy, Gun-Fu, and Grim Reaper is the new fun
---
I'll still be throwing them on the ground, unless you want them, Ill give them to you.
---
Aw good thought me Xbox or TV was on way out lol thanks for reply.

It could play a pipe and you could be followed around by radrats!

I'm an impatient jerk, I don't really want your answer after all. I'm going to insist nobody asked you when I really did. I love ketchup in ice cream, and probably eat fruit loops like that psycho in Get Out.

That would explain why the doled out ESO to zenimax.

Thanks for the heads up.
---
I generally have to just steal my girls controller and do it myself, got to the point that there is an alt on her account, just to store the crap I don't want to lug around.
---
For me it expired the first month, but the next month after i renewed it did it automatically
---
By default it's set to auto-renew, you have to manually turn off renewal in Account setting on your Bethesda account.

They are all secretly cyborgs that just change their skins, owned by Raid and Dollar shave club.

Jk ofcourse... or am I? Lol jk

I'm fairly sure you can shoot the owner as long as he is in sight,even outside the area
---
What about your private server?
---
nuclear winter sucks and plus u dont get your own loadout which is trash

I wish I could give you gold lol firs thing I've read on reddit this morning and I'm sitting in my truck laughing, thank you.
---
I've got a furious Fat man
---
Saying we have a PvP mode already makes your arguments worthless in my eyes instantly. NW is a shitty battle royal modus. Every pvper in loot shooters wants to use their traded/farmed gear. BR has a very big luck aspect and most ppl dont find that appealling. Everything is highly accessable in this game for everybody, its not our fault people don't want to learn things.    yeah, sounds fun and makes the wastelands more credibil. this isn't a funhouse its the post-apocalyptic wastelands. it's soooo easy to avoid everything bad in this game and yet ppl prefer to cry on reddit
---
Joined my private Map 3min ago. 1. and Shop works.
---
You can do it, it’s worth it. I also put it off for a while, but I’m glad I finally installed some mods. Especially that one.
---
Atom shop works, private server works, atleast for me. On PC.
---
I had this problem as well when my friend wanted to watch some gameplay of mine, I made a YouTube account and linked it to my ps4, 24 hours later I could stream direct to YouTube using the share button. That’s the only work around I know of
---
Thanks for this. Impressive calculator. Is it your own?
---
This has happened to me, but I haven't had to reinstall it , just took these 3 steps:
---
1. Go into System Storage and delete all fallout 4 *SAVE* Data, not Game Data, this should clear out any corrupted files.
---
2. The next thing to do, whether that works or not is turn off your PS4 and unplug the power cable for 30 seconds to clear your cache and delete any temporary (and corrupted) files.
---
3. Plug PS4 back in, hold down power button until you hear 2 beeps, then connect your controller by wire, turn it on and select rebuild database.
---
This moves all your games files closer to each other, instead of spread out and mixed up.
---
Hopefully that helps you.
---
On saturday? Why would they update the game on weekends?
---
the best: it. does. not. talk. !!!
---
yep, logging in to public first and then to private worked for me also.
---
It was advertised as a game with PvP though, there are perks to damage other players camp's. The game's cover literally says nuke your friends. This game doesn't need less players. Have you checked how many people are playing on steam?  Less than 10.000 and dropping everyday.

does it matter if it a disk or not?, because i downloaded it from the PlayStation store.

Have also had this happen

me and a few people, in the aftermath of a scorched earth, where at it to down a legendary bravo. was its lucky day i´d say...
---
Same, learning this doesn’t change anything for me

Which quest do you need to have done?

He does regardless. Ether he dies during the raid or he does when you kill him for wanted to take 100 gold...nobody getting my gold.

No it’s not mine, I just saved the link. I don’t know the author unfortunately.

OUCH. :-/ i feel you...

Don't have one, sorry

I was clearly trying to be vague, but yeah. Lol
---
For my incompetence.
---
Mines a digital download too, and that's the method I use. 
---
If it doesn't work after trying that, I'm not sure what to suggest sorry.
---
It has happened to me with some characters but not others. I just disabled the tracking of it and eventually it went away on its own over time.
---
"ppl prefer to cry on reddit" exactly what you are doing! This debate wasn't about me getting what I wanted, but you getting what you wanted, and you are the one crying on reddit. There were enough people like me, who played Fallout from it's first game, to complain about the griefers, for them to make a change. And just for record, I've not complained once. I'll play the game, and have done, whatever it plays like. It's not perfect, but it's perfect enough for 90% of the Fallout players playing now. Every game has it's complainers, people who just won't be happy ever. If you don't like the game, don't play it, move on, stop ruining it for others. It just makes you look like a baby throwing your toys out of the pram.
---
I had to turn  off auto renew on both PS4 and  steam I have yet to come across any sub service that isn't set to renew automatically...you know for your convenience and totally not that you would forget/be to lazy to cancel
---
Coming to an Atomic Shop^TM near you!
---
Yeah it's done it for months, quite annoying when trying to fast travel!
---
At the very least I do this then vendor them.
---
Anyone have a good junkie heavy weapon they want to sell?
---
What's this whole 'war on Bethesda' stuff? It's the second post I see mentioning it and I feel a bit out of the loop.
---
It happen to me very often if I run in there mashing R before they finish speaking . I have to look away and then try again and it works ....mostly
---
YOU'RE breathtaking!!!! ;)
---
I think a lot of the issues from item use derive from the fact that Fallout's entire inventory concept revolves around the ability to pause time and look at your magical wrist computer. In this game, time no longer pauses so you run into problems like having to use X for Y when Y is already happening and continues to happen while you are in your Pip-Boy. Something like this that would enable immediate or spontanteous use of certain items (similarly to how Stims are used via hotkey) would smooth out a lot of item-use related headaches.
---
I got a beserker's spear from a mystery pick that I'm thinking of going caveman with.
---
&gt;Scroll all the way down to the bottom of the screen
---
Yeah, that list needed some sort options ;)
---
Isn't that like the Anti-Meta?
---
Heavy Weapons being boosted for PA users, and Beserkers being boosted running around naked?
---
Glad you agree!
---
Asshole Fucking King?
---
Absolutely, it's a swell idea really
---
Right people can just kill you whenever they want. Should be liken that in 76 too!
---
What can I say...I'm a mad man.
---
This doesn't work. You can craft the Power Armor, and have two of each slot, and mod each piece, but when you enter the power armor you end up with only one of each equipped and only benefit from the DR/ER/RR/Mods from a single item for each slot.
---
Swing and a miss, unfortunately.
---
Not that rare, it would seem. I often see people selling in their Vending Machines for 500 - 1000 caps.
---
Oh that's awesome.  Thanks
---
I open and close my pip boy. After that the trade button works.
---
Passive mode wont to shit to this kind of "harrasment" they can keep shooting you unless you leave or fight back
---
Honestly, I'm kinda curious as to what it's like.
---
Or take over the Poseidon power plant an just keep an eye on the river bed one spawns in regularly while the plant is held
---
Berserker's Melee can be a trip, I switch to a Berserker's Grognak's are Fire Axe every now and again.
---
As others have said, pulling your view away and then back again for the dialogue option to appear again usually works.....
---
But, sometimes it doesn't. And when it doesn't, it's usually when you're in third person, as your crosshairs in third person do not necessarily point to where you're aiming in first person.
---
I know that sounds a bit dumb, but if you have your crosshairs on the bot in third person, then switch to first person, you may notice you're aiming to the left of the bot and the dialogue option isn't showing, though it was in third person.
---
Either way, if you just go into first person before trying to trade with the bot, for me at least, it's a 90% success rate. Actually, it's been a steady success for about three weeks now.
---
Its a really dumb thing to do because it glitches out the queen and she never lands. Tent standing is a lame and cowardice way to fight that just makes things harder for everyone. #notentstanders
---
Well but ruining fun is all this is about. Remember yesterdays downtime and why there was no statement on bethesdas side? Now you know.
---
It's next on my list as soon as I've finished my full nocturnal sniper. I have too much time on my hands lol.
---
Right, so you can't have what you want, so no one else can either. You sound like a great human being.
---
Cool thanks
---
It's a hella fun build, Honestly I don't noticed not having stabilized (though I never payed attention)
---
Survivability is fully there as well, though the longer the SBQ runs and the more adds that show up the "Oh Shit" levels rises but have a BeR Gauss mini for that,lol.
---
It's become my main these days.

Working in a nocturnal archer myself, so I know the pain,lol

Also, I see a lot because of people doing the mission a bunch of times to try and get The Fixer plans.

Yeah, definitely gonna give this sort of build a try on an alt.

Sounds like it's challenging but fun.

I'm still throwing them away, I have no need for them

Black Metal is war

Yeah, but dang that event is stupidly hard.
---
As a bow user too, I just shot the larger Helibots to make them all aggro to me, then used VATS on the Cargobot. It took awhile, mind you. I was also using Explosive Arrows.
---
I sell plans, outfits pipboy games, ammo, bobble heads and magazines for dirt cheap.
---
I don't hang onto legendary weapons or armour because their weight takes up too much space and there's countless others out there selling loads of legendaries with ludicrously marked up prices.... Whom are no doubt the same people who come on here complaining about stash space limits.
---
All plans I have are 25 caps or less, recipes are 10 caps or less. In fact, nothing I am selling is over 25 caps. Ammo is 1 cap each, regardless of rarity. 
---
My vendors are marketed towards players who are level 5 and up and to help them out.
---
If you don't like what I'm selling and none of it's of any use for you, too fk'n bad..... Go stare at your pipboy in frustration and vanish to some place else. I don't give two craps that you wasted 10 or 20 caps fast travelling to my camp.
---
Don't like wasting caps fast travelling?
---
You still got two feet and a heart beat, don't ya? Walk.
---
Dual Arena would be nice
---
If you ask me its just an excuse for griefers to grief and try to justify it by saying "oh it's about da pvp"
---
No he doesn’t. If you have 12 charisma you can have him make it out alive he’ll just have a grudge against you👍
---
50 cal is one of the cheapest ammo types. Much cheaper then 308 or 45, these are some of the most expensive ammo types.
---
I couldn’t talk him out eating a bullet, and I had like 20+ charisma going into it. I tried everything to keep him alive but he really really wanted to die by my hand...
---
Pipboy games, magazines and bobble heads sounds great. As long as you don’t have all those fucking useless ultracite shitplans on the list too
---
If you want to complete the mains story and be able to craft x01 and drop nukes yes
---
perk loadouts is one of the best mods in Nexus, don't wait for Bethesda just mod it.
---
ok ty you so much my database is currently rebuilding
---
You simply need to find someone with the guts to help.
---
I love my primed zaelot LMG. Too bad that .308 is so scarce. EE Gatling and minigun are my main weapons.
---
No idea what OP talks about but the "war" thing is more about complaining about a broken and badly configurated game including bad performance, bugs, crashes, weird cap and other currency limits, broken quests and dailies, broken events, incompetence and a horrible support. Just saying.
---
It is. 
---
If you're on XBox use the "Looking for Group" option with XBox Live. What I do is get to the Ambush Site, put the Recall Keycard in, then you have 10 minutes to start the event, so make a LFG post that says "Imposter Encryptid start at xx:05 - join off profile" just change the minutes of the time to whatever you want, I leave the xx to ignore time zones. Every time I do this, I give about 3 minutes for people join before I finalize the recall process and end up getting 10+ participants.
---
If you're not on Xbox, you can post here using the appropriate "___ Help" flair and ask for people to join you at a specific time.
---
It’s part of the main story, so yes. Sucks doesn’t it. I never wanted to join bos or the free states but here I am member of them all
---
Wait, people use mines?
---
You... Might be right.
---
They mention sharing the overseers plan about rebuilding the Gold Economy, and backing caps with gold instead of water might be one of those methods.
---
Although, future lore still says Caps are backed by water still, so who knows?
---
Really hope it helps.
---
Ps4 D:
---
Fail - becuase the objective icons weren't displaying
---
a bit of info about blast mines, they cause fire damage. so with the fire damage buff they also got buffed.
---
Sweet your gt? Will swing by when on next;)
---
It would be pretty sweet to play a psycho junkie who Jack's up before each combat encounter. "FUCKING KILL!!" I always loved that in FO4.
---
Do not worry, standard version of THE FIXER can be crafted. Legendary version of this gun can be purchased via purveyor, but only if you know the plan.   
---
If it was ordinary non legendary fixer with standard SNEAK IMPROVEMENT, forget about it, if you are on PC, I can craft one for you, TBH 90% of players would love to craft one for you :) If you are on other platform, it is the same. Community is great here :

Priorities I guess.

Reset every time you entered
---
Deleted those small robot models more time than I'd like to admit.
---
I see you know your drinking games. well done.
---
the idea of PvP they desire is toxic.
---
the idea of PvP I desire is team deathmatch, FFA deathmatch and Capture the flag with fixed weapon selections before the match with near unlimited ammo (but not infinite clip, still gotta reload and make it 15% slower so reload timing matters) and i can see myself LOVING PvP in FO76.
---
BR mode is hit or miss
---
Thanks for the offer man! I’m on PS4 I’m afraid tho. So if I know the Fixer plan does it show up as new option at Purveyor or do you still just purchase Legendary Ranged weapons and hope for the best? Or is it like the Legendary Modules and then you craft it?
---
I just want better inventory UI/organization since you spend a third of game shuffling through it.
---
If you are wanting to roleplay being a sabtour of the Enclave it would not be illogical to need to infiltrate first, reach rank of General and fight from the inside. Otherwise there is no way for you to enter the silos.
---
I'm wondering what costume you would wear on these forays.
---
Wish they bring some love to laser weaponry so much...
---
I looked at camping there because it does look cool. Didn't get on with the neighbours though.
---
What is MFA? 
---
I never understand half the acronyms in this game.
---
This literally happened to me yesterday. A lvl 7 baited me (lvl 23) then his lvl 77 buddy eviscerated me. Luckily it was at my camp and the dude got angry when I spawned and they couldn’t do it again. Shoulda had salt to drop
---
Honestly, I have no idea what plans I have any more. Anything that says Known gets thrown in the pile. Plans for new items for camp or new weapons or new armour are 25 caps. Mods for weapons or armour are 20 caps. Plans for things that you can pick up almost anywhere are between 10 or 15 caps.
---
Pipboy games are 25 caps. Bobble heads and Magazines are 10 caps.
---
I get your frustration in losing caps travelling and finding nothing of interest, but it's something we all deal with, but perhaps for different reasons.
---
I hate going to a vendor to find nothing but 3 star legendary weapons and armour I have no interest in, and all selling for 30,000 caps each. I hate finding someone selling a tonne of plans for x10 times their actual value, regardless of their rarity.
---
Only players who are level 100+ usually have that much money to blow on crap on a whim, yet they're also the ones who usually already have their end game gear, so these people are heavily restricting the amount of people who can or will buy from them, while constantly complaining about stash limits.
---
But that's the way she goes.
---
Player Vendors are like scratch &amp; win tickets. Sometimes you win and find someone with the stuff you want as the prices you want.... But most are also duds and you only end up out of pocket with nothing to show for it.
---
 Hey, pull my finger kid... WAIT too late.
---
Yup. Welcome to a ‘fallout’ game where your choices comes with zero consequences.

In other words, you have no choice.

---
pull my finger
---
oops too late
---
Did you just stop playing the game? Because nothing actually takes skill in f76
---
Fully agree. Sick of wasting 1000s of ammo on the damn queen to find a 1 star shovel lol!
---
Like others have said everything in that pipboy tab except caps seems to do this quite a bit.  Most the time everything on that tab shows zeros for me, it's all still there though.
---
you want to make it interesting, make everyone that loads in get the same perks, armour, weapons and amount of ammo. 
---
but have all of that randomise on entry. 
---
every match will be different, there will be no advantages to people that master 1 play style and I can't think of anything more amusing than watching people running round with bladed commie wackers.
---
Are you guys really such babies you’d cry over the add featuring RMT? Ignore them. Use an ad blocker, use a different Reddit app. Not that difficult.

Server is as slow as when triple xp event
---
Yep, happened to me today with the New Toy Truck.
---
My un-modded Excavator Armor set I can carry around 1240 lbs.  Don't know if that's a glitch though.
---
yes ty it did other than longer than normal load times when fast traveling, but that probably the servers
---
Depends on your armor. But, agree mostly.
---
Aye, you can't "finish" the story without doing it.
---
Happy I could help.
---
Oh, but it's worth clearing your cache and rebuilding your database after uninstalling other games too, just to keep on top of it.
---
You're not my dad.
---
I agree, not sure why they can't do this? Should be easy enough to do as it's only new servers with a slightly different rule set.
---
If they do, they probably don’t want the workshop. They want the caps from killing you.

 "**Movable Spawn Point in CAMPS"** [u/spanishbeast](https://www.reddit.com/u/spanishbeast/)

You can change your Spawn Point already with that little piece of crap names "CAMP unit".
---
If you change the position of this, and rotate it by 1-5°, you can change the position and the direction for the fast-travel-spawn.
---
But its very buggy, inaccurate and not comprehensible.Trial and error.
---
Maximum sweat-like typing detected.
---
I bet you don't play NW either, you will always find an exuse to hide behind when it comes to pvp. 
---
At least try it or get your info straight if you want talk about something.
---
FYI, only a few players use/have duped colas. If you come across one block and move on.
---
If you suck or just not interested in pvp that's fine, I am also not interested an a lot of the pvp elements of this game like the queen fight but you don't see me talking about in every post.
---
If I travel to a camp and all they have is crap I don't need then whatever, guess I lost a few caps that are super easy to replace.  Now if I travel there to find that you've locked your vending machines up because you are at Max caps and couldn't be bothered to just unplug them so you aren't advertising that you are selling...then I'm pretty annoyed.
---
That’s because Thunder Mountain is a pain in the ass to fix and defend. Also, it doesn’t have a spot for an aluminum extractor or large water purifiers like Poseidon.
---
 Idk who he is but someone apparently dies
---
I swear you have to be a psychopath to play Rust
---
Well you cant have two diseases at the same time, so this would neglect the whole timer/server swap theory
---
Recall cards are under miscellaneous, so i doubt you have been scrapping them
---
name BLM will never violate anything
---
I had someone contest the ammo factory. Luckily, I wasn’t there and I figured he was just trying to bait me so he could kill me and get some caps. Sure enough, I saw on the map that he stayed there for about 15 minutes and then left the server.
---
Lanterns in and outsider gauly mine.

On behalf of everyone: it's cool- we know her.
---
That's definitely a glitch, normal is 300~350 i think (without calibrated shocks)

Dammit, was hoping for bash damage.

It looks fantastic! My biggest fear would be that visitors won't find my vendors and therefore dont buy anything.

Upvoted for "Fireworks of Murder".

I really don't think you have to invest perks into specific weapon types to be effective. I primarily use sniper rifles and shotguns and I don't have perks for either. I may not be one shoting everything but I get the job done. I think perks are for if you really want to embrace the meta aspects of the game. I prefer to have the use of any weapon I feel like and not depend on perks or armor legendary effects.
---
It's kind of all right though, that one compoment is more rare than the others. Whenever I see Hardened Mass now my brain translates it to Stabilized Violet Flux
---
maybe ammo belt that acts as lvl 1 bandolier
---
fixers can fire .38 or .45 which drop more frequently than 5.56, .308, or .50 cal, even though .50 cal drops 150 at a time. Probably cheaper to make, but I have thousands of .45 an .38. 
---
I use the fixer however, because if I'm at Whitespring, and ghouls start mobbing me, I need to shoot my way out of there.
---
Aaahh, now that is a different case scenario, and I do feel that it is somewhat selfish when people do that :)  I agree with you on that one :)
---
ive read about the suitcase technique in the private server, i might use that being desparate we'll see lol
---
Jeebus, it's still down?

*Fanny Packs Or Bust*
---
Levers are serious fun because they are super powerful, can be very stealthy with a suppressor, cheap to run and good in VATS.   If I could only have one every-day weapon in FO76, my BE Lever would be close to the top of the list along with my BE Railway and (Don't laugh) BE crossbow.  Right now, magic shotguns have my attention but when that is gone I will probably settle back to the Lever and Fixer with an occasional spree to the fissures with either a gauss mini or LMG.
---
.50 cal definitely.
---
Chunkier feel than the mini but not as sluggish as the base gatling.
---
If you’re talking about the one with the fuzzy blue vault-tech blanket, that one is actually called the Modern Bed.

I have 2k hours in the game and I never thought of that.  Geez.

If it had a variation of it's FONV ability where you could detect enemies at longer ranges that would be sweet. Maybe he could mark enemies like a recon scope within a certain radius.

I always sell mine for half the amount of energy in it in caps. So a full one goes dir 50c, 30% for 15c and so on.
---
Great one.   I have a non-exp quad.  The bonus is that I get back way more harpoons than I shoot.  Then I save them up to shoot with my BE, which for whatever reason doesn't give me back any harpoons.  I guess the explosive ones blow up.

I would be fine with an AP chem, just not Jet. It's not canonical and I was actually happy that it wasn't present in 76.  Would be easy to implement, just give higher AP Regen.
---
Also, there are drinks that increase AP Regen btw. Check out lemonade and hard lemonade, I think also the teas you get from the daily.
---
Not got the answer for you but if you find the answer tell me :)
---
30k is the limit
---
Highest level player in area had influence on spawn levels , atleast on public servers
---
Good luck!! With how glitchy the game/servers can be at times...it’s a risk. ;)
---
I use this build but killing other human players is scummy (unless it’s a real pvp)
---
I just remove all my damage perks and try not to crouch during events.  Seems to work.  The Fixer is too strong otherwise.
---
Player vending machines are like Goodwill. Sometimes you'll find a rare treasure but mostly it's junk people just want to get rid of. They're gonna do what they're gonna do.
---
No it still shows up at the Purveyor under ranged weapons. 
---
What makes it different is that it basically always has one legendary perk even if it’s not legendary. After you know the plans, you can craft a non legendary version at your workbench that still makes you harder to detect while sneaking, but if you want one that’s legendary, you still have to get it in the original way.
---
While this sounds like a good idea on paper I am not sure if this is the right way to go about it. There would be no reason to visit other peoples camps if trading is all in one place.   
---
Here is an idea which solves the number 1 complaint of spending caps to see what is for sale.
---
From the map we want to see what is in a players vending machine via a "right click to show more info" on the small vendor menu we currently have. You would be able to see everything that is for sale across all that camps vending machines, but the price would not be displayed which would still encourage traveling to other players camps to purchase the items.
---
You can turn on pacifist mode to avoid initiating pvp when you're doing events or exploring if u accidently shoot someone. As far as workshops,  getting contested is inevitable unless u become 1st member and join private server or have a friend that will let u on their private server. It happens...
---
3* Bloodied butplug with 50DRWA and 50 Vats crit
---
SBQ dying with an empty corpse is frightening enough for me, thank you.
---
I like how it’s far far easier to become a General of the Enclave than to become a Possum Scout.
---
I have this but have never tried it.  Now I might have to go dust it off.
---
I see this as a win. Lots of free steel and wood!
---
Ah right I see, thanks!
---
*3
---
*5
---
 Thank you!
---
Hmm so why is it random on my private server? I did a bunch of west tek runs today (1 legendary spawn who dropped a 1*, FU Beth) and levels were random
---
If you want to avoid PvP, turn on pacifist in your game settings—that makes it so you can’t accidentally initiate a fight. Workshops are designed as PvP areas, so don’t take them if you don’t want to PvP. 
---
Don’t worry, workshops are not vital to the game. There are plenty of places to gather resources outside of them.
---
The aluminum bat with the spiked rocket mod is very good.   Slow, but great for low levels.  Sometimes I craft them and drop them for people leaving the vault.
---
*lb
---
If it was an 800 kilo stash that’d make it near on 2000lbs which is what I’d like.
---
What about rewards??
---
Yeah but your encumbered unless you spam the button to drop it or until you get to your camp
---
Thx for correction :)
---
The explossibe ones used to give back like 7 each time. I haven't used one since they became legacy
---
Not if I’m wearing a full set of wwr armor and have that perk on that reduces pistol weight ;)
---
Claiming a workshop may end up in pvp if someone contests it, so if you just want to do it for plans or achievement unlocks - claim it while crouched so no one can see you on the map and leave/fasttravel away once your claim finished. While turning on pacifist is a good idea (you will shoot others by accident at events), it will not protect you in the workshop area.
---
Stealth blade FTW baby.  Never get detected again.  Love my BSS combat knife.
---
It's possible it takes into account the total level of all people on the server, the level of the person closest and throw in a bit of RNG too. Which would explain why it's not consistently hight levels for you alone on your private.
---
unless you are a fallout 1st member, or are ready for PVP encounters avoid workshops if possible. main exception is taking over one to then instantly abandon for daily challenges/plan unlocking. keep pacifist mode turned on as well to avoid accidentally hitting someone who is looking to PVP. Pacifist mode makes you deal no damage in PVP, and mostly keeps you free of worry. taking a workshop in pacifist mode is not recommended.
---
You shouldn't be allowed to destroy people's bases in my opinion or maybe only allowed to do a certain amount of damage. Ages ago my friend's base was destroyed by a lvl 150 when we were still about lvl 40 - this was at the time when anyone could come up to your base and just destroy it. He couldn't repair it and it made him want to quit playing (maybe a bit dramatic I know but he hates griefers). These people have way to much time on their hands...
---
I'm level 300. When a new player returns me the favor with what he have to offer back (that I obviously don't need). I usually thank heim and keep it. It's a matter of honor , not to insult them.
---
But 5k pistols at 0.1 weight would be 500 weight. Do you have 500 extra weight in your inventory? Also you cant mass drop them so you have to do it individually
---
It's still as broken as ever lol
---
Damn...that's harsh 🤣
---
Unfortunately other players can't see the custom names on items. But the sentiment is nice.
---
The only events that require teamwork are Encryptid, Project Paradise, Radiation Rumble, and to a lesser extent Campfire Tales. The first three are a bit too tough for a low level but Campfire Tales is an easy one. As long as you read the on-screen objectives and do as the game instructs you to, there shouldn't be an issue. Outside of those events it's pretty much impossible to mess up the game for anybody else. If you see a legendary enemy (stars after its name) when other players are nearby, try not to kill it immediately and instead hit it once and let everyone else get a shot so everyone can get a legendary equipment drop.
---
As for workshops, they're automatic PvP areas. If you claim a workbench at one of them, other players can (and likely will) come to kill you and claim it for themselves. Workshops honestly aren't worth the trouble if you don't like PvP, but the rewards for claiming one are good for lower levels. You'll get some scrap, plans, and usually some basic equipment or ammo. An easy way to avoid PvP but still claim workshops is to claim the workbench and leave the area as soon as you own it. If someone else wants to come claim it for themselves after you leave, or enemies attack it, you can just ignore it and let it be overtaken. If you go to an owned workshop and try to defend it (whether you or someone else owns it) you'll be in a PvP zone and can be attacked. PvP is pretty rare in the game and the PvPers like to use workshops as their only real chance to kill other players. Most of the community is decent, but some high levels will take advantage of an opportunity to ambush a low level player anytime they find one at a workshop. They may also try to get you to follow them to a workshop to trick you into PvP.
---
I want to invest in sneak but I keep cheesing the AI and using a long scope to kill them before I'm noticed at all
---
I was trying to joke because you said "I am almost 80..."  It sounded like you were saying your age. :)
---
I have around 3400 hours in that game and only time I used any mine in that game was when quest for Rosie required making explosive baits and kill some wolves with it. So, since Inert bombs are weightless, I still will be throwing them away from time to time - for me they're worthless.
---
I checked the maps and read up on it a bit beforehand. Thank you though. The spot I chose near Harper's Ferry seemed to have a bit of everything so I thought I'd give that spot a go. I managed to get a bit of everything eventually.
---
It’s a “movement” of sorts being spread by the “Pvp community” in protest to the pvp nerfs being implemented by bethesda. 
---
They vow to grief everyone, sabotage events and do whatever shit they want to do.
---
Its mostly being spread thru facebook so... lol
---
After like a week of hearing about this, this was the first time someone actually tried to grief me. Haha. Tried.
---
500 extra carry weight... Buffout will give me 60 and then a Nuka Dark gives me another 30, Excavator puts it up 200 because calibrated shocks. I can make 300 carry weight at the drop of a hat. But in reality I don’t need to make any more carry weight. At all. I only want to find any workbench to get my 5k wood and 50k steel. Solvable by a scrapkit.
---
I’ll be trying in about two hours to see, I’m in that boat too.
---
I usually use the cowboy hat, wrap around goggles, and raider mask with the insurgent outfit
---
Imagine if people actually tried that...
---
That would be awesome, also we can have multiple skins and voices for them which would go well with the current game. Maybe it can help hack terminals too.
---
Two Shot was an amazing weapon, but Bethesda thought people were too powerful, so they nerfed it badly. They are not going to buff it again.
---
Rejuvinated is really good but IF you're never spotted anyways it might be unnesessary, its up to you really
---
Always bugs me because power armor is supposed to replace tanks on the battlefield and you never really get the sense of 'power' that implies. If you can effortlessly wield a heavy machine gun that's meant to be mounted on a pintle or tripod, you should easily be able to carry several hundred pounds of gear.
---
https://fed76.info/a/limb-damage-bug/
---
I believe your instigating is so called magic weapon.
---
I’ve seen it a few times on Xbox. Usually I could a laid it by zooming out/in a bit, but ultimately had to restart the game to fix it.
---
You have 4 more minutes to get here.
---
Covert operative is amazing for sneak builds, dont really rememver what rejuvanated does but my money would be on covert operative
---
I also only rock sneak level 1 on my stealth commando, but I dont mind being noticed... if I reaaally trying to be sneaky 1 sneak is enough imo
---
kay
---
At least correct the damage stats so one does not feel fooled when using them.
---
HAHAHAHAHAHA
---
Wat? You paid 100$ for this game?
---
Pretty sure it is. I can’t even log on right now, so you’re one better than me.
---
Considering the pails could be bought, and presents were already duped, you are probably looking at the results of their pre-dupe patching. Day late, dollar short there, o.p.
---
Why, low level dmg is scaled against higher lvl players
---
When you’re lower level, it is so much harder to rebuild your base. My fiancée and I are both around level 120. This happened while vendors were shut down so some of the stuff we needed we had to go farm (like flux for the rad shower). Some people are just assholes.
---
This is why I only go on to public servers to hop around vendors looking for plans or anything else that might catch my eye. Otherwise, I'm all about soloing.
---
Right, I see. Well, I was planning on playing a little this weekend, wonder if I'll run in to any of them.
---
You deserve a million upvotes for this thank you for making me laugh
---
I have the clandestine one, what is the other one?
---
Well f.y.i if you had more than 0 brain cells you would know that player vending and display cases were disactivated before the pail event and came back after the pail event so what is this your saying?
---
What if they would make sneak damage not work with bloodied?
---
It’s just a visual bug. If you go to spend them they’ll be there.
---
A full set of excavator gets a bonus 100 carry weight. With calibrated plus the motion servos I think i can carry 450 as a high str build. You can also increase this with perks. But yeah nothing will beat Unyielding plus backpack for carry weight.
---
Interesting, makes sense.
---
Can’t even load in right now, so yes, it’s still an issue. Guess I’m going to have to actually work today... :(
---
Thanks
---
Ty
---
He's saying that if someone had 7 million duped holiday gifts before the Treasure Hunter event, then they could buy thousands of pails from the NPC vendors.
---
I understood it as "WaronBethesda" was their name or something.
---
The game basically caps at level 50 (SPECIAL points, weapons, armor etc.). Beyond that, you just tweak your build and get more perk cards to swap in different situations.
---
I... I don't wanna go there 😳
---
1 thousand pails would be 2 milion+ caps and about 500 server hops... For 15$?
---
I also used a hunting sniper rifle during early game, but I had a hard time getting enough .308 ammo for it
---
So what if you mess up amigo. We were all newbies once and made our fair share of mistakes in the game. Takes time and practice to get to a decent 'skill' level and be comfortable in the game. 
---
This community (on the whole) is decent and along with the r/filthycasuals community you'll be covered if you have any questions.
---
My tip is this - PUT PASCIFIST MODE TO 'ACTIVE' after level 5 and don't claim workshops as PVP'ers would love to come mess ya up.
---
If you want I can show you the ropes in-game no worries. My IGN (In-Game Name is Bacon-Face)
---
i got the game 4 days ago everything was fine until yesterday. I love the game I hate these server issues!
---
I like to think modus made the scout's and that explains why the tests are so random and ridiculous.
---
God Howard's goals are beyond our understanding
---
I think it’s also effected by when you load in to the server. 
---
Search angry turtle on YouTube - he done a video explaining exactly this point earlier in the week
---
Add betting so spectators can wager on the outcome of the fight. Treat it like an event where there's a timer before it begins so players can have time to get there and place their bets.
---
Communist detected on American soil... But yeah, you're better off finding low levels and dropping them stuff if they don't run away. It's a much more personal way of helping low levels and can make a new players day.
---
Have to limit or prevent do gains from arena kills or it would get exploited.
---
I was just able to get into a game.
---
They’re creating their characters and exploring the vault, reading the terminals. I probably spent an hour in there when I did my first run. Now I just run out, but the first time you don’t know there isn’t much of anything in there.
---
u/ladydevann
---
I like this. Have a basic weapon locker each player can draw from just for that fight and then they'd be reliant on their skill and perk loadout to be competitive.
---
lol. 
---
and it falls to pieces when condition hits 0%
---
Yeah... it's free money as far as the dupers are concerned. To them it's probably worth the time.
---
So the other day I found a 2-star Bloodied Bash dmg gatling gun. Would that fall under this category? If it does then I want to scrip/destroy it, but I'm having a bit if trouble identifying if it is bugged
---
I had to make sure and pop all the balloons. Because reasons.
---
^This.
---
15 bucks is 15 bucks more than they had previously
---
Placed a few during fasnacht event to tag sloth.
---
Got perhaps 1 legendary tag per 5 mine, so not really sure it was worth it though.
---
I used to try to drop care packages outside the vault but in order to make sure the right people got them I wanted to deliver it in person. But I had to give up when the players were taking too long to emerge. Now I wait until I see someone low level at the wayward and drop it there.
---
[I made a post with lots of tips for new players here](https://www.reddit.com/user/plaguewiind/comments/gxm105/fallout_76_tips/)
---
Hopefully it helps
---
Why the Atomic shop? Why not just added to our camps? They're already in the game, they should be available to us, not sold back to us.
---
Atomic shop and friends list have been intermittent for me since the yesterday's big server crash.
---
Its new issues
---
Benefits? Such as? +10 weight? SPECIAL stats do basically nothing in combat in F76, and only one stat that actually matters - con - is not provided by unyielding.
---
Well, rejuvinated is for combat. So IF your goal is to be as sneak as possible i think you should go for sneak/covert operative. But rejuvinated is very helpful for when you do get into combat. I can tell you that i have rejuvinated rank2 on all my builds. To cheap to pass in my opinion
---
Agreed
---
does fast travel take forever?
---
Seems normal so far. Hasn’t bugged out yet.
---
Eeeeh we get free atoms soo kinda free anyway. No game gets support after launch if there's zero cash incentive. I mentioned in another comment they could offer these as the weekly free items instead of repeating the same stuff.
---
A thousand upvotes for the ammo box.
---
Maybe they should just focus on fixing the hundreds of issues that already exist in the game.
---
I can login on PC for now.
---
When completing quests, it takes a while before the rewards or xp show up so I'm guessing servers are still lagging
---
Omg jeez thank you! I couldn’t find the entrance to that cave and totally gave up. Now I’m gonna go back and check it out. It always bothered me I couldn’t get inside! Thank you!!!!!!!!
---
Are you really defending the point that someone who has 1000x pails and has sold multiple already did this by jsut server hopping 5000 times (not an exaggeration) I can't believe someone would believe that...
---
It’s not “everyone” (I can get in) but you’re the 100th post about it so you’re clearly not alone.
---
A thousand and one from me too heh
---
I've also wanted the Rock-It Launcher from Fallout 3 to return. However, instead of a junk jet, I want it to be a junk vacuum cleaner. The junk jet won't be implemented because of server lag.
---
Black/gray underarmour.
---
it's funny how this worked out like a Purge scenario....ends up we don't all wanna kill eachother.
---
If you're running a stealthy build I'd max sneak and grab covert operative as soon as they become available. Rejuvenated is nice, but stealth skills are your bread and butter as a sneaky character.
---
From an angry turtle video it is in the PTS.  In addition it may have made it into the real servers as well, as yesterday even though I was over weight when I died yesterday I was still able to respawn to the closest spawn point and not forced to spawn at the vault.  I only died the once so have not tested it completly
---
OHHHHHHHHHH I’m dumb lol
---
500? 1500 from my AK
---
I don't think they need to nerf bloodied or sneak builds at all. It's pretty balanced considering it makes you a glass cannon. 
---
The real problem is the lack of any difficult or meaningful enemies that those high spec builds are made for.
---
Ah. Thank you!
---
Not exactly, no. And that would imply money from microtransactions goes directly back into the game, which isn't the case.
---
But anyway, that's another problem. 
---
These shouldn't even be relegated as sometemporary Atomic Shop free item.  They should be available always as part of the list of recipes or blueprints, but Bethesda insists on adding things only via the Atomic Shop instead of actually adding content via updates that can be found in the game permanently.  Instead, they only give a brief window of generosity that people can claim something that they could easily just make available to everybody without needing to jump through a hoop.
---
What build do you run?  
---
So I can throw a party when it gets buffed and you still blame others for your own incompetence 😂🥳
---
Yeah, to sell for caps. Lol
---
Remember in Fallout 4 when they announced those arenas you could build and have NPCs fight in? They could probably just reuse those assets.
---
Wasteland\_Drifter answered that above.
---
I feel the same way. I don't really pay that much attention to who is buying my crap. If I want to specifically give something to low level newbies I just hand deliver it.
---
I think you posted in the wrong sub.
---
r/crybaby 
---
Here you go, this seems more what you're looking for
---
It is popular though. The Knight/Soldier variations are orange (one's meant to be olive green), so the Officer version sees a lot of use.
---
It's powerful sure, but there ARE downsides. The issue isn't really bloodied I don't think, it's the fact it synergizes so well with other perks and mutations. Combined they are hugely OP.
---
I'll take some calibrated shock plans for Ultracite.  Those number so many I guess per this person who started the post?  Hundreds of Queen kills and not one for me.
---
I would prioritize, damage and in this case sneak 
---
over QOL for sure
---
Shit. I feel bad for people who see my vendor and see 20+ armor just to find out its about 10+ of Lab coats and white fedoras.  Sorry guys.
---
They just really think you need to leave your camp and play outside with your friends once in awhile.
---
it does make the game more interesting, but to be honest.  I've been openly attacked maybe three times and I've been playing since release.  Most often someone's interesting in your build, your camp, or just dropping by to give you a can of dog food.  I've been dropping weapons, gear, and aid items for lower level players since the game came out.  To date I've only ever openly attacked one person, and that was on day one to see what would happen.  
---
There was that one time I got a bag of fertilizer in my bed though...
---
Now bloodied is overperforming and they said, they will check the numbers "soon".
---
Thats funny how I posted exact same thing and got downvoted to hell https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/h84kfq/caps_cap_is_cancer/
---
Yes, that's literally some of what they were doing. Ever come across a container that was filled with hundreds of plans, most of them holiday plans? I have, multiple times. One time it was literally about 600 some plans. 55, Santa Crash, 40+ christmas lights, and mounted head plans, like 10-20 of them.
---
Because someone that had dupped the hell out of the christmas presents was opening them up for the money. Since the plans can't be sold, and have weight, so they take up space in inventory and stash. So they just dumped them.
---
Because each christmas gift also gave caps, like 25-100. 
---
The chance to get the rarer plans was higher from the bought pails. But you could only buy one a day from each vendor, so server hoping and using alts.
---
So the 30,000 caps limit wouldn't be a problem if your going around buying all the pails from the vendors.
---
Will do thank you!
---
I’m not sure how private servers are handled ( I love private servers to stripping the asylum clean of materials)
---
Im getting an error I have never seen before  
---
[https://i.imgur.com/PnLPigD.png](https://i.imgur.com/PnLPigD.png)
---
I find a lot of these plus the marine armour plans and i sell them consistently for 999 caps. 
---
haven't tried selling them for anymore
---
yet
---
soz, psn: Owl_No
---
Appreciate the insight!
---
If I'm right, it kind of looks like they're near Relay Tower EM-B1-27.
---
I'll tell you what, if I ever get one for myself the next one that drops is yours for 33 caps, might be a while though lol.
---
I’d LOVE to have multiple PA mods, but that’s deemed too OP I guess.
---
If you learn the plan, you can acquire the treated or protective underarmor plan, and that'll give a decent buff to your build.
---
Dude made a reddit account to bait arguments about 76 lmao. Get a job mate!
---
Awesome, thanks. I’m trying to see if I can recreate that first part of the trailer.
---
Tried to use one yesterday, was doing feed the people and looked like I'd be doing it alone.. Set a mine by the top console, started the machinery.. Mole rats spawn, I get kicked off the server. It was right when everything went down haha.
---
It's my second favourite underarmour, besides the VTU, just because it looks awesome.
---
I still can not download or update any of my games through the bestheda launcher. it keeps saying that there is a connectivity issue
---
well in that case, you do what many pvp/pve mmo players do - you have different characters for the different modes.
---
Omg.  And event that’s actually hard in a game?  What a tragedy.  
---
The event is only hard if ur unorganized or clueless to what u have to do.
---
W: Needing the high capacity server plan or the calibrated server plan.  H: Karma
---
No problem. Good luck!
---
Or just take PA and wall phase through the door.
---
Nah, the biggest problem is hacking.   
---
It's rampant and takes all the fun out of it.
---
"Nerf any and all fun out of the game, please."
---
Your acting like I was born yesterday I have 1000+ hours in this freaken so don't explain to me how this sht works your litterally brainwashed beyond belief if you think there is no dupes OR maybe it's being spawned either way this game is broken ACCEPT IT holy fk how are people getting miniguns who shoot mininukes? how are people getting cryolators with minigun turrents how are people gettings outfits with stats on them? And I promiss you 500+ server hops would be about 1 minute per hop so about 9 hours of work for 15$ WOULD NEVER be worth anyones time unless they live in such a poor country that I doubt they even have internet
---
Got on earlier no worries. Just tried now and it keeps saying disconnected, unable to access server.
---
I’m not sure I completely understand but it’s something like that the moment we boot into any server we’re all level 1 &amp; our individual character level is only applied a fraction of a second after, so if we load into the area that we’re farming them unless there is a higher level character already in that area, everything that populated the area will be set to a lvl character.
---
.....something like that lol
---
Ahh good to know thanks
---
Pacifist is normal, if anything put a flag on people who dont have it on. Dont flag people who just want to play the game.
---
Thats shit lol
---
Haha yup
---
I like the durability idea but I feel like extra trap damage would give trap camp builders too much extra advantage. I'm not against trap camps on principle but they certainly shouldn't get an extra edge to their trickery.
---
Sounds most excellent.  I created a few posts similar to this over the last year or so.  
---
I think we could have one "plot" and still have multiple vending machines at our camp too.  Someone likes what they see at your market?  Then they will likely fast travel to your camp and see the rest of your wares.  This would also be a great opportunity to earn caps if people fast travel to your camp by giving the owner the cap cost for travel.
---

I also have the magic ie limb lmg.  Easily my favorite gun (after my tse gatling 3rd person got nerfed.)
---
I am glad there are guns out there that did not get duped to hell that can do that kind of damage.

It's not about salty losers.

It's that if I'm on a team in pacifist mode, and my teammate gets in a pvp fight...I don't want flagged for pvp just because he's doing it.

Servers still down for me. Southeast North America. Im getting error 309 (gamecodefailure)
---
lol.. 
---
as part of the "Be Careful What You Wish For" series..
---
Yes, angry turtle! He explanes it in detail
---
Yeah.. I'm ok with just extra turret damage, traps are quire useless except for griefing.
---
I’d have to disagree with you on that one. Handmade is better than Fixer. It’s more accurate in free aim for one...
---
Ok, so not crazy rare. Think I will learn it!
---
So I don't put them in my scrap box, I do put them in my stash box-- problem is, is that they still disappear. I filed a ticket. Cause I like the bears dang it.
---
Ahhh the officer armor was my favorite in 4, but in 76 I'm gonna have to go with forest scout under armor
---
Griefers will grief regardless if you'll have the flag or not. I'll even risk to say that such flag will encourage griefers to harass such people even more...
---
Not rare anymore. 
---
I have two for 2800 caps and can't get rid of them.
---
Trying to log with the Bethesda launcher with 2 different PCs and getting  the "We're experiencing a problem connecting to our servers"  message.
---
The status page  https://bethesda.net/en/status says everything is working.  But the errors says different.
---
Just carry weight mod haha
---
I'm gonna assume from the sheer amount of players trying to log back in the servers are being dragged down again causing all of us to lag a bit or a lot
---
I would like Rose for a companion. When i kill someone, she goes "Yea take that punk" or "now that's Raiders life" fun as heck.

I'd say, 90% of the time, claiming a workshop will be fine. It really depends on which workshop, too. The converted munitions factory is a big deal to a lot of players. There's a lot of info, here on reddit, but also YouTube as well. 
---
Like, if you do Encryptid, all three pylons have to be activated BEFORE you can shoot the imposter sheepsquatch. This shows up about daily. It's really frustrating, because the event is well over a year old, and yet people don't seem to get it. And one time, as I was venting about "how do people not know about this?" a person unironically responded, "Some of us don't check Reddit every day"..... You know.... on reddit..... which is just one source of information. The point is, there really is a wealth of information for anything you want in this game. The community, for the most part, is happy to share with new players.
---
Fair enough. I just would like a way to tell who is a potential enemy Soni can respond accordingly.
---
LOL. Seriously? You clearly need things explained to you.
---
Here's one. It doesn't matter how long you've played the game. Did I say there was no dupes? I didn't not. In fact, I said there was dupes. 
---
You don't even know what you are talking about. Suddenly you are talking about cryolators with minigun turrets and outfits with stats on them? What are you even on?
---
You brag about having 1000 hours, and yet find someone spending 9 hours server hopping impossible? I've played anywhere from 8-14 hours in a given session. So 9 hours over a couple days is totally a thing.
---
I got the urban one as well, but like you say, matching is important lol
---
That shielded for BOS seems hard to come by.
---
you can't loose your gear during PvP
---
Underrated.
---
That can't be right, I got three of them.
---
How many Mothman dances?
---
I'm not mad about legendary perks being bumped at all.  I would rather have them be interesting and fun rather than just buffing the existing meta.
---
From what I have seen and read they seem to be extremely convoluted.  How about you can pick a legendary perk every 50 levels and every 50 after you can either rank up an existing legendary perk or pick a new one?  Hitting level 300 would net you 6 legendary ranks that you could pick six different cards or any combination of rank ups or cards.
---
All this bs with coins and scrapping regular perk cards is stupid and just creates more hassle.  I like having the extra cards to try out new things and don't really want to scrap them.  Having a different screen to stash "unused" cards in would be much superior in my opinion.
---
Everyone is a potential enemy.
---
Prepare accordingly.
---
Whats that
---
Sneak and Covert ops should both be maxed for you
---
Love this idea. Good job!
---
You raise a good point. I suppose Bethesda would have to fix that too then.
---
Your either a kid or very special if u think making 1.5$ an hour is worth anyones time
---
The quest “Forbidden Knowledge”, which consists of turning in technical data at Camp Venture, will reward your Officer Suit plan, and also the plans to modify it, all the way up to Shielded. Shielded Brotherhood Officer suit provides 2 strength and 3 endurance and is great for melee builds (and will fetch 2-3k caps).
---
Just a heads up, treasure hunter event happened AFTER Bethesda disabled vendors
---
a group of idiots that are trying to crash servers because Bethesda is putting anti grief measures on teams due to the launch of public teams.  public teams do not require invites to join, so without said pvp change it opens up a huge, easy path for griefing
---
Yeah like automatron
---
Currently have rejuvenated at rank 1. Should I remove Long Shot and add that point to rejuvenated for rank 2?
---
And FO76 is a fucking rated M game lmao, so your point? If she had the name before and Beth gave them a shoutout they shouldnt be going back now and forcing a change.
---
Only the bit where you have a choice to open a locked door with ra-ra, if you want the slug buster, open the door.
---
I Think that's Camp Mcclintock. or the Airport just south of there.
---
I doubt it - no matter how many reports you'll send, they can't remove or ban all griefers. And for some people this kind of behavior is the only entertainment they have left in the game - after BGS removed Survival Mode and NW become one-big-exploiters-playground there isn't many occasions to get PvP in the game.
---
Nice thx man :) again :D
---
Yeah. to tell the truth, I don't even remember how I got it. I bought this game on XBox when it launched, but switched over to PC, and I don't remember much of "the early days". My guy right now, rocks a protected Vault 76 suit; again, not sure how I came across the plans. But, even though it only boasts single digits in DR/ER/RR, it buffs STR +1, END +2, LCK +2
---
Yeah I’m thinking that’s what we’re gonna have to do as well, not sure what caused it but ah well, thanks for the reply! Good to know it’s not just us :)
---
Easy enough to find more of them
---
That's a number you made up. You pulled it out of your ample arsehole.
---
It does look good. I got an Urban Operative to go with my Urban armor set. I feel like a badass in it 😂
---
We already get charged rent on our vendors. It makes absolutely zero sense why I lose money on each sale. Where does it go??? And why????
---
What war? Also, I like the workshop pvp! I have a solid fort blueprint that in my paranoia had built as anti pvp. 
---
Was being attacked the other day, and we ended up in at an impasse: I was hunkered in my anti pvp fort, he was hiding from my turrets. 
---
And we had a conversation about our legendary guns :) middle of pvp, we just taking.
---
Thanks, I’ll have a look around.
---
You're rocking a full scout armour suit? 
---
That is a good look, I'll admit lol, especially with the mask.
---
I would absolutely do that! I dont think long shot is worth it on my sneak sniper build. To many points with not that much pay off. But there is many People that are better on plannning builds. Its just my opinion
---
There are tons of cool weapons they could add to the loot pool. This is one I like a lot too. 
---
Why not these as well?
---
\-Tenderizer
---
\-Civil Disorder
---
\-The Gutter
---
\-Daisy Cutter
---
Etc, etc
---
In defense of marsupial, it is a quality of life mutation for me. The map is very vertical, and it makes hiking up those cliffs so much easier.
---
Again, thanks for input.
---
+ extra endurence is never a bad thing
---
give it some time.. theyre working on taking it all out..
---
In an ideal world we would have had a full range of items to use in camp from launch including the building elements from 4 that we lost for some reason. But we didn't, they shipped the game in a state and people bought it. They have worked on the game and added content including wastelanders for free. Its now well over a year on and anything changed now has a dev cost and as a business any cost needs to come with at least a potential profit margin. They aren't a charity, they would have dropped the game all together if they didn't feel there was any money to be made...
---
I too wish to RP as batman.
---
I’ve always gotten terrible returns on the data. I found the plan sitting in the open at Fort Defiance.
---
Agreed! Part of the problem for me is the SS armor.  None of the other armor drops really mean anything for me aside from being a trade piece for some weapon. 
---
We need the legendary loot pool on every event in my opinion.
---
It's even on the damn on screen quest log!
---
I am a full health sneak build.. I can facetank the shit out of anything that isnt an ASSaultron..
---
no glass cannon here..
---
Stop it!!! You're hurting their biased agenda!
---
Just finished the set with mask and under armor this week. It looks mean!! I’ve been doing all the enclave events I see as i believe it is kind of my duty 😂
---
how? I see people selling thousands of pails. You were able to buy 2 per vendor, if you going to tell me you can getfrom spawn to vendor, buy a pail server hop and load in quicker than in 1 minute? To get even 1000 pails thats 500 server hops, each server hop taking 1 minute thats 500minutes which is 8.33hours. And the going price on ebay would be 15$ for 1000 so 1.8$ an hour. MAYBE you can go a little faster but I doubt it would bring that 1.8$ up much.
---
As long as they stay away from instigating or increased limb damage I'll be okay
---
That is a good underarmor for sure!
---
I'm sorry you have to deal with that.  NW on xbox has no cheaters and a large community.  I find games instantly almost every time I queue.  Hope they finally do something about PC nw cheaters
---
accuracy suffers with 2shot
---
also.. on an automatic weapon Id be looking at Furious over 2shot or Instigating..
---
It really should have been a plan from Foundation.  Something like crop tiles with pre-planted cranberries or starlite berries.
---
Doesn't always work but when I'm in an event, I always send team invites to anyone with me. Helps a lot when you're farming for legendaries and loot
---
I personally start them at 50 caps and take off 10 for every 20 charge theyre missing rounded down. I.e. only full cores are 50 caps, anything 80-99/10 is 40, 60-79 theyre 30, and so on.
---
Never had anything against marsupial, in fact the opposite, for me it's essential to the game. But that's not what I meant, pleanty of options other than jumping around with a tesla
---
fun is relative..
---
it will be amusing watching the sub riot if there are no servers.. lol
---
I play on PC, so it's no skin off my ass but seriously...it takes Bethesda 2 years to, "get it right" when modders had this sorted out in under a month?
---
This is one of the few spots where you can get 2 resource deposits in 1 camp radius, and they are valuable resources at that (acid and lead).
---
However, there are 2 downsides: 1) it's super popular so your spot will be taken often and 2) the scorchbeast spawn nearby means your stuff will be destroyed quite often
---
Still not a reason to be holding basic additions behind their microtransaction services.  We shouldn't be obligated to give them anything to rectify their many mistakes in producing the game.
---
They want to put a price tag on completely new items, fine by me.  But if it's an object I can physically see in the game that also happens to be a reused asset from Fallout 4, that's not something we should be clamoring added to their microtransaction shop.
---
All? No. 
---
A lot? You'd be lying to yourself if you didn't think so.
---
Honest question, I've been playing fallout 76 since it came back online so I haven't been on the reddit, but, What ongoing issues?
---
I can tell you've actually tried this with your maximum of only 12 favorite slots. 
---
If I wanted to drink beer, just beer, I can think of Beer, Red River Ale, Old Possum, Pickaxe Pilsner, and Blackwater brew. Not to mention the other types of alcohol. So that's 5 beers, so 5 item slots on my wheel. Each time I finish one category entirely, it clears from the item wheel, and I will have to re open my favorites list, scroll through and find a new beer to slot. 
---
It's stupid. No idea why you're trying to defend it.
---
Up to you, I went with raiders as I preferred the raider quests. The only thing I suggest you do is run both quests up to the vault raid to get all rewards. You can get a unique plasma gun if you run the vault with the raiders, assuming you were nice to ra-ra on her mission.
---
You can max rep with both factions after anyway.
---
Some have hard time signing in, long loading times, lag, no atom shop
---
Why u do this
---
I think the settlers are much bigger assholes than the raiders..
---
I did both up to "siding with.." and then went with the raiders..
---
that said.. I still wish we could shoot many more people from both factions in the face than we are allowed...
---
It might be actual good and refreshing for some of these fine folks to pick up another game and give 76 a breather.  It helps sometimes.
---
Get out of here stalker
---
lol, you got these reddit nerds big mad. 😂
---
Pick up the sheilded (?) urban operative underamor plan.  Spawns in a shed right by Tanagra town behind a keypad door.  Should be videos that show the location and password for the door. Gives you +3 Str and +2 per and you just need to buy the underamor from modus.
---
A great thing would be this + the arena in the Civic Center. That as a repeatable quest for Raiders would be quite fun. Even have predetermined location and cover.
---
Well each have our own sample bias.. In the hundreds of hours I've played I've encountered one actual griefer.
---
I have, on the other hand been called a griefer for requesting fair pvp from people 2 or 3x my level before though, so that makes me feel like alot of that is just propaganda to get rid of features they just don't want other people to have for weird reasons. 
---
But like I said, sample bias.
---
Consensual PVP is not and has never been the issue though, no-one has a problem with that.
---
I want the eyebot in that random encounter that follows the settler around and plays his theme music
---
I second planning your build pretty early. I didn't realise that there were a fixed number of points to spend on SPECIAL attributes until I'd wasted some of them. (After 50 you still get Perk cards and can swap them in and out but no more points)
---
Also, always pick up duct tape and wonderglue.
---
Sooooo satisfying.  Even in PVP, probably insulting to get killed by a shovel.  I actually traded the same roll but Junkies to a friend.  We each got them off of random ghouls lol
---
I have been doing swim to win on PC and made a couple afk levels a day. 2 more weeks and I should be 100
---
I feel like a DayZ like mode could do very well. 1 life, you build up your character, and when you die you lose everything. you'd have to play super careful and every interaction with another player would be stressful. just strip the NPCs back out for this mode
---
I lean toward Final Word as the best all around .50 cal. It’s aim stability and anti armor is pretty effective, and it requires fewer materials to fix. I recently picked up a mutant’s explosive .50 cal (the one good drop mumbles ever gave me), and it seems like it requires more ammo than Final Word to bring Gutsys and other tough skinned targets down. I run Final Word as my main going into any tough fight, but admittedly, haven’t been able to test the furious effect on an explosive.
---
generally when I am going to use a nade, or a chem.. or an alcohol.. for a buff I want a specific one not random...
---
Oh dang. Didn’t know that spawned in. I bought a shielded one for 1k this week. Almost capped out so I am ok with it. lol
---
Def gonna find that though. Thanks for the tip!
---
Sorry, can I ask why this post was removed exactly?
---
I can't see anything wrong, unless it's the asking to buy plans, and that was meant as a in-game buy, not an ebay buy....
---
I agree items disappearing between F4 and 76 is very odd and should have been in the game. Maybe they had to cut content for some reason, I don't know I'm not a developer. But the point still stands that regardless of what should have been done there's a cost to change it now and they don't need to.
---
Not complaining, just curious.  Yeah I smacked him up after he kept hitting me whilst I was engaged with npc
---
I like it! Now if bethesda could add a modular add on for the fusion generator to charge and combine fusion cores together.  Example you have 4 25% fusion cores that when added to the generator gives you 1 full 100% core or plug in a 70% core and come back in 3 hours and have a full one.  I would love to top off my cores and drop some weight, lol.  But seriously it would be nice to make an add on that allowed us to combine and refill cores.
---
No offense, but that’s funny and sounds like something I would do!! Well played
---
You really are ignorant. They aren't just getting the rare plans. They are also getting caps. Which they also sell on ebay. They got more caps from opening christmas presents then they could spend on pails. The pails was just a way for them to spend caps, in hopes of getting rare plans. 
---
So they are doing two things. Getting caps to sell, and rare plans. What you also don't understand, is that a lot of these people, this is what they do to make money. Sell crap in games for real life money. And yes, they sit there, all day doing this in many games. And you don't need to live in some foreign country to be able to afford to do that. There's so many places in America you can live that are very cheap. 
---
I mean get yourself educated on the reality of life, instead of being buttsore over a game. I mean seriously, you are like literally crapping your pants over this. And you are wrong.
---
It would require Bethesda to fix a lot of broken enemies that do Moore damage than they should
---
I edited the post to remove trap damage.
---
yeah lol. it would suck to lose a 50+ hour character to a glitched mole rat
---
It sets the people back 15k+ caps when they buy my junk and I kill them, good times.
---
how many days will the servers be down for that?
---
Or an assultron that won't stop lazering every 2 seconds
---
Don't throw away the Mini Nukes!
---
You actually can put them in Fatman and shoot on the mobs! It's can be useful in events like... Umm... Well, nevermind
---
I've done this 3 times now with the mothman wing.
---
I wish that was true but the number of times posts get flamed for asking for pvp to be fixed tells another story.
---
They don't want it fixed.. They want it removed so they can be safe. But griefing can't be removed even if pvp is.. Imo the best solution is the gameify griefing and give players a way to defend themselves properly against they few that actually do the griefing.
---
Bloodied PA? You lose all the uny bonuses though?
---
I suppose if you aren’t melee it would make sense
---
🤣 Haha. He didn't say.
---
Earlier than I thought, cool. I'm looking forward to the seasons, and hoping I'm not going to be disappointed.
---
We have this its called workshops.
---
I forget the game that did it first now.. 
---
but they should do that thing where the cheaters all join to the same lobby whenever they try to play.. lol
---
I'm not defending anything, just stating a fact. You can be as grotesquely hostile as you want, but it doesn't mean reality isn't real, champ.
---
Alright your no longer worth talking to, I SAID THEY ARE SELLING PAILS! did I say they are selling rare plans? no your actually so fken brain washed beyond belief or your trolling me holy crap lol. Imagine living in a such a fantasy world that you think someone spends their time making 1 dollar an hour in this game when any other game you could make more. The people seeling these pails on ebay are the same people selling hacked weapons. Maybe take 1 minute to go on ebay and search "Fallout 76 pails" and youll see wtf I mean and youll see how dumb your being.
---
I had never seen a camp here before!
---
"Esc &gt; Z &gt; Quit to Desktop" actually
---
Yeah, and it doesn't help that for a long time, the actual Effects tab in the Pip-Boy said that Rad-X (Diluted) "Suppresses Mutations."
---
That‘d be great!
---
https://twitter.com/jg93/status/1273957170900619264?s=20
---
More AP for instance, which means way more use of VATS and better sneak. More charisma which means better prices at vendors. Etc etc
---
Fully working for me on pc now, finally
---
Always had enough ammo for it. I had times where I hadn‘t got any ammo for my shotgun BUT for my sniper, so I used it in close combat as well. 
---
But the level 1 instigating sniper rifle I had served me well until level 50-60. I passed it down to a random dweller coming out of 76.
---
Hey wanna trade that 3*? Lol
---
I can’t tell you how many times I’ve been yelled and screamed at for taking or defending a workshop.
---
this is not the worst legendary perk idea I have seen
---
good lookin out
---
I'm no care bear I just don't pvp much in this game, and I think that 99% of the player base are the same hence the negatives towards PVP. Griefing has existed as long as MMO's have been a thing, used to play UO back in the day and in every single mmo game I've played since then has had griefing if PVP was an option.
---
What would solve the issue entirely is if they removed PVP from adventure, created survival servers with the same ruleset as adventure minus the pacifist mode and left NW for battle royale, everyone wins.
---
I don’t know. I was baffled as well. I was ignoring the person who attacked me in my CAMP as I was cooking because I thought it was a different person and knew that he couldn’t do any real harm unless I retaliated. It wasn’t until my nerd rage kicked in that I realized I was taking real damage. By the time I backed out of the cooking menu, I was pretty much dead. He was obviously on a team, so once I respawned and went after him, his buddies were able to attack me. I killed one of them though. LOL
---
If my buddy, who was on at the time, could have gotten to me before I logged off the server, I’m confident we could have taken all three instantly. I jumped off because they were wrecking my CAMP.
---
Haha, to re-evaluate our gaminglife.
---
bethesda launcher says its unable to connect for me on PC.
---
They get 2 pails and dupe them ...
---
Beth only shut down the publicly known dupes, the dupers have plenty more they can fall back on.
---
also the top end dupers/hackers wouldnt even need a dupe hack to just spawn in a chest with millions of pails in it.
---
its easy money for them, and 15 dollars is 15 dollars more than they had.
---
Yes, I'm well aware. But the holiday event and the subsequent mass duping of holiday gifts happened BEFORE they disabled vending machines.
---
better times is getting rage messages when you wear a stealth suit and have light footed and the toddlers cant use their precious exploits on you.
---
https://www.change.org/p/bethesda-bring-back-survival-mode-to-fallout-76
---
Found the petition they made.
---
I'm just trying to make people aware so that we can force Bethesda to do something about it and instead your trying to justify it by saying "This is probably done by someone spending hundreds of hours server hopping" This is either trolling me or I don't know.
---
I run lone wanderer so its all just noise to me..
---
The officers suit is the black version of the BoS orange jumpsuits that acts as under armor.
---
Cute idea.
---
I did Settlers for the Rep since Raiders have more Dailies. Make sure you bring both Factions up to the "Side with ____" mission to make sure you get the most rep from all the other quests.
---
From what I understand people were using the duped Christmas gifts (that awarded caps) to purchase the pails from vendors.
---
Bethesda seriously needs to delete all the Christmas gifts from inventories, even the  "legit" ones.
---
Angry Turtle has a great video on this: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YUGQ0xvqT-0
---
Put simply, when you first load into a server you load as lvl 1 and shortly after it registers your actual level. However, because the game thinks you're lvl 1 for that first instant it will use the lowest level range for enemies in the area where you load in. To counter this, if you are doing West Tek runs for example, make sure you load into the server at a different location, then once everything is loaded in properly you can go to West Tek to ensure high level spawns.
---
That'd probably be the best approach, honestly.
---
It's just more ore.  If you plan on doing the event more often you can just save the tokens for the mother load reward.
---
I feel you.. but let it go brah..
---
as they say.. you cant fix stupid..
---
youre spinning your wheels
---
I'm not sure about all the details, but I have some idea.
---
I think there's a couple things at play. Open world areas have set levels, and I believe set respawn timers as well.
---
Instanced areas, on the other hand, are quite different. I'm not 100% on all the details, but this is how I think they work (and feel free to correct me if you think I'm wrong). They have specific types and quantities of enemies to spawn in. When you load into such an area, it will spawn in any unspawned enemies at your level. So if say you are level 50 on a team with a level 10, and the 10 loads into an area first, it will spawn enemies for level 10. If that player kills some of those enemies, and then you load in, it will respawn any that got killed, at *your* level. The limitation on this is that there is a timer on how soon you can cause enemies to respawn that you have recently spawned and killed.
---
It got abused in beta so they took it out as far as I'm aware.
---
Unlock everything.
---
‘We can’t get the servers back up, quick give them something else to talk about!’
---
Over exposure to this product may lead to extreme saltiness and entitlment.
---
That’s dumb, how would you abuse it?
---
just add a new card that inflicts reduced incoming healing on the target. problem solved. bethesda just hates pvp.
---
I would save up for the jackpot haul.  I've gotten some rare/uncommon plans from that before.
---
Thanks, now all I have to do is survive the downvote bots lol.
---
You place traps down so people die when they spawn in.
---
Ya, some folks might lose a display piece but it's ridiculous at this point. Free scrip and caps for everyone really makes it unfair for people who want to play or use the vending machines legitimately.
---
Put it on a cliff edge.
---
Ahh ok cheers buddy
---
people would put it in rooms where you couldn't get out of and were trapped. So you would just die or had to fast travel to get out of them.
---
PSA: fake internet points are fake
---
dont sweat it
---
so do i but i still party up on occasions and with public teams i might end up being less anti-social :)
---
Ok cheers buddy I’ve not spent any yet so that’s good news!
---
I like this idea, I'm down for the middle ground.. I just don't like how reddit pretends that no one wants pvp and that no one actually pvps in adventure. Some of us just find it challenging and fun.. We're not all griefiers. We can coexist.
---
Armco ammo maker from raiders, and the farmable tiles from settlers.
---
Yeah i mean, don't expect to get overwhelmed by riches or anything lol.  Still kinda crappy but you get a fair amount of junk too.  I kinda like it.  I did get a plasma grenade plan from it before although that's now worthless unfortunately because of present duping.
---
Ah I see, that’s dumb, at very least they could have it only effect the person who owns the camp. I have mine on a mountainside and I keep spawning at the bottom of the mountain and it’s annoying.
---
The farmable tiles and ammo machine are really nice camp additions. I have no regrets about buying the shotgun and plasma caster either.
---
True that.
---
the problem with "PvP" atm is a large portion of rotten apples ruin the bunch, until they add team deathmatch, FFA deathmatch or capture the flag, "PvP" will sadly be mostly abusable
---
I like these a lot more than what I read about yesterday.  
---
I think rather than big xp buffs it should just be QOL stuff similar to what you posted.  
---
\-Reduced food and water consumption at camp that stacks with Happy Camper, basically making it so you can build forever without having to eat or drink.
---
Great ideas btw!
---
Of course, I was joking :)
---
You can still get one for free. It should be in the communication room where Wren is.
---
What I'm saying is that dupes existed even after the vending machine removal and enabled pail duping that suggest totally different dupe method is available atm which Bethesda did not address
---
😂😂😂 It's mind-blowing, isn't it?
---
Flat damage/durability buffs are boring and also feel like they are needed to have a strong camp.  Once they feel needed then you lose the option of using something else because then this becomes the best pick.
---
Why can't we make higher level walls/stronger by spending more materials normally?  Why can't we make higher level turrets by spending more materials?  This sounds more like a normal vs. a legendary perk.
---
On the flip side there are people who don't even use turrets in their cap so they have more of a build limit.  They have no problems with their camp so either this perk is going to be required or its going to be an automatic pass.  IMO legendary perks should be a hard decision.  What do I want to focus on vs. "Get more damage" or "Get more defense".  
---
I have not had my 2nd cup of coffee yet (Wife stole it) so I hope that makes sense.
---
4v1 sounds like an almost fair fight to me. But then again I'm built for PvP.
---
Isn't the clean space suit only sold by the wandering Responder bot?
---
Unless you're on Xbox, just install the mod.  It's a game changer and only takes a few minutes to install. Once I realized it was going to be so far out, I did it.  No regrets.
---
thanks for the input, reason i left food rates out of builder is happy camper already pretty much hits the 90% max cap on reductions with its 80% where as role play is crippled hard by it if they stray from camp sights, i'd love to see more people actually playing and having fun in the wilds of the servers without being overkilled by the far to high hunger rates so i put up a rate thats roughly equivalent to real time but in game time basis :)
---
u/aisenhaim can you please update the onedrive link? I was searching for this post but I cant access now to that link :(
---
I call it the Fortnite Effect. I saw a lot of it during Fasnacht.
---
As I would, but in my experience mixed servers rarely work well, you always end up with what you've got now, tears from care bears over being griefed. Griefers like easy targets, look at EVE and hi-sec care bear corps, they get farmed for tears all the time. 
---
Griefers don't usually enjoy actual PVP, they just enjoy the salt.
---
True. You need to know all the previous mods before it will drop, in case you didn't know.
---
Are you winning son?
---
It'd be so great to finally see a day when EVERY player vendor I go to isn't selling 4688632 mounted heads and Santa crash plans. You see one on the map with 500 plans and right away you can assume 99% of them are either directly from presents, or they found a suitcase crammed full of dropped presents and put them all up for sale.
---
Just why
---
I was seeing the same people over and over but to me it seemed like it was because of the match timing. When I would end a match it would place me with the same people, even if I just blocked some of them for cheating, unless I waited and quit out as soon as the match actually started. Then I would get in with a new group of people.
---
Not saying you're wrong about the number of people playing though, I'm sure there's a lot less when there's no special event going.
---
Strangely enough, other people don't stock their vendors with your opinions in mind. I know, crazy right! Since you're the center of the universe and all...
---
Whitesprings have been suggested for a gathering location for almost from start.
---
Central location with tons of unused spaces. Maybe put it in one of the locked ballrooms.
---
Not sure... But as I said you can get one for free at Crater. It should be in a locker in the communication area.
---
The buttressed mod for the SS pieces are a nice upgrade.  I wouldn't sleep on the limb pieces either.  I rolled a really nice set with a lot of variety (full health build) with creature resistances, bonus rad resistance, ap refresh, weapon weight reduction, etc.  Honestly the most painstaking was trying to get 2 acrobat pieces. Lol
---
I have heard some good things about the chemist and grocer backpacks too.  
---
I created a post last week where I rated the purchases I made with the gold bullion. Several other people added their own experiences as well.  You can probably check my post history if you are interested.
---
Naw man it's the new dupes. Consider the time it takes to open up those gifts up to 30k caps and then use all those caps to craft about half a dozen pails. That's like not at all time efficient
---
Where are these large portions of rotten apples though? On pc? I almost never see people being shitty on ps4.
---
But yeah, I agree that pvp need to be overhauled and have different events and even new NW content too.
---
That's Todd's character in the game.
---
They should make all of them “team combined experience.”  Meaning if person A one-shots a ghoul everyone in the team gets experience. Otherwise what’s the point of teaming up?
---
Lol me too...Even when I'm playing halo I still got my vendors running on my ps4.....i have trouble letting go too!
---
I think its tied to them being killed by energy weapons and becoming goo/ash piles and then respawning.  I see this from time to time in West Tek with the super mutants.
---
the ability to lock an item to the favorite wheel would be nice as well. So when you run out of an item, but hem get more of the same one, it goes back into the spot on the wheel. Like when a weapon breaks, it does not completely go away, it greys out.
---
They apparently didn’t have ANYTHING in their mind, otherwise they would have put up all that shit. 
---
Also, since I am not the center of the universe, why did you feel the need to comment? Seems like I was important enough for you :)
---
Cool. Literally. On 29th, we will have an air conditioner in our flat. So, Summer Season, I am ready for you!
---
cousin of the Sofa King
---
Not to terrible. From what I remember it takes like 4 flux to craft plus you can't make the base armor, have to buy it from the enclave.  Its worth more than a few caps so seems like a fairly solid deal.
---
I like most of the ideas, although I'd prefer new and exclusive characters for Survival, and some seem like they should be all modes though (like camp budget increases/cost reduction).
---
I would add that Hunger and Thirst should be able to kill you, instead of leaving you at 1hp (a sleep meter as well might be too much, unless hitting 0 on all 3 killed you instantly).
---
Just my 2 pence.
---
Workshops are good and all, but the arena , with all the seats, pacifist players placing bets, with treasury notes...
---
No, I tried it. No damage till they enter the zone the first time. That goes both ways, they also can't damage you. If they respawn with seek revenge then the workshop bounds don't matter.
---
trap base increase
---
My stimpacks actually sell. Nobody is forcing you to travel to a camp if you don't like what they offer.
---
I feel as though they should all give experience bonuses to encourage people to use them. Then their type should determine the passive bonuses.
---
Ha, ye. I've called him big iron.
---
You guys have to tag F76 redditors if you’re going to call them out like this. I would but I forgot their exact u/names.
---
Thank you.
---
that would be nice indeed..
---
Ya, I really think players are starving for QOL stuff moreso than flat xp buffs.  I'm level 320 I think and I'm sitting on about 40 level ups.  I really don't need more xp tbh.
---
It would however be nice to adventure around and not have to worry about food and water, or if I just want to build a camp the same thing.
---
I honestly have not been impressed with Bethseda's creativity regarding these new teams and the legendary perks.  Flat staf buffs are boring.
---
Do you own a vendor? Do you sell anything? I can almost guarantee you will have things for sale that I and some other would find to be useless crap. 
---
Basically everyone has the right to place a vendor and everyone has a right to sell whatever they don't want for whatever price they deem. 
---
I personally have a separate 1 cap vendor for all the useless plans I don't want. 
---
Why not just throw them away? Because I don't mind using some of MY stash space to give other players a chance to gain plans they need or want to scoop for a higher profit. 
---
Why not free? Because it pays for my fast travel to other vendors :)
---
Made thousands this way thanks to finding bags of plans lying around.
---
This happens to me a lot but the turrets never seem to do permanent damage, they just don't stop making the shooting sound.
---
yeah, butthead!
---
Unfortunately most of the people who play this game, even knowing traps exist won’t use it. Or they actually have it equip and don’t sneak.
---
Honestly? Because you're an irritant.
---
Tap tilde key. Type in console commands.
---
lol @ the cheater that came through and down voted everyone
---
He owes his soul to the company store. I know that's from a different song in a different game entirely, but "it just works."
---
Wow!!!! Lucky!!!
---
Upvoted just for the "50% less derpability." 
---
But this is a good idea, possibly worth suggesting on the forums if you want a better chance at them seeing this.
---
No, it isn't efficient but I know folks were doing that.  Hell they were standing in my camp doing it so they could buy stuff from my vending machines. One guy bought out 35k worth of stuff in about 2 minutes before I could travel back and scrap the vendors.
---
this is a sheer QoL improvement rather than public teams but double yes we need this in general!
---
'''''''
---
How the fuck do I know what they offer before going there, smartass?
---
I can see how many weapons or plans, but I can’t telepathically know that yet again, it’s all just fucking ultracite plans
---
I don’t care about your fucking stimpacks. They sell? Good for you, here’s a cookie. I don’t care about your useless 200 ultracite plans that I have to scroll through tho
---
It's a bit disingenuous to dismiss the issue as sample bias. Thing is the sample of complaints of people being griefed ie brought unwillingly into pvp is volumous.
---
If pvp players just played amongst themselves or in organised group like some currently around, people wouldn't care.
---
However it's the vast number of griefer preying on the unsuspecting &amp; unwilling that Bethesda to side with the pve players that didn't want pvp affecting their gameplay. That's why pvp has been neutered so hard in Adventure. If it was just a tiny handful, such drastic measures wouldn't have been taken by Bethesda. 
---
Sucks for people like you but the majority spoke &amp; Bethesda listened.
---
Ye. Too much of that no9 coal.
---
Nice!
---
possible but how would you give people grinding events or kills without buffing their combat effectiveness? if you buff combat rather than the exp it'll further make those options META since more damage = more kills, more defenses = less death.
---
with how easy some broken builds are we dont wanna further encourage it :(
---
Thing is a lot of the players who complain about griefer will consider any form of pvp to be griefing, taking over their workshop, slapshooting them, anything that essentially isn't strictly pve is taken as this offense, rather than thinking the other player just plays the game a slightly different way.
---
Actual griefers are seriously rare, and while the pvp is hot shit in this game, engaging or looking for it doesn't mean the player doing it is griefing.
---
I can't log in again through the client or launcher. I setup 2FA last night and it was working, now this morning it is telling me I'm locked out from repeated failed logins but I only tried once.
---
I will still either play with my friends or solo, I like both, and get plenty of each, I do not need experience boosts.
---
I can save you some grief, the torn mothman wings cannot be put into a display case. I tried doing this 2 days ago.
---
And it does not have a head. But he is harmless. I call him Bob. He likes smores.
---
It only sucks when you tag other people and go wanted of you don’t have passive on.
---
Was the settlers final mission good without spoiling too much
---
Really weird that I can carry more with a backpack and street clothes than in a full mech suit. But then again, everything about how they arrived at item weight baffles me. I wonder if I should start a GoFundMe to hire BGS a mathematician ... or maybe a math tutor for myself to figure it all out.
---
I maked a 30min break and now 1. and Atom Shop are offline again.
---
they missed an opportunitiy to make a category where any char points gained by unyielding are useable for sharing perk cards to group. after nerfing unyielding pointless
---
I'd say add ontop of that that a broken piece self repairs after a certain time has passed without enemies nearby and you'd have a cool contender.
---
You lucky devil!
---
I'm still trying to find my perfect shovel... sigh
---
Yep I hear ya. *But*, A perk like this will make your camp *feel* more legendary, giving a good QOL bonus without being OP. I think this is what Bethesda is aiming for with Legendary perks. I would use it, especially if it means I can built in higher level areas without having to worry about rebuilding every day.
---
I like that idea.
---
as a FYI, I had bought a bunch of obviously duped xmas presents from a vendor (IDGAF that they were duped, I just wanted the profit) I consistently have been selling alot of the plans at around 25 caps a piece. Many low levels will buy them as they don't know better (I know I'm an asshole capitalist taking advantage of the ignorant, but that just business).
---
Oh ye, forgot that, I think if you enter a building for a bit he dissapears.
---
get secret service limbs. theyre  worth it.
---
Oh god yes please. Rose is the best robot in the series.
---
Doesn’t anyone around here know about loyalty?
---
I think the building team will end up being the one people use most. Those extra 4 INT will add up to ~12% more XP for everything you do—not just legendaries or events.
---
I'd have to roleplay a psycho farmer if I rolled that, nice drop.
---
I dont understand the problem.. sounds like one of your bros didnt do the mission even though you explained
---
&gt; I explain to them that certain sections of the game are seen in single player only.
---
or Im not understanding what youre saying...
---
Meh
---
Probably moved it up since they pushed legendary perks and the new event off to the next patch
---
I've found these bonuses kind of dumb. I just want task-specific match making. The rest is just fluff.
---
I know that as 2FA, I'm wondering what all the factors are then, must go look.
---
I love the Fallout community. Lol
---
Better off partying up on whatever console you use out of  game when doing missoins and wanting to play with buddys
---
Scorched Earth! You can really help people around by shooting SBQ. Explosive damage will cripple her wings quickly, so she lands faster. Fatman might have a bad accuracy, so make your friends use it too! The more the merrier!
---
I'm not butt sore over it either. I've had people drop off like 50 christmas presents in my camp. I mean, it's done. And some people are going to use it to their advantage, and some are going to get rid of them. 
---
In a few months time all that duped stuff will have worked through the system. 
---
The only thing I feel it does is rob players of the fun of getting rewards in game. But that's also their choice. You get 100 plans from dupes then complain that the rewards in the game are crap.
---
Oh well.
---
It's not disingenuous to say that the sample of my personal experience in hundreds of hours does not even in the slightest align with complaints I see on reddit.. I'm not saying they are all lies or exaggeration but I just don't really see any of the things reddit is up in arms about so how can I be sympathetic to something that doesn't even really exist in the game from my own pov.
---
Spot on mate.  These changes are way more fitting to this new system and it actually feels like thought was put into it!  
---
Disease resistance, carryweight,  and weapon durability are all things I didnt even think about but would be a nice buff to their respective group.  I'm kinda shocked they didnt include a reduced building cost for builders.....seems kinda obvious right?
---
You couldn't spare some of that air conditioning for the Bethesda server room could you?
---
hmmm, fatman vs the ghoul hordes of radiation rumble!!!, thanks i'll try that!!!
---
No. What I'm talking about is just think of the time it takes to come up with thousands of pails just by opening up those gifts. We talking about tens of millions of caps here
---
You beat me to this comment.
---
Ill try. Hope the hamsters wont catch the cold.
---
Let's see. They say 30th but it's Bethesda we're talking about here. Could just as equally be a week later.
---
Hello,  
---
try this, it might help you :)  
---
[medics reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/br7m7a/legendary_effect_medics/)
---
How short is the grace period with which friends will be removed from my private world, if I am at work and not online? This defeats the purpose of having an always online private server doesn't it?
---
That means there were higher level players in that area.
---
I am all for being able to roll stars on weapons but firmly believe the ability to do so should be stupidly expensive
---
Honestly think they should just take out PvP in Adventure mode and have a strictly PvP mode. I can see a lot of veteran players are board so they just randomly PvP people or try to get other players mutations to start PvP. This could turn off new players that are just starting off into the wastelands. For other veterans who don’t want to PvP who just still just want to find and have fun or even help their friends/new players it’s just a bother. And you could say we’ll go into your or your friends private server....well how can I then sell stuff that’s in my vendors? Or anyone for that matter? Let people who want to PvP have there mode, and people who PvE have theirs!  It’s already a thing just have to flip a switch and it’s done.
---
Yep, that’s in regards to private teams though. With the new public teams ability in patch 20 you will be able to just join random people to roll with and do events. Just wanted to make sure it transferred over and worked the same
---
Game's telling you that because you didn't buy fallout 1st, you have to fight enemies that are leveled to match higher level players. Enjoy while you can tho. Cause that's gonna be the only challenge you will ever come up with in this game
---
To be fair i love seeing them unload 400 of their precious 5.56 into me whilst i just stand there whilst in pacifist cause honestly they are wasting their durability,time, ammo and resources just to get nowhere and its absolutely hilarious as the explosions from their special mummy's boy explosive unique one-of-a-kind explosive handmade rocks my screen as i just laugh at them as they look at me in horror as i just stand there whilst they are being petty and childish by unloading their rounds into a pacifist player
---
I personally don’t like the new music and are probably one of the few that liked the nuclear winter music they had when it was first released.
---
You're better off sticking to a sweet ass gauss rifle
---
With a comment like that, I can't help you sorry. I'd be wasting my time discussing this any further.
---
What even is a john? I just dont get it.
---
Anything’s better than nothing yeah wouldn’t want to much beats the grind otherwise, I’m just working through different things at the moment a lot of stuff I haven’t seen or done before seeing as I stopped playing a month or 2 after release.
---
Whats the prefix on the gauss pistol?
---
Dang, I missed that launch completely! Which track was it?
---
Careful, the extra power running to the A/C might tax their servers somehow.
---
Stop trying so hard. Just do one and idle at the workshop and watch some Netflix or whatever dude.
---
you might be a little too far east for your current level.. yea
---
in general the area progression is Forest - Toxic Valley - Ash Heap - Savage Divide then Cranberry Bog and Mire
---
anywhere In the Savage Divide(excluding the top of the world cell) and Eastward can potentially spawn max lvl mobs..
---
If we get to ‘stop’ when the item isn’t what we want, then we can easily narrow it down to what we want at hugely reduced scrip cost, that’s why this won’t happen, it just makes it too easy.
---
"Esc &gt; Z &gt; Quit &gt; Quit to Desktop" actually²
---
a canteen would be keen!
---
Lower damage resistance increases damage dealt, 40% bashing increase and +1 perception
---
Precisely. I enjoyed the stress and the feel. It should only allow dedicated PVP characters though. No switching characters and equipment back and forth.
---
Eeeeh bs to that, while you're right there's no interesting / meaningful enemies to kill, it's partly due to the mechanics being basic af and because of those stupid overpowered builds. Before I changed my build entirely I ccould stand in front of several super mutants shooting at me with autos and basically ignore the fact I'm at sub 19% hp because of the combined bullshit of high DR, serenpidity, nerd rage, dodgy &amp; life giver.
---
Bloodied is braindead and doesn't actually require careful approach, it's literally free damage ontop of free damage, any enemy that can even potentially be a threat just dies instantly, and that's if it's lucky to be able to find you in the first place, anybody who thinks there's a significant risk is fooling themselves.
---
It's overpowered because of how broken sneak &amp; defensive perks are, but overpowered all the same. They should change it so that the lower your health, the higher your outgoing AND incoming damage is, so if you're gonna one shot everything, everything can also one shot you. And even then it would still be broken as fuck due to sneaking. Press CTRL for x2.75 damage modifier and basically complete invisibility, wao-wee how dangerous.
---
Here ya go. It was darker.
---
https://youtu.be/MOiswjQXfto
---
Just set up using Google Authenticator and then added my mobile phone number.
---
Both worked immediately and without issue.
---
the problem here is, that the game became a bit multiplayer unfriendly.  
---
i have been little dissapointed. but i guess there was no better option.  
---
after a while, you ll get to used to it. :)
---
humanoids
---
So this is why I can't seem to stay connected. Well, good to know.
---
Yeah this is exactly what pvp is fo76 look like.
---
Minor outage? The game was dead for 6 hours on every platform
---
I've got an Instigating Bow, perfect for Sneak attacks.
---
With berserkers you will loose damage if you are wearing armor. anything over 100 or 150 will make the weapon effect a negative.
---
The NW theme was a cool “dark” version of the main theme, but I got tired of it after a week. But that has me wondering if the mod that replaced the NW theme with the original still works...
---
It either means a higher level player was in that area before you spawning high level mobs, or you've got the point where you starting to explore the east side of the map, which is higher level content.
---
If you are at the point in the old main quests where you are running quests for rose I suggest you put them on hold until later on and go fully explore the forest, ash heap and toxic valley first. All the left side of the map basically. There's loads to do there and by the time you're done you'll be ready for the right side of the map.
---
the interior parts of quests, it might be confusing for new players
---
Take all of your armor and dmg resist perks off then try it.
---
I certainly need to get this one then! Thanks for the insight! :)
---
Haha
---
thanks i did sit for a good half hour after reading ITV to try come up with stuff that was A: unique to each catagory and B: non-combat buffs.
---
a reason why role play has food rate reductions and not casual is anyone role playing will want to eat and drink at a more serious rate while also not wanting to be "full" on just a nuka-cola and potato crisps where as amount of hunger fulfilled by casual is more focused on that casual play dont care what they eat they just want the bar full when it gets low.
---
both do pretty much the same thing but one is more role play friendly while the other is more "i dont care just fill er up!" friendly :)
---
Okay good to know thanks
---
This is wrong. You can eat any type of scorched. Hell I ate a scorched rad roach someone had in their lab on an operating table.
---
To be fair they need to nerf sneaking in its entirety, nobody should be able to sneak stupidly close to enemies just because they slapped on a perk and some pieces of armor, and they need to make only the first bullet do bonus damage on each individual targets, that way you could still get satisfying high damage shots but not default to using automatics, it would have the benefit of giving slow rate of fire weapons a niche, too. Instead of being completely surpassed by high rate of fire guns in all situations.
---
[Slightly outdated, but close enough.](https://i.imgur.com/MqP56wM.jpg)
---
The game doesn't level-gate quests, nor lock off areas til you're level-appropiate, because obviously, but stick around the areas you're levelled for and you'll be fine.
---
. . . Game crashes pressing restart button.
---
How.... just how 3500?! I'm guessing a mule account?
---
So patch 20 would come on week 27
---
Ten weeks of the first Season, from week 27 to 36
---
Give 4 weeks between Seasons
---
Next Season would be from week 41 to 50
---
Another 4 weeks between Seasons
---
Third Season and Brotherhood Returning would then be from week 2 to 11 in 2021, so not coming this year.
---
Wipe away you tears and praise the upcoming One Appalachia.
---
Think one is in camp mclintlock
---
possible if you are min maxing but i think (or hopefully at least) having some non-combat utility in there means it will make you choose between options since sometimes alittle less numbers for abit more convenience is worth the trade off if that makes sense?
---
" lvl 80 dude has a premium spot and nice store like build camp right next of whitespring station and ALL HE SELLS ARE STIMPACKS? "
---
Seems like people who sell stimpacks grind your gears because it's something in a vending machine you don't care to buy.  Maybe just take shit just less seriously.
---
Could you be more precise?
---
I'm just trying to argue this vast number I keep hearing about.. Not that it doesn't happen.
---
But yeah, you've already won and got Bethesda to weaken the community. Why continue to talk about it...
---
Hmm, im fine with it,but do you think we can have a anti-todd sledgehammer as a reward instead?
---
Plan you can get form the free states quest early warnings, and the north kanawa lookout and charleston capital building have spawn locations.
---
Take a look at this for all your apparel needs.

Read carefully - Moth**MAN,** so cannibal perk should work ;)))
---
Movement lol. A bunch of toxic losers who are too bad to play rust are no movement you delusional profile neurotic
---
The point was that he was wasting a nice spot and nice camp build by ONLY selling stimpacks. 
---
Not plans, no weapons, no nothing. JUST stimpacks. 
---
But that point flew right over your head.
---
yeah, sorry, i misread your question, damn mobile phones :/  
---
can you elaborate a bit on the topic of 250 resistance bug ? I have not encountered it nor heard of it. Thanks
---
It already IS a minigame, just a very bad one! 😭
---
But give me the option to buy my own specific modifier modules for 300-500 scrips a piece, so I can craft my own specific legendaries, and I'll be happy.
---
That's my assumption, they were camp hopping all over the map.
---
It's a bug, I think. I've been able to eat things that should not work with the Cannibal perk. Such as an Albino Deathclaw and a Yao Guai.
---
But you get something to eat from scochbeasts and queen.
---
I mean really, enjoy while you can. Killing those high lvl enemies and resperately searching for food to not die of starvation was some of the most fun I had in this game. Sucks that's not gonna happen no more cause now I'm set for life in this game
---
I've scrapped the robot models so many damn times. I eventually decided I would just do Mr. Fuzzy until the thanksgiving display case came back out (or they released some other similar one that had a lot of slots on it)
---
Mr. Fuzzy ones are pretty easy to get a full set if you run through Camden Park on a good server and Ruby Tie/Spooky (or Candy?) one spawns
---
This. Always. I never liked the damn Vault Tech clock anyways :’(
---
Freaking funny man. Upvote for you.
---
I like that.. Added passive repair to original post.
---
Yeah, that’s a zillion times better. Thanks!
---
You can eat a scorched rad roach, being humanoid is not required.
---
Hey! I'm not sure what the problem is with onedrive, but you can also find my guide at Fallout76Nexus. Search for Fafla.
---
It's not a bug, the perk specifies scorched in general, not just the humanoid ones.
---
True
---
US too as far as I'm aware. Unless I'm somehow on eu/uk
---
Joshua Graham approves this message👍
---
It was the main thing I was looking forward to aswell 😔

They were down?
---
 Oh almighty bow 
---
How your arrows stings as they fly 
---
Times 2 sneak attack 
---
fixed it, the format hurt my head.
---
That's great!
---
Plasma grenades will be more useful
---
But why eating radroaches made you Cannibal? Cannibals are those who eat their own kind.
---
Yes they were
---
dont try to use vats
---
rarely hits the targets"s head
---
a disapointment
---
This is an awesome idea, I don't understand why this isn't a thing yet.
---
It looked alright when I typed it 🤷🏻‍♂️
---
You can eat scorched. But the beasts and the queen are not scorched. The victims of the Plague are the Scortched, but the beasts are spreading the Plague, they are not infected.
---
Ive never taken it higher than 1*
---
I only use it for headshots/weak points
---
at one star it is not making any huge difference I can detect..
---
I did the same thing. Congrats on a great idea
---
I always figured it was from the light house location
---
Reddit likes double-spacing

I’ve found 2 in the last 5 nuke runs. I have plenty of masses though.

I am on PC. Thank you sooo much. What a relief! Will add you when I get on later today! Love this community.

Right after mystery pick sale?  That would suck
---
5, 8, 5. sorry mac, your 1 syllable over in the middle
---
Nah.
---
PA should automatically boost your Strenght to 20 (instead of the 10 it now gives) and in addition to that, give you extra 100 points in Carry weight. That is before any mods, so full modded excavator would have carry weight of 600.
---
This would be an easy fix from Bugthesda for this issue.
---
........shit
---
The issue is most people can hit you for capped damage through near any armor
---
You don't even need 12 Charisma. I have 4 charisma and I was able to convince him not to take the gold. He got a little pissed when I turned around and took all of the gold, but he had that coming. He still hangs out in Crater after, he's just a little bit salty.
---
Muffled legs.
---
Same issue today
---
If you ever do figure it out, let me know!
---
enjoy it! I started playing a year ago this month and I still enjoy large portions of the game.  Even if I don't necessarily agree with the direction the content is heading in terms of end-game.  But there's still lots of things for completionists to keep you busy.
---
Thats a good idea actually
---
Concentrated fire increases.

+1/2/3% damage.

+10/15/20% hit chance with non-automatic weapons.

+2/3/4% hit chance with automatic weapons.

Oh fuck RDR2 ONLINE, it is a shitshow even on ps4. Everyone rushes the objectives in a who is going to be first all the fucking time. I stopped playing after a few hours.
---
People will still steal your legendaries.
---
It's not because bloodied is so powerful, it's because people feel the need to do that.
---
I guarantee if all the crying leads to a bloodied nerf people will go out of their way to steal legendaries in events using whatever takes over as the most powerful build.
---
I heard for some reason the damage actually doesn't happen or is it fixed/wasnt true?
---
Put the flaming mod on it ;)
---
you can take the Dweller out of the Vault, but you cannot take the Vault out of the Dweller.
---
They were a ton of fun the first couple of times.  Just not a lot of point to keep redoing them.
---
Hmm, if they awarded treasury notes maybe....
---
I used to live under map, right next to whitesprings Station. Good times
---
Its too easy would ruin it
---
Well, maybe a character locked roll then as a separate type of purveyor. There's enough unless weapons and prefixes for each build a weapon would still be expensive.
---
If it's not working for you right now it's because of server issues, it's probably not actually expired. I am having that issue right now.
---
Okay, but like you said yourself, you are a full health sneak build. To you that seems normal, to the average player, you are a min/maxing tryhard squeezing every % bonus you can get with the RNG you have. 
---
You worked hard to make your build this perfect. So did I. We shouldnt be punished for it because we made the best of Bethesdas build systems. We should be rewarded with more challenging end game. The only reason people like this guy have an issue with builds like ours is because theres not enough food to go around the table, and we shouldnt even be eating in the same room.
---
I think it's the worst of the two.
---
Ehhh itd just be too easy.
---
If it was the usual “we suck at our jobs” and here’s a little sorry gift then yeah, but this doesn’t feel like that
---
I like most of the ideas. I think there are two ways they can implement a just and fair PVP:
---
1: dedicated PVP game mode, no legendary effects, aimbot, no chems and mutation buffs, no silly perks like frog legs. Use smaller maps instead of the entire FO map, randomized spawn/respawn spots, standardized camps (could just be randomly located large tent with stash and all benches) across the area. All weapons do level 50 base damage without level difference so new players can immediately jump into action. Supplies don’t drop, winner is rewarded caps and random supplies and XP. This will facilitate fast paced PVP oriented gameplays such as TD, CTF, Free for All, etc. 
---
2: mixed with Adventure, when player is not pacifist their name tag shows as a different color, player weapons only do base damage to players, no legendary effects, armors, chems and perks buff pvp damage. So a level 300 with his bloodied handmade will do the same damage as a level 15 both holding a non legendary handmade when they shoot each other. This mode will allow you to play as in Adventure but engage in fair pvp when you see another player with red name tag. This mode will be more complex to implement because when you’re fighting PVE battles the math will be different.
---
I just can't even imagine. At level 42, I've barely gotten 6000 caps that I've been mostly trying to hoard (I spend over 2k on plans today though, almost broke again...)
---
I feel if it were truly balanced you wouldn’t see every other person running that same build.  I don’t see any pistol specialists but it feels like 75% of players are some sort of generic copy pasted bloodied build— at least in my experience.
---
Yeah, I made this reply a month ago before the ticket drop rates were well-known. Oh well.
---
Didn't GTA Online do this at some point? Or was it Call of Duty and rage-quitters?
---
you want REAL fun? Make a Hardcore mode like old Diablo2. You die? Everything is gone
---
no.. its not really min maxed at all..
---
[its a fairly vanilla build](https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=6b455be&amp;d=sa0sg2pd2pk2e82c72i11ic2a72lr2l10pp0pl2lt2a02e00a31lv1l71ao0an0ar0p00cu0sv0sb0lu0lk1&amp;w=p80p90c52ij2i42iq2pa0lm0at0ed3i30ia0i50if2ik0&amp;m=8c5&amp;am=-13-1f-1321-1d&amp;wp=w5w5w5w5&amp;wm=1a2936-1124-17-1d)
---
Or just blows up in your hand at the first shot lol
---
That makes sense. I never considered the fact the beasts don't have the green crystal things on their bodies.
---
Probably one of the rarest items in the game.
---
That I couldn't tell you mate, that info was from an old reddit post from back when it was datamined.
---
Pretty damn difficult to get one!
---
Why?
---
Wish I was up earlier!  Thanks for posting sorry missed it.
---
Your tears are delicious mate.
---
Concentrated fire is bugged and gives 20% accuracy for automatics at rank 3, just fyi.
---
They never said it will be 4 weeks between seasons.
---
Or you could assume 2 weeks between seasons and it would be in 2020...?!?
---
one of those.. I saw one of the YT talking heads mention it.. guru larry maybe.. I forget..
---
I lol'd when I heard it and think its a sick burn vs cheaters...
---
It does? Might have to change my build around then, thanks for the clarification.
---
Thats good to know. Yet another reason for my switch to steam
---
Came back last night about 12 hours ago. Sucks it took so long.
---
You became addicted to addictol.
---
Yeah I don't find it that fun. People just want one gun because they can't toggle, smash buttons or in the case of commando not even that.
---
Same with junkies, it's a one gun thing and not even meta worthy imo when you can outplay it with multiple guns (instigating, furious, tse)
---
At 500 per module?
---
That's 1500 per weapon.
---
Then an additional 1500 x 5/6 for armour.
---
At a maximum of 40 scrip return for a 3 star, and only 1200 or so a day, it'd take a decently long time just to get a full set.
---
Yeah should be interesting - i'm anxious to see how the reduced atom earning meshes with the achieved items from the season track. It could be a great thing if they get the balance right
---
the frustration is real.. but thats not gonna happen
---
Yeah I missed my gold :/ but it's fine
---
Maybe I just don't play enough online games.. But can you name a single online game where griefing is completely nonexistent? I can't.
---
Some people just like messing with others.. it's unavoidable on the internet. And from what I'm seeing these people are just creating griefers by rallying for fair pvp to be removed.
---
No they did not, but there will be a period between the Seasons.
---
As others are saying, it's probably just that there were high-level players around. The problem is that the game doesn't direct new players especially well, you're meant to go Forest - Toxic Valley - Ash Heap - Savage Divide but the main quest pretty much takes you from the Forest straight into the Savage Divide (you enter the very edge of Ash Heap, but don't really explore it). If you have been directed there by the main quest, I'd recommend ignoring it for a little while and exploring some of the other areas adjacent to the Forest.
---
Aye, the "If" and "could" are the parts that worry me though.
---
Cue excitement level maximum on 6/29, quickly followed by endless complaint posts on 6/30 about everything Bethesda does.
---
Lol it's always berserkers.
---
I know the types.  I somehow had lost my pacifist tag once.  I joined a queen raid and while shooting my ultracite gatling at some scorched and saw a invisibility distortion and the next second I was dead by a level 420 with a tesla shotgun.
---
Turns out he was killing anyone on the raid without pacifist by jumping in front of beams with cloak on and the blasting them.
---
I would say they need to make a pvp server (non NW) but I bet they would seldom go because they want to gank people who don't want pvp.  It is all about making someone's life miserable.
---
Example, in Modern warfare, a guy with wall hack started chain killing me.  He would jump out around a building already shooting at me.  He would walk across the map strait to my next respawn.  Their goal is only to torment people.
---
That free bundle we got was decent... ill take another one of them!
---
That's adorable!
---
Yes there will, but why make a comment assuming it will be 4 weeks just so you can complain about something that isn't true?
---
What if survival tents bounced out CAMPS?  Kappa
---
With mixed servers? Not that I can think of off the top of my head. I'm a firm believer that everyone should be able to play the way they want to, and if it was my game I'd take steps to ensure that was possible.
---
it was, but we've moved on to ellen deloria and brailee ewers, it's fun to see who recognizes the names
---
Right now i roll a two star and a three star weapon every morning, that’s two completely random chances drawn from a million possible combinations. I don’t blame murmrgh for all the nocturnal pipes because realistically the chance to get something i like is slimmer than slim. But if I spend 5 scrips, see a cryolator, say ‘stop’, and try again, I can probably run into weapons i can use within 50 scrips. Then spend the next 100 scrip to refine the effects. That my friend is a huge cost saver. Yes I don’t mind it’s character-bound at all, trading is useful but it’s more fun to loot/roll my own.
---
The hate is truly hilarious. 😂 They are going to love today's video. (I disappeared for almost 2 weeks from video making cause of real life things, but Mama Riley is back!)
---
I agree. Was thinking this the other day. 
---
I have 1st so have a tent. I would have no issue at all if I got notified that my tent had been recalled or whatever to make way for a camp. It's no big deal.
---
There are lots of really nice and helpful communities on twitch if you like to use it and they are very welcoming of new players.
---
There’s plenty of servers in the sea... 
---
Tho I do think we should have the option to pick up our camps, I don’t necessarily need to leave it anywhere permanently
---
Yeah its definitely worth it, if a bit cheaty haha.
---
I don't think I've ever even seen an inert bomb. Weird.
---
Unpopular opinion: I don't mind FO1st members being prioritised. They are paying after all. And them paying keeps the majority of the game free for me. 
---
I say free as even though I bought the game in the first place, I feel like I've got my money's worth already.
---
Hey man, if were talking about ADDING new things to change up build meta, im all for it. I agree bloodied is braindead and I hate that theres really only 2 - 3 builds that a considered viable for high level end game stuff. I
---
I just dont want them to simply nerf things or take them away without adjusting or adding anything else to make up for it.
---
I’ve had fallout 1st since the day it was released and I would love my tent to get packed up in order to let someone’s camp load in.
---
As an owner of a survival tent, I'd be completely on board with this. If my camp can't be placed I'll always find a new server, but if my tent can't be placed I'll just move it. It's easy enough to relocate a survival tent anyway. I doubt they'll do it, but I'd love it if they did.
---
What's your platform?
---
Tbills are easy to farm, and have no limit. Might as well get rid of scrip if this gets implemented. I'm in favor of removing the daily scrip limit mind you, but since Beth seems keen on keeping it - I doubt this would fly.
---
**F**
---
Its cool just thought itd be a duff use for treasury notes there would obviously be limits. But after everyone got everything they wanted it'd be something else to spend them on.
---
I have one too. My husband found it way back in the day, and gave me it. I've never, ever seen it in the wild for myself.
---
Although I reckon I'd have more luck finding another red than finding the yellow or forest. To me they are just as rare.
---
let's hope it's not a daily repeatable
---
no. I’m level 359 and my base is in the forest. protected from nukes. calm. quiet. the sound of a gentle water stream behind my cabin. just like a home should be. 
---
good luck on your daily war though.
---
I am not, and have never been a 1st member. I think first come first serve is fair. Besides, the way stuff gets loaded in is due to the engine. Changing it would be more trouble than it's worth (see also: "dont give me a world that I cant place my camp in")
---
Yeah I've only gotten one other color besides white. The blue one I put on Beckett with a toothy man mask like me. Lol
---
it shows up under daily repeatables
---
Yeah I've only gotten one other color besides white and red. The blue one I put on Beckett with a toothy man mask like me. Lol
---
We have this huge and interesting map, being shoved into an arena or single town to pvp seems like a tragedy. I would rather have a separate game mode that's just pvp. Make it easier to balance by making all weapons and armor use their NW stats (or just strip legendary modifiers) for pvp combat and their adventure mode stats for pve combat.
---
Then if you don't want pvp, don't play that mode.
---
My bloodied handmade already wrecks stuff tbh, any extra benefits at this point will definitely feel like cheating. Half the time I use a non bloodied weapon on my bloodied build anyway as it still wrecks stuff and isn't needed except for SB, SBQ and Sheepsquatches etc
---
And so the old man wandered the remnents of West Virgina,  muttering to himself about these goddamn kids and how they should geddoff his lawn.
---
He wandered long and far, searching for that elusive plastic he would need to craft shells for his shotgun, the one cradled under on arm as he sat on his rocking chair, waiting, watching, in APPALACHIA!
---
I figured like have the ability to do it only once a day and it would be costly to do so would balance it.  Because theres a good bit of items people dont wanna buy with treasury notes and itd give them another use. And it would also encourage engagement in public events.
---
american gothic roleplay.
---
Wait... Is there people out there who DON’T know about Blast Mines?? It’s like my favorite mine.
---
Find someone to craft you a few, you can scrap to unlock it. I sell them for 100 on pc.
---
Was hopping way back, top of the stairs in berkley springs, there's a room there that can spawn it on a table. Close to the workshop.
---
A camp is someone’s home base, typically with multiple times the resources and tools than a tent has. Tents are made to be mobile anyway. Why should a tent bounce out camps?
---
I was on 7:00 am on PS4 for about 1.5 hours (adventure and private) with no issues.
---
sorry i was just joking hence the kappa.  i don't actually believe that should be a mechanic.
---
I forgot to put that in the post, oops
---
I play on PC
---
Do you mind linking one?
---
Thanks for telling me
---
They often spawn in Morgantown - go to the area on the main road where the tents are. On the table in the large tent clothes and headwear spawn. Combat helmets can spawn in there.
---
I think it would be cool to be able to buy ‘legendary weapon blueprints’ with gold, then buy legendary modules with scrips, and roll them just like plasma caster and gauss mini. The legendary blueprints would be plans for all the existing weapons in game, but when you learn it you can craft legendary versions of it just like the wastelander weapons. Of course the crafted legendary items would be character-bound to prevent abuse. This will allow us to do more stuff after we’ve got all the wastelander items. I’ve already got the T65, ss plans, gauss mini and shotty, and have been wondering what to do next. Now if I can craft my own rolling pin collection that would keep me busy for the months to come...
---
I'd happily go into something like survival if say no legendary weapons or armour were in play. That way everyone would be on a level playing field
---
Yeah I’m enjoying most of it I still hate falling In those bloody trenches down the bottom right!
---
I think a lot more builds are very much viable at endgame, but there's these few builds that far outshine anything else, I think it's the top and bottom builds (aka legendary effects) that need to be brought toward the middle.
---
Bloodied / junkie / sneak / mix of those can't be the norm, it's too faceroll.
---
I had to urban dictionary that. Twitch origin? I don’t watch streams, forgive my ignorance.
---
Use a bullet
---
well if my build is seeming min/maxed to you we definitely do not agree on what min/maxed is for sure.. lol
---
all Im saying is you do not have to be a glass cannon to be a sneak build.. nor min/maxed
---
A daily tbill sink that isnt bullion? Yeah, I could see the niche for that. I've got full modded SS armor so bullion seems kinda lackluster to me now, would be nice to have another outlet for the tbills + a reason to keep grinding events. Not bad OP - maybe edit your original text to include that bit.
---
If a scorchbeast farts on them, can they be eaten?
---
That would be cool honestly and it wouldnt be able to trade would prevent abuse from being duped and traded.
---
Bethesda and stable servers?
---
There's a joke in there somewhere. 
---
Looks like things are back to normal now, for the most part.
---
It would be a nice way to spend my ever increasing stack of treasury notes.
---
I wonder if the purveyor and exchange machines could switch to notes or gold? Would be less currencies and daily limits and capacity limits to manage.
---
Build the base with all foundations and stairs. It's what I did for a while. The echo blasts can still damage you through them though.
---
Definitely. We only have limited storage so it can’t hurt at all to be able to keep rolling our own dream set.
---
Any time I get shot by some super low level eye bot on 76 I always say “F*ck you Eddie you little traitor!”
---
And then I get sad because I realize Eddie isn’t here...
---
(It’s been awhile since I played New Vegas... A little hard to go back and play it since Fallout 4 has spoiled me so much.)
---
lol yeah sometimes i forget about bubbles and all that xD
---
I have mixed feelings about bloodied builds.  As others have said, they're self-limiting as health levels are low.  One wrong step and you die.  But they are pretty OP otherwise.  
---
I kind of wish the associated legendary effects (bloodied, unyielding, bolstering) weren't in the game from the start.  Nobody would miss being a glass cannon if it weren't an option from the beginning!  But there's no good way to remove bloodied effects now that it's the go-to meta for such a huge percentage of the player base.  Significant nerfing at this point would also be a major problem for the same reason.
---
(I also wish that the rest of the RNG-based legendary effects were absent from the start, with the game scaled accordingly.  IMO, it'd be a more interesting game if crafted weapons and armor were the norm, like in FO: NV, with only named quest reward items having added effects.  But that's a whole other can of worms.)
---
My biggest concern, though, is that ongoing game scaling may end up being skewed to account for bloodied builds.  It'd be unfortunate if future event bosses and high-tier mobs were turned into even bigger damage sponges simply because fights are being completed too easily/quickly by bloodied builds.  Arguably, increases in environmental damage (such as in the final fight against Earle Williams in the Colossal Problem quest) will help limit the effectiveness of bloodied builds, as they'll need the health points to survive.  But I'd hate to see that as the go-to solution everywhere.
---
It's somewhat stable, I feel like they are about to crash every 5 minutes though since patch 19.
---
Ding ding ding!
---
Free money!

 [https://www.twitch.tv/nes8bitcollector](https://www.twitch.tv/nes8bitcollector) tell em Couratious sent you and they will sort you out.  really nice people and such a fun stream to hang out in.  Usually live in afternoons/evenings NA time.
---
give  [https://www.twitch.tv/medic1556](https://www.twitch.tv/medic1556)  a follow as well he is live right now.  really nice guy and a great community over there.
---
I wouldn't have an issue with this really. My tent can be moved easily enough with no hassle.
---
I was thinking something more of the lines at the gold bullion exchange machine there would be an item you can exchnage X treasury notes to get that item which is a randomly rolled legendary weapon.
---
I feel you. I got off of a seriously shitty shift at work ready to relax and play some fallout. make dinner, find out my homework due date has been pushed back (more time to play!!). get all logged in and ready and - servers are down. wait for hours for just a little play time before I had to go to sleep to wake up for an early shift today. nothing. fingers crossed the servers don’t shit themselves again before I get a few hours in this afternoon
---
How do you know it's not true?
---
Are you secretly Todd?
---
I think he's talking about high damage output types one-shotting legendary mobs.  That's not exclusive to bloodied builds, but it's sure easier for them to do so.  In a way, the whole complaint comes down to "Don't be a jerk.  Don't one-shot legendaries in group events."
---
I think that fart itself the Plague. The scorched wont turn to scorchbeasts.
---
Think this way: you can eat the fingers (the scorched), but you can not eat the brain (the beasts).
---
Do the raiders you can get a special gun if you pick them talk to ra ra when your in and she goes through vents to open a door for you.
---
I breezed right through the Vault with the Settlers on a different character. The Raiders have more interesting questlines, including the Vault raid itself. Plus, you can get a special legendary plasma rifle with the Raiders - which was like the old games where you could find a legendary lying around in the world. I'm not sure why, but it felt like Vault 79 was way too easy with the Settlers.
---
Im old.. the thought of playing a FPS with a controller gives me night sweats.. lol
---
I think its worth it just for the controls alone.. YMMV
---
I've been noticing many inconsistencies with damage output.  Yesterday (before the servers died) I was in watoga smashing bots with my instigating meat hook and I'd kill one level 50 protectron with ease, then the next one same level and it took about 8 whacks each one seemingly doing less damage than before.  Then the very next one died in one whack.  Something is absolutely wrong but I can't put my finger on it.
---
I have found the wanderer and raider punk out. Found punk near cranberry bog and wanderer can’t remember where. But I have her as mine now. I started with the beer guy then astronaut then the forger, then punk and now wanderer
---
Mine isn’t loading and is giving a similar error to the outage last night. Just tried logging in
---
&gt; Wish I could save progress on private server.
---
As a new player, that's what I thought the "private server" would be. Like a weekly-reset thing I could just rejoin and continue my progress.
---
Nope, if I run to the restroom real quick i get kicked and all my progress/materials spent building stuff up is all wiped? What the hell kind of "private world" is that?
---
Such an utter disappointment. One of the few that I have for the game so far...but a *really* big one.
---
Do you know what stable servers mean to Bethesda?
---
Servers that are in the stable.
---
I dont know how you are about scrapping, but I realized at about level 60 that I was scrapping every weapon and piece of armor I didn't need simply out of habit. Now, unless I need a specific component from weapons or armor, I vendor them. With the bargain perk and a beer, the caps you earn add up pretty quick.
---
Honestly it feels so similar to packet loss that you experience in games like war Thunder
---
Sounds like Hitman Reborn music. https://youtu.be/TfsU4HooAhs
---
Ha! I might!
---
I did this, but my few weeks of progress on a console is in no way a match to your time in game. Only you can make that call mate, I'm not sure I'd want to start over after that length of time, the rare plans and apparel stuff...yeah, they would be a pain to get back.
---
Where are you from?
---
Such an odd argument, you chose a random number and are asking someone else to disprove it?
---
It's like religion. HOW DO YOU KNOW GOD'S NOT REAL?

For me dosnt work yet, load the but when into world it says No Connection to the server

Mine is just north of watoga. I have discovered that if I put camp items in certain locations, it will actually cause enemies to spawn. If I put buildings too close to the watoga side of my camp, it will cause super mutants to spawn and start shooting at my base from 200 yards away. If I put my vendor in the center, it will cause glowing bears to spawn. Maybe play around with the arrangement of your stuff.
---
North American servers. Now the error is “failed to download title storage”
---
Yeah you can build forever already. The bars don't really move.
---
Yes, we can assume 2 weeks between the Seasons too.
---
It's not like they have been having problems in Release dates before, so let's go with 2 weeks and Season 3 would start then on 15th of December.
---
Well if you use pa the t65. If you don't use pa the ss.
---
That's cool, but I just gave an example of how a lot of those items have nearly identical effects.
---
 servers seem fine 
---
What system?
---
I've had one good PvP fight (barely won it it, I had maybe a tenth of my health left), the rest I've been attacked by people who take no damage from me with anything I've got (grenades, mines, radium rifle, gamma gun, bloodied double barrel, missile turrets) and can instantly kill me and destroy my camp in 10 seconds or less. Especially the first guy, he apparently did not like me having a camp so he just sat there and made sure it stayed destroyed. Could not do a thing to him, my non legendary pistol build did nothing but let him one shot me.  The vast majority of my PvP experience has been with griefers so I try to avoid it all the time now. The last two people who attacked me found a way to get me into PvP without me doing anything to them in the first place. Not all the PvP is griefing, but most of the people who want to fight me have been.
---
 I used to try to hold workshops, but I didn't have any legendary gear back then so I stood no chance against the people with explosive shotguns, explosive tesla rifles (that one was very much not fun), and the one punch wonder builds people had. These guys I'm pretty sure were not greiefers, they just wanted a fight as once one of them started others would join just to fight each other. I still did very little damage to them, but at least I did some tiny bit of noticeable damage. Now it would just be a waste of time and resources for me, I've got better things to do than deal with PvP people who will most likely be nearly invincible to me. A large chunk of why I don't PvP now is the legendary gear people have. I just can't compete with what they've got, I'd have to rebuild my character's gear and skills to make him more competitive or build a new character from the ground up.
---
PS4
---
Yep, can't login anymore, getting error:

Failed to download config from Title storage \[4:10:8\]
---
Depends on if you use power armor or not
---
Aghh sheeee
---
I vendor them if I'm close by, but usually I'm so overweight I end up scrapping and I'll sell bulk supplies later on if I need to. The few times I have a good day of playtime, I can get all 1400 caps out of the vendor, but it's not all that often :)
---
I've come to think they are in some sort of refresh/death timer.
---
Happens regularly for me at The Mezz.
---
Oh, I’m not doing it for materials! The only thing I’m ever in search of is screws. Heck - I don’t even need to grind for gear anymore. This is purely a completionist thing and wanting to actually build things and see my flag all over the map :)
---
downvoting won‘t bring the servers back either, sorry.
---
Given what we've seen of the legendary perks (and their terrible artwork.. it's just so cheap and rushed), I hope they never see the light of day. If that's all the team could come up with, then we don't need them and I doubt most of us want them. 
---
So until they've gone back to the drawing board with a significant overhaul, it shouldn't even be an area of focus, it's just a pie in the sky concept at the moment.
---
Perk Loadouts on the other hand - is a much more grounded and significant quality of life feature that will provide a ton of value to players\*, that's what the focus should be on.
---
Fix your shit, Bethesda.
---
\*specifically console players, but I'm sure there are plenty of PC players who don't mod for one reason or another. Plus, this should have just been there from the start.
---
Can only attest to the SS armor, it is sweet. That jetpack that runs on AP is heaven compared to the one that eats your fusion cores for breakfast. 
---
Do you play in PA mostly? If yes then maybe worth it to go T-65, but from what I've read some people are disappointed with it.
---
I was on a hour ago, Now the that I have returned the log on error is happening again on the Bethesda Launcher.
---
They are bitches and crybabies is what they truly are, One of them died when he tried to take the ammo factory from me next time check the area. You died once and hop servers just what I've come to expect from the so called pvp community you can dish it but can't take it
---
Yeppppppppp. Me too
---
Offering someone a gift and then leading them to their death doesn't make them greedy, it makes you a psychopath.
---
Amazing!
---
That's been happening for a long time. I've been going to kill a legendary, and before I could even get a shot on it, it drops over dead. Very frustrating.
---
Yup. Best to just avoid this reddit for the first week or two following 6/30 haha.
---
If you set up camp to the south westish of watoga, close to the cement boardwalk where assultrons patrol (where the monorail enters the city), they will generally protect your camp from invaders.  The only thing that might cause trouble are the supermutants on a nearby roof that might take potshots.
---
The assultrons also kill any companions or pets, which is why i ultimately relocated.  Still it's a pretty good spot for a camp.
---
I'm trying so hard to find someone to sell me one fashcnt mask with death claw or old man winter... Any one have one they're willing to part with? I have over 15k caps and ill give you anything from my inventory.
---
That used to happen to me all the time at Whitesprings.
---
Can't login in the PTS forums either.
---
Hmmm idk I'm in EU rn and I'm in fine
---
Finally. somebody asked. FFS pipe guns are the ones that I love about this post atomic world, and I think the fact that they literally do no dmg, is kinda BS. Cmon buff them
---
Same just now
---
Me too.
---
Yep on XBox too
---
Game was working till I got kicked. “Failed to download config from Title Storage” is the error I’m getting
---
Same, Bethesda portal still says everything is opperational. i got error when trying to log in directly from the exe
---
source?
---
Don't know why was wondering, never use it but that's interesting. Goes kind of deep.
---
Did you get 4:10:8 code too?
---
[Fasten your seatbelt... its going to be a bumpy night](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3vEEh0GF_C8)
---
Looks like the MFA is messing things (?)
---
I've only gotten the SS armor. The jetpack is my favorite thing in the game.  Your mobility is outstanding with it.  Not to mention the SS has great stats.
---
Yes. Same. And their "live status" website says the game is fine, which means it's probably a manually updated site.  
---
Same on ps4 in ohio
---
What is pa?
---
"EXHALATION OF AIR THROUGH NOSTRILS"
---
Yeah I can't be arsed to even try farming one, the drop rate is too low.
---
Ooo power armor.. sorry 😂
---
Well this I one more
---
We told them to feed the hamsters after yesterday. Someone clearly forgot.
---
SOMEONE CALL PETA!
---
Now the server is offline in the client too. Enjoy;)
---
Intrigued by the idea. Each time I play, I am more convinced that if they do not simplify or reform the economy, then we do need a real currency exchange system. Caps, scrip, and t notes should have a conversion rate, and we should be able to go to a kiosk and exchange unwanted currency for what we need. They keep adding currency types, but they are neglecting adjustments to the existing systems to reflect changing market values. The legendary scrip economy is in a bad place because the stingy RNG makes it almost a pointless exercise with a low cap on scrip that can be earned and a really low trade in limit. I would not cry at all if legendary scrip was done away with altogether.
---
I was just on a server and I wanted to hop so when I tried to log back in it keeps saying “disconnected from server” and back to main menu. Fml
---
FWIW, death isn't that big a deal in this game. You take some armor damage and drop your junk.  Best advice is to scrap and stash your junk frequently, especially if you have a load of something rare or expensive (ballistic fiber, screws, stable flux, etc.).
---
As others have said, claim and abandon workshops if you're interested in the loot rewards (easiest way to get plans, save for buying from a reasonably priced player vendor).  They're usually not that big a benefit to keep anyway.
---
Arguably the rarest item in the game.  Hold on to that bad boy!
---
same. i was just on late last night. thought they resolved it.
---
same. cannot launch game or log into bethesda.net.
---
Same here on PC.
---
Ahhh well glhf
---
 Same. Getting “Incorrect username or password” on their forum too
---
Can neither confirm nor deny.
---
Yeah, I'm not seeing a source on this either, and the Bethesda Status site says Fallout 76 is Operational. But I also can't log in though. [https://bethesda.net/status](https://bethesda.net/status)
---
Picking up a battery.
---
Getting issues logging into bethesda.net again, so yeah looks like further issues. It was working fine earlier.
---
I keep a base there next to the fissure. You will always have high level spawns near there, 45-80. If you want the lead deposit, go south from where your base is, closer to Fort Defiance, just down the hill from the fort, between there and the Antique shop is another lead deposit. The spawns there can be as low as 20s, but can still go up to 65 if the random event spawns closer to Antique shop.
---
Only do the northern lead deposit if you want to get the Home Defense perks for better turrets, or just don't care about your base being damaged by scorched attacks. 
---
Either way, have fun! :)
---
Honestly I wouldn't be surprised if it is 100% due to poor server quality, that would help explain why its so random
---
Better than the mystery pick.  At least you could roll more than 1 gauss weapon per day.
---
Same here on Xbox in CT, USA
---
Yeah, I can't log in either, keeps saying my username and pass is incorrect on the website, and the launcher says I'm  not connected to the internet.... Today's gonna be buggy. :/
---
They will have to lower everyone’s stash weights back to 600 because of his AC
---
REASSURING MOO
---
Theyre down again. Save youre leave time
---
I just got disconnected but I was able to rejoin
---
Most satisfying sound might just be the “Cha-ching” after every kill.
---
Surely not again
---
That's really silly. Why is there no auto-check to see if things are operational ?
---
You guys spoke too soon and jinxed it. Now we're back into login errors again.
---
Yeah, getting the same. I loggedxin this morning with no issues and played for about 20 minutes.
---
yup, i know what the code means, i just don‘t believe it‘s coming from bethesda. this is obviously an attack.
---
Seen the same and have also seen mobs that can't be killed but also don't do anything.
---
And [help.bethesda.net](https://help.bethesda.net) is down too!
---
Yup it's back, God damnit bethesda
---
here we go again
---
MOOooo𝘖𝘖𝘖ooo
---
Same here. I can't even log into bethesda.net. Thought maybe I forgot my password but it said no account with my username of email address existed. Guess its somewhat reassuring its just their system being broken again and not me getting hacked
---
As others have said, it depends on what armor you prefer. I would point out that the T-65 is a one and done craft though requiring no script, where as getting a good three star legendary effect on 5 different pieces of secret service armor could take thousands of script or even more.
---
Yup. Cant play.
---
Yes, me and my friend
---
They are down again for testing for an undisclosed amount of time
---
The Bethesda launcher is acting strange too... it says I am disconnected and I can not log in to my account in the website either.
---

---
I wouldn't mind these interruptions as much if they would at least communicate what's going on and approximate down time.
---
Yes they are
---
You got banned bro
---
Because the site would probably almost always state there is an issue with one of their services and they don't want their consumer base to see that.
---
Bethesda screwed up on the level and main quest line in my opinion. 
---
All of Rose's quests needed to be either in the Ash Heap or Toxic valley.  It honestly wouldn't be that hard to switch locations for many of these quests.
---
Yeah, I've been trying to collect all the colors also. Got white, brown, and green so far... They're like shiny pokemon!
---
Nothing you can do but move your camp slightly unless you can clip into the environment using a crafting station/cello on the stairs trick.
---
That sucks does it happen often ?
---
Same here. Me and my friend can't login
---
Apparently vault tec engineers are hard at work,  I don’t believe them though.
---
Welcome to 76!
---
I'm glad to read that you received a warm welcome. This game has a remarkably friendly and helpful community and I'm always happy to see resh players making having friendly encounters and a good impression.
---
Server stability and bugs may always be the gambling part here, but the cool community is always worth to stick around for imo.
---
here we go again..
---
Nah I'm joking, servers are down again. Seems like a cyber attack. But it's not just fallout so. Well see what happens
---
Same. I launched one for the enclave mission, never fired another since. usually every server has the SBQ running in a few minutes anyway
---
Same.
---
I have to say, it was liberating not being online to do the 3 daily quests and whatever crummy low level events in a scramble to get my 20 notes for my 200 gold for the day.
---
Me too. This is garbage!
---
😂😂
---
Yep having same problem cant even login to their own website atm.
---
It used to break the primary effect on legendaries.  Seems to be working correctly since Wastelanders.
---
I'm pretty sure you not even reading what I wrote. I personally dont think its min/maxed. What I said was:
---
&gt; to you that seems normal, to the average player, you are a min/maxing tryhard 
---
You dont even understand what this post is about and literally have no useful or meaningful input. You just disagree with my post and are arguing. Literally thats it. What are you adding to this discussion? lol. Have a nice day.
---
Either that or they are being attacked by alien hackers angry that 76 has cut all the alien stuff except for the Flatwoods monster...
---
And\^before\^anyone\^asks\^no,\^I'm\^not\^an\^alien\^hacker\^who\^wants\^Alien\^stuff\^in\^the\^game...
---
Seems to be working now
---
They should do what ESO does and designate areas PvP zones or at least add more PvP events for players to participate whenever they want. Win-win for everyone.
---
And when you enter the e-mail adress, it says, try again.

(Yeah, I'd love to have Rose following me around throwing raider-flavored shade at my enemies and encouraging me to shoot up some chems.)
---
Hopefully a short inconvenience then
---
Yeah- this sub is flooded with posts relating to it right now lol
---
Submit a ticket and pray to Todd you get someone to look at it who decides to care today.
---
Places that destroy your FPS and set your fans for orbital launch on console will on PC as well. Apparently it has to do with their new lighting system in specific spots in the world (indoors and outside). So far they've fixed *one* spot. The overseer's basement. And admitted it was a lighting issue.
---
nothing. you deal with it and move on. nothing can be done here, and support won‘t even bother with that. just grind the stuff again.
---
Good way of increasing account security, lock everyone out of the game.
---
had the same error message and now it says l, vault-tec engineers are jard at work getting our servers back online (4:6:1000)
---
guess we have another days witha few hours to spare and make anxiety...i might as well try to go outside for a bit
---
Legendary bow
---
Want to like it, but it was sucks
---
F this, back to guns
---
I’d still use a controller on PC; I didn’t like the way Fallout 4 felt using a keyboard even though I use m&amp;kb when I play FPS games like Escape from tarkov, Valorant, CS, Cod, ect. I think it’s just competitive games for me though, or maybe just because I played Fallout games originally on console. I’d probably hook my PC up to my TV to play fallout with a controller, fallout’s always been that kind of game for me lol. 
---
I really just want to know how dramatically improved the pop in time, physics, and FPS are on PC compared to Xbox. I have no idea how to check FPS on a console, but it feels like its around 30-50 which is probably harder for me to deal with now since I have started playing games in 60-140 fps now on my PC, especially after recently playing a modded Fo4 and having that run at over 100fps.
---
If this isn’t the 76 subreddit... than where am I?
---
Nah. They're not even attempting to complete the objectives. They're just chasing the loot. 
---
They don't care if they failed the event and ruin it for everyone else. They got theirs. That's all that matters to them.
---
they don‘t do rollbacks unless a majority of the player base is affected or your entire inventory gets stolen. don‘t give them false hope :/
---
Was working last night but this morning [I'm getting this](https://imgur.com/dXlg94G)
---
I'm sitting on 750 notes so my answer is YES lol
---
I got in on my second try. Ps4. It’s still giving me an error about syncing my friends list, but I just loaded into a map
---
I like the heavy machine guns much better than the rocket launchers.  If you set up a spotlight it makes them more deadly by extending their range too. I usually just put a spot light down and have some turrets pointing the same direction.
---
The sun is out but I can’t bring myself to go outside will have to play a different game.
---
Was down for hours yesterday. So maybe not tbh. Within the day for sure. Super shady though, did they even say why servers where down yesterday?
---
Keep trying. I just got on on ps4. After getting the error first
---
Secret service armor
---
The T65 offers higher damage/energy/radiation resistance, yes. But it cant be legendary, and the secret service armor will allways be legendary. And if you get god rolls, then it will be more usefull, specially with so many perks that dint work with PA
---
I'm getting 2 error codes I'm on Xbox one ,onebi looked up says my accounts banned and flagged for duping and another one is the 4:10:8 code
---
This happened to a bud I was playing with yesterday. Said he did challenges before the down time and didn’t get the points for them.
---
Down for me too, can’t log in on PC.
---
the servers are down...again
---
Thanks, servers are also up again on my end!
---
50% ? Better make it 75% lol
---
Preston Garvey, Bethesda lead IT tech: “We’ve got another server down that needs your attention.”
---
Kinda just along with exchanging for treasury notes you can exchnage for a random weapon or armor. Make it like 20 treasury notes and limit one weapon and armor a day. Itd be good.
---
Imagine if that sub fee wasn't entirely optional...
---
Your on pc?
---
not even a ticket to bethesda or anything? bought the mothman bundle and would like to use the smoke machine
---
That explains why fixers are so good with utter shit recoil lol
---
Except that's not how it worked.  It was teams that would kill you over and over again until you didn't want to play anymore.  People would constantly force you to PVP even when you're just trying to deal with the inventory weight mini-game.  That's not fun and never has been.
---
Where do i submit ticket?
---
Who wouldn't want a happily beeping ED-E clone following them around?  Heck, just having the FO:NV secondary inventory space would be amazing.  Would be very cool if it was a quest reward.  But I'd hate to see them go the ESO route by selling prestige pets in the Atom store.
---
Wtf. Great I’m at work and when I get off again I won’t be able to play. What’s going on now. Guess it’s good I bought last of us 2 for my ps4 but I still wanna get my daily grind on my Xbox for fallout 76
---
Honestly not to bothered about all that because it’s not like like I have to delete anything. It’s honestly more about buying the game again and clearing space on my PC because I don’t have a lot of room lol
---
i feel ya just thinking of going outside im exhausted already
---
I am able to log into my net account on my phone but not able to log into bethesda.net within the game  on Xbox
---
Exactly, it's literally the easiest event to farm
---
It’s back up Im on
---
I mean, I haven't been helped by support yet  but I see posts every now and again from people saying they have been helped.
---
go into the sub, sort posts by new, and you‘ll see that it was already posted. do people still not know how to use reddit? it‘s literally so easy.
---
Well, I did the challanges 10 minutes ago, so it shouldn’t be broken. Other thing is that my launcher has „network issues” since I added MFA and I can barely play F76 because of that.
---
They haven't said anything on Twitter yet but its the same login errors as yesterday.
---
Sometimes its nocturnal
---
What platform are you on? I only use mine for display so I could be able to if your on xbox
---
First time it happened to me I was in whitespring and where the deer spawn I jumped up and hit vats and saw it lock on to a 3 star legendary and I get closer and it’s dead and no loot I was livid but it seems to happen more and more now
---
Guessing the rollout of multi factor authentication is going swimmingly well.
---
It's OK, I'm in now
---
yes, with atom shop refunds. they don‘t do rollbacks for one person who‘s lost some SS armor.
---
Fair enough, I just buy a new drive when I get to that point lol
---
Yes. I also did enable MFA yesterday but no idea if that has anything to do with it.
---
Oh lovely. They need to fix it and then push patch 20 so we can get new shit rolling
---
Shit I just logged off to take a dump!
---
Going to have to check my set up.
---
I get maybe 3 seconds of thrust with SS Jet Pack.
---
Funny enough i had problems with Ultrarcite Jet pack.
---
Looks like someone finally had the balls to say it
---
Im not speaking to the OP who sucks at the game and wants to nerf everything..
---
Im speaking to your notion a sneak build has to be a glass cannon..
---
also.. there is no nice day when the servers are down..
---
Looks like the game is fine, now.
---
 [https://help.bethesda.net/app/incident10](https://help.bethesda.net/app/incident10)
---
Hmmm Im not sure then.
---
Think that is what i will do.
---
Why not both? You already have a set of power armor that's fine,  probably,  so start building your SS armor set.  And then after you get the plans for that you can earn more bullion while you spend your time getting scrip for legendary modules to roll a perfect set of armor and use that to piece together a perfect set of T65 and then you're done with the "build better armor" invisible quest.
---
Passive doesn't stop other players damaging you, it stops you damaging other players.
---
Nvm. Under /new tons of posts saying there are server issues again.
---
“It shouldn’t be broken” is this game’s motto. If it doesn’t get fixed on its own submit a ticket, others and myself have had good luck with the CS team on that end!
---
I have heard that rag doll physics are “shockingly” better on on PC compared to Xbox. They specifically mentioned how much better it looked when laser weapons disintegrated enemies and when bloody mess exploded them. I’m a sucker for little details like that, so that along with the obvious overall FPS boost might make it worth it enough for me to buy the game on steam just to create a character for PC.
---
So your saying the game is optional?  Hmmm
---
It's starting today the same way it went yesterday. Log in servers are down now, which is what crapped out first yesterday. Slowly the in-game servers died afterwards.
---
I seriously think they got DDos'ed or something.
---
It's still happening  today
---
Thats not good but I'm on PS4 rn and there working fine
---
Nothing other than "outage" and "connection issues", and AFAIK they didn't explain why they were absent from the IGN event either.
---
I had zoned into the white springs shops and every robot dropped dead as soon as I loaded in. Only the shop keepers were alive. This was on my private server. Spooked me the hell out!
---
If they're in a team with people it triggers pvp for the whole team.
---
It's already over, at least for the forums.
---
See that’s what I was thinking all last night being everyone of their games was effected and their website but they didnt announce anything. But I think they got that shit done to them
---
Thanks!
---
If you're on PC, dm me your username and you can have mine.
---
Just happened to me. I have shut off my console waited 30 seconds and restarted it. Can play again now
---
Thanks for that.
---
I thought it was just me.
---
Being a Command/Sniper that -1 AP really killed me.
---
VATS is such an important part of my game.
---
Didn't think i would really notice it.
---
Grinding treasury Notes.Doing the same events over,and over, again you do.
---
They're not going to talk about it because it was a DDOS attack.
---
Certain pvpers are upset about the team flagging settings so they're attacking Bethesda.
---

Why is it that the server status on the Bethesda Launcher is more accurate and up-to-date than the Bethesda Status Portal ([https://bethesda.net/en/status](https://bethesda.net/en/status)), given that this is where it sends you for more information? 
---
Frustrating when you are trying to get more information, only to see everything lit up in green with the "All Systems Operational" message. -\_-
---
No, but he's Marty McFly in disguise, so watch out!
---
Think i will leave it as it is in my Stash just in case.
---
Mod another.
---
Hi all, 
---
Yes, we're seeing some login issues and actively investigating. Hang tight, we're working on fixing this asap!
---
Well, if so indeed it's things you mentioned applied - get some pipe guns to mark enemies during events and don't be a dick. And being dick is not exclusive to bloodied, same applied to junkies or just people with "magic" weapons, who flex during events.
---
I know it's not in patch 20 but I really hope they rework the new event because it's just bad and it's not end game content. Last time I did it it was finished in under two minutes.
---
That’s good news. I was never able to use it and always wanted to. Medics with fire rate and my build (crits every 2-3 shots depending on where I’m at health wise) would be awesome if it worked for more than 1 mag before breaking. Lmao

---
"Bethesda servers on fire"--this is fine
---
I don't mind selling mine, but I'm not sure what a fair price to ask for would be...
---
Man, this guy really has a chip on his shoulder. I also don't have Fallout 1st and I agree, I didn't have a single bad fasnacht round, just a lot of other players dropping emotes and marching with funny costumes, and no one ever tries to take my power plant workshop when I'm farming cores either.
---
The problem is that some people are geared for pvp and others are not.  The challenge is not the actual game, it's getting one shot by people who always have the superior gear.  
---
1. Instead of marking exact location there needs to be search circles similar to other quests that show approximate location for people.  This prevents homing in on someone instantly.
---
2. Caps need to be adjusted to lose whatever your level is up to level 76.  Say you are level 20, you get killed you lose 20 caps.  A level 300 would lose 76 caps.  The main reason I quit was that I got tired of losing 400 caps every death.
---
3. If you lost all your inventory no one would play.  This would be a terrible idea.  Getting spawn camped and losing your stuff would make everyone quit.
---
4. Camps should be indestructible with the exception of doors. They would have to make it so that every 4 walled structure had to have a door though. Otherwise people could just wall themselves inside.
---
5. They would need better rewards than double xp.  I don't think many care about it tbh.
---
6. 3 month seasons that make you use a new character would be nice.  No porting over OP weapons and gear.  Make people work for them.
---
have seen this today also for the first time while playing over 200h. went to watoga to do the robot daily and some robots just dropped out dead of their containers. got really confused about that.
---
Older*
---
I've been told that happens when two players of disparate levels enter an area - all the mobs die so new ones can regenerate at an appropriate level. I've also been told that it's a side effect of a shitty internet connection/ overloaded servers- namely those mobs are already dead (killed by someone else) they just don't know it yet so they don't 'die' until you get close enough for the game to care enough to do the math. Regardless, they still 'count' so long as you get a shot off before they keel over so if i see one I 'have' to have I always tag it before it dies of unnatural causes.
---
I literally bought this game 2 days ago and I've barely been able to play
---
*cries since my two shot fatman does literally 1 crit damage to SBQ*
---
Thanks for being able to relate!
---
Can't say for physics. I'm on PC, myself. Only can report on the history of posts I've read between PC and console users with issues in common I've come across.
---
All I know about physics is just the staple of the Gameb-reation engine tying it with FPS. So if your PC can brute force through the bad spots your console can't, the FPS would make the physics perform better.
---
76 it's too much on Steam, can go for it and give it a shot. If you find it wanting, you can request a refund below 2 hours playtime.
---
It's the planned DDOS. It's coming after the confirmed pvp changes.
---
I I didn't know spotlights actually extended the range of turrets I'll definitely punt some, I will also mix turrets ill have some machine guns next to Rocket turrets and see if they are actually better
---
Ya, I think making all gear non-legendary when engaged in pvp would be the way to go.
---
Great change.
---
Bethesda with their heads bolted on for once.
---
I‘m so sick of the suppressed handmade sounds at every event...
---
Noticed an increase in Griefers lately.
---
One attacked me after an event and was struggling to kill me,i was actually getting the better of him with ny bloodied Tesla.Then his mate jumped in.
---
I hate this side of the game,and why i detest PvP.
---
You can be attacked,.......think fuck it.....okay i will fight,then get killed by 2,3 attacking you because they are in a team.
---
The PC community already has exactly what they need/want via mods. Go copy that, implement it wholesale, and if they want to improve things later, sure take your time on that. The very basic feature we're all looking for isn't crazy.
---
Of course, I understand that Bethesda is looking at this likely as a balance issue. If you can swap lockpick perks in and out effortlessly without an ounce of pain, what purpose do those cards really serve? They don't serve any purpose in that state, but to argue they serve a purpose now would also be foolish. 
---
I'm concerned Bethesda, in this one bizarre instance, is allowing perfection to get in the way of functional. They'd be better served by allowing the perk system to be more enjoyable, while unbalanced, until they can figure out a saner way to go about this.
---
😞
---
idk what's going on, I'm getting message that my free trial is expired although I wasn't using free trial
---
Ya, try it out. The hard part is trying to overlap the field of fire and getting set up to shoot things right by your walls. Wish we could get the wall and ceiling turrets.
---
I have a question! Is the spooky looking door pictured in the Mothman Camp set bundle between the two torches, the one with the horizontal glass slats, actually part of this bundle?
---
I was really excited to pick this up, mainly for the fog machine, but when it first launched a few days ago I was short about 120 Atoms. It took me a few days of dailies and some challenges to complete but i managed to finally pick it up last night when he servers opened back up. I can find the build options for everything pictured except for that door and that little Sheepsquatch stuffed animal pictured on the bed. Are they part of this? If so, where in the camp options are they located. That door is not part of the door list. Or is that just false advertising? Thanks!
---
I knew they were going to try crashing servers over last weekend but I thought that was just kind of the end of it. Do you know if there's a discord or something where they're coordinating?
---
Sometimes, ya just gotta break down and use something ballistic.
---
AA or troubleshooters will do so faster.
---
Still going on on Xbox. No more weird error codes, but just "disconnected from server" over and over.
---
People have been having trouble logging in this morning. I just got in, but my atomic shop, atoms, and fallout 1st are still missing.
---
Yep!! Action boy and a few ap refresh pieces are gold.
---
when u buy a recipe or plan, learn it right away. it will save you this bullshit next time, dont let it sit around, with this game you never know when the next pile of shit will fall on us.
---
An Automatron update for 76, of course with Eye Not support, sounds absolutely perfect imo. 
---
So many players want companions and what better way to do that in a lore friendly way than build-your-own robots?
---
You could obviously do nameless mercenaries too but robots sound so much cooler.
---
Don't be so gullible
---
Well i found out, that i already learned plans for that armour. I didn't learn them yesterday, yet the show as learned.  
---
But i can't craft it  
---
I don't have This armor on my crafting table.  
---
Do i need some skills to it actually show up?
---
Source? I've been checking their twitter and haven't seen anything about testing.
---
In the event Riding Shotgun, the dead couriers you find often have combat helmets or black cowboy hats on. Easy way to get a few
---
Same thing here, guess this is part 2 after yesterday
---
im not home right now but i heard its back online already
---
First, try changing the cement floor to the wooden one with the 4 posts using the replace function.   You can get beneath these if the brick is high enough.  
---
Second, add bricks to one side of your bridge so that the bridge is still connected after you remove the offending brick (i.e. routing around the brick that you want to remove).  You should now be able to remove the brick, get your smoke machine, then replace the brick, and remove the spares. 
---
Another option is to be at your camp, move your camp machine around so that your spawn point is close to the offending brick, leave the world, join a new world, then run to the spot as soon as you spawn in and open the camp build menu.  You might be able to beat the CAMP loading and grab the smoke machine.  This is a worst case scenario because it's really hit-and-miss.  
---
Good luck.
---
I was musing about that a few days ago, about what if at character creation there was a moment to give a choice of born before the bombs fell, or born in the Vault. And being given a unique one time perk card based on your choice.
---
That's may actually be the case because i remember there were some enemies around my camp but not this much so ill try rearranging it
---
Considering that most people who play fallout enjoy playing the game, I'd say there would be little to no issues if one or two hateful idiots like you left. lol.
---
I didn't say it's 100% over for everything, I just said that the forum let me log in, which they didn't yesterday nor for a few minutes before.
---
Ya. I have a medics ffr fixer that works great while teamed. If you can talk your pals into getting solar armor you will have insane health regen!
---
Back when bug parts autoscrapped and i still needed badges for Backpack Mods anytime i would travel to the Mire for Stings and things i would have to put a postit on the top of my screen that said "**DONT SCRAP!**" as i scrapped so many of those because of muscle memory.
---
Same on ps4.
---
Same problem. Transfered the game from my Bethesda account to Steam when it released.
---
Hey man, I waited all evening yesterday to play this shit and I saw at 11:58 last night that you guys had gotten it back up and working again. Now I wake up again today and it’s broken again? Get your shit together over there, guys it looking pretty bad right now and it’s certainly not helping your player counts.
---
Same here. I've been playing since the pre-order BETA. When the game came to Steam, I linked my Bethesda account. Now it's saying my "free trial" is over and I need to purchase. I already did.
---
Boooothesda
---
i get the error 4:8:2009 in PC
---
you free trial have finish, buy the game
---
They've killed 76 again...
---
I need tp pay more attention to AP refresh pieces.
---
Quite significant.
---
I need to have a good look at all the Legendary modules on my high tier pieces.I only really pay attention to reductions,damage reduction etc.
---
I'm being told my free trial is over and I need to purchase the game to continue my adventure. Not only have I bought the damn game, but I was the idiot that played 80 bucks for it at launch. What gives?
---
Not to mention all the bugs that will sit the entire 4th of July holiday weekend. Lol
---
seems like i'll just do without the smoke machine
---
Thing is though those “precious” ammo you speak of was more then likely duped or the materials was duped. So in turn they don’t care it’s just they want to see the world burn.
---
That little spring windup and the *ding* when you reload a Fatman.
---
Nevermind that it’s practically useless.
---
I'm wearing it right now with my mothman plushie backpack and a toothy man mask looking like a creeper
---
Apparently it just mashes the two games together, you get to play through fallout 3 with all the new Vegas mechanics and guns, travel between the two wastelands and bring companions and items between them!
---
Having Assaultrons as a kind of protection is cool, if im unsuccessful with my camp i may consider relocating near them because i don't has ve pets or companions to worry about
---
...well i guess its time for me to buy the game after 250 hours of play time, damn
---
It's not you guys, login is borked at the moment. Just wait a while.
---
vault has only been open for a year at this point in the timeline..
---
if my mom got knocked up in the vault 6 years after the bombs fell.. how does the math work out on that?
---
you mean if they are older than 25 dont you?
---
I do mate, still fun.
---
If you want to play FO4, just play FO4.
---
This morning all I get is this: ["The Free Trial Event has ended. Purchase Fallout 76 to continue your adventures in Appalachia and carry on your progress."](https://imgur.com/a/jzhXoDK)
---
. . . . I bought the game on pre-order in 2018 and I'm a Fallout 1st subscriber.
---
Sigh.
---
Same problem. On XBox it has a box to “manage” subscription but after that it’s a dead end. Can’t access private worlds and everything 1st is greyed out.
---
Try routing around the section.  It'll take literally 30 seconds....
---
Honesty, the two weeks something was glitched and, everytime I logged on, robot Rose did her whole "I'll string your entrails up like christmas tinsel" dialogue.
---
She was so obsessed with me.
---
I really like the daily war it fits the Brotherhood of steel camp theme because they where almost always under attack the only problem is constantly repairing stuff
---
Having troubles with the Launcher and not able to run the game (getting all kinds of error/warning messages), but if I run the game directly from the .EXE, I can login through ingame and play fine...
---
They replaced all the engineers with insult bots. They just keep calling the servers names. The servers have decided not to boot up until the verbal harassment has stopped.
---
If your character is older than 25, they absolutely could have been one of the people in the vault.  
---
If your character is younger than 25, they were probably born in the vault.  
---
Bethesda didn't give us any alternate starts in Skyrim, so I doubt they'll give us any in a game where the start actually matters.
---
Nice to the Passive aggressive fucker up,and about.
---
I was concerned he had Narcolepsy.
---
Same here, and my atom shop will not load. On Xbox.
---
It's telling me that the free trial has expired. I'm running through Steam. damnit.
---
Perhaps you are not the sellers target market.
---
Had player vendors been out when I was a much lower level with weak armor/weapons, and I found stimpacks at a reasonable price, yea, I would have bought as many as I could have afforded.
---
I love this idea. Especially allowing people to watch.
---
Why are you posting *todsy* about it?
---
Now I can't even get on a server
---
clearly nobody knows.. inside or out....
---
Nothing, give it away for free
---
I personaly wouldn't be angry at all if i loose all inventory while being killed. You can just craft new gear, aid, ammo. When all would be non-legendary, there is no reason to be angry.
---
And getting spawn camped is imposible with afterspawn protection which we have right now.
---
I like the 3 months season idea.
---
When i was playing FOnline, there was WIPE almost every year. I think they could just wipe all inventories and stashed items linked to Survival mode.
---
Well, at least everyone else is having issues with connectivity. I try to log in after purchasing some Atoms and I get a message saying that the Free Trial Period is over and to buy the game. I ALREADY BOUGHT THE GAME!
---
Playstation button &gt; Options button &gt; Close Application
---
Atm I cant access the atomic shop and I just bought another fo1st sub yesterday and my atoms aren't showing.
---
It's literally impossible for anyone to effectively ddos bethesda or any large company/website's servers. Don't delude yourself.
---
Seems legit
---
I know ... Pew pew pew
---
PS4 Is operational ATM I'm having no problems I did have problems last night though
---
Watoga springs to mind.
---
I dont mind watching a fair fight.
---
Something about an add saying toxic masculinity or some other bullshit.
---
June/30th, uhh! You mean, they have fixed their servers until then? That's cool :-D
---
I mean, I assume the only reason either of us are sorting by new on here is because of that very reason...[technically, its BSG's fault that were fighting...](https://youtu.be/UAeqVGP-GPM?t=25)
---
If you craft something that requires the components of those bears or the tiny robots, it will automatically scrap them from your stash before it takes already scrapped junk. Big dumb. If you put them on display or mark for sale they won't be scrapped.
---
Nah its down right now.
---
One day, just for kicks, they should take off their clown shoes.
---
haha his dick is in her face nice.
---
Ya, AngryTurtle on youtube has a great video on AP refresh.  Also many great vids explaining game mechanics for FO76.  Give it a look and Good luck!
---
So does anyone actually know why the servers are so bad atm then?
---
The servers are fucky today, when they get sorted you will be able to log in, it's happening to everyone.
---
I just logged in and got the ban message, relogged and got in, then relogged again and get the same message as you.
---
They updated the status page . They are cliaming it's more TES LEGENDS problems https://bethesda.net/en/status
---
Ps4 same here
---
I've already roleplayed my character as having an alaternate start, but an actual way to do so in-game would be welcomed. I caanot see it happening however.
---
My character is a Psyker, and the begining Vault sequence, was one of their premonitions.
---
That Sucks.
---
I just got on just restarted my pc
---
Now I am getting a "The Free Trial period has concluded. Purchase Fallout 76 to continue your adventures in Appalachia and carry on your progress." I am a FO1st member. Nice.
---
Thanks, i really didn't care that much for the deposit i was just looking for a good spot in Cranberry Bog and when i found what i thought to be a good spot there was a lead deposit so things where perfect until i found 7 Mirelurk kings in the middle of my camp
---
Mole rats are nesting in the server room.
---
Much appreciated. :-)
---
Is that true? If it is then wow what pathetic little cunts
---
always nice to have a direction for blame.. thx for the heads up
---
It seems all their system is FUBAR currently. Status says all's ok. At the same time my launcher on PC says different things each time I try to log in. It's I am on insecure connection. Or it's simply connection issues. Or Fallout having issues downloading data. Tried to activate 2FA - it denied accepting codes after that, both from authenticator app and sent to phone.  
---
Seems FO76 plague breached its servers and is spread all over.
---
Yea thats why your post got - 6 score. Shows the support for you delusional claims.
---
So that's what Abraxo Scouring is for. Someone inform the bots!
---
It's pvpers ddosing shit so bethesda fixes pvp.
---
Same story here, tried to login hoping to actually play the game I'm paying to subscribe to this morning before work. No luck apparently.
---
Great paid service.
---
Oh really?
---
https://krebsonsecurity.com/category/ddos-for-hire/
---
Pretty much this, a continuation of yesterdays performance it would seem.
---
Why is your status portal such shit?
---
Can you give any more information about what you’re investigating? We got the same spiel last night about you guys “investigating” with no actual comment until you had the gumption to come on here to report “it’s back up guys, sorry for the inconvenience!” Do you actually care about your job or do you just sit on your ass and send emails asking IT when the server will be back up? What the hell is going on over there?
---
This.  My first thought was why should I even care about buffs?  Nothing is difficult enough for me to need more buffs.  Do any of us really need it?  I just want to be able to team up with others for specific tasks.  These types of things just seem like more opportunity for bugs in the game.
---
That’s because people aren’t selling them for caps. They’re trade only, and unless you catch someone trading one for a reasonable amount, people expect BE and legacies lol.
---
Hi all, mentioned this elsewhere but we're aware of some login issues affecting 76 and other Bethesda games again this morning. We're investigating!
---
Damn dudes I've been able to play on ps4 since last night tho there's still lots of lag on the servers I find
---
I wouldn't mind being killed by that trap
---
I must have misread when you mentioned the legendary stuff.  Ya, I agree about losing non legendary gear.  It would be missed so much.
---
Path of Exile has seasons that last 3 or 4 months and afterwards you can port over your "season" character to the regular adventure mode.  I think it would work pretty nice for survival.  The seasons in POE introduce new gear and new mechanics each time that shake up the meta and create a reason to replay older content.
---
What are the rewards for playing though?  Anything tangible that you could port over to adventure?  Otherwise I'm not sure "challenge" is enough of a reason to play for most folks.
---
I am staaacked on treasury notes I’m fine without double of them
---
Heck no..I already have more than 900.
---
Thanks for the reports! We're investigating login issues affecting 76 and a few other Bethesda games again this morning. We'll get it fixed up as soon as possible!
---
can all players earn treasury notes?
---
Thanks for the input!
---
Funny, all they're doing is pushing normal players into getting FO1st so they can play peacefully. Their little war encourages people to spend money on the thing they hate, and then they have even LESS people to PvP with that didnt want to do it anywyas.
---
I'm getting the same thing as well, and I purchased about a month or so ago on Steam
---
Testing verifying the integrity of my Game Files - will report back
---
Thanks for your reports! Yes, we're working to correct some login issues that are affecting Fallout 76 and other Bethesda games again this morning after last night's outages. Hang in there, we'll get you back in-game asap!
---
I would bet money on it. It’s all speculation but they JUST released 2FA and then all their systems died. ESO, 76, Creation Clubs, etc
---
maybe because he has the time TODAY to do it?
---
The jingle of Santa Scortched...

- Whenever I hear a Death Tambo, one of our crew has a Bloodied FSS +1 STR, I immediately go into "squirrel !!!" mode...

You're not alone. They've found new and creative ways to fuck things up.
---
Thanks for letting us know! We're actively looking into this and working on resolving login issues for Fallout 76 and other Bethesda games again today after last night's outages.
---
The servers are down. What more should they tell you, and how will it fix the situation?
---
my guess is servers are hosed again.  Was playing fine earlier this morning.
---
that would not take caps out of circulation.. which is the point of it..
---
Ya i got it April 30th but put alot of time in to it I have over 200 hours xd
---
Np!  I just don't think you should give up on the jetpack.  It's my favorite thing in the game.  I would rather give up all my legendaries and play with vanilla armor and weapons than lose the pack.  It seriously makes my game time so much more fun.  Honestly wish I had went for it with my first gold bullion rather than some other stuff I bought prior.

 &gt; Thanks for letting us know! We're actively looking into this and working on resolving login issues for Fallout 76 and other Bethesda games again today...
---
I'm getting the message that my "trial period is over". I have close to 1900 hours. It was good run while it lasted. :-)
---
shits all borked yo.. its not you
---
Exactly lol I'm sitting on 750
---
Well unless you spend your sweet time farming caps you're not gonna get very many while playing so I still think this is necessary
---
Everyone hang on to your items, you’d have to be insane to try to transfer items between characters right now.
---
What are these clowns doing. Went to bed early because of this issue and it's happening when I wake up still.
---
Me and my partner play this game pretty much daily, but between the lack of endgame, endless grind and technical issues... It is just as you said, exhausting. I'll prolly play some new vegas while she is making huge ass settlements in FO4 and will prolly just wait until update 20 hits just to be disappointed all over again 😁
---
I gotta go to work tho 😢
---
Yesterday there were login problems.  Today there are friends list problems and authorization problems.  They added support for two factor authentication yesterday.  Seems obvious that the 2FA change involved them moving to a new system for user management, and the new system is buggy or overwhelmed by the traffic.
---
I don't usually hate on Bethesda, but at my company and every other competent web company, when we do a switch over like that, we put in a feature flag.  That way when the new stuff doesn't work, we can say "oh shit, switch back to the old stuff!"
---
I have an alt on the bethesda launcher but its lvl 10 and jest stores everything for my main account xd
---
Since myself and many other people are constantly at max caps. Maybe no,
---
We're actively investigating some more login issues this morning that are affecting Fallout 76 and other Bethesda games. If you manage to login you may notice some services like Fallout 1st, social menus, and the Shop are affected. We're working to correct the login issues asap!
---
I think that’s a great idea! But will never happen probably
---
Just saying, we had posts all day yesterday about it. We don't need more.
---
So all the services are down again?
---
Appreciate the response, hope you get if fixed soon.
---
They’ve been down for 2 days. I pay 11.99 on top of full price for a game that can’t even keep up the servers? They told us they’re down but didn’t give a warning or explain what’s happening to as why it’s happening. It’s ridiculous. If you think paying a price for a service then getting this is fine then fool you brother loool
---
The problem for me now is the game isn’t recognizing that I’m a F1st subscriber. So I can’t access private worlds and the option to manage my subscription is a dead end on XBox. Doesn’t even show up as a subscription anymore. Haven’t done a thing to fool with the settings. So maddening!
---
I'm doing a terrible job of locating said Tweet.  Got a link?

---
Bullshit
---
Is that so? Got deathclaw one on my ally, and bought another from players vendor for 50 cap iirc, just to have spare one. I've sold winter one for 100cap in my vendor too. Think only 2 left, but kept those for myself.
---
He’s right, the entire point of the cost of fast travel ( vendor tax and smileys too) is to remove caps from circulation to help control inflation.  It’s not working well, but that’s why it’s there
---
[https://imgur.com/a/jegTeXa](https://imgur.com/a/jegTeXa) 
---
It says: i need to buy the game, grh..
---
But I was promised that PC was the master race :( :( :( 
---
I need to re-evaluate my life now....
---
I sell mothman egg omelets along with whatever excess chems and junk I have on hand for daily caps.. takes about 30 minutes
---
1 trip through pt. pleasant along with the loot and XP clearing the buildings.. try it sometime its a good farm spot
---
Its doing this again to me right now, but the servers were intermittently also just down, and confirmed on the Bethesda website most of yesterday so I'm thinking they are related issues.
---
I've got this issue too but some hiccups are to be expected by a small time indie dev
---
for me is 4:8:2009, says free trial has ended..
---
They servers have been up for the last 12 hours and just went down again a half hour ago. And again, is telling you Joe Shmo from IT is running server traces going to make you feel better?
---
Sounds like a plan, where do you get the recipe for the omelette or is it random drop?
---
I still think that the biggest reward would be that players which like PvP (without waiting time to find a server, without waiting time to other players, without waiting time to finaly spawn) could be in populated world (around 50 players) with same-minded players. It would open possibility of much bigger fight for big player driven factions. 
---
Imagine: 20vs20 on the same server just fighting at posseidon energy plant because all of them need to resupply on fusion cores.
---
Same here
---
How about "If it ain't broke, keep fixing it over and over"
---
the same error, but i buy the game the first day in bethesda.net
---
Hey I said it was working, not working good lol
---
thjs s a graet ieda we arrr diong htis snince hte srvrs wnet dwon!!1 mcuh fun!
---
i say No. too many people are selling stuff at too much of a cost, selling garbage, poor camp design making it hard to find vending machines, etc. id say to ONLY enable this if someone buys something from your camp after they fast travel there within 5 minutes of them arriving.
---
that seems to be the case
---
I think this is happening to everyone. I purchased mine about a month ago also and I am getting the same message.
---
Anyone else see Todd The Liar 3 star legendary spawn on top of the generators?
---
I think he talking about absolute max weight, not the fast travel cutoff weight.
---
Excavator, calibrated shocks, motion assist servos, 15 base strength, I can go up to about 1820 if I have to.
---
“Partial outage” lol, I can’t login. That’s a full outage.
---
This is a good idea tbh, ive been missing new vegas.
---
the servers are down? I just logged in, are you sure mate?
---
Think the servers are hosed again. Verifying did nothing, and a cursory google has returned results that the same thing happened about 2 months ago.
---
Guess it's time to jump on something else for a bit
---
It's working for me now!
---
Been away from Fallout 76 for a year then installed again a week ago. This is good bye again
---
no recipe just pick them up
---
Well you could even just have it turned on before level 50 to help with saving caps and then have it turned off once you reach level 50
---
They were down yesterday. Up today
---
Same dude. I play every day and do the same old grinds for minimal payout, It’s technically feeling like I come home from work to get back to work lol. I was holding on with all my hope thinking they’re adding stuff soon and are possibly working out the daily scrip etc but they’re just not changing anything or listening to anyone. I love the whole fallout series and mostly every Bethesda game but paying for services and not even getting a reason to why stuff like this happens is insane.
---
unpossible
---
What is the max?
---
Nah, people will literally stock up their camps vendor with junk to lure people to their base for easy cap farming.
---
First you cook, then you cook ha! Its nice they fixed the bbq animation :)
---
only those who finished the Wastelanders story line. since why get treasury notes if you have not gotten gold into circulation?
---
Go for it! Don't get me wrong I love 76 and am not here just to whine, it scratches the fallout itch just right. But it might be healthy to take a break at least til the new update 🙂
---
I think they should have equal priority. 
---
However, there should be an option that allows a player to toggle an option to only load into worlds that will allow their CAMP and/or Tent to spawn. 
---
Allowing a CAMP to force out a Tent would potentially lead to a form of trolling or griefing. And what if the Tent player is actively using a function of their tent?
---
The loading control option is a better fix that still avoids interfering with another player’s experience.
---
Oof I'm over here installing it again, its so big  71GB 😩
---
Hmm never thought of that
---
Not very smart right? And just by simply having pacifist mode on, there’s very little they can do to players.
---
Tho if I'm being honest the only time I fast travel to a camp is when I'm looking for ammo or plans
---
They had a mod for Skyrim that made you have different origins and starting points in the game making you non-dragon born.  It was a fun change for sure.
---
It would be cool to be a Raider that was born at Top of the World or a Free Stater originating form one of the Bunkers.
---
Even if it was just one cap. I’d like to get a little cap jingle that says “someone went to your camp”
---
I’d like a “I love your camp” emote. 
---
I would like if bad boys didn’t spawn every time fast traveling to my camp happens.
---
I know.. that was my nice way of saying it was a stupid idea
---
Press/Hold E once, doing it multiple times causes this.
---
Just what I was thinking. Servers are on.
---
They were down yesterday night for some reason. But they are back.
---
Somebody set us up the bomb.
---
Haha I just wish my camp turrets actually shot enemies instead of just sitting there looking pretty
---
I wish they would rotate the menu screen between the three (release, NW and Wastelanders).
---
ive read many times that scarecrows will aggro , but ive never tried since i dont get attacked much where i am.
---
u put a scarecrow away and get ur turrets aiming it, maybe puting more then one up idk...might help a bit to keep the pressure off other things that are more expensive to repair.
---
The servers may have been up for 12 hours. But those 12 hours I was asleep and the times I was awake it was down for 8-9 hours? Not even sure after waiting 3 hours I gave up. You’re one of the fanboys for sure. They’re a triple A company that promised to be more translucent with their fans and have not held up to said promises. A simple explanation to Why the servers are down would be nice.
---
Did with settlers, and helped my friend with raiders. It is personal preference, but we both thought raider side was more fun, due to more interesting team you tag along ( and dialogue ). Take care that if you bring along a friend that finished with raiders, the turrets will be hostile to him/her, which can be annoying.
---
Also dealing with this issue on XBox after recently paying for the years worth. Can get into the game but can't place stuff in my scrapbox or place down my tent because it insists I don't own 1st.
---
I like the idea of more perks for builders and workshops. Maybe it’ll be added on top of other content that may be used when workshops become more valid for turf wars against factions. If they ever make factions really factions.
---
30k.

I’m down for that. I know some people power grind events and aren’t hurting for t notes, but I suspect there are many player like you an me that would appreciate a periodic boost like that.
---
PC same issue steam user.
---
Yeah, we all are in abusive relationship with this game :D I still hella like it, but will keep distance to avoid this whole server breaking shenanigans. I'll just chill to have fresh new look on update 20 whenever that happens.
---
I'd wait an see on that front, hopefully the servers will be okay by then. 
---
With regards to special, all you have to remember is that you get a point to add to a special stat after each level up, for 50 in total by lvl 50. You can add perk cards to each special stat as you level and unlock them. 
---
The system is totally different to fallout 3/4, but works quite well once you get used to it.
---
I highly suggest using https://nukesdragons.com/ to plan out a build in advance so you don't waste special points as you level up.
---
I see what you did there
---
You obviously have a higher opinion of the devs than I do.
---
So when do we get some compensation in terms of 2000 atoms or a double XP weekend &amp; purveyor sales? This is ridiculous
---
I've done this post because i wasn't sure, it's the first time in this subreddit and i've read all those things and i got worried, good to know btw thanks.
---
Ya, it would be fun to have some large scale battles.  But honestly if they nerf everything and all you really do is pvp with everyone, wouldn't it just be easier to create a bunch of new game modes for NW?  I just don't see Bethesda putting in the time to make a decent survival world as much as I hate to say it.
---
The yellow is not so rare and I feel like the forest, although rarer, can be indeed found with a bit of persistance. Over my couple of months of farming for the outfits, I managed to find all of the colors. A fair few yellow too and one forest. Of course no red, so I will have to subject myself to this torture for a bit, I'm afraid.
---
She can’t be crippled atm. It’s a bug.
---
You mean you have to scrap the dedicated server they give you in order to learn the plan to make the dedicated server, but right now its bugged so oh too bad you scrapped it and didn't learn it.  womp womp
---
Online services have outages, that's just the way it is. There was no guarantee of 100% uptime when you bought it. Sucks, but not a lot you can do about it.
---
Thanks! In fact i don't know anything from this new system.
---
Servers have been unstable over the last hour or so. I was just now able to log on.
---
Damn the most I've ever had in 76 was over 8K
---
Lvl 50 and beyond also allows you to move a perk point (instead of picking a perk) from one place to another, so you’re not locked into anything and no pressure early on to commit any one direction.
---
lmfao because he re uploaded all the ones that had them
---
yeah.. its price not prize
---
I can't access FO1st features either, I'm on PS4. My subscription still says active so I'm guessing it's part of the wider "issues".
---
Lol, so they haven't been down for 2 days then. Publicising any potential weakspots in their infrastructure is a bad idea so I wouldn't expect much of an explanation
---
That’s very true lol. I love this game,  it’s my most enjoyed game since new Vegas after all the new updates. Just don’t understand why they can’t fully explain to us what’s happening and why it’s happening. Even before this the sheer amount of glitches that have recently resurfaced is astounding, hopefully patch 20 fixes most of those too. Just want to play again rip
---
Yeah I mean it sucks that its down and I get that you pay the monthly fee, but at this point you're out $0.80.  I mean stuff happens.
---
Ok. They said few weeks between Seasons. Few is usually considered to be 3 or 4, although actual definition is more than one. Few can also be more than four in general use, but I went with average number of 4. Is that enough justification?
---
I got mesmerized reading this. Sounds so good but I’m confused
---
If you are on PC, and happen to have mods installed. Update them. Or if that doesn't work try removing them from your ini file to see if that helps.
---
No problem mate, I'd watch a few vids on youtube just so you have some sort of idea how it all works. It's not hard to get a handle on, but it is different.
---
There is no official option to host your own server, so unless you are an elite hacker who is not concerned with the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, you will have to stick with Bethesda's servers.
---
If you paid the price of a AAA game, then I'm assuming you bought it at launch. 
---
How many other AAA games are you still playing almost 2 years later?
---
gamers
---
Pipe MIRV sounds... dangerous
---
What makes you think this is a AAA game?
---
How much more expensive is a actual bunker compared to fallout 76?
---
A few days ago I found Ward standing at a 45 degree angle in his bed. I wish I had taken a picture of it.

---
Whats the point when you can still only cash in 20 a day.
---
Fatmans in this game are pretty unimpressive for the most part, not many players use them unless they have one with just the right legendary effects, and even then it's more just for fun than function. You're not likely to sell mini-nukes at all and most people you try to give them to won't need them, but you might get lucky and find the occasional player who has a use for them. Most of us just drop them on the ground the moment we get them though.
---
Not much of a fan base for mini nines unfortunately
---
General rule for explosive ammo: it's too heavy and the damage is too weak for anyone to want to use them.
---
Some people like to have fun with them, but, generally missiles, mini-nukes, and 40mm grenades get tossed into a suitcase at the nearest train station.
---
Well practically for one side of the world two days of normal play time it’s been down for yeah. So technically two days of fo1st has been wasted. I wouldn’t expect a full explanation I do understand the situation in that case, but not even a small explanation from a community manager to explain that it won’t be up for the next 24 hours due to a bug etc. Just would be nice to know some info so I don’t have to keep guessing. No one knows what’s truly happened and if it’s something we should be worried about we definitely deserve to know don’t you agree ?
---
I dont wanna start a new character to respec my build from shotguns to rifle. Any chance this will make it happen this update? Literally only reason I'm not playing atm.
---
more often than not mini nukes are a novelty..
---
I dont fuck with them at all.. 
---
just way too heavy for something Im not going to use in and serious manner.. YMMV
---
I'll definitely try that gotta get the plans for them first
---
Be really neat if you could start out as a bot, a raider, a dweller, a settler, a super mutant. Each with a eventually joining story line.
---
You also do not have the hardware to get Fallout 76 running on one of your computers as a server. 
---
On top of that, all you have downloaded and installed is the Fallout 76 Game Client, Bethesda will not give out the Server hosting files required, nor the code they have for the servers.
---
Fallout 1st was their solution to poor server performance, you can pay for a better performing instance (in some cases).
---
Unexpected answer made me LOL! TY!
---
In my experience, its rare for someone to use mini nukes because of their weight and relatively low efficiency. You will occasionally see someone using a Fat Man in the SBQ fight, but thats rare. I would just throw them out if I were you.
---
If the pvpers that are now doxxing bethesda would stop, we'd all be able to play.
---
M8, this is just a cry for attention and a rant honestly.
---
The game has been down for more than a few days sometimes. Then you can get mad. But just because the servers are up when you are asleep and down when you are awake isn't gonna change when Bethesda does their shit. 
---
Beth mostly gives an explanation after as well. Unless its a bigger patch like fixing a dupe glitch, they ain't gonna write that instantly. Have some patience.
---
Besides, I'm online, like full server here with me.
---
Dunno what is going on, but for me it's working.
---
Another difference of note is that the armor drops in 76 compared to past FO games are pretty infrequent, you won’t be grabbing full gear off your corpses. The weapons drop a little more often, so be prepared to craft items with some frequency.
---
Yeah the Nukacrypt guys are awesome for doing what they do, makes doing silo runs a breeze.
---
Congrats on your first nuke.
---
In my time playing (1600+ hrs), I have only ever seen missles/mini-nukes used a couple of times. They are just too heavy, slow and impractical, for most situations, to be of any use.
---
My advice? Dump them in a river and forget they exist.
---
Is this the patch that includes the Brotherhood questline?
---
I was excited to build up wasteland whisper and then realized it's just a camp pet.. I mean shouldn't it follow you around?
---
Not as a general rule, mine all go in the nearest train station suitcase on the off chance someone wants to use 'em.
---
I hold on to mini nukes and missiles until I have 10-15 of each and then just launch them over the lake in front of my camp for some late night entertainment.
---
I also tried selling my mini nukes in my vending machine for very little, and never got any takers. I eventually just started using them in events for fun and to get rid of them. I am level 72, and I have not yet seen anyone using dedicated explosive weapons during an event; I think the ammo weight/damage/fire rate stats are just not good enough compared to other options for people to use them. Having used a gatling gun for a little bit now, which is super cheap to run, I don't blame them. 
---
If it is not too much of a bother to keep em, I would recommend waiting till you get a fat boy and then go to town with them. Otherwise if you really need the space I would not feel too bad about dropping them, they are not super rare and there are some regular spawn areas where you can find more later.
---
Worthless. I only have one turret. Had zero for a while but the enemies were making me go insane. The one turret doesn’t do much. Because the enemies can shoot my camp from way farther away than the turrets detect. Stupid.
---
Can confirm, I met this guy and he really helped me the absolute chad he was pumped out all of my gear and helped me on missions
---
Hitman 2, xcom 2, civ6, csgo. 4 for me.
---
Haha, yes! I can hear her voice in my head, easy on the Psycho there cowboy!
---
The advertising budget and thats about it.
---
Well, a bit more to help you out on those deposits, since I have my 2 mains (in their 40s there, haven't beaten main story, so that might change things.)
---
The north deposit has a mob spawn just west of the lead deposit, mostly super mutants. The fissure spawns randomly, but often level 80 scorchbeasts which are agressive. If it spawns level 50 scorchbeasts, usually they are friendly to me, not immediately hostile. There is a pool of water a short walk north to get dirty waters. Just past that is an event spot that I've only found a downed cargobot with robot defenders in. Just south of deposit is a larger dry riverbed spot that I've seen: it's either empty, or has 2 spots (east side and west side) that will have 2-4 total mysterious quills, or 2-4 combat rifles laying on the ground, or it will have a dead body with a suitcase Misc Quest for a pipe gun.
---
The south deposit is safer, but any time the Fort Defiance events activate, the scorchbeasts will strafe the base, but I've never had it take much damage unless I try to fight and get it to land nearby. North of the deposit is another spot for a downed cargobot random event to happen. Loud noises can attract ghouls from the Antique shop, and southeast of the deposit I've had mostly a random pack of ghouls spawn, but can also be lower level supermutants.
---
I have sold them at 5 caps and 1 cap but even at 1 cap they moved slow so I generally say they are not worth the weight. I liquidate them to people who want to have fun.
---
This article shows where they can generally be found: [https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Mini\_nuke\_(Fallout\_76)](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Mini_nuke_(Fallout_76)).
---
Boo
---
Man, next patch will be another big fucking nothing, more monetization and a new daily chore list inst content.
---
The hardened out damages the 50 receiver but it is cheaper to craft. BTW I am on xbox.
---
I know right? First time i saw here and started talking to her i was done, the behaviour, the trinkets around the eyes, awesome character all around. Also, ave Mothman ;)
---
I'm not having any issues?
---
(Impossible) Make good decisions for the game, and make the community happy
---
I don’t think people still realize after all this time that people want to PvP with the builds and gears they’ve worked to perfect. There’s no point in adding in modes that nerf everything.
---
NW is a thing, so just bring back survival how it was before they nerfed the crap out of it.
---
they screwed up my fallout 1st had to cancel and resubscribe back because it would just keep locking me out of it lol ,but hey it just works lol
---
It's frustrating when weapons break down? It's easy to restore them?
---
I built my camp directly over a mirelurk spawn because I was gonna be God damned before I let some crab mother fuckers stop me from building at what was otherwise A PERFECT location. 
---
Rocket turrets do the trick well but make sure they have a clear line of sight and are protected from melee attacks. Up on the roof on your house is a good way to go. Otherwise you can use tables to prop them up and use guard posts to make a barricade which needs to be torn down before enemies can reach the turrets. 8 rocket turrets should make quick work out of most common spawned enemies
---
Nothing is sacred, fortify anything and everything because enemies will destroy literally anything. My plastic flamingo is on version 37 or something by now
---
Scarecrows are good distractions to lure enemies to a specific area
---
rdr2, d2, this, eso...
---
Oh ok! Thanks!
---
Finally get a day to play and blam goes the servers. Ugh....
---
Meh - I’ve pretty much given up hope on that. Why not get some small salves for the wounds they ain’t gonna fix anyway.
---
Havent been online for three days but have seen many posts about not being able to open game or find world. Someone elaborate please
---
Well well well, if it isn’t the consequences of their actions!
---
I’m not crying for attention I just want info dude. I honestly want someone to answer with what’s happening lol. I’ve dealt with endless bugs after bugs from travelling to trading but it’s just bad now - it’s not only this game, it was many others that I play including doom
---
But they're inert
---
I had this discussion a few weeks ago with some friends. One if my friends said they they might be trying to do something beyond the scope of the mod. Something crazy like making the loadouts have independent special stats. Or something to that effect.
---
You got butthurt because he was only selling stim packs. Got it.
---
That's why I added point 2 and 3.  An arena that makes finding other pvp'ers easier and markers in adventure mode.  
---
I think having some arena styles that nerf certain things would be a nice way to change things up.  Nerfing a tesla jumper spamming quantums isn't necessarily a bad thing if you don't want to pvp someone who uses it.  Heck there could easily be an arena with no nerfs.  Thats the beauty of it.
---
As long as you have the materials to repair them and a handy weapons workbench, repairing is a breeze.
---
Workbenches all over the place and materials are found by looting everything and scraping it into your stash.
---
I already have too many, let me spend my notes for a chance at a 3* legendary, that I could get behind.
---
I make more than 20 a day usually so they only ever go up.
---
Well its around a £1 to me but still. Means they gain an extra pound from me for absolutely nothing ? X that by how many other free pounds they have gained from every other poor soul here. You’re looking at thousands for free.
---
[https://twitter.com/jg93/status/1273957170900619264?s=20](https://twitter.com/jg93/status/1273957170900619264?s=20)
---
It ain't free. Gotta craft em. Idk what is required but if springs are involved, fuck that lol.
---
oh it it, I just wake up and all this server bug almost fix it the stuttering on my end hahahaha, but I'm glad that you get to log in tho
---
I don't need their 14 caps tbh
---
Pvpers are doxing Bethesda? See I didn’t know the info. If they released info on what’s happening it would be nice lol. Thank you for the info dude appreciate it
---
Literally never heard of them until now, lol.
---
Eh I guess I just have other things to worry about.
---
Two options: scrap kits or workbench repair. Scrap kits cost atoms, scrap is free. Save the scrap kits for out in the field and just make sure you collect plenty of junk and scrap it for repair parts. Frustrating early on, but gets better. You’ve got a stash box to hold all of it, and you can use any players you might come across (it will be your stuff when you open them) to help you manage your carry weight. Railroad stations and some other places also have the communal stash box.
---
Alt+F4 would be faster in a rage quit mode
---
That’s also another issue with why no one wants to do it. Unless you have god gear, a million nuka quantum’s, or any of the PC hacked weapons, you’re usually going to be on the losing side of any team that actively tries and prepares to bait people into PvP. The second it becomes an even playing field they get pissy because they can’t just break the game and kill you repeatedly. They might still win, but even a single death will leave them pissed
---
I have 3 places memorized to return for cool junk but I cannot memorize the process of collecting item and not trashing it before it is displayed
---
There are services that go for hundreds of thousands of dollars if not millions that cannot guarantee 100% uptime. Even 99.999% is a standard not all companies can meet. If your expectation is that this service will always be available, you need to learn to manage your expectations.
---
IMO, stuff like Sentinel and Serendipity shouldn't work in PvP, otherwise it becomes nothing more than RNG luck battles.
---
I am not sure of your question. Why would you have to respec from shotgun to rifle?
---
the weapon is fat-man and very few people want the mini nukes.
---
I don’t know why you get downvoted..
---
But it’s good speculation since Bethesda said it will stand 10 weeks for each season with FEW WEEKS break [source ](https://fallout.bethesda.net/ko/article/fPSas0ftnlgD0FcZNnMoL/fallout-76-inside-the-vault-introducing-the-2020-roadmap-and-76-seasons)
---
Preach.
---
https://twitter.com/jg93/status/1273957170900619264?s=19
---
I think XP is the better choice because there is no cap on it.
---
Camp budget increased at 100% completion
---
Does having turrets reduce the frequency of attacks? Cuz I rarely get attacked
---
Completely agree
---
“No one wants to do it”. I don’t think you realize that people can still PvP without god gear and “a million Quantums”. Plus, seeing hacked weapons in PvP really isn’t as common as you think. It’s pretty rare actually. And just because you have a hacked gun does not mean you win. You seem to be one of those people that lumps all PvPers with griefers 🧐
---
Completely agree!
---
The gauss weapon charge and fire noises are very satisfying to me, I also love the noise when super duper activates.
---
It's been happening again. You'll stroll in and just hear a loud "clunk!" echo through the building as a bunch of robots drop dead.
---
Contact Bethesda Support
---
They were very fast and efficient in resolving my problems
---
You're right though.
---
The Wendigo Collosus? I am pretty sure that they said pushed it to rework it and it will not be in patch 20.
---
*Fist bump*
---
That’s kinda stupid. They already nerfed sentinel, and serendipity helps with damage mitigation. Why remove them from PvP?
---
honestly, it would be better as a level 5, that way you could give it to a low level alt and murder wreck your way around the wasteland early when that is in fact the ultimate weapon you can get your hands on.
---
I was thinking the same thing. I was hoping the teams would change some of the events we do normally. Like a team silo run, where the silo itself is a lot harder to take advantage of the team entering. Or, when a team(s) enter a public event, it scales accordingly.
---
I was hoping the Teams was going to be more like the Duty Finder mechanic in other MMO - where you can queue up and look for a group to do a task(s).
---
Yeah most of like as previous fallouts, thank a lot bro.
---
Lol ya I was pretty angry this morning when I was so excited to hop on and play with my friends and Bethesda said hahaha no sir
---
Some solid suggestions. I'm all for more game modes on nuclear winter. I'm also all for adding specific PvP areas or events. In particular the arena in Watoga is a total missed opportunity. They really need to set it up as a PvP and PvE event where people can sign up for gladiator tournaments against each other or waves of mobs. Throw in some unique rewards like the old survival mode ones and some unique cosmetics and it would be a blast.
---
Because there's no skill in having damage negated by RNG.
---
I am not sure. The current roadmap is dated 2020 and has BOS as the 3rd season...but it could change. 🙂
---
Eh Tesla jumpers spamming Quantums at this point aren’t considered PvPers. They’re just a scourge
---
I would love to watch!
---
If any other business ran itself like this, they'd be out of business...
---
Imagine going out to eat and your food hasn't arrived 30 minutes after you ordered it, and your server keeps walking by but never gives you an update on what's taking so long, why, or when your food will be out. Then it finally arrives, but the order is wrong, has to go back to the kitchen, get fixed, and still comes back wrong.
---
Would you ever set foot in that restaurant again?
---
What did he say?
---
Yes. Bethesda definitely scammed you. They took your money, deleted your privileges for playing the game and are fleeing the country.....
---
What a joke people are. I'm not going to take 3 minutes to find out that BGS is having issues across, well, everything right now! I'll just assume I got scammed. 
---
This is why this sub is a joke.
---
There has been speculation that it was 6/30 or 7/7. I for one am happy it is before the holiday!
---
I actually have one of those that I carry with me. Damage with a sneak attack is almost 8000. I never use it because of the ammo weight.
---
The issue isn't that no one wants to do it.  No one likes getting killed over and over by someone who is set up with god tier gear and tons of aid.  Thats whey I posted the ideas I did.  There are ways to even the table and ways to let people pvp the way they want.  
---
Not sure why every post here is getting down voted.  People get so triggered by the those three little letters.
---
You’re welcome! Most fun I’ve ever had playing a FO game, guaranteed you’ll enjoy the experience.
---
It’s a known issue that they are looking into in regards to bows.
---
Magic.
---
So using your logic assassins should be removed from PvP also, as well as Fireproof, Adamantium Skeleton, Dodgy, etc. because that’s all damage mitigation. You make no sense, I can tell you don’t PvP. If you did, you’d know serendipity and sentinel does no make you anywhere near invincible.
---
Exactly!
---
Event: Powering Up Bethesda Servers is popping up like Scorched Earth or Cryptid
---
No, you're making up a bunch of stuff I haven't said at all.
---
I haven't played in a few weeks but Bethesda really needs to get their shit together before they lose even more of their following. I'd hate to see them go under. I honestly think they should drop eso and 76 and just focus on what they do best.
---
I hope so, i've read a lot of review and i've found only bad thing about this game, but i wanted to give it a chance anyway
---
Why are you speaking for everyone? There are people out there that will keep trying to fight no matter what, even if they keep getting destroyed. I was one of those people way back in the day, and I still see people like that. Just because there may be unfair encounters does not mean people will just quit and give up like wimps.
---
welcome to the club
---
Holy crap - my two worlds have just come together.  YOU are my hero.
---
I bumped into the vault wandering around. That doesn't get you in though 😉
---
For early game put a couple of points in luck and take pharma farma. This increases your chance to find meds in the game. This is a good thing. Also. After 50 when you start making your perfect build you'll probably need at least 5 in luck as that is what a build with mutations needs. 
---
Early game scrap every weapon and armor you don't need as you can learn mods from it and also you get valuable scrap. 
---
Junk is king in this game. When you build a camp try and build a camp near a junk pile so you can harvest it. Also buy the collectron from the atom store ASAP as that will also collect junk around your camp. 
---
Melee is OP but doesn't get used as much in late game. Melee is good for one reason. Saves ammo. Always best to carry a back up melee weapon for those lower level enemies.
---
Yea im looking forward to the seasons being added. Not sure how the oublic teams will be , but still interested .
---
But defiantely excited for the colossus event snd the legendary perks when they finally arrive! Ive pretty much completed my SS armor and have the best handgun rolls you can possibly get for a full  life gunslinger build. So not much do do right now.
---
mini nukes are mostly just for the novelty of them, they weigh too much and cause too little damage to be worth anything.
---
Exactly dude... this is pretty much the best way to explain it lol. I would instantly ask for a refund and never look back at that place again for sure. But I’ve held on for so long just to be slapped in the face again... and again. It’s madness at this point, I wonder what’s actually going on in the office ?
---
Thanks man. Where do I get the tshirt?
---
I'd prefer a title: Vault Dweller for a 76er, Wastelander for everyone else.
---
If you're character is pre-wastelanders, you get a bonus OG title.
---
I had my camp just down the road a bit for the longest time, it was south of the fissure in a smallish creek canyon leading out of the lake there.  I saw people camped in the cave quite a bit, but not all of the time.
---
It really is hard to find, I went over there quite a few times and didn't always find it, even though I knew it was there.  I thought about trying to build there, but it's a bit rough, if you're not prepared for the scorchbeast spawns, you will not be happy.
---
It's been a known location since the beginning due to the resources available, but it's a little tough to build in.  I didn't have the patience or the imagination to work it out.
---
Yep I found one right away there just starting the game
---
Exactly! Do you like trying to pvp with those guys?  I don't.  So this is a better way to make pvp more fun, engaging and fair for everyone. Especially people who enjoy it.
---
Mine don't make it anywhere near a train station.  If I see I was given some I immediately open the pip boy and drop them where I'm standing.  If they want quests to give out ammo just give a token or something that you can use at a vending machine to get something you will actually use.

There's a bunch of threads about it but they probably got deleted like yesterday. It came back up and has now crashed again. It was the dev error code
---
Haha I can only imagine someone riding the Grafton monster through Appalachia now
---
Will do.
---
I believe the 95% is the chance of your projectile hitting the target if it stayed still (alternatively if the projectile speed was infinite), so bows are particularly affected as the projectile is slow.
---
There is also a bug where the projectile hits, damage numbers pop up, but enemy health doesn't go down so may be a combination of the two things. 
---
Someone else mentioned a bug specific to bows so there may be more to it than that.
---
Someone's angry about something clearly lol.

Right after I posted this I did something magical

This. We have already been nerfed enough. They'll never be happy no matter how much we get nerfed. *sigh*
---
So cool
---
Me too!
---
For real. It wouldn't be hard to incorporate it's literally a UI thing. Not like it affects anyone else
---
Thanks for the advice, ill definitely put some scarecrows and change my rocket turrets to a safer place there is no way in hell im giving up my location because of those ugly ass Mirelurk kings even if my camp will become a warzone.
---
Excuse me? I hit pretty damn well with my level 35 junkie's handmade and a few stims. It's not my fault y'alls builds are garbage.
---
Not sure what exactly you are "defending" here.  Normally during a discussion people talk to and address other comments.  
---
People do give up on pvp after getting destroyed. Why do you think the mere mention of it gets a post downvoted to hell?
---
Want 15k caps for it? Lol
---
No worries, Sir DaddyTbiccBoi.
---
Again, you shouldn’t try to give opinions on PvP when I’m sure you haven’t done it. You advocate for the removal of a legendary effect and a perk because there’s “no skill”. You make no sense, and answer my question. What about assassins?
---
responding to points:
---
1. i dont pvp much at all, pretty much the rare mercy bounty hunt, but throw in a good infection type mode (settler/raider v. ghouls) and i would play the shit out of that.  if it took a nw aproach to weapons (set damage values, no legendaries)
---
2. id rather them add the new anti-grief system, but throw in a PvP team, that anyone who joins will be tagged for PvP
---
- pvp public teams would allow full damage to/from other pvp public teams at all times
---
3. id add on stuff for PvE players as well, allow us to gamble caps with the winner of the fight getting a cut. (motivation to not throw rounds, or players could bribe to throw rounds etc)
---
NICE!
---
May i suggest that just before you launch your next nuke take a note of some of the players in your world. this is in case the game crashes after you launch. You can then join the same world by finding their name
---
It's actually what I looked for in display once I got out of the vault lol
---
This would be awesome, but also make PA even more useless and unappealing
---
Pip boy colors can be changed on PC using .ini file, no such luck on console though.
---
I've never had the guts to build there, but have always wanted to!
---
And there's often a Supermutant Behemoth that spawns in between the pylon and the town, as well.
---
That's the damn spirit. Good fighting
---
Ahh yeah that's true but walking the wasteland is no easy task lol. Fast travel is a must for late game grinding
---
Uhhhh idk I don't even think about using explosive weapons in 76 because they just don't seem worth the trouble of lugging around all that heavy ammo and weapons, I saw in a juicehead video that some data miners found an ammo conversion Machine that might be added in the future which allows you to trade ammo for points and use the points to buy other ammos, mini nukes and missiles were worth the most points when he showed the list
---
People on Reddit seem to have PTSD and have a melt down when PvP is mentioned. People that have never PvPed will downvote anything involving it. It’s sad, really.
---
I guess it depends on what fun is. Sharing random maps with up to 25 other players at a time, doing group events, certain events that you have zero chance of competing without a handful of other players, a more social and cooperative experience vs being in a world on your own all the time, no guaranteed way to get every special piece of armor or weapon since a lot is random. Those are my positives. Some might hate it. Works for me.
---
Man, don't bite the hand that feeds you :/
---
Thanks, nice tips! I've seen that the most interesting are endurance, luck and intelligence? I could be wrkng btw.
---
I never said it should be "removed", I said it should not work against other players. There is a huge difference.
---
Assassins's effect should be guaranteed instead, as a full set of Assassins armor gives just below the flat reduction of Power Armor, bringing the two play styles roughly on par.
---
It's not a bug it was in the wastlanders patch notes that you can't cripple her anymore
---
*sorts by new*
---
“I’ve been here day one since BETA and endured every majorly bad thing Bethesda has done to this game, but this small minute bug was the final straw for me!!!”
---
This is the pond on the cliff edge, just down the hill from Foundation, isn't it? Has Mirelurks in the pond, a safe, and a dead fisherman on the ledge?
---
That was one of my favorite build locations for a long time...
---
Reward for event completion never given.
---
Well those builds also have downsides too the sneak build has to slow down and the bloodied bois have to choose engagements. If you've ever run either of those builds you'd know that, please play those builds before you complain.
---
  "Another settlement needs our help" was already taken.

---
Lol...that would be great!
---
Hell of a fasnacht drop!  Congrats on that.
---
I never said “removed from the game”. It’s worked that way since the game released, why change it again? Sentinel has already been nerfed. Serendipity is fine how it is. Get over it dude lol
---
I wonder if it is the same thing as logging in to suddenly see 3 BOS copters come crashing to the ground right in front of me.  Happened half a dozen times in the last couple weeks.  Freaks me out.
---
Yeah! All the radio towers have wall turrets! Why can't I?!?
---
Yeah, I stopped using the "Scrap All Junk" after the umpteenth time of loosing cool junk.  It doesn't take very long to go through the list of junk and skip over the stuff you want to keep.
---
Yeah i think that could work for me too, since i was playing fallout 3 i was wondering how it could be a fallout online game. Let's see.
---
Lol nice
---
I agree. Thats why I tried to come up with some creative ideas to make pvp easier to engage for people who love it.  Honestly it's one of the few things in FO76 that actually gets your blood pumping a bit.  Other players are easily the most dangerous enemies in FO76.  We just have to find a way to make it work better for everyone.
---
Draw the bow completely, then VATS, then immediately release. It does seem to be extra reliant on high Perception, in my experience the Gun Fu perk also messed with things. With those two things in mind, I’ve found it to be extremely reliable. 
---
Here’s how it looks in action: https://youtu.be/D4xasEk5yCI
---
DOOM never had any problems for me.
---
Bethesda answers mostly after a patch like this. But it seems to only effect joining people, not people playing already.
---
I'm online for 4h already, and haven't had a single issue with the servers so far.
---
That's what I'm talkin' bout!!
---
Still? Dayum.
---
Nice deflection now that I've answered your question about Assassins.
---
But sure, keep insulting, that's what will help your argument.
---
2nd comment here. I also think you would lose your shit after they nerf bloodied and sneak once you realized that heavy weapons builds are now most effective. The only reason some weapons are useful is as a high damage sneak weapon such as hunting rifles or knives.
---
Just tagged you in a post with the album :)
---
ya it's even better with all the people with stagger perks  borking the animations so she never ever lands ......... after the 6th animation cancel i just settle in for an in air kill
---
Oh thank God!
---
My build killed the Queen with a switchblade solo. Same with the Encryptid while running all 3 pylons. PvP negates that immediately. The amount of damage an enemy does is much lower than the amount of damage a player can do even with it capped at 110. In fair fights between my friends I’ve managed to down a few with a knife a couple times. The fight wasn’t super imbalanced but it also required a full set of Ass Cav to negate the bullets and healing salves. In PA it’s even easier to stay alive since Super Stimpaks take no animation and ive got a metric ton of them. But when I get bored and try to ever so slowly whittle that atom challenge to kill 76 wanted players and shoot a bloodied guy (25% of his health) with a BE pistol with max damage (300+) at point blank range 5 times and his health doesn’t budge (it hit for maybe 20 points of damage), then he jumps, sprays the ground and I die instantly, it’s more than fair enough to say the system isn’t balanced
---
Exactly. I’ve played this game for well over a year now and done everything there is to do, so now I stick with PvP. What sucks is I’ve seen nerf after nerf, and it’s the one thing that’s actually fun with the game now. It’s a shame that others have to ruin it, and people that don’t touch PvP are the loudest when it comes to opinions on how to “fix it”.
---
I got right in, talked to a bunch of folks (including Pita) about what they were doing, etc.
---
Probably because people are dumb. Updates are typically tuesdays and I doubt they would cut off a cycle of weekly challenges otherwise people would obviously complain.
---
What insult?
---
Thanks for brinigng this to my attention. That was an interesting article.
---
I love the Mothman and their cultists in Fallout 76. It was how I discovered them, since I'm not from America, and had no idea it was based on real world myth.
---
well done
---
You did? Didn’t get a notification :(
---
Nice build!   Like how you did the masts.
---
Nope.. sadness is all I get.
---
It's an outage dude, chill
---
☹️
---
My name is Sa1ami and ive never gotten this, weird :/
---
All online services occasionally experience downtime. Really, 76 has been surprisingly good in this regard. I’ve been playing since the beta and this is the first time I’ve ever seen unintended downtime.
---
Come join The Enclave! Lots of PC players, events  and giveaways.  Https://discord.gg/enclave also feel free to add me on 76. JerryKiller
---
Attack, insult, however you want to call it.
---
And keep deflecting.
---
Thanks for taking the time to type this a lot of really helpful info, i wish we had more practical defenses against Scorchedbeasts when we reach an end game build that would be great or maybe they could let us build underground bunkers without glitching.
---
Thank you! That was entirely u/d0ntst0pme 's idea. He's the first person I saw who made good-looking sails!
---
Yeah I can’t sign in to fallout or doom bro. Wish one or the other would work lol lucky you got in before it went down then for sure
---
Will do! This was on a private server. Wanted the first experience all to myself.
---
Thanks. Yeah I was. Should have known Bethesda and their tricks by now. Lol
---
I have not bothered trying yet on PC.. gonna wait a little bit and see how the day plays out..
---
Ill get back to you
---
He wants to but doesn't want to transfer 1 special point at a time (or he isn't level 50 and still doesn't want to put his next points in strength even though he needs to) for some reason.
---
Sounds good
---
Yup. You have to admit that so much of it is broken though and it makes it a lot less fun for people who enjoy it and people who don't.  So many loop holes that exploit non willing participants, and no real way to find people who love the pvp.
---
galaxy brain move
---
Ah, there it is :P
---
Nice work - bit rough around the edges but a good start!
---
I've noticed the bugs with that. There's times where she never lands, and then there's times where she lands 20 times. And I use the stagger perk/tank killer and it never affects her much. I think all the updates have her bugged cause sometimes she stays in the storm attacking ghouls now
---
Much appreciated. I put the finishing touches on it last night when the servers came back up. Glad I got some screenshots before they went down again!
---
It’s Ward. He was going to replace the main power supply but found out it was stolen. He sent someone to get it, but now they can’t get him out of bed to hand it over.
---
I've got pics of most of the Cranberry locations here.
---
[http://bamalmighty.com/fo76-nuka-cranberry](http://bamalmighty.com/fo76-nuka-cranberry)
---
To who, Robot vendors?  I've not sold to them in a while.
---
Yeah, and not sure what will happen when I leave.
---
So imma pray I don't crash randomly.
---
yall are heartless up in here.. lol
---
Haha thank you! It felt good to make a cool camp again
---
Much like the MeToo movement non-consensual sex/pvp is rape/griefing. Also much like many state laws consent can be removed after the act has occurred.
---
Lmao, “he has A thick ass”.
---
There is a really dope movie, too. The Mothman Prophecies with some decent actors in it! You definitely should check it out!
---
😂
---
First off I thought I was pretty chill 2nd it's just another problem thrown on top of everything 3rd maybe you dont care about this game but I do 4th you bring nothing constructive to this post why say anything 5th it's ok for people to be pissed and even more angry than me that they cant play the game they want to because of a lack of caring and work.
---
You want us nerfed over gear we farmed and traded for? Color me surprised.
---
Odd argument? 
---
Someone says with absolute definition that what I have said is not true, while neither of us know for sure what the actual length will be. I question his statement with question and suddenly I'm giving odd arguments. 
---
I did not give an argument, but merely asked how does he know that what I have estimated is not true.
---
About the random number. I did not choose a random number, I made an informed ques from the information we have.
---
They have stated that there will be a few weeks between Seasons and the definition of few is usually considered to be 3 or 4, but the actual true definition is more than one. Also few can be more than 4 also, but I went with the upper end of the general consideration of what is few.
---
Im not sure what you’re on about, how delusional are you?
---
Thank you, I shall.
---
yeah i know but he's pretty far from my camp i don't think he'll ever notice it. you should try it start with a small camp just to test how safe your spot is, there are some places safer than others i picked a really dangerous spot without realizing it but im sure if you look for safe locations in Cranberry Bog you may find some and it's actually fun to have a bit of chaos in your camp from time to time it feels like a true dangerous wasteland where you actually have to worry about creatures killing you in your camp
---
https://youtu.be/8VysHWp6miM
---
I think it's safe to say that you're not meant to be able to do that before the raid.
---
What a way to not double down at all and address the topic of our discussion.
---
I'm impressed.
---
Nope multiple yt'er who parse out 76 and how it works have show multiple times stagger/cripple borks the queen landing post patch, but hey you can go find proof or disproof of it yourself if you want. 
---
There's multiple spawns she aggros on including robots and wendigo and  others.
---
Well for the most part, the only time I've had problems with Scorchedbeasts at these camps is if I shoot them, a level 80 spawns (always aggressive that I've seen) or a high level player comes to my camp and causes some to spawn, which has happened a couple times oddly. You might try building without using turrets and see if they just leave your base alone. I can't imagine they'd do anything but a few random strafes around your base if not aggroed?
---
If Bethesda can just locate that happy middleground between proximity deaths and invincibile enemies we might have a good game on on our hands.
---
You caught me ;P red handed
---
No bulges either apparently.
---
The fuck does WV have confederate statues for? They wouldn't even be a state but for joining the union during the civil war
---
You mean making sneak the meta build
---
People using hacked guns at events does not equal people that PvP. If you actually did PvP you would know that lol. People with trap camps are sad, people that go for workshops are doing nothing wrong, and people who bounty bait aren’t griefers. I bounty bait solo all the time and get good PvP from it. I do it solo and go against people that are solo, or on teams. They choose to fight and aren’t forced into it
---
I mean since all those factions are actually dead in the game, its less like joining and more like investigating what happened to them.
---
Lmao linking to the scam doesn't make you any less stupid
---
&gt;When you die, you won't lose your progress, either.
---
Come on dude
---
oh
---
take photos of crater because its the option you pick when you click thru his dialog real fast without moving the cursor
---
You’re still going on? Jesus my guy get over it lmao!
---
Very nice.  How did you angle the floor boards?
---
I want PvP to make sense and to be a match of skill on a fair ground to all builds (meaning, Power Armor and regular armor), not a "spray-and-pray-he-doesn't-get-the-whole-damage-just-cancelled-by-bullshit-RNG-magic" contest.
---
Sorry to hear you wouldn't be up for the challenge.
---
Yeah it’s recently been changed and updated. Wasn’t showing all these down until about 10 minutes ago maybe a little longer. Rip guess I’ll try last of us 2 lol
---
Makes it difficult to get to some events “in time”
---
Discover a lot more that way. But yea, the constant back and forth from foundation to crater can get tedious, even with speed demon and faster AP regen armor  :)
---
A lack of caring? Lack of work? I presume you have no experience of supporting an application, but if you did you'd know that outages occur from time to time.  These can be mitigated as much as possible but there is always something to go wrong.
---
I care about the game, sure, but this is the first (and second) time I've seen any global outages in the time I've played it. I get your frustrations, but it'll be back up before long I'm sure.
---
Can you buy anything from Regs?  He is who unlocks after completing to purchase armor and stuff.
---
So the legendary perk system is not coming out this patch and it being reworked. The perk loadouts are not coming until at least season 3? 
---
What level are you?
---
EXACTLY! This is why anyone who says but my southern heritage is a joke in my book. That’s because racism runs deep. Most of these statues were erected during the era of Jim Crow segregation.
---
Hell, just going to the bottom right of the map even without nukes to Delta; I've hopped back n forth down there through the day and bagged myself nearly ten 1-3 star scorchbeasts as well just as spawns.. so even without SBQ you can get ALOT of legends for scrip/selling.
---
I'd love a 1911 and an m1 garand.. \*PING\~\*
---
I agree with you.  I didn’t describe it completely accurately but you detailed well how grieving in PVP is different but possibly expected whereas grieving “into” PvP is a nuisance.
---
Idk, I never take that perk Off and it never affects her landing for me. Same with people talking about survival tents etc. There's just times she's doesn't land, and then there's time she lands a fuck ton. And I'm always loading her up with bullets as well. Maybe it only sometimes affects her, and then sometimes on other servers it doesn't?
---
They're actually the angled roof pieces. You have to snap them to the big angled wall pieces and then you can just keep snapping them together.
---
Not to mention how easy non-SBQ scorchbeasts are to kill by yourself
---
Oh ok
---
Only benefits players that have reached that point in end game.  
---
For players that have not, then there would be no incentive to spend extra time in game.
---
I think it tops out for buying at 20 charisma, and selling 25?
---
I can't remember off the top of my head
---
Because I have 15 points in strenght and would like 15 points into something else instead, so I have to swap the cards. And for that, I have to level up, and I kind of want to use my level ups to get the rifle cards, not to swap the traits. And I'm above level 100 already. I would like to play on my main character, just simply change my build a bit. Only game out there atm without a proper respec system.
---
This machine from new vegas? 🤤
---
Also I'm open to any feedback you have, my wise mentor haha.
---
I forget the name but he said some organised group were DDOSing betheada because they were unhappy with some recent changes they made
---
I'm level 105 I think. I have 15 points into strenght atm, doing shotgun build but I want rifle. I want to use my level up to get rifle cards, not to swap 1 strenght for charisma or something.
---
fucking A bro. if i have to do my fucking dailies gold and scrip at midnight again, im going to be pissed. this is ridiculous.
---
Working for me in PS4!
---
are you talking about stealth builds.. or bloodied/junkie builds that crouch for extra damage..?
---
IMO there is a difference..
---
THIS MACHINE KILLS COMMIES!
---
There are definitely no other respec options rn.
---
Why not model it after a 2011 and keep the capacity at 16?
---
That sounds right.
---
Okay, that’s pretty good to know. Do things like Hard Bargain and Grape Mentats stack on top of that?
---
That is the only reason I'm not playing.
---
To add on to this, the Confederacy lasted only five years. There is no “heritage” in a small age of standing FOR slavery. But really matters is mothman statues!
---
Hah, came here to say this. So many times I meant to take pics of foundation but accidentally speed clicked crater.
---
If you do Crater you always seem to need a picture of Meg which requires another loading screen. Lol
---
Blackwater mine - National Isolated Radio Array - West Tek - Huntersville - Freak Show - Fort Defiance - Monorail Elevator - Lucky Hole Mine then Watoga Station is my route I farm when looking for legendaries and junk/lead. I'll also hop between the BOS fissure sites for ballistics fiber and more legendaries if I feel like killing big bats.
---
Does anyone actually use pistols? Being their damage perks are in AGL, I honestly thought no one would ever use them.
---
Sounds like they're getting hacked. All day yesterday, then it was fixed. Now they moved onto something more vulnerable.
---
BEAUTIFUL BOI JUST BEAUTIFUL!
---
I can show ya how its done son, on  you ps4? My gunslinger holds his own.
---
Edit: not in PVP context lol. I Never really do pvp
---
that group is pc only
---
Yep exactly
---
Max Hard Bargain counts as +9 Charisma. But the buy and sell prices cap out at a certain amount of charisma. So like, if selling's max discount is at 25 char, and you have 25 char, throwing on Hard Bargain or using Mentats won't do anything.
---
I also grew up in the south! There is so much more here to be proud of. Granted the majority of it was because of Black people. I.e, bbq, southern soul food, whiskey (seriouslyJack Daniels stoke that shit!) so that wouldn’t jive well with these jokers.
---
If you send them a link to the sub, itll take them to the desktop site which prompts them to join/login. Theres no formal invitation option that I'm aware of though.
---
shoot them in the face.. thats what I did
---
Cause 45 kills doesnt just kill, it takes the soul too
---
Is U.20 just the group feature or is that when the S.C.O.R.E. seasons start?
---
Wait. Why does WV have confederate statues? The whole reason WV exists is because they split from VA because they didn’t want to be part of the confederate.
---
Either way, Praise be to Mothman!
---
Right, gotcha. So absolutely maxing charisma like I planned isn’t that useful then?
---
I'll summarize the week how i expect it to go:
---
* 6/29 super excited
---
* 6/30 still excited, somethings differ than id imagine
---
* 7/1 still excited, start to notice the grind RNG, but still very excited
---
* 7/2 vendors and display cases taken offline, duping is back
---
* 7/3 reddit posts start popping up. realization of grind is abhorrent. bugs that are fixed are made worse, more bugs are reintroduced
---
* 7/4 my fucking water wheel is still broken??
---
* 7/5 fallout teams are disabled, people find some overpowered exploit involving them
---
* 7/6 *bethesda says nothing*
---
* 7/7 subreddit in full force against Bethesda. Vendors still offline, will be fixed next bug fixing patch
---
..............................................
---
* 7/30 next bug fix patch is here, vendors finally back online, 30 more bugs are reintroduced
---
I am. I do have a few pistols tucked away and an extra character slot, maybe it’s time for me to make a gunslinger. I’ll be on this weekend.
---
specifically the stealth builds 
---
the bloodied build just synergies well for extra damage but specifically I'm talking about non bloodied.
---
No because then Bethesda will nerf it to oblivion
---
Login issues are being resolved across Bethesda's games, and you should be able to access Fallout 76 again. Thank you!
---
Well you usually try to have max in whatever weapon you want to specialize in. 
---
So if it's shotgun or melee you want str and rifles is perception etc 
---
if you're gonna be a sneaky sniper you don't need any or much in endurance. if you're going shotgun and/or melee you want quite a bit of endurance. As someone mentioned you can move points around and pick a specific perk card after 50 so if your build is a mess you can fix it.
---
I love me a good Full Health Sneaky Vats-Crit build.. right on!
---
Commando sneak needs a nerf anyway and with one wastelanders hopefully they do it makes other builds no where as effective or efficient and before you say omg go run a commando build I have one and it is over powered.
---
Services are being restored now and you should be able to access Fallout 76 and other Bethesda games again. Thanks for your patience!
---
Hit me up psn is Midroad-, busy- ish weekend but usually onafter 8pm Us east
---
No prob. I panicked a bit as well first time I encountered it lol
---
Pretty short grace period. If you aren't a 1st member, I've seen people booted out after a few seconds of server owner leaving.
---
Looks great. Makes me want to redo mine!
---
I don’t see it in the patch notes and a Bethesda employee responded her and said it was a big.
---
Here’s the Wastelanders patch notes: https://bethesda.net/en/article/2asdca6YRz43ctgyo0o2d3/fallout-76-wastelanders-update-notes-april-14-2020
---
Yeah I just checked on the wiki and the buying modifier caps at 25 with a modifier of 1.75 (compared to 2.5 at 1 charisma) and the selling modifier caps at 0.25 at 20 charisma (compared to 0.1 modifier at 1 charisma)
---
Services are being restored for Bethesda games now, and you should be able to log back into Fallout 76. Thanks for hanging in there today!
---
if youre a junkie build or weapon flipper and its max level.. yeah
---
Will do, Psn is same as here.
---
&gt;     7/7 subreddit in full force against Bethesda. Vendors still offline, will be fixed next bug fixing patch
---
&gt;     7/30 next bug fix patch is here, vendors finally back online, 30 more bugs are reintroduced
---
its funny because that same scenario has already happened
---
My ign is nukacolariley. Be warned I spend most of my time doing PvP but I can always hook you up with whatever ammo and aid you may be in need of. 👍
---
Well worded.  To be honest, the ultimate PVP move in that kind of world is when Bethesda one shotted the PVP server.  Which, I can laugh when I say that, but I don’t wish to get rid of PvP for those that enjoy it of course.  I want everyone to be able to have their fun and their were a lot of great PVP players in the game.  It really was a small minority that just ruined it in my opinion.
---
We're now restoring services that were affected and you should be able to log into Fallout 76 and other Bethesda games again. Thanks for your patience!
---
depends on the level, and other prefixes
---
Was there supposed to be an IGN event? You mean the PC Gaming show?
---
Ooo pics?
---
Services are coming back online and you should be able to log into Fallout 76 and other Bethesda games now.
---
I’d like to see a Glock 17 or 19
---
Lvl 50 1 Star
---
level has nothing to do with it.. 
---
there are assholes at every level of the game and many people playing alt/mule accounts..
---
Ah-hah, I had it backwards haha  
---
Thank you for finding out.
---
Wishing I hadn't wasted that 100 dollars now.
---
So you are saying: Play sneak or f off.
---
Well then I'll gladly f off.
---
This is basically just a d*ck measuring contest on a more childish scale. 
---
Yes we get it, you people are AMAZING with your 20k damage.
---
But no one cares... literally. No. One. Cares. That you can do that much damage with your corner sitting build.
---
I'd rather run around and have the game be a little bit of a risk at least. Because its you kind of people that then sit around and say: "it's boring".
---
Yeah it's boring when you one shot everything and have no risk of dying if you play smart. 
---
You know why bloodied builds use stealth?
---
Because without stealth you would be fried toast. 
---
And that's ok.
---
But don't go fucking posing just because of some shit like this thinking you are our god aight?
---
Junkies is a pretty desired prefix. If you're a heavy weapon junkies player then that's a fair price. Sounds like that's the base cap price of the weapon anyhow, so you could always sell it to a vendor to recoup a decent bit of cost.
---
Stop confusing Zoomers.
---
it could be a good starting point for playing around with junkies heavy weapons. do not forget power user to make your fusion cores last longer.
---
If you move you're camp slightly, like an inch, it will store everything you put down. It will also blueprint your buildings so you should be able to lay most of it straight  back down.
---
That would be cool too. Maybe use 38 ammo since 9mm hasnt been addrd?
---
Because player vs player does not imply equity of skill or even gear, but does imply some sentiment of chance.  Even if you were horrible at Call of Duty, after a couple of games you would kill someone.  When you never have a chance, it’s not PvP.  If they want to kill enemies with no chance why don’t they just play PVE?
---
Facts. As someone from philly, jawn is half the words spoken. Living in the NE for school, people always question me on it. Jawn is like when people say “check that joint out” it’s literally a nount meaning anything. 
---
If you have you a main chick, then you got your side jawn. 
---
This jawn got me fucked up.
---
Yo lemme see that jawn.
---
Etcetc!
---
Ok, thank you.
---
The Lying Lowe series of quests that you start by reading the sheepsquatch poster at a train station.
---
If you will use it, then yes it was worth it. Its a great gun to start if you're playing a junkies heavy. If you won't, then it wasn't. Since unless you're starting out it'd be scrip for most people and it won't sell for much more than you bought it
---
Any news on Atomic Shop and Fallout 1st functions?
---
VATs has been broken since WL dropped.
---
Just for venders? mm.. I donno, that's up to you.
---
My charisma I left at 5 to have Lone Wanderer and Travel Agent on at all times and just swap in Hard Bargain and use mentats at a vender.
---
Yea like .380 unless they added 9mm
---
I still have to send myself a friend request in order to see what friend requests I have received.
---
As I said I am new. This was my first bad experience and it was due to Higher leveled players. Before I got Fallout 1st another noob who was more informed than me gave me items and showed me how to get Power Armor. That was one good interaction, but this bad one really turned me away from the community.
---
btw with the weapon displays and broadsiders you can make some excellent canons for your pirate ship!
---
Yep... gotta have a reservation lol.
---

https://youtu.be/3jmdEjqGMk4
---
Wait, wait, wait, wait, grinding for what?
---
I'm not a big fan of the inside-out look, but I assume you did that on purpose. I tried that once on a different ship, in order to use wallpapers to give it any color I wanted, but they all looked way too flat compared to the barn or contemporary walls for example. I guess it COULD work with the right wallpaper, but I haven't found one yet.
---
I also think the quarters look kinda cramped - maybe try to rearrange stuff a bit or even make the room longer. 1x3 is pretty dang small :P
---
Also the sails look tiny compared to the rest of the ship. I found it pays off to make "furled" sails like I did here [https://imgur.com/a/g6oT1TY](https://imgur.com/a/g6oT1TY)  
---
They don't take as much budget as full ones but still look good enough. Plus, your ship is anchored anyway, so unfurled sails are not a requirement.
---
But don't let me harsh your style too much - you do you ;)
---
EDIT: Oh and if you can spare the budget put a name on your vessel, Sailor!
---
It's part of the rotation, so it comes when it comes. Not triggerable anymore.
---
What about the Hunter/hunted PvP event in adventure mode
---
And this is why the brother hood of steel didn’t last long in Appalachia.
---
This just ain't the game for that. I don't know if it ever should be, either.
---
Lol I made that comment on your YouTube video lol
---
I've seen it called "IGN Summer of Gaming" on this subreddit, so that should be the one.
---
Yeah I can’t log in either :(
---
just saying.. its foolish to make assumptions based on level alone..
---
GL out there yo..
---
I get the same error when trying to login via steam. Tried through the Beth launcher and doesn’t even do anything. Oh also am F01! I def unsubscribed from that lol
---
It is teams and S.C.O.R.E.
---
Games got a 99% up time
---
Yes sir! You can see the displays in one of the screenshots. I'm on the lookout for some 90% WWR ones.
---
apparently it is not widely known..
---
That looks neat as hell :)
---
Probably to unlock tiers on their season pass
---
Lol how does it even trigger? Is it just by players joining the hunter/hunted radio?
---
Yes I know is not in patch 20. No idea what are they going to do but it was too easy and not worth doing it
---
Nothing is easier than Grafton Day. No waves of enemies, no additional steps, just kill a single level 30 grafton monster and get rewards.
---
thing is that my camp is under an actual bridge in the forest
---
Damn they must be racist, I eat there every Friday night
---
Can someone please translate stupid for me ☝️
---
He has really bad vertigo and can’t watch any video that’s unstable or has a lot of movement without it making him feel dizzy/nauseous. He wishes he could play more, but he’s always supportive of my playing and often comes home with surprise games or encourages me to make time to play because he knows I use that as my down time. He usually just hangs out in the room and plays guitar (his hobby) while I play. It works really well for both of us. But I do sometimes wish he could hop in and give me a hand!
---
yeah.. turn on the radio station
---
Also, how is text chat not baked-in on PC? Fucking bananas.
---
Currently at 75% budget so that's not a problem. Yeah, I like the dark wood look, feels more realistic for ship timber. I did notice your furled sails on the larger  vessel album. I might try that tonight to see how it looks. I scaled up the sails twice during my build and could never get a good feel for how big they should be, so you're probably right. I honestly like the cramped look for a cabin, as it makes more sense. It looks a lot smaller in the pics though, I think it's the angles I used. If I could find a way to get the crafting benches to look good below deck, I'd probably make that entire space living quarters and spread it out more.
---
Looks like you’ve incorporated an existing  structure in your camp build. Where is that and if you’re on PlayStation May I visit?
---
Thanks guys!  Good work!
---
Yes! Agreed!
---
Perhaps you should lower your expectations and be a little more cautious? You’ll come across lots of different types of players, good and bad. 
---
They did kinda tell you what you were in for so..not sure why you thought it would be a good idea to allow high levels to farm you, even if they said they’d give you presents.
---
I never specified build I was talking in terms of rifleman not commando, the DPS on a commando sneak is insane, I think an appropriate nerf would be lowering the damage to a level where it is on par with other builds DPS wise.
---
What you're describing is basically the dual mode from Borderlands but meh i dont think its necessary pvp in this game is kind of shit for one and useless coz they have a battle royale for PVP and 2 there are thousands of PVP games out there that are made to do pvp fallout isnt and shouldn't be where you go to have that PVP experience there should always be the option to fight other players but it should never be a major focus
---
You honestly might be better off trying to trade for them in a market group. I myself wouldn't loan out the rare stuff to people off the internet. (no offense)
---
Being in a  “hidden” or “caution” state is the only mechanism that delivers a stealth damage benefit.....and you can only do that whilst crouched - this gives the x2.5+ damage multiplier. Anybody crouching is attempting to use stealth...
---
How “stealthy” you are dictates how likely you are to be in one of those states. You can achieve high stealth by a number of mechanism, including stealth / covert ops perks, sneak / chameleon effects on armor and guns, chameleon mutation (permanent sneak buff even when not invisible), and high agility. You don’t have to do all of these things either to be successful. V. High agility could mean that you can get away without using certain stealth perks for example. 
---
Junkies and Bloodied builds have their own health / Chems related bonuses, but none of that is incompatible with being stealthy as well. You can, and should be doing both to maximise your damage.
---
there have definitely been worse suggestions..
---
That is a server wide mini game. What I am suggesting is something that is more focused and downscaled.
---
I think a mini game CAMP item would get way more visibility and activity than the hunter/hunted PVP event.
---
I think you will find it easier to adjust your expectations than force the world to change for you 🙂
---
Compared to a lot of other games you get a lot more bang for the buck with Fo76. Metro cost the same and took 30 hours to complete .. this game you can easily play for 300.
---
But we always hanging tight D:
---
not half bad, as legendary rippers are legacy
---
I did! I built my camp at the Raider Windmill north of Grafton. I'll send you my PS4 username, I should play tonight around 10PM ET
---
Too many cheaters on pc
---
On a side note I just went there and learned something horrible about this place that I don't wanna spoil for you if you don't already know about it
---
Wait this is happening to you all the time? I rarely encountered them when I was levels between 1 and 50.  From where your kneeling seems to be an 18 carat run of bad luck.
---
God yes bring back the .45 pistol. I want my light in shining darkness back. Honestly give us a bunch of new vegas items while we are at it. Let us dress up as burned man or even get legion armor. Add the anti material rifle and the carbine as well
---
Otherwise known as "playing the game".
---
So they leveled up by attacking us too?
---
I think your build and play style is the big factor. Personally, I started with T65 build because it is the quickest to complete. Don’t have to hassle legendary modules. My RNG luck is terrible, so I anticipate it will take a long time for me to get a good set of SS armor. If I don’t have to deal with a RNG slot machine to get something good in the game, that’s a good day in Appalachia for me.
---
True. I just expect more from anyone over Lvl 100.
---
But MUH HeRitaGE
---
Thanks, man. I’ve just been hearing a lot of complaints lately from PA users concerning the legendary perks and how they’re worried that PA is becoming obsolete and even laughable.
---
Notice how I am not downvoting any comments lol.
---
Yeah, crafting benches below deck is something I never managed, due to the slanted roofs. Only cooking stations down there.
---
But do try the sails like on the three-master.
---
Rule of thumb: even if they are a bit too big they‘ll still look better than if they are too small ;)
---
At it's heart Bethesda games have been Role Playing Games.
---
Fallout happens to have added in the shooter part but we know that it's a hybrid shooter/time stop tactical (VATS) game. This was the crossover from the Fallout 1&amp;2 style combat into Fallout 3, 3.5, &amp; 4 style.
---
Fallout 76 tries to mush an online/mmo style game with the offline experience we all know. But there is still that expectation that you are playing a *character* not a combat *build*. So there is a resistance to just changing a character that was a melee all his/her life (100 levels) to a sniper autorifle character over night.
---
The fact that Bethesda put in a system to change SPECIAL at all is amazing. They didn't for FO4? I can't recall if that was an option for NV or FO3 but probably not.
---
I know this doesn't help your issue, I'm just attempting to add some perspective on the subject.
---
It does only affect her sometimes, but it's those perks proc'ing during the animations etc etc so it the right perks going off at the right time to bork the landing the more people running it the greater the chances, but it is repeatable but it's not consistent due to having to have the stagger or cripple proc happen.
---
You don't really need more AP at this point, since with bloodied weapon you basically oneshot most of enemies. Invisibility also gives you 100% stealth. SPECIAL aren't really that special in 76
---
Since servers are so limited in size I considered the best place to find consistent players was via a discord server search but I never followed through on it because there were so many roles and stuff to choose before being placed in a group by admins so it just seemed like too much work to get connected.  When the matchmaking utility comes out I’m hoping that will make grouping easier.
---
so there is no such thing as a stealth build.. gotcha.. thanks for the info
---
Completely understandable, that's why I'm offering some serious securities. The problem with trading is, that I need to give away stuff I rather want to keep :'D
---
This was something i remember discussing at length when survival was coming out, and something they entirely ignored. 
---
We said the mode could be fun if they forced clean slate characters only into it to avoid op armor and weapon builds to come in at the start and kill everyone else, which would destroy it as a gamemode since assassins sentinels at that time was unnerfed and basically gave you immunity to other players while not being staggered.
---
They didnt listen, the gamemode died as everyone thought it would and people moved on
---
No community in any game ever made is perfect and of course it will have trolls. It's getting pretty annoying seeing how many people every day complain about PvP at workshops though. It specifically tells you when you take it that you are engaging in PvP, you should not be surprised if someone comes and kills you. Just don't take workshops, they are not an essential part of the game whatsoever.
---
Wastelanders is essentially single-player content.
---
lol this reminds me of that Tyler, the Creator tweet where he said something like "how is cyberbullying a thing?? like, just walk away from the screen or close your eyes!"
---
Looks good
---
More like...
---
Day 1: OMG Look at all the cool stuff we can unlock over this season!
---
Day 2: WTF WHY HAVEN'T I UNLOCKED EVERYTHING YET THIS IS SHIT 1ST IS A SCAM I WANT FREE QUADRUPLE EXP WEEKENDS FOR THE NEXT MONTH
---
Because everything they release is broken. 💁🏿‍♂️
---
Pc is toxic, community is on consoles. Also public teams coming soon so you'll have people to party with. But yeah no experience on PC lol good luck
---
It seems to be random. I guess it depends on whether or not a player has activated it recently or not?
---
I've never tried it on a Private server, so might have more luck there.
---
Trust your instinct: testing weapons on other people is never a good sign, in the game or in real life. :) 
---
Your miles may vary, but 90% of people are nice to each other, whatever the level is. I just refuse all invitations of joining a team as my play style is solo oriented.
---
I consider the first month after a major update as a time when the live server simply become beta test servers.
---
This is just a suggestion. Before you downvote me, contribute to the conversation. I’m just looking out for PA users. I’m not a PA user myself. Give me credit, smh...
---
I feel like there is some content or context left out here... is this a pro-sneak build post, or anti non-sneak build post?
---
Regardless, sneak has offensive and defensive attributes that can be enjoyed by any build type (melee, heavy, commando, shovel, whatever). I like it, I use it, it's fun to bumble around with a 50 cal or a combat knife and not be seen by the baddies that are literally standing on top of you.
---
To each their own build, it's a journey to figure out what works best for your individual play style. Have fun!
---
I don't disagree
---
I've read the different ways you've said this and just can't seem to understand the problem.
---
I'm level 121 on main character.
---
I can go out fully carded for Rifle, Archer, Heavy Gun, Melee or Shotgun.
---
All I do is swap what cards are equipped. It costs 0 points to change what cards I'm using.
---
What are you needing to, Respec?
---
No, there is, it’s just that pretty much any type of build could be adapted to use it assuming you could invest enough in agility - the main buff comes from spending 3-4 perk cards there.
---
There’s rails for the pump shotgun, a Grenade Clip for Gauss Pistols, Lobbers for Tesla’s (granted these have a small chance of spawning attached to the gun), and more. There was a list of items a while back of mods that exist that we can’t use, yet Bethesda happily uses them in their ATX
---
Gatling laser caps at lvl45... if its lvl50, then thats a hacked weapon.
---
It’s part of a larger project I was thinking of doing on an alt that would be a kind of community caravan sort of thing. One part of the idea was to have people pay me to buy things for them from vendors at the lowest price possible to help save them caps
---
I noticed this as well a while ago! Took a few times before I was sure it was really the same.
---
Love it. Great idea
---
PA is the easiest way to play the game.. theyve got nothing to complain about.. lol
---
They should be back online now!
---
Absolutely I get that no community is perfect, but this is the only game I've ever played that I see people constantly talking about how amazing the community is, in such stark contrast to my experience. 
---
As far as workshops not being essential, I was just trying to farm some junk and all my shit is broken. Wasn't sure what recourse I had for easy farming otherwise. Most online guides I've seen for this game are not useful or too dated. I guess I'll steer clear of workshops in the future.
---
Man, those were the days!
---
great idea. 15 people all using nukes in an already choppy AF area.
---
It was mainly pro sneak and yes I think it is definitely more of a modifier to builds rather than a base.
---
Unless you pay money you can’t just hop into a private world to escape players
---
Yes, we're obviously skipping both summer and fall for the quest content clearly labeled winter on the roadmap. /s
---
I did pay money, but like I said I'm not here to play by myself.
---
People around 100-200 are where the majority of these asshats are. If you see players above that, they tend to be much more kind. Of course that doesn’t mean you cant find a nice lvl 126 guy. Thats how i’ve experienced it
---
I just got an idea. It might require me to scrap half my ship though. If I replace one of the foundations in the middle-stern area (right at the entrance to the aft holds), with a ramp, then it'd be level with the horizontal roof "shelves." I could keep the other foundations at water level and just build the flat roof over them to make a seamless floor that's 3 tiles wide. Only problem would be the low ceiling, I'd have to raise that part of the upper deck.
---
I just realized it wasn’t in the game...
---
I play on Xbox and have only come across a griefer once, the community has always been overwhelmingly friendly. I'm sure this was just one of those rare negative experiences, you should be fine.
---
If you're looking for players it might be worth joining the discord, or Facebook groups etc. At least you know they are people that actually want to play the game.
---
I agree, but it’s still a concern, and given that the legendary perks provide non-PA users with a huge boost the concern has been why even use PA anymore.
---
You don’t get XP from pvp’ing in adventure or private.
---
I'm in SWPA, and people here do it too. I see stars and bars pretty regularly, luckily no statues
---
That’s a great way to generalize an entire people by a vocal few. Kinda like saying literally the same thing about console players based solely on CoD back in the MW2 days.
---
Yeeeeeeaaaaah baaaaaaby
---
I have the problem with the first VATS shot with my two-shot .44 and even worse on my gauss rifle. Cross fingers that it will solved soon.
---
Not to swap the cards, but the amount of attributes. For example, atm I have 15 points into strenght. But I theorycrafted a build I would like to try out from nukes and dragons build planner, and decided I now want 15 points into perception instead. My current build have almost no points there, so I would have to level up 15 times just to get my points over there, or am I wrong?
---
They're probably gonna charge atoms to change colors.
---
Hello Deep Squid, I am looking for people to play with and would love to team up with you--I am happy questing, exploring, whatever, and can provide some of those basic resources you mentioned to get you out of some of those grinds. Add me (TheMadChem1st) if you are interested!
---
nah nah nah.. youre right..
---
Ive been thinking about it all wrong..  my build is a Vats-Crit build.. not a stealth build...
---
thanks for the info
---
Check to make sure your BethsdaLauncher.exe is in the allowed apps for your firewall. may or may not work, but I fixed 5 PCs that way.
---
Or just bring back survival.
---
I just would hope to not play all of the story again as I played for the end game in all games, but I guess I could give it another shot with a new character.
---
I hear you. I have cousins in SWPA and eastern Ohio (Youngstown, Columbiana) with this exact sentiment. The F*** you got in this game!? Sheesh.
---
I appreciate it. I'll look for you next time I'm on.
---
I have yet to see a single weapon or armor mod ever be in the shop, discounting skins.
---
https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Jnc0FQ3QgkUO6HZObeeGksDTPwno1Fa-Bt7uXeqWib4/mobilebasic
---
That's a pretty handy resource that tells you every junk item and the best places to get them. The more you play the more you will find certain places to find what you're looking for the easiest.
---
I haven't had any major bad experiences with people. The afk'ers at fasnacht pissed me off, but haven't really saw anyone afk aside from that event. Make sure you have pacifist mode turned on and if anyone tries to engage you in PvP you can laugh at them and move on.
---
I've generally found the community off the game has been the most helpful. Can usually get good advice on this Reddit or r/fo76filthycasuals. I hope you have nicer encounters so as to not put you off, the game is pretty fun.
---
Oohh, I‘m not sure that would work :/
---
Protip: claim a Workshop and test your theory there before you dismantle your ship. I had several occasions where some things couldn’t be restored because the build menu is arse. Had to rebuild the whole bloody thing 🙏
---
For example, and any pvper can tell you this: It’s absolutely hysterical when someone shows up to a fight with excavator PA on, lol.
---
So many damn bugs to shoot that I don't even have time to pay attention to the campfire
---
But it could be.....sure you have to invest a lot into luck to make the vats-crit model work, but that also synergises with agility based stealth perks and just being crouched when you use vats.
---
I reckon that you’d get more benefit out of adrenaline and/or gunfu agility based perks alongside the grim reapers sprint luck perk though.
---
I don't PVP, I had pacifist off once because my stepson was playing earlier in the day. I had accidentally shot someone with my lever action. My Quad FFR Tesla lovingly names Thors Eye is the only thing that saved me from that team lol.
---
people will always use PA because it is damn near idiot proof and the attraction of shiny objects is irresistible to most...
---
I got a lvl50 lobber on a tesla from a scorchbeast.. Haven't heard about the grenade clip for the gauss pistols.
---
They told you what they were interested in. Why did you expect something different?
---
I think you misunderstand what I’m saying. They aren’t selling the mods, they use them in their models. Check out the Clandestine Gauss Pistol. Or the NW Camo .44. I think the Responders Pump skin has the rails (it might’ve been a different skin). These all use those unobtainable mods in their pictures because they look much nicer that way
---
It can be seen on the Clandestine skin for the Gauss Pistol on the atom shop
---
I got the hint of what was happening there and left. I've played enough Fallout to know what those 2 were up to and ran my hiney out of that place before I found something I didn't want to! :)
---
Probably. Call it "HUD THEMES*
---
They do use alot of unreleased stuff in the promo photos eg the infamous divers suit
---
How long did it (the process) take you to launch, start to finish?
---
I don’t remember that one
---
I am just sitting on 400... and I never can spend all.
---
This change happened months ago. Not sure how people haven't picked up on it yet.
---
I wish they would buff pistols a little more. I’ve always wanted to run a bandit/western build
---
Sorry to hear that man! I'm on PS4, level 178, and I can tell you that the community on this console is very cool, obviously you'll find one or other trap base, hater, troll, etc. But it's mostly cool! 😊👍🏻
---
lol, I feel you. I don’t want to penalize Tesla users because I’m one of them, but I do think something like this might balance the legendary perks cards in such a way that it caters to all styles of play.
---
Yes it is fanboy hype for the most part been playing since beta and for every good player I run into theres 3 asshats who just try to manipulate you into pvp or fucking yourself. Private servers are so popular for a reason unfortunately.
---
Im just saying hacking/cheating is more prevalent on PC for obvious reasons. Also the servers are smaller so the community is more on Console when servers are full during queens and full nuclear winter matches. I didn't say the 76 community is toxic, but theres more toxic stuff on PC because people can break game.
---
😂😂😂I fell out when I read this. You’re not lying, mate.
---
I got Jonny to live
---
What legendary effects you got? The non legendary ones are not gonna add much stopping power for anything.
---
Nope of course not...
---
Yeah I miss the game 12-15 months ago
---
This exact scenario is intentionally possible as it was specifically something they want in this game.
---
Yep they really are not helping out the colorblind people. Especially seeing as it was a menu option in fo4.
---
"Best" use i’ve seen was for Fastnacht parades, only to add even more chaos and fun to the event. 
---
Merry Fastnacht! Happy Fastnacht!
---
Haha good tip indeed. That almost happened to me when I was making the bow section. I had to build a huge abomination of walls and rooves to trick it into letting me delete something that was "inaccessible." Phew!
---
Really though, i hate going into my camp for Beccit to remind me 1000 times a day of how it's gonna be ok or the bars open. SHUT UP IM TRYING TO PLAY MY THERIMIN
---
no you get a assassins wooden leg
---
You communist snake
---
Seems like a lore friendly quest to me. You die  = fail and lose junk. You kill them = you take their junk.
---
At least 1 dollar
---
I play on ps4 I keep getting bluescreened
---
Oh, they're captives dude you should have saved them
---
For disease cures you can always fast travel to the the white springs resort. there is a gazebo by the back of the tennis courts with a sulfur water fountain that cures diseases.   
---
as for turning off your chat completely you will miss out on meeting players. yeah there are assholes, but what online game doesn't have them? Just block and mute the bad ones.   
---
Join public events when you can too. don't feel bad about asking for water, food, stims or addictol. people usually carry extra. That or pop out a tent to grab you some.
---
Good to know... This means i have 10 days for the last of us 2
---
Some people suck. I wouldn’t let this one experience ruin public world for you. I would just be more cautious trying to make a group. Let it happen more organically. My group I played with started with me running around and following a couple while I had no mic. Then I started tagging along with people they played with and such. In then got a mic, returned the favor and niceness, to another player who is now part of my group. My group is now a solid 8-10 people who we all have now ventured off and play DayZ now as well. It’s all what you make it man. Good luck with yer adventures! :)
---
Yes in that case you do.  I don't require a full 15 points anywhere to swap between builds. I planned the points out so they fit multiple builds.
---
Honestly, if they introduced an instant Respec they'd either overcharge severely for it or do something like... "Spend 10 level ups and redo everything!"
---
If you have private world easiest thing to do, like I and others I know do, is to do workshops on your private world whilst you do daily micromanagement stuff first off, farm resources alone and use that to passively supplement your gathering, then go public to do everything else after. 
---
It’s not ideal but in a game where pacifist mode exists and PVP doesn’t really exist other than at designated workshops, the PVP crowd will absolutely jump on it. I’m level 150 odd on my current character and there’s nothing I can do really to PVP boys at workshops geared for it, so I just avoid it. 
---
Largely, learning locations for materials organically is infinitely more profitable anyway and faster, without having to use resources up to farm them. There’s loads of lists about but I can help you with some locations for prime stuff that’s always needed. 
---
Other than that, I’m on PC and am always looking for new things to do. I’d be happy to team up with you and do some stuff, show you things and spot you some resources to take off the early game pressure. Up to you, some people appreciate that, others prefer to go it alone and get their own stuff for the achievement and feeling of progress.

Either way expecting your experiences to always be positive is largely unrealistic, as frustrating as it can be on the receiving end. I’ve played pretty much every major online game and this is by far the most friendly and least toxic I’ve personally experienced. But people do still exist that wanna fight others of maybe troll.
---
It’ll get easier with more experience and knowledge if you’re willing to put in the effort but for sure there’s good people around that’ll help you out given an opportunity. 
---
Good luck either way, hope you have better fortune for a while.
---
Roleplayers trying to fill the perpetuated 50's street gang aesthetic that has been apart of every Fallout game?
---
Also, LOL at being level 200 and still wearing PA to PVP. RNG sucks and trading is dark magic, huh?
---
They must've gone down RIGHT after I logged off last night.
---
This is a good idea, they already have a weapon mod that deplete cores, why not one that recharged as well.
---
There are hordes of people on xbox who live to adopt noobs. Join the filthy casuals sub.
---
Cool, seems like a good time for them to break power armor and primary legendary effects again. It’s been awhile.
---

I haven't! 
---
Lmandragoran please add me.  Help would be appreciated!
---
my build is a straight up vanilla full health sneaky vats-crit build yo
---
all of my damage comes from sneak unless it breaks.. and then.. crits, furious weapons and skill...
---
I know its semantics.. but what I consider a build to be is where the primary damage source is coming from..
---
for example.. everything you described earlier is without question absolutely true facts..
---
but if they stood up.. they would still be 1 shotting everything based on the bloodied and or junkie bonuses without the sneak
---
so In my world.. that clearly does not align with yours outside of a few indisputable facts.. they are not "stealth builds"
---
so.. you can feel free to keep typing paragraphs but my POV really isnt going to change at all..
---
I didn't know pacifist mode existed until someone else mentioned it in this thread. I wasn't expecting always positive and I've said as much. I just wasn't expecting only negative.
---
Not the OP, but I did my first run about a week ago. Took me over an hour, as I had no strategy. Did the second one a couple days later, and it took about half the time.
---
Anchorage Attacker!
---
That’s the life of a builder for ya lol
---
Sounds like my ex.
---
Display them ASAP, list them for sale for ridiculously high caps, or remove them each time before you scrap / repair / craft anything. Sucks but those are like the only ways to preserve or “lock” junk items.
---
Then it’s probably 45

He's five feet tall and he's five feet wide.
---
its funny because its true.. lol
---
So many bugs to get poisoned by! Lol. My vision would be gone after a few seconds and it was the one place I could always find a use for insect repellant!
---
There might be one of those in the tool room at the Whitespring adjacent to the laundry room.
---
they probably need it because their stash is full and they would be over encumbered otherwise..
---
the other universal truth is that people hoard way too much shit they dont need..lol
---
It used to be..
---
Instead make post about making post !!!
---
It's because the PVE hardhats consider PVP and griefing to be synonymous.
---
They just can't wrap their heads around it because they're so used to being a literally god of the sandbox.
---
&gt;Pc is toxic, community is on consoles
---
No, you’re not saying hacking is worse on PC. You literally said that the PC side of 76 is toxic, and the “actual community” that everybody talks so highly of is on console. There are toxic players on every platform. I’ve had great experiences on PC, and very, very rarely come across anybody that’s toxic. And hey, guess what? There’s game breaking stuff on console, too. None of the past dupe methods needed a third-party app; they could be some with nothing but the Creation engine, which is the same engine on XBox and PlayStation as it is on PC.
---
The fart noises when popping floaters 💨
---
I think the “Electric Absorption” at the moment comes standard with the small chance to recharge your fusion core already. Adding something to that like a small chance of immunity to electrical damage or maybe even an ability to deflect electrical damage is something that “might” help PA users out.
---
I have a 2 shot fatman experimental mirv I keep around in my stash, just for when I feel like fireworks. But, no I don't carry any mini nukes either. Lol
---

Its not a post solely about the outage read!!! I have played everyday since beta for 4-12 hours each day yet I have not logged in since sunday now and it looks like in just the nic of time. I love Fo76 but there are to many issues this far in. I have never had a game be so frustrating as some of my days with Fo76.
---
Try night, but like try dusk more...as nonspecific as that sounds.  Also be around that area at that time a little bit.  Happy hunting!  I am still looking for robot leg and chest armor plans after all this time to get my last badge.  Cool thing about this game for me is I know I will inevitably get it when I least expect it.  I just have to not look so hard. Lol
---
Or just do some other events and you will have hundreds of notes without sinking caps into it. :)
---
The workbench in the penitentiary has them.
---
i want a legendary 'fix it good' card to fix this game
---
Fallout 0th - Host your own dedicated, local server, so you won’t experience the riffraff and unreliable / unstable nature of private servers or logins
---
Take the workshop for the plans, XP, and caps, and keep moving.
---
You can usually find more of (whatever) the workshop produces in a shorter amount of time by roaming the wastes and scrapping.  Even fusion cores once you learn where to look.
---
If you get a defend (against NPCs), stay outside the zone and snipe them.  Mole rats and SBs will come to you, BTW)
---
Yes but you underestimate my ability to empty all of my supplies and fill my stash immediately. 
---
Steel and lead mostly
---
I make a lot of ammo 🤣
---
Pretty sure there are hammer spawns most places there is a tool board. Dunno what kind I’m afraid but usually there’s a little bunker at mine locations all over the ash heap with tool boards/tool spawns in, also I’m pretty sure the maintenance place at whitespring has them, also Blackwater mine near there with all the mole miners. 
---
Might be worth checking the big drill location too, lotta rooms and spots there, or the little area of warehouses where the overseer mission about her ex ends.
---
😂stop it.
---
Yeah. Mid SBQ. 🤷🏽‍♀️
---
Exactly. The issue is Bethesda not making the PVP/pacifist modes comprehensive. Both have been half-baked since inception.
---
It's not the teams' fault for stalking your workshop and ganking you - that's what raiders ought to do.
---
It's not your fault for not noticing the other players and it's not your fault there is no initial handshake on workshop contesting.
---
I've played the new WC event, I recommend curbing your enthusiasm towards it. 
---
Spoilers ahead:
---
You run into a small room filled with hazards and an endless spawn of Wendigos while you try to deal damage to the WC and stay alive. And depending on your build and the players in the event with you, you will either kill the WC very quickly, complete it after a lengthy time period of ammo and stimpak usage, or fail because your team isnt fealing enough damage. 
---
Its essentially the queen fight but in a much more confined space.
---
I quit within a min. I just thought it was ridiculous they are luring in casuals and new players by inviting people making posts.
---
Good to know.
---
Same for me. Took me and a buddy over an hour about a month ago as we drunk/high stumbled through the silo... There is another way to do it... much, much quicker and you only need a keycard... no tracking down officers for their silo codes either...
---
I havent even tried to connect yet today once I saw the shitstorm here on the sub..
---
Took a minute but I found them. Thanks so much!
---
I guess it could be just bad luck. I play on PC a lot (close to 1650 hours total) and the amount of negative stuff has been really minimal. Actually most of the time people are nice and polite to an point it becomes irritating. Maybe try blocking some of those people so you're less likely to get on servers with them. If you're playing on teams try sticking to solo play for a bit. I have always played solo and it's been enjoyable. If you are looking for good people try downloading the text chat mod from nexusmods because there's a lot of good people on there to play with. I have hardly ever seen anyone on there harass or troll people other than in a friendly way with each other. I'm on there on a regular basis offering help or advice for people who are having trouble understanding how to setup a build or figuring out the complicated mechanics of the game. I'm not the type to dispense a bunch of stuff for low levels or team up with people but I am always up for questions or advice.
---
As far as workshop pvp goes... my advice there is don't. Just stay out of workshops because they're poor sources of scrap compared to mining or enemy farming. The only use I have for workshops is plan farming and atom challenges. I almost never take workshops on a public server unless it's for pvp. On private I will take workshops to play with building sometimes, but that's pointless on a public server because it just makes you a bigger target for pvp. At your level pvp is rough. It's heavily dependent on having certain weapons and good armor and damage mitigation perks and mutations. Also till update 20 hits you will leave your camp vulnerable to damage anytime you engage in workshop pvp because as it sits now their teammates become hostile with you when they do. When they attack you your camp is vulnerable from the time you become hostile with them till the time you respawn (as long as you dont hit seek revenge which keep you hostile after respawning too). So don't leave your character dead on the ground next time, because they can wreck your camp the whole time. If you want to end pvp with them choose respawn and pick another location on the map or hit ignore to block that person for the session. Also, merely passing through a workshop area automatically makes you open to pvp even if you have pacifist enabled, and if you do you can't attack back with pacifist on so if being in workshops is your plan keep pacifist off. Be warned though, with it off you can be attacked after events end if you accidentally tag another person with a stray shot or splash damage.
---
Well I was gonna play yesterday but my game wasn’t finished updating. I didn’t really think it would happen again but ya know, Bethesda will be Bethesda.
---
quantum grenades are bugged. Blast radius is tiny and bugged even with perks. Used to make them all the time but realized they didn't do shit. Several posts on here are about the issue (https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/auzxnn/nuka_quantum_grenades/)
---
I used the nukacrypt website. My problem was I kept engaging bots, ignoring that they would spawn infinitely. Made repairing the pipes an annoying process.
---
I’m sure didn’t expect always positive, but complaining it’s all negative is just the same really, as you must realise that it’s just bad luck or confirmation bias and can’t possibly be bad constantly, the same way you know it can’t possibly be good all the time right. 
---
People don’t rave about it being a good community for no reason, so on one hand you have many account of people having a positive experience, but so far only your own saying it’s entirely negative. 
---
If you wanna vent that’s fine, but if you stay entrenched in the idea everyone is a shit, then you’ll confirmation bias yourself into a corner. I just offered you a lot of help and advice, for nothing, and the only thing you replied was being a bit snarky and focused on the negative still. 
---
Just saying, you may wanna change your approach or you’ll always feel the same even when people are offering you advice and the help you claim to never see 🤷🏻‍♂️
---
Focus on DPS is a mistake as that only matters for incredibly tanky enemies (encryptid, SBQ) and PVP (because of the DPS cap). Most enemies die in one shot anyway.
---
In any case, commando stealth isn’t the highest dps in the game, that’s now a well set up heavy gunner build. Sure, bloodied commando builds still do respectable damage, but maybe it needs a buff now?!
---
yeah.. it sux..
---
and I already fapped today too.. soooo fucking bored now.. lol
---
WE GET SIGNAL
---
Regardless, the PVP change hardly affects casual griefing.
---
Under new rules, you can still spot another player at a workshop, contest and murder them. You just don't see their icon on the map so guesswork is required.
---
The real loss is having to spend 5 minutes with the 4 team-based PVP handshakes instead of 1. 4 players will get greased before the fight begins. Odds are, someone will get put into godmode from the start anyways, ruining the experience.
---
Some locations you can build right up next to it!
---
they just sneak the circle up as close as they can and build right on the edge of it..
---
Looks awesome. Love the texture of it. I like to use the winterman effigy and halfwalls. You break 1 halfwall and have a nice looking fire place
---
No bugles either apparently.
---
Needs to be a THUNDERDOME vibe with seating for those that wish to watch. All out brawls or tournament style 1v1 matches with random predetermined loadouts that you can pick from in a locker in the prep room. Also needs fire. Lots of fire
---
Worth it for a sweet ass robotic...trash bin...spider...thing...
---
B is shitting their pance right now at the prospect of borked servers all weekend..
---
*yes I spelled "pance" like that intentionally..
---
Texted todd, he said "it just works" and "buy more atoms".
---
-edit
---
He also said hes busy with the ps5 release of skyrim.
---
I call them blind and bright cycles..
---
You could always sell it for about 400-500 caps if you don't want it.
---
It's lag related. I have a stalkers bow that's a guaranteed first hit when in \[Hidden\] and even that misses sometimes. It's a lot better than my other bows though, so I pretty much only use that bow now.
---
Hardcore mode ftw
---
Oh it definitely helps.
---
the servers might catch a cold and shutdown
---
Yeah, but he said it "says a lot about *society*", as in real life, and he seems to be equating accepting gifts and trusting the kindness of strangers with greed. Which honestly says way more about him than society.
---
Wont get double bonuses from that mate. Dont spread lies.
---
I like heritage that doesn't lose ;)
---
Sorry to hear your having a bad experience, I dont have much - but if you would like some water, chems or just want to go exploring or questing Id be happy to help. IGN is same as my username.
---
1 hour in game is 3 min IRL. 12 hours is 36 min IRL. It takes 72 IRL minutes for a day to pass in 76. You can finish the math.
---
Sorry, I genuinely meant to add more to that response and got distracted irl and sent it incomplete without thinking.
---
 I appreciate your advice. There was some apparently pretty basic shit that I didn't understand about the game before making this thread. Yes, I am venting and understand it's been bad luck. Making this thread, was in in part, me saying "hey can you guys please tell me this isn't normal" rather than a commitment to confirmation bias, however I understand it can read that way. Thanks again
---
Oh! I got serious Cannibal vibes from them and got out. Every other fallout game has had a cannibal home, I felt a bed&amp;breakfast would be a perfect cover for a cannibal family!
---
Make it like your aids don't carry over and you get -1hp every 2 or 3 seconds. And no, vendors don't sell aids, boiled water don't replenish your health
---
lol.. dont hold your breath yo
---
This is a rare one. Don’t scrap it: place it in a display case later.
---
Because the devs hates the disabled
---
Half serious answer: The 76 code and Fallout 4 code is exactly the same and they can't figure out how to add text chat. At this point any reason from them is just pure incompetence.
---
Why shouldn't it? This game has serious potential for fun survival PVP, especially with the base building / destruction mechanic.
---
The issue is that:
---
- PVP interactions are balanced around the unbalanced PVE system (see One Wasteland)
---
- PVP interactions carry no incentives besides carried junk, negligible caps and griefing.
---
- PVP/Pacifist flagging is unfair, abusable and uncontrolled - with no UI indication before PVP starts.
---
- Every location has 1 respawn/FT marker, which rewards spawn killing.
---
- Workshops don't provide anywhere near the benefit they should if PVP is supposed to be a constant threat.
---
- Workshops can't be blueprinted, require resources and take way too long to customize to create unique PVP experiences.
---
- Camps do not automatically regenerate after being destroyed by another player. It is a huge resource sink to fight in a custom zone if you don't have Fallout 1st.
---
- If Nuclear Winter was the designated PVP mode, they would have removed Assassin's gear, Monster Mash and all adventure PVP by now. They have not.
---
You do need nukacrypt, but I can solo in less than 9 minutes now... counting the 6 minute or so launch sequence...
---
For legendary &amp; perk purposes 6 AM &amp; 6 PM
---
Likely to build up so casual players who just play for the 3 dailies have a cushion. It’s not a bad curve though, so I don’t mind it as is.
---
Probably has to do with location and enemy spawns as well.
---
They would have to make it so that pacifists have separate workshops  or workshops are bought and sold and not contested.
---
Well, I'm nowhere near that quick at it!
---
I find higher level players (like myself) enjoy the game too much to troll. It’s the 80 - 120 that tend to want to flex over lower players. 
---
Communication is key as I was gunned down in pvp before and the other three that ganged up on me thought I was someone else and gifted me a junkies rifle after they found out. Maybe those testers thought they were doing you a favor by rewarding you to play test dummies but can’t blame you for not wanting to wast your time.
---
Trap bases, griefers and thieves do thrive at all levels tho and you need to keep your wits active.
---
Automatic rifles
---
isnt it the same as other benches..?
---
asking because I dont build anything that isnt quest required
---
Have an updoot for not foaming at the mouth cussing while asking for something completely reasonable.  Kudos bud.
---
Does INT drive XP earned? I regret not having more INT in hindsight.
---
Oh you're spot on with the cannibal part, except they're not the cannibals, if you pass a perception check the woman tells you there's cannibals down stairs that wait until a guest rents a room and she says you can ambush them down there if you wanna help
---
I thought the difference was sneak is completely broken at the moment
---
Isn't this first outage since like... launch? Why do people act like they are entitled to Todd's firstborn? Give it time ffs
---
Like my camps location or the location of the turrets
---
I keep thinking about that. I hate it just because I like to watch TV and listen to music when I'm playing games, but the idea of not having features for people with disabilities is such a slap in the face, and exponentially more so when that feature is on consoles.
---
It’s in energy weapons under weapons workshop. Give that a look?
---
You get 20 a day though by just doing the dailies.
---
Weapons workbench &gt; Energy weapons
---
The image will show a box with 3 question marks on it,
---
 And why do idiots like you act like simple communication to a customer base is equivalent to a first born child?
---
that was not my experience 3 days ago when I was last able to log on to actually play the game..
---
I once went to a guys camp that roleplay as BOS. he made one of those undeground camps, but he made it like a BOS bunker. very immersive.
---
It should be under the energy weapons tab on the workbench  .
---
So give extra scrip or caps, maybe? I love how all the fat cat t-note guys are on here slamming the idea at face value because they are perfectly fine with their stacks, but the fact of the matter is the double XP starts to give diminishing returns after a while, so maybe other types reward weekends could be added into the mix? Double XP doesn’t have to go away. It can coexist with other bonus weekends.
---
Please also add me! Nukathulhu I am always down for helping out! I do like to talk so I'd love it if you re-enabled voice! My husband and I play a lot and we have a group that is always happy to have a new friend! We're happy doing what ever and would love for you to join us!
---
It's under energy weapons make sure you ain't looking under heavies section. Or maybe you purchased plans for mods not the weapon.
---
Have you tried recently? People are playing right now on PS4.
---
first step, repair your 'z' button, it seems to be stuck.  
---
  
---
2nd step would be nice if you mentioned, what you want to do 76 times.
---
People are so fucking stupid, they can take 2 min to post their problem but not scroll for 2 min to find the same situation
---
Are you able to build that close to The whitespring station?
---
Cause they are doing it rn? Check Bethesda support before whining they are communicating atm just not in this subreddit. You literally want them to contact you personally?
---
Ok. Thanks for the info.
---
I would love to play today, as I work all weekend. Oh well. Guess I will be playing in 5 minute increments. Even private servers are boinked; for some reason I thought they would be different, since they are hosted by Amazon. Did the code get messed up?
---
&gt; *"Someone killed me while I was AFK at my workshop and stole 20 caps worth of junk. BAN HIM"*
---
As an obsessive builder in this game.... &gt;.&gt;... C-can I steal that idea? Because I'm totally stealing that idea. That looks freakin' great and really goes well with the look of the rest of the room!
---
right on the other side of the tracks.. 
---
what in the real world would be like.. 20-30 ft something in there..
---
Oh alright pm me please :0
---
I know but people buy them.lol
---
Survival didn't fail because nobody wants to play PVP. Survival failed because the other gameplay rules it offered were completely asinine.
---
Don’t know why people are downvoting you, legit post on the topic but then again people downvote because of many reasons mostly because they are children who only want to filter everything except what they want to hear even if it’s the truth. Have an upvote, I support you.
---
Nailed it.
---
There is a text chat mod that is highly popular that could get the job done for you
---
Just a fair warning, mods/the ini files fucked my game and support told me to buy a new graphics card so make sure you know what you're doing if you go that route.
---
I know it sucks, sorry. But with multiple disabled people stepping forward to complain and the ADA for gamers saying they need text chat just to be met with silence from Bethesda, they're not going to do anything and their silence is one of the main reasons I'm quitting the game.
---
They pulled Survival to implement Nuclear Winter to cut down on server costs.
---
If you would buy more Atoms, maybe the PVP players wouldn't be forced to play with you.
---
Also, this was never advertised as a single player game. I don't know why that's your argument.
---
Im talking about the events that cycle.not the one's you can do anytime.
---
Ok, just make it double xp and treasury notes, not that hard.  Right now XP doesn't help me in the least.
---
Just got booted while fighting the queen. So long, ammo.
---
I don't mean to actually build the fermenter.
---
Once you have it built and want to put in fermentable beer/wine/nukashine there are 10 available slots. I try to add the liquor but I get the message that build budget has been exceeded.
---
I would love to have anything to make me even more resistant to electrical damage!
---
u/RF_Huntr
---
that looks.......like a fire hazard!
---
i would like the qbility to carft legendary varients of any weapon for legendary modules like you buy two then go and craft your favorite weapon types but its like crafting vault 79 stuff
---
I mean Bethesda has always favored sneak builds in their FO titles and even in The Elder Scrolls.
---
You mean all the 30/6 posts about the seasons not rewarding rewards?
---
Ok, so mystery solved. It still shows up in Mortimers inventory despite the fact I bought it last night and read it. 
---
I will put a ticket in to Bethesda to see if I can get my 750 gold back? I’m 200 shy to buy it again!
---
Update: all the mods I bought are gone too. 
---
Bought the triple barrel and prime capacitor. So 1100 worth of bullion.
---
No doubt! 💪
---
it should be a reward everyone can receive when they do that kind of event IMO..
---
You did it you son of a bitch. You called for bethesda to fix 76 without getting massive downvotes. Show me your ways.
---
Yeah, I tried to get the mods set up the other day and did something wrong and had some problems. Decided to not try again for a while. 
---
That really sucks man, I can only imagine what it's like to have that simple level of communication not be available for people who actually need it.
---
Now try to write se same on the searchbar
---
im on pc my username is gargoyale
---
Ah, thanks, I'll have to go take care of that now then! :)
---
Thanks. I'm new to the community and wanted to bring up this experience. Not sure if others have been through this. Also was hoping new players would hit me up to play by seeing this post.
---
Please do! And I'm pretty sure there's a better way to do the concrete supports than stack tires, I just didn't think of anything else.
---
hmu if your on pc
---
You will still automatically be flagged for PVP with the owner if you contest the shop.
---
In order for you or your target's squad to help, you all need to perform the handshakes. Up to 16 handshakes.
---
the way Im looking at it is.. that will be 1 less day with a hundred "raise the cap" threads.. lol
---
Dude that's amazingly nice of you, not amazing for handouts but I'm lvl 37, I've never liked melee much, and ammo is a pain in this game, I'm constantly out of lead (ant stimpacks now and then, rng gives me radaway radx constantly when with the perk card boosts for finding meds). The one time I tried to farm some from a workshop it lasted an hour before a lvl 300 something came and liked me and took it over. People like you give reason for new people like me to stick it out.
---
Fallout 76 is like your title, mostly right with some error thrown in.
---
With the lack of a safe trade system, I think you’re asking for trouble.
---
They need to bring back those tires.
---
Sort by \*New\*.
---
Just use pacifist?
---
Meh, keeps it fun for me during the stretches of greater server stability. Glad I haven’t needed to deal with the monotonous grind for gear for a little while. RPing, exploring, and helping others has injected fun back into the game for me, and seeing how much of the map I can claim and rebuild has been more of a challenge than FO4 for me, though I can’t go wild with building like I could in that game.
---
You should be entitled enough to an opinion at 10 hours or 2000 hours.
---
You both bought the same game lease.
---
That would literally take away the fear of shooting one of them.
---
my username is gargoyale
---
Commando weapons. Full auto rifles.
---
can you store stuff in there? or this is when crafting?
---
again forgive me.. Ive only used that stuff for the nukashine quest
---
So you *WILL* need to slap each member of a squad individually?
---
I'll be on late tonight and could help
---
Yes but that would defeat besthesda corporate interest of retention interaction and playtime, which is why fo76 is filled with multiple separate  mobile like timer and daily limits on purpose.....
---
“Weapon flipper”
---
*Nicholas Cage intensifies*
---
Looks like the hardhats don't even like pvp players Killing other pvp players
---
Cool
---
But why did Zenimax pull FO76 from the IGN showcase ?
---
Or when you go to build camp items to display them, and the game goes into your stash box and takes those items first to use as scrap instead of using the goddamn scrapbox!
---
a flamer is the best weapon and no
---
Lies, the stealth armor is from the Wastelanders quest line, which you have to be at least level 20 to complete, and you can't trade the suits. Was it the marine suit?
---
Sure you aren't just overlooking it in the pip boy?  It's going to be a legendary and won't just be called gauss pistol.  Could have any number of goofy prefixes before it's name and might blend in with other weapons you have unless you follow a custom naming scheme.
---
Absolutely agreed 👍
---
I was disappointed when I learned Allies didn't fight with you.  Fallout 76 is the only Fallout game without companions.  Automatron is one of the best Fallout 4 DLC and would have been perfect for Fallout 76 even before Wastelanders.
---
It's going to be so time consuming and jarring.
---
I agree, hacked and legacy gear needs to be addressed. Removing explosive as a potential drop only did more harm to this game than good.
---
Thanks, I had no idea about the workshop thing making my camp vulnerable, but it does explain why my camp was destroyed. Luckily my camp was garbage anyway.
---
I'm thinking almost none. Most requests are just outrageous like unlimited stash, unlimited caps, unlimited scrip, make pvp great again, don't delete my precious devroom items just make them legit so on and on. It's so painful to watch that mod of this subreddit made a rule so people wouldn't post stupid suggestions
---
Something is still wrong. I am not able to even log into my account to check on my support ticket.
---
You can build next to WS station, or last I checked you could.
---
There used to be more buildable zones, and there used to also be a glitch that would let you place a camp inside a no build zone if you slowly carried the camp unit from a green area into a red area because that would prevent it from turning from green to red and would let it place. That was patched a while ago but camps in those places can still be there if people havent moved.
---
Yeah I get it, it’s no problem I wasn’t having a go I just kinda wanted you to think about it beyond being (rightfully) angry at your bad experiences. 
---
There’s a lot to understand when you’re starting fresh and it’s easy to take things for granted from this side of it when you’ve got it all figured out and know what to do to maximise your experiences and how the PvP works etc. 
---
I genuinely do hope it improves for you and you’re open to a more positive experience too, it can’t stay all bad and hopefully people will start showing you the good aspects. I’ve had some great experiences myself and very few bad ones so I hope that starts happening for you too and you stick with it!
---
Fridges 😂
---
Yep your right and now I feel silly for this post many thanks sorry aswell
---
I could see this, give us the option to craft a weapon in a specific category Ex. Automatic-Manual-Pistol-Energy-Heavy-Unarmed-1 Hand-2 Hand and still require us to know the plans for any special weapons.  This would give us a tighter range on what we get, and would be slightly more expensive then the current Muurgh picks as we would need 2 modules (100 scrip) and scrap to craft.
---
Does anybody know the music that plays on the vending machines?
---
im sure it could be easily as fun as gmod.. no reason why is shouldnt..
---
the real question is.. does anyone actually want them to spend time on that?
---
Me? Id rather have them implement say.. an actual proper trade dialogue before copying someone elses game mode..
---
Maybe as an April Fools event or something. Prop hunt is always fun if done right though.
---
also.. TTT would be a better fit IMO...
---
No, you can't store stuff. It only has the 10 slots for fermentable alcohols.
---
The TSE nerf. Bobby pins are now weightless. Although the fine tuning of the scrip system was Beth's, the idea to scrap legendaries for a new currency was a community suggestion. I want to say Fasnacht as well because they community did ask for it quite early on, however the developers indicated it was something they had plans for anyway.
---
Edit: And repair kits. Also the survival tent if you want to include 1st features
---
Yes but countered by having to take pictures of Paige so it’s a wash.
---
TIL that PVP is bullying.
---
Might be a good time to ditch that Raider flair, pal.
---
Agreed. Like they should have before even thinking of a friggin battleroyale
---
haven't played for over a week at this point out of boredom and all the glitches making it a real pain to finish any of my quests. 
---
Did they fix anything during that time frame? 
---
Or should I just cancel my Fallout First account.
---
They said before it would be at least early July, which means this is getting rushed out ahead of schedule. Either that or their ITV writers were given wrong information, which wouldn't be surprising since nobody seems to know what's really going on there. Maybe they just don't have that much work to do for this update since all the important things are getting pushed to a later update, but still wouldn't have too much hope since there's plenty of room to break things
---
Dont worry after 2 hours, the repairs will need to be made again. The reward will be 4, 40mm grenades, 10 missiles, and 3 purified waters.
---
There was! Thank you!
---
How are you gentleman
---
dude, you're acting as if this is some huge important business service and you're a stockholder or member of the board. calm down, maybe go for a walk. It's just a game, system issues happen.
---
then I am inclined to agree it is indeed quite stupid operating in that manner...
---
You’re entitled to any view you want to have, although it is also a fact that my world is also your world and what you want to believe doesn’t match this reality.
---
An optimised bloodied / junkies build really is likely to also be a stealth build.....because the stealth bonus applies after the bloodied / junkies effect which buffs the base weapon damage.
---
Outside of stealth they would get just 100% (2x base) and 50% (1.5x base) damage buff respectively on their own which is less than you’re getting with your “vanilla stealth build” - I’m going to guess that you’re using some sort of AA, F or I weapon though so you’re also getting a notable base damage bonus anyway (1.25+).
---
Being in stealth boosts bloodied / junkies damage to 5-7x and 3.75-5.25x base damage respectively, this is particularly easy to achieve for blooded as that build really really synergises with stealth. You would have to be insane to forgo that scale of multiplier.
---
Found some at Whitesprings where you mentioned. Gonna check Mount Blair next. Thanks so much!
---
yeah sounds fun , a big poster or billboard where we could write a message would aso be good .
---
The thing is, is that it doesn't have to be. What Nukacolariley and her goons do is bullying. I would set up with others who were around my level and we'd orchestrate battles. PvP is not bullying, but the way some people do it especially the people upset at this change, is bullying.
---
For the legendary modules yes, but for the scrip it wouldn't change anything other then the ability to horde the notes just like the current Treasury Notes. 
---
I personally feel that having having the ability to make albeit expensive Modules, would at least give me more incentive to play.  I would be able to trade 10 3\* weapons in for 3 modules, get 3 random rolls of 1-3\*s and then have to go back and farm more to try again, as even 3 3\* weapons would only be 27 parts, and it takes 30 per Module.  I would however have the ability to keep trying instead of waiting for the next day.
---
Yes! I loved that quest!! Weasel was such a cool character idea, I do want to see more of her. 
---
Its not really a quest but I adored the Mountainside Inn (i dont remember the name but the yellow house near Foundation w an Overseer log) having NPCs, being able to rent a room, and what happened next I NEVER saw coming. It was what gave me faith in F76. That small, insignificant encounter.
---
PVP player openly drops IGNs looking for more players.
---
Gets calls sweaty, toxic and try hard??
---
I guess all twitch streamers have Autism for playing League of Legends or Overwatch because those games are PVP based.
---

Some code from computer, and rest from paper in the barn.

Commander Zavala reference?
---
Awesome! I'll keep an eye out for ya if I find others.
---
Fair enough, im only capitalist because I wanted to live in Watoga.
---
Man, I get hit ALL THE TIME. One time, this kid was talking in third person the whole time, acting like I wasn't there. I'm all like, "I can HEAR YOU, dude." 
---
It's so demoralizing when you're taken out by a nine-year-old. I have no qualms about virtually knee-capping the punk.
---
&gt; Focus on DPS is a mistake as that only matters for incredibly tanky enemies (encryptid, SBQ) and PVP (because of the DPS cap). Most enemies die in one shot anyway.
---
&gt; I was meaning it for those enemies as any build can one shot other enemies.
---
Talking the Motherload through it's existential crisis was hilarious and awesome at the same time.
---
You'll get perma banned too when you crash the server by having a friend build the Circus trailer in your camp.
---
Be careful what you wish for.
---
Atom shop refrigerators, fallout 1st scrapbox, repair kits, the entirety of Wastelanders, New Vegas Ranger outfits, legit way to get marine helmets, vault raids (though later removed), private servers, backpacks, farmable dirt tiles
---
"It's just a game" was always a poor excuse for anything, but especially so here when many of these people have a $100 subscription on the line alongside their time investment. Communication is important anywhere and bethesda isn't known for it, so OP's request is perfectly reasonable, if a bit premature
---
&gt; Most requests are just outrageous
---
and the rest are basic things that are almost foundation to any MMO
---
To add to the Fasnacht event: 
---
Bethesda DID improve drop rates for last year's rare masks, and this year's rare masks were actually obtainable. They extended the event for another week as well. 
---
Both of these were heavily requested during last year's Fasnacht and when 2020's didn't launch correctly, respectively.
---
I don't use them or carry them. I can't speak for everyone though.
---
If they would buff the explosive heavy weapons I would carry a reduced weight fatman with me just to nuke mobs and stuff but as it is the only worthwhile ones are fairly rare legendary ones, bloodied or junkies with 33% higher vats chance and reduced weight.
---
Edit: I will buy 40mm grenades if they're in your vendor for 1 or 2 caps though. I have a two shot faster fire rate 40mm auto grenade launcher that I keep just to have fun with, because you can use it like a whole squad of mortars and carpet and entire town with indirect fire. Love hitting point pleasant with a few hundred 40mm shells like that and clearing the whole area of cultists before I even step inside the place.
---
You mean Bethesda was still trying to cater towards a pvp based balance and game. Dont forget they nerfed the Explosive effect right along side it. The main reason being the TSE weapons were way op and pvp crybabies were whining for a nerf. This was back when Bethesda still was under the impression they should be focusing on pvp based changes. 
---
All Bethesda had to do was apply the nerf to the Explosive effect, because it did actually need it, and then disable the ability for TS and Explosive to roll on the same weapon. But as per usual, they have next to no idea what is good for the game, and swung way too hard with the nerf. 
---
If they restored TS to exactly what it was and didnt allow it to roll with Exposive then the game would have nice new high health meta option.
---
20 a day is great if you can play everyday.
---
lmao no, what is the point? you can only redeem 20 a day so if you farm them all you are doing is  give your self a surplus you dont need. on top of that, only players who finished the wastelanders story get to participate so it would be pretty lame to those newer players who would get left out.
---
i think  most people would rather just have XP or a mumbles discount.
---
I have like 5, what can you offer?
---
Ignoring problems. 😭
---
At least we dont have daily streaks w benefits like Red Dead... Had a 28 day.. Missed it bc of Wastelanders lmao.
---
Yes but then it's back to storage and pushing fo1st to get more storage room.
---
When you realize there 2 teams at "Bethesda" they make more sense the Devs who want to make an awesome fun enjoyable game, and the corp side who have the final say, to whom you are the product and Want to milk you for as much as they can and I'd be surprised if they still view us as people in there heads.
---
I encourage it
---
When the update first came out, Mountainside was the very first encounter I had and it got me so excited. It reminded me of Andale in FO3 and it felt exactly how it should and felt very much like Fallout. That's awesome, I'm glad others felt the same about it.
---
In all honestly F76 has more content than RDO
---
I usually look at the pictures that pop up when I go through my weapons inventory or any for that matter and then I rename it.
---
I think its the strange random encounters and areas that make Fallout so good. The first time I cam across the mannequins in a circle, it was so weird to see.
---
That be nice to. I would like different sections so I could do a brief history on castle black, bounty targets, and a personal log section. It would also be nice to be able to chance the C.A.M.P.S name thru it, so whenever someone sees it instead of seeing usernames camp, they would see Castle black or whatever name they have given it.
---
Maybe. But this game's struggling to give people 200 more stash space. People should consider things like this before suggesting anything. People should think with their brain
---
Uhhh
---
So it's okay for raider NPCs to shoot you but not raider players?
---
It's not immersive because they won't fix the mechanics and balance because the rhetoric is "pvp grief" and not "fix pvp".
---
When I logged in this morning all of my daily quests showed up and I guess I'll begin to show up again at 8:00 p.m.
---
No, I can talk to AC, Pita, Pita’s mom, and Slick - I didn’t see Regs.
---
Honestly, I was sorta peeved at ruining the surprise of finding the MIBs and got outta there pretty quick.
---
Which is sad considering RDR2 was amazing and deserved some DLC, but that was ignored in order to focus on RDO.
---
Best advice I can give (having a camp on a super active spawn)
---
1/ try to orient your camp so you can get maximum turrets facing the spawn 
---
2/ put the turrets on things that are not just foundations .. if they ghost break it sucks to lose them and the budget
---
3/ put your ally station close to the spawn ... it is amusing to come back and see your ally toting a minigun and spitting lead into a sheepsquatch. If the ally is too far back they wont help. http://imgur.com/a/KLyKnL3 
---
4/ see if you can use the terrain to keep your expensive items safe (rad shower) 
---
5/ I use a mix of heavy machine gun, laser and missiles
---
6/ scarecrows can attract attacks, so toss one down range
---
7/ the plantable trees can also funnel targets and are surprisingly sturdy defenses
---
all your ideas are awesome i would like a hardcore survival
---
Uhh, don't accept pvp flags at your camp?
---
They're his been a huge DDOS attack going on against the United States as well as Australia many companies are getting thrown offline for an indefinite period of time. Some for as long as a week.
---
funny enough, the art for some of the perk cards like mister sandman have a 1911 (or something very similar) in the art.
---
we also saw the R91 in some art on the main menu along time ago and now we have a skin in the files. so maybe there is some hope. but i think it cant be a skin because otherwise it would have auto receivers and that would be an abomination, so it needs to be its own weapon.
---
its time to have a nice top tier semi auto pistol that isnt the size of a mazda on my screen. the 1911 is my #1 request for a new weapon for the game.
---
Also
---
8/ rep grind is more fun when half the time you go to your camp you get rep ;)
---
Here's another of my settler wanderer sharing 5mm with a visitor

---
Reusing assignment code from displays, maybe? Displays make sense to use budget because the item is actively being rendered, same as any other CAMP item. Anything that isn't actually being rendered in the CAMP shouldn't cost budget.
---
I am on the Xbox platform and have had no problems today at all.
---
Me too, but they removed it for a battle royal 😨
---
Sorry to hear that mate, I guess you got the wrong day and the wrong server.
---
I can assure you, experience generally on every platform is cool and chilled.
---
I'm on of those high level players that love to give things I don't need,  always looking to make the day brighter for low level players.
---
Add me if you need something, I'll be happy to lend an hand: kingpinzero
---
It's not that expensive, you'll find quantums infrequently, but everything else is pretty reliably available.
---
"So it's okay for Raider NPCs to shoot you but no Raider players?" 
---
In a nutshell. Well done!
---
This is really awesome and has lots of potential to become a cozey den.  Maybe try addimg some mounted radstag heads, some cleaner furniture, some new floorings and boom.
---
I’m not aware of bots selling it but it pops up in player vending machines on occasion.
---
Dude the power armor pve junk hoarders are the most toxic POS in this game.
---
I swear half of them are NSM going off their forum posts and BOS Obsession
---
Creative! Love it
---
While true, I can say that every recent monetization that they have added into the game has in one way shape or form been a copy of another monetization ESO has in place (parent company Zenimax). 
---
The Legendary module parts are kind of like the crafting materials needed for making armor in ESO.  If the Module parts were to have an excessive weight .25 per (7.5 lbs per 30), they could be stored (not scrapped however) as a junk item in the scrap box, plus there is the need for large amounts of scrap when crafting.  Both of these are incentive to have Fallout 1st, I feel the benefit from making these would at least equal out the need for Fallout 1st, but thats just me 🤗
---
i would also like the ability to make like prewar food a static item or just any in general so i dont gotta use a stupid bulky display case that has weird ass glass and less limits on camps so i can have a proper cave base and if the area doesnt have a map marker let me build there and let me build closer to map marked areas
---
Just a nod really, if the siren goes off I believe reinforcements are meant to arrive to help the blood eagles already there.
---
I only started playing again a couple weeks ago
---
Yeah, Rockstar games are going to suck going forward because all effort will be on Multiplayer. They've gone full EA
---
I decided to create a new character, ty for answer.
---
they should do an enclave gatling plasma skin too.
---
He’s still around.
---
I found him a couple times during Fasnacht.
---
Did have anything worth buying though.
---
If the game frustrates you so much, why are you still playing it? You can play other games you actually enjoy.
---
Interesting question. I always assumed it was just for show.
---
Exactly my point
---
I'm on the Xbox platform in the US and have not had any problems with the game at all today.
---
I was sort of mad when I first started playing and I realized Power Armor pretty much makes you useless in pvp but it's so easy to opt out and not shoot back at someone or just not stand around in your workshop if you have one
---
Those same people are using hacked fatman and whatnot to crash server. They have hacked weapons (even seen some on xbox) and they expect me to pvp them also knowing there are 3 other guys waiting in a bush.
---
If you want pvp go play Nuclear Winter.
---
I used to be a pvp player but pvp got worse with time to the point were it became unplayable. That's a shame but it's so bad survival had to be removed.
---
Yesterdays downtime and annoyance at missing some scrip is a wonderful reason to reflect on what you might be doing with your time and life.
---
Wait, we can lay claim to firstborns?
---
Clever
---
I love it. My most recent build was a flying pirate ship based off of a lot of other people’s designs.
---
battle royal more like ahhhh stop please im begging you i got over playing fortnite its blan now
---
Is that so? Wow. Cuz half the time I go to wss I see a camp almost right across the tracks by the Little Water tower at the place and I’m so confused how they built so close!
---
With the new changes, you will still get griefed.
---
Me too I really like making it amber colored or blue, was a bit easier on my eyes when I was playing fo4
---
At least now you know to keep all of the gold bullion to yourself. Believe me the prices for the items there are astronomical.
---
What is so outrageous about having tameable and ride able Scorchbeasts?!
---
Supreme cozy
---
i have like 5000 caps or so on one character and i dunno about legendaries on my main
---
Fair point.
---
Upvoting for visibility. Personally I've only seen it during Fasnacht both last year and this year.
---
Well yeah but there are still people who go around and try it some people wont think about it and shoot back. Probably last month I had this level 15 dude just following me around hitting me with a lead pipe. So I just ignored him and looked for the invisible guy who I found on top if my billboard and waved at them.
---
I fee ya. I am only level 225 but have 80 level ups I could use. 
---
Once I found my happy spot with cards/weapons/armor, I have not found a need to change.
---
I’ve wanted this for so long. Literally they could even just take the pistol belt from the light combat armor chest piece and make it wearable separately. I really just want a gear belt :/
---
I mean I love PH on TF2, but we *know* that the game mode works fine in the Source engine. I’m not too sure how well it could be implemented for Creation.
---
Uh pvp can be wholesome without being a dumbed down cookie cutter game mode.
---
In all fairness people have always freeloaded off events
---
Until the loot system is changed, meaning you actually have to participate to get any type of reward, people will freeload
---
Some players do specialize in the fat man the grenade launcher or the missile launcher. But it is definitely not a main weapon.
---
Lmao! mazda size!
---
I love the 10mm for what it is, a fallout classic. But man is it a bug ugly gun lol. Especially with that long barrel and a supressor. I swear its longer than some rifles.
---
You document and block people for killing your virtual cow (that costs almost nothing to respawn)?
---
I see him passing by the wayward quite often. My camp isnt too far from it.
---
have you ever actually seen how restaurant prepares cooks and treat your food before you get it. You may never want to eat out again especially with a fucking cockroaches and flies running around.
---
They are just being polite. People constantly complain about high levels one shotting all the enemies so they were letting you have the opportunity to earn some extra XP and loot getting the kills.
---
And double gold bullion 😀
---
If you’re able/willing to go down there, the scorchbeast queen fight rewards stable fluxes of all kinds when she dies.
---
It’s probably easier than having to farm all the mats yourself if you haven’t done so already as it comes ready to use and silo runs are still pretty common for me to see. 
---
You could hop player vendors but I tend to find players want an unreasonable premium on them mostly because of the potential annoyance/grind factor to make. I’ve seen people wanting 2k each and even then I’ve rarely seen them for sale.
---
Feedback goes completely ignored. Game devs are narcissistic and hate feedback.
---
No problem.  Any gear I hold onto I rename something like *R fixer or *hvw Gatling or something else similar so that all my weapon types (rifles, heavies etc) get grouped together and show up in the pipboy before anything else I pick up.
---
Before I started doing that though I would miss things as well.  If you get 2 weapons that are both "instigating explosive blah blah blahs" it's easy to overlook something.
---
I dunno man. I just went back to FO4 yesterday and decided to make an Institute settlement at Starlight. Gotta say, it was super refreshing not being limited on what I could do with building again. And I’m still not done with that above ground headquarters yet, so...
---
Anyway. If daily scrip and bullion are the only reasons you’re playing 76, I can’t see how you’re having fun. If I have stuff to turn in, sure, I’ll do that. But I won’t go around farming events and legendary spawns just to hit a daily cap.
---
Please don’t pay more 200 caps for this outfit. There are frequently in player vendors for that amount.  I’ll be on later and will give you one, ign is jayfitt
---
To be brutally honest, while downtime sucks, this is probably the first instance of prolonged, unplanned downtime in 76's whole existence.  Even around its rocky launch, it stayed online.
---
And it didn't just affect 76, but Bethesda's online services in general.
---
Covert is a must for sneak builds. If you run bloodied with high agility put on a couple of pieces unyielding armour with ultralight. 5 pieces unyielding each modded to ultralight has the same effect as 3 stars into sneak.
---
VATS gets bugged occasionally.
---
your right it never talks but it also never stops singing
---
I roll in with a 10mm and just tag stuff.  I don’t want to be that guy that takes all the xp and one shot the 3 stars.   But I always help complete the event.  If it looks like everyone is struggling I switch to the one shot.
---
This is exactly right.  They have zero obligation to update this sub.  As long as they're keeping their website up to date as much as possible, that is enough.  That's the source of truth.
---
Gaming companys should treat their stuff as if buying deodorant lift the cap and give it a sniff first.
---
Does he roam on the road in front of the Wayward?
---
I like the idea. 
---
Other possibilities a belt could be used for:
---
-holster: assign a pistol to it, allowing almost immediately swaps to your handgun
---
-ammo belt: holds up to 3 5.56 magazines (4 .38 magazines and so on, different ammo types have different amounts) so you can relaod much faster (for the given amount of magazines) without modding your clip/receiver for the effect
---
-belts would also provide the background for some more "hardcore" mechanics. I personally think that 10 quick accesible favourite items are too much. I would limit quick access to 4 weapons and stimpaks. 1 pistol and 1 single handed melee would be attached to the belt (left and right holster), stimpaks would be attached to the back of the belt. Additionally you are allowed to carry a rifle or 2 handed melee on each shoulder for a maximum of 2 "big" weapons. Pistol only chars could choose to give up one big gun for a chest holster. Each playtype (pistol, rifle, melee) would have access to 2 weapons they are specialised in this way, which sounds balanced for me.
---
Belts had to be crafted to be useable, allowing for difderent designs and bonusses (faster pistol reload maybe). Same with the chest rigs / chest holsters.
---
Im not against battle royal, some are fun, but why fallout ?
---
So Flux is one of those things that many people know about and few people talk about how to get. There are some decent youtube videos about it, but I feel that they kind of go overboard with details.  
---
Crafting Stable (AKA Pure) Flux requires the following 4 components:  
---
\- 10x Raw Flux (Fluorescent, Yellowcake, Crimson, Cobalt, Violet) -&gt; Collected from flora in Nuke Zones. The Green thumb perk helps to double your flora gathering yield
---
\- 1x High Radiation Fluids -&gt; Collected from baddies in nuke zones (except bots, idk...)
---
\- 1x Glowing Mass -&gt; Collected from baddies in nuke zones
---
\- 1x Hardened Mass -&gt; Collected from baddies in nuke zones
---
Be sure to equip the Super Duper park (Luck SPECIAL) for a decent change to double your crafting yield when making stable(pure) flux.
---
As far as what plants yield what flux, you'll figure this out super quickly. The colors make it decently obvious. The only weird ones are Fluorescent (glowing mushrooms) and Cobalt (which you will rarely, if at all, see in the Prime Fissure nuke zone that activates the SBQ fight)
---
Hope that helps!
---
Ya, i sided with foundation so i never really did photos there. Good point
---
I see him at whitesprings OFTEN now
---
I'll be straight with you, I think we're past the point where . . .
---
Actually we thought you guys were the laughing stock for wanting the area of the game with the biggest potential to be removed instead of properly balanced.
---
at the moment I would save what I have and not by anything until update 20 comes out and we know more of what's going on and the secret service armor itself is actually classified if ever.
---
This is the state of the game because Bethesda refuses to dish out any punishment to cheaters and they refuse to reward people who are out there actually participating with a good payout. Instead it's just go grind for weeks on end and maybe you'll get something nice. Fk that most people are over that and are just leeching because the game lets you and because the game is so unrewarding and unfulfilling. How many more times can we do the same 4 events for notes? So we can go buy items with scrip to get a totally random piece that will most likely suck 30+ times. Its not hard to understand.
---
yea fr like its doo doo
---
You’re losing your well fed buff
---
Thanks to them I had to subscribe Fo1st to enjoy my game in peace.   
---
Bethesda 1 - "wAr oN BeTheSdA" 0
---
The one thing it has going for it is that, like Source, its players have an intimate understanding of what's a prop and what's not, since we loot them all the time.
---
That said, it's also a post-apocalyptic world where no one sweeps the floors, and there's a ton of clutter, that you don't have the cleanness of Prop Hunt in a Half-Life 2-style map.
---
No, unfortunately they don’t.
---
I believe it's the lack of deodorant.
---
Which weapon requires flux? I know prime receiver mods do but I've never noticed one needing flux in order to make the actual weapon. Genuinely curious, though I guess I have a lot of plans I've never even considered making.
---
I truly love all the fall out games, but definitely could do without all the bugs bugfesta.  I like meny others have put alot of time and money, money! Into your game and I really don't see the customers coming first, and with any business that is supposed to be your first priority is your customers. You have a great product but maybe you should fix the problems before you release the product. I have heard from many people that the only reason they still play is the people they play with. That's sad. I love this game, but you should have fixed all the problems with your product before you added the wastelanders, now you have some very upset people that are high level that couldn't even do anything with the new content because of a glitch that should have been fixed before adding a new content. They went to get ghool blood and the thing fell into the ground and no matter what they've tried it never fixed it so how unfair to make people start all over because you and your company dropped the ball. I haven't had any issues like they have but to have such good people have to start all over because of miner crap. I think you need to stop telling people to reboot their system or reload the game, because it doesn't work, and find away to make your game play better! And for gods sakes if you don't want people to find ways to mass produce items then don't allow the people that work for you to get on utube and teach people how to do it, or quit getting mad. I'm done paying for you to make me wait to play my own game!
---
You know what the upside to this is, this happens less often than on red dead online’s servers and gta online’s servers, so I’m fine with them being fucked up if it doesn’t happen every week
---
You can buy off player vendors if your lucky enough to find one.  I horde my flux like it’s the apocalypse I imagine most people do.  Or you can go drop some nukes and get it yourself.
---
It's quite common, you can get as a drop for the technical data mission, and usually it's soldin vendors for about 200 or 300 caps
---
Ah that totally makes sense, thank you!
---
Hee hee sounds like you're the baby for not killing them
---
I would not be able to use them anyway. I am always close to my camp budget. 
---
Cant wait for personalized interiors.
---
PS4?  If so I have a “care package” for you!
---
He walked through my camp couple days ago.
---
Biggest potential lol
---
I am a lazy farmer, which is probably why I am so t-note poor. I seek out events that are easy to solo and don’t take a lot of time. Jail Break is my absolute go to whenever it starts. Easy to win, moderately decent XP, mutants drop caps and gunpowder, and plenty of junk in that prison yard to scrap. I also like Heart of the Swamp to give the .50 cal stuff to chew on. Swarm of Suiters isn’t my favorite, but I’ll jump in if nothing better is happening.
---
RDO would be fine if they ever added content but they keep milking the hell out of GTA Online.
---
Holy crap.  Don't visit a lot of vendors anymore but on the rare occasions I did see flux for sale people were always asking like 200 to 300 for them, 2k is nuts.
---
No, they're probably hip firing at the waves of creatures that spawn on the SBQ corpse that you run through to loot her.
---
The fact that you didn't know about the Flux mechanic highlights how infrequently this happens to you.
---
crater for 2 reasons. 
---
1 its the first selected while spamming dialogue.
---
2 three of the potential photo spots are in crater itself (crops, meg and communication equipment) and two of the photo spots are between vault 76 and crater (colonel statue and black bear lodge). so 9 times out of ten you aren't wasting caps or load time fast traveling back and forth
---
Go farm it.  Not hard to get.
---
I got 76 for $8 and I'm not complaining but slightly disappointed lol
---
What platform are you on? If you're collecting them, you can message or reply a fair offer of caps. I'm on xbox and have the father winter helmet just sitting in my stash box.
---
Yes i remember in wow classic when the honor system (what a joke name btw) was introduced without any battlegrounds. Just gangs of people camping flight paths and dungeon/raid entrances. It made the game unplayable for the weaker faction and the main reason i stopped playing. Theres was no PvP involved it was just one side constanty getting pummeled by the other.
---
I actually used to like PvP games in the past but nowadays all people want is a heavy advantage over you and not interested in a fair fight.
---
Weird claim to make when Red Dead single player was fantastic and the Online portion was what sucked.
---
I wouldn't spend anything until after the next major update. Secret service armor has yet to be properly classified and there are several other items that are going to come in along with it, that may be preferable.
---
You’re not wrong in that regard at all. PH in Fallout would definitely be a bit more challenging, sure. I’m really more concerned about actually implementing players as props in this engine. In Source when you crouch, your physics box actually changes to let you go under objects, but in Creation your box stays the same. There’s been more than enough pipes that I should have been able to go though or under in Fallout when crouched that’s I just can’t. Now imagine you’re wooden crate on the floor with your raw height still being that of a normal player.
---
He and Chally have been strolling along the tracks near my camp south of Sunnytop Station a few times. I think I last saw them the day before yesterday. All the meats.
---
Me as a high level player, will mostly stay back and do nothing when there is lots of lower level players around doing the same event. Reason being.. If i start shooting, everything dies, no xp for anyone else, no loot for anyone else, people yell at me. And also, lower level players tend to enjoy doing the events more than me, a player who has seen these events gazillion times. Thus i don't want to take their enjoyment away. All that said.. If i see they are struggling i will help.
---
Do you want people to stay back giving you chance for the loots?
---
Or do you want us to shoot, most likely making you not receive loot?
---
People whine and cry about high levels oneshotting things, and they whine and cry if we stay back.. Make up your mind.
---
EDIT: And no, i'm not gonna waste my limited carry weight and carry extra weapons so i can "tag" stuff and look like i'm doing something.
---
I don't think they are trade able right now. Sounds like a fix may be coming sometime.
---
Yourself, keep all of the gold for yourself. You're doing all the work you're doing all the quests you deserve the rewards.
---
The man running from the chicken
---
Same bug here
---
I've seen him on the road in front of the wayward and the road that leads away from the front of the wayward with the half broken bridge going over the creek.
---
[Ah shit. . .](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1qju6V1jLM)
---
That worked really great on Queen. How does one define what is participating? There are low levels emptying their ammo on Queen and not getting credit.
---
Found the scrubby griefer
---
Exactly
---
sounds like someone is sick of hoarding weapons for top dollar
---
I always figured multiplayer fallout would include pvp.
---
Almost any online game that doesn't offer pvp is shooting itself in the foot by eliminating longevity.
---
I know they can't go in the vending machines as I've tried. Never did try with another player though.
---
Why would you have that much acid on you?
---
That's the boat I'am in, I can only play on Sundays for 2 -4 hours so it will take me forever to just be able to get the armor that I want.  I get the notes  turned in faster then I can make them.  I "trained" someone at my house to log into my account, run up to the gold machine in foundation and turn in any notes that I've built up then log out, unfortunately they aren't quite at the stage where they could do anything to earn extra notes each day :-)...
---
Found him just today. Fast travelled to The Crater and he was right in front of me. Bought some plans and listened to him tell me all this was a dream. Kinda believed him too.
---
Rip to 50 wood. Not like you can go to the Lumber camp and collect 400 in 30 seconds or anything.
---
I have seen reinforcements arrive, it was only 2 more Blood Eagles though.
---
Do x amount of damage to enemies

Interact with a quest object

lol CJ
---

---
Got it, thanks a lot.
---
Ive fought the regular colossus twice now with a 3 man team on private servers.  Not sure if the beefed up the event one from the nuke zone one. Although it was not rewarding (loot wise)  it was a fun fight. Feel like it would be nice not to have to do it in a nuke zone, especially as a vats build. More or n less just looking for a new more challenging fight that doesnt involve a monster flying in circles for 2 minutes at a time 🙄.
---
low level.. you cant beat Leader of the Pack..
---
So you can't even contend when players aren't using "op" gear?
---
No, Bud Light!  (Sorry, 80s humor)
---
Congrats!  The first time is fun but makes you think, "I hope I don't have to do all this every time!"
---
Yea, that is an issue with me as well when fighting the Queen. I have ok weapons at 102 but I do not have a great build. Right now I am in the process of realocating points to improve the build and will hopefully get a bloodied rifle so that I can deal some decent damage. As a result, eventhough I participate and usually use up a bunch of ammo, I usually only get loot off the queen 1/3 attempts.
---
I used to see him by the school in Grafton all the time.  I think it has been two weeks though.
---
I need to find one of these vendors, all I find are nocturnal’s for 8k lmao
---
Ign is marmarz. Just lmk :)
---
Here lies the problem.. Low level are not doing damage. High levels will kill everything, thus low levels are "not participating". And there is no objects to interacts with with most events. And if there is, there are not enough for everyone.
---
No😔
---
Well if Bethesda uses Amazon Web Servers yesterday Amazon got hit with the largest DDoS attack ever recorded. Last week 4 cell phone companies got hit as well and now Australia is under a large cyber attack.
---
Like i said im not a dev. But there has to be a way to reduce the amount of free loading going on
---
They're salty they need to do 16 handshakes to start 4v4 pvp instead of 1 handshake.
---
The people protesting the change are the players who can wipe ***your team*** 1v4
---
Yeah. I mean I wasn’t interested in buying, I have tons from farming recently and doing the queen event, but it definitely made me laugh and make me consider nuking his base 😁
---
Rebuild
---
I did that at level 6.
---
If they find a good way, i'm all up for it.
---
yea rebuild the camp system is ass
---
If you’ve tried all different angles then you may have to rebuild it, if there’s a lot of foundations it can be difficult to place.
---
If you want a camp that is easily playable when you move it then I recommend just using one foundation then stairs up to regular floors and build like that
---
No, but i love the idea!
---
It's a nice idea but they really are so heavy. 
---
I played around with a bunch of mini nukes the other day, it was fun for like 2 then I realised the enemies (whitsprings ghouls) were just wandering through the mini mushroom clouds oblivious. On the 4th mini nuke the fat man broke itself  :/
---
I do it all the time even with high level toons.. gives me an excuse to hit up aarnholdt homestead for cranberries if I havent been near the bog for a while..
---
Competent UI in a Bethesda creation engine game? You've got to be kidding me.
---
Beth needs to really step up. This is a solid suggestion.
---
Early on when game launched Queen was horrible. There were no "need x amount of damage" on her. 20 People would come in, shoot her once to tag her and go to the bunkers to wait/afk. Leaving 1-2 players fight her. While the current system is not perfect (far from it), it is far better than what we used to have.
---
I viewed it as more a means to an end, not a compromise of one’s moral and political ideals. Stopping the scorch plague, needs of the many, yada yada.
---
I saw him the other night get owned by a hermit crab panel truck lol I came to his rescue and we chilled and had Hermit crab cakes and some Quantums...
---
Correct lol
---
Haha no mask for you.
---
Explosive Bait got reported time and time again since the previous fasnacht. It is not their fault that the devs want the bait to kill those bots.
---
LOL I say my toon tripped. Fits my IRL self well, too.
---
Or, I just have never tried to kill someone and loot them after scorched earth. I assumed they were trying to loot flux but if it just disappears then they are just trying to make people lose it.
---
This actually doesn’t happen to me at all because I can tell when I’m being baited but I’ve seen it happen countless times.  a low level goes around whacking people until one takes the bait and then his 3 friends, usually watching like hawks from on top of the fences or tents are waiting to engage. It is not at all uncommon.
---
Just because I don’t do this to people doesn’t mean i couldn’t easily figure out the flux isn’t the obvious reason these people are doing this
---
*accidentally scraps desk fan that was actually a player* "User 'Imnotadesk_fan' killed."

Suprised pikachu face.

Ticket submitted, we will see if I get a response or my GB back...
---
PC always got that good stuff😔
---
Wow... I've been wondering about this for so long. Thank you!
---
I've hit a Mirelurk Queen for 5000 damage, seen its health fall slightly, died, then returned to find it dead and lootable, suggesting I killed it.
---
Oh yeah I forgot about that
---
Or Zax. If any AI could be that sadistic, it would be the Nuclear Winter emcee.
---
SPOILERS
---
Isn’t that just what happens when you fight something? Kill it fast, kill it after a long time or fail not killing it, those are the only things that you can do in a boss fight. I found the event too easy when it was initially released, killing it every time or even before I got there, after they buffed it I thought it was better and the battle felt like a boss, but still as long as your with a group it’s about as guaranteed as the SBQ fight. 
---
A real warning is about how server taxing it is, not only all the effects that go on in the room all the falling debris and solid moving objects like drills but the infinite wendigos were causing large amounts of lag for a lot of people especially when the entire PTS server is doing the event, It could easily cause a crash. Not to mention the respawn bug that still occurs sending you out of the boss arena before the event ends effectively locking you out if you don’t know where to go, and even if you do find the side path, the never ending wendigos can still spawn there so beware. All in all it’s fun but I can see why they delayed it.
---
That's legit cozy. Just imagine walking in there after a long day of beating up super mutants and rad roaches.
---
Also lots of lead on a run there.
---
About an hour and a half. Kept fighting the endless waves of robots.
---
Yes. 4 for you, and 4 for each member of your team.
---
Are you saying that you cannot solo events, and are thus mad at the others who have joined the event but aren't actively helping by participating?
---
Also, failing the event intentionally will deprive them of getting a reward they were there for. Of course, it will also mean you dint get the reward.
---
if your a high level and have a decent group radiation rumble is good
---
also nuke silos
---
Thank you. I know. Going to have to look up how to be more efficient with my time!
---
For the gauss shotgun got the plans from foundation and got the prime receiver mod but it needs flux 😕
---
Level 30-45 were the worst. I’d suggest looking for a discord server. Ours is for Xbox, and focuses on queens and events, but I’m sure a discord community on PC would help you out with some general stuff.
---
No, but I get that quite often too, on my bloodied character I often die just walking down stairs because somehow I was accumulating fall damage
---
Thanks for all the help much appreciated 🙏
---
You sure about that?

Thank you for making me read my post to make sure I didn't post a typo

I swear we had mats that did that in the beta didn’t we? Am I misremembering?

Mr. 5 x 5.

Whenever my guns glitch on ps4 they usually glitch and stay zoomed in until I hit zoom again or it just won't fire until I holster it and reequip it

They don't follow these simple tips though, which is hilarious
---
If you go south of hunters ridge (along the river on the far left of the map) there is a settler that will give you 60 wood if you talk to her
---
Literally put woodchucker* perk on and hit the lumber Mills
---
This is so creative, I love it!
---
Wouldn't you like Faction based objectives and conflict for public events? That's what you're missing.
---
What's the point of base destruction mechanics if nothing can destroy your camp or workshop?
---
No but moving your actual camp module in your buidlable area will move where you spawn
---
In my base destroying my stash box
---
I don’t think so, but I’ll check when I get on ton that. I’m pretty sure it resolved after I went through the DMV again and went back up. I definitely had to redo some things though.
---
Can you get from the ground outside the crater to inside the cave in tanagra? That would be my metric for it being worth it.
---
Everyone build extra fusion reactors.
---
Woodchucker perk, you will get a ton of wood. And to add to that, if you interact with the robots around the mill they will give you wood as well.
---
Sylvie and Sons Logging Camp + woodchucker perk under luck.  This is next to Sons of Dane compound (slightly to the right of it).  This location along with the huge wood stack at Helvetia behind the food house with double wood gains from woodchucker should net you over 500 wood.
---
Just fyi.  If you prime it then in order to make ammo you will need more flux for crafting.  Best not to prime a weapon until you are endgame and do the queen/nuke zones on the regular.  Every time you craft a batch of ammo you will need one flux.
---
Ammo for primed weapons is called ultracite ammo and shows up in a different tab than the rest of the ammo crafting.
---
Nah, just cringe.
---
Thank you
---
I hope the rest of the standard mods come out then too. Looking at deep pocketed.
---
I’m not trying to slam it -  I’m not the fat fat cat type you point out - I have not finished WL, so I don’t earn T-notes.  I’m also high enough level that Double XP for leveling is immaterial.
---
 But like OP, only so much time I can give to the game.  
---
Your idea of extra caps/script sounds reasonable - both are useful no matter what level you are - For the people that have finished WL, The extra caps can be turned in for bullion. For those that haven’t, plans, weapons, etc.
---
Thus the incentive of exclusively T-note bonus weekend is useless - it would be  just another day in the wastes for a large number of players.
---
And all this 'war' has the potential to do is get the tards running it banned. If even that.
---
I doubt anybody at bethesda, besides Valseek and LadyDevann, even know about this temper tantrum.
---
yes we did also in private worlds at work shops i was able to spawn them but not a my camp
---
It happens lol
---
Yup I'm going to kill you with my dev room paddle ball
---
I would say player vendors but that may have been in the plans all along.
---
I'm at work right now, but if you go to the area in the toxic valley, just north west of the butterfly on the map, there is a forest that was completely wiped out. You can scavenge a few hundred wood a minute there. I use a lot of wood cooking and that's where I go when I'm in a pinch.
---
Really I’ll have to check that out
---
Time to ditch that flair bud
---
Im in love!
---
I’ve come to the conclusion that all 5 allies (Beckett, Sofia, Forager, Punk, and Wanderer) draw from a common quest pool to either go kill something, go rescue someone, or retrieve a weapons case. I cannot tell if there is any sort of pattern as to the quest variety, but likely pure RNG.
---
He moved to the Rusty Pick
---
This was the fasnacht argument. Damned if you do, damned if you don’t. I personally keep a 10mm pistol for low lvl events and uranium fever. Not spect for pistols it takes a magazine to kill a mob and two and a half for a legendary.
---
Yeah it's pretty cool. If you see some tunnles going under a road you've gone too far south. Good luck
---
Thank you everyone for the advice that’s all very helpful, I don’t have the time to grind like I used to
---
Unfortunately you learn unless you have a real modular camp, like the forts now and shack, moving it is a rebuild.  It is why many of us stay longer in one spot as you need a good 4-5 hours to get a new spot set up.  With so little time to play I don’t want all of it doing that.  On a long weekend sometimes I do it as I know I have the time.
---
She lives in the rusty pick now near the Charleston building I believe
---
You gotta experiment with game mechanics more and you'll learn a lot of useful information
---
THANK YOU :)
---
Viagra?
---
Prep the complaint post copypasta for the week of June 28th, noted.
---
yes.. launcher doesnt matter.. just that youre both on PC
---
I feel you there. It takes way too long to launch nukes the way they intended...
---
Also should add that I think the wastelanders plans currently don't unlock their respective ultracite ammo type. They didn't mean for that to happen and say they will address it later.
---
In order to unlock the ammo right now you will need to get the plans for a prime gauss rifle receiver.   You will either need to buy from another player or do the scorchbeast queen over and over until she drops you the plans.
---
I don't think they have the tools to find out why servers crashed. Bans are extremely doubtful.
---
Communication is good but I dont really think we need the reason its not gonna change anything but ETA would be nice.
---
Yup!
---
Much appreciated
---
hence "if that". It'd rely entirely on people reporting
---
For high levels I suggest nuked whitesprings, monster mash, AWOL armaments, and one violent night.
---
If you just need scrip, throw in uranium fever.
---
It happens for every event that rewards for participation. Fasnacht and Mischief Night are probably noticed more due to the blatant AFKer's slowly spinning around, but it happens all over the place.
---
Not just private worlds. Using that mat on any public workshop also sets the spawn point.
---
Good one
---
Just like the protests in real life, nothing will get fixed if we don't hop on the devs for making stupid shit brain decisions and ignore glaring issues.
---
Rose isn’t but ok
---
I'm more of a rifles and pistols person, in past fallouts i loved to sneak a lot, i'll do some searches, thanks!
---
camp location
---
Yeah, this has happened to me a few times. As well as said enemies blowing up like Legendary Robots, even if they weren't robots.
---
Sad that the fear of them being used in trap camps keeps these from being usable for us.
---
Only the Wastelander Dailies rewards Treasury Notes (Davenport, Raider, and Ward) They also only give 2-3 TNs each, so a max of 9. The other dailies don't reward TNs.
---
Sometimes this happens...those stimpack needles are pretty sharp and lying all over the wasteland.  While it wouldn’t seem like someone would drop one on purpose, occasionally an enemy will walk over one that was left on the ground.  I would imagine it feels like a splinter to a queen mirelurk.  But that is how I envision it happening when I see it.  
---
As far as mutating, I am not sure if this was the end of the line for any of these creatures.  You could be witnessing the missing link between the queen mirelurk of today and the queen mirelurk of tomorrow.
---
You probably finished the last BoS quest, besides the plans for it the reward is a full set of ultracite PA in your inventory.
---
How is this even possible ... 🤔
---
I’d be down, any rules in place?
---
Man I usually buy on Tuesday and I waited until today and still nothing. If I were able to buy from him I could afford the Jetpack today. Such a bummer. 
---
Someone on another thread said wait a whole another week and check back on saturday after 8pm est when he resets. So I guess I am gonna have to wait 8 days.
---
she moved when wastelanders dropped
---
Impressed good work!
---
I've noticed after the sirens are hit, attack dogs show up.
---
You can also buy flux for caps over on the market sub, generally at 150 per (200 per for violet). It's a pretty straight forward transaction since you'd be dealing with caps. Just be specific in your posting for how many you need and how much you're offering for each.
---
I found if I kill the enemy during this green glowing mutation stage which has to be fairly quick they will drop a starred item.
---
So there's a lot of maybes in this thread.
---
Theoretically, the max charisma you would need with modifiers would be 16. With hard bargain 3 (+9 ch), that's 25. That's for the absolute best buying prices from vendors. The absolute best for selling to vendors is 20 ch.
---
You can get an underarmor lining which gives +3 charisma. And you can get a charisma +1 for each armor slot, so that's another +5. So +8, which is +17 with hard bargain 3.
---
Additionally, you will be selling to vendors much more often than you buy, so really you are ok with just hitting the 20ch cap for selling prices. So effectively you only need 3 base charisma to hit the 20 limit. Any time you want to buy from vendors, eat a grape mentats for +5 to hit the 25 cap.
---
The only time this becomes problematic is if you are running a Junkies addict build which gives you -ch to certain drug addictions and you'll have to adjust accordingly. But that info should give you a good base.
---
Indeed, although I don't know if that's an actual limitation of Creation, or just for simplicity's sake.
---
I'm assuming you've been a way for a whIle soooo WELCOME BACK
---
I'm very sure.
---
Rad.

The problem isn't PVP it is the Jerks who ruined it for everyone. The people who were so douchey that is got taken away from them, like a child. Because Survival Mode wasn't enough and those same douches would come to Adventure Mode and murder people for fun. Those people don't deserve \_\_\_\_\_\_.
---
However, I love PVP. If you wanna have fun PVP experience Come to my private server. It is only 8 people, but we have a great time. No junk stealing, no griefing, just good clean murder. Low on caps no worries we return them at the end. We base it on skill and kills. Sometimes I put up a cool piece of Armor or a cool Weapon as a prize or we all pitch in on cap grand prize.  
---
Make your own fun. Use your imagination.
---
You're not really a wendigo. Time to ditch that flair, bud.
---
No my gt is mister mxyzptix message me I'll invite when I'm on
---
Moving your camp can allow you to place everything in a fully repaired condition. 
---
Depending on how elaborate your camp is this could be easy or impossible. 
---
Otherwise I can provide materials to make repairs but I won’t be on for several more hours.
---
Yes, there will be corrections and additions to the things participle with gold bullion. There are some YouTube videos of players on the PTS servers and some of them have been quite informative.
---
Ypu should be able to fix everything (if you have the materials needed) by finding you actual camp object and looking at it.
---
It will give you the option to fix it all, however you do need to have the materials. It will tell you everything you need.
---
Idk but someone is having a terrible day.
---
Sorry for the late reply.
---
Once you get to know you way around the silo it gets quicker.
---
Wihut any cheats/glitches ts about15 min. Here is what I do.
---
1 first step get the the first doors ( 3min)
---
2. Lockpick/ hack the reactor room doors (3 min)
---
3. Mainframe cores. ( 5 min)
---
I always care 20 repaired cores on me. Also Cary a exploding weapon for the destroy the cores room.
---
4. Launch prep (5-6 min)
---
Strait forward clean out the original mobs/ turrets. And start the prep.
---
Yes you need a nuke card for each silo, every time I see a escort and the bot flying around I kill them for cards. I usually keep 20 on me and 20+ in the stash.
---
Your right about that haha!
---
Ok
---
I tend to bounce back and forth between private and public servers. Workshops can be great assets if you’re low level and struggling to get your hands on basic resources. There are usually better ways to get them, but if you only have a limited amount of time or don’t feel like farming, it’s easy to just capture a workshop and drop a few resource pumps while you’re leveling or doing other things. I almost exclusively do this in private to avoid competition. I’d be happy to show you my farming spots for the essentials or give you a hand when you need it. I’m around pretty frequently. My IGN is Lianthis. Feel free to DM me here and I’ll give you my discord handle as well, if you’d like.
---
You have to finish the Raider quest line for the vendor that sells the plan to open up.
---
You don't lose reputation if you double-cross the faction.
---
The robot near meg
---
That’s really helpful. I’m likely to be buying more than selling on this particular build as I’m aiming to use it to help people buy things cheaper than otherwise possible. Especially things like MODUS’ stock for power armor mods and such
---
The mr handy inside crater
---
Newbie here: what is TSE and why a nerf? :)
---
That’s mine, give it to me ASAP. I also lost any aluminum and screws you might have. Gt otannehill on xbox
---
You cannot get to allied or buy bullion items until after you finish the story and vault raid.
---
Sounds like you just finished the quest for Rose to get to meet the raiders.   You have weeks of doing dailies before you can buy the minigun.
---
That’s unfortunate that I got to finish the quest line to get it, thanks
---
IIRC the mention of it was literally patched out of the patch notes. It was then they started referring to it as a bug.
---
youll lose some rep for not sharing.. 
---
some people value the gold more than the small rep loss..
---
whatever you decide youll still be able to max rep with both factions
---
I don't know what to make of this response.
---
I never crafted it, I’m not even a PA build.
---
Yes, but also events do. I only play 2 hours or so a day and make about 20. I've got loads backed up from Fasnacht.
---
Lmao.
---
So I hear you and have seen this true in many videos, but I routinely spawn at different points in my camp even though I never move that module.  Is this just for camps on flat ground maybe?  And this is on private or public server...which I add because I originally thought it could be spawning based on that plus the local wildlife or other players.  But it didn’t seem to make a difference.  No big deal to me, was just curious if you had any advice.
---
I kill and eat everything I see
---
then why cant we just have them at our camps i dont want people spawning behind my camp
---
Trolling people in game, in no way, gets on the devs about anything.
---
It might make people complain about server stability more. Not PVP restrictions though.
---
Bs where?
---
Time to light the fire!!!
---
It gives it to you. But it just says its a power armor chasis.
---
I display masks. Been burned too many times.
---
I wish we could. The theory is that players will put these in places to trap and kill visitors.
---
Read again. It's a quest reward you got.
---
You barely see any pistol users in this game. It's mostly heavy guns, rifles, melee then pistols. 
---
Hunting rifle is powerful but soooo slow to reload.  Combat rifles do slightly less damage but fire and reload faster than a hunting rifle.
---
lol nice
---
It got them to introduce this new rule.
---
Too bad they went with this instead of finishing pacifist mode.
---
That works too. For me, the recipe for grape mentats is so incredibly easy to farm with chemist and super duper, that I went the mentats route. Even using a few every day, I still have enough to always list in my vendor.
---
Easy answer: holster you god tier weapons so you don't obliterate everything. I drop to a basic fixer to avoid stealing legendaries in events.
---
Thank you :)  Have a great day !
---
Bruh moment
---
Thank you very much :)
---
Thank you so much :)
---
Thank you :)  Appreciate the help !
---
Love huffing those fumes!!!
---
Adorable :)
---
What level are you if you don't mind me asking? I'm 109 atm and haven't launched a nuke. My build is crap and I seem particularly vulnerable to robots. I have no desire to spend 3 hours being murdered by robots, should I bother?
---
If you walk the roads you will see him every now and again, he likes to stick to the highways, particularly up north it seems for me.
---
Haha do you have any idea what it's purpose is?
---
I think I remember seeing one in the Ash Heap too, so I assume it's a random encounter, and can be encountered in set locations all over the map.
---
yes
---
It's a random encounter
---
That looks amazing!
---
Ohhhh damn good point
---
Thank youuuuuuuu!!!
---
Ammo
---
I prefer G2’s catch phrase from Inspector Gadget 2: 
---
"Stop this felonious and unlawful act or I shall have to use force!"
---
Armor
---
Come to my vendor and find a complete skeleton, handcuffs, Freddy Woods KidSecure ID and Curse of the Wendigo.
---
Maybe write something on the wall like 'New players message me for help' or something to that affect. And then you can whip them up some armour and weapons. 
---
or put them in a vending machine with like a 1 cap price and hope some level 421 clownshoe comes along and buys them
---
Two shot explosive, used to be extremely overpowering and broken
---
If you're doing swimming you may as well get them to die in water
---
Nothing beats uranium fever.
---
257,000 users, many paying for FO1st.
---
BGS has lacked in it's communication recently with issues like the vendors being down and fastnacht, now with an issue preventing people from using the service they paid for, BGS could try communicating more, and this would be a good opportunity.
---
BGS knowing that there's a quarter million people here means that it's a good spot to share updates as well.
---
I play a melee build on one character (decided to try that low skill bloodied build everyone hates) but still pick up ammo like on my main. Now I reverse rob people. I walk up to people with guns and ask “hey, do you like that gun?” If they say yes, I immediately drop 500+ rounds for the gun, get up real close, then whisper “you just got reverse robbed” then run away. I think there are nice people out there, but it sometimes takes a bit of a nice thing to go their way before they open up. One day a dude gave me a decent bloodied death claw gauntlet after I have him ammo, so now I also ask if people are looking for junkies guns and give them that as well as ammo. It’s a bit of a pay it forward system.
---
See I'm the complete opposite to this guys experience, say about 7 days in of light casual play, I was out pissing about and I got invited to team buy a higher level, they took and showed me a few places which was cool then I said thanks and logged, when I came back the next day my whole camp was full of good shit 2 x large generators a new clean bed , stove and a manner of other things, I've also not seen any trolling or griefing, well only once 2 doods turned up bought some stuff then hung around far too long looking fishy, Soooooo.. I kinda opened up on them killed one super quick but the other was harder and was getting the better of me, so I jumped off my escape cliff and scarpered while they wrecked my camp, he didn't kill me:) but I do rock TSE 50.cal and PA so don't get much trouble :)
---
I real life if would kill you LOL.  I am assuming just another interesting point on the map like carhinge up north on the map.
---
I love this idea SO MUCH !!!
---
i can give you like... 300?
---
I'd do it, I'm in US though.  Add me the\_grimbot and shoot me a message if you see me on!
---
Haha there's a car hinge? Haven't seen it yet also yea it's just an unmarked location for the gassy pipe
---
That's a good point.  I just need to revive someone really, but have done swimming, athlete, mammalogist and herpetologist.  just need to repair crossbow for archery, but damn thing wont break, ....three times.....
---
Wish I had the will power to do something like that
---
Pipe is life
---
Thanks mate, i'm quite new to PS4, do I use the PS4 message to add you.
---
Even if you don’t know the plans to build a certain object, like someone placed it at your camp for you, you can repair it if you have the resources. So you don’t need to move and it won’t cost any caps.
---
Sorry about the decontamination arch though, I know materials are hard to come by for that.
---
I've never found a legendary
---
I’m 190 ish on my main, which is a junkies explosive heavy, and 140 ish on my alt, which is a junkies explosive commando... are you interested in learning the easy way?
---
Not gonna discuss my method because im sure piracy isnt allowed and I dont want to get banned from the Fallout 76 subreddit.
---
Yeah, then I can login for half as long each day.
---
Ha!! I have no idea. Probably someone has tried
---
if they want to make it still a bit of a grind, make it so you can only trade them to someone who has unlocked the plan for it.
---
Yes.  Car hinge is in the northeast area of the map.  I want to say it is between the munitions factory and the camp from the photo opportunity quest
---
Oooo I love that, that would be so much better
---
I am so sorry that you are being forced against your will to pay that subscription 😩
---
The clownshoes are my biggest concern, lol.
---
I don’t want to dump a bunch of material into making stuff that someone is just going to scrap for plans, you know? Like I have no problems throwing in prototype hazmat suits in a vendor for nothing, but beyond that I’m just not sure how to minimize abuse.
---
Bruh I deck out low levels. I literally come to their camp, give them stuff, stims, radaway, clothes, weapons ammo and invite them to team to give them caps. Even give them fusion generators and rare plans
---
says can't send friend request because of recipients settings.
---
Interesting
---
In my game a ran the vault raid with  the Raiders. I assisted a friend in their vault raid and they chose the setters, so I got to participate in them both. 
---
The Raiders to me were just more fun. And as characters they are more interesting overall and it just feels like Bethesda put more effort into the raiders. 
---
The game's  raider focus is something that has bugged me about the game since launch. You see it everywhere, in the game,  and in the Atomic shop stuff.  The raider bundles often just look way cooler and are a way better  overall value. 
---
EXAMPLE: The raider scabber bundle came with a really cool power armor skin, back pack skin, head wear, an outfit, and raider flags. I bought all of that for 1200 atoms. 
---
The responder bundle came with a lot of the same stuff- except the power armor skin for responders was sold completely separate as a stand alone item for 1500 ATOMS!
---
Also the Queen scales to the amount of players involved in the fight not the level of the players so if you get too many lowbies there leeching a too high event it takes fooking ages to kill the queen and is just a waste of ammo/resources.
---
Are you planning to become the King of the Pirates?
---
I bet you made one. I did the same. You can find one at the tempt of winding thingymajiggs. it has no extra condition bar so it'll probably need repairing straight away. ALSO! Bashing damage does more damage to the crossbow apparently.
---
See?! Just cos 1 person isn't nice to noobs doesn't mean everyone is :( I enjoy adopting noobs :)
---
Does choosing one side over the other have any major effects on the game other than rep?
---
I guess if you can't seem to fix it, you could put it on a new chassis and try that. Just an idea
---
Yeah.  It is pretty cool.
---
Really need as limiter on vending machines. Like only players under level 10 can buy certain things.
---
The settler with the broke down robot. Give her a fusion core to help her fix it.
---
Oh, thank you for the explanation. Makes sense.
---
yeah, made one and got extra durability too due to weapon artisan (or whatever) lol
---
Burn him! Burn him! Burn him!
---
No problem
---
Say in uranium fever I just don't bother tagging the legendary s  that spawn and just leave it to the lowbies, Coz ya know I don't really need another 1 star rolling pin Woop!
---
It got taken down... I saw it this morning and now it is gone.
---
I believe the theory of the scaling health / resistances was debunked months ago (or early 2019 actually). And that people only thought she scaled.
---
EDIT: Here is one post talking about it https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/bbuz2r/psa_scorchbeast_queens_health_does_not_scale_with/
---
EDIT2: That's just one of those things that has remained as a rumor and has been spread from mouth to mouth. Even to this day.
---
I'm vaguely specced for shotty but have issues keeping supplied with ammo for them. Frequently switching perks cards around and using a diff weapon that I have ammo for. Would absolutely be interested in an easy way, you on PC by chance?
---
Your current radiation doesn't matter, it only heals you when you take rad damage. And tenderizer works on melee and guns.
---
&gt;vipasoft
---
Crap, forgot about that.  I was getting spammed so I locked it down.  I just added you
---
I leave everything unlocked-- collection station, water purifiers, etc. I have more junk than I can store in my stash without the stash box, and I have more water than strictly necessary, so I don't lock and hoard my stuff. (I do lock it during Present season with the Santatron, but that's pretty much it.)
---
So, new player, old player, low level, high level... Whatever. Need some crap? Free crap aplenty, and cheap crap in the vending machines.
---
At this time there’s not much to do with a pandemic going on
---
dont even give it that much respect, alt f4, get the grunt of hate and get your desktop
---
Mmm, that burning rubber smell. Just like mom used to make!
---
I wish those concrete tires would come back, I never got them 😢
---
I’ve seen him 4 times recently. Once by the white spring train station, once by aaronholt homestead, twice just about to stroll through the entrance to foundation just as I had fast travelled there.
---
Awesome. Tyvm. I cannot seam to find any info on NW that isnt a year old
---
I recently found him at "Foundation". Funny thing was... I HEARD him after teleporting there... Ran around like a headless chicken and found him right under the bridge in the dump sea :D
---
Thanks mate.  If you could drown or something, that would do for the swimming badge too.  ha ha.
---
Also id recommend getting 2 friends together
---
no room in storage for it.
---
If all else fails, try tagging along with a low level.  They will be likely be downed at some point - revive them.  I’ve saved several in and around Morgantown Airport and collision course.
---
you'd be better off finding one then. it took me like an hour to break mine
---
With ghoulish, lets say you have 300 hp normally.  You are currently at 100 rads (200 remaining hp) and only 50 hp left.  If you are taking radiation damage you will heal, Ex. if you gain 50 rads (150 rads total), you will gain missing hp up until you hit your max hp minus radiation damage.  If your hp is full while gaining rads you won't heal.  Your current radiation does not go away with ghoulish and you don't heal past your current rads.
---
Is this a troll? Can you actually rebuild camp items after moving it without storing them first?
---
Haha is that a one piece reference? Sorry I'm more of a  POTC type pirate :P
---
Hello. If I were you, I would hop servers. If that doesn’t work, just remove all of your pa pieces and put them back on. Lastly, I would manually transfer the fusion core from the pa transfer menu and try again. Hope this helps.
---
if you dont mind me picking your brain a bit but I am just curious if there are any specific builds I should be aware of (both to use and to defend against) and would you be kind enough to give feedback on the cards I am thinking of running?
---
:( I'm not an asshat smh
---
This is what I used
---
https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Addiction
---
I use junkies rifleman build and have
---
Alcohol, med-x, daddy-o, day tripper, and mentas.
---
I saw him about a month ago at Hemlock Holes golf course, and then again during Fastnacht heading away from Helvetia.
---
Yes...launched my first one at lvl 60 or 70...and didnt know what a build was at that time.
---
 It will take you a minute the first time- be prepared for a long battle and getting lost in the silo a lot. Just make that your goal for ur play session...after doing it 3-4 times u will be as good as any of the rest of us.
---
Human npcs
---
Most of the time majority of mobs are dead before I even get a tag so really I dont bother showing up to most events till 7+mins unless theyre hard difficulty.
---
“Of course, that doesn’t mean you cant find a nice lvl 126 guy”
---
I was doing other things I wasn’t just standing there. And I’m obviously not playing just for the gold and scrip but A big part of the endgame grind requires those two currencies so missing out on collecting them delays the grind
---
Ty.  That i knew. Been running it for a few days and figured out that.  I run bloody build in adventure so am ONLY comfortable when my health bar is mostly red 😜
---
If you move your camp it stores most things as blue prints. If they were broken when you moved you’re camp it will place the items fully repaired in your new location.
---
I'd rather not communicate with this subreddit if I was Bethesda. All they would expect is toxic backlash that does not help at all with problem solving. Cause that's what's been happening here for the last year and a half
---
Your welcome... the world needs more LOL' s.
---
It stores them automatically and blueprints the larger bits it can. It restores everythings health ehike it's at it.
---
He passes right by my shop near summerville about once a week, in fact he has to go around my shop as I seemed to have built on his pathing route, but only last Saturday ( I played all day) I must have bumped into him like 6-7 times, always hear him doing the bubba shrimp thing but with meat instead :P
---
FR! I was thinking the same thing
---
Yes that's correct. I've found it twice in two different locations and when I went back to one of them the pipe was gone
---
Turn on damage numbers in the options and you'll see you're getting it.
---
Yeah that makes sense, although it would be good to hear from them what they are planning to do to remediate going forward. Another spekulative root cause could have been that they had issues rolling out their 2FA, which I believe coincided with these outages. 
---
Anyhow, think it would be dumb on their end to not share especially if these outages persist.
---
Yeah ik but not the majority of us. Yeah fair chunk but most of us are either kind to do these stuff or they don't give a shit about low levels. They don't go out of their way to be a dick
---
Comments like this are legit funny. You can't 1 shot full health in pvp.
---
I'm not going to say pvp is balanced atm especially high level pvo but it never hurts to at least learn the issues before weighing in.
---
I did ever since sneak attack stopped and the numbers aren’t what they should be. I’m getting base standard damage with my gun.
---
Yeah, one of the first gauntlets I got was a bloodied power attack... On my full health junkies build. And I still haven't got a junkies fss yet. I actually started using it from time to time to try out a low health build, but it would be nice to trade some of the spares.
---
Gold is easier to get then reputation, I’d split the gold but that’s just my opinion.
---
Equip contractor 2, for starters.  This greatly reduces the cost of rebuilding. 
---
Find your camp device and select repair all.  If you are short, It will tell you what mats you need.
---
In edit mode pan around and look for yellow/orange outlines of things that should be there but are not.  (Those are things that were completely destroyed.)  If you have the mats, you can rebuild them on the fly.  
---
Ditto items that are still visible, but need to be repaired.
---
If you had crops, scrap them.  You’ll get both the harvest and fertilizer, so you should be able to immediately replant them.
---
It actually increases your health for a while lol, check your active status after you use the pipe. Pipe is life.
---
Ha ha! It's funny because it's true!
---
You should always appear to the north east of the module. Try to have that area empty.
---
Update 20 or just the public teams?
---
Just died accidently, had to respawn at Vault 76, game stutters... Crash. Goodbye Junk.
---
Just pick up the one at the shooting range and bash some scorched with it. It doesn't have to break, it just needs enough damage to be able to be repaired.
---
One Piece does exist!!! I believe in you!
---
I found mine in the mire on death road. Was a weird high, man, and I ended up eating my entire stack of corn soup afterwards for some reason.
---
Followed by brainless Bethesda circle jerk.
---
Hmmm tried that but no dice. 
---
What’s weird is that there is no fusion core in the power armor inventory, but when I try to store a core from my main inventory into my PA, it doesn’t do anything. Pressing the Store button literally does nothing. 
---
https://i.imgur.com/OqAhEIw.jpg
---
Collection station actually isn’t a bad idea
---
Yeah some bull happened in the Wendigo Cave where a two star glowing mirelurk king wasn't one shotting me with melee attacks but with those stupid sonic blasts. The melee didn't take even 20% of my health out but the sonic blast killed me twice in one shot while I was at 98% health and I even have legendary armor equipped with poison resistance so it made no sense really. I got downed once and revived with Life Saving armor then I died and came back and for some odd reason the sonic blasts were only doing like 30% of my health when I came back to get my loot. Talk about a buggy ass game (with a big "no shit" from all the other bugs) but this just reinforces it. I get if they're supposed to be somewhat difficult to kill but not even getting a chance due to one shotting ranged attacks you can't dodge that's just complete bs.
---
That is some real Vault Dweller  determination at it's finest, right there.
---
Ah, a Bethesda newbie.
---
thank you so much dude!
---
I've had the issue sometimes, I don't exclusively use rifles though. Maybe try sneak attacking with a non rifle gun and see if that fixes it, I haven't needed to test any fixes because mine normalises after a bit.
---
I aim to please
---
Hope to encounter more people like you!
---
Everything crossed out on the [Bethesda Plz wiki-page](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/wiki/bethesdaplz).
---
&gt; The Bethesda Plz Wiki is a collection of oft-repeated, well-received suggestion posts for Bethesda, as a studio, to improve or change the game. 
---
This is community-driven and you can suggest additions to the list if they fulfill some conditions.
---
I just want stuff You can display to not take up camp budget, displaying all my collections takes up like 50% of my budget and then I have to be really frugal with the rest and get VERY imaginative to make the rest look nice and homely, they encourage us to buy all this stuff from the store but now i've stopped as I cant use it without scrapping something else, I have only enough budget to place 1 floor tile, which I keep for the stupid daily, BTW my camp is not large by any means compared to some who make massive buildings but put jack shit in them coz budget...
---
I have similar issues on pc. Bugs me so much
---
The hamster died. :(
---
They absolutely should both do a root cause analysis and provide a write up to the community. That said, they should have done that for a number of blunders (both at the time of the game's launch and since then). Remember this is the studio that:
---
- Reintroduces bugs and reverses and re-implements balance changes at a rate that I would describe as "routine". This indicates a lack of proper regression testing and is likely symptomatic of broken version control systems (hard to know if it's a software issue or user error from outside).
---
- Takes an eternity to fix issues with the game, even when the community provides detailed lists of issues, often along with exact instructions on how to fix the issue (e.g. object ids in the game files).
---
- Didn't implement a user-accessible test server until a year after the game launched. Took several more months to open it up to all PC users.
---
- Saw reports of a bug from the PTS but couldn't replicate it internally, so instead threw up their hands and put a bugged update into the production environment anyway.
---
Their processes do appear to be improving over time, but at such a glacial pace I wouldn't expect proper communication on technical matters at the level you want (and deserve) for years. Which is hilariously incongruent with the technical sophistication of Bethesda's user base: their games have some of the largest and most capable modding communities out there.
---
You can with that gas mask with goggles and it's just a reskin of that so I would assume so.
---
About 50/50 for me some servers are so slow I might stand and wait 30-60 seconds just watching my camp slowly pop into existence. I have good fibre net and computer so not a problem at my end.
---
&gt; Typical for online services...
---
Maybe I haven't been looking in the right places, but where do you see those?  I can't seem to google up any comparable examples.
---
I think the amount of healing is on a per rad base, so a nuke zone without Rad X should heal you faster than the Ring of Fire. The basic script behind the perk should be the same in both adventure and NW, so it can be easily tested by watching the HP numbers in the Pip-Boy in different circumstances.
---
Update 20 includes teams!
---
Tenderizer works with any weapon type. (Specifically, any damage triggers it.)
---
If you're on ps4, I'll repair it for you mate.
---
But that's part of the problem. If you don't log in every single day, you miss gold and scrip. As it is, it takes almost a full year's worth of daily gold turn-ins to get all the gold plans. They need to put it on a weekly allotment instead. That way you can play one day a week and still get your quota in. As it is, it demands daily attention.
---
I'd rather take pics of the settlers generator and the lake below foundation and give them to Kyomi than to have to talk to Ward one more time. I mean you could actually give them to Davenport, but then you don't get to have him yell at you indignantly.
---
Where is your camp?
---
Ty.  Was reading it this morning in game and the exaxt wording almost sounded like you needed to melee it to activate (like for real tenderizing a steak, bullets only give you meat flavored swiss cheese).
---
I like how the rug really ties the room together.
---
It’s known that after the last patch (not the recent outage) that players vendors and displays work then one day they will be emptied and all your stuff moved to your stash box.
---
Redo the vendors and stash and all should be fine. 
---
https://reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/h7avr5/display_cases_disabled/
---
He comes by my camp near top of the world every couple of days.
---
Just find the camp placement item (the thing with the little light that folds out when you place your camp) and click on it. It will give you the option to repair everything in your camp. You will need the resources to repair everything though.
---
And they are usually selling over priced rubbish to noobs too !
---
I mean they had rideable dragons in Skyrim...
---
If its strictly to those and the PvP is balanced without the use of legacy or OP bullshit, maybe, if not then I'm not missing out on much
---
Had that happen a few weeks ago. I have 10 "bad" cores in my inventory. Drop em and get new cores.
---
Ah weird. Okay thanks. I’ll try that.
---
So cozy!
---
Only, there is a never ending supply of gold and scrip. And so you miss one day, and you have to wait an extra day for whatever you were working towards.
---
It's a video game and there's nothing you can say that will make me think that having to wait a day longer is worst thing in the world. 
---
Sorry, nope. To bad.
---
You can do both sides quests leading up to the raid and acquire all the items, including the stealth armor.
---
as long as you do not START one of the "Siding with [faction]" quests you can do the other side up to that point
---
the CSA is awarded by the settlers before that point
---
-eta: you can still max rep with both after you take sides too
---
"I will mark it in your ticket"
---
Nice thank you
---
Yeah, no other video games. no tv shows, no books, nothing. Nope. it's fallout 76, the most hated game in the history of history or sitting there watching static.
---
I asked for this pre-update and everyone got snippy!
---
I check the map to see who's there and if it's a bunch of low levels I join, let them have their fun and basically just stand guard and watch, ready to help, should the need arise. This is, most of the time, actually really fun. Especially with Campfire Tales.
---
I genuinely watched a group of level 5-20 literally gather around the campfire. A level 40 something was there as well and I assume that he was the dad of one of them. He jumped on the roof, got his Tesla out and just waited there for the rest of the event.
---
They sat on the logs, listened to the bot and argued over area chat wether or not this would end with a jump scare. Heated arguments who should get kindle. Lots of yelling when they actually grouped up and searched for the missing camper items because they couldn't agree on who should go with whom. 
---
Me and the dad had to step in when the waves started because bugs can be a real nuisance if you are unprepared. After it was done they actually wanted to pay me. I refused payment, gave them a bunch of stuff to make their life easier and agreed to have my photo taken.
---
Somewhere out there are a bunch of kids with a group photo of all of us after the event was over.  A lvl 381 in full in PA surrounded by 8 low levels. :)
---
If it's high levels only I consider it open season, though. 
---
The only exception is Encryptid. I take pylons instead of blindly shooting at everything.
---
Ok Karen
---
No worries. Just don't accept/do the 'side with..' quest until you've done everything else. Head to Foundation after you've done suit guy's thing.
---
Yeah Blast mines are neat. They do a good amount of damage, cause burning, and seemingly have a decent area of affect despite the visual effect saying otherwise.
---
Lol I said the exact same thing
---
Ammunition’s Factory near Vault 79 is best.
---
Scrapping paint cans for lead
---
Can always collect the materials and make it, too.
---
Neat!
---
It's a random encounter location. Sometimes there will be a deathclaw or sheepsquatch there. Other times there will be a bomb or the pipe. Various NPCs will also be there. Sometimes nothing will be there.
---
Then you want a challenge if u r testing,  not someone who has no idea what MIGHT be happening...
---
Op could have legit been going to give him something?!?
---
Sorry, what now? How have I missed an ammunition's factory?
---
Go kill some mutants and schorched. Check ammo boxes. There’s ammunition everywhere just look
---
I was playing other games but if I’m grinding for something the grind gets delayed even though it’s one day.
---
There are other things I can be doing and I was, but when a game’s endgame grind requires u to log on faulty to collect currency it’s a bit of a pisstake
---
I've always found ammo to be hard to come by even with Super Duper and Ammosmith. I get "ammo anxiety" when I'm questing where I only want to use cheap cost guns and rotate them because I'm scared I will run out.
---
Go to Helvetia, rear the the restaurant there lot of wood prepared to be grabbed
---
I could give you free ammo from my armco ammo maker if you play on ps4
---
Literally me everytime I run into that random event where the dude insults my Pipboy cause its not as cool as his Beat Boxing Eye Bot
---
It's a beauty!
---
I dig the tile inside too. That burning rubber smell tho.....

Answering your new questions:
---
1. Did he get the "gold version" of the card? If so, then it's not a dupe; it's the "animated" version. It's also possible that he got a very similarly named/appearing card that isn't Heavy Gunner?
---
2. There was some... bug? Feature? Where doing quests in Adventure mode unlocked NW card packs. I honestly don't remember how or why it happened, only that it did, and it was linked to Adventure mode. I don't know why he didn't get them; maybe they'll show up after a few games, or maybe they fixed whatever caused it and he missed out.
---
Some of us got crazy amounts; I think I had something like ~160 unopened packs. (Which - since I already had most of them unlocked, just meant a big chunk of XP.)
---
My advice if you haven't opened yours yet is to use your Overseer tokens and just buy every card you can before opening packs. That way all of those packs just go straight to XP, rather than unlocking cards and leaving you with a mess of useless Overseer Tokens.
---
Or just no budget would be better
---
I agree with you
---
It's just a minor inconvenience OP just has to wait so what
---
Everyone agrees that hacked/legacy items need to be removed/fixed.
---
Nobody believes pvp is balanced in any way, shape or form.
---
Keeping the rhetoric "pvp is griefing" will keep things this way.
---
whenever I get nice loot I drop something to "quick/force save" in case I get a disconnect
---
Theg sacrificed singleplayer dlc for online.
---
They stopped being super rare after the Christmas event.
---
They were duped...a lot.
---
That’s so cool
---
idk how many of you started a new character since Wastelanders but its kind of hilarious when you talk to the overseer and she asks how you spent literally months alone in the vault.
---
I didn't get the half roman column in the Atomic Shop when it was available, but  I would gladly use that instead of the rubber tires

(pipe is life)

I’m on Xbox :(
---
FOr those on pc; Fallout 76 Quick Configuration from 76 Nexus, mod installer, ini tweaker, movie skipper, pip-boy tinter and more. 
---
It's like having eaten soup with a fork all my life and suddenly being handed a spoon.
---
VATS is just downright bugged. To mitigate the dumbass missfire I just jump before I enter VATS. For some reason this is always a 100% hit. 
---
The reload issue is something I never had until I got a Gauss Shotgun and used it in a nuke zone. Damned thing refused to reload unless the clip was actually empty. Stashed it, not using it again since I'm a heavy gunner and only wanted to see what all the fuss was about. Not bad, still prefer my .50
---
Correct.  Which is totally different than claiming their core SP games are shit because of a multiplayer focus.
---
I've taken 5 workshops in a map just for plans and no one bugged me.  I wouldn't have cared if a player tried to take one. Weird.
---
Dang, that's super cool! I love seeing the ideas people come up with!
---
Oh okay cool I knew I wasn't that lucky!
---
Seriously. NO game I have ever played has provided a detailed analysis of service disruptions. 
---
Far too many players today are "Gamer Karens", who demand explanations and compensation for every little inconvenience.
---
melee easy scorched in the forest and take theirs while your gathering mats to craft some..
---
once your leveled up enough to ammosmith and superduper.. youll be up to your ass in ammo..
---
Or at the very least just lower the amount of budget that turrets, animals, and other larger budget items take up. But turrets especially.
---
I see what you did there lol
---
It went from an 80k plan to being 500 caps at most, with caps being almost -80% Value due to the same reason.
---
That’s true the flow of gold and scrip is constant but when a game restricts you to daily collection with no compensation it’s bit of a inconvenience.
---
I never said it was the worst thing in the world, it’s just impractical limiting currency collecting to daily if playing daily isn’t an option whether that be by work, school or server instability
---
Budget has been steadily increasing. Wastelanders brought a pretty big bump to it. I relocated my max budget camp when it released and was super surprised to see I had more budget to work with
---
Again as much as I'd love to see new additions to the game we need to see what Beth's plans are for the balance pass later this year.
---
Shotguns still aren't working correctly outside of VATS. Explosive weapons are massively outpaced by every other weapon in terms of DPS &amp; Durability. And a whole plethora of weapons are [missing mods.](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/gv6r7p/several_weapons_are_still_missing_some_mods_one/)
---
Yeah, that just happened to me too. I even scrapped and rebuilt my venders after the last patch.
---
i like to carry a grognak.. 9? i think? in case i get over encumbered and cant get weight down enough to FT for some reason..
---
otherwise I will consume whatever it is right after I pick it up
---
34
---
Yeah I already have a surplus by forgetting to turn them in for a week I have 100+ so double TNs wouldn't help me anyways unless I want to forget to turn them in again, look in my inventory to find 5000+ lol
---
LOL I collect bobblehead after bobblehead and never remember to use them.  I probably have hundreds on my mule.
---
That just shows how lazy they are that it would be so easy to implement.
---
Alternatively...   
---
5. After successfully displaying your prizes, join a server where your camp can't be placed.  
---
6. Cook some food or craft some ammo.  Maybe repair a weapon or armor.  
---
7. Join a server where your camp is intact but your displays are now empty again because the game used your prized collection as scrap instead of using the thousands of scrap from your scrap box.
---
oh.. I sometimes hold onto a charisma buff until Im doing my daily caps limit

Kill the crickets in the middle of the tree halfway-up Tanagra Town. The travel to Toxic Larry’s and kill the three snallygasters.  ThT alone can get 50-80 acid. Then server-hop and repeat.

Could not agree more.
---
Wtf... So there is a card and a gold card of the same name?  Animated? The card is animated? Or it does something else also?  
---
For the second part... Ill buy that.  He stopped 76 for a long time so prob didnt get many, my other buddy never stopped but didnt play nearly as much as i did, and thats y i got the most out of them.  Tyvm for all the help.  At least he may stop raging about not getting a ticket.
---
That happens to me often. I just thought it was a glitch.
---
Oh ok I suggest just to play the game as you gobon you will find more ammo and I really suggest using melee more and to save your caps as much as you can and having friends could help even more
---
That looks awesome!!
---
Not OP, but im around level 16.
---
Is PS4 usually dead around 1am EST? I rarely ever run into other people, but the only time I can play is around midnight to 5am Friday and Saturday. It's been fun but gets boring being by myself all the time, and also probably because I was replaying Fallout 4 for a long time before coming directly to 76
---
Yes, a majority of players play during the day, I'm EST aswell.
---
I play on playstation and I’ve had a much different experience. Xbox seems like a paradise
---
You are right any company that has an outage should at least come up with something.
---
I'm 99 Percent I'm in that photo!
---
Gota do what ya gota do.. Right..... :-)
---
Ugh. I never see these darn tire walls up for sale, and everyone uses them!
---
People on xbox are already duping weapons again tho
---
I don’t have any problems sneaking with it
---
Not that I noticed. You can fly when crouched. Lol
---
Ahh that's interesting
---
For sure.
---
Oh? I didn't know PlayStation was bad. I would've expected them to be quite nice to noobs
---
There's also a new bug where if someone fast travels away the queen takes like so much more damage and you can kill her in seconds
---
Truth is, game was rigged from the start.
---
*B O O F*
---
That's what I did and I haven't really regretted it.  Rep is a grind, even a small amount of it.  I got to ally status with both factions anyway and have plenty of gold and notes left after buying the things that I wanted.  The modules are really the limiting factor beyond that.
---
How
---
Because I'm not a wagon chaser and I love the game but if you love your wife can she not drive you bat shit crazy also?
---
He doesn't want or can't be arsed to deal with morons. The cow was only a small part of it.
---
I've not even used it. Does it use AP?
---
pipe is life
---
Dang I was gonna post the same once I finish the other quests...but I'm on Xbox.  Missed connections...
---
Yeah found one in the mire. Funny.
---
Ummmm you sure that what there blaming instead of the hacked guns floating around? Like multiple ebay listing....
---
the budget is in the game for stability. if there was no budget, people would be able to build so much that it would make the game unstable  and tank frame rates
---
the game itself has a ton of bugs in general but i was talking about PvP and deal almost 0 damage to players who just killed me. VATS works fine but it is useless in pvp
---
Not at all.
---
How much damage you putting out? I've been considering it myself just never got enough drugs to cope up on.
---
So more charisma means more caps for selling so of i have any like food that gives me more charisma I should use them before I sell?
---
People creating their own reality.
---
Yeah my camp is a random spawn point didnt know when I built it. But come home to sheepsquatch about once a week or so
---
I really wish I kew that I just sold a bunch of stuff and my charisma was way down at 6 because ate something that made it go down
---
Nah people be standing infront of you during sbq sp they can enter pvp when the event ends and get your flux. Like bitch thats why i do sbq fights
---
I noticed that with fasnacht it didn't matter how much you participated the reward mask or plan was random. I received a lot of those berets while actually doing the event.  The one time I sat back and let all the low levels do it I caught a rare item. 
---
I think the reward should be based on how much you participate. So if you are hiding out in the shadows you aren't going to get a great prize but if you were actually doing the event then the reward will be better.
---
For some god forsaken reason, if you are crafting items and it requires the scrap material that an item on display has, it will automatically scrap that item for the material. Everyone complaims about it and bethesda just wont fix it. Much like a lot of other issues.
---
Removed entirely cause it fucks up trades 
---
It's really not
---
And it's used as a griefing tool 4v1 which is why I'm glad Bethesda is changing it the war on Bethesda is both highly laughable and fucking pathetic
---
odds dont change.. every spin of the wheel is the same.. RNG doesnt remember
---
RNG just rolls like that...
---
These are "zero star" one of the things bugthesda has said they have fix
---
Pacifist mode? I do it to avoid cocky lvl 400 and above
---
Last time all my display stuff was in my stash.oddly when you craft anything it seems to pull random junk.like bears for cloth toy robots for lead even though you have plenty of said junk like lead cloth etc.its kinda backwards how it works
---
O haven’t tried it out yet
---
I know but back when wild Appalachia was released if you found a three star you would get one, I find that over time the system broke and less and less three stars were dropping on three stars
---
Many can chimes at the pleasant valley ski resort and around the fortifications east of it.
---
Claim the workshop at Hemlock holes and place down extractors to get 30 acid every 20 minutes.
---
Pre war money gives lots of cloth for gunpowder. You can find tons of it behind counters and in cash registers at the whitespring golf course and surrounding buildings.
---
As mentioned above, Excavator PA in lucky hole mine yields nearly 800 lead on a full run and smelt using super duper.
---
If you do Uranium Fever and loot every last thing in the entire mine, you can get 1000+ steel if you can use the scrapper perk.  800 if not. Team up with buddies so that you can loot all corpses.
---
Plenty of copper if you need it in the rocks surrounding Solomon's pond.
---
Always use super duper (after level 50 I think) and ammosmith when crafting ammo.  You will get more than you need.
---
probably a long ass time farming them in the wild..
---
Agreed. I love to detail. I removed all my plants, all of my turrets. I have a single water purifier. No animals.
---
I'm still almost at max budget. I keep having to remove things to put up new things. And it's almost entirely due to my detailing. My house isn't massive, it's like, one and a half floors, and only takes up a small portion of my build area, with a super tiny one block wide porch on the side to hold my crafting stations and a tiny path to my water purifier. Everything else is detail work. Tables, chairs, shelves, stash boxes, a couple beds, lighting, rugs, a couple small walls breaking up the shape of my rooms, a couple display cases to show off my event masks, 4 vendors with a few bits of decoration near them for interest, a sign with neon letters spelling out "Buy Now!" next to the vendors.
---
It's kind of obnoxious how little I can actually do.
---
Someone mentioned something about there being a plan to add interior spaces to a camp. Rumor being that inside the interior, you'll have a bigger budget since it's not on the main map. But we'll have to wait and see for that.
---
its never been a guarantee its always been RNG..
---
Oddly my best 3star guns have came from cave crickets and bloatflys. Really odd
---
Not that long if buying them counts
---
Not long really, I see lots in vendors and they spawn fairly often in world.
---
He passed by the parade during its last event for me was kind of cool even snapped some pictures
---
Probably 2 or 3 days of normal gameplay with the bonblehead finder perk on.
---
Like after a 4 hour session a few months back I had 30+ bobbleheads just from picking them up when I heard there noise.
---
PvP in Fallout was always going to be a tagged on after thought and was never high on anyones list for a multiplayer Fallout. There is so many good PvP games around why bother with Fallout, its just a total waste of resources to keep it in the Adventure mode (almost impossible to balance PvP and PvE). There is NW if you want to escape PvE for a bit.
---
What do you mean? I have collected a hundred or so of the strength Bobbleheads that can use for my melee build. I traded for mine though.
---
I know I got a pipe pistol from the Queen and a bloodied gauss rifle from a rad roach
---
Been playing for quite a long time but I don't deal with the whole trading scene.  What's the reasoning for violet being more expensive?  Pretty much the easiest to get since every other server has a nuke zone active in the bog.  Is it solely because of calibrated shocks?
---
also if you don't mind running the marsupial mutation instead of the jetpack, you can add emergency protocols to your PA.  At low health it will speed up your movement considerably.  Obviously you need to fix your other problems first.
---
No you didn’t. But the need to post about it makes seem more important than your saying it is. Your putting in effort to post and respond to people. 
---
So it does seem like it’s important to you.
---
I happened to take out an 3* assaultron it mutated it blew up I ran started looting
---
#BOOM 
---
Was very confused
---
That makes sense
---
Westek, Charleston DMV, Whitesprings Golf Course all yield multiple legendaries usually.  Others have already mentioned the best events to run.
---
Screws? So someone must have gained access to the display to place screws there, or were they there before? A box of screws can be displayed, did you do that?
---
I lost all my Teddy Bears and other collectibles while the display cases were disabled. No longer bother collecting.
---
Never hurts to rotate weapons, I do the same with a few different ammo types even though I could literally craft hundreds of thousands of rounds of ammo right now.  Prefer to use found ammo where I can and have a rotation of sidearms that go into and out of the stash when one ammo is starting to run low and I've accumulated a stock of another.
---
I get that problem, the only way around that is to get into the chassis and put the armor on like apparel with the pipboy
---
I’ll give that a try next time I’m on
---
True, but skillup is not an idiot
---
The vending and display system still seems broken.
---
The game.... don't trust.
---
There is a Cappy statue in floor decor I believe. The Nuka cola statue is in the same slot. The Nuka Quantum bottle is under lights.
---
No, not really
---
I'm so doing this
---
What type of ammo do you use mostly?
---
You did not mess up, you just got the ability to possibly drop a sick ass legendary, there is no universe in which I would rather sell a plan that I don't know rather than learning it.
---
cool story i guess, but you still did the right thing. learn plans you don‘t know yet, so they can drop as legendary items. goes for the fixer and bear arm. don‘t beat yourself up lol
---
.45
---
I am currently collecting all the magazines to display. I am consuming any bobble head I find for the Atom challenge.
---
I use a perfect storm to tag at lvl 340.  Still does too much damage sometimes.
---
Lol yes I'm glad I can get it as a legendary drop now as angry turtle (the youtuber) has a very good one on his melee character
---
Thanks everyone. If anyone wants to run with me on Xbox my tag is NimbleKitty9490
---
i have one of the best rolls available, bloodied swing speed strength, and it‘s so much fun. cool looking and pretty unique, too.
---
The pvp world for fo76 was a great add on they had it was entering was it hard yea but enjoyable i like the fact you had to be warry for the world and players alike but it was ruined when people gang up on a new lvl 1 and spawn kill for 10 mins made the play less enjoyable but i did enjoy fight with a player while roaming the world.
---
.50, 5.56 and 5mm UC Ammo would be my guess.
---
I take off Tank killer card
---
That’s my birthday! Sweet!
---
Do you want to sell that?
---
I just got the plan last night as well after a Project Paradise. WAS SO STOKED. A good rolled legendary 3 star bear arm, is worth just as much. Bear Arms are rare. Be happy your learned the plan, and now hope the purveyor smiles on you.
---
If PC I will give you the flux you require.
---
depending on what you use i could hook you up with some free ammo
---
I would suggest...
---
Remove all your perk cards, close the game and reopen. Once in the game exit for a second time.
---
Re enter the game and replace perk cards as you had them and test.
---
If you are on PC use the mod... to easily change perk builds.
---
[Perk Loadout manager.](https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout76/mods/124/)
---
I guess your right
---
Getting 1 star legendaries from 3 star enemies is the only thing that pisses me off about the system. But it's not worth it to farm legendaries imo I've always had terrible luck.
---
Not long ago, I saw him tenderizing a scorchbeast south of the whitespring.  Yesterday, he was walking along the road headed west from the Blackwater Mine.  I've probably seen him around the map 10 times over the past couple weeks.
---
Buying or server hopping, so somewhere between a minute and half a day. :)
---
I’ve also had this happen with the robots
---
It’s important when the game restricts u to collecting endgame currency to daily, if the game enforces daily gameplay to get rewards then I would hoped for it to keep up with its own limitations, if not compensation or a response at least to why servers were down
---
Having marsupial and being able to jump onto the roof with ease when you have a few dozen ghouls on your tail is amazing.
---
Well that sucks, but makes sense. I can't play until my daughter goes to sleep, so its usually pretty late by the time I get on. 
---
I see a few random people every now and then, but not very often.
---
sadly you cant shoot them in the face..
---
Like hell I'm giving up one of my precious to some random settler. I just pass an intelligence check to turn the bot against the settler.
---
Just FYI the aNSWER HERE IS STILL PAYING OFF!! tHANK YOU!
---
One thing that helped me with ammo around that level was moving my camp next to Morgantown airport. Every time you log in clear the airport inside and out as well as the railyard near the train station. If you don't mind a little tedium you can server hop and do it a few times.
---
The enemies in that area should be level 1 to 10 so taking them out with a melee weapon shouldn't be too hard even without melee perks.  They will drop .308 .38, .45 and shotgun shells.  Then just carry a few weapons so you can use some of each. Should build up a decent stock that way....I know I did at least.
---
I think I've seen the "spikes" on some before but I don't see a mod on these two.
---
Thanks, maybe they'll add a few down the road, it's a cool weapon.
---
Trokholm - I have an explosive anti-armor 50 cal I can trade or I can buy for caps. I think I have around 20k right now so whatever you think is fair
---
I've nuked both, Foundation and the Crater. Bit of a letdown since they'll just wear hazmat suits...
---
It’s very common in a business context, but I have not seen that in a retail game context.
---
Display your awesomeness! 
---
I'm still missing 1 bubblehead and don't care to count the magazines but I have all mine on display at my house ... with my collection of teddy bears.
---
PS4 UK as well, psn im_judge
---
&gt; Wtf... So there is a card and a gold card of the same name? Animated? The card is animated? Or it does something else also? 
---
Works exactly like the gold cards from Adventure mode that you get every five levels. Just an animation on the card itself - nothing else noteworthy about it.
---
You missed a day. That’s it. It’s not even Bethesda’s fault. There’s major internet issues in America and Australia. Theres your reason.
---
It’s a game. The gold will still be there. Sorry you have to wait an extra day to get you fake item in a fake world that does fake things so you can kill fake mutant monsters.
---
Are they essential?   I wanted to go in gunz blazing like Caesars camp in New Vegas.
---
Not 100% sure you can build there, and not 100% sure where exactly it is, I came across it last night and didn't explore beyond sticking my head in.  I was heading to Watoga from Ranger HQ entered Watoga at the Shopping mall.
---
But on the road running east-west ish on the north side of Watoga there is a ditch looking like a small drainage spot on the side of the road which actually led to a tunnel running beneath the road.  It was pretty cleared on top if memory serves, but the tunnel give me the shivers.  Very tight space, with shrooms spaced along the length I could see.
---
Higher demand for Violet than the other ones generally, so a higher price. Personally I use way more Fluorescent for making Ultracite .308 as the primed LMG eats it like crazy.
---
Holy $#!+... I never realized what those gold cards were in adventure mode.  Roflz... Only 240+ levels and now i understand the gold cards.  
---
Then... In NW... Do you get a gold card on your 5th pack every time or is it truly random?
---
Yeah, it sucks and all, and there are other reasons why daily limits are anti-consumer, but raising a stink over the first outage in 2 years is pretty cringe tbh
---
Yeah. I got a bloodied FFR gauss pistol (yeah, I know the pistol is bad) on my support character and a Junkies caster (I'm waiting to do a junkies when they introduce game +)
---
i think it's a worse story told in a worse way lol
---
That explains so much!
---
I use this one too. It’s the best.
---
That's legit!
---
i suspect that it would not be a leap for them to slowly start sacrificing more and more of their SP for MP. if bethesda did it with fo76, why not cockstar and GTA 6?
---
Same here. Constantly hunting for florescent for my lmg and get excited when I see someone nuke Morgantown lol.
---
BOS underarmor and Marine wetsuit.
---
Yep. Same here on pc.
---
&gt; 1ST IS A SCAM
---
Not entirely untrue, [we are still missing 1st rewards](https://imgur.com/a/IBPMU1Z)
---
thats true but they could add a no traps in a certain radius
---
I'd suggest that you go with a melee strength build at first. Add concentrated fire at max level in perception (for when you need ranged attacks) and then work on building at least 10 points in strength and Agility.  Put carry weight perks such as traveling pharmacy and melee perks that buff your melee weapon of choice.  When you need to use a gun, sneak and aim for headshots because this will give you a 4x damage bonus.  You won't need perception perks beyond concentrated fire to kill most enemies.  Only add perks that you need into the other categories, such as pharma farma, butcher's bounty and green thumb.  Once you've achieved this, you can begin to alter your build to suit whatever playstyle you have adopted as your favorite.   You will learn as you go and thus want to refine your build after you "Know what you want".  I am lvl 340 and still "Refining".  Your needs will change as your character progresses and accumulates better gear.
---
HVH and Bock don’t affect heavy guns for some reason 
---
Weird about the gauss rifle maybe try Bock
---
I think you’re taking this post too seriously. I’m just saying that if there’s restrictions on game I hope that the game can live up to enforcing them properly. You’re acting like this game is my life and I depend on it
---
Majority of my good rolls came from ghouls, and good portion of that is glowing ones. Everyone speaks highly of Westek, somehow i never got a worthy roll there. But yea it’s all RNG.
---
Shielded is always best.
---
Fifty thousand people used to live here. Now it's a ghost town.
---
I also support this mutation, nice to be able to jump over a legendary death claw when it's heading for you
---
Gotcha.  Only really use florescent for 308 right now so wasn't sure what exactly the demand was from.  Makes sense as those are some of the more useful ammos. Thanks.
---
That would depend on your build and play style. What kind of build do you have?
---

The link is old but will help
---
Well, there is a reason why Crater and Foundation have to co-exist and can never destroy each other. Crater needs the settlers to continue producing goods so that they can steal them. Meanwhile, Foundation is full of wusses and don't even try to take out Crater. Thus continues the balance of life.
---
It’s not a problem. It’s designed that way so you can’t trade T-65 parts to another player.
---
Not even that. They don't have a hit box so your bullets go straight through them with no aggro.
---
They really need to implement a 1 per customer mode or some such.
---
It's a extra 50%of that weapons damage
---
Flammable as hell too...
---
Ive been down the same road. Im level 45 now.  Honestly the best way is to make it.  Get you the excavator armor when you can and hit the Lucky Hole mine for lead.  Steel is everywhere but i ususally raid Eastern Regional pen and scrap the guns.  To make guns pwder i moved my camp on an acid vein and cloth is everywhere too. 
---
It helps to have a private server as well.  Then you can hit all the weight rooms around the map.

Just tried it on SBQ....wow was unreal

You made the post. You keep thinking you deserve compensation for missing a day of your grind. 
---
Your the one making a deal about this.
---
So you want end game gear with little time investment? Don't forget you still need to roll them when crafting and that requires legendary module.

Facts. Sometimes I just want to lodge a bullet into Ward's smug face.

they should at least let you kill everyone in the instanced area..

There is nothing lovelier, but the smell of burning tires in the morn.

Someone was posting in another thread that if you use the heavy weapon display and put a broadsider on it, it looks just like a cannon. Might want to consider adding a few of those. It look great!

There are different types of underarmor:

Vaultsuit, casual, raider, BoS, enclave, and marine.
---
They give different state bonuses depending on what type you use, and the stat bonuses get better with each tier.
---
The tiers for each type of underarmor go : treated&lt;resistant&lt;protective&lt;shielded.
---
I did kill a mouthy npc in Foundation.  She was talking shit so I put her down.
---
3% xp per point.  If you run unyielding, thats 15 more, plus broiled scorchbeast brains (+3), Berry Mentats (+5), Cranberry Relish (+3) and the egghead mutation (+6).  My INT hovers around 38 without exploits, which means I gain XP around 100% faster than most non-unyielding builds that have around 5 intelligence.  It is a very noticeable difference in XP gained, especially at high levels where leveling up is hard as hell to do.
---
As much as I love building, I kinda hate it in 76. When all the servers were down yesterday I decided to start playing FO4 again. Already beat the main game with the Institute, so I decided to make an Institute facility above ground at Starlight to show the Commonwealth that we’re not the bad guys any more under the new management. And holy hell did it feel amazing to have close to zero restrictions with what I wanted to make. I haven’t even finished the third building and want to make a fourth, and then I’ll still have to go and do all the detailing in every single room.
---
That would be the double genitalia one....
---
Lol. Thats why New Vegas was my fav.  Give me lip.  Blast your ass.  A bunch of failed quests notifications would pop up.
---
Ya hey if your on xbox I’ll make ya some ammo and holy crap I have a over abundance of rad-x
---
It will load another fusion core from your inventory automatically. It will also always take the one with the least amount of charge... So if you have one core at 75% and another at 50% it will take the 50% one.
---
Yeah. Even settlements in Fallout 4 had budgets. You could always just get around that with mods, but after a certain point if you’ve built so much in a single area, either your frames majorly tank or you crash your game.
---
Drink a Beer for some bonus C
---
I don’t know jack about game development but I do know that the best traps have a great distance between the starting point and the kill point. It’s often the fall that kills you!
---
Caps are basically worthless. I've been at max caps for a week and I'm buying stuff like crazy. No biggie. But congrats on the plan :)I have it too I just wish the growl was louder
---
No way! Keep this setup as it look awesome and the build suits the game more that fancy columns.
---
You should use shielded on any under armor, at level 30 you probably do not have the flux or the plan. You may be able to find full under armors in player vendors for about 1000 caps 
---
The type of under armour is off your needs. 
---
Enclave
---
 Bos
---
Casual
---
Raider
---
And soon secret service. 
---
I am not sure the benefits of each but each boosts your stats. 
---
Casual increases charisma
---
Enclave has strength and rad resistance. 
---
Secret service is a huge increase in strength like +4
---
Do your research and think about what type of player you are going towards. People will tell you this or that but only you know your  goal.
---
was that sarcasm?
---
don't you ever get the feeling that there are no games to play, no tv shows to watch, no books cus you can't read?
---
I really feel l like playing something new but everything is trash, so I log on to shoot flying rats and get my daily currencies.
---
pocketed armor.
---
That plan isn’t worth much anymore it’s been duped to hell and back every dupe glitch
---
What about a Halo 1 pistol? It’ll make bloodied melee users jealous
---
Like I said if the game has restrictions and can’t support those restrictions then why have them. That is my own opinion. You can have your own opinion but attacking me and saying that I depend on this game was rather rude. You’re entitled to your own opinion and could have disagreed with my post without insulting me
---
Why am I getting downvotted for asking a question?
---
Yes and not part of Fallout 1st
---
I am fairly conservative in regards to mutations..
---
I only run Marsupial, Grounded and Eagle Eyes for full the health rifleman/commando builds I have..
---
I feel comfortable not maxing class freak and spending the points elsewhere since the downsides of what I run are very low anyway...
---
Np man if your on xbox and need help with anything let me no, since theres a lack of endgame content right now I make my own endgame as a bodyguard for low lev player
---
Haha thanks mate
---
Probably why Ward is so pissy
---
Do Scorched Earth, and tag the queen for at least 1500 damage.  You'll be rewarded with 3 Improved repair kits each time, which repair your weapon to 150%
---
And when your last core runs out you can only VERY slowly move.
---
Oh rlly thanks for letting me know at least I have a chance to get a good bear arm legendary
---
Imagine the smell of that thing
---
Looks nice from what I can see due to your pics being at night.
---
Perfect. That's all I needed to know.  Thank you!  I tried to search reddit for the answer with no luck.
---
 This exactly. I am level 340 and can literally kill huge mobs in a couple shots. You don't want me going all "Try Hard" at your events. I just want the notes. If things get out of hand for the low levels, I always try to help. Otherwise I just hang out and let them have the fun and get the xp.
---
Bear arms are pretty bad compared to other unarmed melee.
---
Don't side with lazy devs. Rebalancing this game is cake, there's just many records to change.
---
The game launched with many more pvp options than we have today. It definitely was more than an afterthought.
---
really makes whitesprings playable before the rest of your build/gear have caught up...
---
lvl 31 is my favorite level because thats when you can max starched genes.. lol
---
Ha! I figured you'd just get booted from the PA altogether.    
---
In the words of Jim Carrey: "So you're saying there's a chance?!?"
---
Im pretty sure they stack.
---
I definitely have longer load times on Nuclear Winter. I figured it was to avoid loading assets from the hard drive by kicking everything into RAM
---
Lol I waited a few minutes out of bounds. He never came back so I went on my merry way. I was curious. There’s always these stories about strangers gifting legacy’s and rare plans on this reddit. I now think they are posted by pvpers.
---
I mean a bloodied one with faster swing speed would be great but ik for sure the death claw gauntlet is better than the bear arm
---
You bet! I mentioned it in my album, but I have the displays already set up. Just waiting for the broadsiders.
---
And again. You missed a day. Your trying to make some case about it, the restriction hasn’t ruined anything for you. 
---
Your still going to get that thing you want. Just a day later than you scheduled for. 
---
You also need to get over yourself. Because you think your needs are so important that Bethesda needs to compensate you. Entitled.
---
there are some really good spots in the bog that have weaker enemies, no area is completely safe. 
---
along the highway south of abandoned bogtown, there are openings to a tunnel system under the highway, the only enemies that spawn there are cave crickets
---
between the highway and cranberry glades, there is a set of stairs up to a monorail cart, you can put your camp modules 3 stories up the stairs, and then you have the wide flat area below, and you can build inside/on top of the cart, the only enemies that spawn there are molerats
---
Haha maybe I'll update with some daytime ones. I just grabbed some quick snaps before going to bed, then put them in an album while at work.
---
If that person has legacy gear and you don't, they can kick your ass all day by themselves. The rest are just there to watch you have a meltdown over it.
---
Non-physical explosions do true damage. Explosion and energy resistance do not apply, only %reduction.
---
The "war" is a response to the change, not the other way around.
---
Trading is fucked regardless. The economy was never balanced around how fast you can acquire items.
---
Edit: you can test what I said about energy explosions with a plasma grenade.
---
I haven't even gotten to the point of earning treasury notes. Don't have a single one. How will that benefit me?
---
O for sure, completely agree ! A balance pass being priority especially weaponsand legendary effects. The  bloodied/junkie meta now is so prevalent . It has killed the t r a d e m a r k e t, that sub is a mess right now. If you dont have a bloodied,junkie commando/heavy weapon or a explosive energy laser  legacy you might as well scrip it, friggin terrible.
---
Saw him t-posing at some robots in the middle of the dirt track a couple of days ago.
---
Popular spot, here’s an old post with directions and ideas for building: https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/aetcp2/the_only_true_waterfall_ive_been_able_to_find_so/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf
---
Was just about to  post the same thing. Less than half a bar until Hellfire armor...
---
Come on Todd, please kick the server!
---
Edit, i just force closed the app three times and the 4th time i got i to a game.
---
I think i know where it is
---
[https://imgur.com/XWGPrhy](https://imgur.com/XWGPrhy)
---
There's a junk pile near some water there and im sure it was in that area. either slightly south or slightly north
---
EDIT: I would go check but i'm holding 13 workshops and i haven't been over there on this character
---
There’s a spot with a high waterfall that’s just east of the crashed airplane in the mire.
---
Getting booted would be preferable in some instances, lol
---
Also, fusion cores are heavy and are also used by the gatling laser, which chews through them so quickly. I’d advise not using it with the power armor. I made that mistake before.
---
Yeah but it’s the equivalent of moving after your car runs out of gas: faster to get out and walk.
---
That's what I said. Vats can get bugged to deal 0 damage in pvp. It doesn't happen every time.
---
If you're in pacifist, you will always deal 0 damage if you wind up in pvp.
---
That's literally all that pacifist mode does.
---
Can you even take stuff out of other player's collectron stations? I'm able to look in them and take stuff but none of it ever actually appears in my inventory.
---
Cheers, I might remove it for a bit and see how much of a difference it makes before I commit to moving the points over. Thanks again
---
Seriously?! Lol, wish I knew this couple weeks ago I ended up having to just scrap the piece because I couldn't re-equip it.
---
I'll definetly give it a look. Im getting more and more into smaller base builds. I think the restrictions make me get creative
---
Yes. I’ve had to snag some junk from someone’s once to repair a gun.
---
If you think that's bad wait a week and a half and see what happens when there's an outage when the Score dailies are live. Miss out on major rewards because the servers are down. Or if that Nuclear Winter bug isn't fixed that doesn't give you credit for dailies and weeklies.
---
If Bethesda can’t keep up with its own system then don’t have it. If it can’t then faith in the company is lost and there’s distrust in the company. A response to why systems failed or compensation would likely resolve issues. 
---
You need to relax on this post, you’ve taken it to heart.
---
yea but also i would still enjoy not spawn off the side of a cliff when im trying to buy stuff and honestly i want less limits on building stuff so i can have a cave base or sumn without it being like oh that intersecting with existing objects
---
There are many 'better' options (increased armor protection and enhanced SPECIAL stats, depending on armor type) BUT most of the 'good' linings won't unlock until you're level 50/finished faction quest OR you find/buy the plan and will (generally) require stable flux to craft. I would also advise you wait until Patch 20 drops on the 30th b/c Vault 79 Shielded Secret Service Underarmor will finally be available an that will (arguably) be the 'best' underarmor in the game.
---
Actually try where this camp is 
---

Did some googling and it looks like it is there. i was way off
---
You can trade a god tier bear arm for most anything. Only way to get a god tier bear arm us to know the plan.
---
i dont even care if people make trap bases it would encourage walking if they are scared
---
So much potential food
---
Well I read the plan so I'm all set there :)
---
Dang it
---
Huh, definitely hasn't worked for me, and no one's been able to loot my station. Must be another bug.
---
Got it as well when trying to swim to win while I eat lol
---
Glad to hear you enjoyed it.
---
Its Bethesda they'll screw it up. Its almost a 100% chance they will.
---
Smelly as hell as well.
---
I'm level 109 on my secondary character. My main is lvl 500-ish. But thanks.
---
Not missing anything just a lot of things coming in the future
---
If there are fewer people on the server the map shrinks to start with in nuclear winter, it's so you meet people more often and not after 4 minutes or whatever.
---
Which ones, it'sunfortunate that the mountain scout helmet doesn't work yet
---
Hey balloon bud I did that too!  lol.
---
That’s so awesome! Love the engineering of it all, great job
---
To bad you can't place the smoke machine inside the fireplace pointing towards the sky. I guess you could place it at the top somehow and place it a certain way.
---
Sucks you can only place one at a time but it should do.
---
Damn I wish I had those.
---
Some of the reload perks need to be re added to get the reload speed
---
Marsupial and Speed Demon makes the QOL better...
---
A lot of us pull them out and then put them back in again that usually triggers the effect.
---
Good roll is the perfect prefix and legendary effects of a weapon. 
---
For example, a B2525 Fixer/Handmade would be considered a god roll. 25% faster fire rate with a 25% Less VATS cost. 
---
IMO, these weapons are obtained through trades. Rarely have I experienced a god roll drop. 
---
My god roll drop was a B2525 Fixer from the purveyor.
---
I love this more than I should.
---
That was pre Faschnacht so your experiences may be more current
---
If you have stairs outside the house frame or outdoor crops youre going to have to rebuild 99%of the time. Ground just isnt the right shape:/
---
I’m level 111 and have never launched a nuke and would very much like to
---
Awesome work. I passed those tire things up without a second glance, never even considered they could be used like this.
---
😭
---
You on pc?
---
That looks dope!
---
There's a player I know that has well over 200 bobbleheads. She absolutely loves them.
---
Why did you have to post this? Now I feel the urge to rebuild my camp. Amazing idea btw
---
OP is talking about displayed weapons, not Legendaries in vendors.
---
I think its the masts that make it so awesome. I have seen a few ships builds but not using this technique before
---
There was that emergency pull down when PC players had that inventory/stash hack going on. I don’t know if you’d consider that unplanned or not though. It definitely wasn’t pre announced but they were the ones pulling the plug whereas this just kinda happened.
---
I also have my money on their new MFA as the culprit considering whatever happened pulled down nearly all of Bethesda’s online services for a bit shortly after releasing. Like everything else Bethesda, I’m giving it a few weeks to see what issues pop up before using it, and hopefully nobody gets doxxed this time
---
I have the same except Psycho instead of Med-X
---
For the millionth... mother... fucking... time...
---
Know all the free shit they keep giving away with 1st every month?  Those are the fucking discounts.  They started off selling the ranger reskins for 500 atoms, everyone freaked the fuck out that they deserved them for free so Bethesda took the discounts offer out of all current 1st advertising and instead HAS BEEN GIVING THEM AWAY FOR FREE.
---
And again YOU PEOPLE ARE STILL BITCHING ABOUT IT.
---
Ok that makes sense. Thanks for the clarification. How do people seem to have them so frequently? I was thinking (because of some comments I read on another post) that you can randomly craft legendaries. I’ve crafted at least 25 fixers and nothing. Can you randomly craft legendaries?
---
You could also craft bloodieds thats RNG. Problem its not RNG, problem is only one build be viable.
---
Just tried it without the card and haven’t seen much difference. So I presume that I must of had it for a bit as I’ve not really moved out since I’ve put it in.
---
how much should it cost to pick exactly what you want?
---
Not all of us grief!!!
---
I’ve been playing in a Private Server, up until level 16 so far and im building a “Museum” of Bears of what not, so far when going to Craft, Build, Scrapping All, or Upgrade something, I have Not lost anything in the Display Cases, Im using the 1st Junk Box, I havent actually “Crafted” alot of stuff yet but still, sounds more like to Me that someone stole your stuff. Cause I play GTA Online and If I know anything people can find workarounds very quickly for Glitches.
---
@VAL3NTIN3Z
---
Why so serious ?
---
Are they still 15%? Maybe reduce to somewhere between 10-12% would be good.
---
Invest in a Melee Weapon.
---
Fixers aren’t craftable with legendary effects. The purveyor and I believe the Fasnacht event reward them for completing. 
---
Sadly, weapon duping was at an all time high back in the day when they were taking out energy weapons with explosive legendary effects. 
---
I personally obtained mine through trades.
---
Yep, it's super lame. They get to just insult you and you can't do anything. What's worse is Meg with the "you think you can just leave here after killing one of mine...well, you're lucky im in a good mood. get out of here."
---
I feel ya on the mini gun but when I finally got the settler rep up and got the shotgun I crafted first try a 2 star bloodied it’s amazing but then I crafted 3 more to try and get a 3 star and nothing good. Plus I got the whole set of secret service armor. 2 try’s on the chest and arms and got 3 star unyielding but no good rolls but still nice but the legs I’ve done crafted so freaking many and nothing but crap
---
Yeah. Pretty sure Gauss Rifle is an energy weapon but it actually does ballistic damage. I bet bock would work with it as well.
---
I think he's on about the other stuff were missing (so far) like expanded camp build budgets on private servers
---
this is just.. wow... this is amazing.  One of the most creative things I have seen yet in fo76.
---
Wow! i've never seen that many together before
---
in fact outside of a horde quest i don't think i've seen that many things together before
---
Yeah, I've nuked Foundation, unloaded my 50cal on Ward when he wouldn't get out of bed and lobbed grenades all over and tried explosive shotgun blasts to the face for people that tell me to get of the chems. Nothing happens. It's disappointing.
---
ft to vault 76 and just walk down the mountain, theres a shitload of logs
---
Have I been playing a different game than all of these people?  This is seriously the first time we've ever had server outages in my memory and people are acting as if this is something regular and Betehsda should be fucking ashamed of it.  For all of the flak people give Bethesda for the game and servers being shit we have an amazing amount of uptime and as soon as that changes in the slightest it's time to bring out the pitchforks and demand satisfaction.
---
Not learnable, unfortunately. Vendors randomly sell the mod for it though. I had to do the same for my furious swing speed switch.
---
Yeah it’s really funky. I did some testing and made a post not too long ago if you wanna check it out. Ling story short, heavies get screwed :( 
---

---
Got it. Thanks again. Guess I’ll keep grinding and hope the purveyor gives me something decent one of these times lol
---
uhm, should have write some details. this screen was taken while deploying, so the start of the match before even loaded in.
---
Yeah once you can craft the weapons you can get enemies to drop them or trade the purveyor. I bought fixer plan from a player for 5k caps and 3 mystery picks last week got a 3 star fixer wasn’t the greatest but still dope
---
Are YOU sure about that?

---
Amazon's cloud services have been getting their virtual asses reamed, guess what this game runs on.
---
Yeah absolutely, thats the main reason I dont play it, its not that im bad, its not that I die within seconds/minutes and its not even the hackers, its the fact that after dying 30 seconds into a game I have a 15 minute wait to do it again
---
Theres a fast travel mat for Workshops, not camp though :\\
---
Seeing as that article is about an attack that was mitigated in FEBRUARY I feel pretty confident.
---
Why does anyone ever bring this up? It was stated, by Bethesda, that the 500 atom ranger skin was an accident and corrected that day. Also refunded everyone who bought it. Old news.
---
And, sorry to say, they still mention the Atomic Shop discounts on the [Fallout 1st page...](https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/fallout1st)
---
&gt;Access to your Private World, Survival Tent, exclusive in-game Atomic Shop promotions and sales, and ability to deposit items in your Scrapbox, are available for the duration of membership.
---
or any effect that adds temporary hitpoints, like buffout or bufftats etc
---
It wouldn’t both me as much if it was guaranteed 3* at least. I spent 100 scrip for the 2 modules but I got a 1* roll? Come on, man.
---
As a non-PvPer I do kind of sympathize with these guys in the same way I sympathize with the current rioters IRL, they are getting ignored time and time again and they have no outlet.  
---
Bethesda needs to bring back survival mode or some kind of hardcore mode, because just because *you* dont play it doesnt mean there arent people who will.
---
how do I even start to craft legendary? and what is puveyor? I'm lvl 25 yet first time playing
---
Wait, if Bethesda is refusing to add Cappy, and Cappy is an anthropomorphic personification of the current US currency, does that make Bethesda Communist?
---
Id like portable musical intruments added. Like just carry a harmonica on you and get that sweet sweet well tuned buff whenever you want...make different (portable) instruments rare drops or something i dunno
---
No buds play this game anymore unfortunately. But we’ll see how, I do it’s all fun n games at the end of the day. Shot u a msg on the box and I’ll try to jump on around 10pm edt
---
You get them randomly, from legendary monsters out in the game. It's all random as to what drops, but you must have learnt the plans for each weapon for a legendary to drop, so if you haven't had  a Fixer plan drop for you at the Encryptid event you won't get a legendary version of it randomly.
---
Also there's the Purveyor, at the Rusty Pick, where you can choose what type of legendary you want. But be prepared to blow a lot of scrip to get your god roll items.
---
There is also the new stuff from Wastelanders that does give you the ability to craft your own legendary weapons, but it's still random. You use legendary modules while building, but you have no control over what you get. I have made 15 gauss miniguns, none of which have been completely ideal for my build.
---
Just For the record. I had never completed Wren's quest, ever. I guess the first time it popped up I toggled it off and then forgot about it. I had to Google it. No wonder it was taking so much longer for the crater reputation than the foundation.
---
Yup, IGN is Br3wD4wg I’m on my way to a family thing for a couple hours now but I’ll be on later!
---
In the second link you see them killing Yao Gaui
---
No pls not i already have 600 of them
---
The charred ones? 
---
Run, they fuck everyone up.
---
Nice , im guessing thats your steam too?
---
Been playing sense lunch and just lunch a nuke 2 days before wastelanders came out
---
You mean the shit they've provided neither specific details or dates on?  
---
Not having delivered on vague promises of future features isn't getting scammed, it's just Bethesda saying these are things they're either considering or working on.  EVERY other feature of 1st was specifically advertised and delivered if not delivered BETTER since they're literally taking things they'd planned on selling at a discount and giving them away free.
---
Your not alone after buying the game at launch I just never had anyone to play with so never got round to launch a nuke. Recently joined a community first people who joined me helped me launch the nuke and kill the scorch beast queen this community is very welcoming
---
Nice! I wish I were more creative in games lol. I’m the type of person that builds squares for houses in Terraria.
---
Evidently, from what I just learned, you can’t craft legendaries. The purveyor is a mole miner vendor located at the rusty pick in the ash heap. You can sale legendaries for script (a different kind of currency) and use the script to purchase random legendaries from the purveyor.

Dont shoot the messenger, I'm just saying what Im sure he meant
---
Ok man cool I got a buddy that just loves to pvp
---
The only time I’ve ever seen it is with games that REQUIRE a paid subscription, like World of Warcraft.
---
oh got it, I know the place, just used once
---
nah.. hes there..
---
Ok. That makes sense now after what I read before. How do you obtain legendary modules?
---
Recently did the same thing next to a guys camp as I collected them when the game started for fusion cores
---
The game has a slight imbalance when it comes to levels of enemies, I believe based on the highest level person in that area.
---
It's weird, but it's Fallout.
---
There is an update due to make things more "equal", but for now, get best gear, best weapons, and if possible, a Power Armor set.
---
Atleast someone understands what i mean 😅🙈 i aint that good at explaining lol cheers man
---
Run, very fast....preferably in the opposite direction,
---
Not a different game, but I do think people tend to lump a bunch of disparate issues in together. The consoles have their own outages, social menu issues etc.
---
They probably shouldn't get lumped together and all the blame put in one place, but I think they do because people just want to play. It only really hurts if you have a limited time or an event scheduled and something like that happens!
---
Out of lead? Visit Vault Tec University's vault and pick all those dumbells from the gym every day. You'll gun the whole west Virginia down!
---
That’s pretty nifty. I’m really digging that antler chandelier. Is that something that’s bought from the Atom shop? I don’t recall ever seeing that.
---
Lol. No he’s there. 
---
Inside one of the attractions. Laying on the ground. 
---
Almost in the center of the fairgrounds.
---
No, that's cheating!
---
you dont belong in whitesprings alone until youve got some rudimentary legendary gear and some more good perks unlocked..

Deleting in game via the gallery doesn't delete the image from the console? I'm going to have to check now, that seems like such a dumb move on their part, I bet I'm using at least a gig

Come on, we could have it worse. We could have Commander Daguerre.
---
Been told that too &amp; it says on mutation, but I often still get it. Idk if it’s a bug or not [speaking for Xbox].
---
Yea dude for real...outside from a few sweaty neckbeards here and there everyone has been super chill and helpful. Even the sweaties are just doing their tryhard thing...nothing really toxic outside of just one shotting everything with their duped chad weapons. Sounds like u might need to take a break or get a bud to play with. I play on pc too, my handle is "capemplanet". im swimming in legendaries and loot and i got a lvl 35 2 shot ultracite gatling for ya if u want it. Hit me up dooooogggggg!

I really hope they don't use the same update as eso used to balance, personally that game is too easy and pointless to have lvls from 0-50, only to gimp you, ATM I'm a lvl 25 melee and I can kill some lvl 52-58 and I find a fun and difficult fight, i hope they keep it that way .
---
I've found that out the hard way!
---
Never feel bad for making your own character more diverse or experienced. Like others have said, getting up around max caps at some point becomes a pretty easy thing to do if you are gathering, discovering, and selling. Finding rare items and plans, that’s what you should be excited about. My son taunts me with his build plenty, things I haven’t found, and it makes the game more fun.
---
Reward: (known) plan: toilet
---
they told you to buy a new graphics card? i've heard of bad support but that is on another level... the worst part is a lot older people play this game who don't know that the support is almost entirely incompetent might actually think they need a new graphics card or some other ludicrous explanation for a shoddily coded game if they ever need to contact support.
---
LOL. I tried to run, but they're fast!
---
Noted :)
---
Unfortunately they are....a long time ago, I was right there with you.
---
Level 504 now.

Meeting and recruiting Raider Punk for the first time, especially as I was on my Cryptid Hunting, conspiracy theorist, tin-foil hat wearing RP alt.

He's been my favorite camp companion ever since.
---
Damn, dude. You're like invincible now.
---
Not quite, but it is a different game for me now.
---
If it makes you feel better, I‘m over 200 and they can still kill me if I’m not careful.  (If the radiation doesn’t get me, the damage after the radiation does)
---
Ghoul slayer or vampire weapons are your friends, as is PA..
---
I got on yesterday, 5 minutes in and fast travel stopped working for me. I got off after that, cbf anymore with the constant glitches
---
and two at the same time!
---
It’s to prevent inflation.
---
Bethesda... 🤷‍♂️
---
I have a well designed camp that’s 2x max budget, and I still want more budget. It doesn’t seem like it’s ever enough.
---
There is a traders economy, if you have no upper limit on caps, people will sell things that *only* a duper could afford, so legacy weapons which are generally dont via a trade now, would be millions of caps.  
---
Personally I'd be all for removing it and letting inflation do its thing, because it'd reach a point where people wouldnt pay extorionate prices for things and people would have to lower them or just not sell them
---
It is a good alternative to Nukashine if one is not comfortable with a long period of blackout.
---
I read the title and got excited for a Double XP weekend.
---
How can people be duping on xbox? I thought duping was only possible on PC?
---
[Is this what you want?](https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout76/mods/551) ^(pcmasterrace)
---
I mean, have you played Nuclear Winter? 
---
If you're not a Bush Wookie yourself, it already feels like playing prop hunt, except every prop's a bush...
---
I sell a lot of serums...but how can I advertise?
---
I can’t.
---
I hope they do add NV content and it's all 1st exclusive. 
---
I want to see a bunch of people bitch and whine, while also reminding them that NV was far buggier at launch than any other Fallout game.
---
Can't wait to turn the tables on those charred bastards
---
So riddle me this Batman.  Where in any of the 1st advertising did it say they'd be giving away free shit every month?
---
Know why Bethesda swears the price tag on the first ranger reskin was all a mistake?  PR.  When 1st released people were PISSED and the last people Bethesda wanted to piss off even more were the people that were actually buying into it, so as soon as the entitled masses started storming reddit about how it was a ripoff that they actually had to pay for their exclusive discount Bethesda went into immediate damage control mode and made that shit free.
---
What a coincidence that they just happened to start giving away free shit and all of the shit they'd planned on selling to 1st members disappeared at the same time.
---
remember the mysteries questline sends you there really early....
---
IIRC, I did it at L27 w/ a vampire machete.
---
This made me giggle.
---
What system are you on,  will keep an eye out for you!
---
I played 2 or three rounds an hour or two ago, but now I'm just getting infinite loading screens too. I can load into adventure mode just fine, I'm on Steam (PC) with autofill off. I also tried loading into adventure and then immediately into NW with no luck
---
Edit: Now I can't find matches at all
---
This should be a new cult though it seems followers end up dying when they follow that path....
---
Perfect numbers my friend. Exactly it doesn't need to be superhuman just noticably better carrying capacity given it won't have the resistances of other kinds of armour. Between higher weight and it's 4x yield it can keep a place in the game the whole time.
---
I'm sorry but this is a Bethesda game... so
---
LOL 🤣
---
PC
---
I've been one shot before /w full health when trying to claim a work station before and also in a trap base after I unlocked a door
---
You can craft legendary weapons now?
---
because bethesda are indefensible without resorting to falsehoods
---
That’s true I’m just dumb and can’t read
---
I be bloodied, I be meta!
---
Yes I agree with this because I missed out on my gold bullion and scrip because of the outage
---
LOL 😅
---
Man! I had to read a book instead of playing my video game, I need compensation...
---
I thought it was more people talking about seeing what’s in vendors before traveling to the base that’s my bad
---
😂😂😂 No mate. Maybe you are tired?
---
This looks awesome! I wish I had the tire plan lol, well done and thought of!
---
RNG good luck, level 270 still hoping.
---
Switchblades are my favorite weapons :)
---
I bought a couple serrated mods earlier today at sunny top.
---
If you are PS4, I can mod it for you.
---
Maybe
---
eBay 🤷‍♂️
---
a whole several days.. wow
---
How much do you weigh?
---
Ive edited it now, i didnt explain in the best detail dont worry mate!
---
For me I'd like some QOL stuff like vending having its own tab in my storage, keys going in a key box/ring, gold being a Max per week not day, etc
---
Right, I got 870 serums, and one machine. That leaves me with 11 spots left over. So ppl see 870 misc and like weapon and armor. My camps mobile and I down wanna sell a shit load of heavy weapons and armor in 4 machines, when I can get 640 caps for a .25 pound serum.
---
I thought the same, respect!
---
Not sure if you know the technical reason, but if you have items like the chemist backpack it registers as you not wearing it when you die so you become overweight and if you’re over weight when you die you can only spawn at 76 unless you’re close enough to a location like your camp.
---
I have always found him around that large semi, either on it, or a ride close by, on the ground.  Also once inside the closure of a game in a corner.  I have also searched 30 minutes the first time and kept looking up videos and it was frustrating.  I usually skip it as it is either easy or a pain it seems.
---
Yes it is, or at least used to be.    
---
Shows up on my mod screen requiring ...  Steel and fiberglass, IIRC.

Your prospective customers take a guess and a gamble, or just don't bother if it is across the map.
---
Nice work! But I'm really curious about that wooden steps stair in right back... Does anyone knows where is that from? Thanks in advance!
---
Avast!!!! That's awesome OP. It's a credit to the wasteland!
---
It's not bad... Not a god roll, but it's definitely useable until you find something better.
---
In the middle of the park
---
AA is terrible on energy gatlings. 25 is decent enough. I wouldn't use it, but I'm sure you'll find someone who would
---
the only reason that there isn't a decent respec system is because of bethesda incompetence / shortsightedness. though it's understandable in a single player RPG, it's not exactly common or popular these days to not allow players to respec, but in a game where you took out most of the content and slapped down multiplayer in its place, people will get bored far, far quicker and respecing is one of the few ways to alleviate that boredom, it's inexcusable to *still* not have a decent respec system in a game that's been out for almost 2 years, especially when it is one of the most requested features. fo76 is only an RPG by the very loosest of definitions, i'm also pretty sure that there were ways to respec in previous games with the console, at least on pc.
---
I'm sure they will notice your absence.
---
I just go shopping for gear. I picked up a 90% weight suppressing Teslagun today... Nothing about this has ever been about "a challenge."
---
You are trying way too hard. Go play Dark Souls or some shit... Goddamn dude.
---
Tag a few in the parking lot and get the bots to ruin their day.
---
the problem is when you dont have a bloodied heavy gunner build so a tank heavy gunner build what is the best gatling plasma to get?(besides junkies) because explo ones arent dropping anymore
---
I highly doubt the Developers/team that original installed the crafting system from Fallout 4 into 76 still work for BGS Austin. 
---
I think that would explain why so much in the game either never gets fixed or the fixes break. They just don't have the staff devs who know how working there any more.
---
Compensation for a couple hours of not being able to play? I don't think it was a big enough deal to warrant compensation, honestly.
---
That is a glorious photo.
---
What a personal question 🤣
---
It’s just a bug with power armor
---
I agree that the uptime tp date has been pretty great overall. I do however also think that a 10 hour or so outage (across all there online games) is a big deal for any service provider (even if it’s a non critical service like a game) no matter what their track record has been so far. 
---
I wouldn’t expect any comp and did not intend to further bash Bethesda at all. I was pointing out that I think it’d be wise of them to be transparent with this community re cause of this, especially given how passionate and emotionally invested people are. I think they could benefit as a service provider in doing so. That’s it.
---
But relevant...
---
Don’t get me wrong I still love the game so I’ll be back, but things like this are just annoying as hell and shouldn’t be needed.
---
Probably duped.
---
OOFF-  
---
Hate when that happens. My mind is an empty canyon too often and i go into auto pilot on that game with junk
---
Because they can.
---
This guy isnt on the council and doesnt know what he is talking about. In fact your friend must do an AMA here with you as the conduit and sponsor and both of your fates hinge on your replies to a range of questions. The proceedings commence at midnight on the second Monday of every month.
---
Only one needs to drop then people start duplicating them and trading their dupes for new items to dupe and pass them around. Before you know it good stuff is everywhere.
---
Russian hackers getting in practice for the US elections.
---
This is lit
---
Your first sentence really sums up how I've been able to play this game almost daily since Beta. Some things are quite ridiculous imo like no text chat or quests and NPC's not working properly, but no point in getting pissed about a game I've gotten significantly more than $60 worth from.
---
Just saw you accepted my friend request. Do you still need a Garb of Mysteries?
---
I just don’t get how having fun, playing in a lightweight, non-grindy way is trying hard... I just enjoy doing the powering up events and don’t power my way to a goal.
---
We kinda figured as much.  
---
I just wasnt wearing any at the time which i thought was weird. I wasnt all funky looking before i teleported but the moment i showed up at his camp i spawned nightmare fuel.
---
Didnt know that was a common bug though, i took a break for a while and just getting back into it so its nice to know these "features" exist lol.
---
Thought the serums were listed under Aid?
---
Your vibrator switches to manual mode.
---
Since your level 25 imma let you on a good  thing   that i still enjoy very much! (lvl 371) 
---
Get some power armor doesn't need to be fancy just decent resistance some chem and  stimpack   
---
And get a chainsaw with the flamer mod as funny it seem  almost noting in the game has flame resistance so i been running around with something that on paper does ''20'' but its a Vfast weapon which make it do some stupid damage ((best part is the chainsaw  is lvl 25 ))
---
Cheers dude, hope that is definitely the case, was worried it would be a reoccurring thing!
---
I was farming herds like that to craft explosive bait so I could fail fasnacht. Good times
---
Now move it on top of a mountain.
---
It was never fixed.
---
Finish the Wayward quests and you get the plan. You can craft them for every level. But I think they start at level 10.
---
Sounds about right
---
I love this game
---
Private servers were down all night last night too.
---
They should issue at least 50 or 100 atoms for those who pay for private servers but were unable to access them as a sign of good will. Don't think that will happen though.
---
I got my eye on you!!!
---
Yep. Happens to me quite often. I also get stuck in VATS sometimes.
---
This, I eat and learn everything, I don't need caps or gear, my character keeps on learning.
---
The Purveyor sells them at 50 scrip each, and each build uses 2. As I said, you have no control over the outcome, it is possible you will only make 1 star weapons, but also as possible that 3 star units come out, but none of the perks are beneficial to you.
---
This is a case of Random Number Generation, and people will pray to RNGesus in hope if getting at least 2 stars that work.
---
These problems aren't just bethesda. My phone is going down, our power is going off, cable going down. Certain people are reporting cyber attacks world wide right now. I'm hardly gunna bug out about a day or 2 of 76 going offline. I'm more worried my info will be stolen, or these bigger problems continue.
---
Go read the news. There’s major internet issues in America and Australia.
---
I mean you can kill pretty much everyone in crater’s instance

Very much so!

---
infinite loading screen here, too.
---
Ok thank you
---
aw man that looks cool as heck.
---
You are even trying too hard to "beat me" in this absolutely inconsequential conversation. It is terrible. I am going to block you now because I cannot even handle this shit. Thank you for reminding me why I have avoided you people.
---
And the C.A.M.P.s items should have zero or very small budget cost; otherwise we can never buy them
---
Well obviously I can’t guarantee it won’t happen again! But at least it has not recurred for me since it happened last month.
---
keep your expectations low lol
---
Yikes lmao, just leaving the vault now
---
If this happens and you have friend in thee world or a survial tent you can respawn on those too
---
Just play and not worry about what anyone says. The game really isn’t that bad. I’ve been playing since launch and it’s come a long way. If you need helping clearing things or get stuck just ask around or look up videos.
---
If you’re on PS4 and need it modded to shielded before you find the plan, I can help. Only “expensive” part is each category requires different flux. 4 to be precise. Vault suit and Vtu suit are cobalt.
---
Do you remember if you got it from scrapping or a plan?
---
Xb, thanks though I'll look around for it
---
Just make it so there is a set amount of turrets
---
Are you working on the mysteries questline, and do you have marsupial?
---
  One way to deal with them is to go up to the door of the building to tease them out - when they start coming to you, drop a mine in the doorway, turn and run to the fire station (the green building behind you).
---
jump on the roof (marsupial) of the firestation, roll grenades off the roof, then snipe them when they retreat
---
-then fed them to the tigers
---
Dont suck!
---
Depends if you think it looks good. Personally I think it looks stupid as hell, but to each their own
---
I had the same problem. I ended up having to initialize my ps4. Pain in the ass. Had to redownload all my games.
---
Well its arguably the best armour in the game, but your obviously at the mercy of rng to get the rolls you want.
---
Imo its worth it, as you choose what piece you want to craft, and its guaranteed to be the highest tier
---
Unlike the perv where its totally random, and even then you could get light armour
---
Wholesome content
---
yes. it's best non pa armor
---
It's tough doing that solo your first time, nice job
---
Sush it was really Singapore
---
I want more hairstyles, tattoos, facepaint too. Merc outfits from older Fallouts would be great also.
---
Stupid question here. Can you not wear an outfit over it?
---
Don't sniff the pipe!
---
You can. 
---
I love mine. 
---
Get the buttressed mod and it gives you unrivalled DR
---
Is this what the vault steel is for? I've just now decided to use my gold I've been saving since wastelanders hit.
---
I guess the rest depends on the build you're going after.
---
That’s great creative thinking on your part. Big 👍
---
Vault steel is only used for Strangler Heart PA, and the Thorn and Solar scout armours
---
Secret service only need legendary modules as qell as random scrap
---
Clean af.
---
No vault steel needed for SS armor
---
Nope I bought it just before launch through Bethesda my steam is totally unrelated
---
Set passive mode to yes. That way after level 5 you don’t accidentally initiate PvP.  Change it later if you want to try your luck. 
---
Workshops: claiming them gets some XP. However,using the extractors is SLOW.  Also,irrespective of your passive settings you need to know that workshop areas are ALWAYS PvP zones.  Some players will attack just for giggles.
---
"..But i'll continue playing anyways."
---
Okay awesome! Thank you so much 🖤
---
Definitely sniff the pipe!
---
I guess I should hold off on secondary mods then. I just got enough for my next purchase today.
---
I saw that one in the game as well.  I’m really hoping for another round of new paintings for camps.
---
Vault steel is for T65 I assume. Legendary modules are needed for SS armor, so start stocking up on them now, 10 a day limit on purchase.
---
just gonna copy and paste my answer from earlier today
---
For early game put a couple of points in luck and take pharma farma. This increases your chance to find meds in the game. This is a good thing. Also. After 50 when you start making your perfect build you'll probably need at least 5 in luck as that is what a build with mutations needs.
---
Early game scrap every weapon and armor you don't need as you can learn mods from it and also you get valuable scrap.
---
Junk is king in this game. When you build a camp try and build a camp near a junk pile so you can harvest it. Also buy the collectron from the atom store ASAP as that will also collect junk around your camp.
---
Capturing workshops is a good way to earn goodies and xp. It also gives a free fast travel point. You then get quests to defend as it is attacked. You CAN defend them but if you let the workshop get taken by the enemy the quest to retake it is easier as there's only one group of enemies. When you build something in a workshop if the number of the junk needed to build is green then the junk comes out of the workshops supply. so go HAM!
---
I am. I always bush wookie. I wish the ghillie suit didnt come off when I got armor...
---
LOL
---
Yeah it’s easy in fallout 4 since no one else is building. It would be cool to do the same in 76 but the servers just can’t handle camps with 10000 pieces
---
Room for more in that community?  I’ve also only played solo other than community events it might be more fun with other people to farm nuke zone mats, ect.
---
Really? Dont they do ass damage?
---
Ah ok , do u have discord?
---
Been playing about 6 weeks now.  It has more glitches and bugs than it really should for a top tier game, but outside of that it is a hell of a lot of fun.  Don't rush the quests, just have fun exploring the new environment. Worth it.
---
Pretty sure that's gunna be a pet
---
Itd definitely be nice
---
Definitely is I’ll see if I can get the discord link
---
 [Todd Howard Didn’t Like That.]
---
Yep, not sure what my ID on discord is off the top of my head.
---
I thought the fix was to make it say "legendary enemy has mutated" regardless of it actually being legendary?
---
How many modules are needed to make the whole SS set?
---
I always thought it was a little pointless having a limit to prevent inflation with a game as glitchy as this, theres a new dupe technique every month
---
Ive rebuilt the Database but do you recommend initializing it instead? DM me to let me know please.
---
i think bethesda will never allow fast travel mats for camps because they can be used for trap bases.
---
Yeah, how many people were in the server?
---
r/FO76roleplay is a great place to go to make friends and have a little fun learning about factions. You can also hit up our Free States Discord, we have players on all platforms and love to help people! https://discord.gg/6VA8Uq No matter what welcome to Appalachia there’s a great community and fun world out there!
---
Beating a dead horse? You’re kicking at dust and bones, friend.
---
Well thanks to you I just found out there is a bullion cap.  I’m still at 3500, but I’ve not bought anything yet.
---
I know I spent a week on it, and when I finally had it... we had the displays disabled... I had been playing since beta and this was the first time I balanced the budget and used a bunch of displays.
---
Need a Fixer Skin desperately, I have a really lovely one and I'm so nervous everytime I go near a scrip machine 😂
---
An AR15 style gun would be nice. I hate that stupid ugly, bulky assault rifle. I feel like in an appocalyptic situation, a handmade based on an AK wouldnt be a vault dweller with the Gunsmith perk's, first choice.
---
I don't know how, but they are, they're duping b2525 handmades
---
We have the 10mm
---
I always give out the 'official' advice, but of course when it's offered its hard to say no...i know I didn't...🦝👎🎉😡🤣😍🦥🤔😉😉😢❤️🤖👽
---
Mine is set up just north of huntersville at the lead deposit thats there. For the longest time i didnt know there was a random "event at the intersection north of my camp. Every time i head to camp theres either a random settler/raider event or some variation of enemies fighting eachother. Its always fun taking a peek to see what ill get lol
---
The assault rifle looks like something youd mount on a ww2  airplane lol
---
Well that's another purpose of this thread, to show awareness to those who didn't know either. So the thread is already worth it now. lol
---
and it isnt good enough...
---
Yup. When in doubt, I pull out my trusty executioners shovel. And still sometimes one shot things but it at least gives other players a chance to get hits in.
---
It pops up from time to time on my loading screen. Always creeps me out. Love it!
---
Ha. Love the whole 'compensate me' mindset. If your local shop at the mall is closed for urgent repairs you don't roll in expecting free stuff, do you? If it's been caused by Ddos attacks, it rates the same as asking one of the stores looted in the riots to hand over free stuff because the shop was looted.
---
If however, the cause was Bethesda dropping bad code and breaking the servers, the you could expect a style of remuneration, but that's only if Bethesda admit to buggering up.
---
Yeah, it sucks, but you must forsake armour completely to become a *True* Bush Wookie. 
---
Personally, I use my camp and the Brambles from one of the bundles to make portable bushes. 
---
Takes only a little budget, and I can cover a huge amount of space, so I can dodge grenades easier.
---
Or being able to use legendary modules to level up an awesome legendary thats only level 15 : /
---
I guess I owe you a few Nukashines. 🥃🥃🥃
---
I bet that probably works pretty well!
---
Probably had the same effect as the mutant hound howls, it aggros the nearby enemies so that they are looking for you.
---
I’ve been thinking the same, the datamines have some decent items and the SCORE system will allow you to purchase tiers with atoms if you really want that stuff quick.
---
Ok, in my town, the power was going in and out, the power company called us and was lying about what was happening because they said it would stop after they put up a pole. It continued and I knew exactly what pole they were talking about. During that same time, my ex, my friends, my grandma, and myself were all having cell phone problems. Our cable was also cutting out. My friend a week ago told me there were cyber attacks going on, just today the prim minister of australia came out saying a government backed program is hacking into everything in their country, but others as well. I think everyone is scrambling to either stop what damage is being done right now, or prevent it from happening to them
---
For real dude. I would love to pvp, but there are just too many duped cuck weaps still floating around and even the legit ones are more than enough melt peeps. Base tier, non legendary weapons would be awesome and a specific set of "arena" perks that dudes can use to suke it out. Make it and event and add some cool swag to entice people. I love this idea!
---
I like to camp on the awning on the opposite side of the golf course entrance and blast them through the windows. They tend to crowd and it becomes quite the easy shooting gallery. If you stand far enough back, they can’t reach you. You might need the marsupial serum to get up there, it’s been a while. But that’s my spot for many levels now.
---
Run. That shit tore through my level 50+ toons until I got good gear and the marsupial mutation.
---
One for each piece, the issue is when you want a particular effects. I just finished my set of unyielding a couple of weeks ago, I am still rolling three pieces since they do not have what I am looking for.  A friend of mine has rolled ones that I would use and I have rolled ones that they would use but since you can't trade it off to the scrap heap for them.  I have probably went through at least 100 modules to get my imperfect set of 5.
---
Yeah, it takes a while to set up, as you need to hide your camp too, and there's always a chance you'll end up sharing if it's too large. 
---
But it's pretty effective.
---
This is the only explanation LOL
---
That would be a good backup weapon if your main broke.
---
Completely agreed -   
---
Though sadly, I think the Atomic Shop content drip is going to slow down tremendously due to seasons. Personally I'd love to see more and more things returning from previous games. The DKS-501 Sniper Rifle for instance or some of the classic armors from the previous games like Classic Leather / Metal / Combat armors.
---
It's one per piece, so technically 5, but it will be all random legendary effects 1* to 3*.  That's the rub, you have to keep crafting them until you get the roll you want.
---
Unlearn your hoarding ways. Stash space is limited so it'll be a delicate balancing point between scrapping for resources or selling for caps. Scrapping also is a way to learn mods for weapoms and armor. 
---
A way to help up your carry capacity are backpacks. The 1st one can be attained through the Morgantown airport terminal. 
---
The regular one has to be achieved through the Pioneer scout quest. To do that you'll need a camera, to get that get the free personal terminal in the atom shop, build it in your camp and look up the suspicious person quest. You don't have to complete the "bucket list" quest, you just have to repair it and make film (collect silver, crystsl, adhesive as well as other mats) The Pioneer quest will take you to some moderately high level areas, be prepared to sneak. Also you'll need to revive someone. Search the Reddit here for someone looking to the same and revive each other.
---
I found him on the ground inside one of the large square shaped booths where they would have some kind of skill game
---
I have a really good tip.  Slow down, take your time and explore all the low level areas.  You will level up while doing this and it will extend  the life of the game.  From what I hear the endgame is pretty bad in this game... why would you want to get there quick?
---
Ahhh.. there's always a catch lol. Thank you 🖤
---
I don’t remember.  I’ll have to look when i get back online.
---
I picked up a 1\* vampire switchblade when I was about L65, serrated it at some point thereafter.  Its been my primary weapon ever since (I’m over 200 now).
---
I got a 2\* ghouls slayers and 2\* troubleshooters (both w/ swing speed) during faschnacht, wanted to serrate them as well.   The option was there, but I didnt have (fiberglass).
---
I know I’ve scrapped a lot of switchblades along the way, but I couldn’t tell you if I learned it through scrapping, or if I have a plan.
---
Exactly where I (eventually) found him!
---
You could be level 125 and they would still F you up
---
Don't rush through the game.  Take your time.  Don't always fast travel.  Enjoy it.
---
Any suggestions for the best one?
---
You are not really meant to level up fast. There are double xp weekends now and then that can help, but short of that you'll need a higher level friend to hold your hand and help you out if that's your goal.
---
Had this happen. Then after a bit the game had (crashed) frozen hand then would not shut off so i unplugged it and it got stuck in safemode. That's a pain... even after doing everything possible and even then after Finley getting the game back on my hard drive it was unplayable. Would not load my toon, the world ext. So i Ended up getting a better hard drive to fix it. Blue screening and stuff leaves broken fragments in your hard drive.
---
I finally got the gauss shotgun today and crafted 10. Got 1 berserkers, 2 instigating, and 1 junkies. I can see how that would be annoying. Thankfully I’m a junkies build and got a really decent roll. Plus instigating is nice too. It should be a minimum of a 3* though.
---
Damn I honestly have only used vats like 20 times in the hundreds of hours I've played and haven't encountered that bug fortunately
---
The mirelurk mating season one, next to the scout camp.
---
Couple? Can you not count? It was at least 6 hours. for working people, that is almost an entire day of free time.
---
Bethesda allready lied that everything in the atom store would be only cosmetic. That ship has done sailed. Not really much we can do about it. At this point I’m just really hoping for some better fallout 1st content in general. that new armor paint really disappointed. I love the look of it but its recon and wood armor only. Maybe at somepoint Bethesda will put in a little more energy on fallout 1st items
---
Theres a clean toilet coming in the seasons system which is coming 30th
---
you can craft some legendaries, all the bullion stuff from wastelanders is legendary. you have to buy legendary modules to make them which you get by selling legendaries you don't want
---
Sniff The Pipe!!! SNIFF IT!
---
If we pay a subscription to that mall, you bet your ass we do. Fallout First players have every right to demand compensation for the time STOLEN from them.
---
I’m level 114 and never had a problem with this until I started using the Tesla auto rifle. Had 3 or 4 incidents as soon as the event ended. I switched to passive now.
---
Can I unlearn tire iron and rolling pin plans and such please Bethesda lmao
---
I sniffed it good, looked to the skies cuz it was nighttime when I did it hoping I'd see like a fuckin Lovecraftian horror in the night sky or an alien spaceship but unfortunately the devs aren't that cool
---
It’s so annoying
---
That's a fucking bad comparison. People with 1st are paying for a monthly subscription. But imo I don't think the downtime was long enough for a compensation.
---
Forgot about that one👍
---
You making a joke or does it actually give your strength  an increase temporarily?
---
I don’t see a plan in y inventory so I must have learned it through scrapping
---
requires makeshift warrior 3
---
1 each adhesive, fiberglass, oil, and steel
---
I see a lot of responses about why Bethesda doesn't need to compensate people. Let me tell you morons, Bethesda created the problem when they put time restrictions on content. Once they decided you could only trade-in a finite amount of scrip or treasury notes, they created the issue of time being a problem..... they did this to themselves.
---
As I stated on other people's responses, players that are paying for fallout first, are paying a subscription based on time, they have every right to demand compensation for the loss of even a single minute that is not standard downtime. I hate to break it to you, but this is the problem that Bethesda ASKED FOR when they made the choices that they did.
---
Cool thx
---
BGS: we suffered a catastrophic issue that caused many of our services to go down but we worked long and late hours to get everything up as soon as possible, so you had as little downtime as possible. 
---
OP: I couldn't pway. Gib me money.
---
So from what I understand in order to find a legendary Gatling laser I need to have learnt how to craft it? Also how do I craft the legendary weapons?
---
They would sell atomic shop stuff much more frequently if the weapon and armor skins were like the PA skins that work on all weapons/armors, and even simple paints to apply like black, red, gold, platinum, etc.
---
Plus it would be nice to see some actual cool and badass style stuff over just a fraction them or cutsie styles. Let's have some high-tech fancy camp items or hideout style themes. Theres plenty of goody and silly stuff, give us some cool stuff
---
Man, that looks cosy.
---
You must really be a party pooper
---
I appreciate your offer. Thank you very much. However, I'm a PC gamer. Perhaps someday all platforms will become united. Microsoft is already starting to make this a thing in some respect, but it has a long way to go.
---
Or double Gold? Or double Scrip? Or a basic functioning game?
---
Having a higher level number won’t really help you kill tougher bad guys. Having better gear and perks will. Admittedly the perks come with the levels. But the gear comes from playing. Join the easy events whenever you see them and take your time.
---
You can buy the plan from foundation, and once crafted, you can drop it, but the plan's not tradeable.
---
Not that I have seen. Would love to hear something about it.
---
Literally fallout 76 killed the hard drive in my ps4 pro after a lil over a year of playing it. The ps4 was new i bought it just to have a ps4 just for fallout. If it starts freezing at the main screen your hardrive is toast. Its easy to change them. Like super easy
---
Just the other day I bought the max weekly gold from smiley, not realizing there was a gold limit. I had 4980 at the time. I was furious.
---
To be fair, I was able to play mamy other games online,, GTA, division 2, monster hunter world and update others (US here)
---
The issue seemed more BGS based. 
---
Don't get me wrong, I think the OP is the problem with the feeling of entitlement people have. Just see my post here.
---
Ok, your local gym is shut because of a munter driving thru the entrance, and is shut for a weekend for repairs. An understanding member would accept it was out of the gym's control, and carry on the following week. It's only the complainers and entitled that would expect a discount, or compensation for the disruption. 
---
'Hey! Where's my free drink bottle, sunglasses, and towel?'
---
Could you imagine how many caps people would have if there was no limit when the gifts were duped?
---
You get the serrated switchblade plan from completing events in the Toxic Valley. It is a random drop, so expect to farm a while to get them, or just buy the mod from a vendor.
---
Wait wait is there a double XP weekend??
---
I agree with the life-of-game-extension but it’s still funny that your suggestion on how to ‘level up fast’ is to play the game slow and take your time leveling up
---
Not that I've seen, and I have been looking out for it. But that hasn't stopped the **sycophants** from abusing people who are simply asking for a little transparency 🤦‍♂️
---
I mean, intelligence has a factor in how much XP you get from killing enemies. But like others have said, take your time and enjoy the game. The endgame isn't much fun, most of the time I just find myself grinding out queens for flux, xp, and treasury notes.
---
If you are on PS4 and your Dad still needs it, I have a couple,  that I Earned. I sell them for 10k to 12k.
---
Ok, a few. Sorry. It's 6 hours. Thats, as you said, maybe a day of not being able to play. I don't see what the big deal is? It's not like you have to be on Fallout 76 every single day of your life. 
---
If it was down for a few days, maybe I'd see your point. Or a week or something. But I don't really feel bad if someone didn't get to play for a single day. Play other games. Not a big deal.
---
Well he has nearly 2k hours on the game and never got it and This is his main game so I'm sure he'll get it just fine but thanks for the offer
---
I know "everyone" hates the cap limits, but I'm honestly impressed by how well inflation has been controlled in this game. Keeps it very friendly to new players. Kinda curious to see a histogram of how many caps  active players actually carry.
---
I’m right there with you. In the first few months of the game being out, there was a really nice role playing wasteland doctor set up just across the bridge from the Overseer’s camp. They sold aid items on the cheap, player-to-player, and had a bouncer that attempted to keep rowdier folks in line.
---
I sell teapots, tea recipes, and some aid items in my vendors, mixed among the usual stuff. Gotta give some respite to the folks breathing in all that phosphate ash in the toxic valley.
---
I wish there were ways to really bring in more of a role playing element to this game, but like you said, I think it needs to be on team/group servers or a different play mode to be pulled off.
---
All the other responses are spot on, but you asked, and the short answer is lots of killing. Doesn’t matter what level, the exp you rack up killing numerous amounts of anything is higher per min than any quest you could do. Lower level, farm the scorched around the top of the world and the adjacent resort cabins. Higher level, check out west tek or any area that offers groups of charred feral ghouls. You’ll also net plenty of ammo.
---
Free is not a discount, though. I mean, argue all you like but a discount is defined as a deduction from the usual cost of something. If something is only offered at $0, it's not discounted, that's just the price. Just like a skin being 500 Atoms is not a discount, that's just the price. 
---
They say no where that they will give away free items every month in the advertising. They did mention persistent private worlds, expanded CAMP budget and Atomic Shop discounts. Whether they still advertise those or not is really a moot point. The point is that they **did** advertise those features, and have not delivered - even if you invent a new definition for the word "discount".
---
Edit: [This is pulled from Bethesda's website](https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/article/3r1YDnDtyO1CtNFbJX6RBJ/fallout-76-fallout-1st-announce) which mentions everything: increased CAMP, Atomic Shop discounts, persistent workshops.
---
Can confirm this, I use the red one for my ~~Blood Angel Astarte~~ vampire in power armour character.
---
damn, I was hoping by then I could take ‘em out with a punch to the head
---
Where did you get the concrete tire walls?
---
Three words: Chinese Stealth Suit. You’ll be amazed at the results. This plus the right weapon and perks and you’ll be one two and three shotting basically everything in the game outside of the scorch beast queen, the level 100 sheepsquatch, and the colossus wendigo. Charred ghouls are one shot and flying across the screen.
---
I'd love a 1911 ingame! But I thought handgun builds currently aren't actually viable, no? Doesn't that whole situation need a bit of work...first?
---
I’ll look at the Wiki to de how to get it
---
Watch some of the countless YouTube videos on fallout 76 leveling. Do quests, kill things.
---
good call, I’ll try that.
---
Wow, they’re glowing
---
Completely viable. Just not as good as rifle, heavy, melee. Sure they certainly need love but are still very functional when done right. My main is a gunslinger and can hold his own. Probably suprises alotta people at events lol. Pretty much a rifleman/commando with 2/3 damage, would be closer to 3/4 if handguns had tank killer.
---
I find that pretty fascinating considering how much you had to avoid to not get gain exp and accidentally level up.
---
Definitely want nice kitchen counters. Better displays like floating shelves and larger capacity cabinets. They should also fix how lighting is as often areas aren’t properly lit. Also robot vendors or even companion vendors.
---
Oh I’ve seen that in game.
---
I take advantage of the Union uniform and the traveling leather coat changing the appearance without needing to re-skin the backpack. I like that it looks different with some of the outfits that come with packs.
---
Looks for Events. they have legendary creatures that drop legendary items. you can take those items to train stations if you don’t want them and change them into “scrip” (this is an old mining currency in WV). that scrip can be spent at the Purveyor at The Rusty Pick for random legendary rolls on ranged and melee weapons and armor.
---
True. But I timed it perfectly. I got a bear suit and then bam I am allowed in the sever.
---
My build is stealth and shotgun, with the Chinese suit it feels like cheating. I won’t hold up for anything in pvp as a level 50 suit is 140/140, but nothing ever sees you. It’s sneak attacks constantly. Lots of other builds could destroy me, but that’s not who I’m fighting. Most beasts have zero chance. Lvl 50-80 scorchbeasts are two to three shots and done on the ground. Lvls 40-70 of everything else are usually one shot and done. Not for everyone, but fits my sneaky weasel style just fine.
---
I need one of those
---
That's consistent with my experience. It only takes ~5-10 rolls or so to get a 'good enough' one to tide you over but probably closer to 20-30 to get an 'almost perfect' one but honestly that's better than having to spend weeks or even months hopping CAMPs and hopping severs and hoping someone somewhere has exactly what you're looking for.
---
Your first time?
---
Comes near the end of the foundation quests.
---
I use an anti armor Gatling plasma, I actually like it and use it regularly as my backup. The faster fire rate is always a huge plus with heavy guns
---
thanks for the heads up
---
I assume this is at the Colonel Kelly monument? The radstag spawns are absolutely ridiculous there now
---
Bethesda... Bethesda never changes.
---
Marsupial Mutuation is the most versatile mechanic for any situation- in this case it is best for escaping ghouls and picking them off at a safe height.
---
Glad to help. Lots of possible builds out there. And the game lets you have the freedom to constantly change it up, so no worries about committing to one path. Lots of pathways! Good luck to you!
---
I gotta get that mutation. Seems like everyone I run into has it already.
---
I need shark repellent
---
I’d like to imagine some dude dragging them out after clearing an area like an assassin.
---
The scavenger at the entrance to Flatwoods. The dogs ran after me and I watched as this scavenger ran around the garage to flank the dogs. It was magnificent.
---
Heh  correct. You'll need to find a plan, or have a plan drop from an event that you get rewarded random items and plans. Then once you've learnt how to craft a basic one with no perks, it becomes part of a list of possible drops for your character. You can also buy weapon plans from some of the vendors, shop around.
---
As far as crafting your own, this is a little more work related. You need to have done enough reputation jobs for the Raiders or Settlers to have access to their specialty weapons, Gauss shotguns, and mini guns. Again you have to buy the plans to be able to make these yourself.
---
There's also everything from the Secret Service, but I haven't really done enough with them to know exactly what is on offer there.
---
I like being forced to reloading my Gatling plasma when there is still 4-5 rounds in the core. So now I've got an inventory full of useless cores and I keep forgetting to drop them in the trash.
---
Also, has anyone else noticed encrypted is messed up? I've had it twice now where I know I've hit the assaultron and I didn't get any loot off of it. And my rewards didn't show up.
---
Assuming other people on the server are doing them, definitely try to join events and get shots in on enemies and let stronger players finish them off. Recommended events: Riding Shotgun, Radiation Rumble, Uranium Fever, Feed the People. Even if there is only one other person on these, more people are likely to join when they see at least two people participating.
---
I do find that the daily faction quests for the Raiders and Foundation are pretty generous and easy. If you don't like the location they send you to, try going to a different server and it will reset to a different location.
---
You’re transforming into a wendigo!
---
first time you should just go with the flow. do quests. explore.
---
when you're making an alt then yeah. Power level the shit out of it
---
I got it done by dumping all perks I could into slugger and then glow sight for nuke zones. And I ran any decent power armor I could.
---
