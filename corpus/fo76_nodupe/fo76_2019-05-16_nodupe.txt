You jumped in to troll...I jumped in to comment because  some innocent players did get affected and I’m not a tosser like you. You threw offence at me and I don’t but up with little bullies like you....if you had a brain you would check account histories

Hmm. My water consumption seems to have increased dramatically. My buddy also said he's constantly running out of water. Food seems okay. Could class freak be broken for thirst?
---
No it doesn't. It says when it's powered it shows up on the map.
---
It’s annoying because this happens to me, but it also let’s me place things when they are red sometimes. What’s the point of the color if it doesn’t mean shit?
---
LOL.  Your character looks like a legit crazyperson.
---
Go suck an egg sicko geeze, at least I'm telling you to do something healthy, what if I hurt my foot kicking rocks?
---
It’s not a fix. Stop referring to it as such.

U can scrap and learn them or pay to have someone put it on I normally charge 500
---
If the ghouls are not max level try white springs. Otherwise just just go from location to location killing stuff and discovering places. And do all events you come across.
---

---
Whitespirings will usually give you between one and 5 legendary items as long as you don't mind 99% of them being 1*.
---
There are so many locations that people just ignore because they are not quite as efficient as white springs. Going from the train yard and farm above white springs going south till than follow the train line toward cranberry bog usually gets me a 2* or 3* each run if no one has cleared any of the places out.
---
Events are good because a chunk of them in the higher end leveled areas give you a legendary enemy to kill.
---
Also. Try the Treetops in the more. Since the update I've found so many max level glowing legendary enemies. I would say 1 in 7 times I fast travel there I find one. So when i go to drop off tenical data I fast travel there now.
---
I'm with you about the size of the habitat.

Honestly apparently no one knows

Dev room is only PC as it takes rewriting memory, the dude that got the mask either sold it to a Duper or is one himself and that’s where this comes from, so don’t feel bad for him.
---
I know crops have a bigger radius than the actual object for being placed. You cant have crops too close or they will "intersect" even though they arent even touching.
---
Rofl so you take numbers from 2015 Which means fo3 had been out years longer than NV. NV passed fo3 after fo4 got popular and drew people to the series.
---
So you complain about dates and how long things are out yet take the numbers from nearly 5 years ago as proof now. Lol
---
i know that struggle- sometimes i log in late at night and someone's at alpha - wife's looking at me like "have you finished", im like "war never changes, someone's at alpha" lol
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
also, why does no body farm ws after the nuke circle has finished.  i still get 3\* legendarys, but all to myself :)
---
I also use a rifle on my character who is about to hit 100. Get all the rifleman perks, the perk to craft more ammo as you run out alot (that or trade ammo you don't need for other players 308 and stuff, my friends give me their 308 and 5.56 while I give them shotgun and other ammo). I use speed demon mutation but that's just cause I went through over 75 radaway without getting any more mutations even with unequipping and reequipping the mutation perk. There is also a perk that you can get in luck that increases damage by 15% that's worth getting as well as a perk I believe is in strength that increases your cripple chance with rifles but idk for sure. I also use concentrated fire for vats but that depends on if you use vats or not
---
If you learned the plan of how to make the refrigerated one, it will work with the other backpack as well.
---
I’ll give you that a ban generally implies a longer or indefinite term than suspension, but when you are suspended indefinitely you are effectively banned. 
---
Seriously, though, the assumptions I made don’t seem crazy- you’re free to clarify what happened but that’s a ridiculous story. 
---
You’re free to taunt. I’m a grown man. You may taunt all you want, I’m going to sit here and call you a liar.

It's weird no one really knows. Some say there's isn't any difference, some say there is...

I’m a pvp player but also have pve chars, I’ve played since beta and have a massive inventory of high tier gear, and over 15 full build characters including several 150+ chars would love to help you out, my Gt is EazeWIN I’ll be on during the weekend and can help you out with whatever you want
---
Dang it. Last update says it was coming in a few weeks.
---
Now the lastest "inside the vault" says it's not. Will be coming in the future.
---
"However, Patch 9.5 (May 21st) will not include C.A.M.P. display cases. We are still working to ensure this feature will provide the best experience possible once we bring it to the game with a future update. Thank you again for your patience, we will be sure to share more details about display cases as we get closer to releasing them."
---
I'm on xb1 and not experienced this but I have had automatic fire cause hard crashes and freezing lately which hasn't happened in awhile.
---
It's really silly. I want my corn maze one day.
---
a 3 word title __isnt even close__ to descriptive Mr. "a new bug?" courtesy of your post history.  that is far from anything considered descriptive and very close to clickbait
---
second off was i even conversing with you? no, i was conversing with the other user who hasn't responded
---
There are random encounters you can find in game, wether it be mannequins in a circle or a pack of dogs lead by a Mr handy, or even a travelling robot that sells some of the rarest outfits in the game, they come in all forms. They can sometimes be found as an eyebot that plays a message referring to a location in game to get players to go find that place, which may contain a quest or be a key story location. These are quite common out of the many you can find. Not a bug, but a useful and cool feature!
---
They are posting on new and the mods are deleting then, not to mention the stimpacks guy who sold all his 25 stimpacks and only got 225 caps is in this thread.
---
This happens on a daily basis and it drives me insane
---
Saw a couple kids with 100+ stacks of them the other day in their vending machines. After filing a complete report I noticed they started disappearing one by one. One of them rejoined before their final buddy left the server and I noticed his base was gone along with his armor and weapons. He ran up to me and began punching me before I blocked him for the session and fast traveled away.
---
That's because the purchased ones are separate items
---
Also if I wanted karma I could do ten thousand things that would actually work. If you [or anyone beyond this commentor] gave a crap about themselves, others, the game, the community or even just this sub you're all happy to passionantly defend you'd be talking about the glitch. Maybe reposting and tagging and asking me to talk about the glitch or just being half hostile and half inquisitive but no there are just self centered jerks like you who think everyone's self centered like you so that *must* be what this post is about.
---
Dunno if it's related but I've been picking up magz the past few days and I'll get the animation and the visual confirmation that it's picked up but when I look for them in my inventory they're not there
---
I cant risk my TSE ultracite laser rifle so that's why I'm looking for the plan.

What is your chest piece called? Is that some form of raider armour set?

"he was banned from driving for a year"
---
Just a year isn't permament figured you needed the definition I by no means am saying your ban is permament. It's the exact same thing as saying you were suspended.
---
Dang! No worries lol, thanks for the info, nonetheless.
---
Just let us place anywhere and give us more options for rotating.
---
Shotgun is mainly strength, rifles are perception, and pistols are agility. In my experience though you are going to want to choose between either rifle or pistol as they are very similar in that they are single shot per pull of the trigger and have similar stats. Rifles fire slower but hit harder while pistols don't hit as hard but fire faster. It's more or less personal preference. But whatever you go for, make sure to get all of the rifleman, or whatever perks that increases the damage of your weapon for the max amount of damage possible
---
Started with meele weapons, but now, dont have enough power to kill or survive. So just running around for some kills and loot.
---
Hopefully it isn't pushed back too far, I'd be so sad. After the display cases I hope they can do junk and power armor too, I swear power armor takes up most of my stash, but it looks so cool I don't have the heart to get rid of it. I'm a pack rat with stuff like this
---
i was reading a post on this subreddit about that. not sure if a work around was posted but was related to joining a server with an other camp already present and currupting the game save
---
Let's compare upvotes and see who the real troll is in this the community, this sub is unpleasant because of people like you, your other post was taken down for a valid reason, all you had to do was edit the title but instead of a simple fix you make a whiny post crying like a bitch and insulting other people. Vary mature and not troll like of you, hurry up and leave already.
---
Thank you for that. I had looked within the pip boy but your directions were very clear! Thanks again!
---
Mention of it [here](https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/article/5v7FIGaz3bakvwrXsOZerZ/fallout-76-inside-the-vault-the-purveyor) in the patch 9.5 bullet point
---
That dude is a pure tosser though Haha.. I dont really get reddit

. All I see is cowards that hides behind usernames and keyboards Hahaha none of these people would have the balls to ever say  something like they do on reddit to your face bahahaha ;)
---
Lol, a bit far from California. I do actually dabble in leather working though.
---
I dunno, I feel like most of the items are JUST within believability for what someone, on thier own, with limited tools (a drill press and a dream) would be capable of building.
---
Oh right you're just commenting on a comment on my post, I'd better ignore it because it's not public. Also *LOL* you had to go to my post history? It's right here in this post, the mod commented. Can you read?

No prob totally understand if u do want do research I’m pretty well know on fb I only deal really with lasers both laser and ultracite I’m the on that posted I own every variation of explosive laser mike Nusbaum is my fb

Nice job, man!  Great spot and good size on that piece.  That yellow looks packed in there tight.  I'm betting that red is going to need some retouching, but red seems to fall out of a lot of peoples' skin really easily for some reason.  Most of the hot pink on my arm is virtually gone after a little over 15 years, and I had to get it recolored twice during the sleeve sessions.  My skin just hates reds and pinks, and I have about the same fair complexion as you.

The Insult Bot said (to me) that he'd heard the vault dwellers were trying to make Appalachia a better place, and that one more nuke could make that happen - if it had been dropped on Vault 76! 
---
When I interacted again he said, "Just walk it off!"
---
Yeah but the way Bethesda did it was for anything that came in and not out ... I think I main thing would be to ban those who still have large quantities as the biggest problem cause but the Jan duper’s was server load that killed the game. It did have a big impact on economy too, but I think this past 2 weeks of duping will have the biggest impact on economy as the duper’s knew exactly what is valuable and how to get around things learning from before. But bottom line is that the servers Bethesda use will always allow duping so until they fix that it’s goi g to be an issue.
---
My hero! I have 4 stable fluorescent flux...  hit me up on PS4 (on now): Lewwwd. And thank you soooo much in advance.
---
I doubt they would add it as a new weapon, but I could see them adding it as a machete skin as the hacking motion is similar to how one could assume a Fallout npc would wield it.
---
You can find players selling them for between 200 and 500 caps.
---
My Nocturnal Combat Knife gets to the 250+ range and that seems to do the trick. ;)
---
Thanks for the tips, i’ll be sure to do this to get the mods for these weapons!
---
If you made the refrigerator mod for the backpack you have now, you should be able to make it for the other as well.
---
Just craft the new backpack, see if you can add the refrigerator mod to it, and then add the skin.
---
I got to laugh at this one.
---
I have a shadowplay clip of this happening to me. Not sure if I can just send it to them or not.
---
Nice to hear. Will add you.

Don’t be too proud to go back to the forest for a while if you are overmatched by enemies in tougher areas. It’s easy to farm meds and ammo and junk and xp in lower level areas then use all that to break through the mid game
---
You're whining about me complaining about actual content. Lol
---
:) HMU if you need anything I play the game ritually on the weekends so I’ll most likely answer and come running, I use a mic. And don’t mind partying btw
---
Also upvotes and downvotes =/= trolls. That's literally not how that works.
---
That's what everyone is saying I am just wondering if since Bethesda stated "find the Purveyor" in the 100 Day Road Map and the locations listed were in the game files, if everyone is going to head to Berkeley Springs and find out that it's one of a few locations.
---
A fire axe is a good melee weapon for lower levels or a sledge hammer I made a new character and that’s been my main weapon (and a hunting rifle) and also idk if you know this but whatever guns you find if you scrap them you learn new mods for that weapon
---
I think you can submit it on there ticketing service at bethesda.net
---
I'd like the option for a milky dead eye, like we could give our character in Skyrim.  I keep adding scars to my character as he levels, and a dead eye (or missing entirely) would be kind of a nice touch.
---
It is and I'm quoting bethesda. You obviously dont work for them so you're just another typical reddit user.. your $0.02 have been noted. 
---
Heres is the quote from the official email from bethesda.
---
"  this account's access to Fallout 76 has been suspended until such time as this issue is fixed in a future patch. Once the fix is live and confirmed, we will reactivate this account and notify you that you are able to access the game again. "
---
Have a nice day
---
Yes, and you have to do the entire questline on each character to earn a backpack.
---
I really hope we can set down junk and other items. Would so stack my kitchen with prewar goodies.
---
Is it true or not that Bethesda accidentally released the personal information of customers due to negligence?
---
Yes.

&gt; Check out any other mmo if you wanna see what a real grind is. I
---
You need to understand that a good many of us came to this game having no prior experience with MMO games because we don't play them and we only bought this game because it's a Fallout game. 
---
  
---
We don't give a shit what's in other MMO's or how they work.  We don't care that "all MMOs are like this." To people like us, it's just shitty game design.
---
No, me and other commenters are pointing out how stupid and pathetic you sound, leave already, you don't want to be here and no one wants you here, I feel bad for your fourth grade classmates who have to put up with you Irl.
---
Sweet Jesus that sounds amazing
---
No no trash. The “fix” is for the bug. You being banned is the consequence of your actions.
---
Ya, it's not a skin. It's a separate backpack.
---
That's without armor penetration?
---
What's your strength at?
---
I guess both, cause my mom white my dad black. I have a huge Bush of tight curls to the top of my back. Think Chakakhan.
---
Look at the reasons you're being downvoted, holy shit I hope your parents beat you, maybe some day they'll knock some sense in to you.
---
Oh, now it all makes sense.
---
Ok, some help in building the camp. The main things I did, but some advices will be nice. Just looking all around for any tips or help. Don't need caps, maybe some ammo.
---
I have all the rifleman perks and the concentrated fire, but I also feel like my armor isn’t the greatest and I am unsure of how i can get better armor.
---
Another redditor who doesn't understand how reddit works? Dude, learn to use reddit! This is probably why this sub is so inactive.

__"now viewing single comment thread"__  this is a thing on reddit. maybe you should learn how the site works as a whole?

its much faster on mobile to just click your user than to sift through comments to find info like that.

i also dont see how that has to do with a clickbait thread title but ok.

Deathclaw hide is found in yellow containers not on deathclaw sadly
---
You know if you buy the backpacks from the atomic shop it might allow you to have one without doing the challenges
---
&gt;So which do you want? free content over many years at the expense of expediency and perfection or to have to actually pay for content they have to pay people to make?
---
No I want the ability to add whatever mod I want to change whatever I want in the game, just like their previous games that are still more popular than this game. 
---
&gt;Seems like many of the people out there complaining want to make a self fulfilling prophecy- "the game isn't AAA, there is STILL a T-posing raider in the arena!!!" or sales are low because people overhyped the bad "They are now charging for updates!!" -or- ""They pulled the plug when they said it would be here for years!!"
---
I hope it does die soon so we can have the private servers we were promised to mod as we see fit. There is a reason Minecraft is still one of the most popular games out a decade after release, because of modding, just like every previous Bethesda game. Instead of this failing "live service" model that isn't working out for any of the current studios, look at the poor reception of anthem, etc. That push for the whole "live service crap. Nobody actually wants that except the share holders. 
---
&gt;and yeah, there was issues, but understanding what causes those is somewhat important, like the fact that no amount of beta testing would have prevented this from being a mess in the beginning- there are just too many computer configurations and not enough time or money to do it (meaning investors want a return, and the worst thing you can do for future investment is "delay")
---
That is just untrue, if that were true you'd see many bugs in games like Lol or PoE, since both lf those also have to run on countless different computers as well. 
---
&gt;on top of the above, in case you didn't know this whole project is a "beta" for future games- and no, they never said that outright, but it is pretty obvious
---
Exactly, kind of my point about the whole "live service" crap nobody wants. Just like no one wanted the creation club either. 
---
&gt;and they havent opened the vaults yet- nor do we even have 4 or 5 star legendaries yet- and peeps gonna complain about ""end game"
---
Guess youve not datamined the npc dialogs coming, the new vault they are opening is for a battle royal style game mode, not end game.
---
Handmade and lever action rifles are highly rated and building and scrapping them is the best and really only way to get the mods.
---
Ya, I posted that paragraph above. It was pushed back. Was supposed to be in patch 9.5.... not now. No idea when it's coming now.
---
Or when they camp vault 76  and you just spawn and get mowed down by 2 lvl 70s
---
Was pointed to this gem which spells it out pretty clearly:  
---

---
"  travel to the previously abandoned Train Station in Berkeley Springs and find the Purveyor within. "
---
 Get out there and have fun. Experiment with weapons armour and tactics to get a feel for what you enjoy. Expect to be wrong about that as time goes by.
---
 I was in my 70s when I discovered my beloved Combat Knives and since then my life has had more focus as I buff them, Stealth and attendant attributes/perks to a symphony of stealthy death.
---
 I also hunt Scorchbeasts for fun and food. But that's another long storey.
---
I know, but mod is random for all guns, or just for the gun you scrap? Can they duplicate?
---
I did had a while ago issues even with excavator parts vanished - up to a rifle.
---
Got the tip that it might be because of item renamig and haven't the issue appear since i change back to standard.
---
But up to now it's digging in the dark as far as i know.
---
&gt;This is why I'm a proponent of certain events temporarily disabling legendary effects to put everybody on an even ground.
---
yeah great idea for the shooter looter MMO
---
They changed it back to a score.  Basically you get points for how much xp you've aquired.  If you kill someone you get 75% of their score added to yous and they go to zero.  
---
I don't mind it too much, I rarely encounter pvps even if I'm in the top 3.
---
Probably not. Buying the red enamel stove didn’t give you the stove plan, and I’m not gonna buy it to skip the grind because that’s fucked
---
Handmade... :)
---
I can click on view all where it says now viewing single thread and I want my comments to be relevant and not repeats so I actually read other people's comments and don't pretend I'm the only person in the world. Can you reddit? Because it seems like you have trouble clicking on the word you have no trouble typing out. Btw I am also on mobile.
---
There should be a code somewhere around it that you have to pick up if I’m remembering right. In a piece of wreckage nearby.
---
In my experience killing higher level ghouls as well as nuke zone legendary enemies helps. I almost always have high health so I use the vanguard legendaries which helps boost resistance while high with health but there are also legendary armor for low health so it's personal preference at that point. It is really Grundy getting armor though. I would suggest whitesprings golf Club though for farming

---
I definitely agree on the separate characters issue, I'm hoping they will change that after beta and the only reason they allowed it was to get solid data on pvp issues. They patched it again unfortunately, its now based on survival points which is basically experience points plus if you kill someone you take a 75 percent of their survival points.
---
Lol "so sick of it." What did it happen, once? And let's not pretend you wouldn't do the exact same thing. Your insufferable whining on here all but confirms it.
---
First time that happened to me I ran into the hotel. Lol
---
I offer free water with every purchase 😁  I started to write it on the wall behind the vendors but was interrupted by a gulper after "free water"
---
First it's not a fix, then it is. Haha ... YOU are trash .. I hear your momma callin' bahaha
---
You have to dl photos to imgur and share a link from there. 😊
---
Nope. You still can't craft it until you've earned the quest backpack first.
---
That would literally be pay to win. Skip the grind by buying it.
---
My sneak attacks from range do about 250 or more and if I double tap they go down. It’s tweaked auto so it fires two rounds almost simultaneously as it is.
---
Dayum maybe *you are* what's wrong with this sub. Maybe they should put you down.
---
I start to walk as soon as I spawn in, it usually gets me out before the vendor camp spawns
---
Nice username
---
&gt;They did this and removed multiples of Items and used said data to ban players.
---
&gt;No offense but it's hard to believe you when every "when are banned players being reinstated" post tells the same story.
---
This wasn't a troll comment but it's cute how you White Knight yourself and even have a conversation. Lmao you're such a loser have fun being BANNED.
---
Lmao yet again you called me a bully ooooohhhhh did I hurt your feelings? If the actually very nice an reasonable stuff I said hurt you then you'll never be able to handle the real world. 
---
You're a sad and miserable person who will never amount to anything. Unless you straighten out your life and grow a spine then you may amount to something some day. 
---
TL;DR : get off your Moms tit it's clear she's been coddling you. And it's painfully obvious both those accounts are you. It's the exact same writing style lmao.
---
You being banned is not in need of a fix and you’re fully aware. I’d ignore your messages too if you’re this dumb lol gg Bethesda
---
Building them. You know? Like out of the materials we find lying around. 
---
You would intentionally build a shitty, holey wall with broken windows?
---
Well, I am gonna try and figure that out then lol. thank you for the reply!
---
You should post the players name so we can avoid him or hunt him down. You can steal his crops if nothing else.
---
Yeah no hopping. Lol
---
God I hope you mean dreds
---
You already tried and failed with that insult, leave troll.
---
Huh, if they fixed this in a patch, I wonder if they can fix all those tse energy weapons? ;)
---
The weapon mods you learn can’t duplicate you learn a new random one everytime you scrap it (unless you’ve learned all of them for that specific gun your scrapping) example picking up 10 hunting rifles and scrapping them you get 10 random new mods for the hunting rifle
---
Again, it was removed because forum rules say to be descriptive in the title. You put "a new bug" that's vague. Can't really be more vague than that. It's not descriptive. You simply had to put more info in the title.
---
I don't know. A voodoo rasta? Like in Predator 2?
---
I had an explosive pipe pistol that I built into a hilarious and largely ineffective mob killer., Full auto and drum mag.
---
If you think that's bad, [read this post I made during the last week that camps were easily destroyed in Adventure](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/bl3rud/sometimes_you_just_have_to_respect_an_evil_genius/).  Truly dastardly, and required quite a bit of planning and teamwork.
---
Well done.
---
The knives are my main. They have almost everything appropriate. So there is 3 points in Incisor and my Strength, Mutations etc is reflected in the Damage. Its around 15 most of the time.
---
 We get to 300+ quite quickly as Adrenaline kicks in, but less than that one shots em'.
---
 That knife has no AP. Its a Nocturnal, 40%+ speed lightweight 3*.
---
i like how you keep up with these insults, but fail to read things like where i state  "its faster to hit profile" or better yet, the rules that state to have specific titles?
---
"actually read peoples comments" good joke 9/10
---
 "Shit gone wrong," is a lot more vague
---
Read through all these comments then get back to me, know what, don't come back, read the comments, realise how ignorant you're being and try to grow up.
---
I’ll even see if I’ve got a spare lvl 1 explosive weapon
---
Welcome, good luck
---
So better scrap then sell to station vendor for 2 or 3 caps?
---
If you think post history &gt; context... sure
---
Ok, thanks for all the help! Good luck in the wastelands!
---
Yesss Ive been speculating this as well with the figures in the art. I think itd be hilarious if they had the NPCs treat us like we were another Vault experiment gone wrong. A bunch of mutant shapeshifters that they assumed killed all the survivors, responders, raiders, free staters, enclave, and brotherhood in the area.
---
No problem. Good luck to you as well
---
They are completely separate items
---
Dude, get off planet. You're not welcome here
---
In the universe where we are the consumers. Reddit is not the platform for this. You will only receive hate.
---
Same thing happened to me at my base. I had to pull all my base down and rebuild. In the end I gave up and just rebuilt all my base.
---
I care.  Please don't go.
---
Logging on now, might wanna bring a little bit of leather just in case, feel like I may be low
---
Well we do have repair kits and technically your not buying a skin when you do
---
If your running 5 or more mutations it's definitely worth classfreak even w/o it hitting speed demon
---
Is there an easy way to get the blueprints for the lever action rifle? I’ve never even seen one of these in the game.
---
nope, but i believe descriptive &gt; clickbait
---
Well at least you admit you don't practice what you preach
---
Have the option to make a trailer park with friends
---
So true! The only reason my base is where it is, is because I couldn't find anywhere flat enough to place my pre-set.
---
Which underarmor do you want?
---
Lmao that dude is not me, believe what you wish :) 
---
I believe you'd never EVER say words like that to anyone face Haha. 
---
I dont  know this other user, but I know you're a typical reddit scumbag that hides behind a user name, keyboard and whatever else you use to shield yourself from the real world. 
---
You obviously have nothing constructive to add here, just typical troll activity. And yes for the record here I would chalk up your actions here as bullying, it sucks when people do it to you, yes. But doing it to others dont make it right. 
---
The rumors I hear that when people go off on the "i'm a big man, and better than you" nonsense it's just a method of compensation for lacking in "other" departments .. glad to say I don't have these issues Haha ;)
---
Have a nice day! :)
---
Nothing in my camp is locked.  It's a big hotel-style structure across the tracks from the Whitespring Station.  I would really appreciate people closing the front door after they cook, sleep and play my piano, or at least closing the door to my indoor garden where the rad shower and crops are.
---
The inks are soooo good now a days. I can't wait to see this thing in 15 years! I hear you on the reds for sure; has always been the toughest color to hold.
---
Right, I now only need someone to make the mod XD
---
Definitely in my opinion at least, I always pick up all the chems I can then sell it to the station vendor (except stimpacks and radaway) because apparently chems sale for more caps than guns in this game lol
---
Your delusional, you started all this with your assumptions and not not face value of my original comments. Not even going to comment on the rest of your vomit.
---
And we'll all float on okay
---
And we'll all float on alright
---
Well i use class freak anyway. The question is whether i should get speed demon as well because i don't know exactly how the downsides are going to affect me
---
Grafton Station. That’s were I got mine. Grind up about 1800 caps, pop any grape mentats you have and they’re yours
---
Delusional ain't the word with this thing Haha
---
&gt;You jumped in to troll...
---
&gt;That dude is a pure tosser though Haha..
---
Just some similairities also you both seem to know what a tosser is? 
---
&gt;Hahaha none of these people would have the balls to ever say something like they do on reddit to your face bahahaha ;)
---
Uh-huh really?? I was quite reserved on here today. I'd have no problem letting you know you're a loser to your face. But we're at least an ocean apart so that's not going to happen. 
---
Besides I'm certain your Step Dad tells you you're a loser every day just before he nails your mom.
---
I really wish I had seen this before I sold my 3☆ medics rifle
---
We are all in agreement on one thing, right? If we meet Preston's ancestors we either kill them or tell them to stop trying to be helpful, or do things for themselves.
---
let's compare upvotes and see who's more welcomed?  Thought you were finished with this sub?
---
I'm a Gatling Gun girl myself, or at least I was until they made the sight work, now my drum magazine takes up 1/3 of the screen (and blocks the sight), 1/2 if I'm in Power Armor.
---
That would be awesome!  Just something for everyone.
---
Yeah it seems like a given .
---
At least the archer exam put a smile in my face because of the possible "arrow to the knee" question.
---
and...... they allowed character to cross. Honestly what am I suppose to do as a new low level 7. I shoot at a level 151 and I don't even damage him with a bolt action pipe weapon and he can blast me with his mutated broken OP explosive tesla rifle
---
I use knives, but also run a Power Armor setup too. With Pain Train perk active all I have to do is charge at the miners to score a tag, so the appearance is me rushing past you to slam into the miners, then stepping away. I'm not there to steal your kill until we've all hit them, then it's free kills. But nothing annoys me more than some level 200+ one shotting the 3* and doing nothing else.
---
A good handmade kicks butt.
---
I had a piece disappear when the imposter sheepsquatch was released, one of my calibrated shock Excavator legs. Haven't had anything disappear since, I heard early on that there's a bug where an item will just randomly get deleted.
---
I’m on PS4 and will be on all day tomorrow if you want to come look :) the whole building is dark until you walk thru the door and a trip wire turns on all the lights at once :)
---
And it's for sale at the moment i read somewhere else
---
It’s the last thing in the patch notes. It was added after the original notes.
---
I hear you.. Had to switch to basic magazine but luckily gatling doesn't eat ammo fast and reload is fast even with the perk for it. Clears up the screen nicely.
---
Want to do backpack quest, but this is imposible
---
OMG ROLMFAO Like clockwork talking to yourself again at least space comments far enough apart so it isn't OBVIOUS......
---
You're too much please keep commenting I need something to do while I replenish the fluids I lost in your mom.
---
If it's what you got...
---
I'll definitely have to try that, I love my TSE Gatling Gun.
---
That is actually in the game files as one of the unreleased atom shop items.
---
But it's not craftable until you've earned it so you're not skipping anything and it gives the exact same stats as the original. There's no benefit to buying other than a cosmetic style. It's meant to be a skin but it's a shitty implementation of it because it's not actually a skin. (Are we really surprised by this one? It's Bethesda. Love em, but come on.)
---
The repair kit.... That's borderline. Very suspect and I could argue both sides so I agree and I don't, lol.
---
Excellent tip
---
I’ll get you a good gun, however I’d like it back at some time and I can make you a decent set of lvl 20 armour for the future, I’ll also get u a set of power armour and you’ll fly through all quests
---
Accidentally repaired my crossbow with this equipped when I was going for a scout badge. Never thought I would curse this card.
---
Generally the level 5 of this is great but I'm finding that the repeater rifle breaks down abnormally quick.
---
I FT'ed to a huge camp/store. The owner placed a bed right above where you spawn so you can use it to get unstuck
---
&gt;Or, just get a little sticker and put it on your monitor.  Let's see them ban you for that! ;-)
---
XD, though I understand what you mean, for others reading, in Fo76 there is a crosshair present and you also have the ability to disable it in options on your own accord. Meaning, replacing that horrendous dynamic cross of a crosshair with a minimalist dot would not be an advantage over other players, or shouldn't be considered anywhere near the word "cheating".
---
Farm it. (tatoes, corn and muttfruits).
---
At some point, you'll have too much of it.
---
Great, thanks. But can I ask you if there is an armor type that is generally seen as the best type of armor, or is it all preferential?
---
Cook starch then scrap it or kill bog creatures like mirelurks
---
Well how else would YOU recommend contacting them after 3 months of being ignored on their own platform, twitter, Facebook etc. 
---
I'm sorry you dont like my post.. all you have to do is nothing ;)
---
Best guns there are &lt;3 Gatlings that is :)
---
It looks like every plan except for the quest only plans may be available at vendors. Not sure about that but most are there.
---
Scrip-palozza Server! Nice
---
Well you are going to look like a real idiot to those on reddit who can distinguish accounts....yep I’ll keep them coming for you, keep your trolling up too.
---
I got hit with this the other day on top of the White Springs Station. They got me the first time, as I play with pacifist mode on by default. 
---
When I clicked revenge, I came back, popped a med-x, and ran around the nearby water tower a couple dozen times emoting while my teammate’s buddy shot at me. Never firing back or approaching, I literally just ran and jumped around in a circle emoting finger guns. 
---
I don’t know if I convinced them I was a young child, not a threat or just annoyed them (maybe all of the above?) but eventually they stopped shooting and ignored me.
---
Once they turned around, I popped the breakfast of champions (whiskey and bufftats), sneaked on to the roof and gimped them both. 
---
It may not have been the most honorable or efficient PVP kill in 76 history. But damn it all if it wasn’t hilarious.
---
Welp, it wasn't me. I normally leave fuel, a Molotov, and fertilizer on doorsteps.
---
If i'm feeling generous, I instead leave a sweet roll or s'more with lemonade on the kitchen (or closest thing to it) table.
---
Touche. 😂
---
*Junkie’s
---
Uranium Fever event is a good way to make quick caps, and there are always three 3* legendaries in there. If you take everything off of everything you kill the WS station is a short walk away to sell it all off.
---
You on PC? I might have a spare low level legendary weapon somewhere, depending what she likes to use
---
If can't find any one for cheap, the enclave now sells plans for 5k less with hard bargain.
---
Now you're just making stuff up Haha.. 
---
Another typical reddit dummy..  bye! :)
---
I'm on the 76 marketplace with high karma, and have done plenty of mule transfers for people. If you are on XB1, I can mod it for you.
---
Definitely, I love most of my heavy guns but Gatling Guns have always had my back since I started using them, although I adore my new 3 star TS Fatman.
---
Deal, just want to feel all the beauty of the game.
---
Lmfao love it. :)
---
K thx 😂😂
---
Where does this event happen? This sounds like a great place to go farm.
---
I don't think they're compared much as they're different ammo types.
---
I go combat rifle personally though. Handmade is better than assault rifle for 5.56 ammo
---
Played since day 1.  Got the lemonade last week.  Just got the camera.  Haven’t killed a mothman.  What’s a sheepsquatch?  
---
RNG, baby.  You either got it....or welcome to the club.
---
Ugh, these are like the people in Fallout 4 that used mods to build a perfect pre-war sanctuary as their settlement. It's immersion breaking, looks terrible and doesn't fit the game.
---
BUT you can't craft it until you've actually earned the ability to make backpacks. So you're not skipping or earning anything but a new style when you buy it. Only reason I won't call this p2w.
---
Hey look I'm "talking to myslef" what an ansolute fool bahahaha
---
It's bugged so once its in your inventory you learn without reading. I imagine it will be patched tomorrow
---
The minute you try and sell the plan it destroys it, same with dropping backpacks.  At least I believe so.
---
I agree. Grind for weapons and steel. Weapons to sell, scrap them for steel for ammo. Get bored, walk across the street and kill some ghouls, or try depending on your level. Just remember to drop your junk at the vendor.
---
I spammed uranium fever.
---
I don't think vendors sell it
---
Another day on reddit.. here come the mom jokes Haha heard them all amigo, all you will do is make me smile and laugh...  so mission not accomplished I assume Haha :)
---
[/u/itsthebiggjohn](https://www.reddit.com/u/itsthebiggjohn)
---
Lmao you can’t even come up with an insult so you just default to “Reddit dummy”
---
THAT is what wood armor is for...
---
Who do you voodoo bitch?
---
I'll hang on to the plan just in case my backpack is no longer high capacity tomorrow and I need to actually consume the plan to remake it.
---
Plan, incorrect
---
Backpack, correct
---
High Cap is bugged, you learn it when you hold the plan, then pass it along to someone else, and they learn it
---
Most of the community has access to the mod atm, expect a patch tomorrow to address it with Murrrmph
---
This has been an issue since FO4. I would get 20fps in FO4 due to huge settlements or being in downtown Boston with lots of enemies. Anywhere else and I'd get 140 fps.  was surprised FO76 runs as well as it does as I regularly get 60 fps with occasional 40 - 50 in nuke zones or really busy areas.
---
Dude, they replied to a previous post of yours
---
&gt;These accounts have been suspended from Fallout 76 until this issue is fixed in a future patch. Once a fix is live, we will reactivate these accounts and notify the owners that they can access the game again, but any further violations of the Terms of Service or Code of Conduct will result in a permanent account closure.
---
What more do you want?? Duping still exist so the ban is still active. TBH [serious not trolling] it may be permament I don't think they'll ever patch out duping.
---
It’s right by WS station, but I’m pretty sure there’s currently a bug that shows it a little further north of there on the map. (Event still works just fine, though.) Heads up they’re glowing level 40 mole men so depending on your level it can be tough.
---
I don't have mods but i learned the plan and can build them for you. Not sure on going rate, but willing to go real cheap if can provide the materials.
---
Yeah, I'm just holding on to it for the time being.  We'll see how everything shakes out tomorrow.
---
I don't have a farm, I seem to find duct tape, or wonderglue all over the place.
---
Pathofcinders....psn name
---
If I remember correctly from mobile games, I think they can tell if you buy atom. Tin foil hat time.
---
You are right.
---
Lol, yis
---
And it’s not in the tooltip
---
I carry it around like power armor, put it on when I get full and need to fast travel xD
---
Today I got severely overencumbered in the Savage devide, but I was about fifty feet from a vendor camp. Awesome. The only problem was that it was at the very top of a rock face, and I was at the bottom. I had to Jetpack, wait. Find a new spot. Jetpack, wait. 15 minutes later, I finally made it to the top with about 20% charge on my only core. He had full crafting available, and I was able to get my weight just below.
---
The best part? This saint had 4 fully charged fusion cores for sale for 25c a piece. Best hundred caps I've ever spent. Hats off to you, unknown player. You saved me hours of walking. I wanted to leave him a nukashine but my luck he'd log off without going home.
---
Literally nobody cares just pack up and go. Just unsubscribe like a normal respectable person and leave the rest of us in peace
---
Same :( I’m not using it....doing it same as you
---
Maybe don't lock your doors if you have vending machines. If I spawn into your house to buy something and can't get out, I poop on your bed. It's a shitty thing to do, but you locked me in.
---
Kill Anglers
---
Dolly sods workshop random spawning have reliable spawns for me
---
Results may vary ^obviously
---
Survival server's  were added as an option for people who want to pvp , players who want to use it as an easy way to level up should go back to adventure. From the beginning bgs said pvp would be a aspect of the game ,they have nerfed pvp on adventure. Now you want them to nerf pvp on survival, how bout you just stop crying about everything pvp and stay on adventure in pacifist mode
---
Why dont you just ignore all my messages and do is all a favor. Tired of little girls commenting like this all the time. Dot you have a life or something constrictive to do, of course not. You just bully and insult people here on reddit all day Haha :) 
---
Yes
---
Much love! +karma
---
I’m level 50 and still feeling my way around Armor to be completely honest. I will say that heavy leather is better than you’d expect and you can buy the plans for not too much at a Responder Train Station. Mods for Armor are harder to grind out though. 
---
Another piece of advice I’d have is to check out player vendors. I’ve picked up some real bargains among the over priced stuff. Quad lever action for 400, level 50 instigating hunting rifle for 200. I’m selling some good drops cheap too. A single good gun can make a huge difference, like my level 5 quad pump action taht got me to level 50!
---
You're thinking of a game developed by a competent developer.  This is typical quality for a Bethesda product.
---
If you wanted peace you would have moved along. It seems like you want a war, which is why you're here. Who wants to be normal? Did I ever claim I was *respectable* ? You make a lot of assumptions without reading comments bud.
---
 [SgtOKeefe](https://www.reddit.com/user/SgtOKeefe/) commented on my post [I love the game but the crashes on PC are just too frequent](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/blk2x5/i_love_the_game_but_the_crashes_on_pc_are_just/) suggesting to disable Intel's SpeedStep. I've noticed a huge difference on performance BUT i changed this setting the same day the new patch was released. 
---
I've enabled it again to see if what changed my experience was disabling Speed Step, the last patch, or both. If everything goes well friday i'll be able to play about 4 hours to play. I'll let you know here the results
---
It would be best if you could just see the stock from afar if you really wanted to by narrowing things down. I was thinking about a market you don't have to be online to sell with. Just have things delivered to you by a supply drop. Takes away from checking out bases though.
---
It shows this when you go to mod it. I don't care, as a stealth bloodied VATS sniper, I one shot everything before it sees me pretty much. I keep it on at all times.
---
I once had 2 Vampires Handmades at the same time just because RNG did that to me. I sold one to a player and I think the other to a vendor when I got a better weapon. I disagree that is good enough to ban somebody based on that.
---
I have 2 two-shot 10mm machine guns (although one is level 40 and the other 50) as well.
---
On the flip side I agree dupers can sod off.
---
Ummm...  Ever hit anything with a Grog Axe or a polehook?  You get knockdown like 60 percent of the time.  Or did you just mean firearms?
---
+karma no problem!
---
Just firearms.
---
Accepted. Feel free to join my game anytime.
---
Yay! It's Shitpost Season!!!
---
Are you playing Survival?  Maybe don't?  And what platform?
---
Yep, it's happened to me before.  I try to exert a little self-discipline by reassuring myself that missing that Scorched Earth today is simple to make up for by launching a nuke tomorrow with my regular gang at the reasonable time of 7pm when we usually link up.  I still need to finish my computer hacking tadpole badge anyways.
---
What more do I want? To be treated with somewhat respect which none of you ever will. 
---
Being ignored by anybody for over 3 months is ridiculous. 
---
They will, otherwise they would have stated permanently banned. They have full on banned other players before. This is different.
---
I haven’t even thought of checking player vendors and thanks for all your great advice!
---
You’re far better off looting buildings for junk than running extractors. Just the usual exploration trips have me loaded down with so much junk I need to throw some away.
---
It sounds like you’re trying to take workshops or have yourself set up in a relatively busy area.
---
Way cool! Looks like 100 caps for random roll weapon type and you can picknhow many stars!
---
there is perks that cause stagger, one gun army, enforcer and tank killer.
---
Ah I see. I kind of figured my save file was corrupted. If that’s the case and it can’t be fixed look like I’m quitting. Thanks for the info!
---
I just tse mobs at knee height lol
---
Are you specifically trying yO spawn them at appropriate places. All of these random events have set locations.
---
Whitespring ghouls and the maintenance shed.  And make it yourself, as others have pointed out.  Just get some fertilizer and plant tatoes, corn, and mutfruit.
---
I dont need to, you've done it all yourself! Hahaha 
---
See ya, wouldn't wanna be ya! (For real! Bahahahaha)
---
i get it, wasnt thinking. and no i dont agree with witchhunts. i was asked a question. i answered honestly.
---
Yeah I do uranium fever every time it pops up for the legendary spawns and such but I still haven’t gotten it. Maybe I need to have the previous tier plans before it’ll let me get it?
---
How many caps they asking? And the house better not get duped!
---
Lol this exactly how I’d imagine someone who would get banned would speak
---
The game itself was stored on an external hard drive, maybe I could plug that into my PC and see if I could find the files? 
---
Regarding saving new pics I’m thinking in the future I’ll use capture to save my favourite pictures onto the console, just in case anything like this happens again.
---
Brilliant response 😂
---
*rolls eyes*
---
I’ll be on in ten, you on the sticks ?
---
With a name like silent pudding you sure dont shut up Haha..
---
There’s plenty of stagger. Just run around randomly and trip over air. I ended up putting pneumatic on my chest piece, just to avoid the annoyance.
---
There is stagger, but it is tied to shotguns (which kinda makes sense) with Enforcer perk. Don't remember if there is anything similar to any other weapons.
---
one gun army on faster firing big guns is a nice perk to have, my minigun staggers for days
---
Pitcher plants in the Cranberry Bog give  digested goo x 2 with green thumb. Get it quick before it spews poison for 8 adhesive each plant. If you dont feel like creatimg a farm.
---
Level 21 deathclaw and I am level 172 - I have about 75% open budget since I’m pretty minimal in my camp life and yes only used wasteland whisperer 3- my charisma at base is 6 and with my armor it’s 16 and I’m on Xbox
---
Happened to me once. I didn't server hop at all, but one of my walls did get blown up by dogs?
---
https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks Use this to plan your build and level ups.
---
I think they're right around 300.
---
Thank you! I might talk to a couple of my more computer savvy friends and see if they could give me a hand, fingers crossed 🤞
---
Because the game locks you in to weapon types, you end up with weapons you know are good but can’t really use. I have a level 50 furious powerfist that I desperately want to use but am not remotely speced for. Many players are in the same place, and will happily feed junkie’s spears and wooden armour into the Scrip machine but feel bad about destroying a decent weapon, so they sell them for newer players who will appreciate them. Some ask for really high prices, but many bargains are out there.
---
I know right, thanks for the props amigo, have a nice day! :)
---
I tend to build my camps on cliffs, and whenever I’m putting down foundations or defensive walls at the transition from rock to dirt, this happens all the time. I feel like something underneath has been labeled as a static item, and it’s interfering with the placement of some items, much like the larger trees in the game. I can usually work around this most of the time, but it’s still frustrating when my wall SHOULD snap in place, but doesn’t.
---
&gt;What more do I want? To be treated with somewhat respect which none of you ever will. 
---
Please re-read my previous replies and show me where I disrespected you prior to you acting out. I didn't I have no idea where your percieved insults came from. I was quite civil and kind before I was insulted by you.
---
No it wasn't, it was posted on the 31st at 5pm.
---
It’s like watching someone with a small dick take pride in its size. I’m playing 76 right now what about you?
---
But you will get about 10% of their value. May be better selling for caps in vending machine.
---
ehh dont hunt him down. just avoid him. you cant grief him back. so staying away from him is the best thing you can do to piss him off.
---
At least you will get a three star.
---
Too late you can't walk back being a troll.. you have been exposed. 
---
Have a nice day!
---
Remember the update that shipped and messed stealth up, when they nerfed the demo perk card. I  was actually using a grenade build
---
Cpl Dwane Hicks
---
I was half expecting to see a picture of a mole rat fighting a roach.  LOL
---
I was down at Mt. Blair Trainyard today to complete my Railfan badge and a lvl 50 Sheepsquatch annihilated all but a couple mole miners there.  It lost maybe 5% health on the process.  I got a one star bloodied baseball bat, which sold from my vending machine promptly at 199 caps.
---
do the challenges, save up badges, buy the plan yourself
---
Not as I recall it. I was a huge star wars nerd at the time, and most of the people I knew just rolled with the prequels. They complained about \*stupid\* changes, like adding force symbiosis to explain something that didn't need explaining, but not about things that were acceptable but continuity changing, like the context of the clone wars and the lack of crazy clones. But when they went back and added the new!vader, many folks flipped.
---
You should YouTube locations for certain kinds of junk you’re looking for - it is much easier to find in world than to take a workshop now
---
Workshops are PvP, and you can gather resources better without them anyway.
---
As for your camp, unless you play on Survival, other players can't damage it.
---
That's why I spawn into my second floor then I fall to the ground because my floor isn't there yet.
---
Enjoying life &amp; counting money ;) 
---
Sucks to be you Haha :)
---
Ill just go play on one of my other console/TV combos I have.. 
---
Just venting frustrations regarding one account.. 
---
You can't make me mad lil trolly Haha :) 
---
Now carry on .. and have a nice day! :)
---
The life saving armor doesn’t seem to stack at all, I collected myself up a 5 piece set and jumped in front of a bunch of big baddies and they insta-killed me most times, I got a single rez once, but not what your expecting at all, I don’t think the benefit is beyond 1
---
Ill buy it tomorrow if you dont end up needing
---
Sheepsquatch would win without trying, even a lvl 50 vs a lvl 90+ glowing deathclaw.  I can get the glowing deathclaws in one headshot with my instigating hunting rifle, but I think a lvl 50 Sheepsquatch is more durable than a lvl 80 Scorchbeast.
---
Do you know if the fridge has neg? Might grind for that next...painfully
---
It does now, as of several updates ago.  There’s been no slap damage for weeks.
---
It’s bugged. And I felt the same way about that tiny jar. ☹️
---
All it takes is a lucky roll for someone to get a weapon that effectively trivializes the game.  That's fine when you're contained to yourself, but with group activities, it's kind of problematic since not everybody is going to enjoy you soloing the boss before anybody else can get a hit in.
---
The game is not hard, and legendary items just make it easier.  I'm not suggesting all events suddenly disable legendary effects, but if we're to talk about ways to increase the challenge of this game for an end-game situation, or to spice up events so that they're not inevitably easy, it's one of the logical ways I can imagine you'd do so without just making enemies have tons of health, armor, or kill you in one-hit.
---
Only thing I ever actually lock is the wood stove I managed to cram a lantern into as a light source.
---
I was teasing b/c I saw op posted there earlier and it got all the usual ‘76 sucks- be glad anyone plays it’ kind of comments. :p. It’s a circlejerk factory for some games
---
Bet they never thought about this method
---
My one and only TSE is a max level 3* pipe rifle. Don't remember what kind of enemy dropped it, but I've had it a long time. It's funny because being TSE only just barely makes it viable late game. It puts out decent damage but basically self destructs after about 200 shots
---
I appreciate the offer, but if I still have it, I'll likely give it to one of my good buddies that I play with pretty much every day.  Good friends are worth more than any amount of caps or god-roll weapon.
---
I had the same experience and then one day I decided to chase down treasure maps.  It seems like when I am chasing around treasure maps I always get random encounters.  Probably just weird RNG though.
---
And that is why I don't hand out legendaries anymore. Past couple legendaries I have been gifted I still have.
---
I also don’t recommend joining a SBQ fight as a level 17 ;) Some content just isn’t geared towards all levels (then you have fasnacht, which some complained was too low leveled for players who were mostly 50+ by then. 
---
But yeah- gotta grind out other events until you’re leveled high enough to hit some of those better milestones (and unlock better perk cards etc)
---
Well what else would I say.. I'm banned .. but I can still play!
---
Your intelligence shows with each post! :)
---
It gives -60 energy damage resistance and rad resistance. To me, there's no point to care about the rad resistance because that only effects you if you actually have armor with rad resistance on (At least for me that's what I've noticed). For example I have 55 rad resistance, so that's completely gone with the backpack. Could have a -5 rad resistance but it's not a big worry. The energy resistance isn't a big deal either when without the backpack, I have 466 energy resistance, and 406 with it on, thanks to the armor I have on, and the +100 energy resist from the Grounded mutation.
---
Oh derp, yes.
---
You buy the first 2 then shielded can drop from raider events.
---
Fever is just up alot.
---
This has happened to my friend on Xbox too! It might be because his camp is close to the overseers so a lot of people camp there
---
Which is why ALL PvP needs to removed from adventure, you want PvP go to PvP servers.
---
Nevermind, you're not talking PvP, you're talking griefing, there is a special place for you to go.
---
i think it is under floor decor
---
Never got it
---
Yes most definitely
---
Depends on what build you use. That will determine what you need to farm. Guns, lead and steel will become important. Adhesive is used for almost everything. So pick up duct tape and wonder glue always. You can always sell excess.
---
Who?
---
 You need to. Maybe Quentin's best.
---
I agree to a point. But this is a post-apocalypse game. Odds are most people would not be building beautiful fancy homes.
---
I cannot get past the 200 lb carry bonus of the excavator. I tried ultracite PA and even with calibrated shocks it's tough to lose the 100 lbs carry capacity. I need to harvest tons of guns for steel and the excavator is great for that. Also gathering ore with excavator is a huge benefit as it triples ore yeild. I like excavator the best even though it's not as protective as the other PAs.
---
I'm running into lvl 50+ enemies on main mission objectives because that's where people build their camps. Had to server hop 3 times to complete "signal strength".
---
I have 2 other characters past 80 but after a long break decided to start a new guy. I have no idea witch events to avoid until I'm getting wrecked.
---
I could make a 70 gal terrarium with all the useless glass I've dropped
---
Go back to the traveling robot that sells outfits where would I find that or a spot where it spawns
---
 Always leave the place open. Its just the people who were in the Vault with you anyway.
---
im sure it lowers your carry weight bonus from 60 to 30, same with armor plating
---
Make sure the name of what you're photographing shows in the upper righthand corner when taking a photo.
---
I felt roughly the same way and put it off for a week, but honestly it’s not too bad. Had them all done in a day and got back to the regular grind. 🤷‍♀️
---
Same here. No update either.
---
Learn first plan. Server hop back to same vendor and buy next lvl. Learn it and repeat. That's how it used to be. Don't know if it's been changed.
---
I didn't think you were some people are weird about usernames being posted even in screenshots
---
I unlocked water,  but I had to lock my junk extractor. I do,  however,  usually dump extras st the train station across the street.
---
Try again and again. Didnt have a problem with the camera ones and I’ve done 209/257 possum challenges and 74/84 tadpole challenges. 
---
Worst ones by far:
---
mothman wing
---
deathclaw hide
---
royal jelly
---
cant get to work so far:
---
musical challenges as locations and play different instruments.
---
medic is obviously because stimpack diffuser not avalable and the frog habitat one doesnt seem to register.
---
Got you mate. Put everything on 1c and...yeah... what you've said your gamer tag is? :)
---
Nah but for real - got all ammo on 1c... I mean i don't need it, a few days before i gave them away for free, would feel a little bit as a rip off to me to sell them "normal". Also all plans between 2c - 5c, except some rare/uncommon ones between 20c to max 50c.
---
You’ll always look bad on here asking about suspensions, you can’t win. Nobody will believe the bag story even though it did happen to a bunch of people. My first account was suspended for picking up a bag of guns I should have never touched and I swear on my mothers grave I never duped but it doesn’t matter. It was a mistake I made and have to live with. 
---
I got ahold of support through zenimax a week or two ago, all they will say is it’s still under investigation and can’t help you over the phone. When I said it’s been 4 months they said “I couldn’t tell what is or is not an appropriate amount of time to look at your ticket”
---
Anyone on PS4 needs one modded shoot me a message. I craft spammed them
---
I’ve literally never had any of these problems.
---
Interesting. I'd definitely like to see if that helps with your situation. If so I'll give it a try.
---
I'm looking other possible "solutions" that I've recently seen - though not holding out much hope. There's no reason for this much user side frustration, and certainly should not be such a monumental hurdle for even the most experienced users.
---
As with much of technology, especially these days, it's crazy to me when something that should mostly just work without much hassle, has such widespread problems and requires complicated troubleshooting - basically locking out casual users - and the companies just shrug.
---
That is what I am doing honestly. Survival isn't fun when you get one shotted by everyone because everyone has good tier weapons.
---
That's poor form.  
---
I'm sure I've done it while someone was entering the event and I didn't see them, but I always go out of my way to share.  That's what molotovs and explosive leg shots are for.
---
My buddy plays a bloodied unarmed build that can annihilate scorchbeasts in a couple hits, and he carries a dozen or so molotovs just to participate in group events.  They explode the instant they touch the ground, do low damage and continue to create a burn zone long enough to inflict damage on a bunch of Whitespring Golf Club ghouls out in the parking lot without poaching kills from everyone else.  When we do Free Range together, he's like "did you shoot the squatch?" I say yes, I'm shooting bugs now, and it dies immediately.  His DPS is unholy.
---
Currently, it has 0 value and cannot be sold to vendors.
---
[Fridge mod](https://i.imgur.com/zOEEVtn.jpg) only gives 30 carry capacity (so you only get half the capacity of a lvl 50 pack), and the ability does not stack with the Good with Salt perk.
---
I have my water purifiers unlocked and even give full access to my adhesive farm so even if you don't buy anything there should be something of benefit to you. The only thing I ask is please don't kill my Brahman and don't just watch her die. Since Player vending poor Bessie the Brahman seems to be dying hourly and my turrets aren't doing their job of protecting her... Sure she's clearly replaceable but with some repairs but still haha
---
My strategy. Hit the Limit, turn off PC/console, go to sleep, come back tomorrow. Plain and simple.
---
We are... they are like mummified gamers 😁
---
I would have a light leather chest piece because honestly the bullet belt looked nice on it.
---
Shit. I would be livid if this happened to me. I hope there’s a resolution for you to get your characters back.
---
I’m pretty sure all your character info is on their server and linked to your Bethesda account. I play on a couple diff PS4’s and my 2 characters have always shown up on there. 
---
As far as your lvl. 1 character goes, I think you have to actually leave the vault (or level up?) for it to save/checkpoint your progress. I did that too one time and it didn’t save my character. 
---
Hope that helps.
---
To stop being afk? I think you're fine.
---
Actually keeping the workshop is another story
---
Gotcha, I’ll make sure to grab those then. Thanks :)
---
Thanks for the advice!
---
.38 is a cheap, light, and easy to find ammo. With stealth vats crits it's more than useful for basic mobs. With the right weapon it'll do more damage than a basic handmade. Also, if they're kitting out a new character, most of their low level guns are probably 38.
---
I will ask again. What plane of reality do you live on?
---
https://imgur.com/a/JE09aFk
---
I'm on PC and getting the same issue (it doesn't show a "press \[button\] to tag".  Does anyone know what button i'm supposed to press?
---
I like the idea of robbing him better. Nothing like coming home to an empty garden.
---
I saw a mega sloth or deathclaw underneath this guys base it didn’t attack me but I immediately started attacking and killed it and then IMMEDIATELY I realized I might have made a huge mistake I think it was a peaceful tamed one :(
---
I'm on ps4 it's better than it was pre patch
---
25.001 caps payed in one turn. So close yet so far.
---
I like the way they did it. Trying to get that many atoms for all 4 at once would have been a pain.
---
It's not shitty game design, it's just something you don't like lol. If it were shitty game design there wouldn't be a market for mmos, yet millions of people play them.
---
I finally got it to work. I tried various things, but this is what did it: from the dock, I swam/ran directly out to the far right buoy, which is the problem buoy. I jumped over the sunken boat and landed on the buoy, ringing the bell. Then I jumped back exactly the way I came in, back toward the dock. Movement in any other direction would make it fail.
---
Do t workshops anything. If you need to learn where everything get a team mate or scout YouTube. If you’re on my team would welcome you. We farm, visit camps, tank Whitesprings and help people on PC. There are others like us. 
---
I’m nmprogue on PC. My friends will be on your team open mike to help.
---
Search this sub for the Mappalachia map with random encounter locations and just walk to a bunch of them. You'll get stuff eventually.
---
You have to find them to allow you to fix the cameras initially.
---
Time to level your alts.
---
I’ve seen this with my X-01 helmet about a week ago. Made a new one and haven’t had the issue since...though I haven’t checked my other PA sets in my stash.
---
Do we need to call an ambulance?
---
Ah that makes sense, bummer.
---
Everything is unlocked at my place. I even put a bed and banjo by the vendor machines so you can rejuvenate before you head out on your next adventure.
---
I thought they broke it initially. My second trip the door took almost a minute to load.
---
Nice camp love the view
---
I was hoping they would dupe some sun masks.
---
Mid level suggestion for rifle player, grab the plans for the lever action rifle (Grafton station) and/or handmade (Free States Vendor, Whitesprings) and grind out guns to scrap for mods. They are great weapons that rarely drop, but you can make a bunch to have a decent gun or tart up a legendary one if you’re lucky enough to find one
---
I would say keep this in mind, but don't let it dissuade you from accepting invites. Every time I've received a rsndom invite it was someone either wanting to see my vendor, or trying to get people for events. I've gotten invited to the encrypted event a few times, then we've always proceeded to just hop to all the events.
---
Yeah, the Lever gun and laser weapons are basically worthless without it. Even with it on they break insanely fast.
---
Well, anything in the forest should be fine. Ash heap and toxic valley are mostly ok but sometimes have lvl 30ish enemies (spawns of anglers can be tough). I’d generally avoid the savage divide and anything east until you get that power armor. 
---
Signal strength is a rough one too. I had to try it a couple times to avoid the periodic radscorpions etc.  Also many parts of the signal strength storyline will take you out of your depth, so you may want to hold off (I think nearly all of it will be tough for a level 17).
---
Someone wrote a mod that automatically answers the questions. Lol!
---
Yes, I would pay Atoms for a full respec.  I had a great shotgun build that got tossed after the latest update when the explosive damage was adjusted.  Now I am going melee, and I am lucky because my grind wont be as bad as some due to shotgun being a strength perk.
---
Yeah, pretty much all my guns see this intermittently.
---
Ah if only I wasn’t a console peasant
---
Excavator is my fav too
---
np
---
&gt; The game itself was stored on an external hard drive, maybe I could plug that into my PC and see if I could find the files?
---
On PC files such as saves and configurations are typically stored separately from the game itself, idk how consoles do it. But I'd say it's still worth taking a look at the external drive with a PC.
---
No, no and no! No ingame advantages from atoms. Strict no to pay to win.
---
Ppl might want it but I'm not sure its in the overall design of the fallout ip.
---
All of my replayability in prevous titles was alts so I'm not sure how keen beth is to change.
---
Having said that, sure, I'd pay atoms for it
---
I want more camp items that make you question was this built buy the devs and what is built by player
---
Sure kid 😂
---
More objects being added to large world areas is not a novel challenge for games.
---
Jokes aside, it's still something they should improve.
---
1 million upvotes yes.
---
Glad you asked this question. I was beginning to wonder if they were real. Lol.
---
Makes modest income and gets a big dick about it 😂
---
I think alot of ppl were too lazy to jump through the hoops to get the replacement.
---
Bethesda didn't magically know every person's shipping address
---
thank you!
---
Idk if it’s a “pay to win” situation when you can earn atoms in game without real money.
---
My ticket was updated about a week ago so I assume it's still in motion
---
I did send details and 2 other guys on my facebook list. They don't have the bag either
---
[](/awelestia)In the fallout universe American Culture kind of stagnated in the 50s, and technology evolved on a different path that made personal robots that can operate for hundreds of years unattended, but not color TV.
---
We were talking about nonlegendaries, and how annoying it is that they are lumped with legendaries in the vending snapshot on the map.  
---
If you want to buy a 50 level nonlegendary gun that I made, hit me up.  A bargain at 1k.
---
What did it said about the bag?
---
Being murdered none stop probably offsets the boost.
---
I'm guessing though as i wouldn't use survival for leveling
---
Fallout universe is not our universe per se.  This is what makes it special...
---
The game takes place in a world where the culture of the 50s, and the aesthetic of the 50s continued forever, and their ideas of the future (bulky robots, nuclear everything, lasers) came true.
---
It’s not pay to win in any way.
---
Is there a specific location for places selling Flux? I need some Crimson, but I am too much of a chicken to nuke a place right now.
---
You can play the game solo.
---
Yeah it's there but whenever I take te picture, it just doesn't work
---
Assaultrons are tricky at best. You need to be on your game.
---
One last bitch?
---
Did you get a confirmation its being shipped?
---
I'd keep sending emails till they did if i cared
---
I always send random invites when my core group isn't on because of the Herd mentality mutation. I build up my teammates base with the things they have yet to unlock. I give them tons of ammo that need and also finish what ever missions they have yet to complete. So saying everyone is out to get you and never except random invites is just paranoid and stupid. Get that stick out of your ass and take a chance on making new friends. I except random invites almost every day and not once has this happened. I've met 90% of my online friends from random encounters.
---
Nope
---
Your welcome
---
With or without lone wanderer can do that.
---
I haven't noticed any difference personally
---
as long as they're not attacking my camp I love to see any wildlife battle in Appalachia
---
Seriously I thought we all agreed that this is POOR FUCKING CONDUCT. Looking at you, literally 3/4 of players who run around in power armor with your gd super sledge at Uranium Fever. 🙄
---
Oh, you’re confused. I’ll explain.
---
Asking for more ethnic hairstyles is not “white standing”. It’s just asking for more ethnic hairstyles.
---
Furthermore, it doesn’t make the slightest difference what the player’s race is. I’m white/native, but one of my characters is black. I would like more ethnic hairstyles for my black character.
---
It may be difficult for you, but try not to be so easily triggered. The world isn’t going to conform to the accusatory questions of snowflakes like you.
---
If you're using class freak 3 they're pretty much all great except herd mentality and empath. They're only useful if you spend a lot of time in a team. With the Advent of player vending they're super affordable too.
---
It's very much pay to win if you don't have to play the game at all to gain benefits of lets say 50 levels when you want to change spec completely. They told "Only cosmetics" and have already thrown that fixing kit thingy at us. We don't want to go that road and support these money grab schemes they promised not to put in.
---
Not nessisarily stuck in the 50s but had a pseudo 50d renaissance in an alternate future.
---
I’m good. I’ll grind it like you had to. Thanks though.
---
 No problem?
---
Not at all.
---
Well you're not getting it then. 
---
Like i said, if i care about things i try harder, not give up.  But it's too late now
---
I need this too, psn lvlr_lee
---
I'm definitely coming! Need about 15min. Finishing up some stuff. I should be good though
---
Yep that be neat. Just yesterday i spawned in to buy some stuff and camp was under attack by super mutants. I killed them all and then repaired the camp walls, then bought some stuff.
---
At the very least i hope someone returns the favor if they should come to my camp and find themselves in similar situation.
---
They need the fast travel mat as well as a jail building set so I can trap hapless travelers and can roleplay as a warden.
---
My friend and I spent hours dying in water to get this done 😂
---
[](/cehappy)Is the legendary laser an ultracite laser? If so it has it's own mods that you have to learn separately.
---
Should’ve mentioned on PS4
---
Lmfao
---
+karma
---
Totally agree.
---
Found a TS Radium and figured I might as well grind out all the mods for it. Not only is it a huge investment to craft but all mods must be counted as rare because I only unlock one every two or so guns broken down. I've turned into a bit of a zombie looking for phones and fans to fuel my gun habit. If it weren't my favorite gun in FO4 I doubt I'd keep it up. Really underwhelming stats even with Primed receivers.
---
Speed demon is great.  Food and water aren't hard to keep stocked on, and movement speed + reload speed is a godsend.
---
Well it’s pretty clear that’s exactly what you do.
---
Legendary spawning works the same way as FO4. Im pretty sure every mob spawned has a chance to spawn as legendary (not robots in Watoga anymore) and basicly when youre on a server and people are out killing mobs and youre out as well more legendaries will occur. (Because alot of regular mobs are dying and respawns are ‘’forced’’)
---
But if you then jump servers and more people are afk/in their camp/jumping around vending and not killing stuff you might get unlucky and have to kill more regular mobs before a legendary occurs. 
---
Basicly only way to increase legendary spawn rates is to kill regular mobs and force spawns and a legendary will occur.
---
Thanks, will try at the same spot later with more camp budget then the only different other than base char (which im 99% sure isn't an issue you just need the card) is our platform, Xbox vs PC.
---
I was hopping at cranberry glade but will move to the vertibird.
---
at least you have vendors now..
---
It’s all good, my Appalachian brother, it’s all good.
---
There was nothing clear about the Situation at all.    Even the site dint work first time.   
---
I am going to see this week then going to Twitter about it.
---
It's meant to give that cold war era feeling.  You know when we all were threatening to nuke one another.
---
Uh, no not really. People in fallout new Vegas had dreadlocks. Dreadlocks, braids, been around for thousand of years. Also people were shaving crazy warhawks in the 1950s. There's no reason it can't be post apocolyptic.
---
campire event on map appear time to time hope this helps
---
100 caps
---
No this is worth 10k+
---
Nah, some good server lag though, of course I play with my friend in Europe often lately. ;)
---
they should make a serum that refunds 3 special pts
---
There’s none
---
I've got no problem with PVP and have no interest in playing adventure mode. My problem is the current implementation of the leaderboard which targets you in a way that is out of your control. Maybe you just don't understand that survival is more than just death match mode for a lot of people it's just one part of it. Maybe try being less obnoxious, you totally misunderstood what I was getting at.
---
Alright Ill send another message before we drop the nuke with 10 minute warning.
---
One of the reasons I returned, I left for a few months (not out of hate or anything) but all the things I've been seeing in this sub pulled me back in.
---
The jelly in Tanagra Town and Middle Mountain Cabins is the useful consumable kind. The jelly by the dead bicyclist north of vault 76 is the useless junk kind. I've checked all three locations within the last three days.
---
Are you saying Honey Beasts now drop the useful, consumable version of Royal Jelly? If so that's fucking awesome, and I'll have to cash in on that when I get home tonight.
---
I tend to see folks selling flux nearish to Watoga and white springs
---
Troubleshooter's legendary affix would be useful, or anti-armor. Not sure which would be better, but either would help.
---
Ok, yeah I didn't have issues with the pioneer photo challenges. Do you have trouble with other camera challenges besides the pioneer ones?
---
Well said. I’ve often wondered the reasoning. 
---
I liked it but never connected it like that. I think you nailed it.
---
I hope you can understand the hours of grinding it takes to get 8 possum badges
---
What's the name of the channel if I don't participate I would still like to watch

It’s not but okay.

Gotcha thanks. My character must be getting soft 😂

Sometime in the 1950s there was a scientific breakthrough when scientists found out the true capability of nuclear power. Using this technology they could make robots, fusion cars, the pip-boy that you use and many, many more tools. They continued living in the style of the 1950s upto 2077, when, due to the resource wars between Europe, Asia, and America, China Launched nuclear bombs at America, Causing them to fire back and etc. People of America escaped the nuclear Hellfire, only a small amount, by living in giant underground vaults that were secretly experiments run by vault tec, with a few exceptions e.g vault 76, that housed America's smartest, fittest and strongest people. After 25 years you emerge from the vault with your friends to take back America, and rebuild on what was left of the world.
---
I solo with melee. I’m not sure if it’s possible stealth without someone to help tank the robots. It sounds fun. Are you on PC?
---
Same, but I expected mole rats.
---
Ok you clearly are only here to make jokes bye
---
Xb1
---
It's like the first guy who licked a poison frog, we appreciate your sacrifice
---
Thank you
---
Just happened lol. Thats what made me think of it , although this wasnt a vendor. The camp just appeared while I was in an interior cell.
---
I'd definitely go with any troubleshooters weapons.  
---
If things get a little thickn standard t60 will work just fine. Also, running the silo solo is actually a lot easier than having a team, as there's not as many enemies.  
---
GLHF
---
I was absolutely expecting to be able to build interior walls.
---
Damn, I’d love to help you. It’ll be a slow roll and a highly skilled one but you can do it. Just need mad rad control at the beginning. Call it the second act.
---
Can I try it out? How much ya asking
---
This is one of my biggest pet peeves in the game
---
105
---
I actually judt took a glass blowing class. It would be manageable with enough time but the broken pieces actually make sense if we havent figured out how to get the mix of glass right and were using different compositions
---
No, that's the weird thing. It's normal.
---
Ok, well, looking at the options, would Aquaboy/girl be worth it? Not sure how much time you really spend in water in this yet.  
---
If not, I like Thru Hiker as a possible choice.
---
No it's definitely possible. I'm a solo sniper and I can breeze through silos either just sneaking past the robots if I don't really need to fight them or be 1 shotting everything but sentry bots and legendary assaultrons, which take 2.
---
Nope just the pioneer ones
---
I usually never take ppls bags unless they never come collect it
---
If that player already maxed out their vendor caps, then it’s all profit after that. Perhaps they’re able to make Rad-x very easily, so they’re able to sell for cheap. And if you buy it all just to flip it... great! They just got paid, and you made some money too. Win-win.
---
I do the same thing with stimpaks, radaway, disease cures, and serums. Makes me a ton of caps.
---
I did it alone and by some miracle succeeded. It took hours and I didn’t have the right Weapons. When I do it again I’ll take a VAMPIRE’S Sledge w/ Swing Speed. No question. You are going to be in close quarters with assaultrons. ‘Nough said.
---
High skill. It’s possible just harder than smashing through them. Lol
---
You have to turn in technical data one you find it, the more technical data you have the higher your chance to get it, i heard the paint is a pain to get but I got lucky however and got mine in the first try and only had one thing of technical data 😂
---
&gt; cant get to work so far: musical challenges as locations and play different instruments.
---
&gt; 
---
&gt; medic is obviously because stimpack diffuser not avalable and the frog habitat one doesnt seem to register.
---
These right here are holding me too.
---
If you use PA you don't really need bird bones, do you?
---
Yeah. Good. I was really upset for about 15 seconds. Haha
---
Naaah just wait for legendary players, no need to pay atoms
---
Not using PA.
---
Looks great!! Love the separate buildings! 😊
---
U are right. Had to of used an exploit.

About what level should you be? I’m 42? GT frankpharaoh77

[https://youtu.be/0Z33UHnEckk](https://youtu.be/0Z33UHnEckk)
---
Here's a video I took. It's especially bad when around player camps (turrets seem to skew the targets), around some world objects, and in the mainframe parts in the silos. Certain objects seem to implement a sort of auto-aim system, and that system grabs hold of your accuracy towards what it deems it the target. Heck, sometimes your accuracy targets something BEHIND the target you're shooting at and your bullets teleport through it to the other side.
---
In this video, I'm shooting bullets at an almost 30+ degree angle here. I have to over-compensate for the bug to aim... or just not use my weapon at all. Seems to impact auto-firing weapons more than single shot.
---
They can detect duped items.  They’ve stated there’s no unique ID for items, so the way they’ve tried to “determine” in the past who might have been duping is to search for people with a ridiculously high number of “rare” items and ban them.
---
The problem is, they reportedly tracked how many times those items were acquired (I.e., picked up) and some claimed they only had a fraction of the amount BGS said they did, and had just shuffled things between friends/accounts.
---
I’ll help anytime my GamerTag is BethesdaDaily hmu whenever
---
Have a mutants death claw 3* with reduced weight
---
Some aren’t free, so pay attention while clicking.
---
What system are you on, and what's the price?
---
Yes this. Go to Sparse Sundew Grove there are like 8-9 there.
---
Thanks! I wanted it to look like a little town that several people lived in! :)
---
There's a lvl 50 TSE Handmade in my Camp Vendor for 5000c
---
Many people have had random crap dupe accidentally through normal gameplay/buggyness, btw
---
We are halfway done.. just wait on the nuke drop. Bring a lot of stimpaks, radaway and power armor. Focus on the adds, not the Queen.
---
You'll be ok, I'm a stealth sniper build and I can run them super fast. Make sure to take radiation suit incase, look for maybe a pipe bolt, hunting rifle with Troubleshooters, anti armor or instigating. With a LVL 50 instigating hunting rifle, .50 reciever and armor piercing mag. You should be downing most of the enemies in there 1 shot. And it's not that expensive of an item. I was selling 1 the other day for like 1k in my vendor machine, and to be honest I was overpricing because it was my vendor machine.
---
Just make sure to have a backup faster fire weapon for when enemies swarm
---
Took me 2 server hops. Took 2 friends server hops. Another just fast traveled there. Another took 1 hop. All of us found it at the cemetery up north, just left of where you spawn. Took no one more than 10 minutes when they chose that spot.
---
Ohh I gotcha. I'm only level 26 haha
---
So I found them and went to attack them back, had pacifist mode turned off and their meter didnt go down at all, not even after two full clips of tse rounds went into them.
---
Wanna say whitespring, but could be way off. Don't remember clearly ☹️
---
As a great tattoo fan I would say that looks very nice 👍
---
[](/celestiafrown)That's odd, a quick search I found said that perhaps some mods can only be applied to rifles, and others can only be applied to pistols? So is your legendary laser configured as a one, and your normal one the other?  
---
If so maybe switching from a stock to a pistol grip/pistol grip to a stock is the answer.
---
More crying about pvp is all i get from your entire post , as for being obnoxious that just proves my point
---
You can't trade backpacks
---
Hacker or exploiter im guessing. Could be wrong. Report them maybe
---
I want all the DLC build items including institute glass railings. I really miss institute decor and glass decor items.  Built many a three story house with floor to ceiling glass walls for the epic view.
---
Report all the bots/glitcher vendors you find. Avoid buying or using obvious duplicated items... I know it's tempting but you're just promoting this behavior if you do so! If you really end up buying legendaries because they are much cheaper now, at least use them to get scrip.  Other than that, we can't do much... Only Bethesda can punish the exploiters and add new features to counter the damage once they manage to fix the new duplication glitch.
---
I kill anyone with a workshop I usually don’t check their lvl cause they’re gettin fried anyway lol
---
I did
---
Nothing it just said the ticket was updated so I assume it's still in the works
---
Right?!
---
Maybe 76 wasn't a control Vault after all. Could be an experiment to see how genetic abominations handle life in the wasteland with the Enclave created Scorchbeasts ensuring that only the 76 genetic freaks occupy Appalachia. What do genetic weirdos do when unleashed on the wasteland? Start looting everything and nuking the crap out of everything to loot some more. Of all the Vault experiments this is probably the one most interesting to Vault Tec or the one they regret the most.
---
Stay away from workshops, turn on pacifist mode, and never be griefed again.
---
That might be a bit reaching due to the institute not being more then an idea.  But yeah
---
There’s a holotape on the body in the floor as soon as you load in.
---
That really sucks u lost ur junk.  I hate cheaters do much
---
Not if you're **already in a power armor**!
---
Did I blow your mind?!
---
what a totally normal, not racist thing to say.

So you gave away a legendary and he/she sold it?
---
Found one
---
Lol, I'm totally going to steal that line in the future
---
Legendary players? Is this a real thing, or no?
---
Did you own a workshop? Were you at that workshop?
---
Yeah I've ran into it twice, bunch of dead Super Mutants with the mysterious quills and a level one injured Mutant. Felt really bad for the guy, just left him along after looting his buddies.
---
Silo cleared... waiting about 5-7 before launch.
---
Can you get the tin foil clothes for cheap now? Or is that a atomic shop only thing?
---
I purchased weapons from an unpowered camp today at WS the player was not on my team
---
I would have assumed that both the Brotherhood and Enclave would have pretty hard stances against mutants.  If remnants of their groups return to Appalachia, they should be a bit derisive or aggressive towards players.
---
They have done it a patch thats 5 steps forward but 10 steps back thanks for breaking the game again Bethesda.
---
Last night I made an Excavator PA for the Miner Miracles quest, I  had just made the helmet, legs &amp; arms when the server disconnected :( loaded back in and carried on but when I went to craft the chest piece the only thing on the PAC was the helmet. Even more annoying it had still used up the junk so I had to go gather more junk before I could craft it all again. Huge waste of 40 screws 😩
---
I purchased weapons from an unpowered camp today at WS the player was not on my team ps4

What weapons are you using, what armor?

Enforcer doesn't proc for you?  I don't know how reliable it is, I'm not a shotgun build.

Also sorry I’ve been drinking lol

yeah got class free r3 and the gen one r2 (makes it so you dont loose the mutations on chem and other reducer)

FYI it's a manhole cover took me awhile to figure this out lol
---
Never been a tattoo person but reading this and looking at your art really has me reconsidering. I'm personally drawn to the Silent Hill games.
---
I believe Borderlands 2 had a trading system where each player had to confirm the trade before it went through. That would make this problem go away pretty quickly.
---
Think whatever you want you clearly don't understand what I'm talking about if you think it's just crying about pvp.
---
Quest reward for making it to general
---
It is different spot, the guest will spawn on the spot you put the C.A.M.P. down in the first time, and the owner only spawn on the edge of their camp, I think it's because game won't load the data of other players camp(only buildings), following the device seems quite legit and safe option in general, I think it just this quite doable option to made the vending machine work, since they don't want to add the travel mats back, they should actually use the same item but let the system put it I think, game will load that point just like workshops and allowing others spawn in the same location with owners, I think it will be fixed quite soon actually
---
TSE
---
Thank you! 😊
---
found what? a minority? congrats blue's clues you fuckin did it
---
I'd use it for player vending and inventory management. As long as I can log into my main character hell yeah.
---
Sweet, thank you!
---
I know there was something they put into place to stop the dupers where you can't have more than one of a particular legendary weapon. If you picked up another legendary 10mm it could have taken the place of the one you had.
---
Dude i get where your going. But i cant figure out if this is a troll post. This game has a lot of hurdles to jump in terms of fixing code and smoothing out bugs before they could even think about how to get it on phones
---
This is correct.
---
SBQ time letssss goooo
---
Good luck with that. I'm closing in 1000h and still no sight any protective.
---
LAUNCHED!
---
hmu, Sweet Clod

Ok wtf, you can’t complain about cheating if you don’t understand the game mechanics, pvp is allowed guys there’s nothing against it, you must’ve done something to damage him or you must’ve had a bounty from picking a lock on a camp or supply crate etc, he’s then come up and killed you because let’s face it it’s not that hard to have good weapons that 1 tap, I’ve got a arsenal large enough that every single weapon be it Bloodied, vampire’s or AA kills in under a second, I also have 15 characters all with amazing armour sets and they’d be the reason you weren’t doing damage, +dodgy + serendipity if he was a low health build and you basically land maybe 1 in every 30 shots. I’d also like to point out tse is trash and if he wasn’t  red you can’t do anything since slap damage doesn’t exist anymore, so regardless of how many shots you shoot unless he fires back you will never do any damage, even if he did fire back if he runs say Sentinal assassin or Uny Sent and serendipity your not going to do anything since your shots will always end up being negated somehow, I’m assuming he also had a good weapon let’s say a B FFR or BE gun if he’s low health, he’d kill you well before you could do anything, next time you want to come complain about something understand a bit more k :)         As I stated earlier the first engagement you must’ve done something to be red to him, be that picking a lock and getting a bounty, destroying workshop structures, shooting him accidentally with your trashy no accuracy tse and he’s killed you, since forgive me for making this assumption your not a PvP player and therefore don’t have a PvP build or any build for that matter
---
Why napkins when rolls of TP are everywhere?
---
Oh okay well good to know man!
---
LAUNCHED
---
The radium rifle always had a niche role, which was dramatically improved as a specialty and PvP option in 76 vs Fo4.  I never saw the need to swap from my Two-shot lever gun to a radium rifle in Fo4, even on survival mode.  The old guy's gun was better in every way.
---
Radium Rifles do really well in PvP, as it requires the opposing player to suck down both stims and radaway simultaneously, which is difficult for anyone that's not prepared for the one-two punch.  I have limited experience with PvP in 76, but I used to stash a TS/+50 limb damage radium rifle for camp griefers that never failed to catch them off guard with an automatic receiver.  One VATS headshot burst and they were usually done.
---
In PvE, it's very situational.  Very good for the SBQ fight.  Never, never bring it to a Whitespring nuke, or really anywhere that's not exclusively populated by scorched creatures.  I thought my legendary version would be good enough to override the radiation healing ghouls, and I was so wrong.  I was in a team with two good pals and some random guy we came across (now a hilarious member of our discord group) and everyone was like "the ghouls are regenerating health!"  I ashamedly said "sorry, that's my radium rifle and I've now achieved personal growth through utter failure."  I wound up "helping" during the rest of the Whitespring Nuke by hopping into my power armor with a nocturnal tire iron that I was completely unperked for.
---
I had my while base done, wanted to remove one couch, missed, removed the foundation by accident, then i couldn't replace it or remove the foundation right next to it.
---
I wrote a paragraph and it got deleted because I used w t f ok then, well I hope you can read it anyway
---
Haven't figured out armor yet but probably an Instigating Combat Knife.
---
Starched genes. It's 5 perk points, but they're awfully good.
---
Yes I was... Fml. That still doesnt explain how the person took literally no damage when I attacked them back (after searching for them). Or is there a logical explanation for that as well?  I mean Im a lvl132 had a tse handmade and emptied two full 35 round clips into the guy at point blank range and their health bar didnt move at all
---
Wait you got the frog habitat to work.
---
I got 2 Extractors, 3 water purifers, adhesive farm and everything else you need in and around my base. Come on in and get yourself set up. The shop is just there for me to offload some junk and useless plans and other items, my home is free use.
---
Coming soon to a Fallout 76 near you
---
No you dont get a notification
---
Don’t accuse someone of cheating if you don’t understand that what their doing And using is available in game, such as sent assassin armour that reduces the damage you take to on average less then 30%
---
Why do you have to make it about your “minority”? Seems kinda racist. Please be more considerate next time.
---
if you're on PC name a price man. 
---
i love my gaty but i always wanted a TSE version
---
There are fewer gotchas now. The vendor caps are much less confusing. Almost all of the useful plans are available at vendors rather than having to farm spawns. As long as you have a half-decent plan for perks then you can't do much damage.
---
Most people run into problems with the main quests in the Savage Divide due to the enemy auto-levelling. If you don't fancy randomly running into max-level monsters then check out quests and events in the Toxic Valley and Ash Heap first.
---
The only rare material that nuke zones provide is flux, which you won't need until you have plans that use it. I wouldn't bother starting to collect it until you have some more levels and a half-decent set of PA.
---
I will be on tomorrow.  Found a good spot to do this one.  What's your gt?
---
Being able to build and or place a bunker would be tons of fun
---
Wtf is your problem?  Dont make assumptions about shit you dont understand.  I stated clearly I had pacifist mode on, so no damage could be dealt to anyone.  Whatever I dont have time for idiots like you
---
what??
---
They probably did join you, but I wouldn't think much of it. I almost always "join" someone, even if I plan on playing solo, just so I can hopefully get back to the same server if I disconnect.
---
Yes please! I'm always spawning inside foundations.
---
I do this to anyone who's prices are unreasonable...I'd take the hint ;)
---
Whenever i fast travel to a camp vendor things seem to explode for some reason so i feel obliged to go around and fix their generators and water purifiers etc etc.
---
To answer your question, no, I do not believe there is a notification
---
Additionally, if you shoot monsters in the head, it tends to stagger them anyway.
---
Well maybe not 76 but with Steam Link App for iOS or Android you could play the previous Fallout games on your mobile devices. I don’t think it works when you are not on the same network as your Steam PC, but it’s a start
---
Read the post kid, you don’t understand anything about the game, don’t come to reddit complaining when you get killed because your not a pvp player. You and your little buddy are accusing this player of cheating and hacking, that’s a pretty serious allegation when what he was doing is perfectly normal, if you were a pvp player you’d realise that as basically any decent pvper has the same armour or similar armour sets
---
If u read what i said earlier then u wouldn't of wasted ur time.  I said i could be wrong, someone was asking a question. No one else was helping.
---
That gun is super rare so if you do sell go high 15k+ plus if the gun is killing you with its splash damage equip fire proof perk in endurance may be get the healing factor mutation it will heal you once your out of combat. Now if your looking to replace it look for a vampires explosive gatling,50 cal, minigun
---
Again dont have time for idiots buhbye
---
Don’t accuse people of cheating or hacking if you don’t understand the ins and outs
---
I will try that tomorrow, thanks!
---
Of course it's full. Why wouldn't it be?! 🤦🏻‍♂️just hoping someone DC's. 😂🤣
---
As cool as that gun is I gave my TSE to a friend as it just was not a gun I used. The more I play the more I find having all guns doesn’t really help, it’s having the guns that suit certain situations or play styles.
---
Regardless though, the TSE Gatling is a ton of fun, and certainly is helpful in bringing down SBQ
---
Your useless mate, you clearly don’t understand anything, accusing someone of hacking is pretty damn serious and your doing it without understanding anything
---
Yes. The two high level characters were gone. Upon start I was automatically started as lvl 1 in the vault, as if I had never played the game. That’s when I backed out and checked to see what happened to my two high levels. Both gone. Like they never happened.
---
Ok I don’t mind even if they did I was just curious!
---
Thanks!
---
I explained to you what would’ve happened and I would’ve been a not nicer about it had you not accused the poor person of hacking and cheating
---
I didnt once say he was. I said "maybe". I never once said "yup hes cheating".
---
I'll rock the braids
---
Is there a list out there of what each item takes up for space in you limit because I get tired of trying to place an item down and getting a maximum limit reached. It happened to me with the fertilizer producer and I scrapped a few things and never could put it down.
---
Yeah, it's an old bug. You have to learn a revolver prime plan to make prime ammo for the combat rifle.
---
Maybe try deleting your Fallout 76 save file? Keep in mind to backup your pictures and/or settings as these will be deleted.   
---
I always load into worlds where my camp location is occupied. Being located at Whitesprings you'd imagine that's a lot, and I've never ran into this issue.

Adventure mode now caters exclusively to non pvp players because of the crybabies,  now they want to be catered to in survival mode as well .you want to be in first place and still be invisible on the map , you want to be left alone so you can take advantage of the xp boost .the change to the leader boards were made because of the crying now you dont like it and are crying to be invisible at all times . I get it
---
I have 1 of my 3 purifiers unlocked for anyone to use, keep my house unlocked to use benches etc and have plenty of crops for people to harvest.  However, I do keep my junk extractor locked while I'm in the middle of a crafting and modding spree for all these damn badges.  When that's complete, I will unlock that too.
---
I found some yesterday at Gulper's Lagoon
---
Jeez... you want it all.Leave me alone on PvP server waaaaa. You know the rules so live by them. You are either a squeeker or liberal
---
fo76 needs more raider gameplay so yes, 55% damage buff seems fair
---
Well I appreciate the constructive feedback, thank you
---
I wish the Mirelurk Queen would have an animation when it fires acid at you. Right now Mirelurk Queens don't animate much other than walking around.
---
Probably has to do with the CAMP system being brought over from 4, but it was implemented in 4 very late in the game’s development, they weren’t sure whether they wanted it or not. And then they expanded it a bit in each DLC. So it was always kinda buggy.
---
Then add in the smaller build areas/capacity and the troubles making things work multiplayer, plus cosmetic items and a desire to jam even more into it and you get what we have now.
---
Please read the conditions I’ve outlined for reproducibility. There are a string of things that has to happen all while you’re located at one location
---
OMG no I have no intention for this. I'm a good hearted person who wants to help the community out and I see this game having potential. I had to look up the term trolling to understand it thoroughly.
---
Im trying to grief or start something where it upsets others. I'm trying to make a point that the game could expand even more and allow others to enjoy it fully.
---
I feel if you already own the game then it's free on your phone but requires a connection to your account. The game would use up a good portion of space but you can install it on phones easily due to the large sizes. My phone literally has 128gb which I won't use fully. I just put my SD card in it from my other phone.
---
Please don't think of the post as a negative one.
---
Done
---
I like your idea, great alternative! 
---
Unfortunately not sure how that would help me. I seem to spawn in 3 different locations anytime i go to my camp. 
---
Rebuilding my camp alone seems like a nightmare, I'd also have to keep 3 spawn points in mind while doing it. Makes me want to cry lol
---
[](/ce02)I hope it works, if it doesn't then I'm out of ideas.
---
Yea my bad my beef here is with the OP reporting him when the OP doesn’t understand fully what the player couldve been doing, I’m a pvp player with over 15 pvp builds, I’m essentially impossible to kill for any pve player thanks to my armour and perks but I’m just like everyone else in PvP, I don’t go arround reporting anyone who kills me because I understand there’s ways to make it seem as if no damage is being dealt, not only that their are ways to engage in pvp with players who don’t want to, it’s called if they have electricity charged or unstable isotope. So unless you can provide concrete evidence and know that what they were doing isn’t possible through normal means such as perks, armour, weapons etc. if someone was flying for example you’d have to check several things, 1 there’s no jet pack (I’ve had a friend jump in P.A and it not look like he’s in any P.A he’s just hovering and when he Jetpacks it’s flames out of his feet so this isn’t the best example since I know bugs like that happen (I have photo proof)) 2. They haven’t just jumped, 3. Their not standing on a branch or thin metal beam etc you can’t just go hey I got killed time to report :)
---
I mean the current gen phones have the capability to do alot. I heard of old games being played on phones. Heck they even had some powerful games on it.
---
Level 62 charred ghouls have 300 HP and 85 DR. Feed that through the DR calc and you get 356 damage required for a one-shot.
---
I agree, i feel raider gameplay is so minimal in this game, which is kind of said seeing how its a fallout game.
---
One work around that sometimes works for me is dripping out of build mode entirely and going back into it without moving, works more fun French than it doesn’t
---
I bet she had a thing for wooden armour
---
Or give it to a friend, make him put it in a world container log of re join the same server. Then it will count. ( I have not tested this for months).
---
hmmm,  I had renamed this particular chassis, but I haven't had any trouble with other sets that I've renamed.  Only this one that I've crafted within the last couple of weeks.
---
The best course would probably be to put the spawn point somewhere outside the camp's build-zone, or at the very edge. As long as they check if you're on solid ground before spawning you, anyway.
---
Charleston Station, I believe. I saw it once, but there were only two outfits, so somebody else must have already got to it before me.

FWIW, I wasn't able to complete the first part of the Swimming Badge in the lake. Every time I got near the furthest buoy, I would automatically fail. Didn't seem to matter if I was actually swimming or wading. ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯
---
Ugg okay thanks feeling really silly, its probably the only one I didn’t try because I thought that was too obvious :P
---
Have not seen this.  Sounds pretty cool!
---
Thank you that was too obvious....:)
---
This is a great alternative. Id really like to see them implement something like this. Getting really tired of fast traveling to someones camp and getting stuck in their walls or floors
---
Thank you , feeling silly
---
This would help so much. Especially when we want to do something in the game away from home.
---
Were all the effects the same on the handmade or was there a difference? I've found identical * garbage weapons at white springs, but never an exact *** duplicate ever. BSG needs to fingerprint all ** &amp; *** legendaries then start deleting ALL dupes and only ban the real dupers/sellers with more than 2 instances to avoid banning players exchanging duped weapons. You'll lose the weapons, but won't be perma-banned.
---
Good advice on perk card.  Never thought of that.
---
As much as I'm addicted to this game...I might rage quit if her gear doesn't scale to player level.
---
Thanks so much, so its based on AP not the fusion core then. Good to know!
---
Thanks so much!
---
Hell screw a Marco use some tap, use something to press down the keyboard butting to run backwards and to the left or right so you do tight circles or if your Xbox or ps4 just take the analog stick backwards or in any direction, so long as your touching a key etc you won’t go offline, even if that’s running into a wall
---
Part of the issue with that would likely be that 4s shack walls were shorter than the barn, etc, walls, and thus would need to be stretched out. With you 100 percent though, given how at the moment the best you can do is wood which is just kinda ugly and boring.
---
Noone stops the mad shitter!
---
Stupid pioneer scouts dont even have tarp liners for their tents. Water just rolls in the hilly cracks to say howdy.
---
Yeah i like it.. just dreading having to rebuild my camp.
---
i proved myself wrong made about 50 of em and scaped them no beam spliter yet tho
---
👍👍
---
You will
---
I can throw a beam splitter on for u if u want tho
---
There are limb damage and stagger perks for everything, hell even vatsing something in the head has a chance to stagger and cripple
---
Oh yeah that could work
---
How they gonna ban you for running into a wall
---
I have the plan apparently what I here that you can lend someone the plan and they'll learn it.
---
I hear you. Especially since this last update made building all wonky. I tore a chunk of roof off my camp to do some changes, and couldnt attach anything. I couldnt even rebuild it the way i had it. Now i have a huge gaping hole in my house. Lol. Its driving me nuts
---
That's why you carry molotovs...everyone needs a tag
---
The scrap mod difficulty is probably an error, as it uses the armor learning difficulties rather than the weapon ones.
---
According to the ESM, scorchbeasts are immune to radiation, although I can't be sure whether it's coded correctly.
---
This is happening with serums too. I’ve seen loads priced at 200-250 and vendors buy them for 420. Nice little profit :)
---
In wv every home starts as a trailer, then it starts leaning when you add to it. Thats just trailer pregnancy to make new trailers.
---
I think you are confused with deathclaw gauntlet. And it has an extra claw mod
---
I’m not confusing it, it has an extra claw mod too
---
Just a quick note, as far as I remember most "good" legendary effects use the first and second legendary slots, and not the last slot. You'd be better off buying two stars which are half the price of three stars.
---
they'll still probably be pipe pistols tho
---
I hope they have, this reddits full of care bears
---
Check vendors...they carry alot of the mods now.
---
Yeah that is odd. I basically walked around in the water for most of it. Got suplexed by the Mirelurk Queen since i was running a PA HW build and was in nothing but a swimsuit. Other then failing the quest because of that, i didnt run into any problems. 
---
Have you tried it again recently?
---
Yep. It happened to me on the 14th.
---
Maybe duped or maybe we are reaching the time where people are legitimately getting enough tokens
---
Yes. It happened to me a few days ago. I have no idea what happened. But I had to list everything again.
---
nah man my gun is my best one dont wanna risk it in anyway im not saying anything bad about you just saying i have a trust issue
---
I just got my whole ass beat twice in there and wasted 2000 ammo. It was painful.
---
I ran into a protectron just today called Mr. Robberbot. He was up north by the water park. Definitely got a chuckle out of it.
---
True, I'm a bit of a dumbass for not even thinking of that. Lmao
---
I consider it polite thank you and consolation to anyone that spends caps to my camp, and may end up not finding something they want.
---
I saw a 3* level 1 leather chest piece for 12k today. I fast traveled to him, gave him a thumbs down, then left the server. Ridiculous.
---
Cheers.
---
You should have dropped some loot to get the rest of the dialogue
---
Thank you for your research
---
Yes i hit this defect the other day. I was trying to think of ways to work around it. I was going to try placing half walls on top of my walls, then attach the roof on top of the half wall. Higher ceilings would be nice anyway!
---
If I’m going to get a junkie’s pipe pistol with faster movement when aiming it better have a third star, dammit. 
---
(You’re right of course I plan on doing that but I’ll probably take a chance on one three star)
---
Idk how they did it. But i went to someones base by whitespring the other day, and they had their whole base built under the map. I took a tour and it was kind of astounding. The only thing above ground was a 2×1 building, but underneath it was quite expansive.
---
Can't you get a bunch of low level ones and scrap them to get mods? Or does that not work for the meat hook?
---
This actually helped me because I was looking for level 0 codes.
---
What? You're talking crazy words!
---
It does indeed
---
Dude I love this
---
Are you sure it's not 10% per addiction? That's what the ESM has in it. Caps at 50% for 5+ addictions.
---
I've heard that you can glitch underground bunkers in survival mode.
---
Hey man, I would be interested in teaming up. I'm nearly level 99 and my in game name is MrChesterson.
---
This guys saying he’s done with this sub, but he’s still here replying to everyone...
---
Same! My crops are so hard to place
---
The water has to be shallow, and you both have to be in it. Better off using lower level mobs, so you have more time to revive.
---
Here you are on your high horse still thinking you're better go on buddy, keep trying to pet your ego. You didn't deny to not having friends which obviously means you don't because of the way you act, I hope you're having a fun time being so lonely.
---
I’d like to see old cars, trucks and motorcycles that we could just use to decorate
---
Thats insane. Almost makes me want to jump into a survival server just to try it out. Do you think Bethesda would get mad if people did this?
---
Sold one for 2k in vendor
---
What platform are you on.
---
Another brilliant comment that's exactly the same as 20 others pretending responding to this post is the same as joining a sub.
---
Nice to finally play with you. Sorry you had to hear us bicker like the old married couple we are.
---
It's true! Some really inspired builders out there on the wasteland! Nice to do a little tour and see what ppl have built....always a shame when the doors are locked tho....
---
Oh no. There will always be more. Just not here.
---
Real quick at it also
---
I just don't place crops. Carnivore all the way, and just go to farms if you need cooking materials.
---
In the Enclave event there, there’s a satellite dish on the roof to calibrate, but otherwise yeah, nothing much there
---
If you are on xbox, I can come give your camp a makeover.
---
It's not a common drop and I dont think it works if you do scrap them.
---
except it is set to ASCII alphabetical order as a default- whether "hardcoded" or not

Has anyone seen the Mrs. Handy called Rachel because I was doing a enclave event and I found this Mrs. Handy called Rachel no paint just silver. And I needed a recon scope to help her study animals it was odd and I didn't have one so she went looking for someone who did.
---
My drive thru needs a trailer rest stop, nukashake machine, cabin office, shake shack parking overhang, train hobo aesthetics, construction equipment for unfinished buildings, placeable cars, inflatable mascots, audio jingle machines, nuka diner set, anything to do with dumptrucks, carnival equipment, sex dungeon, rails, above ground pool, hangers and airplanes, treehouse, farming set pieces, saloon doors, anything from a zoo, candy machines, and a cola with an extra cheese pizza to go.
---
I just started playing again on xbox after a few months away I can definitely say its changes my sleep schedule too haha.  theres so much more to do and figure out also changing my build (specials) so thats kind of a pain but ohwell
---
Good for you- i am willing to bet the vast majority of people do, or at least have a number of them at any given time- having a reverse sort order option would satisfy your desires without screwing everyone else yeah?

[](/angrytia)By my math in game, and the math in [this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/bclykn/yabs_junkie_guide_or_how_i_learned_to_stop/) it comes out to a 50% damage boost with 5 addictions.  
---

---
That's a 150.43478260869566% damage increase!
---
Nice work.
---
Made a couple tweaks I think would be more fun for me. Your original build looks fine for leveling but I changed things thinking about late game.

---
While sneaking, carry Nuka Darks and Bufftats. +7 Str &amp; End along with the sneak bonus, Instigating bonus, maybe a VATs crit. 
---
When the Booze and chems wear off you'll drop a chunk of health so the DR% from Nerd Rage and Lone Wander gives you a sec longer to react after. 
---
No Healing Factor but Field Surgeon and Cola Nut w/ Cherrys and Quantum's. Heals fast, restore AP for Dodgy, and doesn't lower chem effects
---
Once you have decent armor it should be enough to keep you alive. Dodgy, Serendipity, Mysterious Stranger, Lone Wanderer and maybe a piece of Life Saving armor will keep you alive ime. 
---
Dropped Makeshift Warrior and Travel Agent. I usually have too much junk no matter how many repairs I need to make and carrying multiple weapons isn't too bad with Martial Artist lowering weight. I only swap to TA if I know I'm going really far. Generally I would just spend the extra Caps and keep more useful perk than go swap cards.
---
Yeah I've been playing since beta and have maybe 4 or 5 of each bobblehead. Something doesnt seem right lol
---
Personally I believe working around the handicaps and finding what works helps fuel my creativity. I don’t mind the arduous building, even coming from FO4, as I find it therapeutic. Might be frustrating for others of course, but it doesn’t stop me from making a nice camp. 
---
I am all for structural soundness.
---
PS4
---
LOL ya think??
---
Report them
---
Handmade is life
---
Geez. And I thought I saw some crazy duping when I saw 50 perception Bobbleheads in one machine.
---
Submit a ticket to Bethesda with these pictures. 
---
I have a strong feeling that this person is a duper/ exploiter.
---
Also at this point in time, Richard Grey is mutating into the horrifying creature you see in Fallout 1
---
yes there is currently a dupe method on xbox not sure bout other platforms thats involves a few players and a certain place to do it.
---
but they can mass dupe stuff really fast so now the markets flooded with 2se gatling lasers and gatling plasma's, old man masks alot of rare and legacy stuff.
---
will never buy or take a Explosive Laser/Plasma Weapon as they all will be duped shit.
---
AP drains your fusion core too so yes the jet pack will drain your cores out quick unless you have some perks to help.  But flight time itself is based on the AP meter.
---
This drives me crazy. I've found all map locations but those challenges are broken. I've killed dozens of scorchbeast queens and that challenge wont tick off. I really wish theyd fix these. They have time to create dozens of take a picture challenges, how can it be so hard to fix the ones broken since the games launch.
---
Plasma Grenade and Ultracite Gatling Laser :(
---
Crap on xbox. Sorry :(
---
It’s ok
---
Porque no los dos
---
No need to steal it's all yours for 3 caps
---
Each special maxes out at 15, but you can’t get them all up to 15. You get 49 special points to distribute among all the special stats. Also, when you level up, you get to upgrade one special stat and pick a perk card, but you can upgrade let’s say, strength, and pick an agility perk card if you want. Some people don’t know that. Also, I recommend planning your character out on the nukes and dragons website. I usually suggest a strength melee and power armor build for new players also.
---
My friends did the math, i just gave them the numbers to crunch. Lol it very well could be.
---
No. These are basic game mechanics malfunctioning. It’s not about wanting it easy. It’s about wanting it to work.
---
I actually managed to get one in my inventory on complete accident
---
I was only able to get 300 scrip. I dont farm legendarys lol
---
Is it over
---
hit 1k yesterday
---
I hit it a couple days ago, maxed out on Monday
---
What's your gamertag, I have a hard time designing a cool base so mine looks blah too.
---
Nope, havent even hit 100
---
Yeah I understand where you’re coming from, and I hope that fixes are in the way. Just sayin’ I think that these handicaps fuel my creativity when it comes to putting together a camp. I’m not easily bothered (:
---
Perfect, thanks. That helps a lot. I’ve been trying to figure out exactly how the attributes system works, but nothing quite spelled it out like you did.
---
Yup... sry.
---
Rule of thumb, doors always open in a clockwise direction. It shouldn't matter which way the doorway wall is oriented.
---
Now they need to make the brick interior walls so that both sides are white. That would be sweet.
---
Assassins sentinel/cavalier. Functionally makes griefers immortal, even with a recent nerf. 
---
How do you not know about this at level 132?
---
God me too
---
Every time I build something I'm happy with I visit someone else's camp, get inspired, and rebuild in some horrible endless cycle lmao
---
I've only run into one other person stupid enough to put a camp where mine is. Mainly because every time someone fast travels to your camp, the enemies that spawn are (1) legendary Behemoth who proceeds to tear your camp a new asshole. I named him Dave. There's a beware of Dave sign next to his pond if you're at my camp. His interests include: smashing my razorgrain with his fire hydrant club.
---
Player Vendors sell tons super cheap. But there are some you can only get at whitesprings. Just scrap, sell, buy.
---
AA suppressing pipe weapons are pretty fun, especially on full auto. Not everybody is into the meta builds. Are you on PS4 op? That was probably me if so 😁
---
Dave sounds great to me- you on Xbox? I’d love to come visit lol 
---
Also never have a problem with anyone ever being in my spot out in BFE in the mire &lt;3
---
I gotchu bro, GT Firefight789
---
You’re a better and probably a happier camper than me. :) I love the building aspect. I get a vision in my head, damnit, I want to bring it to fruition. Lol
---
I must be the only one who runs their character with no mutations.
---
You don't get anything expect what you are making up in your head. That isn't what I'm thinking at all.
---
I think at some point, yes.. they will fix them..
---
he kinda quirky doe  😳   😳
---
Do you have to have the game for Xbox in order to get them? I have 76 for PC but would love these :O
---
I love seeing the bases and getting ideas and now I wanna unlock all the plans coz I realize I don’t have hardly any of those cosmetics that are so cool
---
Thanks for doing the proper math. Like i said earlier, i just fed my friends the numbers, and they crunched them. I still feel like it could use a small buff though. In comparison to some of the other builds ive faced in pvp, i feel like im throwing stones. LOL.  Granted some of the builds need a slight nerf, id still like to see some love thrown our way. Maybe raise the cap to 7 withdrawals.
---
This is why I have five characters haha. CAMP mules :)
---
Can check player machines if you can be arsed
---
Otherwise vendy bots best bet
---
This is a good argument for having modded servers.
---
From an immersion perspective clean build sets, such as the pre-war ones, are a bit dubious. Bethesda have an established look to the franchise in Fallout 3 and Fallout 4 which establishes even 200 years after the war things are still a mess. Why do a handful of vault dwellers manage to create clean looking stuff when Diamond City, a settlement that has been established for far longer, still looks like a mess? Heck, some of the stuff in the Atom store is probably already lore-breaking.
---
Some people care about lore a lot. Others not so much. Solution: let people customize their experiences via mods.
---
Pretty sure they allowed said method to exist to help fix the economy. And if you haven't noticed prices have tanked and people have been spending like crazy..
---
Say what you wish! But now is the time to do whatever you can to obtain your dream gear
---
Nice contribution.
---
That sounds so good
---
Yeah. The questions that you aren’t able to look up online are just common sense. Lol
---
Thanks for the feedback! 
---
Farming for myself - do you have any recommended soups or teas?
---
And I'll look into that backpack. It's been on my radar, but now that you say it, a bit more carry weight would really smooth out my looting.
---
Well, I don't exactly need to talk myself up. You're the one who feels he needs to prove something. Think what you want. In the end, you're furious because someone called you on not knowing what a simple term means ;)
---
I don't know, my Fusion Generator construction class didn't really go into brick laying all that much.
---
I've seen them listed from 800-2k.
---
Thank you for taking the time.
---
I have photos, but apparently there's no good way to get them off the xbox other than to screenshot, which I forgot to do. I might be on in the morning if you wanna come check it out. It's an easy walk to Whitesprings. It's the pond to the southeast, up the hill. Dave's always there, and usually willing to stay asleep in the pond unless someone fast travels in or gets too close.
---
It might be a bad time to level up. I just leveled up 3 different builds consecutively but it was fine because the sheepsquatch events were fresh and everyone joined. Now no-one seems to. 
---
Of course the fact that I leveled up to 50 before starting the story means I stuck primarily in low level areas.
---
opossums are in flatwoods by the cooking stations across from the church.
---
lever rifle is fun to use for some reason
---
I actually like when I come home to my camp and see all the doors open - it means they checked out the whole thing instead of just beelining for my vending machine. I'm very proud of my Ye Olde Tavern.
---
You're right about crops being a painn though. They just need to lower the models a bit so they sink into the dirt better, and let us build crops closer to each other.
---
Couple days ago, interested to see if it was worth the grind
---
honestly the more people bring it up the more likely it is to catch the devs attention , regardless we need posts like yours. I love that builds actually vary a lot more now than they did in 4 but switching individual cards constantly is driving me insane.
---
You monster, that chicken must have been a hero to his fellow feathered friends!
---
I appreciate the reactionary outrage in the comments, but duping and keeping thousands of pounds in your stash are two completely unrelated things. I don't know for sure how any exploit like this works, but I would take a guess and say it has something to do with the connection that A) anything in the vending machine counts as being in your stash, and has to be reset for sale if the machine is broken, and B) anything you get from scrapping camp items is automatically put into your stash
---
I honestly dont pay that much attention to the technical side of the game.  I know some of the specific armor/weapon legendary classes but yeah, not all that technical.  I just play, but I guess it does help me understand a bit more.  Thank you
---
Just go back to adventure and stay in pacifist mode and you will be ok ,asking for bgs to cater to both play styles in survival is just silly . They made survival for those that were chased out of adventure by the crying now you want them to change survival to suit your playstyle. I get it i have heard it a hundred times
---
Or both sides brick
---
Some portion of the data must be local, but I didn't think characters were. For example, all the items I had in my vending machines were moved back into my regular STASH after reinstalling to correct a bug. I haven't lost any characters though. You should contact Bethesda support - I know others who have said they've corrected glitched characters, so maybe they could see what happened and bring them back.
---
I god damn hope so
---
I usually put plans up for sale at 500 or less, no matter how awesome it is. I'm not trying to make money, just trying to find homes for all the junk I collect, without having to drop it on the ground somewhere. 
---
i.e. my stash is perpetually full and i'm trying to make room. I told a 3* weapon for 30 caps this morning. Granted it was only a bloodied pipe bolt-action rifle, but still.
---
I read somewhere that if you're over burdened majorly and you get the "this item will be destroyed if you drop it" message, you can still put all those things for sale. But I'm not really sure how it all works, and to me seems like it's obviously a bug they need to fix.
---
Hit it a couple days ago, lol
---
Stash filling back up xD
---
Leather leg armour and nothing on underneath- Ass chaps all day long.
---
Very cool and creative
---
No its the name of my establishment. A classy place for raiders to hang out and plan the next raid
---
If you're talking about the Campfire Stories, be generous there. The friggen things are made of tissue paper if you have anything remotely close to a good build. I run big guns and if I go to the event, I grab the lowest damage anything I can do (go go gadget rolling pin!)
---
[](/brolestia)I mean, I wouldn't say no to more damage, but as it stands we're tied for third most damage only beat by bloodied, and instigating which both have major drawbacks(being at low health, and only working on a full health target). The other two we tie with are also pretty bad: one only works for an in game hour before it's worse than us(nocturnal), and the other requires you have no armor whatsoever(berzerker's).  
---
After that the next best builds deal 20% less than we do, or 10% less with explosive, so I'd say we're in a good spot honestly.
---
Yes. Both sides the same. Makes more sense.
---
I'm coming!!!!
---
I will PM you
---
Omw
---
What platform you on?
---
I have a scope on mine. Build and scrap until you unlock it. You can look at Watoga station for some night vision mods too.
---
xbox?
---
Thanks everyone. Found out that like 40% of the possum questions are basic common sense while 20% of the questions relate to certain fields and the rest I ended up using google.
---
Musician and collector took the longest.
---
Was this the Legendary Behemoth to the southeast of Whitespring in the pond with the radioactive waste? If so, his name is Dave. He guards my camp and gives me legendary gifts in exchange for letting him beat on fast travelers and my razorgrain with his fire hydrant club.
---
I got a 3* Vampire's Gatling Plasma from him this morning. 250 dam resist while reloading and something else I forgot. It's pretty sweet.
---
A good reminder that I can, in fact, do anything I want!
---
I have it just willing to help
---
I haven't got a single scrip. I have the legendaries i need already
---
I got trapped in someone's floor and saw a deathclaw just casually strolling towards me and freaked. Thankfully, I was trapped in someone's floor, so my gun just shot floorboards and not deathclaws.
---
it actually feels cruel keeping him in such a small space, played with my morals way more than leaving synth Shaun to die in the Institute
---
If the pond you're referring to is over by Solomon's Pond, then yes, I believe that was Dave. Cool guy, wouldn't stop hitting me though :/
---
I can only hope to find a love like you have with your Combat Knives, haha!
---
I gave up moving my "entire" camp a long time ago, I simply assume that anywhere I move to I will need to custom build on that specific spot.  I keep a few blueprints for some smaller "structures" that I might want.  But other than that....yea.  If I move...everything gets torn apart and I rebuild a new base in THAT spot.  
---
Too dang hard to pick a house up and expect it to go back down correctly anywhere other than where it already was.  And maybe not even there.
---
I mean im not gonna argue with being tied for third. Its a nice position to hold. I guess im just a little saddened by the fact my buddies BE railway rifle does 4 times more damage than my JE railway rifle. Just seems ridiculous. Lol.
---
We not supermutants! We super mutants!
---
That username lol
---
When the game 1st cane out that quest got sooo much hate AND love on this sub.
---
Possibly. But I'd argue that if they changed something to suddenly cause a problem. Then wouldn't it be just as simple to revert the change back?
---
It's more of a problem when you're wanting to participate in events that generate mobs of flying enemies. Like....the last 2 new events? Free range and campfire tales are frustrating as hell.
---
After the patch/update
---
I’m picturing a queue outside the shop overnight. “Get your new iLegendary.... like the old one but faster and that fresh smell.”
---
Wow
---
Xbox.   Can you mod for me?
---
nop,. pc
---
For some, it's about getting the Legendaries other people need. A lucky roll for 65 scrip has the potential to make someone's day. Maybe not your day, but I like to hook people in my Discord up with great gear. This is gonna be an interesting development for me
---
I guess i should consider myself lucky then. I got bugged, skipped the entire quest. Went from Defiance has Fallen to Belly of the Beast questline. Recruitment Blues never started, pipboy says already done somehow and let me progress.
---
I have been sitting at full script and loaded down with gear on two characters for half a week now. I am so ready.
---
I've actually seen a camp there and thought "damn that's close to the behemoth." So that might have been yours....lol 
---
Btw if you have the Xbox app on your phone you can just save the screenshots from your account 👍
---
Well it's how it was last update and what people wanted to keep it at but keep it at so you are kind of on the wrong side of this.
---
Yes. I got a Aiming-VATS-BASH pipe rifle, max level (I am fairly sure, would have to double check, call it %90 sure)
---
Make a 2nd character as a Cap Mule and have a friend you could undoubtedly trust with helping move your Caps to the Mule. Being able to keep selling beyond the limit is your own problem at the moment, I have 2 Ps4s and 8 maxed out Cap mules (200K), when my 2 Main characters\accounts start getting close to 18K I go on a shopping spree or buy mutation serums to burn off the excess Caps before hitting the limit, the beauty of 2 PS4s is that I can Mule anything at Anytime. Hope this helps.
---
Mine too but I figured it was because I moved my entire camp to a new location and stored all items.
---
lolz where the f is the basement?
---
treasure maps give alot of plans too
---
Lol I wish this popped up on unloading screen :c
---
Blah, so that is why you can't inspect most things.  Hope this is fixed soon.
---
Don't confuse them!! They probably have no idea what UTC is
---
Obligatory comment that you can already do this with a mod for PCs...
---
Or several two stars, if you're like me and you've never found anything useful.
---
As far as the legendary vendor goes  the lower your needs, the higher the possibility of getting it. A very particular selected armour piece might take weeks if not months to get.
---
I payed 120 logged about 300hrs and never touched it again haven't played in months and it's worse than before lmao
---
I suspect it'll either scale, or all be max level by default. It's being presented as an end game feature.
---
i dont even know where to get low level ones
---
I'll check it out. Thanks!
---
It does. Doesn't have all the tubing. But I mean, when you're wearing armor you can't tell anyway.
---
This is a gaming subreddit, if we removed all the people who say ridiculous baseless things, it'd be 1/10 the size
---
I actually made a corn maze used about 178 corn plants(razor grain randomly in the pathway for some extra blindness) and some fences posts to prevent people from cheating. Took me forever. Then I switched servers and on the new server someone was already in the spot so I wasted like 3hours of work.
---
I used to be a heavy gunner w 3 tse's (1 gatling 2 50 cal) those were my queen guns so you know how it is everything running at you then blowing up in your face lol
---
My hobby in fo76 is doing whitespring runs with people, and while they try to kill the ghouls i heal the ghouls with my 3* gamma gun. You still get hits so you can loot them, just that your hits heal them.
---
Damn it I spent a good hour today trying to put a slanted roof over my stairs and it was that simple?!
---
I maxed out the other day. I plan on dumping them all tomorrow to get more stock for my vending machines.
---
Survival was literally created for pvp.  Literally.  Jfc.  Where do you think the incentive is for that bonus xp that you get? The fact that anyone can kill you.  Seriously stop crying and go to adventure mode. You already ruined pvp for the rest of us don’t drag that crap over into our server.
---
This is cool af +1
---
YES please! I spent 2 hours building a really awesome portable base and I made sure I could move it anywhere. Then when I put a bed inside of it, all the sudden I can’t set it down anywhere.
---
1) not yet
---
2) that was blown out of proportion. It only effected a few dozen people, and no personal information was leaked.
---
3) probably not
---
Yeah he's a bit of a dick ever since I used a weapon he gifted me to kill him. Now he lives to kill one of my razorgrains. Only one, though.
---
They've been adding patches sequentially to the archive load order thing you have to tinker with to mod it on PC. So, it's "Normal, Lights, Whatever, Update 0001, update 0002" and so on.
---
That's honestly bad ass. Good job.
---
Fucking awesome shit!!
---
Mine is a floating storefront that has two open signs on the marquee, and says "Filthy Mart"
---
Yeah, it's a bit close to Dave, but so far no major catastrophes. He usually limits his destruction to visitors and razorgrain.
---
The AP cost on the radium rifle is likely its biggest strength. I recorded it to be 26 semi auto, 13 for full auto. It is a Vats weapon. It will actually deal more total damage in Vats than an auto handmade will. More shots in Vats means more damage from concentrated fire, furious legendary, and gun fu.
---
For comparisons sake, a handmade, the “best” rifle costs about 33 AP per shot semi auto.
---
Also, the combat rifle has the same AP cost as the radium rifle. And it deals more damage. So it is the best of those four comparable rifles.
---
The assault rifle is the trash weapon.
---
Oooh, I like it.
---
There is writen +90DMG i dont own one so can't tell
---
I’m worried they are going to do something stupid like rnd the level too
---
I would check player vendors as they often sell them much cheaper than you get from NPC
---
For scope go recon
---
That's odd and very specific. Well, at least it's just the one!
---
[](/awelestia) Yeah, the power to hit a 90% damage increase plus with Adreanal Reaction you can get another 50% on top of that at death's door is pretty crazy. But that's glass cannon for you. We junkies can march around with a full health bar, we're really the brawlers of the game, we can take a beating, ***and*** dish it out.
---
Yup it must have been yours. That's awesome.  I visit him often cause he drops great loot. My camp is near the cliff edge overlooking the WS station.
---
Looks awesome. Use the cardboard vault boys with the party hats for knights lol
---
I can't even make myself place it in my CAMP, even though I really wanted one when I learned how. Once I realized it was so small I noped.
---
Will soon see if level is also rnd ugggg
---
I had this issue. Always with the furthest bouy. If you hit the intercom and sprint over to it and start there it will work. You must be at the bouy before the event starts
---
once you unlock backpack, craft a level 50 one (using armor workbench). +60 carry weight 
---
re soups, i have no clues as i found soups/meat spoil quite fast after recent updates
---
recommend: boiled/purified water, canned dog food &amp; salisbury steak
---
build a small camp &amp; some water purifier, you will never worry about water anymore :)
---
good luck and have fun!
---
Im kinda squishy atm. Mainly because i have 11 addictions. Haha. Bout to pop and addictol and start fresh. Any suggestions on which ones i should get?
---
Thank you very much
---
You put your camp next to say the leg vender building that's closed and put your mat behind the wall so when you ft you appear inside buildings you aren't supposed to be.
---
You could question how much this needed to be fixed considering if you run fast enough you out run walls spawning...
---
I've never done a treasure map. You mean you get multiple plans per treasure find?
---
Protip: you can complete this in @Adventure mode. My PSN is PurpleKingAtlas
---
Like everyone else thats paid for it but experiencing all kind of bugs , glitches and chrashes.
---
If you pay for a 3 star you get one. It just might not be what you want.
---
I just meant low level ones because I figured you wouldn't wanna scrap the high level hooks
---
It eventually worked for me but my dude did it on 4 other characters and he just went to the buoy and turned around instead of going around it and it worked for him every time.
---
[It's like saying crescent fresh.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qU_gEiSbIU)
---
Need 10 violet flux
---
i heard the same thing-- but the AA in plasma is already built in, so that's why it *shouldnt* work. That being said, i cant deny that this weapon is cutting into enemies at a rate no other weapon i have can achieve. I heard they were going to remove the AA and Explosive prefixes from weapons as well, yet here we are.
---
[](/buzzlestia)Alcohol, Daddy-o, Mentats, ,Med-X and Daytripper are my preferences since they're the only 5 that don't lower my Strength.
---
&gt; Bethesda didn't magically know every person's shipping address and i think they're laws about sending stuff without confirmation.
---
They already know the address of everyone because they had already shipped it. If it was from a 3rd party like Amazon then Amazon already has re shipping feature.
---
I don't think it's the duper...it's the slow cloud servers. Try SBQ with 20s players.
---
You might never get it. Dont want to be a dick but people need to keep in mind how insanely small the chances are of getting what you want.
---
I have a feeling we will see a lot of dissapointed people
---
Probably a good idea, thats kind of where im struggling right now.
---
There used to be an exploit with the Artillery that would let you go over the stash limit.
---
Well the cryolator made it in the game....lol
---
As long as it's not labeled as such they could reuse any generic items.
---
Long scope gives highest accuracy. No matter what kind. NV, recon ect.
---
It also gives you an opportunity to explore the world for some badges, nothing wrong with that in my opinion!
---
Usually only one per map when they drop
---
Very coooool! Best built I've ever seen!
---
Are you on PC and if yes, pls let me know your ign so I can visit your camp!!
---
The current duping method does not crash the server.
---
I want to try the game so bad lol. I’m a huge fallout fan and want to know. Is it really really bad?
---
Omg their headquarters will be burned to the ground if that haapens. Thats why im waiting. Im more excited for the posts here than the actually vendor.
---
This has been the status quo since beta for me.   1 star wooden armor drops the most.  1 star armor alone isn't necessarily a deal breaker, especially at earlier levels.   
---
Constantly getting 1 star wooden armor with effects like nocturnal and ghoul slayer really sucks though.
---
Damn if I was paying attention to reddit ugh
---
That's when you either glitch in with a crafting table/chair or you jump onto the roof with marsupial/a jetpack and look for an opening
---
I'm getting on now, what's your gt?
---
The Whitespring Dome statue would be perfect for the queen!
---
You are not alone, I live in the bog. Tried it twice and gave up, think it’s a glitch with the new daily.
---
Does your camp move around on it's own?
---
My wife is currently doing the mission. Apparently there is a virtual vault simulation room that allows you to power up the school so hope it works. Will keep you posted
---
Ran across a group trying to do this on PC last night.
---
Ive found mr bandit he pleaded like the broken mr handy then when got close he attempted to rob me...poor bot never stood a chance. Lol
---
find a better spot.
---
Wow that's awesome. Was this before they implemented the capability of switching to a different server or was this the one where it was gone forever.
---
And just when I've thought I've saw it all
---
Posts like this are so funny. People are so gullible
---
Please, that would be awesome
---
@Kreiggles

DontTreadOnMe28
---
Totally. I need the plans still!
---
I list all my Ultracite plans for 25caps. And they don't sell. Might drop it to 1c tomorrow
---
Same here I started at 124. Now my new alt character has speed demon, marsupial, egghead, healing factor, and adrenal reaction.  Applied at lvl 11 and boy has it been fun. Have to share starched genes with my level 188 character, but its been great so far.
---
People are selling it for 500 rn so..
---
Yet another asinine argument that ignores how Bethesda deceptively marketed this game to an audience who have been experiencing Fallout for decades as a single player game.
---
Haha that's a great idea
---
I think it is spoiled flux and is like purified water without the healing, but if I’m correct it weighs less.
---
All your base are belong to us?
---
[Not like us.](https://imgur.com/XKb3jyn)
---
Water
---
Thank you!
---
Place your camp down in the same location and then plAce everything
---
Same here...dropped the DNA but terminal doest work
---
26?!?!  That brings back memories.  Someone rushed over to a bench, made me a hardened lever action with a scope, dropped it at my feet, and took off.
---
I loooooved that gun for so long.
---
I dunno if I have that crafting skill, but if you need me to try, lemme know! (Xbox)
---
Seriously
---
Come visit my camp sometime. I always have a shit ton of treasure maps, all reasonably priced at 1 cap ea.
---
someone set him up the bomb!
---
Obviously flux is used for fluxing.
---
Did you mess your links up, or am I on some shit
---
They’re free from the terminal for anyone who bothered to do the quest...
---
Wow, today I probably had sold about 50ish stims for 27 caps each their definitely is a demand. Maybe it has something to do with the foot traffic? I’m located just outside white springs so tons of people come
---
But actually it’s used in the crafting of some ultracite ammo and fusion cores. Check out chemistry and tinkers bench. Flux is also used as water which gains like ~33% water
---
usually only one per if at all
---
I’ll give you 15 caps. No more no less
---
Placing the CAMP down in the same location deletes everything. Rebuilding everything sounds really discouraging. Even if I did, for whatever reason the place I had been CAMPing at for weeks/months all of the sudden is having object placement problems and that is pretty frustrating as well
---
No
---
I've had it glitch as well. Every time. I load the sample into the machine (Which says is unpowered prior to putting it in), quest marker says analyse but no option to, so I go to the power terminal to turn power on and no option in said terminal to turn it on.
---
I've also tried turning the power on before loading the sample but same outcome
---
Everyone can get the leg plans for free from Taggerdy’s terminal any time after they’ve completed Belly of the Beast. The motion servos may have some value, don’t know if it’s 1500 though.
---
Check English, then worry about fallout.
---
Maybe it’s just a higher chance because I’ve heard both the stories and I have yet to get a badge from the event
---
I've done this event more than 20 times . I've had many times where the camp counselor spawns after the screaming tape plays and I do not get the possum badge
---
double punching stims works in power armor. I don't spend much time in power armor, but I only ever need multiple healing while in power armor anyway, so it works out for me. I wait til i get a little low and then pop 4-5 stimpacks in rapid succession, which tends to heal at a rate that's a little better than whatever legendary asshole is currently hurting me.
---
I think I have em...
---
and surely after all that cleaner I've picked up I know I washed my panties at least once.
---
Same, the other day I seen a paper bag with a ton of useful mats in it (like 23 Alu, bunch of Adhesive, acid, etc...) I waited around to see if anyone was gonna pick it up, nope...everyone FT'd away so I went and took it.
---
I picked up about 15-20 legendaries today. All armor plus a stalkers lead pipe and a furious (I think) black powder pistol. All trash really.
---
I believe, cannon is purity came online
---
With the new update, only one foundation needs to be touching the floor
---
If you can't access the item and store it, i'm pretty sure rebuilding the camp is the only way.
---
What kind of fucking star does it have?! That, like, prolly influences what price it is.
---
I know right.
---
I'd totally buy red dreads, it'd go great with the nuka-girl rocket suit. Speaking as a male character.
---
But seriously, more hair, and hopefully for free.
---
Looks awesome, love it!
---
seriously cannot take you seriously  
---
As someone who had gaming systems back in 1994 and laughed at console players bragging, you seem to know little about how computer systems actually work- (and the headaches involved is what got me to shift back to consoles around 2005) it is literally said in another subthread of your very  own comment  
---

---
Cannot help it if you cannot tweek you bomb ass system, or have a system that is over 5 years old, or can't afford the bandwidth or use wifi or the multitude of other things outside ot Beth's control that MAY contribute to the game being unstable.   
---
All your "comparisons" are apples to oranges- Minecraft (don't make me laugh, does this even justify a response because \*hint\* graphics), LoL yeah, I always compare an arena style game to a a massive open world, PoE the worlds are instanced to the player or party, not everyone in on giant open world and Anthem doesn't merit a reply.  
---
" I hope it does die soon so ..." we don't ever get a Buggy Bethesda game again, ever.  
---
That is pretty much what you are saying, or what you gonna say that you had no clue that Beth's games are always buggy, hilariously so sometimes- again, this shows you have no understanding of business, a failing gme hurts investment, which pays for idk ESO6  
---
btw, who is paying you, since obviously all those who love the game, glitches bugs and all, aarre paid shills for Beth, by alternate reality logic, all those who dis it are paid by the competition (it is sarcasm, relax)-- though seriously, I don't downvote anything you said because we all can have opinions and with computers "mileage may vary" but with today's comments and rants you get a few- because you really are not being objective in any measure of the term- so good you hate it, don't play it.
---
Well crap
---
well I get this totally. and it's fair. but adding clean fixed versions and other choices is a request to add in addition to current. I think everyone wants more of all.
---
Yes they were so sneaky, telling no one it was a multiplayer game with no human NPCS... Wait.
---
Scrip. There's exchange machines at every train station now where you can scrap legendary items in exchange for scrip, and tomorrow they're adding a new merchant who sells you new legendaries in exchange for your Scrip. You can choose how many stars and if it's armor, ranged, or melee, but everything else is randomized.
---
Sorry man I'm crashing out, I'm exhausted tonight
---
Im.in adding both yall's
---
I was so fond of my crappy little shack with all crafting benches on the porch in a nice, convenient crossroad location for lower level players. And then vending happened. I rebuilt and redecorated, and now have... a slightly less ugly two story shoebox with a few bells and whistles, and still remain envious of all the camps I see.
---
You mean legendary script? It’s what you get when you turn in unwanted legendaries to the new machine at train stations. When the purveyor comes, she’ll sell you new legendaries for script.
---
That's the legend.
---
Yikes to that. An opportunity to make changes I suppose, but at the same time I wonder why all of the sudden my spot is having placement issues. I love this game but boy does it seem to not like me back sometimes lmao
---
Either that or move the stairs and put it back when you are done.
---
Correct. It does weigh less. If I have inert flux I'll usually stash my water and just carry that around.
---
i would think it just shortens the time it takes to bring it up
---
Some bags shipped through major game stores. Bethesda almost certainly isn't just allowed to take those stores record to use them as they see fit, add that to people having moved, people sending it to in boxes or pickup locations, or friends houses, or any other number of reasons. There is almost certainly no possibly way that Bethesda could just pull out a large list of addresses to send to. That's not how privacy and security works for businesses
---
You have to go to fort defiance and get the note that used to trigger the quest.
---
Aren’t you a raider though?
---
Under the room you are in is the virtual vault.  You have to go down there to switch on the power
---
To the PS4 guy who made the strip club camp by Watoga, complete with stripper pole and private lap-dance room: Never change.
---
PS: He got his character naked and got up on stage. Never ask your employees to do what you wouldn't do!
---
Now he just needs camp robots to be the strippers.
---
Thank you for clarifying this.  This recipe and the bomber one are all I need left
---
Drank it
---
Wow, incredible write-up. It really gives a new perspective.
---
It’s been months of this bug happening and you’re still “investigating?”
---
Interesting I literally just finished running it again.
---
I'm now 0-3 with bug kid and 3-3 with the screaming girl for getting possum badges.
---
yep, i found no weapons/armor at all, all plans I knew and only a couple of ammo dumps- I really liked it that way since caps are so easy to come by anyway I don't see the need to vend
---
Just finally reached 719/625/95. Trying to get it higher, not sure if it helps. Full set of buttressed sent Vanguard marine armor and armored backpack. Max barbarian, max iron clad, strange in numbers, 2 in bodyguards, 2 in evasive, and class freak. Scaley skin, herd mentality, grounded. I have max bullet shield which gives me another 60 when shooting big guns. Touching 800 Dr when shooting and almost 1k when reloading with my +250 dr when reloading legendary on my gun. Haven’t really confirmed if having numbers this high makes any difference. I don’t fully understand how DR works I need to look at the equation and do some math to understand more fully, but IMO anything with a % to stop damage is actually better because that math is more simple and doesn’t leave you with a fixed number (if you pass this number there’s no additional changes) at some point like DR does I believe.
---
They could have atleast tried to give to people who they could.  
---
Or atleast tried to make a ingame message, emailed to people who purchased it informing that they need added to ship bags. They do have account linked to collectors edition. They didn't tried any of that.   
---
If they already showed how much they cared when details from customers support were leaked
---
I ve seen a few high rise bright colored buildings scattered here and there (downtown charleston  has one) but not player made. and plenty of  neon letters too which we can currently buy in game. if I dont like it I just move along ...but now I feel the urge to finally use my neon letters to spell "its lit" in your honor. thank you for the suggestion friend.
---
My current mutation load is:
---
Adrenal Reaction
---
Bird Bones
---
Healing Factor
---
Marsupial
---
Plague Walker
---
Scaly Skin
---
Speed Demon
---
Talons
---
My character is wearing a Tadpole skirt and can one shot most legendary ghouls with an Instigating Deathclaw Gauntlet (w/extra claw, makes a noticeable difference)
---
I use guns often enough though, that I'm hesitant to pull the trigger on Twisted Muscles, pun intended. Anyone have thoughts on that?
---
the fact that richard grey is still mutating, even if on the other side of the country, at the same time that i’m punching things to death is. 
---
terrifying honestly
---
it was datamined that it is 25% chance
---
Thank you lots! :)
---
I imagine it probably took up more processing power somehow than spawning you directly into some foundations. Or it's an eventual "convenience item" they want to change for.
---
That one is also broken for me
---
Ghouls are only made from humans who just-so-happened to react to radiation differently. No rhyme or reason to it.
---
Sounds right, I'm 3-12 right now.
---
Metal death bunker to the outside world, cosy-rosy wallpaper and potted plants on the inside.
---
I appreciate that. Thanks :)  I took inspiration from a YouTuber named Rellygirl who did a build at this site.
---
You are a member of the vocal minority who gets what they want by incessantly crying ,now that the other side is speaking up you are unhappy about it . So just because i disagree with you im on the wrong side , lol .
---
yep about the same for me
---
It's a good way to get plans. I'll wait until I have 5 for any given map and then go digging.
---
Thanks! Me too!
---
1 star bloodied would be....bloodied.
---
see my response to OP
---
I just went through this last night. You have to go back to Fort Defiance and on the fourth floor there is a note that has the computer password. Once you read it it, you can return to the University and complete the tasks.
---
Oh, I know. But wanting a melee weapon with swing speed, and that's it means lower expectations. Not like I want an unyeilding marine metal left arm with weight reduction, and +1 strength puts the search into marathon territory. People were sure they could roll up with a 2* weapon, put it in to be upgraded maybe a couple of times until they got a God roll weapon. Oh well.
---
FYI it maxes out 1000 so don’t scrap anymore legendaries if you reach that amount.
---
not that I can do much with them because the tadpole quest is bugged for me so I can't get a backpack unless they patch it somehow
---
I regularly hunt the top three so you have probably never shared a server with me
---
Thanks! I couldn't resist the challenge of building around the pre-existing structure.
---
I said this the other day! But of course my post gets no headline...sigh
---
also, once you get to level 50, you get the option to move a special point from one place to another (like taking one out of luck and moving it to agility, for example), OR to pick a new perk card
---
Ok
---
Glad I could accidentally help, lol!
---
Tabitha and Lily wear women's clothing because they were originally female prior to the transformation. They are now sexless. The clothing just a remnant of their past sexuality and personality.

Nothing better than dying in an interior just to take 5 minutes loading into the exterior and then back into the interior &lt;3

OOPS! sorry ps4 I thought I put that in there lol

This fellow deserves upvotes people.

Imma need to know where those stripper pole plans are
---
I did, the easiest way to describe it is being close enough for the "high def" bridge model to be visible, instead of the lower quality "distance" model.  Except... it's so high off the ground that you'll either end up directly under it pointing the camera straight up, or on the bridge itself.

It's obvious that China has seeded this subreddit to stop people from digging too deep into the game and realizing its depictions of Chinese infiltrator companies in WV is 100% FACT

it sucks cause like i can kinda get where he’s coming from, that he wants to end war and bring about peace
---
my dude is going about it in ALL the wrong ways. making everyone the same ain’t gonna solve anything 😩
---
definitely one of my favorite characters of the series but oooooooh man he’s scary
---
It’s fucking ridiculous.
---
So cool, reminds me of wizards chess ;)
---
yeah it’s happened to me a couple times. i’ve mostly noticed it if i get kicked out of a server for one reason or another
---
Whatever floor piece you tried placing the object on, move that. The misplaced object might still be linked to the floor piece and reappear on it once it's moved.
---
Yes, but you advised that you had to contact Bethesda because your character was broken. But in the title you also advised that the save was glitched. I wondered if deleting the save file would've fixed the issue yourself without having to contact and wait for Bethesda to fix your account.   
---
I didn't mean that this glitch doesn't exist because it hasn't happened to me, I was just advising that I haven't had this occur to me in the number of times my camp has been occupied, which is all the time.  
---
Lucky me, right!
---
Ok, I'm getting tired. I read that as half sized chairs at first. There was confusion till part way in.

yeah same i wanted to console him and be like “aw buddy your heart was in the right place tho”
---
i wonder how things would’ve turned out if you could’ve told him that even though his plan was terribly flawed, that he could reverse what he’d done and/or use his “army” (for lack of a better word) for good
---
are you fast travelling to a friend instead of the event marker? I know that will bug out events sometimes. I've yet to have one not give xp except a couple of failures.
---
the event is broken, there are times you wont get a fucking thing for completing it. It has nothing to do with the event, though the spawns change.
---
It’s in the title boy
---
Do Swimming, Archery, And Athletics.  Those are the easiest to complete and don't seem to be bugged for anyone.
---
Inert flux is spoiled raw flux that you did not go through the steps to stabilize. (Mix 10 with hardened mass, glowing mass, and high radiation fluids at a chem bench.) Raw flux can be used to craft orbital strikes and stabilized or pure flux is used to craft many things like ammo, mods, decontamination showers, and the like, but inert flux is past its use by date and only good as a source of water.
---
The last line was a bit hard to take out of context? But that's fair. And okay but 25 tse is a bit weird if it's same weapon type. And that's fair too but my problem is the small percent shouldn't be Perma banned? You know what I mean? That's what I disagree with. The small percent bought this game and genuinely don't deserve to even be away this long..that's where as a consumer who's able to play, I feel it's my duty to stand up for that small percent. I don't really see many people caring about it and it makes me sad. If that happened to me with all the work that's into my now level 180 character...I'd probably get legit depressed. That's why I think we need to find a way to make sure we have a concrete way to tell. So just the large majority is punished. You're 100 percent right. Like 85 % were dupers. But...as a community, what are we doing for the 15%? They're still not allowed to play a game they purchased because of duping assholes, they got caught up into the faulty bot banning by bethesda which their alloted reason was like over 1,000 of certain items. Stimpaks were a listed one. I think I craft about 400 a week.. (With bloodied build you literally just gotta...lol)
---
I feel like we not only need to take action against dupers, but bethesda as well for the way they 'distinguish' who dupes with bot ban, which any bot ban they've used in the past is notoriously faulty and this really was too. Would you keep the small percent Perma banned if it meant keeping the rest banned? I wouldn't. Because the innocent players are invaluable. And the dupers would probably just fuck up again and get re banned soon after lol. 
---
But the problem with this reddit is if you say anything like this, they all immediately down vote you and never want to have a conversation about it. Fucking awful..I can't imagine how this reddit was after the ban, if this is how they talk about it months after.
---
Ad some zeros to that
---
How did you manage to find out the vats cost?
---
did you check your collections and see? it never shows my rewards for that event but i do get the badges and have gotten the tent and smores recipe
---
If you will be Benny, then we need a Yes man.
---
Check your stored items.  Scrap those if you have any.
---
no lol my bug is way different if it was just that id be done
---
that would be an interesting scenario
---
Cool, it's taking me a little longer.
---
I got pre-war dolla' dolla' bills ya'll!
---
i dont have anything. no badges, no exp, no plans. nothing. I checked. my wife checked. she has 4 possum badges already.
---
No, i always walk up on the event. In fact, im the one who triggers it by being there when the sun sets. I always start the quest, and im always first there. Because I wait for the 2-3 minutes it takes before it triggers just before dusk.
---
What's happening
---
Yeah found this out after I bought it (sigh)
---
Thanks - my male characters looks "fabulous" at the moment. Shame we cant sell these items
---
I have a mic but I won't be using it, ready whenever
---
I'm on right now, can you play?
---
currently online if anyone wants to stop by! ;)
---
Sure lemme add you
---
Right
---
Or I can go onto the market reddit instead and sell the item for what it's actually worth and not lower my prices for such a mere reason. 
---
I'm not lowering the price of my 3* anti armor swing speed deathclaw gauntlet from 9,000 because that's what it's worth. 
---
I'm not mad if it doesn't sell. Someone will come buy who has knowledge of the items worth and sell it. 
---
Most player vendors I've seen either over price like 4,000 for perfect storm (worth less than 1,000) or will under price like jumpsuits for 1,000 caps. 
---
This just showed me that nobody knows the worth of the items they procure.
---
I mean I underprice junk only because I'm a hoarder and it helps me.
---
Use player vending to fast travel a round the map. Make sure to 'discover' nearby landmarks and sites. My new alt's map is pretty well populated with discovered sites just after a couple of days shopping. Also use vault 76 to cut down fast travel costs. It's free to fast travel to your CAMP or vault 76. If either is between you and a destination travel there 1st free then pay the fast travel cost.
---
On PlayStation it takes for ever, my pc loads it almost instantly but I prefer PS4
---
Yeah you could have gotten 2,000 for that. 
---
Won't lie I love taking advantage of the people that make their prices stupidly low so if you're on ps4 hmu, I'll roll by that shop of yours and clean it out for you so I can resell it appropriately lol.
---
I use the Fasnacht pole at one build.
---
This is worth around 800 caps...lol I hate that
---
Yeah I've rebuilt my base like 3 times now. I now have a base with an arena on a stone plateau with a small town underneath with my personal quarters and my power and vending machines. Fun fact about my base of a scorchbeast flies close enough it will actually land in the arena for a close quarters fight.
---
The only overpriced thing I have is a perfectly preserved piece of pie for no particular reason at 10k
---
Weird I've done the event over 20 times and never had a problem.
---
 Swearing at Bethesda like a child isn't going to solve your problems either.
---
Update I hopped on tonight right before bed and saw the canoe fire event happening, ended up getting it as a reward thank yo for offering to help!
---
I don't want any restrictions put on pvp just changes to the leaderboard.
---
That’s it! Make me take my medicine!
---
I'm wondering if anybody would really wait around for that long. You can't put anything into your stash until it's back below 800, so that's a long time to run on just whatever you have on you.
---
My ps4 just went psycho, restarting it
---
[](/lcehappy)If you enjoy that, you might be interested in [this post from a while back](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/9ufsmo/rl_dates_of_fallout_events_in_76/). It shows the real life days certain events would take place at FO76s timescale assuming that time counted down from the creation of the first character in the beta.

---
water plus 25% disease resistance when consumed
---
hmm might be bugged as you said then
---
No probs
---
Just FYI this has been officially reported.
---
Was this on PC, in the savage divide?
---
But why didnt the frame weigh anything before placing it down?
---
Yeah, seriously.
---
No I mean the poll Bethesda made before the change, you are in the minority for leaderboard preference.
---
i dont really give a shit what your perspective of my language is, or it if hurts their poor feelings. Their a goddamn company. Grow up.
---
The grind is already egregious as FUCK for the backpack alone, (because there's no content in this game) nevermind the plans or any mods for it, and they already dont really give a damn about what the community has to say. Seems like all this quest is, is something to string you all along until they drop some 'real' content, maybe if you're lucky in October. 
---
I'm not satisfied, this content sucks, and its fucking broken.
---
The quest is working fine. Did you know there’s a reset timer? I bet you got rewards the first time you did it and then nothing the next 5 times right? Well you can’t spam the event over and over. You have to wait otherwise nothing will drop. Chill out and have a seat.
---
That's terrible news :(
---
A braided undercut hairstyle would make me literally nut.
---
My newest brown bag is digestive goo, glass shards, raw leather, a blood pack, and toilet paper.  Yeah...don’t ask.
---
I'll give you 002 caps.
---
I never got anything at all. No exp, No items, No plans, NOTHING. What do you not understand about this?
---
I believe that is the case.  For every pic in that directory, there's an accompanying thumbnail image.
---
There's another mod that turns bags into Fasnacht balloons. It's made my life in-game a lot more easy when things go wrong.
---
You’ve never gotten anything ever from the event, EVER? If so you’re literally the only one that’s experiencing this bug. Good luck
---
Tomorrow
---
u/Ladydevann u/Valseek
---
That's why I'm reporting it. It's not the first time weird shit happened in a fucking bethesda game.
---
shit, the other day the goddamn game was giving out free survival legendaries in Adventure mode, so don't think it's not out of the realm of possibility. This IS bethesda we're still talking about.
---
Yeah but everyone was experiencing that bug. Not just you. Still, I believe you. Todd’s in the bathroom now, when he gets out and gets back in bed I’ll talk to him about this
---
yea see what i mean :(
---
I think we could eventually have terminals for that.
---
Listen to yourself lol. Telling others to "grow up".
---
You sound like a entitled spoiled child.
---
I do. That seriously sucks ass. I hope they fix that shit for you
---
You sound like an entitled spoiled child.

The WV Lumber mill towards the very northwest of the map spawns loads of super mutants. Go a bit past it and you can build a base there. The mutants will be between lvl 5-20 I think.
---
Seeing all of y’all hitting 1k when i literally just got to 90...
---
Well it clearly displays that on the pictures and text. You could also say when buying from atom shop, keep at least one eye open.
---
It's been my theory that Bethesda would increase the drop rates if shitty gear to offset the Purveyor.
---
It's a classic casino bait and switch. Make the slot machine win more often but decrease the payout.

War, war never changes.
---
When this happens to me I find that it helps to close out of build mode and then go back into it.  That usually fixes the problem for me at least
---
If they aren't already in your friends list they aren't your friend. Learned in Sea of thieves
---
Harpers Ferry vendor sells the meat hooks plans, buy them, craft then scarp a bunch. You should get it after the 5th or 6th one.
---
False I've grinded it out for hours I got most all the stuff for badges
---
Oh, Mothman bless you! Thanks) nearly got crazy searching non existing recipe)
---
I was just there!!! No plans. Hold on let me go back
---
Ah, i figured that was a global bug, i just didnt see any reports about it myself (must have just missed it). 
---
this is weird though, Ive never had a quest complete, and then nothing. Its like the quest is registering a failure before. And full disclosure, I failed the thing like on my 2nd or 3rd try, couldnt keep the fire on, but yeeeesh.
---
Stop with that now.  Don't scare them away.  Come right over, I have these lovely shots you might like to try.  Get the most out of your wasteland with these serums.
---
&gt;maybe the rules are different for plans and flux requirements?
---
No. He is talking about generic protected and shielded linings that can apply to many underarmor. Flux is always required.
---
This isn't "new", it's been happening for months.
---
Yes, same!! I ask people to build me some of the atomic shop cool cosmetic’s for caps but most of them don’t even reply to me :-/ I just want cool stuff &amp; can’t buy it :-/
---
I don't really care.
---
That would make sense, if we were making characters during pre-war. But we aren't. We're making wastelanders, who aren't up and up on the current status quo.
---
Todd to E3!
---
Are you running back to the campfire to deposit the kindling or are you just picking it up?
---
These guys dont even need the loot. The day before I met someone who one shotted a legendary before I could get a shot at it (same story like you). But he didmt wven grab the loot.
---
huh, that's interesting-- that makes this bug more frustrating .
---
Dwight?
---
It may take some sever hoping. It’s a rarer plan I believe
---
MICHAEL!!!
---
And down the corridor, is the room where I shit
---
I wish I didn't feel so clueless during the exams. I know overall, most of the questions were common knowledge, but some of them came out of left field and there weren't really any in-game resources to assist with the questions. They could've at least told you which ones you got wrong at the end of the exams, ya know, like a real exam...
---
Casual, as it desribes in the atom shop. Casual is kinda like Responders.
---
I’ve been having this issue for maybe over a month now. Pretty much every combat encounter will have 3 or so missed hit when I’ll be perfectly lined up, in range and I hear it make contact but no damage. Also great job on the last like 3-4 patches guys! They’ve made the game considerably better.  I really appreciate your efforts. But please for the love of god introduce perk card presets / load outs we can make! That would be absolutely huge in terms of QOL
---
Took me 3 hours but I did it lol
---
But how are low-level players supposed to get any valuable loot? I mean they cant deal a whole lot of damage, while taking the full risk of dying. 
---
I think a system, that doesnt count the damage but the" time spent" or "ammo wasted" on a particular enemy would be the fairest for both high and low level players
---
I'm sorry about the Explosive Laser Rifles thing-- that is kinda crappy. But you think that's nuts?  
---
try Anti-Armor, explosive Gatling Plasma with a beam splitter.
---
This! Get this man or woman a raise!
---
No doors to pick, no benches to glitch, no windows to slip. I've got a smart home in the wasteland!
---
I'm making a b-line back to campfire, its like the twigs arent leaving my inventory and the fire is still highlighted, even though i run over it, touch it, touch the bot-- its broken dude
---
I've gotten the s'mores recipe 3 times but nothing else. Just got my first possum badge tonight so maybe I'll have better luck tomorrow.
---
Looks like I'm going to have to bring in Primm Slim.
---
good luck! sorry you have to constantly do an unfun quest to get an item that's practically necessary now.
---
Then I'll just use my chameleon armor to hide until you open the door, I like hiding in people's camps anyways, spent like 10 minutes crouched in somebody's porta potty the other day.
---
The Anti Armor is popular these days.  I enjoy the Bloodied.  Also, Instigating works well with a sneak, sniper.
---
I think i was developing a headache today with my charisma, mine is fairly low at 3, so it was switch travel cards, to sell cards, to travel cards, to fight cards, over and over and over.  One time i forgot home defence on and left action boy off and i don’t honestly know how long i had it that way for.
---
I’m sure a lot of other people are better at remembering to switch cards than i am, but i am a very casual player, i’m used to the previous fallouts where you just pick your perk and forget about it.
---
I wish that at the very least, objects placed in specific workshops went back into the said workshop's inventory for use across any server after either leaving or getting disconnected from the game. I don't really even bother with claiming workshops anymore because of this reason. Just tired of wasting resources
---
I learned the mod somehow; I don't remember if it was from a plan or scrapping.
---
I was about to debate you on the merits of the meat hook, as I rock a power fist, but you're right, it may be the best *one-handed* weapon. If it hasn't been fixed yet, I believe it benefits from Gladiator *and* Iron Fist.
---
Op: "Bethesda please no more revive quest"
---
Bethesda: "This story made my day! Lets do even crazier challenges!"
---
good job :D
---
Yes it does
---
I sell bobble heads for 50 and magazine for 20. And sell all I have so I might be low   But I don’t have use for them and want them gone
---
Inert flux hydrates you and provides +5% disease resistance. It also gives your skin a nice, healthy glow.
---
You think that's bad. Try loading up your vending with 120 different things and see what happens.
---
Just anything really would be nice
---
I had that late at night, tried to get a camp able server for 4 times, until I gave up and played without my camp.
---
Little before I was kicked out from previous server because of maintanance. I think late at night, no new servers are started, until morning comes. So I get into the same server over and over. This was on EU.
---
Would be cool if you had to "extend" a unterarmor (with 2x leather) in order to wear it above your armor.
---
&gt;it was datamined that it is 25% chance
---
Oh good, fuck this event then.
---
Fuck em!
---
You sir have made my night. And i am going to enjoy 76 so much more with these thoughts in mind. Have an upvote, you deserve it
---
PS4 but yeah
---
I only buy bobbleheads if they are 50 or below in caps. I haven't seen many people at all successfully sell them for more than that. I have seen plenty of them for 100 caps go untouched.
---
Anti armor is good vs everything.  Executioner's very good against bosses, but doesn't see much benefit against normal enemies.
---
Tank killer is good. I'm slowly removing things to add stars to tank killer. I liked having cannibal but there so much food, the stagger bonus is way better.
---
Of the mob is aggro'd by something (another mob or player) you do not get the sneak bonus.
---
Huh. Back when I was playing a lot of Destiny I upgraded my PS4's hard drive to an SSD. This considerably improved loading times to the point where I'd load into strikes *way* ahead of other players and oftentimes ended up just pulling those poor suckers along for the ride.
---
Does your PS4 have an SSD?
---
It's not that hard to pick up atoms without paying. I've yet to buy atoms and I've had the game since launch and have picked up quite a bit of stuff from the shop
---
Tasty, tasty meat...
---
Camp placement, servers and all online functionality are as brand new as Bethesda could ever do anything.
---
It's true, they had to do it all at once, so small things like this, seem to be made in adhoc manner. After all we didn't originally have this. Your camp just didn't deploy at all.
---
And if your camp was wrong kind, the kind that it didn't occur to Bethesda you'd made one, you lost all or most of your camp constructions if the camp collided. I had to keep on building my workbenches over and over.
---
So, maybe it's fair that it mostly works pretty fine.
---
We can manufacture high grade energy weapons that easily match pre-war equivalent, I'm sure we could manufacture some new tools for building, not to mention the camp itself is vault-tec wizardry in the first place.
---
Frankly, just let me change the key to attach a fucking wire.
---
Does it say you completed the quest and you get nothing? I ask because 9 times out of 10 it seems like people are actually following the quest tasks like making sure the fire doesn’t die out and just run around killing bugs. If you don’t do the various tasks you will fail and get nothing.
---
The backpack? Nah, I'm just a sucker for plans. I use my excavator power armor. If I log out in it I have 545 carry weight. 
---
Good luck to you, I'm sure you'll wind up getting enough. Once the challenges are fixed it should be easier to get through everything.
---
i sell the bobble heads for default price cause i’m too lazy to change it
---
i sell magazines for 30
---
As lvl 80 it took me thousand of ammo, I broke 6 weapons including minigun, gatling plasma, anti armor shotgun, anti armor power fist, missile launcher (well those last only 30 shots anyways)... And I used 60 stimpaks, 10 nuka grenades, 20 plasma grenades and ton of other stuff and I died 3 times until I got to console... and entered wrong code loosing the card. It's gonna be pain to try alone, those robots are though and 50lvl major gutsy will always two shot kill yet you have to deal around ~3000dgm to it. And those assaultrons, Two hit kill as well. I recommed legendary gear with improved damage against robots.
---
 Still bugged a week later. This game launched way too early.
---
If they work the same as outfits and such, other players can't build you Atomic Shop stuff for your Camp.
---
I think what the person is trying to say is that during an event all the participants should be able to loot all of the Corpses just as if they were all in one gigantic group.
---
yeah i use the same thing with the exca armor. TBH-- my whole deal is wrapped up in power armor, heavy weapons build. 
---
but i like to not use cores to grind for cores.
---
I can distinctly tell the difference between the game saying 
---
Campfire Tales: Complete 
---
and 
---
Campfire Tales: Failed
---
Ive seen them both, tonight.
---
I sell bobbleheads for 100 and magazines for 15.
---
I don't care enough to use either and where the magazines are so situational that feels fair to me.
---
I mean, when the nuke hits, we run towards it
---
Exactly! I always get bored with my camp, no matter where it is or how I build it. I look for inspiration a lot but I just can't find anything I think looks good. The walls we have now are just not what I'm looking for.
---
Spend a whole night grinding for literally nothing, then come talk to me.
---
That is all I want, I currently use tents because it's the closest I feel I can get to a cute little camp vibe.
---
This isn't a bug :I
---
Anti armor for robots and super mutants as they have high armor values. Executions for Ghouls and scorched at least when they are low hp will technically hit harder but the difference is honestly small. Anti armor is usually better overall.
---
i wanted to a tent camp!! awesome! do you have pics of it to share?
---
What is that PA helmet for example? Is it a skin or the entire helmet. I haven't used T-51b so I can't say how it looks like. And Im on PC so I can't try it.
---
Speaking as someone who has both an explosive cryloator and an explosive Gatling laser that I was lucky enough to acquire legitimately  through grinding, I can tell you that they are far from extraordinary.   For starters, like ballistic explosive weapons, they were nerfed.
---
Unlike ballistic explosive weapons, they do not benefit from the demolition expert perk. 
---
***At all.*** 
---
So, if people are paying a shitload of caps for these legacy laser weapons, expecting some kind of advantage in PVP or PVE,  I can tell you that they are being scammed. 
---
I honestly don't see any advantage provided by my explosive Gatling laser or explosive cryolator. 
---
Fun? Yeah, occasionally. 
---
God tier?  Nowhere close.
---
Whoa, guess it just sucks to suck then.
---
I thought all plans were static now and never changed
---
I'm low-level; moved my camp last week and it cost me 5 caps lol.
---
Whoa. Guess it just sucks to suck then.
---
FYI: Magazines don’t count for challenges if you buy them. Learned this the hard way. Useless to buy them
---
Booze tho
---
Whitesprings, if you're looking at the golf club entrance it's to the right on the greens next to a little stream.
---
Some of us don't have the resources to waste entire rolls my guy.
---
Oh cool! How much do you want for it? :)
---
I kinda forgot the gatling laser could even *have* a beam splitter on it, that's terrifying.
---
But yeah, as much as these weapons are a problem right now, the solution shouldn't include screwing over people who legitimately acquired theirs by just getting rid of *all* of 'em.
---
It sucks because bethesda austin doesnt know what they are doing. 
---
also, that failure came with a group of 8 ALL working on the same objective, all level 100 or better, the game is broken.
---
I’d love a bit more flat areas lol hills are nice but sometimes ya just want a flat piece of land in between some trees
---
i didnt realize i could get one until i found one built into it (not very strong, but shooting it made my eyes go wide) 
---
its not accurate, but who needs accuracy, right? Just be careful not to accidentally GOO-ify yourself!
---
Queen always wins.
---
So much win
---
It was in that damn crater, wasn’t it?
---
I offer my ammo at the best possible price. 0 caps a bullet.
---
I've heard something similar but I can do it in some of my other games so either they didn't talk with Sony or don't know they need to.
---
In all honestly I was just frustrated that that this is still an issue and that they are releasing more and more stuff but offering no clear solution or workaround for us despite knowing about it pre-launch.
---
Thanks I'll try. Do you have a link for the cards? I searched Amazon but couldn't find anything.
---
I wondered this myself. If you sell 1 bullet for cap, Bethesda takes their 10% and you would get 9/10ths of a cap, could someone just buy 1 round at a time and just screw you on money?
---
Anyone know what time EST she'll appear? 
---
I'm in Australia so +12 EST and wondering if she'll be around when I get home from work or if I won't see her till tomorrow...
---
i feel like such an idiot, thank you so much, this has been bugging me for ages.
---
Tomorrow as in midnight? Or more midday?
---
Wait what?
---
Had this happen last night
---
Finished and got nothing
---
Only happened once, already have my main mods, so *shrugs*
---
Make a bug report on their forums if it keeps happening to you
---
They won’t see it here, however much people think they will
---
It’s as low as you can go, so yeah, it’s good. Caps are easier to come by than large quantities of ammo, especially the popular varieties. I happily pay 1 cap per bullet for 556 and 45, would never pay more.
---
Out of the vending machine 1-1 is good. If you have large quantities and want to sell in trading communities you'll have to do better. There's an unspoken rule that is if you're selling say 5k 5mm for 2k you'll sell a single bullet for 2k and then give the remaining 4999 rounds for free.
---
I would love too but Idk how to share those over reddit 😅
---
even us? 
---
what if you loadednin one day and you were legendary...
---
(wait that could actually be cool)
---
I've been enjoying player vending so I can show off my building skills haha.
---
When did they go back to their forums? I thought they were using the reddit for bug reports (though i did notice i couldnt find the 'bug report' thread earlier) but sure, I'll probably move that way.
---
But you... nevermind.
---
Mate, it's already the 16th for some people
---
Log cabins would be very welcome, as well as those other cabin types you can see at places like Camp Venture.
---
I do very much miss the barn set from Far Harbor, it fit the atmosphere far better than the one we've got in 76 - some things *should* look more "new", like how we shouldn't have all our windows being pre-broken from the instant we craft them, but something about the brightness of that paint is just so off-putting.
---
I was in game with my melee alt and legendary sheepsquatch spawned twice on the trainyard west of Watoga.
---
Since it took like 4-5 mins to kill it with melee, I'd said Deathclaw has zero chance. Deathclaw might do slightly more damage but sheepsquatch is super tanky, while deathclaw dies fairly fast againt melee.
---
I agree. Rail cars, mobile homes, trailer tents.  Trailer RV. All of them.
---
That's what I sell my ammo for as well. I know I dont have a lot of caps, and when you go through a lot of ammo the caps do add up.
---
Check the 3 minute mark on this video:
---
https://youtu.be/ousqHCOa7ys
---
Martial artist makes it repeat the damage effect faster so it’s likely swing speed would do the same. It’s worth putting it side by side with a non-swing speed one to see the difference.
---
Won't be raw if you use the waste oil lol
---
Does anybody know what all plans are obtainable? I got the stingwing, firefly, bloatfly, and tick the first four times I did it but the last few times I'm just getting repeats of those. 
---
Also, the lookout station in behind Dolly Sods if you're lucky will have most of the insects as well sometimes.
---
I can build a red enamel stove in a teammates camp, that's it though.
---
Spiral staircases for me please ^_^
---
No. It stays where I put it. But generally you have to scroll around to land on it.
---
I find the loading time good, when when I see foundation parts or walls near me, I can run further away. If I just stay put, I can get stuck inside stuff.
---
You filthy wasteman you. lol
---
This is part of what I love so much about Fallout 76 being set so early after the war. All the movers and shakers across the country are just getting started movin' and shakin'. Like other Fallout games we'll probably never get to see much more than our little corner of the Wasteland but it's cool to know that this stuff is all going on at the same time we're trying to put the big bad Queen six feet under.
---
a few people dislike the backpack due to it not working in power armor. others because of the grind to get the backpack and decent mods for it.
---
What prevents you from doing it now, laziness? The spawn point is fixed for other player.s
---
Thanks for sharing this. A nice and creepy experience.
---
I got my revive even I didn't notice. I saw a quest of tales telling with a lot of fellow vault dwellers and I fast travel there to see what it is. Then suddenly a lot of enemies pop up and when fighting it. I think I suddenly revived someone which was down right next to me and I saw the quest tracking flashing. :)
---
Cavaliers will help you get close to the enemy but then while you are walking around it offers you no more extra protections so during a melee on melee fight ( pretty common) you get nothing extra out of it.mean while if you stand still and spam melee power attacks and spam crouch (to move your head) then sentinel will still give you its full protection. Sentinels then technically works better with a ranged weapon but it works fine with melee as well. Unyielding is popular with the low hp builds but keep in mind the counter to this meta build is suppressor/%damage reduction builds and be wary of them.
---
The outfit was Atom Shop only. Never found the outfit ingame but you can find the single tinfoil hat
---
The game is fun to play and worth it. It has issues but not like the launch. I bought a copy for friend who is also big fallout fan but wouldn't buy it because of the stories online and he loves it.
---
So, I did some checking online, and apart from the fictitious "lawsuit" from Migliaccio &amp; Rathod there are actually a real lawsuit against Bethesda, over the great canvas bag "scandal".
---
https://www.classaction.org/news/class-action-claims-power-armor-edition-fallout-76-series-west-tek-duffel-bag-falsely-advertised-as-canvas
---
I wonder why nobody links to this real case rather than the joke "investigation"?  Maybe because it is silly.
---
i leave all the doors open it's not like someone would steal my tv and my bed there is nothing special there xd
---
You have no idea
---
My guess is they will activate the content the same time dailies get renewed.
---
It definitely sucks. And it's broken. I made myself do the exams and archery challenge, then said screw the backpack, who cares. I can't even get the campfire tales event to pop up.  I've yet to find a camera from the last asinine update. I've enjoyed having vendor stuff and the legendary machine added to get rid of lower end legendaries, but it's been glitchy and laggy since the last update.
---
What’s her name?
---
I got purifiers, extractor, crops. 
---
Only thing I haven't bothered to deploy, is decontaminaton arch, I have it stored from my previous camp moving. I use sunlight to heal off my own radiation, and don't have normally streched genes on.
---
i still use the missile launcher, if i get ammo from enemies its better then throwing them on the ground :P sure it needs a buff but its relaxing to fire and forget with the targeting computer
---
Damn, never knew these existed. Thanks!
---
I used the half-stairs pretty often with the Warehouse and Barn sets to emulate the look of several of the pre-made warehouses in the game. Along with the flat "upper level" floors, especially the see-through ones made of wire instead of wood, it made for a lot of possibilities with sticking storage areas up above the main space.
---
Wish we could make like 1cap for every 10 ammo.
---
They usually do a bug mega thread when they release a new patch, you’d have to sift through the page to find it though, doubt it’ll still be pinned
---
Just easier to do it on the forum (I know, boo-hiss, official forums)
---
you can't, i built some things for friends but all my atoms shop items are just for my camp exclusively 
---
but i did others things like lettering somethings since they don't want to spend 10k on those plans xd
---
Murmrgh something like that
---
Yeah maybe it's the same Problem... Try to set **all** named items back to standard and keep an eye if it happen again.
---
Several time, I could enter into someone's CAMP room because the walls weren't fully loaded yet. Once inside, I was trapped because all the exit doors were locked.
---
So yeah, minor issues but because of this loading issue, locked doors become irrelevant.
---
Got an AA cryolator with red. Weight. Also got 5 weapons and 1 armor. So i guess its really RNG based.
---
Rad ants regularly spawn at luck hole mine. It's either rad rats, roaches, crickets, or ants. Just server hop until you get ants.
---
Yikes! Good thing I'm so stubborn about being able to use my own camp.
---
Im not really sure about that. My alt has camp right south of Watoga ST, I think it seems fairly good traffic. Often I can collect them, but sometimes I've not been there for a while, and I can't collect much. I have all the crops spread around so that if enemies kill some, I would likely have intact crops on the other side, to collect and repair.
---
What time does that happen again?
---
I think is a good price. Just my $ .02. 
---
Im not a market anlysis, but im way more likely to just grab some ammo from a vendor if its only a buck a piece. Anything more expensive, an youre better off crafting it yourself.
---
It does benefit from both gladiator and iron fist. I literally just tried it. With Iron fist level 3 it’s 261 damage, without the card it’s 217
---
Was referring to destiny 1 when xur sold a exotic launcher 1st or 2nd week then didn't sell it again for ages and everyone said it was not worth getting, but it turned out to be a beast of a launcher which everyone then wanted.
---
Why not post it anyway? Saves me a trip :p
---
Yeah I dislike this aswell. I can pretty much 1 hit anything with my Junkie's Board w/50% damage reflect while blocking. But I follow etiquette and use a less powerful board to tag enemies when there's other players.
---
So the shag carpet is basically a floor tile?  I'm going to have to replace the floors in my domicile.
---
No to removing legacy weapons.
---
Im sure he liked that.
---
Item: *Turns green* 
---
Me: So I can place you now? 
---
Item: Well yes but actually no.
---
i dont mind, i just honestly thought they weren't even checking it anymore.
---
i had a dude in PA appearing only when i claimed various workshop i gtfo of the zone.... i had lost too many junk to waving to strangers in my workshops just to get my ass blasted or one shooted
---
i just wanted to build some resources machines and take some pics for the challenges but that guy was following me
---
u/Ladydevann u/Valseek is there any plans to make the zoom work?
---
They usually go down for maintenance at either 10 or 11am EST. I check Bethesda and Fallouts twitters for updates on downtime and patch notes
---
11am est / 8 am pdt
---
When have updates usually come out?
---
Nice
---
Make sure you look around the surrounding areas for that lingering bug. Sometimes it has completed but without rewards and I experienced that you had to annihilate all bugs in order to truly complete the event
---
You guys are right, I forgot I was out of town over the weekend and didn't get scrip those days.
---
it was for me for a while, but my shop will be empty after the update today lol
---
Oh, I gave up trying to line up my corn long ago.  So long as they all get planted.
---
No i really dont give a single shit because i didn't mean it literally the fact that you went out of your way to search up the meaning of npc's and say it to me is just insane as well as continuously talking like this. You need some therapy, and I dont mean this in any negative way seriously find someone to talk to.
---
Definitely the Traveling Leather Coat and Leather Coat
---
I do this. I found another one too that had me laughing. Find a window and stairs, jump out the window and circuit back that way you keep going in like there’s a lot of people but it’s just you!!!
---
I was like, "WHY THE F\*\*K F\*\*\*NG BETHESDA DIE IN HELL F\*\*\*ING GAME LAGS LIKE S\*\*T WHY U DO THIS TO ME!"
---
Here i see fucking selfish players do that to us, search theyr IP and fucking burn theyir houses!!! DRACARYS!! 
---
PS: this is stupid humor, don't be mad.
---
I actually messaged a guy after a uranium fever event for just this reason.  I don’t care if you want to kill every mob in 1 hit, loot is easy to come by in the game, but he had to unload on everything.
---
It was funny as well because it was right after they changed it so you can’t damage other players at all unless they attack you back and he said he’d come hunt me down but didn’t want to waste the time.
---
I've seen those as well. How much do they usually sell for? In caps I mean?
---
Thanks, I bought it :)
---
Help you fend off the shadows?
---
Gat Lazers are kinda weak already though... I've never even picked them up, but you're right about the demo perk not being there, and the explosive prefix being nerfed. 
---
as for being kinda strong: My personal AAE GPlasma is the only weapon where I can pull the trigger and watch the SBQ's healthbar decline on a steady tick, whether the others are firing or not. Dunno if its the card setup or what, but im not really maxing anything. just a nice combo of level 1 and 2 cards.
---
I’d say the bomber jacket or the hunters long coat
---
that's cuz you skipped class
---
They used to be worth 20-25k but now they go for around 5-8k
---
I see. Dang, BSG really really wants that money lmao. Ya hate to see it but it’s a business.
---
I’m on now if u want
---
What do Bomber Jackets go for?
---
I have no idea
---
Nah, same, they seem like more trouble than they're worth. I'm constantly having to pop radaway due to Ghoul attacks so I figure I'd end up wiping away my own mutation more often than not anyway.
---
Pink and yellow asylum outfits not hats. Cowboy outfits. Tattered field jacket. The whitesprings and white powder jumpsuits. Responder fireman outfit. Yellow fisherman and longcoat are the rare clothes. Idk that theres much rare headgear. There may be other outfits but those are the ones ive seen people looking for though not sure how much value they currently hold.
---
Thank you for your help
---
If there’s an extra hook on PS4 there’s an extra hook on XBOX.  It’s not console related lol.
---
wow dude chillout not everyone aced those electrical engineering exams u know? i can barely clean my weapon without shooting my feet
---
If you find one can you let me know which vendor?
---
I never voted in a poll because im not a crybaby and i thought there was no way they could make it worse. But if you want to play completely unmolested stay in adventure and keep pacifist on , leave survival alone they cant cater to marshmallows in both modes .
---
This is glorious. XD lol fun read.
---
They are not sold at vendors, you can only get them by depositing technical data for the BOS thing. It’s a random drop
---
I'm on XB1. Are you able to help?
---
Twice in 4 days.  And try 120 items.  All 4 machines.  It hurt so much.
---
I appreciate your honesty either way man 😆
---
Hah.  I started an Encryptid event just to do this.  Only one person went down and someone else revived them.
---
The event succeeded though -- orbital strike beacons are great.
---
Great.  More tech farming to do.  😥
---
Where are you trying to set up on the map?
---
While we're at it let's bring the rest back, too - the missing floor pieces from the Warehouse and Barn sets, as well as the roof platforms for those sets. Loved being able to put a walkway on top of the building.
---
angled foundations/walls
---
you can do some trick but i need a large wall for building purposes xd
---
Had one, it did not, sold it back in january
---
&gt; I happily pay 1 cap per bullet for 556 and 45, would never pay more.
---
The .45, 5.56 and shotgun shells sell well for me. Makes sense.
---
just remember, it cannot be used in power armor. and if the damage bug still exists then Bethesda will eventually get around to fixing it
---
The barrel fire has to be a bug, right? Campfires give off a proper red / orange glow, but the barrel fire looks like it's coming from a weak LED.
---
I hope you're opening chess tournaments for survivors,
---
Make em pay 100 caps entry and then you move the pieces for them.
---
Get em to tell you what piece to move and where. Could be a fun interaction, I'd swing by anyway!
---
It’s ok I’ve got a backup plan.
---
Consdiering the ammo vendor cost more, yes as long as it's normal ammo. Don't undersell yourself on missiles, mini-nukes or fancy ammo.
---
That's some good info, but we wiped EVERYTHING. at the time, we were looking for ant meat for Rad Ant Lager, so we were coming the ground and the meat piles for anymore we could get our hands on. went all around that place!
---
And switching them should only be available out of combat.
---
Sorry I misunderstood your question. They do not drop from the technical data thing
---
Stuttering when opening the map, when switching weapons, when firing an explosive weapon, when cooking, and more. Crashing when entering certain interiors that seem to last until the next day. Crashing when fighting SBQ. Crashing when fighting the Sheepsquatch. Crashing when I'm seconds away from completing a daily quest.
---
I will say, this is bringing back nostalgia to the pain/joy of Daggerfall. 70% of the time enjoying an amazing game. 30% of the time reloading the program.
---
Same lol
---
I GOT YOU BRO! Try Fred's BBQ Shack, near Top of the world! There's ALWAYS 3 of them!
---
I'd love that glass trailer tent from the airport.
---
Honestly I dont ever expect them to fully fix crashes/freezes, considering their past fallouts as well
---
I've had luck at the BBQ shack.
---
I constantly get into combat with green thumb instead of rifleman, chemist instead of first aid, ammosmith for covert operative, super duper for bloody mess.
---
Then i wonder why i cant 2 shot most things like i used to... 5 mins later i remember to switch everything back and spend 2 mins doing so each time.
---
The BBQ Shack in the Savage Divide. Just South East of Top of the World. Place Is crawling with them 24x7.
---
I got 5 possum badges from doing the event so MANY times, it definitely takes a lot of patience :/
---
Well I'm currently on the mountain east of Whitespring but I'd like to move somewhere else. It doesn't really matter where but if possible I'd like to be somewhere around the center of the map to keep fast traveling prices low. An ore or junk deposit or water aren't needed but would be welcome.
---
I'm also big on turning off all the lights. I broke into a person's place the other night, turned off all the lights as normal then I found them sleeping in their bed.  I stripped naked and started playing the piano. When he got out of bed and saw me he immediately logged out.
---
I didn't need to search it up because I am not an idiot.
---
Bomber jacket not rare. People sell them in vending machines for few caps. Probably because it spawn same place where BoS PA skins and people farmed skins, but kept getting Bomber Jackets.
---
I do the same, aside from the handful of black powder rounds I keep for back up, and the 5mm I use, every single round I get goes into my vending machine at 1cap each. Some ammo sells slow, but 556 and 45 go quick, as does shotgun shells. I make more money from selling ammo at 1ea than selling aids or legendaries, or anything else for that matter.
---
That’s great 😂
---
A few ammo, yes; some not even close.
---
I think its pretty clear that bulk pricing is direly needed.
---
If you’re on Xbox I’ll buy all your magazines
---
Thanks for the replies. I will try there next time I’m on
---
This everything about this is just wonderful.
---
[](/angrytia)Just some math for you: The Dragon shoots four 200dmg shots with *no* perks totaling 800, then you add in perks adding 60% bonus for 1280DMG, then you add in instigating for double damage that's 2560DMG, and then you add in Adrenal Reaction at low health for another %50 boost that's 2840DMG, and then you add in Psychobuff for another 25% boost bringing it to 4800DMG, then you chug a Ballistic Bock for another 15% to make it 5520DMG, and then you shoot it as a Vats Critical for an additional 200% with Better Critical's 40% Eagle Eyes 25% Blight soup's %20 bonuses:  
---
***That's 15732DMG on a one star legendary that's NOT legacy,*** and also not counting the additional effective damage buff you could get with Tank killer, and I forgot the 15% from bloody mess, and another 10% could have come from explosive that could also have been boosted with Demolitions Expert.  
---
Now tell me about the OP pew pew laser that means I need to get rid of my favorite explosive flamer from the beta that can't even kill a level 10 Grafton Monster faster than a gatling.
---
Well, yep. All that for any extra 60 carry? But it's the journey, right?
---
I thought it was romantic...
---
Directly East of Bolton Greens are 2 distinct cabins,  readily available to C.A.M.P &amp; easily defended. May be a good starting point for your needs.
---
Bethesda has already ground my patience thin. But im glad you're able to at least get it to work somewhat.
---
I don't want that, Jesus Christ, how many times do I have to say that. I've always wanted unrestricted pvp and didn't even buy the game till survival came out. I hate how people complained that pvp was griefing, I'm not one of those people, I just want changes to the leaderboard.
---
I literally turned off my console many, many times after thinking I SURELY earned a badge
---
Make sure you have camera film in your inventory.
---
So would you say sentinel is just better overall
---
in the event of no ways inside, you can always deploy a power armor inside through their window and then hop in
---
Thanks, I'll take a look when I get home!
---
............................... WHAT?!?
---
I made a d@mn checklist to make sure I got them all from player vendors. I am, like, 5 shy of having all of them.
---
This displeases me greatly. I am greatly displeased.
---
... Although I did wonder why reading an Unstoppables issue didn't register as progress; I figured I'd just have to possess the entire collection to get credit.
---
Dammitdammitdammitdammitdammitdammit.
---
I was hunting g for one to try and managed to get a two shot but my God it was like a bb gun.
---
Bro, you ain't lying. If it werent for the fact my wife really likes 76, I'd have already deleted it again. Not worth it.
---
I have a toilet blueprinted with "poop here" written on it. If people accept my team invite, they get a base full of toilets. Alternatively, I may just have to build a house full of windows and toilets and lock the door, then write "no pooping" above the door.
---
every day this sub spouts something completely misguided about pvp. it's like clockwork at this point.
---
-explosive-anything in pvp is completely useless thanks to fireproof and the dense mod, which any remotely decent pvper will have equipped. there's a reason everybody is switching to FFR. their only purpose is to stagger sentinels, so by removing them from the game you're actually only making an even op-er prefix stronger.
---
-shotguns have hair trigger mods and the combat has an auto one. and although yes, their RoF is nowhere near that of a laser rifle (even though a QE DB can get close), they shoot more pellets than the beam splitter mod. and speaking of which, laser rifles break fast, extremely fast. the beam splitter multiples that by 5. so you'll have to carry multiple, or a ton of repair kits. either way they're less than reliable.
---
-duping will never be truly patched. even before the recent mess up, sellers were getting their supply *somewhere*. where do you think that is?
---
the point is that legacy weapons or not, you can't jump into pvp wearing excavator and weight perks and expect to be even remotely successful. explosive laser rifles are only particularly useful against sentinels/cavaliers, which is a valid counter. against everything else, you're better off using a different weapon. like a combat shotgun or a handmade.
---
That's a great idea! When I tried placing items under the glitched objects it said the space was occupied. I'll try next time I'm on and let you know, thanks
---
Yeah same. The UI isn’t super intuitive in this case. Have fun!
---
Well somehow i can't lock my small purifiers :)
---
Sorry, I must have search wrong. Nothing came up for me.
---
When you have way many things to 1hit.
---
Ok that actually makes sense. Great idea
---
Launching a nuke completes the main storyline. If you didn't hit fissure prime with it you'll get an additional holotape from the Overseer, but that's about it for the main story atm. From there it's only the DLC content for new quests.
---
It is not game changer. Yes, first time you get to roll multiple time, but later on you get to roll only 150 scrip worth, that is nothing more than getting one free SBQ a day and that only after you have collected 150 scrip. If you can do 5 SBQ and it doesn't have affect, the 1 won't for sure. You would need to roll over 1000 times to get what you need and that is only if you are after ranged weapons. That is 3 years worth of rolling.
---
It saddens me about this.
---
I send randos invites every so often, but it's usually to give them workshops! 
---
When I log out I don't like leaving Poseidon/Thunder Mountain powered up with no one to benefit from the work I put into it, so I'll invite someone to join a team, and give them it! The last time I did this I gave someone Poseidon The scrap heap and Mount Blair. 
---
With an artillery network to boot! 
---
morale of the story, if you get an invite from anderssec you're about to get some pretty sweet workshops!
---
You need to nuke the bottem right corner of the Map with the Fissure Site Prime to spawn the Queen and kill her. After that you are basically done with the main story like everyone else.
---
Overall it is better due to the ways that the damage reduction is applied. You get more out of sentinel than cavalier due to just what you do. You can’t sprint and shoot/attack as it Interupts the sprint but you can defiantly stand still and still get damage reduction for this. Tbh it’s easier to get the power armor chest piece mod (emergency systems?) if your a bloodied build as it just reduces all damage by 50% all the time when your below 20% hp which is your goal anyway. This would also give you more DR and ER and RR all around but you loose out on Str and Agi from unyielding that’s nice. Make up for this with the arm mods that make power attacks better and then the legs that wither give carry weight or make sprinting better (using less AP then as you have less ap vs unyielding) and the head of your choice. I’ve destroyed bloodied unyielding builds not in pa this way with guns or melee.
---
Mexico was invaded in 2051, although not officially annexed like Canada, so that would technically bring down the 'not in the US' barrier that fallout games seem to have in regards to setting.
---
PS4 sorry
---
I’ve got a max lvl instigating MH with mod attached for sale if interested
---
Making posts like this will almost guarantee you get mass downvoted by the dupers and people who benefit from the dupers(pretty much everyone). Most of them don't care about balance, the economy or the game's future. They just want to have their overpowered crap.
---
Bethesda hasn't said anything about downtime for the Purveyor so we should be meeting Mama Murmrgh sometime around 9-10 am Pacific time (about 12-1 Eastern) when the Daily challenge resets.
---
&gt; I actually like when I come home to my camp and see all the doors open - it means they checked out the whole thing instead of just beelining for my vending machine.
---
While I do agree that I like knowing people are curious and check everything out, I wish they'd close the door after looking in my bathroom. There's a Sheepsquatch on the toilet, for heaven's sake.
---
He just used one of the tall light poles. Needs animations though, for now its just a bunch of crouching, standing, and emotes near it.
---
I run the rejuvinated perk. So water is always important fir me. That being said, i leave my 2 purifiers unlocked for others.
---
I can start a game session with 20 and end with 50, even with my high usage of water.
---
So i never saw it as a problem. If it ever becomes one ill just build another purifier at the back hidden from view and lock it.
---
Why didn't I think of this?! That's so much easier than waiting around and hoping someone needs a revive sometime.
---
addendum: anti-armor doesn't work with energy weapons. on top of that, grounded is a free +100 ER. and thanks for the aforementioned fireproof + dense, you're essentially relying on the energy damage alone, which is laughable compared to ballistic. the explosive bonus, by definition, doesn't work properly with energy weapons either. if you don't believe me compare an explosive gatling laser with other heavy weapons. it deals roughly 50% of the damage.
---
Cuts my load times by 1/3 to 1/2
---
Was a good investment to me
---
Oooooo I gotta remember that. Thanks!
---
It's okay :) I'm just happy the concept is at least getting sttention. No need to apologize! SPREAD IT.
---
In pvp wouldn't a player in power armor take like only 2-3 rads per shot because of the high rad resistance?
---
This is freaking awesome. I feel inspired to do the same now. 🤣😂🤣😂
---
Oh yeah, I built a sweet cargo container house in FO4. I actually plan to build one IRL someday, too.
---
I can't speak too much to the Xbox version, but I have an SSD and a HDD in my PC and the load times are still ridiculous even after moving the game to the solid state. I have solid internet as well. I think in this case it may just be the nature of the beast. The initial load-in from the main menu is especially long, with area transitions being a little bit better.
---
I have been trying to do the relog and kill everything at that location but it just was taking for ever and I would spend more time loading then I would playing and looting.
---
I made a camp based off of the train stations in the game called Sheepsquatch Station. It's populated by a large amount of Sheepsquatch plush.
---
I've gotten quite a bit of positive feedback via messages from visitors. If you're interested in taking a look, send me your gamertag and I'd be happy to give you a tour.
---
i have also read about those things not working, but my AAE GPlasma has always been better than any other heavy weapon i use (and i use them all as a main). Its become so reliable that I've stopped using my TS50Cal and Gatling Guns. 
---
Dunno what im doing wrong, but im not doing pvp either...
---
I want one of those IRL lol
---
Gatling plasma is normal and legit, I believe. And I’m not angry with the people who got theirs legitimately, only those duped/bought duped.
---
Lmfao bro I built my base at the top of Seneca Rocks so if I log out at my base then I spawn in &amp; fall to the rocks below 👍🏼 fortunately I don’t actually take any damage ever I just somehow break my legs &amp; maintain all my HP😂
---
From this point forward, every update will be sub par until this is implemented.
---
Every.
---
Update.
---
Where do i enter my email address so i can subscribe to your newsletter?
---
Have you ever wished you didn't say something specific in public? I assume you have at least one time.
---
Let me make this clear: I do NOT want to remove explosive from the game. I want the duped weapons removed.
---
Yes but I have the mod I could give them if they were on xbox, but they arent. Woosh.
---
Bruh moment 🗿
---
Thanks to player vending, i now realised mine is a chicken coop
---
If they ever add a live event on just like fortnite has them  where the brother hood of steal fly there zepplin over west verginia and starts new quests they dont have to stay they could run away when they sea the sbq or the scorched plauge
---
I was just complaining earlier about this also I want to be able to change my HUD color like I could in Fallout 4.. the stale, dull yellow makes me wanna go to bed not grind. I want my red back :-/
---
I've experience that some bloatfly went as far as the lookout and down the slopes. Try to use VATS to check all around.
---
You probably unlocked it for arms or legs, although there's also a helmet paint. Scrapping any part can unlock mods for any other part, which is why it's standard to craft light arms.
---
I had like 5 yellow and 5 pink asylum outfits ages ago and just sold them to vendors lol how silly
---
dear god no, that sounds incredibly obnoxious.
---
Ty brotha I will try the arms🙏🏻
---
Ok i know I’m asking a lot but what would you do if you was a non Bloodied build like what armor would you use because I’m actually a heavy gunner build I just started to get out my PA more because of the backpacks that’s why I been using the Bloodied Mole Miner Gauntlet
---
what makes this somehow better than a deathclaw gauntlet
---
Simple duping fix - and proposes a pivotal change to game economy.
---
I'm coming to conclusion that before any suggestions are published, authors should finish test of game and world knowledge, so that suggestions which would cause hundreds of further issues don't spam the feed.
---
Yeh no Gallaghorn being sold my Mur lol
---
This benefits from the barbarian cards and the Iron Fist cards. It’s possibly a glitch
---
Seems like, unlike many, you are not an idiot. Keep it up please.
---
Enclave yes, Brotherhood no. This is before Arthur Maxson decided to say every mutant is an enemy or whatever. This is still the time period in which the Brotherhood had Ghoul members.
---
This explains why the unstoppables 2 I bought does not check mark my challenge, thank you for the info.
---
&gt;fireproof and the dense mod
---
Yeah all you need to succeed is a handful of RNG dependent legendary effects and mods that you are near impossible to find.
---
I think it’s something that unlocks at a certain time without server downtime. Like what happened when the Burrows opened up, only saying so because I haven’t seen any mention of downtime
---
Link to this glorious place.
---
Thanks for the warning, I was out the airport at level 5 last time I logged out.
---
that sounds like a glitch, yeah.
---
it also sounds annoying, because if you're using all of those, you wont be able to use incisor cards, or the one that reduced melee damage.
---
not sure if that's worth it, honestly.
---
I can see her health going down with ultracite Gatling laser with ultracite ammo.  Zero legendary effects of any kind.
---
TSE Assassin Sentinel is obsolete meta from five months ago. Inarguably, almost noone understands this game, and those who do, do so only a little.
---
Really nice, did you do it in your personal camp or in a station?
---
A Voltaire, a Socrates for the modern era.
---
Why not? I have incisor level 3, iron fist level 3, expert gladiator level 2 and regular gladiator level 2 all equipped. Which one reduces melee damage?
---
there's no practical difference between duped and real rolls. they function the same. so what you're saying that you're ok with being mowed down by legacy lasers- so long the people doing the mowing spent hundreds of hours farming for it?
---
that actually makes sense to you? wow.
---
&gt;Second, I’m not doing PVP. I’m just trying to the play the game, and I’d prefer not to be killed before I can even react by a fast fire rate nightmare gun.
---
then turn pacifist on and don't take over workshops? not to mention, if it wasn't lasers, then it would be handmades. or combat rifles. or even assault ones. it's the same with the sen/cav, even after the nerf everyone complaining about it continued to be bodied by everyone in pvp. literally nothing changed.
---
so maybe, just maybe, they're the problem, not the gear.
---
The advanced weapons is just to make the game more fun. Otherwise you'd be playing with only spears and slingshots. There is an artistic style that the game has and there are gameplay mechanics. That's also why many of the guns don't look brand new, but they contain rusty spots and else.
---
Fallout is pretty generous with putting stuff in it's game that seems to be out of place. That is the game's charm. So those couple of single times that you do enter a very clean environment feels special. It would just feel weird though if you walk around a wasteland but seeing everybody building clean nice houses.
---
[](/angrytia)Just some math for you: The Dragon shoots four 200dmg shots with *no* perks totaling 800, then you add in Rifleman perks adding 60% bonus for 1280DMG, then you add in Bloody Mess for another 15% that's 1472DMG, and then you add in Adrenal Reaction at low health for another %50 boost that's 2208DMG, and then you add in Psychobuff for another 25% boost bringing it to 2760DMG, then you chug a Ballistic Bock for another 15% to make it 3174DMG, and then you shoot it as a Vats Critical for an additional 200% with a VATS critical legendary effect %50 Better Critical's 40% Eagle Eyes 25% Blight soup's %20 bonuses for 10632DMG, then you add in instigating for double damage that's:  
---
***21265DMG on a two star legendary that's NOT legacy,*** and also not counting the additional effective damage buff you could get with Tank killer. Even with the full effect of a whole set of Assassins Sentinel's Heavy Metal armor with a max ranked Dodgy, Bullet Shield, Barbarian at 20str, Ironclad, Bodyguards with a full team, Nerd Rage, Evasive, and Junk Shield: 3856DMG would leak through. Your only hope would be a Serendipity proc to have a chance against this VATS guaranteed hit.  
---
I loved that gally until if got nerfed to oblivion lol destiny 1 still my fave out of 1 and 2. When will mur arrive i work nights. So will have to wait til 2moro to visit her unless she comes at 10am  like xur used to in the tower lol.
---
but i dont use ultracite at all :c Just regular plasma cores. 
---
the gun has a 3rd legendary effect, but i cant recall what it is off the top of my head.
---
Fireproof is a card actually.
---
Difference is that if rebar triggers, it stops the incoming damage and reflects it all back. 
---
Reactive doesn’t stop the incoming, only reflects a portion but apparently does effect ranged.
---
An ingame test with a before and after current AP comparison with fast button presses. Vats &gt; shoot once &gt; cancel vats &gt; open pipboy. I use controller so its literally left bumper &gt; right trigger &gt; B &gt; B. I did several tests to confirm I was pressing buttons fast enough.
---
huh, i did go over to the lookout, but i didnt think to look off the cliff. I'll keep that in mind if my wife makes me drag this game out again.
---
I think if you invite people to your team they can move your cannot pieces around. He could just join up with the competitors and have them go at it.
---
Dense mod isn't.
---
gatling plasmas since the buff are now one of the best heavy guns in the game rivaling the .50 cal and also the new and improved LMG. and that's without stabilized doing anything for armor penetration because, like I said, AA simply does not work with energy weapons.
---
It frustrates me that super mutants can shoot up my camp before it even loads in - it happens to me all the time!
---
If you aren't melee, is there any point using those 2 unyielding? As I see, +6 endurance is the most beneficial and then +6 agi, but does it outweigh another +70 DR/ER that you could get if you replaced it with another 2 bolstering items
---
Since we are all the best and the brightest, I expected to have this skill as well!
---
or maybe by people like me, who know these posts are misguided and simply wrong.
---
Right, well the legacy weapons (only the laser rifles btw, I don’t care about the others.) are being duped, causing an over saturation. 
---
And if the item was still legitimate to get, I’d complain less. But it’s been removed to be gotten. If you spent hours farming for it, fine. I’ll gripe about the damage, but I care more about the over-saturation of the market.
---
Hell no boy!
---
It's not a fucking Sims, it's a post-apocalyptic game. Bethesda already put a lot of stuff that doesn't match with post war environment (like a death claw bush, fish lamp etc, wtf really) and you want more. It's disgusting.
---
At least they've added sculls on spikes and I hope they'll continue work in that derection.
---
I had one and sold it. I never used it because it's too inaccurate for long range, and the splash damage was annoying at short range. I didn't care for respeccing into endurance to get the fireproof perk. Get yourself an Anti Armor 50 cal, those things shred.
---
She mostly use melee because her aim is very good without V.A.T.S and no we play on PS4
---
yeah i use stabilized 2 and Tenderizer and Suppressor along with One gun Army for stun and Bullet Deflector. Its tanky AF. They buffed LMG? Still cant craft enough .308 for it!
---
are you joking? fireproof is a mod and I literally bought my dense mod.
---
I'll go door to door for signatures, if need be. We're in this for the hard, long push, brother.
---
Yeh I live in Australia so I gotts wait till tomorrow after work unless it opens in middle of night I might jump on
---
which has no bearing in pvp mechanics? are you even listening to yourself? you're making less and less sense.
---
even if literally every single person was handled an explosive laser rifle upon leaving vault 76, they're still far from op.
---
Write it in any public restroom, anywhere. In fact, write it in every bathroom you visit. I'll find you. Do not contact anyone else until I do.
---
Please explain. Most people just leave their downvote and run.
---
Good luck friend hope rngesus blesses you well🤞👍
---
Love it.
---
It is, cause fire is diying relatively fast, you get out of wood and some fucking noob will pull it far away so you fail even, just because everyone wanted level 15 legendary. Congratz for your wood armor. Now guys must do another event for last badge.
---
Like a back-to-back wartime combat poop. They don't show those in the movies. Wait, they did once. That's where I got that from.
---
are you talking about the mods for the raider armor? because its the base ones I can't find, such as raider legs, arms, etc. the only one i have is a chest piece.
---
any news on the time of release?
---
Fuckin’ parrots and your garbage “look at me I’m trendy &amp; copy dumb shit” posts.
---
Please delete yourself.  :)
---
AA.  Executioners has a role in PVP vs Bloodied builds.
---
Some men speak because they have to say something. Some men speak because they have to poop.
---
Ah, sorry, yes the mods...I thought that was what you were after .
---
Sometimes you can find them at nightclubs.  Generally speaking, the more you drink the more foxes you will meet.
---
yeah it's the base ones I can't find, like anywhere, in fact i think the only way i got the raider chest was scrapping but I dont remember.
---
It drops a weak, low level legendary. I’d rather have the event complete
---
it’s not a big deal unless level 15 one stars are all you want, because that’s exactly what you’ll get. in events like uranium fever and awol armaments i agree but not the new event unless there’s a level 10 who hasnt gotten their first legendary yet
---
60 carry weight is still great
---
Ah, Meat Hooks.  I fell in love with my first legendary, a 1 star Troubleshooters.  I still use it at the AWOL Armaments event.  All Meat Hooks are badass.  I have like 12 of them, use most of them and only 2 are more than 1 star.  They do seem to be somewhat elusive.
---
As for the plan for the hook, I got it from a Mirelurk Queen I think.  The extra claw 'plan' does not exist afaik.  I had to look for a regular meat hook to scrap to learn the extra claw mod.  
---
I spent a couple days looking for a plain meat hook and finally found one at the Morgantown Airport vendor. Lucked out and learned the mod on my first scrap.  This was months ago so who knows, but I've seen them sporadically at other vendors since then.
---
If you are on XB I could make you one, but won't be on until tomorrow latenight.
---
Tattered field jacket 5-8k 
---
Tattered mole mask &amp; outfit 5-10k 
---
Longshoreman outfit and slicker hat 2k
---
Winter jacket and jeans 800-1200
---
Grey fisherman overalls 1k
---
Fisherman’s overalls 1k (not to be confused with fisherman’s outfit) 
---
Leather coat &amp; leather traveling coat 5-8k
---
Imposter sheepsquatch outfit 8-10k 
---
Western outfits 1-1.5k
---
Responders fireman outfit 10-12k 
---
There’s probably more but that’s all I could think of atm.
---
Also I’m sure everyone has found these items cheaper or traded for them. These are just prices I see regularly from vendors and the market.
---
Again, do what you want but what makes that worth 9000 caps?
---
So does AA 😂
---
I just did a couple posts up: https://old.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/bp8eoq/lets_talk_about_the_explosive_laser_rifles/enq2oib/
---
Scrip
---
Aww man really? Well damn that sucks, can't get lots of damage out of it unless it's semi-automatic or bolt action then. Well I guess thx for telling me!
---
Thanks for your help man. It's greatly appreciated. You ever hear anything about Clean Spacesuit set, Responders Police Uniform &amp; Hat &amp; a wool fisherman's hat? I found a wool fisherman's hat for the first time last week and I've been playing almost daily since the beta. Just thought that was weird not seeing one after 6 months of playing everyday.
---
This so much. I was playing with someone earlier and their base amazing. Mine? It’s a wooden box. And the roof has a hole in it.
---
Hey. You still on?
---
No sorry I just hoped if but I’ll be on this time tomorrow
---
&gt;All of the vault 111 dwellers, including the SS, are still frozen
---
Tbh that made me think at first that there's just a bunch of nazi's frozen alongside you in the vault before I realised the SS in this example actually stands for Sole Survivor.  
---
Tbh a fourth Reich in the wasteland would make for an interesting antagonist I'm sure.
---
Had this exact issue with a glowing ant in Fort Defiance. Leaving and switching servers removed the mob and the problem. I wish you luck and may your travels be immortal-mongrel free.
---
It is a conspiracy to get our money, but they will never find my money, it is covered in tin foil. Is a bit of a problem to use a credit card, ever tried using one covered in foil.
---
weird I thought energy weapons couldn't use aa
---
Not sure I'd call an assultron bulky, specially to her face!
---
I believe crafting ultracite .308 is actually cheaper so it's good for priming. but yeah, the ammo and the drum size are still huge disadvantages.
---
although, when it comes to dps, it shreds every other heavy weapon. but the .50 cal is still overall better for daily use.
---
It is the first time I ever knowing it have bonuses, but it's a weapon that having 'vs Human' bonus but vs players? It must be very useful in the Appalachia lol
---
I’ll post after work what I’m running as I’m on mobile right now so it will be a few hours.
---
I'm still yet to find the camera quest in game so anything requiring taking photos I can't do
---
Essentially you have to hope someone drops a nuke down south and starts the Scorched Earth event. You could probably knock that out in 1 or 2 photos there. Did it yesterday but was unlucky and only got 5 marked off.
---
be lucky to get 4k for the imposter outfit now...forest and red asylum unifirms in my experience are rarer than the other colours too
---
Ok cool
---
Completely agree, kills seems by far the best option.
---
Awesome post! The guys in r/falloutlore have a lot of posts similar to these posts and love to talk about as the title suggest the entire lore of the series. Check it out sometime, I love to read the posts and put together a nice timeline of it all!
---
Also interested so commenting if you don’t mind
---
Clean sets usually fetch a decent amount but it’s really about finding the right person looking for it. 
---
The rest you mentioned is common stuff. You’ve just been unlucky with getting there before someone else. 
---
Clean space set 800
---
Wrapped cap goes with tattered jacket
---
Clean straight jacket 500
---
Bomber jacket 300-500 
---
Again pricing is really just guidelines you could easily undercut and sell quick or hold out and make a few more. 
---
Someone bought a green rag hat off me for 500 once
---
Thank you for the response. My GT is Atomic Punk 152.
---
I'm on late also (don't sleep very well, lol). My Gt is Atomic Punk 152. Thanks for the response.
---
I'm not trying to find how much I can get necessarily. More like trying to figure out how they stack up as far as caps value and the demand for them. That way I can maybe use them to swing a deal in my favor on trades for other items.
---
Why place any restrictions at all
---
Considering every time i dont get any hits on the legendary, I \*never\* get a badge... (not saying getting a hit guarantee a badge but not hitting seems to guarantee not getting one)
---
And waiting a second or two for others to register where it is before meeleeing it to death when the fire is at full bar isn't a huge ask.
---
yeah, coz they totally don't give any script at the train station for the purveyor later today...
---
Thank you for the response. Looking forward to explore with someone from the UK. MY GT is Atomic Punk 152.
---
Game is early access they say
---
You know what we need? A weekly CAMP of the week post.
---
I totally don't understand this post.
---
Will have to look you up Goblinite. My GT is Atomic Punk 152. Thanks for the response.
---
Yeah it's not going to be good. If you do something like that with PayPal, they will close your account.  
---
But you won't find out for a couple of weeks. It takes time to process the dispute. Good luck
---
I have never had the fire go out. I have never even seen it below 1/4 full.
---
And if you consider that dying fast you and I have very different opinions of fast.
---
Also, you can pick up kindling constantly after the kindling part of the quest comes up, as it keeps re-spawning. So if you can't manage to keep it lit, you deserve to fail.
---
Tattered mole outfit is semi rare but not worth 5-10k.  I have 3 sets; 1 for my own use.  I'll be selling each for 20 caps.  They spawn regularly so sorry pal but that's really high
---
Will do. My GT is Atomic Punk 152. Thanks for the response.
---
Thanks man, it wouldn’t even be a problem but the timing was just so bad it’s caused huge issues at home to the point where instead of being able to go out and get groceries for the kids yesterday, I had to spend all day at the bank and on the phone with Microsoft trying to get hundreds of dollars in fees and shit reversed. Luckily I was able to transfer money from my emergency fund and grab up some things to last until Friday. This is such a clusterfuck and if I get banned on top of everything I’ll be so upset
---
Hello HollowRoxyJon. My GT is Atomic Punk 152. Thanks for the response.
---
I miss the old patch I would of removed those pesky walls
---
Gotta love that "Disconnected From Server" issue. My GT is Atomic Punk 152. Thanks for the response.
---
Exact reason why I always use my tesla or smg for the event.
---
Responder Fireman is rare? I've had one sitting in my stash for a while because I'm a hoarder of clothes. I guess I should look into selling it lol
---
me trying to sneak on enemy: **[DETECTED] The enemy heard you fart and found you by smell** geez thx sugar bombs

This one camp, across from WS station is absolutely insane. Inside the ceiling is three stories high and completely open. 
---
I’ve seen camps with bedrooms and bathrooms, living rooms that looked out over a deck that hangs over a bluff; all decorated beautifully. 
---
Thank god for day-tripper.
---
Had this happen to me 3 days ago, lost alot of stablized flux
---
Uh dude you got the year the master would consume his first victim wrong, 60 years after Fallout 76 is when the master gets killed by the Vault Dweller
---
Couldn't you just server hop? That's what I do when I have an event that I just can't kill for anything.
---
980-990 I think, I have more just saving it for Vendor release.
---
For real, 100% same.
---
Possum exams are a lot easier than tadpoles imo.
---
Probably between 10am and noon est
---
Being able to change it without nodding on PC would be nice too.
---
Couldn’t you get another player to build one side, mark the pieces with letters and actually play a full game of chess?
---
Yeah it sucks. Happened to be 2 days ago. Had to drink rad ant lager just to be able to fast travel. Then server crashes and i lose my stuff. I know i had good stuff, but don't recall specifics other than 400 plastic i had just purchased off vending machine :(
---
Funny thing is I've seen a glowing deathclaw change name to scorched glowing deathclaw after a scorchbeast does the acid attack flyby. Vs a megasloth though far away enough they lose interest and this megasloth randomly encountered didn't budge from his spot, and it seems if the megasloth or w/e creature is already diseased and the scorchbeast is not diseased on the other hand, it won't work.
---
I'll definitely have to try that method sometime on stingwings.
---
It's 3AM EST US, so it seems not anywhere close to midnight.
---
The Atomic shop has a rolling counter in hours (check the deals). Mine currently says 8 hours.
---
I think that's when she will appear. :(
---
Is it mean their or Microsoft's system do think it's four orders with four Order IDs? It's a bad system then :&lt;
---
Anyway, the best solution is still contacting the Bethesda, since they are the end corp of the payment, it's most easy if they just reject your order and it will naturally refunded to you, but if you claim you didn't paid the money, pull the money before the end corp, they will be unable to reject it since it never being finished(they credited the atoms to users first then take the money), it basically is the most dangerous thing to do and usually end badly though, although if they accepted it's a accident, they will still reject the order for you unhappily I guess, most corps hates to being contact because users reclaim their payments
---
I leave one locked and one open.  And then there's all the crops around.
---
Check the youtuber "Jug". He is a Master of FO building.
---
It literally shows 5pm Gmt Dec 31 for me.
---
Thing is, I’ve tried contacting EVERYONE and they have done nothing but send me in a circle “go talk to X” then I go talk to X and X says “Go talk to Y” then I go to Y and Y says “Go talk to Z!” Then I go to Z! And Z says “You’ll need to go talk to X” and the system repeats over and over
---
You're doing the wrong quest if you're legendary farming for Purveyor. If you want any trash legendary for scrip you should probably do something like the cattle herding (2x 1 stars usually) or even uranium fever.
---
I had a Behemoth spawn at Bogtown the other day...I should've kited it over to the nearby MQ....would've been fun to watch.
---
Entirely dependent on your characters STR, Mutations etc.
---
But basically, add +2 Str to that then +100lbs carry weight.
---
This post is just taking up my feed move along
---
An SSD makes a very noticeable improvement. Well worth it IMO. As said by someone else, load times are cut in half or even more, a third, of what they previously were. I get about 10-13 seconds per loading screen
---
This is well and truly the most pure and literal example of a **quality shit post** this sub will likely ever see.
---
I've sent you a message, sounds good
---
I spent almost all of my caps on the Brick Building set just so I can have a respectable camp when people visit. Now I'm going to have to relocate and rebuild the whole thing because I have to get the hang of the Advanced Wiring plans I got as well. "Wall pass-through" my butt.
---
When you notice all the dots converge on that single point :)
---
Thanks for the suggestion, I'll take a look!
---
Nice story!
---
Yeah, everyone flipped out afound herd that they wete pulling the prequels out of their asses and completely ruined the continuity.
---
I mean maybe not in your group of friends but for the majority of people hated the prequels for ruining the original 3:

---
I was in your server! It took me a second to realize what you made, but when I did I went nuts. Good job man!
---
No one cares about your camp.
---
It looks just like everyone elses with the same decorations &amp; monkey see monkey do layout.
---
I am actually after badges, the script merely makes it slightly more worth it. and as i noted in my other reply to someone else, if I don't get any hits on the legendary, i never get a badge. could be co-incidence, might not be. not exactly like there is an odds table for chances of getting a badge from it.
---
Best buy i ever did in Destiny...
---
I’ve been selling my Mini Nike’s for 10 and Missles for 5, but still have yet to sell a single one. Are those prices too high?
---
To me ha idea seems rather hard to implement. I would rather see free to play weekends once or twice a month like other popular titles do to draw in new players.
---
Thank u
---
Overdraft fees are just BS anyway. If you don't have the funds in your account, they should just decline the transaction. I'm guessing you got 3 overdraft fees for each of the extra transactions.
---
Oh wait really?!
---
I've a problem with those perimeter walls (defense) that can't be placed 90% of the time. I can place the stairs but the other parts won't snap 90% of the time.
---
100% promise you you're wrong about tagging and badges. I accidentally AFK'd through the second half of the event once and got a badge.
---
PSA: GrubHub people are not happy with "Hang on, I'm trying to get a possum badge".
---
If you are on PC, I'm gonna buy all your ammo lmao.
---
Yep, each one about 38$, then more fees for every day my account was overdrawn While I was trying to hash it out with Microsoft and Bethesda to no avail
---
&gt;All your "comparisons" are apples to oranges- Minecraft (don't make me laugh, does this even justify a response because *hint* graphics)
---
So you have terrible reading comprehension, okay. I mentioned Minecraft being popular still due to mods, not comparing them game to game. But online game that lives on for many years specifically due to mods, which is why I also mentioned Bethesda other games because modding is what kept them going for so long.
---
As for PoE and lol? The game type doesn't even matter when were just talking about bugs due to many different computer types, yet no major bugs are an issue in either of those games.
---
Guess I should just ignore you from this point on if your reading comprehension is that poor and you have to try to take my comments out of context. Lol
---
I have no idea but that's what I'm telling myself.
---
I never got it from xur got mine from a purple engram doing the weekly story mission a week or two before it was nerfed lol
---
Tomorrow morning for us aussies the 17th
---
iirc it just gives you 1 cap each.
---
Uranium fever doesn’t have any max level gear either, if you weren’t aware.
---
Well, sometime it's better if you can't recall what you've lost though :&lt;
---
The server crash really is a issue, I lost my whole camp in the same way as well, it happen by someone took my spot, I didn't choose to change world but keep playing, then server crashed, for later I found my camp never popped up again no matter how many server hops I did, and I can always move it for 0 caps just like first built, I only found half of my designs and base didn't turned into blueprints, it was a base since the game released though, I kinda missed it, well, at least for half of it lol
---
Badges are the only thing I haven’t got from doing the event thus far. I guess I’ve just been unlucky with the drop rate.
---
Have some in stash
---
Go to the Teapot and server hop until you see a dead tourist (blue shirt I think) lying across one of the picnic tables. He has a broken camera you repair and use.
---
In the early days somebody made themselves a strip club and would invite players in using emotes. There was a chair in front of the pole too. The player would strip off, crouch loads and spam the trade icon to show cash and, if you didn't pay, they would attack.
---
The post is probably still on this sub somewhere!
---
You PS4?
---
Yep
---
Why?
---
Ok cool let me know when you can meet up and I’ll buy it off you. What do you have? Plans or actual meathooks?
---
Well this is not really that reliable, I wouldn't sell my BE Handmade (2 star iirc) for only 350 caps lol.
---
As a melee guy, it sucks that by the time I get to them, someone kills them with a rifle from 200 yards. Bro, I wanna have fun too. I have a rocket powered super sledge to pound face with and I want to use it!
---
Please fix game crashing :(
---
One of the reasons I placed mine on the roof and even then it's only activated via switch 😉
---
Actual meat hooks
---
I’ve ONLY managed to get the bug girl every time, and no badges from that at all. I’ve done it at least 5 times already.
---
Anthonybundy71
---
Wouldn't pay more than 150 for that honestly, and if you are really looking for it.
---
Scrapped a lot of that type of armor in the past, it's mostly useless anyway when you have Unyielding/Bolstsring deep pocketed ammo pieces anyway.
---
Ok I sent it
---
That is effing awesome!!!!!!
---
Nope, The current duping method absolutely crashes the server. 
---
I see it, but I dont want any part that B.S. 
---
Some people can afford multiple PS4's as a result of a block pS4 address. 
---
Im not willing to take those risk.
---
But to each their own. 
---
Not my buisness. 
---
But when it effects my enjoyment of the game I love to play, then it kinda burns my ass. Just saying. 
---
I don't believe I'm wrong for that.
---
I had this random floating half wall I made to try to bypass some of the issues I was having thanks to this same reason, and then they just got stuck there, so I had to store a good 1/3 of my base, JUST to get rid of these little pieces and have to repeat the process from now on if I want to change the these two spots at all.
---
It's a pain.
---
Wendigo can spawn at Seneca Rocks Visitor center. And of course, the Wendigo Cave.
---
I've seen blood ticks near the visitor center as well past the wall barrier. And outside near the Sons of Dane compound on its right side.
---
nice
---
yes us civilized people use a switch.
---
i was, but that event has at least a chance for all three legendaries to be 3*, when the new event is just one guaranteed one star
---
Received
---
good job old sport
---
Great help thanks, completed most of it last night and will finish today, chèers !
---
- Destroy Assaultron using a Sword
---
- Kill Honey beasts while intoxicated by Mountain Honey Moonshine
---
- Take a camera picture of a player in costume &amp; mask at the Pumpkin house 
---
- Take a camera picture of a player in a Unstoppables Outfit in Nuked Zone
---
- Level Up while
---
I might take you up on that. I move a lot so I've got nothing but a 2x2 and some plants.
---
Very true!
---
I now have three finished CAMPs and am working on the fourth.
---
One Whitesprings mansion, one bar just south of Morgantown, a motel there and now I'm not sure what, but perhaps a diner/roadstop.
---
I just need the advanced electrics plan now.
---
I mean, I sell diluted Stimpaks and RadAways at 8 caps each, with disease cures at around 12 caps each (They are significantly rarer in my experience) which I believe is fair price since you can get a similar amount of caps from just selling them at a vendor and I still barely sell that stuff, people usually go for the serums or ammo in my experience.
---
At this point, it's all just water under the fridge.
---
Totally irrelevant to the conversation. 
---
Seems like you just wanted an opportunity to throw a punch any way you can. 
---
But Lucky for you, this is the internet. 
---
SMH...
---
Recon and NV scopes are available.
---
My current one dropped with Recon Scope (LR) but I have yet to get planes via scraping (Can craft Gauss Rifles), and like all guns, NV scopes are mostly available via plans unless RHGesus truely blesses you.
---
Hey, sorry I know this is old but I'm just wondering how well the targeting mod works? I heard someone say it doesn't work, just trying to confirm.
---
Why don’t you want to use it?
---
While free weekends are an option, it limits players to times they may not be able to get online, and it doesn't make them a constant (if small) part of the economy or questing system.
---
Stash man, stash often, or you gonna lose your things.
---
Does it appear for a limited time,  or will it be here for good?
---
its super annoying having to hit 5 or 6 times just to have one register. 
---
im hoping today that will be corrected.
---
LOOK AT ME GUYS LOOK AT MY SHOP IT'S THE MOST IMPORTANT ONE, ME ME ME!
---
If this was added I would purposely avoid anybody that used it.
---
We use a switch...and a brush http://imgur.com/gallery/uoADoT8
---
Lmfao .. yawn.. u r trash lil girl bahahaha
---
I think 556 is the ideal price for serums, you are making a net of 501 without considering the 10% tax which is basically just slightly more what you would get from a vendor.
---
Plus it's an easy to remember number thanks to the "5.56" analogy with the ammo lol.
---
Makes over 100k/year ;) ... and gets a big dick about it ;)
---
Banks make over $4B a year on overdraft fees. They make over $4B a year taking money from broke people. And you have no choice but to use them unless you plan on using your couch. So they have no incentive to fix that.
---
i dont b/c i run a low health build and always have 70-80% of my health bar filled with rads.
---
Looks like the  Unstoppables   chanllenge in our version got wrong,it didn't say  "in  Nuked Zone "
---
A free mode isn’t meant to give players the ideal setup for them it’s just a chance to try out the game.  Not being at a favorable time for some or not impacting the economy isn’t the point of a free to play weekend. The idea is to let people get a few hrs of game play to see if they want to buy the full version so they can continue to play.
---
Thanks! let me know if you need help with anything
---
Because you put it up for sale?
---
If it was PC, it may have been me. I have a Fixer chambered in .38, and it burns thru ammo.
---
All cool
---
for me  is about my build, i dont run a full bloidied build but I do like to keep half me health bar with rads, and that is the problem. while it really isnt a big deal, but it still sucks.
---
The game is awesome. 
---
The lore is tip notch. 
---
But there are many problems frustrating to the players. 
---
In this case, Some are caused by brazenly opportunistic players.
---
I'll translate for him:
---
-用劍類武器擊殺 Assaultron
---
-在有 Mountain Honey Moonshine 的影響狀態時擊殺 Honey beasts
---
-在南瓜屋用相機拍攝有裝扮與面具的玩家
---
-在核擊區用相機拍攝穿著 Unstoppables 裝束的玩家
---
-每日升級(0/3)
---
It would be more like "Hey guys, i have full stash, come take cheap things."
---
Yeah for people who have one vending machine filled with non legendary trash it may be useless.
---
But some of us have 70lbs only in plans.
---
I'll shit on your roof
---
Eh, I usually sell diluted Stimpaks at around 8 caps each and I rarely sell them, that also might have to do with my location though (The Toxic Valley spot where you can put both a Lead and Junk extractor).
---
Well, would be glad to be wrong.
---
... and what is grubhub?
---
Happens when first joining a world it’s loading camps and world items
---
And what’s the worst is the people who work for the catch the flak for these overdraft fees, I was pissed going into my bank at first to have to resolve this but when she explained that it’s basically an automated thing that’s beyond her control unless a third party refunds the original transaction, in which case it will “Ungrey the box” that she can click to refund the overdraft fees. That’s when I calmed down and realized it isn’t these people fault at all, they’re just doing their job like anyone else. It’s sad.
---
Only sucks, when  you die when the Imposter Sheepsquatch dies. Everytime it's happened to me, I'm unable to respond despite button mashing A...my camera just spins in circles around my drowned corpse.
---
i am on PC, but some people get greedy with free ammo, take all of it instead of what they need. i do not blame them. free is free
---
I mean, it would be a fair price if it has Anti-Armor, 40% faster swing speed (Maybe 40% attack power as well) and a good third effect as well.
---
I remember the BETA. There were a lot of problems with those mats.
---
I remember putting one near train stations or some other fast travel spot and everyone that was trying to get to the actual location ended up underneath my CAMP. People built trap CAMPs (inb4 "Just fast travel out" because it's lame to spend two way bus fare for nothing). It was dumb.
---
My advice is to just start jumping after you quick travel to a player camp to avoid ending up under it. Worst case scenario you end up locked inside...
---
Food delivery service.
---
Great idea 😊
---
I'm getting really tired of mole rats teleporting into my base or destroying my walls beyond the reach of my turrets. Does it matter if you place them horizontally or vertically?
---
Did the frog-licker get high or did he get ded? *This is signifikant*
---
There are 24 people on each server right? What if they all wanted something to trade, do you want a notification popping up on the top left every 5 minutes? This doesn't even count the server hops you would do, which puts you into another server with more people who haven't used their notification yet, here's 16 more to look at while you're trying to play the game.  
---
This honestly sounds like the Wedding ring proposal notification thing from Team fortress 2. Did anybody like seeing that pop up on their screen all the time?
---
Where is the purveyor? She ditched me? she didn't arrive at our date?
---
Srlsy, any problem with the latest update? i've been off the grid for a couple of days
---
But I would assume people are more likely to buy in the more invested they are. A constant free to play mode is more likely to achieve that than one that is limited to one or two weekends a month.
---
Fair but who has the money to buy it? Most players average at 2000 caps, my point is that if your aim is to make money, you're better off lowering prices
---
Thing is, I get into a rhythm in whitesprings and by the time adrenalin and the like kick in, I'm one shotting even with my share weapons. So generally, when I see another player on whitesprings I'll jump to another server where I can do my thing alone without screwing anyone over. But in events, I go monatovs and my vampires ripper all the way, because with lucky break I can even get my armour repaired while getting my tags on.
---
Well, they can still resell it back at their shop even if they don't need it, so there's that.
---
Area chat to get everyone to shift a couple of gears down on the weapons, always.
---
In general, i feel the mole miner gauntlet hits a lot faster. Yesterday I've got a nice mutan deathclaw gauntlet, also and is a nice weapon too. I just wish it were bloodied or instigating
---
Vault dwellers who took shelter pre war. 76 does not take place long after the bombs drop. In later fallout timelines you’d be correct.
---
Until his stash is loaded with 600 steel pieces
---
yes. but its too much hassle for me, i keep cramming it in for free. since my camp is a bit out of the way.
---
Same.
---
Most higher level people have that amount of caps or even much more (It's not uncommon for me to cap at the max 25K), 9000 is not that much for a very good legendary.
---
If you want to know how to make easy caps at the vendor: Unlock Pharma Farma level 3 and check every Chem holder or, if you are high level enough go to West Tek and do both the Chems thing first and get all the weapons from the Super Mutants, and there you go, tons of 5.56 ammo, caps and daily cap reached in less than half an hour.
---
Thats the main reason. Bloodied builds with depend on you being heavily radiated to do more damage. Tops som unyielding armor and radicool and you force that player to even become encumbered by loosing rads
---
I suppose it depends on the amount of ammo you are giving out for free, 100-200 of them is not a big loss, but giving 9000 out for free... Well my dude, you are losing out on a lot of caps.
---
I have 5 for me and 5 for thee. And it's near enough to the whitespring but just outside the usual nuke zone so it's handy for a quick rest, scrap, rebuff, and back into the action.  Now if I only had something useful to sell.
---
That’ what I was afraid of. I RP as a melee trader/scavver. I’m not really into trying to play the unyielding/bolstering angle. I don’t do any pvp and I do alright against pretty much everything that comes my way otherwise. I’m just trying to slap some deep pocketed mods on weightless wr and call it a day.
---
Eh - lame troll is lame.
---
No, just make sure you position them where the little bastards have to stand in order to attack what you are trying to defend.  It may take a bit of trial and error, but eventually you will get them adjusted so there are no gaps for the enemies to exploit. 
---
The reason I got prompted to try this is because I run a HUGE plans store, and with all the people coming and going to my base they kept triggering the spawns of attackers. It was annoying enough before, but now it was totally ridiculous. But so far it's working, and my crops haven't been touched once since I set the punji traps up. :)
---
That’s a pretty small dick thing to say lmao
---
It's very much about haw lucky you as a player are. When it first was released we were eight players searching all places we thought would be touristy for an hour before someone found him. We were mostly right about the locations.
---
When I wanted my alt character to have a camera I stood in front of Whitesprings and server hopped once to find it. It's just dumb luck.
---
I've used both. Like others have said, Anti-armor is good against everything, but keep in mind there are anti-armor mods that will give you up to 40% penetration. I finally went with the executioner's because it made it feel like more than just another gun. It is extremely satisfying to get a scorchbeast or other huge mob below 40% then whip out the handmade and decimate their health bar.
---
On PC 'Z' &amp; 'C' move the price slider up and down 1250 caps.
---
Lmfao I'm not worried about the size of my dick Haha ... . Why are you so interested in it? ;)
---
Now you just look sad
---
Just place your camp in it.  Unmarked locations are buildable
---
And a windowed brick half wall....
---
Do you get electric shocks from that one too? :P
---
Save for next day or give em away and unfortunately be like me always watching your Cary weight
---
Must be an easy way to get little boys to send in their dick picks .. no dice here amigo ... that's not a list you want to be out on twice! ;) hahahahahaahahahhahahahahahahA
---
I found one tonight,  somewhere in the mire
---
yes but the "known" sorting is not alphabetical. If you mod the name to be after, it won't go after either.
---
Not to insult your intellengence, and I swear im not trying to be condescending, but when you use the Camera, do you wait until the name of the creature or object pops up in white letters in the upper right corner? 
---
Something I myself failed to do the first couple of days. 
---
But you are right. 
---
The quest are bugged
---
Failed it waiting for low levels to finish it off, not making the same mistake again lol.
---
Says the lil girl asking for dick picks ;) bahahahahaha
---
Unyielding/Bostering isn't really used for PVP (That's where Sentinel/Cavalier and Assassin armor sets come in), it's actually for general usage since you have an increased carry weight of 15 (That's what the +3 Strength gets you) for EACH piece you have, for a total maximum of 75 more carry weight without even counting the deep pocketed mods you can add, and without counting the numerous benefits you get from the other increased SPECIAL stats as well.
---
Someone like you (Suppose you are often overencumbered if you trade a lot) would actually be the ideal target for those armor sets, really.
---
most ive given away for free was 500 fusion cells, its mostly just bullets i find. i only make ones for me.
---
The Mad Vault Dweller.
---
Maybe
---
Fair enough my dude.
---
I have some for sell on Xbox 
---
Gt excitedmunkey
---
Yeah. My lvl 18 character was hunted by a lvl 70 something teamed up with a 100 something. I took a workshop, they arrived, I left and took another. Repeat. At the third they cought up and killed me and took my scrap. Impressive to get their PvP on the adventure server where you can be prepared when you take on people a third of your level. Probably got his shit kicked out of him on survival.
---
Friendly tip. Its practically impossible for your corn plants to line up lol
---
Its took me long enough to find a big enough camp to host a farm let alone getting them to line up!
---
A few days ago I was inside that very building, for this exact reason. i was running along and ended up inside the legendary vendors store. It looks cool. There was stuff to loot but I thought best not to, just in case.
---
Don't worry I don't take many things personally and we all are capable of missing the "obvious" but yes I wait until I see the name pop up.  I am/was actually really hoping it was my fault so it would be easy rectify.
---
here for good
---
EXACTLY!!!
---
Scrapping ammo would be amazing, I’d have an actual use for all the 38 ammo I find
---
Ad Victoriam! Time to get some top level tech.
---
Yeah, I would like more personalisation options for our CAMPs, but I suspect the concern would be further server instability if everyone, started adding all sorts of clutter to their CAMP, it's probably why they haven't increased the CAMP budget, which is another thing I would like, but probably won't get. Oh well.
---
like i said to the other guy, ive done it but the inability to have full control over the interior is rough
---
I have had someone try to kill my mirelurk king, and he was invulnerable to damage
---
they may have changed it
---
"Non hardcore fallout players" I swear I came to browse a few posts and of course I see a statement so baffling and fucking out of left field I cannot contain it. This game earned a terrible reputation from damn near anyone, especially anyone remotely a fan of fallout. The fucking level of delusion is astounding beyond words. The people who "don't care about fallout"? I suppose that is the demographic they need to win. Your problem is those deluded morons are the ones playing already mate.
---
There is no future for 76 I hope, as a fallout fan. They fucked up and if you want to call me out for otherwise... I'm still checking on it, "hoping" it will turn around because I'm admittedly naively hopeful but not so fucking much as your statement makes you look. You're basically drowning in the river of Egypt.
---
Be sure not to confuse Fireman Responder's Outfit and Fireman Responder's Helmet (those are Forest region quest/events rare rewards) with very common Responder's Firebreather outfit+ Helmet (which are guaranteed reward for one of the Responder's quests, so everyone who done this had it). There is also Fireman Helmet, red helmet with better condition than Firebreather one, but is sold by Whitespring vendor occasionally.
---
PvP / Survival is clearly not for you. Stay in adventure mode, problem solved.
---
I've had it happen 2-3 times now, always after a sudden server disconnect....and worst is...all 4 of my machines had their slots full....and there were a lot of stacked items....spent 30+mins reorganizing them.
---
IMO, the ammo bulks should be the base default for ammo crafting. example:
---
100 5MM bullets per 5MM bulk, because the base craft number is 100. that way you can craft, and then bulk
---
I recently copied over to my ssd. Didn't find it much faster. Don't get your hopes up.
---
I'm not saying don't kill it. I'm saying killing it literally less than 1 second after it spawns is not cool.
---
If literally noone else can even aim at it before you kill it, you should be probably hanging back a few seconds. Especially if you have a weapon that literally kills it with 1 hit.
---
Not minutes or anything, just a few seconds.
---
That's 30lbs. Not that mutch :D
---
Maybe if he had 600 bulk steel, that would be 900lbs, but also 18000steel scrap, haha.
---
Also, if you didn't...turn off pacifist, I'm pretty sure that still applies. Even if someone's murdering you.
---
Perfect! What times you play?
---
But do you have a poop knife?
---
While on the subject, the wooden bridge. I havnt seen or recieved a single plan for it and it isnt a default unlockable. I used thay thing everywhere. Sat in the grouns at any height really nicely.
---
Taking shower once a day won't hurt you. Maybe camp owners don't enjoy smell of wild appalachia.
---
????ewww lol
---
The vats cost changes with the sight type. What type were you using?
---
^Someone please create that as a Fallout AU fanfic^
---
I'd definitely read it! A Fallout AU: Where the Brotherhood of Steel, Desert Rangers (Tycho is a Desert Ranger so it's possible he would've relayed information back to his superiors) and Masters Army, Shady Sands, Junktown, The Hub etc join forces? Fuck yeah the NCR would form quicker plus with The Master now truly aiding humanity the newly forged NCR would truly be as they claim: The true successors of the U.S. government minus the courropt bureaucrats taking more power, but as they say: War never changes.
---
Just spitballing/babbling. Nonetheless that would be an awesome situation to happen IF the Vault Dweller managed to truly talk sense into Richard Grey.
---
Just did one myself, got nothing as well.
---
This is probably why we don’t have the welcome mats in the first place.
---
I only had one star ones, It's good to know they are worth something I'll keep an eye out when I'm farming now. Though I'm not sure how much they will be worth now the Legendary vendor is round the corner.
---
He can sell a Disco ball/mirror ball plan occasionally. I just picked up off him on my last encounter...hadn't seen it before in my 15+ times of meeting him (I'm level 175) I'll go days without seeing him but then I'll see him twice in 1 day
---
I developed a system for legendaries. One Star is two times base value, Two Star is three times base value, three Star is four times base value, etc. Keeps my pricing from getting too inflated while keeping it consistent and realistic. All lame legendaries get fed to the grinder, otherwise.  All other things are discounted from base pricing by about 10% aside from difficult to craft items- which generally price themselves (mutation syrums, rare outfits, and so forth).
---
it should be today at some point.
---
Im about to go get the id in the morning after my shift. Going to be awesome standing in the queue.
---
I recently did a complete teardown and rebuild of my CAMP and this was the only issue, "Item is Floating" or "Intersects with ...", it was mainly with a single remaining roof piece, which I fixed by using an upright beam, adding the roof, and removing the beam. Those upright beams are useful things!
---
Translation?
---
Damn I've been in the wrong spot. I heard miners monument so I've been trying there. Thank you
---
Same goes for the Security Baton. It only has the Electrified mod.
---
are you doing your weekly and daily challenges? you can check them out under your challenge menu on the map screen
---
Before I remodeled, I had a doorway that had one of those otherwise annoying to work with shelves right near it.
---
On the other side was the decontamination shower; but there's no way you can get close enough to it to accidentally "clean" yourself; you have to pretty purposefully go around it and under the stairwell where it's located, on the other side of the shelf you could walk past.
---
To boot - going up the stairs doesn't trigger cleaning either, I can leave it constantly powered without fussing over messing up other people's Radicool - and without fussing with a power switch/button to toggle it.
---
_________
---
After remodeling: it's again tucked in a corner, but up on a 2nd level behind a locked door completely closed in -- you have to break &amp; enter to use it -- the only non-shop things available are a sleeping bag, stashes, and unlocked water purifiers.
---
Along with pre-fabs, a single foundation with walls and roof, a shack, just enough for a brief stop and do what needs to be done, swap in and out the required bench as needed, and easy to place anywhere.
---
Very nice use of candles.
---
Oh my. Where did you find the botanical poster blueprint? I can't find it and it's driving me nuts I need it in my camp
---
i mean, technically you can blueprint a “prefab” as you described yourself.
---
what is something that everyone can sell, even newer player can sell, such that anyone visiting will not feel time wasted?
---
Hehehe. But well, you've got the idea. Too early here and i Haven't got my coffee yet to do any maths
---
That is on your player character, but you can only put things up for sale if there is room in your stash for the items. 
---
So, we are trying to work how they 'overburdened' their stash.
---
it is a static bonus towards glowing enemies. it does work with any source of damage
---
I'm using gun fu and I'm not gonna read every mob name to save crappy legendary.
---
it sure does a huge difference on loading screens, and the game feels like it runs smoother. best upgraade I could had done to my xbox
---
If it's about the savage divide weekly i noticed that the whitesprings area is totally excluded
---
First world problems, too many showers
---
Didn't realise there was a cap. I'm 900 odd.
---
Problem with those are not your price, it is that so very few use them and because of their weight many just drop them, so they are found free on the ground often. Few users and often found free makes it hard to sell them at any price.
---
Agree. Start in adventure mode. Set up a survival base. Stash everything you don’t want to lose. Equip everything you are willing to lose. Btw... there’s absolutely nothing to lose in this game. It’s so easy. You lose aid and junk. So what? Other games if someone kills you they can take ALL your stuff. Don’t be a frigging pansy. Quit whining. If you just into survival. Know the rules.
---
before you do that make sure you have ppl in the server to help you to help you kill her.
---
You do if you aren’t seen. I use sneak with my explosive dragon. You can also that endurance card, can’t remember the name, to sneak right near enemies and get the sneak damage bonus.
---
Wait what? Isn’t any event good enough. This changes everything.
---
Yes I know, I'm just saying quick to use pre-fabs would be great in addition to your main CAMP, temporary one whilst out and about.
---
That’s cool. I would just rather not have my carry weight based on my current health. I tend to keep my health up.
---
I mean because it takes two hits to kill. It’s really hard to keep a group of people from killing it
---
Which is pretty silly, excavator armor and calibrated shocks is a pretty good combo already. Bags are a way for characters who don't want to use PA to get some extra space
---
BBQ shack, where the free range event spawns, I always see a bunch off fox there
---
Ik I’m just an impatient little biscuit.
---
Yeah, I run it with melee.
---
I agree even tho you downvote him. This game is EASY.
---
Its normal for them to regen health.
---
Impressive and spacious!
---
You ever consider Op is a noob? Needs the 1*
---
It's level 22 or a low level scorpion.... I don't have a weapon that won't one shot it.
---
each challenge is different each day. and weekly challenges do not change until next week. one of this week's is to take pictures of Scorched Creatures
---
You should get a coffee, i mean think about the AP regen! lol
---
dont worry, I already looked on twitter like 50 times to see if they posted the times about the update. 
---
I keep forgeting that im at least 6 hours ahead of every on the USA.
---
Valid point. You just need to remember that no on cares about you op. People only play to benefit themselves. Sorry. That’s the way the world works. If you were sheltered. My bad, Blake your parents.
---
I’m in Australia.-.
---
True...  didnt consider that
---
CHEESOMATIC!
---
im in Germany lol, we are in the same boat. updates ussually happens around3 or 4 pm my time so we have a long way to go.
---
I've found just choosing a different style sometimes lets me place objects. for example I wanted to build my base out of metal, wouldn't let me place a metal wall above some stairs (those goddamn stairs!), warehouse wall was fine and then I just replaced that warehouse piece for metal when in 'edit' mode
---
Damn
---
There’s a card that has radiation heal you and another that has radiation be healed during daylight, both under endurance. Don’t think there’s much more than that. Radaway is hugely abundant though and if you use chemist and super duper, you’ll get 4 or 6 radaway diluted per radaway at a chem bench. That’s at least doubling the radaway you have and sometimes tripling it.
---
roll a fat one and boom inspired. lol
---
Man of culture.
---
Did you spend any of the atoms that you mistakenly bought. If so, it makes this way worse.
---
I haven't tried at Whitesprings, but literally none of them work (these 10 animals, these 10 scorched, these 10 in the divide, this player wearing x at place y...... Nothing!)
---
I want to go home now! Very neat.
---
Yep! I went and double checked and it's the Responders outfit. Not the helmet tho, so I might try to farm that first and sell it as a set.
---
Well you right but... There is a damage sound when using the decontamination lol so it hurts a bit to take a shower.
---
You can by putting down a door and then another wall next to it along the same edge. Then you can change the door to a full wall or what you want. I've done this on most of my builds. It's a pity it takes up double the budget. I would still love to get inner walls that wouldn't have a brick end to a white wall and it would spare some budget. They still would have to make them thicker to fit in with the walls we have.
---
Fly away sweet bird!! 
---
My mutations have kept me interested in playing. I can't imagine flying off a cliff like I do in another game. I've tried to play fallout 3 again and the movement is just so slow and clunky lol.
---
black isle studios / obsidian entertainment got the best characters
---
Thanks! Good to know! Where I can find those yellow containers?
---
Someone had the same thing happening with his bloodied explosive handmade. It’s Bethesda man.
---
I haven’t seen this happen to myself and I’ve used both a bloodied and explosive railway. Best thing to do is to hit the same thing once with the regular damage, reload and do the same with the bugged damage and compare. Chances are it’s just visual, in which case it’s nothing to worry about.
---
Rejection is a bitch :(
---
Those are to recreate today's Appalachia... Sorry. I just couldn't resist.
---
It would be nice with some fixed windows. I'd like for the brick set to actually have glass in the windows too.
---
they're separate items to farm, so you can sell/trade outfit by itself. I get outfit few days ago and helmet from another person yesterday, each time paying hefty price ;)
---
Radaway is my least of my worries, i have  80 of them and im just lvl 21
---
To me it was an opposite experience. I built a small, functional and organic camp while other people’s camps are these unrealistic huge boxes with everything dumped inside.
---
I'll help ya.. gt cl88t
---
I use one each of the pistol cards that gives a 30% damage increase. Gun fu at rank 1. Also concentrated fire to targets limbs. I love using pistols, but I have rely on sneak attacks and vats criticals to keep up with my rifles. 
---
I like switching between them, and because I run a bloodied build it helps increase the damage without investing too many perks. They'd probably be similar in terms of damage if I invested into all of them.
---
I don't have one in 76, but in Fallout 4, I always leave my decon showers on.
---
Ouch - that's a punch in the Atoms. Sorry to hear that absolute nothing works.
---
You do use the pro snap camera obviously. 
---
Strange thing, could be also a platform thing maybe? If you on PS then they should work (at least daily/weeklys)
---
I'm looking for some people to play with as well. I'm from Australia, and on PC. My IGN is MrChesterson.
---
Sounds like you had a whole lot of fun. By no means is this normal but I complained to myself yesterday while preparing a vendor. When all of a sudden 3 anglers attacked me while I stand in front of the machine. After exclaiming the word "Groovy" I decided to deal with the situation in the best way possible. Extreme violence! Now my machine is covered in blood and gore and I'm fresh out of abraxo.
---
Also punji boards at the foot of stairs that lead to vending machines. Why? I thought the idea was to make camps accessable and welcoming.
---
I think they wanted you to design your own pre war building that is presumed that you found and moved into. Smaller shacks could have been created "in world" but building a two story brick mansion in a few days aren't lore friendly anyways.
---
Are you on PC? If so, what's your username? 😊
---
Great on stairs if your base is raised too, had a base in an old monorail car, and used these to stop the Molerats that spawn at the base from chasing me up.
---
Yes I use the snap camera (not photomode). My better half and I are both on PC, server hop, quit for hours, everything you can think of and still nothing for both of us, daily, weekly and world... ZIP
---
Your nuke, do as you wish.
---
You can get the plan at the pioneer scouts camp in a vending machine for one tadpole badge. I think there’s those vending machines where the campfire tales event is as well!!
---
I like purified water. You could also try rewarding dog food, nuka cola or alcohol. Since there are perks that make those items pretty useful.
---
In my immersion, spoiled fruit/veg/meat is the "poop" of the game. When you have some in your inventory, it is time to find a bush or port a potty to drop that.
---
Nope, just have a ton of RadAway on me hotkeyed to - and Stimpaks keyed to =. If I am surrounded by Ghouls, however rarely that happens, I spam those keys while holding left click.
---
Radiation from anything is your worse enemy outside of PA, even with the most "op" of builds. Especially Bloodied.
---
Anywhere a magazine spawns. It can be a huge pain. Here's hoping someone else has better tips than I do. I still haven't finished it.
---
But.. I didn't see it when I purchased my scout skirt 😨 I need to go back there! Thank you, like a lot ❤️
---
This combined with the stairs snapping to the middle of half size floors and having the same snap points as in FO4 would be great too. Then I could stop using that evil devilry stuff with stairs and pillars built into one. That is not only ugly, but always fucks up my build in some way so that I have to start over.
---
What platform?
---
Ps4
---
Ill test it later !!!
---
My friend land me a Bloodied with extra limb damage ... and it doesnt bug but mine bloodied explosive does ...
---
Yeah I've had all kinds of bugs lately with building
---
You can't nuke they're it's in the safe zone. Nuke Whitespring but hit it so safe 'n' clean, the substation and the bunker are all in the zone. Between the side entrance all the way around to the bunker is enough to make around 20 pure cobalt with green fingers equipped.
---
Happend to me 3 times this week with different creatures.
---
Radiation from ghouls is a pain. Be quick with the RadAway.
---
If you aren't playing Bloodied and are on a team just use rad sponge. That thing fires constantly.
---
Wow. Never had this glitch.
---
Oh- saw your comment how cancerous imgur is.
---
I use Instagram. Never used imgur.  How is it compared to Instagram?
---
This very much!
---
i got str. 15 with calibrated sucks and the login glitch I usually run around with a total of 580 weight or 480 after I get out for the first time or die which ever happens first.
---
"Did you try to switch your PC off and on already?"
---
No but seriously i can feel the frustration of losing atoms. Hope you'll find a fix or solution soon!
---
You are welcome to take a peek at my camp for ideas. I have a comic book store, bus house and small workshop. I can help you builld sometime, but you'll have to restock the mats.
---
Ooo I like that nuka cola and alcohol. I'll add those right away, thanks for the tip  :)
---
Honestly solving it would be its own reward for me, but I don't think you could go wrong with water and chems
---
best source off drinking if you ask me lol
---
I am not sure, that this will be update related. After the Burrows were activated in game, so it may happen for the Purveyor too.
---
Just fyi - it may not be your specific problem, but if you're carrying **two** cameras only one will ever work right. Stash any spares (if you have one).
---
You **cannot**, for example, carry both the zoom lense _and_ night vision. One will never register photos. Stash one.
---
Nice. I just figured a set 'cause the only time I've seen it was on the market website, and people were asking for the set specifically. I'll have to pop the outfit on my vendor to see if it sells.  What did yours go for?
---
I have both animal friend and wasteland whisper maxed. I'm level 79 and I want a pet supermutant. How do I get it to go to my base?
---
I'm on the Pc and bought one for 10k.
---
My guess is the vendor will open in about 7 hours
---
Ouch. Sounds like you were screwed
---
yeah it could be, but im really hoping the fix some off the bugs specially the melee bug, its getting really annoying having so many ghost hits on enemies.
---
Absolutely!
---
Yeah, it's 16th and noon for me. But i know their timing, it's in 6-7 hours
---
Water, maybe?
---
Get Instagram, take a picture, write about it, as you see things.
---
Mu brother is annoyed that i post SO MUCH fallout but i told him it's my facebook.
---
I've been taking pictures and videos since Day One of glitches and stuff. Timmy30274 is my instagram. Laying down scorch in whitesprings attacking you, scorchbeast screech on land like a bubble that won't go away, angler spit hovering, etc.
---
She'll drop today at like 10 or 1030
---
Yesss, I loved using those along with trailers and buses for homes in fo4.
---
Only have the one basic one from the dead tourist. Worked great for weeks.... But no more
---
no its not at least on xbox is not, im not saying it doesnt happen but after the hot fix I havent goten any server not responding or crash to dashboard, but i do keep my fingers crossed.
---
Agreed OP. My character is based on myself and I have been growing an afro since Christmas (you never know when that baldness is going to rear it's ugly head, pun intended) and would love more variety in the line-up.
---
I'd say it's the other way around. Now it's 25 years since the war. Most of the buildings are completely untouched by the bombs and war. Look at the Whitesprings. It's only a few years since the last human keepers of the houses disappeared. This means houses could very well be in more or less the same shape as they were pre war. It's the time that passes that makes everything into ruins in FO3, FONV and FO4.
---
There's a lot of houses and few people to care for them and therefore they fall apart in time.
---
It was fun indeed. The area the player was in had roof and wall protection... for a while at least. The player that arrived after i fixed my base must have wondered what happened as he spawned between the three dead beasts.
---
if you still help after the update im down too help you, or if you just want to play hit me up. I am always willing to play with people.
---
The second thing I noticed is you mentioned the "10 in the divide" type of quests.
---
Those do not use the camera. They use "old" photomode from the map screen.
---
I just got a message saying the same thing but I didn't make the hunt too hard because I wanted it to be doable and have a good prize. Funny thing is he also took the water lol. I'll add a chem or two, what's a popular one?
---
I'll PM you!
---
after the update if you need help hit me up, my GT is the same as here. I am always down to help and play with people.
---
I've sent you a PM
---
Yup. IGN: mcchuggernaut
---
Thank you!! I'll try that tomorrow. That counts for a decent chunk of change.
---
I believe that our CAMPs are supposed to represent pre war houses we take possesion of. Not neccesarily that we build them from scratch. Though if we can craft a gatling plasma, we could easily build a brick wall.
---
I believe they all say "photomode" if they use the "old" camera. Double check in case you're trying to complete something different than what I think you're trying to complete.
---
Good luck!
---
Meh they’re both pretty bad when it comes to fo76 but instagram has less furries
---
concentrated fire's best aspect is letting you target specific limbs. so, unless you want to be the mvp who consistently downs SBQ by targeting her wings with Tormentor, just go with damage instead.
---
the "damage" bonus from concentrated fire is very negligible anyway, tbh
---
Yeah people really seem to misunderstand the fallout game world. We're all playing how we want to, and at some point those play styles are going to clash.
---
The Collector badge is one of the ones you really shouldn't try to just do, and instead wait till you happen on the items naturally. Magazines (and most other items for the badge) are all random spawns.
---
Yes please. Placing a board brings up the keyboard to type.
---
Great idea. Like in Minecraft
---
holy heck. i'll slap mine up for that much and see how it goes lol. Thank you!
---
Furries????
---
Why would some one buy a game they get for free all the time?
---
“Ass heap” lmao RUDE
---
Player vendors sometimes sell Magazines too. I sold all mine before I noticed this challenge but I've since bought a few back.
---
Thanks I got a bit last night in that area, I dunno no how much my wife needs I think she's building a jet pack or something.
---
You can spend your 1000 scrips today and obtain multiple legendaries. But tomorrow, you'll have to start again from 0 scrip, and you can only get 150 scrips a day. 150 scrips is 1-3 weapons/armors rolls only.  
---
And with any roll, you have about 1/1000 chance to get the weapon you want.
---
They don’t count
---
If only you could force people to shower in real life. Stinky (or stanky depending on your preference) people in line at the local grocery store make my shopping experience less pleasant.
---
Thank you, makes perfect sense, appreciate the information as I never knew it was 150 daily from thereon. Hmmm
---
Anytime. Nice pics also.
---
I love this idea!!
---
You could also set up neon letters/numbers for grid reference
---
The setting of the game is 25 years after the government ended. It's a few years after the houses stopped being kept by their owners. If you find a house that haven't been lived in today for two years and haven't had repairs done in 25 you'd think it was an ordinary house, but it would look dirty. Get a few boxes of abraxo and some water and you have a pretty clean house.
---
I think, Generals steakhouse in the bog has a lot cobalt.
---
Drop Site G2/C2 (Northeast of Watoga, can reset between hops)
---
Morgantown Frat House can spawn 2 mags.
---
Wixon Homestead south of Vault 76 can spawn one mag upstairs.
---
These are the places I've been farming for the normal Magazine Challenges, but I think the mag is randomised.
---
I feel this could be gamechanging, eapecially with the potential disease element. TSE diarrhoea, anyone? It's hard to get through an SBQ fight without catching something so imagine a whole server trying to do that fight with a case of the shits, it would truly be a scorched earth event.
---
Because it was nerfed and no
---
20 cobalt from safe and clean disposal? that seems rather high as that would be over 200 raw flux required. I always nuke Morgantown for my cobalt flux as it has a large quantity of fission fruit. As well as plenty of ghouls for the required crafting materials for the stable flux.
---
Personally I use stimpaks, radaway and disease cure the most, but grape mentats are good for selling or buying to robot vendors so people might be into those? It may vary a lot tho, I never ever use radx but know people who chug it like water lol
---
They stop animals walking in and trashing your machines/base.
---
I would like some versions of the brick set. Just a white repaint of the bricks (Whitesprings-looking). The stone of Berkley Castle or other mansions. The greenhouse walls of FO4. ...and so on.
---
The second shot from the two shot effect only deals 25% damage for a total of 125% damage. It used to do full damage but then it got nerfed.
---
Now that we are fast travelling to peoples camps to check out their vending machines, we need fast travel mats, the number of times I fast travel into a wall of under the floor, and can’t get out is ridiculous.
---
The idea behind it is to keep you playing. Bethesda's like "Trying to perfect your build well that's cool but... you'll have to do it one level at a time."
---
Why do people end up subscribing to games that have a free to play component?
---
Appreciate it. The pics don't exactly do it justice (I'm not a photographer, it doesn't matter how many times you make it a daily challange! lol) If your on xbox I'll message you my gamertag and you can try it and claim your prize lol
---
we have an Aussie.  one.
---
Serums are great rewards, especially for new players. Even high level players can re sell them for a couple hundred caps. They are rather easy to craft in large quantities also.
---
i love your ideas and they are great, but who is we.
---
i for one would love more QoL stuff for game play not just camps.
---
presets for perk cards i think with 3 or 4 would be more than enough
---
melee ghost hits
---
FT mats for camps ( 8 out off 10 times im getting stuck)
---
in game text (hard to see at times)
---
in game chat/massage system
---
inspecting items in vending machines
---
again your post is great and I would love to see some off the stuff you mention added/fixed in camps.
---
The tadpole challenges are all camera and people took our pics in the places wearing whatever was asked and by mics they confirmed they got their Atomic Dollars. Trust me I try to think of everything possible I could try or do wrong before I bother people about it.  
---
But I always appreciate and ideas, wisdom and/or advice, so thank you very much :)
---
Aahhhhhhh. Silly me.
---
Very much!
---
Pre-war buildings are immersion breaking!
---
ouch! Yeh I don't make much, mine usually goes bad because I can't get enough high rad fluids to craft what I collect &gt;&lt;;
---
Yeah. I'm guessing they will show up at the same time the Atom shop/dailies/etc rolls. Check your Atom shop sales.
---
Other users are guessing 10/11a EST US.
---
Because the interns at bethesda can't implement it
---
yeh I had pretty much hundreds of a few things, like rubber, plastic and cloth which I really needed for crafting...and now I'm like "wtf am I going to sell for caps...I don't have time to spend hours and hours grinding for materials...again..." #keepingJunkVendorsinBussiness
---
[](/tiaab)5 hours and 43 minutes til release if the daily timer is anything to go by.
---
Now that everyone can visit my camp, I made an evil church to welcome travelers. Everytime I see another CAMP, I understand how better other players can be !
---
I remember hearing about it and explosive getting nerfed, but I never thought it was that badly done. So there is really no point in using it over my smg with burn damage then. Well that’s disappointing. I expected the nerf to be about 50% at most.
---
Wow, 3 at SB's at once attacking your base, intense! 
---
&gt; EDIT:Could anybody please explain what makes my post so much "down vote" worthy !?
---
There are no telling why. I left a comment about someone needing help and they could feel free to add me anytime ingame, got downvoted. The dude took me up on it, I said I would be online in a few hours, got downvoted.
---
Yeh I think I had that happen to me once too in my travels... now I tend it just be like "ehhh find another world"
---
If you put a few stims and some radaway in, maybe even some ammo, it should be worth leaving the vendor on.
---
I’m not sure I’m following you could you give me an example of what you mean. I don’t know of any game that offers a paid base game but also offers a diluted version of the same game with all the same features but less content for free.
---
Grounded mutation doesn't affect Radition damage does it? Only energy damage?
---
We need this so we can stop using those extremely bugged out evil stairs with the pillars! They always mess up my builds in a way that I have to remove the second floor entirely adn close by walls.
---
I can't even......
---
Jump away as soon as you fast travel. If it's a CAMP that's far away you'll more than likely have a delay before it loads and gets built on top of you. Afaik this works across all 3 platforms.
---
That's the best you have..... For now....
---
You did what I did,  built next to a spawn point, or directly between 2 so I constantly get attacked from both sides.  Put a few small generators around your base and see what direction they are coming from, then move your base a few feet/meters away.  I found moving my base 10 feet stopped the attacks.
---
Any MMO really. Granted, it's not so common in pay-once games, but you don't know until you try.
---
It effects all energy weapons, not the energy damage type. So both the physical and radiation damage of that gun are halved because it's apparently technically an energy weapon (even though it's not doing any energy damage).
---
I'd LOVE to be that guy but I just recently got my 1st serum recipe and I rarely get the stable flux I'd need :(. I love the idea and maybe one day I can come up with a gameplan that works for me where I can craft a ton. Thanks for the tip
---
So much this! I can't understand why they removed the attachment points at the sides of the floors/foundations and in the center of the half wide floor pieces.
---
The selected item is floating. 
---
I wanna die. Every. Single. Time.
---
I lovethe fact that that he gives you a piece of paper that's like 'You Have Been Insulted!'
---
It was the cutest thing I've seen in a while.
---
Two shot is not worth it anymore. I dont understand why ppl are so hyped about. Go for AA if not running low hp.
---
 [On my way](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGMabBGydC0)  ;)
---
I think he's referring to that one near the grass.
---
I have hit every train station every day this week and have not seen the “Script Machines” anywhere, what am I missing here?
---
Reading that paper made my day
---
Other good areas are Toxic Valley by Wavy Willards, the Mire by Sunday Brother's Cabin or the fissure site by the Pumpkin House.
---
Do we have a confirmation of this somewhere? I was unable to find one on the Fallout wikis?
---
All I could find was someone sayin that it does NOT affect radium rifles: https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/b8toaz/does_the_grounded_mutation_debuff_radiation/
---
It doesn’t work on wooden foundations that are on a cliff side or wooden foundations at max height. Usually with the slow load while you’re inside an object you can either jump up out of it or it’ll forcefully push you on top of it. But if you spawn on a cliff side or beneath a max height one you’re trapped in the space between the wooden struts. But even if you can jump above it, half the time I end up inside a locked building with the vending machines on the outside. And I don’t feel like getting a bounty to break out of someone’s house
---
Previous dupe wave did nothing bad to games economy and this won't break it too.
---
Yeah two weeks ago, before last dupewave hit, people were still complaining economy is broken because of dupers and TSEs should be nerfed, but they were simply wrong - you can't demand nerfing/removing 3rd tier gear from the game because it breaks it and be right simultaneously - and after TSE nerf that happened few months ago majority of duped stuff became 3rd tier gear.
---
Now we gonna see some fluctuations and rise of bloodied weapons availability, in a month they'll nerf bloodied, boost furious et voila, new meta, new prices, new economy.
---
Absolute same. I love the random and silly encounters that they just kind of throw in there sometimes. It breaks up the monotony of farming and whatnot. It's great. 😊
---
Cool, come on by if you feel like it. :)
---
Ok so far I have as a prize 2 of ; purified water, dog food, rad away, disease cure, nuka drinks. As well as 1 grape mentats and a few random alcohol and ammo. I think this sounds like a good list, I just hope people take it next time they win lol
---
There was a post a while back that touched on the drop rates for specific item types, and I believe there was anecdotal evidence that if you have a lot of one type on your person and in your stash, you will continue to get it--like if you have a ton of Berserker stuff, you'd continue to get Berserker stuff. I'm not a stats guy, but even though this person logged over 600 drops, he was the only person to mention, or notice the phenomenon. Like I said: anecdotal.
---
My gut feeling is: if you roam the wasteland picking up legendaries all day, you probably have a bunch of nocturnal stuff. And wood armor. And if you get a 3\* weapon that normally weighs less than a pound, it probably has 90% weight reduction.
---
"No hard feelings. Walk it off."
---
Thank you very much!
---
Don't rush the game and try to power level. Take it slow within each area and soak in the lore. If you treat this game more like a looter shooter and less like a survival light, mmo light RPG, you're going to hit a tar pit real quickly.
---
And always scrap junk at a workbench before you store it in your stash. Save yourself a ton of space.
---
You're dictating that like no one else has ever experienced it. :P
---
Everyone knows. It sucks. And just fast travel instead of breaking out. That also sucks. We know. :P
---
Radx should be pretty helpful
---
Happens about every other time I play an event. About 5% of the population are psycopaths and can't relate to other people's feelings. They have apparently concentrated to online gaming.
---
What do I win?  If it's a "2nd CAMP build token", I'd be all over that!  lol j/k ;)
---
As interesting as that sounds, sadly I don't think you can tame a supermutant. The nearest you can get is Grahm if you can find him!
---
Yeah, definitely not worth it. And does AA effects stack with armour piercing mods? To be honest I’d probably just go for Quad instead of two shot. Especially if I can get a quad explosive.
---
Oh really? That's good to know :)
---
I was hoping it was normal in some way sine eventually he would be whittled down and die so its good to know he can look after himself :)
---
Although I liked my initial thought of him eating some mole rat meat restored his health lol
---
Thanks! I knew I wanted to light up the bridge, and had tried several ideas that involved stringing power out there... until a friend of mine suggested the candles.  Sometimes two heads are better than one!  :)
---
Those games usually just give you a free trial right? After so many hrs or a certain level you have to buy the monthly subscription?
---
All participants are actually added to a super group already. That's why PvP is disabled during the event but turned on the moment it ends.
---
Don't do the story until you're level 50
---
I do wish we could stimpak them or revive them after they die. I have had a few heartbreaks over my pets and currently refuse to have another till there is a way to keep them forever.
---
I want a "drink" option to consume Nuka Colas and booze as soon as I find it. Why can I do it with dirty and hazardous water but not with something I actually want to drink? It's like I'm role playing as someone with no impulse control.
---
25% more base weapon damage (mods such as hardened receivers won't boost the damage) A fully modded weapon will appear as if the increase in damage is only about ~20%
---
No way to farm specific legendaries.
---
Don't be so focused on TSE stuff, it's not the best combo. It's actually really bad but eh, way too popular.
---
Explosive only adds up 20% **base** weapon damage/bullet. In the case of a 10mm smg that's ~6 damage/bullet. 2*6=12 more damage from explosive effect.+8 damage from two shot modifier =  20 extra base damage. This can be boosed by perk cards but it's up to you if wasting 5 perks on demolition expert for an extra 60% damage from explosive it's worth it. (no it's not)
---
A bloodied 10mm SMG deals just as much damage as a tse 10mm smg when you're down to around 75%hp... Go a bit further down and TSE is being left in the dust. 
---
Now the biggest **oof** is with you using vats AND tse weaponry. TS is notoriously bad when it comes to vats because it misses waaay too much. The percentage shown when you're using a TS weapon is misleading, the bullets follow odd trajectories. 
---
tl;dr don't use tse with vats. Bloodied-Explosive is by far the best choice, even if you're not a bloodied build. You have way more flexibility with bloodied and you're not sacrificing so much accuracy.
---
Go to West Tek immediately.  The best low-level farming spot.
---
I haven't played any of the others but I thought about this as well. The earliest we've ever been out of the vault in a FO game and we have to kill an extremely strong group of enemies. Think about other locations like NYC and Seattle. The FO world can go on forever.
---
You said “jump away” and I was saying that’s not always and option. And why should I spend more caps to fast travel away, particularly when a number of camps are in remote locations. I already said about having to fast travel out in my original post, so not sure why you’re repeating it back to be as if it’s something new that I’d not thought of.
---
LoL cg.
---
Plus downtime for any maintenance/updates before we can actually play.
---
if it fits, it sits &gt;!in your stash box!&lt;
---
take everything that isnt nailed down, scrap it and store it
---
Just have a look around! go for a walk :)
---
I try to just find the vending machine and do my business just because, despite it being a video game, it still feels weird poking around too much, haha. My social anxiety bleeds into my behavior in the game.
---
Where were you 2000 caps ago?
---
I've got my original character's CAMP set up kind of like a bootcamp squad bay. A boot C.A.M.P. if you will.
---
&gt; fireproof is a perk
---
No fucking shit.
---
I can tell you it does cut the damage in half for radium rifle, I use one frequently for my VATS Commando build and if I try to use grounded my gun only does like 30 damage.
---
Depending on what serum you have the flux is easy to get. Just have to drop the nuke on the right spot.  I drop on Morgantown for cobalt. Harpers ferry for violet/crimson. Whitesprings for fluorescent/yellow. If you need yellow make sure the nuke hits the train station and power substation and safe and clean disposal as well for maximum rad berries. For ultracite just do a few runs in the glass cavern and you will be stocked for days.  Also all the places I listed are great for the other materials needed to stabilize the flux after you collect the raw flux.
---
Perk card blueprints/quickplans would be nice. So I can build a “locksmith plan”, “crafting plan”, “solo adventuring plan”, “team adventuring plan” etc with my perks.
---
Well, each game it's different. Some have a level cap, some make xp gain slower, some restrict access to items and places. Or a combo of such things. Plans, legendary exchange, and wider fast travel would be the draw in this case to buy in.
---
Right...
---
I brought like 80 magazines... sad times
---
Just kinda stashing them now out of embarrassment and in the hopes I can stick em in cases later...
---
You might question why you offered to break out of a CAMP rather than fast traveling as you mentioned in your original post. I can't answer why you only think of that at intervals.
---
All I'm trying to do is relate with you as a player that it does suck. It's frustrating. I get it.
---
 **Pannapictagraphist** \--Beeps just like the one to help locate caps. Luckily, I got one in a perk pack. I equipped it for the first time yesterday.
---
I've wanted this for the longest for my darn brick walls. 😭
---
Good job OP.  And the Nuka Cola machine as the queen reminds me of the Crushinator from Futurama 😉
---
I don’t care about TSE weapons though... I said “I know TSE will probably be better” but I’d like a Quad Explosive with reduced vats cost. And I’m a pistol/explosives user so I already use demolition expert and grenadier. The mention of two shot was just because I wasn’t sure why it only increased the damage by about 20%. And two shot vats accuracy is jank anyway.
---
I had a similar problem. I had power armor on that had a 0% fusion core in it, dropped the fusion core and all was fine.
---
Death from starvation :[
---
I carry a vampire's tesla gun just for these kind of events.
---
I think a free to play weekend would attract more players into buying the game however. If they can play for free with only a few downsides I don’t think it will encourage them to buy the game. At the end of the day that’s the whole idea is to encourage more game sales. From Bethesda’s point of view of course. If they are not making money they will not increase server load for nothing.
---
As i stated at the beginning- I can't take you seriously
---
you obviously didn't read that other subthread- and lets just assume you have a raging ass overclocked super machine- you think because that is the case that the game should run "perfectly" and you are dead ass wrong because you don't know shit about computers- but keep on thinking that it is all Beth's fault and cannot possibly be due to you not optimizing your system - which yeah, MAY include slowing it down or getting larger bandwidth (got news for you 20 mbps is slow- and yeah I looked over you comments to see if you were an obstinate little prick elsewhere, yep you are)
---
"The game type doesn't even matter when were just talking about bugs due to many different computer types" &lt;-- literally shows you don't know what you are talking about
---
but you got all thee answers
---
Yeah, if it’s one person and not a repeatable process then it’s not really anything reliable. Thank you though.
---
got him again last night. but jings, does he not pick the most bloody awfull times to turn up. I'm trying to creep up on a mrlk/queen with 2 l80 s/b over head +.Never even heard the insult. Still.............I like this guy.
---
You never actually die, you just get really low on health and AP.
---
My source is personal experience. If you dont believe me you can always try for yourself.
---
The Quake Sumo way!
---
Username checks out.
---
Cap profit? Do you just get caps for being in the game?
---
It was fun! Sorry it was short, thanks for sticking by my deathbag friendo.
---
Really? Honestly I’ve never tried dying from starvation or thirst. I was just going off what the loading screen told me.
---
1. Like pheakel said, not yet. My ticket/email said "4-6 months to be manufactured and delivered" as of December 18th-ish. I figured we'll hear something by next month.
---
and for 3. I'm not entirely sure, but you can always submit a ticket to find out. I got both the atoms and the ticket for a replacement bag.
---
You do when your vending machine is active.  I guess I should have mentioned that lol that's the whole point of doing it in the first place.
---
Awesome :)
---
I'm not denying your experience, i'd just like to see the math :)
---
If there are no nearby fast travel points then there in nowhere to teleport to, meaning you either have to leave it or picklock your way out. There are large portions of the map I’ve not even touched yet other than sprinting to Stations. So no real “question” about it. And it doesn’t detract from having to pay more caps to get out of a situation that shouldn’t occur to begin with.
---
Why what no dont do that
---
No mr. Psycopath. You don't need to for me.
---
It is just wait dude
---
are they 20 of the exact same gun? then yes. if no, then it may be an alt account just trying to max out their caps for storage.
---
Honestly, you'll probably die from the first mole rat that randomly spawns to attack you,  but I never seem to die strickly from having an empty food and drink meter.
---
Wow, 30 legendaries? They must grind every day 20hours, this is not posible!
---
Just asking man haha
---
I'd say no. They probably have a mule character to hold extra things.
---
I like that, then maybe less low level players will show up to Queen fights...
---
True. Forgot about all the mobs that spawn with every visitor.
---
There are a couple of the same guns but only a few duplicates, so I’m gonna day it’s probably an alt
---
I figure we will see a lot of these posts so
---
No this is most likely a mule account. Which. Is perfectly okay.  Some one spent the extra money to buy a second copy of the game to store their extra weapons armor and the sort while they are out and about questing.
---
It's worked for me the last couple of days,  woke up quite a few caps ahead from when I turned off the T.V.
---
Sorry I don't think I explained properly. My main character doesn't load into a world then disconnect, It doesn't even load in. It disconnects stright away as soon as I select play.
---
My ticket said to allow 4-6 months for manufacturing and delivery. This was on December 18th.
---
[https://i.imgur.com/lWrr2jg.png](https://i.imgur.com/lWrr2jg.png)
---
There were a few hoops to jump through to do this, like providing pictures of my receipt from BestBuy along with shipping info and other proofs of purchase.
---
Will it be like a terminal, where only one person can use it at a time? LOL Imagine the line up.
---
I have the marsupial serum but my problem is I haven't dropped a nuke and I'm too awkward playing with other people in a team so I depend on other people dropping nukes. Even when that happens I'm usually in the middle of something and I tend to forget. When I get better at it maybe I'll be able to start adding them but I just suck at getting flux right now. I am planning to buy from vendors too but I dont see many that have what I need (especially at a good price)
---
You can always port to 76 for free. Always.
---
if it is the same gun, with the same mods, same legendary rolls (example, 3\* Bloodied, Explosive +1 Perception hand made rifle), Same durability size. then that's a duper
---
Yeah I just wanted to ask because I saw a few different release dates for it and was unsure, I tried to browse through the sub for it but couldn’t find anyone posting about it so I decided to ask
---
Just an alt character acting as a mule. Plenty of 100% legal and legit people do that.
---
I'm selling 2500 5mm at 5 each, too steep? Don't like, don't buy. Whos's next?
---
Well nobody here seconds your thoughts, nor do they want to build one there to farm. You know for a fact it has nothing to do with anyone being butt hurt. It's about others absolutely ruining the game for everyone else. When there is a C.A.M.P. there, nobody else is able to kill any enemies save for the few that aren't mowed down by turrets at the bases of said turds. Maybe gauge from the amount of down votes on your comment that most people are in disagreement with you. You are clearly one of those farming turds (hence your defending of them) that is probably too shit at the game to kill any legendary enemies otherwise. I for one don't find enjoyment or accomplishment in cheesing my way to getting good gear in games. My sincerest apologies (not) for being so crude, but you sir, chat out of your arse crack.
---
Very cool!
---
Yeah guys just a mule character found out his main was just down the road from his camp haha
---
It also depends on the star ratings. Yesterday I picked up a whole bunch of crappy 1star legendaries from camps for a few caps each (between 5-15 caps a piece). Easily the type a level 2 could afford in bulk and try to re-sell to make a profit. If it’s a bunch of 3star stuff though, maybe message the guy if possible to ask if he’s an alt
---
Not just low lvl
---
To line up the rows of corn you have to use cotton yarn
---
Oh that’s the best serum to have every one and their mother wants that mutation.  I sell mine for 300 caps all day long and it takes all I got to keep them in stock I’ve hit max caps 4 times since the vendor update dropped which has allowed me to expand my serum collection further increasing my income. I would recommend focusing on turning that serum into a profitable business.
---
&gt;if it is the same gun, with the same mods, same legendary rolls (example, 3\* Bloodied, Explosive +1 Perception hand made rifle), Same durability size. then that's a duper
---
I thought it was something like that, but Ive never looked into that build myself.
---
I have 4 and I leave 3 open at all times
---
I hate how good the outside looks with how grubby the interior is 😭
---
CAMP data probably can't load in until your character is loaded in the world.
---
Milions, like with every new content, or returning players or whatever. Search bar is too small.
---
I could also do that to my camp too. Big shock there, I definitely didn’t know too could fast travel to the vault or your camp for free. Much wow. But that hardly helps if the camp I want to check out is the other side of the map, does it? Not to mention the initial cap cost to get there.
---
They already know that you had a collectors edition from your account but made customers go through this.  
---
Did you get your bag?
---
Or maybe I want low level items to start a new character, and think it might be a laugh to have legendary effects right out of the vault...
---
Why? I don't know.
---
Save your caps.. Then check out player vendors for great plans And recipes that are pricey af early on
---
You speak the truth.
---
I'm sitting on around or just below 200 DR, ER and RR.
---
My main is a 205 but i have alt mules. All of them are under level 15. My trader mule has about 1200 lbs on him. It consists of  plans, mods, and mountains of legendary items. This is my hoard ive been collecting and selling. I have multiple of the same weapon but different variations. When you have been collecting since the beginning, its not at all hard to to accrue a pile of weapons and armor
---
EXACTLY. It's soooo annoying. It's the prettiest wall but it looks like crap on the inside. I have my walls covered in as many posters as possible to cover it up. 🤣
---
Vault Interior walls for Metal Walls is my dream.
---
Thanks ! i'll try to play without any firewalls
---
I'm being told you do eventually die from it. I guess it just takes a really long time then? Either way though, you'd profit from selling stuff in your vending machine while you sleep IRL.
---
I don't really know if you're discussing at this point or just trolling out of frustration. You can jump, but then you can't, but then you can fast travel, but then you have to break out if it, but then you can't fast travel, but then you can..... This is very disorganized.
---
gg hf!
---
Some are great, but most are giant, square, empty 3-storey floating fortresses you could fit the Ferris wheel from Camden Park in
---
I've been farming for magazines in Watoga when I still had those challenges open (too bad the completed collections don't count toward the Possum challenge):
---
If you spawn at the Station/High School, run towards the Shopping Mall. The first magazine can spawn in the bus on the street below. Then run past Phoenix to the Slocum Joe's at the back of the next building, there are two inside (one on a table, one in a rack). Then there is one on the top floor of the E.M.S. building (room to the right of the stairs), and the final one I was farming is in another bus in front of the Watoga Transit Hub.
---
I found all but one magazine (Astoundingly Awesome Tales 4, if it even exists) that way, but it took me months, so I'd advise against doing the badge that way.
---
I'm not convinced here. You could be buying up these items quite easily. I've bought over 70 magazines this week. Still don't know about he weight bur cheater I'm not sure
---
Ah ok, thanks, another question, what type of armour are you using?
---
This game is super easy as is.
---
The best guess is when the Atom shop rolls/when updates "usually happen", etc 
---
Check the Atom shop. There's a timer on sale items that tell you when it updates (same time daily quests reset). Best guess is around that time.
---
It actually changes with pretty much every mod, it's based on weight I think. I want to know what mods he is using on each.
---
Alcohol. Any kind, but especially rarer kinds. 
---
It's often needed for the daily and weekly challenges and I can craft it myself but would rather buy en masse. Most vendors under "drinks" just have purified water...
---
That’s neat indeed!
---
I've got plenty of them spare if it let's you trade them. Once you've got one you find them in toolboxes half the time
---
I’m not on right now, or I would die for you! 😉
---
U can add me if u want, am in Aus and on pc. i have multiple toons at different lvls.  IGN: Avitar00
---
Well, yea,  but that doesn't address the bug lol
---
No. It hasn't been the allotted time, so I assume they're not done being made yet. I don't expect to hear anything until sometime next month, if anything.
---
The info thing wasn't really as bad as it sounds, imo. I just took a pic with my phone of my receipt and sent it in with the ticket. That's all.
---
380
---
I build around in-game content and I do come across other camps doing that too. My last camp was in a monorail car. Today it's on top of an underground bunker which I filled with red lights and strobes.
---
My favorite camp I visited today was built around a cave and used colored lights to highlight the entrance
---
It’s not about being easy, it’s about being more enjoyable, also, I asked for an option, not enforcing it on you or anything.
---
It’s easy because players are roaming around with weapons that one shot everything.
---
Oh, but that is ok, right?
---
Some of it is easy, sure. Imposter Sheepsquatch is not lol.
---
Could try turret rooms? Just lock the doors, and close them when potential customers arrive.
---
Is Bethesda who is treating this game more like a looter shooter.
---
My DR right now is 387.   I have scaly skin mutation as well as barbarian at rank 3 and evasive at rank 3. My armor is an Unyielding one star chest piece combat armor, a 2 star Unyielding combat armor left leg and left arm, a 3 star Unyielding  right arm and leg leather armor.  When I put on my back pack with the armored modification it goes up to  477.
---
i think the challenge was added after i leveled up my cards to 3, the challenge pops when you level one card for each special to max rank, you dont have to have it equiped and it does not count cards before the challenge went in the game
---
Oh wow, what does the scaly skin mutation do? And how much DR does the backpack give
---
You have my opinion. I do not think that players should be able to turn off the hunger and thirst meter.
---
I forgot to note that because of having 15 total mutations as well as having things like radicool perk my strength stat hovers between 29 and 32 and agility sits in mid 20s.
---
ive Seen other similar reports on this subreddit.   I believe they had to open a support ticket on the official site to get it resolved.
---
Me too, need to revive someone, also on pc
---
It hasn't changed
---
Sorry, you said option lol
---
Sometimes you can jump out of foundations, but other times you can’t due to placement. Sometimes you can fast travel to a nearby location (though you should have to) then run back. And other times, if there is no nearby location you either have to spend more caps (shouldn’t have to) and go somewhere further away or abandon the idea of using that camps vending and go elsewhere. It’s not a difficult premise to understand. Perhaps if you would actually read rather than spend your time trying to talk to me as if I’m an idiot, you’d be able to follow. If I am going to a camp to look at vending, but cannot look at the vending due to either entering locked building or being trapped beneath due to bad placemat, then that is the issue at hand. Telling me “you can fast travel to 76” is irrelevant as that has nothing to do with the point at hand.
---
I like the idea.
---
Yes... it has.   
---
Patch 9.0 I believe. Read the update logs.
---
Some areas are gonna be too tough and there's not much of a warning, don't waste too much time or ammo on trying to force your way through certain quests, just come back to them when you have better weapons and understand the enemies better. Events are probably the fastest way to learn which areas have what types of enemies. Pretty much everything is worth at least 1 cap, sell vendor bots stacks of plates or empty bottles if you have to. Scrap weapons and armor to learn mods for them, craft low level ones if you want to learn mods for anything specific. And use the tag for search option to quickly figure out what you want to grab to scrap quickly.
---
Thank you so much for your offer of help though! 😊
---
Yeah it’s bugged
---
the bucket list ? go to the steps, round the front of the house, there'll be a quest indicator,
---
take out the cam, aim at it, fire.. it should complete it..
---
Help me complete the picture challenge wearing a grognag costume while in a nuke zone, I'll die for u
---
I've done it at least 8 times and haven't gotten a badge yet. Aggravating.
---
About 220ish, despite having multi star mostly BOS combat armor. But then my End is only 5.
---
Just go for a bounty that appears. And instead of finishing them off when they’re on their knees, stimpack them. That’s what I did. I did then re-kill the guy after....but that’s optional.
---
No it was the daily challenge but got it done. Thanks.
---
Hmm interesting
---
Found it especially bad in 3rd person, pretty much can't hit smaller creatures without going 1st person.
---
Okay thanks
---
I put a switch in front of mine. You can also jump over it.
---
Keep your dirty, irradiated feet off my shag carpet!!
---
Ermergerd, Derper!
---
All of my plans are sold at price machine gives and new plans added daily aftet every adventure
---
You deserve Interior walls for your metal walls! Hopefully Bethesda actually considers/has considered this.
---
&gt; EDIT:Could anybody please explain what makes my post so much "down vote" worthy !? 
---
Funny story! I like how you told it. To answer this though, all I can say is.. it's reddit. And reddit is really weird/dumb. I got a bunch of downvotes for making a casual discussion asking what people's favorite outfits in the game were.
---
Yes!! There is every hue for all of the other hair so I dont see why it cant be incorperated.
---
Processing... proooocessing...
---
Awesome job, saw that spot some days ago and was thinking about trying to build something there too :)
---
You forget that concentrated fire allowing you to vats target specific areas can allow you to target the weak spot. While people are not 100% positive on the damage multiplier for this, most people believe this is a 2x multiplier. This is why it takes me twice as many bullets to kill a SM in the chest vs the head. Thus this is a 100 % damage bonus perk card.
---
Not hardly as interesting as someone commenting about something before looking in to the details.
---
A Mr. Bandit bot actually tried to stick me up the other day. He demanded I drop everything.
---
Maybe I'll come by and chess it out.
---
YeH! NONE of the styles come close to my hair. But I settled on "elegant". Which makes me feel like an imposter.  It looks like a shorter relaxed version of my hair.
---
But the best (unintended) true live quirk is that you have to start all over when the fucken DC happen.
---
Shhhhh my child FOR YOU SHALL JOIN ME ON MY JOURNEY AND YOU WILL BE CALLED UPON TO BE THE KING
---
&gt; The info thing wasn't really as bad as it sounds, imo. I just took a pic with my phone of my receipt and sent it in with the ticket. That's all.
---
Thing is you had to do it even when they already knew that your copy was legit.  
---
Bro its something is done and taught to a majority of service centres.  
---
Last year I went to Asus Service centre because my zenphone 5 had screen flicking issue. Representative Asked for a bill of my purchase to confirm if my phone was in warranty or not.  It had not even been a year since the phone released Dam sure it will be.  
---
I never had any issue like that with Samsung, apple,lenovo or even Xaiomi. They all just take the phone and use IMEI to check if it is in warranty or not.  Thing is it does not cost them anything to ask for it but sometimes they might get lucky and find a guy who lost his invoice.  The customers won't even notice this because that request seems totally legit.
---
I was looking forward to it but it's awful! I've placed 2 foundations and and decided I needed to move them just a little bit and both were stuck in place saying part of the structure would not be  accessible. The only way to move them was to move the camp and continue moving it until it was right. First move was 40 caps the rest were 160 so I spent well over 1k trying to just place my floor
---
Also for the wrapped cap it removes the beard. 
---
This hat feels like a time machine and I’m all of a sudden looking like I would never been allowed to leave the vault without showing ID
---
Well I agree on stimpacks, but at least normal health regeneration is fine in the area I have my camp. No chances of scorchbeasts and big nastys to get him and the turrets normally shred most enemies lol
---
Assuming he is running enough Agility for it to matter. If he can only get 1 or 2 shots off before running out of AP, he might as well manually aim.
---
Yeah I hear you dude
---
They added a few random things in. Bandit bot (the mr handy that threatens to rob you), insult bot, and there was another one I saw (don’t remember the name) that would talk about upsetting/offending/annoying what I assume is another bot because it was sent out to find something. Never met those before the more recent updates. Always used to bump into that mr handy with the cats though.
---
Im not so good at those numbers. But i know there is a cap to how much pen u can have.
---
K
---
Lol happens to the best of us, did it work? Sometimes you just have to keep rotating it to find a good spot. And sometimes it just won’t work
---
I get 477 DR but it's useless. No idea how it works in Fallout games but level 10 supermutants can still kill me if they are like 4-5 of them
---
And with the new player vendor system, I definitely need more storage space in the container..
---
I had a two shot Gatling and a two shot Handmade drop within a few minutes of each other last night.
---
You good bro
---
Very interesting post! Thank you for this. Institute rules!
---
Yea but unless there are official statements about modding beeing allowed i wont Do it.
---
Would love to increase weapon_viemodel fov and mod the PA hud
---
Its odd to see super mutants in appalachia considering that the ones from mariposa havent reached full population.
---
Very true. If you are going for a vats build concentrated fire is one of the better damage boost perk cards.
---
What does scaly skin do?
---
I know this is a sensitive topic for a lot of people in the subreddit, so I don't really want to argue. I just didn't really care, personally. To me, it was just a quick photo attached to a ticket. No, it really didn't make sense because like you said, the copy was clearly already on my account. But at the same time, getting mad about it now, almost 5 months later, does me nothing, y'know?
---
I'm just replying to the thread to give you the answer to your question in the OP.
---
That’s fair.
---
But why would you mind how I enjoy the game? Because of survival? There’s an easy fix, people with this option turned on can’t enter survival.
---
Anyway, it doesn’t really matter because this game is all about TSE.
---
Thanks for the comment and info good sir! This makes me think that if you start to see legendaries dropping with effects that you don't want all you have to do is pop servers and hope for the best that there's ones you want dropping on not 1. Just a thought.
---
It's a mutation that gives you armor at the expense of AP .
---
If it wasn't for Fo76 we would never know that before all that there was:
---
Oct 2102 - SCREEEEEEEEEEECH
---
so, you are saying I should get my MIRV Fatman out and the instant final wave begins to spam fire it?
---
Gotcha.
---
Is it worth it?
---
Also don't forget those grape mentats to boost them sales 😉
---
No problem friend, enjoy the wasteland!
---
I want you to suffer like everyone else.
---
I have the same question
---
I may have to try that. I admit I stuck around for awhile because of this.
---
I wonder if it's the same one I did see selling 40-50 x-01 mods for 500 caps each.
---
Same. Had several trouble shooters and suppressors drop all in a row last night. Naturally couldn’t be lucky and get bloodies or AA.
---
Highly depends on your build, for me it's worth it.Up to you if armor is more important than AP.
---
No, it's most likely a mule my mule has about 30 or so legendary items on it. I have an awful problem with hoarding in this game
---
With Uny set and Hard Bargain i get no bonus from grape mentats. Or maybe i didn't notice.
---
The backpack gives plus 90 and scaly guves plus 50.  I'm getting +30 from evasive  and + 45 from barbarian.   Add in bodyguard perk when I'm playing with my group and you can add another +12 dr per player up to +36
---
Indeed yes..
---
When I'm in a group my DR is over 500 which makes it up there with some of the power armors
---
There’s no suffering whatsoever.
---
The only suffering is the several cap limits.
---
I’m drowning on food and drinks, tbh I’m drowning on everything, it’s pathetic.
---
Lol makes me wish I had 2 playstations
---
 I recommend West-Tek facility , Uranium Fever event, A violent night event. 
---
   It's really easy to make caps now and i think it's funny that people still find hard to believe someone having more than 5K caps at once.
---
Keep checking here for any updates/news ==&gt; [Fallout-76 News](https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/)
---
It's not a huge bonus in fairness, but if you're harvest them sweet sweet caps every extra is always nice. Also selling nuka cola instead of drinking it for the solitary cap. I guess it depends on how desperate a player needs that serum...
---
I had that encounter too. I just stood there waiting for him to finish all his dialogue. He then went hostile after giving me a final warning and attacked me.
---
He then killed himself because of my mutations.
---
Sadly, my partners and friends just give me reminders like "the daily challenges will be rolling over again soon" ;)
---
629/494/4. Im still maxing evasive perk too.
---
I haven't found a bandit bot yet he sounds fun
---
I think it also might really just depends on the server you're playing on to. After I made this post yesterday I hopped over to one of my friends servers and didn't have the issue once and played for 4 hours. Rape before I made that post I froze up 4 separate times in under an hour. Literally a hit-or-miss situation it looks like. I am trying to be hopeful that when the legendary vendor gets fixed in today they also change some stability things. However I'm also able to recognize that a lot of these problems probably won't get fixed or addressed until they drop patch 9.5 in a week or 2 when they give us Arctos pharma dungeon
---
Said it before and I'll say it again: the building/camp system needs a patch entirely of its own. Probably more than one.
---
Oh, wow. I'm glad you posted then, because you seem to have missed a game mechanic built into game called a crafting system.
---
If you go to a weapons bench, you can craft weapons of various levels that do different amounts of damage.
---
I understand its easy to miss, but I hope this helps you in the future.
---
You can even mod your weapons and armour to do different things and have different features, just in case you missed that too.
---
Or this means war by avenged sevenfold. Sorry guys rock but here and pretty excited for everything to come with this game
---
😂 You just wasted my time and your time just trying to be funny. 👏
---
Pretty sure there's downvote bots hitting every post.  Everyone seems to be as confused as you as to why they get downvoted.
---
Please don't share this video. Bethesda and this sub are well aware of this particular exploit. All your post is doing is showing new people how to do it.
---
I sell all my two shots they're not worth keeping
---
I’ve seen some legit landmarks too, impressive!
---
Yes! This too indeed!
---
the only problem at the moment I think is that they can't update your custom.ini, you have to manually add the new files they add when they patch the game and i'm not sure they'll ever be able to kinda edit your custom.ini. its something you have to do manually, copy the names of the files so they load. until there is some sort of mod manager that can edit the ini for you.
---
Depends what he is selling....if it is lots of the same ultra-rare drops, then probably highlight to bethesda to investigate and track what they are doing. Bethesda just need to take a record of what items they have on Monday and then check again on Wednesday and see what has changed....how many caps, how many \*\*\* items etc.
---
Then they can send a notification that they are under investigation for suspicious activity, and then go from there.
---
That would be my idea if I worked for Bethesda FO76 team
---
Just mix and matched stuff that gives me more strength for my build. Nothing special.
---
That's the one. Thanks for the info!
---
Btw, great idea to link the video...
---
11am est or whatever timezone your in
---
I would love to respec just 1 time. As I played the previous Fallout games, I was always a high charisma person. So, when I created my toon for Fo76, I added extra points in charisma. Bad decision, as I didnt realize that a majority of perk cards for charisma were meant for team based perks. Thay sucked because at one time , my charisma was so high, I didnt even have enough charisma cards to equip. So I played with unused perk points. Damn, I shouldve researched better and remade my character. But the game really sucked at that time, so I didnt want to start from scratch again.
---
Wow you must be stupid for spreading this even further
---
I have that piece of paper for sale in the vending machine: 9999 caps: "You have been insulted".
---
This totally! Been horrible for quite some time and it's extremely painful at times especially when you get surrounded.
---
Thats why i always carry a pipe pistol
---
.38 doesnt weigh anything  (with bandolier) and then i tag them and leave them for others to tag/kill
---
Take photos of the actual rides
---
More annoying will be today posts about legendary vendor. Let's bet, how much of them will be here.
---
You have to move around while looking at it, once the name of what you are taking a picture of shows up in the top right corner of the screen while you’re zoomed in, snap your photo. It took me a little while to get it just right so it would count.
---
Please don’t! I often play with my kiddo and he’d be crushed if he got reported for selling stuff I gave him.
---
There are OODLES of “Santa Clauses” in the game - you’ve probably been one or benefitted from one. That’s probably how they got their goods.
---
Well, main plot quests have static loot, but dailies (they're quests, not events) can reward with rare outfits and plans. As an example I've been rewarded with Tattered Field Jacket for Play Time (Daily quest in the Mire).
---
I'm so addicted to the game. The new legendary vendor comes out today and I can't wait.
---
That's expected. When you have a charisma in the high 20/30 range grape mentats doesn't add much if anything. You are already at the max for how much additional caps you can negotiate.
---
Yea im really torn if i wanna mod 76 or not...
---
Lol just found out today if you crouch while having your weapon wheel out it crahses your game.
---
Ok so do I take the photo of the billboard and how do I zoom in (ps4)
---
Yup it was teased in the road map, it'll be introduced in the summer and will be a reset that'll also give you new things (they didn't said what though...)
---
Then give us a scouts badge for doing it, and win win.
---
I have noticed the same kind of pattern. Last week, I got a two shot 10mm smg, and a two shot cryolator within 30 minutes of each other.
---
This week, it's Beserkers, and troublemaker items for me.
---
West Tek, uranium fever, and Harper's ferry are my go to locations for this. I can get my 1400 caps  in less than 30 minutes.
---
Actually was at whitesprings today and every door had a concrete slab on it. Took so long to load the doors I circled it once before it rendered.
---
Bethesda already implemented a provisional fix for this days ago, by making the NPCs you had to interact with in a constant "busy" mode.
---
~500. Any Forbiden Knowledge apparel is pretty common.
---
Take this down...... you’re not helping.
---
I get those triple SB’s once a day. They make a damn racket! You might have more fun posting on /r/fo76filthycasuals
---
If you like, I can join you, and show you where to point your camera.

I came across a camp earlier with 1500 plasma cores is it.  For 2 caps each.  I tried to buy them all and it gave an error (trade failed on server or something like that).  Tried to buy half, error.  Bought 1 and it worked.  Did that twice more, and they all vanished.   ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯
---
Ok. Thx again.
---
Good point .. always put a switch on the shower,
---
I use a pressure plate to activate the shower and my shower is next to the vending machine ,so if you wanna shower you can  ,if you don't ... Don't...
---
Like around noon if you est
---
I'm gonna take a risky guess and say at least 1.
---
Use rank 2 of Happy Camper and you should be fine.
---
It already had 18000 views the damage has been done. Its a old exploit that some how got messed up with the last patch. Its everyones job to report issues and not keep quite about them.
---
Finally someone with answers.
---
 [More than 5 already.](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/search/?q=legendary%20vendor&amp;restrict_sr=1&amp;t=day&amp;sort=new)
---
be careful with mutations though. diluted radX is fine.
---
Sadly, most people in most homes don't really give a shit how the light looks, as long as they can see, and its cheap. Its pretty much only photographers and interior decorators (aka fallout camp builders) that care about that kind of stuff.
---
18,000 views really isn't that many, all you are doing is (probably intentionally) spreading methods that ruin the game.
---
Making sure even more people see it is just dumb idea when you can open support ticket and send link directly to bgs
---
I've already come across several players who had a dozen purifiers but locked them all. They must be really thirsty if they need to hog all that water.

---
You want vanguard stuff then. Other end of the spectrum from bolstering gear.
---
There are spawn locations for magazines online. what spawns there is random, and whether it spawns there on that server is also random
---
He can now offer you a "gift" in a box though.
---
If we can dupe a handmade, we can dupe a post. :)
---
If he licked,  the golden poison frog(Phyllobates terribilis), has enough toxin on average to kill ten to twenty men or about ten thousand mice.  All others cause diarrhea.
---
After taking cover he remembered he was a melee build. Classic!
---
Duuddee I was just about to post about that last night. That would be orgasmic! Imagine that server strain tho XD.. I was also thinking it would have been probably better if 76 came out on next gen, to loosen some limitations probably, but it just may be on the same engine and stuff but who knows.
---
I’d want to play
---
There are lots of different spawn points, so you may not have been in a wrong spot at all.  It's just sucky RNG.
---
report his ass dopping ass.
---
I love finding radium rifles because they're usually heavily modded and always sell for great caps at the robot vendors.
---
Put a SSD in my Ps4 slim. There is a difference ...  Everytime our team go into Apalachia ,I always get out first ,even if I got out last . There a difference of 5-7  seconds .  
---
The problem with the hardware is that it does not use the SSD at his full speed    you need like a PS4 pro to get full advantage . 
---
The SSD does not make any noises ,and doed not get as hot like a normal drive . 
---
It's worth the €70 I did pay for a 500Gb
---
I saw him near the raider camp by the broken space station. His title is just Mr Handy until you talk to him, then it changed and he says it’s a stick-up. He never actually attacked me or tried to steal my stuff though. I killed him anyway because he threatened me though...
---
What’s your ign? I’ll friend you

Nice! so it means, your point 8 could be a connection to my discovery about a possible future DLC:

I'd love to do some quest on that oilrig!
---
10 critters in the savage divide is not photomode. It’s camera. I completed it today that’s how I know.
---
That would explain why my Furious handmade sucked in vats vs my FE combat rifle. Crit commando build. I still use it when I have enough 5.56 stashed. 
---
The damage is good on the Furious handmade though.
---
500-2k caps depending who is selling
---
Whitesprings is the only flat part of the entire map and its prone to nukes lol
---
^ I second this
---
it will also happen if you stay in a server that your camp can not be place, when you get to place it back down the machines will be empty
---
@kreiggles - look forward to seeing ya!
---
Melee is a nuisance because their bucket-headed lead-steel asses block your shots for tagging.
---
One last question, you on pc Xbox or PlayStation, I’m on Xbox
---
They don’t even have to do that much to make a lot of people happy. Just make available a lot more of the settlement pieces from Fallout 4 (we don’t even have circular metal pieces. Why?), fix the powered doors (it’s been months guys. They’re just back to front. Surely not that hard), give us proper interior walls, give us glass roof pieces to make greenhouses and give us planters (which are already in the game!) 
---
That’s just off the top of my head. There’s really a lot more.
---
Yeh did that. No joy I'm afraid
---
Don’t you have to take a picture of the actual ride? Not the billboard
---
So In real life if you came out of Vault 76 on your own I doubt you would have time or resources too build a perfect home.
---
Yeah I found it finally now to do the swim test
---
Yeah good luck :( you and all of us.  Server hopping for sure.  I’m putting them off all the way until the end. Hopefully I’ll find one or 2 on my own
---
Now that's awesome!
---
Yeah it’s sad :(
---
Yeah.    We need  better notifications.  It's frustrating you need to check the map constantly
---
I just wish visitors would close the damn doors and Bethesda would stop spawning shit inside my house when folks fast travel in
---
Well believe it or not, i have only gotten bloodied weapons for two days.
---
&gt;  I was unable to find one on the Fallout wikis?
---
The fallout wikis are, unfortunately, about the worst place to look for information on FO76.
---
I agree :)  No one really said anything smart about your comments of vendor having identical armors and weapons.
---
Nobody wears power armor in PvP because normal armor with legendaries can be so much better.
---
We were doing this all day long few months ago, then everyone from our group stoped playing and now i can't farm even one fuking queen a day. It good to know, there are still groups who farm them.
---
Can you post a link to your build? Very interested
---
No kidding. And, I think it will give a bit of faction-ish feel that the game could use a bit of.
---
All of these people asking for cosmetics to make their C.A.M.P. look more like their home, meanwhile I just want to make a warehouse or military base...
---
My kid has used a mouse and keyboard on playstation 4, but not every keyboard worked. A corsair keyboard did not work, but a less fancy logitech one worked fine.

Attach wires being tied to the jump command (*on PC at least*) is one of the single dumbest decisions ever.
---
Super impressive
---
Im running a full vanguard sentinel armor set as well
---
 Xbox One is getting support through preview program, but doesn’t mean all games support it in general, so you’ll probably just have to get used to using a controller like people normally do when they play a lot.
---
Vendors. That’s where I’ve been seeing a bunch anyways
---
They did mention the change in the patch notes, last week I think?
---
You should!  I'd love to see another idea on the place. :)
---
Go for watoga, cafe behind bos vendor, then monorail station, and then the roof of the hotell. I get 3-6 magazines per two server hops
---
I dont think there will be downtime. They are just going to turn the vendor on like the fas'nacht parade and the tunnels under harpers ferry.
---
Literally Pain Train
---
I’ve seen reports of certain circumstances where characters disappear but it has to do with loading into a world where your camp can’t be placed. At the same time the other camp taking “your” spot despawns because the player logged off. This results in a freeze and when you restart your character disappears. None of that happened to me. 
---
I did note that all the Atom Shop stuff I previously unlocked was still unlocked for the new character. The number of Atoms available to purchase items was also the same. Challenge progression (build x number of grenades, scrap x number of armor) are showing up as well.  So some data is there, but the two characters are not.  
---
I did open a ticket so keeping fingers crossed that something can be recovered. Bad comes to worse I’ll just have to work my way back up. At least I’ll know what to avoid this time.
---
This.
---
They give you loot for the event as well as the loot from the body
---
Its insults are also pretty brutal. Like telling you're a useless pos in the world.
---
Nope +120
---
Also interested
---
Look at this guy, giving out updates like they are upvotes!
---
Maybe Hero of the Wasteland statue would be a good king with the Dealthclaw being a knight. Or an aluminium tree would be an okay rook while the Mothman statue takes the knight role. *Or* Vault Boy as knights and the 50 atom skull totems as pawns.
---
I never participated in the beta and I'm on a new character created after P6 on PC; still a bunch of locations didn't unlock for this new character, such as Cranberry Glades and Grafton Steel.
---
Bought ones don't count.
---
In the brotherhood quest, Heart of the Enemy, you read a terminal entry by a scribe by the name of Grant McNamara. I know this has been brought up a few times before. but I like to think he is related to Elder Nolan McNamara from new vegas. I doubt it could of been random. Unless it is and both bethesda and obsidian like the name McNamara for some reason.  I am glad to see these little connections, I wonder if there are any more we have yet to uncover. and if not well, I hope they can add more without putting the whole timeline into question.
---
Alright.
---
Damn. That stinks
---
Oh ok, hopefully, so you didn’t see anything on your Fo76 home screen on the top right?
---
That works for me when it says “nothing is selected” but otherwise... nope.
---
Maybe wait for the actual update to happen...🤔
---
what I always recommend look at other peoples places then just keep learning from them till you can use all that accumulated ideas to make your own unique builds
---
This will definitely happen to a good amount of travelers, haha.
---
the green fold out tent at the responder airport / the quonset huts at the same airport would all be grand as well since it would give people a few prefab structures to work with and help new players / people who don't do camp building to still have a nice looking place
---
according to datamined list, there are no legendary PA from her, although legendary PA have been added to the game files, but not to her
---
You dont need to buy more than one copy of the game.
---
 My stepdaughters have the PS4 as well.  They both have an account. 
---
I am the only one that has purchased the game but all 3 of us can play.  Only one of them at a time time.
---
 You can very easily have a mule account without paying an extra dime
---
Theyre up now fam, shes in the game
---
30 legendaries a day isn't that hard if you know what/where you're looking for, before some of the patch changes to legendaries, watoga was a prime farming spot. Server hop, and repeat in most places.
---
puɐןʇoɔs ɯoɹɟ oןןǝɥ
---
No kidding? Bethesdas notes suggested another 10am release. Did they not follow that?
---
They updated one receiver. It seems like some shortsightedness on their part. Every other refined receiver does more than the base model.
---
It’s all that f’ed up terrain. It’s beautifully designed and recreated Appalachian scenery, but it’s a bitch to place and snap those defensive walls.
---
EoT for all ballance change ideas: if you are not within the most efficient PvP league, you are by definition and default wrong. Saying that game only has 3 or 4 viable weapons is exactly the same thing as admitting you dont know this game. Saying everybody runs in x01 is like admitting you have never encountered good player yet.
---
Can I join ?
---
I seem to remember someone saying something like that ages ago. Like each server has a set number of legendary affixes that it drops and if you find one you like you should farm legendaries on that server before doing any server hopping.
---
I'd assume usual server downtime, but we'll probably get a notification later this morning like usual
---
I can't say for Xbox as I don't own one but PS4 does not support M&amp;KB natively for FO76 but you can get an adapter to make it work.
---
Oof! That I do not know. A guy in a Facebook group had screenshots but cant confirm myself
---
There were no updates for the fasnacht parade and the tunnels under Harper's ferry so there might not be maintenance today.
---
 They will probly just turn him on.
---
One request I have is, if for some reason the fast travel point is inside your home, don't lock the doors. The only way I managed to escape one today was because I could jump higher with my mutation and the roof was open. I was almost annoyed enough to not buy that bird bones serum. But, it was gift.
---
2hours serverhoping whitespring golfclub. Did you realy thought i am serious?
---
Oh I forgot about this. What's the base damage with all the rifleman perks and a .50 Cal receiver now?
---
I have still to use a single one. Sell sell sell!
---
The downvotes: there a bunch of kids who enjoy it. It means nothing. Meaningless clicks in a meaningless existence.
---
No problem, took me hours of server hopping to get mine
---
Thing is, many people will be in my position - too much to do on the weekend but can spare an hour at night during the week once the kid is asleep. Plans are a huge aspect of this game. Finding new ones and building up my camp is what keeps me coming back. That would encourage sales in the long run. And it's good for us payers too to have people to buy our stuff, people to quest with, and generally have the world feel more populated. Large scale raids requiring a dozen or more people would actually be viable then.
---
I currently live in a train cart on the track. If I can keep my camp place I’m totally down 😆  Nice thinking! All in-puts on new content is lovely
---
1400 caps just for selling enemy weapons?
---
I do this and then equip scrapper and turn all that lovely steel into ammo and sell it on here... the copious amount of plastic you get from lasers also sells super quick too.
---
Wholesome as fuck.
---
Yep.
---
It'd be fun to see how my luck is. Can't be worse than the 3 3* rolling pins I've gotten.
---
Is it confirmed that she's in game atm? Her place is around harpers farey right?
---
You could build like one of the Roman "pooperias" even! It could be a Daily Challenge even! "Poop with four friends". The possibilities are indeed endless.
---
I don’t want to have to pay to either play this aka for server reasons or for better things for an advantage like you stated. Higher cap limit, higher stash, perks are major benefits that could mess with the currency balance. That’s one thing I’ve never liked about games like WoW. I paid for the game, I pay for PS Plus, I can’t afford to pay for this and I don’t want to feel like I’m at a disadvantage. You already see what people charge to buy better weapons and armour and plans and stuff. We all paid, it should be fair.
---
Lol, I'm excited to see what players get but I also don't want to sort through a hundred of the same post.
---
Not to mention the glitches with trying to milk Brahmin for the tadpoles badge or the turret issues.
---
I think it has to do with some potential exploit using vending machines. I had an issue when I logged into a very unstable server and after I logged out and logged back in all my items were unlisted.
---
I just found out the transperent overlay pip-boy... changed my life. If i recall (am at work), its not green.
---
I killed 8 with one Molotov does that count?
---
Unfortunately, it is bugged. For example, I can't complete "play an instrument at Watoga High School, the Rusty Pick and acoustic guitar" steps.
---
10 or 11 EST is standard for updates
---
Hey watch it buddy, that's my home you're talking about!
---
I was on last night (XB1) and I did notice some anomalies but nothing to degrade the performance to the degree you encountered.
---
You on PS4?
---
No raids announced for today, just a new legendary vendor.
---
Many of the musician challenges are bugged. It's not just you. Maybe they'll fix it today.
---
10 or 11 EST so about 3 hours from now this sub will blow up with Purveyour post
---
Darn right. I once sold a non legendary assault rifle off an enemy for 75 caps. It may take a few rounds of run through to get your 1400 caps but you can also use that time to hunt for legendary mobs. I prefer harpers ferry because their is a vendor right there, even if it doesnt yield as many weapons as West Tek. So I dont worry about being 600lbs overweight with loot.
---
Let's get this man those plans!
---
Me too.....😔
---
Water is avoidable.
---
But having the perk allows you to go certain places and do certain things without thinking about it. A lot of places in the mire and cranberry bog, as well as southern savage divide have large areas of water, but otherwise it's not a big deal.
---
But you can milk his Brahmin!
---
I smell a chainsaw and a big Resident Evil 7 reference. 
---
Did ya rike it?
---
An abandoned train station(forgot the exact name) in the mire.
---
Whatcha talkin’ bout Willis?
---
This can happen in Whitesprings, probably did too.
---
You know that's just a skin for the backpack listed under paint.
---
Apropriate latin name *terriblis*.
---
bummer:/
---
Personally I'd love for energy to get a burning and radiation effect specific to energy weapons.  The problem is they won't have a demolition perk type card to buff the damage which is what makes explosive effects insane anyways.
---
Quick tutorial: the wall pass through conduits look kinda like this "{" where there is one middle height connector, and 2 snap points for more Condit pieces. The half height piece is what goes through the wall with the snap points on the floor or ceiling. 
---
Floor and ceiling pass through also only work right on flat surfaces. I've got thoroughly frustrated trying to run conduit into angled roofing.
---
Oh Berkeley Springs Station.
---
please form an orderly cue
---
I'm hoping they add new damage type to the secondary legendary pool in general. Cryo, Plasma Infused, and Incendiary were a ton of fun in Fallout 4 and it'd break things up from the distinctive look and sound of explosive bullets I hear from every player.
---
No idea if “luck” is going to play a part or just RL luck but I’m taking no chances so il be popping on a shielded vault 76 jumpsuit, chugging down some iguana soup, popping a day tripper or xcell, equipping happy go lucky and having a beer, if that doesn’t get me something good I don’t know what will lol 😂😂😂 saving thread btw so I can be nosey and see how everyone else does, good luck everyone 🍀
---
Nothing a creepy uncle can't solve.
---
I need an adult.
---
Same, have not seen them in a very long time and would love them back. [PC]
---
I do that too, but I need that ammo to keep me killin things with my auto handmade. So it doesn't go into the resale market. I guess thats why I have 12,000 rounds of 5.56 on me right now.
---
Only if that team member placed the statue in the first place, and only till they leave the team!
---
inb4 "Colonel, I'm trying to sneak around but I'm dummy thicc"

^(but i did it first.)

It's already patched in. It'll go live when the dailies/atomic shop refreshes.
---
LINE UP FOR YOUR SPANKINGS!!!!!
---
In addition to serums, you can farm mutations by simply unequipping the perk in radiation and putting it back on to remove radiation, repeat as you like. there is a very good spot to do this in blackwater mine, there is a radioactive pool of water, and just inside the entrance on the right coming in there is a rad arch you can use to cure your radiation, beware that it will remove all your mutations in less than a second if you forget starched genes.
---
Beakeley spring
---
Yeah I'm not sure what they did, but they didn't buff *all* .50 cal receivers like they should have.
---
Really? Thatd be nice
---
deserving of my attention and upvote
---
Mirelurk Queen cheated, poison damage is currently bugged and can do an absurd amount of damage.
---
Tried again at the nukashine this morning to see if anything had changed but no, piano, snare drum and playing at the nukashine won’t work for me, only one I have ticked off is play the bass
---
Forgot metal walls. Those things are the best walls/foundations.
---
Let's get interior cells to our own camps.
---
 As a natural mutant of the wastes, these camps bug me. I deliberately don't starch my genes so i can "twist my dna like a kitten with a ball of yarn" at any opportunity. I now also have to throw on starched genes on the off chance i fast travel into a shower while shopping.
---
They stop you from falling off if you build high up.
---
I have a be, ve and aae handmade that I never use because I make too many caps selling 5.56 ha! I just use my laser ha
---
I was about to build one at the enterance of my camp. Then another post stated that he had a build that uses mutations but no starched genes.
---
I am aware of such predicaments and will adjust my design idea accordingly. 
---
I got you covered bro.
---
Nope, nor heard anything about it since
---
Considering there are outhouses, toilets, and porta potties everywhere. Coupled with the fact that scorchbeast shit is everywhere especially Watoga I think you're on to something maybe a possible future dlc.
---
Happens all the time (at least since P5 when I started tracking my drops). We don't exactly know the logic, but based on data, the game temporarily boosts item and legendary effect chances when you pick up/hold/stash items. It is most noticeable with armor drops where either I keep getting the same effect, or different effect but the same armor item. This "magic" wears off after a bit or when you sell/drop/scrap the item.
---
Unfortunately, this boost has an adverse effect on loot variability if you keep to much stuff. For example, I've been hoping for a Ghoul Slayer's Handmade for like months now and with a thousand drops, still none. I'm getting Handmades and Ghoul slayer's items but not together. I have all sorts of Handmades and all sorts of Ghoul Slayer items.
---
no it's not you just need a special kind of royal jelly there's two kinds one that goes into your junk and one that goes into your aid
---
If white powder jumpsuits are rare, then I'm afraid to tell you... but I believe I scrapped or sold the only one I had.
---
I’ve moved my camp the full 76 times now 😬

Yeah. We need a sticky, but we need the Murmrgh drinking game: 
---
* For every piece of legendary wood armor, take a drink (and post to Reddit) 
---
* For every ghoul slayer gamma gun, take a drink (and post to Reddit)
---
* For every amazing item-that-used-to-be-duped, take a drink (and post to Reddit)

* For every drill, take a drink (and post to Reddit)

* For every legendary scout armor, take a drink (and post to Reddit)

Have fun out there and for safety's sake, do your drinking in game.

I hated the one time I happened to spawn in someone’s shower.
---
The time it took to load me in I lost all my precious rads :(
---
I'd be worried that if they did that they would wind up messing around with the camp as well!
---
I do have a switch and also a rear entrance.
---
Mutants arewelcome to enter via the rear!!
---
If your prices are too high, I shit on your bed. I get in and I shit on the bed. Period. No matter what.
---
I will shit on your bed if your prices are too fucking high.
---
I'm going for the lucky dip. It's cheaper and I'm guessing will be worth it. I just hope that the drop chances for the items are the same
---
That’s exactly my build 😂
---
Haven't been on since last night. They might have some small updates but those usually happen on tuesdays.
---
 I'd love to see more love to hair in general. Thick swinging dreads, the fallen angel hair from 3 and NV, disco funkadelic fro, spiked hair styles, or iconic styles like the silver temples look some men develop as they age.
---
Is this game playable yet?
---
The lever action only has 5 rounds tho
---
You can also drum on the barrel in the frat house in Morgantown, but it's not a CAMP object. I think there's another instrument, but I can't remember (it's early lol)
---
make sure to get hacker 3 and turn all robots against each other, just wait it out and let them all kill each other.
---
My guess is legendary PA comes from the raids, it has to have some kind of reward, right ?
---
I have scrip burning a hole in my deep pocketed and would love to blow it all on the lucky dips so I’m hoping you can buy more than one a day or it will be torture lol
---
Psn? I'll hit your shop later.
---
Uranium fever normally yields me about 1000 caps, I literally loot every mole miner body for everything, scrap my junk.. sell every shotgun gauntlet and assault rifle I find. I do have to crawl out of there with about 900 pounds on my body but it’s not a bad walk!! Run thru whitesprings after that, grab all the chems I can find off the ghouls.. all gold outfits and golf skirts and I got my 1400 caps for the day
---
So cool :)
---
I really hope so. I have other challenges that are bugged too and my vending machine's inspect item option doesn't work if I'm not in my CAMP.
---
Not worth going full unyielding IMO, but the +6 gives boosts to carry weight, VATS range, AP points, crafting durability, sell/sale prices, and any related luck bonuses. It's been a good balance for my rifleman build, PER/INT/AGI/LCK are all 20+.
---
I am hunting for a decent railway rifle. When I find one, that will be my farming weapon. No more need for lead or gunpowder.
---
Didn’t know!
---
I think I know which instrument you’re talking about. Would love to place that as well
---
(Early for me as well)
---
Well i guess i have to do the same then since i still can't find anyone to rez.
---
Same here.
---
Dragonmite4  think I only have one or two left just got home and will be on in a bit
---
I made double sure people travelling to my camp would spawn in the shower.
---
I will purge every one of you radiated scum bag bloodied builds if it's the last thing I do.
---
Lol
---
Half of the loot table is Armor and the other half is about 50:50 melee and ranged.
---
You can’t build the accordion either- also we need a trumpet and a violin at the very least.
---
I've been using the Canned Food you find in the Flatwoods Bar as a substitute, but I'd like to see the MRE's return.
---
May I come too?!
---
Sorry Just the Vendor
---
OP's name checks out though 😆
---
Is there an accordion in the game already?
---
But yeah I do agree!
---
Or a pressure plate, that way you won't get server lag from some savage leaving it on!
---
Amazing building skills.
---
Honestly, because the title looks like you're a rep from some cap-selling site posting to try and advertise your great customer service or something.
---
For chrissake it's one of the few challenges that doesn't require a one in ten thousand plasma grenade plan drop or a one in 100 hours appearance of the mothman
---
😂
---
I guess that would make sense, got me all excited
---
So much this! It's really frustrating that it's been an issue for so long.
---
Also Bethesda PLEASE fix the wiring issues, time and time again I press E to place and nothing happens.  Seriously wiring up a complex base in 76 is like making sweet love to your partner in bed, only your outside the window using a fishing pole blindfolded and drunk.
---
People who use explosive legendary guns are weak willed cowards. Let them have their easy mode.
---
I'd trade a lot if they made a trading app or a message system in game. I'm not even talking about a phone app. Search for items and trade in game without being in the same server or even on at the same time. I'd even be ok if the charged higher tarriffs for this because of the convenience.
---
Do they? For me they just take the damage and walk right over!
---
Today is a say when a lot of ppl are gonna get dissapointed

---
Go to camps... they will most likely have it somewhere
---
It really depends for me. I got troubleshooter's, junkie's and hunter's in one imposter event. And random encounters always yielded mutant's. So it depends if it's event based or random encounter. At least for me.
---
My group did this the last two nights. Record for killing queen is 3m
---
Sold out one magazine left sorry. Cleaned me out yesterday
---
It’s all the instruments for me, not just those two.
---
I dropped something just to see what would happen, and got he said something along the lines of “much appreciated, now get lost” and I stood there waiting to see if he’d pick up the item. He didn’t, just got aggro after a bit

Anti-Materiel Rifle, but as a 4 unique variants to match FoNV changeable magazines:

---
\- Anti-armor

\- Explosive

---
Sorry, sometimes I don't pick up subtle sarcasm, it's just that after a lot of these patches it is harder to farm them. I usually try to go after the static spawns. Like the Super mutant behemoth
---
I love that you are doing this for your lady!
---
Guys hyped up with explosive effect....you ever tested a ffr weapon? Explosive is pure out shit compaired
---
There is a Random event that has 3 SB's.
---
Once I was running away from 5 Mirelurk Kings and ran into group og Super mutants fighting these 3 SB's. They of course forgot their own quarrel and all three groups focused on me. Happy times.
---
Not just jumping, you have to RUUUUNN and hope the camp doesn't spawn quickly!
---
Don't forget to put up the rules of Chess club.
---
For example, always introduce yourself to your opponents, shake hands before and after the game and accept a loss gracefully, no more shooting or stabbing of opponents (Survival servers excluded), and blowing up chess pieces is strictly prohibited/encouraged (house rules apply).
---
Give me locs or give me death

we really need a Fallout 76 circlejerk sub, could be proper funny
---
I’m very happy with my 2/3 cabin - I put a lot of work onto decorating it and making it fit with theme and terrain.
---
I actually had someone tell me they thought it was an in game structure - which was ludicrous but I took the compliment
---
The Overseers room in Sutton, at her parents house.
---
For the main character I'll be playing for a while, I do have 4 unlocked water purifiers that if you manage to get to, then you can take all the water your want.  Vendors, Stash and a Tinker Workbench are outside for easy use/access, and I even have a safe(as in overworld object, not one I can build) I can store stuff in for people to take if they find it.
---
Only thing I'll apologise for is the stupid design of the house.
---
That's why I swap to a weightless TSE shotgun on my Melee build. Does terrible damage but mostly hits everything for tag when it doesn't fire 90 ° shots. Wish I could find a Weightless Tesla. Also wish the game just automatically treated every event participant as a group member like GuildWar2 does.
---
There's a drum you hold to play it (can't remember name) in a few places too, that we can't craft.
---
Well, the new Tomb Raider games have hair physics down pretty good

No don’t do it!  That’s what’s going on this week - if you don’t want to talk about it go someplace else.

Drinking too much Brahmin Milk should give you the Lactose Intolerant mutation. -Charisma, -Stealth; +Gassy

No problem. I find out you still can get 7legendaries per one non-nuked golf clubhouse clear, for scrips it is probably best place. If you want better drop west-tek is best.
---
Filed under useful info...
---
Thanks friend!
---
Thank you. I need that damn Crimson Flux to get some new recipes.
---
Also when we're at that, i really want a brick set window with closeable shutters like the wood ones have.

Sorry, but no. Having the citizens of America being radioactive mutants is not in the best interests of those of us who are trying to rebuild America.
---
The drum (not snare) is outside the Welsh train station. Sounds cool too
---
365/460 with armor and 220/200 without. I notice a bit of a difference between the two but not much to be honest. Power armor definitely feels like it has some hidden factor reducing damage beyond DR itself. My armor is all Cavalier however so while sprinting I take almost no damage.
---
&gt;Tattered mole mask &amp; outfit 5-10k 
---
Why are these rare? These spawn reliably in-game and are easy to find.
---
It's gonna be a hard hangover.
---
People will troll with them. They will place them in a room you can’t get out of, or they place them so you fall off a cliff after fast traveling.
---
Guessing you were a hall monitor or teachers bestie at school. Stop being a snitch and mind your own business it’s probably just an alt mule holding someones stuff.
---
Woah, a true challenge for server stability.
---
Yeah, you fail at reading comprehension. The bugs I have most issues with are bugs everyone on pc are having. I have very few CTD. Most crashes are servers dying after dropping a nuke, and it isn't just my pc or connection because I expect it at this point and always add someone from the server before hand so I can rejoin if it were only my pc, but thr majority of the times when i try to rejoin through the friends list they also had the server crash on them.
---
So no it isn't due to my pc, as this is the only game that I have had this many issues with. Not to mention I have optimised my pc exactly as Bethesda recommends. So you are just making baseless assumptions.
---
&gt;"The game type doesn't even matter when were just talking about bugs due to many different computer types" &lt;-- literally shows you don't know what you are talking about
---
Yeah you don't knkw much about programming, a program wrote in c# will act the exact same as any other game also written in c#. So comparing different style of games doesn't matter, the programming language is what is important. Not the style of the game. You're just demonstrating that you know very very little about how computer games work.

With a magazine of 6 to 9 bulltets, FFR doesn't really seem like a valid idea.. It's great for a big magazine for ballistic weaponry, but not sure it's going to work well on energy weapons.
---
I have the refined (i think) 149. on a sniper
---
the reciever plans have popped up (for me), since last week, at vendors. bought a few + a scorched for the 308. I'll bet the bot is still laughing - there's one born every minute. they were cheap tho.
---
already had the top one.
---
Not on XB1, but here's a fast and easy way I do it on PS4. Go to Grafton Steel, on the side facing the dam is like 4 large pipes, the last pipe on the left is facing a shallow end. Jump and Walla! Revive your ally, easy peasy.
---
I keep Prince on my chemistry bench, makes it seem like my character is going to do some crazy wasteland mad science with the poor lil bugger
---
Faster fire rate weapons are far more deadlier than explosive
---
We're not really talking about returning the explosive prefix for legendary laser/plasma guns, but I'm rather curious if there will be something else implemented instead.
---
Did the update come out already?
---
Oh nice I'll have to check that out, I've not had an issue with the glowing bags being hard to miss, but the balloons would be even easier to see.
---
I’ve been stuck in behind smelly folks while waiting to use the self checkout lines in real life.
---
I say if you’re gonna make folks shower to shop, throw some wick scented spice in the shampoo as well.!
---
That’s amazing, never knew about this and it’s helped me get 3 nuke zones last night, thanks!!
---
TIme. Zones. Cloud Servers do not work on your time, they work on a single time, so the clock rolled over and midnight of the New Year happened hours before you, breaking the nukes in the entire game on JANUARY 1st for the server's internal clock, even for people hours ahead at home. The nukes broke on January 1st. They were fixed on January 2nd. I have provided multiple pieces of proof as to this, you were mistaken and you're just trying to double down out of some weird stubborn pride.
---
This is kind of true. Whenever I carry a lot of one type of legendary prefix I tend to get the same prefix items. Maybe 7 or 8 times out of 10.
---
So my suspicions are correct then. Thank you for confirming they half-assed this correction.
---
Defecate, because spelling matters lolz
---
/r/fallout76settlements

Try to get a quad ffr weapon , would be awesome dps 😁
---
What photomode?
---
Got 9/10 so far **with** the camera...
---
Muh scripz be burnin holez in muh pockitz
---
Nah just trying to keep the game fair, meant no harm
---
supprised your having so much trouble finding one, they are pretty common
---
Oh I want to talk about it I want to know what you got I just don't want to sort through a hundred of the same post
---
Your best bet is probably to constantly check somewhere like fo76bazaar.
---
That is a very rare item and it’s not likely someone just has one sitting around waiting to sell.
---
Ohhhhh snap.  It better not have.
---
Lol, I'm expecting crap drops so I won't be dissapointed. I figure I traded in all crap so I'll get crap back. The circle of life
---
no hangover if you die from alcohol poisoning first.
---
I'll be on in 10 minutes or so, i got u. Jump off the landview lighthouse near vault 76. WyldZ3ro74
---
No, today is gonna be the day that they're gonna through it back to you.
---
Nuke Morgantown. Best place for cobalt in my opinion
---
“Rare” 
---
More like heavily duped last week.
---
Are you sure that not because you happen to also have your vending machine wired to the same switch your garage door uses?
---
The vending machine displays your camp on the map when it has power, but doesn't without. This is the first time I've ever heard someone claiming that putting your vending machine in a room with locked doors prevents the vending machine from displaying on the map even while powered.
---
Lucky you, i counted my rolling pin collection the other day and found only two 3*, the rest are all one star 😭
---
I'm going by the same dates on the subreddit, so while it may show a certain time zone there, it also shows the same time zone on the fix. Which wasn't "the next dsy" it was down for nearly a week.
---
This is fucking awesome, great job.
---
I built my camp inside railcars! It’s possible
---
This. I love a certain Youtuber who specializes in FO but his stuff is getting tiresome. I'd love to have something else to watch (and totally, definitely not cheer for).
---
I just looted a max lvl bloodied radium rifle from a sheepsquatch, trying to get better mods for it :/
---
Flashback!
---
To be honest he’s probably the greatest video game antagonist I’ve ever encountered. He reminds me a bit of Thanos - he’s trying to “save the world” and genuinely believes that what they’re doing it is the way to do it, but don’t realize how wrong it truly is. 
---
He’s a tragic villain to be sure.
---
Humour me, why should it be a guaranteed 3 star drop if you’ve killed three of them in the last couple of hours. Are you suggesting 8 hours of gameplay should arguably net you 8 god roll items?
---
Absolutely b-e-a-utiful! Thanks for the new map!!!
---
serious reply/help. the quest is popping up for me , entering cranberry bog region, but nothing comes up as a marker or event.what am I suppost to do/look for. never came up before last patch. Am I missing a trigger ?
---
I'm pretty sure it has, I was in survival a few days ago tried destroying someone's camp and nothing took damage.
---
Yeah i just expect more to scrap , if actually something good appears its a big bonus
---
https://www.captivatinghouses.com/2018/09/08/1886-castle-for-sale-in-berkeley-springs-west-virginia/
---
Grab your caps together folks!
---
I'd say Free States
---
And those dupers are on the bazaar, not here browsing new.
---
For every amazing item that’s ‘just not muh thing’, please sell it to your duper buddy today so everyone’s grandma will have one tomorrow.
---
Man I need emotional support after building on that game 🙄
---
Awwww the crybaby griefer is sad he cant pick on people? 
---
Dude go to survival and play that noise.
---
And how many actual 3 star god roll items have you had drop in all your time of play?  Even if I sat there for 8 hours doing 16 queens I’m likely to get 1.  Maybe 2.  As long as they’re 3 star I’d be happy with the scrip.
---
Well I know what I’m doing if I win the lottery
---
Was guessing that also 👍
---
Hahahaha HE WAS IN SURVIVAL trying to destroy a spawn camp.  Read slower.
---
Got another one thinking raids start today, do people  actually read the patch notes and upcoming stuff?
---
720 without pa, bolstering set and backpack
---
This happened to me. Try unequipping the camera, deselect it if it's set as a favourite, then rename it through the inspect menu and it should work. If it stops working again, just repeat the steps.
---
Quad helps a lot. I use a one-star quad tesla and it’s surprisingly effective against mobs.
---
i would think maybe BoS, Free States or the Enclave, all of them could feel pretty fitting
---
I would say he is a lone survivor, since his interactions with others are not that frequent and he is mostly on his own.
---
None, I’ve seen one 3 star in a hundred + pieces
---
Let’s wait and see how the purveyor works before we jump to requesting god roll drops. My money is that you’ll be able to purchase or roll 3 stars and it will help to eliminate duping and off-game economy
---
I'm Aussie and looking to play in a group. IGN: Harlequin5
---
I agree and neither would I, but finding one new or RNG’d is likely 1 in 1,000,000.
---
It can’t possibly be more disappointing than looting legendary enemies has already been. At least with this if it says you’re getting a 3*, you’ll actually get a 3* (I hope...)!
---
The Fasnacht Bonfires might make good Rooks. Just have to be careful not to rotate the statues when playing since theres no color differentiation!
---
I've got real good at using the wall pass through conduit. I only use it to run power out to my water purifier though
---
I think i have more than 4. I have 7 or 8. I think I got all of them from the side quests from reading the bulitin boards.  Did you do all those quests? I think there’s 6 total?
---
I'd like walls that don't clip through decorations first. Then hell yeah let me paint my walls
---
Lol. This. I'm sure they'll down vote you but people seem to regularly confuse "I want this" with "this should be" around here. 
---
Since SBQ is also generally an implied group fight, someone simply rifle tagging it while picking off low level area spawns would make them getting a guaranteed 3* seem disproportionate to the level of effort. 
---
🤷‍♂️
---
If there are legendary effects coming to PA i will buy a few skins for them right away. Not holding my breath though.
---
If i get aleast one scout armor from 15 legendaries (if you pick 3\* mama surprise), i will be super happy (drunk).
---
Agteed, killed 4 3* enemies today. Not even a single legendary item. Went back 30min later , still nothing
---
I don’t think he was necessarily requesting god roll drops.  He’s just making a good point that the queen should drop 3 star items no matter what.  I agree, I’ve probably done 200 of them and gotten like 5.
---
Yeah this is false. The building system is not intelligent enough to verify if the machine is physically reachable. I imagine you just neglected to power it.
---
It will ever so slightly. It’s not nearly the like 40% faster so it is not optimal at all. It effects power attack swing though and that’s it. I tried to measure the tick of damage over 10 seconds and the increase from 40% swing speed was less than 10% more damage.
---
Was he selling things? Maybe that’s why?  Hmmm.
---
i like the idea, i like to use the barn walls because they look good on the inside but the vibrant red color doesnt always feel fitting and would be nice to paint it different color or remove the paint completely
---
Not sure which safe, but there are safe plans with the vender in Harper's ferry and watooga train station.
---
Interesting point. I live under the highway north of watoga 😁
---
Another one in the same boat.
---
I can do these 'dailies' once per toon. That's it.
---
If I want to do them again... well, I need to 'roll' another toon.
---
Pumpkins however, no problem, I have many pumpkin seeds for j00.
---
Actually, on the subject of dailies, are there any in the Savage Divide other than the fecking pumpkins?
---
I vaguely remember a 'quest' with the Red Rocket protectron cores but I am not sure if it was a daily or a one-off thing.
---
I think this is a Graham exclusive item. That's the only place I have ever found it.
---
#metoo
---
I will try to asap :D
---
I bet your vending machines are powered with the same wire as the garage door.
---
That was obsidian's idea and Beth seems to be incredibly reluctant to touch *anything* Obsidian made... Only real reference to NV in 4 was Kelogg being from NCR territory. That's about it.
---
richard grey: the original thanos
---
I think I’ve got like 10.  Did you do the other Sheepsquatch side quests?  That’s where like 3 or 4 of them come from if I remember correctly.
---
Dead "Settler" or feral ghoul.
---
Great teamwork. Just did one and lost. I was the only one interested in doing both the pylon and the damage, all other 12 guys ‘tagged’ the sheep with a few long pews and went into hiding.
---
Yeah, if I remember correctly, there were 4 side quests on the board. I don't know if they added any new ones though. I've gotten some from the Insect Repellent quest but other than that, I don't know.
---
Yep in game mail like Wow and Swtor would be a real boon.
---
Arkos pharma should be added in wild appalachia. Where is it?
---
This!
---
They added 2 more after the first 4 I believe.
---
Yeah I did all the Sheepsquatch side quests. How did you get 10 though?
---
That's cool, i have to force myself to get rid of my 10 missile turrets to have more budget and build something huge too but...i love those lovely missiles firing around :(
---
Ooh, I'm gonna go check that out once I get home!
---
In the Australian/English version of the game. It's shown as &lt;playername&gt;'s Camp.  
---
And with the little information box that pops up when you hover over it says.  
---
VENDOR: owned by &lt;playername&gt;  
---
I'm not sure if that's any different to what your version of the game is showing compared to mine is.
---
So did I. Can we actually play them?
---
very very very cool!
---
Thanks, that explains why so many player characters I come across are using explosive guns now, I'll stick to my bloodied melee weapons I've bought from Player Vendors recently, I hate that explosive sound everywhere.
---
Thank you to everyone who replied.  If it does improve, it's a very slight difference.
---
Is this maybe a bug similar to the breakdancing ghouls?
---
3 options:
---
1) grind the game for the rest of your life.
---
2) collect 20k caps and buy a duped one.
---
3) collect 50k caps and convince someone to sell you their real one.
---
Wow that's alot, my computer is little below minium requirements but I still don't see stuff like that. Or maybe my slow computer helps, if it's more of server loading problem than rendering speed/client loading.
---
I'm afraid that wont work. A team member will be able to add pieces using their own resource but not select and displace already existing pieces.
---
Nevertheless I pray that our almighty Todd finds a workaround to this just for giant chess.
---
I hope they change it back, it's just stupid and if they have turrets they will start shooting at you but you can't destroy them.
---
Hmm, I’m not sure.  but I have these.  I may have 11 I can’t remember if there’s one more: 
---
Yao guai
---
Radstag
---
Wolf
---
Wendigo
---
Owlet
---
Bloatfly
---
Stingwing
---
Radroach
---
Bloodbug
---
Tick
---
I've seen quite a few. They drop from Ash Heap events, like Breach and Clear, Battle Bots or Lode Baring.
---
Yes, we need to be able to paint our homes regardless of what material we use. Imagine a yellow barn. A red warehouse. White bricks. Nuka Cola paint schemes, etc. 
---
It would be so nice
---
Thing is though that you can mitigate RNG already a lot just by being able to choose three stars and ranged, if a ranged three star weapon is what you want. Only berserker's and nocturnal are negative slot1 legendary effects, and firerate or explosive are still 25% and 20% dps increases.
---
You have a much greater chance of getting what you want from the vendor.
---
Sure you're not getting confused with The Division 2?
---
Yep. One in a thousand, roll for a star, risk to lose it all, that’s the way the purveyor should work
---
I have a very basic camp setup and it’s nice to see how creative and elaborate player camps are in the game.
---
You can still buy from vending machines without power  it’s just the light that doesn’t show up on the map
---
Excuse my ignorance but how does F76 have super mutants? I havent played too much F76 if the answer is in game.
---
Hmm I guess I'm just unlucky. I'll be grinding those for a while now to get it haha
---
I'm already assuming it's going to be chaos and nukes dropping on the vendor in the Mire.
---
Well I feel like a idiot now lol
---
Uhh, I mean... yeah.   
---
Why would we think otherwise at this point, knowing what we know?
---
We can maybe make a switchboard to light up the corresponding letters and cyphers using the neon sign set.
---
Although that would become as big as the chessboard itself I think.
---
That’s seems like an appropriate ratio to be honest, particularly when a dozen people can tag the queen and get a drop
---
Yes for each server the legendary pool is tiny. You’re getting RNG result from a very short list of items. Don’t ever stay on a server for too long if the first couple of items you get is junkies or nocturnal. You can have 50 3-star ghouls and they will give you the same trash. 
---
Many times I get duplicate items from one WS run. Just yesterday got two nocturnal MG42 and two junkie’s machete from one nuked WS, that tells you how small the pool is. This happened many times in the past.
---
So I got all of those except Tick, but I suppose you get Tick from the Insect Repellent quest right?
---
Free States.   
---
Hippity hoppity get off my property.
---
They can't do that until they fix dailies. The mire ones (Queen of the hunt, Play Time, Idle Explosives) are still broken - I completed them just once and now they don't trigger, no matter what....
---
Please dont, many ppl like myself have mule/alt accts that we use, hell there are ppl that have 2 playstations and play fallout 76, 1 for vending, the other for playing.
---
I know a lot of ppl are getting a justice boner for dupers, but let's not witch hunt.
---
It’s been like that since day one really.  The minute the first problems started and then poof everyone had one.  I’d like to know who patient zero was that had it drop and did this to us.  He’s probably not even banned hahaha!
---
She will only be a Berkeley. Bethesda confirmed it. "From May 16, you can exchange your hard earned script *at anytime* with the Purveyor at Berkeley Springs.
---
It's throw...not through..obviously a blur and not oasis fan lmao
---
I find it’s better the less people that are there so you may be onto something.
---
Enjoy! It's poisoned
---
Yes it's Z and C, heard it little time ago. There's nothing on screen to imply those keys have any function on that spot.
---
well dammit
---
Their vendor was active, so maybe that made them invulnerable? Nice loophole
---
Nope first and last links are my character wearing the original tin foil hat my character has the sparkly red dress on too. Middle one is the new style tin foil hat at the armor work bench after they added the tinfoil under armor to the atom shop (they changed the look of the individual tin foil hat to match the under armor)
---
I only hope we get item level fixed to character that buys the item - I really don't want low level legendaries...
---
Build a windowless room around them. Power down and build a wall when you don't want to sell. Then there's no way to get in.
---
Firefly! I got this from the pioneer daily
---
Lmao I’ve been lucky then I’ve found 3 sold 2 already for ridiculous amounts. I’ve found two off grinding this death claw it always spawns as a 3 star legendary for me In emmit mountain
---
Hahah should I be selling them for a bit if I do find them?? Is EVERY plan now available from vendors? That’s what I wasn’t too sure about
---
Are there patch notes for today yet?
---
Sadly the [Rescue Diver Suit](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Rescue_diver_suit) is not in the game yet. I kind of hate how lately they show items not being released in pictures of new content...
---
I REALLY REALLY REALLY want the vox syringer daily to WORK!!!!!!
---
All server issues on their end sadly as everyone in my group saw it. Servers are crap now and it takes so long loading in. Takes about 3 minutes for my house to render lol. Everytime I see graphic issues I pretend it's just snow. Less disappointed that way.
---
The "other locations" are the vending machines
---
Free States for sure
---
There he is. Then last innocent internet person. Look at him in all his oblivious glory.
---
I deleted post because I didn't know that and already embarrassed myself lol but as it is there is no way in if door is closed. Or someone blasts a wall out
---
Maybe! Idk though. I've literally never seen the plan for the plasma grenade. I've got every other one but if you're on Xbox and willing to sell me one I'll buy it!
---
That would be awesome. Gardener, farmer, or botanist merit badge.
---
I think it does work for me...
---
Too much paranoia in this sub. Just buy one on a trading sub or ingame. I found one in a player vendor for 7k caps. Did i worry it was duped? No.
---
Yes!  The tick comes from that one too.
---
I'm just imagining posts like "OMG the legendary vendors not at his shop" or "Some jerk hogged the vendor for half an hour while me and 5 others waited" or possibly "The legendary vendor sucks and updates like this is why I quit playing."
---
Good stuff right there.
---
Doing it the proper way, much more satisfying I'd imagine than just buying cheat items from some random dude.
---
Ooooh I don’t have that one!  Which daily the waste one??
---
That’s probably me lol. I realized this a couple of months into playing. Essentially if you don’t like what you’re getting in the first few items, hopping server might be a good idea because that server will keep dropping that prefix for you.
---
Nah I don’t know what I’ve done with them, I have a feeling I saw them in a vendor somewhere, or have already sold them real cheap :( sorry
---
Had a few trying to take life in my 312lvl so far but still kickin lol
---
This is not true however. I've participated in SBQ events where some level 350 guy brought the queen down himself in about two minutes and no one else got a drop. I certainly didn't and no one on my team did. Didn't even get credit for completing the event.
---
No the one at dolly soda if you like I can add one to your camp just add me PSN jstott81
---
Ah! Is that the quest where you collect the toxic waste and put it in a barrel?
---
No problem! I'll just grind one more thing on top of the possum badges! No biggie
---
I stand corrected. 😶
---
On a related note, if you're going to turn on someone's decon shower to use, make sure you turn it off afterwards. Not only is it incredibly rude and wasteful to leave it on, but it's terrible for the wood!
---
Making everyone the same, that sounds like communism.
---
Don't include doors or windows. Literally no way in. And don't be embarrassed if you didn't ask you wouldn't have gotten advice.
---
Also camps are immune to damage now.
---
An*
---
oh I thought I just wasn't getting close enough
---
I guarantee that's not what they said.
---
They are immune now?? That's good to know
---
I’ve legit been looking for a week.  Posted several market posts, LFG posts, even offered a few thousand caps for one.  And did 30 or so ash heap events.  Not a thing.  I’m dying here hahaha 😭😭😭😭
---
Thanks.  I will try this. I've tried everything else.  Was about to give up
---
I build another camera and it worked.
---
Your idea seems easier though.
---
Fuck, I can't believe I did that.
---
YES
---
Bingo!
---
Genius. As a full time Urban Scout Mask wearer I thoroughly approve.
---
What is wrong with them joining? They dont have a huge impact anyway
---
You’re so kind but I’m on XBOX!  I do that one every day so I’ll cross my fingers it pops up soon.
---
After everyone burns through their initial scrip lies won't be a problem.
---
Had it twice so far so seems quite common fingers crossed for you
---
&gt;Did i worry it was duped? No
---
Right there is why we can't have nice things.
---
"Did I worry that the (thing I wanted) was stolen? No
---
 smh
---
Nope. Have them all sitting right there in my account as we speak. It has taken the self control of a god but I have tried to go about this as carefully as possible
---
ehhhh not really. he was focused on making everyone the same race and “gender” (lack thereof) and appearance so there wouldn’t be any kind of race wars &amp; things like that
---
at least to my understanding
---
Check in the vault: purveyor. I didn't quote word for word perfectly. But she will always be Berkeley and always be available.
---
I’ve done some testing and yes my items do affect the drops. I unload most items to my mules and keep mostly bloodied items with me, on a server full of junkies or stalkers, it would occasionally drop a bloodied for me. Maybe the influence is tiny, like a 5-10% chance boost, but it’s there.
---
Yes I was quite happy with that update. If players could destroy camps the first target would've been vending machines.
---
I think If your machine gets destroyed you have to reset everything you put up for sale. I know if you store/scrap it that's what happens.
---
This reminds me of the fact that EVERY single foundation block in this game has an invisible stair/ramp attached to it. 
---
Ever wonder why Molerats can waltz right up to middle of your wall and chew the shit out of it? Damn invisible ramp attached to every foundation. Bethesda’s smart solution to AI pathing issues.
---
This is why I keep a lv 5 10mm pistol on my character get a hit in with a low damage weapon and wait for everyone else to get a hit in so I dont obliterate it in one hit.
---
Yes and I think that is a great feature but players will still complain within the first 5 minutes after launch.
---
So know I know I'm missing Tick and Firefly. Both come from Insect Repellent quest. Someone else told me they added 2 more side quests on the bulletin board located at the Taxidermy Office. So I'm gonna go check that out too.
---
I may have scrapped it...
---
Legendary morning wood hangover.
---
Sure thing, ill drop you a message tonight
---
I really only wanted to cut power to them when I'm out in the world finding stuff to sell. I didn't want anyone making a trip to my camp and not have anything worth the trip. So I cut off power with my "breaker box" when I'm out and about
---
ill add you this evening, thanks :)
---
Apparently if you are at someone else's vendor and can't inspect their stuff go to a stash box and open it up and look at it and then when you go back to the vendor you'll be able to inspect
---
Hmmm I’m trying to think of which 2 quests that were.  I don’t recall them being added to the board.
---
I always go slow and watch how the list populates on the right. If I inadvertently sell a good weapon I can still buy it back.
---
This is my biggest fear
---
What? What is the point you are getting at here? I didn't worry something was a dupe, taking me out of the ingame experience. So I'm a bad guy? Smh.
---
Are you serious? Pretty common? What kind of game are you playing? Lol the BE handmade is rare... very rare and in the market you can easily spend 25k or more for that gun! Is one of the most powerful and required roll in the game, why are u talking if u clearly don't know absolute nothing about this lmao
---
That's simply lol :D
---
Bummer. Bollocks to the legendary vendor. First thing Im doing after work is playing that harmonica🙂
---
Yes that's good to know, its been almost 6 months since I played last so I'm still learning all the stuff they did to game since I left
---
Then you didn't properly do damage that was accounted for. Vats rifle tagging is usually best for that because you can look like you're plowing away at the SBQ with your Gatling but if it's out of range, high likelihood your bullets aren't hitting their target. Get close enough for a confirmed vats hit and you will almost always get a drop.
---
Yeah, like I said, I'm gonna go see if it's true once I get home.
---
This removes your shop from the map. Players can still purchase goods. The room I described is best used when close to Max caps.
---
&gt; The legendary vendor will most likely function like any other shop meaning that only one player will be able to interact with him/her/it at a time.
---
Well people are obviously going to be griefing this and not exiting the menu just to piss people off, and if you go to survival to just kill people in the menu so you can use it, the vendor will just be camped.
---
Either way there will be assholes unless multiple people can use the vendor at once.
---
Let me know if so!  I believe one of those 2 quests were the wendigo one cause it was separate from the first 4.  The other one might’ve been the looking for lost dog one.  I can’t remember I did them so quickly haha.
---
Its true, we will
---
wow wow easy there satan
---
Could you not buy it back from the scrip machine?
---
Yes - this is likely why we don't have the fast travel mats.  With the time it takes for the world to load the CAMP, it probably wouldn't matter.  If our CAMPs were bound to the server like in other survival games it could work, but as long as we can bounce around I'm not sure they could ever fix the load time with this engine they are working with.
---
The load times causes problems, imagine building your base on a cliff, and placing the fast travel mat over the edge, people will fast travel, hit that mat spot, but then fall since the world hasn't rendered yet.
---
Lost dog? I don't remember doing that... Where is it located?
---
Yes, I want more prefab building items so much. Those airstream style trailers, the quonset huts and glass fold out trailers others have mentioned, and those yellow/orange capsule buildings you find all over.
---
Sound ill add you this evening, thanks :)
---
No I got in a lot of damage. Well I got in a lot of *hits*, wasn't doing that much *damage* tbh. But that's lame if true - so if I run around reviving everybody and taking out ads but don't have enough DPS to register more than slap damage on the queen I don't get any credit? BS.
---
The Infobox itself is labeled in the correct order for me too. It's just the  name directly under the campicon that got jumbled in translation. Ist not realy gamebreaking anyway. Was mostly curious.
---
It's based on location and what the game has to load around you.
---
&gt;taking me out of the ingame experience
---
 You didn't say THAT in your original comment.
---
And you knew perfectly well what I was alluding do.
---
You got downvoted by a greasy duper who bribed the scorchbeasts with poor little kitten meat to attack your shop. It’s okay tho I hunted him down and gave him the ol’ one-two with me brass knuckles
---
Welcome Back! The updates have been pretty good. Except they reintroduced an old duping method.... again... sigh hopefully they just completely remove the aspect which allows duping. no one uses this area except for duping.
---
I can’t remember, I think it was at one of the campgrounds?  Or that might’ve been the mystery meat pie one.  TOO MANY TINY QUESTS.
---
Yes if that’s the case definitely report them. Anyone with two identical 3* legendary items for sale is most likely a duper, given how rare the drop rate is. Forget about the mods, dupers change them to avoid detection. If all three legendary effects are identical you have a duper in front of you.
---
No, not that one. He's taking about the one with the rocks next to it.
---
Mystery meat pie? I've been missing so many quests!
---
haha thanks, buddee! ;)
---
How?... quickest I've seen was 10 minutes. Not doubting you, just curious.
---
Endorsed.
---
oof
---
Haha!  I think those were the two to be honest.  Check when you get online.  Let me know if you find different ones!
---
Unfortunately you can't build Atomic Shop items in other players camps...except the red enamel stove for some reason.  My teammate has the laughing snowman, and I want it in my camp so bad!!  I wish they would let us share that stuff, but they want people to buy it...I get it, doesn't mean I have to like it!
---
That's not only correct, it's the only way they can register your participation. Otherwise, someone just sitting out drinking nuka behind the barricades.
---
No, it disappeared when I put the veteren in there. I only got 40 scrip.
---
Oh Im glad you posted then, because you seem to have missed that this is a open multiplayer game.
---
People will play the game in a way that they enjoy and you trying change the way others enjoy to play the game in favor of your preferred enjoyment is just as selfish as what you are trying to cry about.
---
I understand that concept is easy to miss, but I hope this helps you in the future.
---
You can even make condescending replies like the one I am replying to, but you will get people like me who will set you straight and show you how ignorant and hypocritical your request is... You know, just in case you missed that too ;)
---
Enhanced durability would be nice \*cough\*
---
No, no i didn't. Enlighten me? I think it's ridiculous to have to worry in a videogame that something isn't "legit"  it's a game.
---
Yeah, I really do hope that they anticipated trolls and griefers and if the vendor just so happens to stay at Berkeley Springs without moving. I expect to hear the words.. "Nuclear launch detected, please leave the area" ...while shopping.
---
F
---
An alternative for those not on PC is to fill up your entire photo gallery. I did that a while ago, and once all 50 slots were filled subsequent photos, though not being saved to gallery, started counting toward challenges.
---
same as Feed the people event and other sources of huge frustration.
---
The way we’re addressed is also perfect!
---
I didn't sell the furious, I sold "the veteren" and the other disppeared at the same moment. Last week I acidently sold a three star sword that I got back, but this time it just noped out of existence.
---
Add me as well I would love to start doing these weekly. :)
---
i had a legendary lmg that had 50% increased fire speed. I used it ONCE, did the math, and (at the time) there was no way i could keep up with its ammo production. (its not a thing now, but it took a WHILE to build a system to compensate for the amounts of ammo i have to craft for 2 people's fully automatic builds is nuts) 
---
im kinda wishing i hadn't traded it away
---
Yup, and if you try to buy them back it will cost scrip. So don't bother or you'll just end up selling the item right back.
---
😁
---
Be careful
---
Lot of bloodied builds. Give me GT and if on Xbox will invite next time
---
Good Lord, looks like I can only get 5 or 6 drops before I gotta go to bed!
---
I know that but it's silly as hell when I go from having 88% budget and then it shows my budget being 122%. I mean what the point of building the same setup when the game fluctuates. Especially when I log back in to the same location. Explain to why it changes when I log back in.
---
XIM Apex.
---
If I *hit* the queen I'm not sitting behind the barricades drinking nuka. Why should it matter that my build is not op enough to actually do damage? This is nonsense.
---
and people wonder why there's a water shortage in the wasteland.
---
You’ve gotta be kidding me, you should be able to get 30 crappy legendaries within a few hours. Good drops will take days but one star wood armors and rolling pins are everywhere.
---
I’m definitely checking that out
---
You're right....and if they get exactly what they want you'll hear complaints that it's too easy.
---
No I won't! You aren't the boss of me! YOU AREN'T EVEN MY REAL MOM!
---
Huh, that blows hopefully it's a rare glitch. Did you watch the list as it populates to make sure it said the correct item?
---
I see them sometimes, but usually the only one that triggers for me is queen of the hunt. However I have this exact issue in Toxic Valley, literally none of the dailies there will ever pop for me (with the exception of that one Pioneer Scouts daily)
---
Btw, tormentor on the wings is critical to force sow to stay on ground
---
Yeah I just finished my latest camp build at a new location, set up a neat shopping area with vendor and crafting benches behind a garage door.
---
Garage and vendor wired on the same circuit so if I want people to visit I have it open. If I don't I just flip the switch and close up shop, literally.
---
I didn't realize that i was close to the 1000 max, was at 998 and got a warning that i'd only receive 2 scrip if I dumped another item. Do you not get that warning if you are at 1000?
---
I was watching. The veteren was the only one to show up on the other side.
---
The sub will be about how they “dropped the ball”, “missed opportunity” and “disappointing “.
---
Exactly. 😆
---
Super mutants are...somewhat questionable, not going to lie. On one hand, I’ve heard that Vault 87 was making mutants before hand and some of them could’ve gotten to WV. I can’t personally say if this is accurate, so don’t quote me. 
---
There are some FEV places in the game. Apparently, just before the bombs, FEV was placed by the government into the water supply at Huntersville. A lot of people transformed into mutants. In addition, West Tek has a lot of FEV, and there is some lore saying that they were experimenting with it, creating some super mutants. IDK if this fits established lore, but iirc that’s what’s in the game.
---
First Atomic Store item I bought was the welcome mat. What a waste of 300 atoms.
---
You've gotta be kidding me, check all coments under mine.
---
Whats your gamertag?
---
I can see youtubers and streamers hogging the vendor for “content”
---
I'd like to see a bigger camp space in general, I'm on a regular PS4 so if there was a device that wouldn't run an area well it'd be on a regular console or barely capable pc. And I don't notice any performance issues at max camp build, but really need more room
---
lol
---
Same here
---
That's crazy, Sorry to hear that it just sucks there is no way to tell if it bugged out or not
---
The RNG (remember kids, it's all pseudo-RNG) in FO76 is "lumpy."  The probabilities on prefixes aren't all independently and identically distributed.  There's color in the noise.  
---
So today, for example, if I run a Whitespring loop and get a bunch of nocturnal wood armor or (worse these days) no legendaries at all, I am hopping servers and retrying before I go visit Mole Nana.
---
i stopped right on 1000. so i'm not sure if it was a bug that i didn't get the warning or if it just doesn't work the way its supposed to.
---
I want the trailers so bad.
---
It's like the 4th of July when they go off lol
---
Fire barrel and candles *should* give orange light but they're coded wrong. Lanterns, campfires, the atomic store fireplace and the oil lamps give a warm orange glow. 
---
I agree, more would be nice.
---
Some people have a bunch of machines. Which one gets picked?
---
This sounds exactly what I did for someone yesterday. I was in Brotherhood T-60 power armor and I gave someone some purified water, a can of mixed meat stew for the exp buff and a small guns bobblehead to help increase the damage of the weapons you find at the start.
---
When i was scraping last legendary before 1000 it asked me if i really want to scrap it when its price is more than i will give me.
---
How many scrip can you earn per day?
---
You are not my supervisor!!
---
Fallout players might be the best video gamers ever.
---
Do you use Plasma weapons?
---
especially*
---
Ran into him yesterday and he said something like ‘i heard you guys plan to rebuild, another nuke on vault 76 should do it’ 😭
---
Its already begun.
---
😂😂😂
---
Inhave so much asbestos i should just be able to smear it in the walls, cover it with lead paint, and be done with it.
---
I love my Ghoul Slayers Gamma Gun! It's a fantastic paperweight for all of my comics and magazines!
---
Some people on PC are willing to pay around 20k for these plasma grenade plans so if you find one you could probably get around 10-15 on Xbox to the right person.
---
You cared enough to delete your post.
---
it sure does.
---
I’m guessing as many legendaries as you can feed it, but the limit will be 1000 regardless if it’s within the same session or not
---
First one.
---
Sadly pc :(
---
Mmmm, i like that idea, probably going to do that. Does that make the drops super legendary? Hahaha
---
Exactly but it's like we have to be limited to what the server gives us. Only thing I have to do each time I login is to wait for my camp to load piece by piece in front of me. I want our camp radius to grow about 50%
---
Did they at least have a "No Shower, No Shoes, No Service" sign?
---
Haha I do. In one of the pics you can see some ghoul gooey remains...
---
a pinned post for "Can i rEVive You iN WaTer?" posts too
---

 As a full-blown Berserker build I will have to respectfully disagree with Berserker as a negative 1 slot and instead propose that Junkie is far more worthy of that honor.

---
How often does this happen, in one out of ten invites? Can't we list these people somewhere?
---
Or just randomly pick one. Oorrrr they could turn the fast travel mats back on. It was already a thing.
---
This happened to me with free range twice
---
Aww! Oh well! I’ll try to recreate this then! Good bye friend! Have a wonderful day
---
Correct, no purveyor yet as of an hour ago, station was still closed but surrounded by vending machines.
---
150 daily
---
1000 is max stored on charracter
---
For what it's worth I fat finger the upvote/downvote icon on accident constantly while scrolling on my phone.  I try like hell to catch em and fix em cause internet approval is actually important to some people but I know I have to miss some.  I know I cant be the only one accidentally doing this and I'm sure I'm in the minority in going back to fix it when I see it happen.
---
Wish they would just move those icons the the left side but only cause I'm a righty lol
---
That's pretty much what is happening now anyway.  I have stopped travelling into a players camp now because I am having the same experience as everyone else.   I travel to the nearest location and trek in, but I would take the chance with a vendor having a mat, because I know that most people would actually use them properly as I would.
---
Personal camp. Pretty much an entirely full budget, statues take up a ton of %.
---
Bethesda manlets down voting your comments lol.
---
I know, just trying to find a quick solution.
---
Thanks for clarifying
---
I love missiles, and I’d buy them at 5 caps per. Good price. Like the other guy said though, not many people use missiles. Too heavy to carry very many unless you rank up Ordinance Express.
---
That's how guns work
---
I use all my 1000s of 5mm and 308 in my heavy weapons, and 308 isn't so easy to get 1000s of for a player who doesn't play all too often and hasn't got many caps, and don't even always kill her in time so it definitely would be appreciated to know I'm either gonna get something I need, a bunch of caps from selling something I don't need, or up to 40 script
---
It is not.
---
Maybe if you don't build for damage you should be less worried about getting legendary drops? Lol. I don't really know what you're expecting here. 
---
I don't know how you would be expecting them to auto calculate your efficiency of utility participation in a "kill this creature" quest. Maybe stick to more complete this task type quests instead.
---
Oo hadn't thought of the skull totems. Good thinking.
---
Damn, I didn't notice that.
---
Hold your breath when non PA users/builds start ranting about it. Can't wait to have my full legendary x01 tho
---
Damn. I loved that gun
---
Only if you bring disco lollipops.
---
There isn't.
---
No worries.  Thanks for the info!
---
It’s pretty fun when that happens. If I find some lvl 15 power armour I tend to carry it around with me. And complete the parts if possible, then drop it for a lvl 15 to use. Did that the other day in Grafton and she was really happy. I dropped it in front of her and she kept looking at it then looking back at me as if to say “did you mean to drop that?” So I flashed the gift emote and a thumbs up and she hopped right in. Gave her a couple of fusion cores to go with it that I’d picked up too.
---
Just did something similar. Went to do the Free Range event and invited tons of people to my team. Only one level 12 guy showed up ready to help. Naturally we failed the event, but I signaled him to follow me to the weapons workbench nearby. I saw he was using a melee weapon, so I fashioned him a level 10 Burning Barbed Sheepsquatch Staff. Heart emojis went up and we parted ways.
---
Or one gun army in luck for heavy weapons
---
I support capitalism and Im a low prices pooper. The lower, the pooperer.
---
The last 4 SBQ's iv participated in have failed.  
---
Usually 5 - 10 players all nuking it for 30 minute and it pretty much always fly's away at 1/3 of its last hp bar.  
---
I don't even waste my time on it anymore, most ill do is join the event and just nuke all the adds.
---
Ok, there’s about 3 exploits that could be going on here.
---
1) Dupe/duped items. He’s got an unnatural level of items, something no normal person would have.
---
2) Artillery weight/dupe exploit. Using the artillery box back in the day could dupe,  and put items into the stash over weight. This guy probably hasn’t launched up this character since artillery was patched, waiting for this feature to come out, probably how he avoided bans so long.
---
3) New Player vendor Mule bypass. The player vendors can allow you to transfer stuff off the mule characters you have without destroying any items, by “selling” all of your items in the player vendor for 0 cap, and then having your friend “buy” it and transfer it to a new character. He’s probably not doing this at the moment, but I’d have good reason to suspect that he’d be using this method to offload Legendary guns.
---
Theres also a character in what appears to be tire armor in one of the pictures promoting player vending when you first log into the game. Its two characters standing in front of a vending machine.
---
Mine is actually Passcode protected (with the passcode in sight though)
---
Happy Trading =)
---
I was having problems with the camera not registering quest pics, but it turned out it’s just picky about angle and distance. If you’re taking a pic of an eyebot, walk around it and beat it until a little black box with “eyebot” written in it pops up in the corner of the screen. If that’s not showing, the pic won’t count. Sometimes you gotta get close, I had to get right in a SB’s face before it counted.
---
Been looking at it that way too.
---
Good to know, thanks. Hopefully they recognize it an put a warning in any time you wouldn't receive the correct scrip amount.
---
They should have road maps within roadmaps so that we know what's coming
---
someone has their pussyhair all in a bundle...
---
If you are also well-prepared then Free States
---
No shower = no service
---
Noticed that too, atleast getting more same kind of weapon/armor drops.
---
Often with one  perk that i use on equipped armor/weapon, or just same armor/weapon but different perk(s).
---
still hoping for a explosive weapon drop.
---
Playing this game since beta, but only one dropped.
---
Explosive .50cal with second perk hitting same enemy blabla more damage.
---
If Duke Nukem could drain the lizard, we should at least be able to do the same.
---
I just wanna be able to build display cases when they come out but I can't even finish my room yet due to camp space
---
Cool i see i'm not alone to do this !
---
Sometime i give food and water sometime i craft special gun depending on the level of the players I meet.
---
I’d settle for wallpaper, but as the game is now we’d have to attain variants in the atom shop anyway /: 
---
Cue that Beach Boys song
---
&gt;For every ghoul slayer gamma gun
---
I have literally never found any of these on Xbox despite looking
---
Apologies. I will. I will compain. Then go back for more...
---
Id be cooler if getting disconnected didnt reset progress or if it didnt bug out if you were in a team. otherwise its pretty cool

This player vending is the last stop for any exploiters who are unapologetic, and will not stop using these exploits to improve their characters. 
---
Anyone who is dumb enough to still try this, will finally get banned. Then the only people left will be the ones who hide it well, and they aren’t currently the problem.
---
Furious?  That's a solid drop!
---
I've seen all sorts of theories on the RNG with this game, and the truth has also been reported many times by the Data Miners, fact is, it's "RNG" plain &amp; simple, with no other influences.
---
My Main Character carries more weapons than most, as I use 4 pieces of WWR armor, and have some weapons with 90% reduced weight, the combination makes them weigh nearly nothing, so I typically carry 7-9, and keep 4-5 other weapons in my stash. All but a few of my weapons are Instigating, and I have significantly more Ranged than Melee, yet I go for weeks without looting a single Instigating weapon, and tend to get more Bloodied melee than anything which is the Polar Opposite of what I carry, Stash, &amp; Use.
---
I think so - i know I saw a picture.  I think it's on the Morgantown bandstand - but I could be wrong.
---
Like in metro
---
I switched to colored lights, normal intensity. I now have a flamingo room. Oil lampposts are cool too.
---
There isn't going to be an update, when the dailies switch it should just go live. All they need to do is "turn it on" as it is already in game
---
I mean, 200 Bobbleheads pretty much proves he’s a duper, or at least benefited from someone elses duping.
---
Classic rng superstition. The algorithm that determines what drop you get has no idea what your inventory looks like.
---
That's pretty much exactly why i don't like the sticky posts.  It's harder to parse through them for interesting stories in a sea of dross.
---
Not a fan. Survival only player and have two vendors one's a decoy and the other is much harder to find but accessable and carries free stealth bois, dirty cheap super stims and 25 cap 3* legendaries. I don't wanna just give this stuff out but I wanna reward curious/intrepid adventurers whom find the hidden room.
---
Pro-tip for creepers:  If you notice on the map that someone is approaching your camp, get onto your roof and go into Hidden.  Then go into Photo Mode.  You can move the camera around the place to spy on them through your windows.  They won't suspect a thing.
---
Well I'm hoping you are able to have it happen. Are you on PC?
---
Maybe these are for shop?
---
At least!!
---
This is very useful to know - thanks for sharing your experience.
---
You definitely do get screwed at 1 cap per in your vending machine. Sold 600+ 10mm out of mine recently and got around 450 caps from it. Really don’t think values are properly subtracted in large quantity, 1 cap purchases.
---
You go girl!
---
The only slight pattern I've noticed is that I'll sometimes get a grouping of the same primary effects on one server. Like at the weekend I got three pieces of bolstering armour in a short space of time.
---
This sub desperately needs some megathreads.a weekly suggestion thread, a bug report thread, a camp showcase thread, a looking for group thread. Those types of things would really help cut down on some duplicate posts.
---
In order for the personal terminal to add it to the list, you have to complete the daily tasks after building it, I don’t know if it applies to all daily quests but it happened with me for the tea house one
---
I just played the musical instruments at The Nikashine and that didn't count either.
---
You're thinking of "Waste Not" and it's technically considered a Mire Quest.
---
Waste Not and Queen of the Hunt are the only Dailies that ever show up for me in the Mire.
---
ive never deleted a post. Mods must be salty.
---
thats so crazy it just might work!
---
Same!
---
I use enforcer with my prime quad explosive double barrel, works like a charm.
---
Placing the garage on the same power as the door is a neat idea. 
---
I love having conduits sitting flush through a camp, and  when each electric appliance like rad showers, doors, and lights etc. are working with the respective switches.
---
there is also an accordian and a hand drum we cant build
---
Yeah sorry about that my levers babe paint from the atom shop so with that it could not be accidentally dropped or sold to a vendor or player without removing the paint..but last night I was dropping items off to scrip machine and I had my TSE handmade on me ..and it was able to be scrapped for scrip and I did feel somewhat vulnerable to how i could accidentally scrap this...thx for the warning I want to drop my fave weapons on stash prior to dropping legendaries to the scrip machine now
---
The flying targets gets me wrecked in pvp. As soon as they see I'm melee they start jumping around and I've got to land my blow as soon as they touch down. Very tough mini game when your getting explosive Lazers to the face
---
Ah, you've never heard of sarcasm..?
---
Try the Colonel Kelly monument or the top of the Landview Lighthouse. I found the one at Colonel Kelly after hopping. I ran into the other one the next day by accident.
---
But theyre rng, im probably at 2 bomber jackets for 50 technical datas. 500 feels low for my investment, but that’s subjective.  the science scribe seems to have a lower drop rate. Sell it for a thousand.
---
Important question: i'll eat gulper slurry only will my shit be invisible?
---
A singularity!
---
How old are you? lol
---
Next week on the 21st I believe they said.
---
Interesting theory 🤔
---
I can see what you mean, I've got a couple of friends who use a lot of bloodied weapons and keep their rads high to keep health low.
---
Grahm and Raider vendor spawn
---
I'm on xbox and *might* have one left.  I'll have to check when I get home this evening
---
The server seeded RNG is another theory I've seen shared around...  from the Purveyor's perspective it sounds silly but I don't intend to pull all items from 1 server, so I can spread out my odds if the drops are indeed influenced by an RNG seed on the server.
---
Mine is literally the last thing you can reach in my camp.  You have to go into the basement and follow the walls all the way around past the benches, the stash box, the junk extractor and water purifier, the power armor frame, and then in the very last corner is the shower.  With a power switch.
---
Better not do it because you have some weird niche reason.
---
I got close to 2k free cell from a vending machine!
---
I use these boards a lot, but annoyingly most of them float above ground for some reason, uneven surface I suppose.
---
That would explain why I saw so many active vendors in survival mode, I thought that was strange they were making their camps known.
---
Specialized tool. Berserker will do less damage for anyone not using a naked build. Junkie won't do less damage if you're sober, therefore for normal purposes junkie is less bad than berserker's.
---
"I'm Robin Radleech and this is... Lifestyles of the Armed and Irradiated!"
---
Serious question, how can you build so far away from the CAMP machine?
---
My radius seems way smaller than this :(
---
Yea, just giving you a hard time.  Whenever I watch a zombie or apocalypse movie, I wonder which character I would be in the credits.
---
I usually settle on either Corpse #5 or Corpse #6.
---
 I would imagine if anyone takes too much time on survival looking through a vendor they'll get their noggin sniped off.
---
Yea this also kinda bugs me because they end up having invincible turrets. Whenever I put a post about this I would get downvoted to hell :\
---
Thanks for your help.
---
All done!!
---
Pain in the arse doing the "Revive in Water" but managed to do it in Grafton water being killed by a Mirelurk!!
---
“Voila” not walla, Bud! 
---
...you should advise people not to jump into the highly irradiated parts of the pools, because that radiation can finish off the death immediately.
---
I love what you guys are doing! When I've played long enough I'll do the same thing some time. (Loving the game now btw, updates sure fixed a lot)
---
Does your van have FREE CANDY on the side?
---
If not, not interested.
---
It usually takes 12-20 hours
---
I'm at about the same place.  My sniper only has instigating effect (which is still great), and just about every perk for rifles.  I get 1 less damage for the refined .50 cal than the regular.  I don't think I have any other receivers to compare though.
---
By the way, if you set up the metal stairs, a 1x2 at the top, the an adjacent 1x2 on it so it forms a L with the stairs on the inside, you can set support pillars on the corners and even attach platforms after the stairs are removed, but they must make contact with a secondary support (the small one can work). This is how I actually made my front porch and also added a support beam to the inside of my home without having an upper floor.
---
what is the meta pvp build right now?
---
Fought her 3 times yesterday only got a 1* instigating super sledge but I did get decent armor and prime plans i never had before
---
Junkie only gives 10%. Berserker is 50%. Berserker does not do less damage if you are wearing armor, it just does more if you are not/it is lower. All builds need specialization to gain good damage. I know several Berserker players beyond myself. I have not met a single player using Junkie.
---
since I can't upvote your original post, I'll upvote this comment, good job on those dates :)
---
Wait, can i get banned for using mods? All of them are QoL changes none can give any advantage whatsoever.
---
Oh dear lord xD
---
Still in my ears.. the most stresfull quest
---
I usually fix turrets.  They seem to be broken at everyone's camps especially the lower level .  I knew  I wasn't the only one.
---
Lol echo chamber
---
Are you dressed as Piper?
---
Honestly pretty sure the fix is spawn folks outside of the build area. No trapping folks inside of foundations and we both get folks looking for a vendor from and outside approach with everyone can work around
---
"I played 76 for two minutes during beta and want to come back, what's changed?"
---
Alternatively, "should I buy the game?"
---
That would explain why I never see it then :P
---
I would seem that I am 'Persona non grata' in that region.
---
All Scorchbeasts are enough of a pain in the ass that they should drop legendaries, SBQs should drop multiple, at least 1 of which is 3*. Also, since they are the only source of Ultracite PA mods, they should be stuffed with those like a damn pinata.

Thank you. I’ve helped people in the past as well with spare plans etc and definitely pass down the help once you can afford to it’s a really nice feeling knowing you’ve just helped someone start out. I also really like the game as well got almost 700 hours logged I was one of the few that enjoyed the game when it first came out despite its issues.
---
Sorry for picking your brain, but do you know when Kent Connolly sets up his radio broadcasts? He was a ghoul due to the radiation from the bombs, he is mentioned in the Mistress of Mysteries quest, and honestly it would be fun having him as a penpal or contact.
---
That aside, do you think we should be able to (in some later update) contact Maxson to inform him of what has occurred? I mean if anything it would give him closure.
---
Get a life like me I own a leather daddy bar
---
Honestly it seemed large to me too. I just have my camp at the edge of the cliff, maybe the cliff makes it look bigger than it is???
---
And honestly, I have my base strecheddddddd so far. I am surprised I was able to build some of it because it was right at the edge lol
---
Bethesda has mentioned the idea if having some more permanency in player bases, but honestly I don't see how something like that would work.  It's not like having empty camps dotted around the map is helpful, and it makes loading into a world more likely to give you the 'camp cannot be placed' message.
---
If anything, I suspect that they'll have something like this for private servers, but I can't imagine it being a thing on live servers.
---
You should get a new source
---
I just youtube'd the trailer. lol idk how i missed that show
---
From what I heard that's just a visual bug, you should test it properly by looking at the differences with a friend.
---
Accidentally?
---
Fair?  Fair?
---
You are not showing the respect the RNG deserves, it is no wonder the RNG does not shine on you.

Always a concern when going to a vendor in survival, but it's never happened to me. Most folks just wanna unload some goods. Tho if you see valuable scrap/chems for dirt cheap prices they may be waiting for the purchase before they clear you for the scrap back

Has anyone else noticed that the quests tagged with [Repeatable:] are the only ones to appear in the terminal? I think there plan was to test the waters for the code with Biv, then test multiple being present in the code with the Pioneer scouts along side the terminal. Hopefully the next step is converting all the [Daily:] to [Repeatable:]

Pulling a wood armor piece should illicit consuming a shot of everclear (190 proof version).  Unfortunately, this method may make your skin and internal organs become wooden in texture.

I can’t ever get the centrifuge to work.  Does one have to do the quest once proper from defiance to get it to work?
---
I’d settle for a guaranteed rejoin last server ...
---
Seriously, peoples need to stop fighting SBQ for the legendary drops. The point of the fight is for the event drops and ultracite plans. The legendary drop is just extra.  Even if the fight was a guaranteed three star drop people would still complain about their Junkies rolling pin with +bash and blocking.
---
Not your "bud" pal!
---
Good tip, I always aim for the shallow point. I've helped about 10-20 ppl and I got it down to nearly a science.
---
A player once suggested  having it give you a temp buff when you use an outhouse or toilet like +10 carry for a bit.  Similar to sleeping and playing music.  I thought that was a good idea and went along with the "survival lite" elements of the game.
---
Maybe it’s that, perspective angle.
---
Nice job btw!
---
but their name though gave them a thumbs up just for that
---
Is it playable?  I’d be into that.  Play some chess fight a Scorchbeast in between have some drinks laugh realize it’s two in the morning it’d be great!
---
Not sure, haven’t attempted for myself.
---
I’ve done this as well. I gave a full suit of level 25 excavator armor to two different players before in the past and they just look at it not sure if it’s for them.
---
that is what i thought at first too
---
Just because the Overseer does something, doesn't mean it's OK. 🤣 The guy who got the job for the one Nick Valentine is imprisoned in didn't sound like he was too sound of mind either!
---
You have to craft it into Abraxo pods first.
---
Fallout universe version of tide pod kids?
---
I had 2 radium rifle, one with 1* and the other 3*.  Neither of them earned from SBQ.. of course comes from ghouls at WS.. And you are right, its terrible when you compare lever action.
---
I agree that what you are carrying has nothing to do with what you get. I disagree with drips being pure RNG. Bethesda admitted in the most recent patch notes that they would be changing the drop rates of the Cryolator and the Gatling to reflect the rate of other weapons. This is basically an admission that the RNG isn't truly random.
---
I have it lerned but i will probably never build it...
---
If you favorite your item it will ask you again if you are sure bout scraping it.
---
Hopefully this gets fixed because the ultracite gatling laser is the same.
---

Wah wah Bethesda wah wah. Works fine for me.

Isn't it just the bug where you get your reward like 10 mins after you finished the event? It happened to me. I through I had no rewards but in fact it didn't appear right away
---
I read you made a cheese board and I was like who puts statues on cheese boards. Was confused until I saw the picture. Very dope.

This wins at everything.
---
Maybe if you could spell "purveyor"?
---
"Purve Your" sounds distressing, I know it is an M rated game,  but...
---
I don’t know I think it just needs something to encourage people to do it more because I’ve barely seen any nukes drop in the last few weeks apart from servers I’ve directly joined.
---
The plans are great but when you kill the SBQ and she has the no loot glitch, it gets pretty frustrating.
---
I've helped kill her over 10 times now and only gotten loot from her twice, she is so broken it's ridiculous.
---
Can we do something about that? I feel like we have enough knowledgeable/passionate people here to put together an excellent wiki, we just have to choose one to focus on.
---
nah man, i grinded for hours. Got nothing.
---
"camp town robots strip all day, do-daa do-daa"
---
I've heard rumors from other players that occasionally a weaon will get renamed randomly into something completely unrelated to the weapon type.  It might be worth checking to see if your gatling was renamed to 'berserker's pipe pistol' or something.
---
good for you, keep walking.
---
Oh yeah I'd love a bridge. Hell I made a covered bridge from scratch because I wanted one crossing a stream at my camp so badly. that took a lot of budget that could have been covered with a simple wooden bridge.
---

That's odd you sure you didn't just get badges? They doesn't show as a reward and you may be extremly lucky

There's a lot of fanboys here who get bent out of shape if you criticize Bethesda.

It seems like one or more of these fanboys may have found their way into a moderator position.

I liked your post, have a upvote, you make some good points.

Server Disconnected!
---
I have mine on the inside of my front door, but the switch is outside the front door so if someone leaves it on, it can be turned off before going into my camp for those that don't want to use it.  Also, my vending machines are on my front porch so you don't have to go into my camp if you don't want to, but are definitely welcome!
---
I agree. I think the queen and the imposter needs to drop guaranteed 3 star. It would encourage more people to participate.
---
nah man, i used the machine to check right after, and throughout the night that i wasn't recieving badges. Confirmed after several hours of grinding that 0 things were being added. My wife got a few, so i was able to check what someone else was saying, others on mic reported they were getting things.
---
I don’t think we can build on WS property anymore, my camp has been on the creek behind proshop since December and the past 10 logins it cannot be placed.
---
yep, cowards.
---
Always useful when I was younger and needed to knock in some nails but had forgotten my hammer.

Same here had to completely disassemble my whole camp because a staircase got locked in place and wouldn't budge then when I finally finished rebuilding the last roof piece glitched out and wouldn't snap in even though its green. Sighs
---
and who is this rick astley i keep hearing so much about?
---
Yeah I was noticing a lot of auto stim armour pieces with a friend when we were in the nuked Whitespring and she was getting the same too as we both got hits on the enemy carrying them. So perhaps in the same server, same area, same team has an impact? 🤔
---
I think you also get downvoted automatically for editing you post

Don't mind about the downvotes. Maybe there are some out there which fight for the SB rights to not harm then.

TL;DR my coolest survival experience yet where turning pacifist on by the owner of enemy fortress prevented me from damaging stuff mid-fight.
---
I entered a survival server yesterday and seen a massacre going on one of the stations. Sure I went in, exchanged some shots, died few times, killed few dozens, so far so good but you can only fight for station for a while before it gets dull. So I grabbed remaining survival points that I had on me, fast travelled to what was going to be my next playground - Cranberry Glade (check it out 10/10 PvP arena), and quickly gained the 2k exp I needed to light up on leaderboards. Surely enough, few minutes in red dots start showing up on my compass, and as it appeared, mostly the same guys who camped the station then. We died few times, they died few dozens, the battlefield moved out of Cranberry Bog and further south, to what become their camp. Seeing a camp, we backed out -wanted to let them get out and shoot outside, so that their base would remain undamaged. But they started shooting from it, using it as a fortress, making it fair game. It was full of rocket turrets so sure enough when the fire started from their side, soon enough it wasn't full of turrets anymore. After they got beaten few more times, I think they disbanded the party, because one of them kept hunting us while the other turned pacifist on, and repaired the base. They regrouped on pacifist, their base invulnerable, and attacked us on convenient moment, while we were inside. They got my wingman down, but I took down both. The roof exit was surrounded by turrets, cutting my quick way out, but funnily enough, there was an on/off switch for them on the floor I occupied, and I made a perfect exit. They turned the turrets back on as I was fleeting, but this also became my first awesome scorchedbeast encounter as the newly activated turrets aggroed one and summoned it to cover our exit with smoke. Understandably, the guy who just lost part of their defensive infrastructure (we didn't do destruction for the sake of destruction, but we busted some walls and turrets), seeing a scorchebeast aggroing his home to add insult to injury, ended his connection with our server. If you guys reading this and we wrecked your night then we're sorry, you were worthy opponents and it was not easy to fight you, we just had slightly better position each time.
---
Thanks for this! It worked!
---
It can't right now, but... could it with some tweaks? As an example, other games use matchmaking to find people for you to play with that are either the appropriate level, have similiar MMR, etc. IDK what all is involved - I am not a developer. And I realize Bethesda can't just wave their magic dev wand and it's fixed. Just saying it's a frustrating experience, and pretty much anywhere that I've put down a camp that has water is a popular spot.
---
Simple answer seems to be that the FEV virus was being tested on a town to the Mideast of the map prior to the war. I think the town was named Huntersville or something like that. This is also where the Grafton Beast comes from too, I think IIRC it is all connected to Wes-Tek and their facility in the Savage Divided.

It is really frustrating to me, because some people just wont participate in a lot of events in general and its a shame. I would of liked to of seen Bethesda think of ways to encourage participation rather then abandoning them like they seemingly do.
---
For another example. Monster Mash. IMO that would be a great event if you have people competing against each other. Sadly, I only ever play by myself. Why not up the rewards? Give a special double xp to said event or double caps? They could do that to specific events each time.
---
Yeah and that’s something I want.
---
That's so not normal. The only time I though I didn't have a reward I got 3 badges and the s'more recipe and it didn't show as reward I found it afterward. You're the unluckiest guy on earth then 😕
---
I'll grant you the TSE bit, but I can't agree on Sentinel. Me and my friends are among the most active PVP crews on Xbox and fairly consistently top the leaderboard / weekly. We're familiar with most other tough guys that play consistently and have battled them repeatedly. We've tried all sorts of armor sets, adjusting play style accordingly, but we keep coming back to sentinel as do many of our opponents.
---
I like hearing your perspective, but I do think that you're speaking from the upper 1% of the PC Master race; combat in particular has always looked different across platforms.
---
In either case, my point was that even if it were obsolete that wouldn't change the fact that everyone has access to it, and at one point it was kind of a problem. A lot of that gear is the de facto currency on the player Market, so the person saying duping had no effect is willfully ignorant or trying to sweep it under the rug. I will never stop being upset at what a handful of selfish people did to the game. Many turn the other cheek because Hey free candy. I would rather have long fights with crappy gear, which is pretty much what we'd be having now, rather than short ones with gear almost no one would have otherwise.
---
Can’t price things cheaper than what I get from vendors, it’s a macro problem too, not just micro.

5 chances in 188 if you pick the surprise. Therefore 1 in 37, if you try 15 times a bit less than 1 in 2.
---
Math is a bit off there - 33% for melee - you forgot about unarmed.
---
They could have them on there character, you can sell items from your inventory
---
What else would “destroy” mean?
---
Oh I get it now, you're a brand whore with terrible taste.

Best. Camp. Ever.

I've got a stream right behind my camp that works every time, too. I just build a bunch of stairs up high and then jump off and land in the stream (north of the Overseer's camp)

Yes, in general I have been really impressed with peoples camps.

I would love mine if it wasn't for the damn foliage sticking through some of my floors.

The zoom function is pretty pointless as it doesn't register the thing in the viewfinder from further away. You still have to get really close for the name to pop up in the top right corner.

Well a duh moment for me lol. Thought it would be like the atom shop skins have to craft them separately

&gt; It can’t possibly be more disappointing than looting legendary enemies has already been.

That's what I'm talking about. You'd have scorch beast hunting parties at that point

I'll totally take that.

This is how the games and story all tie together.  I found it amusing when the game first came out how most people screamed about the lack of lore friendly storylines in the game.

We need Fisto!

I saw these tiny Nuka mugs and I was like I NEED THOSE.  But I know if it starts there it doesn’t stop.
---
Yeah, I tried swapping it up against the SBQ yesterday and I agree.

I don't know what the actual timing is, but it reminds me of the Fire Axe or Baseball Bat versus the Super Sledge/Sledgehammer.  I always preferred the latter because they *felt* faster, even though they were all "Slow" weapons.

---
Calling it an RNG is debatable.
---
Bethesda admitted in the patch notes that weapons like the Cryolator and the Gatling Gun have a different drop rate than others.
---
I personally don't consider it random if the numbers that are being generated are not random.
---
Next time I guess you'll repair it first huh..it flat out told you it would destroy the item..
---
I think there needs to be some clarification.  If you're doing an "event" like uranium fever, absolutely.  I pull out my vampire's gatling gun and share tags with everyone.  If you're just clearing white springs, I can't sit around and wait for someone else or often even know if someone else is around.  If I see someone at the golf club I'll let them have the area they're in and move onto another.   If there are several people on the map I just jump to another server.  If it's something like the sheepsquatch then I "hope" everyone is getting tags in.  I can't one shot it, but it takes about 5 swipes.  I'm doing my best to kill it before it notices my squishy ass.
---
They want you to remove the paint before you can sell or trade it.
---
My best Queen drop so far since the beta is a 1*junkies pool cue... So yes her loot needs to be seriously buffed! Heck the last time I didn't even get flux on qlthe quest reward...
---
I believe it was over 500 with the full heavy combat vanguard set and armored backpack.
---
It’s like 350 with the powered set I normally run.
---
Praise Atom!
---
I did just wake up when I read your post..... 🤔🤔
---
Also semi-auto rifle and auto rifle are not distinct types. They're the same base item, with different mods... so 33% right-type melee versus 25% ranged.
---
Man I love this game and all the great things people are doing and this is up there for one of the best

Of course, because Iron Fist affects the Mole Miner Gauntlet since it is an Unarmed weapon.  Gladiator does not.  The only exception to this is the Meat Hook which benefits from both (for now, at least).

You beat me to it lol, I’m imagining il be getting a nice supply of tyre iron, pipe wrenches batons and boards along with those rolling pins and golf clubs too 😂😂😂
---
Made this mistake. I knew about the limit, and I knew that I already had 998 scrip. After accidentally exchanging 2 star armor worth 9 scrip, I wanted to go back and exchange a 1 star armor piece instead. However, taking back my 2 star armor subtracted 9 scrip from my total. It’s only a minor inconvenience, but I need to be more careful moving forward.

Well there is the 10mm SMG and .45 SMG which are only auto rifles

Cajun Rice 'n Beans is an MRE/C-Ration entree in game.  If in game MREs function similarly to how they function in real life then deification will only happen occasionally and painfully.

Not that rare anymore.

It stopped dropping ultracite plans for me, all I'm getting are T series jetpacks and prime recivers...

---
Can you please post the negative effects of each addiction? Been trying to find a list and can't

When is the update
---
I was doing the teacup event in the forest one day when the insult bot came waddling towards me. I had to defend different the generators so I would head to one and clear it. By the time I finish with one the insult bot finally made its way to me, calls out to hold my attention only to have me leave to the next generator. Repeated this till the event finished. Shit had me busting up, he just kept following me in circles
---
true, forgot about melee - still a better percentage chance though.
---
it's a trade off: you need those damn bloody killers to fight the SBQ before you can rebuild America
---
I killed everyone there. They were monsters.
---
If they just fix it so that items you sell don't take up double space in your stash, I'd be fine with the current space.
---
I get that I can't put 100 1 lb stims from my inventory for sale if my stash is full, but when I try to sell a rifle that's already stashed, and I can't because I'm out of space, it makes no sense.
---
Taste the downvotes.
---
Destroy just the paint on the armor? I don’t think that’s a preposterous assumption.
---
That’s quite a nice shrine you got there.
---
You know I get the idea behind the LMG using .308, and it does have the highest dps in the game... but holy hell, crafting .308 ammo is painful. It does about 20% more dps than the .50 cal (not including reload time... which I still wonder if it's actually better after reload is taken into account since the .50 cal has such greater sustained fire), but jesus in the time it takes me to farm ultracite .308 to do the queen, I could have farmed enough ultracite .50 cal for and killed 3 queens.
---
I have the same issue.  Sucks
---
I think I just got AIDS from reading this.
---
Getting loot from her is proportional to a contribution of damage if you just tag her with a crappy gun, you don't get her loot, same with any other enemy in thr game! You have to do enough damage compared to her health bar to get a loot drop!
---
It is a logical leap. It didn't say "remove the paint". It said " destroy".
---
Don’t get me started. No, literally—please don’t get me started.   Nice collection.
---
Didn’t do that. Explained that I read it in the post.
---
When you sell items in a vending machine they are transferred to your stash.

I’m going to Fast Travel to Vault 76 before logging out on my main character until Bethesda mentions this issue in Patch Note form. I find myself staying in a world when my Camp is occupied to check out what the other person built in my spot.
---
I prefer https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Fallout_Wiki and make changes when I can.  I find "The Vault" -- https://fallout.gamepedia.com/The_Vault_Fallout_Wiki just too damn ugly to use.  It also seems to have mode datamined unconfirmed content.
---
What everyone else has said plus place, don't drop power armor.
---
The whole system will give you "something to do" with the Legendaries you don't want, but it's not going to fundamentally redefine the game or anything.
---
I know they want to preserve a certain degree of randomness and prevent players from getting what they want on-demand.  But at the same time, I also believe her offerings are too vague.  Truth be told, there are a *lot* of "joke" melee weapons no one wants, and they get thrown into the same pool as your useful ones, whereas outside of the infamous Ghoul Slayer's Gamma Gun, a fair number of guns are useful in one way or another.
---
I am defeated.
---
Just out of curiosity.. what's stopping you? I've been launching nukes solo and carrying the queen fight in 2-5 minutes for a long time. Even when I was just using a 1 star bloodied .50 cal it wasn't an issue.
---
Here's what I found out:
---
When you are taking a pick of, say, the bugs for the badge it's not enough to have it in frame.
---
If you look in the upper right corner of the camera view, you will see a small grey box with text of the creature you are photographing.
---
You have to have that box for it to count.
---
On the upside, it does this with corpses, so kill it *then* take the photo.
---
The specified instruments don't work, either.
---
Most likely in a half hour to an hour from now. If they follow suit with previous updates/new content.
---
depends on your Rifle Perks though
---
Fair 'nuf. It's a bit more complicated, but ranged is mostly four categories.   
---
I think the bigger issue is that melee builds can flex between the three melee types without needing to re-spec SPECIAL; they can just swap perk cards. Ranged weapons are under STR (Heavy &amp; Shotgun), PER (Rifles), and AGI (Pistol).   
---
I find the game's over-reliance on STR as a stat is a bigger problem than the legendary weapon types, not to mention that carry-weight is also so crucial.
---
You must not want the +1 agility version.
---
Submit a ticket to Bethesda directly. You're not going to necessarily get a response from anyone at Bethesda on reddit unless a community manager spots it.

Have a 3 star nocturnal with deep dish , at night it does around 125 dmg and 150 radiation give or take depending on the hour also does 50 % limb dmg with 90% weight reduction so it's like . 038 in inventory .

One.
---
In all fairness to the OP... I've not done what they did, but it's not really that clear on how you get around it... the BIG way it says destroy it SHOULD also say OR just say remove Atom upgrades... just saying the player base varies in age and gaming type knowledge... plus way to many things are far to vague in just how they truly work out.
---
Yeah, whenever I get one I sell it for 200c. Getting them takes absolutely no effort and I usually can get one every other play session or so. I’m sure some of my buyers are just reselling them but I hope some are low level players who are happy to be able to get one without having to travel to an area too hard for them.
---
Thats why Bethesda must make it possible to scrap it or bulk it, that way we will be able to use it. I only use .308 or 45. The rest I sell, and .38 well that one I give away at train stations.
---
Nocturnal Walking Cane with reduced weight and faster reload.
---
I be awesome too
---
If you're only looking at major type - but there's far more useless pieces that are melee.  Most of the ranged weapons are of use to someone so even if you don't want/need it for your build, someone else might want that lever action, gauss rifle, shotgun, pistol, etc.
---
Your reputation on the internet is ruined forever.
---
Agreed, I really hope they add lore friendly camp items. Astroturf came before dirt floors or rough cut wood?
---
I'd love to see dirt floors, chain link fence walls, rough cut lumber walls and barricades, cinder block walls, junk barricades, junk clusters for decor and things in this vein.
---
She's the final boss.
---
She's very difficult to take down by yourself.
---
She's classified as a 3\* Legendary.
---
If she doesn't drop a 3\* item, no one should.
---
There’s a spot down the path from the twin lakes, there’s a pond with a behemoth in it that I’ve used to help a couple of people. It works every time.
---
Yes exactly.  Middle Mountain cabins is the spot i almost always find honey beasts with the good jelly.  I might have gotten my jellies mixed up when i did my last run cause i usually grab all three but i noticed my count was all wrong (i check by looking at the recipe for honey crisp)
---
I agree. STR is skewed to melee builds
---
Bugged for everyone since release.  Not much complaining this cycle thankfully, most everyone understands Bethesda releasing content means it wasn't 100% ready. That last polish from 75-100% takes them 4x longer than any company in house, I for one don't mind them releasing sh\*t half baked as long as it's progress able.
---
Do Athlete, Swimmer, and Archery.
---
Why can I not upvote more than  once.
---
Why would we get scrip for spending scrip?
---
Are you talking about the event, or something else?
---
I've not heard of the event causing problems, I've run it 100ish times and don't think I've had that happen.  I'll occasionally get some asshat that one shots the end boss so I don't get my crappy level 15 one star legendary, and sometimes the event flat out fails, but I've never seen it just not register.
---
Side note:  If your posts are getting deleted, it's not for pointing out, or asking for help with, a bug or problem with the game.  It's for the shitty attitude or the flat out whining without looking for help or a solution.
---
One time my three star walking cane turned into a handmade when I was browsing my stash. The look didn't change but the name showed as instigating handmade. When I quit the inspection window and checked again it went back to walking cane, the disappointment was immense.
---
More of a reference to Fallout 2
---
Can i ask where you found the s'mores recipe? I was hoping it was from teh campfire drop event but i haven't had much luck with that.
---
i dont see why you wouldn't be able to, but you're losing 20-60 scrip on each item
---
Usually happens around 8-9pm pst
---
Yes, the scrap machine is there to stay I believe, or they will get rid of the scrap machines and let you directly sell for scrips to vendor.
---
Yup, the Legendaries it gives you are just normal legendary items so you can break them down but I think you get about half it's scrip value back.
---
I have found them, placed them, and it still won’t register as being completed
---
you need to get the password from Fort Defiance.
---
Its a note on a desk on level 4.
---
Oh I see what you’re saying, I took the iron fist card on and off and saw a damage increase but I never considered that gladiator wasn’t doing anything. I assumed it was since the mole miner gauntlet  is  a one handed melee weapon
---
i thought about that too.  But with 3-Star, for 40Scrip would you just recycle it for another go? (unless of course its mods are awesome)
---
I think they mean by using the machine to turn the legendaries you get into scrip, which I don't know why we wouldn't be able to.
---
I'm planning to make my next character a sneaky crit spamming commando. I'd be interested to hear what perks and at what level you have everything. There just aren't enough points in perception, agility, and luck to get everything I want. I'm hoping I can find a bloodied, +50% VATS crits legendary so I can free up some space not needing Better Criticals.
---
I could not explain it correctly I guess. Say, we do not like the random legendary we get, will we be able to scrap it in the vending machine?
---
Yea
---
It's different perks, but I'm going to mod the weapon to match my play style and perks. If an AAE/BE/TSE auto-handmade drops and I want a semi-auto, I'm not going to be disappointed or change my build. I'm just going to swap the receiver to the mod I want (excepting the SMGs /u/malaclypse333 mentioned).
---
Dang, that’s usually too late for me here in my time but thanks for the invite
---
yeah i tried twice, but tbh-- this game is just bad, and i didnt want to keep going after hearing the same shitty story over and over and over.
---
That requires finding another body with the broken camera on it, and the game letting you loot that body, I managed to loot it twice but not any more since!
---
why not?
---
It happened to me once. The worst part is that I must exit and enter the machine to list each item. My scroll bugs out after listing an item and I cannot scroll down to list a second.
---
An epic drill.
---
Instead they just spawn inside your locked areas!
---
Happen twice to me as well.  Finish the even.  Win.  Get the Success message .... then nothing.  No XP.  No Junk.  No Caps.  Nadda Zilch Zippo.
---
20 run throughs, 10 Failures due to collecting fire wood failures.  7 rewards.  1 possum badge.  2 NOTHINGS.
---
Yeah I can honestly say I never duped in this game, made all my stuff from grinding
---
That would be awesome! Thank you
---
And the dumb question of the day goes to....
---
How do you manage this? Every time I try and tackle the SBQ solo a bunch of low levels show up to leach but not help and the whole thing becomes a wash.
---
I'd like to at least see the possibility of Legendary Scorchbeasts mixed in with the standard ones.
---
The Scorchbeast is an odd one because when you reach a certain level and have your perks and gear together, taking them down is no problem at all and I don't really expect some grand reward for it.  They also have no stars or Legendary in their name, so having them drop Legendary gear would make them an exception.
---
But the thing is, when you down your first one, it's anticlimactic to receive nothing useful from it.
---
So, I think the solution would be to have Legendary Scorchbeasts.
---
Really?! Daaaamn. How is that even possible? Do you get rewards for other events or what?
---
Zippety-zoo! I am happy for you!
---
depends on what your picking up I like to run Morgan town 2-3 times a day I would say ammo and items in the world re spawn in about 2-3 hours, ore used to be able to be farmed by server hoping but my guess is once you have left the area it should take again a couple hours. it has to be the little ones not the ones where you can place an extractor. but I have never tried mining inside ores like the lead ones in the lucky hole mine. cap stashes take about 8-10 hours. container loot takes 2-3 hours to come back and I have confirmed this many times walking through Morgan town for farming dog food in trash bins you can search. if you have cleared an area on the map I find the best thing is to spend time on the opposite side of the map, sever hop and go again. the thing that matters most is that you are in game even if your afk the timers are counting down. if it doesn't seem like thing are coming back it could be that you are following some one on their farming route, this happens to me a lot.
---
Notice how you can't get a quad black powder rifle because that would be OP.......but you can still get a black powder rifle with 25% fire rate even though that perk can't work on a black powder rifle.
---
No need to be rude, you know.
---
There are literal callout posts, and posts with the titles "Fuck this quest." on this reddit right now. Bullshit. I refuse to believe its about language. It's moderator salt. 
---
I'm talking about the quest, and yeah i dont really care about the legendary, just if i get SOMETHING. Fucking anything.
---
Also, i couldn't care less about a shitty attitude. this game is shitty, its been shitty, its getting shittier. My attitude towards it would change, if they made positive changes, but they have not.
---
So you are telling me the deathclaw is banging vault girl, I am never going to get that image out of my head
---
I thought berserker reduced damage over a certain DR threshold, if it doesn't then I am operating on false information and junkie/berserkers would be equally usefull/useless for someone of a normal build.
---
I don't think the purveyor will be seeded or anything but I can attest the seeded drop theory is somewhat correct. I tend to get a lot of the same items I'm carrying.
---
Plasma grenades are such common drops why would you need to craft them? I usually end up with about 60 of them after a days adventuring and need to sell most!
---
Well that escalated quickly.
---
everything else has worked as designed as far as I'm aware.
---
I was going to say, this sounded way too thoughtful for Bethesda to have implemented. 😂
---
Deathvault.
---
I've avoided buying merchandise. I know once I start I won't stop
---
Nice collection btw
---
I got a 1* aa tire iron yesterday.  I wanted a rolling pin :(
---
I discovered this too, but even though it identifies the animal in the grey box, it isn’t  counting it towards the badge. Super weird.
---
That's so harsh
---
gotcha
---
My two shot auto grenade launcher did noticeable damage to the SBQ per shot, but it breaks super fast. Repair kits might be the solution there.
---
you can make up to 5 characters you know
---
I'll start this by saying I couldn't prevent myself upvoting what you wrote, because you are completely right, I have mind-locked myself to PC, where for example rendering distance is a thing in combat because people kill themselves across distances which, for consoles, simply don't exist. I had that discussion once, and the console mate I debated with was surprised when I describeds one of my ultra-long-range kills.
---
I think its pretty safe to assume combat on PC is little bit more hardcore. There are lots of people who use assassin/sentinel on ultra long ranges where no VATS can ever occur, and who strategically occupy hard to approach terrerain to deny opponents vats range access.
---
The thing is this game is full of ridiculous synergies majority of the players are unaware. Those who do, are reluctant to share it - why should I be saying what's awesome and neglected, if its market value is at 2k while it should be considered a godroll? I'd be shooting myself and my friends in their feet.
---
My theory is that in most situations against really experienced PvPers fighting with similar number of people, in the PC survival reality, the best armor is a mixed set that doesn't look specialised at first glance but in fact has no wasted slot. I encourage you to mix up ass/sent with other stuff.
---
Something is surely odd in the game with items right now. 
---
\- I've had items rename themselves to make them identical to items I have in stash/inventory, like my Vampire Ripper will rename itself Mutants Slayers Gatling Gun.
---
\- I've had a Mirelurk label itself a Mole Rat and drop Mole Rat Meat.
---
\- When I add an item to Favorite Wheel and select to equip it will be the same base weapon just a different one than I chose. IE: I favorite a Ghoul Slayers Gatling Laser, it shows that in favorites wheel but when I click it will equip my Anti Armor Gatling Laser.
---
Just gotta get that sweet spot. Constantly rotating the corn and hovering in small circles works best for me
---
bro, i feel so bad for you. why would you put yourself through that?
---
Out running the spawning of the building was how I got into the legendary vender last month!
---
btw, does anyone know how the level is determined for the Purveyor items, is that random too?
---
Not necessary just transfer with your friends..if any
---
You dont have enough upvotes
---
can only speak for rifles.picked up the lev 50  50cal ,but could never find the plans for it.past week,theres loads so I bought some. The refined is the highest damage at 149 (no legendary) all the rest were well below.
---
my 50 sniper was 138 before the buff, and 139 for the 308.
---
n.b.  the 308 scorched reciever drops to just over 100 and 20% less againsts everything but scorched which is +50%. I prefer consistancy.
---
the plans were about 190 caps each
---
1 player can make the queen fight last 2-3 minutes if they are properly geared and built. 4 players that are optimized can do it even faster, even with the entire server there. The only limit really is if the queen bugs out and flies away for long periods of time.
---
Example recent queen kill from one of my livestreams:
---
[https://youtu.be/buqpQNy7WCE?t=1580](https://youtu.be/buqpQNy7WCE?t=1580)
---
Fight start - 26:20
---
Fight end - 29:00
---
Time to kill - 2:40
---
This was just me and 1 friend (Appa) carrying the fight. There were 2 randoms in with us that asked to group up but I can't say if they were really contributed at all. This is pretty normal for me, even if I'm carrying it solo, about 2 - 4 minutes per kill. I've seen sub 2 minute kills but that was with a bunch of people who are just as optimized as I am. My build link is in the video description as well.
---
A few tips:
---
* At least one person should be hitting her with an endangerol syringer. I don't know if the effect stacks, but it's -25% DR which makes a big difference since she's so heavily armored.
---
* Ideally you want someone using a suppressors cryolator on her (that person should also be on syringer duty) to keep her frozen on the ground. This makes it so easy for everyone to gang up on her.
---
* A shotgun build works wonders for crippling her and does respectable dps.
---
* For your heavy hitting DPS, nothing beats a b25 or AA25 .50 cal or LMG. 
---
The kill in that video only had me and my friend playing heavy gunner dps roles, none of the other stuff. Would have gone faster with someone else doing cryolator duty. Also for reference, I'm using a B25 .50 cal in that video, but I had just gotten it the previous day. I've been doing queen fights in 2-5 minutes with a 1 star bloodied .50 cal for a long time.
---
No need for downvotes.  That would have been my next question, since Arktos Pharma had been promised "soon," but isn't part of the Roadmap.
---
Lollllll
---
Yes, but I get dozens just from traveling at this point. Crafting them would be a waste of materials.
---
Yeah, I'm for this. I don't want people spawning inside my house. The location and exterior is the best part of my camps, I want people to see the approach, like if they stumbled on it exploring.
---
I can confirm this multiple times over.
---
I have one in my vending machine right now bud but I'm not online. My GT is Makesheetah
---
personally i dont have enough time to invest in more than 1 character, but I can see how that would benefit others
---
Ok, so if I rank up an endurance park to max now it should pop right. Thx mate
---
I've only ever found one tourist with the camera.
---
Once you do the camera missions you get a recipe to build more cameras using easy to find stuff.
---
Exactly. Its all just rng. I just kind of average the prices of the FK drops out to what I have. The engineers uniform is the one that drops very low for me so I charge more for that one. But I still have about 9 bomber jackets and almost 10 Science scribe outfits. The other scribe outfits are about one field scribe to every two normal scribe. In the end its sell whatever you want tbh. If someone wants it, theyll buy it. Cant say I havent done that already myself for a few things I never saw before.
---
Tatos + Corn + Mutfruit + water = Adhesive for days.
---
Man, I remember the grind of Final Fantasy XI notorious monters.  
---
21-24 hour lottery spawns, competing against players using bots, competing against RNG for drops and then having to compete against your linkshell members (guild) for them, either via points or RNG rolls.
---
I'm okay if it's not guaranteed, but Itd be nice if payoff for the fight would be better whether loot or other intangible things.  Like, getting a buff like "Thrill of the Kill" where you are so hyped up you run faster or hit harder or gives you more special for an hour.
---
I have moss coming through my windows and walls, one part covering a doorway almost entirely. Actually looks pretty cool, makes my camp feel swampier. Lol
---
If you’re on XBOX the same thing was happening to me with the queen and deleting my cache manually worked and fixed it!
---
There's absolutely nothing stopping them from putting a flag on legendaries purchased with scrip to prevent them from being re-sold for scrip.  I've seen similar things in other games.
---
Well, one thing stopping them is that it's a stupid idea, but other than that...
---
Right now, any 'How will it work' questions are fairly stupid, since no one will know until it gets released (or until the new Inside the Vault comes out, or however they're going to announce things).  We don't know if you can resell, we don't know if you can buy more than one a day, we don't know if the level of the item you buy will be max level, we don't know if they're weighting good effects rarer or simply excluding them, we don't know if the purveyor will shoot you dead after you buy something.  We only know that it's coming, and a few other meager details they've already announced.
---
I'll stop by later if you're on when I'm on!
---
Everything is not about you though. Sorry not everyone is a bloodied build
---
As worded"Deal more damage the lower your Damage Resistance." if it was less they would have worded it like Nocturnal "Does increasing amounts of damage as the night grows longer, but less damage during the day." When I use my Berserker while in PA it has base damage of a regular weapon of that type. But yeah now I am theory crafting a Junkie build XD Should I focus range or melee?
---
The recipe to build the camera is the broken deluxe camera! It can't be crafted without one!
---
I would expect beth to drip feed em to us. As far as i know its the 4 plus all the insects and thats all thats around.
---
Crafting challenges
---
😂 👍
---
I have been able to fulfil the requisites for Hunter too on three different toons so that is also an option.
---
Need to craft for challenges
---
Or to be able to snap the existing ones to one side or the other instead of the middle.
---
Localization is hard
---
If you're just getting into lore; check out Oxhorn on Youtube. The man digs deep. He made me realize how shallow of an observer I am in Bethesda games.
---
Good to know - might be time to put items of the same time in stash before we go scrip the unwanted piece.
---
Barbarian has nothing to do with it.  The Mole Miner Gauntlet, in terms of damage perks, only benefits from Iron Fist.  Not Gladiator, not Slugger.
---
Sometimes it's ambiguous based on the player animations when something is Unarmed versus One-Handed.  The mechanism for holding onto the Meat Hook is almost identical to the Mole Miner Gauntlet.  But the rule of thumb is that if you can't use it while wearing Power Armor, it's Unarmed.
---
Appreciate it man. Just joined reddit this month. I don’t know the downvotes, I just didn’t find any info on the Arktos Pharma
---
We were able to do it before, just had to place pieces down in a strict order. It’s more lenient now I believe
---
I wish I could just find the damn camera
---
This. One Gun Army works well too, but nothing beats a shotgun build for keeping her grounded, since every pellet helps cripple.
---
The other thing I've noticed is that you have to stand still. While I'm moving, it doesn't register the name. I've also noticed that if I switch to the camera while in the middle of reloading another weapon, the camera will bug out and stop taking photos completely. I've had this happen in reverse also when I switched to a weapon while the camera was reloading. The solution was to hit reload again, switch to another weapon, fire a couple shots, reload completely, and then switch back to the camera.
---
I'll keep on doing it I hope it screws up your broken op bloodied rad build.
---
My Stalker's Walking Cane trumps your Nocturnal.
---
Had this today with gatling gun.
---
And the yesterday with tesla rifle.
---
I would love to get a 3 star legendary war drum.
---
No it takes the photo but it just doesn't mark it as complete
---
I usually drop all the ammo I do not use at vault 76
---
nah im on ps4, but do elaborate on this.
---
IMO they should've never nerfed any weapons/armor in the first place.
---
For Survival Mode, perhaps.  Not for Adventure Mode.
---
Remember the Whitesprings Nuke runs after launch where you could level up 15 times in one go?  
---
Pepperidge farm members.
---
I was farming WS last night and landed a 1 Star Hunters Lead Pipe 😂
---
Nice.
---
Also, why does every style appear to be receding? My hairline still on point lol
---
No more nerfs please, if anything I feel shotguns need to do a bit more damage. They seem super weak right now.
---
Pistols, automatics, rifles (some crossover), heavy, shotgun, energy, explosive, other?  (cryolator/alien/tesla/etc., probably fit somewhere above for at least some of those)
---
I don't think you even need to do the quest. Just look around in crates and shit for a broken pro snap camera then you can craft a normal pro snap in the tinker's workbench
---
Crap I wish I could I don’t know PS4.  Perhaps someone else can on here?  There’s a listing for saved cache files that I deleted on XBOX and all my stuff reset and I started getting rewards again.  That’s all I know for XBOX.
---
FYI I’ve noticed some changes in damage values after patch 9... next time I’m online I’ll gather some raw data without perks but in the meantime I have some numbers that might be useful.
---
1) Harpoon gun flechettes now has higher damage value than standard or barbed. Possibly related to the shotgun fix
---
* my TSE flechette harpoon (max level) was showing 1,160 on the stat screen with 30% heavy gunner, rank 5 demo expert and 15% bloody mess. Standard harpoon type was around 570ish but I forgot to take a pic before sold it... 
---
* I then acquired a QE flechette harpoon gun, I will get the new damage values for all harpoon types for you...
---
2) Two Shot explosive launchers now properly show nearly double damage on the stat screen (as I have long speculated). 
---
With rank 5 demo expert and rank 3 bloody mess, here are the new damage values on the stat screen:
---
* TS Broadsider = 504 (was 254)
---
* TS Missile Launcher = 577 (was 292)
---
* TS Fat Man = 1,681 (was 843)
---
* TS MIRV Level 25 = 540 (was 273) 
---
**NOTE MIRV DOES SAME BASE DAMAGE NO MATTER WHAT LEVEL - My level 45 Daisy Cutter is also 273**
---
* TS M79 = 434 (was 219)
---
* TS Auto GL = 434 (was 219) 
---
Hope this helps you with your data!
---
Sorry I didnt mean barbarian I meant gladiator. What I meant was that I assumed that the gladiator worked automatically because I thought of the gauntlet as a one handed melee so I didn’t even check to see if it worked, the only variable I checked for was iron fist. When I saw that iron fist affected the damage I came to the conclusion that both gladiator and iron fist apply just like they do with the meat hook.
---
I think you underestimate the sheer number of joke melee weapons that no one would ever want.  Pool cues, walking canes, golf clubs, boards, the list goes on.  If all you want is a chance at a Sledgehammer, you're fighting for one specific weapon type out of a dozen no one would use.
---
Yeah, a gun may not fit your particular build, but few gun types are objectively junk.
---
Against the "bosses" it feels like shooting blanks sometimes
---
Happened to me with a minigun last night.
---
I've found like a dozen broken cameras since the quest was implemented. Ghouls drop them all the time.
---
I treat this game as a lite mmo.
---
[](/maud) My experience with decades of MMOs. If something becomes a "meta" or "OP" or "competitive" expect it to be nerfed in some fashion.
---
More so in games with RNG loot as opposed to curated loot.
---
I don't even try to compete. If I find a fun combo I use it. OP, not OP, don't care just here to have fun. My pistol build, utterly useless in PVP, mediocre in PVE. Still more fun than my high damage output heavy weapon dude or my unarmed melee guy. I just like to feel like a cowboy.
---
very interesting! i'll have to do some research! thank you!
---
I saw another post on this issue and they said that there may have been some random insect that isnt in the immediate area and is off down the hill or somewhere. Said to check around and spam vats to try and find it. Going to try this the next time I get a no reward scenario myself. Happened a few times already to me.
---
happened to me but i realized if i was in Pip or corpse inventory or VATS that the reward would “bypass”.
---
Got one last night! It’s now 5 scrip.
---
That too. You guys ever consider people may want the items that may benefit an alt noob ?
---
Bloodied will get nerfed indirectly, I expect the damage increase to remain constant while "low health" builds get a little squishier. New mechanics or tweaking some of the stacking or serendipity.
---
yeah that was my post, the mods deleted it. but i also thought to check this out later If my wife makes me play this again.
---
You had me going for a second. I actually went and looked!
---
There are dozens of broken cameras in the game, but they are different from the one to be made into a workable camera!
---
Dunno if that's how it works tho:
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/a12ywn/anyone_else_wish_that_the_berserker_legendary/
---
Everyone else is trying to get credit, so why not guarantee it?
---
That would be awesome...lol
---
There is little more disheartening then getting the forever buffering glitch when you try and loot her. I had it happen three times in one damn week. It sucked, especially killing her being such an ammo dump.
---
I think it's a good idea. I have a few items taking up space that are built somewhere into the game world that I cannot scrap. Sadly for you, it's an item that's limited.
---
You can find the broken camera out in the wilds though, you don't need to find another dead tourist.
---
That's also interesting that if you are looking at an inventory or pip or vats the game just bypass you. I know i wasnt in vats (i dont use it) and i know i wasnt in my inventory, because i was literally just standing there waiting to see if something would come. but no. nothing. ill be sure to do absolutely nothing other than the bare minimum and see what happens.
---
Praise RNGeezus!
---
Yeh it took me 8 shots to put down a ghoul with a TSE. was very Supprised
---
The mutation for faster reload just kinda takes reload out of consideration. But yeah 308 is the most painful to make and collect. When I get the chance to play all day I'll claim the munitions factory as soon as I log on then stop by every now and then to reap the rewards. But that's alot of effort
---
Aye I had a friend do Hunter as well, a little more effort but arguably more satisfying.
---
The cameras I find out in the wild are just junk items and not compatible with the camera plan!
---
I feel personally attacked
---
I really want to hear what the cryptids have to say
---
I’ve been seeing people place them in common spots for fast travel, I lost 3 mutations because I came straight from my camp after moving starched genes for super duper.
---
I think the snallygaster also came from there.
---
I am predicting that the vendor will show up wells like Xur used to in destiny. It’s a good player retention strategy.
---
That's odd.
---
I've built 2 cameras but I've only ever found 1 dead tourist?
---
Fortunately I have all the melee weapons I \*need\* - I don't have a god roll but I have enough to get by. I don't have many particularly useful ranged weapons but it would be cool to get something intriguing and change up my playstyle therefore. So I'm just gonna roll the dice on ranged and see what comes up.
---
I've found some friends who do this pretty much everyday.  I call it a "hat trick."  You do the SBQ 3 times, back-to-back, and maybe as a bonus, someone launches Encryptid too.

It's quite thrilling because when you're not fighting, you're scrambling to offload your junk.  We can down the SBQ in about 3-6 minutes.  And the cool thing is that because this is back-to-back, it allows me to test different combinations of weapons and perks so I can understand what works best for me.  I never realized how useful Suppressor was, for example, until I saw how it allowed me to essentially tank the SBQ's wing attacks.
---
To add again to this.
---
Its ludicrous to me the way the atom challenges are atm. We are getting at least two each day that are monumentally easy for people that play with friends and completely impossible for people that play solo. Ok, but Bethesda did state this could be a solo experience but whatever.
---
Why not have challenges that would encourage participation in your own events Bethesda?? Its ridiculous.
---
They're pretty hard to miss, big patchwork looking machines with "Legendary" poorly spelled on the front.
---
Stalker's VATS automatic pipe rifle.
---
this is not the first time it happened to me. i noticed this awhile back doing Uranium Fever... i would loot as soon as the event ended, my habit is to scrap right after the event and i noticed no new weapons, armor, plans, or ammo! of course i got excited with the new event and i ended up missing the reward sequence because i was harvesting insect meat...
---
Super duper perhaps?
---
People will use a fixed fast travel portal to make traps, or troll people like they're Sims in rooms with no doors.
---
so what is an agreed upon price for one of these nowadays?
---
Funny.
---
Pretty much the same with an aae, I've seen people trading in their aae's for tse just for the damage boost it gives.
---
I do this also, I try to not over do it though. The best part about your first playthrough is scavenging and being glad to find stupid little things. If they have 2,000 10mm rounds and tons of armor and scrap, those little finds mean less.
---
gotta get that ant meat for that rad ant lager! better than the backpack if you've got pro drinker and party boy/girl!
---
Pretty sure it's just the area around the club\proshop that was made a no build zone.  I think the other areas of the green are fine (though I haven't checked recently).
---
yeah but it's a pain to transfer weapons from one toon to another if you don't have any friends playing fallout anymore :/
---
Wish they'd make it easier.
---
You really have to be heavy Gunner. I've got a BE handmade sniper, Mutants prime Gauss and it does trash for damage against the queen. I usually lose the fight unless a heavy Gunner comes in. 
---
I use my heavy Gunner and she always dies. I have never lost a queen fight with the heavy Gunner. I think the big factor is the cripple effect and keeps her on the ground while all the level 30s get in their damage and the melees who do ridiculous damage.
---
Agreed.
---
That is not what changing the drop rate ='s. The said RNG algorithm can be programmed for each item, and then table's can be added to that... Basically when you see a game that tells you "this week/day" you get x amount of "bonus" and they show you the "normal" rate for it and the "Math" doesn't add up it's because they can added the said "bonus" to any part of the RNG be it the item or any of the tables its in. "Gatcha" type RNG games do this all the time and it's a scam really when they do mostly... but it is very ez to change the RNG in this way. As for the inventory part, Ive noticed the same thing... but its doesnt mean thats IS what is happen. I also run a higher luck build ATM, before that I had not got a Bloodied or TSE AFTER I put my 1st bloodied as my main use weapon and the TSE in stash I did get another TSE and have got like 12 Bloodied so you can take that for whatever its worth to you... Yes it would be crazy if Big B did track your items for this reason, when Dupe is an issue when if they can do this it should be used to stop that. But I for one don't put it past them because its a "easy fix" and it would explain why with all the claimed server work, my game play crashing is now at its 2nd time highest... even more so now when I loot...
---
To promote vault dweller exercise and independent research of course!
---
Some players out there are also by the laws of probability are going to hit gold on the RNG too...dont forget that
---
for example
---
Good enough!
---
For animals. It's easiest to take pictures of their bodies. For the New River Gorge Bridge you have to take a picture of the bridge from underneath it.
---
lol exactly haha
---
They have already told us that CAMP decorating with junk is coming.
---
this is fair
---
There really is no disadvantage to being low health. In fact it's preferable with Unyielding armor and adrenal reaction. I run low health even when I'm not using bloodied weapons.
---
I don't have adhesive issues, I'm regularly selling bulk to vendor. Plenty of it from junk.
---
its etiquette dumbass. u dont like it? go to russia
---
No. I mean braids.
---
I built them at different times.
---
First one to get the actual camera and mission and another later when I was trying to take photos of fossils and they weren't registering.
---
Resistance is futile.
---
Last time I heard they are brining camp decoration like that to 76 but it’s just a question of when
---
YUP!!! i miss it soooo much...
---
ah yeah i have to agree there, i have one friend i keep bothering to help me mule, shes probably getting tired of it by now
---
whaaaat
---
dammit
---
.. isn't that melee though?
---
Sadly I've found the broken pro snap cameras but without the quest it doesn't show in the tinkers
---
Wes-Tek was experimenting with FEV on the population of Huntersville, with the help of the military, shortly before the bombs fell. This is the source of Super Mutants in F76.
---
Maybe you should relax and move on.
---
Our RNG who art in Fallout 76, hallowed be thy name.  
---
Thy kingdom come.  
---
Thy will be done, in West Virginia as it is in Vault 76.
---
Give us this day our daily legendaries; and forgive us our one-shots, as we forgive those who one-shot against us; and lead us not into Ebay, but deliver us from dupers.
---
I would even be happy if the instruments we can’t build in our camps were in the atomic shop, they’re in the game why can’t we have them in our camps.
---
True, but at least you get to use the vending machine.
---
Bethesda can further refine this by not letting to build stuff around the machine.
---
Ugh, I have speed demon and also 15% faster reload on my B25 .50 cal, but it bugs out at least 50% of the time and doesn't increase speed at all. They really need to fix that.
---
I had a billboard camp once. Used a bunch of rugs to make a "floor" on it.
---
I think I'm gonna redo it.
---
There is no reason besides repair kits to kill her rn
---
You have to be in active PvP with the owner to destroy their camp in survival. Only way to do what you want is to team up with someone and have them attack the person to trigger PvP so their base becomes vulnerable
---
That is seriously the coolest camp I've ever seen,  grats!
---
They mentioned that they were building a “collectors case” type ordeal for us to put our stuff in. I’m assuming it’s just getting the coding down so they no unnecessary bugs/glitches/Easter eggs come out of the addition... plus I pray they make it so nobody can take what you put in out...
---
No, you just don’t get the bonuses of having those four stat points.
---
I'm just more miffed that wind instrument**s** is just a tuba. 
---
I was misled Todd! I was misled!
---
Did you check your inventory? I don't always get the screen "Item Reward" listing but I have always received items.
---
Na, it just lowers the stat. There are passive bonuses of course but it doesn't effect perk cards
---
No. You still get to equip whatever cards you have points for. It only affects your character's special in the pip boy screen but you'll still get to equip the cards
---
I agree. I carry only Lever Action Rifles and have only a few weapons in inventory that aren’t Lever Actions and at L190 I got my first Lever Action as loot a few days ago, a 1* Stalker that went for scrip. 
---
Each time I hear this theory that drops are affected by what you use/carry I have to laugh.
---
No, doesnt effect the number of cards you can equip
---
Test it with Alcohol ... you get a minus there too, and don't have to remove any cards
---
omg
---
It only affects the passive part of the S.P.E.C.I.A.L. So short answer, no.
---
&gt; Once you’ve lined your pockets with some Scrip, travel to the previously abandoned Train Station in Berkeley Springs and find the Purveyor within.
---
This is what Inside the Vault says.
---
If your having trouble with the vertibird one I went to grafton steel and theres a pad you can repair that spawns one. I know doesnt help with the rest but I was stuck on that one for a while.
---
Soooooonnnn
---
thanks for the replies. I'm totally not nervous now :s
---
Because it’s not in a prepackaged pod for easy consumption. Gotta keep it trendy for the vault dwellers on the go after all.
---
Well in parts of the map a low lvl pet get shredded.
---
for melee bias? the reason I ask for it is almost all the weapons that ever drop for me are range despite me being mostly melee build.
---
Agree - or at least improve on the sorting options
---
calm down they are just being nice they obviously have low levels in mind that cant find rad away or a couple of them could just be messing with bloodied builds
---
How many god roll ranged options are there?  
---
Depending on play style, there are a lot of different things considered god roll for someone. Lots of different 'perfect' rolls in each slot. Take slot 2: Explo, VATShit, VATScrit, someone might be satisfied with the 10% aiming for a sniper. As for types, most are viable. Even the pipe weapons have some perk boosts. What's unwanted in ranged? Broadsider, syringer maybe, crossbows, flamer because of the ammo cost. The majority of types are viable  
---
Melee though, half the weapon types are noticeably inferior and no amount of perk juggling is gonna make them perfect for someone. Plus if that second stat isn't swing speed then it probably won't be wanted. So that's 75% of rewards straight back into the converter.  
---
tldr: Ranged get a lot more rewards that \*could\* be useful when modified or perk adjusted.   
---
Melee are after the same few combinations, and most rewards will be useless to everyone.
---
yeah mine is standing outside separately to use if you want. I'm a bloodied build so I get it.
---
"I always feel like somebody's watchin' me..." -Real Sheepsquatch sitting outside the window-  "I ain't got no privacy, oh ohh oh."
---
No. Mutations only lower it stat wise, which influences the durability of  weapons crafted for intelligence and lowers the carry weight for strength. You don't need to unequip cards and can equip new ones if the stat is lowered by external factors like mutations or deceases.
---
Gimme that Typewriter, I'm low on screws anyway ;)
---
There is maybe 1 active mod that I've noticed (I have him/her tagged 'The only active FO76 mod' :P )  Moderation here is severely hit and miss.
---
Only thing I can think of, sometimes if you loot, hit the pipboy, or take some other action while the reward message is up, it will get interrupted and you won't see it.  You'd still get the rewards (mostly stims and purified water, but I'm sure you would have noticed the plans in your inventory if that were the case for you).  Other than that, I haven't heard about issues with this event, sorry I can't be more help.
---
And I get you don't care about your attitude, I don't blame you.  But this isn't about you, it's about the other 180K people here who don't want to have to deal with someone starting a shit show when they have problems.  This is a sub for fans of the game, so yeah no one is going to take well to people shitting on it, but if you have a legit problem or complaint and want to get some help or ideas, check the attitude at the door and people will be more than willing to give you a hand.
---
The super mutants on the east coast are a different breed altogether. They are all dumb.
---
Something tells me that a trap machine would not be loaded with anything to buy.   
---
Not building around the machine defeats the purpose of making a fun storefront.   I've got 4 machines and a ton of accessories around them to make it look good.
---
How much Ajax have you eaten in real life?
---
yes we need this or at least allow offical mod support for it
---
Be sure to get Starched Genes (Rank 2) to make them permanent.  You take the serum then apply the perk card.  Also good idea to get Class Freak (Rank 3) it reduces the negative effects of mutations.
---
Why the hell did I get a fusion powered toaster with a bunch of forks jammed into it?! Eh... fuck it. Time to murder supermutants with launched molten silverware and electrocute some mirelurks. &gt;:)
---
god why can’t the assault rifle be any good
---
What was the Vampire server? I love that prefix, I would have never left.
---
I killed it like 10 mins ago and I got 1* Wooden Armor and 2* raider armor

---
The one that naps in the pond? I live just up the hill from him on the lake. I usually start my sessions by going to visit him and punching him in the face.
---
Oh, sorry, did you send them to my personal or work email?
---
Oh fuck up
---
Mine is upstairs in the main building with it's own little alcove with a proper switch to turn it on or off.   Seems like people know how to turn it on, but not off.  Hmmmm ..... I wonder if they are just forgetful.
---
What kind of tickets? Like raffle tickets? Golden tickets? Baseball tickets? Concert tickets? Parking tickets? Support tickets?

I feel my card that reduces negative effects on muations by 75% isn't working, I'm always running out of food and water really quick

Ramen
---
For Bethesda, anything created by Obsidian is hot lava.
---
I mean I love war drums and would love to have a 3 star one
---
I'm pretty sure I'm a victim of "drops are skewed to what you use" because 90% of my legendaries are melee. Made a bundle off them the first day the vendors came out, all those bloodied thises and thatses sold like hotcakes. But I think I've only ever gotten one legendary war drum.
---
I’ve never gotten a 2 star. This motherfucker up in here like “daddy, I don’t want this car. It isn’t #brand new .”
---
Because this is Reddit and not Bethesda Customer Service.
---
The Mr. Fuzzy suit, on the other hand... now that's rare.
---
sounds like that unique from FO4, damn can't remember, the gun that shot the junk..?
---
I just want to know if buying an item refills the machines script stock at some 1/3 rate like the other vendors.
---
Mine is somewhere around 180-200, and gets higher the lower my health is.
---
I have three points in Weapon Artisan, so repair kits aren't even a reason anymore.  Now it's just stubbornness on my part.
---
Check a bit lower in the thread, I posted a reply with some tips and a kill video taken from one of my live streams where I carry the fight. Basically it comes down to having an optimized high dps build, and that means running a heavy gunner in power armor with 19% HP. Might sound nuts, but you'll still be quite tanky at 19% Hp and be able to take 1-2 hits, using diluted stims in between.
---
That kill video also has the build link. I can't post the build link because it goes to a different subreddit (against fo76 subreddit rules) but I can post the video: [https://youtu.be/buqpQNy7WCE?t=1580](https://youtu.be/buqpQNy7WCE?t=1580)
---
Not gonna lie. The most amusing part of this too me are the clipboards. Best source of springs in the early game.
---
24900 caps to 18500 caps in 3 days.
---
i probably came off a little too harsh and tried to soften towards the end but i dont think you read that far
---
I use a super sledge and a lever action rifle 99% of the time and I still get a ton of crap that has no relevancy to me. I always wondered if playing with certain weapons increased the likelyhood you'd get something you use but in my case it  hasn't been that.
---
The batbois should have legendaries in their loot tables. And it shouldn’t be some stupid low chance. I want to see a legendary every 3-4 SB kill.
---
Was this over at the golf  course, because that place stayed a wasteland the entire time I was online. 
---
I am still working to get nukes myself. 
---
[Can you do Back to Basic again? Is it repeatable. Getting these commendations is a pain in the ass.
---
I'VE GOT A GOLDEN TICKET I'VE GOT A GOLDEN TWINKLE IN MY EYE
---
why do you die? Have you not maxxed out sneak? Also, when wearing a full set of unyielding, you get ridiculous agility bonuses that make you essentially invisible when sneaking. I'm all unyielding all the time now.
---
My apologies. Thats not cool. I am completely against censoring any opinion.
---
If I can do 1000 dmg per hit with a power fist, dmg seems fine. That's just a normal power fist, not a bloodied
---
I tried using conduit but it makes building bug out and I have to relog to be able to build again.
---
Bruh, the original post literally had the word FUCKING in it once. How is that a big deal? Its when other fuckbois come into the room and start taunting that they get a bit of the bitch puddin'. Now it's a problem? Hah! Though, i do get what you're saying, those who engage in civil discourse are 'usually' given civility. 
---
Check my attitude? You mean the way bethesda checks its code? :smirk:
---
I found two 3* single action revolvers within an hour of each other the other day.
---
The reason for finding the 2nd one could have been because I had one in my inventory....or because it's a shit weapon that Bethesda has programmed to randomly drop more than a Handmade. I should take this moment to add that 25% fire rate doesn't work on a single action revolver.
---
The word 'random' in these types of games is used loosely. If a slot machine picked certain numbers more than others and did not disclose that information, the game would be referred to as 'rigged' not 'random'.
---
Probably Melee or shotgun
---
&gt; There's an unspoken rule that is if you're selling say 5k 5mm for 2k you'll sell a single bullet for 2k and then give the remaining 4999 rounds for free.
---
.. what?
---
You can cheat, and use doorways to pass wire thru walls. Put a connector over an open doorway, replace doorway wall with solid wall, walk to the opposite side of that wall, place another connector near the top of where the door would be, then replace the wall with the open doorway. Attach wire to connectors, replace wall with the solid wall.
---
As opposed to now, where it takes minimal effort to find out where people will fast travel in, and then they can build their trap around that point if they wanted to?
---
On reddit you have to be lucky for someone to check while they're playing. I found mine through the Fallout 76 Discord. Perhaps someone there is willing to help you out https://discordapp.com/invite/rx9Z4wY
---
Just to be clear, you don't get the extra carry weight for those 4 str points, but you do keep all the perk card perks that you have equipped, and the -4 doesn't remove the ability to put in those 4 perk card points.  The penalty is applied outside the prek system, so you don't get *more* perk cards with a +4 str, and you don't *lose* 4 perk cards when you have -4 str.
---
As in "Letting us place things when they're green" or as in "Stopping things from going green"?

Amen, fellow member.

The imposter should drop a dev room. 
---
That mother fucker is way harder. 
---
Either send a dev to my house to suck me off when I beat it, or remove the timer.
---
What graphics card is that? And is that in 16k?
---
I recently moved my CAMP and made a simple dock with a shack next door. My first good one was a motel, and then I made a bar right next to the Overseer camp. I guess in one of the last patches they increased the area where you can't build near it.
---
I noticed this too and believe that's a plausible theory.
---
I agree completely. If not that make a separate map icon right under the Whitespring Resort on the map labeled “Whitespring Resort Lobby”.
---
I took a couple months off from FO76 and recently came back about two weeks ago.   I'm having a really good time and I think Bethesda is doing a decent job with the patches.   
---
The one thing that hasn't been patched that I remember wanting so bad is preset perk loadouts.   It wouldn't be that hard and would be a huge QoL upgrade.  People were asking for this not too long after launch and it's still a great idea.
---
Yes exactly!
---
You on PS4?  This was happening to me a TON and was suggested that I trim down my friends list which I did and the crashes are not happening as often any more.  Want to play Fallout?  Ditch your friends hahahha
---
???
---
I recent got a BE handmade and BE lever action, leveled up a fully optimized vats crit sniper, and was able to stay in stealth for 90% of the fight against SBQ. 5 minutes I was sitting there shooting her and doing next to no damage with either the HM or LA. Brought in my heavy gunner and she was dead in 2 minutes. It really is true - heavy weapons are where it's at for sustained dps. And honestly? That's how it should be dammit. This is what those weapons are made for.
---
I doubt it... He screenshot doesn't show a scrip counter she "owns". Normal vendors show their caps on the right. She doesn't have any scrip.
---
yeah man, for sure. I had my wife (who was playing and getting rewards) doublecheck. Nathan bro, i got nathan.
---
I ran around with a bloodied sledgehammer for a long time and I've gotten bloodied golf clubs, bloodied pitchforks, a bloodied rail gun, a bloodied gauss rifle, a bloodied bowie knife, a bloodied death tambo (!!!) and a bloodied deathclaw gauntlet (!!!!!). That can't be just RNG.
---
agreed
---
And trolling people in rooms with no doors can't be any worse than the fast travelling into someone's foundations. Which already happens frequently. Which would be avoided with... placeable fast travel mats!
---
It looks like real life e🤔
---
there would need to be a separate icon.  I don't want to fast travel to the resort only to have to go outside to go farming.
---
What you mean you cant get a quad black powder?
---
I... WANT... THAT......ALL
---
no worries brother! I would probably have done the same, but seriously, censorship is bad and does no one any favors!
---
Love the idea
---
I need an antiarmor drill and furious wrench for my Mario build.
---
damn dude I want whatever loot roll you got, the last legendary melee i got was a fucking one star rolling pin LOL i am not kidding.
---
ImonPC but I have a bunch of random people in my friends list so I’ll give that a try. Thank you.
---
Full unyielding really only benefits melee builds. As a  bloodied rifleman, I run 2 unyielding, 2 bolstering, and 1 chameleon.
---
I still get +6 to STR, PER, and AGI, but I also get an additional 70 DR/ER.
---
Yeah lol. Heavy gunners should be the mass damage dealers. Now only if they appropriated explosives in line with some better expectations of weight vs damage 🤣
---
Well, Nocturnal has a higher drop rate at night anyway.
---
Just before shit went down, Rose changed the highway signs to create confusion.  You just fell for it.  smh
---
Currently working on sneak! I've 1* of either perk and I've got 3 perk points, waiting for the 4th and final to max them both out in one swing.
---
Does sneaking work that effectively with melee and maxed sneak cards? I've always pushed it off because I figured enemies would still detect you during melee encounters, but if the cards at that dumdum OP then I'll have to revisit my SPECIAL points.
---
Same, I had a bunch of friends that either never turn their systems on or whom I never play games with  so it was a much needed purge anyways .  You're welcome!
---
Okay, worth a shot to ask. Sorry couldn't help.
---
Wait, there's a guaranteed behemoth spawn point?  Where at?
---
so true, i find it so stupid that beth made such a dumb thing, or are they not able to implement it this way?
---
Me too bud. Hopefully just anytime now 🎵🎶
---
I don't bother using that. I live on ionized meat and inert flux. Every week I do 1-2 WS farming sessions where I clear / respawn the entirety of nuked WS over and over for 2.5 hours until the nuke clears. Come away with 200-300 mass / high rad fluids and ionized meat. Keeps me fed for a long time. I'll also do one round of flux gathering, get like 300+ of it, and let it spoil, which gives me 300+ inert flux, which is as good or better than purified water. I also run Carnivore, which makes ionized meat ideal - plus it helps keep my rads high so I can stay at 19% HP.
---
It was brick laying.  I mean you just stack them on top of each other, what's to learn?
---
I’m just glad people finally visit my torture room.
---
Probably.  Snipers and unarmed builds seem to be the meta, however.
---
Cherry on top was adrenal reaction bug, we were able to kill queen in 3mins full setup even after TSE nerf, but when this bug happened after some patch, majority of group left.
---
I tried nuking alone, yeah i can do silo in 15minutes (our runners were using texture glitch so 7minutes for them before). But then i must use atleast 4k ammo to kill queen, if atleast some random people join, she can bug and fly of, or i can DC so it became waste of time, instead of great endgame.
---
Which prefixes should I be looking for if I wanna buy 3* unyielding armor pieces?
---
I’m with you except for the 3 star being crap. 
---
That’s kind of the point, yeah? It’s a chance for a good/useful item *and* not one, not two, but THREE good rolls to be good. 
---
Shit is rare rare.
---
This brings me to another thought:
---
If I slapped down 2 pieces of bolstering I could wipe out my 3* Ironclad card.
---
Surely it would be pretty easy to implement? When you hover over a location, and that location has an entrance to a part of the game that requires a new loading screen, it should give you the option to either spawn inside, or spawn outside.
---
I need to get back into back-to-back launches. I've got over 30 keycards piling up, and they're just taking up so much space.
---
Thank you for submitting a ticket.
---
Can you please submit more? We're out of toilet paper in the customer response office...
---
I found one last night at the train yard near white spring train station.
---
That still depends on how and what quests you have done... if you do them all as is... its just whatever you feel like being... but if say don't do any Enclave then it's truly not an option. Plus your playing Solo etc, is not lore it is YOU in your Avatar, which in turn means whatever else you do with what you learn about the lore is what group lore-wise you'd be... if you played FO4 that really was a dilemma at times...
---
If charisma is lowered it will change what perks you can share. Other than that it will only affect derived stats, ap for agility, carry weight for strength, hp for endurance, etc
---
It's the printout that really sells it. 😂
---
We had a queen go down like that earlier. You get a lot of people with the right builds and guns and she evaporates.
---
Yes.  
---
With the addition of player vending I've had people show up in a couple different spots, though I always seem to materialize in the same position.   
---
For the record, I like the idea of a fast travel mat, I was upset when it was removed after beta.
---
Lol poor vault boys all getting betaed
---
She should also drop more flux.
---
I think they should make her the only enemy to start dropping the 4 and 5 star legendarys. At the moment I just don't see the value in using 2-3k 50 cal ultracite ammo to take her out.
---
There's already like three or four icons right there on top of each other, shouldn't be an issue.
---
But I mean it helps the economy imo. They want us to make this world our own, so let us! It would create new job opportunities for young wastelanders &amp; old! Furnish my house with some atom shop items I don’t have &amp; I’ll drop you some caps or maybe I have some stuff you don’t have! It would be a good system &amp; would take away from the “H: DUPED GOD ROLL GUN LOL W: YOUR WIFE &amp; KIDS”
---
I use 3 Unyielding and 2 bolstering and it works a treat
---
Sweet! I found the BoS Combat Armor mod plans at the Grafton Train Station. I'm level 190 on this character and I had never even been there before!
---
I thought the same thing so I was REALLY surprised to find out I could basically sneak up to things in broad daylight right in front of them. Basically the only time anything can detect me, in my full set of unyielding that is, is if I accidentally get too close and actually bump into them.
---
Unfortunately there are instances where the game engine says "screw you" and spawns things in that automatically detect you. This happens in the burrows and the campfire event.
---
no worries! thanks for trying!
---
Almost certainly.  
---
Otherwise they'll have to flag every single weapon the Purveyor sells with a special flag to tell the purveyor not to accept it. And then that flag would have to be visible to players so they know they're not buying an unscrippable legendary. And all that would have to be recorded on every purveyor item on every character at all times. It's a needless server burden.  
---
Basically, you're randomly buying a weapon you want to keep for 100 scrip, and if you 'lose' and don't want it, it only costs you 60 scrip.
---
Yes, I know that, but i believe they are talking display cases.  Those will be great, but I like to put stuff down in odd places.  I have Sheepsquatch plushies and rabbits and Fallout lawnboys all over the place now. Being able to put a mini Buttercup down without building a case would be great.
---
Agreed! Missile launchers and fatmans should be dealing massive damage. You know what they could do to balance it? Make the queen and other large enemies into a new sub class of enemy called "colossal enemies", and have explosive deal 4-5x extra damage against that enemy type.
---
If your on PC I have a 1* bloodied war drum for sale.
---
I agree on the whole wizardry point for sure. But most of the energy wepons, even b4 war, where prototypes, and as far as the lasers or tesla goes, with the availability of fusion cells and what not, technically doable with instructions.
---
How many different ranged weapons are there? I'm quite sure it's not 33% when you list actual base models - revolver / gun / heavy.
---
There are lots of gun versions - I think they represent majority...
---
Are you talking PVE or PVP?
---
drat! I'm on ps4!
---
There’s two different cameras you find in the wild. You need the pro deluxe one to make a new camera.
---
“I got 2 legendaries but they weren’t what I wanted so it’s broken.”
---
I mean yeah both bloodied and adrenal reaction got nerfed, but they're still the highest dps by a long ways. I might go through 2K ultracite .50 cal but that's not that bad imo, since I craft it by the hundred thousands.
---
God, I love this post. Unfortunately the only other Fallout game I've played is 4, but that's the one that really got me into the Fallout series, and I'd like to get back into trying to do 3 and would also like to try out the others if possible. Reading about how all the Vault 111 folks are still frozen, and that the Institute won't form for another 8 years, gave me some serious chills. It's crazy to think about the fact that I've just been wandering around Appalachia since October, having lots of fun with my teammates, but all the while in game all of this other shit is going on elsewhere. Insane.
---
PVE
---
That just acknowledges my point.
---
Yeah I’ve had this feeling too. I want to put a collection of all the nuka cola’s in my fancy bar display :-/ or some exotic drinks anything to show off when people are taking a look at my machine or just visiting the base in general. I’d also love to show off my collection of Tales of the Wasteland.. if I could only get Vol. 2😓
---
Of which I've only seen on the corpse twice, and after that it stops spawning on them, not seen it in a loot drop anywhere else!
---
I really appreciate this insight, it will help me steer into a better build I feel like. 
---
Also, on the subject of auto-detecting enemies, my friends and I always joke about Bethesda making eyebots for the soul purpose of ruining sneak builds. I guess that isn't a joke anymore, lmao.
---
I realize it's not new, but yesterday I bumped into the Wavy Willard's Bot.  I'm not sure I had ever heard its spiel before, and unfortunately I still won't, because what ended up happening?
---
"WHEE ERGH WHEE ERGH WHEE ERGH"
---
"THIS IS GRAFTON'S MAYOR!"
---
Oh God, I just want to smash that computer.  I really do.  He's not useful.  He's not funny.  He deserves to be unplugged and scraped for parts.
---
Ha! I forgot all about that one - super fun. :)
---
I don’t get why people still fight her beyond the quests.
---
It’s never been fun.
---
It’s never had proper incentive.
---
Just don’t go to fissure prime
---
Ignore the thing that hasn’t worked since release.
---
It’s as worthless as the people that programmed her by this point.
---
I don't make excuses for the moderation team here, it's all over the place, and not in a good way.  I doubt you'd get much argument about that little fact...
---
And it takes 1 person to check your attitude.  It would take a whole room full of people to check the spaghetti code that makes up this hatchet job of a FO4 remake :P  
---
Honestly, I feel sorry for the team that had to try to make this mess into a AAA game - they inherited it and had no prior experience with FO or much of anything else.  The one game they did have under their belt before this, I'd never heard of and I have no idea if it was even remotely similar to FO.  They've been running blind since day 1 and I'm honestly surprised it's working as well as it is (not that that's saying a lot).
---
Hence the "depending on prefix"
---
Obviously certain in demand items are going to go for a bit more money.
---
Another setllement needs your chess board
---
I'll check it out, thank you!
---
Especially loading in from startup into a nuke zone without PA... did that once... once...lol
---
Agree.  
---
For the same reason how about a fast travel point that goes *directly* into the Bunker once you have access?
---
Last night my wife and I both made a mistake in buying the new mohawks. She plays a female and I a male, and we bought the opposite hairstyles becasue those were the ones we liked best. Neither of us paid enough attention to the text explaining which gender it was for. Waste of atoms.
---
Hey speaking of missile launcher, I have a targeting computer on mine and when I lobe 4 missiles at a scorchbeast, if the scorchbeast is panning side to side it deals next to no damage. But if it's hovering it deals a little bit more than no damage. You had that experience with them?
---
As far as perks per level I'm not the guy to ask. I took perks to make the game easier at early levels and used a lever action until higher levels. 
---
Like earlier FOs there is a compromise regarding what perks you end up running but I'll tell you I have no issues shooting lvl 80 SBs out of the sky with any of my Furious rifles.
---
Even a non-legendary combat rifle is deadly with a crit commando build. You may be surprised and find you don't need a bloodied rifle.
---
Doesn't work with Speed Demon.
---
I went on Survival mode for the first time ever just to get it, then I found out it was bugged.
---
First- who the hell told you anything is fair?
---
... they already got your money, their focus is on obtaining other peoples money (or more of your own).
---
&gt; or they will get rid of the scrap machines and let you directly sell for scrips to vendor.
---
Yea... that's not happening. The machine is fully animated, modeled, textured, and has sound. It's here to stay. With the Purveyor, it likely that they will either not let you sell scrip to her directly, or not be able to and just use the machine.
---
From what I noticed, I think it is bugged. I just don’t have a person on PC to team up with to do the kill a scorchbeast as a team. The other 3 I got in a team while in adventure mode though.
---
Also need to remember that would flood the legendary market while making 2* and 1* useless,
---
Standing around with just underwear on at WS helped resolve the situation...
---
 I would recommend Serendipity in LCK if you don't have it already. Probably the **best** defensive perk. I also swap in/out dodgy and blocker for more mitigation, depending on what I'm doing.
---
If your account is suspended or banned (not saying it is) your ticket will be the lowest priority so expect 2-3 weeks.
---
I wouldn’t use xur because after a bit he was useless &amp; no one went back to him lol. Especially now that the “god roll” guns are duped to dirt these days. Once you get a gun you love if you don’t already have it then we’ll probably all be saving our scrip for if they ever give us new weapons or armor with legendary effects then we’ll have to grind or buy from her again. I believe at this point though everyone besides new players has THAT weapon that is their idea of god roll because there isn’t one perfect legendary they fit for diff builds &amp; such
---
I remember pointing this out at beta.     Some locs,  a conked out pompodure,  a nice round afro, wct would be dope.
---
Good point, I agree with you
---
It’s the pro so I’d have to look
---
THE OFFICE DESK FAN. Awesome collection man!
---
So building them fresh and new is going to require lumber, and paint, and hardware, and insulation, and a ton of other things that we are going to have to salvage because the entire industrial base of the old world is gone.
---
I would honestly be amazed to find a 25 year old can of paint that was usable let alone enough to paint a house.
---
I used a missile launcher like once and put it away heh. Been months since I tried so I couldn't say.
---
I'd also agree that, if I die in a silo, I would like to respawn *inside* the silo, not outside.
---
Just like in most online (especially open world) games.  Some do a good job of hiding it by covering things up for a while, or by not even bothering to load the player in or display the world until everything is loaded.
---
I'm not sure I'd be happier with a 20 second longer load time instead of a bit of lag at the start.  Personal preference I guess.
---
Glowing pustules is just radioactive herpes
---
My favorite moments are playing with my friends, but a few days ago, i had a awesome moment. I went to someones camp to browse their shop and it was being attacked by scorched in the back and broke a wall. I killed them and repaired the wall. I sent the person a messege telling them about the area they gad no defense. To thank me they gave me a mutation
---
It's the Fallout 76 Circle of Life, after all! :D
---
Inert flux is the best water in the game. Lighter than purified, gives you 1/3 of a thirst bar per unit.
---
Ok lol 😂😂😂
---
This is really cool. I would also guess that Lorenzo Cabot is currently locked in the asylum while his son sucks his blood and performs his experiments. I doubt there's very much from 4 that can be placed in this time. Maybe something from Nuka World or Far Harbor. I wonder when the Children of Atom got started.
---
I think your specific question has been answered.  However, I haven't seen anyone mention class freak.  If you run a lot of mutations, you absolutely need level 3 of class freak under luck.  It negates 75% of all negative side effects from mutations.
---
Need the desk fan
---
I've got serendipity on standby, I throw it on in desperation. 
---
I've read about dodgy but have yet to pick up on it. 
---
Also, I axed blocker for the 3rd, maxed out 2handed perk haha. Kinda wishing I could break down cards back into 2's and 1's so I could shuffle on a 1* blocker on my 15 Strength
---
That's not a bad way to go about it. I might just save myself the perl card slots
---
Can be done in adventure mode if that's the bug you are asking.
---
I've got 1 of them so far (I don't usually team.up)
---
Anyone know if the green hood is rare or valuable? I never saw one for the first 300 hours I played the game and then I found two in two days last week.
---
Is that on purpose or not? Because I imagine that should be really easy to make work
---
What is dead may never die.
---
Great post! 
---
Fell in love with Fallout franchise when I was a kid, and remembering all of these brings good memories :) 
---
Poor Richard, He could of done so much good :(
---
Also used them to access parts of the map they shouldn't have been able to.
---
I found him at the teapot. On my 1st try..... :D
---
Seems like a pretty useful build against SBQs. How does you cripple her? Is it from a perk that causes heavy guns to cripple or is it a limb damage mod on your gun? Just curious since I may try a build like this someday.
---
IMO, to \*really\* get the best out of a bloodied build, you're going to need full sentinel + dodgy + serendipity
---
So I'm happy to have a full set of one star unyielding. Also because I happen to have dodgy on I also keep an eye out for ap regeneration. Sentinel or cavalier are still pretty awesome also, of course, but kind of overkill for pve. Not really worth the caps imo if you are not pvping.
---
Gonna be some long lines today!
---
BREATHE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
---
ok, now we can talk
---
I hear you about the tedious nature of some of them, and it is crap that some are not even working for sure
---
BUT
---
Im glad they didnt just give us something the entire community ripped through in an hour...
---
that being said, one of the main reasons i stopped playing destiny was they introduced quests objectives for the forges that were more akin to a job, too many hoops to jump through, too much grind
---
I am kinda feeling that now with some of these, as if Bethesda created some for  the sole reason to pad out time
---
there has to be a balance between fun,engaging content and time sinks just to keep player retention on servers
---
No, I specifically referring to the one that can be crafted into a usable camera. I'm aware there are other camera junk items.
---
\&gt;.&lt; good eye.
---
They’re all over the place. Sometimes the vendor at white springs even has one.
---
I find at least one a day.
---
I and a few others found Anne at Bolton Greens on the fountain outside the front door. 
---
This was over the last few days including this morning...
---
I agree nothing worse then getting a drill or nothing at all
---
This is an older part of the idea that it added 100%. That is incorrect, their was a bug where berserker weapons would display the berserker damage after you equipped it over the actual berserker damage on the item showing a 50% increase over the already 50% shown you would have to unequipped and re-equip to get the correct damage. 
---
When wearing PA or high defense items will give it a 0% increase. It seems that the % is based on tiers of Defense with 1 DR up to a number being a set reduction (current patch gave 1DR to all equipable and 1 ghost DR even if nothing was equipped being a drop in 15% damage up to at least 3 DR didn't seem to change this). 
---
I have tested this with over 100 Berserker Items (I currently have 130+ on an alt, and I did a write up on this as well). Un-equipping and re-equipping these items after putting on PA or armor would show the correct damage.
---
Did they release the Purveyor update yet today?
---
I’ve got photos of me posing in front of the “nudes” sign he had up. It was a classy joint for sure!
---
A 1\*?  I don't think even a 3\* TSE is worth that.  Would have to be an IE or such to be worth that much to someone.
---
Good lawd, not a chance.
---
I was vault doors again!
---
They impact the SBQ's HP pool
---
No but everyone sees it: there is a pattern of quick downvotes before the real score is revealed on most posts in this sub.
---
Sentinel has always been trash to me, idk why. At the point of just standing still my melee ruins that, so if I were to pull 3* armor I would prefer it to be unyield/bolst, powered, +SPECIAL
---
Nahh I wouldn’t pay that much maybe if it was a 3*
---
I’d rather have an instigating dragon anyways
---
More importantly, it's boring. Get creative, people! I put mine just inside the door to my power shed, which is done up to look like a mineshaft, with the shower and a red light bulb hooked up to a switch. Turn it on for a badass cave-in effect!
---
I highly recommend doing the other games as soon as possible
---
I just made it to the Poseidon Oil Rig and I plan to finish up 3 and 4 as soon as possible
---
And yes, its incredible how all of these stories are occurring at the same time as you.
---
I can't even find the vendor. I'm at the station but there's no door I can enter through or anything.
---
And bloatfly
---
haha thx. I have no idea about how the whole cap currency things go. thx for answering.
---
Well, Maxon wants to kill all synths, right? Close enough.
---
If the vending machine is on a second floor or a raised foundation, the problem would still be present. You’d end up on the ground before the structure spawned in. 
---
The best way (before they fix asset loading order) is either fast travel mats that can only be placed directly on the ground, or spawning you in outside the build area.
---
Yeah one gun army in luck tree.
---
I have 3 banjos in my stash. They’re considered “junk”
---
If someone dies in front of you do "take all", take only the valuables or protect the bag until the owner comes back? 
---
If someone has a work shop you need yo do try and team up for it or just fight them for it?
---
Where do you "hangout"/do most of your farming?
---
You seek out bouty players or just keep doing your own thing? 
---
Power armor or nah?
---
I'm thinking the same. "A bit" overpriced
---
If you’re buying I have 2 - 3* Dragons and you can have both for 10k...
---
I just made it to the Poseidon Oil Rig and I plan to finish up 3 and 4 as soon as I'm done
---
Do people get a lot of drills? I've been playing since the original stress test on Xbox and never seen one, legendary or normal
---
I'm sorry sir, you're in a Wendy's drive-thru
---
The dragons aren't as viable now that the reloading glitch was fixed.
---
Nah, sometimes I get the OH Crap! factor when I log into an unexpected nuc zone there.  After some cursing, killing something, running away and drowning some radaway... I think to myself...self! That was dumb! Why did you log out at WS....again! Makes it ...interesting :)
---
If its 1* - I'd say 3k caps is tops anyone might pay for it.
---
For sure. They should do it like Diamond City in Fallout 4. One for the general location and another icon for Diamond City Market. They’ve done it before. Idk why they didn’t do it here with Whitesprings.
---
The pool of water at the encryptid event counts
---
Seems kind of steep to me.  I have a Nocturnal explosive with faster reload that is awsome at night, but you only get about 15 to 20 shots before you have to repair it and I have lvl 3 weapon artisan.  The durability really hinders it from being an everyday weapon.  The only real reason I keep it is because the damage is lunacy when I set up a night time sniper.
---
Not even a 5* quad instigating two shot explosive 250 damage reduction while reloading The Dragon would be worth that.
---
That's the twist: we are the both some of first super mutants and the first of the children of atom. We enjoy running around irradiated areas and dropping nukes to create more of them. We drink drinks that make us see things and black out.
---
LMG sucks. Minigun sucks. All for the reasons you give.
---
Go with Gatling. Sustained damage output is very good, easier to stay on target with shots instead of spraying the general area. And about 200-300 ammo per SBQ fight is way better than 2000.  
---
I have no problem with the queen, even if only a few people show up. one * Bloodied, furious, AA, zealots are all easy to find and do an outstanding job. TSAA or TSE are better, of course, but they are much harder to obtain, and not at all a requisite.
---
I agree, it's the apocalypse and if I never wanna get clean, aside from going for irradiated swims, that's my perogative and ain't no shower gunna get this waster.
---
I would add in another point to the OP's list.  That is if you are spending script to only get certain specific combinations it might be more cost effective to buy \*\* items instead of \*\*\*
---
So if you are looking specfically to get an AAE/TSE/BE weapon for example you would get twice as many chances by choosing \*\* weapons at 50 script instead of \*\*\* weapons for 100 script.
---
I know there are reasons why folks still rather choose \*\*\* rolls instead but just saying \*\* might be a better option depending on what you want, what you already have, or what you want to sell to others afterwards.
---
Definately not, I had an AAE The Dragon and couldn't even get 10k for it.
---
it's a 3 star dragon. but I've spent months just to grind up to 22000 caps. so i guess I'll skip :v thx
---
Fuck Grandpa Joe cabbage eating swine

Who's the "this dude"
---
I’m about at the point where I can nuke fissure site prime, don’t get to play games much. What’s your best advice for taking her down? I see so many people talk about failing the event so it’s got me curious
---
The weekly weapon challenge? We did it yesterday in adventure mode. It worked and was easy to do.
---
Every time you ring this bell, a duper loses their wings
---
Found the deaf one
---
just for her to show up, drop off the gun, and leave?  I can make that happen
---
That could actually work quite well, but I'd still like to be able to choose where on the outside though. Also, make it so the spawn point has to be placed on terrain, to prevent spawns directly over cliffs.
---
Because I don't want to pay the fine I figure if I ignore it it will go away
---
I would rather see the mods spread throughout the add-on mobs. More incentive for people to clear the yard trash.
---
Is like saying "as fresh as a cool summers eve"
---
oh wait... thats not right...
---
LOL I get your point, but slots are part of the Gambling something or another group, so where I live and in many states and some countries that are part of it, Slots are RNG and it's because under the groups rules the Casino have to tell what the "over all" of the RNG is... so the way that most of them at least in my state and the states around me which all have 96% "win rating" they will watch which machines hit big and more so often then remove those lol Thats how come you see those big groups of one type of slot then the next time its broken up. Its also why you only see a small amount of the "poker" type slots, because those have to be based on the Math odds of a deck of cards, which when the Slot has to pay via the RNG locked at the "over all win rate"  they can give you the best chance to make money... you find a guy online that breaks all this down... but RNG don't have to be rigged they are always unfair to the end-user at best lol Just they can adjust just how unfair...
---
And THEN wait for everything to load up before you can walk anywhere.
---
I have these small items in my work cube

I finally found mine at the Col. Kelly monument, which most people recommend checking.   
---
I had server hopped the night before and never found it.   I found it there the next day when I just happened to be in the area for an event.   I forget which one. 
---
But, yeah, what he said...  to avoid constantly checking you would have to find a live post, similar to finding Graham.   
---
FYI:  Lately I’ve found Graham stuck in one of the small buildings just outside of Thunder Mountain Power plant.  My base is near there.
---
I sneak with melee but be prepared to die a lot insane damage for little health I use  4 unyielding and 1 chameleon armor piece and I can follow Yao Guai' s around without them detecting me when I farm acid. I recently came across a bloodied death claw gauntlet it does 1226 base damage now I know why all those annoying players run around with them.
---
Marsupial is a -4 intelligence. It isn't noticeable because bethesda didn't do what they did innnew vegas and have it visually affect dialogue and crafting.
---
In my opinion marsupials should have problems doing things like loading holotapes into their pipboy because even the smartest of them is in the lower 75%
---
Plague walker is absolutely an issue, you have to be diseased for it to work, think about it. Are you going to hang around someone with all these diseases?
---
Electrically charged people would constantly be shocking anyone that bumped into them. I can't think of a faster way to drive off your friends than tazing them every 10 seconds.
---
Herbivore and carnivore are both terrible changes to the human condition that cut your available food sources in half.
---
You may not see a disadvantage or drawback here but all of these mutations greatly change the human condition and warp characters into something far worse that we are visually seeing in game.
---
hahahahahahahahaaa...no.
---
smaller than fortnite.. bigger than anthem...
---
Yeah, would be nice to have the option to teleport straight inside

Do you know the other perks?
---
Alright, thanks for clearing that up for me.
---
I did once witness 5 nukes being dropped, I was level 25 and just got a hazmat. Wanted to  see what the nuke zones feel like. But while entering a terminal, my game crashed. I assume it crashed for other ppl too since I got a few team invites shortly after (guess their game crashed too, and just added me from the recently played list so they can join the same server)
---
I mean, yes, that is the point and that's why I said it.  The likelihood of getting the 3 rolls you want, on the specific item you want, is extremely low, on top of the remarkably low probability of a 3\* enemy actually dropping a 3\* item.  So why be stingy about it?
---
The SBQ actually takes effort to kill.  So does the Imposter Sheepsquatch.  It's hard for me to rationalize why it's not okay for those to be guaranteed 3\* drops when some random Mirelurk in the middle of the Mire, which requires no special effort, can offer the exact same odds.
---
Yeah, I got to do Queen Of The Hunt a grand total of twice before it broke forever. Which sucks because it was easily my favourite.
---
Not at all..
---
Do you mean file size?
---
If so it’s 64.5 gb.
---
Totally
---
it's good for leveling up. kinda.
---
 Apart from being in the 70s for my level at the time I discovered knives, I am also 72 years old. So no, the knives will have to do. ;)
---
I think it's 54gb.
---
I got a bloodied lead pipe. I decided I am using that mofo. Levelling up a one-handed melee pistoleer, since I have a bloodied .44 put away.
---
Sorry, I didn't mean which perks to take at which level. I meant what rank do you have in the relevant build perks like Commando, Concentrated Fire, Gun Fu, Grim Reapers Sprint, Four Leaf Clover, Crit Savvy, etc.
---
I think that's one of those outfits that is in an area that wasn't frequented so it became functionally rare, even though there's a fixed spawn. But now, with the pioneer scouts quest sending you over there, I'm guessing you'll see more people with it and the price will gradually drop. I know if I had seen it at a camp near whitespring before I knew about the spawn, I would've probably dropped 1k on each piece. I'm sure there are others that still will until the know about the spawn location.
---
I've heard it's at the daily reset. So take a look atcher dailies.
---
LOL, I am offering up almost every 1\* item in my vendor store for 100 caps (with a current top cost of 225 caps for more premium/desirable/playable legendary weapons).
---
Although, there's no harm in asking for such a steep price. Maybe someone will drop 21000 caps for it.
---
5 hours later and still not dead from hunger or thirst haha

That being the case, it's 10.39 eastern US time on Thursday May 16th, and Ansel is at the Giant Teapot. Gamertag is BuckyKatt98 and I'll be online for a bit more, for anyone else looking for the dude.

Class clown strikes again

That's terrible, but I THINK I know what you mean compared to fortnite.

I would totally be behind the map continuously evolving due to new story based events. I'd like to see an evolving wasteland, perhaps every large event is like a new years starting.
---
Still not dead after 5 hours
---
I am justhappy to see this get some attention. Everytime I posted anything about it get like 3 replies and I thought it was just me. I miss the mire quest. Live in the mire just for those quest please give them back
---
You get whatever the going rate is now based on the number of stars.
---
Ever since this last update( ever upward ) . I've had significantly better loot dropping . I haven't seen it mentioned by anyone else yet. Is it just my luck or are there any others that have noticed a change? Most three star enemies are giving me three or two star drops.
---
Server hops, not hours
---
A 3* in whitesprings is guaranteed to to drop a legendary, and more often than not it is a 2 or 3 star one.
---
The odds aren't so bad. e.g. For ranged weapons there 23 Prefix Modifiers and 7 Major Modifiers. Therefore you get a 1:161 chance to get a 2\* something you want. If you are talking about value, aae, be, a50, b50, a25, b25. 6:161 chance. So 1:26 chance which is way better than creature RNG. The odds get even more if you include tse, IE, FE etc.
---
I def agree that Bethesda Austin got thrown a serious dumpster fire and that it wasn't okay to do that to such a new studio that did not have the EXP to handle it.
---
That being said, that means I really do have a reason to be ticked off, as we are all aware the game is bad. Some of us are just a bit more vocal when we're at our limits, and Bethesda has been pushing my buttons since launch. 
---
On that end, kudos for making the game run for a while without crashing? Something bethesda's main studio havent been able to do!
---
Maybe it spins so fast it shoots the drill bit out.
---
I actually found 4 of them last night
---
You have to "learn" to play Sentinel.

I think by virtue of having used Rooted in Fallout 4, the whole "Run up, freeze, hit" mechanic is muscle memory for me.
---
Fallout GO
---
What about the Witcher 3? Hair physics are also real good. Is it only partially rendered in that game?
---
Nope have 3 or 4 currently
---
 I submitted one a little while ago. They got right back and we eventually solved my problem.
---
 Not sure why you are being ignored.
---
I think my friend smacks for low 2000's in his Bloodied DCG haha
---
Well, you're better off clearing WS... even if it isn't nuked. You usualy get 3* legendary and few lesser ones. And added few pieces of flux and 27th copy of ultracite explosive vents plan doesn't really justify the time/effort you have to put to kill Ing the SBQ.
---
For far too many, "want" and "need" have the same meaning.
---
That sounds great and as a Bar owner, I'm sure you would like to display all the types of liquor too. I literally collected at least one of everything you could possibly pick up in the other Fallouts.  I know you can't ever do that with this version and we will be limited by how much can be displayed.  I am looking forward to the cases to be able to show certain unique things as trophies of a sort.  I just want more stand alone items to place around wherever.  I think they only want those type items to come out of the Atomic Shop though.
---
hey get real, you are wandering in the wasteland, eating questionable food you scavenge, hardly ever change your clothes, and are usually covered int he entrails of your defeated enemies...
---
in other words..
---
YOU STINK!
---
People that set up decon arches just want to keep the smell out of their CAMPS, you filthy animal!
---
:)
---
Still not optimal for me I feel like, plus with the nerf I'm even more discouraged from it tbh.
---
I like the back to the future car too
---
The machine that breaks legendaries down is totally separate from the Purveyor, I would think it would keep operating that way it does now. 150 scrips per day regardless of how many legendaries you are purchasing.
---
No prob! If you are interested https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/b9dqur/pc_thehoboseer_berserker_build_or_how_urgency/
---
I used to have a typewriter from the late 1800's
---
Got lost somewhere along the way.
---
I wanted to go look for a mechanical typewriter from the same period or at least just old enough to be non electrical.
---
Holy fuck, the prices!
---
Coffee Break
---
Its not that big of deal. Inconvenience yes. Issue no
---
I actually sell it for free. I dropped it in bags before. Now it goes to someone who needs it. To shoot or horde. Whatever. I'm melee.
---
they changed SBQ tagging because people would shoot her once then go hide till its over. You have to do a certain % of the total damage done. This % seems to be based on the number of people participating.
---
GIRL?! WHERE?!?!
---
Another day older and deeper in debt...
---
Answered my question :)
---
Nice I still have to move some special points and perk cards to maximize damage output
---
Ahh, didn't realize you were melee. I think it definitely works better as ranged, but I'm pretty sure is still probably the most OP armor affix in the game, even after the nerf.
---
I bought a level 5 explosive hunting rifle for 2.5k, great for my alt.
---
Haha thanks, beside the Delorean I have the Penguin duck from Batman Returns, and below it I have the interceptor from Mad max. Near it I have facehugger eggs from Aliens, and beside that I have a Xwing model lol
---
Last 20 or so were all weapons.  Handmades, a few shottys, a mix of others.
---
All level 20 or less.  I need to stop farming the campfire event :P
---
It’s weird. I kept asking myself why I was being attacked. They did minimal damage though (compared to when they’re standing). I moved and saw the sleeping body follow. It was fun to watch.
---
I stopped at a camp in white springs to check out what they had for sale, and a Scorchbeast showed up.   I ducked for cover to assess my weapon situation and started to try and take care of it.    A few moments later, the camp despawned  lol.  I ended up killing it out of spite, since I saw a few items for sale I probably would have bought, had it stayed put.   Ah well.
---
So is it going to be like a random slot machine for the item?
---
&gt; If I hit the queen I'm not sitting behind the barricades drinking nuka.
---
Zone in, shoot once, hide and have a drink till it is over. It was very very ver goddamn VERY common till they fixed it. two people trying to kill her, 10 leeches in the fucking bunker playing cards.
---
I have a whole bunch in my vending machine, if you dont find one within a few hours (when i get off work) and you're on pc hit me up
---
Thx bruh..i already have full set bolstering ..I think I'm gonna add at least 2 unyielding
---
Currently have two
---
It's ridiculous. I'm hoping to find one in a level 50s vending machine who doesn't want it cause it's too heavy haha
---
I'd like to know this too because I just tried that quest after it popped while I was at Watoga station and "the centrifuge is powered down" but then "the DNA has been loaded into the centrifuge" but it still won't give me the option in the terminal to examine the DNA. I see that it lists student hours for the lab being from 6:00 to 20:00 but I didn't feel like waiting around to see if the time made a difference.
---
I've been kicked out of a dozen casinos over the last decade so I fully understand how the math works on these things.
---
My gripe is that with a video poker machine you can see if the machine has a 96% payout or a 99% payout by looking at the listed odds. Bethesda doesn't list the odds and it's deceptive.
---
yep.
---
Same, I like to drop food, water, chems. If I drop weapons or armors I ask them on mic first. If they don't answer I move on to another.
---
Magazines. I collect them
---
I'm currently at work.  If I see somebody say the dude's in game I'm leaving for the day lol.
---
 It's good to be the boss.
---
Thats actually pretty cheap imo. Ive send auctions for exploding lvl 1 pipes go for up to 25k. They're extremely helpful for leveling up new characters
---
I'm always on the lookout for Ballistic Fiber! Haven't found any yet though :(
---
Had this happen last night. Weird.
---
I'm level 128 and I still haven't bothered killing the SBQ because I know the reward isn't worth it. I probably never will until they do something out this.
---
It's the attack of the crawling dead. Gotta watch those sneaky shufflers.
---
No you buy random legendariess based on type and stars
---
I have multiple exploding weapons for sale. None of which are even near 10k. 2 of them are pipe and they are under 500
---
Nice set up!  I’m also looking for a typewriter for my display.  Most I’ve found are priced waaay above the cap limit for me
---
No maintenance. Purveyor should go live in ~15min or less.
---
Try out the search function.
---
Oh god yes! We never realized we had it so good.   
---
The days before Bethesda had the deluded idea it would build 'community' by getting people to work together to complete quests, without understanding we'd just do the quests and never speak again. Or just not do the quests because we didn't want to impose on a stranger.
---
Dew it!
---
Yeah but what new player has 25k?
---
Get that DCG money while you can. I have a feeling the prices are going to bottom out on them in a few weeks when the goddest of god rolls is a guaranteed giveaway. Especially if Bethesda doesn't fix the bug where survival rewards can be earned in adventure mode.
---
Why are there so many people that are still pretending caps aren't an insanely easy to obtain, hyper inflated currency? A run through harpers ferry collecting all the weapons can net you over a thousand caps for five minutes of "work".
---
I sold some earlier today.  :(
---
It's not just scorched. Random ghouls do it as well at WS
---
If you’re reporting a bug or exploit, expect a response between 24-48 hours. Tickets in regards to bans or suspensions will probably take longer to process. I do not recommend submitting multiple tickets— this appears to reset the response time back to the beginning. Bethesda‘s policy might be geared toward responding to all of your concerns at the same time.
---
Stimpaks, disease Cures, antibiotics, plans I haven't learnt, ammo I need
---
And in the rare, RARE chance I see a weapon or armor I like, haven't seen one yet, then I will snag those too.
---
It's really great! But I've always had the sporadic and dodgy shooter playstyle complimented by cavalier. But even then I don't wanna run it because the +special is nice. 
---
If you get so lucky to have 5 +Special armor pieces it could effectively nullify half a piece of unyielding armor and make a bolstering mix even better... Hmmm.. Thanks for making me think this thought with idle conversation c: 
---
Have an iPhone
---
Yeah found that out in a post on here.  Fucking bullshit
---
I only lock my extractor, it's the only thing I covet since I built my CAMP on it for a reason.   Everything else is open for public use and I don't understand why anyone would lock their doors and water.
---
5.56, .45, fusion cores, canned dog food, screws and springs. That's about it.
---
And some windows you can jump through without any tricks. Like it should have glass in it and even if not, the wood between the panes should keep you out but no. You can just jump right in.
---
O yeah agreed I would love for them to share that, more so because they used FO4 as the base and the RNG is only thing it seems they worked on before they copied and pasted this game together lol
---
remember picking up those at flatwoods nursery, if that helps.
---
Not sure if you guys played destiny but she will probably be like Xur. She will have stuff but it won’t be good lol
---
Wait like vitamin b pills? Where do you find those?  is the vitamin B in a red bull enough?
---
We'll they don't have to be new players. The people bidding are probably familiar with the game and have other characters with caps and are looking to make a new build
---
That would actually give me a reason to do Biv’s daily😂 I need that Nuka-Dark recipe👌🏼
---
The tax, though. AND IT’S BROKEN.
---
Do different charred ghouls have different health? I've definitely been one-shotting level 68 charred ghouls, as a level 46 player, but maybe I'm doing more damage than I expect:
---
Suppressed penetrating hunting rifle - base damage on inspect is 105. I have the 2.5x sneak damage and I think 1 each of rifleman, expert rifelman, and master rifleman.
---
If I get a clean headshot it's a one-shot. Otherwise, in sneak, it's 2 body/limb shots. Out of sneak it's like..... 8+ shots, lol, and I normally just switch to my extra claw deathclaw gauntlet.
---
Because I'm a hot mess and my build is for QOL, fun, 1-hand melee and sneak assassin.
---
That's were I got mine from worth every cap
---
Or at least, Serendipity, Lone Wanderer, and Dodgy.
---
If you run low health, flat damage reduction is what you need.  Serendipity is a chance to outright avoid damage.  Lone Wanderer is a significant across-the-board 30% reduction.  Dodgy reduces at the cost of AP.
---
There's also Suppressor, which acts like a localized, per-enemy version of Sent/Cav armor.
---
Southeast of Whitespring. Across the road, up the hill. You'll know it's the right one when you see a pickup and a bunch of radioactive waste barrels and you're getting your brains fire-hydranted in.
---
Head from Whitespring toward Solomon's Pond. It's not there, it's the pond downhill and closer to Whitespring.
---
In my experience he's Legendary about 1/4 of the time, but only if he spawned that way. So server hop a couple times and you should get to meet Legendary Dave.
---
True. But i still think its way over priced though.
---
I'm opening a bethesda ticket RE: Torture.
---
Yeah I noticed I could jump through my windows on my brick walls. They seem to be the only ones so far, there could be more though.
---
I've had that mutation for a long time and it has never mitigated the negative aspect.  It has to be unintended and I agree it shouldn't be that hard to correct.  I'm not sure if it's serum related or Class Freak perk related.  I'm sure it is something with the perk because Class freak also doesn't reduce the negative aspect of the grounded mutation either.  I'm not an Energy Weapons user so it doesn't matter to me, but I'm sure it has been very annoying for others.
---
I’ve picked up two god roll rifles so far, spending 10k on one and 1500 on an even better one. Keep looking!
---
Now this is charity I can get behind. Some food and water, maybe a couple of stims. It’s people who unload legendary weapons and a bag full of 15 plans on new players that screw up the game balance. Let them struggle a bit, the game is far more enjoyable that way.
---
IT'S MA'AM!!!
---
for me its definitely plans thats what i sell and buy the most once you rech a higher level you get heaps of duplicate plans and i dont want to throw them away so i sell them for 15 or 20 caps usually  which isnt much more than a little convenience i wasnt very successfull on selling weapons even though i more than once bought interesting weaponry and compared to other vendors my prices seem pretty comparable thats just my experience 
---
my guess is that probably the best stuff to sell is rare plans outfits and serums if you price them reasonable
---
i know I've posted these before but cmon just look at these challenges from last year ! !

There are certain formulas in the program that affect the drop rates, for instance; Weapon type may have a 5% drop chance on Combat SG &amp; 3% chance on Grognak's Axe, or something like that, tables are different for each region and Enemy type, so they can make changes that affect the drop rates of certain Weapons or Armor pretty easily, but using any player specific algorithm would be both extremely complex and resource intensive, not to mention down right unfair.
---
Yes. This right here!
---
It's in a totally frequented area.  People are just lazy and/or forgetful and/or don't want to pick a lock.  I would never spend over 50 caps for piece of clothing, not armor, clothing in this game.  You can goggle where they are.  Thats how I found the tin foil hat.  Y'all are crazy to do that
---
I'm reminded of Dave the Barbarian for whatever reason.  Thanks! :D
---
I totally get this. I want to like... build more than one base soon, but I'm all about functionality over form. Like, I build boxes with stations lining the walls and hook it up to power.
---
How does Explosive harpoon gun fitted for flechettes fare?
---
Ran Whitesprings last night not a single legendary enemy.  Ran it again and got a ton of 1 star drops from snakey boys aka ghouls that are too lazy to stand and lumber like they are supposed to.
---
I’ve collected a handful of magazines... whistle me up sometime and see which editions might be of interest.
---
I noticed this as well, always thought it was because I had the healing factor mutation.
---
My vendor character is Danzig so maybe he's kept alive by some infernal contract with the devil or something lol.
---
Oh no. I build metal walls around my own bed., locked that’s the house itself is unlocked.
---
I once loaded into the game at the exact moment a nuke hit. I was still looking at the loading screens when it hit. I was insta killed and there were no icons on the map to respawn at. Talk about timing.
---
When I could see the in game world all I saw what soandsos nuke killed you...hehehe
---
There are certain situations and weapons where +10% dmg is arguably the most powerful 2nd slot affix, but this is rare playstyle and hence not in great demand.
---
Oh yeah, definitely over priced. Inflation has really gone up over the months. I think its just because its a pipe pistol, i dont see many of those things duped very often
---
I disagree.
---
I have found that opening a ticket for every single bug/glitch/exploit in a short period of time (less than two working hours is good if you can manage it) *really* gets their attention.
---
If you get past 40 you might even get a manager wanting to have a conversation with you.
---
I’ve got about 3k .45 ammo in my machine. Please buy it! 1c each, and I wish I could sell for cheaper.
---
That is where I got it actually.  Just keep the faith.
---
Damn. I've resorted to buying from robo-vendors out of desperation. Need a good supply for my apparently-very-fragile pocketed raider chest piece (need that +15 carry weight to satisfy my hoarder-side)
---
Ah yes my bad, my apologies to mama.
---
Make sure you're standing at a COMPLETE stop and give it 1-2 seconds. The camera doesn't register items  when you're moving, and sometimes will refuse to even take a picture at all if you've been moving or recently stopped.
---
I bought 80 of them for 5 caps each 2 nights ago
---
My vendor character has some mutations but healing factor isn't one of them.
---
I have a switch. Bad thing is people don't turn it back off after using it
---
oh fuuuuuuuck that's tight.  
---
Yeah, he eats souls.  my bad.
---
There's no maybe about it, danzig is definitely fueled by the dark Lord.
---
Is that where it’s supposed to be? I hear music too.
---
Where did you even hear about "Squirrel" Rank?
---
also adding the need to pee would be good too
---
My shower is at the top of the stairs leading to the vending/crafting area, because I don't want new/low-level players to have to search everywhere to find it. Since some builds rely on low health, I do have a switch attached, but does the placement of the shower make me uncreative, etc? Some of us put a lot of work into our CAMPs, and this sort of bums me out, tbh.
---
I forgot about the meth lab he had in the back!
---
If someone’s willing to pay, then it’s not crazy. I err on the bargain side when I sell, but to each their own.
---
[Photo taken peaking inside](https://imgur.com/gallery/9AT27Ye)
---
What did you pay for the 5 56 and  45 rounds I have mine at 2 caps each and can't sell them
---
Well, the nerf just means you can't be on autopilot.  In practice, in PvE, it's not a big deal.  If anything, it made things a bit more fun by being slightly random.
---
It can't be two shot and anti armor, just FYI.
---
The relationship between the sneak perks and AGI is a mystery to me. I run all the sneak perks AND AGI in the high 20s. I'm invisible, and can combat knife kill every individual enemy, when there is a group I sometimes loose stealth. I'm going to test dropping the sneak period, fingers crossed.
---
A toaster weapon... You are on to something here. There should be more exotic weapons in the game.
---
Armor, weapon, and camp plans that won't break my minuscule bank. I have power armor to fall back on in battle but my wife and cousin seem to be against the idea of getting their own. As the resident ~~mad scientist~~ happy crafter, it's my job to keep them outfitted and light armor isn't really cutting it any longer.
---
I suspect there is a reason behind the current methodology since you can not spawn directly to the inside of any area on the map, but it would be nice, and eliminate the problem of spawning into a blast zone after logging out or being DC'd while in the Resort.
---
I ran a mule vendor for a long tine..never fed him or let him drink. Also made him wear a clown suit. But when they get super low hp..they will die from sneezing too hard. It doesnt take much. I think a low level scorched blew me a kiss and he just keeled over.
---
Junk jet?
---
very.
---
Give it a try for yourself but I hated Dodgy because I was always out of action points. It especially sucks against scorch beasts because I don't take and noticeable damage from their sonic attacks with dense/fireproof but it still drains AP. Blocker and Serendipity are much better, imo.
---
You can literally look at it in the camp building option lol. Look at the pioneer scout flags &amp; you’ll see a third Squirrel option. Been there since release of Ever Upwards but literally no talk about it, I just assumed I’d figure it out
---
This guy
---
&gt; If the person leaves and their camp disappears **while you are in that particular area** you run the risk of the glitch
---
So you are less at risk if you go nowhere near your camp site when it can't be placed?
---
Am I the only person who thinks rare should mean rare? You shouldn’t get the best of everything, every time you kill a legendary.  It’s the luck of the dice, it’s a post apocalypse world. As a filthy casual player, I’ve gotten a few decent items, mostly junk from legendaries but I had two three star legendaries come during a defend the ammo Depot event. If I see that many legendary bad guys, then they need to drop mostly junk and once in awhile that beautiful gem.
---
My vendor sells toilet paper for 100 caps per roll
---
Mama mole forgives child
---
I put in free ammo. Price it at 0. I dropped a bunch of ammo regularly on my melee character anyway cause I don't use it and it clutters up my inventory. So now, it's gonna have a good home.
---
I buy 5.56 at 1 cap each from machines and players. .45 at 1 cap each from machine and 0.5 caps each from players.
---
From what I gathered in the Bethesda post on the official website, yes it's supposed to be inside the abandoned Berkley Springs Station.
---
Yea that's me and the purveyor throwing some shapes, I locked the door though so I can have first pick of the sweet, sweet legendaries
---
Gunpowder, acid, disease cures, treasure maps, nuke cards, chems, plans and recipes
---
That 'papapap' sound makes the hairs stand on the back of my neck when I'm in survival mode
---
Yeah I'm almost certain I've been the target of several molerat assassinations lol.  Doesn't take much at all to kill your starving, thirsty character.
---
This. Or close doors.
---
You keep that up I’m gonna join your game in my police &amp; give you a citation for peeping sir!
---
This is what I don't understand. This only makes sense if the queen is the only thing you're fighting. There's lots of other ads running around during that fight. If you kill them you're helping the dpsers focus on that and it should count.
---
i think the prices work pretty well honestly every once in a while you stumble across someone who charges those 10-20 k items but more often than that i found that player vending made good deals available we shouldnt forget that a really big part of the playerbase is regular gamers who just arent invested enough to go on reddit or read forums and shit they dont bother which weapon is worth how much and they see jo need to make the ultimate profit out of every weapon just because "there are people who are willing to pay that price" most users see the machines as a convenience to earn some easy caps for fast travel if you arent looking out for 3* godrolls you can have a lot of fun selling good weapons for cheap
---
thats why such trades as op stated are luckily not the norm imo
---
Not in game yet
---
&gt; I've been taking pictures and videos since Day One of glitches and stuff. 
---
How interesting.
---
I dont know anyone that would pay that, but i guess so
---
I bought a 3 star exploding pipe gun level 10 for 250 caps I can't wait till my alt gets to a level 10
---
I can’t find the station.  Im at Berkley Springs
---
Ridiculous to me that Bethesda are adding challenges that are impossble. Stimpack diffuser??? Nice one! What a waste of time. 
---
That's let alone from others that are completely bugged out. I mean. People say bugs are getting ironed out now? But new bugs are ALWAYS introduced with every single new patch. Its borderline incompetence at this point. Look at the melee issues from the most recent patch for an example.
---
Thats about what my exploding pipes go for
---
I'm a bit surprised you could stay connected that long. I rarely last more than an hour or 2 but I'm never staying in the same place.
---
Yeah thats actually a good deal.  I would have bought it
---
Ok well that’s dumb.
---
likely at the far end of the queue with all the other dupers
---
Probably another hour still.
---
&gt; Maybe try deleting your Fallout 76 save file?
---
How are you going to manage to break into the Amazon server farm to do this?
---
&gt;Level of the player that owns them
---
Doesn't matter a lot of players sell from thier mules
---
Just look for the end of the train tracks on the map. It's southeast(ish) of the map icon.
---
Oh I'd better go hide the rest of my photo collection now. LOL
---
Good way to keep shitty things from happening. Lol
---
Me neither. If they want it clogging up their machine until they find a buyer, that’s up to them.
---
Careful talking about inflation players don't like that type of language.
---
I haven't seen ANY and I have seen a lot. Like I had six different quad harpoon guns at one point. I got quad cryo, quad tesla, quad plasma, quad railway rifle, lots of different quads. Not a single sight, ever, in hundreds of hours trading.
---
Huh. Hadn't been back to my CAMP since the Ever Upwards update.
---
I'm betting it'll be like the Sheepsquatch or Taxidermy content that's slowly trickled out, instead of all released at once.
---
agreed! it would be a great QOl improvement
---
Easy enough, I would just add  sub categories under both weapon and armor saying legendary, the number of stars and the number of..
---
I've visited more than a few camps that have random weapon that are pretty much scrap to anyone level 30/40/50 plus.
---
LOL, I actually was just peeping as well👀 I can see her stand I’m assuming she’ll be in this stand thing at least
---
I got nothing last night but a few stimpacks, some stable flux and a plan. :'(
---
Lol well i dont need caps THAT bad.
---
Patiently waiting at its intended location !
---
I used to have my camp at the power plant that powers the munition plant. It was a great combo to power the reactors and fire up the munition plant.
---
I love to do this!  I'll drop some purified water, stims, ammo I may have picked up (I'm a melee character so it isn't usually much), and either a treated marine wetsuit or protected BOS underarmor, and a few plans.  Just a little something to help them get started.  I love that so many others do this as well!
---
There have been a number of glaring bungles in the atomic shop but this is the most damning in my opinion.  Doesn't take a masters in marketing to figure out if the haircuts are available for both sexes you will sell twice as many without the buyers remorse you are experiencing.
---
Technically marsupial gives +20 carry weight
---
I have found about five. Make sure they say deluxe
---
This right here is the correct answer.
---
I ate one yesterday. It made my brain rock hard.
---
I have noticed the distinct increase in triple and double level 80 scorchbeast attacks on my base and when I take over the ammo Depot.  One day I had back to back SB attacks during the defend events. 
---
Oh and to the a-holes who attack someone who is defending their resources and kills with a single shot, f-you! I should be able to auto destruct everything as a last laugh.
---
It’s a spiny drive, I’ll have to update it ASAP. I was using a portable drive anyway. Didn’t realize the actual difference till now. On my desktop i though it was the 64gigs of ram that did it not just the SSD
---
Yeah I got like one piece of each of 4-5 different colors last night.
---
Im totally rolling only 3* armor and mostly 2* guns. The weapons value is mostly defined by two first perks. Third may be an awesome addition, but if the baseline sucks, its worthless.
---
I was trying to find to find a good valley/hole in the mountain range near the monorail elevator but just settled for a cliffside view of whitesprings near a small pond.
---
Thanks, im there with no way in either
---
The event rewards you flux when you complete it.
---
Is there a wall attatched to the floor you're trying to delete?
---
AND I'M AT WORK SELLING DOG FOOD
---
It look fucking hilarious when they come gliding at you lol
---
Guess I am cutting my prices
---
I also find the opposite of this as well, I bought a quad explosive 15% vats handmade for 1,500 caps the other night. Good deals are out there.
---
It's to purify post-war America!
---
I don't mind the alcohol challenges, I find them enjoyable gathering the ingredients and crafting stuff that can give me a buff.
---
I HATE the daily picture challenges because they are really really stupid. Stupidly easy for playing with friends, impossible playing by yourself. Whats the point in that? And there is always 2 of them.
---
I had to move out of that area because of the constant scorchbeast attacks. That was before they fixed them though.
---
There's also [the drum barrel](https://i.imgur.com/CeqckSs.jpg). A lot of players miss it, but if you go to the frat house, you can play the barrel like the steel drums. It doesn't look like an instrument, but you can totally use it, and it syncs up with unique music of the other two instruments.
---
Get three people playing all three instruments in the frat house and it has this really weird, but totally awesome beat. They have their own music track.
---
I currently have some for sale at my C.A.M.P. (on PC)
---
Who am I to disagree?
---
One hour, it is timed with new atom shop content, not daily challenges.
---
Which vault is this?
---
Blocker, nerd rage and serendipity perks help considerably with defense.
---
I think the Pro comes with a stock HDD, so replacing that with a solid state drive could boost your loading times significantly. I'd recommend looking into that.
---
Serendipity is one of my 100% "always on" perks. It's not just for fights, it mitigates **all** types of damage. I still like telling the story of how I accidentally fell off a monorail tower at 19% health, and Serendipity saved me 100%.
---
Yup a lot better odds than scoring a good roll from an enemy
---
Get three people playing all three instruments in the frat house and it has this really weird, but totally awesome beat. They have their own  music track.
---
Grounded mutation would be nice.  All I ever see is marsupial.
---
Canned dog food??
---
Yea, maybe too easy...I can understand them wanting them more challenging, but there is much better ways to do that, which doesn't rely on playing with others or constantly server hopping.
---
I'll usually wake up to some kind of "disconnect blah blah" message but today I woke up, turned on the television and saw my character was still spinning around in a circle after over 5 hours.
---
The same thing happened to me. Sometimes the only way to fix it is to move your camp.
---
Not directly to that piece, but there are walls a little further away, on pieces of floor that this one is attached to.
---
Cheap Mr. Fuzzy tokens 😀
---
Ah but is it canned? Lmao
---
Sneak all the way. Along with nerd rage and a few others. Captainoob build.
---
Confirmed.  I just climbed back up there.  Ugh. i was hoping i'd never have to come back here lol.  Tanagra town has the correct consumable type.
---
It's unfortunate that you can't bulk ammo for sale, b/c 3000 rounds of .45 ammo for 3000 caps is just too expensive (at least IMO)
---
Just be aware, there are players actively searching for afk player very dors and nuking their base while they are afk.... After buying their good shit if course. 😄
---
It looks like a ton of other folks took off work today as well. Loads of higher level folks stopping by to see if it is open yet.
---
As I said, I don't see any Maintenance scheduled. I gained that bit of info by using the search function dontchathink?
---
Was just thinking of this..
---
I'm no game designer but maybe something under weapons and armor of all the possible levels listed and star ratings (1,2,3) all listed under whatever item they pertain to.
---
Brilliant
---
Agreed
---
Is the floor in question a foundation or an upper level?
---
I'll give you 2 caps per can of dog food
---
7/11 vendors... regular items and way overpriced... spacesuits 1500caps, lvl 35 50cal 2500, mole miner gauntlet 1000caps... Metal Bed Plans / Chem Bench 500 and the rare Ivory Grip plan for only 1000...lol 
---
Not kidding, this was yesterday...
---
I'm going to take a drink to this post.
---
Unrelated but, do I have to download an update today for Murmph?
---
They reduced restriction for placing but forgot to reduce restrictions for removing. You can place a floating piece if it’s attached but can’t remove it. Either leave it til it’s patched or rebuild your entire camp ;(
---
What platform? I usually have it at my shop, I think right now I'm selling for 2 - 5 caps each, I forget.
---
Helpful tip: track all the badges you are working on. When a photo checks off one of the requirements you get a notification.  Makes it easier than having to go 4 menus deep to see if it accepted the photo.
---
Molerat assassinations... those fuckers are sneaky bastards.
---
I think that stops working when you are starving.
---
I have healing factor and when I'm starving, no more healing until I reduce hunger and thirst.
---
[And a hot plate!](https://youtu.be/IhmFCX9Bq3k)
---
How are house budgets actually calculated?  I'd say I have a very dense base with 3 heavy machine gun turrets and spotlights.  I'm still only 80%.  My last base placement was recently at level 207.  Not sure if that's a factor.
---
Lol enjoy your stimpack diffusers
---
Flux
---
That wouldn't flood anything, most 1-2* are useless.. regardless of number of *'s, almost all of it is going in legendary vendor anyways.
---
I would say that at least 80% of all drops are junk and get junked.. if there were more 3* I would say that things would be more affordable. That's all.
---
You can't "flood" more than dupers did, and all that did was make prices more reasonable and the better weapons more accessible. If they never could have duped it's safe to say that 75% less people would have two shot explosive anything.
---
It's better the market get flooded by legit gameplay than dupers, and I doubt it would even saturate things that much.
---
Already looking for recommendations on Reddit
---
Ahh, got it. I guess I never paid much attention to that.
---
It's a glitch.Its not being recognized as completed by anyone.Hopefully Bethesda fixes it soon.
---
Add a legendary category please. And thank you
---
Not directly, there are walls attached to a different piece of floor some floor boards away from this one
---
Absolutely love nerd rage, just the 20% maintainence is the worst. 
---
But if need rage could always be pumping I could drop a 3* Slugger perk for 3* Blocker.
---
Valseek on the Bethesda forums said it's another couple of hours yet.

Can we also please get some more bald options or A bald option?
---
Currently all you can get is a buzz cut not bald.
---
Maybe a bald option with several variants like scars, dirt and burns since we dont have hair to blend the facial versions of these into?
---
Maybe I'm being selfish but it would really bring my wasteland mad scientist look together if we could lol
---
They weren't interested in being useful, only in getting loot for themselves with minimal cost or effort.
---
I think I actually stopped by your base last night on PC, looks awesome!
---
In my almost 900 hours, I've never gotten a drill. Not saying I want one, just questioning how common this is..
---
Exactly
---
If I have the ammo. My vampires lmg is op against boss enemies, heals me faster than stimpacks and does huge damage with perks maxed out
---
I wonder if they'll be queueing up? 😆
---
Thanks so much! Glad I asked :-)
---
How much are you willing to pay for magazines? I'm just curious because I have 2 usless ones for me but I was thinking about selling low to players. I don't want to just give it away but I dont want to gouge either.
---
I got a quad / vats crit/ reduced vats cost radium rifle . I need the powerful automatic receiver. With that fire rate I am pretty sure it will be a monster in pvp. I can't find any vendor selling that mod . I really don't want to scrap anymore of them . The cost to craft them is stupid high.
---
The floor is attached to a stairwell that is attached to foundation.
---
Usually sold as a mix of vitamin B6, B9 and magnesium.
---
Don't really fancy a red bull 1st thing in the morning -- rather wait 'till I get to work for a coffee for that caffeine.
---
In my case the stuff stays in the machine.
---
I'm a bloodied, melee build and with my Fire axe I do major damage to the Queen. When it I'd on the ground. My problem is with gamers that stand on a roof shooting at her or when she is on the ground people are throwing grenades at her and she jumps back into the sky.
---
 Here's a tip. Stop the grenades and orbital strikes. They don't do enough damage and stay off the roof. I can honestly say that the only time I have failed a queen is because of roof dwellers and too many grenade throwers.
---
 Second, and think about this. Where did she come from? A nuclear fissure goof balls. A fat man does nothing to her. It's almost lime she says yum yum to the nukes.😂😅👍
---
Ok, I'll probably get downvoted to oblivion,  but this just hasn't been my experience of late. Did the queen 5-6 times in last week, not once did we fail to kill her. 
---
The only real glitchy thing she did was dive into the ground and fly under us for a pass, then she popped back up, turned around and made another strafing run. 
---
Loot could be better, out of those fights I got 2 3*, 1 2* and a few 1*...
---
I buy all toilet paper to leave 8n front of vendors with shit prices..... Or on their bed in their locked base (there's usually a way or 2 in 😜).
---
I have not found a decent harpoon gun to try, but I think it will do well. I should go out with a normal one and see if it is useful. If so, then the legendaries should be stellar.
---
I imagine in any case it would be amazing for clearing the mobs around the queen. Since getting your harpoons back from the queen won't happen till its over, so you need to bring lots.
---
also v power armour as per older games
---
I'm sure before they release 4 and 5* items, they are gonna have it fully patched for dupers. Pretty much will reset the market.
---
I've not done it but a friend told me it took everything out of his vendor and he had to reset it all.
---
Yes there are intelligence bobbleheads. I came across one today or yesterday as it happens.
---
Where is the Purveyor gonna be located at? Anyone know?
---
Yeah, from all the reports I don't bother.  Nothing like breaking all your armor, weapons and draining all your ammo for nothing.
---
Those clipboards tho
---
Items stay in stash, must be repriced tho
---
Moved yesterday, stuff stayed in the vendors
---
Huh?  I haven't noticed an item being sold taking up double space.  Are you sure about that?
---
Damn, I'm on ps4 :(
---
I’d like to just see a legendary category with 1, 2, and 3 stars.
---
Thing is this could be exploited too.  Throw some junk legendaries on for 25k just to get visitors.
---
This really amounts to people wanting to visit a store, but not wanting to pay out the ass for travel costs.  So here’s a solution:  a second level to travel agent perk, “you pay an addition 30% less for traveling to play vendors”
---
Perhaps even make it 3 levels and cap at 60% fast travel reduction and 90% camp reduction.  I can see why Bethesda doesn’t want fast travel to be free.
---
For me personally I only hit shops in savage divide/mire/bog.  Maybe TV if there are two close together.  I never go to forest camps and I’m pretty sure nobody builds in the ash heap (dead serious I can count on one hand ash heap  shops I’ve seen)
---
Interesting, I guess it may depend on how much they automate their system and how many humans they have working the tickets (not that I would know any of those details, to be honest.) 
---
Brb, writing up 120 bug reports so maybe I can finally get on their Christmas list.
---
All the listings will be gone. Redeploying the vendors won't resume them.
---
But at least when your camp can't deploy because of collision, then the stuff get resumed when it can.
---
I would be all over that! I'm on PS4 - what about you?
---
4 caps each!
---
Awesome, yeah although it’ll probably be more tedious challenges but hopefully the outfit looks different from the other 2, even if it’s just a color scheme difference not dark brown again lol.
---
i think survival should be reset and require fresh characters that are bound to survival..
---
that said.. players should be able to join adventure under the condition that they cant return to survival...
---
i doubt duping will ever be eliminated entirely...
---
That my build. Heavy gunner with Instigating Plasma Gatling, AA .50 and AA Gatling. Perk cards are  Stabilized (maxed out) Fire proof (maxed out) Bullet Shield (maxed out) Bloody Mess (maxed out) and all three Heavy Gunner at 2 stars with reactive plates on the PA. I just stand still and spray hate at the big cancer flappy. The lower players tend to keep the rif raf off me most of the time so I usually park it in the middle of her flight path and spray her down until it land then move in closer and focus on a back leg to keep her grounded.
---
Those mole miners really know how to party!
---
Correct. I meant AAE, but the brain and fingers are not cooperating today.
---
You were correct, but I had to move locations because the placement glitch continued despite me building there for months before. 
---
And then I went to another great spot, got about half way done with building a new camp and then my CAMP thing disappeared when I tried placing an object over it and now I can't enter build mode at all.
---
Lucky!!
---
It sounds like this is a bug and i cannot help you. Like another person here said, your best bet is to either rebuild you camp completely or hope they fix it in a patch.
---
Cool
---
Not really, I've sold a few dozen in my vending machine since it launched. I don't even use the perk that lets me know when bobbleheads are nearby and still usually find a few a day. Very easy to find 900 in a month or two if you swing by bobblehead spawns regularly
---
I got that one early on, but it stated giving me the same 2-3 over and over so I quit doing them.  I want the Red Ant Lager.
---
I had a setup where my shower was in front of my vending machine and hooked up to a pressure plate that would activate whenever someone walked up to the shop. I took that shit down when I realized I'd accidentally built a trap that would rid careless players of their mutations.
---
A minor addition to this bug report: 
---
When you mod the Ultracite Gatling laser with the beam focuser, it's laser color reverts back to red instead of greenish yellow.
---
I agree.  Having said that, I’ve killed her a total of 4 times in maybe six tries and got two 3 star drops.  The second to last one was an epic Vampire’s explosive 50 cal.
---
Let us tag a featured item
---
It really does sound like a party is going on in there. I just wanna know what the warning klaxons are for! Is the party THAT amazing?
---
Even tried replacing my CAMP like 4 times, costing me like 600 caps, and still can't build. Lmao guess this character has corrupted data or something
---
I bet! that rate of fire and Vampire would be incredible regeneration.
---
I too cannot find a way in.
---
No patch. It will be just enabld on server.
---
Purified water is 0.05 weight and inert flux is 0.2 weight. I don't recall the water % of each unit, but I think purified water is better there, too.
---
Either way, I find myself always having and using inert flux.
---
I hope so
---
I second this
---
I keep hearing a train whistle
---
I'd pay for it!
---
Oooh great suggestion! This would be good for the seller and the buyer for sure.

---
Right?? I’m sitting with another dude on the bench to the left
---
Someone needs more fiber in his diet.
---
Me too! Feel free to add me and swing by, I'll see what I have. I might only have 20 or so in the machine but probably have more I can spare. PSN: Skizzunky
---
Have good weapons that do higher damage (400+), or if you use heavy weapons you have to use the perk stabilized, otherwise you don't do enough damage to get past her armor. Anti armor is probably best over all, probably with explosive.
---
She used to have 300 armor, but they've rebalanced her since they nerfed two shot and explosive, so not sure what she's at now- the more anti armor effects you have the more damage you'll do to her overall though.
---
The issue with failing has to do with players under level 75 that have bad builds- you're not going to have a great build at 75 unless you were extremely careful as you leveled. Most players aren't fully effective until level 115+ to be honest.
---
If you're below level 50 you increase get difficulty without contributing enough damage - this is probably the leading cause of failed events, too many low levels show up and not enough high damage players to make up for it.
---
I'd be honored if someone were to spend their nuke on my shop. I'd even add a tally of # of times nuked :)
---
I too shag carpets
---
did I read it backwards? Damn.
---
Either way, flux is far easier to get in bulk.
---
I have moved twice, once I had to break down the blueprint of my house and that made the inventory disappear from my vending machines. The second time I was able to lay the blueprint of my house down, and I noticed all of my stuff had stayed in the vendor priced up. I think if the vending machines go into your stored as single items then they put everything that was for sale back into your stash.
---
Wow, would love this! I think eventually after a load of content updates we’ll  get a big cosmetic update (so they can keep siphoning money from the atom shop) but also so we can get a lot of requested items for base building down to the tee.
---

Build your camp next to a fissure site, then people know you're serious
---
If other games can prevent duplication why can't fallout76? I'd be ok with a reset of survival mode and agree with you
---
We’re shooting explosive weapons at the door now... things are gonna get messy
---
I'm leaving work at noon, it's like Christmas. I just hope you can buy more than 1 of each item she has
---
This has to be one of the top inspirational speeches I have read to date.  Now if you would excuse me, I have to take a shit.
---
I thought survival would be cool if everyone had to create a new character, even the playing field and weapons would have to be found or created on that server... nope... 
---
That provided 0 interest to even try it...
---
They said you can join it like an event, i guess that means the inside isnt going to be instanced?
---
Yes. Yes they are.
---
I remember trying to collect all the clipboards I could when I first started. Now I just charge Yao Guis with my Vampire Combat Shotgun. 5-8 springs per kill, got like 30 bulk spring now lol
---
So Arktos will be a new event? Not instanced? Am I understanding that correctly?
---
Yeah the only male long hairystyle worn down, has an awful widows peak hairline. 
---
I thought the afro or ethnic styles look really terrible, not to mention that your forehead clips through most of the female ones lol.
---
Berkeley Springs Station...so that deaf and lazy little molerat will finally open the door!
---
But takes intelligence which reduces shop sell price and raises buy price. But you don't lose the perk cards under intelligence. It only affects the gameplay outside of perks.
---
He was just using an example.
---
I'm still trying to get my girlfriend to get on board with a shipping container house in real life! But yes, I agree with this, it would look super cool.
---
My hypothesis is that guy that is here in nearly every post telling everyone how much 76 sucks also has a downvote botnet working.
---
Yep. I hit up Silo Alpha and the mountainside bed and breakfast. You'll always find yao gui at each one, and for late game, they're also a great source of acid, too.
---
Yeah, me too!
---
Lmao what? Thats charisma man, intelligence doesnt affect that lmaooo
---
Thank you Bethesda, very cool!
---
I'm familiar with Super Duper, but how does it work with the crappy stuff you get?
---
That’s how I read it as well
---
Wait you can do it in adventure mode again this week? Holy moly BSG really trying to spoil us, huh?
---
system?
---
The Burrows arrived an hour after daily change, maybe this is gonna be similar
---
Gt MatanzaCueto. No mic as well.
---
&gt;1\* Wooden Armor and 2\* raider armor
---
So, you're ok with that worthless shit being dropped from the main end boss of the game?
---
When I saw the Dustbug Billboards still on sale for another \~40 minutes I figured the day hasn't changed over yet.
---
Orbital strike.
---
Hydrate with some beers to pass the time.
---
I cant collect acid anymore, I've got too much of it in bulk. I usually sell my excess to the vendors for caps. But I like to server hop Middle Mountain Cabins for the Honey Beasts and Yao Guis. 
---
Fuck those Radscorpions though.
---
HAHAHAHAHAHAHA I literally was in game chat with these guys saying “watch BSG will 100% delay it for hours while we stand here like idiots” boy do I know my fav company like a book😂 welp, I’ll go off for breakfast or something then. Disappointment ensues 😓
---
Ik i was she would hurry up. I got scrip to spend
---
Duping is wrong. I agree. However, do you really think that all these TSE weapons that EVERYONE has weren’t duped?  Most were. Sure, some were real drops. Most were not.  Was the game ruined?  Nope. We all have them. From all the uproar lately I’d expect to see everyone using explosive lasers and what not but I have yet to see one being used.  Bottom line is duping is wrong. It should not occur. The game is great and will survive this. We just have to move forward.
---
Downvoted into the shadow realm.
---
Thinking about nuking the train station
---
Apparently yeah
---
Since datamining from weeks ago, I've been under the belief that this would be an event, so, yes, I would rightfully assume that means other players can join at any given time. I really don't think we'll get anything that is instanced until we get the vault raids, but even that might not work, because I thought I read somewhere that they are having difficulty with the tech for that. Hopefully someone will correct me if I'm wrong on that and misremembering.
---
Honestly it's just a waste of time. I get prime receivers and tbh they're trash. Great I have a receiver that's impratical to kill something for another impratical receiver. 
---
I love this game but sometimes it just feels so vain.
---
Thanks for the report on this, we're aware and actively looking into this issue.
---
Berkeley Springs train station, not an actual marker but we’re all assuming she’ll be here but it’s been delayed by potential hours look at the comment above
---
Well let's the 4 of us do it. Everyone hit me up in game
---
I think ammo sales are very subjective based on the player. 
---
That being said, ammo is low weight, you could have hundreds of rounds for sale and only take up a small amount of stash space (in the realm of a few pounds).
---
So, rounds like 5.56, .308, Shotgun Shells are kind of a pain in the ass to make - so some players might opt for the convenience of buying in bulk (for some players, a few hundred caps isn't much). Versus 10mm rounds you craft 100 at a time, easier and cheaper to just make them yourself. 
---
I haven't opened  a shop yet, but when I do, I'll have some rounds for sale. Even if they sit for a few days, doesn't really take up much stash.
---
Berkeley Springs train station.
---
I just built a big 2 storey barn with no windows. I want maximum wall and floor space for decorations.
---
Plans mostly
---
I would love to add more to my arsenal IF I HAD MORE STASH SPACE.
---
Christ ok. But for real, they should stop setting times/dates for anything they release... half the time is changes anyway
---
Dang, you could be right but this is usually daily reset time about now so I assumed we’d get her along with it
---
Sorry I meant for the event reward.
---
I believe you’ll be right!
---
They never specified a time she would be out tho
---
nah, the "original" Thanos just wanted to bang a hot goth chick. none of this altruistic nonsense you millennials want to credit him with ;)
---
People in NV had braids after 200 years of going tribal. Nobody had those haircuts pre war in any of the games as far as I'm aware. Might be wrong but whateverrrrrr.
---
Fasnacht also didn't start until like 2 or 3pm EST.

If they add more challenges which I assume they would be harder since possum was harder than tadpole that they better have some worth while value for these badges in backpack upgrades. Like double armor plated or armor plated with 120 carry  or carry weight of 250 with loss in dr/er and not just anything like this:
---
Squirrel Uniform -1 Squirrel Badge. 
---
Squirrel Shorts - 1 Squirrel Badge
---
Squirrel Hat - 3 Squirrel Badges 
---
Squirrel Banner - 1 Squirrel Badge
---
I will be so disappointed if this is the majority of it.
---
Makes sense. I imagine if they could do instancing, then they would have done it for the queen.
---
Reminder, current SM is beta.
---
IIRC what they've said re vault raids was that they're working on instancing for them because the original implementation of waiting your turn proved to feel really bad, not that they were having issues with instancing.
---
ahhh i'm ps4.  sorry bud
---
When the Camden daily stopped all my dailies stopped. Then one day I was walking from "Relay Tower DP-B5-21" next to Uncanny Caverns to Lewisberg when the Camden daily triggered again then all my dailies came back. Hope that works for  you.
---
You’re right, they just kinda idk.. release everything around the reset time.. but go off sir!
---
Yeah you have a max of 150 from the legendary destroyer even now, but we’ve been able to build up a stock of scrip over the past few days.
---
I haven't played with it enough to form a solid theory, but I'm pretty certain that I've gotten the out of  space message when I'm trying to list items that are already stashed.
---
I was playing with vendors last night, but I had sold a few heavy weapons and my stash weight wasn't topped off, so I didn't learn anything.  It might be just when the stash is completely full that it won't work, but it needs a bit more testing to figure out.
---
I really only use it in PvP anymore, in place of white knight.
---
Hahaha that’ll show her to not open those damn doors!
---
They never set a time though, just a date.
---
That's why I freeze Sheepsquatch with my quad cryolator.
---
It’s a way of life
---
I like the idea of possible Legendary SBs, but not all should drop legendaries. On both my chars, I can drop 2-3 SBs at a time without breaking a sweat in a minute or two, so i feel that might be a bit of a stretch for all legendaries perhaps.
---
Praise this godly soul.
---
Sounds good, and not oversold like the burrows.
---
What I want from future inside the vault?  Look at this reddit and the suggestions you see non-stop (such as perk card loadouts).  I’d like to see the top 3 community suggestions of the week addressed by Bethesda.  Such as “we like that, we’re actually working on it” or “it’s a great idea but doesn’t fit our vision of the game now”.  In other words, communicate with the community.
---

---
With flechettes you can shoot any corpse on the ground and get back 2-6 harpoons per shot. It's basically infinite ammo.
---
I blueprinted the pieces I want, and I guess i'll rebuild that part from the blueprint.
---
I bought some explosive lasers recently that were likely duped. But I'm a collector. I don't use energy weapons lol  Honestly, every duped item will become worthless if they add another tier of weapon levels.
---
In same time which is used to change atomic shop limited items.
---
I do and it's pretty good with stealthboy and jetpack torsos on fav wheel.
---
And I think all of this was said during that recent crowd event a few weeks back, wasn't it? Can't even remember what that event was that facilited all of them sitting down again. I'll look for the stream.

Bullets, typical weapons / armor, cheep junk i.e. anything i'm short of be it aluminium, ballistic fiber, screws.   
---
Other then that usually cheep stuff i can get a decent mark up on.
---
Also if it was a free travel spot that would be awesome as well.
---
Believe it or not, just got killed by a molerat.
---
Berkley Springs station. Unmarket location currently.
---
I forgot about that... scared the shit out of me the first time I went near Olivia in FO4.
---
muh feelings: the post
---
people like you baffle me. op gear is fine- so long people spend thousands of hours farming for it, because that's how long it takes with such an astronomically low rng.
---
what about people without the time, money or who simply can't roll anything good? F them, right? not to mention pvpers. they have to dedicate months before they're competitive. and most pvpers don't wanna do that, that's why they're pvpers and not ghoul slayers.
---
not to mention, patching duping? for good? Bethesda can't even into server sync, that's why items keep vanishing from our inventory. even before the recent events, sellers were still getting their stock *somewhere*. where do you think that is?
---
That's where I'm at, i have a few pretty decent two handed and a couple one handed. Never had any luck with guns, except for a tse gatling laser which is a hot mess.
---
I will note that😂😂
---
I hope we can get enough people to +karma this post, I demand reasonable challenges not bs ones where it takes half a day of planning. Talking about you take pic of Grahm at a workshop or take a pic while naked of a naked player in nuked zone.
---
Right, the resource intensive explains the "new server issues" but as for the unfair again all RNG is "bias to the house" so that is the reason they can say "they would be changing the drop rates of the Cryolator and the Gatling to reflect the rate of other weapons. They are using the tables but like Tomgato said... we don't even know the starting valves so changing them means nothing... more so if they are backing it with the seeming Luck of the toon and what you have gotten before, bottom line is Big B is doing something, yet again not telling us the what or the how, and some people will love it and some will hate it so we can only voice what and where we fall on that and see what happens lol
---
I agree it's to stop constant jumping around with vats.
---
If they deem your "ticket" isn't a problem they just don't respond. I found I had submitted one and after thee days hadn't received a response, then I realized I was doing something wrong on my own and "fixed" my own issue. Another issue I submitted was responded to in 24 (ish) hours. So... MAYBE your issues aren't really issues. Try making posts about them here on reddit and see if the community can help you.
---
Doh totally forgot about the Burrows!
---
It has been happening to me at WS since they implemented the exchange machines. Also I don't know if this has already been stated anywhere else but I have been losing legendary drops. I killed a ghoul at WS by the frogs and as soon as i saw instigating hardened hunting rifle the bodies disappeared.
---
new ammo type with next update...ohhh, sorry - those are metric drill bits...
---
Based on my experience with other large subs, nobody would read the stickied post anyway. "But I just want the conversation" ...
---
I hear you knockin' but you can't come in.
---
Ok, I get it now. This also explains why I'm seeing these active vendors in survival too where they don't worry too much about being destroyed.
---
RARE
---
You should all have a contest, throw knives and tomahawks at the door.
---
Yeah they said they had to make an entire new instancing system just for the Vaults during the FO76 panel at PAX East.
---
Pawn to King's Deathclaw!
---
Go to the Golf Club like everyone else.
---
Why they didn't make everybody start a new character for survival is beyond stupid to me.  Any character that plays on adventure should never be allowed to enter survival.  I started a new character on survival and I am being killed mostly by people with TSE weapons it seems.  Its not fucking survival if you enter at level 100+ with all your duped gear or duped gear you got for cheap.  Does everybody who has a TSE duped?  No. I bet a majority of them were though.  I would have zero problems starting another character from level 1 if they implemented this.
---
Shoot. Mixed em up, lol. Same thing though, you lose the extra bonuses outside the perk system not the perks themselves.
---
I would love this as well, my current brick set would change immediately. (would fix my interior wall issues as well)
---
Indeed, iv sold many a workshop plan, even stuff i figured everyone would have i.e. bathtubs, milk machines etc.  
---
I stick them all in for 100caps and iv sold almost every one from 50+ (even tinkers workbenches).
---
I don't know why the just don't make wood have 3 stars, everyone (read as me) would be happy then.
---
This, at least, I think they did on purpose. A silo run is supposed to be the hardest thing in the game, originally.
---
This has been a problem for so long :/. I was hoping it would be fixed ages ago. A way to prevent it is to avoid using the analog sticks until you are completely off of the bench, weird, but it works.
---
There are two different items. One is just a "token" that you find out in the world, then there's something else like a claim token that you get from the quest
---
Not to be confused with mr fuzzy tokens
---
*Places vending machine facing off the edge of a cliff*
---
Wait what do the tokens do? I always thought they were trash.
---
you can also use it to find corpses in tall grass
---
Hit the exit button and don't touch the movement/look inputs.  that seems to help me. Yet I always forget and end up having to exit at least twice or three times.
---

---
I've been trying to find a good Nuka-Cola bottle for my collection for awhile now, you'd think it wouldn't be so hard. I remember awhile back Oxhorn had an awesome one he said he bought in one of his videos....but he never said who made it for him :(
---
Yup. Mowing into that Sheeosquatch yesterday. Horrible electronic farting noise as my plasma Gatling goes haywire then....(burp) Xbox home screen.
---
At this point we all should take protest signs and start a riot in front of the station
---
I think it comes from button mashing. I have to hit the "exit button" and then virtually drop my controller.
---
Well thats still unfair
---
i mean it is convenient i am willing to pay some 50-100 bucks to even if i dont know i need the plans just because its not a lot of money
---
I did not know you could shoot corpses and it worked. Damn!
---
and then they'd have used the recent method to dupe weapons rolled on survival. and we're back to square one.
---
just don't play on survival until your build is done. it's common sense.
---
It's been an issue since the end of the beta. Its when you press the stick while exiting it interrupts and puts you back in. Just exit and wait to hit anything until the backing away animation stops.
---
One of the things that REALLY F'IKNG ANNOYS ME about FO 76 is what I perceive to be the INADEQUACY of the weapons.
---
And I'm a Level 50, so no noob here.
---
I've experienced this all through the game, and off all the annoying things, this ranks right up there in the top 2 or 3.
---
In fact, I find many of the weapons ENTIRELY WORTHLESS; others, like the Gauss Rifle, which was my absolute, positive GO TO WEAPON in 3, Vegas, and 4, and just worked GREAT, seem not to work right in 76.  I shoot at people and robots, even in VATS, and the shots seem to go right by them.
---
I know how to sight a weapon.  Still, its possible that I'm firing to the sides - but with VATS?
---
Shouldn't be happening.
---
Shots go to the right the left - I've even seen shots impact BEHIND THE TARGET (this is the same for the grenade launcher and the missiles too, BTW), which implies that they passed right through the target.
---
Anybody with any "insights" on that?
---
Anybody experiencing that?
---
I just discovered that today when I was looking for a Legendary Super Mutant that I had lost!
---
wait so this dungeon is also not instanced? did i read that right?
---
Where is that?
---
I run a bloodied commando and use full bolstering + dodgy. The only time I do down is if I’m being sloppy and let myself get swarmed, or the aim down sites function decides to stick when I need to pop a stimpack.
---
Spawning outside the build area is the best solution for now, won't take 5 seconds to reach the camp and almost guarantees you don't get stuck, all they need to do is make sure you spawn on the right side of a cliff.
---
Probably because the game is a part single player and part multiplayer, so they wanted to have challenges that cater to both sides of the game.
---
The problem is we had daily savings time change a month or two ago, and every game I play handled it differently. The daily reset for tier skips in bo4 is at 1pm my time, this game resets at 10am my time.
---
Killed me dead the first time for sure.
---
about 1:00 PM  you pick the time zone
---
The fair way to make the more desired weapons harder to attain would be to add more weapons to the list. Even if it's a bunch of re-skins of other weapons.
---
A list of 200 weapons showing a .05% chance of dropping a Handmade is transparent and honest. A list of 45 weapons with a .05% chance of dropping a Handmade is misleadingly dishonest.
---
I'm not a fan of government regulations but if we can't trust in these gaming companies to police themselves and be transparent........ maybe it's time for government oversight?
---
Im looking for people to play the game with.  Tired of Solo.  Add me please.  PSN Powwhackbang.  I would message you on my ps4 but im at work right now.  Interested mostly in survival.  Only level 28 or so.
---
I wouldn't consider it a dungeon.
---
Id like to know if I will be spawning into a foundation piece
---
Berkeley Springs Station. It’s north west of thunder mountain substation TM - 01. You can find it at the end of the railroad line.
---
It was funny I recently moved camp and didn't place a single thing and 1/5 of my budget was listed in white for items placed despite me not putting anything down. Fixed it by moving 3rd time, ps I don't recommend it due to insane cost for it in caps.
---
Yeah if I'm running my shop I stay as far away from it as possible and usually stay sort of stealthy and away from people. Not ideal, but it works until Bethesda makes some changes
---
Junk. Saw 500 gunpowder for 1c. Brought it all. Later saw bulked cloth for 5c. Bulk has 30 units. That was so cheap, brought as much as  could use for a while. Which isn't a lot, but still, no one even sells it for 1c.
---
And all kinds of plans. Even camp plans that I don't really use. It's nice to gradually have them learned all. Found some good plans too, like deep pocketed armor. Funny how at level 190 I still didn't have them all. 
---
I've sold a lot of small things. Little junk, stims, dog food. I like it every time someone comes and my stash goes from 800 to 780.
---
Don't laugh, my Instigating, swing Speed, reduced weight Candy Cane deals some serious damage.
---
Legendary Drills for everyone!
---
Cool, but I'm waiting to see how people read things into this that aren't going to be there.
---
For example, 'new loot'.  People will immediately jump to 'cool new items we haven't seen before.  That isn't necessarily what that means (though it could be).
---
'Even veteran adventurers will find it beneficial to form a group before taking on this event' doesn't mean you can't do it alone if you have all tricked out gear.  It just means it will be easier with more people.  Or, it could mean you'll be slaughtered if you go in alone.  No way to tell for sure.
---
Please, try not to read too much into these things.  If we've learned nothing else from this game, it's that we need to be careful parsing Bethesda's statements.
---
i just see a lot of fanboys who downvote everyone who has a critique on the game, like my previous comment show
---
Yep. The cliff issue hadn’t occurred to me but they’d definitely need to account for that.
---
Both servers I’ve been on had someone else already at that station, starring at the door. One guy managed to get trapped inside, but no purveyor
---
Whens the update?
---
Anybody else sell Toilet Paper, soap, and toothpaste in their vending machines or is that just me?
---
Forget about springs. TP is the most valuable junk item in the wasteland
---
PAX East is what the event was.
---
The last camp I saw that had one positioned like that, had all of this cringeworthy writing on the walls and the vendors had fashnacht masks for 3000 caps a piece. 
---
Nothing an orbital strike couldn't remedy...
---
I agree completely
---
You really need the cap collector perk :D
---
Nice picture.
---
well yeah, I use a PA heavy weapons build, legendary armor is useless for me, I could get more use of an Assasin Switchblade tbh.
---
Take a snapshot with your phone or a screenshot to refer to. It’s annoying but it’s how the challenges have always worked.
---
I'm with you, haven't finished my coffee yet, probably have 20 mistakes I've made since I got up.. have a good day!
---
That's (part of) my question.  Sorry I wasn't clear.
---
at least yours wasn't gonna hurt much. Mine was a level 70ish yao gui. an i was running low on ammo anyway...
---
thank god that thing realised it's own mortality about a minute later
---
Isn't survival still beta? I didn't think it's a fully functional flagship game mode yet, to have those expectations of Bethesda is a little reaching.
---
Not sure why you would get down voted for personal experience lol.
---
I stopped playing for a few months, came back just over a week ago, had 4 fights with the SBQ and failed every one of them.
---
My characters are by no means weak but the events i join always seem to be full of people not up to the task.
---
lol pretty sure there is a 20% chance to get badges and even regular events don't always give out the plans. Why don't you grind out the Tadpole and Possum world challenges. Those are guaranteed a badges. I already have both the high capacity AND the refrigeration mods. Play the game it was meant to be played and it will work great for you. 
---
Different challenge. **In** the savage divide is photomode. _Creatures in_ the savage divide is camera.
---
My reading of the second part there was that being alone might make it difficult to complete all of the objectives, as they might be spread between the three caverns in the lab.
---
I actually know this one! This bug is 100% repeatable if you exit the crafting station while pressing movement in any direction (usually the back button for me, at least on PC). I can repeat this without question, infinitely. If I don't press any movement direction when exiting crafting it exits properly 100% of the time. Hit the back button right as I exit out? I enter the crafting station again.
---
The Lode Bearing tokens can be exchanged for a package of stuff after the quest, from the nearby terminal.  Mostly ore, if I recall correctly, but I think the higher level packages have low-level legendaries in them.
---
Each item type uses a certain percentage of a 100% budget.  Some item types have limits of how many can be constructed, such as a limit of four vending machines regardless how of much budget you have left.  I think it's a little odd as a way to do budgets.
---
The worsttt
---
Thank you so much!!! An actual answer.  :)
---
Forgot to mention if and when they fixed duping.  That is not common sense or a fix lol.
---
The Burrows pretty please.
---
Yup
---
Im calling his MOOOOOOOTHER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
---
Except rain comes through the roof unless you can find a green military one. I know of one really good red one near Charleston station, is this where you build?
---
Indeed if i see any plan &gt;= 100 i don't own its an instant buy just out of convenience. 
---
Ofc ill pay much more for a plan im actually interested in which i cba to hunt down.
---
Ahh thanks
---
Or just a tent that keeps out the rain properly lol.
---
Well they at first didn't give much info at all in the patch notes, so ill give them that are seeming to try to do better with time, but agreed, that could work but they have done so many broken things I'd rather see those fixed and go with even more OF the let us know what they are doing, Before they do it lol
---
They weren't fun, they were mindless free atoms. Many of the newer challenges are tedious, but the camera ones can be entertaining if you have someone to do them with. I think people are just upset that the challenges are now actual time investments (with some occasional bs like the radstorm and early camera ones thrown in).
---
If it can't be placed and it has 2 options, "Stay on this world" or "Find a new world", then people are in that spot, most likely. Or your character could be corrupt, I don't know.
---
I just googled it... It's a furious +SS sword
---
A few places on FB is saying it might be but it might be just because they don't actually know yet. Like me. :o
---
Yeah you can pick what type of item but then it’s pretty much random
---
This guy gets it.
---
Not unless your a Democrat
---
That's not good. I had one incident where I couldn't move my floors and had to relocate to fix the issue. Bethesda support just copied and pasted info on how to move a camp. Needless to say I was pissed off about it. That was last year BTW near Christmas time.
---
Hopefully things get better over time.
---
Well somebody has good taste!
---
I bet we can buy the same option over and over
---
I get this in practically every 3* weapon O find and I can confirm that........no.......it can't be viable.
---
As I recall, if you have an item in your STASH and want to put it up for sale, you actually remove it from the STASH and redeposit it while at the vendor machine and it then prompts for cost for sale.  So I don't think there's a doubling of use in STASH.
---
FB is fake news
---
Try the community Fallout Market!
---
I think it is only worthwhile with guns that have bayonets
---
Measuring demand or perceived caps value is difficult. It depends on the day. All you really have to base anything on is rarity. Anything that you can only get as a rare reward from an event (tattered field jacket, leather coat, white springs jumpsuit etc.) will be the most rare. Then you have the rare in game spawns like clean clothing or anything from the rare responder bot sitting in the middle. And basic clothing you can find anywhere is obviously the least rare.
---
In general, basic clothing is worthless and rare event reward clothing is the only thing really worth trading. Obviously there’s exceptions to this. Some of the rare clothing you can find laying around is worth a lot (asylum uniforms), and the Hunter long coat and winter jacket and jeans from the responder bot are worth a bit. And you’ll probably have more trouble selling some event rewards than others... but in general those are the three categories.
---
There’s a spreadsheet of all the challenges with checkboxes that you can check off. Just print it out. Anyone that is still going through the menu each time is purposefully making it harder.
---
Get a group together. Protest. Take a picture and tweet it at the Fallout / Beth acct
---
I wouldn't try to sell that as a fact, but that was my impression as well, or something along those lines.  Then again, I always hate depending on other players for the success of my missions, that almost always ends badly :P
---
would be nice if any tracked challenge was shown under a "tracked" category
---
Well I meant in terms of max budget.  Even before they brought the budget costs down, I was constantly able to build bigger bases as I moved spots and gained levels.  In fact, every rebuild I can add more and more stuff.
---
Depends...i'll do what is needed to survive. Mostly i stick to myself. No PA
---
That's why I joined reddit.... xD
---
I just move on when I run into those. I can usually tell by the first machine if the camp is going to be worth my time. I might start carrying around spoiled meat and leave a bag of them if I don’t like the prices. I’ll rate them from 1-5 spoiled meat.
---
TBF? Nothing about anything is fair :) But seriously, the Atomic store resets vary, Daily Challenges reset at 11:00 AM EST, Biv and other daily events reset at 8:00 PM EST. The Purveyor isn't tied to anything...
---
That explains things.
---
Either way is fine for me I can't get on until later, I'm just glad she'll be out today.
---
It is not viable unless you are level 1-20. It's so underpowered and you can punch harder than it in most cases.
---
Lol, I honestly wouldn’t mind a bloodied, SS +1 strength drill🤑 or AA
---
My pal Kashani made that one. Printed up the label, made it look old etc.
---
Well, Sanctuary is right next to a river, so there is that.  😃
---
My 1* bloodied handmade is so OP, and it one shots most things, 2-3 for a SB. The only thing is that I get downed in one shot sometimes.
---
I do this to. Just crouch in a corner somewhere, and have your character walk into it. It avoids the idle disconnect, and people can't see you on the map.
---
I believe your available budget also goes up as you level up.  So you also get more as you level, but it's not well documented on how much.
---
Same. :(
---
Oh you poor thing, I have some bad news for you...
---
(honestly though, nothing is worse than FB for getting things right)
---
i think it wouldn't be so bad if at least the queen and sheepsquatch imposter (and any other 'end game' monsters) would drop at least a 3\* item. Even if it was junk, would be nice to see that it's definitely 3\*.
---
I could make a small, dark forest with all of the nocturnal wooden armor i have gotten from the queen.
---
Lmao farts ruining stealth would be the funniest shit ever.
---
I apologise if it sounds like I was stating that as fact. Was simply an opinion I gathered from reading, but I'm in the same boat as you in that I hate depending on others too. And, when you do depend on them, they go AFK and make you do all the work anyway. Not always true, but it definitely does happen 😂
---
Lol it is dude
---
Its a little reaching to make people play survival with a fresh character?   I disagree.  Its a little reaching to expect them to fix duping methods when they are found?  I disagree.
---
Reasonably priced flux.
---
It feels that way, but seems to only take effect based on what level you placed it at.  Not your current active level.
---
!!! Never thought about this. Yeah BO4 is usually a really strict set time though, BSG gets pretty loose with their release dates lmao. Can’t forget we were supposed to have vending machines at the end of April lmao
---
The good thing about the fight is that she scales in difficulty based on the amount of players there. However this event is still not solo able.
---
I soooooolllllldd my soul at the Purveyor's store.
---
"wait a minute...there's only rolling pins and drills on the floor...I thought they removed drills from her table!  GET HER!"
---
Wait is it out now?
---
I had a crowned ghoul spawn as a 3* legendary last night and I'm thinking.......this should be a good one right?.......it says in the game that crowned enemies drop better loot?
---
Nope......
---
A 1* Assassin's leather chest piece.
---
3 stars would be nice, but i'd be thrilled to just get a piece that wasn't wood for a change :(
---
I found 2 out of my 4 Death claw hides from the containers near Big Al's tattoo shop (Biv's place). One was in big green dumpster (the building closest to shop) and one in the metal box just outside the door. One I bought from a player and one was in a lunchbox.
---
But visitors must be... C L E A N S E D of their... *impurities*
---
Thank you for your service dude, you posted on my post as well at least BSG has said SOMETHING (most people don’t even know those forums exist tho lol)
---
Would love to try playing sometime. If we were both on same team we could each move pieces
---
Nah, Xbox. I'd kill for crossplay
---
Perhaps a "fast travel mat" built into the build area circle that has to be placed on the ground in order to place your CAMP?

I had one last night. Too bad, I usually just insert them immediately to save the 1lb carry weight.
---
Seens like a place that we can control what spawn in it? If Yes will be a nice place to farm things that drops from mobs
---
&gt;Not sure why you would get down voted for personal experience lol.
---
Well, yeah, folks seem to think if that's not their experience then you must be lying and a shill! 😂
---
Anyway, I will admit to checking a serve,  before I do a silo run, to see if enough high level types are on map. That of course doesn't guarantee a good turn out for the bitch queen, but it at least gives a better shot. If the levels of players are too low I sever hop until I see some decent numbers
---
They give her more HP and they don't have the DPS to negate it, therefore making it even more unfair for the people that launched the nuke and the high level players that show up wanting to farm her loot pool (which used to include serum recipes).
---
With no perks and attachments it's viable for trash mobs at least
---
Related unrelated tip. Don't enter the main doors. Walk to the right, down the steps, into the small double doors. That puts you right in the middle of the row of shops downstairs.
---
Don't do that, that thing is worth the 25000 caps
---
Destruction: 100
---
No it is already loaded, on a timer to release.
---
About this [     ] big
---
I've had a few tse drop to me, got a lvl 10 BE 10mm dropped aswel. my wife got her first dropped at lvl 50, but a very high amount of weapons and armors have been duped and when someone can buy the best set on the game for there build at a cheap price from dupers it devalues everyone thats farmed those pieces. You couldn't even buy a BE handmade on redit for caps. Items like that was trade only. now you can get one for 15k. If  we want to play in a game where everyone can easily achieve end game gear with no or little effort then what is the point? Might as well play call of duty.  It absolutely has changed the PvP aspect of the game in an unfair way. The PVE aspect is not as much affected. I hope the game will survive I pray it does. Look how far it has come already
---
I learned to not touch movement joistick when leaving and it is ok for me.
---
I've been spending more and more time at the Bethesda forums... so much less nonsense. And the CM's are more active on them as well.
---
thanks for the reply, sadly none of my friends have any useful talents :)
---
Damn. I know she spawns beneath the moth man statue in Point Pleasant. I've found her there a ton of times
---
Are you suggesting we used IRRADIATED water to wash off radiation particulate with our decon showers? :P
---
That's why I joined reddit for videogame related things and sources I can trust a little more. :o oh wow
---
Well I know the fasnacht parade Ihad to log out and log back in for it to appear
---
My wife was absolutely incensed when I told her they called the tuba a wind instrument. It’s brass, dammit!
---
That's not what a delay is
---
Ah I'm to lazy for silo runs these days haha i just jump servers scaving through player vendors and jump to SBQ if its on.
---
I plan to drop a bottle of vodka before I purchase anything from Baba Yaga.
---
Everytime a vault dweller is born the gods flip a coin
---
Yes it is, I watched my friend solo her in 19 minutes. Not the best time but it was done. 
---
With the same friend we also took her down together. There was one level 35 leech this time as well
---
Well I know who's CAMP I'm robbing
---
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
---
Another thing is the owner can place a chair in reach of where you get stuck and you can sit down to get out. It doesn't work in power armor though.
---
Would also make it more accessible in a nuked whitesprings
---
I tried using bashing liberally, but it breaks your gun super quick.
---
Whoa
---
Dang that was spot on.
---
That explains the music, thanks! I guess the alarm klaxons are the Mole Miners drilling up from wherever they come from?
---
I did not pay much attention to the sights on the gun. I took some time to check one of the wikis that gets their info from the game files. I do see a -15% AP costs on reflex sights. I will need to redo my tests. Thanks for the insight.
---
" **Flatwoods Home of the Green Monster** "  is on the sign as you enter the town.
---
Brother I’m on the same struggle bus as you for ultracite .308 I say okay I’m going to farm for fluorescent flux now and really build up my ammo reserve. After I run through the nuke silo, slide in my keycard and punch my code in I start hearing these whispers. “Drop over here!” I brush them off as I try to pick my spot with the most flux and then I hear some more. “Nuke the Queen, you want to.” I snap myself out of it because I want the ammo and again just as I’m about to confirm my great flux farming spot I hear “You could get that 3* drop you always wanted” I drop it on the fissure prime!! As I’m fast traveling over to forward station I say to myself I could get some fluorescent flux here and plus I could get up to 3 from completing the Queen this could be good. 1500 ultracite 308 later the Queen is dead. I don’t get any new plans, I get an Assassins Wood leg and a 2* mutant slayers robot arm no fluorescent from killing her and I only find 12 unstable flux I need and no high radiation fluids. You got me again Todd, you got me again.
---
I have/had 2 in my vending machine
---
Bethesda needs to just come out and admit that the legendary slot machine is the content of the game.
---
Granted.
---
Bug: everyone now spawns INSIDE a vending machine :').
---
So there not considering it a dungeon anymore...kinda disappointed by that oh well
---
thank you
---
i am about to launch right now.
---
Not only do they not understand pluralization, it's in the wrong freaking category! UGH! LITERALLY UNPLAYABLE!
---
So I guess that one is possible but way more  difficult than most
---
You can play, just can't do anything involving your camp. Stash boxes still have your stuff and workbenches can access it too; only thing you really can't do is adopt pets.
---
Well, gotta take into consideration that the prefix percentages are probably not even odds (since they tweaked the drop rate of a couple of weapons a patch or two ago, this is pretty likely).  Also, the weapon you get is random too.  I'm going to be pretty grumpy when I get a B25 fatman or pipe pistol, I'll tell you that.
---
Ohhhh myyyyyyy Lanta....
---
No I’m in the Mire just a little south of Harpers Ferry. 
---
I didn’t know about the green car thing, nice to know!
---
1.) Perk up: With the right cards in play your weapons, armor, aid and junk can weigh a ton less and you can carry a ton more and when you die you never lose guns or armor.
---
2.) A common tertiary attribute of 3\* armor are additional weight reduction perks that stack with your card perks. Combined with Deep Pockets and +1 STR you can be a human pack mule.
---
3.) Get your scout on and do those tadpole activities and get your dang backpack. A bog standard level 50 backpack increases your carry weight by 60 and enough possum badges will make it 120, albeit with penalties.
---
4.) Sell, scrap, vend or drop anything you don't need. Marie Kondo the hell out of that stash. If it doesn't bring you joy, toss it. And with the legendary scrip chipper you're basically out of excuses.
---
Stop bitching about the Stash space and BE the stash space.
---
There not even calling it a dungeon anymore....
---
I LOVE seeing other ppl's bases. Player vending might be cool for a lot of ppl but for me, the big thing is being able to find and jump to bases to look at their creative homes. Some might be tragic disasters in the sky from the outside but even with those they can have some great interior decorating and designs.
---
Some of my favorites so far have been from ppl that have made elaborate bar &amp; grill restaurants, hideaway coves in the rocky mountains, bunkers under bridges, cabins along the lakeside, cottage homes that rebuild broken highway bridges in their front yard. It's so fun to see! Makes me yearn so much more for actual reclamation and rebuilding content updates, building up towns and refurbishing the existing infrastructure in the game permanently as events and stuff.
---
I’m not buying - the fellow who posted above me is collecting.
---
I think it's a known bug. I've seen this mentioned several times. Those posts say completely closing and restarting the game will place you in a new server.
---
This is where I got it 👍
---
I bought a Seagate Game Drive SSD (Xbox1) and definitely noticed faster load speeds, both when fast traveling and when starting games from Home screen. 
---
Some website that did some testing SSD v internal and it cuts 10-25% load times depending on the game. 
---
It is a no brainer if you have the funds.
---
What's the problem?
---
Travelled the world and the Glowing Sea...
---
 
---
I want people to see that I'm at my shop
---
Also noticed that some turrets are missing. The wires are still floating in the air. Can’t move or repair the turrets.
---
Yup,   
---
As a note "Crowned" enemies are considered boss enemies which yeah, supposedly give better rolls (But from what I have personally seen they drop more weapons/chems/aid), yet to really see it lead to a good drop as a result which is really annoying. It's even more annoying when it comes to events you grind out to get shit on with a 1\*
---
Actually, you could have entered from outside. I'm currently doing this mission, and I entered block D from outside.
---
My junk extractor did that but my water purifiers were fine. A few days before though I had someone picklock the door to my generator (came back to camp to find it open). So I think he unlocked that door, and probably pick locked my extractor too. And that’s why it was unlocked and couldn’t be locked again until I stored it and rebuilt it.
---
No, radiation and mutants must be purged. The wasteland must be cleansed.
---
They're in an event on this game
---
Yeah I won’t pay above 1 cap each for those,  I wish you could bulk ammo into boxes and sell them for less.  I’ve seen some people charging 5 caps a piece, or more, for ammo and they are out of their heads thinking anyone will pay that.
---
Yes, yes, yes! a thousand times yes!
---
While the loading times are as long as they currently are it would be a HUGE QOL improvement.
---
ps. Loading times are ridiculous which also needs to be fixed. I'm not sure if moving to an ssd would help (probably) but even so - sometimes I'm waiting for 2-3 mins to load in and that's just silly.
---
I definitely am trying to run away already when I press the exit button.  Thanks I'll try and keep my over eager fingers off the joystick when I exit. After seeing this I'm certain it will make a difference
---
I’m rather upset fatmans deal a bit more damage than a drag grenade... didn’t they do up to 600 damage on one of the prior games?
---
How many cups?
---
They are probably motivated by your single-minded characterisation of them. And possibly vice versa. Who knows? It's all a game.
---
You could easily make a bunch of Easter Eggs in two colors for a quick game of checkers, too! Add a Party Hat if one gets “kinged”
---
You think I don't know how to play the game dude, I have 390 carry weight and still don't use backpacks. Quit using Reddit to build confidence bud. We get it. MY POINT WAS WITH VENDING WE NEED MORE.
---
Perk doesn't work for booze crafting.
---
Everybody is looking for yangzee
---
I lost a complete set of 1 &amp; 2 \* BOS Combat armor. :'(
---
I wonder why though?
---
I can agree with that, three star items guaranteed from three star legendary creatures.  Just let the super awesome ones be rare. 
---
I’ve got a legendary log cabin hotel out there somewhere from all of my legendary wooden armor.
---
I have them for sale, occasionally, at my vendor shop. IGN pokerplayr (PC).
---
If you're nuke looked something like \[this\]([https://i.imgur.com/DOapQG1.png](https://i.imgur.com/DOapQG1.png)) than it was probably me and mine.  
---
We do it every day.  
---
You're welcome!
---
The sign is in the real life Flatwoods. I guess Bethesda doesn't think green is spooky enough.
---
Or vend items from your machine!
---
I'm over 700 hours and I don't have the grenade or mine plans. I didn't spend too much time exploring the Forest and Ash Heap, admittedly. I see the same rotation of plans in the vicinity of my camp in the Divide, once in a blue moon a plan spawns that doesn't belong in that rotation. I'm hoping I stumble on it one day, but I skipped over that particular challenge/badge and don't need it anymore, thankfully!
---
Well they have to fix that shit. One picklocks your stuff and everybody else can take whatever they want without getting wanted.
---
Looks awesome but knowing the camp mechanics is it playable with another person?
---
Worst excuse for indecent exposure ever. “Officer, my clothes just vanished! Honest!”
---
Scrap desktop fans.  I'll give you about 100 if you are on ps4.
---
This is... concerning. Sorry that it happened to you.
---
I have myself reached a point in the game where I have a handful of things that would be tricky to replace and we are a long way away still from private servers and console access.
---
On a more constructive note this is mentioned in the 'official' known-issue thread as 'being looked into', I'd suggest you 'make yourself known' to them.
---
Office type buildings are the best place to find screws.  Desk fans and typewriters give one each.  If you're playing for longish stints at a time, I recommend taking a workshop with a junk pile or two (early game my favorite is the junkyard just east of Vault 76) and collecting from that every so often. I also put my CAMP on a junk pile just to get screws more often.
---
I gasped when I found the holotape with Amazon speaking on it ... lots of pieces fell into place for me that night 😀. I’m such a nerd for this stuff ☢️
---
ah ok, more like the burrows then, gotcha!
---
People who downvote anything and everything are meaningless.
---
IT'S MA'AM!!!!! *throws over shop display and yells at a woman with kids*. 
---
Welcome to the clown world kiddies HONK HONK
---
If you look on the map the purveyor will be at the exact spot the train tracks end on the map just below Berkley Springs.
---
I have a level 6 with a stash box full of max level legendary gear. I just moved it to that character using a friend and use it as a merchant.
---
I've never had any items vanish from my inventory. But I don't dupe items so maybe that is why. Some developers make games with high RNG for player like you that don't wanna grind for their gear, that like everything handed to them or that don't have time or money. Those players should look for those style games. It's obvious that this game has a low RNG ment for players like me that want to grind for gear that have time to put in the hours that want to feel a sense of accomplishment for the work they put into it. People like you baffle me if you don't like grindy style games with low RNG then don't play them.
---
No thats not it. I would honestly like to know how buying from a vendor cause servers to crash and lag. Because that was the last dupe. They use duping as an escape goat for their out of date game engine. And anyone who believes the problem is duping is just blind
---
No idea. Only found one person selling a bunch at 100 a piece
---
I have a level 40 bloodied gatling. It's my one marginally useful ranged weapon. A duper gifted me a TSE handmade but I sold it to a vendor after the nerf. Much more interesting to "earn" things honestly, imho.
---
Some of them want to nuke you...
---
"7. The Vault 87 mutants are still causing terror in the Capital Wasteland...continue to cause problems for another 175-185 years."
---
This made me chuckle. The way it came off to me was like "Shrug, meh what can you do?" With an amused smile. Or "Business as usual, carry on :)"
---
yep. I am starting to think that we will never see instanced areas. Maybe the engine doesnt allow to connect to a server but create an instanced space for a few players simultaneously...
---
Ok I didnt know that, thats  a good point. But I still think LowLevel Players should be able to join these events. Bethesda needs to find a way to make it fair for everyone
---
Sugar grove !
---
It's like trying to get through the strip in new vegas
---
😂🤣
---
It's technically a dungeon... but not in the MMO sense.
---
The dungeons in MMO sense (instanced adventures you play with a group) are going to come in Nuclear Winter, with what they call 'Vault *Raids.'*
---
...someone should give Beth a MMO dictionary.
---
It works for the assultron keycards at least?!
---
What about a TSE 50. Cal ? Is that any good or should i throw it in the bin?
---
Killed 3 SBQ and 2 dropped nothing after wasting 20+ mins. Other gave me loot.
---
Not really. I'm mulling over how to do that. I think two players on discord with me ... And me making the moves for them.
---
It’s annoying to kill any three star and get anything less than that I don’t want a 1 Star cloaking wood chest plate. I want a three star of literally anything else really.
---
If you look at your junk in your pip boy and switch to component view you can mark materials for search. These materials will then be tagged with a magnifying glass.
---
The Charleston Herald building usually has a few typewriters in &amp; there’s a mansion down near Summerville dam with an open garage, you can usually find a box there.
---
Just had the same issue three times in a row in adventure mode. Fourth try finally was a new server.
---
And serums, so why not booze?
---
Good idea
---
Does anyone know when the purveyor is coming out today?
---
Delayed by hours according to BSG about an hour ago
---
Honestly just grab fans and toy cars/trucks. The Vault-Tec Agricultural Research Center is usually a decent place for it early game.  Two boxes of loose screws and a desk fan behind the front desk, a fan or two upstairs, a fan downstairs and a lot of desks/containers which spawn them in. It’s usually my first stop if I’m running short.
---
I have had it work early on when they added the booze.  100% certain of this.
---
Honestly now I put super duper on and craft away, often times I  think that there is  server lag and super duper with notify well after pressing the combine button.
---
Does anyone know when she’s coming to Appalachia today or is it a surprise?
---
What platform are you on? Super mutants drop them a lot, as well as caps, guns and ammo. 
---
The office buildings, as well as sugar grove and the newspaper in Charleston have desk fans and typewriters, which is my main source.
---
Scrap every typewriter and gold and silver locket that you can. If you travel to The Cranberry Bog and go to abandoned Bog Town  the third floor of the bank has numerous typewriters. Be careful because that area is for higher level players.
---
I could see why some folks would charge high. It keeps the inventory numbers up so their camp looks more enticing.
---
Downtime (to apply patches) will *almost* always happen on Tuesdays.
---
Today's update isn't a new patch, they'll be 'turning on' the vendor when it's ready.  No patch needed, it was already in the game.  Not sure why they delayed the opening to today, maybe they were still working on some server-side code for it.  When it's time, they can just push the 'open doors' button and things will get going.
---
(honestly, you may have to zone out and back in to see the zone change, but that's just speculation).
---
Of course,lol thanks
---
Thats so dumb that this can happen :/
---
Here’s your attention, bye now🤡
---
Nah, snarky/smart ass replies get downvoted for what they offer- nothing.
---
Thumbs up bud
---
BABY NEEDS SNACK. I GIVE BABY SNACK OF CLEANER.
---
In which case they wouldn't register any DPS on ads. So why not use that. I have a level 200 toon and a level 60 alt. From the level 200 perspective I appreciate people running around doing ad control while I focus on DPS, so I don't begrudge them a share of the loot. And from the perspective of a level 60, I mean if ad control is all I'm good for \*at the time\* why should I be penalized for focusing on that?
---
Yeah I used to be there as well, until people started to call me a psychopath for liking PvP.
---
Some guys there are really sensitive.
---
Less d-bags. This app has a lot of sarcastic people that’ll really put down people on their posts &amp; the comments. Hate to see it we have a great community. There’s always rotten apples in a farm I suppose👌🏼
---
Hmu - @kreiggles !
---
Good luck. I would help but I'm at work right now,lol.
---
Funny!
---
Probably in a few hours which isn't great if you are not living in the US.
---
Almost funnier!
---
Well Im jealous. I make a lot of nukashine, for some reason people will spend 25-50 caps a bottle and  with the requirements being what they are I'd like to have a chance at some doubles. I guess I'm just being greedy.
---
Could be just bad luck with each server having a different player's camp in your spot. Might be a popular area?
---
I've only killed her once. The loot was so bad I don't think I'll ever take on that bullet-sponge ever again. It's just not worth it.
---
Goto abandened bog town take scaffold to top floor drop down elevator shaft one floor you'll find plenty of screw giving junk best to server hop 2-3 times
---
Fans, hotplates, clipboards (battered clipboards have no screws, but still have a spring), silver lockets, toy cars. Sugar Grove is a great place to get screws and springs.
---
The minigun has an attachment that is a literal shredder, it's very powerful. You could build for heavy weapons and utilize it's gun bashing.
---
Same thing happened to me. I got disconnected from server right when I finished Officer on Deck and didn’t get an achievement. So sad.
---
It's pretty damn good, just aim at something big and hold down the trigger and you basically can't die to almost anything
---
1 piece of chameleon armor is amazing. I used to consistently take down +100 level bloodied builds with a levle 25 crit pistol build (.44 pistol Conrad Kellogg’s build.) 
---
1st shot Torso, 2nd shot crit to the head, and they are downed. Most time they were stopped right in front of me looking right through me or they were marsupial jumping around (which gives VATs a clear shot)
---
That's a good idea best of luck ☺️
---
If they can and do often I will stay out.
---
Btw, where are the burrows? I wasn’t on much during the release of them.
---
I must agree in its current state that yea its not the best idea to start in survival mode as lvl 1 unless you want a serious challenge and can handle getting wrecked by everyone else
---
And?
---
That is true... While a lot of people over there believe everything they say to be absolute fact, though it's really just an assumption or opinion there's just far less of them. Less people over all over there.
---
When does Nuclear Winter Start?
---
I have seen some awful bases with the addition of player vending. I'm sure they've been there all along, but I never had the incentive to visit. A metal strut here or there just to subtly acknowledge gravity would be immeasurably appreciated.
---
Well technically if someone unlocks a box, the box remains unlocked until someone locks it again. So it’s fair enough than anyone can take it once it’s been unlocked. The glitch is the fact you have to store/scrap before you can lock it again and it costs you resources to re-lock it. You should be able to choose “lock” for free as in theory you still have the key. Though I suppose they make you the-build the lock because of it either being damaged...or because how if you house was burgled and someone picked the door, you’d want to change the locks anyway.
---
"I've never had any items vanish from my inventory. But I don't dupe items so maybe that is why."
---
Or maybe those two things are completely unrelated. I, like you, have never duped and had my second favorite dropped gun vanish from my inventory a little over a week ago.
---
this is first and foremost a Fallout game. it's not even a full online experience like ESO. the playerbase is proof of that. so they shouldn't expect the majority of us to spend months, years farming for gear because that's not the playerbase for Fo76.
---
but more to my point, you illustrate it perfectly. "F everyone else because I'm a masochist".
---
If anyone needs a fix now, just start the Bethesda launcher as an administrator.
---
Fast travel over to the Whitespring hotel entrance (not the bunker of the train station).  When you load in, walk a few yards towards the hotel and look at the hood of the red car (give it just a minute to make sure everything loads in).  If you see a corpse on the hood, you're good to go.  If not, log out and repeat.
---
I’m okay with a chance.
---
Lol I hope melee players get blessed with their rolling pins
---
Dude, I'm a carpenter. I've been building houses and such for nearly my entire life. 
---
And people in general have been doing for thousands of years. 
---
It would be extremely easy (on the concept front- not so much the labor) to strip down one house's materials and use them to reinforce another building. 
---
All the materials are there. You would probably just have to be pretty selective with the lumber. 
---
Though it would probably be relatively easy to get that lumber mill in working condition. You already have robots collecting material. 
---
All the nails and such would still be usable if carefully recovered. And not at all that hars to forge. 
---
And believe me, insulation isn't going anywhere. 
---
That will be itchy pink death til the end of time. 
---
Paint would be a little harder but I would imagine if you stirred the living shit out of it, then it would probably be usable.
---
"The Purveyor is making some last minute preparations for the first day of business and should be opening the doors of her shop within the next couple of hours. If anything changes we'll let you know!" -Valseek   
---
The camera won't register objects if you're moving or have recently moved. Stop, give it about 2-3 seconds, then objects should register in it. This threw me off for so long.
---
Expectations to end duplication glitches is not a far reach
---
I totally agree. Just throwing that out there. Yeah it's much easier for melee builds because they can have so much more versatility. Max out str and do whatever you want with your other stats. While being a rifleman with a shotgun backup has me min/maxing trying to get all the perks I need to be viable across 3 separate stats
---
I thin BGS wanted to make melee just as viable as ranged guns, as I remember in the run up to BETA and release a lot of people were concerned that it wouldn't be viable. Lo and behold,the first meta to appear in the game was 2h melee. 
---
They overcompensated making melee *too* viable.
---
And I cannot get over the fact that rifles are the ONLY weapon type that doesn't get weight reduction perk. I had to spend tons of caps on weapon weight reduction armor just to make it so I could carry around a fully modded lever action and handmade.
---
They are in Harper's Ferry. There are two entrances to them.
---
I love this idea. I think either I would need to trim down the decorations or plead Todd for more camp budget to make it work!
---
Well put 😊
---
That would be great yes I’m on ps4, my kids at school right now, very excited to come home to purveyor lol
---
Doesn’t sound right. What are you naming and when?  I utilize 4 different power armors and they go in and out of the stash with no issues at all
---
fk i just re-read it.
---
I renamed one (the only one I bother to use) a number of weeks ago, and it's still got the same name.  Taking it out and putting it back hasn't effected that for me.
---
Are you renaming it when it's in your inventory, or some other way?
---
Soon, hopefully. Hoping we start hearing news in the next Inside the Vault, and then E3 is around June 10th-13th, I believe. I would expect news there, but it's too hard for me to decide if they would hold a roadmap and a trailer until then.
---
This post: https://bethesda.net/community/topic/342664/where-s-the-purveyor/62?language%5B%5D=en does not say it has been delayed by hours, it says it should be released in a couple of hours from the time of that post, which is, coincidentally, when everyone has been assuming it would be released.  ( also, it just opened as I was writing this post.)
---
Berkley?!
---
 Can’t stop won’t stop looting
---
Its sound, accuracy and realistic shooting feeling is makes this gun fun.
---
Elaborate please?
---
If I get a Tse weapon my first roll I will randomly gift it to one of you guys
---
Role players would probably fill the slaver faction
---
So... maybe?
---
Oops then I shall downvote myself
---
Oh mannn that’s sick I wish I could’ve watched the doors open
---
Thank you !
---
Imagine I'm using a power armor with all t-60 pieces. I name it "T-60" so I can see t-60 instead of power armor chasis so I can difference it from the rest with no name. But when I get them in my inventory, or in my stash, maybe 1h later the name is gone!
---
The 65 scrip choice for the Purveyor choice I guess
---
Swing speed and anti armor. Both coveted effects together and melts. High demand.
---
Can't be first on the bitch list if you actually take time to explain yourself.
---
A Combat Armor piece I purchased from a player vendor machine was assigned the name I gave a Power Armor Chasis, which at the time was in my stash.
---
You can only have 25k. Anything over that you do not get. The items will still sell though.
---
addendum: I guess my level 5 chameleon wood armor that I spent weeks farming for and rolled myself is in high demand then, because that's one of the items that vanished from my inventory.
---
Nuke incoming !!!
---
I would love to have a "lovely camp you got here" emote. I found one yesterday in the mire that blew me away and all i could do was give a thumbs up.
---
Honestly, it’s unfortunate. I got sick of the RNG in the game so I bought my guns on the private market. I have no idea if some are duped – most likely. Having said that it doesn’t ruin the game for me. I compare myself to myself. Nothing is going to be done about what has already occurred. Do you have any ideal the backlash if Bethesda took everyone’s guns away from the people who honestly had no idea it was duped? This is something I think about so little until I come on this sub and see the occasional post.  I don’t know how some people got their stuff but it’s honestly none of my business and is so inconsequential to my gaming experience. 90% of my time is spent playing alone.
---
 It’s like complaining about a rich kid driving a Mercedes only because his parents are rich. He didn’t really even work for it. Nothing good comes form that mentality. My advice would be stop worrying about what everyone else is doing. I mean it’s important, but then again…really not so important. We’re talking about coveting in game items.
---
See. This does not help this case of Friday-itis I’m dealing with at lunchtime on Thursday.
---
Sweet, I can start replacing my 1* chameleon pieces!
---
Max on all mentioned except crit savvy and maybe grim reapers. Don't forget Tank Killer. Key for big enemies.
---
I agree, that fix penalizes the people who are trying to help. It became an issue of collateral damage. The 10 people being dicks hurt the 2 that want to be helpful.
---
Yesterday I wasted 1000+ 5.56 rounds and got no loot at all, just empty without loading icon.
---
Weird thing: After about 10 minutes we had the queen at 75% of the second hp bar. Then a guy appeared and wrecked the SBQ in 10 seconds. Any idea which weapon is still that powerful after all the nerfs? Or is Bobblehead stacking back?
---
Loool ghoulslayer sentinel +25radrezist scout right leg. Fuck me in the ass please
---
I had the same problem. Got my backpack a couple days later then I could have if I had the camera. I found it in completely random toolbox and didn’t expect it. I heard looting around the Scout locations is a good way to find the camera.
---
Disappears into oblivion.
---
Not a new thing but yea. Like getting kicked in the nuts during a tooth extraction via pliers... lol
---
Good to know. Thanks. Maybe they need to increase that max caps now that we have player vending
---
yup, I've been using heavy weapons for my build, like the gatling gun  and what happens when the enemy is close to me like we're both sucking face my bullets seem to go to the extreme far left, even though my barrel is right inside their mouth. because I don't know why... they should really fix the aiming part of their game because that's like half the game unless you're the other half with melee and apparently they've been having trouble too I think.
---
Gone, mysteriously!
---
Lovely
---
Haha so very true
---
Yep!
---
Your welcome to your opinion, I do respect your feelings on it although I disagree
---
I’ve peaked man
---
Uh, I’ll take it if you don’t want it.
---
I've heard that you don't get anything if the total would go over 25K, so OP would lose all 6000.
---
Haven't verified this myself (and I'm not going to!), but I've heard that from a couple sources.
---
Thats not bad, might be valuable for a bit consider it could be the first scout armor with sentinel
---
You can tag items (screws) to show a magnifying glass on the junk you're looting that has what you're looking for. And this can be done for multiple items.
---
Don't worry. I'll hold the extra for you.
---
Thanks everyone for the handy tips, very much appreciate it.
---
Ok, doesn’t mean people are going to give over 9000 caps for it
---
That's cool 100c was the absolute highest I was gonna sell at. I was thinking 50-100 unless it was an extraordinary ability (like my 15% damage reduction from robots I save for Silo's)
---
Was it a camera photo that you needed to take?
---
If yes, did you take the picture with a camera or photo mode?
---
Also, did GRAFTON MONSTER appear in the viewfinder when you took the picture?
---
just lol, don't do it dude.
---
I will right away sir
---
I was on a server like that early this morning. Quite amazing I must say. Plenty of xp and loot.
---
2 out of 3 effects are pretty good. Someone might give you a few hundred caps for it, or you can throw it into the legendary wood chipper and try again tomorrow...
---
But it is a new thing.  You could not get wood armor with more than 1\* before now.
---
Thanks for the tag! I'll pass this along to the team.
---
Believe me I o ly manage to build big square box houses myself. I'm not creative but it's at least functional.
---
Plans that I don’t have. Disease cures. Outfits that I don’t have. Serum mats. Fusion cores. 
---
I usually sell out of 1c shotgun shells and 3c screws. Reasonably priced legendaries move quickly.
---
No such thing as extra caps lol
---
Why would you ever leave your armor if you aren't at a camp?
---
You can find broken Deluxe cameras in the wild. I fixed like 5 of them yesterday cause I was gonna sell them but it seems you can't
---
Damn, I've been wasting ionized meat and mass
---
Yeah, the max no matter what is 25k caps. If you sell, I don’t believe you’ll lose all, just the difference of the purchase and your limit. 
---
This is why some of my friends have cap mules. Whereas I can’t seem to stay above 2000c.

 &gt; Thanks for the tag! I'll pass this along to the team.
---
Which system are you on? If XB1 I have two extras right now that I crafted from broken ones I found.
---
The .50 seems to be decent. Faster than a Gatling, but it starts and stops on the trigger. No spin up delay to deal with, and the rate of fire  is not *throw away all the ammo* like the minigun. .50 ammo is also a lot more cost efficient.
---
I personally don't like it as much as the Gatling due to rate of fire, but it does seem perfectly good. To me a slow rate of higher damage is better than a faster rate of lower damage. That part is more personal preference. If I found a .50 with the right stars on it, I'd use it.
---
The 'raids' of the new Vaults coming will be instanced.  They didn't say this will be instanced previously, chicken little.
---
AA pipe revolver.

---
Sentinel scout armor, and other things, mostly "god roll" oh my god.
---
Hit all the ground trash and selling the cooked meat gets me around 500-600 caps a SBQ run. Selling stable flux gets me another 300-400. Grinding bad legendaries get me some scrip or I sell the others for 300-500 each. I generally net 1200-1300 caps a run. After 2-3 runs I then hop and buy a 3\* I want from player vendors. Convoluted but effective!
---
I want a picture! I dont believe it... 🤷🏻‍♂️🤣🤣
---
That would be nice and make sense, especially after all the ammo you chew through. At some point a couple months back every time I killed a 2 or 3 star mod they DID drop 2/3 star items. Maybe it was a glitch or just random luck.. but it felt damn good.
---
Not even opening that can of worms huh.
---
Sure there is, I'll just hold anywhere from 1 to 25k for you, so you don't have to worry about going over. 😉
---
Yea I do rename them from the pip boy
---
It seems to be server based from what I've experienced.
---
I know for a fact that legendary spawn locations are server based and they will always spawn in the same spot as long as you remain on that server. The only thing that changes is the level of the legendary spawn.
---
well.. I got the Stalker's Cryolater..pretty much what everyone was saying..F$#@
---
We only have one glimpse of prewar America and that's in fallout 4. Which didn't have dreads as a hair option . But it literally doesn't matter there's fucking giant lizard monsters and bat dragons but dreadlocks are too much to ask lmfao.
---
Choosing the right outfit
---
I don’t believe now but soon
---
One of my "this should not have worked because it was 3x my level" Deathclaw kills is because it was fighting a mob of Super Mutants.
---
I just took stealthed sniper shots a couple of times to tag it, but not draw aggro. Let the super mutants wreck it and them killed them, lol.
---
I love when the NPCs hate each other and do my work for me.
---
Watching a gaggle of scorched chase a ghoul out of sight was hilarious.
---
How did I miss that? Which event please?
---
Fast travel causes food and water loss fyi
---
on ps4? im hunting for a  few final plans on my 5 characters i maintain
---
Also, hot plates in kitchens give a screw each.
---
I had a dead ghoul moonwalking in the air at WS. If I got close enough, I could see the contents of his corpse. I snapped a few pics of him in the trees.
---
Thought they said vault raid would be instanced.
---
4 caps per can? ABSOLUTLY!
---
I struggled through there at level 30 with my brother and while it was interesting it didnt leave much to be desired. But hey, I gotta thank Bethesda! This game helped me reconnect with my older brother. Ot feels like we are kids again, discovering new things all the time.
---
Thanks for the info
---
At work also wondering the same thing. Also wondering if I can cash in all of my scrip today or if it’s limited!
---
Just got a medics ultra cite Gatling laser 3*, with limb damage and faster reload. Pretty nice I’d say.
---
It's gonna be a while before I can get on, quick question; Is there a limit to how many times you can buy from her, per day?
---
Who wants to video this. My character is an Ordained Minister of Dudism. K-mart Bathrobe included!
---
Yes I believe they do. I’ve seen mention of Valseek saying so on one of the fo76 platforms.
---
As my nickname, this confused me quite a bit. xD
---
The Purveyor hasn't dropped just yet, we're all still waiting, unfortunately.
---
That's an odd thing to enjoy
---
The datamine said it can only be 1 star?  weird.
---
Dum Dum Dum Dum Du D' Dum   Dum
---
It was sold...so I guess you're wrong? Lol. On the reddit it's worth around 9 - 12k.
---
This is what I mean, I don't want every average Joe schmo to buy it. Only those with actual knowledge of this game and the worth of legendaries.
---
The same way sentinel/assassin armor is worth around 15 k. (Literally makes you like invincible in Pvp)
---
This is why I go to the reddit market for these things they sell quickly and people know the worth of these items with the price check discussions. It's honestly nice :) they're the trading side of the game.
---
First roll is an explosive nocturnal .44 with 250 damage resist while reloading.
---
WE OUT HERE
---
It just did
---
I forget the name but it's the one with mole miners in the ash heap that you get a trophy for. Sometimes you get attacked by little suicide bomber mole rats.
---
I found one guarding the Excavator registration terminal.
---
Started the fight with several frag grenades. Didn't hurt her HP too much, but crippled both her legs.
---
They still crawl pretty fast, but much more manageable than then sprinting around and punching you in the head. Just have cover for when their laser beam charges up.
---
I still just cant understand how people make that kind of money in this game
---
Actually word is, that she is available now.
---
because on the market place sites people will indeed pay that much, so of course it would be foolish not to ask that much
---
the market place sites really do set the standard, in game vending seems to have to be much lower just to get people to buy as they are all bargain hunting
---
Yeah xb1
---
Oops, look at me, sucking it up. xD My bad!
---
I thought that survival was supposed to be hard. It's not survival going in with a full build level 100+.  I dont mind being killed by other players.  When I die to another players who is level 157 on day one kinda puts a damper on the fun.
---
So set everything in your camp to 0 with that logic
---
Thanks! I must have missed that.
---
Harper's ferry. Water drop map markers.
---
When I was low level, I would farm the heck out of this event.  Once the monster dies, the event concludes.  maybe you left the area without knowing?
---
Like the entrance to the pumps in Burrows. Should require two people, one to turn the valve and one to open the door. But if you have Speed Demon you can do both yourself.
---
I mean't I hoped that you could buy more than 1 of each choice per day.
---
Hes out
---
Jesus...
---
Ah just be a man and use a big leaf
---
*You have contracted Poison Ivy*
---
I barely even know what that is
---
LEGENDARY PIPE REVOLVERS!
---
Because a high level character would essentially have every single perk and with the right special distribution would be a god in battle swapping cards out to avoid all damage and always having maxed perks for every weapon they have.  Basically it would nullify specs and homogenize the game beyond a certain player level.
---
Yes Xbox 1
---
Does scripting it back to her give you credit back towards your 150 limit?
---
I mean fuck me in the ass and i will let you, because how happy i am :D
---
I got two shot lever action with +33% vats hit chance and faster movement speed while aiming
---
Knocked my old standard lever action out the park!
---
Argh, I was all excited to go get some 3\* melee weapon but this is probably what I'll get.
---
Berkley springs Station. Just northwest of harpers ferry. Look for the end of the railroad tracks. I'm sure there is a train station there, but I don't know if they added a map marker.  I'm at work, so not sure
---
All locations so far:

---
I recommend picking one and hopping a couple times.  Wavy Willards (parking lot) and  Tyler County Fairgrounds (seats to the East) have been good to me.
---
For the future of Inside the Vault, I'd love to see some concepts or a discussion of how ideas evolved from inception to finally making it into the game!
---
http://imgur.com/gallery/uzKxFwn
---
There's my proof lol
---
What's a dick!...............pls record 😂
---
It is finally open! Unfortunately it looks like they remove the 65-scrip "Mystery Pick" option, but hey.
---
Bethesda, can you please make a new game mode that is just whitesprings?  Ever POI that has a building to enter has the same "two loading screens" issue, but we're only concerned about whitesprings because there is no game outside of it.  Whitesprings is the best place to get legendaries so that we'll be better prepared to farm whitesprings.
---
I'm on about the daily challenge to take a camera photo of the Grafton Monster at night, not the event.
---
I just found her. Lol. I didn't remember the station being here. Saw it on the compass and was like well duh. Lmao
---
Quad capacity Explosive double barrel shotgun haha, it's a riot! 😁
---
has anyone else crafted on a 3star piece of wood armor from the purv and have it turn into a 1 star? put shrouded on a 3star i got from him an it went down to 1 star
---
Not about to see your light...
---
But if you wanna find hell with me
---
I can show you what it's like!!!!!!!!!!!!
---
.....Till you're bleeding
---
On my way there!
---
You can also just fast travel to Berkley, lands you right by it.
---
Actually, you can play it. That part is correct.
---
Why would I ever enter inferior power armor in the first place?
---
There’s one guy I traveled to who had his shop inside his building, but all the doors had level 3 locks. So you get trapped there unless you have those perks.
---
Very first roll I got was AAE double barrel with 25% less ap cost.
---
Holy shot this is a game changer
---
Yeah 65 option is gone lol
---
Thank you had no idea you could do that, we have been trying to memorize all the stuff lol
---
For me, it hasn't updated at all. Can't find or see anything.
---
This sounds like a bug report rather than a suggestion. Power armor renaming has worked fine for me since the feature was released. The names haven't changed since I set them weeks ago.
---
IIRC it was 431 base damage on fatman in fallout 4.
---
Also scout armor and pipe revolver can be 3* legendary now.
---
My buddy and I went to Harper's ferry yesterday, found four 3* super mutants in a row, each got 2-3 3* drops.. last few white springs runs, nothing but 1*. I think that place is done for.
---
Restart your client!
---
Holly chit! I've been playing since day one. First one I ever done did seent... lol Nice! Can i have it?!
---
And it have shrouted mod, which is best for sneaking.
---
Sadly where it uses atomic shop items other players can't place them in your camp, you could use some basic items and if they place them They can use them; sadly it would lose its visual appeal.
---
I've never seen anyone use one have also never heard of anyone using one or asking for one on the Market, though I have hope that something similar will be added to the game when the Fujinia base gets some attention (there's reference to a delayed shipment of gear, so we might get some communist-themed weapons in-game one day)
---
The station has been closed the entire game and was never a location on the map
---
I love logging on the game at whitespring straight in to a nuke zone in normal armour..never get borded of that one.. Inside please yes!
---
For my main.... 5 of each, range and melee

Nocturnal golf club with power attack and +1 strength...

 Quad bolt action with bash and agility....

Mutant slayers 10mm submachine gun 25% less vats cost and 33% vats chance... 
---
Stalkers submachine gun with faster fire rate and perception... 
---
Junkies combat rifle with bash and faster reload
---
go to fo76 bazaar for price checks
---
That's not a two shot explosive gatling if it doesn't have two shot
---
This needs to be top voted request now!
---
That shit is going to be ridiculous in the markets.
---
I only know it because there is a bots on parade right there and Bethesda left cracks in the windows you could snoop through

She
---
I always give the same amount. 2 dog food, 2 purified water, one rad-x, 1 rad-away, and 2 stimpacks
---
&gt; If someone dies in front of you do "take all", take only the valuables or protect the bag until the owner comes back?
---
I would take it all. 
---
&gt; If someone has a work shop you need yo do try and team up for it or just fight them for it?
---
That workshop belongs to me now.
---
&gt; Where do you "hangout"/do most of your farming?
---
The Mire and Cranberry Bog.

&gt; You seek out bouty players or just keep doing your own thing?

I kill them.

&gt; Power armor or nah?

Bone Raider Excavator PA.

I killed 3 SBQs in 20-25 minutes this morning before work, and I got some excellent drops. I'd been working on an alt, I hadn't done a SBQ run in a while, it was a pleasant surprise. But it shouldn't be so surprising.
---
My first: 3\* legendary shovel lol
---
Lol gave me an idea to play random Danzig/Misfits/Samhain songs on area chat while the shop is open.
---
I actually am playing with a friend and plan on enslaving him pretty soon.
---
Of course it's when i just turned off the game x)
---
And also legendary bone clubs
---
I just waited until the stars were out and fast travelled to Charleston trainyard for the one there
---
players from Mississippi and whereabouts might be fond of the idea... 
---
too soon?
---
I got wood

She can give a lot of stuff at 3* that wasn’t possible before. I got a ultracite Gatling laser 3* and never remember seeing them before. Some one said they got 3* wood armor too.
---
I was pretty confused reading that 😂
---
oh hell no
---
I wana  see a 2 shot explosive [incest cool shit here] Hunting Rifle
---
Wack
---
Lv. 30, so that's a price hit. Not actually TSE, so that's another hit.
---
Also legendary bone club
---
Having just about the same issue atm.
---
I got a lot of crap overall, but I'm happy with this find from the vendor.
---
[https://i.imgur.com/OfZZ5Ps.png](https://i.imgur.com/OfZZ5Ps.png)
---
They call it a train station for a reason
---
You could sell people into slavery in fallout 4 too
---
Or, alternatively. First, remove the drill from the loot table, and make 3star enemies drop 3stars. If must, decrease chance of "good" prefixes.
---
I made it to her, burned all my 1k script and saw no one lol
---
I took the time to move my camp unit around until the fast travel point was decent, only to have the point move itself to another random spot a day later. A solution would be nice.
---
In the meantime, if you're having trouble finding vending machines, the camp icon is more or less centered on the machine.
---
Heavy weapons aren't the efficient way to kill the queen though. I run a heavy gun/support role, and I burn plenty of ammo. Two friends I met through the game who play very regularly, run some sick bloodied melee builds. We get the queen on the ground and let those guys go to work, she's done in minutes.
---
Seems a bit odd considering the availability of Marsupial. I suspect with the Lead Champagne buff it makes it a bit more viable in PVP? That said, I'm almost certain V.A.T.S is smart enough to recognise that an airborne target is more vulnerable than a player who is partially obscured by terrain.
---
So it has 4 stars?
---
I think it was Vault 95
---
poof!
---
No doubt in my mind.
---
Was it country roads?
---
Jeez so demanding there already doing more with the community more then half the other AAA studios out there now you want even more?
---
My first weapon was a Instigating Explosive Faster movement speed while aiming Bolt-action pipe rifle! Things so sweet it works with pistol and Rifle cards! Then I got Instigating Faster Swing speed +1 Endurance Ski Sword. I am so jumping right now XD
---
what's not an opinion is what the majority of the playerbase wants. we're not always in sync (tse, sen, cav nerf), but facts are facts.
---
most players, at least as of right now, don't want to spend years farming for good gear.
---
It's open!!!!!
---
It was some garbage rap
---
I've heard of people taking every item off their character and still having some weight left. I posit that the phantom weight is just yesterday's lunch.
---
Can you go on right now? My GT is TacticalBooBoo
---
I'm at work right now.  My psn is Fallen_CRISIS.  it is 9 21 am pst, and I'll be home around 3 pm pst.
---
Dude I'm totally cool with you buying your gear with real money. the problem I have is gear being sold that is duped, those items were not intended to be realesed in that quantity at this stage of the game or the developers would increased the RNG themselves. Since you feel it doesn't effect you directly duped gear does still effect the economy. You might not care but I sure do. I'm good at PvP I've had 72 kill streak one week I'm not cry about getting wrecked by better players in crying because the game economy is a bit ridiculous duplication of items is Theft it is cheating flat out it's wrong. 2nd if you would of read my post entirely you would noticed that I did not recommend taking everyone guns away because of the backlash instead new survival mode.
---
bought 22 2 stars. no quads no bloodied no explosive. 1 two shot.
---
Just read that someone dropped a nuke at the station.
---
i was totally going to say that.  i love how infinity war makes him look so noble after he saw titan "overpopulate" and fall.  In the comics Titan falls because thanos is pissed at his daddy and attacks it...and yea, the whole snap things in the comic is because he wants to bang lady death.

For some reason I never pick up clipboards. That will have to change. In addition to this list, peppermills and globes give screws. Pretty sure tongs do too

Yup, pretty much what I've deduced.  Take my upvote.

Well done, sir...   well done....

Maybe try the one that spawns near / opposite Poseidon Power Plant..?
---
Bummer did you have to server hop or could you spend everything at once? I'm at work for a few more hours.
---
It's on now
---
I have experienced this. That’s how I know.
---
Add a prime receiver and that's my SBQ gun, fun as hell. Plus it only takes like one Whitespring nuke to keep me nicely topped up on Ultracite shells.
---
No, they just think every Explosive weapon is a TSE
---
Im uhhh.. just going to sit around and let this post take its course.
---
I did too honestly lol going off the words of others on reddit. But my brother is like lvl 100 and he’s already bargained with the purveyor 10 times and he told me that everything has been lvl 50 for him
---
Just done the same and it worked this time. No idea why it didn't before unless it has to be specifically Grafton Monster, not parasitic etc.
---
What was it? Id like a good one just for fun
---
It's got two shot.
---
I got both Ultracite 3* gatling laser and 3* wood armor
---
well that sucks
---
localization issue?
---
I did too.  3* wood left leg with unyielding, +1 strength and blocking damage resist
---
Thanks! I need to 'splore more.
---
It's a TSE, sorry for the confusion
---
Yeah did that and it works :)
---
Thanks, will do
---
Nope only 3\*
---
Explosive reload speed .50 cal, instigating damage while aiming BP rifle, junkie's explosive weightless assault rifle, explosive BP rifle
---
Only wet farts would truly be funny. Unless you're into dry humour. *pun*
---
Purveyor lol
---
havent seen that before so it seems like you discovered good news!
---
I didn't even bother with yesterday's challenges because they were so baroque. I get that they want to promote the new content by making related challenges, but some of these just have too many qualifiers.

Take a photo of a player with 6 thistles in their inventory while wearing a Fasnacht mask at Top of The World in a radstorm (0/10)

I became obsessed with base building during Fallout 4 and I am very glad they continued it in 76. I wish I could build more, it's all I want to do to be honest.

So trash?

Everyone in the pool that can't read. Idiot and shallow people to the wedding pool @ watogga. 🤣. Hope every gets what they want/deserves. Hope ya'll have fun.

You could, but when you pass gas you leave a trail of bubbles and it breaks stealth so they took it out due to the complaints.   /s

Start another char. I'm on my third atm and it's more giving than before. Doing everything better now.
---
It will be very visible, trust me.
---
Wow, better than my school’s line-up XD
---
battered clip board now gives a screw and spring
---
What you mean localization? It happens when I rename it from the pip boy
---
I found this useful when I first started playing when the game launched, its JV's Ultimate Junk Guide:
---
https://youtu.be/3MQFAL40bZ8
---
Can’t blame you. I’ve burned through a lot of ammunition on the Queen and then she flew away and never came back. That’s frustrating. I still want a legendary log cabin made from the armor though.
---
Isn't she supposed to have Instanced Loot as well? Last time i helped (very little) take her down i did get a reward for the mission completion but her corpse was looted right in front of my eyes by someone else. No plans :(
---
No problem! I thought it was neat seeing little jihadist molerats trying to kill me.  Have fun!
---
I didnt want people to fight, it's just been in fallout for the past like 3 games so it seemed topical.
---
The combat rifle is decent, especially if Bethesda nerfs bloodied.
---
http://imgur.com/gallery/uzKxFwn 
---
Yes indeed
---
Alright, thanks for the info! I imagine that I would be more likely to hoard scrip until I got enough for a big spree, that's why I asked :) May your rolls be god-like!
---
Anyone else not able to trigger Camden today? When the Brewing patch hit I couldn't do those quests for half a week. I sure hope this Purveyor hasn't just screwed me out of another 9 tokens... I'm only at 200ish of 450?
---
In march max, I was on a server where 3 Russian guys were in nuke silos at the same time. Each launched a nuke after the queen was defeated. The one who fast traveled to the event was the one who nuked it. After the nuke, there'd be a cooldown of a few minutes, and another one would launch another nuke. Same, and then the third one. All at prime.
---
At least I think that's what happened. We killed the queen in record time (max 5 mins, entire server combined) with lowlevels and highlevels joining in. Myself, I intend to launch at least 1 nuke per day, preferrably at prime or whitesprings. But, it's not working out.
---
Prime time, boys!
---
So there *are* legendary pipe revolvers now? Badass
---
I still wished they do what eso does and have livestreams with the devs talking about new stuff once or twice a month. Just something to show the humans behind the work .
---
I have mine on but it's in the entryway to my chemistry/brewing nook but is avoidable as my build also requires me to have high rads. If only I could figure out how to control it with a terminal rather than a switch.

Most of the heavy weapons-specific perks don't improve the damage of the shredder. Without a damage log, I can't say I've 100% verified this, but I have only seen damage increases from generic damage increases (Blood Mess, Adrenaline, Tenderizer, Glow Sight) and no improvement from perks that state Melee or Heavy Weapons as far as damage goes. Gunsmith is a requirement, and I'd go ahead and say Bear Arms is too since you'll want to carry a few miniguns to deal with the condition degradation issues.
---
I mean maybe it's a bug specific to localization because of alt keyboards screwing w the code
---
Wait, does she function like a vendor, where only one person can use her at a time???
---
They need to play the game and progress in the story naturally, if you're lvl 15 and only part way through the Responders quest you shouldn't be taking on the SBQ..even lore wise it makes no sense.
---
the daily limit? nope
---
Yep, and shovels, and scout/forest armor, and bone clubs/hammers...
---
It was just the location of legendary exchange machines.
---
Awesome same time here.
---
Yep! Forgot tongs. I pick up every globe I see for the cork, I don't use a lot but I always have enough because of the globes :P Oh handcuffs have a screw also.
---
Hm I play in PS4
---
I can't say I would fill it but it would be interesting and add a new threat. How would you even earn your freedom or anything? Clearly nobody wants to just be caged up all day.
---
It's likely that was referring to the scrip exchange machines, not the Purveyor.
---
ok, thanks for the reply, and good luck with your store!
---
Damnnn what are the other perks? I have an instigating bpr that does insane damage but it’s only 1* :(
---
Drop deuce, because fuck editing an autocorrect.
---
Let's pray someone get's a god roll weapon today. Will be interesting to see what she is giving out ;)
---
SHOVELS??? I SO NEED ONE
---
I think it has more to do with you transitioning from the Savage Divide to the Ash Heap (Camden location). That's just how you trigger the daily.
---
CLEAN BABY'S TUMTUM! SQUEAKY SQUEAKY!
---
I have mutations on my low level character that I maintain by drinking grape cola to remove rads.  Totally pissed when I lost one by fast traveling to a vendor camp which spawned me right in the decontamination shower.
---
Sounds good for PvP Faster fire and Crit refresh are desireable effects
---
I got 2 two-shot gatling lasers in a row, nothing too fancy but could be worse :) One of them had 90% reduced weight so, into the vending machine it goes!
---
First on my server too. Just dropped 1000 scrip. Here is what I got:
---
***AA, vats crit, 25% less vats Assaultron head
---
*** Ass, 50% limb, 1 str Ski Sword 
---
** Executioner explosive pipe revolver
---
** Exterminator, 50% limb Chinese officer Sword 
---
** Ghoul slayer, bashing Gatling plasma
---
** mutant slayer, 50% limb DB shotgun
---
** mutant slayer, vats crit Handmade
---
** nocturnal bashing Gatling gun
---
** trouble, 40% power attack spear
---
*** Vampires, explosive, reload speed DB shotgun
---
** zealots, 50% melee block Bowie knife
---
** Ghoul slayer, +1 chr robot ra
---
** Mutant slayer +1 per Robot chest
---
*** mutants, +1 per, 50% durability Wood LA
---
** nocturnal +1 int Combat LL
---
** Trouble +1 per Urban Scout chest
---
*** vanguard, +1 end, weapon weight Leather RA
---
*** vanguard, +1 per, sweet spot Urban Scout LA
---
Notes: all max level. Also the random choice for 65 scrip option was not available.
---
someone advised they got like 6 explosive weapons out of 10 rolls...
---
Haha yeah. Kill a queen in your undies. I'm actually trying to complete my crafting set. I've gotten my prime plasma core charges just about to 400. Though the last batch I made was 350s.
---
I been there
---
Sweet.
---
https://bethesda.net/community/topic/342581/anyone-tried-running-a-junkie-build?language%5B%5
---
theres a picture, the only one missing is alcohol, and pay no mind to the mothman thing.
---
I heard a wise man once say: 
---
&gt; An armed society is a polite society
---
Username does not check out
---
Survival challenge is bugged and counts in adventure too right now
---
On the track that goes over the bridge? You don't have to tell me where exactly, as I like to keep my camps secret. I only build in pre existing structures, and trains are one of my favourite places to build. 
---
There's a couple of intact buses dotted about that work quite well too.
---
I have instigating the dragon that does even more, but only 1*
---
that is total balls
---
Is that good or bad? I’m guessing the 2nd option...
---
maybe they thought it was too good of a deal, and scrapped the idea
---
Hey, thanks for this! Using it and loving it!
---
Only three times? You must be better at this than I am. I sometimes rebuild more than once in a day! My learning curve must be more... shallow.
---
Weird -- I could have sworn I saw a gun this morning.
---
Looks like I was hallucinating in my pre-coffee state.
---
(Autocorrect tried to replace pre-coffee with pee-coffee).
---
...makes it easier to know who to block.
---
First day grand opening issue. Everyone has 1000+150 scrips to spend. By tomorrow, it will be back down to 150 scrips a day and faster customer turnover.
---
it's just an event. 
---
as for dungeons, dungeons are what Bethesda refers to as an interior location that needs a load screen to access. literally they are referred to as dungeons in the engine.
---
not a dungeon like Warcraft considers them.
---
 My mic is always on. Maybe I should go play some glitch to the crowd.
---
 Kidding!
---
Interesting! Also thanks for the head up!
---
Three rolls and I got two bolt pipe rifles that were almost identical Other than the last effect being defence while aiming and reduced ap cost. Both were awful with the other effects. So I trashed them and re-rolled one and got a Gatling fun that was also crap. So scrapped that and now I’m building up scrips again to try again
---
That’s how the purveyor gets around.
---
Ha, there are were just six people all lined up waiting patiently in the world I was in just in.
---
That's person RNGesus' chosen one lol
---
Fuck this game
---
I'm sure I read that wood can only be 1 star anyway lol so might be a mistake it's even dropping as 3*
---
Basically don't choose armor or the mystery pick right now because you might get wood armor that will revert to 1*
---
Nice! Used up my 1150 scrip, got and 3* AA lmb dmg +agilty Tesla (not bad) and a bunch of stuff to go back to the scrapper lol
---
Burrows are not a vault.
---
Same goes for the Arktos Biomes.
---
yea thats what im thinking
---
Oh I'm stupid XD
---
Can confirm, got a 3* wood, reverted to 1* after logging out/in.
---
That is weird. I'd consider if no different than selling nuke cards...
---
Fun stuff
---
Happened to me by just logging out and back in
---
Nice one..! 👍🏻
---
Only time I’m in PA is to fight scorch beasts pretty much... or if I’m farming material and then I use my excavator for weight.
---
Dude... I have never wanted so many things at once before XD
---
Lucky thing. I haven't even gotten the prime plasma receiver yet, after about 10-20 queen kills. And I'm having trouble maintaining my lead, copper and nuclear material reserves due to plasmacores alone. So I have to resort to, God forbid, *asking* others for plasmacores. More like begging, but still.
---
If I use my plasma gatling for only queen kills and destroying nuclear keycard carrying cargobots, will the damage remain same against the cargobots? If it doesn't, I'm probably not going to get the prime receiver for the plasma gatling.
---
This is why my machine is outside, against the foundation. I have barricades and turrets surrounding it but that's all. I also leave my front door unlocked sometimes for people who need a stash box or some workbenches.  Unfortunately a couple of communist robots ruined that the other day. Have to get some more circuits to repair my door turrets before I remove the lock again. Only punji board is in my bedroom. Also I keep that door locked.
---
Misread your post. Yeah. Vaults are instanced.
---
Agree but some how ammo is still the problem...
---
But the weapon is always in my inventory, often used against scorchbeasts
---
Ah so pretty much still not meant to be 3*. That’s great lol.
---
My line broke out into a firefight
---
I found the best way to sell stuff on those sites is to simply post what you want to sell, then, as opposed to asking for a set price initially, you just say "accepting offers caps or trades"
---
I was shocked to see how much people offer, then sometimes the next person offers even more to 1up the other person
---
and, if you dont get a price you want, just delete your post and try again later
---
i found sometimes the same post doesnt sell on the weekdays, but on the weekends and fridays many many more people check those sites
---
now get out there and make some caps!
---
There are probably people that would be caged up all day just to be sold to someone else, one of my friends is a very hardcore roleplayer, it is kind of scary how serious about role-playing he is, he would probably do that
---
I don’t care, yep that’s exactly the place! Been there since around level 20 lol 
---
I love using pre-existing structures too! Makes it feel like realistic to me. Never tired using a bus 🤔
---
Well, I know that I had done what the challenge required in survival.... the previous day.   So either it waited 20 hours to reward me, or it rewarded me for doing the same thing in adventure. 
---
Either way, it's truly fucked up in a way that's far beyond anything that Bethesda has ever done.
---
yep also happens by logging out , I don't think they were supposed to get 3 stars
---
unless you're in excavator armor all the time, gonna call bullshit on that backpackless carry weight
---
max level, that's a relief
---
What kind of Gat plasma?!
---
My son is 7 years old I’m 33, born in 86
---
Weapon weight on vanguard armor??
---
My bad
---
Odd, switched a new server to find less of a crowd and on that server the shop isn't open yet. How can it be open on one server and not the next?
---
...WHAT KIND IF HEAVIES?!
---
It's...
---
40% more power attack
---
Take 15% less damage while blocking
---
Health regen when you hit an enemy
---
Check the last inside the vault or use the search function here.
---
I got a Zealot's Wood Right Arm
---
With increased AP refresh and reduced damage while blocking...
---
I always accept invited and this happened to me one time so far, I just force close when they all started killing my camp.  I agree with most, I have met more good people than kids who wants to do kid things.
---
Ghoul+25%ffire+25% less vats
---
That Vamp Explosive shotty is a dream gun for me! Good rolls!
---
Game has an M rating, so none of the preferred targets allowed.
---
That's the one i want to go for aswell.
---
My first roll; 3* Executioner's Lever Action Rifle w/+50% limb damage and +50 aiming damage resistance! And I'm a rifle build!!!!!! The 3* Zealot's Western Revolver I got ain't bad either.
---
I also went in with 1,000 to start. The first weapon drop I got was a bloodied, vats and faster reload hunting rifle. Max level. So I said to myself wow pretty good. The second thing was a nocturnal tire iron. The following mix of ranged weapons and armor we're so so but not great. I also noticed it did favor heavy weapons. Specifically Auto grenade launchers for me. I got three. As well as a 50 cal
---
just to check.. but you PLACE the frames instead of dropping them right?
---
Went for all 3* weapons. Some garbage. A few decent things. But nothing worth writing home to mama about
---
Sounds like you need some more mutations!
---
Legendary 3 star ranged and melee weapons are 100 scrips each. Legendary 3 star armor is 60 per piece.
---
Plans! I bounce from vendor to vendor looking for plans and ammo...
---
Regardless duping items is not the solution, if the majority wants RNG raised then they should ask Bethesda for it. Bethesda has made a lot of changes based on player feedback. I'll respect the RNG regardless. I just want fair gameplay. Duplicating items is not fair gameplay.
---
Wait a sec, Is that a three star wood I see?
---
some spider out there that cant dance is looking for his missing left legs now
---
I think bloody and damage resistance? Bloody for sure but with my build it did almost 600 damage. I was only half health lmao. My fiance got upset that I logged on this early so I turned it off for breakfast. I'll jump back on in 30 and let you know!
---
Did you benefit or is it more items for script?
---
I’m thinking of trying to sell it, managed to snag the gattling from last weekly and that seems dope. Problem is i’m only level 40 and can’t equip either of them (minigun is only level 45 though, so hopefully not long)
---
Jup but can't be to frustrated or angry about it for long, because only a game.
---
And maybe rngesus will bless me some day.
---
Switched to a third and it's open with no one there. I thought there was a three star random choice? They removed that?
---
Na, was on the leather
---
There's a dead cat in the house at Wincing Homestead. That counts as a picture and it's always there. 
---
Alternatively, you can server hop at the overseers camp and random animals spawn there. Cats are in the spawn pool. You'll eventually get them. I suggest the first one though.
---
Awesome raider chest piece!
---
Just blew through all 1000 scrip. Not a single decent item. Can't say I'm surprised. What a garbage system.
---
2 Poons, gat plasma, fat man, cryo, 50 cal machine
---
ugh im sorry man
---
Have you been the fenced off metal bunker that's close by on the river? Only problem is a tick spawn inside, but it's a really cool place to build.
---
Also there's two train cars buried under a pylon, just south of Raleigh clays bunker. I had my camp there for ages.
---
If you on PS4 I can slap it on there for you. I can even sell you some prime cores. Nbd.
---
Purveyor is garbage
---
I'm 4th in line.
---
Wood piece will revert to a 1\* when you log out and log back in besides that one mint roll not bad
---
Yup. :/
---
Post this on  r/fo76Bazaar
---
Yes there was no maintenance time. She’s open!
---
I got a 3 star trouble shooters gamma gun.
---
i hear they sell those on etsy now
---
Yes, I think I will do the same thing.  My mindset going in is that I will trade my junk legendaries in hopes of getting a wanted combo.  If it is my wanted combo all the better but if not then at least something good enough that I can go on the trading reddit and trade for what I actually want the most.
---
It should have the same if not noticeably better drop rate than boss enemies
---
Shit wrong subreddit sorry
---
Hey, no biggy. Glad to get some of the hording space back to be honest. I was hoping for a \*little\* more control  over what you could choose to get, but once the mechanics were revealed, I knew the chances of getting anything decent were statistically remote.
---
3* wood lol and 3* urban scout! And that vampire double barrel is nice! 👍
---
I'm a rifle build as well, that's why I was so stoked on the BPR!
---
Ahh shucks I'm xb1. Gonna blow thru my 2 cores with it as I've never really or can't remember pulling the trigger lol.
---
Almost all going back to scrip, and a few for my vending machine. I'm not personally keeping any of it.
---
She’s open for business! 😄
---
Yeah I'm working on the general outline of the burrow from Harry Potter right now. I need the brick wall plans for the base and then various odds and ends. As a result it's just a 3 story murder house right now
---
Um i am just going to sit here and grab some popcorn and see how this plays out.
---
had around 21k on me. people werent buying my stuff for hours. then i heard that "ching ching". one dude was buying my stuff like crazy. "ching ching" had 25k.. "ching ching" again and again. panic. alt f4.
---
Ooo Urban Scout
---
for me the hunt is half the fun!
---
Thats awesome, my 1* can one shot level 91 deathclaws when I’m in sneak soo I can’t imagine what that can put out with some perks and effects added to the mix!
---
Yep. I was mostly clarifying the heavy gunner perks so people don't spend lots of points on them like I did. My prides and joy are my two Furious, Bash Damage guns. Bought both from the same guy and have never seen them elsewhere. Not gonna mention what I paid.
---
That's all people were talking about when waiting in line. That and all the typical "OK, but not really useful" stuff they were getting.
---
I did read your post. This has been going on for monthsssss. I haven’t seen them address it publicly nor fix the issue. They don’t give a shit about anything but making a buck. 
---
I’m just being honest, I don’t take PVP in this game seriously. If they wanted a true survival game they would remove the ability to use any Legendary stuff in PVP. Everyone has access to everything available in survival. Then it’s not who has god tier guns. It’s so little skill based right now. All the people just farming train stations and hitting the right trigger with a Power fist/death gauntlet because they blow at FPSs.
---
They have ***Just*** enough upvotes
---
Make me an offer (xb1).
---
Hmm no big loss then. Surprised you even noticed that piece missing.
---
That sucks. They need a way to prevent this lol
---
They removed the 3 star surprise item from her list. :(
---
I’m on now. I’ll send you a message
---
Word on the street is if you log out and back in it reverts to 1* and that if you Shroud it it turns to 1*.
---
I've had that one spawn, and a legendary lvl 60?? one just north of grafton, I have a pic. Imagine being a level 20 something going in to that area and meeting that thing. Luckily I was level 100+.
---
Sell that vamp shotty
---
But SBs aren't bosses, just tough mobs. If you hang out around Prime, they pop up every couple minutes. I could literally farm hundreds of legendaries with minimal ammo or effort of moving. My Prime AAE Gatling plasma shreds them in seconds....
---
Enjoy it brotha!
---
I’d bet that’s gonna be something special like once a week or month.
---
AA explosive pipe revolver with 90% reduced weight
---
If you had any spare adhesive I could take it off your hands maybe?
---
Not bad at all. Just going for ranged 2-stars, I got a Bloodied Cryolator with 25% Fire Rate, Bloodied Laser Pistol with 50% Crit dmg both at max level, but also 7 other 2-star ranged that are not so good.
---
not bad, not great about what is expected.
---
Searching for World
---
Crashes
---
Disconnected from server
---
I'll give it a few hours for everyone to roll there legendary dice, the servers must be steaming atm
---
Ha! It's a really fun weapon I have a whole build centered around Gatling Plasmas been stocking them up since BETA almost have a full quick select wheel lol
---
Wow this is BS.... I'll avoid armor untill it's fixed thanks for the heads up. I'm blowing through my scrip as soon as I leave work lol.
---
I gave up on trying to build a pretty house and built a 3 story maze instead at Whitespring. I get a lot of good feedback so people must like it.
---
Yeah that's just how she dug into the abandoned station, really cool detail!
---
Spawning, I totally agree with. The foxes were cute, but I'm tired of getting hung up on them. I kind of like when people leave the doors open, though. That's the only way I know people have been there! I don't have weapons or armor for sale, so I don't hang around.
---
20% reduction in weapons weight.
---
I have an extra camera I can set you up with. I'll be on in the next 2 hours, IGN?
---
Ehh I guess low levs could at least have a lil better chance of using the drops
---
holy crap
---
I wonder if it's scripted to give you something nice in your first transaction, that's a god tier weapon
---
While that is true, knowing the level still helps. The best solution: display the current level, and put that player's highest level behind that in brackets: **xYz-candyrain-zYx (5)(291)**. Can't be that hard, right?
---
*Vampires, explosive, reload speed DB shotgun*
---
**bazinga!**
---
No problem, glad to help.
---
aw I'm PC D:
---
Yeah I just had a Glowing Bloated do it to me. I need to capture a darn video of it. This is crazy
---
Is that new? I swear I've never picked up any legendary armor with that perk
---
So you have a super good weapon? I guess a low tier legendary wouldn't impact your play too much, then?
---
This needs to be applied to all things. I..e. if you die inside a building respawn me back into that building to avoid having to reload outside only to have me go back inside the building again and sit through another loading screen.
---
There is a lot of game time that is wasted on lengthy loading screens.
---
Neither, there is some pretty sweet flux right around there and the purveyor is still open for business, so unless you are on a super low level mule without a hazmat suit it really doesn't matter.
---
You should form a dance line troup!
---
I got a shovel lol. My next thing was a really good bloodied knife with swing speed and endurance tho.
---
Are u sure that u can trade it, i read it is not possible
---
It's about the same as getting something good from a regular legendary drop.
---
I just ignore most of the challenges. Guess ill just be buying less stuff from the atom store. I remember when I didn't even have to pay attention to them and I completed them through normal gameplay, those were the glory days.
---
Wow this game is truly versatile. I just couldn't do it XD but a while wheel, I guess you gotta go big or go home huh
---
My first roll was a Junkie's Baton that immediately went back into the chipper. MY second roll was a 2 star bloodied gatling laser with +33% VATS hit chance. I do run a bloodied build, but I've never fiddled with energy guns in this game so I'm not sure whether it's worth keepung, selling, or scrapping.
---
A legendary shovel?
---
At that level you should still be in the Flatwoods area. Visit every house, porch, mailbox, container and especially the Red Rocket there, you should have enough aluminum aster collecting and scrapping everything you can in the area.
---
Its honestly crazy, considering there's only one Purveyor.
---
if you are on ps4 id like to buy the vampires exploding shotgun for my brand new shot gun character, it will be a long time before he gets to lvl 50 but then he will be ready!
---
wilco
---
Wavy Willard's Water Park. The tourist will be laying up against a car when you walk in. If he is not there, server hop.
---
I have friends who play bloodied so I keep mine off to the side and powered by a switch, custommers are welcome to enter through the front door or from the garage in back.
---
Sounds like they are flooding market with explosives from posts i have seen.
---
Smart move really, everyone can get one now. (Everyone special, so noone special). Should get ppl to stop obsessing over them.
---
1,000,000 repeated requests everyday, this is actually a decent one. Go "bah humbug" somewhere else.
---
What's the cost? 100 script?
---
Spider man, spider man...
---
Literally the most anticipated option in the update, and they removed it with absolutely no notice to the community. This was supposed to do wonders for the scarcity of good 3* items on the PC markets.
---
I know the bunker you’re talking about; that’s not too far from me. It’s super cool but because of the ticks it makes me not want to although a turret would probably keep them cleaned up nice. 
---
I’m not familiar with the other location but I’ll def check it out! I doubt I’ll ever move my camp, I’m so attached to it now but I love thinking up new camps. Thanks dude!
---
"Status effect: You have pooped. -1 weight. +5 AP Regen."
---
you could spend it all at once.  ol girl dont care. i chose to only get 2 star weapons because the 3rd star is usually garbage anyway. i sold crap ones and then put the okay ones not for my build in my store. there were a few instigating ones and anti armor.
---
First shot off the bat I wanted a 3 star mellee. Accidentally hit 3 star gun and got an anti-armor explosive pipe bolt action. Not too bad
---
Ye, got some decent things anyway. Also 3* wood armor will turn to 1* after relog. Haha bughesta again in action
---
She opened up shop about 45 minutes ago (9am pacific).
---
Fingers crossed this one stays the course.
---
well crap, i guess you found the first bug with this new system
---
i was kinda hoping there wouldnt be any...
---
maybe /u/Valseek or  /u/Ladydevann could look into this?
---
Did you pick her mystery item, or guaranteed melee?
---
yeah but honestly i would have been surprised if it was any different
---
bad thing is the only "good" legendary i got out of the vendor (ts assaultron head with bad other effects) was a two star missing the two shot effect after the server went down
---
It is possible to trade cameras, I've loaned it out to friends for daily challenges. I have an extra...
---
Wow. Not a single thing I would keep. In the old days Wallace would just get stuff like this, I don't trade. I did give a 3* Unyielding bit away a couple of days ago. ;)
---
 Now I would recycle it. ;)
---
Pretty sure it will die down within a week but as long as people are polite to each other, i dont see a problem.
---
The vendor is new so everyone pilgers to her.
---
You can get legendary scout armour??
---
I've a hardened instigating doing 160 now but hopefully will get a bit more with .50 Cal. Didn't occur to me that I'd have to buy the plans I've scrapped so many!! A well... something to do if the legendary vendor is delayed....
---
Exactly i was suprised when i dint see it i mean the repair kits i under stand, but these heck we even buy them from a vendor?!

---
not best, but unique... Bloodied bone club with 50% limb damage, and take 15% less damage while blocking, the I got  a Vampire's shovel that reflects 50% melee damage while blocking, and +1 strenght
---
Maybe they could let more than one person interact with the trader? It’s not like that’s a new concept
---
Sounds to me they need the eso live equivalent but for 76. I love eso live because it feels personal getting to watch the devs have fun and talk about there game. I mean heck they were livstreaming one of em getting a game tattoo because the community reached a stream goal a bit back. xD
---
That's where they throw all the unhappy customers that asked for a refund because we got nothing but garbage for all 1,000 Scrip we traded in.
---
\*angry face\*
---
It was Commodo- the free version. Long since gone!
---
Cause who wants to play with our camps and vending right?
---
Gonna have to down vote this. AP demand makes it so people don't do the assinine bunny hop in engagements that you see in most fps's nowadays
---
Sweet thanks
---
i know but either way if it goes way off course we can just see how hard this crashes.
---
You don't need a nuke - just do Whitesprings and Uranium Fever when that's up.  Server hop Whitesprings, you'll be loaded up with scrap legendaries in no time at all.
---
Also I recommend you go to your junk tab, hit x snd go to the component view. Then select aluminium and mark it for search. Now all the junk items that have alu in them get marked with a small spyglas symbol.
---
Hahaha good luck getting anything out of Bethesda.
---
Bazooka!
---
Most of us will get maybe 1-2 good rolls, and the rest garbage. I feel like this will possibly give us each a couple gems or at least half-decent weapons to trade with others. HIT PLAYER VENDING every chance you get. Folks will be selling things and you'll never know WHAT you'll find.
---
Why level 1-15? Is there some kind of twinking in 76 I'm unaware of?
---
Bolton gardens by the fountain. Server hop until person spawns.
---
Love that as soon as he realised why you were there he could show you where the password was.  He's been where you are man. :)
---
Thx for the advice, i know the spawning points, but im tired of server hoppping for it
---
Luckyyyyy
---
Mine was a three star stalkers crossbow....got ten weapons...one of them is viable as something other then scrip. The best part was the 200 pounds I lost being able to feed the scrip machine again.
---
6k for the vamp shotgun
---
Ok, thank you.
---
Well maybe for you (and a lot of other people, this is a commonly reported bug) but all the dailies work correctly for me
---
Guaranteed melee, I only had just over 200 scrip so I did one 3* melee and one 3* ranged. The ranged seems decent, though! 😊
---
Ah well. Might just read em. I find the directional audio of the (unspellable) mag hunting perk tricky to use- even with decent 5.1 speakers somehow.
---
Your compensation is, it not disappearing instead!
---
Congrats!
---
Knee deep? Just make sure you are taking some rads from standing in the water
---
Vault that you find valentine in
---
Headshot is 2x, which I think is stacked multiplicatively with sneak, for 500+ damage in this case. The perforating magazine on the hunting rifle helps in other cases (it'd reduce the required damage to \~310), but you wouldn't need it for the sneak headshot.
---
Funny thing about suppressed headshots is that if you miss, it doesn't break your stealth, so it's daft to aim for the body when you're sneaking.
---
Water at the encryptid event counts, if that helps
---
That would end up in dupping :D
---
I did it in a little puddle in the Bog, didn't even cover my feet.
---
The recent patch made it impossible to trade or drop the camera as the note on the tourist starts the quest, not the camera.
---
If I were a super hero I’d be Super Jelly. Wow.
---
But I want the laundry sauce!
---
OP can you do a test for me and see if it's a display error. Equip the armor and see if you get +str still
---
Mama dolces, Morgantown . Yesterday my team got 160 raw colbalt each over there .
---
I got a 3* revolver (blah) and a 3* anti armor 10% damage while aiming reduced weight 10mm submachine gun so far
---
Awesome!  Found one in 2 seconds behind the building!  Thanks!!
---
Not very deep. I completed mine at the treetops location south of dolly sods.
---
NOICE
---
I think the most shocking thing is people waiting in line inside a video game
---
So the community has to suffer? Fuck Bethesda
---
Mystery Pick is removed apparently.
---
So it's not just me that wants this!?
---
I actually have a 3* Bloodied Board.  Far from the best mee weapon, but it does have an armor penetrating mod, so that's something.
---
Ffs... I just got 5 wood armor and everything reverted to 1*. Can nothing work in this game?
---
No word on those display cases they talked about earlier?
---
When starting a new character... Starting with pocketed leather, shielded vault tech suit, and lvl 1 legendary is the way to go. I sell these as kits.
---
 Is that the original Thanos story? Which goth chick is that?
---
They're the inevitable overlords of the wasteland. Doors are just the beginning of their nuclear evolution.
---
I remember finding one in silo alpha, its name is "broken prosnap deluxe camera"
---
But, I feel like they should be able to tag anything that’s duped and it gets grayed out when you play survival mode. Maybe some limitations on the weapons that you can bring over. 
---
What I’m talking about is a hardcore mode. No Vats, no legendary armor or weapons (everyone is wearing a jumpsuit), etc. You have a separate stash and the only thing on the line is caps which are shareable between adventure and survival. You can only use weapons and armor that you can craft at a bench. Each kill you get a set amount of caps and a few chems. You unlike plans to make armor and guns in Survival by killing other players/challenges.
---
Mutation: Squeezy Buns, You poop half as often and are much less likely to be detected while pooping, - 5 carry weight. Also changes the sound of passing gas to a high-pitched squeeker.
---
I wouldn't care even if it was better, I want to wear BOS combat armor.
---
Doesn't mean u won't collect a set of scout armor though.
---
3* Enemies should drop 3* loot regardless. If not then why not have a 1* be able to drop a 3* what’s the difference. This aggravated me a lot.
---
Guess there is a benefit to building in between West Tek and Camp Venture. People should know I'm not some low level selling generic plans and recipes. I'm sure some are disappointed expecting 28 "Armor" for sale, expecting legendaries, when im actually just selling BOS gear and other rare outfits.
---
I tried moving to a more High Traffic area but Im really set on the location. A great View and between Vault 76 and my Camp i have good fast travel options for that the whole map. I do hate having to fight off Level 50-60 mobs (usually Scorched, Some Muties, and a few cases of Albino Deathclaws) whenever i travel in or someone shows up to shop. Missile Turrets and Spotlight have helped though.
---
Last time we nuked Whitesprings, barely anything spawned, legendary or otherwise. Guessing that they broke the spawn rules in the last patch, so queens only for a bit.
---
Silos seem to be spawning far more robots now though. Quite fun now with a bloodied build.
---
We can try if you like ...may cameras are possible but not the pro snap deluxe? 
---
I will hop on soon ign komissar_plattfuss
---
Yes, I got one as well.
---
good old days !
---
Nah, hi rads and bloodied/full unyielding set with +strength +radicool+team perks...definitely doable. 
---
Anything else u/srsly_dang ?
---
I have:
---
Executioner PG
---
Medics PG
---
Vampire PG
---
TSE PG
---
Primed FE PG
---
AA PG
---
Zealot PG
---
Still looking for a couple others and some 3\* upgrades to the 1\* I have
---
Wait, how'd you get 25 rolls at 100/each with a cap of 1000 scrips?
---
I got mine pretty balanced between rifles melee and heavy cuz like what’s useful in perception besides rifleman lol... I got level 8 all rifleman I just swap for lockpock when needed. Also covert ops level 3 is awesome 2.5 sneak damage
---
You’re not scraping it back to her you’re scripting it back to the machine. And it does count to your 150 limit
---
Oh, that's kind of disappointing. I think the mystery pick would have been the most interesting option.
---
You need to walk the Divide, and have an end to things. After that you can have that portable rolled bed thing and Meal Ready to Eats.
---
Thx for that info, wasnt sure but read something like this
---
How much does it cost
---
No, I mean I read that there's a glitch and if you have so much weight overburdening you, you can place it for sale. It's a weird work around for the "You must destroy" message.
---
Hopefully someone from Bethesda will see, I just got an unyielding wood rad resist weapon reduction piece and am now afraid to even leave the server
---
Nah. You can always swim through the toxic water around my camp to get to the vending machine.
---
Just got my fifth one from a junk pile and got the badge.
---
Me too. Took me 7 jumps to find it. Only one spawns in a server at a time. And there's a dozen locations for it.
---
I was once a lookout for a couple of friends while they did a back-to-back in the middle of a back road intersection. We thought it would be funny to see the piles sitting there in days to come as we drove by, but an animal came and ate it within hours. The end.
---
Pretty sure the Grounded mutation helps with the pylons, too. My main (102) has Healing Factor and Grounded, and didn't die once in the event as a conduit. My alt (65) Has all the same mutations EXCEPT Grounded, and being the conduit killed her in about 15 seconds.
---
:O is it me?
---
We’re all pretty active. Just not all public.
---
Yea dude, it's reaching for expect a FULLY FUNCTIONAL FLAGSHIP GAME MODE when it's called survival BETA. But hey, ya know what stops it from being fully functional? THE DUPING. It's not fixed right? It would exist in this new closed system unless you fix it for the whole platform. "Yea but they wouldn't have legacy stuff!" Good job there ace, ya did it.
---
Multiple toons?
---
Fallout 3 is pretty damn fun but to me, New Vegas is one of the best examples of RPGs out there. Fun characters, awesome interactions, factions that have some sort of reasonable goal. Matthew Perry voicing a character you can bone down with, Felicia Day as a spunky lesbian with a fist of murder. Good times.
---
They....they're Learning !
---
Most of the grinders have multiple accounts. I think it's 5 characters total.
---
They ain't stupid people, they be junkies
---
Ah, good point. Maybe.
---
I'm guessing multiple characters that had max scrip
---
3 characters
---
So.....a bunch of crap and a 15-20k cap vamp explosive shitty. Not bad at all.
---
Having found them several times in the past, what exactly is the Legendary aspect of the "Auto Grenade Launcher"?
---
How much scrip did it cost each time? I'm level 23 and might try my luck with what little scrip I have when I get home in about an hour.
---
It certainly was. They removed it for the same stupid reason as all their other unnecessary nerfs. To make us grind.
---
I’ve noticed that too. So a a few days ago I said “f it”, and started dropping them myself. Starting to get food at it!
---
People are reporting that they bug back to 1* after a relog so... buyer beware... ⚡️
---
It's like that because of 2 reasons.
---
 #1 all these people running around with end game gear. At this point in the game nobody should have full sets of end game gear with the current RNG. I'm not sure if I could actually farm a hole set of BOS for my class in a years time, but factoring in trading items not for my class it still would be a difficult task to achieve in 6 months if items hadn't been duped and sold at lower prices.
---
#2 players get all the need junk aid and gear from adventure mode. So when they join survival they not needing or looking for items it just a Slug Fest
---
Imagine if we had a true survival mode with no dupers. Where nobody could join adventure mode. All junk aid gear must be farmed on survival mode. Players would be playing the game as it was inteded killing mobs, doing events, looking for drops while always looking over their shoulder for that other real player lurking around. That is real PvP that is real survival
---
You on PC and want to sell that lol?
---
This has happened to me once, but it was when I dropped something and picked it up with my mule.
---
What would it take for me to buy that off you? Just wondering.
---
First roll is a bloodied 10mm SMG 3*
---
I am seeing this shotgun with new eyes. I have max shotgun perks and explosives. I might just take this for a test drive before I sell her...
---
How do we post pictures of ours?  Mine is... well.... it'd be fun to think what people think of the thing that I... did.
---
Amarite!
---
big time less nuking, I haven't seen a nuke in days now.
---
So to clarify, If you purchase any armor piece at all, it reverts to one star? Can anyone clarify or be more specific?
---
It is weird. They should belong to us since we paid for them. Cool side note tho: You CAN sell/trade mainframe cores.  Always makes running a silo that much quicker.
---
speed demon or scaly skin
---
It worked for me around 7-8 pm in game time
---
The fastest way to get legendaries is the run Wes Tek and server hop.  Nuke zones are important for flux and material needed to stabilize it
---
Not gonna lie, i've tested a Bloodied Gamma Gun on ghouls and it does fairly well suprisingly
---
I dont like these concept, on the one hand they want to reduce the reasons for server hopping to improve the gameplay etc. on the other hand they create something, where lots of people are forced to server hop
---
Speed demon is great for melee when coupled with marsupial. You can get the high ground super fast and the overall increase in speed is great for traveling.
---
Quad crossbow
---
Yeah, the lag is it insane
---
r/woooosh
---
Healing factor
---
Which one did you try?
---
First time I tried it was like 4am, but second time it was 10pm. Both were at Hemlock holes.
---
It's Wood Armor, which doesn't normally drop with 3* in the first place, but is apparently part of the vendor's 3* drop list.
---
This would have taken 5 minutes to test ffs. I got five wood bits. Fun time.
---
Sounds about right. I'd hop on &amp; check it out, but I know me, work in 28 minutes would be quickly forgotten.
---
Was pretty tempted to call in sick or at least that's what this hangover demanded.
---
WE...DEMAND...ANSWERRRRRRRRRRS
---
Why not trade the things that don't fit your build with other people?
---
Your wet dream just became true. My problem is, that all mods are sold out on all servers. So yeah i have dope sentinel scout armor, but not single mod for it.
---
That's hilarious! I want one.
---
That would be great, but I wouldn’t hold your breath.
---
Speed Demon is commonly used.  Chameleon is very niche IMO.  There's a ton more to get before you go looking at Chameleon.
---
I would much rather be able to "Scrap" Legendary items so that I could put together my own custom one how I want it.  Even if you needed to scrap a bunch of them for each one you make.  I guess I just don't like gambling?
---
Maybe an option to have a fast travel rug snap to the front of a powered vending machine, the bottom of a set of stairs, or one side of a door when unlocked.  Then people using them will travel where you want them while minimizing the chances of them getting ported someplace "unintention" (good faith implied but not expected ;))
---
Capital building one
---
I'm switching to bloodied it's just taking a while aha
---
Cause they’re not locked 🤷🏽‍♂️
---
I had 600 scrip 
---
Got 6 weapons 
---
———-
---
2 auto grande launchers 
---
1 granade launcher 
---
1 submachine gun with a medic prefix 
---
3 other medic prefix weapons wth
---
You can find the BOS plans at the vendor in grafton, that's where I found mine. I have the plans for all parts. Is that what you're talking about?
---
I mean it is like a scratch off, it’s gambling.. but if you’re scrapping weapons you didn’t want that one either! It’ll come around, already seen some people get some awesome shit
---
If you mean 'hammered' as taking damage, the challenges work on corpses. Kill it at range and then take the picture up close.
---
Same here; I expected it though. It's most the same roll RNG that caused my junk accumulation (with the exception of what you can choose now and some new items).
---
Chameleon isn't usable with normal armor so probably not that one.
---
Speed demon is good, but will increase your food consumption so be prepared.
---
Scaly skin has little downside when paired with Class Freak. Good protection for smashy.
---
I'm sorry fo you. But you can get good items out of it. 4 out 6 were decent drops for me. took only 3\* then i thought ok, let's try one 2\* range: tse railway rifle. then i stopped, because i don't want to stretch my luck to much today. good luck for your next rolls.
---
Yeah, I suspect that 2* is where it's at, especially with weapons.
---
Although I think swing speed is a tertiary effect, isn't it?
---
I literally don't think I ever scrapped these I got nothing learned xl
---
yeah, its kinda "open". it would be nice if it was at least "heavy armor\*3" "heavy weapon\*3" "rifle 3\*"
---
But the contribution to humanity lives on!
---
I never knew that, Thanks
---
I've had some good luck trading with nice people, and I basically gave away a TSE Handmade that was great for my previous build setup (traded it for 20 Nuka Coloas :P ).
---
But, trading is kind of a pain usually.
---
Yep. Dropped five (!) 3* bits that are all 1* now. Nice job testing this out. I’m not salty at all
---
Next to poseidon poweplant is some corridor, dryed river or the fuck it is, it have guarantee spawn 10lvl grafton bitch. Just wait till it is dark and shoot that ugly motherfucker.
---
Thats why I had been stocking up!  Deep pockets for daaaaaaaays but I only thought to get 5 1 for each piece, I should have kept going and charged a ton for them...
---
for you, maybe. I know empathy is not your forte based off these posts, but loots vanishing from your inventory in *looter*-shooter is ludicrous.
---
even a piece of spoiled meat would be too much. it shows Bethesda can't code a server properly. what if it was something more important? a legacy weapon, maybe?
---
Everything I got from her was level 45-50.
---
Well the prices vary, 30 50 60 100 I think. So your little will still do
---
Life imitating art, or art imitating life?
---
Good for you.  I've been trying for 20 levels to get that sword.
---
Not very deep at all, too deep and you won't be able to revive. Also make sure you don't do too much damage to the other player if you're downing them for a revive or they may not get the call for help option, fists will do fine
---
hey wouldnt you want to bang a hot goth chick though
---
Vamp effect is a flat percentage of hp per hit. On a shotgun, that is per pellet hit. So vamp is extremely powerful on a shotgun. Need health ...shoot something.
---
I run a vamp handmade like a bloodied build. I run my hp down to 20% and then just kill stuff to maintain my health at 20%. Never use a stimpack in combat.
---
That’s great to know! Thanks everyone!
---
I picked up an explosive combat rifle which was pretty cool but other than that it was mostly junk. Legendary farming at Whitesprings is not dead,  let the nukes fly!
---
What do you mean by crap ? I just spend over 1100 and got some ok stuff, not god like weapons but with the ratio i felt i got good deal well i only tried ranged weapons and armor in 3* each.
---
Always max level I think. Took a level 6 alt and got max levels
---
I got literal trashes, wtf is nocturnal shovel? And it grants 1 endurance?
---
It's a chance of getting a 3* drop. There's a growing sense of entitlement going on in the FO community.   You had a bad roll, get over it. 
---
You go to an event where there's 1 legendary boss and expect a guaranteed 3* drop? Seriously where's people's common sense. If you want better odds of getting 3* drops, nuke White Springs or The Burrows. Guess what happens when you're in a zone where there's multiple 3* enemies...
---
Reminds me of a line from The Incredibles, "everyone can be super, and when everyone is super... no one will be"
---
Someone did the math in another thread and it basically shat all over the numbers. It's better off ALWAYS going for the mystery pick rather than a regular one. 
---
So BGS probably picked up on this and scrapped that idea.
---
Just because you see a screenshot of something **in development** doesn't mean it's going to be implemented in the final patch.
---
I got some decent stuff tbh. 2 sentinel pieces one with ap refresh and one with strength a furious pipe pistol with 2 vats perks and a vampires flamer with ffr abs limb damage.
---
MYSTERY LOOT
---
🦀🦀🦀🦀🦀🦀🦀🦀🦀
---
IS GONE
---
I also got a Gatling Plasma, Broadsider and 2 Shotguns. Hmmmm.... Get anything else good?
---
At least not count items you just got from the vendor towards that limit, maybe?
---
Holy crap. I just modded it to the max. With just damage perks (no adeline, nerd, chems etc) it's doing 364 base damage and reloads so fast!!
---
I would actually sell it, but I'm on the Playstaion. Sorry
---
I currently have:  
---
Chameleon\* - only good for random stealth occasions/more for fun
---
Electrically Charged\* - doesn't do much but some light stagger is nice
---
Grounded \*\*\*
---
Carnivore \*\* - I use with Cannibal and Glowing meat steak for melee so its amazing
---
Marsupial\*\*\*
---
Scaly Skin\*\*
---
Speed Demon\*\* -hunger/thirst increase is negligible 
---
Talons \*\*\* -only for unarmed build
---
Twisted Muscles\*\*\*
---
Unstable Isotope\* - fun with a sliver of added damage
---
Plague Walker\* - fun with a sliver of added damage
---
and debating on Healing Factor but not sure if I want to lose the healing from stimpacks.  
---
Essentially if you are willing to use 2 or 3 points in Class Freak Luck perk get as many as you find useful.
---
Be happy you didn’t end up with five 3* wood pieces that reverted to 1* upon logging back in. Ffs, this game sometimes
---
I’ve been scrapping every one star armor piece I’ve found and am up to 584 scrip. No regrets because that stuff would’ve been trash regardless.
---
The mods are there. I went with 12 ranged three \*. 3 of them are sell able, one was exploding.
---
Just because someone did the math doesn't mean BGS has the right to pull it. They advertised it would be in-game via their inside the vault.
---
Here's a pic
---
Seeing inside my face?! https://imgur.com/a/eDQcTWP
---
the purveyor *is* Bethesda's response. it shows they have no interest in improving the RNG because, well, there's no real end game. we're only farming for the sake of farming more efficiently.
---
Legendary Pipe Revolver, is that a new legendary as well?  You considering selling that or trading for some other 40 scrip 3 star I own to break instead?
---
May I suggest you drop one then? 👍😂
---
I was accumulating and waiting for player vending.
---
Now buying plans mainly.   Hoping for reasonable prices on legendary weapons.
---
Server hop?
---
I didnt get anything that wasnt max level...of thats what u mean
---
That's a valuable piece.... Hopefully they can revert them back to 3* again.
---
No one taught roaches manners
---
You have to manually inspect the weapon to see the other perks. It's a bug since beta
---
My build allows me to use every weapon at max rank except pistols and I can go 7 for 9 there.  I also have all the defensive perks.  If I could one or two button swap instead of spending 30 seconds doing so I could do everything on the fly and negate the need to run specs for things.  It really would be game breaking.
---
If this was a single player game who cares but they are trying to promote a multi player game where people have a role.  I mean you no offense but your mod negates that and it's like the only reason I'm glad I went PS4 over PC for this game.
---
Wah
---
5 toons with around 700 scrip a piece. Just did my last toon and got another decent roll.
---
I was going to buy 5 special picks but it wasnt there so i bought 4 fucking trashes (melee 3*)
---
No lol, I'm talking about actually finding like a hole set of 3 star heavy combat armor with the legendary stats you seek that complements you play or build style that you turn into BOS aswell as your end game weapons. I'm lvl 200 I've spent a lot of time farming I've did get a 3 Star BOS chest droped to me and a couple marine pieces that was assassins cavalier the other 2 pieces I of assassins sentinel marine I got in a trade and it wasn't cheap.
---
I've dropped 3 in the last week on Prime and participated in 3 or 4 others. All with Queen kills. 
---
The answer for less nukes dropping is to drop more of them yourself! It worked for me. 👍
---
I have them unlocked because the game isn't letting me lock them.
---
No offence meant but we were never promised good gear, throw in the fact that it is literally a lottery and I cant see why anyone would be surprised at losing 99.9% of the time
---
my buddy lvl 3 bought an item it was max level
---
So you can still acquire non-wood legendary armor pieces without issue?
---
I would trade that for any equivalent scripped weapon.
---
Ah of course, I keep forgetting that!
---
I have all except for the group one lv201 now mutated since lv 50:))
---
Tell me about it, I’ve got my photo proof not that they ever care about that 😂
---
Bc all enemies share the same AI apparently lmao
---
Wanna sell it? :-)
---
Yeah, I will try that one, thanks!
---
I'm lucky I already have a decent set of gear.  I was hoping to maybe get just 1 really cool thing that would fit my build out of the 1,000 Scrip I had to spend.  
---
I think the choice is ***TOO*** random?  I wish you could narrow the type of item down a little further when you choose.  Like you look at the item, and you could glean some info about it, just not know exactly what it is, before you buy it?
---
The mystery pack was missing the flag that prevents energy weapons from getting the Explosive effect. It'll most likely be added on Tuesday when that bug will be fixed.
---
ok.
---
While he's AFK?  Lay land mines all around him.  If he's AFK he won't hear them being placed, and as soon as he moves away from the vendor ... BOOOOM!!!!!
---
Phew.  You really set me straight with that one buddy!  Must be feeling pretty good about yourself right now ace.
---
The legendary turn in machine is literally a cobbled together slot machine... this was foreshadowing to the losing proposition.
---
So i can make infinite amound of alts (delete them after they are on cooldown with with scrips and make fresh one) and get 50lvl gear?
---
If you're on PC I'll be all over that Vamp Flamer if you want to trade?
---
Bird bones? I run a instil vats build and got marsupial before just for the jump ability, the str was a bonus. Though now we have backpacks the str doesn’t really count for much. So I’m planning on getting bird bones as the -4 str will just counteract the +4 from marsupial. Then I’ll have a high jump with a slow descent, plus additional AP, vats shots and better sneak. It should work out nicely as a combination
---
👍🏼
---
Yes which i do i have 3 key cards and 45 mainframe cores so there enough available to fo all 3 silos!
---
Last time I dropped a nuke on prime about half way through loads of people started leaving and I don't know why, but it put me off a bit.
---
I had my camp there for a bit. Now I'm at the ruined houses east of Camp Venture.
---
Pretty sure I have one on PC I would sell you. How much?
---
Please fix bugged ‘find location’ challenges for Grafton Dam, Valley Galleria, etc.  It would also be great if a couple more Scout challenges could be attainable by solo players without functioning headsets.
---
I don’t have much else to complain about that isn’t based on my own incompetencies (working w/ specialized character builds, etc), and have generally been having a great time.  I’m just not a power player, and have limited time to play. Challenges take multiple sessions to complete, and it’s very disappointing for that effort to be fruitless when I’m not looking for anything more substantial than quest completion.
---
And in the exact spot 20 little tiny white dots are congregated.
---
Wait, can that happen?  
---
I say that's worth opening a support ticket over, and I hope they would do something (but expect they won't).
---
Definitely a raider
---
A boxing glove. Scout armor and a bunch of other shit I didn’t even care enough about to remember. 
---
Seriously Bethesda, more refinement on the selections. Ie two handed melee, heavy ranged...
---
Wait, they fixed the ”no legendary scout armor”-issue?
---
I get them as rewards enough to scrap for mods and use my buddies for the rest. They know I want them even if they are 1\*
---
I won't lie...I'm really pleased. I spent all my scrip on 3⭐️ armour and I got some beauties.
---
Max level cavaliers unyielding robot chest. 
---
Max level auto stim forest scout chest piece with rad resist and ammo weight reduction
---
Max level vanguards forest scout chest piece with +1 agility and 50% more durability 
---
Level 45 Sentinel unyielding marine armour left leg with + 1 charisma
---
Max level auto stim urban scout armour left arm with +1 luck and ability to breathe underwater 
---
Max level Bolstering Urban scout chest piece with +1 END and 50% more durability
---
Max level Chameleon Forest scout armour right leg with +1 charisma and 20% junk weight reduction
---
Max level Sentinel Ghoul slayer Forest scout armour left leg with +1 luck 
---
Max level Sentinel BOS life saving left leg with +1 strength
---
I'm very pleased....
---
gotcha! thanks for the reply anyway
---
I agree, player bartering is a nightmare for me but I'm hoping that giving every 3 star some inherent value will change that a bit.
---
That said when you say nothing you get was useful to you, i imagine a really good heavy gun or pistol, where you're just looking for rifles.
---
Shhhh! Don't let them know! Or it will get fixed.
---
They've been hella unstable since this last patch, daily crashes if not more
---
Speed Demon, Unstable Isotope, Carnivore, Electrical Charge
---
I guess - I just wasn't quite thinking how bad my odds were - it was new, exciting, and I was full of hope.  
---
I suppose really, that less than 1 in 100 Legendary Drops is something most characters would even find worth keeping, once  you're over level 40 or 50 or so...
---
3 star must be min level 45 because i’m only 40
---
They weren't kidding when they said Arktos was one of the prettier dungeons.
---
Oh I dunno, wouldn't pay much mostly would just want to play around with it. Maybe trade something?
---
maybe this could reduce all the paranormal phenomena episodes that we experiment at the entrance of the resort (deja-vus, invisible robots, phantom items...)
---
I was joking about that with my bud earlier. I would nuke and rush in with my rad suit to get first dibs if I wasn't at work lol. Probably wouldn't actually do it tho. Don't want to crash the already busy servers.
---
Wait til later today there will be a youtube video nuking the purveyor.
---
Cool!  There's bound to be some people getting good stuff!
---
Shit. You got lucky. 
---
It was a clusterfuck when I just went. 
---
Got stuck behind someone that somehow took 10 min to choose from like 6 options. 
---
Got a pretty good roll though. Anti-armor explosive bolt action sniper.
---
Well it would only be our fellow 76ers, so not going to fly there.
---
If wasterlander content adds human NPCs back, invading our fair home from...the wasteland... I’m pretty much going to shoot on sight so I guess that’s a no for that too.
---
 Head to the official forums to let us know what Fallout 76-related topics you’re most interested in reading about in future editions of Inside the Vault. 
---
I love how we all are ignoring this part....
---
I got a shovel bone club and bone hammer I want a chainsaw
---
Happens. Seems to mostly be an issue with SB. My suspicion is that there’s a little bit of lag, and weird issues with hitboxes, and a delay between “impact” and “explosion going off”. Which gives the flying SB enough time to move it’s weird hitbox completely out of range of the explosion because of how fast they move in the air. 
---
I could be totally wrong, but I’ve noticed the same thing about moving vs not moving (and it’s not consistent- I’ve had some epic shots where a SB is flying straight at me for a gas strafing run, and I nail him in the face with a missile for the kill, and he plows into the ground behind me) and that’s all I could come up with.
---
Weird. I can't say I've seen that behavior before, unless it's to chase the bitch down! 
---
Either way, I wouldn't let that stop you from doing a silo run. I know a lot of folks like to zip through them but if you slow down a bit you can gather awesome levels of loot/mats
---
It was missing the flag that prevents energy weapons from getting the Explosive effect.
---
I never understood the benefit to Chameleon serums, what does it do to be more beneficial than a single piece of chameleon armor?
---
Rivers in whitesprings work. Pull ghouls have them down you in water, revive ect
---
melee weapons have given me meh so far, but i did get 2 urban scout pieces 3 star and a nice marine combat 3 star, and then like 3 badly rolled leather pieces so seems like the rng isn't that terrible.
---
PS4 mate :( I did a little run around watoga 5 mins ago it was a beast
---
Honestly, I've gotten to the point where if I'm just sinking a ton of ammo in and barely anything is happening I just leave.
---
The work-reward ratio for SBQ isn't always worth it.
---
I think that's a clear indicator that she needs some balancing. Either less life or a better guarantee of drops.
---
Got a medics 3* ultracite Gatling laser and a suppressors 3* pipe revolver, think both didn’t have the ability to be legendary before the release.
---
Swimming athlete and archery are the easiest imo
---
good for you !
---
I plan on putting whatever legendaries I get from Purveyor that I dont want in my vending station.
---
the mamma one ain’t bad but swimming can be fast if you knock the revive part out with someone in shallow water that you can stand in but not be submerged
---
God damn this sub is funny today
---
👍   
---
I tried to shoot her, did nothing.
---
I have only gotten four or five 3* items from whitesprings and only the powerfist was worth keeping.
---
Well, if that's the case, that'd be acceptable. If it's outright gone forever because BGS thinks we should have to grind more, then I'm honestly uninstalling and getting a refund on my last atoms purchase. Hoping to here from Valseek or LadyDevAnn in regards to this matter.
---
Mystery pick isn't even available, it was probably removed once we realized that it's always the most efficient in terms of legendaries per scrip
---
I got 3 troubleshooters pistols, hunters auto grenade launcher, instigating revolver, instigating Tesla, vampire revolver, instigating pipe revolver.. if nothing else at least it made me laugh! 😂
---
Kinda surprised this isn't a thing yet.
---
Kinky
---
Nope its secondary, so definitely worth going for 2-star melee if you really want swing speed.
---
That’s it, I’m not expecting anything amazing but sone good stuff we can use for trading is always appreciated:)
---
Always max, went there with a level 2 character
---
Speak for yourself.  Grinding is not fun.
---
want poster.
---
It's cool mate! Got a few pages of a notebook full of buildings and locations lol.
---
dang… so no way to get 3 stars items with a level 15 character? :(
---
So one of the objectives for swimming is to revive someone in the water? Sucks because all of my friends who used to play doesnt play anymore lol
---
omg lol
---
Bugged, apparently. They revert to 1* when you log out and back in.
---
ah if thats true then i see why they had to disable it for the moment
---
How I am with those LARs double, quad, ts, exp, you name it lol
---
Yep. I dropped a 3* unyielding wood bit with WWR that I was really excited about. I don’t expect there is anything they can/will do either. I remember the roll for one, but not the others.
---
This is true, the upside is that when/if you do get something good it will be more exciting than if we had them thrown at us every time we gamble
---
And there's no FLIPPING Mystery Pick anymore.
---
I was stealth/rifle focused until about level 150.
---
Now I've changed to the "Glass Canon" low health "Bloodied" "Unarmed" melee weapon build, using a full set of "Unyielding" armor.
---
I tried for a couple armors, and the rest Melee weapons.  I might have tried for 1 ranged, don't remember.
---
What does "B25" mean in the "B25 .50 cal"? I tried googling it but only found few references but no mention what that is.
---
I figured archery would be easy, killing 50 enemies wouldn't take that long.
---
no I spent over 600 leg scrip and got things i would leave on the ground. TRASH Wasted effort. TRASH is ALL THEY GIVE!! trash trash
---
Herbavore/carnivore(cant have both), healing factor, grounded, bird bones (and speed demon for extra long jumps combined with marsupial)
---
How I feel with the lightbulb set that you can barely read ....
---
Well if you havent noticed its not keeping people around. Most players quit a lomg time ago.
---
I honestly just call any interior space in these games a "dungeon," in contrast to something in the overworld.
---
What system are you on? I have a low level character I can help you out with.
---
Congrats on your draw at the purveyor though :)
---
Assume the position.
---
cracked multiple?
---
I'm a murder hobo, but I'm not a sadist.  Bigger jar or smaller frog please!
---
I  just got 1 explosive weapon from my next 10 rolls (on another build), a mutant slayers explosive pipe pistol. Not really what I wanted, but I can still use it West Tek :)
---
I don't either - I believe it doesn't make that sound that Chameleon armor makes though.  Other than that its mostly a liability to me.
---
Jump all the spawn points? I had the camera on 2 characters without jumping, it was fast too. [https://i.imgur.com/X4ecqTS.png](https://i.imgur.com/X4ecqTS.png)
---
Want any troubleshooters pistols? I got 3! 😂😂😂
---
Isn't the bone club already bloodied? So it's bloody bloodied?
---
It's funny because it's a bunch of digital code, but I feel the same. Why not just bind him to your base instead and he can run around your build area?
---
If that's the case, I'm uninstalling and getting a refund on my last thing of atoms.
---
Can’t, not in the pool
---
IMHO, the SBQ is just an excuse to run the silo. I feel like I always get better drops making the SBQ happen then by killing her.
---
I love jt.
---
I had a feeling it was a flamer, I keep trying to find a viable energy weapon other than explosive laser rifles because I’ve played since B.e.t.a and havent seen even a legendary laser rifle other than one level 1 lol
---
I thought that Instigating would be good, but in practice it felt really garbage when I tried it.  
---
I think I want some kind of Bloodied Explosive weapon, perhaps.  
---
Or some "Unarmed" Melee weapon with increased swing speed.
---
A Bloodied Rifle with higher ammo, more damage while aiming, or take reduced damage while aiming would be cool.
---
One piece of 3 star Unyielding armor would be nice.
---
I'm not even hoping for Sentinal Assasin or whatever the "meta" is for PVP at this point, maybe some day...
---
We walked up hill, both ways through a radstorm with a molerat brood mother latched onto my ankle the whole way!
---
Ah that's a good idea, I'll do this one this evening.
---
One day farming whitespring = tones of godrollz now. Atleast for people who have 2x PS4 in living room :D
---
Cheers :)
---
☹️
---
I second this, someone had one on display in front of their camp, I attacked it hoping to break the little fella free
---
 All indication are everything levels to buyer. **Wood Armor 2 stars or higher may be glitchy and revert to single star**. Purchasing armor for this reason may be risky.
---
Well, not to be argumentative,  but you said you hadn't seen one in days, not that you hadn't seen anyone else drop one. 
---
Nevertheless,  the solution is the same, go do an Alpha, Bravo, Charlie trifecta!
---
!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
---
Are you on PC and if so will you sell me the explosive executioner pipe revolver?
---
I agree! It’s so sad
---
Here's the thing about game engines... They're programs that can be updated with new features. 
---
But this issue likely has more to do with server infrastructure than engine limitations. 
---
Either way, they've stated that instancing is something that they're working on at the [Bethesda Game Days panel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zIQaXj8h6o).
---
What format you on? I've still to do it, Xbox.
---
People could troll now if they wanted to.. they can figure out exactly where players spawn- here's the thing though, it's 100% more likely that if you troll someone, they won't buy your stuff.
---
So basically with all the PvP nerfs and people actually wanting to make money, it's highly unlikely anyone is going to troll anyone else.. and mats would be much more helpful for those who don't know how to plan their build effectively.
---
I placed my camp knowing that I would build my foundations low enough they can't get stuck, built my base around them with my vendors literally right in front of them when they spawn. But that's because I built around the vendors, and my sales are proof!
---
Legendary legendary Vendor!!!!!!!
---
I’m sorry to say this but I thought this was fortnite
---
Burn him , burn him, burn I mean free him , free him free him
---
900 lbs is 408.6 kg
---
I’m as high as an arsonist at a weed farm
---
Shoulda used the BoS statue as the knight...
---
Did 3 stars harpoon gun existed before ?
---
well the title said people nuking, I wouldn't refer to myself as people so i'm just simply stating I haven't seen a nuke in weeks in relation to the thread talking about other people dropping it.
---
Depends it you bloodied head of enemy by bloody bloodied club.
---
I just wish my perception showed me ANY enmities before they are two feet in front of me.
---
Xb1, sorry.
---
It sounds good, but I’m still hesitant to believe this will be true end game content. The game badly needs to bump up the difficulty, even if it’s just a few remote areas that scale higher for high level players. Hopefully Nuclear Winter will being some love outside the forest(beginner area)!
---
Ya Bethesda isn’t giving away anything for free.
---
O
---
&gt;Can't be that hard, right?
---
Remember that you are talking about Fallout 76. The fact that this game works at all amazes me every day.
---
Agree if theres 3 star forest scout armor i want it.
---
Ah I'm on ps4
---
Another wonderfully unbroken update from BGS 👍🏾
---
Damn, I forgot about the ultracite gatling laser. I was just hoping for an instigating and/or explosive pipe revolver.
---
There needs to be an option for both if they decide to do this.
---
I agree, liability to forfeit primary armor traits because it requires "weightless" armor.
---
To clarify, are these items coming from the purveyor or 3\*'s that existed previously? I just bought all armor from the purveyor and did not receive any wood or leather. Either way, it's ridiculous
---
If your still on in an hour or two I'll help you do the revive.
---
Because of course they do.
---
Both of those are fun.  First on your block to own them, I bet.
---
I hear ya.
---
Try dying?  Seriously. There is a glitch where your skeleton shows through your body, and dying seems to be the only solution to that one.
---
I still think it's a great idea just gives another chance at something decent rather then feeling bad you're vendoring a legendary for a few caps
---
I won't be on for a few hours, I get off work at 4pm eastern. But if you could youd be my saint lol
---
Extra kinky
---
This weeks launch codes
---
The whole premise of this game is dragging people alone chasing something they never get. Dude I’ve got almost 300 hours of gameplay. I got sick of watching everyone else run around with awesome guns. I told myself I wouldn’t ever buy anything on the private market I would find all of my stuff. Well, I got over that. 
---
On top of this the game is incredibly buggy. The people who made this game don’t have a good moral compass anymore. Bethesda doesn’t care. I mean it’s noble your perspective on this game but unfortunately TIL Survival has been tainted. It takes them sooooo long to fix this stuff. 
---
As soon as another game I like comes out or Halo Infinite is here my ass is jumping ship. It was a very bittersweet experience.
---
I'm just keeping it around until they fix the broken objective.  The whole thing is kind of ghoulish... but then, I have the same impression of all the mounted taxidermy too.  And the opossum hat.  Really not my thing.
---
Np :)
---
Not all, i will try that
---
It’s what I wanted too
---
I have 38 kits, have used 3, tell me more.
---
The Purveyor is intended to give items that are immediately usable by whoever bought them. So your buddy should have received an item that was closer to their level. Thanks for the report, we'll look into it!
---
Nice try Todd
---
Repair without a bench can be pretty handy.
---
Thanks anyway though, really appreciate it
---
You must think in Russian.

---
Yeah, I'm thinking the same thing about the hitbox. So if the scorchbeast was hovering like a hummingbird, I could get some decent damage on him, but if he was moving the missile would explode and he takes significantly less damage. But I also noticed same as you when he's flying toward me I get the most damage must have something to do with the area effect of the explosion counting damage on him as he flies through it vs away from it. But they also usually land shortly after a volley of missiles.
---
Bloodied + 25% fire rate
---
Iirc 100 scrip for 3 star armor, melee, or ranged as well as the 3 star mystery pick
---
It is unfortunate if you lost an item that you actually farmed.  Especially if it was a legacy item. But I honestly don't know anyone that just had items vanish from inventory or stash box. I've only heard about duped items being removed. Bethesda absolutely should have a system in place to track items but with that comes a lot of extra tech support that typically ive only seen with pay to win games or subscription based.
---
Server disconnects are in the drop table for legendaries... You didn't know that?
---
Based on what happened to me and a few of my friends it seems it does have a high probability of giving you something good on your first go more so than the rest. But that just maybe rng tricking me.
---
Yeah that's why I kept it until I got something a bit better. Its not a bad gun really, it was fun to play with. For trades, I really don't have want for much. But I'll hook up with you later and we can work something out I'm sure.
---
We're looking into reports of this occurring, thanks for bringing it to our attention!
---
Got a Bloodied FFR Combat Shotgun w/+1agi. Assassins FR Harpoon with vats crit dmg, A TSE western revolver with vats crit fill. This was out of 10 3* ranged weapons.
---
I want to know lines names with price at 100

Yup, that BBQ at Morgantown Airport AND if you trigger the cargo bot event you can take a picture of the cargo bot also, it identifies in the viewfinder and works yay.

heavy rocket is learnable? its just rng based. heres the reddit post with all the mods in the [Game](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/a5pbsr/every_weapon_mods_learn_chance/)

Sometimes grenades or strikes seem to help get her to move when she sits and hovers. Mini nukes are good for mob clearing. But dear god yes stay off of structures.
---
Gimme that fan i need screws
---
Badly implemented cyrillic
---
ding ding ding ding.
---
And good point, we don't see anything behind the scenes.  Most people probably don't think there's that much going on back there.  Or maybe they're all making the decisions, and you're the fall guy for all the hate ;-)
---
The point is (not that it matters), YOU I've seen doing things, not so much anyone else.  But, that's my optic alone, and I certainly don't study the situation all that closely :P
---
It'll be a gamble.
---
The ultimate pvp weapon... but it only works on you :(
---
All over really several places have them and then a friend just confirmed you find the hides in junk piles like the ones you put extractors on
---
imagine fighting someone who is a strong VATS users that has marsupial and lead champagne, the cost is there to stop VATS users being much harder to hit AND getting auto aim.
---
Not yet, still a lot of fixing to do, probably around next November
---
oh no doubt. i've noticed recently that i'll be in "danger" but it doesnt show where the enemy is until i have line of sight.
---
I would be fine with that explanation but the door opened towards the radroaches, not towards me.
---
see if it suffers the same fate as wood armor and when you log out the stars go bye bye.
---
4 shots? Or 4 arrows in a "mag" ?
---
I’ve scrapped every super sledge I’ve found since the game has come out and I’ve never learned it, heavy rocket is the mod that comes on all rise
---
3* server disconnect. Sooooo common.
---
Or u could just put ur GT in the post so anyone can join..
---
Haha you fun sucker. Where is your since of adventure. I actually agree to some point. Killing the queen gets old. It's fun when you finally get a cool drop
---
It did 1188 damage in FO3
---
Bloodied melee probably with a sick gauntlet or power fist or sledge or axe. My bloodied teammates have killed her in under two minutes flat.
---
Yes.
---
Thing is though, the game doesn’t know what legendary attributes are valuable to you.
---
What you may consider a shitty drop may be perfect for someone else regardless of Luck
---
I've got over 800 hours, and it's safe to say, for me at least.. doing anything but white springs seems more likely to spawn 3* legendary enemies with higher chance of 3* drops. White springs really only seems to be good for 1* or no star legendary enemies, always garbage.
---
In all my time playing I doubt I've even gotten that many 2*+ drops at White springs.
---
The person who fails at reading comprehension is you. And once again you show you ignorance of computers- did I say software? No I didn't think so
---
Don't like the game? cool, don't play and glad that even if I do, I won't see your ignorant obstinate existence in the wastes- 
---
You are a waste of breath
---
I plan on nuking Berkeley Springs tonight just for convenience. That way people don't have to go far.
---
So I just logged in and there's nothing telling me that this vendor exists or where to go, has so ething gone wrong or is it just Bethesda not implementing things properly again?
---
Oh ok cool, just saw that. I'll shoot you a message when I log on today
---
No problem! ;)
---
This right here. I got that glitch a while back and was searching for answers. You have to die and actually respawn to fix it. It happens when the game thinks you died but did not actually die.
---
Oh really? That's hilarious lol.

CHAD: A FALLOUT 76 STORY  
---
Episode 1 origins: the first journal entry
---
Appalachia, Day 42:  
---
74F, sunny and clear. After finding toilet paper at the Super Duper Mart, I returned to my camp only to discover a stranger had made himself comfortable at my home. After a moment’s confusion, I realized it was Chad from the Vault. After a brief chin wag recalling "good times" at 76, he asked me for some purified water and dog food. Being neighborly, I happily shared what meager resources I had and he went on his way.
---
Appalachia, Day 43:  
---
64F, rainy. Chad returned to camp today, after setting up a tent nearby. I was attempting to build a port-o-potty and kept hitting my thumb with a hammer as he rambled on about molerats. Asked to “borrow” some stimpacks. I told him I only had 3 and gave him 1 (I have 18). He then said he had somewhere to be.
---
Appalachia, Day 44:  
---
78F, whatever. Woke up to Chad grinding away at my armor station. Helped himself to some of my leftover dog food. Proceeded to get drunk and thought it would be funny to climb on my power armor. I went a short distance away and vented my growing frustration by shooting some trees.
---
Appalachia, Day 45.  
---
I shot Chad in the face. Great weather today.
---
spent 700\~ scrip, got nothing good. going to take like a week just to sell those things - nevermind all the new legendaries i'll be picking up. considering thinking taking a break and just sell legendaris every day for a bit - i had the misfortune of getting heavy guns, so they all weigh above 20lb, filling up my stash. not to mention the already hoarded amount of legendaries.
---
That shotgun damn it's sexy. And a TSE revolver damn..... I hope she's kind to me when I get out of work
---
Do you mean frame drum?
---
Or a 3 point one in perception that highlighted either normal corpses or legendary ones. (Point value can vary)
---
My wife yelled at me for being so cruel to the froggo. I told her it was for a quest and I can’t really free it anymore or I’d be forced to kill it. There’s no winning here, Pls Bethesda let me give it a bigger home.
---
I need those screws...
---
Protect.  AND.  Murghhh
---
Confession: I was also quite upset... after I bought the plan! I was hoping for a flute or a whistle... and I got a tuba.
---
Will you be on this evening?
---
I'm in the exact same position myself.  My own character runs with these three, plus Talons.  Talons is niche, although part of me wouldn't mind having the ability to completely remake my mutations if I ever lost them for some reason.
---
No one seems to buy Twisted Muscles though, so I can't imagine that the more specific Talons would be any different.
---
I have a bunch in my house because of the croaking noise they give off, helps the setting of the Mire, but I still feel bad for the little guys :(
---
\^This.  It might help if you go to "over the shoulder" view, so you can see when your avatar is standing (because if you're in crouch mode, swim, then go into a low water area, you will stand up again).
---
WAIT DID YOU SAY 3* ULTRACITE GATLING LASER?
---
The most iconic weapon in the series just keeps getting nerfed =(
---
Bethesda don't want you to complete those challenges. They want you to   pay them a little something something.
---
I got two 3 star wood pieces, both became 1 star. The stats are not a UI bug either, one gave +1 INT and other was +1 STR. There are no stat changes when I equip them. It's a totally different item now.
---
Sometimes they freak out when the latch pops and they try to skitter away in reverse.
---
Supposed to be based on the purchaser's level, seems to be a bug (and a CM commented they'll be looking into it).
---
fast travel to Berkley Springs. Turn around.
---
Scrip.
---
Probably a 4 arrow mag, which would be nice on a crossbow if you're into that sort of thing.

I started writing stories back in Beta based on journal entries. They became so popular on Facebook, I decided to create an audio drama podcast series: CHAD, A Fallout 76 Story. You can check it out here:  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y2ffKrbGSXU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y2ffKrbGSXU)

Do Scorchbeasts appear in large enough quantities to meaningfully impact the scrip economy? Is there a world in which killing Scorchbeasts is a more efficient farm than say Whitesprings ghouls? I'm not seeing it. I don't see any downside to adding a marginal benefit to killing an irritating enemy rather than running away in frustration.
---
Tourist on my server too at the lighthouse. Gt LtT4Z
---
The ultracite gatling laser is the prettiest weapon in the game! And now they can be legendary? I wish I was on!

Anchoring to the world with one account and resetting/farming with main?
---
Hey man I’m on PS4 and I know how to do it but I’m on PST. I can log on tonight for a quick sec if you haven’t found anyone by 11 or so your time.
---
I feel like it's less, too. I think people are spending more time on the Tadpole and Possum challenges. But that's just my theory.
---
If items had never been duplicated in the first place running into one these decked out  players would be a rare experience and you would of been on a more level playing field from the start. You could of still bought you gear online but it would of been from players that actually farmed it.
---
Vampire's Explosive Faster Reload DB Shotgun.

Not bad at all. But I dropped 1000 scrip, so....

They can move anything THEY set down.
---
Game on.

(After leaving team or server, can no longer move what they placed down).
---
So, what the progressives are pushing in America these days.
---
True they did give away safety orange carpet for free after charging what 5$ for hardwood floors
---
Yeah, it's tough getting heavy guns due to carry weight, but none of them were worth trading away? There's lots of viable heavy guns... gattling, gattling laser, gattling plasma, minigun... All of them junkies or stalkers?
---
Ok, shame I had to use Google to find where to go instead of Bethesda having a pop up saying the new vendor is here and here's where you find it.  Thanks though.
---
Results per 500 scrip done in ** weapons and 100 on *** - WTS 3* BE Harpoon

That's true, but at the same time, I doubt many players tuck tail and run.  Most would go right back in.

I'm not asking for a checkpoint.  Just spawn me back inside the elevator.  If I want to leave, I can push the button and go.  If not, then you've saved me a couple loads.
---
Based on what?
---
 I never use VATS, never have and all my Combat Knife hits land just fine. About 4 a sec for the Nocturnal 40% speed one. Ghoul hordes melt. ;)
---
Good luck in PvP with that method
---
Ok, ok, very well explained. 
---
Perhaps you're right.
---
Bring back chip damage
---
I wish I could upvote this more than once. I just laughed aloud at work...
---
Yes, it's still a plus.  
---
Maybe I'll get lucky eventually...
---
That worked! Thank you
---
This is the best non-exploitable solution. It sucks, but players can not be trusted to set their own spawn point.
---
What’s the matter your mules tired 😂
---
I doubt you'll be able to have all weapon perks including incisor, tank killer, stabilized etc
---
You're.
---
I love Spears and Grognak Axes
---
If the Pastor Vestments are white then you’ll be looking like a very different kind of tadpole swimmer.
---
&gt; Just spawn me back inside the elevator. If I want to leave, I can push the button and go. If not, then you've saved me a couple loads.
---
I can agree with that.
---
I think Bethesda is drawing a lot of inspiration from ESO. The burrows “dungeon” really feels like a “delve.” They also have “Public Dungeons” in ESO, where you see other players as well. In this sense, I wasn’t surprised at all the burrows wasn’t instanced. I was still hoping it would be, but it follows a formula for another one of their games.
---
I refinish floors pretty often. Believe me, hardwood is so incredibly more valuable then any kind of carpet, much less the objectively worst ever invented
---
At least they have flavour text, I don't get why this didn't come out ages ago as it's been implemented at a similar level as when they added the faction Protectrons to Whitesprings
---
Who wouldve thought an online game would require online interactions. I play solo a lot and honestly i feel your pain but...just group up with randoms. Or find people here. This isnt unachievable. This just requires doing a bit extra work.
---
It is a bug that they said they are looking into, might be fixed in Tuesday's patch.
---
Based on the 3* star Executioner's 10% damage while aiming +50 damage resistance Ultracite Gatling Laser that some little old mole miners lady in Berkeley Springs West Virginia gave me.
---
Has anyone got a Pipe Revolver from anywhere yet?
---
hopefully, I have enough for two rolls when i get home but i'm not holding my breath lol. At least its just two more opportunities to get something worthwhile. I hated vendoring legendaries, especially for sub par money
---
You can select armor, melee, or ranged... everything after that is randomly generated.
---
sell legendaries for scrip.
---
buy random legendaries with scrip.
---
Yep, 100% random, but you can choose the number of stars, and whether it's armor/melee/ranged.
---
It was pretty good buy for me, recently turned into a medics build for my team so getting a medics ultracite Gatling as one of my first buys was great.
---
Lead with that next time, people will care a lot more ;-)
---
Carry weight does impact sneak, so I suppose that is a direct benefit. Indirectly, those carry weight bonuses coming from your armor instead of your perks leads to you being able to free up SPECIAL points and perk card slots for skills and abilities that better serve your build. So yes, I do see benefit in my FDC weight reduction armor set because it frees up STR points that I would otherwise need to dedicate to something like Strong Back and Traveling Pharmacy and allows me to move those points to things like PER and LCK for more active combat abilities and in the case of AGI it allows me to spec out of Thru Hiker and into perks that further my active abilities.
---
I seriously hope they do.
---
However, in the meantime for the unknowing:  After you set down your camp if you move the camp piece around it does actually change your spawn in location.  
---
Although, there doesn't seem to be any logic as to where it will move to.. moving it a foot could move your spawn to the complete other side of the camp -- but it works *for now,* if you try enough spots.  Thankfully the loading screen fast-traveling to your camp from your camp is very fast.
---
There is no rerolling.
---
Well, that just seals it then. ^-^
---
Ok but no reroll the effects of weapons I already have?
---
I wouldn’t buy armor atm. Bethesda included wood armor in the loot table for 3* armor. If you get a 3* wood piece, it will revert to a 1* piece after logging back in.
---
Never mind the major lag spike that happens as soon as you spawn.
---
Purveyor gives low levels toons lvl 50 weapons and armor
---
I like it how it is. Goes well on my shelf of interesting things.
---
I have done three and I've gotten exactly nada .
---
Heres hoping for that 5 star drill
---
They said u could reroll for no reason, they apologized for it in one of the inside the vault posts
---
A chance at love?
---
From what I’ve read that’s a bug. If you restart you should be fine. It happened to me once and a restart cleared it up.
---
Only if you are a whaler on the moon.
---
Ok thanks that was my question cause I read this on a past post here :)
---
Yep, its a shame cus I love that weapon
---
Nope, they have been pretty straight forward that this is what they were rolling out.
---
Yeah. Also, 'dungeons' is how they always called these locations in their games.
---
Nice one OP
---
Upvote for entrepreneurial spirit
---
Not only that but also an "inner" wall that doesn't have an outside version. I hate it when I want to put a brick wall doorframe to separate rooms but one side will be bricks even though it's inside the house :(
---
Last weeks inside the vault and or search function on this sub
---
Ok that's crap im looking  almost for armors damn thanks!
---
Hot garbage mostly comprising of laser pistols and ultracite gatling lasers.
---
Very true.
---
Ok thanks :)
---
Hey, it's not the size of the CAMP, it's what you do with it.
---
... No, seriously, my house is only 4x2 with a 2x1 shed, but I maxed out my budget on decorating them.
---
There is a announcement of such on the personal terminals mentioning seismic activity at Beckley, I think it's essentially the same as when the Scrip Machines were put in.
---
ooh I have a bunch of that
---
but what if I regret selling them later? Better hold onto them
---
This is a new daily? 😉
---
will buy if you are on PS4 !
---
Lol.
---
Is that a working camera? Where'd you get it?
---
ok ok everybody stand down, professional tard here. almost 500 hours in and forgot about the equipping the home defense perk card. much appreciated
---
At this rate I’m not sure because of my job and traffic but I’m usually on by 9 pst or 8pst. If you look around though there will be people that can help you! I helped 3 people and I did the whole swimming badge with the new player.
---
IM AT WORK FIXING BOOTS. Ill trade you some leather scrap and adhesive for canned dog food....and maybe some mutt chops.
---
https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/article/5v7FIGaz3bakvwrXsOZerZ/fallout-76-inside-the-vault-the-purveyor
---
As shown, but the mystery picks seems to have been removed.
---
3 stars going cheap! But mine are pants lol.
---
As I said my situation is solvable but this may not be the same for others. I'm kind of getting at the dependency of missions requiring the involvement of others to complete in order to get milestones.
---
While it is an online game and as we all know it's better to game together this isn't always the situation for everyone so basing missions solely on interactions with others is quite limiting don't you think?
---
Obviously Jishoukatana learned from the Brie Larson school of personal attacks.
---
You gotta understand the goal of how they set it up isn't just together exactly what you want. They set it up so the trash legendary you don't want and or cant really sell anyways can be used to try for better and more useful stuff. So in the aspect of how they set it up it makes alot of sense this way you still have to grind for what you need but you get alot more chances.
---
That's what I thought too
---
Yeah this question is brought up fairly consistently, and yet we have not heard a definitive yes/no on whether it’s functioning as it supposed to or not. I believe the most we have heard on the subject is that the “issue” has been forwarded to the Developers and is being locked into.
---
Now whether it was looked into and found to be working as it was supposed to is something they have not communicated. 
---
We have no way of knowing whether Energy Pistols, Energy Rifles, Energy Heavy Weapons, or energy Flamers are working with the perks that they are supposed to and if the Anti-Armor Legendary effects work whatsoever on Energy weapons.
---
Before they removed Martial artist from effecting mini guns , my vampiric mini gun used to heal me faster than a stim pack
---
Damnit it's in my head now !
---
Haha feel you!
---
yeah I cannot vats hit flying bugs. vats always shows 0%.
---
I love how so many people have been complaining about getting 1* legendary wood armor off of 3* enemies, and now it’s happening with the freaking vendor, where it’s a “guaranteed” 3*.
---
Never change, Bethesda.
---
They do between the camps and fissure prime...... Killing 1 sb for a legendary, opposed to 20+ ghouls maybe for a legendary seems quite a bit easier in my opinion.  I'm semi casual and have never really had trouble finding legendaries, but to each their own.
---
What’s wrong with nuking white spring
---
Yeah and that post also doesn’t list the heavy rocket as learnable for the super sledge. It’s on the all rise and no other super sledges.
---
I'm guessing you are and receiving huh? Wow smh
---
I got 10 junk rolls.  Well junk to my build anyway.
---
Not sure what to do with all them now my stash is full and I'm overburdened.
---
Just saw that.
---
THANK GOD.
---
At least they’ve addressed it at this point
---
Exceptionally well made, really really enjoyed it - am on my second watch/listen :)
---
Keep making them!!
---
The irony in that is that I don't give a shit if people care or not.
---
People have been asking about them and there was speculation from data miners that they were added. 
---
As the title says......
---
Lege Ultracite Gatling confirmed.
---
sad face I'm on ps4
---
Correct.
---
Thank you sir!
---
are you sure you're not banned?
---
While I think unlimited might be pushing it, I wish they had increased the daily (and total) limit in the week between the machines landing and the Purveyor showing up.  I've still got a backlog of useless legendaries in my stash that I haven't been able to recycle, yet.
---
It was pretty op
---
Maybe I don’t want to get cooked alive when I log on and want to go shopping
---
You dont need to have them all at once though if you can just swap them out in combat.  That's the point.
---
Say you and I get into pvp.  We start at range.
---
I start with a sniper build. You close I swap out to all def perks till you get closer, swap to heavy weapons, you close the gap I swap to shotgun, you come to melee I slap in unarmed and blocker, you move back out i swap to automatic rifles, you pull out a rocket launcher I swap again and slap in fireproof, etc etc etc.
---
Just broken.
---
I know you see it as just a QoL increasen and I see where you are coming from, but it really isn't unless it's only outside of combat.
---
So, what was your god roll?
---
Nice, that’s a pretty beautiful first visit! 😊 I was pretty happy with my second roll, I figure 1 out of 2 ain’t bad. And currently running around nuked BS collecting the supplies I need to build my first jet pack, so all in all a perfectly successful day.
---
It works check your numbers on crafting it before and after a quick log in and out
---
I got a zealots LL with WRR and +1 strength
---
Wow that's entitled. 
---
Bethesda has the right to pull anything they want. For whatever reason they want. And they don't even have to give you that reason. It's their game not yours. 
---
How do you know it wasn't buggy as all hell and they plan on reconstituting it later?
---
They didn't advertise anything either.  It was in a single screenshot from a time when it was still in development. 
---
Don't blame them because, once again I'm sure, you got all fired up for something and it didn't work out exactly as your hopes and dreams.
---
Sorry didn’t know if that was allowed 
---
GT: Pork Sword 00
---
Honestly it is not the best.  
---
The best is Quad + E + Quick Load.
---
Well you know they arent doing it to be dicks, that’s the best spot in the game to level your character. They can’t be expected to not nuke white springs because someone wants to shop
---
2 shot limb, damage, crit rate gatling laser. Thats about it
---
Well, said hot goth chick is the personification of Death itself.  
---
And actually his motivation was surprisingly similar.  SHE wanted half the population of the universe culled, and her justification was a mix of MCU-Thanos' motivation combined with the idea that "there were more living beings in existence than had EVER died" was an imbalance in its own right.
---
She charged Thanos with carrying out her will, and manipulated his affections for her to see it done.  He enthusiastically believed in her motives, though.  So really, they aren't *that* dissiimlar.  During the setup for the original "Infinity Gauntlet" storyline, Thanos gives a speech not too dissimilar from the one he gives Team Iron Man on Titan, just to the Silver Surfer.
---
So you know I was able to sell an anti armor explosive pipe bolt action for 11k yesterday, they're doing well in the market right now.
---
You can still join. I'm on ps4 as well just ment we are looking actively for PC and xbox. I'm helping out them to find more members
---
Said they were on PS4
---
Hopefully someone gets a Quad Pipe Revolver that I can buy on Xbox.
---
U can post your own. But not others in an attempt to "witch hunt"
---
No they’re not banned- they can still log into their other characters. They don’t ban individual characters
---
You can have it. Got a few of them. Whats your gamertag?
---
Yeh. spoke to support several times. defenatley not banned. Apparently it's a known glitch. seen some post on here with other people suffering with it. some people have had it for weeks now
---
I’m sure OP is in adventure mode so that would do nothing wouldn’t it?
---
You want something like the Minecraft enchantment system! It shows one enchantment out of the list you would get on the item.
---
But there ain’t no whales so we tell tall tales
---
Awesome, sounds good. If I haven't found anyone by then I'll hit you up. I'm usually in bed around 1030 eastern but I can stay up alittle later to get that. I'll let you know on here
---
Yes I will gt MeanAssChic22 just send me a message when you get on...
---
And I actually got one from the vendor, so it's confirmed, I already modded it though, although the damage is not so high, but the accuracy is kinda fun https://imgur.com/uRmksO0.jpg
---
Not everyone is godly geared, and yeah killing SB is easy I literally killed three are one time. It would be nice to have a legendary with mutations or something but them I'm pretty sure everyone would pitch a fit on how long it takes to kill it.
---
The SBQ fights not everyone participates in personally I get bored of them it's been how many months of farming her? She's still broken and the fight still has some buggy issues in regards to mehanics and at one point in time even being able to loot her?
---
So a guaranteed drop should be a thing with a level 90 three 🌟 boss
---
Nuke zones count as radstorms.
---
Thanks for tip!
---
Hmu with that invite. Xbox ovah here
---
No kidding? 
---
I'm down to go try. Never used the market before but that's hard to pass up. My character isnt even a sniper.
---
New here I take it?
---
LOL xD
---
Play support if your low level. use a shot gun with enforcer perk or a cryo to help ground or slow the SBQ. Aim where the wings join the body or hind legs. Stick with the group so you don't aggro the SBQ away from the group.
---
You xbox or ps?
---
I got a bloodied gauss with faster reload and damage resistance while reloading and a furious hunting rifle with reload speed and I forget the 3rd perk. To be honest my first experience was a little better than I thought it was going to be.
---
I'll come help out
---
Don't log out.....or mod it......
---
Nah man this guy is the sun and the world revolves around him. Everyone should change the way they play just for this one player.
---
xD
---
Vending machine could have base to avoid this.
---
You have to manually load 4 shots and it can shoot 4 times in a row without reloading.
---
I mean, even the devs said the Whitesprings was the best place to nuke. What do you expect?
---
Invest in a Radiation Suit or some perks. It's not a big deal.
---
Please load up pistols on your vendor!  ~800 hours in and I’ve got more god roll melee weapons than I have decent pistol weapons.
---
Oh, I totally agree with the SBQ 3* drop portion.... I did not agree that every SB should drop a legendary though. Adding SOME legendary SBs to the RNG pool would be nice though.
---
This is literally what this guy expects, lol what is wrong with some people
---
Awww...that's awesome! Thank you so much. :)
---
Pics or it didn’t happen
---
Careful with the vendor. I just lost 500 for total crap. Mostly useless armor and weapons with all 100% vats accuracy (not to mention that it doesn't even work, it's never 100 and never scores the hit). Only useful was combat shotgun with explosive bullets (+ 100% accuracy in vats and +1 perception but those are garbage)
---
Alright cool! And if not today then we will do it tomorrow. It’s all easier when you do the challenges with a friend.
---
Np! They’ll fix it in a couple of months, don’t worry 🙃
---
An amazing 30 seconds of regen, followed by the crafting of another 10,000 rounds.
---
And here I thought I was doing fine with like 65 scrip
---
I need to up my A game
---
I am not kidding lol check my post history, you could even message the runner up to see if he'd pay for it. 
---
I am also not a sniper, I fully modded it and tried the thing, it just wasnt for me.
---
But again, you have probably not been in survival mode, thats okay. But there really isn't a lot of pvp, it's usually one shotting people from stealth. By the time you can even switch loadouts and blink your eyes, you are dead.
---
Naw. Me's on PC.
---
I didn’t explain it right, was in a hurry, the machine could have a base, the player would spawn there.
---
platform?
---
I can see that working, a thin wall piece that only snaps to the interior side of a structural wall.
---
Probably opening up a can of worms here, but invite them to trade.  That should break the connection with the vendor.  Don't abuse this...
---
Seem to recall it being a camp related glitch.  You may can ask someone to move to your spot then login so it is taken and be able to get in and move your camp.  That fix has popped up here from time to time.
---
Yeah that sounds good, I'll just do the archery one this evening and get it over with, and whatever other swimming challenges
---
Ya mine too! My first gun was the bloodied combat rifle. The next 2 both were explosive. Still scrapped them since they werent rifles.
---
What quest? I’m only level 110 or some shit but I’d love to help after work
---
Can do if you still need it later on. Gt KnowledgeHound level 176
---
Omg you got a legendary shovel??
---
I’m only level 14, just need help with main quests
---
I don't even bother doing that shit anymore.
---
We had the same on my server. I even gave up my spot to a guy who was in a hurry because it was late where he was. I had all day.
---
Good is an understatement. That’s incredible! Was it a 3*?
---
What system and gt?
---
Xbox I didn't even think to ask my bad
---
PS4?
---
HaHa no kidding
---
My best sellers are recipes for some reason.
---
I heard fresh charracter will get max level weapon too. Ps4 can play on two consoles with 1bought game. So i will farm tones of legendaries, come with mule, scrap legendaries buy randoms, delete mule, make new one,......
---
yeah i think its dumb, dogs and radrats can do this too
---
Will this new area be accessible outside of the event? There probably won’t be much time to explore if you’re only allowed in during the event.
---
You should be able to place down two doorframes back to back. That's how you get full interior brick walls, put down doorframes then replace them with the full wall pieces.
---
My carry weight when at 1/3rd health is about 425 no PA. Extremely low health will get me to 470. High capacity BP makes me have about 550. I am the stash.
---
I doesn’t matter
---
They might seem pedantic but it's important.  Scrip is a real life thing that  is a part of West Virginia history.
---
I’m sure today it’s getting overloaded, but still, very disheartening
---
Todd Howard, is that you? :p
---
Aw damnit, ps4 here. Thank you for attempting though
---
Lower weight total for equipped armor = better sneaking.
---
Some items can have zero weight when combined with the "Weightless" Legendary effect and the "Ultra Light" mod (Light/Medium Leather Armor and Marine Armor from what I recall).
---
Nah get fucked bloodied builds
---
Who the fuck cares? Seriously? You’re an awful human being. I only speak English and I don’t mind this at all. If I can’t read it, oh well. This isn’t an “English” subreddit. Everyone is welcome here and if their console is in another language, that’s okay. Close minded douche bag.
---
Buy up legendaries you find at player venders before everybody increases their prices.
---
My explosive hunters rifle suddenly feels so inadequate.   :|
---
HAHAHA   +1
---
So your best bet to cut losses is to turn it into scrip again before relogging, so you will at least get 24 back instead of just 3?
---
Well, tbh we'll never know that for sure if it's been removed entirely. Someone with more optimism than myself suggested it was temporarily removed because it lacked the tag preventing explosive energy weapons. Also, apparently the legendary vendor wood armor is all bugged and reverting from 3* and 2* to 1*. So be careful.
---
Hmm. I have tried logging in several times every day and no joy but it's worth a try. I have also heard it's a camp related glitch too but nothing else
---
You don’t have to translate anything my dude. Ignore that waste of human space. Those of us who aren’t hateful xenophobes, don’t mind.
---
PS4 id FritoZ
---
hope to see you in the wasteland, i have some A grade toilet paper for ya!
---
Yes that is indeed how literally every business ever made works.
---
Why even post this? The chances for seeing this by anyone  that anyone that was affected by this, or them caring is astronomically slim
---
Bloodied Vats chance DB and a Troubleshooters Explosive DB were my best two. I'm wondering about the benefits of choosing 2 star over 3 star. Are tertiary effects worth paying double the price?
---
For me it was on the sidewalk leading up to the memorial with the cannons. Trust me you can’t miss him, he’s sprawled out on the pavement.
---
Jesus
---
I Got an aae weight reduced 50 cal machinegun...
---
Definitely one of the coolest looking armors in game!
---
I also have wasted a lot of armor by scrapping it, not knowing I didn’t get mods (like other armors)
---
I would absolutely ignore if this armor was a little worse but we either get the plans or mods from scrapping it. 
---
It’s so bad ass looking!
---
Sounds good dood, I'll shoot you a message when I get home.
---
Ok thanks. I ended up finding Ansel on whitespring
---
Upvoting hoping this is true. I will hunt down every daily.
---
It was something like 30lbs, wasn't it? That's a lot of lunch!
---
Vendor is busy right now.
---
why not invest in a radiation emitter room for your camp?
---
great bursts of radiation on the flick of a pressure panel, great for "rewarding" overly curious visiters
---
As something I rarely see:  Hardened mass, glowing mass, high rad fluids at a good price.  I’m always short on one of the three (usually hardened mass) and always like to perfectly clear out all flux after a nuke, but never can.
---
.308 ammo for the LMG lovers.
---
I'll have to look at my list but I think i got one
---
Np sorry hopefully you can get someone to help you out...
---
You on PC? Can I have your stuff?
---
Bye and nobody cares!
---
This last post hits me hard; I always complained and got yelled at for it. I wanted to do an energy weapon build when the game first came out; underwhelmed and hurt at laser weapons and such. Got my first plasma weapon and it was all down hill from there haven't touched the character since; plasma was end game content and so best in other games but in this game it isn't hitscan it's slow either does minimal damage compared to  pipe pistol or 0 damage cause it missed due to how it's game mechanics are.
---
Hey, the guy didn't bash anything.  He just gave his opinion -- something he is 100% entitled to voice.  I agree with having the option of spawning inside. But c'mon people. All he said was that he AGREES it is an inconvenience... but that it's not an ISSUE that BGS needs to focus their time and energy on at this point.
---
This could be an opportunity to clarify whether wood armor was always **supposed** to only drop as one-star loot, or if that's a bug that just has never been addressed.
---
We'll miss you.
---
/s
---
Hey I know it has been some time but do you still happen to be playing fallout 76? If you are can you craft it for me? Willing to pay for it!
---
Yeah. The last is the defense while loading. Not perfect but I'll still take it.
---
I already refunded the game.
---
Never but before the dupe wave 2 pieces = 1 laser unless they are bos
---
I feel like there's confusion in this thread. The powered door has [two points](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CmQZ4pKayrI) of contact. If it's not working, it's because power is being connected incorrectly.
---
Two shot isn't great on rifles though, since it reduced range
---
I envy you soooo much right now lol
---
Its all good, I think I found a person but wont be till tomorrow. Thanks again
---
I have a full set of deep pocketed trapper armor with 3 of the 5 pieces offering weight reduction for weapons, food &amp; chems etc. It actually provides as much carry weight as my PA.
---
That's actually being addressed last I heard. That is not how they envisioned pvp and most likely why the nuclear winter will be using static weapons/armor and not your own.  Actually lretty excited about that, thank you dataminers.
---
It was just an example anyway cause it was more cut and dry, this isnt fair to everyone kind of thing.
---
Let me put it this way.  If every character was meant to do everything perk cards wouldn't have a special point cost and you would just have a huge list of perks.
---
Thats one dedicated response 👍

Come see me at my vendor store. I currently have 10 stacks of bulk aluminum for sale. I am on PC. IGN: pokerplayr. Just southwest of WS
---
Just sharing for those few that still would like to refund but are discouraged due to Bethesda's handling.  
---
Don't worry I don't mind that you won't miss me.
---
Nice one.
---
Thanks
---
Damn that’s pretty cool if you’re in a pinch or get spotted. Great start 👍
---
Are learned plans cross-character?
---
I'd love to have alternate characters just for Sims building, haha, but I don't want to invest the time into grinding for caps to learn plans.
---
I just sold super mutant body parts for 500c each... it was a joke now it’s income.
---
No and just FYI there is a “floor” to going negative.  Str and end will not Lower your carry capacity and hit points to near nothing.
---
Slap damage?
---
Are you on Xbox? I'll come see what you have, maybe I can take some of that burden off you hands...

Plenty of good reasons..  [https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Fallout\_76\_legendary\_effects](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Fallout_76_legendary_effects)

#DeadGame
---
Fair. How much more scrip is a 3 than a 2, anyways?
---
Didn't they instance the one NPC you have to kill for a quest so people could stop serverhopping until they find him alive?
---
Yup! I already had a 2 star exactly like that one. Bloodied with 33% vats hit chance. It was pretty awesome. Almost never misses in vats. But i will happily take the added perception on the new one!
---
What do you consider a good price for those things?
---
It appears you're promoting a discord server or community. This is not allowed under Rule 5 and your post has been removed.
---
Imagine, for a moment, that the majority of players DON'T have overpowered gear, and that they are perfectly fine with the difficulty on the Eastern side of the map, where a Yao Guai or Mirelurk Queen or Assaultron can decimate a person in seconds.
---
This isn't an MMO. It doesn't need PVE scoreboards or raids or Challenging content that 5% of the player base can reliably complete.
---
Stuff like the Scorchbeasts Queen and Sheepsquatch imposter are perfect for end game: a big threat that anyone can try and help take down.
---
It's all about accessibility. Not exclusivity. Everyone  should be able to play without having to spend dozens if hours grinding.
---
That's a solid pull, id be more than happy with that later.
---
Sure got me some pretty things!!! 50 cal MG with faster fire rate and Furious.... extra perception is nice I guess but it shreds everything I point it at.
---
Only for melee and Vats build does that 3rd really matter.  For other builds it’s a nice QOL but doesn’t add much value to the gun unfortunately.  Things like speed demon serum don’t stack with reload speed effects.  A lot of perks also negate weapon weight as well.
---
YES! i only keep the gory heads to sell, because i thought it looks badass in the preview it shows, but thanks for that tip, ill start picking them all up now!
---
PC!
---
Tick damage
---
Sign me up.  Also solid paint colors pretty please.
---
On weapons: reload speed, vats AP, weapon weight, Dr reloading. All are usefull.
---
On armor: weight management effects, sentinel
---
Under "Minor Modifiers?"
---
I've been playing since launch and only recently did I get a full ultralight/polymer set.
---
That's happened to me a few times, I always feel terrible for anyone who was visiting my store. It would be nice if the camp persisted for a few moments or just started phasing out so players would have a chance to escape. Or even a warning countdown that the camp was going to disappear in X seconds.
---
For armor - Sentinel, cavalier on armor is 3rd star. Weight reduction (convenience and mules) is also 3rd star.
---
For weapons... AP cost reduction is rather great. Weight reduction too on rifles. Rest is kinda minor.
---
Yes it could add a point to your Special stats.
---
Can also confirm; got a Troubleshooter +1strength and -20% weight from junk scout leg.
---
Well, 2 reasons. Firstly I have a high volume of customer sand some have even come from Reddit. Secondly, I see a lot of posts recently from people complaining about vendors logging off when customers are in the middle of browsing a vending machine. Just a friendly reminder that sometimes that 'logging off' is not in out control.
---
Well, you can use the personal terminal that Beth specifically added so people can check on these new stuff and get in-game markers for them
---
Or join both. Not like there is a limit to how many groups you can be a part of
---
its tied to your level, i just got a 3\* lvl 5 pipe pistol
---
Everything.
---
I sympathize with there being too many camera challenges. I feel like F76 really likes to try and force you to team up with other players and I wish it was more evenly-balanced for group vs solo play. I like the level-up challenges, however, because they really *feel* challenging and they're fun to do. I just wish there was more variety because it seems to just alternate from day-to-day with the same lists
---
Yea but it's zealots
---
Ps4.  Most likely going npc vendor it all.
---
 I really only use 2 rifles in the entire game.  I wasn't really expecting to get anything I can use.
---
my 3* all come from either Uranium Fever, or WesTek. Never seen more than a 2 at Whitesprings, and that was really rare. Nice 2 star Tesla with reload speed though. kept that.
---
Still!!? I’ve been wanting legendary shovels for ages
---
Not bad. I ran a vamps pool cue from level 40 to 60ish. Vamp can really save the day
---
Hey hey now let’s not be hasty partner... splitting it even so we both make a pretty cap sound good?
---
🤣
---
Depends on the item, I guess.
---
Armor is a no-brainer, because there are a number of interesting third effects.
---
Rifles too - Vats, faster reload, DR while reloading, reduced weight....
---
Minor Modifiers Tier 3
---
1 Agility	
---
1 Endurance	
---
1 Perception	
---
1 Strength	
---
15% faster reload	
---
25% less VATS Action Point cost	
---
250 damage resistance while reloading	
---
50 Damage resistance while aiming	
---

---
IF you want any of these, go for 3s
---
Yeah that would be ideal. We can hope :)
---
I think so. I didn't check I just assumed.
---
Where's the joke?
---
I do belive it had to be at least 2 star since explosive is a secondary prefix that is added after the original star.
---
Was at a camp and about to look at the vending machine when it instantly turned into a totally different camp. Different design. Different owner. Exact same spot. Within seconds.
---
This and sell everything you don't use that's a legendary, I'm sitting at around 500 ish I think.
---
Like the difference between *passive* and *pacifist*.  So many people thought/think that there's a "passive" mode in the game, and you can play passively and not get hurt.  Hopefully some of them learned the difference.  *Pacifists* don't hurt other people, but they can still be hurt.
---
Maybe a bit of a moot point now that the game has changed a bit, but it was an important distinction for a while.
---
Ideally, we could work towards some kind of reintegration, given that you’re faction and ours both serve the greatest country through the greatest military known in the world.
---
I know when a 3* is near by because they have much higher perception and detect me in sneak instantly
---
yea
---
I feel there was a missed opportunity to have the Sheepsquatch still able to bleat like a sheep :(
---
I mean my god, how amazing (terrifying) would it be if that was it's out-of-combat "idle" noise???  
---
Having never encountered it before and you're wandering around in the woods trying to reach some new location, then in the distance you hear it.... *"BaaaA-A-A-A-A"....*   
---
Your eyebrow raises and you look at your Thirst Bar to make sure you're not hallucinating from dehydration.   
---
....*"BaaaaA-A-A-A!"*
---
You begin making your way towards the new sound, with excitement of seeing an Ovis  (scientific indicator of Sheep) and.... t...that's NOT A SH*EEP HOLY SHHHIIIITT!!!!*  
---
\*ded\* :P
---
price fixing and collusion! i approve of this message
---
I believe it’s because 3* grants you one effect from each category. Whereas 2* is only two of them. So you get a Prefix a Major and a Minor for 3* but on a 2* you run the risk of just a major and minor effect when the prefix are the strongest. I think anyway, not 100% sure
---
I cashed in my 3* Furious Dragon and ghoulslayer Gamma gun with extreme satisfaction. It felt good to grind those bastards up.
---
Whoa junkies 10mm pistol, suppressor’s radium, nocturnal flamer, hunter’s M79. I think my life is complete. Should I keep feeding her my crisps? 🤮
---
Yeah 1* wood armor has been a meme complaint on Bethesda forums too for a long time. It's like they'd have to be intentionally ignorant of the issue at this point.
---
Is your name Karen by chance?
---
what was the level of the character?
---
I'm going to do two stars until I get a nice AAE rifle to round out my build. After that I'll go for the 3* God rolls. Twice the scrip for the third start (50 vs 100) just isn't worth it for me at the moment.
---
Can you elaborate a little? Are we even supposed to even be getting 3\* wood armor from the purveyor? And if we are, why does it only only drop as 1\* from enemies?
---
Kind of like a scratch ticket that you got for free by turning in a bunch of used scratch tickets that have no value to you, except for the 5 caps you might have gotten by selling it to a robot vendor.
---
Even if the odds are crap, it’s 100% upside. It stings a bit now walking out of the brand new legendary shop with empty pockets and a bunch of bad guns, but as a feature I’d say this was really good for the game. Now crap legendaries matter, even if it’s only a little.
---
From my experience, the spawn point seems to be the spot you first placed your camp device down.
---
Not where you move it after you've made your base but where you initially place the C.A.M.P. device.
---
In my experience, moving it worked 1 or twice but then goes back to the original placement spot.
---
Not very usefull for me tho... I'm melee build
---
Same although our groups are kinda assholes so yeah
---
ah you’re one of those
---
fyi you are/were too early.
---
do people even wear wood armor? just rescrip imo
---
Well, yeah, they should go full apocalypse with no fancy floors and lamps OR complete fancy options with wallpapers, nice stairs, working toilets etc.
---
We are always open to alliances if you would like I can discuss it with my fellow officers
---
Bye Felecia
---
lvl 5
---
&gt; 3* anti armor 10% damage while aiming reduced weight 10mm submachine gun so far
---
I'd buy that for a dollar.
---
how's that wooden armor working out now?
---
Unfortunately no I haven't.. =[
---
Urban scout, weapon weight, and that shotty are all pretty cool. And the exp executioner pipe could be a cool little backup. I just saw someone looking for a pipe revolver.
---
Yeah i was looking for that one to... Maybe they'll add it in later
---
uwu
---
I will forward this to my command structure and keep you informed.
---
I had a 3-star assaultron head revert to 2 star.  [https://imgur.com/a/x2542mh](https://imgur.com/a/x2542mh)
---
Please let me collect the typewriter I need screws
---
I always think about how while I'm smacking cancer bats with a stick, a few hundred miles away Final Pam slumbers.
---
Subtitles help a bit with this. Especially in West Tek. I've been about ready to leave when I've had a random Legendary mutie subtitle pop up on my screen. Then the hunt is on ; ).
---
I'm pretty sure I was there during this this if it was on xbox one. First time that I have experienced this.
---
If you pay more than vendors do, sure. I'm on PC, IGN Maneetoe.
---
Can you show a picture? :)
---
Could be a bug. I know vendors have shared inventory (between players) and the special would probably  be once per day. Maybe one lucky guy got the pick and nobody else can?
---
What platform are you on and where is your camp?
---
Good doing business with you friend.
---
And I see they didn't take the time to fix the urban scout left arm DR numbers while they were in there tinkering . Smh
---
Remember.
---
RNG giveth and RNG taketh away.
---
Clever girls...
---
1. Yes, that's true.
---
2. No, despite the datamining, she only seems to appear at Berkeley Springs. I've server hopped several times looking for a camera and she's been there every time.
---
3. Also true. Anyone who expected differently is a moron. The only real advantage she provides is that you're guaranteed an item with the star level of your choosing.
---
Possibly the coolest thing I've ever seen on this sub.
---
Thanks for leaving it next to my cow then. I knew it wasn't hers.
---
Just got a Vanguard Forest Scout Armor Left Arm with +25 poison res and 75% chance to reduce Damage by 15% while sprinting. Not bad.
---
and the guy on it went to get dinner and a movie.
---
Well with the Bethesda forums I dont think that stuff should be pisted hear at all? They are more likely to respond to requests on that forum then on reddit.
---
Nice! Had the exact opposite experience lol but I guess that’s what happens when you play roulette with mama murmrgh
---
absolutely agree, for the time investment it should absolutely be.
---
if only I could get a Sarissa :/
---
You mean all the crazy speculation posts where everyone would be able to turn anything into a god-roll just with turning in a few nocturnal rolling pins?  I remember those
---
This should have been brought to your attention from the data mined list of rewards someone posted last week. Why can't you guys look at your own code and determine what's going to happen? I'm genuinely curious. Is it a lack of enough people on the team? Wood hasn't been three star ever, why wouldn't you actually fix that or exclude it from the table? Moreover, why didn't anyone in testing notice this? Do you have an actual test environment, or do you just spin up local fake servers on each machine and the dev does a few minutes of testing? What is the major malfunction?
---
Ya way too much work when you can just go farm legendaries instead
---
I don’t think so. In fact i have noticed i only started getting 2 stars after level 35 so i think they might be level tiered
---
My understanding is that the note on the tourist actually starts the quest not the camera so it does you no good without finding the tourist.
---
What d'you mean "THEY" cut the power.  How can "THEY" cut the power, man?  They're animals!
---
Mama Murmrgh is unpredictable, my friend. Next day I will probably get all Nocturnal Wood.
---
BE Heavy Gunner here. I can’t speak for PvP, but for PVE I’ll poo on a vats build for sustained Queen damage no doubt.  As far as melee, they have great burst and sustained but good luck staying in that perfect window on the Queen.  Your either gonna switch to a vamp wep or pop a diluted radaway and go above 20% health losing nerd rage.  Everything other than a Queen is a one shot fest for almost any bloody build.  My point?  Try out a BE Heavy Gunner.
---
They should add an option where you can lock doors that aren't in your base to keep enemies from coming in unless they're scorched humans or super mutants. Maybe just maybe, Yao Guai since they beefy.
---
I don't know, I think when land mines are placed, they become 'neutral' and can injure everything.
---
If you’re running a Prime AAE Gatling you’re probably not any variety of casual.
---
You can sell that for a hell of a lot though.
---
I would never forget that.
---
Don’t you insult our Babushka MoleGramma! It’s not her fault that the black lung makes speaking hard!
---
And after she dug all this way just to see you...
---
Yeah the note starts the quest, but the camera is still needed for the daily and weekly atom challenges regardless of the quest.
---
So, it is not supposed to be like that? Cause I get same and thought it might be intended. Like, you don't know what you will get.
---
Also, vendor name on russian is "mumbling of vendor".
---
I’ve had it for a while. But a bunch of the other misc mods (stuff like Stabilized for Arms) doesn’t work- you can’t apply the mods. I haven’t checked to see if that’s been fixed in a long time- it’s never been in the patch notes.
---
I read online it's at the spruce knob lake, haven't went looking for it yet. Try and find a table set up with the speaker box
---
did you get those 2* when you were paying for 3*?
---
This post is a great idea! I usually send this message out to others in the world I’m nuking in. The more the merrier
---
And that is why I recently moved my CAMP
---
Nice!!
---
Jadam91
---
Giggity, that's what she said .... Maybe he?
---
Yeah I got one.
---
Awesome dude! In case you don't know, pipe weapons with rifle stocks benefit from both pistol and rifle perks.
---
So they want you to do the quest before you can use the camera for challenges then.
---
Nah, it's always consistent
---
Legendary weapons can carry up to 3 different modifiers based on the number of stars.
---
    A 1-star legendary will have a prefix modifier
---
    A 2-star legendary will have a prefix modifier and a major modifier
---
    A 3-star legendary will have a prefix modifier, a major modifier, and a minor modifier
---
I'm at the gym right now.
---
I will try to upload a picture when I get home though.
---
Last time I tried to upload a picture for a trader I gave up because it was a waste of my time......so I have to ask.......is there an actual reason that you need to see it or is it just a dick measurement?
---
I'm doing some initial 3\*'s while I'm near the scrip cap and character weight limits, since the 3\* hold more trade-in value per pound, but I agree. 2\*'s are the value way to go for most of us 1\* warriors looking for an upgrade.
---
More likely means you'll be stuck playing with Americans, rip brother.
---
100% agreed. Sad it doesn’t have one, kinda lazy but I’m used to it I guess
---
So if someone is with a Vendor and you send Trade invite, it breaks that? I didn't know that... interesting
---
I agree. I hated her quest but i like the character
---
Seriously I’m a freaking monster and torment super mutants for kicks but that poor frog cramped in that jar with that suffocatingly sad face makes this weird pulsating thing in my upper chest hurt!
---
I'm lvl 90ish, in central US, play most evenings.  Rifle build.
---
Friend requests and team invites welcome.
---
IGN xXJohnnyMechXx, anyone looking to team up welcome.
---
Good riddance
---
Casual in the amount of time I have to play.... I've been farming since beta and have gotten many lucky drops... Also specifically traded for that one though
---
Just wondering... What amount is '' a Hell of a lot''? 😁
---
It just works!
---
The thing is you are 100% correct and that most people will have exactly the same experience that you (and I..nearly identical) had, but you're still the bad guy because you said something about it.
---
How long did you play before asking for a refund?
---
Stuff in the Vending Machine is still in your Stash, it's just a separate stack. They probably didn't account for that.
---
I usually get nocturnal wood as well.
---
I love gatling lasers. I have like 20 legendary variants. And a normal ultracite one. I would love to actually see a legendary. Since you said you got one from the purveyor, I'd love to see it just to see a legendary ultracite gatling laser. And if RNG blesses me one day with one, I'll get to use it.
---
I think you’re right, I spawn in the 1 place too.
---
I always leave mine open, grab a drink or 8 lol and play some music while you shop.
---
I got a explosive combat shotgun that does 30% damage to scorched
---
Why such a strong response to me telling people they can still refund?
---
I'd honestly love to hear what the issue is.
---
I’m a bad reference for pricing because I price things to sell over max return, but I wouldn’t put that up for less than 3000 caps.
---
Xbox, but thanks.
---
Since the Imposter needs a 2000c recall card, there should be _something_ guaranteed, to make it worth doing. Last time I did it 2 people showed up, we failed, used 40 stimpaks, whereas in normal fights I barely use any. Could've sold 40 stims for 1k, so it was a 3k drain
---
I thought you could only get 1 star wooden armor?
---
You can get 3* from purveyor
---
X to inspect, then repair from there.  Or, get the old style workbench mod which adds repair back to the direct interface.
---
Nah i meant as natural drops, even on 2 or 3 star enemies would only get 1 star loot
---
But you can start doing challenges regardless of if the bucket list quest is completed or even started as long as you have picked up a camera.
---
And whats the point of finding all the extras if you can't do anything with them?
---
PS4 and next to Whitesprings station. like most people lol
---
Go to a weapons work bench. There will be modify/repair. Hit T on the weapon you want to repair then r to repair it.
---
There is another step now. Press the button for repair and then press the button for Workbench.
---
No, go to a workbench and press the repair button. This will take you to a screen with two repair options. You wanna pick the one that says “workbench repair”. Check the bottom of screen for button.
---
At your bench there's a different button for workbench repair and repair kit.
---
Melee is the only thing that they never nerfed and never intended to, don’t worry you’re in good hands
---
Go to repair/modify on the workshop then I think it was Triangle/Y then X or square.
---
I'll be on in about 30 minutes
---
To each their own, but I wouldn't think it should be white in any case.
---
The color of the pale horse in the original greek is a word that means either pallid or greenish, and it's the same root word as chlorophyll and chlorine. The ashy color seems right to me. 
---
Also I love the chemical weapons symbol on the chest, even though technically I'm a melee build.
---
But you don't know what you're getting from the purveyor until you buy it ha
---
In that case I will figure out how to upload a picture for you.
---
And if people are super desperate for scrip they can buy some cheap throw away legendaries.
---
Bloatflys too!
---
I look forward to getting my VATS enhanced Drill.
---
What's up with the hate, he didn't like the game so he got his money back, i don't see what's wrong here
---
It is infuriating to fight stingwings with my axe and no VATs.
---
Maybe it had issues so they cut it or it was an old build picture
---
I played the beta and then sat back and watched.
---
I informed bethesda support of the same right out of the gate, answer was still "no" initially.
---
I don't doubt they are just told to instantly deny any refund attempts.
---
So even if you have played some time and you are not happy, try.
---
They've been inconsistent on this before already
---
Yea man used to be afraid of scorch beasts now they fly away in fear lol. Dropped a Level 80 in under 2 seconds last night, would be too easy if they had legendary drops.
---
I started taking pictures of every camp I see to get an idea of what I eventually  want to build. But the strip club theme sounds amazing.
---
Got screws?
---
I've already been buying cheap legendaries just to scrip them.  I'm at around 500 scrips last I recall.
---
Awesome I'll look for you tonight most likely. IGN PattyStabs
---
They only stopped the missile camps at the clubhouse.  All other areas are fine.
---
could you have recycled it in the machine?  
---
Shitty option but at least that way you could have recovered some scrip.  Hopefully they fix it soon though.
---
i'm fine with the way it is.  This way, we can exchange 1 screw for caps instead of having to bulk them.
---
Was this from the random roll purchase, or the 3 star rifle purchase?
---
Probably his own work
---
No. You can have up to 5 I believe.
---
The extras are in-case you lose/drop/destroy yours. You cannot get a camera in world containers until you've at least started the quest and gotten your first camera from the tourist.
---
Because they were told after the bombs they'd be the only thing left.  They're PISSED that we're still around so coming after us like we're in some Damnation Alley.
---
You can have up to 5 different characters. You can't make anymore until you delete one. to change which one you load in as select them in the main menu.
---
Best I got was Assassin's Explosive Hunting Rifle with Perception. I modded it and added it to my PVM
---
And? i got 3* wooden and it becomes 1* after relog. So people can sell it and you'll get 1* shitty armor later
---
Thank you buddy
---
I was there last night, all the cement and lead was there.
---
But then vault dwellers will murder it like they do my Brahmin.
---
I hope future articles address community concerns. Popular suggestions, pressing issues etc.
---
I realize they can't really talk about certain bugs and exploits that they're fixing since it'd spur people to abuse them as much as possible before the next patch, but harmless stuff like what they're actually doing to change stability and such
---
I'm on ps4
---
Restart, you are referring to shutting down the game and logging back in?  Not rebuilding?
---
I created a second one and my first one is till there.
---
oh phew thank god
---
thanks dudes
---
I've seen bulk screws at vendors. We however cannot bulk them.
---
I hear she loaded 16 tons to get to Berkeley Station!
---
Lol they're alright tbf, not met a bad one in game yet.
---
Easy 25k+ or any weapon you want really.
---
A lot probably see this as a hate thread.
---
Like im telling them they arent allowed to like the game.
---
I have no issues with people enjoying Fo76.
---
Two laser pistols and an M79. Waaaaa
---
Every single screw I found belongs to the crew and me. They are rare enough.
---
Hmmm. Okay. Thanks.
---
Had a player rush past me and pushed himself infront of another player busy with the Purveyor. He must have disrupted the players trading as the player smashed him with his gronack axe for the next two minutes.
---
Speaking of PVMs, i think we will see some price drops now with the legendary vendor out.
---
You can have a perfect build at lv 60 if you know what to choose from the beginning!
---
In Todd we trust
---
people like bolstering ?
---
is this worth something then?
---

---
I didn't get anything I was looking for, which is weightless detection trapper
---
Same with ballistic fiber now that you mentioned it.
---
Where is the purveyor?
---
Wow was not guessing it would go that good... just the other day was getting shot in the back for using train station vendor and making higher level player wait.
---
&gt; I started a new character on survival and I am being killed mostly by people with TSE weapons it seems. Its not fucking survival if you enter at level 100+ with all your duped gear or duped gear you got for cheap. Does everybody who has a TSE duped? No. I bet a majority of them were though. I would have zero problems starting another character from level 1 if they implemented this.
---
The problem with the solution to the primary complaint here is that even if they made everyone start a fresh character for survival, there will always be those that get ahead and become the alpha and they will always be there to rape the newbs. So noobs will still always have a hard time. 
---
I feel the way it. currently is at least allows people to prepare to go in and face those alphas.
---
This is one of those aspects of a game that simply cannot please all players. There is notbikg they could do to satisfy very ones opinion on this.
---
If you was on PC I’d have offered you some melee weapons like Bloodied swing speed grognak’s axe or power fist.
---
Anyone handing out canned dog food and purified water while you wait in line?
---
Great thanks for the answer
---
Before vending came out, but after reading about it on here, I decided my shower was pesky for mutants. So my main vending is outside and fine, but there's a second vending in my bar (filled with recipes and drinks and candies, of course). To get to my bar folks have to go up through my house and that forces them through a rad shower at the top of the stairs. I like the location, and it's my camp. But I don't want to be a jerk. So I bought neon letters and the small letters so I could put up warnings before players ran through unsuspecting. I'm hoping this weekend I'll have time to see if I can add some outer stairs up to my bar so people can avoid the shower altogether if they want. It's just that darn camp budget always being maxed out.
---
Double, I believe. 100 scrip for 3* versus 50 script for 2* weapons
---
Why would I make something like that up.
---
Fair enough, Though I think if that is what they wanted, they shouldn't have tied the camera and bucket list to a random encounter.
---
I had a blood bug teleport into my locked, steel generator room, and proceed to explode my fusion generator. Sealed room, locked door, still closed.
---
Updated price list, or from pic earlier this week. Stuck at work /sadface
---
Ah... I get you. I thought you meant don't buy armor from purveyor incase you get wood. But tbf, you probs shouldn't but 3 star armor from her if wood can be rolled... obvs another bug that needs to be ironed out. We should be used to it not working how it's supposed to right away by now ha!
---
Ok... Good to know. Thanks
---
Part of me wishes we could tame a scorchbeast and ride it.  Rain down sonic fury across all those who wronged me. Turn all of Appalachias creatures into my minions.
---
Wasteland is a rough place and if you aren't smart enough to figure out how to open doors with your mouth you aren't going to be around long enough to chase vault dwellers.
---
She doesn't scale. Same health pool and 70% damage reduction no matter how many people show up.
---
Good luck! If you set your build up on https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks and share it, I or others would be happy to give you tips that could help with your build!
---
If you're on Xbox I have a recipe in my vending machine, GT is badgerist :)
---
It was a joke. You know, like fake news, too good to be true. Just joshing you, my guy.
---
Bloodied Power Fist/Deathclaw Gauntlet with a full set of Unyeilding Armor does the best damage, next best would be a Bloodied Explosive ranged weapon!
---
Thanks! Let me know what you think. :)
---
Seems to me that they don’t really want people to play much. Just do the simple math. 150 scrip is 30 one star weapons, a WS run will always land you one or two multiple stars. If you server hop a little, all this can be done within an hour. Essentially that’s all Bethesda thinks we should spend on their game. In order to earn that 20 atoms for the 7600 hour challenge, you need to play casually like this for about 20 years. If you play more than that, sorry you’re on your own. Why would anyone buy atoms then buy stuff in the atom store if they are encountered to play less not more.
---
Took me reading something here to figure it out too... ;) Big relief when I did. 
---
SOOO much easier to take picture of deads than alives... :)
---
I'd just like to say what we are all feeling...... I kind of hate you.... lols
---
Modus Production has some mods for it
---
I’ve gotten drills at least 6 times... in recent memory. It’s pretty much always from a 3*. 
---
I’m more annoyed with the goddamn chameleon wood left leg. Always the left leg! If I want to be a tree I’m gonna need both legs.
---
Still convenient to have your camp near whitesprings....until someone nukes the area
---
I've seen the wiki say you can buy bulk screws but I've gone to every vendor it mentions and never found them, guess I'm just unlucky.
---
She deserves a daily AT LEAST. Or maybe some events around the map like modus has. Hopefully she has a large presence in wastelanders this fall.
---
My entire team of 4 found this camp that was SO awesome. The 4 of us spent at least 15 minutes there just walking (well, marsupialing) around admiring it. The owner showed up and gave us a confused emote, we replied with hearts. He logged off. I think he thought we were going to attack but in reality the entire time was just us "This is SO COOL" "Look at this!" "I wish I thought of that!" etc.
---
I have a separate vending machine dedicated to what i call "collectibles" found in f76. I collected a few robot models such as the sentry boy, eyebot, protectron, gutsy and even an inbred of all robots and I placed them inside my vending machine. I added other things like Snallygaster's spit attack, Scorched ashes, a "Stogie" that i found on a dead body, a red star pin that i found on a liberator robot and a bunch of Camden park items. I also have a few musical instruments like the violin, accordion and a harmonica. It just makes it fun for me to have little things like that haha! But i love your idea of the giddyup buttercup collectibles! =D
---
Don’t take less than 25k for it. It’s worth a lot especially to heavy weapons users or make sure you get yourself a really nice melee weapon you want :)
---
Thank you. I use imgur for pictures then just paste the link here.
---
Good job. I just finished listening to the one you shared. Do you plan on putting those on a podcast feed?
---
Probably not.
---
/u/jessbethesda still awaiting on a response.
---
It's honestly driving me insane at this point. Really tired of it.
---
This is true, if they have access to the right resources and plan accordingly.. it just seems than many/most don't. Just going to drop this here in case anyone wants to avoid making mistakes with their build! https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks
---
Rolling 3* is absolute waste IMO. All of the minor 3rd perks you can roll are very small and don’t really matter
---
I've been trying to figure out the best legendary combination to take her on and do as much damage as possible.  Currently I'm going to try for as much armor penetration as I can get on my weapons, then hope for faster reload and firing rate(+1 Str and +40% swing speed for melee).  
---
I don't really know the return on investment for AP in this game, or on the SBQ specifically, unfortunately.
---
How much would one go for you think - obviously depends but range would be cool
---
Ok really Nice tho... Guess i was Lucky with the purveyor😁
---
Chunk dueces on you fool 😊
---
I feed off hate. Why else would I do this?
---
Yea i have been waiting for this question
---
On average just like in like people are courteous enough to one another. Yet every so often you run into an asshole. While I’m not a fan of the slap damage I have used it to piss of someone who decided to keep hitting me while I was using the vender. 
---
Just sat there letting my auto stims pop and laughing.
---
That’s weird as hell, item has major and minor legendary affix but no prefix.
---
Very lucky I’d like one of these myself :)
---
Nice work! Yes the purveyor delivered...tonight should be very interesting in player vending world..players need to not hoard and sell and trade to benefit themselves more..I update my 4 machines daily.
---
genius!
---
For what it's worth, I'd spend 60 on a 2 star rather than 100 on a 3 star. The odds of getting a beneficial 3rd effect are pretty slim, so why waste the extra 40 scrip?
---
oh lol I’d still plan on rebuying it to see how much has changed and gotten better. Haven’t played since it first came out.
---
Heya! Thanks. :) I am indeed. Working on Episode 2 now, but I'm pending approval from iTunes. The website with RSS feed is almost done.
---
It would make sense back when it was released, but now? 99% of people on Reddit own the game for a while now and couldn't be refunded anyway.
---
My biggest problem with this however is that even in the advertising, Bethesda kinda hinted at it being raid-like. The preview video had a team of players in full power armor and heavy guns/melee. Like, idk how they could suggest difficulty any more than outright saying so. Bethesda has had a bit of an issue with their advertising these past few times and they need to make sure that it’s clear what the intended groups these content updates are for to make sure expectations are within range. Anyways. Looking forward to it, need to get my heavy guns/power armor character ready
---
No. Unless they allow us to turn plans for scrip
---
Yeah, I’ve put a lot of effort into Camp Plans haha
---
Cute and cuddly you say?
---
I preordered the tricontinental edition.
---
Time is not an issue.
---
Playtime might, but bethesda has been inconsistent on that policy.
---
I bought a TSE gauss from someone's vending machine last night for 5500.
---
Makes me wonder if that’s why so many 2 and 3* enemies have been giving junky loot. They’re giving items that are *supposed* to be 3*, but aren’t.
---
Oh maybe, I've never thought to sell them because I always need them
---
Its like playing the lotto. U just got lucky which folks will need to be to get something good.
---
Did get some naughty drops out of her to be fair so she fits her purpose, could've just done it through the Scrip Machines though would be much more efficient
---
Got it! 
---
Eh, 200% repair was a nerf
---
I saw the dense mod in there yesterday. Going to jump and buy up and many as I can
---
I'm happy that you are enjoying the game and I hope you get much more enjoyment out of it.
---
All junk stuff. 
---
But people are buying so my junk legendarys because I don't have any more scrip for the day.
---
It is what it is.
---
Yeah I’ve done 3 different dailies that aren’t the 3 on there &amp; none showed up sooo lol
---
Wow, kudos to you for thinking of that!  ...brilliant
---
My first character got lulled into hoarding so his build was fine but not great, propped up by TSE then bloodied, now I have two specced out characters, one melee, and one commando!
---
That was like 10% right?
---
Agreed, was not sure what was being disallowed but the rocket ban makes sense...
---
I love when I get a nocturnal wood right leg
---
Thanks! Time to server hop I think
---
I can’t wait to get a three star legendary rolling pin.
---
I have a lvl35 DB with the same 3, vamp explosive reload speed.  I'm on pc... send me a message later and maybe we can work something out
---
Once your ap regen is so high, you can jump and watch your AP fully refill before you hit the ground anyway.
---
Yep. I would consider that an awesome roll for my my bloodied PvE commando.
---
Really? I didn't say random stuff. I mean specific things with specific values.
---
I doubt you know what tricontinental means.
---
So you bought a game back in October and asked for a refund now ?
---
Thanks sorry you bought it at launch I got it on sale for 30 lol
---
Personal preference on my part. I don't like how PA looks and generally don't haul junk around all the time so I don't need them. And with the new backpacks, I need PA even less for carrying stuff. Only if I really want to do a nuked WS run, but I never do those. SBQs are generally well placed so that even non-PA/hazmats can join.
---
I was hoping on a AA handmade for my second character and i just Got that to so I'm super stoked now
---
No, its fine as is.
---
Berkley springs in the mire, the train station right as you spawn in after fast travel.
---
Nice one man! GG hope I get as lucky 😂
---
Sigh. Someone loves their bloodied effect. Junkies is one of the few effects that could replace the current meta if bloodied gets nerfed.
---
my 3 star attempt sucked (Stalker's Cryolater) so you might be on to something there..
---
You can find some for under 3k sometimes. Depends on the weapon. Most go for 5k +++. 
---
You can get lucky in vending machines sometimes. I found a max level TSE in a machine for 1500. 
---
I have a level 35 version with the same 3 stars.  On pc.  Send me a message if u want to discuss further
---
I’d pay scrip right now for a plasma grenade plan, gamma gun plan or the stone benches plan lol
---
My friends and I drop up to two a day because we have not much else to do, but I imagine it's just really not worth it to a lot of folk. Go through a lot of ammo for a crappy legendary unless you get really lucky. 
---
Better off doing West Tek, run through WS, and even Camp Adams at night.
---
You can get an AAE or AA25 handmade easily for the .50 Cal
---
Someone didn't listen to the Overseer's stern warning for us at Fort Defiance.
---
I’ve seen bulk screws at white spring vendors.
---
I'm a heavy weapon build on my primary so I'm always in PA for that Stabilized perk.
---
I see the problem you have here. It is because it’s actually *insert
---
ooh! What kind of things are you looking for?!
---
My favourite guy did the skooled zone no mods shop class  but alas it's not as applicable in 76
---
I predict new loot is going to be a few CAMP items, likely more taxidermy as well. Nothing super insane.
---
Modus Armory has scout armor mods also or maybe it’s the only one?
---
Thanks for the tip. BTW do you know if they can be learned by scraping pieces or do I need to find a plan?
---
Well, you’re seeing those posts because people are excited that they got something good. Nobody makes a post about the mediocre legendaries they got. Can’t really deduce anything about drop rates from that.
---
I didn’t even need that honestly. The barely-there water at the edge of the pool at the golf course works. Seems like as long as your toes get wet you’re fine, even if you haven’t gotten deep enough to take Rads. 
---
BUT as a precaution that wouldn’t be a bad thing to look for.
---
Yes, she has instanced loot. Each player can loot her... but..
---
That is assuming she doesn’t bug. I have gotten constant spinning load circle. There is also this absolute stupid mechanic where you have to do X% of damage to her in order to loot her, I think it’s 10% of her insane total health. So, those of us clearing mobs to keep them off the backs of our bloodied brothers so they can wreck her when she lands? We get NADA. 
---
You should still get the Event drops though... assuming it didn’t bug as well.
---
I know you're getting down voted, but I would love to see a server with ramped up difficulty like Fallout 4's Survival mode. Something that would make West Tek, Whitespring and Fort Defiance into true nightmares.
---
That's what the edition for 79,99 was called, might be misspelling it tho sorry.
---
Yes, Yes I did, and both by bethesdas policy and the law I am entitled to the refund and received that refund.
---
That's why I'm highliting that if you do not give up Bethesda does at least in my instance end up giving you the refund they owe you.
---
That heavy rocket is for the regular sledge the super sledge only has one mod and that heated coil
---
It's all your fault for upvoting my post
---
No longer necessary... Just pulled it... Only had enough for 3 weapons Got the 50 cal first, then a ghoul slayers handmade and a aae handmade as final one
---
It's alright I got a couple cool things but it seems to be rolling a lot of heavy weapons and the new legendary armor is to die for cant wait to build a setup using it.
---
Can confirm.
---
Definitely more valued imo for 30.
---
I preordered to support the company I loved and still do love, I have hopes for the future even if their track record is pretty muddy right now
---
from a Dev standpoint, it's probably a good thing..reducing the amount of Legendary items in play can only help stability..
---
..for us the players....the RNGesus is still a cruel bastich
---
Neither. You have to buy the mods themselves from the enclave military wing. And they wont tell you what they apply to. So you'll need to trial and error 5 different polymer mods....might be you get 3 for chest. Have fun. I spent a whole day buying and modding one set
---
Keep your ears open for wind chimes. You can interact with wind chimes and it'll give you random amounts of aluminum scrap.
---
I’ve not learned any plans by scrapping them... yet anyway.
---
Wait? You again! xD
---
Can confirm, again.
---
I guess it's in the fact that many people feel like they are turning their crap legendary weapons into more crap legendary weapons. So in a sense, the Purveyor is trolling them?   
---
I saw it on the forums and thought it was funny so I posted it here.
---
Good complementary addition of vending machines and farm
---
Dam you’re extremely lucky today wish I pulled something like that 😂
---
Obvious Dupes
---
People would place their camp at the back side of of the clubhouse and use sentries and rockets to draw all the ghouls out. It basically kept anyone else on the server from farming that location. 
---
The main retaliation, myself included was to nuke the camp to the ground. I had a twoshot fatman and a stack of mini nukes just for this. Since they made it so that camps could not be damaged, Bethesda smartly followed our pleas and banned camps from that position. If not for the ban, a camp would be permanently parked at the clubhouse on every server in no time.
---
Kinda looking for a good combat rifle tight now, and good weightless armor.  I don't want to clog up this thread with negotiations, but you can message me stuff you have if you want
---
No offense but I would be embarrassed to ask for a refund 6 MONTHS later. They probably gave your money back so you can stop barking at their door.
---
  Also, you bought that edition and didn't even know what it means?
---
One of the most duped items ever
---
\*looks at wooden armor piece\*  
---
Oh, how I wish that were true.  
---
(One wood, three scout armor, five Trapper pieces... she does not like me it would seem.)
---
You really should checker out.
---
Yeah man I hear you on that but keep your head up glad you got your refund ! See you in elder scrolls 6 (;
---
Will do when I get home for work!
---
Most likely...was on day one of player vending.
---
It's not really, just progression for the order and sweet exp. This is a new character after a long break, 3rd total and I'm sick of being out leveled on easy missions.
---
I got a bloodied gatling plasma with 90% less weight (1,8) and +50% limb damage. It's godlike in scorchbeast queen fights.
---
Best of all, unlike the disgusting berserker's gatling plasma I had, I don't have to strip down to my underwear to use it!
---
I Guess she loves me or something  😂 I'm gonna buy me some lotery tickets quickly
---
One word- excellent. I did 1015 scrip on 3 star armour and picked up 7 awesome pieces
---
Haha awesome /s
---
they should do a no limit weekend so people can stock up and drop all their old hoarded goods...
---
This will never be a thing. Because they would have to upload every photo you want to display, and send them to _every single_ user on a map, on world load. Or as a pack during updates. 
---
Filtering out obscene content (because camera photos can be faked) would be a non-trivial issue.
---
Well I'd better stop buying them then 😂
---
Thanks I'll check it out
---
Still think pipe weapons should give a screw or two though.
---
My stepdad plays like it's a full time job. But he's old and a little slow on technology so getting him to understand that you don't need to shut off the Xbox entirely to leave the game has been a struggle. I'm on occasionally but he could use a few people to play with. We live stateside on the east coast
---
I keep a Camp south of Whitesprings on the golf course as a rest stop for other players farming ghouls, with workbenches, plenty of food and water to grab, and a handy mutation station and rad shower.
---
I would've been very heartbroken, after all the work I put in to make it convenient for other players, to just have my camp blocked. Thankfully it's still there and can continue to serve weary travelers with an easy means to their stash instead of going into the building.
---
Bu bye nobody cares
---
I ran into a Mothman, literally, the other day. Was night-time in game and I was roaming the woods exploring new areas. Ran face-first into him and it startled the hell out of me, lol.
---
Only level 46 so he wrecked my shit and I had to walk a long way back to get my junk. :(
---
She definitely loves you probably her favourite customer today 😂
---
I got an explosive quad pipe bolt action if anyone is interested 😂
---
Damn son and people were bitching about it being pointless and a waste lol.
---
They be the ones using brahminshit jet.
---
Wait...
---
Yeah when I was doing it I just made sure I was in the water but not so deep that your buddy can’t click to res you haha.
---
Do it yourself, you lazy muppet
---
I got a few things that are decent but not really tailored to my character, the only thing I might use is an explosive, 90% reduced weight, 20% damage suppression lever-action. Lot of stuff was ghoul slayer, couple of increased bash damage, vampire stuff too.
---
I just got a Sentinel's Assassin Wood piece... are you telling me that if I log off I'm going to lose that? What can I do about that? Will a screenshot be sufficient to get the item back into my inventory if something goes wrong?
---
Ha! Old people, am I right? We need a "Teach Technology to Old People" program, don't we, fellow young gamers?!
---
these are the times we miss slap damage------ :(
---
31 rolls for 1\*, 0 handmades. At this point, I'm trying to replace my lvl 35 1\* Handmades with lvl 45 Handmades. Now I'm standing outside, overencumbered and not sure what to do. My daily Scrip has been used up.
---
I paid for a 3* and didn't pay close attention to what they were becasue... Well, it's garbage no matter what. 
---
I just logged back in and now it's a Salvaged Assaultron head - 25% faster fire rate and faster movement while aiming. 2*
---
I doubt this was intentional, but I also feel like we're automatically going to lose. They may fix it later, but we aren't going to see the benefit.
---
The ap jump has been a fallout thing for awhile now, not sure why it needs to change all the sudden.
---
I don't know about you all.... but I'm still hoarding mine until this comes out 😅
---
hi sorry im on ps4
---
After getting a full set of 3* unyielding, my non- melee bloody build can pretty much kill anything with melee.. only issue I've got is when fighting the queen, she finally lands I get some shots in, but my 20% health quickly disappears because of the rads she puts off!
---
Worse, half the time it decided to spawn me inside the nuked area multiple times, while I'm outside of power armor..
---
With all the nerfs and everything else going on, my build.. I'm just not as confident in it. That and never being able to get unyielding that's actually heavy.. just made of glass, I die far more than I remember! (That's with dodgy, serendipity, and blocker!)
---
I have the same problem but I play in French.
---
A translation problem or just Beth being lazy? All the new quest subtitles are in english as well as well as all the new scout challanges.And this is not the first time either after every new update all the new stuff is always in english.
---
It's your faults for upvoting my post!
---
I got an explosive lever, but...... it’s nocturnal
---
Ooooo. I kinda like that idea. Stash size could increase with stats some and the cards could be used to allow us to do other things maybe.
---
Bonus points for the Airplane Flying Handbook.
---
Someone told me it’s loading lag.  The game loads all static world spawns then slowly removes the ones that are gone on that server.  Sometimes why you see mobs load up and die in front of you.  I’m no expert thou
---
I’m level 14... and I’m going up against level 40 and 50 mole miners. No need to be such an asshole
---
If you are on xbox I would buy it or trade you something for it, I have some extra weightless pieces I think
---
Rifleman
---
She treats me well and i love her for it 😂
---
Yes, agree with a higher limit. I'm standing outside overencumbered, stash full, daily Scrip used up. I practically can't play the game until tomorrow...
---
Hotkey diluted radaway to take whilst hitting the Queen, and I find the dodgy perk helps to avoid a good junk of her rads!
---
While the alcohol challenges were annoying, i could do all of them. Now i can't do half of them with the new camera challenges. But that's the point, to stop earning free atoms and go spend some cash on their store. It's not unreasonable when you think about how much content they dropped in the past 2 months
---
Well apparently elsewhere in this [thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/bpepgi/psadont_buy_armor_with_scripwood_reverts_to_1_star/enskim1/) Assaultron Heads only have 2 legendary slots and exhibit similar behavior (3* turns to 2*).
---
Not power armor parts. The reason we can craft excavator, X-01, and Ultracite is because we can't find them out in the world. Raider and all of the T-Series can be found quite easily all over. No one should need to craft the parts.
---
This is a great idea!
---
Not sure if this is the same issue, but sometimes when I'm just first loading into the game or if the server is laggy, everything will spawn in and then the game figures out that the item has already been looted, either by me or recently by another player, and then de-spawns it. I usually get the prompt to pick it up, but nothing happens. This happens almost daily with me with the clipboard and bobby pins in the podium at the entrance to the Whitespring.
---
If you're submitting multiple tickets for the same issue you're moving your ticket to the back of the queue each time you enter another one. So possibly that.
---
There are some of us who honestly have too many.  Ive let a tse10mm go for 600. After the nerf they're not  so valuable. Cheap Tse handmades are suspicious though
---
Riflegaming is my guess
---
u sure man? couldn't find any info on the wiki
---
I know what it means, dont see how its relevant tho.
---
Why would you be embarrassed to excercise something that is your right as a customer? There's nothing wrong with giving it some time and observing what bethesda does against the bugs expoits etc and how they respond to other consumers complaints.
---
There's nothing wrong with making sure your decision to withdraw is what you want.
---
I rarely refund games, mostly wheni do refund games it's the game itself but also how the pub/dev handles customers.
---
I just don't feel like I can support Bethesda as it stands.
---
Even if I still have fond memories.
---
i see this when i first load into an area, its like the game knows there is supposed to be resources/things in that area, so when you first load in, they are shown in a  "ghost" state
---
i mean "ghost" state because i think if someone got there before you and looted the things, then you load in,you see those "ghost" images of the items, it even gives a prompt to pick them up, but you can click a million times but it wont let you pick them up, then all of a sudden they just disappear
---
tldr- i think maybe what is happening is someone got there before you, looted the stuff, and the game streaming is just catching up when you load into that area
---
this is just my theory!
---
following
---
Would make sense. I must be incredibly unlucky though. I t's been two days and I can't get cement from there lol.
---
Instead, try farming abandoned bog town workshop for concrete.
---
You could play an opponent. They bring the materials, join your team and build a set they can move in camp mode!
---
Thanks for letting me know you care &lt;3
---
Damnit. As a sniper who really wants a good hunting rifle I'm so jealous.
---
Bolstering is mostly loved by folks with Bloodied weapons: keep a low health, your Bolstering gives you DR and your weapon hits harder.
---
Or paint for the outside of your camp like camo,
---
well shit!!!
---
so far we thought it was limited to only wood armor pieces doing that!!!
---
this is... not good
---
Yeah, I'm just sharing my experience, which is close to what most people probably felt, right?
---
I wasn't being obnoxious, rude, or even excessively whiney - so why I'm downvoted to zero?  Makes no sense...
---
It seemed cool, but in the end, I got essentially zero reward for days of grinding...
---
What worked for me was to head north to the monument, then go from there up to the civil war cemetery, then to jump servers and visit both locations again. And again and again. 
---
It still takes a long time, but you're not wasting time on a lot of travel or caps on fast travel.
---
3 star armor is only 60
---
I wish everyone would sell more recipes/plans. Of course many we already know, but you never know what recipe/plan someone else doesn’t have.
---
Commando if it’s automatic
---
Do you plan to sell your new stuff back for srip?  Or vender sell it to others?
---
not me but just sharing the info... 👍🏻
---
got some explosive suppression weapons but not two shot :( hopefully tomorrow, as I'm out of scrip and cant get anymore as reached 150 cap for today.
---
Quad, faster fire rate, less vats cost double barrel was the best I got out of 5 rolls. 
---
AA harpoon with less vats and more damage while ADS was runner up but I already have an instigating explosive vats cost harpoon
---
Yet we can find plans for non-quest PA rarely through Treasure Maps, so what's the point of that?
---
Ah hes SO stubborn though. He will look me in the eyes and listen to what I have to say and watch ad I show him, and STILL does the opposite
---
I’m also trying to do this! PSN WouldUKindlyyy
---
Other side note, sometimes items don’t regenerate for you the player for more than 24 hours... another oddity.  Cement thou, go to the general stake house.  In the garden out back there are 6 gnomes? They scrap down to multiple cement per... in a pinch
---
New building materials would be welcome too. Different colored brick, painted wood, Red Rocket themed metal, etc.
---
Pipe weapons pointless existence? Gt: nasezentaur60 I kill you with ease with my pipes
---
Alright I'm adding you right now. I'll be on later tonight!
---
Yep, done one nuke myself on PC. Well, Harper's Ferry was more interesting than the Purveyor. Also the nuke got rid of the queued people ;)
---
I think its only happening with wood armor, and I guess this assaultron head, but from what I see every othwr type is fine and doesnt lose stars.
---
I spent 1000 scrip just now got 3 items to use and 2 more to sell, had good luck or rng is better
---
Lol.... I just have a team leader who is too lazy to turn off half of them.  So I end up with a screen full of his crap. Would love to turn it off!!
---
This is just more manual work that could be optimized with automation within the system.
---
Ouch. Big paper bag full of 1* guns?
---
What quests are you doing then, maybe try to level up some more
---
Any marine armor with RR?
---
Ive seen a few of these posts. Not touching this vendor anytime soon. Just absurd, another disappointing update.
---
The silhouette icon under the Wastelanders dlc made me think that could be an option.
---
It's still a net positive - it was fun earning "Scrip", and I did level up about five times grinding out enough Lengendary items to earn the 1,000.
---
But, on the other hand, that was a ***lot*** of grinding to end up without one single cool thing from the vendor.
---
I've noticed this as well. If I get a bloodied or unyielding piece I'll stay on that server a while
---
When doee the update drop?
---
Saw the machine to the right of the door at Berkley Springs in an article on-line, but when I go to Berkley Springs, it is NOT there, just empty space.  The door is no open, but no vendor is present HOWEVER when I go up to the window I get the prompt to “Trade” with a vendor who is either not there, or invisible.  Verified all my game files and still not working.  Perchance is there is previous step I have missed to turn something on?
---
I don't know they would allow that because of how the purveyor gives out randomized stuff, plus they gave vendors more plans than before. I think it would be helpful for specific plans like you said though
---
Looking for this also, psn buddistdeath
---
It just works... 🤡
---
Poison resistance is actually pretty helpful if you like fighting mirelurk queens. If I got that on a nice unyielding combat or marine piece I'd be pretty stoked.
---
You legit deleted your post because you can't take criticism, you are pathetic
---
Ankle deep is enough. We jumped off the bridge at senaca rocks and aimed for the edge of the water right by the land. It worked
---
Depends on how high your expectations are. If you're looking for one particular high level piece of armour, or a God roll 3* weapon, you will be most likely disappointed. If however you just want an additional weapon with a single particular effect, swing speed or faster reload , then it's a little more likely you will eventually get something worthwhile. Personally, I think it'll be a place I'll visit every day, but only because it's an additional vendor that has a unique set of available items. Will there be a queue out the door? Unless it's me and my teammates all seeing who gets the boobie prize today, I don't  think so.
---
You are right it is millitary wing actualy and they are there.
---
Yes. I'd trade all my scrip right now for shielded raider underarmor plan.
---
Sucks, but at least you can return them for ~40% scrip back!
---
quick question too, did they increase the vendors amount of money yet?
---
Huh?
---
It's not uncommon for a piece of coding to act one way when being tested on a local server and a completely different way when live. I design websites for a living and I swear it happens to me a full half of the time.
---
I won't deny that it's annoying as hell, because it absolutely is, but it's just the nature of the beast.
---
What?
---
I never deleted my post.
---
What are you talking about?
---
Probably not. It was only a 2 star, not the 3 star version that was heavily duped.
---
Half of the population on Xbox can’t even beat a queen &amp; nuke zones are meh compared to West Tek, Uranium Fever or Whitesprings. Just literally server hop lol
---
I agree. I want ol prince to have some more space in his ["shrine"](https://screenshotscontent-d3001.xboxlive.com/xuid-2533274813737763-private/d5a195d6-c6b6-4c49-b5e5-aa8c6660d530.PNG?sv=2015-12-11&amp;sr=b&amp;si=DefaultAccess&amp;sig=p8zFBPTs8lC3UVVxoXdjzfW9CS6mq5mVadp1LDFg0xo%3D) I made in the shop.
---
they got camps on the golfcourses which is fine. it was the d-bags that had it behind clubhouse with rockets pouring into it
---
Man I guess I should hold off on this
---
Please god yes but I’m gonna use that doc for sure until then
---
Yes you did, don't deny it
---
I used 500 and got a decent mini gun that has the reduced weight and increased damage with mutations. Everything else was hot garbage.
---
1*?
---
yeah turned in 3.. got another useless wep lol
---
It's almost like he's trolling you.
---
Ah now i see, opening it while not logged in, mods apparently removed my post, oh well'
---
Thanks for letting me know
---
It does on PS4 for sure.  I can't test XB1 and PC.
---
see that is nice, 5MM ammo is easy to amass with ammosmith+super duper.
---
I am planning on using the same/similar method you did. 2 star ranged and 3 star armor. Roughly the same amount of scrips too.
---
Been out a few weeks. Newer event.
---
Just read the same thing about an assaultron head. So apparently its not just wood armor.
---
Getting refunded for an online game is like asking for a refund on the meal you ordered at and after decided you don't like it.
---
Someone sold a 3 star sentinel piece for 1k...? The markets gonna break though!!!
---
I don’t blame them. If they tried to implement NV stuff it would turn out like [this.](https://i.imgur.com/e0ORfFe.jpg)
---
Oh gorram, Bethesda.....
---
Nice. I cant wait to see what I get when I get off work. It's all I'm gonna do now. I'm gonna be addicted to seeing what I can get lol
---
Playing devil's advocate here (for a reason), none of those characters were level 40, they were all using carry weight and crafting perks because that's what they had chosen, and the guy in the cool power armor with the minigun was using it to bash because he never found any ammo for it.  In other words, a fairly typical random 4 player team :P
---
Don't hang your expectations on a publicity photo/video.  And don't read between the lines of the announcement, just read what it says.  You'll (probabably) be less disappointed if you take their words at face value...and you may be pleasantly surprised if you get what you want, instead of what they stated they're giving you.
---
Ads are not meant to give you what you want, they're meant to get you to buy things.  Outright lying isn't smart (and is sometimes illegal), but leaving things open to - admittedly overly optimistic - interpretation is standard operating procedure.  That's the way the world works, unfortunately.  No reason to think Bethesda operates any differently than any other company.
---
Happened to me a few times.   Were you doing a lot of treasure maps or scrapping?  That was the only common factor I could think of when it occurred with me.  That is, a ton of notifications in the top left would have been showing but it got overwhelmed.
---
Seriously. I just started playing again last week after months of not following anything related to the game and *I* knew this would happen. It’s inconceivable they didn’t. 
---
But BSG I’m willing to continue putting in the same amount of effort as I do now (maybe even more!) staying on top of what the community wants in exchange for a salary. 
---
I’ll spend 20 minutes a week sorting by top and copy/pasting the most upvoted comments and posts that aren’t memes or photos into a document for your review.
---
Good. The mods are doing they're job here
---
After using the flame thrower in pa for a good while last night there is no way stabilized is function properly with energy heavys.
---
Plasma projectiles look super cool in vats though, they curve to the target if they're moving. 
---
I picked up some plasma rifles for cheap before the patch buffed them, Instigating and AA, and with rifleman vats perks, its still a lot of fun.
---
I got the AA for when it's hopefully fixed in the future.
---
I'm not one to care about the absolute best dps in the game though, if it kills something in a reasonable amount of time, and I like it, i'll use it. 
---
They definitely need the appropriate perks to be more viable though.
---
Nope  
---
 [https://i.imgur.com/om68hLI.png](https://i.imgur.com/om68hLI.png)   
---
I guess my post breaks some unwritten rule to not talk about refunds of Fo76
---
To your point, i think the game is in a much better position than when it was released. They actually add content and listen to the community.Hell, a lot of added stuff were asked by the community.  Too bad you couldn't enjoy.
---
Added
---
Haha well if its any consolation, that will be me later tonight when I log in! Excited for a new drill!
---
ok thank u
---
Wait did they finally make tamed animals immortal now? Also you at the player cant hurt your animal only enemies and other players can
---
If anyone on xbox gets junkie weapons, let me know. I may be interested
---
This more or less proving my "Seeded RNG" Theory, I got 6 pieces of 3* wood armor out of ten hand in's
---
I had an encounter with an injured Super mutant and a few dead ones with quills stuck in them. Walked down the street a bit and ran into one.
---
My stash is already a bloody mess.
---
the marvel version of Death, he's got a bit of a crush
---
wood armor can be gotten.. and its bugged lol.. classic beth
---
I've got dodgy, serendipity, and blocker.. on PS4 the radial wheel takes far too long to be effective, most of the time it takes more than one try to even select the right thing.. it's probably the worst feature on console.
---
Accuracy, not range. As long as you Aim down sights it has very little change in deviation, however.
---
Just want to note: Taking/holding a workshop flags you AND your team for PvP. Greifers often take advantage of that to kill people for fun on the regular Adventure worlds.
---
Since OP mentioned they were newish, I don't want them to get caught off guard while owning a workshop
---
Well If your food was littered with bugs and cold, im sure you'd also request your money back.
---
It's fine if you like the game, I'm not a fan of how broken it was and is and how they handled customer complaints.
---
Congrats !
---
I would respec into a shotgun build with that baby! Also slap a drum mag on there too!
---
Honestly, one of the best dps rolls in the game.
---
Worth 15k+ easily, or most trades that you'd want.
---
Not really no. Just the same old crap. A 3* walking cane. Awesome.
---
Yes it appears to be the wooden armor and this specific weapon.
---
Not really considering my post broke no rules.
---
while plenty of peoples hateful responses did.
---
The two plans I would consider paying for with scrips would be the ultracite Gatling laser plan and shielded BOS UA plan. That’s about it.
---
it's legit terrifying
---
We had a group killing the queen last night and got her down to about 5-10% health left and that bitch just disappeared! Never to be seen again. And the lv50 SB that we did kill I got nothing from. Then another Lv. 80 SB shows up but everyone had left. Then I was like well lets get some farming done and collected a ton of plants but never got any of the glowing mass to make the stable flux. Was a waist of a lot of time and ammo.
---
I bought a 3 star weightless powered sentinel combat arm for 500 caps yesterday. Fuck knows what the market is right now.
---
Lower armour weight=better sneak
---
Lower weapon weight=less vats cost
---
To get the exact 3 star ranged weapon you want, it’s about a 0.001 percent chance, if everything drops uniformly. Based on player experiences so far, that’s not the case and the stalker legendary effect spawns more often. Therefore, your chances might be 0.0001 percent to get that 3 star gun you want.
---
And here come the posts from bethesda employees.
---
Cool, thank You!
---
I mainly use a pipe pistol too, but I wouldn't say they're worth picking up, even in low levels.
---
I really hope so. It'd be pretty cool way to fit in companions if Bethesda really doesn't want human npcs.
---
I'm sorry to do this to you but... AA doesn't effect energy weapons. Limb damage does not increase damage at all, it just makes it easier to cripple.
---
So you pretty much got a tesla gun with agility. It's bad.
---
A good tesla roll would have any of quad, bloodied, two shot, furious, attack speed, etc
---
NONE
---
It would be sent back right away. I wouldn't have eaten it then demanded my money back.
---
Some of those things are used in daily/world challenges. That could explain some of it. I've been selling the bug parts that are needed for the insect repellent since farming those is a pain.
---
Medics might become a pretty important stat if these end game dungeons need groups and a consistent way to heal.
---
1k
---
Has anyone dumped ammo in the SBQ got her dead and upon reaching the corpse got nothing? This has happened to me  twice and at first I thought, well maybe I didn't dump enough ammo in to her. Last night, I broke a combat Shotgun and burned through 900 5.56 ultracite rounds. I did get the standard event completed awards but no loot
---
Thanks! Finally found a replacement for my All Rise.
---
restart
---
Then how are you gonna say the markets going to be ridiculous....? I’m saying the market is NOT going to be ridiculous because the scout armor is really not even good.. just collector shit. If you pay over 5k for a piece you’re a clown that’s all I have to say haha
---
&gt;as soon as I saw the instigating hardened hunting rifle the bodies disappeared 
---
I’ve had that happen to me too, but every time it’s happened, the body disappeared and a meatpile appeared, with the same loot (although maybe once or twice it may have been different loot, idk. It felt like it was)
---
Dayum
---
Wait for servers.
---
The only useful item for my build is the vanguard combat armour.
---
But I'll resell or turn the rest in for scrip
---
I do have hope for the future and don't at all put it out of the question to check out bethesdas next game.
---
I am happy that there's people who decided to stick with it and are happy with their choice, dont let my choice sour yours
---
I would like the challenges to have a section in the pipboy rather than the map
---
Yeah and that, just so screens aren't clogged with someone else's laziness
---
What will you do for players who lose a piece of armor in this fashion? Out of the 2000 scrip I just dropped, the wood piece is by far the best thing I got; I'd really hate to lose it!
---
I just died after a SBQ fight and almost 13 seconds later my stable flux was stolen :/
---
I do kinda wish there was an option for choosing lower level gear for alts
---
There is definitely something to this. In the last two weeks I've had it happen three times. Once with vanguard armor, once with exterminator armor and once with bloodied weapons, three of each on consecutive enemies.
---
Just server hop at waves Willard’s... and you’ll eventually find the tourists body.. he spawns leaning up against the first car in the parking lot from the gate
---
haha that is what i'm hoping for as well. Hoping to get a 3 star war drum to keep a raider look
---
Quite frankly, I was surprised the MREs weren't in the US Government drops.
---
I sold it back to legendary vendor cursing how much I lost in that deal. But not all so bad, I bought new 3 star legendary armor piece and it was raider leg with 20% ammo weight reduction that i didn't know even existed. It's so awesome, reduced 20 weight
---
Also "while aiming" actually just means you have the weapon drawn and not stowed. You don't actually need to aim down the sights for the effect.
---
Entitled? I think not, considering I paid for and preordered this game and it's still filled with problems. Their QA is shit. An optimist suggested it was because of an issue with the mystery pick lacking the tag that prevents explosive energy weapons, but that IS OBVIOUSLY THEIR FUCKING MISTAKE. It shouldn't be this hard to fix the fucking game, I'm honestly convinced I know how to use the Creation Kit better than some of the people working on "fixing" this game.
---
That would be great, don’t mind paying for them, I made the mistake of selling his lvl 10  armour and making him some lvl 20 painted pocketed metal armour. Forgot you need screws lol
---
Spot on observation on STR.  I can see why on the hoarding aspect it’s such a big deal.  Choices to make.  Same with so many mutations impacting STR. 
---
Why oh why though is END such an afterthought?  Seems like the not dying concept of END in a survival/shooter would be a valued stat.  5 characters and their END is either 2 or 3.
---
I really think it's cut content because of the responder quest at Morgantown with the camp and u see it in the trailers too
---
I picked 6 and got average to awfull stuff
---
I've server hopped probably 100 times at the giant tea pot..
---
Max LVL Junkies, exploding combat shotgun with faster reload
---
I have found several broken ones. But I need the plan to be able to fix them
---
Have you tried turning them off and back on?
---
There is a spot in the Forest where one is set up, mostly empty, and is CAMP placeable.
---
Enjoy.
---
And legendary Scout armor! And more Enclave quests!
---
I'd like to see something like a robot companion in game, I like the idea of being a wandering trader, and a robot that could hold extra items and protect you on your travels would be a sweet addition.
---
currently sitting on my stove
---
I found mine at a the battlefield cemetery can’t remember the name
---
I’ve had same issue.  Do you have to do the quest once from start (at defiance) to get it to work proper?  I think my current character never did it to completion with the powering up part at the vault.
---
If you always have to go to defiance... that was the problem in the first place!
---
That's my plan if I get any Wood armor, just throw it straight back into the machine and (hopefully) get the 3 Star value back.
---
Im wondering if the affects are still there but not showing?
---
Nuke zone gives better RNG, lol
---
No, you need to do the tourist quest to be able to fix them.
---
honestly.. i forgot all about it..
---
i need to make more film.. lol
---
Did they increase Stash size again?
---
Alright I'll try the other place. The YouTube video I found showed him at the tea pot but I'm not having any luck so I'll move on
---
I'm on PS4 as well, always slot important drugs like rafaway to the up/down/left/right and the less vital things on the diagonals!
---
Because people are collectors and will want full sentinel/assassin enclave scout set ups, and im guessing you must be on console? PC markets are much more brutal in their pricing. What I got earlier was a fluke beyond a fluke, someone who didnt know any better.
---
[Had the same thing happen at noon!](https://twitter.com/philimusprime/status/1129098266900074496?s=21) 
---
But this was on the civilized Adventure server. I bet there was a lot of line cutting in Survival...
---
I did get a god-ish weapon. 3* Vampire Explosive Reload Speed DB Shotgun. But I dropped 1k scrip and this is the only thing I'm keeping. Gonna sell/scrip the rest.
---
Would be good to know with my Anti Armor Tesla rifle.
---
You're not allowed to be critical, even when it's honest and polite. It's just a known for this sub.
---
VATS + melee used to be pretty fun. Now when I enter VATS, even with 3/4 AP, attack does nothing... my character just stands there.
---
They could add that in an update possibly. Probably just easier to have everything max lvl
---
Don't think so, but they've increased it twice so far.
---
Yeah I know. I'm trying to find him but he never shows up anywhere
---
I dont think that is a thing
---
Rare but I believe those are region specific. 
---
For instance on my 5th character I got shielded raider plan from one of rose’s quests!
---
Legendary scout armor is now a thing with the release of the Purveyor.
---
Yeah the bug is definitely an oversight. It’s pulling out of vending before the separate stash, as reflected in the craft bench.
---
spent 500 on 3 star weps.. and it was all useless :/
---
My knife went from 207 to 163
---
please tell me you go around looking like the Shoveler
---
I remember a robot companion from one of the animated trailers, so it is a possibility.
---
That's where I found him. He was draped over a picnic table to the left of the teapot.
---
Yea, they exist. Strange if you haven’t found on. The vox syringer is guaranteed to spawn at that one scientists lab.
---
I feel bad for laughing at that.
---
Server hop alternating between the cemetery and the Kelly monument. It's only like a cap to travel between them and you should find it in a few server jumps
---
Yeah. You can also craft them at a weapons workbench
---
I am not looking forward to being disappointed but.. meh.. whatever.. Ill roll the dice...
---
its not like I was going to use any of what i turned in anyway..
---
If the photography challenge were something like, Take a picture of an albino radstag or a Glowing Mirelurk Queen or something, that I could deal with, because it's just a matter of needing to look for it.  But this "take a photo of someone in a maid costume who's committing insurance fraud at Vault 76" is a bit much.
---
Anyone get any Power Armor legendary pieces?
---
It's only wood armor i believe
---
He is tough, that's for sure. What worked for me was picking one of his spawn points (I did the miner's memorial) and just server hopped until I got him. Took a bit of time..under an hour if I remember correctly.
---
How on earth do you think buying a game gives you any authority over their decisions? 
---
The (other) bugs have nothing to do with this significantly insignificant detail that you are harping about. 
---
If you can make a better game then by all means do it. Then you can have an army of nerds bitchimg at you over every tiny detail.
---
Live now
---
It seems the environment we trade in is as varied as the items we’re trading for.
---
Can’t wait for a crappy environment to match my loot lol
---
/r/outside
---
That would be awesome for my heavy weapons build. I have a 90% less weight fat man with my perks only uses 0.8 lbs. Lol it aggravates me that my hunting rifle weighs 20lbs. But my Gatling plasma weighs 1.8
---
i always had a furious/+1 end/+40% swing speed board for 3k on my vendor.. but no one buys it because the inspect is bugged unless im there.
---
Wolf horde is the best. each Alpha wolf is a legendary, and often drop 2* items.
---
Some guy yesterday was shooting it but nothing happen. Just now a guy smacked it with his axe but it did nothing.
---
It's a gamble but you never know. Still better than just getting random drops and you can scrip it all or just sell it
---
Would prefer a wider exclusion area
---
Also, clearly you don't know how to play the game, If you think backpackless 390 CW is top tier you need to go back to VTU.
---
That's when I would have went stealth and started tossing Orbital Strike Grenades.
---
I’ve seen a couple of posts concerning the assaultron head losing the primary star also. But that’s it so far.
---
It's already taken me like 100 server jumps haha but I'll try a different location
---
Yes you are, you are a negative criclejerker, all you do is hate and blame, while offering no constructive criticism, this sub is for the game and people who enjoy it. Frankly you just came to be a douche. Why would anyone who hates the game even be here in the first place.
---
Game has been out 5 months, that's past any feasible return policy.
---
I spent a week serving hopping at the water park, changed locations to Camden Park and got it on the third try
---
I feel you.. 500 scrip and only crapendaries
---
The dupe is probably a stability issue in it's self. But I agree I wish they told us more.
---
I'm on XB1 if you want to buy it.
---
Which stats do you want to know?
---
That is beside the point....I am talking about STASH. I am fine with my character weight.
---
Likely due to flag canOpenDoor=true on the actor entity.  /s?
---
Yes please, I'm waiting on this most of all.  I want great weapons, but I want my PA to be legendary most of all.
---
I’ve heard some murmuring about a dev room paintgun which, paints. 
---
From what i’ve heard tho it sounds buggy and different from what OP proposes
---
The best automatic weapons are bloodied weapons that have VATS modifiers, since that build revolves on chaining crits with 30+agility and luck. 
---
Reload speed doesn't stack with speed Demon so it's useless. Same with move speed while aiming. 
---
Weight reduction is godly, it could potentially save you 3 perk cards.
---
50 DR is nothing to sneeze at.
---
The stat rolls are pretty meh but better than nothing.
---
I got my current three star sledge from a mongrel horde. 40% faster swing, instigating, and some other effect that doesn’t really matter. Those first two make it a one shot on a lot of high level enemies
---
Philippi? I think that’s how it is spelled.
---
Oh man that makes total sense.
---
Its posts like this that make me wish bethesda would disable fast travel so you would have to walk everywhere.
---
Nuked whitesprings last night. Server got very full very fast. Things were spawning like they are supposed to, respawning like they should. It was good- till the raging arseholes showed up one-shotting everything and generally being douchenozzles.
---
A lot of people got great rolls from what I see on here and the two market subs
---
Oh no! nobody would ever do that! This is the internet so it must be 100% serious. The internet would NEVER lie to me
---
So do you have any idea how to reset your “seed”? Is it a good idea to log in/out between purveyor rolls?
---
Hahaha no.
---
This more or less proves my "Seeded RNG" theory, I got 6 wood armors out of 10 hand in's...
---
Inside the Vault sugestion: Hot fixes patch notes, we should know what is fixed, even minor things, dont need to be very specific, just some minor info.
---
They sure did but the caps carry over to every vender
---
Hah. They call it "unhealable scar tissue".
---
I call it callusses.
---
I prefer AWOL to horde, less traveling usually, but it doesn't always show up.  Kinda sad that Scorched Earth isn't even a good legendary farming option...  they really need to fix that, and that's why people are nuking the prime a lot less too.
---
Aren't stone benches available at the Whitespring always?
---
Yeah I tried everything but reinstalling. 
---
Btw it’s problem with location names, some enemy names just didn’t translate and even perk cards 
---
For Russian Sandman description says that “Using silencer makes ur stealth shots cause 50% more damage”
---
No info about NIGHT. I was so surprised when I realized why this perk didn’t work for me all the time
---
After server hopping with no luck, I just spent the caps and fast traveled to all the potential spawn locations on the map. Found it inside 10 minutes that way at Colonel Kelly Monument. Just have to be willing to spend the caps on fast travel
---
On the news sight when you log in it says “Go to Berkley Spring to meet the purveyor”.
---
Yes. Got 2 stars. Maybe it's just because the character is under level 5, but that was the result I got for sure
---
id throw em on the vendor but i got no stash weight, wish vendor had it's own weight system.
---
Well, he does spawn on the red car in front of the Whitespring's main doors too, so maybe hit that and if no luck, go to the memorial just down a bit from Whitesprings (you could run it in the amount of time it takes to fast travel) and if a no go, server hop and reverse it. Kill two spawns with one jump, so to speak.
---
Nope. Just combined all the various 200 cap limits in to one big pool usable at any vendor.
---
Multiplayer is a major part of the game, and the content should reflect that. Sure, they want you to spend money of atoms, but ultimately it's not their fault if solo players are too obstinate to cooperate with other players for the sake of completing challenges. The challenges we had post launch were mindless and stupid, they might as well have not existed. The ones following Nukashine were pretty unreasonable, and some later were either impossible or practically so. Now I think they are in a reasonable place, not mindless, but not impossible either, the only real issue I have with the current ones are the lack of variety (the 3 condition leveling one has only like 3 or 4 variations).
---
Everyone gets OKO'd in that event, no chance to get them up!
---
I had 730 scrip and only went for 2* ranged weapons as I'm not overly fussed about the third mod selection. Managed to pretty much replace all my current weapons.
---
A Furious Gatling Plasma that has 10% more damage whilst aiming. Absolutely wreaks large creatures.
---
A Vampire Explosive 50cal (really after a Bloodied but this will do for now). Great horde swatter.
---
And a ridiculous Quad capacity Explosive double barrel shotgun that's just hilarious to use 😁
---
But aside from those 3 the rest, and there were a lot, were pretty meh, some ok-ish ones that someone might buy but overall I am pretty happy, I'm a level 150 and have had pretty lousy luck finding Legendaries I want to use, mainly heavies.
---
5 stars, would shop again
---
I thought only aluminum and lead benefited from bulking and decreased weight.
---
Everything but lead and adhesive bulked doesn’t reduce weight
---
You on PC?  I've got a few of the BOS undermor plans I think.
---
I'm on xbox, have a zealots minigun, +40% bash damage and +50 dmg resist when aiming. I can also mod it with a prime barrel and you'll have yourself a nice queen slayer right there.
---
I need to know the damage, energy, and rad resistances to tell if it is sturdy or light. The numbers in the bottom left box. Or you can post a photo of the screen. Thanks.
---
Lol I kinda want to
---
All vendors share a 1400 cap pool that refreshes 20 hours from the time of your first transaction.
---
Weight doesn't affect ap cost in vats
---
I'd use the mutants explosive personally, as TSE weapons are almost useless in vats as the second shot nearly always misses.
---
Plus two shot weapons break so fast
---
I love the harpoon, especially the sound when it fires, sounds exactly like 'poon'
---
Have you updated all of your mods since the last update?
---
This is a good thought. If you drop them I could imagine that it would delete your custom name since you’re relinquishing your rights to it.
---
Woah that’s super bizarre. Honestly I’d keep that just because it shouldn’t exist lol
---
Reminds me of the off-shape weapon gems from bloodborne that dropped like 1 in a million and had no business existing
---
I added that one to the collection about a month back. Thanks though.
---
180 hours, maybe 2-3 crashes on XBO.
---
You can get the recipe go to vault Tec  university and to the left there should be a tattoo shop. Interact with the Nuka cola vending machine
---
Niceeee
---
I mean more like a 3 Star: two shot, increased damage when aiming, faster reload syringer., etc.
---
So Aten - you're saying the RNG is seeded (per server based PRNG).  If this is the case it might be better to find a better server before turning in all your scrip.
---
I'm still wondering about the other theory that it could possibly be weighted towards items you commonly use and keep in stash though.  Won't be turning in my scrip till later today when I can get online but it will probably satisfy me in some way if I see a pattern from it or not.
---
Can i interest you in a 25k piece of perfectly preserved pie?
---
Awesome tip! Thanks I did not know that.
---
And check the vendors at whitesprings and the whitesprings train station. I found some 1* I can only assume was sold by people at script cap and full stashes. Vendors sell 1* for like 50-300 caps.
---
I dont hate the game, I never said i hate the game, i never said people shouldnt like it, i have actively told people that im happy that they do enjoy it.
---
It simply ended up dissapointing me personally.
---
And from the vote amount I really dont see how you would beleive i am circlejerking.
---
I got a 3*** Vampire Explosive Faster Reload Speed DB Shotgun. That 3rd * is freaking perfect for the DB. So yes. But...I dropped 1k scrip and this is the only thing I'm keeping.
---
There is some moderately convincing evidence suggesting it's adjusted by a factor of X when you switch servers.   
---
**Example:**  
---
I would loot 35%+ Nocturnal armor on one server, then go to Weightless on another..    
---
   
---
Personally if half the hand in's result in a unfortunate pattern I'd server hop, I was really excited for the wood armor until it was discovered they reverted to 1*'s...
---
Yeah.... No
---
they could do the same for the enclave bunker
---
it basicly the same thing
---
Pick 20 flowers : 20 atoms was my fav.
---
eghh that suks
---
I got amazing armours.

Loving this new vendor
---
Haha I’m making a real life model of it, like the bottle that looks like the one in game and label is what I’m looking for.
---
Nice I'm having pretty decent Luck with her today 😁
---
My rolls seemed to be all over the place, 2* ranged weapons but managed to replace all my current guns with new ones from her with 730 scrip. Seemed pretty varried to me personally, though most were heavy guns and I pretty much exclusively use heavies.
---
good call! that is being successfully reactive to market fluctuations and supply and demand principles
---
server hopped for over 1 hour. found 5-6 dead tourists, but no camera.
---
I think they are the outliers (unusually good seeds), many who previously had "good luck", but didn't realize it, because unless your tracking every drop, it's hard to see the patterns.
---
Is that still true for the current patch? When I use it in VATS the second shot still hits, as I can hear two hits in one shot.
---
Try deleting some5hing from your C.A.M.P. its a bug. Items dont add to your workshop budget but if your workshop budget is full you cant add items. So you can remove a couple items from C.A.M.P. and readd them after you add your items to vending. Or just keep like 1% left in your workshop budget.
---
Confirmation for legendary scout?
---
Still doesnt explain why you're on this sub encouraging people to refund.
---
Dev here too, can attest. Usually an issue with a poorly configured test environment, though. Effort needs to be made to make it as close as possible to production. Unfortunately that means a tradeoff of development time, which no boss is going to allow.
---
This is the worst chat up/first date proposal I have EVER heard. I mean liver? Disgusting. If it’s not a perfectly preserved pie then it’s not worth it. If I am doing to (nearly) die, then I’ll (nearly) die for only a perfectly preserved pie! Because it’s perfect. Like me. Which you will also need to say when you offer the pie...  where is the razzle and the dazzle!?
---
no its not just you people are nuking a lot less
---
queen be a bullet sponge and her drops are less than stellar
---
white spring seems more often I also think alot of hi levels are almost full of any flux they need so yeah I am lucky to find one a night
---
The hax.
---
All right, I'll give that a try, thanks for the suggestion!
---
what's your luck stat is at? Im sure it holds no bearing but I'm still curious.
---
50 cal is good but accuracy sucks a little compared to gat and mini with tri barrel, you need to get closer to land all your shots on target,  you can almost snipe with gatling.
---
Obviously they have a valid military ID and are patient enough with lifts!
---
sorry, the ghost of wilfred brimley visted me in a  dream and told me diabeetus is like a stalking butler
---
The minimum total return in the EU is 2 years.
---
Minimum return that is assumed fault with product is 6 months.
---
After those 6 months youd have to prove a fault existed. 
---
Bethesdas own policy by EU law can only be complimentary not negating to EU law. Bethesdas own policy is you classify for a refund if you didn't download it.
---
It doesn’t affect perk cards, I checked this less than an hour ago out of curiosity
---
man i would've like just 1 good wep you got a few.
---
One of your links proves how people have gotten good rolls... explosive in 6/10? I think youre overthinking the rng possibly on the vendor
---
I’ve seen it posted many times.  I plan to test it these next few days as I have a character with only unyielding, one with only weightless, and one with only vanguard.  
---
In a true RNG world, I should get all 18? Of the armor primaries in equal numbers.  Now it takes a bigger sample size, but after say 180 drops, I should have about 10 of each.  Maybe 5 of some, 15 of others, but zero is incredibly statistically unlikely.  Like flipping a coin.  50/50 heads/tails, and each flip is 50/50, but the odds of getting 10 heads in a row?  Pretty slim.  So I’ll be posting my initial runs and subsequent runs over time.  May be awhile because if I don’t get a vendor trash 3 star it’ll be a bit before I can recycle it to stick true to form :)
---
I do feel there is credence to a server “seed”. Computer random is still an algorithm and perhaps a server seed is done to randomize it a bit more. 
---
Or to quote Captain Ed Hocken:  “Doctors say that Nordberg has a 50-50 chance of living, though there’s only a 10% chance of that.”
---
Can confirm Riomaki is very tanky
---
11 Dr,  10 Er, 10 Rr
---
Weight is 2.5
---
Not sure, I haven't used one in ages because of this. But tbh just the fact they break quicker stops me using them.
---
I also don't use explosive weapons anymore because they make silencing a weapon completely useless.
---
Someone once posted that if you give a subsequent character teh same name the one you delete both will be gone but I have not tried this myself.
---
BoS = PA piñatas
---
One nuke is enough to upgrade your PA and UA. So mostly not needed anymore.
---
Compared to the old days, these new challenges are tough.
---
 What's next? Take a picture of a High Elf wearing an Old Man Winter mask , scrapping a TSE, while in the Dev's room ?
---
This is my second item https://i.imgur.com/bd5PtVQ.png
---
Bulking is mainly for selling or easy trading, only aluminum and lead reduce weight when bulking.
---
I'm also interested to know this.  If I'm in adventure mode, lock my purifier and some one picks it, they then become wanted and my turrets attack them.  Can they then destroy my base?
---
Ah, right. My bad. I haven't played baseless since vending went live so it wasn't on my radar. As a non-survival player: do people still do vending in survival? Seems like an invitation to ambush.
---
I was thinking the stats would go something like this:
---
1. 20% More RPM's
---
2. Variable Speed
---
3. Reversible
---
4 Star variants would have either of these:
---
1. Keyless Chuck
---
2. Hammer Drill
---
But the damage boost isn't a first star perk. Is it still a stalkers but just doesn't say it?
---
Depends on what you are shooting for and your current loadout.
---
Basically: if you already have good 2\* gear you are happy with then going for 3\* hoping to get similar stuff with helpful tertiary effects makes a ton of sense.
---
But if you don't have good 2\* gear it might make sense to focus on buying 2\* gear initially.  Personally I can still use decent 2\* gear so that will be my focus with the occasional gamble on a 3\* here and there.  
---
Also one good thing about tertiary effects is that it's a short list.  So if there's a specific thing you want as that 3rd effect, you have decent chances of getting it (though the odds of it showing up on a specific item in conjunction with a specific primary and secondary effect are remote).
---
I wonder if it will still give you 2 star weapon scrip or 1 star if you try to scrap it.
---
being logical is offering nothing to you?
---
This is why slap damage needs to return.
---
I would so pay for this!
---
Interesting. I rolled for 30 1\* ranged weapon. I got [4 Two Shots, 3 Ghoul slayer's](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1qtrJVYcwz60aokD5QenY6lhMpHgiIyYQQGq_XgKtJz0/edit#gid=400683274); [4 Combat Shotguns and 3 Pipe Pistols](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1qtrJVYcwz60aokD5QenY6lhMpHgiIyYQQGq_XgKtJz0/edit#gid=590895448). I play with Handmades and I have a couple of Two shots stashed, but no TS Handmade. I've run out of my daily Scrip so can't scrap these yet. 
---
(Also in like 3000 drops, I haven't seen the Double prefix at all, but plenty of Quads.)
---
That's an atom shop outfit. Just hasn't been released yet.
---
Oh if that's the case I can finally go out and find my beloved Henry the megasloth he ran way 4 months ago.
---
Like OP those two stats are missing a main. I'm guessing it's a visual bug
---
Anti armor is way better. Two shot makes you waste you weapon durability twice as fast. You also don’t have to waste 5 points in intelligence for demolition expert with just a anti armor weapon.
---
Op could you explain more about weapons loosing stars? Ive read its happening with assaultron heads as well. Do you think this will affect any other weapons or armor?
---
I would definitely agree on an upgrade for the frogs. Maybe a small table sized container with water, a long, a blood leaf, and some dirt?
---
I saw your post 3 times? Or maybe I’m crazy!
---
I don't think so. I do a lot of pvp in survival mode at my base. I honestly was hoping people can destroy it as they please. So I can defend it and it's more realistic. I think adventure is a little to easy when it comes to that, not really realistic
---
Definitely no.
---
If you don't want to play with others, you should not play the game to begin with unless your fine with a less than ideal experience.
---
The "Seeded RNG" theory is that it's not a true random roll for everything, but a table / chart / curve table that the game looks at when handling "randomization"..  
---
Looting / getting multiples of the same limb, same Primary or Secondary legendary effect reinforce the patterns that a non-random RNG would result in.
---
If that is a threat I kindly ask you to stand down, the Brotherhood is here to help not pick fights. 🤝 (unless you wanna organize some friendly PvP 😂)
---
Yeah it happens when you log into whitespring, all the hangers will appear on the racks but you can't grab them and they disappear in front of your eyes, it's just the server lag, someone already grabbed them.
---
Why is END an afterthought? I think it's because clear-speed is everything. Whether you're grinding for XP or legendaries, faster is better. Dying just isn't much of a penalty. Add hardcore/permadeath, and END might get some love.
---
Ha sorry about that. Good luck on the model though.
---
Sad and underwhelmed has been my reaction to every content update they’ve done. I still don’t have a backpack, so boring doing the lame challenges. And I only got crap really from the vendor.
---
Encouraging people who would consider refunding but have no hope that bethesda will listen to their complaints.
---
There's no rule on the sub that you may only post things that benefit bethesdas bottomline. I did not insult anyone, my post was in no way hateful nor was i telling people they are horrible for liking the game.
---
It was simply a  factual recount of my experience with bethesda support.
---
And if you look through the comments you will even see me ask what I could have done better.
---
I understand why you'd not like me since I am speaking out against something you enjoy, but please see that i am not telling you YOU are bad for enjoying it. You are not. It's completely acceptable to have differing views on this topic.
---
And It would have been great if the mods would see this the same way instead of shutting down a post that does not break any rules.
---
shit I already have a plantation full of slave frogs, i keep them in mason jars
---
I got a mutant slayer sledge 50 % limb + 1 str 
---
2 left arm forest scout armor and a left leg urban scout , I forget the exact layout but one is vanguard another is bolstering and another is cloaking,  all have a 20 reduction in weight and like a stat I dont really use . Also got a wood armor that I was very angry with .. exterminators or something
---
True that it breaks so quickly.
---
I bet it'll be a "feature" of a future update.
---
Where is he located at the monument? I'm camped near there and would be happy to post on reddit when he's there on my server.
---
Ah, ok. Thanks. It’s light. I appreciate your time.
---
I was doing the tea time event and a random level 120-something turned up, saw I was using my 10mm pistol (about all you need for it really) and decided “nope, we’re blowing shit up”. He dropped a mutant explosive smg for me and we just over-killed everything for the hell of it xD Was pretty fun. I would have preferred a pistol for my build...but I’m not going to turn down a free weapon that explodes things
---
You have missed the whole point of the thread.
---
Good to know. The accuracy at range on gatling is great. I guess I expected that the .50 would be. Influenced by using the M2 in the Marines, I guess. Ma Deuce could reach out and touch someone from a long long ways off.
---
Anyone who wants to refund this game would not be on this sub most likely. It's been quite a while since launch, they would have left early
---
How so? I get 3.75x sneak attacks all the time.
---
Ranger dave (unless he changed his name again) final render and norespawns have creative builds!
---
Life, uh...finds a way.
---
I myself offer a free full service camp and my shower is way at the back facing a mountain no mistakes make there........... by the way if you have a shop offer water for free you fnning cheapskates ------
---
800 is more than enough personally (lvl 235) I think you need to check what's actually in your stash. A lot of ore? Too much junk? Too many super common plans? To me, it sounds like you're keeping a lot of non essential stuff in your stash if you're experiencing weight issues
---
I sell deep pocket plans all day. Easy cap, find tons of the plans from maps.
---
I can't test with armor since I have way too many prefixes in my stash boxes, but with weapons I've been slowly scripting away my non desired prefixes so I'm going to continue down this path with my testing.  My legendary weapon drops in game seem to have gotten skewed of late by this cleanup.
---
Good for you and your mules. Play with one character and tell us how great it is.
---
How about a frog in a blender?  Lots of fun... once.
---
I suspect a lot of people need to learn about foot traffic, location, traffic flow, and marketing as well. I saw a conversation between a couple people about how one was selling something for 1,000 caps often and another couldn't see the same thing for 100 caps. My camp is located within a stone's throw of about 5 other camps regularly and I have a visitor at my camp constantly. If you are up in one of the corners of the map, you're going to rarely have a customer due to fast travel costs. But when someone can walk from someone else's camp to mine and then on to another, you bet I'm going to get a lot of traffic. That's how I can sell my super common drink recipes from Biv for 200 caps and keep running out. It also depends on what time you play.
---
SBQ fight, a thousand things nearby going *doink* constantly.
---
Bad news. After the patch sloths can no longer be tamed. If I see Henry, I'll give him a scratch behind the ears and send him your love.
---
I must be one crappy employee if I've been stuck with an All Rise.  I blew the rest of my scrip on less-than-stellar armor.  Maybe one Cav piece.
---
Actually, there should be 2 options for places like this. When you click on the Whitesprings icon it should open up 2 options, inside or outside. This wouldn't apply to every fast travel point either, for example if you want to fast travel to Anchor Farms, then it will ALWAYS be outside. Additionally, for those who haven't been inside the Enclave bunker but been outside the vault doors, it should only be outside for those who haven't been INSIDE the bunker.
---
Lever action rifle is one of my favorite to use
---
Yeah it's going to be hit or miss (most likely miss) most of the time. 
---
Basically, since I'm playing a new character, if a C.A.M.P. has a bunch of plans listed I'll check it out. 
---
Most other things are far too expensive, a lot of players sell plans dirt cheap. Got the Acoustic Instruments plan for 25 caps. 
---
Basically, I go in expecting not to buy anything, but if something is priced right, pick it up.
---
I got an ultracite gatling laser, which is worthless to me. As well as a flamer and a salvaged assaultron head. Can't wait to scrip them.
---
The [label](https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/fallout/images/d/d1/FO76_Nukashine_label_readable.png/revision/latest?cb=20190315062418) from the wikia, it’s transparent so all you need to do is scale and print it on sticker paper, then cut it out. [This](https://www.thecarycompany.com/glass-jugs-30w64g?utm_source=google_shopping&amp;gclid=EAIaIQobChMIttHZwOKg4gIVg4WzCh3_IQJlEAkYESABEgJzDvD_BwE) is the best jug I could fine that wasn’t hyper expensive, all you need for it is a cork. Good luck!
---
Plot twist, they are actually the same ghouls queuing with you at the DMV to get the ID.
---
Level 200 that hunts level 30s
---
Dayum.  Hurry up and mod it.
---
User name is Darkstone, will add you tonight.
---
Modded combat shotgun - good one.  I have one myself 3 star AAE w/larger magazine and suppressor.  It’s a great weapon but it breaks down pretty quickly.  Thank God for weapon artisan 3.
---
PS4 could go over max caps. Real good chance of a 1:1 trade for about anything you want. 10k to 15k caps absolute minimum.
---
Love the far harbor weapons, but harpoon gun is top tier
---
u/valseek u/ladydevann
---
No, I fully understand. MAKE FRIENDS AND PLAY WITH THEM. Whining about social mechanics in an always online shared world is dumb.
---
I may need to redo my calculations, but I am fairly confident the combat rifle has cheaper vats costs than the assault rifle.
---
These numbers may be slightly flubbed, but I got 33 AP per shot from assault rifles and only 26 per shot from combat rifles. Apparently scopes have an effect on AP costs and I did not consider that when I did tests.
---
I'm so torn whether to go with melee or armor.  I've been fairly happy with my currently build and have no idea what to do.
---
Fallout 4 taught me that the BoS are just there to expand power armour collections and have fancy looking PA. I actually feel a little sad when I see dead BoS in 76. Not because they’re dead, but because I can’t get delicious and nutritious PA parts from their mangled remains
---
My goal is to be an eclectic vendor with stock of each item.
---
Mmhmm
---
I'd reccomend the mutant's as your primary.  I used to run with TSE CSG, but now I'm using a QE CSG instead. The difference on accuracy is major and damage difference seems very minimal
---
8, running Bloody Mess, and the 2 mutation perks
---
You have to raise your specials to meet the requirements.
---
It's like it has a hidden ability! lol
---
Yeah since im not using it straight away put to exchange
---
Hi is anyone looking into the bug where stars are dissapearing on aromor bought with scripts?
---
When I (**THE CONSUMER**) buy a **product**, I expect it to work and do what they say it will. What about that do you not understand? There have been precedents set with games like No Man's Sky that you can't pull shit like this.
---
I will not give you my perfectly preserved pie.  But thanks for the down votes!
---
So I know the FO4 Engine pretty well, but the '76 engine handles some things differently.   
---
In FO4 if you hand a "MOD" on an item (legendary effect), removed the AP it attaches to by editing the game files, checked it in game, then added back the AP, but had not modified the item in any other way, it would often retain the data.   
---
However modifying the item during that period would reset if, resulting in a "reset" of the item..  
---
So in theory, anyone who got 3* wood armor, "might" get lucky if they just stick it in their stash, if '76 saves the data the same way, however if they modify the wood armor at all, they are likely screwed.  
---
    
---
**Regarding the Assaultron Heads,**  
---
Honestly not sure there, the Weapon itself has the correct attach points, so the only thing I can think of off the top of my head is the servers are overloaded and it's not saving the data properly, not sure why it would happen specifically for the Salvaged Assaultron Head, but I'll report it.
---
Well I do disagree with that but thats not really relevant.
---
I hope you see that i have no ill intent towards you or any other players.
---
Savage 😂
---
Don't fall for the lies, good citizens of America. The true path to a brighter future of this formerly great country is within your reach, and we will guide you down it. The future will be one to look forward to, but only if we work and fight for it, fellow Americans! Join the Enclave today for a bright, pure future!
---
Keep on gambling
---
No again you have missed the point of the thread.
---
I encourage you to read what I have said and replied to others if you cant be bothered to do that then I encourage you not to respond.
---
No worries. Think its worth turning in for scrip as its the light version?
---
To be honest the weapons I had before now were pretty lame, a stock Gatling Plasma, and a 50cal that did extra damage against robots that I swear didn't actually work. At level 150 it was about time I got something decent haha
---
This needs to be a thing
---
I would honestly quit the game if I fought a three star enemy just to get that
---
Yeah, I was referring to "the other instrument" lol my bad. Wish we could have both drums in our camp
---
I did a test, 
---
with an explosive weapon enemies start moving towards you when you're sniping. And you go into caution a lot, this is especially dangerous with multiple enemies in a tight space. 
---
With a non explosive weapon you generally stay hidden and they have no idea where the shots coming from. Much more reliable stealth.
---
Might be supposed to be like a civil war cemetery
---
Gauss is a classic &amp; it fits the character I'm trying to create. Powerful as hell in its non-legendary form. Plus, it's magnetically driven slugs of metal how can one go wrong with that.
---
IKR
---
I don’t think so, In fact they they turn and shoot them pretty sure it just kills you
---
I honestly noticed that only the [Repeatable:] dailies appear in the terminal whereas the [Daily:] dailies don't. My theory is that Biv and the camp dailies are tests to see if they can get the system up and working for the new code, which will then include and update to swap all the dailies to the new code.
---
At least turning all my 1\* trash into 3\* trash saves space in my stash.
---
Didn’t downvote. Didn’t upvote either.
---
Found a level 10, got a new use for that MIRV launcher.
---
Wow man that is awesome.  I rolled the dice on a 3\* armor, 3\* melee and 3\* ranged and got shit, shit, shit.   Still enough scrip to try a couple more times later today.
---
Same.  I have one machine on each character that is nothing but items needed for badges and daily challenges at a fair price, everything from stingwing barbs and chef hats to fasnacht masks and legendary crossbows.  I call it the "Oh Sh*t!" shop.
---
Yeah I am absolutely sold on anti- armor.  An anti armor weapon stacked with stabilized (heavy weapons) or tank killer (rifles)  is a devastating.  Note: I'm mainly talking PVE here.  I don't do much PVP.
---
Thanks for being helpful instead of downvoting
---
Because this is the apocalypse b*%ch
---
Thanks for the response. My wife's luck is 12 and im at 5 so i wanna do a side by side comparison of what she gets and what i get. Obviously it's a very small test sample but I'm still curious of what the outcome will be.
---
Thanks for saving me the time of digging this up.  True random is 30 weapon types, 1/30 chance of getting each.  Any admission of adjustment means they have tweaked those probabilities.  If they have tweaked those, what else is tweaked?  Zealot has a bit more weight than vanguard?  Weightless a bit less chance than anything?  Any tweaks corrupt the randomness, and should be seen in sufficient large random sampling.
---
That is, I think everyone would agree that weapon type is skewed a bit.  However, are the prefixes skewed?  Is the second or third “star” skewed?  Will be interesting to crunch the numbers and see what they show.  Remember you can get valid statistical numbers on populations in the millions and beyond with proper sampling types in the thousands.
---
You could be one of the majority that theoretically sit in the middle of the "Seed".   
---
It's more noticeable for the players at either side of the bell curve.  
---
 **Edit:**   
---
Congrats on the upgrades!
---
What's that.... A scope effect AP usage, definitely need to look into that.
---
But what if you don't have the camera yet or someone to do these challenges with?
---
Unfortunately not :( some googling suggested they were on graham but every time I’ve seen him and checked his inventory they’re not there, they are the ones you see round the pond at riverside mansion and the curved one would look spot on round my Fasnacht  bonfire but alas they’re proving elusive
---
I use a special armour called “passive mode” and a weapon called “not causing trouble”. They’re very op.
---
Some enemy spawns are guaranteed legendary (100%) others have different chances to spawn as legendary, and those chances are map region &amp; location based, servers sometimes get a little hung up so to speak and start generating way more legendary spawns than they should, and this is always followed by the "Server being brought offline for maintenance" 20 minute warning. Every time I see that message, I drop whatever I'm doing and High tail it to WS to find more than 50% of Ghouls spawning as legendary, and often continuous re-spawns, I have gotten more than 30 in these brief windows on several occasions.
---
I believe I have seen that effect in play during some, but not all, Whitesprings runs.  It seems  to happen occasionally, like maybe one time out of 10 (anecdotal guess), that I get a run on a certain type of weapon or number of legendary drops.  It could just be pure chance but if it is not I don't see where I lose anything by adopting the tactic of relogging between buys unless I am getting a string of items I like, in which case I keep buying.  Yes it takes longer that way but it may pay off big so its worth a try for a while.
---
all of this is true!
---
I set up near whitesprings and there are always many other vendor camps around me, if i have time i like to go check them out and see if i am able to undercut them on any prices of things we both sell
---
only issue now is not being at your camp people cant inspect those 3 stars, hope that gets fixed sooner than later
---
Mutant's for me but I've had an irrational hatred for two shot weapons since FO4 so I may be biased.
---
1 star armor 15, 1 star weapon 25, 2 star armor 30, 2 star weapon 50, 3 star armor 60, 3 star weapon 100, no mystery pick option.
---
What platform are you on?
---
Wow, i am a rifle-shotgun build, i bought it 3 times and only got heavy guns
---
My only guess is this event will likely be where we get that damn stimpak diffuser from (really hoping it isn't a rare drop thing too, since I want to finish that Medic Badge).
---
Their is one with a top hat and Cane chillin in a trailer, They have us all fooled.
---
Also checkout /r/Fo76FilthyCasuals lots of good folks there that may not be here.
---
I like my silenced 10mm pistol. Not powerful, but very trusty and always has my back. On my old character it would be the lever action and handmade rifle.
---
I would love for legendary effects specifically for it, but let’s be honest lmao.... BSG is not doing that it would be Bloodied SS like everything else😂
---
I can already see the challenges :
---
  Take a picture of another player pooping in his Power Armor while drunk and naked.
---
Just run around with a tin foil hat and a tire iron.
---
You'll be fine.
---
yeah,just pve,i dont pvp that much
---
I'm not sure about this, but I feel like Mirelurks generally have a specific vulnerability to 'splody things...   
---
So I would not personally use the Mirelurk Queen as your baseline in this particular comparison. Try a nice group of high level mutants, like at WestTek or something. Switch between guns and see how long it takes to knock down a  level 68 Master or 3.   
---
I'm currently playing the "which HW to favorite" game with some Instigating v AA v. Furious minis and gatlings... (granted, it's a nice sort of problem to have).
---
I don't think solo players are "too obstinate" to cooperate with other players. It's just that not everyone's up for grouping up with people. It's a gamble meeting people in an online setting and that could make people uncomfortable. They still wanna play the game because it's fun. It's obviously designed for both group AND solo play but 80% of the time it favors the former and players who fit solely into the latter are left in the dust.
---
I understand that there will be people who can and will be able to put in alot more time then I can and pass me up as far as gear and levels go.  I'm not hating on people who have more playtime then me.  When I'm getting wrecked day one by level 100+ players makes no sense in a new mode labeled survival.  It's not survival if your build and gear are already top of the line.  I agree you cannot please everybody.  Making everybody start a new character at level one would have evened the playing field along with not allowing characters who entered adventure mode to circumvent some of the aspects of survival.
---
FYI, I received a Two Shot Salvaged Assaultron Head from the Purveyor. The game hung soon after (consuming drinks) and once I restarted it, I just have a plain Salvaged Assaultron Head. The rest of the ranged weapons did not lose stars.
---
Basically if you get wooden armor or assaultron 3*. Immediately trade it back in. They seem to be glitched and lose the 3* after leaving the screen
---
Take your pick, either a Vanguard's powered forest scout chest piece, can't remember 3rd perk or Vanguard's weapon weight reduction, +1 luck forest scout arm...
---
One good way to check if you already have the perk cards is equip and unequip the card and check the weapon stats in both states.
---
maybe if this gets repeated 60 more times on this subreddit it might change. 
---
jk bethesda doesn't listen, you know that.
---
Instigating, 10ADS, 25FRL Handmade.
---
I am VERRRRRY pleased with this gun.
---
I got my shielded BOS UA drops from the technical data quest (Forbidden Knowledge, I believe it's called) if you do it enough you'll get one.  Though like everything it's a RNG chance thing.
---
Don’t underestimate console I just saw someone selling ONE fluorescent flux in their Vending Machine for 5000 caps... ONE... I felt disrespected just looking at it in there lmao. Also I get the whole collecting thing but i just don’t feel like it’s worth that much even for collection purposes as it’s just a horrible piece compared to the best armor. But hey I ain’t buying it, everyone can do what they please!
---
Assasins sentinel and a build geared for sneak/crit seems to dominate.
---
But honestly even one chameleon piece or a bunch of stealth boys and a good crit legendary rifle you can camp somewhere and pick off unsuspecting players. Eventually someone will get wise if you aren’t good at repositioning.
---
I’ve seen people build their camps with stairs upper floors and rugs only to make an impenetrable fortress near train stations to snipe from as well. I ignore those guys.
---
But stealth/assasin/sentinel/crit build seems to be strongest against other players imho.
---
3* Bloodied gauss + Vatschitchance + crit fill
---
I've seen allot of theories and debates about this...   
---
-There is solid proof Luck effects ONLY the durability of the items you obtain, but not the "quality" of the drops.   
---
-There is compelling antidotal evidence Charisma effects the "Quality" and number of Stars on items.  
---
Higher CHA players seem to loot a higher star count when grouped then lower CHA players.  
---
-The "Seed" is account based, and adjusted somehow when you join a server..    
---
My primary account loots X Nocturnal one one server, then Y Hunters on another, both representing a % higher than normal.  
---
-Tons of theories that the equipment you have effects what you loot, but I've personally not seen enough evidence to support this. (and I quad box and often track all my drops)
---
I landed myself with 6 garbage 20+ lbs heavy weapons. I really should've seen that coming... Now to try and get rid of this stuff. Again.
---
Got a bloodied,25% fire rate,15% reload .50 cal
---
Faster reload too.....that's a NICE gun.
---
ive been eyes an AAE gatling. or a tse gatling. my gatlings good, but my buddy has an TSE and he wrecks monsters with it does more than double my dmg, we use the same heavy wep perks
---
There definitely seems to be an issue with the Assaultron head..  
---
Thanks I'll report this.
---
I wish it was more like a terrarium that would mount on the wall, bigger space and he could actually hop around maybe even have the occasional animation of him flicking his tongue at bugs.
---
This is great information, hopefully its only affecting wood armor and assaultron head. Seriously tho thanks for the in depth reply! Im sure others will benefit from reading it as well.
---
Someone’s been playing too much ShovelKnight
---
I actually don't mind running it occasionally for legendaries. Automatic Tesla Rifle clears house up until the robots for me
---
There's also references to Sunset Sarsaparilla in Nuka World as well as Deacon mentioning Robert House. Makes sense it's not crowded with references as they're opposite coasts. 
---
I don't get why people always try to insinuate that there's some type of animosity between Bethesda and Obsidian, I don't see it myself, very few game developers have worked as closely as they have.
---
10mm is a staple of the wasteland
---
Wonder if he has his mixtape up for grabs at his camp
---
So no real conclusions - but whatever works I guess if you feel something can help.  So if its seeded per account how do you change your seed?  Relog (exit client completely)?
---
On the subject has anyone else been unable to material mod one of the limbs? (Can't remember which one)
---
Doesn’t hurt to try to sell it on a Reddit trading sub or your vending machine and then you can always put it in for scrip later. These pieces are nice I just need heavy ones.
---
Syringers (and drills) are included in the legendary loot table to they can drop from legendary enemies but from what I understand they don't have legendary attach points so they can't get any effects.
---
They could do that I'm sure, but you would still have to deal with a load screen between the Lobby and the rest of the Whitesprings interior, which could be imagined as a separate map if it helps.
---
This, lol.
---
Thank you! I'll bring this up with the dev team so they can look into it.

Assassin's explosive -25% vats cost tweaked automatic combat rifle. Chameleon mutation with full weightless set.

71 damage per shot. 2,662 damage per second daytime. 3,993 damage per second night time. Only 1,065 damage per second when discovered. 114 extra damage per critical hit.

Criticals are essential for players with massive damage mitigation i.e. sentinel/assassin's.
---
It may not be meta, but it is extremely effective.

3* unyielding sentinel scout chest
---
PA and heavy weapons/melee is truly only saying high level since real endgame content quickly moved to legendary armor being more beneficial than PA for most builds (unless you are in a nuke zone).  The advertising was also likely never meant to be read into on that level (as ads generally care more about appealing to as many people possible as quickly and effectively as possible, I doubt more thought than being sure to include PA using players and looking fun/cool/etc was done).
---
The same thing happened to me after I was disconnected for the umpteenth time today. I had acquired a 3\* assaultron head from the Legendary Vendor. After the disconnect, i attempted to rejoin the server and the game then crashed. After restarting the game, I observed that the assaultron 3\* dropped to a 2\* (on a side note, all of my items had been purged from my 4 personal vendor units... resulting in my having to repost them all again... thankfully, none had disappeared).
---
TSE +1PER Lever action off my very first roll
---
Anti-Armor Gauss 250 DR while reloading + VATS critical
---
Dang, it did post 3 times. Weird. Deleted the others.
---
You mean those materials that have been totally exposed to wind, rain, and termites for 25 years without being disturbed by people doing maintenance?
---
I get it, you are a carpenter, you can take the old and make something new. But your entire life has been spent in a time when you can (and I am willing to bet do) spend quite a bit of time and money at the hardware store when executing your trade. You know as well as I do that the job gets way harder without that store.
---
Now add in trying to keep the noise down to not attract giant green dummies with machine guns and the occasional scorchbeast attack when you are trying to recover usable wood from a termite infested barn.
---
I am not convinced anyone is going to do any better than just moving into the whitesprings at this stage of the game.
---
Hell yeah! That's what I'm hoping to get! Congrats!
---
I'd scrap that as dmg modifieres are a must for first 2 perks.
---
There's been some long discussions about this exact question, but I found this post to be quite informative (that I had to bookmark it).
---
It's got some good info on other legendary effects, but one of the top comments specifically addresses your question. Hope it helps.
---
[https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/bhvz9d/guide\_indepth\_weapon\_legendary\_effect\_mechanics/](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/bhvz9d/guide_indepth_weapon_legendary_effect_mechanics/)
---
Sorry, the TSE Western was actually my 11th go at er'. Scrapped a few of the items I got, 100script for a 3* that will scrap for 40. The return rate is decent. And, with the way the rolls seem to go, you'll get about 20-25% good rolls on average, it seems. For me anyway
---
Nice! Congrats on that roll
---
You want to get into PvP cheaply?
---
Do the following:
---
S1 P15 E6 C3 I3 A14 L14
---
Max out rifleman/commando (8/9) perks, tank killer (3/3) concentrated fire (3/3) and get a level of long shot.
---
Get yourself sneak, dodgy, covert operative, action boy (3/3 all of them), escape artist, adrenaline (1).
---
Get yourself four leaf clover, starched genes, critical savvy, and some mix of class freak/better crits/grim reaper.
---
Obtain 1* bloodied rifle: lever, handmade, combat -one of these. Upgrade to bloodied vatscrit50% when you can.
---
Obtain tesla rifle. 1* quad is enough. Make it automatic.
---
Obtain following 1* armor set: chameleon, assassin, regenerating, 2x unyielding.
---
Try to get 3x ap refresh as 2* as part of upgrading.
---
Try to get 3x harder to detect while sneaking as 3*.
---
Get marsurpial, speed demon, scaly skin, adernal reaction, bird bones, eagle eyes mutations.
---
Play as bloodied sneaky sniper, always crouch. Auto rifles count for snipers here, I tried both and prefer auto and "taptaptap" shooting. Use recon scope whenever you can. Move smart, don't be seen, define moment of attack based on feedback from recon.
---
Item/build-wise, this is enough to become a killer in PvP. Play cautiously, and if you want to use vats but your opponent is sneaking, land them one shot. I get a lot of kills by hand, and supplement with vats against heavy targets. I can stand surprising amount of violence. All the things crucial for this build are in the first star, rest of them help definitely and I probably wouldn't be ever able to 1v4 win against people who knew what they were doing if it wasnt for these additional legendary bonuses, and I did that before I took this particular break, but this will work in PvP and if someone can't be a hunter with gear and build I described then even best gear ever won't make them one.
---
Happy hunting.
---
Yeah
---
I really like the SMG. Too bad it's so useless.
---
Quality shitposting. Have an upvote.
---
I PVPd with a one star 10mm for months until I got a god roll combat rifle and had to switch over.
---
I still miss the lil bugger.
---
No worries
---
[Check out this one](https://imgur.com/a/x2542mh), somehow it lost its first Star.
---
Its not legendary, but I have a shovel up for sale at my camp.  You could pretend its legendary!
---
I am a BE heavy gunner. Sneak/Crit + Headshot total multipliers do far more dmg.
---
You don’t have to level up three times , just level up once doing 3 things , like right now I did it wearing the fascnaht mask , responders gear and being higher than 76
---
If  you got any junkies or berserker heavy guns you can probably trade them away for junk 3 star melee that weighs a lot less. There are people doing junkies and berserker heavy guns builds in adventure mode.
---
AAE .45 submachine gun with +250 dmg resist while reloading.
---
I think you may have posted this on the wrong sub, since you used the market post-title naming convention
---
so many things from new vegas  would make this game more fun some form of multi player casino to wager caps , some of the weapons, the factions garb the list is endless. I loved new vegas it ran like total crap on my console but I loved that game.
---
Happy to help, allot of it is theory, until we have more of the engine decoded, but the posts today do reinforce the idea..
---
Where is the purveyor? Is there any point in going if im lvl 20? I got about 60 of whatever the currency is... But i dont want to roll somthing like a lvl 50 that i cant use.
---
Hoping to find a Quad Explosive 10mm at some point. Ideally with the 25% less vats AP cost. That would genuinely make me so happy to own. I really like the 10mm for some reason. Even when I made a rifle build character I would always carry a 10mm just in-case.
---
I gotta respect that you're straight out asking, most PVP players try offering to Trade so they can see how you are equipped before starting something.
---
The truth is that most players engaging in PVP don't want anyone to know how they are equipped, and it also changes depending on things like Team vs Solo, or Hunting vs Luring.
---
My suggestion is to equip your best DR armor and your most Damage per shot weapon and jump right into the crap, don't worry about DPS from sustained battles, as most end in less than 3 shots.
---
It came with last weeks update but it's going live today.
---
Look up “tourist locations” online and go to some places where they spawn and on their bodies you’ll find a camera that is broken, you repair the camera and then make film for it and boom you’re set
---
The same thing happened to me after I was disconnected for the umpteenth time today. I had acquired a 3\* assaultron head from the Legendary Vendor. After the disconnect, i attempted to rejoin the server and the game then crashed. After restarting the game, I observed that the assaultron 3\* dropped to a 2\*.
---
This great nation *will* rise again.
---
In what regards? Burst? Of course.  Sustained damage? No, you will lose you ability to chain sneak reliably during boss battles then you will be out classed by a BE Heavy.  I too have crit sneak builds.
---
Only one was a mule, and that toon (level 91) became one out of necessity/trader toon, the rest are played characters. As of today the trader can finally fast travel again.
---
You mean in general or specific weapons? I've noticed there are outlier likes gamma gun seems to have a lot of things it cannot role. Launchers and crossbows cant be explosive, etc. Or do you mean rolling bloodied vs zealot has different odds? If so, can I see the source?
---

---
Vanguard 1 agility breathe underwater forest scout chest on my first roll.  New armor at least.
---
Yeah, I think there’s a fair point that the focus way too much on their latest “thing” with the daily/weekly challenges. Like one, maybe occasionally two a day would be cool, but 3 out of 5 every day focused on the new feature seems excessive. It was the same way when player brewing was the new thing, we got 2-3 daily challenges involving alcohol. They just need more variation. Like throw back in some of those alcohol challenges, and some of the pre-wild appalachia dailies too. People won’t get burnt out so fast on stuff if they have more variety, which ironic that as Bethesda adds more and more content, variety of challenges shouldn’t be a problem. I’d love to log in one day and see a fun odd ball challenge I’ve either never seen before, or haven’t seen in a while.
---
In regards to the daily level up challenge, as vet players, it’s easier for us to check off 3 level up challenges at once, because we always get the first one, and we have all the costumes and weapons and can easily just do whatever else when we get close to a level up, but I can see how newer players might struggle with doing 3 of them all at the same time. Plus, I think as vets, we have a regular rhythm to what we do, know where to, and how to farm xp, and are generally aware of how full our xp bar is.
---
New players I think are more just trying to survive and get a handle on things, and aren’t like, oh, I’m close to leveling up, let me throw on the clown costume i pulled from my stash after i logged in and saw it was that set of level up challenges, head over to wendigo cave so I can knock out both the daily challenge and the daily side mission in like 5 mins, and then get back to other stuff.
---
The only thing I can think of maybe improving it for newer players is changing “level up while lvl 76 or higher”, and replacing it with just “level up.”
---
It wouldn’t effect vets because we’d still check it off either way, and could let new players double up with a “level up at Morgantown airport while under level 20”, so then they could just focus on getting a third item in the list and it’d be all good.
---
I have 3 of the models in my stash too. I had four but accidentally scrapped it.  I have had to pass on so much cool stuff because of the stash weight limits, but that's one of the differences between this game and all the others.
---
I enjoy Fallout76 because for once I don't have to see a bunch of structures every corner ( I live in Los Angeles). To get to hear nature, see woodlands, rivers, and small towns is amazing. Fallout76 isn't just a game, its an escape to a fun experience.
---
Yeah this is happening with wood armor. Best thing to do right now if you get wood armor is trade it for scrip immediately and hope they patch the bug next week and try again if you were actually after wood.
---
Thx man!
---
My first 3 star was a 44 revolver.  My second was the 10millimeter sub machine gun hahaha

With every new update the servers get stressed because of all the players rolling in to check out the new shit going on.

Switching server seems to "Adjust" the seed, again theoretical and hard to isolate, but today's posts are reinforcing the idea.

Hand made the most efficient. I got to say the gatling is one of my go to for big beasties.

Gauss is the coolest. I also like the 50 cal machine gun but it goes through ammo fast. 
---
Tesla has got to be the most fun for me but mainly when I'm in the forest. Sucks that straight forward aiming is hit or miss but bouncing shots off the ground or walls, around obstacles and chaining arcs through multiple targets is a blast. Definitely in the last wave of Fasnacht.

That’s the fallout 4 chapter which is very far in the future, that maxon was corrupt and blinded by technology. The Fo76 brotherhood only wished to rid Appalachia of the scorched plague and even aided the responders. Our chapter is more like fallout 3 elder Lyons chapter we seek to help the people regain their footing as well as protecting them and technology from the evils of the wastes
---
WhiteSprings is the best (especially pre-Nerf) place to test the idea, high number of legendary drops in a short period of time,  it's great when you lock into a pattern of Bloodied, but terrible when it's nocturnal!
---
I just wish I could have a holster for it and actually have it on my person, and draw it when I pull out my 10mm. They’ve always been my go-to weapon for some reliability in an emergency. I never feel sad when scrapping weapons/armour, but when it comes to a 10mm I’ve made and used for 10 levels...I always get sad when I have to upgrade. But I tell myself that I am scrapping the 10mm and using its parts to build the higher level version, so it lives on.
---

Please don't make it bigger, or else the jar won't fit in my punchbowl anymore.

Oh well anti- armor even without legendary effects shreds everything in PVE when combined with the right perks IMO. I have a heavy weapons power armor build. I stack my anti- armor Gatling gun with heavy gunner and stabilized perks and it works great.  I'm  sure it would be the same with an anti-armor rifle with tank killer.  And like a previous poster said, two shot and explosive effect  makes weapon break way faster.
---
Don't see why you are so aggressive about me misremembering the name of their deluxe edition.

I really don't care what they want to call it.

It's bugged, you have to try another one. I did the one where you need to take pictures of animals and milk Brahmin. A lot spawn in Flatwoods, and most camps have one you can milk.
---
Still laughing😂, I’m guessing that means probably not.
---
Patience I guess. I've come across it before at vendor bots too but that's probably not a good place to start. I got it from the water park parking lot, took me about 4 server hops. Also, it seems that random spawns load in last, so maybe just run around in the spawn area for a bit before server hopping.
---
Yes I love it but it's so underwhelming even with all of the press for it
---
Not in the game yet, it’s bugged I believe so it doesn’t spawn.

Weirdly enough, I just picked up a broken camera twice (on my char and my wife's char) from containers in the Pumpkin House. Not a guarantee, but might be worth checking?
---
Sadly, the spare I got can't be dropped or traded, otherwise I would've been happy to pass it on.
---
If you do find one from a container tho, you might still need to be on the lookout for the Photographer to get the "Bucket List" as it initiates the quest line to get a lens mod for the camera.

I dont doubt it. I just hope we dont have to wait another year for them. Told myself when they come back out I'm buying the whole set
---
That is cool, but how many rolls were actually wasted?... I used all my 600+ scrips and got nothing. Not a single armor piece that would overweight my 1 star assassin piece or Bolstering piece. And I already knew this is going to happen, because you see, this purveyor was just a loto. Sure few will win, but most will lose and that is why this is not something that game needs. What game need is actual content that rewards for having a skill and team working well together instead of being braindead, doing nothing and then getting well rewarded just because of RnG. I am just saying- people who work 8 hour should get paid for 8 hours and people who work 4 hours should get paid for 4 hours and not be vica vera, just because there is RnG involved.

You only get to pick one card per level up, the card packs just give you more cards to choose from.

Don’t do the medic one yet.. diffuser is glitched there too
---
Um.... sorry to be a downer but I remember having Megasloth Tenderloin for dinner almost 4 months ago...
---
maybe before handing in scrips then try farming normal places like the burrows or whitesprings to see what your server "seed" is-
---
that way you might not have to waste as many scrips
---
Especially considering that half the time it's bugged, yeah, it needs better rewards.

We are just the Brotherhood of Steel, picking up and rising from the ashes of our fellow brothers and sisters before us. Providing aid and protection to the people in the place of the fallen.
---
Memory is hazy but I believe he's on the steps leading up to the actual monument.
---
No.
---
Add me, I’m JAY8733.  I have some stuff I could trade I think, or just caps.. I loooove the double barrel for some reason, it’s just fun to use for me.
---
Works at the Whitespring hotel entrance as well, on the hood of the red car just in front.
---
My experience has differed. You can still sneak attack in caution. Perhaps the lighting effects can make you become detected if you have subpar stealth. I use weightless gear, chameleon, and three ranks of stealth perk and rarely get detected. I can't recall how enemies moved while searching though.
---
Hey be happy, it was worst before I have like 7 explosive vent ultracite plans because it used to only give that thing.
---
Ugh... I'm really sick of waiting for legendary power armor!!!
---
I got a 3* Board and a 3* assaultron head and both bad. And about 4 3* bolstering arms and a unyielding leg . Most were alright but not the best.
---
I went for Archer, Athletics and Mamolagist. They were the easier non-bugged ones. Everything else seemed to be bugged or near impossible for a solo player.
---
Yeah I did the animals and athletic ones. I was hoping to take the easy way out with Entomologist or Herpetologist, but alas...
---
Guess I'll have to try another. Anything but simmer or medic LOL
---
Black powder pistol followed by an AA Handmade
---
Not even close. I've never seen a camp anything like mine and its pathetic that you felt the need to reply with this dumb BS rather than just keep scrolling.
---
If you poke me I will carry you to justice, you will be given free aid, water and food a place to sleep and the option to join. If you decline we only wish that you stay safe out there
---
Burnt comics/magazines are the best easy caps. They weigh almost nothing and are 1c each.
---
Maybe you already picked one up before. If so, you can find a new camera in random storage boxes and scorchbeast guano piles. There's a couple piles around fissure site prime :) make sure not to loot anything from them unless it's the camera, or else they'll be empty for 24hrs
---
I don't know how it happens for me, they didn't break just cleared out back into my stash. I assume you repair them same as any workshop item
---
Well crappy 😢
---
so youre saying its finally ok to be a bell-end?
---
going through film like a minigun, man!
---
Thanks for letting me know. Man so many bugs
---
Cool shit
---
Genius.
---
I honestly don’t know and hope I will never have to
---
but I love getting my 1 ⭐ legendaries from the level 95 end game boss that are usually useless!! :(
---
I'd say it's accurate enough, the way we are swinging that bitch around like Arnold. Still has some of the gun cradle on there too so it's even heavier.
---
You do. There are a few which are bugged. The frog one is hit and miss, I think the moth man wing one is glitched too. Personally I did Archer, Athletics and the Mamologist ones. They were the easiest and quickest for me.
---
Head slot is cosmetics only
---
Probably some law against it. Typical government move. Gum up the works with red tape and bureaucracy, take every hard earned  cent and use it to fund their Illuminati free mason sex parties.
---
Yeah I was surprised when I shot all three side by side, then I realized how large the 50 cal is. You'll need a third arm to operate it lol, maybe that's why they made it kick harder than the other two. In reality it's always mounted right?
---
Not a terrible idea...   
---
I mean most of us are going to play for an hour or more anyway, kill some Legendaries, check for a pattern and hop if it's looking "Nocturnal" like ;)
---
Afraid so, I would imagine the various bugged badges will be fixed next week, inside the vault said we were getting bug fixes as well as project paradise. The frog habitat won’t complete on the tadpole one that asks for it and the possom music one isn’t registering most of the instruments and locations but fingers crossed it will all be sorted next week
---
Absolutely you can yes, stealth still works. But 100% using explosive weapons makes you much easier to find for enemies.
---
I can only suggest you try it.
---
I don't know why people thought it would be much less rng than normal drops. Keep in mind that even if your unlucky, other players will not. Check their stores and trade. There should be some influx of legendaries.
---
Yeah eventually a guy showed up and was poppin people with his TSE but we just ignored him and held queue. Lol
---
The Power Fister is still the highest damage and one of the lowest weight melee weapons I've found. I've also been enjoying The Dragon way more than I thought I would. Reload takes forever but it's so nice being able to just one shot most enemies with it. I've had a lot fun with waiting until a Yao Gaui is running straight at me and just blasting it's head off at the last second lol.
---
How about we start with just making it complete the objective.
---
I liked my deathclaw “friend”
---
Running 1 3 star card if commando work a full auto quad explosive railway. Armor is marine sent assassin. The railway is amazing.
---
Yea the level up while below or above is pretty crap I do think they should be replaced by level up.  I do think that it is weird but honestly half the time I don’t even try to get it: level up in power armor level up while drunk and level up in whitesprings are pretty easily
---
I agree! I keep hesitating to even build one because it feels so inhumane! Give the poor thing a terrarium :(
---
Hur hur 😁
---
Loot: The legendary drop rates for the Gatling Gun and Cryolater have been adjusted to better match all other weapons.  
---
From:
---
https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/article/1GzFRJ3M5wmdnunkTDcbHZ/fallout-76-wild-appalachia-patch-9-notes-may-7-2019
---
The prefix drop rate is conjecture but as mentioned, since the guns aren't just random chance it's likely prefixes in general aren't as well.  And I mean that I think bloodied vs zealot has different odds.
---
I’ve bought bulk screws. They’re in there.
---
Damn fine idea.
---
And it should drop stuff for lower levels that do any damage. The lower levels van at least trade the higher level weapons/armor for stuff they need. It's unfair for a lvl 5-10 to help kill a lvl 50+ creature and get nothing from it. Give them a chance to survive
---
Dropped bags are a different story. I pick them up all the time too lol
---
I think everything has 1 damage resist now? But that cannot be increased. I’m also a bit sad that my Assaultron helmet is only 1 damage resist when it covers 3 slots. When I could get 3 damage resist for a hat, glasses and bandana.
---
I just do uranium fever for my 3* legendaries. SBQ has never been worth it to me, especially since I either run energy weapons or melee nowadays. One has ammo that's a pain in the ass to stock up on or I cant help with queen 50% of the time at the very least unless it glitches. Uranium fever has 3 legendary enemies and one of them is almost guaranteed 3*. At this point I think we need other 3* world bosses.
---
thats exactly what it does, tested it before.
---
Consider it done! 💃🏼🍭
---
Ah, makes sense!
---
3* troubleshooters Tesla with extra limb damage. Useful for clearing silos I guess. The rest of the stuff I got was scrapped back for scrip.
---
Aka "we don't have any more content planned for quite a while after this so please tell us what the hell we should do with Inside the Vault now" 
---
Not disparaging them for this at all, they've released plenty of new content over the past couple months and I don't expect new DLC stuff every week, but thats exactly what it means.
---
I do, trying to log on in the next few hours if I can. I'll pass along some super stims if you want? My character doesn't have much going for him but is  building toward an ammo smithing vendor
---
Holy Jesus dude
---
Not very lore friendly BoS...
---
You could get lucky like me and spend 100 on a railway rifle and scrap it for 40 just to turn around and get another fuckin railway rifle -_-
---
Yes, someone informed me they did. I checked one of the wikis that datamines their effects. It lists scopes as around +30% AP cost while something like a red dot sight is -15% AP cost. It also says some magazines can increase costs as well. I did my testing without regard to attachments other than semi auto or fully auto. Results were likely skewed. Glad I found this out before formally posting my analysis.
---
Likely
---
Yeah but why? In Fallout 4 you could wear normal head gear without armor value or helmets, I wonder does Bethesda has ANY (good or lame) reason for that other than "It just is" or "we saw that it's better that way"
---
It would bother me if Bethesda hadn’t *finally* released a decent mohawk. Never wearing a hat again.
---
Chase a bounty when you see one. That’s how I did it. Shot someone to their knees, stimpacked them for the quest, then killed them after. The final killing is optional. But the bounty paid for the stimpack I used :p
---
Please
---
I think you may be getting lost somewhere along the way. Whether you go straight ahead into the main entrance or walk down the stairs into the service entrance you don't go past any enemies and with the short cut it puts you into the shops adjacent to the cooking supply shop, so you have a 50ft walk inside to get to artisans corner instead of a 500ft walk from upstairs.
---
Just log off and log back in
---
Are you daft? I never once stated that they didn't release the info, what we are arguing about the numbers. End of conversation is right. You are the most ignorant, indignant, stubborn and disingenuous individuals out there. You can't admit you're wrong, you can't admit you're INITIAL sources were wrong (good to know you can use Google and not just looked through your "recommendations") about the numbers and you keep parsing and doubling down on your regurgitated garbage. Now convert lumens to psi. (Since you never did your initial conversion)
---
I will have to pay closer attention to behavior next time I play.
---
There are several "Just brotherhoods" and many named chapters running about. How do you guys  differentiate from the others?
---
Not a jab, honest question. Anyone who loves the BoS is good in my book. I am just curious if you folks have run into this issue.
---
I don’t think she’s talking about your carry weight. Cut down on the fancy lads snack cakes tubby!
---
These are the only perks I care about in general.  
---
###Weapons  
---
★**Anti-Armor**	Ignores 50% of your target's armor.  
---
**Furious**	Damage increased after each consecutive hit on the same target. 
---
**Quad**	Quadruple ammo capacity  
---
**Two Shot**	Shoots an additional projectile at 25% base effect.  
---
★★40% increased swing speed  
---
25% increased fire rate  
---
Bullets explode for area damage at 20% base effect  
---
★★★15% faster reload  
---
250 damage resistance while reloading  
---
90% reduced weight  
---
###Armor  
---
★ **Vanguard's**	Grants up to 35 Damage and Energy Resistance, the higher your health  
---
★★ Increases action point refresh speed  
---
25 Radiation Resistance  
---
★★★ Ammo weight reduced by 20%  
---
Weapon weights reduced by 20%  
---
Food, drink, and chem weights reduced by 20%  
---
Junk weight reduced by 20%
---
I wouldn't say it was the best drop but it suited the weapon well in my opinion. A quad Crossbow with improved vats accuracy and 250 damage resistance while reloading.
---
Because radiation. 😂
---
in for details.
---
I made more room in my stash and it worked. A few lbs may not cut it. Remember that your perks don’t apply to stash weight.
---
:(
---
Yeah, I was excited when I started seeing them.  I would grab them in case I came across anyone that needed one, then found out that you can't.  I do keep one on me though because mine disappeared...no clue what happened to it.
---
🤯
---
I accidentally stole someone else's loot during my first Encryptid event. Everything was chaos and I just didn't want to lose my stuff and grabbed the first bag I found. :(
---
Maybe, one day
---
I saw a plant with violet flowers today beneath a tree and almost got out of my truck to pick them lol (violet flux) have issues lol..
---
&gt;without having to spend dozens if hours grinding.
---
Amateur :P
---
Seriously though, I agree with you 100%.  As much as I'd like there to be elite raids with minimum gear scores and atunement requirements and 25 people groups...wait, no I don't want any of that!  This is a pretty casual game, that you can taker very seriously if you want to, but that everyone should be able to enjoy without some exclusive content that only a small percentage of the players are 'big enough' to enjoy.
---
Events are perfect for that, scale them so that a few people can succeed (or just scale it to the number of participants), and throw in a few things that you can strive towards, but aren't providing exclusives to just the few.  IMO that's a perfect excuse for making *at least* SBQ always drop 3-star items.  Nothing you can't get elsewhere, but easier to get if you can take her down.
---
If I want to grind hundreds of hours just o get enough gear to beat my head against a practically impossible raid boss, I'll go back to playing WoW :P
---
Very nice!  Since I'm a melee character, that'd be a keeper for me!
---
Beat test is whitesprings, if you use an explosive hunting rifle..... All the ghouls will come for you.
---
Use a non explosive and you can clear the entire place out without ever being seen sometimes.
---
LOL, people would pay/trade for one of those at least.
---
It is welllllll after release. If they bring new content like this to the game 7 months after release it should 100% be end-game material. I don't blame the people at all that expect this to be more difficult, and more rewarding end-game content. I understand there's new players and shit but new players still have the whole game to explore and plenty of content in front of them. End-game players are the focus for new content in every online game for a reason and it's not crazy to think this should be the same.
---
I got a Scout Armor Right Arm Sentinel piece. RNGesus Christ be praised!
---
I have a Zealots prime gatling gun. Chews the crap out of scorched and makes a dent in the queen. Violet flux is easy and cheap as long as you don't run out of fluid.
---
it's 60 scrip for 3 star armor
---
Might be sticking iron sights on my hunting rifle then lol as I'm heavy vats anyway. Will test this out tonight, thank you 👍
---
But the mini games are out in the wasteland to find. They’d be pretty redundant if it was loading screens. Plus, trying to play Ruby Ruins in that short amount of time? Good luck xD
---
Gonna try that.
---
Gonna try that too.
---
Bloodied is a lot better than tse your dmg is probably bugged fully heal then become irradiated again mine do that sometimes
---
I'd be pleased with that golf club, and I'm glad Enclave Armour is in the legendary list now
---
Got the same Golf Club, but 40% power attack.
---
I'm unsure about AAE as I think the AA part doesn't work correctly with the explosive mod, could be wrong but I had an AAE combat shotgun and it was pretty lame but the Quad Explosive double barrel shotgun I got wreaks face.
---
2 Shot is ok but there are other very good options alongside explosive tgatvaee beastly.
---
Okay will try that
---
Yes. either tripod or vehicle mount. It is broken down to three parts for human-carry. Barrel, reciever assembly, tripod assembly. You would have to be a The Mountain sized monster to carry that beast intact, much less try to fire it.
---
I posted this the other day... why can't Thag the Destroyer rock pigtails if he wants? It's a post-apoc world for cryin' out loud!
---
Tse shoudnt even be close to bloodied though
---
If you are out of ap and have marsupial then your jump is reduced to normal.
---
Pro tip right there.
---
Savage.
---
It does this to me occasionally, but I just back out of the vendor and go back in, and it always works itself out
---
Get below 20% health to take advantage of the bloodied build.  50% won't give a lot of benefit.
---
This at least makes more sense to me then the other person who is saying it takes your items in your inventory in stash in account. I get certain items in game are generally more rare, maybe it's tiered? Things like a cryo, gauss and tesla are in the rare category, vs. a shotgun and revolver are common.
---
Good bot
---
No matter if it’s just simply “level up” or the current “level up while...”,  still both better than “level up 3 times.”
---
Though I do miss my low level alt that I created to unlock achievements that were bugged because I completed them during BETA with my main, and then kept around just for that pain in the ass challenge. Maybe some day they’ll finally fix the discovery challenges that are still glitched and I’ll hop back on her again. Some day...
---
They just put all the caps in one place so you don't have to run around for them. Saves fast travel costs.
---
“Short amount of time”
---
Telekinetic powers
---
This epitomizes Bethesda and Fallout mind frame of their digital society. Hilarious
---
I don't think they spawn in containers until you get the quest.
---
That sounds perfectly balanced.
---
I think everyone already has Marsupial. Plus there's no downside to chameleon so it's worth just having. Or maybe Berserker builds are the next big thing.
---
This just happened to me! I thought I was crazy.
---
Month or so ago, someone brought to my attention a similar theory about legendary effects being weighted towards the effects you have on you/in your stash.  I thought it was a bit far fetched but if your onto something here I guess anything is possible, including that.
---
Yeah, sucks. And we know there's no possible way it'll be reverted back to 3* lol.
---
Sometimes checkpoints don’t work if there are server issues at the time. It remembers it for the session but if you log out then it can forget where you’d gotten to. I had to re-do the rose’s syringer Yao Guai part because I’d lost connection to the sever briefly during it.
---
I want salt &amp; pepper hair colour, FFS. 
---
"You may have black, faded black, washed out black, sunfaded black, grey, silver or white."
---
Bloodied will only really shine at below 30% health.
---
Most builds that use bloodied (like mine) will also see other synergies such as Adrenal, Nerd Rage, Radicool etc. Not to mention armor or PA perks such as Unyielding or Emergency Protocols.
---
If you want to play high health play TSE or AAE. If you want to play low health play Bloodied (with or without explosive). Bloodied allows more synergy, but you're playing at low health.
---
Whatever floats your boat tbh. TSE is popular for a reason :)
---
Yes, non-wood ones are fine. I got two-non wood and they're ok, the two wood went down to 1-star
---
Armor is not damaged in your inventory.
---
I was following a much higher level around a nuked Whitespring. I was helping as much as a could, but definitely not able to kill much of anything, so I was basically just riding their coattails trying to get hits in as much as possible.
---
They eventually just invited me to a team to make it easier. After he was done farming, though, he went to my camp.
---
My budget is maxed but I still panicked over what he was doing there/why he was there, so I dropped team, lol.
---
It’s not that long. And ruby ruins is a pretty long/extensive game.
---
Ash... Heap? What is this ash heap you speak of? You mean that grey corner of the map no one ever enters?
---
For the "revive a friend" quests I took off all my armor so it wouldn't be damaged.  Probably didn't help by heaps and bounds, but I felt better.
---
Yeah you can take off your armor and in your inventory it wouldn't take damage
---
That's my issue.....we don't know any of the numbers and I would like to.
---
I was thinking earlier it would be great if the community contributed data on what they get from the Purveyor....but I don't want to do it.... LOL
---
This fast travel and loading screens are too much of a meme to change now lol
---
Yeah, had the same, one reasonable weapon I might use. Does Luck affect RNG?
---
AAE combat shotgun
---
Vampires Explosive revolver ( which I'll probably never use )
---
TSE submachine gun
---
Bloodied ultracite gattling laser
---
Got awesome drops on my main, very pleased, gonna buy a scratch card later.
---
That would increase load times lol.
---
Oh man that's a shame, I love me some wood armour. I've got a full set of shrouded Unyielding. Of all the other shit-tier stuff that still gets to have 3 ledge slots (rolling pins, pool cues, grognaks axe) wood armour really should have 3
---
As far as I've seen it's only an issue with wood armor. Just don't buy armor until it's fixed. Weapons seem to be functioning just fine.
---
With Patch 9 there was a TSE stealth buff, my rifle went from 245 to 286 damage, other people reported  similar increase
---
Really want to get an Instigating fast swing speed  strength +1 Grognaks axe or super sledge for my melee character. With my sniper I would like an Anti Armor +33% vats hit, -25% vats cost Handmade or Plasma. 
---
I have an AAE Handmade but think I might want to try putting the 5 demo expert perk points into something else. Not sure if the damage is good enough anymore.
---
I think others have done similar tests but it's inconclusive, some say luck does have an effect others say it doesn't. The mod selection for Legendaries I think all have an equal chance of being applied but it's the combination of those mods that's key.
---
Others suggest Luck gives you a better chance of receiving a legendary that's equal to the creatures star level but I'm on 8 Luck and about 80% of the time I get 1* stuff from 3* enemies and 15% are 2*
---
If they do introduce it, it will be laughable effects.  Weightless or higher durability.  PA is already OP for heavy gunners and was OP for Patch 8 shotgunners (only talking pve)
---
Still bloodied should beat that out if your bloodied enough, that’s the whole point your sacrificing hp for dmg
---
Two shots are so disappointing thought...
---
Aw man that stinks. Thanks!
---
Still better than nocturnal’s
---
Polarbear Igloo has a number of theories on this, but tbh they're a bit skewed. Check him out on YouTube and make of it what you will.
---
Has your weightless wood armor turned into a 1 star?
---
I used close to 700 scrip and yielded no weapons and 2 useable armor pieces.
---
I don't believe you
---
I said it before, and I will say it again....
---
....Unyielding X-01.
---
Where does the broken stop?
---
This is true...
---
I got a instigating shovel 3star :D
---
That would be so awesome
---
I’m in BobbaFett101510 
---
I don’t have a 100 caps to spare But I can give fussion cores or any other tradeables
---
They've nerfed bloodied then because at half health my bloodied guns used to do more damage than my equivalent tse but now the tse's do more even at half health.. you have to take your health down to nothing to get them to even match some of the tses now :/
---
not sure, i've got 8 luck myself
---
Probably to give players some style options. Otherwise everyone would be wearing the helmet with the highest DR, like the Combat Helmet or whichever. Itd look shit. I like it how it is now
---
It used too
---
Actually at night they’re probably better😂
---
Will do, cheers for the heads up.
---
Never had explosive weapons but now o have 2 from this vendor a shot gun and a hunting rifle
---
You can get all the level up challenges done with 1 level up
---
i guess the reason is because they wanted to give people the change to have a lot of design choice for their characters thats why the helmets dont have armor rating so people wouldnt feel the need to combine their red dress with a combat helmet (now its one so you could get a benefit of 2 DR by wearing glasses/bandana but thats such minor i mean common 2 dr)
---
Maybe we're just not skilled enough to properly skin a deathclaw on our own. But whoever put them in those containers was skilled enough.
---
And Scorchbeasts can't digest the hide for whatever reason and poop it out.
---
You use them to build Sheepsquatch themed melee weapons, the plans for which drop from Free Range events.
---
Ended up with a ghoul slayer exploding assault rifle.   Cant remember the other perk.    
---
And a two shot rail rifle.   That sold fairly quick on my vendor.
---
I’ve got about 6 I think. Oh well. Gonna go throw another 400 scrip at her and she what she gives me
---
It's not that, if I'm at half health and my guns do less than a tse which works at full health then bloodied would now only be viable as a melee build
---
Maybe for headshots for pvp?
---
Do you have multiple machines? Are you sure the items aren't in an other machine? It seems that when you have multiple machines, they don't share inventory with each other.
---
What’s the second star on the bloody Gatling Laser?
---
I’ll check in min when I get on maybe the dmg is just bugged I’m pretty sure they didn’t stealth nerf bloodied
---
First roll was Furious SS Str Grognak’s. It went downhill from there.
---
Thanks man.. having a heart attack over here lol
---
This is a video game, not a job.  You shouldn't expect to be "paid" for ~~working~~ playing for 8 hours a day.
---
According to data mines... it's already in the works and in my opinion, Yes. If we are going to have OP bullshit guns then we need something to counter that.
---
I cant find it mind copying it?
---
Was doing encrypted event when someone launched a nuke so I stripped off, accepted my fate and my armour was untouched by damage (stayed to get the ground zero achievement)
---
Whaat can you use the tokens for?
---
Excuse me, are you speaking I'll of my choo choo pew pew?
---
Does the random legendary weapon that you receive from the vendor comparable to your current level?
---
Because it would force you to wear a helm for max stats. They want you to be able to look however you want without having to worry about whether or not it's a "Viable" choice
---
RN Jesus will bless u eventually..I promise
---
I don't buy the "what's in your inventory/Stash" theory, mainly because I'll see the pattern stuck on X while on server Y, but you never know..
---
If you go via the service entrance direction (East) you will have to lap 75% of the entire building.
---
(Also you will also pass mole rats, which are an enemy).
---
If you approach the west direction which will take you there much quicker than the above, you will pass a car park full of ghouls.
---
With either of these, obstacles are present and compared to walking down some stairs...
---
You gotta be kidding me.
---
Yeah fr I’m a bloodied build😅
---
Could just be the damages not displaying correctly?
---
It's multiplicative and your next AP effect applies to what Armor remains. 
---
&gt;damage reduction cannot be reduced below 99%
---
You'll have to find the formula/play the game to see if you reach a point where you do more damage without a pure AP mag
---
I put 20 throwing knives and 10 leather arms in a vendor, just for shits and giggles.
---
whoa guy, those are sought after so dont scrip it before shopping it around.
---
Well I have no way of proving it so believe it or not.
---
I got a 3☆ wood leg. 
---
I wish I was joking.
---
Possibly I’ll check actual dmg too
---
Love me some dirty pillows.
---
Though I was amused at someone's camp.  They took the time to write in small letters on a vending machine something along the lines of "The Gnome is Magic" and had a garden gnome for sale for 5000 caps in their shop.
---
Or for junk.. bone, cloth, ballistic fiber
---
I have the same issue
---
Of the 15 or so items I got only 1 was really usable, but I don't mind it. I don't expect every drop to be amazing day one.
---
You mean they scripped the idea!
---
IE black powder rifle
---
Do it
---
I’ve yet to get plans for these weapons but always wondered if they were really worth trying hard for. Are these weapons any good?
---
Why do the lights take up so much budget :(
---
I was at the Morgan town airport last night and was playing the hand drum, super kool! I would love a plan for this if anyone knows how to get one.
---
What silo, Ill grab B and we can double shot it XD
---
Vampire Explosive Faster Reload DB Shotgun.
---
I'm not all for that but I would like to pick the class of weapon. Like heavy, rifle, pistol.
---
Yes I've got three characters at the moment otherwise you'll have problems with specials
---
Did you buy 2 or 3 star to get those?
---
Way better than I did.    Best thing that dropped for me was a furious .50 cal with vats hit chance and reduced vats cost.
---
I got a legendary 3* troubleshooters, bash damage +1 perception pipe revolver, and the exact same effects on a combat shotgun lol.
---
Yes unfortunatly. My game crashed and when i logged back in, it had all changed to 1*
---
Only the wood armour changed which is really weird
---
More murder is more better
---
Also could be adrenal reaction related again.. before I used to have to cure my mutation and reapply it
---
Lol. Or get one more and triple shot it. Just crash the whole server.
---
Alright thank you!
---
I didn’t either when it was brought to my attention.  Month or so ago.  Prior to patch 9 I played a PA Explosive shotgunner.  I used IE, AAE, TSE and BE Shotguns.  Patch 9 gutted shotguns so I switched to Heavy Guns traded off my shotguns for BE Heavy Guns... low and behold, I’ve gotten more bloody weapons since patch 9 than I have gotten in 500 hours of game play... I get it, no math, no science and just my words, but sometimes it makes you wonder right?  I only have bloodys on me and my stash now.
---
Handmade is 3 star, assault rifle is 2 star, and mini gun is 2 star
---
It was a joke lol. All i use is PA
---
That's what I have been hearing, has me really worried about turning in scrip.
---
I had this same thought. Very ready
---
Sandwich board when?
---
i didnt feel that the weapontype was repetetive but i had almost the same legendary effects on the first 5 (of 8 in total) the first five weapons had junkies effect and increased bash damage
---
the third effect on non of these was good enough to make the weapon considerable
---
the single only "good" weapon i got was a bloodied blackpowder rifle with increased bash damage and 15% faster reloadspeed
---
so i was pretty dissapointed tbh
---
already several survers where it is sitting in a nuke zone. Go ahead, its good flux farming.
---
Well you don’t need to level up 3 times and yea the challenges are kinda annoying because I have about 5 of them (all offering 80 atoms) that won’t complete even though i have done it. I do think that since most people do just level up 3 times to do the challenge it should give more atoms
---
Yeah on Xbox I got this: 
---
Quad Railway Rifle with Faster Fire Rate and 50 DR while aiming
---
TSE Railway Rifle with 15% Faster Reload
---
Instigating Gatling Plasma with Faster Fire Rate
---
Berserker’s Explosive Black Powder Rifle
---
Bloodied Minigun with Reduced Weight and VATS Crits do 50% more damage
---
I never use PA because it cant stand up to top tier Marine or Combat legendary armor. This is why I agree with legendary PA.
---
The power your health, the more damage.  I think below 20% it caps out though, so you don't need to get to 1 health to get the most out of it.  Also Nerd Rage (if you have that perk) kicks in at 20% for extra damage and other things.
---
I agree, it would be nice to pick the class of weapon.  Pistol, Rifle, Shotgun, Heavy.  But picking an effect is too powerful.
---
My melee main got: 3 Star Boxing glove, 3 Star pool cue, and a 3 star switch blade
---
My silent sniper got: 2x 3 star mutant’s railway rifles, and a 3 star medic’s MIRV 
---
(The RNG was butt on my melee but I wasn’t super mad about the sniper)
---
I would love that but with instigating instead. I prefer to do one swing.
---
A few head pieces have some armor or resistance values. Not much- I think 4 is the highest I have seen. But some do.
---
Ok I checked on a bloodied explosive dragon at abt half health abt a tse dragon w no perks to help either and the bloodied is 991 to the tse’s 860 they’re closer than they were let me check other tse to bloodied
---
I have all the rifleman perk cards under perception and all slugger cards under strength (in addition to bloody mess) for both my characters. So both ranged and two-handed Melee are represented.
---
I think you took my luck (and a few other's too), spent 1000 scrip and got 3x 3 star supressor miniguns and other junk (including 2 x assorted zealots ).
---
Hard reset to clear the cache, that's what I normally do when my game crashes, I'm playing on an X btw.
---
Also, there are plans to craft a throwing weapon made from the quills, similar to throwing knives.
---
I have 5 characters: melee, pistol, heavy, shotgun, rifle.
---
If I wanted, melee heavy and shotgun could share a pretty optimal build among them.
---
Rifle and pistol imho no because agi/per vs agi/luck
---
Rifle and melee are not compatible Bc rifle tends to favor perception and melee tends to ignore it.
---
In my server I was the first one to trade with the vendor Messaged my teammate and he fast traveled onto me then like 6 other people fast traveled over
---
If you want a specific build then you need to specialise it. Eventually you can get all the cards required for the builds, but because of the special stats being fixed until 50 (when you can change one special point to another instead of picking a perk card) it means you can’t freely switch them. I mean melee is a lot of STR and END, but rifles don’t really need them. So a jack of all combination of the two will just be rather inferior and won’t scratch that particular itch.
---
Yeah yeah one of those
---
Just checked my handmade at a bit less than a third health and the tse does ever so slightly less at that point but that's still a nerf as I used to run round with half health and it did way more
---
I rolled about 35 3* ranged weapons. Of those, 5 were good rolls, one was (at least before the last duping garbage) a 20k caps piece. So 29 were recycling fodder.  
---
I can unequivocally say that is an improvement. I’m one of those “work 8 hours, paid 8 hours” guys you alluded to and it’s paid off for me. 
---
I also was savvy enough to stockpile enough legendary items to be able to roll at least 1 item a day on each toon and sometimes two for weeks to come.  
---
And the skill based rewards? Those are the weapon challenges in survival, and there’s been at least one *good* weapon come out of that.
---
Kind of the Holy Grail of melee weapons.....
---
I didn’t notice a nerf but the tse defiantly got an amp
---
Well, the anti-armor weapon ignores armor and thus does more damage. The Berserker effect increases damage as your damage resistance decreases. If you want to see the effect of the legendary, you need to minimize your armor rating.
---
Try equipping it naked and see what the damage is. There's no guarantee that it will be better than the AA effect, though.
---
I can totally buy a fusion core off you to get you into the pool if you want to compete. Just send me a friend request in game and I will get you hooked up before it starts
---
Oh? How so, at this point in time the Brotherhood seemed to help rid the wastes of the scorched plague and aided the responders. And guess what they all died, so as far as lore goes we are picking up where they left off and forging a new
---
Where can I find the purveyor? I went to where it’s supposed to be and couldn’t find it
---
Any chance that the Purveyor's Loot Table doesn't mesh 100% with the table that the game uses to validate your inventory upon initial login?  Sounds like that would cause these symptoms...
---
Actually my bloodied melee got an amp too it’s 200-300 higher but it may be adrenal reaction my non legendary bone hammer did a little over 1k and now it does 875
---
I doubt they'll be released again, sorry to say I think you missed out.
---
Big B is gonna want you to trade those weapons you don’t want to people who do?  I think they still want that trade market.
---
They may be level locked?
---
explain this term?
---
Had no idea the AA would surpass an explosive mod  really, i think thats what took me by surprise and made me doubt about berserk effect
---
I use them all the time
---
Many builds are viable (in fact, best in class) at low health. I mean 20% or less when I say low.
---
For example, the invisible sniper. Chameleon, unyielding, stealth, VATS - bloodied plus adrenal pushes their damage into insane levels. And because they are so sneaky, death is really rare.
---
Or the bloodied PA tank (what I play) who uses PA with emergency protocols, dodgy, action boy, nerd rage.....more or less unkillable and effective anywhere.
---
Both examples will outdamage TSE.
---
HAVING SAID THAT :)
---
There is a certain attraction to not having to spec for defense (you can have a Jetpack!) and just going lolmode with it. This is where TSE shines. You could try out the Vanguard, Fireproof, Serendipity, Evasive, Ironclad, Barbarian, Dodgy toon - nothing can kill it. Nothing. You can fire your TSE into an enemy point blank and you cannot die. That's a bit extreme, I realise, but it's also good.
---
For most, TSE or AAE are the way to go. I just like synergies and min-maxing. For a player who really doesn't like managing shit like low health, go those.
---
But bloodied being viable only in melee? No.
---
Makes sense if they took damage off guns. I think they want bloodied to just be melees with a dragon
---
Best answer
---
I never thought of that. It's good that i've kept 2 good medics for rainy days
---
Dragons went up a while back so there is some rebalancing going on here it seems
---
Following
---
Which is your best
---
You tryin to sell that ultracite gatling laser? If you still have it that is.
---
u/Hjrothnar \-- I can get myself and another person in if you are doing around 9PM CST
---
You have no idea how many people are playing.
---
Yeah ig feels like a bug tho my bone hammer dmg went from over 1k to 875 and only serums could effect that
---
Would be a lot better but I don't think it'll come anytime soon
---
I’d assume they scale. But being 50+ all mine were maxed at 45-50 anyway... so I’m not entirely sure
---
That’s fine mate, and we are different because one of our amazing scribes has created a separate website to keep track of mission turn ins/ completions and promotions properly, so discord is a source for our officers to post daily missions and weekly campaigns for members to complete as well as a way for us to all chat and we are cross plat and we use the tracker website we made to keep track of it all. Don’t need a nickname because we are the Brotherhood rising from the failure of those before us. Helping any way we can to restore Appalachia and rid it of the plague
---
Yes, my experience with loot is the same (and not just good memories, but all loot drops tracked). It can get maybe 4x boost from what you picked up (short term) or what you have on you/stashed when logging in (long term).
---
The loot table is definitely not uniform and a sentence in the P9 notes confirms there is a chance table (where they reduced the chance of getting cryolators). So some items/effects have lower chance in the tables, for example, haven't seen the Double effect for ages.
---
I'm not convinced about only a server-seed table as I've been to many servers in the past months and the preferential drops remained relatively frequent. To verify such server seed, a group should farm legendaries with practically empty stash/equipment and not pick items up. I don't think anybody can afford such nakedness.
---
Of course but since it’s not, this is better than checking the menu over and over
---
Technically at it's best the nocturnal will do more damage than the two shot and since it reliably performs the same for the given time frame instead of being literally hit-or-miss like the two shot it's (slightly) more reliable. 
---
Don't get me wrong, nocturnals are largely hot garbage and given the choice I'd handily pick a two shot over nocturnal. But two shot weapons are highly overrated and much like its cousins the bloodied and the junkie, nocturnal builds can be extremely satisfying and super effective even if they're limited in utility.
---
Not sure, I didn't write them down if they weren't good. Yes, I wrote them down on a piece of paper as I'm visiting my dad and he plays too and I wanted to show him 😂
---
I'll be back home in 3 hours
---
shut up niga 🤰
---
Thanks for the warning man. Even with the risk I’d still buy armor. I, and others, am perfectly happy with the guns I have.
---
If it was a wood piece it wouldn’t have been that good anyway.
---
If you could hold unlimited scripts I would agree to wait, but it’s not gonna be fixed for a couple days to weeks, that’s way too long to wait to start buying armor.
---
Furious Gatling Plasma with 10% damage whilst aiming, it's nasty.
---
A Vampire Explosive 50cal
---
A Quad Explosive Double Barreled Shotgun which is just hilarious to use 😁
---
And then about 10 other guns ranging from useless to meh
---
Wait, what's the Watoga Medical Center daily?  I don't think I recall doing that one?
---
They didn't nerf bloodied, they fixed explosive for shotguns.
---
Explosive should do an extra +20% base damage. For a while this was doing 100% on shotguns (only shotguns).
---
It has been fixed. Not bugged, fixed.
---
They could very easily just do what most multiplayer games with helm slots do which is allow you to hide the helm slot from view but still receive the stats.
---
i got a bloodied explosive handmade from mine, but im a big guns boi
---
Cool, I’d like to check it out if you’d like to trade.  Still tied up but will be on later this evening around 9p ET’ish.  GT: Schuller
---
Very weird how it is effecting some stuff more than others though
---
Yeah idk it could also be amps and nerf tho who knows
---
They appear to all be max.
---
Exactly my next question.  Will I be trading in my 3\* Bloodied Deathclaw? Or are these more "hey, fun new thing to play with for a little while then discard"
---
I would say no since I brought all 4 of my level 4 alts to the purveyor exchanged max level mixed stuff for scripts and all 4 got maxed level 3 star pieces with level 4 characters.
---
Having same issue still on PS4. Frustrating. I want to know the criteria for which quests, dailies and events go into your pip boy and for those that don’t.
---
You can also equip the high capacity backpack for a larger reduced resistance.
---
Spawns are weird in 76. Sometime it feels like nothing spawns at all... or *everything does all at once.* I've gone to Whitesprings where it felt abandoned, then other times when I'm fighting to keep up because there's too much. Same in the silos, or Uranium Fever. Sometimes almost nothing. Sometimes every mole miner on the planet shows up to fight.
---
Scrip it! Before you crash!
---
A Quad Explosive Double Barelled Shotgun, it's fun 😁
---
What's the third mod? I might just make you rich.
---
Someone need to send his mule for one star shopping 😅
---
Yeah I don't have a shotgun but I know they were doing double damage so they reduced it. Never mentioned other weapons though
---
Yeah, that sounded like superstition to me... they're not going to bother going through all that trouble for determining a loot drop. And I think you have the right idea about the rarity type tiers.
---
Getting paid in real life was just an simple example to show how fundamentally flawed this design is. As a player doing content, I expect getting rewarded for the content I do and not 300% more or less, just because RnG. What makes it even worse, people aren't even doing same amount. Some players do less get more, while other do more are getting less. If this was singleplayer game, it wouldn't matter but you see this is online game and in online games it matters.
---
No weapon in this game weighs 50lbs, with or without perks, and having 50lbs of space in my stash makes the perk point kind of irrelevant. The stash space wasn't the problem, as stated in the post, it was a budget issue.
---
There are at least two other "just" BoS groups I can think of off the top of my head. I mean it gets a little confusing when you are communicating and have several groups all claiming to be the brotherhood.
---
Just something to think about. 
---
I have even hear that there is an official Bethesda endorsed Brotherhood group out there.
---
I just love the look
---
True. I still have my 1* instigating super sledge, but keep an additional weapon with better DPS for longer fights.
---
i really enjoyed the pumpgun and the gatling gun for rifles id say a plasma flamer and the lever action were my favourites
---
melee had really cool options but id say the classic power fist or surprisingly the sledgehammer
---
This has been happening more and more frequently. A buddy of mine ran into this problem and he just had to wait it out. He couldn't log on his main for about 4 days. I'd open a ticket with bethesda
---
Try resetting your console
---
Just happened to me too, tried 3 times nothing yet
---
So what you're saying is the problem is management?
---
I have picked up 4 or 5 of the broken cameras from containers since I got it from the tourist. I fixed them and intended to put them in my vending machine for cheap, but I can't. Wasn't sure if dropping them would work either?
---
So do you think it's wise to farm some legendaries before using the purveyor? Get an idea what type of items have been seeded before spending scrip. Worth a shot I suppose.
---
He's an youtuber. Nukes every place that looks interesting and all new places and events from wild appalachia
---
I did this on purpose at my camp, since my machines were a total mess.  Stashing them clears all the items from them.
---
If you just want the rewards for the quests to take the workshop and defend it from npc-monsters, leaving the server right after you've finished those drops the ownership of the workshop. - &gt;I do this because I'm not interested in PvP and loot plenty of junk just exploring.
---
If you want to use the workshop's resource nodes as suggested you have to hold it longer to give them time to produce.
---
How would I reset it
---
I got a 3* and a 2* from whitesprings earlier when I was passing through. And there is usually a legendary or two floating about each time I visit purely so to the sheer quantity of enemies in one place. I’m also always able to loot them. Half the time in other locations when I happen to find a legendary and kill it, it glitched out and either falls through the world or does that reset thing (like when you kill a ghoul when it’s running at you, then when you kill it it vanishes and returns to the default laying down state and you can’t interact with it). Whitesprings seems somewhat stable
---
Yeah, I suspect I won’t be replacing it anytime soon. I don’t run bloodied on my melee alt, just my ranged main.
---
Shoot a photo on the Top of the World of 2 other players (one dead) while being drunk, and oh one of the players has to wear a Grognar costume, the other a bikini, and... and... let's have two deathclaws in there, that are siblings or otherwise related, one irradiated, one deseased... ehm... and everybody in the picture has to wear a witch hat. Including the deathclaws... also the fallen space station has to be in the background. And it has to wear a witch hat, too... Did I mention everybody has to be drunk? On different alcohols? Including the deathclaws.
---
u/Valseek
---
same.  what a joke.
---
It would be cool to have a quick access interface for all ongoing events and those events in queue/cool-down.
---
I'm keeping one thing out of the 1k scip I spent and I still love it
---
Did the same thing. My friend was frustrated about having to server hop for such an important piece of the game currently &amp; I offered to give him one for free &amp; found out I can’t
---
this is one reason why I stash all my scrap before heading to one of those, made the mistake of not doing so before and having people take it.
---
I can understand that of course and it’s definitely an idea, although I don’t know of any that use or system of missions, campaigns and method of keeping track of it all. 
---
If you’d like to grab a link to check the place out we are open for any to come if they are just a guest or someone wanting to join.
---
Also that’s the goal, would love to be even seen by Bethesda
---
Supposed to scale, but I don't think they do right now (not in game ATM).
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/bpf5hp/the_legendary_vendor_drops_is_level_based/
---
Yes like Diamond City and Diamond City Market
---
I love my PS4 pro, but I deliberately saved for a Xbox one x to play 76 for this exact reason. For some reason PlayStation always has some kind of connectivity issue.
---
I agree
---
I got crushed hopes and dreams
---
My totally not optimal melee/pistols/shotguns build can do all the content in the game with no problems. Launching nukes, solo, scorchbeasts and the burrows are no problem.  
---
But to do the max amount of damage possible, you need to specialize.
---
I will need to check but it's a toss up between a BOS sentinel unyielding piece and a forest scout Vanguard chest piece, I think lol..need to check again!
---
Yeah. Fallout New Vegas' story is more of an actual Fallout 3 than the actual Fallout 3. New Vegas continues the story of the NCR and the region, as well as stories of NPCs (Marcus, Cassidy via his daughter), and the general region. The only thing it was missing was Harold, but Bethesda kind of forced him onto the east coast.
---
They scale to the player.

Well I certainly hope she gives you better stuff soon :(
---
google "reset [console name]"
---
Agreed. It's just one too many menus to go through. 
---
What might also help is allowing us to track the individual components of each badge, so you could tag like 5 out of the 22 parts of a possum badge and see them as an onscreen quest. The current badge tracking is worthless as it is though.
---
Always have a hazmat suit on the favorites wheel
---
I run junkies.  Do you want to sell it?
---
I have a full set of scout polymer deep pocket sitting in my stash.  Just need to apply legendary to it.  hope that comes down the pike. otherwise if i score some from the vendor that might be cool.
---
when i say full set, yes, it was a grind.  but its badass.  then i got into legendary armor...
---
Wood armor and Assaultron heads come only in 1* variants. That's why they revert back.
---
You can either accept that, or keep crying.
---
Hot laser pistol and laser gatling garbage. Straight back to the scrip machine tomorrow with 'em.
---
I’ve been getting kicked a lot  since the backpack update. In fact I just got kicked now and went on here to complain and saw your post. I think it’s because the dupers are back
---
That's why I don't buy online games for PlayStation.
---
Seems connectivity is an issue with PS a lot more than any game on any other online system.
---
PlayStation = best single player experience
---
Xbox = best online experience
---
(In my experience and many others... Maybe not yours)
---
(Not referring to PC. Pc Master race.)
---
I'm going to go test to be sure, but I'm pretty sure you're not talking about the same entrance they are- it's about 50 feet from where you spawn, to the right of the main entrance, not around the building.
---
Bought some on my lvl 19 max level &gt;&lt;
---
PlayStation has never given me any connectivity issues before fallout 76
---
RNG not being very kind, I see :( there's always tomorrow!
---
My dream gun, ugh.
---
Not too sure yet, I run bloodied with all unyielding, was thinking about trying junkies as well. It’s essentially the same but chems/alcohol. Which is better then sacrificing health. I got quite a few op junkie pieces
---
I do too. I have enough of those in the real world xD
---
Welcome to RNG.
---
Fully upgraded level 1 leather armor couple stems purified water maybe a little food.
---
Where is he??
---
Bloodied swing speed Grognak axe with +1 strength!
---
That's a great question, I too would like to know the answer
---
Yes it has a tree right behind it and a table and chairs in front. 
---
There's a cliff below with a sleeping bag and a spawning cap stash and I think a recipe but I could be wrong about that last bit.
---
:O!!!!!! Fuck yeah dude! Congrats!!
---
I did the exact same set of three.
---
I love it!
---
Yeah fallout 4's brotherhood where extremists the Appalachian chapter seemed to be more noble in there goals. Better then raiders or enclave at least
---
Good axe.  Only weapon I ever bought from another player for 2750.  Happy you got yours!  *Chop that meat!*
---
I blew all my wad on two chars and got absolute garbage :(
---
What are the stats of the Flamer?
---
Near Berkeley Springs
---
I can't confirm, but I think it likely will affect anything with the spoil mechanic.
---
doing your laundry!
---
Why would you not be able to use the hardware store? Seriously, there is one in just about every town in America. They'll still be there full of millions of screws, nails, ect.  And you don't have to pay. 
---
And massive indoor lumber yards like Lowes or Home Depot are a thing. Again, like I said, you'd have to be selective but all of that wood sitting inside a fairly secure metal building could absolutely maintain for 25 years. 
---
Especially the lumber treated for pests and rot. 
---
I can't imagine the Fallout world doesnt have that too 50 years into the future. 
---
The noise is an issue I suppose but you should have a few guards posted. But that's just everyday common sense.

Unyeilding Sentinel with AP refresh - pvp

Now you’ve got me thinking. If I have full health, does it give me +1 SPCIAL per piece?
---
What isnt lore friendly?  Im curious
---
Uffff nice..so u chose armor
---
Flaw?  What is this flaw you speak of?  🤣
---
 Besides, that's what my purifiers are for.
---
I did Archer, Mammalogist and Swimmer - easy and not buggy
---
Thanks! I might need to switch to my wild man rags.
---
You never collect flux at fissure prime expecting to get anything but flux. Usually not enough mobs to make it worth it unless you already have a stock pile. Plus the new thing to do is nuke it so most of the nuke zone is off the map. So they dont have to fight her in the nuke zone.
---
Scout Armor with the above mention legendary effects.
---
Once I'm home I'll suss it out again and send you a map link.
---
Edit: just realized I'm prob. gonna F\* up some peoples base placements lol
---
I have four machines and all are showing 0/30 for their inventory. They we're all set up prior to my camp change and each is independent of the others when stocked.
---
This is my first time getting connectivity errors in fallout
---
Were you here in the beginning when the game first released?
---
Yes I was
---
Lot of pve peeps like unyielding + weapons weight reduction.
---
Upvote this art.
---
I'm not as experienced with the Mire yet. Plan to head out there to find the sweet spots soon though
---
Then you’re lucky. Ffxiv, paladins, overwatch, fortnite, all of them have had issues for me in the past, and fairly often one one game or another. When I use my Xbox though for Fallout 76 or Apex I never have any issues unless it’s a specific server side issue in the game due to a glitch or the way it handles a situation.
---
As someone else has noted, it means that you don’t have to make a style versus function choice. fo4 had a limited number of functional headgear so you wore those all the time (until you installed mods). Why reward us with good hats if everyone in the game is wearing a combat helmet?
---
The only helmets that intentionally provide armor are power armor helmets, which helps make them viable when compared to legendary gear.
---
Because most of the stores have been looted by prior survivors and/or exposed to the very not friendly elements of WV for 25 years. 
---
Lumber treated for pests and rot is not immune to either of those things, especially without a human hand to help out in maintenance.
---
We have plenty of buildings in the game that show the results of the materials they used to build as an example of where the materials used end up after decades of neglect.
---
Dayum. Nice.
---
Yes, it was completely the right move, armour is easy to manage weight wise and widely sought after so trading it for weapons is easy if you have the right pieces.
---
While it's annoying that I have to redo each machine, that's not my main issue. The bigger problem is I can't add anything to the machines despite showing 0/30 as their individual inventory.
---
I nuke people's bases when I don't like their prices. So far I have got 7 who never moved before the nuke touched down.

And you didn’t experience the constant disconnects, freezes and crashes that everyone was experiencing several times an hour when duping was at its worst?
---
Nice!! :D
---
it's my favorite place! I try to find a home elsewhere and always return back.
---
Not OP but i tested with a Ghoul Slayer, +1 Agility, Food/Drink/Chem -20% Left Arm.
---
Does not keep the agility or weight reductions after a log out/in, checked the special stats page, and also my current carry weight - neither changed when equipping the armour after relogging in.
---
Perhaps if you check the server out you can give us some criticism, one can only grow with knowledge of what to change 👍
---
That's next level hatred.
---
Why not just do a shit on their bed.
---
I can't say for certain without knowing insider specifics. I have stuff fail in prod that passed in test, and it's usually a problem with test environment configuration. 
---
I also have stuff fail in prod because I'm rather lazy and tend toward overconfidence, so working in a smaller shop I *might* sometimes push out code without full regression testing, breaking existing functionality I didn't even think I was touching. That kind of thing shouldn't happen in top notch development studio, but...
---
Omg I'm so jealous.. I've started my irl collection as well. As I sit here I'm drinking mtdew from a nuka cola bottle lol.
---
Almost every BoS group I have seen (even the named ones) all have mission systems and tracking methods of some sort.
---
I had a lot of rads at the time so that made it a bit more difficult then it had to be but it's definitely a challenge.
---
I'm not sure if they are levelled to your current level - but if they aren't and are at the 15\~ range (my level currently) you may want to scram and hit Ten before going back.
---
As a solo player I avoided swimmer due to the “revive someone in water” part. Just seems very unlikely to happen for me xD
---
Yeah but people who play with others can still complete the solo challenges. It doesn’t work the other way around.
---
You got a two shot explosive suppressors gatling gun from the vendor? How did you manage to get two primary legendary effects?
---
2nd projectile only does +25% damage for Two Shot, and the Crossbow is really weak regardless of effect
---
Not sure if this works but if you have nuka grenades I'm throwing at the ground even while in passive it should generate a radiation field that will affect them. The large explosion usually jars some people awake.
---
This. Took me forever to realize this.
---
You might just be too out of the way then, because I sell tons of Plans and Recipes when I'm on. Or you're on at a bad time.
---
I'm currently camped out in a Monorail car near the Pylon location. 
---
It's sweet and I love it and will return - but I'm ready for something new
---
Purchased with my level 6 alt mule...max level
---
Don't know honestly but I freaked don't because I didn't know that combo was even possible
---
I feel your pain except I got a whole set 3 star wood armor
---
Thanks for the advice everyone, ive decided I'm gonna make this character a hybrid as im not too fussed on min/maxing at the moment. But ill make pure characters in the future! Thanks again!
---
Someone missed where _being in a cult is the exact same point._
---
yeah would love to get a lil more specific on what i am trying to roll for, like rifles for my sniper, pistols for my pistol character and melee for that one.
---
IIRC while listening to her raider radio she says something along of the lines of helping her with some different raider stuff. Reclaiming what the raiders once had and what not. She says " it might be soon, it might not". "I dont know im a fickle misstress". So IMO it sounds like there is content planned in the future. Wouldn't surprise me if it comes up with the faction wars that was mentioned a while ago.
---
Yea its the assaultron head as well. Hopefully nothing else is affected, If thats the case then its all good.
---
Hard to find a "dependable" method, I usually can't see the tend until I've looted 50+ Legendaries, but occasionally I get tight groupings like today.   
---
Personally I plan to turn in half my script, check for a pattern and server hop if it's obviously bad.
---
Ah that sucks. So only doing 114 damage before sneak multiplier
---
Yeah I want a bullet belt on my spacesuit haha
---
I know that spot! it *is* sweet! I tried building around a monorail car out in the Savage divide once but missed my mire. #swampwitchforlife
---
Builds put to one side... say you had someone with a tse and someone with a bloodied gun - both with the same gun. What would be the point in the bloodied weapon with you having to have 20% health to match or ever so slightly better the damage? That's what I'm saying..
---
Now add on all the perks you listed to both players.. what would be the point in me having 20% health vs full health, just so I could use serendipity and nerd rage.. it would be a very minor advantage still vs the health trade off between the two players.
---
I've tried playing pve with all the appropriate perks at 20% health. You die very oftern unless you are just playing against one enemy at a time. I still don't see the trade off as being equal
---
Why did I get a downvote for asking such a simple question that I can't google?
---
I agree with this.
---
Yeah the crossbow could be really fun to use, if it actually did damage
---
Horseshit.
---
That's 2 primaries on one item. Can't happen.
---
Even among the worst of the bugs we were all here for and lol'd at, this was never a thing. Or in FO4 either, which this engine was recycled from.
---
It just didn't happen.
---
Yelling "FORE!" while bashing Ghoul heads is very pleasing haha. I one-shot most high level ghouls with it :D
---
Agreed, I want the full set but it might take a while since there's two different camo styles. Hope they add more in the future
---
Considering how easy it is not really it's just a long fight not like its extremely hard
---
Man, you sure are pissed over an insignificant option at a trader in a entertainment product.
---
You're first mistake was thinking the customer has any rights or say in the product that they consume. Thats hilarious. Especially when they have already consumed what they paid for. You're bitching about free extras. That's the definition of entitlement. 
---
And to use No Man's Sky as an example is also hilarious. It's a game that a rocky but alright start because it was pushed out because of corporate greed but then became pretty much everything it promised to be in a relatively quick amount of time. Sounds pretty much like 76 to me. 
---
I'm not even going to touch your edit other than to say that it clearly points out that you are entitled AND completly full of yourself. Perfect example of Dunning-Krueger in effect.
---
Nice! Golf clubs are a lot more fun than I thought they would be
---
No west tek is better.
---
Fuck those are expensive. I ont have the caps and itll be along time before I do. Sad day. Anyone on ps4 selling it cheap?
---
AFAIK the total damage, including the two shot effect is included in the stats. It’s 25% higher than a single shot, not double. They changed that when they nerfed two shot weapons several months ago.
---
Yeah, it's a shame really. Would be great if it had higher fire rate too. Only seems fun to use on low-level enemies
---
Do you have rifleman?
---
You're like a wooden unicorn now
---
https://imgur.com/MFaRDMA
---
Here's the link to the image. A few people have also reported finding them on the trade Reddit so I doubt that it's super rare.
---
I'm glad I'm not the only one who took one look at that Jar and was like 'F\*\*\* this hard'. 
---
Yeah I'm not down for passive-animal sadism.
---
I like the theory, but I see the inverse..  
---
Personally had in my stash and used Vampiric weapons since a couple weeks Into the game  (I'm 369 ATM) and nearly every Vampiric weapon I have Was traded for...   
---
BUT at the same time, I wear weightless armor under my PA and do loot an unusually high amount of weightless armor..   
---
So who knows..
---
I also feel like there should be more entries under the Science section like the bottled scorched body parts you can find.
---
Crossbow is still very usable, but you must get a sneak crit every time. I found it to be incredible for stealth
---
I spent 600 on 6 ranged legendarys, all shit guns. Sold the worst to get another 100. Another crap radium gun with crap perks.
---
I can still hear the legendary vendor laughing..
---
Rage 2 just launched if you need a diversion.
---
Whitespring, but don't just hit the club house. Start there and work your way left of the tennis court coming out of the club house. Run down the guest houses making your way towards the train station. Sometimes i get more legendaries out of the guest houses than the club house itself.
---
You can get lucky at West tek sometimes, but you'll mostly get 1-3 per run. The new burrows area under Harper's ferry is okay for a handful, but i always forget about it.
---
Very nice! Good luck with the scratch card :D
---
Added you, back online tomorrow
---
Literally a blood bath in Survival! Or invisible campers.
---
Can confirm - 3 star purchase became 2 star assaultron head shortly afterwards....
---
Time to start your pirate roleplay, Captain!
---
Not lucky, I just don’t play any of those games lol. Although I now remember destiny 1 used to give me connectivity issues way back in the day
---
Yeah, why is that a problem? Clear communication of what we want lets them make a better game. If they continually make a better game more people play and possibly spend money on atom points.
---
It's a win win for all involved. Why do you think that's a problem?
---
Ah, thanks for that. That explains why a base LVL 45 Crossbow does 74 and mine does 91.
---
It could just be patterns we want to see as humans but I do know you’re a respected member in this community and will get to the bottom of this.
---
Interesting. That is crazy. 
---
I ran into a bump and it said I was out of camp budget, I unloaded some stash and it worked. 
---
Something’s fishy, I hope we get an increase to both stash and budget.
---
It's the Scorchpocalypse.
---
Dale damage
---
Is the Revolver for sale?
---
Nope, is it worth using it for the crossbow?
---
I do know. And it's not.
---
At lowest possible DR, Berserker’s currently does +38.2% damage. It was +50% at 0 DR but the Pip Boy currently adds 1 DR. IIRC AA does ~+29.5% damage after DR calculations. If you have enough DR, then yes, Berserker’s will make your weapon do even less damage than a non-legendary normal version of that weapon
---
I know that. My furious weopon was favorited. I was trying to scrap the other, they both disappeared?
---
Yarrrrr, it's driving me nuts!
---
The coolest builds I’ve ever seen were found in the ash heap. I will check out those camps 100% of the time just to see what kind of build someone unique enough to build there can come up with. 
---
But you’re right - they are so rare. Seen 3 of them since player vending started
---
I own both TSE and BE. At 20% , Bloodied is A LOT better than TSE. If you don't know the build then you simply can't compare. Bloodied benefits from Adrenal Reaction and Nerd Rage and the weapons break x2 slower. Plus, you kinda get a sense of danger when you play because you can always die if you're not carefully. TSE is just lazy.
---
link says bandwidth limit exceeded
---
Wait is the suppressers the one that allows more damage while aiming or not cause I'm pretty sure that's the surpressers effect
---
yeah - you kinda need a partner for it.
---
Excellent idea. Save us all a lot of travel caps.
---
&gt;And the skill based rewards? Those are the weapon challenges in survival, and there’s been at least one   
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;good weapon come out of that.
---
None of those weapons were good. Most didn't even get past +10% boost to damage  and those few that got past 10% line, stayed on par with TS. TS aint rare weapons, I sell them for 100 caps in my vending machines. 
---
When TSE comes with +65% boos to damage, if your weapon doesn't bring such boost, it is "garbage" weapon, because TSE can moderately easily obtain from market for 16k. That money is nothing, especially on time where salt is being sold for 25k.
---
You didn't work for 8 hours, you worked 40 hours, got paid for 8 hours while player next to you just rolled once and got TSE. He didn't even bother filling his scrip limit on one character, while you did 3 times and more. He was the worker, that was first day at his job, walked into office and boss just randomly pointed at him and gave 8 hours worth of wage to him, just because finger landed on him.
---
Woah, now like in so many movies and shows, you can re-create scenes of sneaking up with a shovel and knocking enemies out in the back of the head XD
---
Yeah, only seems decent for stealth builds with crazy damage multipliers. Would be great if it had a slightly higher fire rate
---
it's not the free range event, on this one the robot is still alive and there's no event, you just kill the sheepsquash, you don't have to take them anywhere. happened to me waay north on the mire, it's a random encounter
---
I turned my junk legendaries into a couple of really nice pieces and a couple of not so good pieces. I needed to upgrade my armor severely and I accomplished that feat. Sounds like a win to me. 
---
Blessed  Mother Myrughq is what I call her!
---
Yep!  I think it's nice that they made workshop defenses somewhat challenging.
---
Wow that’s actually perfect! I’ve got an idea in mind to create the [glow](https://pyrofarms.com/collections/frontpage/products/pyrodinos200ml)
---
Dropping them will destroy them.
---
The broken cameras you pick up in the world do not work for this quest. Only the ones picked up from the tourist initiate the quest &amp; allow you to craft the camera.
---
1. 3x ranged weapon = aggressortronhead damnnn... thats disappointing :( 
---
2. 3x ranged weapon = 10mm machinegun mhmm not that bad...
---
3.(and final pick) again 3xranged weapon= explosive pumpgun letssss goooo huuuuge rng&lt;3
---
Which weapons do you have? I used to play at half health so that's how I've noticed the difference. At 20% they still exceed tses but some of them not by much now. Has been confirmed lower down in the thread
---
...which reminds me...anyone know where the last holotape is? Do I need to turn the quest back on? I'm evidently missing one.
---
The Rail-Enthusiast challenge was definitely meant for you haha
---
In my experience, with zero scientific fact to back it up, I feel like weapon and armor rolls are tied to the server you spawn in on somehow. I'm probably wrong but I've noticed in whitesprings runs, I either end up with the same prefix over and over, all low level items, and then if I hop servers I'll get all good stuff on another run. 
---
Before the purveyor hit I ran white springs and got trash. Got trash from her as well. Went on an hour later and did another ws run and most was decent, did the sbq and got great stuff. But again no data to back it up.
---
With rifleman an instigating crossbow one shots mutants if my memory serves me right, I haven't played with it in a while but fully perked is it decent
---
I like your idea but I feel like it’s just going to be more stuff that doesn’t clip in properly
---
Oooof! Hope you have better luck next time :(
---
Does anyone actually use assaultron heads? I never see them used in game.
---
are you sure what you thought was a legendary effect wasn't actually a mod that you changed? Like "Sharpshooters" or "Leaded"?
---
Or I should say not as much as they did a few weeks back
---
I was planning on it, but the machine was out of scrip for the day so I threw it in my machine for 1k and someone bought it an hour ago.
---
Yes I'm sure I got it from the new legendary vendor
---
&gt; being out of AP does not affect your ability to jump
---
it does though, running out of AP mid-jump results in the jump magically coming to a halt and you falling to the ground
---
I heard those gatling plasmas are pretty good againts bosses so thats awesome! You should def rename that shotgun to Boomstick! haha
---
"content"
---
ugh
---
Damn, nice!
---
thanks, me too.
---
I think it's a great question. Raw flux does appear in the Aid tab. I'd work my butt off to get that mod for this alone.
---
The game should automatically fast travel you to your CAMP if you AFK while at the Purveyor.
---
A marquee they snap to would be amazing
---
I'll take a gander when I jump back on tonight. I'm PS4 btw
---
1k isnt bad.
---
They could have easily used her to force pvp. Have her pick a random player camp and tell you to go destroy something like a generator or something. You'd get xp and caps for doing it. Or steal something from Whitespring without getting caught. Something less wholesome than the other quests in game. The only remotely shady stuff you do is for that annoying mayor of Grafton.
---
Of course, I’m always accepting criticism. But if you wish to criticize further I ask you see everything first before lumping us with the other servers aha no hate to them at all by any means I just know that probably very little if any at all use the same tracking methods as us and even the way our missions are set may vary but there’s only so much one can do that stands them out above the rest and with that any little bit counts. Hell we are even open to the option of getting all the servers to work together to further expand the experience.
---
BE Handmade and BE Lever Rifle. The thing is that the highest damage for bloodied comes only at 20% when nerd rage and adrenal kicks in. The damage is pretty low at 50%,i agree.
---
I'll see what the stats are tonight, I'm PS4.
---
It may be too much for you, but at a high level, multi-Scorchbeast battles are a lot of fun.
---
Sounds like a typical Walmart to me
---
You can at least keep it for some of he xbow achievements and archery tadpole badge.
---
That's unfortunate I have scraped hunters long coat more than 2 times lol so I feel u
---
Only for photo ops. Dont they still use all your ammo or did they finally fix that?
---
Suppressor is a primary modifier. That’s opponent’s damage decreased by 20%. 10% damage while aiming is a minor modifier.
---
I find the other parts of the assaultron more pleasurable to use.
---
That's a pretty gun. I really wish they would bring the camo soon back
---
Definitely as you can use 3x max rifleman perk for a decent damage increase, tank killer works with it too. Add bloody mess and it actually becomes pretty viable.
---
I came across a new one the other day. The Mr. Handy was yelling help like the encounter where it thinks it will self destruct. I hit interact and it's name changed to Mr. Robberbot and it tried to rob me, lol. 
---
I shot the heck out of it!
---
Since then I've seen two other people mention a similar encounter only it was an eyebot or a protectron.
---
Also that’s 200+ years into the future aha so technically speaking non of us should even know about that, let alone compare them to the Appalachian chapter.
---
Would love that
---
Suppressor is the one that reduces the damage done by your target.
---
Might depend on number of stars..tried with 2 stars and they are on level.
---
Well the heart emotes came out eventually, so.. it was a little different
---
&gt; because I didn't know that combo was even possible
---
hint:  its not.  like, zero.
---
If you've got a full set in unyielding either will be perfectly fine. BoS combat will probably give slightly more DR/ER but marine will give more radiation resistance, which is huge for a bloody build, imo. The rad resistance makes it easier to keep your reads in the sweet spot to maximize your special stats.
---
I currently have a full set of unyielding BoS combat but I'm trying to piece together a full marine set.
---
 "NotBanned_" is my name on playstation.
---
I love this! I could see all of these facts stated in the ending slides in FO3 and NV. Awesome! ( picks up phone ) “Get me Ron Pearlman!”
---
Had three at bog town today. A lvl 80, 65, and a 50. Loved it but killed my resources too. Kinda a blessing though because of max stash.
---
Xbox.
---
I feel like she should have been the main DJ for the game, and Appalachia radio would have been her snippets of speech in between all the songs. It would be awesome if they kept her voice actress around to record tidbits every now and then when new content comes out, similar to how Three-Dog would give regional news. It would give more incentive to use the radio even after hearing the songs N number of times, it would give her character something to do after you finish her quests, and it would add life to the world instead of having to stumble across posters or random locations to start quests.
---
Imagine if in addition to the poster, you could get the sheepsquatch quest from listening to her on the radio, or the scouts, burrows, etc. It would be way more fun.
---
I'm on PC, sorry! thanks anyway!
---
No, that's not Suppressor.  Suppressor reduces the damage output of your target by X% for Y seconds.  The effect you describe doesn't have a name.
---
Take a picture at midnight of two SBQs fighting an alpha deathclaw under a bridge, while wearing a clean spacesuit and wielding a shovel
---
Already finished Rage 2 yesterday while waiting for the purveyor and daily restocks...
---
Yeah it has changed. Can you check your be handmade and tse handmade for me at half health and tell me which does more damage just so I can compare to mine. I may do anyway but adrenal reaction used to be bugged and you had to reapply it so just trying to work out if that's worth trying or not
---
Supressors reduces enemy damage output after a hit. +10% damage while aiming is a possible secons slot roll though. It doesn't have a fancy name
---
What perk cards did you use with it?
---
*Sigh* Mine was just meh. Better luck next time.
---
The elbow is the best part.
---
I can totally believe this as I got 2 pieces of cav/ass from farming the robots in watoga on the same server ( before they nerfed em ).
---
Maybe trade 2 legendaries if they're both crap jump server and trade another 2 etc
---
Good luck. All my throws were terrible for my character, but decent overall. I bet there's gonna be alot of weird legendaries for sale soon
---
And the nuke didn’t upgrade the Purveyor? I’m legit disappointed.
---
It's probably not a bad idea, as Berkeley Springs is fairly central on the eastern half of the world too.
---
&gt; Then once you get in game and start working towards that you may never get there because the perk cards are random!  
---
are you guys gonna stream this? im on xbox but would like to watch, idk
---
Fairly certain salty FO76 haters have set up bots to downvote everything.
---
Several solid ones ... turned in about 3000 scrip (3 characters)
---
Best
---
 - Vampire, 10% Damage when aiming, faster reload gatling laser ... I prefer the plasma, but this is a squatch and queen face tanker if I ever saw one
---
Good with the right build or very situational
---
 - Instigating, Vats Crit, RW pump shotgun - solid PVE destroyer for crit fishers
---
- Medics, explosive, 15% faster reload lever action rifle
---
 - Quad, limb damage, faster movement pump action shotgun ... when you absolutely want to leg the ghouls to help your lowbie friends farm; I’d prefer this on a combat shorty but this will work.
---
 - Instigating, 40% more PA damage, 90% RW ... pick axe ... been great on a better weapon but going to save it and use it esp. for silo runs. I have a 1* Instigating Super Sledge that is my solo clearing work-horse.  Pick axe likely looks cooler and doesn’t make the annoying sound.
---
In the “funny but likely won’t use” category
---
 - Medics, 25% less AP cost, VATS crits do 50% more ... broadsider 
---
 - Quad, VATS crit do +50%, 25% less VATS cost ... harpoon gun
---
Both of these are in the “when you want to comically kill one thing” category.  I’d love to see those rolls on other weapons. Anything that isn’t a harpoon or broadsider.
---
ASSaultron
---
You know, I thought something looked really odd about it.  I was just eyeing it and thinking the effects were pretty weak and the name didn't seem right.  It didn't occur to me that it's missing the prefix until you said something.  It's kinda like All Rise and other weapons like that I guess, but without the fancy name.
---
I got not one but two as well
---
Yeah, I agree.  Especially if you're going to fight the SBQ, you need about 100 RR to counter her Rads, and Marine Armor goes a long way to getting you there. 
---
Also, as Dense goes, Marine Armor Dense mods have always been more common than the others.
---
Much better days and much better challenges.  I already see some ppl talking like the old challenges were "too easy" and just giving free atoms away like candy.  I don't agree with that at all. Maybe I don't have the camera yet, maybe I don't have someone to play with, maybe I don't have several hours a day to play that revolves around luck and a partner and a lot of time spent to collect. 
---
But more than that, even if atoms were "too easy" to get.... whatever that even means... it doesn't jusify the ridiculous prices of these items in the store. Sorry but 14+ bucks for a re-paint skin on some Power Armor or assets from FO4 isn't worth dozens of hours of challenge grinding in this new system. The old "too easy" way where someone can get their dailies done with some casual play?  Maybe, but def not this.
---
The things in the atom shop across the board should cost a heck of a lot less, it's overpriced as it is. And then we should get a list of activity options per day and week that we can choose from to get atom reward maximums from. Like we get a list of 10 activities for the daily and get to choose 5 of them (for a max of 50 atoms per day or w/e) to do.
---
LadyDevann just confirmed in my thread on the official boards that this is being looked into like the wood armors.
---
I run around with some other people from  [/r/Fo76FilthyCasuals](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fo76FilthyCasuals)  and we all help each other complete dailies, challenges, and quests. You can add me: gilpo. I'm on from 9p-1a eastern almost every night. My camp is centrally located and I play with a single character and don't server hop so they use my base for workbenches, trading, fast travel, etc.
---
Yeah, but once you hit 50 you can choose what ever card you want or you can respec.   It has to work different, as the nature of most online multiplayer games do.
---
Toss up between  
---
Quad explosive 90% reduced weight 10mm pistol  
---
Vampire 50% crit damage +50 DR while aiming pipe revolver. Purely because it's a legendary pipe revolver.
---
It's completely bizarre, yeah.  I wonder if it'll fix itself or not.  It was 3-star when I got it but I can't remember what it was before I logged off, and it changed while I was offline.
---
Yes, from my experience, berserker will put you below the amount of damage a non legendary will do, if you have a decent amount of armor on (I think I was around 120 physical)
---
I think this is the case too. Since I've started playing I'd gotten basically no weapon legendary drops. Then in the past few days I've found 4 servers that drop legendaries from basically every other ghoul and every 3rd or 4th super mutie and they've been (eyeballed) 40% weapons 60% armor. At this point I'll do a run of WS, see what kinda loot drops and server hop if it doesn't stack up.
---
Probably, but I won't be back home for a few hours.
---
How much you offering
---
Oh cool. My bad. I didn’t completely absorb that mr handy was still alive in this scenario. Thanks
---
As a melee build,  I don't really consider scorchbeasts challenging.  Just really fucking annoying.
---
Every time I see a wood pile irl my instinct is to go click on it lol
---
3 times more easy ultracite. Not sure what the complaint is?
---
AMAZING job!!!
---
To be fair, even 3 Scorchbeasts isn't THAT challenging. Especially when playing in a squad or even solo with decent turrets.
---
Edit: Think of that upkeep as exp, loot, and fun?
---
I haven't really thought about to to be honest. I wasn't really sure what kind of interest there might be.
---
Honestly to make it exciting I think the players themselves would have to stream it so you could see the actual gameplay. I will pitch it to them tonight :)
---
Hi, somebody find a solution? Everytime I open the bethesda launcher the screen start to flashing/flickering and it does in Fo76 too. 
---
I have 1440p 144hz monitor and a rtx2080, never had this problem with my previous gtx1050ti..
---
\+250 DR on reload, also i am on PC
---
Maybe for PC if you keep an electronic file. On console, must set ups don't have a table. *Maybe* a coffee table at best.
---
I am glad you got that off your chest.. 
---
get anything good from the legendary vendor today?
---
Thank you! So cool :)
---
Thank you :)
---
How come I can play a mini game on a google search bar when there is no internet connected ???
---
I gotta give it to you on Sentinel and Cavalier
---
Feel ya bro. I hate perk card system in this one. Better skill system is in games like ark or conan exiles where you have limited points but this is still transparent. For me best perk system had fallout 3 and NV where you just had to unlock those without constant need of respec etc. Of course there are few skills that are "have to" (like lockpicking or gun nut) but it's allow you to have what build you want without wondering "do i have enough s.p.e.c.i.a.l. Points to have level up one more perk?
---
When the Revolver is western max lvl quad explosive 25% less vats im willing to give you 17k for it.
---
Inspect it pls
---
Turns out I had about 1 minute of work left the last time I gave up trying to load an image..... LOL
---
im surprised there arent many camps around it yet on the servers I have visited..
---
I'm fully sneaking, in chameleon armor in the dark, and enemies will spot me from another room sometimes. My map sometime doesn't show them until I'm already shooting their faces.
---
At level 260 I am still trying to fill the gaps.
---
[https://imgur.com/a/UKj3N8E](https://imgur.com/a/UKj3N8E)
---
Unfortunately, i dont have the comparison for Handmade but checked the damage on the BE Handmade and it's 383. I posted the Lever Rifle
---
 Edit : also added a screen with my HP during the screenshots
---
You would need internet to load that page to begin with, also that's an entirely different thing.
---
So they definitely nerfed super duper when you paired it with the ammo perk from agility (the one which gives you 80% more ammo per craft).
---
Usually i got 360 5mm rounds but now i only get 280 from super duper. So they nerfed it to the base value.
---
I would give a left fucking nut for that bitch, It would make a perfect back up for my melee build. Although I would give a right nut also if it had 90% reduced weight.
---
They fixed it. But i burn through it all with my tesla rifle anyways.
---
Agreed wholeheartedly.  I want to pull his wires out every time he says that.
---
The perk cards are not random, did you even play the game? You can pick *any* perk you meet the level requirement for every time you level up. Perk *packs* are random, and in my experience pretty useless, but character planners don't even consider those. And there's no level cap, so if you somehow missed an "essential" perk... just level up again.
---
How does faster fire rate affect weapons like black powder and other one shot reload weapons?
---
I like the cut of your gib
---
Tks never looked at that type of perspective
---
It sucks this bothers you so much. Player trading is a thing you can get anything you want through it. 
---
Perk cards don't seem to be a problem for me I've been able to easily respect my perks. I admit moving 1 point at a time is pretty lame but otherwise no complaints.
---
The gameplay is great and keeps improving. I wouldn't have over 250hrs in the game if it was as bad as you make it sound.
---
Build a bridge get over it it's not perfect but it's far from broken.
---
Oh i get it. Structures would be fucked up pretty fast- but really only wooden structures. Concrete, masonry, glass and metal would be pretty resilient. 
---
Wooden materials in a metal roofed and walled megastore would last way longer then you think. They wouldn't be sitting in rain or pools of water. And bugs may get some of it but they couldn't possibly infest it all so fast. 
---
And that isnt mentioning all the metal studs, drywall, ceramic, ect there as well.
---
Username checks out, you posted this comment twice :D
---
They are not bad, but not worth being a main weapon for anyone higher level. They do look cool and can do a few hundred damage depending on your perks/mutations so it is worth playing around with.
---
The perk cards are absolutely not random.  Some are gated by level, but every card is available to everyone.  You get to choose one each time you level up.
---
You are confusing them with Perk Packs, which happen every 5 levels and give you a random assortment of freebie cards you don't need to spend a level point on.
---
Ouchie
---
I'll have to check them out again I guess; I'm still just sour about it honestly. I haven't used them since way early game still have a bunch of really nice once stored up in my stash on that character. Thanks.
---
I came upon Watoga one time, and there were three people sitting on the benches waiting their turns. It made me cry a little
---
Yes it's "nice" for heavy gunners but I have to disagree, 3* standard armor out performs power armor to a laughable degree, especially looking at Unyielding, and any with weight reduction of Cav/Sent.   
---
     
---
The major advantage is the Rad perk exclusive to the PA and Hazmat..
---
i gonna add you buddy! im 23 years old btw
---
Wait, they made up the mystery thing or something?
---
Bloodied builds spec defensively, and we have the 20% wall.
---
At this point, we're stacking serendipity/emergency protocols, nerd rage, dodgy, radicool, {non-PA - evasive, ironclad, barbarian}, and hit a point where we basically are almost impossible to kill with the highest damage in the game.
---
Look, this is what I mean. I did this run with a level 40 weapon and 20 perk points unspent. I was a bit pissed at the time, so efficiency could have been increased, but I think I did OK. Note the number of bullets and stimpacks used.
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ip8C5pnmT44&amp;t=56s
---
Now a TSE user in there is going to do a good bit less damage (more bullets) and be quite a bit more fragile.
---
Just my preferred style, I guess.
---
Thank you that helps a lot! How much health did you have and do you have the lifegiver perk (I think it is) the one that increases your health on?
---
Also if you could tell me what your current handmade does anyway that would help out as well
---
Since when does wood have more then 3\*? I have only ever heard or seen of it having one star.
---
Just wondering, is this an atom shop item or do I need to complete an event for this?
---
I was happy that someone bought about a dozen of those Mr Fuzzy stuffed animals for like 15 caps each earlier today. I found a whole pile of them somewhere and took a gamble filling half a machine with them, but they sold within 3 days. I think I might dedicate a machine just to this stuff.
---
I also sell a lot of the new alcohols. I think I have the beers all at 5 or 6 caps each (except rad ant which is 15) and the mixed drinks and nukashine at 15-30 each depending how much crap I have to gather to brew them. I tend to buy them from other people's machines too if they're priced right, especially when I'm low on ballistic bock or high voltage hefe and don't want to waste time making more at that moment.
---
It's part of the Pioneer Scouts quest lines.
---
Of course i did.
---
Been there since beta
---
I thought thats how it worked but I appreciate that confirmation,  it seemed like I was moving faster but wondered if it was in my head.
---
Ok I'll let u know if it mutates in my stash
---
Then it’s an oversight. Bad either way.
---
Not such great luck for me.  Guess I'm one of those that have to take the hit for others to get great weapons. :)
---

---
Yeah you have 20% health. Try it at 50%
---
Damn....wish I would have scrapped mine before logging out to at least get the scrip value. Thanks for the heads up.
---
I edited the link. Did it add the 3rd image? As for lifegiver i don't run it, never thought of it though.
---
I admit it, I peed a little.
---
PM me what you need :)
---
Also I just relogged in and checked, the scrip machine is offering me 15 for it so it is not an invisible primary. It is 2\* now.
---
Out of seven 2 and 3 Star Weapons, 5 were crap, otherwise:
---
-TSE Lever Gun
---
-Anti-armor Death Tambo w/ SS
---
there's tons of reports dating back to release and even video proof. if this sub was more receptive of them, instead of burying these reports in downvotes and calling them gaslighters, maybe Bethesda would have done something about it already.
---
but most people do exactly what you just did, "never happened to me, so F it". I sincerely hope people like you end up losing something of value because maybe them Bethesda will get to fixing what I'm assuming is a simple integrity check.
---
Change my mind then.
---
I only sell rare ones, but if I'm in a camp vendor that does sell a lot of plans I drop all my other known ones for them to put in their machine or for whoever else to scoop up.
---
A troubleshooter's explosive should do the trick.😎
---
Having the same issue, verified game files, uninstalled every mod, notrhing helps.   
---
I thought i was too dumb to see the machines the whole last week but now i notice it's just buggy
---
Gregor used his mouth. Maybe the same logic?
---
I got a bloody vats hit chance resist while reloading plasma pistol
---
Just a guy nearly getting his dream weapon, holla at me
---
So, how does AA and incisor/tank killer actually stack? I've seen differing answers on this, unfortunately.
---
Is the mystery pick limited daily or did Bethesda just remove it from the game because they realized that most ppl would just buy that based on value?
---
I keep learning about new combos I want to try out, lvl 191 right now.
---
&gt; When I'm getting wrecked day one by level 100+ players makes no sense in a new mode labeled survival.
---
my point is that will always be an issue. not even accounting for player time on players who started at the same time, also a matter of who starts playing first. my point is, if they went with your model, people who start playing this game in a couple of months after this rolled out (or even existing players who were slow to starting their new survival character) would be facing the exact same problem you just mentioned, getting raped by level 100+ players.
---
personally i am unsure how much i should ask
---
Tl;dr: No they do not work on energy damage.
---
Anti-armor legendary effects and perks such as stabilised use a perk applied to the player that uses an entry point function 'Mod target damage resistance'.
---
If you look through the game files energy weapons are listed as doing 0 regular damage but having an on-hit effect to deal spell damage of the dtenergy subtype. Similarly armor in the game has regular armor values then seperately handled extra spell resistance for energy types. There is a function the game uses to calculate damage reduction based on resistance you may have seen here or on the wiki - there are different constants in the game settings for different damage types like regular damage, energy damage, poison etc. This is a hangover from the game engine's history in sword and sorcery RPGs. The UI makes them look like they are handled similarly but they aren't exactly.
---
Spell damage (of which energy and rad damage are types) have their resistances handled seperately to regular damage.
---
The perk entry point function modifies target damage resistance. It would need to modify target spell resistance - there is no such entry point function framework (yet).
---
This might get fixed in a patch as it is often raised here - like the lever action rifle reload. I think the principle reason is that there are more important things for devs to focus on and making an entry point function framework probably isn't a simple task.
---
I'm not sure what the answer is to be honest. But Bethesda, if they want the game to grow with new players, definitely need some fresh ideas to keep everyone engaged and relatively happy..old and newbies alike.
---
you make it sound more simple than it actually is. a developer can't not listen to the majority of their playerbase just because they can't whip out a real, enjoyable end game.
---
like I said we're not always in sync personally either, namely pvp nerfs, but it is what it is. the success of the purveyor (or its very own existence, really) shows that the playerbase wants better rng rates.
---
Just spent all 1000 script, got garbage as I expected. 
---
Congrats on your nice weapon :)

  Here it is. All 3 weapons and you can see my hp . Hope it helps !
---
If you’ve been to every location and only have 16/17, I’ve heard that you need to drop a nuke anywhere but on the prime fissure to get the last holotape
---
It’s always been there for workshops, but not camps. Which has always been annoying
---
It is a lot points wise but it would make that 20% you have a bit larger. Thanks for the pics but as I say if you go to 50% health you will probably find the lever on par or you may not, which is what j really want to know as some guns are worse or better than others. 
---
A pistol of each variant has a lower initial damage so it more or less stays level with a tse until you get to 20% health
---
yeah no prob
---
They're getting smarter.
---
It doesn't work.
---
This is like the same misinformation that showed up at launch, woh.
---
While I think the lack of respecc criticism is valid, the rest of this seems to be all over the place and sounds like a launch-day review of the game for clicks.
---
Perk Cards aren't random, as people have said. Every level you get to pick the perk as well as, on your first 50 levels, open up a free *extra* 4 perks. This is literally identical to previous fallouts, but with the addition of *giving you the extra four perks*.
---
Dude....
---
Guess so. I never saw anything that said anything about q mystery item, just people talking about it.
---
Since Bethesda didn't remove it from the Legendary Purveyor's pool of items, probably.
---
ok, i'm sure we'll meet up eventually. i'm on for an hour or so right now. if i don't catch you on we can try at the weekend?
---
last WS quick nuke run I did I got some 3 bloodied weapons, my build doesn't use bloodied though
---
Have you ever seen a megastore in any fallout game?
---
I dislike vast majority of TS weapons, and with few quirky exceptions its not worth it. Personally, I'd go for mutants explosive combat, especially as combat seems to be generally better weapon than assault rifle is.
---
I full heartily agree
---
BoS combat and Marine are almost the same.
---
My alt didn’t have the station yet. Fortunately, someone had a camp there for me to FT to. I think I bought a few things as a thank you.
---
Perfect be on shortly
---
Where do you live that customers don't have any rights or say in the products they consume? China?
---
Do you not know what the FTC is? I'm glad you got to whip out one of your high school psychology terms, but you're honestly a fucking idiot if you don't think consumers have rights. 
---
In the EU they have even more protections than the United States, and if you wanna talk corporate greed, their laws are the only thing protecting us from more SANTA/X-MAS bundles that somehow debut both on sale and horribly overpriced.
---
I’m in love with my quad ammo/25% faster fire crossbow despite the slow reload.
---
We are getting that legendary system soon. So maybe thatll be our respec.
---
If you are in xbox I can show you mine but indont post it here.
---
Cop A Squatter
---
Yeah it is pretty much neverending. And eventually you start to tweak special stats and it starts all over.
---
I jist wish we could have a copy of every rank of every card. As is the 5 star cards are impossible to get at every rank
---
wood being bugged into 1-star might indicate it's not supposed to exist as 3-stars at all, typical Bugthesda \^_\^
---
How much does it sell for? I’m poor as hell but if I can afford it then that be great
---
I want the fallout 4 junk walls.
---
Honestly me neither. It's a serious roll for those few of us (it's probably not few :P) who play bloodied tanks.
---
Are there items you need for your main build maybe? Or an imagined one? Unyielding, Bolstering, Vanguard, Assassin, Sentinel, Cavalier....well, you get me.
---
I have some nice pieces, if you don't need this item, maybe I can help complete your sets :)
---
I would not DARE offer caps for an item like this. And you should not accept them!
---
I literally only have mine for screws to build radium rifles to break down to get its mods.
---
If survival player has pacifist on, they can't attack, can't be attacked, and their camp is invincible as long as it doesn't attack you. As with all mechanisms that make anybody periodically invincible, this should be removed, as it tends to bug out and have invincible turrets attack you.
---
Adding shrouded to the 3* wood also reverts it back to 1*. Shock experience, there goes that nice piece. Unyielding reduced weight
---
It does, thank you. 
---
Yeah so your levers are quite close at 50% will take a look at your handmade vs mine and post here so people quit with the down votes lol
---
might be distracted by everything. Pioneer scouts included. Which is taking more time than any other update.
---
I prefer this to fallout 4s. It's not random, perks are level gated, perk card packs are random as has been stated before. I'll agree with you in regards to the respec issue though. Having to grind even more levels to switch specials ect is such a pain. Really no reason it should be that way.
---
Dewd...even without specialized builds you can get north of 390 carry weight without the backpack with it over 500 modded out. It just takes a 15 Str and deep pockets on all armor pieces.
---
Just want to say thank you for all the advise and the one that worked was updating my mods ... what a difference, I actually know where I'm going
---
Yeah i spent all 800 of my scrip and got nothing good. but there was this  guy with a mic he had a head cold and was swearing under his breath anytime he bought something then he went to the legendary machine and would go right back to the purveyor  after a few trips around he started swearing out loud and left so at least I got a show
---
What does sbq does it mean scorched beast queen
---
I did Archer, mammologist, and hunter. Was easy peasy solo. 
---
Hunter killing Yao Guai with a syringer just used bleedout barrel on the alpha silo bear.
---
AA combat shotgun, AA +1p explosive black powder pistol, AA 25%ff +1p grenade launcher, nocturnal explosive +1p Gatling
---
And reverts faster from 3* to 1* if you mod shrouded
---
buy low, sell high!
---
i also sell the mr fuzzies, do you happen to remember where you found multiple of them in once place?
---
Am I the only one that likes Vanguard with +25 radiation, and +1 strength for PVE?? I have so many stinpacks (905) that I'm always full health. So I'm currently walking around with 455 dr/er and 125 RR
---
Yeah, he's talking about a different door mate
---
Where is she?
---
They snap to the mesh part of the vending machines easy and clean.
---
Nice!  I was pleasantly surprised with the stuff I got today.  Nothing I can use personally, but some good stuff to trade on the forums.
---
Definitely not
---
The lighthouse near vault 76 has little lighthouse souvenirs you get them on the bottom floor inside try selling those
---
Can confirm this happened to me. How do we go about reporting this to Bethesda?
---
PA has insane damage reduction, much higher than the stated amount on a pipboy.  Running bloody in and out of PA is night and day.  Yes I understand sentinel is a strong effect but I’d put my survivability in PA with Nerd Rage and Emergency Protocol over non PA Sentinel/serendipity/Nerd  rage any day of the week.  And your not vating in PA so there’s no damage benefit for legendary armor when it comes to heavy guns.
---
Challenge timer most likely.
---
My new build, mix tape Venice beach guy!
---
Dodged a bullet lol. The vendors might be taxing servers.
---
Contrary to the name two shot weapons only do 125% base damage. Ish.
---
The truth is a bit more complicated. Basically there's two projectiles that each do 1/2 of 125% base damage and one of those shots may miss (and often do). So that means every so often you don't do 125% damage - you only do 62.5% damage. So if your base damage on that crossbow is say 50 you will generally do 63 damage. But sometimes it's only 32.
---
my favorite is my chainsaw with flamer mod, super fun and looks so good. could do more damage, but well
---
I never said anything about not being able to kill them. I’m not trying to sit there and wait for them to land while the scream spam and F up my armor... and I’m not trying to waste bullets trying to shoot them out of the air. 50 Cal and the Flamer don’t have any type of sights to aim with
---
I recommend every console games invest in a clipboard or lap desk of some kind for just this sort of issue (well, this and those inconvenient times you find yourself needing to pay the occasional bill or sign a form you can't online due to adult life demanding attention during your game time =).
---
I always thought the covered bridge by the overseer’s camp would be a neat walk through shop for low level stuff. I never see anyone claim that area though.
---
Heavy metal is what your looking for. Marine is great for all around resistance. Heavy leather rivals Heavy Brotherhood Combat armor. Heavy leather out weighs combat extensively in the energy Department but falling a bit short in the ballistic area. 
---

Whitesprings for now
---
M E T A
---
The issue would be the same. The number of items in storage would still be higher than the system can cope with if you could make everything weight half as much you would put twice as much in and if that worked they would have just doubled the storage in the first place.
---
Until bethsida works out databases we are kinda stuck with it as it is :(
---
I did ok with 10 turn-ins.  3 were garbage, most had something to like like explosive or something.  The gem was a Two-Shot FFR +agil Assault rifle.  The other 3 or 4 were solid "B" tier weapons.
---
I would kinda expect them to be since the military is wide spread in the U.S. It's also a staple of every military which would make them extremely common.
---
good call, and sure enough,they are currently for sale at my shop!  they are great examples of the weird and wonderful items i was talking about
---
i hope you also have success selling them!
---
And when you’d pull that gun, it would remain as a skin, on your back? That would look silly in my opinion. It should not be added as a skin but rather as an animation.
---
You can technically do this, but probably not how you imagine.
---
Exactly.
---
i am in the market for a Vampire's Gatling laser/plasma with a good roll, a Quad +50% limb damage (or explosive, if at all possible) Cryolator, Quad Explosive LMG, a decent missile launcher roll (maybe Instigating or Anti Armor with +10% ADS damage)
---
i do not use legendary armor due to being a PVE power armor build
---
The person who sold it to you gave it an upgrade that would mistakenly give the weapon an extra star. Happens with machetes and snipers often.
---
Sometimes people like to use it as a starting point to farm whitesprings (me sometimes) I understand what your saying but maybe we could have a second fast travel location
---
First star: Unyielding is essential if you're going for a Bloodied build, but otherwise I think Bolstering and Vanguard's are the most popular all-around effects. Stealth builds like Chameleon (or Weightless if they're using the Chameleon mutation instead)
---
Second star: Bonus AP refresh is universally good. The radiation and poison resist ones are decent for PvE, although you shouldn't need more than one poison resist piece. The best SPECIAL bonuses depend on your build but everyone likes more STR.
---
Third star: Stealth builds like the stealth improvement. Everyone likes the weight reduction effects. If you get two of the fall damage reduction effects you're immune to fall damage, which is fun. Don't know how much people value Sentinel's or Cavalier's after the nerf, but they used to be coveted.
---
You have a point there.
---
Scout Armor has over 100 resistance. Combat caps at 86 I believe. Now that Scout has legendary effects, it's by far the best. Edit: If I remember correctly scout goes up to like 140.
---
You will get stuff at there level.
---
When he told me this the first time, I laughed (cause it was true) 
---
When he told me this the second time, I shook my head in disappointment (it wasn’t true) 
---
Come on, Bethesda. Cmon.
---
Dude I had no idea 😂 I fired that gun one single time, shot 450 laser cells and scrapped it instantly... never touched it again
---
I've been told 20 hours after you use it or something like that.
---
Shitty barbeque
---
I don't think it's so much an issue with management as it is with time.  The game has been hemorrhaging players since the first week or so.  I think they're trying to staunch the bleeding, and triage is letting bugs through.
---
I've been waiting a full week to get back on fallout! I cant wait to see what I get...
---
And I swear if I get a rolling pin I am uninstalling
---
Man U killed three of them that is a lot
---
Whitespring resort shops has a good one
---
Wow you’re not getting it.
---
I've got my baby and won't ever move ..love being at ws station
---
In my opinion this mod won’t prevent any aid from spoiling. I’m pretty sure it should just increase the time it takes to spoil. The real question would be: How long until it’s spoiled when you wear a backpack equipped with such a mod? Compared to how long it takes without such modded backpack.
---
Look in floors?
---
That's not even the name of the song.
---
No once you do them on one character you can’t do them ever again
---
I've only seen one legendary other than the SBQ. What am I doing wrong?
---
White springs has a vendor that sales recipes and food.
---
Do u mean the enclave one or the one where there are like 20 vendors
---
...because every pick is a Mystery Pick!  Woohooo!
---
I think my suggestion would be even worse than increasing stash size in terms of server stability. Increasing makes it fixed in terms of what a server has to handle, but with perk cards you could suddenly have people tripling the amount of stuff they have.
---
I still want to dream though!
---
This game is all about grind. There's not much else to do in the end game than grinding legendaries. The fact that we can get a guaranteed 3* already surprised me a lot. But not only can we choose the stars but it also scales with our lvl and we can even choose whether it's ranged, melee or armor. That's insane. Because until now there are not many locations where a guaranteed 3* enemy spawns and even if it does, it may be dropping a lvl 40 1* wood armor. So if we could choose even more then it wouldn't take much time until everyone had the stuff they want. And why would Bethesda want that? They want you to keep playing, keep grinding because that's what the game is about. Obviously they're not gonna make it too easy.
---
It’s a floor variant. Click left or right when placing a floor to cycle thru variants.
---
I would like that! It could be called Star signs!
---
In the shops with like 20 vendors. He’s the protectron in the pink kitchen shop. The mr. Handy there sells ingredients and is a dick.
---
Unfortunately not
---
That kinda sucks though.  It's like playing scratch-offs in lotto.  I guess the good news is that the stuff you originally scrip-scrapped was stuff that would pretty much get thrown out anyway.
---
I plan on selling plans, and recipes at my camp once I have internet access full time again, but as for NPCs, whitesptings, and there is even an npc that sells ingredients there as well.
---
Jesus, I'm a dumbass.   
---
I thought it would be under floor decor, cuz it's a shag carpet.. lol. Was thinking rug/carpet same thing.  
---
Thanks man, I feel stupid.
---
I've seen a camp/shop at that bridge atleast a couple times a day (on Xbox) this week. It's picking up popularity.
---
I think I heard it gives your aid 60% slower rot rate and doesn’t stack with the “good with salt perk”. Unsure though I haven’t got it yet, close though.
---
People just want easier options. just like the X-01. I prefer the rarity of being able to expand Enclave items slowly. It gave those items character :/
---
I was hoping they’d fix the tadpole quests but no such luck
---
Thanks a lot I’m trying to do the cook badge for the pioneer scout
---
In my experience this tends to be the issue in most things related to large businesses, all too often due mostly to a lack of understanding or communication (usually due to lack of awareness or just trying to avoid accountability).  Can't say for certain, but it would be the place I would start looking to address the problem.
---
Luckily for OP, Crow gives 35 HP and only 2 RADS, so he'll be able to eat it and feel better.
---
If you could have a second character that could redo the challenges, trust that that second character would also start with nothing unlocked from atom purchases as well
---
Okay I'll try that thanks👍
---
I got a 3 star rolling pin
---
I took like 12 photos of wolves from different angles all with the term wolf in the grey box before it finally registered and gave me the mammalian badge. If anyone else has been in the same boat as me, clear out your photo gallery and just keep trying.

---
Came here to say this. I want that barrel drum for my camp man. Maybe they are saving it for some sort of music expansion or event.
---
Select a floor to build. Press left or right on directional pad and it should change.  You should be able to go into build mode click on a current floor piece and hit Y to change it. Use the same thing left/right on directional pad.
---
I was playing GW2 and opened my inventory to drink a beer before event ended for weekly but it was the wrong game. help

Oh no are u on xb1?
---
Ok that would be annoying for sure!
---
I'd understood if there was "ladder to climb" like you have in normal working online game- You get piece of gear, you get stronger, you now get to do harder content what means more better gear, but that is not the case in F76. What means everything between max crafted and near best in slot gear isn't viable. 
---
Lets say you do SBQ in crafted gear and earn TS weapon. You just got weapon that gives you 25% more damage. In other game, this would mean that you got better gear, now you can take on stronger monster that have better chances to drop better gear. So thanks to getting better gear you improved your chances to get even better gear. That creates this ladder- bad gear, mediocre gear, good gear and best gear. And this ladder gives mediocre gear and point. Pretty foolproof design.
---
In Fallout 76 you don't have this ladder, so getting mediocre weapon like TS is pointless, because getting TS isn't step closer getting TSE. You are already doing content, that drops TSE, in crafted gear, there is no need of TS for you. This mean, getting only 50% paid for 100% content isn't going to help you, like it would in normal online game.
---
All weapons prime  anti armor explosive but they are shotguns , and handmades I’m still trying to my part though.... love that flux man!
---
Im pretty sure he got it from the legendary vendor and stashed it just for it to ditch the main effect.

I have a vampire explosive Gatling gun. I think that's about perfect. I still get a decent amount of heals (like enough that, during the queen/boss fights, I never touch stims and only use radaways for the rad damage unless there's high level yogis or mirelurk queens), and I think that's about perfect. It's easier to hit more of your shots, and the ammo expenditure isn't nearly as high as a minigun. I imagine a similar minigun would absolutely destroy it when she lands, though.
---
Honestly if you want shit 1* maybe 2* legendaries.
---
Otherwise the best farming method I found is Burrows (decent chance of getting 1 or 2 3* ghoul per run) , or events (Awol, Uranium fever, horde events) 
---
West Tek Is also good, but is really long 20-30 min run because so many mutanta.
---
I sever hop burrows- 10 min run, then include any event. If no event, then just keep server hop burrows. 
---
Best method for me
---
I really hope the event has an on-screen alert like Encryptid.  I find myself just catching the end of Campfire Tales or Free Range more often than not, and feel bad when I kill the Sheepsquatch(es) only to see someone running up the path hoping to get in on the action.
---
I'd like to see the specifics about how stealth mechanics work.  How much benefit do shadowed/muffled/ultra light armor mods provide, how much does armor weight play a role, how much benefit does the third star "harder to detect while sneaking" actually provide, and how the Agility score works with stealth.  
---
There are 0 numbers to look at in game, just vague wording and a \[   hidden   \] bar to give you some idea of how successful you're being.  Sometimes I can be shooting super mutants in the middle of the road on a sunny afternoon and never get out of \[   caution   \], and the next minute I'm immediately in \[danger\] after killing one mutant inside the dark hallways of West-Tek.  It seems completely arbitrary at times, or maybe that toxic sludge gives the mutants a massive buff to their perception stat.
---
&gt; decent missile launcher roll (maybe Instigating or Anti Armor with +10% ADS damage
---
Nooooooooooo.....I trashed a 3* yesterday with AA ADS and 90% weight reduction :(
---
Might have some of the others though, I'll PM with anything interesting.
---
Again....please don't give that HM away too cheap. It's a serious beaut. Nice luck :)
---
No prob Bob! Glad to help! I’m a lowly tadpole. Do you think I can get a helpfulness badge for this?
---
Yes please. I loved building this kind of stuff in FO4 (terrible at it tho). One of my favorite mods to use was a [blueprint for Sanctuary](https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/23137). Coupled with the ReGrowth mod. Mmmmm. So good.
---
OH. Had no clue the legendary vendor came out. Where is it?
---
You get a legendary add when she mutates.
---
I'd actually love if you could get some real terrariums in game. Different ones for frogs, mirelurk spawn, maybe some mutated fish
---
Perhaps you never did, that daily has a habit of completing itself before you get to it!
---
I'm not on atm, but does nuke range reach purveyor and burrows??
---
Berkely Springs Train Station
---
Oh gosh, stats?
---
If I wanted to go outside, I'd go to the station or the service entrance, ya know?  Or the golf club if I don't mind getting mugged by a yard yogi.
---
What an asshat!
---
It’s supposed to be released with Project Paradise, so.. next update.
---
Don’t remember as I scrapped it straight away but I can tell you they were awful
---
Would be pointless then, who wouldn't pick heavy armor as its better??
---
Nvm: thought u ment armor
---
Pretty sure in fallout 3 the only non humanoid that could open doors was the deathclaw. Somehow it made them even more terrifying.

Haha, r/woooooosh, you UNCULTURED swine who DOES not GET JOKES. This JOKE is the MOST SUPREME of ALL JOKES, BUT you're a foreskin eater who ONLY LAUGHS when the toaster GOES OFF. Do you have FUN ROASTING your foreskin? I FEEL so GREAT for destroying you for not getting a JOKE. Have FUN with your -30000 karma, DUMMY. I am SUPERIOR in EVERY WAY and you are an INFERIOR, SQUARE HEADED Neanderthal and is the REASON there are instructions on toothpaste.
---
3* Assaultron head = 40 scrip I can't stand these.... I mean seriously....does anyone use them
---
Wait, .50 ammo is more cost efficient than 5mm? I thought it was the other way around. I know you get more 5mm with ammosmith, but it's been a bit since I've needed .50 ammo so I don't remember if it costs a good bit less per craft.
---
WhiteSprings, Grand Gourmet. 
---
Get your plans and insults from the robo chick behind the counter too.
---
What on earth corporate greed are we talking about in relation to a missing option in a vendor that they never said anything about being I. The final product?
---
You're letting your rage blind you. How many hours do you have into this game? Have the fairly minuscule bugs bothered you so much that you havnt played the game but are still bitching about a tiny detail added at no extra cost to you?
---
I'm hearing everything is max level
---
You made your choice.
---
As a gunslinger. This is my dream.
---
So what your saying is buy weapons till this is fixed
---
I didn’t make any choice
---
I heard it's only in the data mine cause of Fallout 4 legendary PA. Otherwise no actual proof yet that they will do it
---
Inside the vault is one of my favorite things about any game I've ever played. 
---
Legit i just want it to be longer. What's ahead teases. Behind the scene. Resonses to community feedback. All that shit. Been very happy with the direction its been goin and gives me great confidence in the games future
---
I wish someone out there would save us.
---
Not exactly the 25% is already in your damage shown. So 91 damage.
---
I do. I don’t play bloodied and am more comfortable being full health. With pharma finder and sun kissed I can usually keep myself topped up. That said I’ve only got one star vanguards to date but I’m hoping the Purveyor can help me after work.
---
Is that so?
---
I saw another thread not long ago saying that the brewed booze wasnt "aging" when the backpack was in use. 
---
Based on that, I would hope the flux is impacted the same way.
---
I use a two shot to ground sb and the vampiric to rip into them sadly they would break instantly due to durability and the fire rate. I had a really nice  3 🌟 scorched Gatling gun but I lost it during the time shit would just randomly disappear from your inventory. Now that they changed the way big guns work I stopped using them just got to used to being melee plus I just get tired of dealing with ammo.
---
The consecutive hit gatling gun is god tier, so is vampire. I would use the furious gatling gun tho unless you intend to use nerd rage and adrenal reaction; then I would use vampires to stay alive.
---
Her health pool stays the same, I've used a mod to track it in the past (25k if I remember). Her DR does scale to the # of people at the fight.
---
Very very easy to test. Get a small group of 3-4 and go kill the SBQ. Now have another 10-15 people show up and just stand around and do nothing for the next fight. Your TTK is going to go way way up.
---
The perk in perception never shows her resists going above 300, but you can definitely tell.
---
What choice did *I make*?
---
Well not meanin add in an animation of pulling the weapon.. it doesnt have to be functional.. just the look.
---
Yea its confirmed this is happening with wood armor as well
---
That is different that what other people are saying - https://old.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/bphmhm/do_legendary_purchases_scale_with_the_level_of/
---
Is your CAMP budget maxed? Stuff in the machines seems to take a very tiny amount of stash space per item, so if your budget is maxed you won't be able to put stuff in there.
---
Listen to your heart, my friend. There you will find your choice.
---
I do events alot, so I always have so many stinpacks, then use chemist perk with super duper and BAM 25 stinpacks become 100+ (about 30 extra from super duper) so 130 stinpacks
---
No you see how you look lol
---
No? Card packs give you cards to equip. You can choose from all cards, gated by level, at all times.
---
Eh, sometimes you just need to check the map and see if there are high level players near your current position. Yes I know fast travel makes the whole point moot, but you can  generally be sure if there's no level 150 guy poking around Flatwoods, your level 20 character shouldn't have to deal with level 68 scorched ghouls. The further out you go the more likely it is it'll become harder to avoid higher players.  As far as low level servers go, maybe lock the forest for level 25, no one gets out until lev25, and no one gets in after lev25.
---
I've been commenting the same thing on every post about this, but I think they should allow us to track the Pioneer Scout challenges like a quest so you don't even have to open your map to see what you have to do next.
---
Make sure to report people like this as it's griefing
---
Damn how are you getting your hunting rifle to have that high of damage?  I’m impressed!
---

The medicine vendor is in the medical wing, sells all the medicine recipes available in the game.
---
those are all i use
---
Drop the chameleon but and I experience similar often, either that or they literally walk into me and neither one of us was aware of the other until they did.  With a high enough perception we should be able to at least detect enemies as well as they can us via non-visual senses.
---
Nobody cares why you cheated, just like when you posted yesterday and no one responded.
---
If your base is nearby, you can drop artillery grenades in the legendary purveyor hut. Might take a minute, but the splash damage through the roof should be enough to take out your AFK friend, even if they’re inside, on an adventure server and if you’re in pacifist mode.
---
This is why they should have never taken away the ability to pvp from adventure mode.
---
The title says "legacy explosive weapons, I hope Bethesda deletes them."
---
The first line of the post says "delete all explosive energy weapons"
---
I don't expect Bethesda to do this. But if Johnny numbnuts here was in charge, I'd have something to worry about.
---
Come to my camp. You'll see how they spawn. I'm nowhere near Prime, but I am between a marked fissure site and an unmarked one. I cannot go a gaming session without at least one hitting my camp, sometimes multiple.
---
I did have one situation where three players were at my camp, I ported back, and within seconds I had about 20 scorched and two 80 SBs spawn inside my camp fence. They all helped :)
---
First how do you turn on pacafist? Second the leader boards on survival go by xp I thought now, so people can be avoid being part of pvp and just mining xp. Wouldn't pacafist go against that idea in survival?
---
Well damn, crap in my corn flakes why dont you🤣 Thought it was a decent one but didnt know about the AA energy bit, good to know though, thanks! And with that who wants to buy a badass 3* AA limb dmg +agilty Telsa? 🤣🤣
---
Can't get a drill from the vendor.

Automod remived it because it’s a new account. Thanks for reading and responding.
---
There is a note in fort defiance on the 4th floor with the terminal password that you need to pick up to trigger that part of the quest.
---
I fully agree, yesterday I was fighting the queen chewed through a lot of 5.56 ammo, broke my TSE, went on to my mini gun chewed through quite a bit of ammo on that one then the damn server froze before the queen died so I got nothing for my effort, even if you get the chance to rejoin the server when the game freezes all you can do is log out and then you get put back into another world. If they could let you rejoin the same server after logging out that would work.
---
It should be 40 scrip yes. But if you get 1 and are already capped on scrip for the day and log it will be 2\* when you relog in and now worth only 15 scrip.
---
Somebody nuked whitesprings on my server two days ago and saw two nukes on queen yesterday. On Xbox if it helps
---
That sounds like the perfect opportunity to server hop.  
---
A: Scorchbeast camp attacks suck.  They can destroy your house quicker than a bloody gauntlet guy.
---
B: Mr. Rando coming back from AFK while dead in the middle of the woods with three scorchbeasts flying around his loot bag would be unexpected.
---
The reason this happens is because wood armor only has 1 legendary attach slot. Just something to pass on to the devs if you want
---
there is a note in fort defiance on the 4th floor with the terminal password that you need to pick up to trigger that part of the quest.
---
Yeah agreed it’ll make AID items to last a lot longer but I don’t think it makes anything non-spoilable (if that’s a word lmao)
---
Never saw a Super Duper Mart til 3 or a Slocum's Joe til 4 but they have been in every game since. 
---
Do you actually believe in a world with worse consumerism issues than out own that megastores wouldn't exist?
---
I agree on the legendary drop proposal but honestly I’d be happy if they'd fix the queen fight first as the disconnects and black screen of infinite loading is disheartening to say the least.
---
Keep your eyes peeled for the impostor squatch event. You can pretty much guarantee that someone will drop in that pool of water, you just have to be quick enough to revive them before someone else.
---
Problem with it being furious is you usually 1 shot normal enemies with  2 handlers but it will awesome for sheep squat and queen
---
I agree with this. I think if we track it it shud show on the pop boy.... Only the ones we track tho
---
I literally do not know what YouTube video you’re taking about. I don’t get my information from YouTube. I said “tons.” 65 is a ton for what we’re talking about. If you disagree that’s fine, but you’re arguing semantics in that case, which I already pointed out. Your reading comprehension is nonexistent.
---
By level 24 you've probably figured it out but I'll mention it anyway.  If you arrive at a location and you suspect the enemies have spawned at a level beyond you, just server hop.  Good chance the game will put you on a server where the enemies can spawn to you.  If not, well, happy hunting!  Enjoy the big XP and faster level ups!
---
Sometimes a higher level player won't mind helping out, softening up those big guys for you to finish them off.  Just turn on your mic and ask.  Worst case they don't help and you haven't lost anything.  Only time I walk away from lower level players in need is if they just sprint around whacking things without a plan and no interest in learning.
---
Even if the player is a level 5
---
Has anyone confirmed this
---
The archery one was pretty painless. Tip if you attempt it: bashing with the crossbow counts as a kill, and helps wear down the weapon faster than firing it.
---
Not in this case. Looking at the wood armor it only has 1 legendary attach slot. This is something they would have noticed if they just took a second to make sure. Plus this has been something that's been reported since launch and been ignored entirely. Same thing with the drill and syringer dropping from legendary loot pools
---
YES! That would be awesome
---
🤡🤡🤡
---
It's definitely much lower than before, which makes sense. I'll see a nuke every few hours now, and maybe a single Encryptid event a day.
---
I have seen them everyday, but roughly around 9pm or later central time. Weekdays they are pretty much nonexistent before than because of people working or at school.
---
Hmm I saw two dropped back to back in this morning and then I dropped one myself.  I don’t see them being dropped in the early evening.
---
never underestimate the stupidity of people in large groups?
---
Caps lol
---
I love my evil robot Jenny Slate
---
Yup. I’ll still have my instigating for the one-shots, but I’ll switch to furious for the longer fights.
---
Come on be real.. if you was to buy land and build a house say with a few friends and had some skill in it and had the tools and machinery then you could do a decent job.. anyone would not allow clutter and rubble in their house. I made several fallout 4 mods removing rubble and trash in businesses/vendors/quest places because it makes sense the owner would clean it up and repair the place. Dunno what crappy place you want but not me.
---
Yup just got lvl 50 gear on my lvl 2 mule and my buddy was getting lvl 1 stuff on his... so that didn’t help at all I’m sure.
---
This is great and all.. But not everyone has a printer. I guess if it were an editable file I cud do it via my phone. But alas
---
This lol, I would ask people If  they were raised in a barn but I know they were raised in vault 76 so I'm not sure what the problem is
---
I sold a bunch the other day that were in my stash.... needed the space and I find more than I use :)
---
Thank you. I knew I'd seen inside fast travel points in a Fallout game before but couldn't recall where. There and the Railroad headquarters.
---
No, I'm just going to try scrapping the machines and start fresh.
---
Tbh if I had that one, or a bloodied one. I think I'd use it a lot. Something strangely satisfying about them
---
I appreciate your perspective and willing to share. But, are you able to speak on behalf of the 'many of us dupers' because you all meet up and talk about how you dupe to circumvent grinding and certainly not sell the items? How many is 'many of us dupers'? 100? 10,000? Unless you've seen or heard from the majority of dupers that exist, as if you could know every one of them that's out there, it's pretty naive to make a statement like that, isn't it?
---
Wow you have no idea how the world works do you? even if we where in the 1700's and you built a house with friends it would be better. besides there is tons of pre-war stuff that could be cleaned up and fixed.. get real.
---
I suspect you were to get the drill 76% of the time
---
I understand. Thing is, the game is what it is. It's *survival* - which means that you have to gather resources to keep going. 
---
Want to build a shack? Go into the forest and collect wood.
---
Want to get rid of a disease or stock up on meds? Hit a hospital.
---
You know how it is, of course. You may find it boring, but that's the essence of Fallout 76. You are no longer the god you were in previous Fallouts, where beyond certain point you just had too much of everything and melted your enemies just by looking in their general direction. This is not that game.
---
So, in my opinion, what you're doing isn't removing the grind; you are removing an essential part of the game in order to do what you want. 
---
With that said - if you do it only for yourself, without affecting other players or the economy, I don't really care. It's your account, do what you want with it. You already know the consequences if you get caught.
---
this is an entirely different problem. they do have 5 legendary attach slots
---

Wooohoooo that sure is a pretty gun ya got there, friend. 👀
---
If I'm not level 50 yet, should I hold off on getting things? I'm close, I think 48? COuld I do a roll and get level 50 items that I can hold onto til I can use them?
---
I'm just impatient and wanna check it out, haha.
---
I got a Bloodied FFR Cryolator, AAE Black Powder rifle plus 3 other explosive guns and a few 50% crit dmg guns too. I have more than 1 character though, and it took approx. 2000-2500 scrip to get these. I will be trading some of them, haven't decided which ones yet.
---
Got it! Well, that is on my to-do list anyway. Thanks!
---
Mystery pick is going to be enabled during one of the spotlights for it. spotlights are the events like increased mothman spawns and doublexp
---
Since the basis of your argument is completely invalid (as others have explained tonned of times already), kindly delete your misinformation filled post.
---
Good to know I'll scrip em when I get them
---
😂something obviously
---
It’s *Outstanding move
---
Oh shit that's a lot of springs
---
I got max level with two of my alts that were level 4 and 6
---
This looks really cool, and like others have said it would be great to see a tournament.
---
1000 script got crap 3*** weapons
---
I've actually gotten Flux from her and from the event. I lost every bit of it through my own stupidity, but that was also the only time that's ever happened. Of course.
---
Still bugged for me as well, and I made 3 of them.
---
No u
---
Oh is that what those are for?! I keep seeing them in vendor bit inventory and had no idea why they existed or cost so much.
---
Judging by the files whilst I datamine the updates there are wallpaper textures to come to the atom shop at some point
---
Aside from Abandoned Bog Town (which is a long schlep for level 20-somethings), I find a bunch of screws in the Grafton Steel Mill, usually just sitting on locker shelves.
---
I didn't even tell you how many server hops i needed to do to get the event to spawn (maybe 10 hops per spawn).  
---
The event seems drop no loot when the counselor boss wendigo is killed by over zealous players before it has even really spawned (I read that the same is true in Free Range of the Sheepsquatch).  It seems many times a whole bunch of players time their arrivals to the event right at the end so that they don't have to do any of the work, focus only on the legendary, so they get the biggest reward ... wreck it for the players who spent the time getting the event there (no one wants to take a pylon; protect the cows; or collect the wood).
---
If you want to mod the scout armor, good luck.  Like the X-01, the plans NEED to be purchasable from MODUS in a future update.  I've got a "dense" and "shadowed" scout mod sitting in my stash, because I was expecting the armor to join the legendary loot tables at some point.
---
As far as what piece of scout armor I can use the "shadowed" mod on, your guess is as good as mine.  It's kinda like looking through a vendor's mod selection and seeing a "bladed" mod.  That's it.  Just "bladed".  
---
I would buy the shit out of "bladed" mods if I could just add them to anything.  Bladed Sugar Bombs, Bladed Plasma Grenade, Bladed Imported Chinese Panda, Bladed BOS Knight Outfit, Bladed Rustic Kitchen Table.
---
Probably will still be. Solo able for min max and players
---
I love the camera prop!!!
---
I had a Bloodied, Faster Fire Rate Assaultron head from the vendor that somehow lost the bloodied part.
---
Yeah, that's basically it. All the stuff I already turned to Scrip was stuff that I had no use for &amp; likely wouldn't sell. So throwing Scrip at the Mole-Lotto is fine by me.
---
I heartily enjoy when I'm fully sneaking in a black corner, and go from fully hidden to full blown danger, from an enemy one level down just because we occupy the same coordinates I guess.
---
All versions of Fallout 76 have a save file located within the file directory.
---
Had this exact same issue. Another time it made me fetch the Keycard from the Ski resort for a second time. This quest is kinda buggy.
---
That won't be an issue.  Experiment with flechette harpoons and you'll understand why...
---
Forgive the ignorance here, but why stay off the roof? As a ranged player. I want to do anything and everything to make it easier since the last SBQ fight I was in, we lost the event.
---
Nothing at all
---
Oh i kinda live the opossum hat because it's so disgusting! It's my hobo hill Billy hat!
---
Were you doing 3 star or 2, read 2 isnt max
---
I was in a server where similar happened due to the Pioneer Camp event starting.  Can't say I blame them, I'd choose the badges over the SBQ drops too atm (I hadn't gone to the Scorched Earth event because it was getting dark and I figured the Pioneer event would start...but it was weird seeing all the people in PA arrive to slay low level bugs half way through =).
---
See I don't really feel like the Level Up challenge is actually that much of a challenge. Like, I have to wear sunglasses, or a clown suit, or my bowler hat, or have slept in a bed for 10 seconds. I'm always over Level 76 so that one's automatic. It's not really challenging or interesting, it's just makes me carry outfits around more than I want to. Good thing they only way 0.1.
---
Ask on here. Plenty of people are willing to help. 
---
You can also try to keep an eye out during the encrypted event for someone to go down in the puddles and revive them.
---
No worries, the more educated people are, the better! It seems - SEEMS - as though if someone is on a roof, or on a barricade, or on a fence, and shooting at her, she's a lot less likely to land. This is consensus among a fairly large group that I've done hundreds of SBQ runs with. Now it's not proven fact, it's somewhat anecdotal, but other people have also come to similar conclusions. That said, I've also seen her land even when people are in someplace they "shouldn't" be - but it seems MUCH MUCH rarer.
---
Had the same, bloodied faster fire rate head with crit charge lost the bloodied part.
---
Maybe extra limb damage is useful in a vats build? Haven't had a chance to research it
---
https://youtu.be/pM6wanZOLtk
---
I very rarely use power armor. Stealth + AP build. I like to move quickly regardless of whether I have speed demon. Fusion cores wear out and need to be replaced/purchased/etc. and it results in a lot more grinding than I do for non-PA armor. 
---
Of course I wear it at nuke zones, queen fights, etc. but most of my gameplay isn't in it
---
Gotta meet up with someone and complete it or randomly wait around water areas hoping for someone to be downed and revive them before they respawn.
---
It forces you to work with others for these tadpole quests.
---
Instigating harpoon gun with +10% damage while aiming and +50 damage reduction while reloading.
---
Ikr, I hate killing her only to reveal I got a one star fire axe
---
Can happen with weapons too. My Assaultron Head lost the major affix, bloodied.
---
Nobody wants to put in the effort to drop one.  It’s like the cryptid event, nobody what’s to spend the caps to buy the board, but shows up when the event starts. The players who haven’t done it are still dropping nukes for the first time. I try to drop one each week to help lower level players compete the questline.
---
What system you on?
---
Xbox - I can help
---
Ps4- post your gt and there are plenty willing to help others get these done.
---
I find you can charge pretty crazy prices for mothman wings. I've already sold 3 for 5000 caps each. Especially lucrative now he seems to be more common if you don't fast travel.
---
You can still do the tadpole challenges, yes. They remain in your challenge log so you can complete them.
---
There were nukes going off left n right during the double xp event.
---
My buddy sold not one, but two "You Have Been Insulted!" notes for 5000 caps each.  He just put them in there as a joke.
---
I have a bunch of uncommon and rare outfits, and those seem to sell very well.  I sell everything for between 50-400 caps.  They'll sit there for a while, then one person comes along and just buys everything I have.  It's happened several times.
---
My friend was going to launch his first nuke, before we entered the silo I told him not to. There were only two players on the map higher than him (78). I told him, if we did it, we would fail. He did it anyways, and wouldn't you know it. We failed. We at least got to kill her since the last half of her second bar she just hovered and let us shoot her. It just burns my biscuits. We had a good turn out, but when three of the 8 players are under level 40, you can't expect anything else.
---
Well, from this answers im kinda screwed cause i use PA and all that. I guess im going back to my AA hunting rifle. On the bright side, i did get 2 other explosive guns from the purveyor today, a minigun and a handmade so i cant really cry abiut the rifle.
---
Exactly this. If you fire a gun off in a crowd of people. Most likely everyone is going to start running like crazy and people become stupid in those situations. Pull a gun on a single person and fire it that person is probably going to not run and try to get out of the situation alive. Mob mentality sucks
---
You can still do them. Though be aware they give you tadpole badges not possum. So the back pack mods cost possum badges.
---
Since the EXP earned from Scorchbeasts doesn't balance with the resources needed to kill them (for most of us) I figure its just Bethesda's way of depleting my assets so I will get back out there and grind back to a full stash again.
---
Recently, I helped someone defend his workshop against a two Scorchbeast attack.  I thought we did pretty well.  When it was over he gave me some plans I didn't know.
---
I bet you eat Tide pods in real life too.
---
If you have a question about something, please put the question **in the title**. Reddit does not make it possible to edit titles, so you will have to post again with a LONGER, MORE DESCRIPTIVE TITLE. Once again, MAKE A TITLE WHICH IS LONGER AND MORE DESCRIPTIVE.

My vending machine, lol.
---
I fully believe in an RNG seed affecting the loot table on a server.
---
I had 800 scrip, found two things to sell, and one armor I'm pretty okay with over all. It's a crap shoot, but at least it's guaranteed as far as stars go.
---
Yeah, haven't seen a launch in over a week now. Logged on to one server earlier with a residual blast zone but aside from that, nothing.
---
Have 3 pieces of weapon weight reducing armour.. all my guns are no more than 1 pound each
---
I'm on ps4. That's unfortunate
---
Thanks for the clarification. That'll teach me to speculate.
---
Or mine, unless they’ve been bought out.
---
Bladed Sugar Bombs sounds like an inspired (and terrifying) treat to add to a Pumpkin Pail or Cauldron CAMP item to give out candy like our Punch Bowls.
---
I also desperately want to wield a Bladed Rustic Kitchen Table now.
---
From what I've been reading since that last failure, it helps to cripple her wings so she lands, and then crippling her other limbs keeps her down? I changed my build a lot since to include tenderizer, endangerol syringer, one-gun army, and concentrated fire. 
---
Last time, everyone else was on the roof of the nearby building or on the fences. We had one melee player out there. It was a disaster.
---
My bad. I didnt care enough to verify the name and is till dont. The point is that the song is I accurate.
---
The 150 per day is really, really dumb. Bethesda is essentially saying don’t play this game too much, spend your time elsewhere.
---
Ive gotten 6 sentinel pieces, and one unyielding cav chest from her just today. A lot have put up some top tier rolls from it. I think its a great solution for now to level out the economy
---
How much more damage does it do on each consecutive hit?
---
Nukes can launch anywhere but near vault 76
---
Odd how this post was downvoted a bunch before it would have been physically possible to read any of it...
---
Granted, I have speed demon, but I've gotten in the habit of beginning to run the moment I teleport into the camp. So far it's saved me from multiple situations in which I would've been stuck...
---
Sugar Grove. Tons of fans.
---
You need a TLDR
---
Also it's been 1 day not every roll is a god roll the Purveyor already significanly reduced RNG rates.
---
Fucking hell.  I just came in my pants looking at that.
---
I am sick of all this camera shit.
---
Heavy laser turrets used to do it. Now they just sit there doing nothing.
---
Its been having great rolls from what I see, I myself got 6 sentinel pieces and one unyielding cav god roll lol
---
There is nothing more West Virginian than getting confused with western Virginia.
---
John Denver was an absolute genius.
---
not really, the best ive found for distance wise so far has been heavy laser turrets.  it would be nice to get a little more range still out of them
---
I got the following from the purveyor
---
Level 50 autostim forest scout chest piece with +25% radiation resistance and 20% ammo reduction- modded to polymer and padded with 86dmg resistance and 55 energy resistance.
---
Level 50 autostim urban scout chest piece with +1 luck and underwater breathing.
---
Level 50 Bolstering Urban scout chest piece with +1 END and 50% more durability.
---
Level 50 Chameleon Forest scout right leg with +1 charisma and junk weight reduced by 20%
---
Level 50 Sentinel ghoul slayer Forest scout Left leg with -15% damage from ghouls and +1 luck
---
Level 50 Vanguard Forest scout Chest piece with +1 agility and 50% more durability.
---
Now that's a quality roll from mmurgh!!
---
I understand I was not sure how they were basing there allowance of camps it was explained to me.
---
You use the phrase 'beast with two backs' but I do not think it means what you think it means...
---
...either that or there's an animation in this game I haven't seen so far. 
---
Maybe I need to take off the power armor?
---
I have two nuke keycards but can't be bothered to go and launch. It's just the same thing over and over, and grinding is not worth my time.
---
They need to add more nuke bosses for other regions, and gives the silos random obstacles so they aren't identical every time.
---
Retro Thanos wanted a big tiddy goth gf
---
Is this for weapons and armor or just weapons?
---
I got from the purveyor the following
---
Had 3 drop in four/five hours last night all on the same server. Just depends on were u are.
---
Congratulations on your confessions and well played to you sir.
---
But there are those of us that were there for the beta and day one who have had all the disconnect issues and all the problems of the day to day grind of life that is fallout 76. But have had no need to dupe and find holes in the game to enjoy it. The game is what it is, it's trying to survive with a can of dog food and a knife, making what you can off the land and wildlife. Duping has ruined it all that free ammo that you've dropped for someone just for teaming with you has made it easier for them they didn't have to switch it up and modify their perks to gain that extra damage from that other weapon they forgot they had in their stash. Because of people like you you have cheated them out of an experience, caused all the prices to sky rocket so we have save and grind to get those caps to get that serum recipe or plan for that favourite piece of armour. Also all the nerfs as the world has been with tse, vanguard and sentinel. 
---
With all this you are also the reason Bethesda haven't made a stable game and fixed all the issues were having on a daily basis because they're having to clean up your mess before they can sort it out while at the same time bring out new content to appease players.
---
If all you dupers just stopped they wouldn't need to go back again and again fixing what you've broke and focus on stabilising the game, bring out more content and make economy, playability and all in game life better for us the true gamers.
---
I dodny notice that at all and there were 15 people there at least
---
When I eventually log on tonight I'll post a vid of my rolls might be fun. I'm also expecting crap so even 1 good weapon will make me happy
---
&gt;And to use No Man's Sky as an example is also hilarious. It's a game that a rocky but alright start because it was pushed out because of corporate greed but then became pretty much everything it promised to be in a relatively quick amount of time. Sounds pretty much like 76 to me.
---
You literally made my point for me and you can't even realize it. FO76 = Corporate Greed. This game is literally a pushed-out money grab. BGS has shareholders that profit from this and Atomic Shop sales. Are you really this fucking dumb, do you not understand how profits work? I have over 400 hours in this game, but that's all the time I have for, because I have real-world shit to take care of, so it'd be fucking nice if the time I'm able to devote to sitting down and playing this game was mostly bug-free.
---
I primarily go to player camps on the map to look at their camp design and/or when they're conveniently on the way to another quest or event. I assume by default that they probably won't have anything I want to buy. Occasionally I am pleasantly surprised. But even when I do see great looking items, they often seem extremely overpriced.
---
I have not had one single daily be added to it.
---
How does it level out the economy? If you mean caps that doesn't help with that part. And congratulations! You have good real life luck. I spent all 1,000 caps just trying to get one unyielding and got nothing. Everything was pvp (which I don't do) or reduced weight on junk etc. But my point remains. This is gambling. I want crafting.
---
The weird thing is that in all honesty the amount of any item should not be an issue only the number of unique items as the amount of them is just another variable like its damage or healing numbers if you have 1 .45 round it takes the same amount of computing power to deal with that one .45 round as it does to deal with 200 of them as long as they are in the same stack there should only be one item id and then the value that shows how many there are.  
---
I do hope they get a better system in place for this as I'm now stuffing my stash full with my lvl 30 shotgun/survival mode only build and its getting old fast.
---
Yup.  I have a home office and a work office filled with Fallout stuff.  I keep saying "That's it, I'm done, I'm stopping" and then I'll see something or make something. 
---
I have over 100 Nuka/Nuka variants/Sarsparilla bottle caps, and another 200 waiting for me to do something else with them.
---
In my experiences a 2 or 3 star enemy does not equate to a 2 or 3 star drop the majority of the time. Due to rng mechanics sadly quantity of legendary enemies gives you better chances at a 2 or 3 star drop than being more likely to run into a 2 or 3 star enemy. 
---
I can reliably get 6-10 legendary enemies to spawn at whitespring in a run, baring the occasional crap server. Not saying the burrows isn't worth running, i really just forget about it most of the time myself. If i wanted to just straight farm legendaries the most efficient way i would run whitespring than the burrows and hop.
---
Is this from a source? Where?
---
I didn’t know there was one! Never seen it
---
Crafting would make it 100x easier if you could get exactly what you want... thered be 0 point in farming or trading if you can just craft a god roll?
---
That’s great, didnt want to roll for the armor since i’ve been hearing about the wood armor glitch, but managed to snag a few sellable weapons on my 3rd and 4th “first purchases” hehehe
---
I'm down to trade, but not sure when I'll be on. I will message you when I do get on.
---
Tbh I wouldnt be scared, if you get the 3 wood armor, instantly vendor it and you get half your scrips back and dont risk the glitch haha
---
HOW WAS BACKYARD BBQ, THE SMITHS? PRETTY GOOD IT DOESN'T SEEM!
---
It isn't a fix for legendaries. It is nothing more than a way to give crap legendaries some value. Plus it added new legendary gear.  It adds content without removing anything. What did you think this update was supposed to fix? Plus, if they didn't have a cap on scrips, all those cheaters sitting on piles of duped godrolls would have near unlimited scrips.
---
Got a few anti armors, no explosive though from 2000+ scrip. Would love to see the video.
---
It becomes a 1\* Wood armor upon logging - sell it back for scrip if you havent logged off yet!
---
A quick internet search will pull up a Nuka label, some are already weathered.  Then go buy yourself a glass bottle Coke, scrap off the label, and glue the Nuka label on.
---
Nope, only gotten trash.
---
Not even the first roll as well.
---
Management manage the resources. These are always limited. It's all trade off and risk control. This isn't exactly the most significant of bugs and hardly worth days of delay to have belt-and-braces'd a test environment to avoid.
---
Is 30 the normal fire rate for these things?
---
I've got a normal Gatling laser that has a fire rate of 182.
---
You would still need to learn all the plans, get the high Intelligence and craft it. Plus it only makes it so you can choose the base item. You still have to roll for legendary effects
---
I think it’s 5%, capped at 5 or 6 hits.
---
So any rap music then?
---
There is a bugged version of a legendary effect (supposed to be disease resist) that we see as rad resist. It doesn’t
---
work. It exists on everything. Been that way since launch. Really annoying.
---
There is one overlooking the bridge past Harper's Ferry. If you follow the trail to the right that wraps around and up the side of the cliff, follow the trail of mining nodes and the trail actually continues around to the front of the cliff. Area is buildable. Other end has a cute doggo, too.
---
I would stop and marvel at this if I came across it in my travels.
---
Civilian underarmor mods work with the Military Fatigues!
---
fixed my reply :D sorry about the mistake
---
One of the challenges is to launch a nuke though, but yeah I agree people are prioritising the fresh content.
---
I wish they would strike a better balance overall with the dailies and not hyper focus on just the new thing.
---
Personally, I don't want the level up to fully revert to only just levelling.  However, I do think it needs to at least be reduced to any 2 things on the list or made into a tiered reward that gives atoms per objective up to 3 times (obviously with completed objectives not working for additional atoms).  They could even cap the overall daily reward amount of that is a concern, just giving more options for how atoms could be earned would be a substantial improvement.
---
did you check your character sheet to see if it gets added there or not? it may just be a bug that doesnt show on the item card itself
---
MOMMY'S COMING. DON'T STAND UNDER MOMMY!!
---
Tried 4 3*, 4 times shit, decided to move on and give it tomorrow the next chance to disapoint me
---
From what I’ve read they do.
---
I put some mole rat chunks in and they degraded.
---
What happened to her mystery pick - I didnt see it listed today
---
Ok 2 questions here- what is the purveyor and where is he because I want this shit, and secondly, how on earth do you get those attachments for the hunting rifle? I’ve scrapped like a trillion of them and I keep getting shite attachments
---
There is still the 150 per day limit. The cheaters shouldn't be a reason to punish everyone else. Have them IP banned for cheating and be done with them.
---
I’ve actually noticed more nukes
---
Does the Fridge mod currently not let food spoil as it is??
---
Yeah I heard about it. Unfortunately I was on my lunch break and couldn’t sell it back because I was waiting for vendor reset. Guess I’m screwed out of 21 scrip there.
---
"With all this you are also the reason Bethesda haven't made a stable game and fixed all the issues were having on a daily basis because they're having to clean up your mess before they can sort it out while at the same time bring out new content to appease players."
---
You are so full of shit here. They haven't made a stable game because they are incapable themselves of making a stable game. They don't have the ability. The engine is shit, Bethesda's knowledge of programming has always been laughable, and the game was purposefully half-baked from the get go.
---
Don't blame players for Bethesda falsely advertising an experience.
---
In the pic they previewed before the vendor was actually in the game there was an item listed as 3* mystery - 65
---
I complete agree, rng is just not fair, I've literally never gotten anything good and I'm almost level 200
---
See its weird cause I saw somebody selling a food item and it showed no condition on my screen. Figure its too good to be true though.
---
Are you still a tadpole? It's okay, I won't judge you.
---
*proceeds to judge you*
---
In my case a crew of about 5-10 rotating. None of us really cared to sell.
---
If that is the case is there any chance I could get a full refund on these three pieces of three star wood armor I got?
---
I don't know why people keep spreading this nonsense. There's multiple references to New Vegas in Fallout 4:
---
- The New Vegas sign is a landmark in the Atomic Command mini-game
---
- Deacon mentions Mr. House when he talks to Deezer
---
- One of the Robobrains in Far Harbor mentions Vera Keyes
---
- Sunset Sarsaparilla is mentioned in Nuka-World, and Nuka Victory and Quartz make an appearance
---
Nevermind the gameplay inspirations like equipment modding or a faction war storyline. Or the fact that every time they're asked about it in interviews, Bethesda's really fond of New Vegas. A lot of devs at Obsidian have mentioned Bethesda with respect, too. Stop pretending these studios secretly hate each other.
---
these camera challenges doesn't require teaming up.
---
Yes they do. Would be pointless if it didn’t spoil.
---
I laughed hard
---
Mine never showed up under floors but did show up under my stored for some reason.
---
Thank you for the datamining! Did you do it personally? I wonder if they'll actually implement it on Tuesday assuming they fix the Explosive Energy/Legacy weapons being in the loot table. They need to fix the 3* wood armor too, so hopefully this update comes sooner and not later.
---
Thanks for that input. There are a lot of sides to the issue, and I definitely do know I’m not on the right one according to most.
---
That's with thru hiker. Any min/max build doesn't use QOL perks like that. So water weights 0.5 for people without Thru Hiker. Inert flux is 0.2
---
Seems you have some incredible RNG. I've seen nothing but garbage on 5 characters.
---
I believe private servers will just divide the community into little pockets and absolutely kill the more social aspects of the game that we know right now.
---
I like the idea of being able to adjust game rules to taste but I like being part of a thriving community more personally. 
---
Do you think private servers would cause social stagnation?
---
I found a holotape near the bed and breakfast and she said she was bleeding and injured, I presumed she was dead. Can you clear the story up for me? I've tried to follow it but man is it all over the place.
---
Nice rifle drop. I got a 3 star shovel which I scrapped. Scrapped all other script purchases and have til wait til tomorrow to try my luck again. Winner winner chicken dinner!!!!   :)
---
It would also be nice to be shown a complete list of what outfits are tagged as what (for example, I had no clue until my wife told me that high fashion sunglasses count as formal wear too).
---
Vampire’s are great as a backup to a Bloodied build. The furious would be better for larger enemies or bullet sponges. If you run a full health build, use the Furious if you aren’t one- or two-shotting enemies. I’ve had around 10 legendary GGs so far, so I’ve used them a lot. They’re great for farming mole miners for shotgun shells. I even found one that puts in good work on the SBQ - Hunter’s explosive.
---
I know they introduced new armor pieces and levels on the wood.  I haven’t heard of new perks
---
Prior to my sudden appearances in other people's floors and walls, I actually hadn't ever considered the extent to which the way I built CAMPs might be atypical. I'd only ever put it on the ground near the garden &amp; then built a floating house on a single foundation. 
---
I'd love to be able to control the spawn point better but it seems unlikely they'll do this due to a few griefers. So instead the rest of us will unintentionally murder our shoppers as they fall off cliffs or get stuck in foundations with enemies that spawned there too or etc :P
---
This is like ea ultimate team subs. Theres a handful of people posting their amazing packs but everyone knows those are not typical results. For each AAE Lever theres 500 hunters rolling pins. If you got good gear your lucky, period.
---
I would argue an event. I feel like a daily would end up requiring travelling into the TotW. I would rather hear her but not have to deal with the load times.
---
That commons level is really under used too though.
---
Heh, I've run into spoiled food in some vending machines  'Spoiled Meat at 25c each? Take my caps now!'
---
I just got home from work, fast-travelled to the Purveyor, rolled this on my first attempt:
---
https://imgur.com/a/0Y5n4Hv
---
I got similar cryolator. 1100 script, all useless
---
Yeah it is super strange what gains traction here, especially lately.
---
Not sure about wing crippling - except for concentrated fire, I use those same perks with endangerol, plus cryolator. I'm not sure it works, and when she DOES sit on the ground for a prolonged period, I often wonder if it wasn't someone with the shotgun cripple perk instead.
---
West Tek is good for legendaries you want to keep, whitespring is good for shit you want in your vendor for cheap, or to scrap.
---
If it takes longer than 10 minutes to kill the queen youre doing it wrong. And 10 minutes is very generous. Normal time for my group is under 5 minutes depending on landing.
---
This is a good idea, but I don’t think it would work.
---
Well, sounds like it's time to play in the sandbox and explore.  Why do you have to follow the story?  Things got hard for me at lvl 25ish, so I tried to find every place in the forest, experimented with new tactics, push limits of where to go.  I'm finally at lvl 39 and am only .66 through the main story.  
---
Why do things need to be easier? Adapt and overcome.
---
Man I got a bunch of heavy guns!!! Out of 10 I did get a tse combat shotgun tho so that was cool at least. Also a vampires 50 cal so that’s decent. Also a bloodied auto grenade launcher and a bloodied broadsided 🤷‍♂️
---
Ah, news to me. Thanks.
---
That’s why I roll into whitesprings with a two shot Tesla rifle.
---
Got the same one almost!
---
What a roll.
---
Where is phillipelli cemetery? I haven't found that location. 
---
Also, does anyone have any tips for killing a yogi with a syringer? I tried twice last night. The first was a 78 glowing, and man did he hit hard. As I was about to kill him I got a CTD. Then the second one was a 38, I almost had him, but I pulled my 10mm smg out to kill something else, he came around a corner and startled me, and one shot killed him -_-
---
yea i hope they fix wood armor on tuesady as that would be awesome. i dont mind explosive energy/legacy weapons in the pool. They work correctly so idk why they arent anymore
---
*Almost heaven...*
---
But don't scrap it! For the love of Atom you must resist!
---
This is just wow.
---
I want "open for business" and anything with Robert C Byrd on it hahaha
---
Dont be discouraged, its the first day of many
---
Added a TL:DR. Yes, but they only changed it to more RNG gambling. By adding this simple fix it'll make crafting builds viable. Plus the chances of getting what you want with a full set of armor of the same type with the same strength (Heavy, sturdy, reg) is literally impossible. I just think it would kill many birds with one stone instead of adding more gambling to try to keep people playing.
---
Maybe if you give the weapons/armor to your alt to scrap, then see what level gear your alt gets from the Purveyor. It might be the same level, or level closest to your alt. Would be interesting to find out.
---
We've moved on to name calling. Let that rage build. You'll either join the Sith or the Red Lantern Corp soon. Pretty sweet powers either way. 
---
They pushed it out to make Christmas. Yes that's a bit of corporate greed but that's how you do things in the business world. 
---
They've also spent thousands of man hours to fix the holes in their insanely complicated code as well as add more and more content without charging you a single additional cent. 
---
What dicks!
---
No problem
---
got a 3\* fatman first try, garbage stats. used it for a badge tho. couldnt use it like its meant to be used(shooting) because everytime i shot it and saw the mininuke go far from me i blew up instead, even when im on a cliff and shoot forward, I BLEW UP INSTEAD! i had to melee enemys with it for the badge
---
That's awesome... my very first drop was a 3star anti armor explosive 50 cal machine gun with plus 1 agility.. the rest of the drops today wasn't great but I was very happy with that one... also got 3star AA gama gun , and 3star AA rail rifle.. I love it!
---
Thanks for a the replies that was quick! I had a feeling that was going to be the answer. I haven't played for quite awhile and I knew a lot had changed.
---
When i went an hour ago I had this twit trying to jump in front on me while I waited my turn. Since I don’t have a one shot, I saw this twit hang back pointing a rifle at me.  I said forget him and left server.
---
How did you exchange 2000+ scrip already? There's a 1000 scrip cap
---
True, but it takes a full week to get all the scrips just from daily limits alone. I gathered legendaries for a few weeks prior and got 1k scrip. Now I am out of legendaries other than the ones I bought which is a \~50% loss
---
Yeah. Though i haven't farmed whitesprings in a while but i never run out of legendaries to scrap.
---
Omg... Thank you for your pics. Helpful
---
I choose not to believe anything given that the world of fallout is so utterly different from our own. Megastores are a rather modern thing in our own world, and to me they seem like a stretch in a world that is still firmly rooted in 50's style culture and approaches to technology.
---
Thanks for this post
---
I have a “You’ve been insulted!” note listed for 25k. Still no takers.
---
2 different characters, and scrip for the day
---
Thanks for this
---
Just like when you get the legendaries in the first place
---
I feel like the amount of nukes has been fairly normal.  Maybe a little slower due to people focusing on getting their backpack with the mod they want, but I've seen a handful this week.
---
I never participate in a Whitespring Nuke until it's largely unpopulated.  I've gotten tired of JoeZerg2004 using his instigating super sledge to one-shot everything without a care for anybody else.  I don't really mess around hunting legendaries down in the Bog after SBQ, because the tertiary locations tend to have a lot of Scorched, which have a terrible % to be legendary, or just not a lot of spawns.  If I need to make more flux I'll mess around down there.  Otherwise I just leave after looting everything during the event.
---
My usual farming consists of a normal Whitespring, West-Tek and the Burrows.  I start with the Whitespring, because it's a clear and easy indicator of the server's "generosity" level.  Some servers drop one star legendaries like candy and others I can make an entire loop around the grounds and come away with 2-3 pieces.  If the server is generous at the Whitespring, I head to West-Tek for a much higher chance at lvl 50 pieces.  The Whitespring and The Burrows seem to be about 60/40 lvl 50/40 (45/35) drops.  West-Tek seems more like 75/25 for top level gear.
---
You Can still pvp in adventure mode???
---
Hahaha, true words!
---
Oh okay..I read somewhere that the Cap was shared between different characters on the same account. Guess that was wrong...I missed out on some scrip then haha
---
Thatll be in the patch next week, today there wasnt one the server didnt have to go down
---
Coffee is a diuretic so I think 25% hydration is too much. Plus coffee is in the game already as canned coffee which gives you 300 ap. 
---
Maybe some recipes. Coffee 2 sugars (canned coffee, 2 sugar, 1 boiled water 1 wood) gives you 100 ap, +10 ap refresh. Coffee cream 2 sugars (same as above + cream) 100 ap, +5 ap refresh, + 10% food or whatever cream does.
---
Well it wasn’t an update. They just activated the vendor. Far as I can tell nothing else is different.
---
Yup Ive given up making posts in this sub
---
If you use the search theres about 10 of these posts per day. Also the roadmap is helpful
---
i didnt get the mystery pick as an option and i am saddened by this.
---
Yeah I was doing 3 star ranged weapons and armor
---
true, it should give you more ap and less hydration
---
Like the idea, but razorgrain? Maybe add roasted silt bean? Either way, I like the idea.
---
No I don’t believe it would. Fallout fans are a community in and of itself and don’t need one iteration of a game to keep them together. With private servers, Fallout fans can create experiences that they miss from original iterations or more recent releases of the franchise. Furthermore, creating an environment as described in OP would provide support to RPers so that they don’t feel so disenfranchised.
---
Not if they dont agree to it (or are battling over a workshop).
---
There's literally nothing you can do about trolls like this, now.
---
I have this same rifle.  In a hazmat suit the damage goes up quite high.  But I soon realize its not doing the damage it was a minute ago.  A check in the pip boy verifies my suspision.  I Unequip then Reequip the rifle and damage goes back up...for a few minutes.  I'm convinced its bugged.  I've held onto it in hopes it will be fixed one day.  Hopefully luck with the new vender will convince me to part ways with my usless explosive rifle.
---
That’s what dumbass dupers did to the game. Duping -&gt; nerfing -&gt; nerfing again -&gt; Bethesda gives away explosives -&gt; everyone’s grandma is asking ‘you said I could one-shot them with this?’
---
They could simply cap the total atoms you can earn from dailies and include additional challenges for better variety and more inclusion to those that aren't easily able to group up (this would also make the inclusion of more challenging and interesting dailies less frustrating too, like all the red storm ones prior to allowing nuke zones to count for them or spending forever looking for a chicken when rng decided you won't see any until tomorrow....when they will be everywhere =).
---
Start reading yourself 
---
[https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/](https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/)
---
The fast travel mat should snap-to connect to the OUTSIDE of the CAMP build ring, so you can place it on the ground, but cannot build anything under it so it greatly limits the amount of traps you can make for a visitor.
---
I guess I got pretty lucky. Got a Vampire Explosive Reload Speed DB Shotgun. I just tanked through Westek with it, not trying to dodge or block anything and didn't need a single stimpak.
---
Damn, another week not being able to see stats on gear. That sucks.
---
Is there a charging barrel on it? That significantly reduces fire rate.
---
&gt;Disappearing stars on Purveyor legendaries?
---
I've been assuming this was to incentivize modding the camera to the better lens
---
People actually buy 2*?
---
That's kinda shitty tbh, I thought it was more
---
So you didnt get it either? It actually exists. Theres videos of people buying stuff and thats an option...so what do?
---
"You eat shit for breakfast?"
---
Very Jealous.  I spent over 800 scrip, and got nothing but crap.  Not a single TSE, or anything even remotely useful.    
---
I also paid for several 3 star items, and only got 2 star items in return...  Thanks Bethesda!  
---
Now I can't even scrap the items because the machine doesn't have enough scrip.
---
And make the frog glow like it did when I caught it.
---
I'm so sorry.

VATS melee is the way to go on Liberators and some of the flying bugs.. .saves ammo.

Jeez.  Second attempt.

I use spotlights, doesnt even have to light up the right area as long as they are placed and powered the turrets will hit an enemy the second it enters your camp circle
---
They have Walmart. Why wouldn't they have giant tool/lumber stores? Hardware Town doesnt really cut it, but for being essentially downtown in a massive city, it's pretty big. They are probably the Ace Hardware (is that a national thing?) of Fallout. 
---
And they do for sure have smaller but still substantial supplies of materials
---
What? That doesnt make sense.. if you're targetted by a gun solely your decision would vastly change than if you only heard a gunshot nearby whether you're in a group or alone. Mob mentality exists but your example is way off.
---
By any chance are you on console? Juicehead and a few other youtubers on PC have the option to buy it?
---
Tbh the right one-stars are way more powerful than most dumb three-stars.
---
What system are you on?  Since the intro to the Improved Repair Kits, me and my crew run nukes on a daily basis.  Just last night we ran all 3 nukes on server (SBQ on all of them), server hopped and ran a 4th before calling it a night.

I would really like to complete the main quest line. Any ETA know when the Final Warnings 0/5 motors crafted bug will be fixed?

This is why I don't go there until they got their kicks and left.  My cells are still going to spawn everything, only I actually get the opportunity to kill when I spawned instead of some lvl 350 guy camping at the Golf Club.
---
20 hours after you first sell something since the previous reset
---
Seen it on two servers already lol
---
That’s literally the gun I’m hoping to get. Congrats on a sick pick up
---
You're welcome
---
Good grief.
---
It’s up by prickets fort
---
Exactly same. My worst three-star experience to date.
---
Ahh.....yes there is.
---
Man I just tried to kill a level 65 scorched beast with that thing and it wasn't doing squat to her. A level 80 showed up and I had to bail on that experiment.
---
Wtf......I thought these things were supposed to melt scorched beasts.
---
wow, in the past 6 months i have played the game, i’ve never been aware of its existence. My post is completely useless now, but hey thank you for the heads up!
---
RNG is not fair....
---
Give me an example of a "fair" system.... I guarantee it'll actually just be a system that benefits you.....
---
It very well could, but it would make directing players much easier
---
So far you're argument has been:
---
1. r/iamverysmart
---
2. "Yes, I agree they are greedy and rushed it. But you're still wrong for pointing that out."
---
3. A statement so obviously redundant, telling me something I know well, that BGS employs people to work on the game still.
---
I honestly don't know how to explain this to you at this point. BGS will always employ people to work on the game, but that doesn't mean they're the best or getting the job done well. They literally do not have their top people working on this, it has been relegated to their Austin studios. I could make points all day, but you still wouldn't get it, *because you can't.*
---
What if it wasn't the "armor" that's legendary, but the power armor frame, that would make the "datamined" effects make sense, like low-weight and "nearly unbreakable" the first would drop the normal 10 pounds for a power armor, and the second would make the pieces on it have a very high durability.
---
As a Brotherhood fanatic I have to say Fallout 76 has been a great experience.  I really loved playing through the story and discovering all of the brotherhood content.  Even though you spend most your time chasing ghosts its still felt like I was witnessing the creation of the brotherhood.  Listening to Roger Maxon's messages to the first brothers, to hear the trials they faced, to hear his reasoning behind the structure of the brotherhood was just an awesome experience that only makes me love the brotherhood that much more.  There were a lot of issues with this game when it launched but the story content wasn't one of them in my opinion.
---
If your on PS4 pm me your PSN and we'll knock out the revive challenge for each other real quick.
---
What do I personally use? Well first, I do a bloodied stealth commando build with a bloodied handmade rifle and the mutation on that character are: carnivore (eat only meat no veggies with 2x benefits and veggies don't satisfy hunger), eagle eyes (-4 strength, +4 perception and +25% critical shot damage in VATS), bird bones (-4 strength, +4 agility and fall slower), adrenal reaction (+weapon damage at low health, -50 max health), healing factor (+300% health regeneration, -55% chem effects), grounded (+100 energy resist, -55% energy damage) and marsupial (+20 carry weight, jump higher and -4 intelligence). 
---
These mutation would probably be good for a bloodied stealth shotgunner as well because you're gonna be sneaking and using vats to target the head (swap concentrated fire perk rank 3 instead of lockpicking perks when not lockpicking and in combat). You can also use the chameleon electrically charged mutation against melee attackers but it won't do much because it does very low damage (doesn't even kill a level 9 feral ghoul reaver). 
---
Also, the weight reduction perks aren't gonna be that important because you're gonna store everything in your stash box - when you store something in the stash box, any specific weight reduction perks you have won't decrease the weight of the items in the stash box.
---
Oh I don't doubt, I just want to make a shop and I don't have enough space on walls or in my camp to add a thousand little signs
---
I think I wet myself a little.
---
Wow. Glad I grabbed some off someones vendor for 500 then.
---
Entitled? You gotta be fucking kidding me. Im right here with him and im sick of bethesda dick suckers like "Oh theyre always right!!!"
---
Bethesda is shitty. They do not have the right to do whatever they want to their consumers who paid for this atrocious game and still give loyalty to it despite its over 500 unresolved bugs. No. 
---
First off, this option for the mystery pick does exist on PC and youtubers have it in their videos. So if its just console, thats literally messed up. A good company would hold off on the release (like they attempted to with the camera) until everyone is reassured to get the same choices across all platforms. They at least tried there. Now if its one person can get that on the server, fine. But Bethesda does this shitty stuff all the time, and the community largely hates it. Like the secret nerfs, lack of information, ect. 
---
So you literally think its okay for Bethesda to give their consumers the backburner? Good for you buddy. Now go buy your repair kits.
---
Haha classic Bethesda.
---
It's like the Spray and Pray from FO4 BUT BETTER!
---
Only 2100 now, forgot what I spent some on
---
If you are on PS4, my wife might become a regular (she had the worst luck getting stinging barbs, multiple times having gone to the quest spot to kill them and not getting any =).
---
Best roll was an explosive pipe pistol (I know no one wants a pistol). Second was ghoul slayer + fire rate handmade, modded it out for auto and it sold for 3 in my vendor. Wish I went with the armor but oh well. That was out of 12
---
Yes. Not trying to be vague neither, but yes.
---
Got three pieces of forest scout armor today, just need a chest and left arm and I’ll be happy.
---
im at around 9850 right now, i had an even 10k couple months back but spent like 2000 at some point. so ive had around 12-13k total since playing. all earned ingame.
---
5000 i bought the first 2 excavator skins than get mad cause they keep releasing newer better ones. Nothing else in atom shop is of much interest to me.
---
When i got my six pieces of trash the guy before me probably got something far worse and went full postal,  he started shooting the purveyor and everything in the store then went out to machinegun the legendary recycle machine. It was just hilarious.
---
Best I got was an instigating Harpoon Gun and an explosive 10mm. Love that hunting rifle though, although I prefer AA.
---
I'm on PC, are you? Somebody else said Juicehead and other youtubers have shown the mystery pick in action. Datamining showed that the mystery pick would get released in an update, maybe they kicked it into gear and got the update out by the end of the day on account of everyone being so irked. I'm going to get back on and see if I have the option yet.
---
I can probably count the number of legendary scorched I've seen since the first Thursday of BETA on my fingers and toes.  Try to put the Berkeley Springs workshop on the very edge of the zone so that Harper's Ferry, the Burrows and the Thunder Mtn Substation get hit.  Those are the gold mines for legendaries.  Treehouse Village might not be bad, if you can fit it into the circle.  A few aquatic critters and a handful of ghouls there.
---
I'm on PC, what're you on? Can you buy it?
---
100% agree I’ve tried making custom signs with what we’ve got but doesn’t turn out to my liking, I’m just annoyed they somehow managed to make camp building  worse with the last patch. Honestly I’ve spent more time build a rebuilding then anything else in the game and the past week it has just been a mess.
---
Having the ability to purchase a one time use mod and attach it to a weapon for a large amount of scrip, like 1000 scrip, I still have to go out, farm an ass ton of legendarys and commit to coming on to earn that one mod so that over time I can actually get the amour and weapons I want instead of just mabey, if I'm lucky, I can get a weapon that is barely good, plenty of other games do this and it works perfectly fine.
---
Are you from Greenbrier county or is that a state wide thing now? I grew up in Lewisburg in the late 90's so I'm kind of oblivious haha
---
You gonna cry, gonna piss your pants
---
Maybe shit and c*m
---
ditto,  oh shit!  i just posted!  :-/
---
Funny thing is, it might become more valuable due to that. I've got a bit of a collection of glitched items, I just got a 3* assaultron head from the vendor and am out of scrip for the day. If the stalker's effect is gone tomorrow, I might keep it around for the collection. There's no other way so far to get a legendary weapon without a prefix mod
---
What's so good about weightless sentinel say compared to unyielding and vanguard?
---
I got a Hunter's Ultracite Gatling Laser on PC from Scrip.

LOL I LOVE WHEN PEOPLE ARE SO DEEP IN BETHESDAS ASS AND LIES THAT THEY LITERALLY SAY NAH CONSUMERS ARE WRONG!!!!!! BETHESDA IS ALWAYS RIGHT GUYS!!!!! NO MATTER WHAT ALWAYS AND FOREVER. Screw the fanbase, bethesda feed me more of your crap!! 
---
This is the fucking problem with this reddit, that LITERALLY EVERYONE knows and the other fallout reddits make fun of, This reddit will downvote ANY negativity that isnt sugar coated into oblivion (pun inteded) and give YOU shit for having problems with BETHESDAS shit

Notice how most posts are "bethesda I love you and youre doing great :) but..."
---
NAH.
---
3.5x sneak attack critical headshots with my two shot crossbow wipe super mutant overlords off the face of the planet
---
No sorry I ment, are u able to fit Burrows and purveyor in 1 nuke range
---
I NEVER launch a nuke with my main character, who's a rifle guy.  I always use my alt with his T-51b and anti-armor super sledge.  Everything about the silo run is 100% easier.
---
At least they're doable. Challenges like take a shot of grahm riding Scorchbeast queen fighting moonwalking imposter sheepsquatch are the worst. I understand, bethesda want money, but they could just reduce number of challenges instead of making them impossible
---
Are you sure? Daily limit is 150 and I think it’s personal not server
---
F as in farm yes?
---
Just spent 600+ legendary script tryna get a good piece of unyeilding armour. Not even close aha
---
It is buyable, but im wondering about the availability. If you watch Juiceheads newest video of him trying out the vendor, its an available thing to purchase. Im wondering if its like...one person in a server can get it then its sold out? Still garbage for that though. But yeah definitely go check it out. It is a thing available to buy...More confusing shit from beth.
---
Sick man in case you don't know, pipe weapons benefit from both rifle and pistol perks.  you could hypothetically get get +120% damage if you invested all 18 perks though that's a hefty investment.  
---
OTOH you can take 6 perks to get +60% is a better deal than the 9 it normally takes.
---
Hehe I had a full set at one point, but game bugs caused three pieces to disappear. I haven't tried the vendor yet.
---
Knew people would cry when they didn’t get their TSE on the first day lol
---
OH NEVERMIND. just got to the end of the video as im typing. Its listed but it wont let you purchase.
---
A+++++++++ Bethesda.
---
I just ran through Wes Tek this morning and didn't face a single legendary. Am I missing something?
---
A whole bunch of explosive stuff lol. Explosive black powder rifle, explosive .50 cal, explosive junkie's weightless assault rifle, and an instigating black powder rifle on top of that. Just went in for one more roll for the day and got a fire rate + reload speed double barrel. Not great but still decent
---
"I wish a buckethead would show up.  I'd rip his legs clean off....."
---
*throws a box of bladed sugar bombs into West-Tek*
---
"Here super mutant.....I got a treat for you!"
---
*urrrrrgh!
---
More opportunities for a decent weapon or Armor.
---
That is because people like me need him for the badge challenge (I haven't encountered a Mothman outside of the event one since November, though my wife and daughter have run into several just this month...but none of those had a wing on them or they fled before being killed).  Not sure I'd pay that price atm, but in a month or so I could see myself doing it just to be done with the challenge (and undoubtedly to be plagued by Mothmen who drop wings for days after buying =).
---
this.
---
Worse rates for good legendarys than optc or dokkan battle. xD
---
I've gone through whitesprings 3 times today. Not a single legendary.
---
Not discouraged at all, already have the base weapons I want for my build; Purveyor is just another avenue to try to perfect the rolls!
---
If that's how you enjoy the game, then go for it. Like I said, I don't really care as long as it doesn't affect other players in a bad way; just the same as I didn't care if other players decided to cheat in Fallout 4 or install one of those horrible anime mods...
---
You just have to keep in mind that what you're doing is bannable, and accept the consequences and the risks (which I'm sure you already have).
---
It was 15% in FO4, but everything I’ve read says 5-10% in FO76. Plus they have to be consecutive hits on the same target. If you hit something else, it resets the count.
---
Rinse and repeat friend, the RNG game.
---
It doesn't work that way its 150script per person i log dont log in daily so not sure on times but 24hrs is the usual rate
---
Oh I had no idea that was a thing, I’ve been looking everywhere and I couldn’t figure out why every machine was out of script for me but that would definitely explain my problem. I just thought since it was the first day of the legendary vendor being out that everyone was pretty much doing the same thing
---
And blackjack.
---
The same thing happened to me with radium rifles, I have no idea why.
---
PS4 :(
---
When you level up, it shows all the cards you can add to your selection of cards that you can equip at any time, but after you pick one, you can't take any more from those cards until you level up again. If you unequip something, you can always equip it again at any point, but you can't equip cards you haven't used to level up yet. It's kinda hard to word but I hope that clears up what I mean.
---
Yeah I had no idea, I’ve been looking everywhere and couldn’t find anything so that’s why I was frustrated
---
I spent the time making 12 Smores (with a little help from Super Duper) and put them in my vending. No one bought them.. It was a sad day, and I have the refridegeration mod on my pack.. Should have just passed em out at the campfire tales quest... Lesson learned.
---
The lmg only has 1 mod which most that spawn in game already have which I believe is the muzzle break, the 50 cal has the heavy barrel and the prime reciever, however both gatlings have a few mods. Probably low %s to learn anything... I hope this helped.
---
We're all ps4 too.  We play on a daily basis.  DM me if you're looking for a group and I'll give you my PSN name.  We have roughly 13 of us that game up at different times but the PM crew usually has around 6-8 members.
---
Why are you so invested in something you hate so much? 
---
And to retort to your chosen points...
---
1. Why do you think I come across like that? Is it because I can argue without going rage blind over a piece of entertainment?
---
2. You arn't wrong for pointing out that corporations want to make money. You are wrong for thinking that you have a right to feel so entitled to telling an artist (a stretch I know but you get the point) how to present their art just because you spent a little money on it. 
---
3. I'm telling you an obvious statement because you don't seem to understand that they have people fixing things as fast as they can while still adding new things to do. For free to you. But that's not good enough. You'd do it oh so much better. 
---
And you're right. You could make points all day and I wouldn't get it. But that's because they are poorly argued and all over the place. You arn't even raging now about the same thing you started (even though I keep trying to bring you back)
---
yes
---
If you use explosive weapons (AAE, TSE, BE) you should always have 5 in Demo Expert, especially if you're a sniper build and with explosive. If you have Sneak 3 and Covert Operative 3, using VATS go for the weak areas eg. head, and then the damage should be enough.  With VATS, Concentrated Fire 3 each hit gains more accuracy. I have a BE Handmade, but even near my max health level 68 supermutants take 2-3 shots max to kill (in semi-auto mode).
---
they just need lvl 51 weapons where say all rifles(lvl 51 versions) for example all do the same base damage before any mods or legendary effects so people can actually use a weapon they like ingame. sure some guns or melee weapons wont be quite the same damage since they all dont have the same mods but the damage gap would be incredibly small unlike current weapons are now. oh you like the 10mm pistol? well guess what its complete garbage and useless endgame no matter what mods/legend effects it has right now, better go melee or handmade/lever action for decent damage.
---
Standard armor is trash for heavy gunners. Stabilized is a keystone perk. VATS is terrible for HW, so you don’t get those benefits from unyielding. At that point, why even bother? Especially as a low health heavy gunner- Emergency Protocols blows cav/sent out of the water (if you didn’t know, full PA has innate ~45% damage reduction.) Stack that with Emergency Protocols, and you have massive damage reduction always active, none of this not moving/sprinting shit. Heavy gunners hardly find weight reduction useful; Bear Arms is 90% weight reduction.
---
Love the reference (such a great song =).
---
Doing the Math it's 1 in 100 to get the exact armor type you want (ie heavy leather left arm) and with the max scrip limit per week it gives you a 16.66% chance per week (60 scrip per 3 star armor) to get one piece (6 weeks), with 5 pieces so about 7.5 months alone to get a full set of 3 star armor of the same type you want, legendary effects aside. With legendary effects applied there are about an average of 25 legendary main effects on weapons and 20 on armor and about 10 per minor star, which would mean to get a full set of matching armor with what you want would take about 1,562.5 years for a full set of what you want....
---
Hahaha, dokkan is the worst imo. Guaranteed ssr on a multi, and you get an off banner ssr.  Have you tried dffoo? That one’s pretty f2p friendly
---
At 6:13 he says it is missing himself.
---
My lvl 34 alt got 2 lvl 50 and 1 lvl 45 on my try today.
---
I’m with you. A heavy gunner not using PA is silly, especially a low health build.
---
That is part of the game man, It isn’t fun untill you blow your own feet off. Hahaha
---
Oh no, I stacked all the cards. It's a sick gun. 
---
Just not my style. I'd sell it off for sure
---
Yeah I thought it worked like the normal vendors my bad
---
If you remove too much RNG everyone will have god rolls
---
This was mentioned by a few dataminers and data collectors in the past, but I am convinced that there is a seed based on your character and server that prioritizes some effects. 4 of my 9 weapons were explosive, and 4 others had damage while aiming. About 80% of my legendaries in the past week were either suppressor's, bloodied, or vampire's, and almost every single secondary effect was either swing speed, explosive, or aim damage
---
The Berkeley Sprongs station is actually kind of on the southern outskirts of the town.  There's actually a map marker there now, but you can also figure that it's on the rails nearby Berkeley Springs.
---
Ah that's gotta suck. And the vendors fair. Just gonna be very grindy, which I don't have time for so am really relying on luck, which I've never had much of
---
Alternatively, I'd like to be able to go to the Forest or Cranberry Bog without the *same two damn dailies* starting every time
---
I did check my character stats and taking on and off the armor does not effect character's rad resist.
---
It's just a game bro. I'm the exact opposite I do care if players really have items vanishing from there stash or inventory as long as it's not a dupe. If I had seen that lots of people was complaining about it I'd give the post a thumbs up.
---
I was fighting mirelurk queen the other day, near X3 quarry. I've hid in the metal barracks and she couldn't target me, but then! a bunch of mirelurk babies stormed the place, opened the door so theirs mommy could resume spitting at me :O
---
Ah, gotcha.
---
Heh having started a new job recently, I'm tight on time myself.
---
See I was in the same boat at you I was around level 20 about to give up you you either A) need to find somebody to play with it's easy to make friends in this game I find or B) treat it differently then their other games and accept stuff is baiscally locked behind levels.
---
What do you play on making a network of friends saved this game for me I might be able to help
---
Oh. Not sure
---
What system?
---
[anyone can do that man](https://imgur.com/gallery/ls4NMkQ)  even comes with a free mod on it.
---
No clue my friend, only character I've spent scrip with is 171 and got all max level kit.
---
If you are lvl 48 I'd probably just knock out those last 2 levels before going nuts spending scrip just in case.
---
Putting a caps on scrip isn’t that big of a deal seeing how you would have to farm 6 days (I believe someone calculated it) worth of scrip to reach the max. It also makes sure that people go ahead and do other things instead of standing at a train station scrapping legendaries the entire day.
---
I mainly play solo but occasionally might come across low level legendary items that I do drop by unsuspecting peeps and gift it to them it doesn’t make the game easier you can still die at lvl 200 easily but it does give them a bit of a good start and it makes them enjoy the game a bit better
---
Well, Nuclear Winter starts next month, but for the next two weeks I imagine we'll at best get object displays for camps.
---
Xbox1
---
i tried it on my level 4 and got a max level gun.
---
I have a tse gatling laser, its not good for scorchbeasts either. Mostly just good for putting on a fireworks show tbh.
---
Rats. The vamp explosive is a good roll!
---
Cryolator is good for the SBQ though. Haven't tried yet.
---
Bro I’m level 76 and can destroy legendaries EZ
---
Happy for you man, most people are just wishing for god rolls and then complaining if they dont get it.  Glad you got something you can use, or sell.
---
I'm super disappointed myself. I'm guessing because of that post recently explaining how the RNG on it leaned heavily in your favor so maybe they want to tweak it a bit more before putting that option in.
---
That’s funny!
---
Me too. Instantly traded it back in. So disappointed but I'll keep trying.
---
Power fist id say is atleast mid tier so not trash, and the smg might be worth a good amount to the right person forsure
---
I’d like to see the limit bumped a bit, at least for the first couple of weeks, but unlimited would remove a huge percentage of legendary items from the economy. The chance of stumbling on a cheap, great item is one of the incentives to traveling to CAMPs and interacting with people .
---
If scrip were unlimited a lot of people, if not almost all, would scrap everything that isn’t immediately useful to them, leaving very little for sale.
---
Because he's a frooooooog!!!
---
congrat!.  MurmghI gave me semi- crap stuff.   Actually it's not crap, but it's crap in my mind because it wasn't something like you got. :( time for intense Whitesprings and West Tek looting this weekend.
---
That instigating power fist would be pretty sweet for an unarmed build
---
You need more armor penetration; focus on getting tank killer to 3* and that alone will help significantly. Even more so, try to get some anti-armor weapons for your build. Even if they're just 1* legendary, they will make a significant difference in damage. The kings primary attack is energy based, so you're not doing yourself any favors in excavator armor.
---
As for mirelurk kings... those and queens are on my "avoid if possible" list. They will both wreck your shit and the legendary variants even more so. For my build, a 1* AA 50 cal does solid work of mirelurk kings and legendary variants; but I still need to use a few stimpacks in T-51B/X-01. Queens have a poorly designed AOE acid attack "puddle" that gives no visual indication of where its at (thus the poorly designed, imo)... I use a two-shot automatic grenade launcher on them from as far as possible. Straight scorched earth tactics on them.
---
How many caps for the VE gatling?
---
it is as I feared, then. I only play solo, I don't really have the ability to play with other people unfortunately. It's not something I'm capable of or that interests me at all, so maybe FO76 just won't really work for me and I might just need to move on.
---
Thank you for taking the time to reply.
---
You have to initiate the take over first by opening the build menu while inside the build area start the PvP side first I think.
---
I have a Vamps smg not even explosive and I love it
---
Normal vendors have the same daily limit, server doesnt affect it
---
Too salty needs more Wine.
---
Well, not your in-game luck.. but your IRL luck, yeah.. ;)
---
Just for this post, I'm going to fill my home with frogs.
---
I got 2 explosive guns from her today. A troubleshooter pipe pistol and an executioner smg
---
Yeah sucks when you really want those unyeilding sentinel +1 or whatever it is combat armour and it's never going to happen
---
In answer to your question - because that would be a highly intrusive and frustrating mechanic
---
makes sense, kind of a pain when i have tonnes of useless legendary's and have to delete most of them because of the 150 a day cap.
---
Missile launcher

The only character of mine that wanted a backpack was my rifleman , he is not a crafter of armor or weapons . That blocked me out of almost all of the challenges. So after looking into it I found the event campfire tales, it's at camp Adams . Every time it's starts to get late , I keep checking the time in my pipboy, at 8:30 I fast travel to camp Adams , sometimes that doesn't trigger the event , so I just keep walking far enough away to fast travel back. Usually no later than 9:30 it triggers . Multiple times per server, no need to server hop . But you still can if you'd like. Important note. Do not be in vats while quest rewards are coming in . Will not get a badge . I did the event over 100 times , what I came to find out was that I was almost always in vats cleaning up left over mobs after the event . Never got a badge like that . The few times I did I was always not in vats and was able to see the quest rewards coming in. I got my five badges and my armor plated mod. I will do this again next time I need acid, stimpacks or rad away. Also I've heard that you can get badges from stings and things and the cleaning mission.
---
4300 at the moment but I like to build up my camp so I've picked up quite a bit of decorating stuff probabily spent more than I currently have
---
I definitely wouldn't complain about that seed haha not saying you are of course!
---
I want that smg. Is there anything you are looking for
---
I know a dude who plays all the time, and built his set by buying it in under a week. I wish I had the time to maximize caps like that, and know someone selling.
---
The "Good With Salt" perk currently affects flux, I use it all the time.  I don't see why the refrigerator mod would be any different.  It'd actually be more difficult to code it another way so if anything count on them being lazy.
---
Perma ban exploiters and delete all duped items, there’s no other way to save the game as well as tons of Bethesda’s wasted time and money in ‘rebalancing’ the game caused by rampant duping. Bethesda has been so slow and soft in dealing with this, some dupers even bragged that they have better lawyers, it’s a real shame for a company like this.
---
I'm actually from the west coast but my wife is a Huntington native. I spent a few years living out there and still call it Robert C. Byrd's WV because of how prolific his name was. The "Open for Business" slogan was revealed while I was out there as an attempt to get more businesses into the state, not sure if it kept up or whatnot but I remember quite the grumble about missing "Wild and Wonderful" emanating from many a holler.
---
Firstly, scrap the lowest level you can make of that gun - it’s cheaper. Use perks to minimize cost of manufacture and maximize scrap value. If you can, target enemies that may carry the weapon you’re trying to customize
---
Second, look online to see which mods are available for the weapon - there may not be that many, or even none. Even if there are a lot, you don’t need every one - just focus on the ones you want and then stop...
---
This is what I’m hoping for.
---
Really? I thought the vendors shared the caps and some inventory items like legendaries between players? I know the legendary has to be sold by another player for one to even be there to buy but I thought it at least shared the caps?
---
That's disgusting.
---
You’re citing a market warped by dupers and it’s not really fair to do so.  
---
Also, “The Action Hero” is a good weapon. TS/FFR on an already high RoF weapon is good, but again, your expectations of what good weapons are have been warped.
---
Who has Walmart?
---
can you link me to that post please? I haven't seen it
---
I won't force the issue any more, but neither was I till I did if you play on PS4 and change your mind HMU. Besides hopes not lost instead of doing quests set your own goals I hope you find a game you do like have a nice day man
---
You can only get 1400 caps per 20 hours from vendors without having bought anything
---
Who said they were always right? That's hilariously so untrue nobody would believe that. But then again, there are Flat Earthers. 
---
If you continue to use what you deem a defective product even though its oh so terrible than that's all on you. 
---
If you also fail to see that they have and are continuing to spend thousands of man hours to fix said bugs while at the same time adding new material, than you are being willfully blind in order to feed your own opinion. 
---
And you are seriously saying that it would be better to push back something just so entitled people wouldn't rage over an insignificant option? No. Of course it wouldn't. Because then you'd be raging about that. 
---
But yeah, let's bring up the repair kits again. Because that was the last issue to invoke rage but turn out absolutely insignificant. 
---
At least bitch about the wood armor bugs in the Purveyer. Not that you don't have the option to spend a little bit less on something you are going to bitch about being garbage anyway.
---
Yeah me too man. I just want a nice bloodied and unyeilding loudout so I can tank fights for my friends.
---
I finally have my ammo capacity back to a reasonable level so let the nuking return!
---
Yeah. First time in a long while that it's turning up good. A few weeks ago almost all my drops were nocturnal and mutant slayer.
---
I'd say so but it's tough to say without knowing the specific stats. Idk how rare they are though. If you're on in about 4-5 hours from now, I'd check them out and possibly buy or trade you for one of them. Shoot me a message on Xbox if you're interested and I'll hop in your game when I see you online. GT: Hugh Jephinkalk
---
Anything gets duped out of hand, Bethesda will have to nerf it, it’s that simple.
---
IMO, Level 20-40-ish are hard(er). Stop the main quest until you are strong enough.
---
Do all Forest and Toxic Valley and Ash Heap events that you see; get public workshops quickly build a stash and scrap/stash your junk in case someone decides to kill you.
---
Use all the weapons and ammo that you find; for example, if you find a pipe weapon, use it until it breaks or run out of ammo, then switch to another weapon; always have a melee weapon as a backup and main if fighting low level ennemies, so you don't waste ammo.
---
so ether its suppose to be a 3 star minus this bug OR they where never suppose to be on the 3 star list and I was robbed of 5 three star pulls cause that's how many 3 star wood pieces I got(had) before I logged off.
---
I get this often, on the road a bit SE of Harpers Ferry.
---
Not only Japanese. Every other language besides English as it seems
---
At least you can play i not been able to get on for about 5 day's now because every time i try it logs me in finds a world server then says disconnected from server before I get on it ! I am not the only one i submitted tickets and keep getting the same reply.
---
Missile launcher covers mine pretty well
---
I've been looking at the fan mashing E for ten minutes now. I think the game is broke.
---
Yes, definitely.
---
Well dang I had no idea about that either, thanks for letting me know though lol
---
MFW i always throw out my 308, last time i dropped over 2k 308s cause i dont use them.
---
Not conspiracy theory or anything..but... 5/8 of my 2* ranged weapons had bashing.
---
“The ladder you climb” is the rate at which you clear farming locations and the resources required to do so, my main can run through West-Tek in 8 minutes, can clear a nuke zone clubhouse in less than a minute with very little crafting and repairing required.  
---
You’re just coming off a super entitled at this point.
---
Not sure how tanky those builds are. My buddies consider themselves to be glass cannons. They're much more likely to die on nuke runs now, and frequently die and spawn during queen fights. But the damage they deal is nutso.
---
Because dupers ruin everything and a limit is easier than finding and permabanning them.
---
1-(1-AA1)*(1-AA2) = Total Anti Armor
---
Example: 50% and 20%.
---
1-(1-.5)(1-.2)
---
1-(.5*.8)
---
1-(.4)
---
.6 or 60%
---
Consider making a second character, different build maybe and then farm with both. I have 3 and cashed out them all when I needed something
---
The devs know about it don’t know when it will be fixed
---
Bloodied ANYTHING can do pretty well 👌
---
I’m genuinely not sure if they nerfed EXP gain or what since I started playing, but ever since the BETA I’ve been playing completely solo, and I haven’t had much difficulty. Leveling is definitely much slower alone, but I was able to manage it pretty well by just doing Everything. I did every quest I came across, thoroughly explored every location in a region before moving onto the next, and while i did struggle a bit from time to time, I think that’s part of the challenge. Unless you’re with another player, you’re very likely never going to be fully prepared for the next region of the game without grinding a bit. All I can really say is that i just did literally everything and went everywhere I could think of and did some mild grinding of events and stuff for rewards and built my camp as fancy as I could make it and eventually I hit level 104, completely solo (not counting the times I participated in group events, but I have never played in a Party/Team)
---
Super Duper Mart is 100% Walmart. Is there any argument it isn't?
---
I think it’s because his daily is technically supposed to be for the Tadpoles, so he thinks you are one because you keep returning to him
---
6000 caps?
---
Today I ran the Encryptid event.  Invited a bunch of people before I started it.  Died only once.  That bag vanished quickly.
---
I also watched mother! for the first time, so that just felt like a double-whammy of betrayal.
---
My understanding is it was giving out 1-star armor. Removed until fixed.
---
I totally understand the need for more RP tools. I mean this game needs them BADLY. I'm really not sure if the dev team has any actual roleplayers on it given the state of the game right now, so I totally have sympathy for the points being made.   
---
I would still rather see these tools put into the main product instead of getting shoehorned into a private server though, We're only ever going to be able to fit so many people into a single shard of the world and I still think it will lead to stagnation, even with the best of the RP community present and trying to keep things fresh.   
---
I'm not saying I'm right or anything, in fact it wouldn't be the first time I have been dead wrong, but after decades of playing online I just don't see private servers getting the same social interaction we have now.  
---
I just wish we as roleplayers had the tools right now to really help the rest of the community understand that there is another playstyle out there that probably has some bits to it that they would really enjoy.   
---
It is super strange to me that at a time that D&amp;D is having a resurgence online gaming is further away from RP than it ever has been.
---
Yea seems that way. Do the "tokens" do anything?
---
Why you know the devs knows it ? Really ??
---
I don't have the backpack either - I guess I'm too lazy to follow so many directions, so I just go to White Springs and kill Ghouls instead 😢
---
However, I was excited when somebody died next to me so I could get the "Revive a companion" sub quest. 
---
Maybe we should team up and get the backpacks?  I really want one.  And the camera, I don't know what to do next to get the camera.
---
I got an executioners ultracite Gatling gun
---
Yeah I was surprised not to see it being offered
---
Dunno, the machine is at any train station, maybe the assets hadn't loaded yet?
---
Well if you're on PS4 I'd happily be your 308 bin
---
Yeah....I better take that charging barrel off. If that thing isn't gonna do any damage I want to at least make it look like it is.
---
Just on this - does luck play a part in event rewards?
---
I ran into a 3* legendary queen at the end of the strangler heart event maybe 3 weeks to a month ago.  That poison was no joke.
---
Drats you beat me to it! 😂😂
---
System?
---
Suppressors radium rifle with bashing here, junkies’ 10mm and nocturnal flamer with bashing, can’t even recall what other POS i got lol
---
No she scrapped it.
---
I've seen the seed theory come up a few times today. I'm not convinced in how it works, but i think I'm going to try server hoping in between each purchase. If i hit a good roll I'll stay on that server. There are a lot of people reporting that got nothing but crap rolls which leads me to think they were on a crap server and spent all their scrip there.
---
level 1 Tank Killer and level 3 ranks for Rifleman, Expert Rifleman and Master Rifleman perks as well as Piercing Magazine on My Assault Rifle. The one that provides AP and increased ammo capacity. 
---
I know I need AA but all my legendary drops have been not AA and my rolls with the new legendary vendor gave me a few AA but for weapons my build is not made for. Like an ultrcite laser pistol and pump shotgun. 
---
I know I need more AP in my build but there is still no way they should be that strong to wipe you out so fast even the regen effect of stimpacks isn't enough to keep you alive.
---
If you get the perks and legendary armour perfect you're almost untouchable. A mix of massive bonuses to armour stats with perks and alot of 75% chance to reduce damage armour and perks etc
---
Another post had a developer respond and will be fixed soon
---
It pops up a message on their screen.  It doesn't boot them from the vendor screen, you just hope they choose to exit to see what's up so you can ninja in there and catch the vendor's attention.
---
Ive honestly never had a problem with caps I just been spending like crazy and dude wants 15k for the gun lol
---
And what makes you think the main story is finished?
---
&gt;Mirelurk kings are nasty little fucks - their poison is really strong. A single stack will get you down to like half health within a couple seconds.
---
Yea extremely nasty so much so they were able to kill me despite the stack regen effect of at least 3 or 4 stimpacks boosted by Field Surgeon perk.
---
I have a tse pipe rifle and i can't get it to do any decent damage to save my life, its a level 45 too.
---
Oh, I was referring to doing SBQ, after the silo run. Sorry, should have made that clear. She's the waste of ammo with usually crappy drops.
---
Pro tip: Invest in the Can Do perk under Luck, get it up to 3 stars.  You can search food containers (which includes garbage cans of all sizes) for food, which yields a lot of canned coffee.  Otherwise, it's one of the more rare spawn in kitchens and pantries.  The Sunday Brother's cabin west of Harper's Ferry has some in the locked basement.
---
I've played enough fifa, and opened enough packs to know what's going on here...
---
Bashing damage is clearly the worst perk you could possibly get on a ranged weapon let's be honest. 
---
So it's more likely to drop....... Which is absolute guaranteed proof that its not a random pick at all and each weapon type and perk as a percentage chance added to it.
---
Because some people on this subreddit spend so much time obsessing and crying over New Vegas they assume Obsidian's employees must do the same, well Bethesda's are ashamed.
---
I have no numbers to back it up, but I suspect that bashing damage also makes weapons more durable. This was particularly true for a 2* quad handmade I had. I used that thing daily for months and I think I only repaired it two or three times. All I know is it far outlasted my other handmades.
---
You may want to test that out for yourself, it might not be as useless as it seems. 
---
Or it might...it’s hard to tell from one weapon, but probably worth experimenting.
---
I'll try mod the pipe this evening and see how it compares/feels in comparison.
---
It's called Wii Tennis.
---
Getting the backpack makes You a Tadpole , before that You were a scout recruit , after doing all the possum badges You should become a possum after they fix all the bugs of course .
---
It's not removing, it's reducing. I put another comment below with the numbers of how long it would take. It simply makes it realistic
---
You can solo this entire game my dude. You're just in the rougher patch where XP gains aren't obvious and there isn't much story content to bridge the gap. Just do some events, explore and kill some things, stock up on supplies/scrap/ammo. The events are a big part of it I think. Also building your camp will dish out a bit of XP I believe.
---
I'll swing by and take a look GT is SteinLone
---
ya i wanted to make my first purchase the mystery option and it wasnt there :(
---
7000
---
They commented on another thread just like yours
---
That's what server hopping is for.  Let me know when you get that map link.
---
It's supposed to scale to the character.
---
Because Bethesda wants us to play this game for no more than an hour per day.
---
I made one for the challenge the other day and as soon as I saw it I said "No, let him out!" aloud to my tv. Like a normal person. They have such sad expressions.
---
Just a friendly warning.  I am actually a Yorkshireman.
---
But I'll let it drop as I'm low on gravel.
---
Lemme know how that works out for you under real combat conditions. I just don't see it being highly practical except in niche circumstances.
---
My knives don't need ammo. I land nearly all my bug hits without VATS.
---
Sure, who doesn't want less bats?
---
I'm an explosive/heavy build for late game events, and even though I have some seriously awesome Legendaries, they fall behind my mundane heavy weapons and Mirv Frags. It's so disappointing...
---
I have never sold out so I mean I would happily have some shares
---
What's this ultracite ammo you speak of, I play the game but I'm only level 53.
---
OK I hope it ! Thanks you info.
---
I got an instigating explosive +10% damage 10mm first try lol
---
Damn!
---
My camp is Max budget and not even half that size.
---
What gives!?!?!?
---
I'll never know, that's endgame endgame stuff, but it's something to aim for so that's where I'm heading. I met some level 200 and something casually 1v1ing the schorchbeast queen with that loadout and win so I'm convinced
---
Tse Tesla rifle I forget the third perk
---
I also hate the ones that require a teammate since I play solo 95% of the time.
---
For pve use whatever you feel works best for you. For pvp, optimize yourself for the play style you choose. The middle ground for any armor for any type of pvp or pve build would be anything with ap refresh aka Powered. 
---
If you are going to optimize for pvp but, want to maintain some pve viability, aim for Assassin, ap refresh, “x” gear.
---
Keep in mind that pvp has different rules for how damage works and so you will want to have damage reduction over dr. While DR and ER can help, it isn’t super noticeable unless you have damage reduction legendary, card, or mutation effects. 
---
In pvp there is no need to stack super amounts of sneak or stealth related effects, however, you can gain an advantage in pvp and pve doing this as stacking sneak enhancing effects make you invisible to practically every mob in the game the moment you crouch down. This means anyone using mobs or trying to pass mobs will get mobbed or have to deal with npcs to get to you.
---
Personally I would suggest finding a blend of assassin bolstering or assassin vanguard if you are going to be a jack of all master of none. You can even simply go for vanguard cav or vanguard sent, even the lesser used “blocker” legendary stat. But past this, your style of play and what you want to do will change. Some people don’t even use damage reduction legendaries and simply rely on cards, they do just fine.
---
Yea got sbq weapon as well Gatling two shot, crippling and steadfast.
---
Nothing super special except for good AP bonus and allows the chameleon mutation. Not saying it was the best piece in the world but for 500 caps it was a steal.
---
15. And it depends on build
---
Another issue maybe that when you play and go into a area, someone else is "to near" which will make the spawns higher level than they would be if that was not the case. So always check the map to see if someone else is in the area you are going too. Also side quest some don't seem like they are worth it, but if you really have level issue they do help with it. Lastly, events was a truly good plan as well, but remember you can go back too any place and just kill stuff, just make sure you keep the "well rested" at the very least.
---
Right, niche circumstance. And they weren't tanking for anyone. Bloodied makes tanking tough, I have seen it with multiple level 300+ friends. My level 250 heavy guns build is better for tanking than their bloodied builds.
---
Aww.
---
Poor things.
---
I'd say we'd be lucky if it was this year. Even more lucky if it wasn't absolutely bugged on release
---
it would be amazing if they made legendary power armor pieces, but they never will
---
The enemies in this game are too overpowered and the ballistic as well as energy weapons are far to weak. It forces players to have one build to get by. As a result, it limits the choices and enjoyment of the gaming experience  as a whole. I have heard many people talk about this very issue while playing the game. I wish Bethesda would listen.
---
15
---
Strength is a pretty good one to get early on, that's where a lot of damage and carry weight perks fall into. Perception and intelligence should be at least 3 if you want lockpick/hacking. Intelligence has many good crafting perks, stuff like repairing to 200%, crafting better mods, etc. Luck also has super duper, which is great for crafting ammo/chems. I would also recommend at least 5 luck if you're planning on using mutations - 2 for starched genes so you don't lose your mutations or gain unwanted ones, and 3 for class freak so the negatives don't screw you over
---
Someone did this last Saturday on the PC sender I was on. I didn't lag once. I was really impressed.
---
Vice versa -- you'll have to get the legendaries from the Purveyor then buy the mods from Modus.  The set you have?  Worthless.  (Well, you can scrap it for ballistic fibre and plastic).
---
You get 3 from Scorched Earth. The atom shop ones are sorta crap anyway.
---
i dont even play that, log in sell legendary's log out.
---
I am referencing armor mainly, and I am just talking about the base item being chosen by the player. The legendary effects would still remain as random as before with this system. So the TSE would be just as hard to get, just easier to choose the weapon type (which would change it from \~300 years to get what you want per item, to a year or so per item, see my other comment for the math)
---
What I did after this heads up.
---
I feel your pain, either a bigger budget or give the vending machine its own seperate storage budget would work too
---
Got a bloodied explosive Gatling gun and I'm pleased with it.   Also got a two shot grenade launcher that does limb damage and a quad combat rifle that does limb damage.   On the whole, the drops turned out better than I expected, I have to admit.  I put all of mine into two star raged.
---
But the mounted chicken is SO CUTE!
---
Do you have a good place to farm them, or are you just backed up with stuff from before the purveyor was added? Not sure if you'd feel comfortable with it but if you're on Xbox, I would be willing to trade them in and give you whatever it rolls, I'm not stacking legendaries that much and wouldn't mind helping someone out who reached their cap, I keep getting maxed out on vendor bot sales and know the struggle well.
---
Yea spend all my scripts got a good Gatling weapon the guy next to me got a TSE combat shot gun not sure if it was 3 or 2 star but he kept yelling about it and went on his way shooting trees and sign posts saying now he has to get shot gun ammo
---
You're allowed 51 total special points. The max is 15 per star, however you cannot max them all. They can go higher if you have gear that adds to specific tats time if you're under the influence of Chems or alcohol types.
---
As to what to max, that depends on what build you're playing as. 
---
Suggest at least 3 in Charisma for Hard Bargain, possibly 5 plus for other Charisma related perks you might want to run with.
---
Looking ahead into Luck, you'll want 3 for Starched Genes (might be 2), another 3 for Class Freak and possibly 3 more for Bloody Mess.
---
Check out Nukesanddragons.com for calculators and tools to plan your build.
---
I didn’t know it existed until I got the White Russian recipe. I finally found my first one last week.
---
Now I have 3 and I’m gonna dude it up around the wasteland for a while
---
I've never wanted to farm legendary weapons until now. Now I can finally have a chance at good gear, maybe even change my preferred weapon.
---
I’m already at max caps. But I have legendarys from both before and after.
---
I'm sure I've picked that up before but next time I'll see if picking it up again works.
---
You click the workbench
---
Farm lead from the silos, steel is everywhere - easy
---
What! They just bleed us in every way possible. Thanks for the info.
---
You got screws and ballistic fiber? I've been looking to buy a lot of them. Won't be online for another 3-4 hours though.
---
Does anyone know where a coal deposit is? None of the workshops seem to have one, and I tried photographing the coal on the walls of Gauly Mine but the camera won't register them
---
 The bears are strong. Stealth can make big difference. You are both high enough level to have at least decent stealth, you could have very good Stealth. Why, because they lose track of you easily once you have a decent amount. That and and your apparent lack of melee weapons is making your life more difficult than it might be. 
---
 I murdered the cave at level 40 or so the first time, in Combat Armour. Now its cake but I do get the max level guys for mo XP. ;)
---
But it stores so easily! 90% reduced weight
---
I got a TS fatman w/ MIRV and a TSE submachine gun which i am trying to build the prime receiver for.
---
How much luck do you have in special?
---
Yea I didn't get that mystery option ether
---
It doesn't.
---
i was hoping razorhawk was for both, i prefer it to warhawk but cant use it on my char
---
Yes but my enemy is across a stream
---
Well it's all randomized. Gonna be some shit among the roses.
---
Wooden armor was 1 star maximum since beta. Better late than never, i guess
---
Xbox?
---
ah well...at least we cleared some stash space, that's worth something :)
---
8
---
it's not related, the guy in front me had more and he got garbage rolls. nothing but batons and boards
---
They should of done that immediately after each duplication method was discovered. Unfortunately now there has been so many victims that purchased these items unknowingly. Although I'm completely for your idea and I'd sacrifice any item I have that might be duped. I think there would be such outrage at this point that more players would quit the game. I really think that if they could actually code the game so that no item could ever possibly be duped and start a ultimate survival mode where new charters must be made would save the player base that feels like we do. Those that want to continue playing with servers full of duped items could stay where they are.
---
I got a TSE railway rifle +1 AGI on my first roll then two meh robot arms.  Final roll was a 3* ghoul slayer bat with a 90% weight reduction &amp; 40% faster swing. 
---
At least the first was good.
---
 Killed a level 50 Queen with my vanilla Serrated Combat Knife a few weeks ago. ;)
---
In fo4 there are legendary pa pieces. But they are like x4 durability i think.
---
Don't feel bad, you haven't seen mine yet. I know it's awful but it's an awful location that has an aluminum source.
---
Soon I'm going to build a new one with a radiation source near by so I can start a glorious church dedicated to atom. Praise be his warm glow.
---
...so let me get this right. 
---
You went in and bought a 1 star weapon (singular) that sucked, so the entire system sucks?
---
wow.
---
We already have datamined proof that they will
---
It should at least give us like 3-5 flux of each type on kill if Beth really can't give us a garunteed 3*.
---
For this fight I start with range as far away as I can be and sneak atk it. Then run right at it, unloading as fast I can, switch to melee at point blank, so heavy hits, if for some reason its not dead, i turn and run... but for you if you have another with you they should be doing the same and it should die fast and easy. But yes its an on going thing in FO that the Bears are beast lol. As for the ML queen her poison is really "weak" in this game when compared to FO4 of the same type lol
---
We're u yelling on the mic earlier about getting TSE shotgun?
---
you killed her more times than you need
---
I just snagged a bloodied golf club with +50% limb damage and +1 STR. I would have preferred swing speed over the limb damage, but it's still a pretty solid weapon for my bloodied 2h melee guy.
---
I'm not sure if it was the Nuka cola factory or the burrows. I was in both that day.
---
There's new loot from today, scout armour with legendary effects and a bone hammer
---
Well, they put legendary .45 pipe revolvers in the mix, so who knows what else can get that now.
---
Eventually. It will probably come with another big update, like nuclear winter or the dungeon after arktos
---
Metal rules. Marine and combat are trash.
---
A TS fatman and a TSE smg as the first 2
---
You can put up to 15 points in as you level up. There’s no real limit to what you can get with buffs and gear, but the various areas that SPECIAL gives you bonuses have various degrees of diminishing returns or hard caps. Some don’t have any cap (I’m pretty sure you get 5carry weight per STR for as high as you can get your str), others have caps based on several factors (cost reduction for buying things with charisma; there’s a limit on how much you can reduce prices, so if you have 3/3 hard bargain, getting more than about 15 charisma doesn’t do anything. If you don’t have hard bargain, around 24 charisma gets you to max buy/sell.) Others just have diminishing returns- I’ve heard that str gives about 5% melee damage per point up to 15str, then like 2.5% up to like 30str, then 1.25% beyond 30. Haven’t personally confirmed that though. 
---
Raising your special through buffs/gear does not allow you to use more perk cards, but you DO get the passive benefits.
---
I've been to the legendary vendor, keep getting items which are no use to me for my build, thought I could choose weapon but not so. Wasted all my script just to sell back weapons. I have better luck farming weapons then wasting time turning in legendary items. It's easier to farm for the better weapon, the weapon you can use. Luck of the draw has odds against you. If your a bloody rifle build chances are 4 out of 5 times you'll get a weapon you don't want and loose script turning it in. Luck of the draw is basically "bad" luck.
---
Welp, that's good to know. Yet another moronic decision by bethesda.
---
If it worked my guy with 20 luck would be swimming in god roll weapons, but sadly that's not the case.
---
Good drop, don't let people tell you its not viable anymore. Just cuz it got needed doesn't make it bad, its just not the quite the king it used to be. You have fun with that drop man!
---
What’s the damage look like without the alcohol, chems, and bobblehead?
---
I had a friend so I got the swimmer one xD you just need to get stimpacked while in water, you don't have to be swimming.
---
I got four 3* crossbows.  My friends and I are going spend all weekend pretending to be the the four musketeers.  LOL. It is all RNGesus just make the best of it.  Starting on Monday I will be having big sell on crossbows.
---
I feel really fucking optimistic about logging on tomorrow  😁
---
...yeah, there are multiple posts where people are sharing some pretty decent rolls already.
---
My stealth vats sniper has 34 luck. My main HW/PA guy has 8 luck. 
---
Luck plays zero part in drops. Other than the condition they are in.
---
As long as you can take the heat, go through Sugar Grove, and the other 2 radio towers in that area, it forms a triangle on the map. Also found another place recently but haven't tested it too much so take it with a grain of salt but Bravo site, where you launch a nuke, spawns a good amount of loose screws and lead in the first area before the laser thing that seem to reload every single time I server hop, might be worth farming for simplicity.
---
How do you mean? 
---
Like all the vendors people have open are making the game more likley shutdown, kinda idea.
---
Lol no. I don’t use shotguns so I wasn’t too stoked on it tbh but it’s better than the trouble shooters harpoon gun I got!
---
Yea apparently a level 50 maxed out for damage and AP Assault rifle with maxed out damage perks and 1 star in the AP in level 50 T60 armor isn't strong enough to take down a bear.
---
Literally not even close to that and this mission keeps crashing. I died in the cave and now it crashes EVERY TIME
---
...welp, that's par for the course.
---
Got a crap 3 star for 100 scrip and sold it back for 40. What a jip
---
Thats lame i was gunna wait till it was fixed, did that with even as well.
---
I find that to be incredibly stupid. Thanks for clearing it up though.
---
Sucks man. But RNG gonna RNG. I turned in 1100 Scrip today and the best thing I got on my main was a Assassins Explosive Hunting Rifle (gg me) and on my alt my first and only two armor drops were Auto Stim Scout with AP refresh and Weapon Weight, followed by Vanguard Sentinel Marine Leg with Endurance. As braggy as it sounds, I'm trying to say, keep going, cause you never know when the RNG Gods will bless you
---
Now I want to see an evolved "gentleman radroach" with a top hat.
---
I don’t see any problem with it honestly, nice to have other players there
---
How the eff did you get yourself up to 34 luck?
---
Two shot handmade  +50 damage resistance while aiming, 25percent faster fire rate,  sell sell sell
---
Like everything else in this game, it's tied to your account, not the server.
---
Is this for the Children of Atom, The Mothman Cult, or the other Lovecraftian cults?
---
Energy don’t get any benefit from armor piercing. Gatling lasers have low base damage to begin with. So against a high-armor enemy, you’re doing low base damage with no armor piercing. They suck.
---
I usually just server hop if there isn’t a 3* in the outside perimeter mobs. Chances are there won’t be many inside. The super mutants seem to have a better drop table than GBO’s. More anti-armor and other desirable prefixes and less of the narrower ones like troubleshooter and zealots
---
I offer you my second born and 50k Bobby pins for it
---
Who hurt you?
---
“Do a shit” will always be hilarious phrasing to me
---
That's a good idea though, silver lining and all
---
Yea I use my quad Tesla don't have to reload with big mobs 60 shots
---
Vats build (15 luck) Low health build+unyielding armor (+15 luck), herd mentality (+2 luck), 2 pieces of armor with +1 luck each.
---
THANK YOU! Mods, do your fucking job and ban repetitive, useless posts like this. Why should you get the best weapon in the game when you’ve been able to kill 3 in a few hours. This is really pathetic and repetitive.
---
Not sure if it ever will it was an alternate way to join the enclave so they would have to completely rewrite it to use somewhere else
---
Damn, the Master is still mutating? That throws off my perception of time.
---
As an aside, 34 luck is where you get a crit every other shot (with appropriate perks)
---
I played my first 125 hours or so totally solo and I found levels 20-40 to be the hardest stretch. The important thing to remember is that 76 isn’t a sprint. I loved my solo play through, and even though I now team up with people often, I’d still recommend doing the entirety of the game solo if you like the story and the lore. 
---
If you want to level up quicker, take workshops, do the defense events. Stash your junk often, because eventually someone will come along and kill you, but it’s not that common. Plus, now if someone claims the workshop you can just run away. That wasn’t possible before. Those events give you plans, XP and other rewards. 
---
At level 20 you should be able to handle pretty much everything in the Forest and Toxic Valley regions. There are lots of repeatable events in those areas, do them too. 
---
You also have the player vending benefit right now too. Ammo was my hardest thing to keep enough of at that point. The nice thing now is that you can just buy it from player CAMPs. A lot of it, like .38 ammo, you’ll find in vending machines for free because not many people use it. 
---
You’ll need to make some money though. To do that, go to Grafton, Grafton Steel, the prison, or the dam. Kill the super mutants, take their guns and sell them at a train station. Same with anything else you don’t use. You can make up to 1400 caps/day selling random crap to vendors, then flip that into the ammo you need. You’ll also get a lot more XP from mutants than pretty much anything else in that region, and they drop gunpowder and caps.
---
My other passion is Gacha games. I completely understand.
---
Why did you turn in "good ones"...? This a troll or something?
---
Nuke harpers ferry
---
Eved worse
---
A spoiled meat and a spoiled milk
---
It would be nice. It won’t happen unless they start instancing interiors for player housing. The performance hit from rendering 300 clothing items at once would be immense.
---
Did my legendary rolls a few hours ago, got a vampire explosive hunting rifle. Not as good as your roll but very happy with it!
---
I just realized I didn't bat an eye at the first 3-star urban armor piece i've ever gotten.  Just thought "it's not metal or combat."
---
I think there is one in the Silos pretty consistently, right next to the first card reader on a shelf. I always tend to carry one around on me at least
---
Ivory grip is rare? I've got 2 or 3 from drops. Bought the plan originally from a vendor but it didn't show on the single action.
---
Vendor* Also no.
---
Yeah I just didn’t realize because sometimes when you open a vendor it has a bunch of items that other players have sold, like legendaries, so I thought the caps and script also worked in that same way but I was wrong.
---
It's a feature...
---
I just read that.... what were thebodds prior to this I mean seriously we were not even gaurenteed a 3☆ drop from a 3☆ enemy this is a giant improvement on the old system... I can't even imagine what the drop rates were prior to this. 
---
You also mentioned the odds of getting the exact armor you want. That's what in game trading is for you trade pieces or caps for other items. 
---
Though I will say trading needs a giant improvement. Like an actual trade window where you can offer and counter offer and caps don't need to be a requirement of the trade. We all want to trade not sell for caps if you know what I mean.
---
&gt; Also the easiest way for badges is to grind campfire tales
---
I've done it 15 times and have zero badges from it...
---
I take out SB in about 20-30 50cal bullets... :-/
---
Animal cruelty has a weird humor and oddly lore-friendly role in this game. Perk card packs have jokes like "Want to keep a cat from drowning? Take the sack out of the rivers." and "What do you call a family of geese crossing the road? Speedbumps." Not sure what that says about society in the game world.
---
I think Bethesda takes it a bit too far, especially keeping a frog like that in a cage that small (reminds me of the chickens kept in cages barely larger than their body).
---
A doggo?? 
---
Thanks for the description. Imma check that out tonight!
---
It is what triggers the quest the first time, however when they fixed the fact it wasn't repeatable they didn't remove the step where you need to read the note to "start" the quest.
---
At least that is my understanding.
---
Four 3* crossbows in a row!  Nothing great, but my team has decided we are going to pretend we are the three musketeers for the weekend.  Nuke WS and attack with crossbows!  LOL.
---
Thanks for all the replies. I really appreciate it.
---
Yep, was coming in to say something similar, would be nice of Perception actually worked at all.
---
One badge for the whole challenge.
---
I know the campfire tales event has a possibility of giving a badge.
---
People are assholes
---
A bug would arise that everytime someone looks at there shop info it add the levels together and then the camp is transported across the map AFTER taking the total amount of levels and adding it to your caps.
---
That is some terrible luck.  I feel for ya.  At least you have a place to vent here, sometimes it helps to know others have been there as well.
---
I actually remember that. Our town got an award for being the "greatest little town in America" or something like that shortly after.
---
Yes, it my Camp vendor. IGN: pokerplayt on pc
---
Prices still stand from earlier this week, but there's no mystery pack.  You've probably already seen the posts, but some items are bugged and "can't" be 3-star, but she'll sell them to you anyway, and they'll downgrade themselves when you log off.
---
Maybe folks at the cap limit burning up caps for shits and giggles?
---
A eyebot would be great.
---
Looking at your posts there's nothing heavily in the negatives, so either people have just downvoted a post because they don't have that issue, or possibly have seen similar posts previously.
---
Use 3x Rifle man cards &amp; Explosive card = GG damage even against a Scorch Beast.
---
I got an explosive combat shotgun that does 30% more damage to scorched. U had bad luck
---
I thought i would get something i could use right away... Got a lvl 50. Bummer... guess thats what everyone is getting so hold off if your a nub lvl20 like me 😞
---
I just got an AA explosive pump action with reduced vats cost... I was thrilled! then I saw..... it's a level 5 weapon.  That was a nice kick in the gut this evening. (The thing where alts get max level things didn't work in this case, word of caution to others.)
---
Got some other pretty good stuff though. I'm happy with the purveyor.
---
I grinded out 8 badges with 2 characters doing it.
---
Jump to the survival server. Im sure the line is rather short there.
---
Well I'm unlucky af
---
I'd like an AI companion specifically the Insult Bot I love that guy. He keeps it real
---
Hope we someday get companions as well. 
---
Such as animals and robots. Would be cool. Don’t know how it would affect pvp tho. Haven’t tried it much
---
I suppose it could be anything really, a responder pastor, a quacked out raider medic, a child of atom etc! Lol
---
Trust me, most people don't play as much as you appear too, and this is likely a design decision for various reasons.
---
Maybe a silly question but how do you get up to 546 damage? I have an anti armor with the prime receiver and it’s nowhere near this. Am I missing some really amazing perks?
---
I sold 4 or 5 Marsupial today as well. Made some more before I logged.
---
Yeah, you just need to climb over the piles of bodies.
---
The dude abides
---
I got a good bit of ballistic fiber I can sell, I actually just had some people show up and sold them guns for half off! I’m now the proud owner or a TSE Tesla rifle 90% reduced weight &lt;3 couldn’t be happier
---
I believe the dailies have a chance for badges too. I’ve heard 10%, 25%. It’s not high, and/or my RNG sucks, because I’ve done at least 7 campfires and 4+ each dailies and have 1 badge to show for it.
---
Can you add me. That's right around when I get off work and start playing. GT is "sweetlifeofbc"
---
Imagine a Marsupial guy bouncing like a bungee jumper and sprinting at the same time for a solid 10 seconds. That would be hell to fight.
---
Bloodied power fist with swing speed and 90% reduced weight.  Perfect would have been +1 strength, but that was still pretty good.
---
Dogs can definitely open doors if not locked.
---
Haha. Yea, didnt really think about people camping it, would be quite profitable
---
Perhaps even getting access to that claim ticket!
---
I've killed a base queen before without a problem
---
Fastest way to earn possum badges is do your 2 dailies and then farm the event by server hopping. Or activate the dailies and go do the event once to get the bug parts and then turn in the parts and go back to farming the event.
---
Its not just a retool, but some common sense would be a great start lol. In FO4 as single player it really didn't matter, so they didn't look at how dumb all the facts you just put out made the tons of weapons worthless. Yet, even the logging screens tell you misinfo, due to that HUGE error. Most of the weapon just by class should have been enough to make a better way to follow basic rules on what is more powerful. But as seen hand to hand beats, hands down... But I guess they thought if you want real weapons to make sense play a "war game"? lol My real issue with weapons is that anything other then pipe and 10mm should be rarer... based on lore that is... then maybe at least people wouldn't take Ive got crap drops so badly lol, I just look back to the old EQ days when crafted plate was uber gear and laugh when I read about how drop rates on the best stuff in the game should be higher, how about we get a dupe free, crash free and 75% of the bugs that are here from launch fixed...
---
Being a melee build strength is part of my damage so I was staying away from any that will decrease strength.
---
Consider this, it may be possible that Bethesda is not permitted to use Wild and
---
Wonderful because it is a trademark
---
Where is the purveyor located?
---
No please don't everyone would have a god roll. They just significantly reduced the odds of getting good loot and gave us a way to get guaranteed 3☆ gear we never had that. 
---
Be happy with the significant improvement to the legendary loot system. Think about how hard it was to get a 3☆ drop before today. This is a giant improvement.
---
"Not a bad roll" what do you mean 6/10 explosive is insanely lucky and a great roll.
---
Depending upon what system you're on, it's likely it's just you. I saw one nuke today. There were 2 or 3 on Monday. There were two back-to-back on Tuesday and I don't remember how many there were yesterday, Wednesday. FYI, I'm on PC
---
I would pay around 3k for PF.
---
Yeah sounds like a pretty bad bug if it happens on a God roll.
---
I'll probably just use the daily 150 scrips until it's been fixed.
---
Some is catchy. Most is not, but I'm Canadian of Scot descent from an area that loves classic rock. I have no ear for most of it.
---
Spent 500 scrip.  Got a decent 3 star furious handmade and OK instigating double barrel shotgun.  The other 3 weapons were crap.  
---
I think I now have 6 legendary handmade rifles.  So yes I like handmade rifles.
---
Same. Dont even bother now. I dont understand downvoting people who are trying to get issues fixed.
---
Get the hilariously huge heavy mod
---
 No they hit like a truck. Going toe to toe with a bear is dumb. I kill them as unfairly as possible.
---
 You need 3* in Tank Killer for sure. You are not optimized for anything much are you. ;)
---
 I used to use guns. I have better perks than you and my Instigating Lever Action still one shots all kinds of things. It hits at about 120 now, I nerfed it a tiny bit to play with automatic weapons. They are fun.
---
 My Serrated Combat Knife hits at 150- 170 odd, maybe 3 times a second. My Nocturnal 40% Speed one gets into the 250 range at night and with Adrenaline gets into the 300 range quickly. It hits maybe 4 times a sec ... until my mouse breaks. I destroy the max level Golf Club at night and walk with a load of Legendaries. I take almost no damage at all.
---
 You see where I'm going with this. I'm level 88 now and if I die in PvE ... its my fault.
---
I got a junkies powder rifle and it was crap.  3 star my ass.  I traded it right back
---
Yeah man, true story!  If I even feel like I have too much ammo, I can just burn it all up at SBQ.  LOL.  I barely pay attention to what I get from the event anymore unless I see "bloodied", anti-armor", "instigating", "unyielding", "handmade rifle", "super sledge" or "gauntlet" pop up on my screen.  I mostly just do it because it's there.
---
The player will deal increase damage and quicker health regeneration when HP becomes low.
---
But the side effect reduces your Max Hp by 50.
---
Remember it's best to shoot a ferasl in the mouth or eyes with a crossbow.
---
Not even grinders. But Fallout 76 can be had so cheaply I had a friend who bought a second account just to offload all his legendaries on. He farms West-Tek constantly, and gets tons of legendaries just from those runs.
---
It's gonna be like that 99% of the time. There's just so much crap in the legendary loot pool. But i am pumped that this supercharges 3 star legendaries coming into the game. So often I'll only fins 1 or 2 3 star enemies a day and they usually frop 1 or 2 star stuff
---
This could work if they ever end all signs of PvP in Adventure and then restrict the companions to Adventure. Only issue is there better not be collisions. I'm not gonna be stuffed in a hallway with 3 other teammates and 4 robots.
---
Yeah. I’ll do caps runs and I know what I kill and where every time. Then today there were half as many scorched at Poseidon and one day last week it was swarming.
---

What you do is you come on here and you find one of the 100+ posts where people are going "I NEED HELP WITH THE TADPOLE CHALLENGE", make sure they're playing on your platform, and team up.
---
The game is still full price in thr UK!
---
It's the first day keep trying you'll hopefully get something good or at least something you can trade for what you want.

Found 27 stable flux in a cigarette machine yesterday
---
Recommended level for the burrows? Pretty new to the Game but level 15.
---
I mean, I haven't seen any god rolls. I've seen some pretty decent rolls, but no BIS items.
---
A nice shotgun. Got anything?
---
That’s why I didn’t say anything about those. Done them every day but no luck so I wasn’t sure. The event has netted me two though.
---
 I was just experimenting. The 3 -4 max level Gulpers at the Train Yard near Watoga are my DPS test. ;)

Out of 15 pulls i got a BE/per combat shotgun
---
I'm with a group that sometimes launches half a dozen nukes a night. In the last silo room, lately, we've had nothing spawn. Maybe a whole robot during that entire segment.
---
And then other times we've had over a dozen Colonel Gutsies spawn all at the same time, and it's been a nightmare trying to fight back. Spawns are strangely broken and all over the place.
---
I knew this would be a possibility. It's no different as just killing a legendary, minus a guarentee of a three star. Still could be an absolute crap three star. But interesting concept I guess. I honestly think just selling the unwanted ones for caps then just buying them from FB or reddit is better than the script
---
You open a support ticket and/or post on their forum
---
You could provided us with a link (or links) so we could know which posts you’re talking about. I would downvote if you complained about a bug (that 10 others before you had posted and complained about). That’s different from REPORTING a bug. A report does not include personal comments like “we have had this bug since release, why can’t you get anything right Bugthesda!” Because as soon as you make a comment like that, it stops being a bug report. Also, general process is to report the bug to Bethesda through the channels they have made available to people. If you post it here (especially with a “Dear Bethsda”) you are making the assumption that your report (or complaint) of a bug will take priority because somehow Todd&amp;Co lurk here and are extremely sensitive to what Redditors have to say. 
---
Yes, Reddit may be an ochlocracy with its brigading hordes, but it’s not the center of the universe. Therefore, I think you should chill and not take those downvotes personal. Why do you care? Did you go hungry? Did you lose your job? Did someone close to you die? Did it exile you to an unknown land? Only thing that suffered was your ego. I predict that you will have more postings downvoted to oblivion, until you get that ego in check. This will hopefully also preemptively answer all the posts you will make in the future about being triggered by downvotes.
---
What stats specifically? If you mean their level they're all max.
---
Furious explosive double barrel
---
Todd doesn't give a flying f***
---
Nukagrenade is where it’s at
---
Do you use the Tormentor luck perk? Rank 3 gives you a 15% chance to cripple a limb with any rifle hits (auto or single shot).
---
As a stealth sniper I go for a wing to ground her, then from there to be safe I go for the other wing or head to prevent sonic attacks, then limbs to prevent her from moving on the ground.
---
Not doing a whole lot of damage but you'll have her sitting there unable to do anything. That's when even low levels can start sinking hits in.
---
Of course as a legendary she'll regen at some point, but just repeat the whole process.
---
3 good ass duped weapons. I'm assuming they were duped because it was right before they first started banning ppl and all three were explosive.
---
Found a bunch of inert flux once, like 250, which was awesome because I had nothing to drink and I have rank 3 of Lead belly (take no rads from food/water)
---
I am level 35 and I have only ever found about 5 legendaries, and they were all 1 star. 
---
And in fact now that I think about it, I haven't seen a legendary in ... 15 levels? 20? 
---
I wander the map to discover places, and follow quest markers, that is apparently not the right way to get legendaries.
---
900 shotgun shells. That saved some crafting.
---
&gt;No they hit like a truck.
---
They hit harder then literally every non legendary enemy in the game. Including the Scorch Beast Queen.  
---
&gt; You need 3\* in Tank Killer for sure. You are not optimized for anything much are you. ;) 
---
The fact I need 3 star tank killer perk just to take on a non legendary and non boss bear when it is less needed for even boss content shows some serious unbalance in the game.
---
My bloodied Bowie that I love dearly. Thanks stranger!
---
Nope. You can buy sold items, but that doesn't affect the vendors cap stock, plans, etc.
---
First roll.....furious Gatling plasma, +10 damage while aiming, 90% reduced weight, 
---
Second roll......2* medics handmade exploding
---
Good roll on the Gatling plasma?
---
Broadsider has a magazine mod, so it could take advantage of faster fire rate.
---
Looks like Speed Demon will be my next one to purchase. Thanks for all the great discussion / suggestions. 
---
I was thinking of Chameleon for my self I would like to do some pvp but I really suck at it and don’t really have the weapons to do it.  For as much complaining about 2 shot explosive weapons getting nerfed that is usually what I get killed with.
---
Obvious troll is obvious
---
Honestly are they ever going to release an update that isn't inherently bugged
---
Are all your characters at or above 50? Do you know whether you'll get a none max level item with a low level character?
---
Sadly Shovels can't get legendaries. If you want to be a workerman though there are legendary pickaxes and drills.
---
With all the perks (9 in shotguns, 5 in demo expert, 3 in Enforcer, and 3 in bloody mess), my 2* tse Combat shotty cripples anything but sb or SBQ within the first two shots. The PA has a way smaller pattern. If you have the extra perk points, add Skeet Shooter for a tighter grouping. The PA seems to be the most accurate, but its reload time sucks.
---
Where did you hear that? When you go in the presidential wing nothing points to it.
---
Yes they can. I have one right now that I got from the Legendary vendor :) it’s instigating 3 star so ^^
---
I enjoyed this reference.
---
I don’t really play in a group but it would be useful for the encrypted event. Don’t see the event all that often these days and I have been saving caps for serums.
---
That's the tunnel she uses to get around the map. She is a mole miner after all.
---
Does level of toon affect the level from Purveyor? I was afraid to let my mules cash in legendaries.
---
Most retail stores still have it at retail, but there's plenty of trusted key resellers where you can get keys far cheaper.
---
Any gun that's explosive will sell. Literally any gun.
---
Idk why you got downvoted but I know the +25 rad resist (your previous post) has been broken since launch. Most of us are aware but I'm not sure if that's why you got downvoted or not.
---
And yes they should fix it but who knows where this is on thier priority list. So many other problems rn.
---
A vampires explosive pipe pistol. Good rolls, bad gun.
---
An Executioners Fire Axe which I renamed “We Didn’t Start The Fire” and still use so far.
---
And they never even have the decency to close the door behind them. Clearly all radroaches were born in barns.
---
You need to swap servers until you find a "generous" one.  It's not universal, as I can run with my pals around the Whitespring and while I may have run around the whole place and gotten 2-3 legendary items, they might spawn piles of one star drops from ghouls that just say "diseased" and we all get legendary loot if we hit them.
---
If you're looking to go through the effort of launching a nuke, hit up a secondary location like West-Tek or the Burrows first.  If you walk away with a lot of one-star gear, use that server to send your nuke.  If you walk away with only 1-2 pieces, hop until you find a more lucrative server.  It usually only takes me 1-2 tries.
---
I feel like there's always a similar amount of enemies with actual stars, but the ones that show up as diseased tend to drop one-star gear on certain servers.
---
Actually it is probably for the best to include everything. I'd love for an excuse to roll with a shovel or pickaxe in my loadout.
---
I feel like it's a similar situation to all of the Caps Stashes spawning on a Server as some servers have less than half that can show up on any given day.
---
I too have come across 'Lucky Servers' and when I do I fully explore them on foot for best results!
---
Here's what I've noticed in the past few days. It used to be that the lingering after effects from dropping a nuke, like on White Springs, wood result in their continuing to be glowing ones even after the effects of the nuke has cleared. In some cases, glowing ones would respawn six to seven hours after the nuke effects have passed. I notice this week, after three or maybe four nukes on White Springs, the server shutdown for maintenance Within half an hour to an hour of the nukes effects having dissipated. I believe this is intended from Bethesda to limit the amount of time the players have 2 farm for legendaries.
---
Perhaps part of their genetic mutation has given them velociraptor powers.
---
Lots of reasons. Sometimes you put code in test environment. Find out it doesn't work, but it's test so nbd, and then one day broken code gets released to production. Also, test environments are not always 100% identical to prod environments so a piece of code may not behave the same way in prod as it did in test. Usually testers are seperate teams, often testing code gets sent to a QA team. Don't forget, not all the devs are working on the same thing. Sometimes pieces don't play well with each other, etc. A lot can go wrong. "Why didn't anyone notice in test" question is valid though. Maybe it had no issue in test environment? Maybe there were tons of other problems, this was delayed after all, and this one went unnoticed due to a lot of other issues and now it's in prod, unfortunately.
---
That's awesome. Congratulations.
---
You had me at first.
---
Please take these coins so i may paas this bridge and be on my way.
---
Have literally 100ish plans in my camp vending
---
It's just an ultracite version of the ammo type and does more damage. When you learn the plan for a prime receiver for a gun you learn the respective ultracite round recipe. Usually requires flux and ultracite (obviously).
---
No. No bug reports, no criticism, no this is what they should do posts. Fallout 76 is the greatest game ever created a template for all future games, any bugs are intentional and pointing these "flaws" out makes you look petty. Now let me scan your comment for grammatical errors before i tell you to get good or go play something else.

no even aae shotgun is not worth .... my be hanmade and lever dose more dmg .....have 2 shotgun with more 400 dmg with all shotgun perk its take 2 hits to kill lvl 50 bot forget his name.. and take 4 hits to kill lvl 68 super mu.... 
---
they really need to fix shotgun cos its the weakest weapon right now everything is stronger
---
Trading might work, but as mentioned most weapon and armor types just aren't viable (like wood in general, leather until energy is better, raider in general, lead pipes, lasers, railgun, etc) which still makes it a problem. Plus while, yes, it is an improvement, it's still far from workable. The mod item simply makes the RNG more workable and a realistic goal people can work towards. Not being able to see a task as realistic pushes players away from trying. Plus I would like to take cosmetics off sometime and have my matching armor show instead of hodgepodge armor.

I think the railway rifle guarantees a spike drop when you kill something with it, so its pretty easy to manage your ammo which is a huge benefit along with the high dps.
---
Got a zealot explosive mini gun
---
Something something... Evolution... Velociraptors....
---
Still need help?
---
I'd totally call that pistol Hollywood Shootout.  Ridiculous time between reloads and things explode when you shoot them.
---
Today there was no patch and i run bloodied and dont see a diff, so I dont think its bugged again
---
First was a shotgun with faster reload, no two shot, no explosive, no big deal. Just traded it back and farmed more legendary so I could try again. Second attempt was a bloodied fatman. Used it at Whitesprings and farmed a switchblade 3* that is actually really good, lol. I had fun today! I have enough to go back and roll the dice again and I can’t wait. You all do realize it is a game and playing games is fun, right?
---
&gt;Yes, Reddit may be an ochlocracy with its brigading hordes
---
Ha this is so true lol... um yeah I also totally didn't have to look up Ochlocracy I totally knew what this meant... 🤓
---
Are you still needing caps?
---
Agreed, glad it cleared up your confusion. I wasn't sure if that's what you were asking but since I was confused by it for awhile myself, I tried reading outside of the lines a bit.
---
Early in my first play through I was doing the  Fasnacht event and someone had dropped 12,000 rounds of .38 in the middle of the road. That carried me so far that I never used it all.
---
That was me I'm not a dev
---
Thats very true. At least we know we will get a 3 star item....unless its wood armor or an assaultron head.
---
I was in the middle of Uranium Fever a while back by myself and killed one mole miner and one supervisor before a second person showed up.  All of a sudden the place was swimming in Mole Miners.  Like 5-6 to an extractor.  I've got an AA/E handmade rifle and maxed out rifleman perks, and I was running around like a headless chicken trying to kill everything, while still being aware enough to not kill the two remaining supervisors by accident.

Nobody will quit just because their counterfeit toy gets removed. It's an excuse being constantly used by dupers and their buddies. New servers won't do anything because dupers will surely ruin it just like this current mess.
---
If removing past duped items is technically impossible to Bethesda (sure looks that way), then lock them to current users, so that future legendaries will either come from loot or from the purveyor. That will make the game so much cleaner and also the purveyor will be hugely popular. They can lock the scrips to its owners, surely they can do it to items as well. Dropping will destroy legendary just like stuff bought from atom store.
---
 That's right. Well done, the bears are OP&gt; ;) is that the first one you tangled with? They surprise a lot of people.
---
 If you don't have all the AP for Rifles you can get, you are not playing the game well. You can't expect to dominate the game without doing your homework.
---
 The fact that you are upset is a bit disturbing.
---
got my gun but now I’m broke! Stop on by lol, someone nuked half of my camp but luckily the vending machines are a no rads zone xD
---
I've literally seen almost 20 miners spawn in the room at the far end before. The entire round spawned everything at once, *and all in one room*.
---
I've never had more fun with an explosive gatling in my life.
---
Over that?
---
I mean, seriously, that is what is going to push you over the edge?
---
I don't think the bone hammer is new (might have misread that), but the new legendary effect certainly is.
---
However, I think the 'ad' was talking about the new area.  I'd have to take another look to be sure.
---
But do you have adrenal reaction?
---
idk.  ive done 15-20 campfire tales and 4 dailies and nothing for me at all.
---
I personally interpreted it as him just being a condescending douche and not actually giving a shit what your rank is, he just wants to make digs at you for being a full grown adult in a scout troop.
---
Part of the rolling restarts to help world stability or patching?
---
I'll take it from you if you want to get rid of it. IGN pokerplayr on PC
---
Dam that sucks I'd help fix it but I got a ban and can't join any teams right now I'm glad you got your gun tho and I'll definitely try to stop by when I get on
---

I went for melee weapons and got a rolling pin, 2 boxing gloves, a revolutionary sword, a shovel, a pitchfork, a golf club, and a war drum. The war drum was the only one of the bunch that wasn't completely useless.
---
It's the dirty dupers that made them limit that. Cheaters fucked the game for the rest of us.
---
Enemies can attack from waayy outside your camp circle!
---
Well, that's not very neighborly.
---
Can you say "I want a nice backpack"?
---
I thought you could.
---
Do you have adrenal reaction?
---
That and specific like damage, weight, range, etc. I just don't know that stuff off hand and it's hard to look up for some weapons since level varies that stuff.
---
Bloodied explosive laser rifle was the number one most duped weapon this time around. Hands down.
---
You turn off the radio?
---
Major L
---
Get a lever action and hip fire them from the air.
---
I feel like if we’re going to get any it’ll be most likely to come with the Wastelanders updates, because those sound as though they’re the most likely to change the game in a radical way
---
The three I was using were all over 50 ... 110, 160, 160 I think. All were max level.
---
"the fight causes me to use so much supplies, I demand that it drop me a guaranteed 5* legendary every time I kill it, and that's 6 times a day."
---
If it's really such a drain on your supplies just stop fighting it ffs. It's not rocket science. If you want 3* weapons farm the 3* enemy spots like the rest of us.
---
Server hop.  Some servers seem to have a "no soup for you!" policy.  I once ran around a Whitespring Nuke, killed all the ghouls and came home with one two star single action revolver, and it wasn't even good.
---
So you can get low level gear or no?
---
Didn't know the dailys gave you badges. Do they both just give you possum badges when you become possum level or does one give you tadpole badges?
---
Yes, these legendaries were supposed to do wonders for the low availability of good and undupped legendaries in the PC market. I have very little reason to play at this point besides getting new/ the best legendary gear. I have done nearly everything, and I've done it all legit.
---
Hmm thats interesting thanks for that info.
---
Kinda sucks tho cause i like to build and that wont help if people launch nukes which is all the time.
