Maybe when I actually see one.
---
---
---
Zippy can get it
---
How boring that has to be :(
---
It’s literally not pay to win. The items for sale BARELY give an advantage, if they even do at all. They are practically decorations. They aren’t ruining the game. Even if they were giving an advantage, you earn atom by playing the game, so you can still get them
---
Don't you mean four?
---
It's not effected by heavy weapons anymore. Just demolition. I don't think stabilize works with it either.
---
you got me
---
They most likely won’t unfortunately, what was the bug just curious
---
What bug? What happened?
---
The effects do stack, but it's diminishing returns. They don't add together 45+50= 95%. It's more like 45%, then 50% of the 55% that's left. I also don't know which is factored in first but it'll be close either way
---
Eh, its fun finding new hiding spots.
---
They are all useless lol. Which utility items exactly do you want?
---
Or you can look at the item on yourself. They all look pretty distinctly different. But yeah, this has been this way since Fallout 4. Very annoying.
---
Would not count on it.  You’ll get the canned message we all get that they don’t have the tools to return lost items.  Best of luck.
---
That's been my guess too - that for shotguns, it's a kind of per-tick damage limitation that was intended for PvP but somehow found its way into PvE.  I'm sure latency plays a role too - since you can get this to happen even with the Gatling Gun on a sufficiently decayed server, but the HP rebound on shotguns is far too consistent in its application to be purely an accident, imo.
---
Not to mention I leave my robot unlocked so he really is there for everyone. I don’t even empty the container lol
---
Bruh what do you mean you don't want to pay $25 for a bundle of recycled fo4 assets and a staircase that doesn't clip to anything? How can you not want to spend $5 on a recolor of a weapon nobody uses?
---
If they are tagged then its apparent when they say nothing and not that they just didnt see the thread.
---
See I think this is where it's a little tricky. Bethesda may have sold more. But you buy them in packs and they are at a much lower price than other items.
---

---
If a very cool power armor drops and alot of people (not all) buy it from the atomic shop at 1800 atoms. Then you have are large amount of people buy it a pack of repair kits is like 3-400? And you get 5 (not sure the exact amount/price).
---
Then it means for each pack, they could record it as 5 sales of the 1 item. Not to mention people returning to buy it again.
---
This doesn't mean that people necessarily want/request it more so than other items, but Bethesda can spin that way and they want to for 2 reasons.
---
1. Pay to advantage/convenience items like this can be created once and continually sold. Where as people may like a beautiful power armor more. You spend alot of time to do the design and coding for it to be bought buy people once. But these scrap/repair kits can be bought again and again. This is in Bethesda's interest, not that of the regular consumer.
---
2. It paves the way for them to add more items with advantage/use that could've added as new content to the game. Fridges and robots are cut content from the game. And now we'll see things like bullet conversion, etc. Added into the atomic rather than an interesting questline that leads to a worthwhile reward such as the backpack.
---
Seems like it would be huh
---
That's what I meant with not being surprised at poor sales based on what styles they have offered.
---
Sorry for the long comment. Only realised how long it was after
---
Realistically? I mean, how much of this game is realistic in the first place?
---
They've added content, the quality is hit and miss. If you're a solo player then duping and cheating won't affect you much. Just be wary around workshops.
---
I remember making a list of over a hundred weapon-related bugs a few months ago (most of which still aren't fixed btw lmao) and included a list of weapons that serve absolutely no purpose in the game in their current state. They released a skin for the alien blaster without bothering to make it viable or fix the delayed invisible projectiles it shoots. If you use an adrenal reaction pistoleer build, you can sort of get through the forest with minimal difficulties. It's almost a year after launch, they can't leave so much useless garbage here pretending it's content. The black powder blunderbuss is a direct downgrade from the black powder pistol, can't be legendary, and is not even a blunderbuss. Just a pistol with short range. All automatic melee weapons are still useless. Syringer is still worthless AND I'm pretty sure the endangerol barrel still gives enemies armor penetration to their attacks instead of lowering their defense
---
I think it’s a problem with reddit, as I’m not recieving a message...
---
I would think twice about a meat hook and consider opting for a gauntlet or power fist, as their base damage (if you get the right one) is already considerable. Unarmed is great as you only need 3 special points to maximize its damage (in Iron Fist) instead of the 9 (across 3 cards) to maximize one and two handed. I have an instigating power fist with 40% power attack damage which, together with sneak, can output serious damage per hit. One shots a higher level deathclaw. For non sneak scenarios, I have an instigating mole miner gauntlet with 40% swing speed and it is sooo fast and lethal. It cuts through mobs like butter. Great for SBQ. I have tried all 3 melee types and unarmed just feels like you get more for your money in terms of perks. My alt sneak rifle build is nowhere near as capable.
---
Not to be an idiot, but what machines are we talking about?
---
If it's the crane game, I never even attempt them.
---
NCR Ranger outfit. Thats all im gunna say
---
That'd be an awesome surprise for sure
---
Yea, it's worth it just for exploring and messing around. I play a similar style to you and got back in at beginning of summer.
---
If you play on ps4 let me know I get on about once or twice a week to just fool around and am always down for company when driving into a cave.
---
I still do this, and doesn't make infinite.
---
Happy Fallout Day!
---
Where do you get Halloween decor? Atom shop?
---
15$ per month. No joke.
---
Then this weapon needs a hell of a buff then. Because if Stabilized dosent work with it (which is the best perk of HW in my opinion). Then theres no point in using it.
---
Lol Atom bless them for their never ending replys with that same link blaming us for crashing 🤣😂🤣
---
Halloween cosmetics &gt; fixing real issues
---
lmaaooooooooo you’re not off. It’s gonna be 15$ per month and can only hold 7 people
---
It wasn't any of them. It's Zenimax Studios, that owns Bethesda. They are corporate part pulling the strings to make over-riding decisions for corporate gain.
---
It's not good for fallout 76, but it is for Bethesda Games studio's future. It means that hopefully more finances will be put towards starfield and the new elder scrolls.
---
I don’t use frog legs but I do sneak and hide. Take your time. There are a few good drop zones outside of Morgantown that hve good loot, test out and find a place where other tend not to drop. I find it best to avoid people at the beginning. Also, strip down to your underwear at the beginning. This will actually make it easier to blend into the environment. 
---
If you get a chance to hack a terminal and no one is around, do it! You can get some high powered weapons. 
---
Another fun tactic is to build a quick portable base in adventure mode and the blueprint so you can plop down easily in NW. also, hiding in portapotties is underrated.
---
Proof?
---
It’s not boring at all! Hiding and having a decked out 4-man squad walk by you while you are naked holding only a hatchet is exhilarating. Lol
---
Lol Todd never left the vault 💋💋💋
---
Holy shit. Really? Or are you just trolling?
---
Great tip right here.
---
You get more exp from killing people than you do for surviving, or at least so I've heard. Worry less about getting killed some matches and just jump right into things in the middle of Morgantown
---
Absolute first thing; **use a mic**, and find people to play with. This mode is so much more fun with people. 
---
Stealth for overseer XP is a valid strategy, so is camp building, but these strategies do *not* give the same rewards that running&amp;gunning does. You get Adv XP and caps based on your performance in NW, kill absolutely everything, and you can easily net 300-500 caps per match. My NW character has made 110 levels, and 40k+ caps, without ever playing in Adv..
---
Focus on one weapon class, and build around that; tank killer and master commando will win you more 1v1's than frog legs. Make use of chems, I run Pharma farma just for the Med-x and bufftats. Keep med-x up at all times for the +50dr, bufftats for tense engagements for the dmg boost. I prefer automatics, just for the dps, low weights, and variety.  Blue crates drop combat rifle, which IMO, is one of the best guns in the game; 20 round mag, **491** range, 60+ dmg perked out, and the smallest spread/reticle of any of the rifles.
---
Utility perks are ok, but I wouldn ever run with mote than 1.
---
European community manager was talking about it on discord, then deleted the messages
---
I don't mind the complaining, people are entitled to their opinions, but the spamming of multiple posts with the same complaint is just... unnecessary, and very detrimental to the subreddit.
---
I really hope so. It will give me a reason to actually keep logging on
---
:) To each his own.
---
It wouldn't be nearly as exhilarating as hunting and wiping that team would be for me.
---
[removed]
---
Fair enough. Generally more of a function over form type myself.
---
Try it some time. Better yet. Drop down 50 porta-potties and hide in one crouching. Go in photo mode and watch as people walk by, start opening random ones to look for you, or even story to open fire. Will you survive? Maybe. Will you be laughing and having fun? Yes.  Get your whole squad to join!
---
You're welcome to your truth, but like some others you're missing the point and the bigger picture. If i'm a fringe case why are so many agreeing with me, why all the similar stories, why all the upvotes, are they all wrong too? Player numbers are down, content that should have been better prepared and was billed as the big end of year addition is nowhere near ready, the game is stagnating and players are reporting that they're struggling to find things to do. I love this game and it's sad to see this happening, but you keep labeling people and rattling your cage, that'll help.
---
I think so. Now do I want more? Of course I do and of course we all do but let's face it, were getting a bare bones mode single player mode disguised as a "private server"
---
With the right perks they are. With scoped lever action, you can take anyone out in 2 shots, 1 if to the head. I run a commando/rifleman combo. Auto when in close combat, rifle when long range or haven't been seen. You wait for someone to loot a crate, BAM. Taken down from far far away.
---
The scenario bis the most important part.
---
Todd's like, "goddammit, just bring me out for the single player games."
---
I will be in about 10-20 minutes. Putting the family to bed.
---
Lol. I tried when I first started. I can't sit still anywhere long enough to hide effectively. As soon as I hear footsteps or gunfire, I immediately make a bee line.
---
Helped my son launch his first nuke on Sunday it took us about 15 minutes just for the game to register that we removed, repaired and replaced the mainframe cores. 
---
Without that lag we would've been about 20 mins for a launch. 
---
It's freaking ridiculous.
---
LOL I was standing IN the launch control room and they expired on me
---
RIP Hubert ... may we forget your greatness very very slowly
---
So I have used the DC gauntlet for melee but I am a big gun build. I have not put points into anything melee. Before I do, to make sure I am understanding correctly, I should put into unarmed for the DC and not melee?
---
Biggest things that come to mind are:
---
Nuclear winter battle royale mode
---
Nukashine quest / brewing (read party poster in train station)
---
Sheepsquatch quest (read poster in train station)
---
Pioneer scouts/backpack (read poster in train station)
---
Player vending
---
Game also runs so much more stable for me. I used to disconnect frequently. Now I don’t remember the last time I got booted. Xbox.
---
True but you still have the clipping issues unless they did something like when you wore a hat it would be tucked in or something to not make it clip idk
---
AGREED! I changed some of my special in adventure to choose perks in nuclear winter, but there's more I'd like to do, but not change my adventure game THAT much.
---
Current doesn't glow
---
I want a Nuka Breaker super sledge skin.
---
Try your hardest not to move lol
---
Swapping PA pieces between two frames without leaving one of them causes the parts you swapped between them to disappear shortly after
---
I brought this up with a friend earlier today. Not only have the 40 atom weekly's been removed, 20 atom weekly's seem to be the norm. We've also lost casual dailies, with only three being available to be accomplished with normal play, and two more being vault 51 or winter related. Some with with the weekly, losing one slot to a 51 challenge that doesn't always even reward atom.
---
How do you pull up two frames at the same
---
Time!
---
I find my way into every bush I can. I stay in that bush, ground pound perk is strong on that bush. When I leave that bush it is soaked in my blood cause I'm fucked, dead in a bush I shouldn't have been in. Found by a 4 man squad not worried how flexible I am.
---
They're not deaf, it's purposeful.
---
Player: Hello Wendigo I'm going into battle, and I want your strongest chems. 
---
&amp;#x200B;

Wendigo: My chems are too strong for you Vault Dweller.

I just bought the fridge for the look of the thing. The one time I put food in it it went off anyway cause I forgot about it. But it does look magnificent slowly rusting out on my lawn in front of my house. Now if only I could get a broken car to go with it and I’d have the perfect West Virginia yard!
---
Supposing that I do drop Traveling pharmacy and then use barbarian, how many stimpaks do I need to carry on my character?
---
Yeah, its very possible and very feasable. Its a good thing that has no reason to not be implemented except for money.
---
WINNIE THE POOH WANTS YOUR LOCATION

The same way you would normally place one just be in a suit already before you place the second one
---
I like all of this! Can't be a junky without diseased syringes, I always say
---
 [https://akarnokd.github.io/rng-76/weapons.html](https://akarnokd.github.io/rng-76/weapons.html) 
---
This can help you figure some of it out.
---
Yeah that would cost money though and duping does'nt really directly affect the bottom line maybe they might lose a couple of players but I'm going to assume that retaining people who will quit over something like that might not be there highest goal (going whaling, however  . . .)
---
It would if everytime you bought something from a vendor his caps stash would replenish by whatever you paid for the item
---
After 2 jumps it's basically normal height and they need to wait like 5-6 seconds before it works again. It means already after the first jump, the second jump is low enough for you to be able to track them in the air.
---
I use frogs legs, but It's basically now just for moving to be better vantage points.
---
I agree that it was blight on the game, it needed to be nerfed and it's much much better now.
---
Well yeah. They replenish somewhat, but the loss is high
---
Bosses probably want fo76 to be more self sufficient. Which means micro transaction to keep the lights on
---
I feel you are somewhat lucky my last real friend quit 6 months ago and my online friends list has gone to zero online about two weeks ago. Really starting to feel like the Wasteland out there. Sighhhhhhh!
---
Ok I’ll be on in a min I might have to update the game tho
---
I’ve noticed the dailies occasionally go missing, we used to earn a total of 60 atoms from dailies, now it’s usually 50.. 
---
I initially put it down to bring a glitch, but I no longer think that is the case..
---
But losing the 40 atom weekly challenge is a bit of a slap in the face from Bethesda IMHO
---
[deleted]
---
We were notified by BGS I think last week or the week before that the next update would be 10/23
---
I REALLY hope so, the VTU stuff was an amazing incentive to play Nuclear Winter again. I don’t even use most of it in my camp, it was just a good feeling to unlock the stuff!
---
Isnt the whole point of private servers for moding?
---
I'd normally earn 250 a week through daily casual play with a friend. I'll finish 3 weekly challenges and a couple dailies tonight and walk away with 100 atom. I doubt I'll earn another 100 through dailies this week.
---
I was thinking the same thing myself about the weekly.
---
The dailies have always fluctuated but even more so lately and to the low end.  I will say the dailies in general haven’t been too bad, though as I don’t do the raid it’s usually a write-off most days with those atoms.
---
Maybe they took out the hunter hunted weekly and forgot to fill the spot.  That and having bugged ones pop up may as well be an empty spot anywho.
---
nah events fix is today my man
---
I've got an idea, why dont they make an even where a whole bunch of nukes are going to drop killing anything that doesn't make it to shelter (vault, bunker, etc.), and once the nukes hit and most of the populace is dead the remaining people fight off each other
---
If that's what you want, sure.
---
They have mentioned the possibility of 'mods' at some point in the future.  No clue what they mean by that.  Maybe nexus type mods, maybe mods they sell themselves, and it may or may not happen.
---
Cst

I guess we'll see something eventually?
---
I believe the chance of getting anything good to me microscopic if there was a chance of a vendor spawning with up to 3 legendary weapons or armor, but cheap scrip would be able to be acquired easily. What is the difference between a ignorant player selling legendaries cheap and a robot vendor selling legendaries cheap?
---
It would also act as a much-needed cap sink
---
I asked for more utility items. Come at me.
---
Yup, PC :( One of the times I wish I could play on XB.
---
Is server hopping the asylum all you've been doing the past two days? Objects spawning is related to how many items you've picked up. You have to pick up a certain quantity of items for other items to spawn again. If you have been doing minimal looting that could be why.
---
Yup! That's the pic
---
Wait til the canner or ammo converter is atom shop only.    Pay to win or pay for convenience?
---
Now imagine you could put it out for all to use.  Does that change anything?  I’d say so.
---
If you pick up from a spot you wont have a spawn there for 24 hours
---
I've had this happen quite a few times in recent months.  Its totally a waste of time but i usually stay kill the waves of enemies and get the completion for xp.
---
I've freaked people out by dropping a mothman statue outside a window before, other times i popped them in the ass from the same window and watched them panic, thats 20% of what i do in my one hiding spot, the other 80% is youtube.
---
Never seen the dcg from 3, just checked and it now after seeing your comment. Holy shit! I don't even use a dcg, but I would buy that skin anyway.
---
A big issue me personally saw is the quake con deal where they where talking about nuclear winter and wastelanders and potential new updates the older guys who where obvious players and I have seen multiple times at least 2 of them multiple times in other conference vids and stuff where answering to a young individual who straight up said no I don't play the game much and hate nuclear winter but all updates go through them they have final say this is a huge disconnect for bethesda why would you put someone who doesn't understand the game in control of the game or understand there player base or enjoy the game in control of the goings of the game and above all else for goodness sake at least give the people who play relentlessly in your studios some say in the goings of your games and the guys actually talking in depth and seemed to know more about the update and everything else where holding back saying things unless they got a nod from the individual over the game like wtf guys
---
Good advice!  Thanks! Any Reccomendations for mods on the combat and pump?  .  I have 2 great combat and 1 great pump (at least on paper) that I'm itching to try.  I started as a shotgunner, but the platic demand early on made it not worth it so I eased into a heavy gunner. It'll be fun to be a shotgunner again!
---
Here's what I got:
---
Combat:
---
AA, +250 dam resitance reloading, +10% damage while aiming (50 lvl)
---
AA,  +10% damage while aiming, +1 Perception (50 lvl)
---
Pump:
---
Mutants Slayer's, 25% faster fire, VATS critial meter 15% faster (only lvl 45)
---
Sounds like these would do well at West Tek.
---
&gt;Youll be able to mod servers
---
Not for the foreseeable future.
---
Im fine with it taking up weight, i just wish it didnt take up so much camp budget. Do i wanna display all my magazines and bobble-heads, or have 4 extra turrets as defense? It feels a bit high.
---
Maxed out Fireproof perk makes them little more than an irritant.  I’d rather face one or more of them than a Yao Guai any day.
---
I recently heard something about cross play coming at some point in the future. Not sure if it was true or not but the guy said he had someone he knew at Bethesda that confirmed it. Who knows though but it would be nice being able to trade with a bigger community.
---
The guy fighting both a SB and the Sheepsquatch has balls.
---
I completely agree with the OP as well. I just have a strong feeling of how things are going behind the scenes thanks to a long background in software development. The developers do what their management tells them to do. Right now management is telling them to get the wastelanders update out yesterday. Any deviation of focus from that is not going to be allowed.
---
I automatically assumed when the decorating came about we would be able to do this ....guess that's what i get for assuming
---
That’s awesome! Enjoy time with your brother my man. May the SBQ’s be plenty, and your bone worms be few!
---
I want the sloth omg..
---
I really like this. Im never gonna use any of the bobble heads or magazines i have now, so to be able to make them a permanent cosmetics-only item to free up stash space would be great.
---
I genuinely didnt realize you needed to lock the robot
---
Not that i’m going to. If people want my spare scrap they’re welcome to whatever Fisto finds.
---
Well that's cheap, considering it's from official store. 
---
&gt;...now if they just release the private server info
---
https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/article/6eNqXDms6VbtrHubE26y4r/new-wastelanders-release-date-private-worlds-the-atomic-shop-and-more
---
So the info is there and it launches tomorrow. You want more detailed info, you got to wait for patch notes.
---
Where'd you see it was 15?
---
4X as much
---
Standing next to the computer with the same problem 😆☠️
---
Weird. I use the hunting rifle with scope a lot, as binoculars really, and I don’t think I’ve had this issue before. Will try to recreate when I get home.
---
I think sometimes people forget this game is a survival RPG . I'm only level 30 and the adrenaline rush I get from running from shit is more fun then busting out an OP legendary weapon and easily mowing down enemies. The first time I saw a scorched beast I was scared shitless saying "wtf is that thing !? Is that a bat!?" And then being chased through the woods by like 20 scorched like the movie 28 Days Later. Just narrowly escaping or running into other players and being saved creates the immersion. Being level 200 and having everything , and all the quests completed is so unsatisfactory. There are still places I haven't explored , and creatures I haven't seen because I only play casually , but I still actually have fun experiences playing this game.
---
I posted a similar thought elsewhere. Each time there’s a sale I get much more junk than usual. With one exception I think I’ve scripped everything I got during a sale.
---
Well on xbox you can just pull up a list and join off of a random but not sure about other systems
---
You don't send textures over the internet.  They're all local.  Only state data is sent.  Jesus man, the host machine is not pushing textures and meshes down the pipe.  That would choke a gigabit connection.
---
You're out here telling everyone about how it can't be done without even understanding HOW ITS DONE.
---
Sadly right after posting this someone was talking about that on twitch lmao I hope it's not true
---
Especially after promising cosmetic only in the atom shop. WHAT THE FUCK
---
Why kisses?
---
100% agree, universally people reported the same results, the week before the sale I did 14 melee weapon pulls and got (5) keepers and (4) of the "meh" items were rare melee weapons like Sheepsquash staffs etc..
---
Vault Dweller: But I want to be just like you! 😄
---
100% Agree and the majority seem to see the same.
---
Put some respect on Nuclear Winter, muffuka
---
I don't play a ton of Nuclear Winter but I love the Halloween stuff they're showing here.
---
I suggest starting a new character and going from there. Do a really rare build that you don't see around much, like a chem build or a tanky build with high health and damage/energy resistance
---
I want a cat, so that's why I have the topiaries everywhere, plus my collectron named Plays With Molerats.
---
You've got to understand that 'weight' is just a proxy they use to control how many DB entries the server has to handle.
---
Every db entry is memory needed which costs money.
---
So you're always going to be 'weight-limited' - I expect that the weight limits will increase if the game becomes popular enough to pay for costs-to-date (and then they'll spend the excess in non-essential hardware upgrades to improve QoL) and/or if gathered data show they can maintain stability with more item entries to keep track of.
---
Yes?  Is anyone seriously expecting to be able to move characters between them?  Especially once modding becomes available.
---
There are definitely seeds in the game....My second character at level 127 gets much better Purveyor pulls and world drops than my level 350 character...It is not even close....Also, I mad a syringer for a "project" I was doing last night and syringer ammo drops all over the place now that I am carrying it around...My buddy thinks I am crazy but I see the little things like this that are just too convenient to not be on purpose
---
Few additional things
---
SFE isn't necessary for Perk Loadout Manager per se, but if you don't install it you have to use the [card building site](https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks). But SFE is used for the Chat mod as well iirc.
---
One can also rename the mods to save characters in the .ini, I've read there is a limitation on how many it'll read...haven't run into a problem with it running quite a few mods, but I renamed them down to 3 characters each.
---
I use the fire axe for the aesthetic
---
Have you explored the whole map and found all the locations?
---
Any cliffs in the mire or even Savage divide overlooking the cranberry bog are great. Just do some scouting, you'll find something
---
Yep new one I heard of was a cheat on pc that makes legendary vendor accept caps instead of scrip...
---
I have zero problem paying BGS for private servers IF they don't get stupid about hosting costs.  If they do a reasonable monthly/yearly/one-time fee for unlimited private server use I'll be fine.  If they want something stupid like $5 each time to book a private server, then they deserve to be demonized.
---
I can see duper gangs exploiting the crap out of private servers, so I'm hoping they have some idea on how to stop that from happening.
---
Nah PC we are fucked, can't even message other people like consoles can
---
Love the day my CAMP was begin hit by two when I fast traveled in.  Don't know how many times they killed me. I used all the ammo I had to drop them.  Had two walls left.
---
Thank you for the honest reply. This is essentially what I expected to hear. I do enjoy exploring game worlds, so I might give it a try.
---
I’ve read that you can put a bathtub over a crop to give this illusion. But even if it works you still need to be over dirt
---
There is a place south of pylon 13 [cranberry bog]
---
A floating car you can get on good view safe from enemies one catch dead settler but we can cover that up
---
For🤹🤹🤹Fun
---
Sounds like duping isn’t the issue but crappy lottery system. Prices drop if you can farm a few months to get it but the odds of getting desired items is next to impossible.
---
I was checking an Outer worlds review about the game taking about 30 hours to complete.
---
Then what?
---
besides different colored nurse outfits, what is there to farm here?
---
$15 dollars a month and comes with a stash box for junk that’s unlimited.
---
Keep track of some of the "basics" on a google doc and you'll have a good idea vs. a hunch after a few dozen "pulls" and  know for sure after a couple hundred.  
---
And thanks!
---
if you are on PC, I will give great amounts of good gear for the supressors explosive laser rifle
---
Because they make your stash box unlimited for junk items.
---
Codes are up on Nukacrypt
---
ZAX just sent out a transmission and there's scheduled maintenance on the game tomorrow. Looks like there will be some new nuclear winter rewards and some updates to nuclear winter as well.
---
1) Are you not expressing your own moral superiority by railing on about how this person is a hypocritical “SJW”? By suggesting that people (those with actual OCD in this example) are too sensitive and need to toughen up?
---
2) Again, maybe I need help with reading comprehension, but what part of the above definition says only left-leaning individuals are capable of virtue signaling?
---
3) You still haven’t addressed the primary issue here. I think the OP should in the future reconsider using “OCD” the way they did because it’s insensitive to those who actually live with OCD by trivializing the term and perpetuating the stigma attached to mental illness. Can you explain to me your problem with that? All I’ve heard from you are semantic arguments and attacks on the people disagreeing with you in this thread. It’s almost like...you don’t have an argument?

No matter what happens, tomorrow is going to be one hell of a day!

Campfire takes should give them but only if you have the proper rank, that is you have got the normal backpack.

Isn't outer world's only supposed to be 15-20 hours long? If so that's a pretty temporary solution

Military ammo bags have ballistic fiber, junk like aluminum and steel. The straight jackets weigh next to nothing so you can pick up a quite bit of those and sell to a vendor.

 I wondered how that worked on pc

These are all client-side, and Beth acknowledges them as ui/qol tweaks.

Playstation fucked it up. Now they have changed their minds so i hope that it could happen someday.
---
Same same, *but different*
---
It’s worse than that, it keeps sending you back to the same servers when their pop is lowest.
---
At least the ones on Nexus, I think so. Every now and then I go see the comments per mod and I've yet to see someone saying they've been banned for it, lack of evidence isn't truth or what have you but I still say its a decent sign.
---
I've been running (edit) a handful (/edit) of them since they were posted to Nexus, haven't been messed with...I suppose fingies crossed but I'm really not too worried.
---
I only have a few dozen hours in ESO, but it also has UI mods iirc.
---
all i'm missing is Astoundingly Awesome 4, spent so many hours looking but no luck :(
---
I encountered something that scared the shite out of me the undying diseased wretched tick I was lvl 54 he wouldn't die....... They're coming THERE COMING¡!!!
---
Also I encountered a undying radscorpion hunter at lvl 87 just run u can't joinem
---
If only it wouldn’t take me 20 levels to respec for it.
---
Guess it depends on your play style and if you would play the story multiple times to try different characters, companions, and weapons
---
ive encountered countless invincible stuff the deathclaw was the only one at my camp lol
---
 I hunt them, I kill them, but I still remember my first time. ;)
---
It’s not pay to win!  Get off the soap box and fucking chill.
---
I've hit a point that i'll probaby buy it for around 20 bucks. My buddies and reviews suggest otherwise but I just want to play it for the fact of Fallout itself.
---
No it may not be a 'true fallout game'
---
It has it's bullshit bugs, even more frequent, but Fallout has always been known for that.
---
Some combat scenarios and interactions might suck.
---
Bethesda may must be chocking up a bunch of excuses, and if they are working to  the bone to fix it no one knows because we dont work there. 
---
The in game purchases look like a crock of shit, but its just a trend with games lately.
---
At the end of the day though, fuck it.
---
It's some sort of Fallout with a whole new location to explore.  It might suck sometimes and be desolate. Some people in game may be shitty but at the end of the day,
---
IT'S THE WASTELAND, BITCHES!
---
Take it for what it is. If you're expecting sunshine and rainbows, go fucking play pokemon.
---
I want a funney little hat for free.
---
wait, the military paint is not in the game yet? i bought it from a vending machine, now i feel bad
---
&gt;I was checking an Outer worlds review about the game taking about 30 hours to complete.
---
&gt;
---
&gt;Then what?
---
Are you familiar with the concept of RPGs and multiple runs? Like... I enjoy Fallout 76 but playthrough number one is gonna be exactly the same as playthrough five, until Wastelanders anyway.
---
**I am on PC but........**
---
Due to the GPU Bug Bethesda introduced (long story, trust me it's a problem with their EXE and not me) I only get 2 - 5 FPS on my weapon mule most of the time so trades are **EXCEPTIONALLY** painful, as a result will only trade for gear I am specifically looking for.  
---
  
---
Need to know you / references for the super rare unique Legacy items, too many of the items there was exactly one of in the entire PC platform suddenly became common place and I'm careful to avoid contributing to that nonsense.
---
Last to be clear I will reject deals that include any of the commonly duped items flat out, not suggesting / accusing you of doing it, but their value in my eyes is considerably less then market.
---
All that said Check my "looking for" tab, see if you have some of my wants.
---
An explosive laser rifle with a beam splitter. Great weapon for PVP and mobs of enemies, not so great against scorchbeasts though.
---
Damn you guys are ruthless yeesh
---
Congrats! I have been killing a bunch by myself lately and it’s nice to look back on a time when I couldn’t do it at all.  Cheers to many more.
---
Bloodied has nerd rage and adrenal reaction which is 2 bonus damage effects instead of 1. Also withdrawals are twice as bad where as nerd rage is just a flat bonus 20% damage with added DR and ER.

---
You can see they only update the game usually once a month. [F2P game companies do way better than that](https://www.pathofexile.com/forum/view-forum/patch-notes), especially considering theres so much broken shit in this game. Its actually sad/infuriating how little they fix. Or "fix" and stays broken. Lol
---
&gt;Some combat scenarios and interactions might suck.
---
Enemies have shit pathing and AI, constantly getting stuck in little rocks/branches.
---
&gt;The in game purchases look like a crock of shit, but its just a trend with games lately.

A couple days ago they announced that they're going back on the promise of cosmetic mtx only. Boooo!
---
&gt;IT'S THE WASTELAND
---
The most boring one to traverse so far. There are some cool locations, but for the most part the map is barren.
---
&gt;Take it for what it is. If you're expecting sunshine and rainbows, go fucking play pokemon.
---
Kinda aggressive for no reason there bud.
---
&gt;No it may not be a 'true fallout game'
---
I still don't know what kind of game this is at all, even after doing everything in it.
---
&gt;...for people who actually have “lives.”
---
Bingo!
---
This. This. This.
---
Military X-01 is but not Military T-51 or T-60.

A vendor is a static entity that can reliably sourced. A player selling cheap legendaries requires much more effort to locate.
---
I’m guessing that you’re a very honest, good hearted player based on your responses, but there are lots of vultures out there. To use a common saying, that’s why we can’t have nice things.
---
Again, when you throw numbers at RNG, anything is possible. I had a tiny sample size of 4800 scrip to spend over the weekend and walked away with at least a dozen very desirable guns ranging from a V/E combat shotgun to a B/50 Fixer. Imagine what would happen if I could employ a dozen underage, unskilled workers to farm vendors for 12 hours a day and all I need to give them were in game caps and a steady supply of bottom shelf amphetamines. Add in two dozen other identical sweatshops and the game economy crumbles to dust.
---
Another one of these post?
---
Ahh ya mine will get stuck like that until I manually reload. It acts like I’m hip firing but the view of sighted.
---
Its not a straw man if people are making the exact post I'm referring to.
---
So I’m guessing you play pc

Do you still need help?

It's pretty much why a chunk of casual players left.
---
There are serious issues with a lot of things in this game that are supposed to be random.  On my first character, from level 1 to about 150, I always got far less high radiation fluid than the other two nuke crafting materials.  Time and time again, I had to sell all the extra hardened masses and glowing masses I had when the quantity would reach like 50 of each.  The majority of people I asked about it over the text chat mod for the PC version were getting equal amounts of all three.  They definitely make the mistake of using a value that is tied to your player id number or name or something like that as part of the seed value in algorithms that involve random selection, but something about the way they do it causes bias at times when true randomness is desired.
---
I just hope it doesn't cost anything if there is something.
---
It's great that you put in all this effort. However, a sample of 5 accounts is hardly conclusive. 
---
It'd be nice if we had a mod to gather all this sort of data to get a better sense of the overall state of how this legendary RNG is managed. Even then, it'll only be PC-specific data but still.
---
Also, what platform was this on? PC?
---
But bethesda not being good game devs surely explains it tho
---
don't they already have the blank billboard in the atom shop?
---
That issue of cryptid Hunter January by Boomer which starts a quest

Still not enough ppl playing on PC

So, instead of nerfing bloodied you want to buff junkie's. It's silly.
---
“ please only take a couple and leave some for everyone else.”

The first trick or treater shows up.  All candy is gone. Halloween at the Vega homestead is over.

I call this the Bill Maher Paradox.
---
what's your framerate\vertical sync?
---
Honestly all I could really ask for is that televisions all across the wasteland play that speech that was shown in the original game trailer. Hell I wouldn't mind the original trailer for the game playing on the TVs even if only for a day.
---
Watch the world burn?
---
You mean if they sell them for real money only and not atoms?
---
Why did you post this?
---
Junkie is already 40% flat less damage from bloodied without the additional damage from adrenal and nerd rage. If you've played junkie's before the withdrawal effects can actually be a bit of a struggle to work with since most junkie players don't run unyielding to boost their special points since it'd be better to run bloodied at that point. Doubling the effects of withdrawals would make things more troublesome for players since they can't be reduced. Personally I think it would be a neat way to buff junkies so theres less of a divide between bloodied and everything else without directly buffing junkie's damage.
---
Bye!
---
The same thing that was wrong with it yesterday, and all the days before that.
---
I am wondering what new bugs they have come up with for the update.
---
Radium rifles and gamma guns are already underused.
---
I'm guessing an exasperated rage quit for who knows what reason.
---
And?  P2P is a connection method - that doesn't mean you're not connecting to a server.  A server is just a computer that handles some things for other computers.  P2P has been around for a long time.  There have been games running P2P back in the 1990's.
---
Take, for example, Warframe.  P2P game.  No one is tethered to the host.  Each peer runs their own game - host runs his game and deals with state data from all the other peers, tells them what the state and position of everything is.  
---
Get that?  Warframe is an online MP game that runs on a P2P model and it has none of the problems you claim P2P games would have.

I can do different things, I can be your high lvl guide or I can use one of my lower lvl characters. Or I can start fresh. Let me know, Reaper1944

You live in the Midwest. I’ve only ever seen an A&amp;W restaurant in states where corn or cows have their own holidays.

Their burgers are pretty good.
---
Knew something was strange with the purveyor, held off on lvling my mules for hopeful Fixer picks when valseek said something about Fixers. Got nothing but garbage weapons on my 2 mains, that's when I said to myself...I'm not wasting the 12000 scrip sitting on my 8 alts/mules.
---
I'm on Xbox.
---
I just found a cemetery you can build at just last night. If I hadn't committed so much time to my current camp, I would've moved. 😖
---
Why are they only announcing a Halloween event just a week before Halloween? Did they say anything about halloween events in previous communications?
---
Great reference point, I might have to keep an eye on that when I can do a Nuked WhiteSprings again..
---
Bye Felicia
---
....but same.
---
It been pretty much the only game I've played for months and I find I enjoy it more as I keep playing.
---
I play a single character and have one mule to hold weapons I dont use but want to keep.
---
I've got 350 hours in so well worth it for me and I think I've got plenty left. Especially with wastelanders down the road).
---
If you like fallout you cant really go wrong. I recommend a discord  channel that's active so you can be in tune when someone drops a nuke or triggers other events but beyond that I pretty much go it solo.
---
Definitely recommend it, especially if it's in sale.
---
yeah i mean the detailed info. oh offically tomorrow? that would be nice. ill hold off till then cuz i assume saves are gonna be separate for private worlds (likely still on their end) but if they allow modding for private worlds in the future then surely it will most likely be a separate character then their servers.
---
You've made a wise decision.
---
No.
---
I started again the other day,  level 14 now but im keen to meet some new people to explore Appalachia over again with
---
Platform is PC.
---
Don't disagree with it being a smaller sample size, but it is VERY controllable and replicable which is the most important part, and the results are exceptionally stark, which is both great and a little depressing.
---
My first post including the "Seeded" theory was referencing a few thousand legendary drops over a couple months (every drop tracked) and a few WhiteSprings runs (Nuked, pre-nerf) where all 4 characters tracked their legendary drops for each 3 -5 hour run, and people complained that wasn't a valid sample set either.  
---
(Not controlled enough and people could of not been honest with their drops...... for whatever reason.)  
---
I agree it would be nice to have the information revealed, and the '76 Dataminer's and XEdit teams have worked hard to unlock the EXE and JSON's so we can see the curves and other effects, but even that won't show us everything as much is still held server side.
---
Until we have that information the only thing that can be done is controlled tests in the exact same conditions, pulling the exact same set of items at same time on the same server to remove as many variables as possible.
---
It's also interesting that Universally people seem to see MUCH lower quality legendary returns during the sales, observational bias aside, if enough people see smoke...
---
No. You are too late.
---
Not a bad call.  
---
I also saw generally much crappier legendary returns on most characters (more Nocturnal and Mutant Slayer's vs other more beneficial combos) but figured it was worth the time for the data if nothing else.
---
You should be bored at level 250. If you think otherwise you may be insane...name another game where you get to level 250. I'll wait.
---
I think it's almost over. Might wanna get them all today.

---
Same here bro. It’s been boring now and that moment that you are stuck looking at the map...that’s when you know the game has gone dry. The second week of meat week wasn’t enough to make me participate in the event. Only thing now I’m looking forward is the Halloween event and Wastlanders.
---
Eh whatever, I guess I missed it
---
Yes. 
---
The waiting time between matches is terribly long.
---
And that's why I dont do silo runs. Lag Is so bad, It stops being enjoyable. It really feels like a broken game.
---
In the base game isn’t it perception based?  Not sure if that carries over to NW however.
---
Hell even just for saving some freedom bucks, just wait 3 months. On any release.
---
From somebody who definitely regrets pre-ordering the tricentennial version. And a few others. Steam alone has proven the patient are rewarded.
---
Thinking is above my pay grade 😐
---
My hype for private servers has significantly died, servers are capped at 7 players. I have a community of friends and it's about 20 of us and we were looking forward to this so much, such a shame :(
---
don't get mad. get revenge!
---
It's a cool gun. I have one myself. Really fun to use, but it Is not as powerful as it should be.
---
but they throw those into some bundles.  that sques the numbers
---
I’m not going to be surprised if it drops in January/early February. I think getting it out of The Outer Worlds release window was a factor in the decision. Sure, they’ll use the time to give it some extra polish, but I’m not convinced that was the only factor. 
---
If they didn’t, imagine how many “Which Fallout should you get?” articles and videos would be posted. If it weren’t perfect, that blowback would be amplified. All the major Fallout content creators are planning to stream/cover OW. How embarrassing would it be to see them ignoring your major release just to cover the one from the studio that did the “Good” Fallout? Not to mention how valuable that exposure is, it doesn’t make sense to miss it. 
---
A January/February release would be a pleasant surprise for those expecting to wait longer and will also keep it out of release windows for other games, like Cyberpunk 2077.
---
&gt;Get one of the dupers to disclose their method
---
This is not difficult. I found somebody busy with duping at Whitesprings Train Station. I asked this player "How you doing all this duping? This gentleman was polite enough to explain me how this trick works. Now I know. 
---
It seems like Bethesda is not trying at all guys.
---
they aren't doing things like eso though.  far from it
---
I’d pay that.
---
Etsy, really? You mean all those thieves who sell things made from IP they have no right to use.
---
Of course they should be all burned for the IP crimes, but Bethesda allows that because it's small scale and done by so many individuals.
---
They should all be removed and follow cap mines into oblivion. I am sure Bethesda likes this 'legacy' thing because some people play AND spend time looking for those weapons, visiting subs and buying them/selling them as part of the endgame experience.
---
I took a picture of the first one I brought down all by myself at the top of mount Blair. It's the only picture in game I haven't eventually deleted
---
&gt;Are you familiar with the concept of RPGs and multiple runs? 
---
Yes, and some people might play it few times. Its still not going to amount to much.
---
"Semantic arguments", Lol. Face it, you've got nothing;  your so-called points are pointless. If you really had something to say about the one who made the OCD comment, then you would address them directly and not divert your conversations through me. But, as it is, you've not made any effort to comment on what they'd said, so you're doing your own share of virtue-signaling, just like the other guy! You give the impression that you care, but you'd rather just talk than doing anything to actually affect your desired change; if you've an issue with it, then bring it to the attention of the guy who is supposedly "trivializing" the condition (at least according to how _you_ perceive it).
---
You folks  purposely seek out a boogyman where there isn't one, and _that's_ the issue. 'nuff said.
---
definitely upvoting this and monitoring it
---
I think the fact that melee weapons had that limb +1A bug is a sign that beth is meddling with the system to say the least. I for one have also realized that I've been really lucky with my recent pulls, usually pulling one of Junkies zerker bloodied TS or furious.
---
I think you have a great mind and the motivation to do truly exceptional things for our game community, but you’re going to have to start crowdsourcing vetted data in order to tackle RNG. Your sample size, while large compared to the average player, is like picking out a few incredibly distant, faint stars in the entire night sky and trying to glean information from those. I deeply admire your personal efforts, but the total sum of all legendary loot drops from beta minute one to now is certainly in the tens of millions.
---
You need real numbers to crunch. I’m talking about analyzing the data of thousands of players across hundreds of thousands of loot drops. Setting up an online poll won’t work. You need evidence of every claim for your findings to be valid. My wife is a scientist and has published papers in reputable journals. Every last piece of data needs to be transparent and accounted for, in order for your claims to be taken seriously.
---
If you believe that accounts are seeded to favor certain effects, you’re going to have to start analyzing the data from dozens or hundreds of other accounts to truly discover if a pattern exists, if accounts are seeded, or even if outlier chaos accounts exist that are completely unseeded. You can’t just look for one kind of data. You have to also look at theories that conflict with your own and disprove them with the same quality of empirical data.
---
If you’re looking for manpower, substantiated data or expert witnesses, I’ll be happy to offer what I can.
---
Your idea says Atomic Shop.
---
If it is, it hasn't worked for me since last year.
---
Been hopping back n forth between 76 and NV. NV is ridiculously generous if you go heavy in PER, perk, or have ED-E with you.
---
Only time they show up on my compass in 76 is after aggro, main is sneak heavy (w/12 PER + low HP &amp; unyielding) so it isn't ideal, but until I go into \[DANGER\] the compass is clear.
---
I don't play NW much at all, but shit it doesn't work in Adventure for me.
---
You haven't said anything remotely "right" in this thread there chief.
---
If that ammo drop thing  you mentioned is not a game feature (maybe coz of SPECIAL points?) then I'm definitely experiencing it.
---
Yes. We will pay more.
---
I really...really hope they add pets as CAMP companions, similar to how Brahmin roam around your CAMP with a Brahmin Pen. I assume if they if ever do add this content, it will be behind the Atomic Shop which sucks, we can only hope...
---
The only things I don't see getting fixed is Stability, and bug fixes.
---
Level 45.  I mod'd to Hardened Piercing with large magazine.  Now 56 dmg, 40 rof. Second  is +50% limb damage.
---
imagine paying 60 bucks for FO76  😨
---
*this post was made by used copy + summer discount gang*
---
Anywhere between $4.99 and $23.99, price scaling with how many slots for players you want. Each slot would allow for full teams of players, and you can upgrade or downgrade.
---
4 players, $4.99
---
8 players, $8.99
---
12 players, $10.99 (“BEST DEAL!”)
---
16 players, $14.99
---
20 players, $19.99
---
Full server, $24.99
---
No there won’t be that many options, probably just three or four similar looking options like 8, 16, full and maybe 4, if I’m forced to take a guess. But these seem like fair prices to the guy who just got into online gaming last year because of this game
---
CONSUMER. BUY ATOMS. DO. NOT. THINK. BUY.
---
Dude I did the same(not the BIGGEST fo fan but a fan  nonetheless, loved 3,nv, and 4) and on sale it’s DEF worth it. Knowing there was no NPCs(which was my biggest gripe) going in helped, knowing they’re going to add them eventually helped too.
---
As for the game itself? At times downright beautiful, the color and lighting made it look great to me at times.
---
Gameplay? It’s exactly what you’d think. It’s fallout, but somewhat simplified for an online experience(if you’ve ever played a game that had a similar copycat online mode, you know what I mean)
---
Im having fun, and I can see myself having fun at the VERY least until “endgame” at which point even if I stop(which I don’t plan on) I still got my money’s worth
---
Thanks, helps to counter the Downvotes the other (not just mine) posts regarding this issue seem to illicit (it just went from 100% to 78% in 30 minutes, lol)
---
what if they're selling an actual handmade?
---
I got it day 1. Worth it to me
---
Dear Mr.Ictanike,
---
I hope this mail finds you well.
---
Please find attached my sincere letter regarding you quitting this game. Please don't hesitate to contact me for any further information or documents you may require. 
---
Regards,  
---
Todd "Mountains" Howard
---
Amazing! Now if only I could teach my dog to play my alt account..
---
Hop the server? I’ve had a lot of good experiences with higher lvls helping out low lvls like me (27) though I know and am sure there are just some assholes like any online game.
---
bruhhhhh move to a different server or stop throwing a fit over a child
---
tldr but you could lean over the feller and buy your gear my man. vendors (both player and bot) and scrippers are a different story tho
---
Lol even if that how it worked that wouldnt he a reason to not release a server sdk.  We can builders servers as good or better than theirs
---
Nah he was in her menu.
---
I would guess it's host+7 People to allow for two full teams. Or at least hope it is.
---
I bought it. It’s like post-apocalyptic Sims with weapons. I love it. It’s like if Second Life was amazing. No complaints other than your usual Bethesda bugs.
---
I’d recommend running around the mountains in the Forest region, especially around Ski and Lookout areas. Used to have mine on the hill above the Ammo Factory which has a beautiful view, still miss it sometimes. Had to move cause the people who would take over the factory would have Scorchbeasts flying over and destroy my innocent CAMP.
---
As a side note, there are maps people have made on Reddit and Google that have all the various deposit sites on them, currently moved on top of a junk extractor South of Whitesprings and get tons of junk as well as foot traffic to my vendors at my CAMP.
---
are we sure? I remember leaning over a guy and buying just 5 days ago. so he wasn't in her menu huh?
---
I remember reading your first thread about drop rates, etc, and it caused me to keep an eye out for "random" weapon and armor primary fixes. I don't keep a running list, but my main toon is a HUGE magnet for auto stim armor of any type (6 out of 7 3* sale rolls before I finally just stopped trying) and missile launchers (three in a row across three server hops). Weapons tend to run in spurts, but that damn auto stim wont leave me alone.  :(
---
He was I kept trying to buy and she wouldn’t put me in her menu.
---
Best case, someone reads this who works at Bethesda, files it away with the rest of the trash and collects all the positive information to send up to his superiors as is his job day in and day out. Knowing what the fans really think and distilling that down to what his bosses want to hear.
---
Worst case, made me feel like I had control and finality over something as simple as losing my favorite IP to the ravages of time.
---
Money my friend. You should have learned that by now with this game.
---
Same 👌
---
It was added in the last update. I'm assuming it was because people were complaining about not being able to grow plants in it.
---
This is neo-bethesda boi, don't ask silly questions like that
---
I think that the update is tomorrow, instead of the normal Tuesday, indicates they've got something in mind. I'm kinda bummed since PG&amp;E will be turning power off to 800K people again tomorrow, I wont see whatever it is.
---
Wow, and here I thought that with Private Servers and mods in them I might return to the game. Ever since they removed the carry weight bugs they killed the game, so with this news guess I'm still not going back to it.
---
If they added another Dogmeat, canonically it would be the FIRST Dogmeat since this game predates Fallout 1... wow. The grandpappy of all Dogmeats.
---
To be fair, none of the recent weekly challenges have been of 40 atom difficulty. Landing 50 critical hits can be done in one five minute SBQ with a VATS build. A couple days tops with a slugger.  Wearing formal wear while completing events is done with no effort aside from going to the Hotel, buying slacks and a bowler and just wearing them as you play normally during the week.
---
Typically the 40 atom challenges are photo or booze related. We just haven’t had one of those in a while.
---
When atom challenges are more difficult, players complain. When they’re easy, player complain. The atom shop doesn’t have enough raider items. Now it has too much. No one seems to be counting their lucky stars that they have the free time to complain about video game problems.
---
Maybe the splash image should be a Somali orphan, so we have a little perspective on life before posting on Reddit.
---
Thanks!

Atm it's boredom since I can't really "play" until my '76 GPU bug is fixed, but I do what I can.  
---
Crowd sourcing the data is a great idea, but we would need to figure out a way to weed out the people who will purposely give bad data to skew the results, happened a bit with the fasnacht tracking, but with enough motivated and dedicated people I'm sure we could collect enough good data to give us a better idea!  
---
Can't argue with the sample size being small, but it's hard to get good data on a micro, especially "controlled" data.  
---
It's something I'd love to help with, but don't have the time (or drive) to put it together on a large scale, as wrangling that much information is a job in it's own right!  
---
On a small scale, if people started tracking just the "Primary" legendary effects for a couple to a few thousand drops they will often start to see a pattern.  
---
As an example in my case I seem to loot "Weightless" armor more frequently.  
---
Sometimes up to 30% of the total armor drops in a given period (varies of course, sometimes it's Nocturnal) and when I stopped tracking EVERY legendary drop in the first 2 or so months it represented 35'ish of my first couple thousand armor drops.   
---
As an opposite example, if memory serves, In the first 2 months I saw Two-Shot on less than 5% of my Legendary weapon drops (1\*+), and still see very rarely.
---
So i get my best success from that event using a vampire shotgun to keep my health up as the conduit
---
have to think it's related, unless they have a wacky feature to cause more syringer ammo while doing one of the quests related to it.
---
I ended up soloing 3 Scorchbeasts at lvl 43 
---
Since I was a 2 handed Melee at that time I guess it wasn't very surprising to me.
---
But the problem is people not doing the event, and only killing the robots, we dont need 14 people above level 100 killing adds
---
You should try NW tho. It's fun!
---
Yes. They are bullet sponges that provide crap loot.  I usually run away, not for my life, but to save my bullets. The first one is always exciting and you never forget where it happened.  Mine was at Whitesprings and I did have help from the bots.  Pure solo was the rift near AMS Testing Site at like level 50? Fireproof perk makes them annoying but not deadly.  Reminds me of the Sheepsquatch.  Total bullet sponge, but never really worried about getting killed.  Sheepsquatch drops \* legendaries so it's worth spending the bullets.
---
Cry me a river lol
---
Two reasons.
---
For a long while I didn't have anyone to consistently team with after my roommates stopped playing. That isn't currently an issue for I have a few people I usually team up with every night that I met while playing. When I didn't have anyone though I moved points out of Charisma to go into more agility to make more of a vats build.
---
Second reason... I bought a $10 copy of FO76 to run on my girlfriend's xbox. Not only is it a mule but the idea is to get it to Charisma 15 and at least 5 in everything else. That way I can passively share whatever perk I may need on any of my main account characters xD
---
shure thing whats your psn
---
Tragic. Xbox1 over here.
---
i just sent a fr
---
Ouch, yes that is a small but very extreme example of the patterns that sometimes seem to show up, 6/7 is a bit crazy, shame it wasn't Unyielding right?   
---
Feel the pain!  
---
For me it's Weightless and Nocturnal, in almost equal numbers, I love the weightless stuff (great for "Mule" characters when they have weight reduction perks on them) but the Nocturnal is always trash!
---
You'll get Halloween themed cosmetics in the atom shop and like it.
---
Woah man you really showed them
---
Yeah up your....
---
I got more dont worry.
---
The damage numbers may well be wrong. They were for Furious weapons, I tested my 1\* Furious handmade on a mule to check the numbers a few weeks ago, and the HP loss was increasing with each shot but the damage numbers didn't show any increase at all.
---
But if you can't tell the difference by how quickly you can take down enemy HP on say a sheepsquatch then that extra armor pen isn't working like it should do.
---
Those damn Yao Guais hit to hard.... And so fast.
---
Ok, can I drown all my hopes in it after I am done?
---
Sure, be my guest.
---
Fantastic, I’ll put my hopes that 76 wouldn’t be trash there, it will be great!
---
Because this is Bethesda’s last effort to milk the little community it has left for cash before the game dies. They delayed wastelanders DLC. The only reason many people still played it and the reason many would come back. Now that it’s delayed and 4 awesome games are coming out this week, f76 won’t make it to March when they most likely release wastelanders.
---
Pretty sure getting to the last 10 alive players is 300 or so xp
---
neener-neener-neener
---
A lot of people unknowingly carry around damaged mainframe cores. 
---
I'm sure this doesn't apply to you, this is more of a PSA.
---
I was assuming something like that. Just didn't turn around in time lol
---
Hit level 10 this evening and got med-x to proc as my first addiction. Using a beefed up Junkies pipe revolver as my main with a fire axe as backup. So far so good as long as I stay nimble.
---
I think it'll be doable so long as I stage my addictions every 5-10 levels to offset the hit to SPECIAL and stay in areas I can manage. I've also got some low level vanguards armor which helps as well.
---
Thanks for the feedback, it is appreciated!
---
I have, and it's not
---
Wholesome :)
---
If you read the inside the vault, it’s the update that comes out tomorrow.
---
If you can make top 9, you're guaranteed 350 xp or so. You can get the full 3k pretty easily.
---
Changing server and ... nope still bugged [http://prntscr.com/pmvbdu](http://prntscr.com/pmvbdu)
---
I've only played one or two games with private servers, and neither had free. Nothing new here......
---
The only thing that would suck if they did something about this is that they fucked up on who was the one cheating before. By punishing innocent players, it could most likely happen again judging from how horribly they tried to punish the actual cheater and it ended up being an innocent player.
---
How long are matches? Ive never stepped into NW since it first came out so idk a lot of stuff about it other than weapons and armor is a single piece that gives you the whole set and weapons are already modded. Different perk cards that are condensed from adventure mode and mutation similar perk cards.
---
I know right
---
Wish you could just add an entry on a terminal...the free atom shop personal one could be perfect for this!
---
It's just that... Bethesda's making me pay money so that their game works correctly. (Less lag, etc.). Like, come on. I am down to pay money for private servers but at least make the public servers work first lol
---
You know Minecraft is the most popular pc game of all time, right?
---
Yeah, if the others die somehow. I got last one left because some people stood too close to an exploding car lulz
---
None in atom store yet. Candy from monster mash event and toilet paper from abandoned toilets ;)
---
I know a place but I'm not telling anyone, cause it's MY excellent view.
---
A dog would be awesome
---
It’s not trash. If it was you wouldn’t have played it this long 😂
---
TF2 will always be Titanfall 2 to me lol
---
Peer to peer isnt a connection to a server. Lmao
---
wanna back that up? "Chief"
---
Maybe to celebrate the bombs dropping they give everyone nuclear launch codes
---
The public server do work. Lol
---
The outer worlds is coming to Xbox game pass. I can't wait for it. Get to play it for freeeee.
---
Yes, But you just deal with it.  The ones that drives me nuts is the weapon swap and having to exit armor inside West Tek full of supermutants.  They KNOW when you are vulnerable -- If I can't find a supermutant but can hear him, I usally start scrapping guns and almost never fails in having them beeline straight for you.  Otherwise it's like he's playing hide and seek.   BTW, These bugs aren't happening all at once, but it seemed a bug per server jump is normal (Stealth being #1 issue).
---
Ugh the Great War happens on my anniversary 😢
---
You can look me up on XB1 same as here.
---
I agree that neither your data or the experience of people during the sale shouldn't be dismissed out of hand. Just because it's anecdotal, doesn't mean it still doesn't have some merit to it.
---
It's just that it's one person's data with no means to verify either the truth or the accuracy of the data. Yes, you provided a spreadsheet, though someone could present a counter argument or falsely confirm the same point with their own spreadsheet and it would have to be looked upon as equally valid.
---
While I personally trust that you're not making this up, with all due respect to you and the work that you've put in, it can't be discounted that there might be falsehoods, inaccuracies or biases (outside the ones you've already stated). We've had a history of people in this sub who seemingly seem to be earnest in their claim but have ended up to be proven false (900hrs duper guy comes to mind). So I hope you understand the caution.
---
Anyhow, it's an interesting data point all the same. I'll be curious if more testing by other people bare out a similar result.
---
Edit: Also, don't know why you were randomly downvoted. Didn't seem warranted.
---
Usually around 18-20 minutes. Shorter if people are actively fighting.
---
The smart ones that are duping and selling their dupes on ebay are not talking.
---
Duh
---
Why would they be free? Its a server, not singleplayer. Everybody saying money hungry etc but idk of any games with free private servers
---
That's a funny joke lol (No offense intended by that statement). I play unarmed and deal enough damage to one shot stuff. Sometimes I have to hit enemies up to 6 times before the damage registers and kills them. Vault raids straight up dont work (The newest one, nobody had been able to complete it. Not because it's hard, but because it's so damn laggy. Maybe somebody finally beat it, but that would only have been if they were playing on survival mode or on a very small server); you cant argue that. I see other people on this subreddit all the time complaining about performance issues. Fallout 76s public servers are trash; that's why people were playing on survival (Smaller server size=less lag) and I suspect most people buying private servers will be doing it for the performance boost.
---
coldddd bloooded
---
Just judging by the reply you deleted claiming it was too much to tether on the host, maybe? Lol
---
Get off your high horse and don't act like you know more than others all the time, or you'll be shown how little you truly know.

I have serious doubts it will ever happen.
---
A lot of random groups absolutely suck with that event. You never know what you are going to get. It is definitely tough, but apparently still not tough enough because people are able to solo it. My wife and I can do it as a duo no problem. She can hold all three conduits and my bloodied unarmed can kill her pretty quick. 
---
You would think that would make it a guaranteed win every time we do the event but that is not the case. There is always some dumbass that shoots a group of eyebots when they are right over the top of my wife holding all 3 conduits. Never fails.
---
plays fanfare
---
And it will be limited by the fact that the servers are bethesda run, and we dont have access to the servers themselves.
---
They should've just given us the files so we could host our own, and leave the paid option to those who dont want to bother with the hassle of doing that.
---
Its always the randos, whenever they start it, they do it no problem, but when you start it, something goes wrong
---
They do drop from normal scorchbeasts, just not as common
---
ah must have missed that
---
cheers!
---
No problem! Have a good one
---
Good point. Takes luck and persistence
---
Good thing honestly. Private servers are a gold mines for duppers and modders. It will help getting rid of those.
---
Why would you want to cheat/mod the game when you can already play the way it’s meant to be play?
---
happy anniversary!
---
I think setting up a site, or at least a social media portal, for your project would be a good starting point.  I feel confident that with some attention, players will be motivated to contribute.
---
I'm not sure how online images are vetted, either through hosts, email or actual notarized hardcopies, but a database of verifiable evidence is needed.  Since you can't force contributors to sign a legally binding document that ensures their honesty under penalty of law, I'm not sure if data can ever be 100% legit.
---
For example, I can tell you that I got a J/E/15 and a B/50 Fixer last Thursday, after spending 3000 scrip.  Sounds unlikely, right?  I'd need to gave you this [picture](https://imgur.com/tg2pP48) and this [picture](https://imgur.com/DOzxkaD), which were clearly added to my album on Thursday.  Even better would be the actual screenshots off my hard drive, which are timestamped.  Even that's not really good enough, because I could tell you I also rolled [this one](https://imgur.com/b6rT95A), which in fact was a trade for the B/50 version.  The image is legit, but my story is not truthful.  If your seed theory is to be verified, that one image filed into the database invalidates my entire sample of x000 items.
---
I'd also suspect that some people would actively try to skew your results for whatever reason.  Also, incredible streaks of luck happen, both good and bad, so those can't be discounted because they seem implausible.  As more numbers pile up, duplicity and falsification become the outliers and play into a smaller and smaller margin of error.
---
Given that you're working with data that statisticians and pollsters are intimately familiar with, it might be wise to visit the local university's math department and ask for a bit of advice.  I draw pictures for a living, so I can only call upon the experience of sharing a home with a science professional that needs to cross every T and dot every i when submitting an article for publication.  I don't need to authenticate anything in my professional life aside from writing my name and edition number on a piece of art I create.  For purposes that would interest you, my area of expertise is simply acquiring a little more legendary gear than the average Joe and serving as a data point.
---
thnx
---
Especially trapper chest overriding the backpack that I payed good atoms for that I earned for free doing challenges
---
I noticed this weeks challenge completed after a Nuclear Winter match and I didn’t get any atoms.
---
“Become a skull! It just works.”
---
sry I got nothing then
---
I deleted it because it was getting a ton of downvotes from people who dont know the difference between peet to peer and dedicated servers. Lmao. I know plenty on this particular subject bud. Try making an actual arguement with fact backing up a counter to what I've said.
---
They said there's be more info in the coming days.... last week. So maybe tomorrow after it comes out they will explain more.
---
I didnt pay attention to anything other than numbers on the furious. But the mags, I run 2 near identical handmades. 1 has stinging mag, and the other has drum. There is absolutely 0 difference in damage.
---
PS4. I forgot to mention that, thanks for asking!

A Dogmeat would be awesome.

They don't care.
---
You cannot press on billboard action key to see what it says and the example sign that i want to bring  in fallout 76 can be found in many fallouts  . Like museum signs ( like in new vegas and fallout 3 also ) .
---
Awesome :)
---
My friends mock me for playing FO76, too. They loved FO4, but once they heard the initial feedback they won't even entertain the thought of giving the game a chance and deride me for even suggesting it.
---
Luckily my little brother plays with me a good amount, but I play solo a lot too. I'm level 68. What system are you on?
---
Been playing since beta here, day 2 really since I had to redownload the game day 1. I still enjoy it, got three characters. Looking forward to Outer Worlds for an actual rpg fix tho
---
Nope, xbox
---
War. War never changes.
---
Good idea added
---
PS4. And all of my coworkers mock me for playing it but only play PVP games. Not dissing those by any means but I don’t really think they branch out or they like to make fun of me because I do my own thing by myself. I loved Fallout 4, it’s the first fallout game I’ve played!
---
I disagree that they're bullet sponges.  I run a stealth sniper build and they go down quickly and with very little effort/ammo.  Easy enough that they're a consistent source of food in my inventory.
---
Same here in NorCal
---
Just an alternative to standing in front of your house waiting for traders and telling them what you want
---
Unfortunately, if the average math professor is anything like my wife, they might have a couple hours to play video games during the week, but they certainly don't have the time to get involved in talking about said game online.  She's has classes to teach, a lab to run, and meetings to attend, not to mention friends, a home and a husband to pay attention to.  Putting a couple hours into Candy Crush during the week is about all she can manage, and I don't blame her for just wanting to zone out and arrange bright colors.
---
It could be fruitful to seek counsel, rather than waiting for it to come to you.  It's not like bloody/explosive weapons fall in our laps, either.
---
I'd be happy to start screen shotting and compiling my legendary drops for you, if that would further your interests.  Maybe I could send them off to you as a zip file on a weekly basis.  I have my doubts about accounts being seeded, as it would be fundamentally unfair and require unnecessary work on Bethesda's part, but it wouldn't be the craziest thing that turned out to be real.
---
Thanks
---
Ive already had like 3 months im sure it was like 8 or 12$ a month
---
Ah ok, I had issues with the ridiculous amount of duplicate cards and cheaters, but at least they fixed the dupes issue and there's less cheaters
---
It's just a depleting bar.  Who gives a fuck how you replenish it.
---
Cat meat steak
---
Idk i paid 10$ for a month after my 1$ the other day
---
pc, to play sea of thieve and state of decay 2 was like 10 USD
---
Damn that sucks
---
Im quite certain private worlds will use your existing char.
---
Bye. I dont see bethesda changing there tactics. Away from micro transactions anytime soon. They have the creation club selling there mods for $$. On fallout 76 they founded the atom shop.
---
It’s a joke, so either you don’t understand humor, you’re just not pleasant to talk to, or you really just want to be irritable
---
No it's ok now, thanks
---
My dude I used to struggle with that event but then I put together a full troubleshooter loadout and now I'm golden. I still have to sweat a bit if I hold all 3 conduits but 2 is a breeze and a troubleshooter meathook does serious damage even to the imposter
---
Like he just shows up at a gas station for no real reason?
---
Thewraith1990 add me bro
---
bulk ammo scrap gone :(
---
If by Fixer you mean that suppressed combat rifle that let's you sneak faster, I bought 2 of those plans for 10 caps each last week. I didn't realise it's so slight after.
---
I can hold my own, its everyone else that refuses to participate, even if I hold only 2, no one grabs the 3rd and I just waste health
---
I sent a request!!
---
$15/month isn't horrific, but, not fantastic.  $10 would go over better.  I can see people thinking $180/year is not gonna happen for private servers. 
---
I'm gong to try it for $15 and see how it goes.  You essentially are paying to be able to exploit all the resource facilities and legendary spots without having to share, wait, or worry about being PVPed at a workshop if you want a PVE experience.
---
PVP players can set up a private server and EVERYONE on the map has to turn off pacifist and duke it out.
---
this is some crystallized autism
---
I really hope they bring this back. I started playing after a lot of the cool stuff was gone.
---
Done
---
Does Bethesda actually pay attention to the Bethesda please section? Or is it where you send stuff they don't care about and are tired of seeing?
---
They will show if they are within your view and not sneaking.  An enemy will also briefly show up on the map if they drop a nuke.
---
What kind of circlejerk is curently going here???
---
agree completely :D same with complaints that private servers aren't free. the game doesnt charge a monthly fee or anything, it's completely free once you buy. and since it's a continuous online game, they need revenue flow to keep new content rolling over time and to keep the servers running
---
personally I think charging for private servers is a much much better idea than a monthly sub fee or something. they even throw atoms at you like candy, so you don't even need to spend money on microtransactions *while still obtaining the microtransaction items*
---
bethesda is nowhere near perfect. they regularly screw up royally, and entirely deserve to be reprimanded when they do, but like, this ain't it
---
It's a Combat shotgun plan, but yes that's the one. I don't know that it is particularly sought-after. A stealth-shotgun build would be a pretty uncommon choice I imagine.
---
my what?
---
I hope your anniversary is "the bomb"(amazing)!
---
The 21st night of September?
---
Completely ignoring the body of your question here.
---
So how much does Bethesda pay you for running pr? How did you get the job? Do they treat their employees well?
---
Did you look in to it?
---
That sounds about right. Thanks for answering! Can anyone else verify this information?
---
What us fish owners hmmmm, wheres my fish flakes?
---
This ^
---
There is nothing that the private server will be able to give you advantage of except maybe workshops and less lag. You won't be able to change any sort of settings on them at least not for a long while so everything is going to be the same as the base game. Even worse you can only launch 3 nukes at a time and theres no server hopping to reset the timer.
---
May you make it through the apocalypse
---
You should be able to take it out yourself pretty quickly. Field surgeon and first aid perks, don't run dodgy, you'll need the AP to get clear for a few moments to heal,  then get back to it. You'll be alright, I run this event all the time
---
Maybe when Bethesda implements underwater creatures. Idk why they havent done it. They already have the model for the Slaughter Fish in Skyrim.
---
My greatest regret in becoming a herbivore was leaving behind the days of tasty Cat meat.
---
Hell, I had it the shield down for a solid total 2 mins and no one was shooting it, I didnt have many stims the second time either
---
I dont think any cat owner would eat their cat.... atleast I like to pretend like they dont.
---
Lol way to slide that in an unrelated conversation.
---
$10 a month, but there's always a deal that anyone without an active subscription can use to get the first month for $1.
---
Cause of exploits maybe?
---
shut up and take my money!
---
its not full offline but....close enough
---
Well that’s depressing
---
;-;
---
no subscriptions YET
---
\*private servers coming.
---
but im ready bring it on!
---
Since they haven't bothered replying to my support ticket about stuff I paid real world money for not working, it seems a bit much to expect us to do their work for them.
---
And thats why im talking about the regular price. I already got that promotion..............
---
i hope so
---
TELL ME DAMMIT!
---
lol
---
Can u explain
---
ITS HAPPENING!!!!!!

If it was a modded server I'd understand copying more as a "hey this character cannot be returned so we're giving you a copy of said character instead of losing all this hard work"
---
but I'd much rather directly have my source character in my own environment if I'm paying for it without the modded experience.
---
Yeah i decided to play again about a month ago. But after a week i stopped playing.  Theres no new content  that interests me. . Only atomic shop updates. When they bring in new stuff it comes along with bugs. For example the overpowered ghouls in WS. Probably because of the vault raids. Ghouls are stronger there but shouldnt affect other ghouls on the rest of the map. When they fix a, bug, old ones come back...  Its almost a year that this game existst and honestly. Things are changing slow. Theres no gain for high level players. I dont see the point in leveling up after getting above lvl 50 I will probably return when they bring in NPC's
---
I'm not sure if you are being sarcastic, but hosting isnt free
---
Must have been some crops or building materials from scraping in your camp
---
The great war..23rd October

well if you do a shotgun build you always have the option to switch to a heavy guns or melee build without trading many points. pistol build youre stuck with either semi or full auto pistols pretty much.

Why you meation? I wasn't talking about popularity.

Free cell clearly does. Those are good examples of tiny games.

haha you too my friend, funny I just saw you on my server at fort defiance
---
My team stays until the vault take u out.

Oooohhhh, I see what's going on now. Damn, I feel like an ass, sorry about that. Gamepass ultimate is $15, or $5 more than just having Live, I think my brain just autocorrected it one of those ways.
---
Bro I just logged back in for the first time since launch. I'm level 12 and honestly I'm kind of bored too. Everything is so tedious and I just dont feel like doing it..... I played fallout 4 for hundreds of hours. Same with 4 and new vegas etc etc.... this one just feels so dead. I started to build a camp which was one of my favorite things to do in 4 but I couldnt even finish one structure. I went and looked for wood for like an hour only to come back and not even be able to finish my roof. Not to mention I dont have plans to make shit either so I have a half built house with no furniture or front door.... so that's cool. I will most likely play it for a few more days and put it back down. So far in just not feeling it......
---
I can understand spending scrip being restricted to slow the market being flooded with legendary items but you should be able to scrap items for the scrip if they insiist on weight and stash limits. Set the 150 cap at the purveyor and not the legendary  vending machine....
---
Yah pretty much.... the mysterious large playerbase demanding more paid for utility content to be sold to us.  Ok, sure, Jan.
---
That's pretty good, considering if you were to host it on your own remote server it would cost a lot more. I often host my own games on a VM and it gets pretty pricey.
---
Oh hey, that was you? I was eating dinner lol
---
Do you use your current characters on the private servers? If you can them to maintain balance I suspect they would keep it all pretty much the same.  
---
I hope we get to mod the servers and it's all truly separate so we can change stuff like that. But I don't think it will be.
---
We’ve definitely known a Halloween event has been coming for a little while now. For some reason a lot of companies have been pretty slow with their Halloween events this year.
---
Ha!  
---
Honestly I don't think screenshots are necessary, as if someone is as interested as you on a smaller person by person basis, it just seems like Extra work...    
---
Maybe an Google doc like the one I started but listing each Primary Legendary effect for weapons and either "Meta", "meh" or "Junk" and something similar for Armor with Primary and Tertiary effects?
---
Oh huh i pay 5.. weird.
---
I'm also in NorCal. Where are you?
---
Character(s).
---
What game has free private servers?
---
What game has free private servers? Grow up.
---
I just want to be able to edit the rules for the server. No pacifist mode allowed, camp damage back on, place camp anywhere, increase build limit, things like that.
---
Maybe there's more than one type of Fixer. Because the Fixer I have is a suppressed combat rifle.
---
;-)
---
Its because servers cost money to host. Even with games like Minecraft, if you want a private server you've gotta pay.
---
Have you done the treasure maps yet?  I have a billion maps saved up for a rainy day activity.  I also am on a hunt for radium rifle mods (which probably means making and scrapping a ton of them) which probably means a billion springs, screws, nuclear wate needs to be gathered.
---
I also just started a new alt character and am trying a shotgun build this time around (now that plastic is not a problem).  Plus I have to do the nightmare tadpole events again to get the backpack for this new alt.
---
i get it. i can only login and cash in crap weapons for the next week or so then log out because i spent 1000 scrip in 1 hit now can't run or fast travel because i am 300 pounds overweight with rubbish and can't offload it fast enough, can't even sell the ok stuff because of max caps. There is too many artificial barriers which seem to be there to just drip feed enjoyment gradually but it is wearing thin.
---
Took me way too long to realize you meant in the Fallout timeline.
---
I'm fairly sure those won't be involved in anyway on the Halloween event.
---
I think I recently moved most of mine to one char, I remember I had had about 600. I think I've done the full nuclear surprise(4k/5k candy or something like that) once or twice.
---
They should bring it back in a sweet gardening bundle with usable planter pots!
---
I see syringer ammo everywhere and I haven't touched one in 6+ months. Maybe you just ignored it before?
---
Did you miss the fact they took out the Survival mode in its entirety ?
---
tomorrow
---
I used up all mine for a challenge a while back. Good idea, I'd like to be able to give guests food and drink in some similar way.
---
Plot twist: its bethesda doing the duping and selling it all on the black market to make that easy cash.
---
Yeah that works but feels kinda funny if you’re the toon doing it.
---
The vaultsuit is considered underarmor. There's jumpsuits, army fatigues and a few others you can wear underneath too
---
Berserker, junkie noctural are all 50%.
---
So you say bloodied is 100%(actually more due to other things but yeah the legendary effect)
---
So, just correct the bloodied to be 50% like everything else.
---
Yeah Hazmat should drop as legendary too. But a lot of players would not want that, because they won't use it anyway. And that 5x agility sounds quite absurd. Of course you aren't talking about agility. 3x would be more reasonable. 2x much more likely.
---
My vibe is now off tbh can I get a vibe check
---
What is A&amp;W and what does 100 years have to do with Fallout?
---
&gt;Don’t think it’s a bug, since a piece breaking mid fight could “strand” a player(weight reduction)
---
Oh jeez. Just amazing logic. And weapon breaking mid fight should continue firing because else it could “strand” a player.
---
But right now they stop firing and become unequiped so it's obviously weapons have this nasty bug currently.
---
On the comment you deleted you were replying to a guy talking about server tools to host your own server, there was nothing about p2p/listen servers.
---
Last time I opened a ticket they were pretty quick to tell me my 2080 Ti didn't meet minimum spec.
---
&gt;The problem with duping is they only have one of two options to figure out how its being done  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;Hire somebody full time to sit and hack the gameGet one of the dupers to disclose their method
---
Or:
---
* Make a technically sound game to begin with that isn't full of bugs a year after launch.
---
Always in the sack bro never forget, invest in property make money peace brother
---
Did you scan and repair?  Maybe you're having connectivity issues?
---
(Maybe they need to actually connect the people having the problems with people capable of fixing them?)
---
What’s your favorite song?
---
You could use a world box like a lunch box, tool box, golf bag etc... but outside of that, yes. It has to be in the bag. I used to have a golf bag next to my camp. I put signs on my camo that said "free loot' with a marquee arrow pointing to it.
---
I’d join if you were PC. Worthy quest. I wish you good fortune.
---
I really dont think we are getting private servers. I think we are getting "private servers" that are just solo sharded server slices shared with 1000s of other players
---
Such a good ideA! Thanks!
---
Gary!
---
What

Rippi In Kippi

Bombs are pretty Shitty
---
My main character rolls bloodied and explosive all day on some servers.  There's no way that's a coincidence.  Idc what you claim about it being statistically significant, blah blah blah.  I'm not just lucky, I have something else going for me.  The level of luck I get on my rolls is nigh impossible, so nobody gets to tell me there's no seed or something causing such good rolls.
---
?
---
2 daily quests
---
It's because the patch is happening on wednesday instead of the usual tuesday. We'll see new items in tomorrow. I wasn't in a rush to spend my Atoms, anyway.
---
Love it in theory. Dunno how that’d work in practice.
---
I just took notice of the name and then realized you were next on my shopping route but you logged. I'll friend you for later when we have power again lol
---
so what you're saying is, they should eliminate the cooldown period on launching nukes for the whole day tomorrow
---
Maybe I just got lucky?
---
About 2.5k scrip spent, zero keepers.
---
No. It increases Agility +4 and reduces fall damage but it decreases your strength by 4. Or by 1 assuming you have the mutations perk cards.
---
It's all that Texas oil money! YEEEEEEEEEHAW
---
I swear to fucking god if wastelanders was delayed for more NW bullshit.
---
No, but I believe it reduces strength. If you have Class Freak 3, that’s negligible. It does help reduce fall damage, which is quite helpful if you have Marsupial.
---
Adamantium skeleton perk should save you here, but someone with research would better answer.
---
Some enemies move pretty quickly and can outrun the radius of a mine before it detonates.
---
Servers fill up pretty quickly, but you often see the same players in every match. Most people play it just to get the cosmetic items. It's pretty easy by the way, even if you're bad at shooters. The idea is to simply survive as long as possible, which means it's possible to consistently get in 2nd place without firing a shot.
---
All of that armor is purely cosmetic, for what it's worth, so there's no drawback to not wearing it if you *do* want to see your layered armor and under-armor.
---
Grass Valley
---
that i do, and ye losing 1 strength in exchange is nbd. the tooltip only lists the +4 agi/+4 str, but wanted to be fully sure before I pop the serum lol. thanks for a speedy answer!
---
Yeah it’s better than paying up to 100 scrip for them :p
---
U need starch genes maxed or u can kiss thoes mutations good bye once u use a radway of any type.
---
Lol, I apparrently just raised your likes from 1.6k to 1.7k.  Great story!  I'm assuming you just logged out before the nuke hit?
---
No thanks. I like being able to tweak and customize my build as I go. That’s one of the more challenging but rewarding parts of the game.
---
If u havent seen any new free items for 4 weeks then you dont play enough.
---
I rolled all 3 star and about half of my first 1000 scrip were great.  As in, stuff like instigating explosive pump shotgun, aae pipe bolt, bloodied limb damage hunting rifle, qaud5090 assaultron head, vampire fixer, be15 lever, etc.  My other character wasn't quite as lucky with their 1000 but I did still get 2 ok fixers.
---
How do u know this?
---
It makes for a great scrip.
---
They have a separate team working on Nuclear Winter. Which also doesn't really need the same attention as Wastelanders; I doubt Nuclear Winter has quest designers, level designers, creature artists, and writers busting their ass.
---
Non ark is pay 2 play so is minecraft because to keep servers live that requiers $$$. Like one players said a few days ago. Its like a customer going to mc donnalds and ordering chicken nugets. Then when they ask for your money. You say nah give them to me free your good for it you got alot of money.
---
Maybe they are putting all their effort on the upcoming halloween items.
---
Its all Ui based if the ui can see them then the compass marks it.
---
Well, depends if it was a beta vending machine. Hehe
---
Looking forward to a cool skin for the black powder tomorrow
---
Yes a VE mini gun will work with heavy gunner perks, and while the healing will be crazy you might find your dmg a bit lacking. You might be a bit better off with a BE 50 cal. The dmg is significantly higher, though the ammo is a bit more expensive
---
Ve minigun is good I run one myself but as for high ap not too sure I run a bloodied pa build with emergency protocol and use a bfr 50cal
---
Outfits cover armor and underarmor. Vault suits are considered to be underarmor.
---
I mean it’s up to you as to how far to push your project. The downside I see right off the bat is substantiated evidence. Public doubt and denial will always be a thorn in your side without a pile of evidence to toss on the table.
---
The vault was opened 100 years after it's closing. A&amp;W is just a burger joint
---
Yupppp. Minnesota 😂
---
Not very socially aware are you?
---
I actually got one tonight!
---
So we like bbq or something?
---
In terms of integrity, the only way that I can see that being the case whilst also dealing with the small sample problem is with a mod with open source code &amp; publically available that can be independently verifiable.
---
The idea would be similar to programs that already exist that track user data, for example CCG card/pack trackers that are used from a variety of things from card/deck win rates to drop rates of certain cards.
---
Otherwise, you've have to record unedited video like on twitch. Doesn't solve the small sample issue but at least people can verify the spreadsheet data with the video.
---
 Fix the damn Trading Glitch, this has been going on for too long.
---
I'm going to buy a 70" TV.
---
suppose those neo-nazis despise non-nazis 
---
equality
---
Ehhh, in my POV it just ends the stupidity.  Not worth worrying about.  Call them out and it's done.  Move on.  There are infinite encounters to come.  To be clear; it's a game.
---
Don’t jinx it…
---
The id would just be a hexadecimal number as well.
---
Best advice I can give you is to get over it. Maybe be a good little authoritarian and report them and attempt to shame or damage them in the public square. There's lots of people, lots of perspectives and lots of bad ideologies to go with them. If you keep letting things bother you and training yourself to look for them (even where they're actually not. "Table Grapes") you'll end up frothing at the mouth like a rabid dog.
---
and seeds for the birdies
---
30 atoms per day or so
---
That straight jacket farm has been my cap collecting bread n butter
---
Only reporting blatant cheaters. These folks... yeah, they just make me very sad (or I might induce some damage to their camps, with known repercussions).
---
Weapons should stay weapons imo. Then you can sell many more skins if you have more weapons.
---
Just like the fridge. I don't understand why they didn't do it like the back pack. They would have sold way more if they sold fridge skins instead of the fridge itself.
---
with 40 stimpacks, and a 2shot explosive 50cal, and a meta build to match, and lastly 1000 to 1500 50 cal rounds, you can solo encrypted... done it multiple times... and less robots spawn when u alone it is totally doable... find a server with mostly lo level players and you are good to go.... got both the imposter helmet today and at least 7 by now of the fixer plans
---
I have a vague feeling one of the watchtowers has been decorated like that for a long time. But that costume poster might be some kind of easter egg thingy. the vampire costume has been seen before in the AS, but the soldier ones hasnt. hopefully we get some new stuff in todays update.
---
No idea what y....
---
Report it to Bethesda. They absolutely act on hate speech in player usernames.
---
The bombs dropped on the 23rd of October, a lot of places were already decorated for Halloween. Kinda surprised there are people that play the game and didn't already know this.
---
But it is Oct 23 2102. We haven't "left" that day yet. We're pretty much in a time warp until things start again.
---
Everyday I learn new things 👍
---
Have you played Fallout 76?
---
[This](https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/6272/?) is the fix for that in Fallout 4, would be nice if it was added to Fallout 76.
---
Those two mines will also eventually expire and just dissapear. It's something like 3-10 mins.
---
... and 58 more years until the bombs drop.
---
A lot of people are expecting something to celebrate the day (which is today!) in the update.
---
Oh it's not really useful. 
---
Also some mines have explosive radius much larger than the trigger radius. Plus once triggered there is still the delay. While the first layed mine explodes instantly when a third mine is dropped.
---
So you don’t have a raider gang making you not a raider?
---
Duping.
---
I gave up at 50 about 3 weeks after the game released.
---
I actually had 15 of them but I got rid of those too and still had issues.  
---
It's just the max stash weight thing is killing me.  I've always played this game to collect everything I could, same with similar games, Skyrim, Kingdom Come, etc. I'd steal anything not nailed down.  
---
I imagine the max weight is some economy limiting thing, but it's really just sucked all my enjoyment out of the game because I spend more time fighting it than I do the mobs.
---
Run heavy gun myself and also have the 50 cal BFFR, but BE, VE or VFFR could probably work as well
---
I thought the private servers are something you can host yourself.
---
Some serums go from 150-400 caps plus at player vendors. You just have to find one.
---
Watoga HS has been ready for Halloween since beta haha
---
That doesn’t happen and no ones job at Bethesda is to collect whiny shit posts and show it to their boss lol
---
Not relevant to this sub.
---
Thank you. Everyone on here praises it like it’s better than any battle royale haha
---
I play stealth commando on one character and I've found that the extra damage from stealth attacks is what makes it more viable as far as ammo goes by not needing nearly as many shots. I'll also melee lower level trash mobs to conserve ammo. Heavy gunner in nice in that the 5mm and 50cal. gets made in much larger batches. I also tagged lead for searching and accumulate lead pretty quickly as well as acid, cloth, steel, and gunpowder. It's the stealth attack damage that makes it work for me though. I'll also pick up and sell things in the world and buy ammo here and there from players. Good luck.
---
God shut up. Why do you people have to defend Bethesda like they’re your dad??
---
I guess this is what Bethesda meant when they said "we plan on reworking parts of the Challenge and reward system next year to be clearer, more fun, and more impactful for all types of players.".
---
Lucky us though, they were able to fast track all that fun and impact from last year to now...
---
Has Bethesda remembered *any* lore consistencies?
---
Great work, much better results than my survey so far (i.e., what does "all scrip" mean in terms items and effects ???)!
---
I think the extremely unlucky and extremely lucky accounts are really interesting and perhaps further details could rule out some effects:
---
* Do you regularly play and farm with these two accounts? *(Theory: frequented/influencer accounts get distribution adjustments.)*
---
* Do you regularly team up with your accounts? *(Theory: team contrast trick in F2P games like why the rest of the team gets good loot but you don't or vice versa.)*
---
* Do you keep inventories with the good stuff on them or do they hold onto mixed stuff? *(Theory: preferential drop or pity drop.)*
---
* Have you been complaining to Beth about the drops with a particular account? *(Theory: after many of my roundups indicating bias, I'm almost certain they changed my account's distribution, including overall armor-melee-ranged split, as I saw uniform distribution post P12 in all aspects, making further data collection pointless.)*
---
* I suppose your main (unlucky) account is the oldest; is the lucky one recent? *(Theory: old accounts did not get distribution readjustments or the failed/would have gotten corrupted for some reason and Beth left them as they were.)*
---
At this point, we don't really know what's going on the server (I don't believe any client-side datamining would be much revealing). Also sometimes it feels presuming any elaborate drop scheme is giving too much credit to Beth's abilities and diligence given the vast amount of bugs. Consequently, I'm sure many modders looked at Fallout 4's legendary system so maybe that could hold some (actual client-side) clues:
---
* What pseudo-RNG was Fallout4.exe using, i.e., the C++ standard library one or a custom one?
---
* How were those RNG numbers applied to select the drop and its properties? Was there a script that did this?
---
* Was there a seed/custom distribution in Fo4's drop lists or items discovered?
---
No it wasn't. Vault 76 opened after 25 years, 5 years later than planned. Didn't you follow the overseer? She left her fiance outside. She visited her home, school and university.
---
How do you hate br games but love the absolute worst one on the market? I mean, play what you enjoy, but I just don’t understand
---
My guy...I feel so stupid. I have 5 in there. May atom bless you
---
Same with the enclave underarmour it goes through some outfits including the one I wanna wear the imposter sheepsquatch outfit but I cant cuz of this bug
---
Yeah, but you know those games are eventually gonna piss everyone off like this one has and like Fallout 4 ended up doing. It’s not good for the future, cause Bethesda’s good will fell hard
---
Meh Refuse to spend over 200 caps.
---
For what? How do you need that much? Haha
---
the only bomb was this game on launch
---
&gt;Even then, it'll only be PC-specific data but still.
---
The servers are all PCs. Why would they be any different when the game version is same for all platforms?
---
Is the door still broken on it (where it sits halfway up into the frame) because they didn't move the frame down from where the concrete foundation was previously?
---
Have you tried unarmed? Put yourself at 45% health with dead man sprinting, some unyielding armor and bolstering along with radicool and you will basically be fast as fuk and one shot everything. Use a shotgun with enforcer to force the dragons to land and you have a fast paced play style that’s puts you on easy mode. No ammo to worry about and unarmed weapons use very little resources to repair. Plus all your stims and rad aways can get diluted so you always have more than you need.
---
I've had this happen to but I never collect it anyway. I'm just tryin to get that plasma grenade plan.
---
Could you look around with the mouse or did the whole game freeze for 2-3 seconds? See if you ALT+TAB out and press the same keys in Notepad they still work, ruling out a hardware issue.
---
People have been having issues with that one since that content originally came out, unfortunately.
---
Ill give you a mutation, for 201 caps.
---
what did you start last week?
---
Wow! Really? I wonder if it's possible on a lever action or handmade..
---
Kinda. I think the original story was either an exaggeration or an outlier. Losing unstarred legendaries didn’t help, but you can definitely find rare servers that are unusually heavy on legendary enemies.
---
One time about a month ago I farmed a wolf horde in the Savage Divide that was spitting out legendaries like candy, but the average is possibly one extra if you let the horde continue. If I don’t get an extra in the first three waves, I move on to greener pastures.
---
You can usually tell pretty quickly when you join a hot server, because there will be tons of legendaries everywhere. Usually it’s limited to a specific enemy type, like ghouls or animals, but very rarely it’s like the spawn rate is broken and you’re getting 10x the normal rate no matter where you go. 
---
If a Whitespring loop pays off unusually well for you, it’s a good idea to hit every other ghoul heavy location on the map and stay on that server for as long as possible if they also pay out well.
---
&gt; All the content so far has been free
---
That's the biggest lie of all. So far the content cost whatever you paid for the game plus any atoms you've purchased since. If zero people paid for Atoms, do you think we'd have any of this "free" content?
---
So let's not get too sanctimonious about people's expectations on wanting content or value for money. Yes, it can get over the top, granted. However, it's not unreasonable to for people to expect regular content for a LIVE. SERVICE. GAME. 
---
Also, Bethesda hasn't even delivered on their own roadmap. They've only given us a little over half the content that they promised this year. If they cannot fulfil what they promised and have delayed it until next year, it's not too unreasonable to ask for content in the meantime.
---
Yes, they can stop playing, like I did months ago. Though, I'm not so up myself to look down on them for asking for expecting for content in lieu of the stuff that they failed to deliver as promised.
---
Hmm I guess it's possible to have decent AP with heavy guns. Theres only a few perks you would want in agility: adrenaline 5, and dodgy 3. Maybe switch out dodgy for thru hiker, born survivor might be useful as well. More than that would probably be wasted perk slots. 
---
Get the birdbones mutation, it gives +4 agility, that will boost your AP. Avoid scaly skin mutation, that will decrease it. A gun with +1 agility would help a bit. 
---
Vats is useless with heavy guns, each shot takes way too much AP.
---
If you want AP so you can run for a long time, look into the power armor mods, like optimized servos for decreased sprint cost, and core assembly for increased AP regen.
---
Vampires stuff is good if you wanna be tanky, but your gonna use alot more ammo because you wont be doing as much damage.
---
 The minigun is solid with the tri-barrel mod, but the shortened barrel that increases fire rate would be better for vampires effect.
---
The .50 mg is the best heavy imo, ammo efficient, high dps, accurate with stabilized perk. You cannot go wrong with the .50cal
---
 The lmg is really good as well but that gun is a constant grind for ammo and I think it loses out dps wise to the .50 because of the reload. This one is the most fun to shoot to me, this one is my favorite if you can forget how terrible grinding ammo is. If you ever get one of these, prime it and craft ultracite .308, thank me later.
---
Gatling laser is really cheap on ammo with the right perks, but lackluster damage, might be good with vampires because of the rate of fire. 
---
Gatling plasma melts enemies if your spec'd right. This gun was the most powerful heavy gun and it might still be.
---
Gatling gun sucks. Lol sorry gatling gun users but the damage on this thing is terrible and its only saving grace is that it is arguably(gatling laser) the most ammo efficient gun on the list. It is very accurate though, its like a sniper rifle without a scope if you fire 1 shot. It does high damage per bullet, but terrible dps compared to the others.
---
If you want to do vampires, get a gun with a high rate of fire, anything with faster fire rate as a secondary will be a god roll for that build. If you feel like your not doing enough damage look into your build and squeeze more damage perks into yours, drop the fat.  Then maybe look into some new weapons: furious, junkies, executioners.
---
It's not really a glitch. The horde boss should replace any minions that are killed, and they have a chance at being legendary. Still worked when I tried a few days ago.
---
Imagine you won't be able to do that. Probably be able to use a copy of your live character in private servers but not vice versa.
---
Lmao
---
Yogi
---
Which mutation do you want?
---
The serum plans are something useful to dump caps on, serums are cheap af and every second vendor has them for a couple hundred caps.
---
Carnivore and scaly skin. They cost so much tht i might just buy the plans on eBay.
---
Try deleting the ini  files  and launching. This happend to me when I switched from borderless windows to full screen
---
If you’re on PC I can give you a carnivore serum for free. Don’t have scaly skin.
---
What's the point in duping mines? Found 800 of them in whitesprings train station a couple weeks ago.
---
I have no idea why is this suggestion getting downvoted…
---
Yes, i am on pc. I won't be able to get online for at least a week. However my brother would gladly help me as soon as tomorrow.
---
Do you have healing factor
---
Yup. Ok ign is the same as here, have him add me and I’ll get you one of each.
---
Damn... fine! How dare you bribe me.
---
Idk about that...I always see the majority of people selling serums for 350 up to 500 caps each. On a rare occasion, do I see them 150 to 250.
---
Place the crop in dirt, then put floor on top, then a bathrub. Might take a while to make it look good, but it's possible for the taller plants
---
Holy shit thanks man. Are sure that's nothing in return?
---
What time zone are you in and what time will you be on??
---
No worries. I’m in GMT, will be on in a few hours, gotta do some work first :)
---
I dont understand people that play a game constantly for this long... 
---
I mean i spend about 3k hours between Fallout 3, NV and 4 and another 2k just on Skyrim, but that is over all the time since its released in generaly 100h bursts or so but not continuously... i would die if i played those games every day for this long.
---
Why do people think a game can even sustain that amount of constant play time?
---
Yes pls
---
Sounds more like work than playing a game...
---
Ill have him look for you tomorrow. We are in pst time zone. Just name a time past 12 pm pst and hr will met you on
---
Thanks man!!!!
---
Agreed! I have challenges from the beginning that are still bugged like the magazine ones and discover abandoned bog town for the cranberry bog one. Then there’s the weekly and dailies that decide when they want to work. It’s all on purpose though, they don’t even want you to have the free 10 cents worth of atoms for killing a legendary enemy at night while wearing pajamas while diseased while wielding a max level handmade as a female character. These challenges are grindy and bugged. We paid $60 for this game...
---
Add me WillTodd
---
It depends. I usually don’t have any issues when I play. I have the 2 minute queue in the vault which is fine because it gives me time to explore. Usually finds a match instantly.
---
My son and me team up almost daily. He s 19 and lives 40 miles away so it’s a great way to stay in touch and bond with him. Makes the gaming experience 100x better. Rather we run nukes or jump into NW we have a literal blast. Starting to see the dad/son teams a lot more lately and it’s great! Keep it up dad and kudos to you sir.
---
I dunno, "just get over it" is one way of going about things, I guess. But I hardly think the guy is 'frothing at the mouth like a rabid dog' just because he's pointing it out. But then you think reporting swastikas is being 'a good little authoritarian' so, y'know...
---
Here's an alternate view. Rather than stick your head in the sand and 'just get over' neonazi symbols, just report and move on. No frothing, no bother, no hassle.
---
Where are they located?
---
Sample size. Sample size. Sample size.
---
There are, going by the fandom wiki, 18 primary, 11 secondary and 13 tertiary legendary effects for armor; 18/4/6 for melee weapons and 22/7/9 for ranged weapons. Having just 170 weapon pulls and 200 armor pulls in total is far, far too small a sample to even begin speculating about the drop chances on anything close to a solid factual basis.
---
I also find it telling that you get the most extreme results on accounts with small sample sizes, and you get more average results on the one with the largest sample size. The google search term of the day therefor is "regression to the mean".
---
Put up a wiki. Let people add their drops to a list, differentiated by ranged weapons, melee weapons and armor. Track the total number of drops for each legendary effect, separated by those three categories. Trust people not to lie to you. \*shrug\* The GuildWars 2 wiki has been doing drop rate research like this for years.
---
And for the love of the deity of your choice, stop speculating about insane ideas like account seeds and character seeds until you have good, solid data in the hundreds of thousands of drops. Here is a hint for why I think this idea is insane: it adds huge complexity and execution time to a code path  - random number generation - that is run millions of times per hour on each server, and all for absolutely no gain whatsoever. Random number generators are a relatively well-understood phenomenon. Implementing fast pseudo-RNGs that are good enough for production use in an MMO is something even the people at Bethesda should bloody well know how to do.
---
TL;DR: does Bethesda muck around with the drop tables? Yes, we know that (re: limb damage), and I'd love to see the actual drop distribution for legendary effects. Is there any evidence that they tweak the drop results during purveyor events or have account or character based RNG seeds? Nope.
---
Sorry American Russian and even middle eastern commandos or military trained specialised squads are just as bad and have prob done more unsung in reported damage to the lives of their so called enemies : get over it : it’s a symbol
---
I don’t think it’s the worst on the market. I would say that is fortnite. 
---
As I don’t really like the genre I haven’t played a ton of others but here is what I like:
---
-map design is top notch
---
-blending things core fallout 76 elements like radiation, nukes, perks, weapon variety, ability to use photo mode for recon, etc works well
---
-ability to blueprint structures in adventure and bring into NW for quick base building 
---
-vault 51 is a lot of fun to explore and lore is cool
---
-it feels rewarding
---
-balance is great IMO. I don’t have any issue making it to final circle. A variety of play-styles can succeed.
---
Great post and very interesting thread 
---
I love statistics and appreciate the amount of work, time and expertise required
---
Thank you
---
I think it's mainly good in PVP against melee VATS users.
---
The cloaking effect should stop them chaining hits on you, allowing you to not be staggered, VATS targeted, etc.
---
Yeah why think, when you can post and upvote?
---
Also FWIW, I spend 1600 scrip on 2\* ranged during the sale with one character. I haven't really logged what I got and I'm not into those meta builds either. From memory
---
**Kept**: F10 50 Cal, Troubleshooter's FFR Gatling Gun
---
**Sold**: 3 instigating rifles, 3 bloodied rifle/heavys, 3 explosive, 3 furious rifles, 2 AA guns, 1 FE Minigun\*, 1 Mutant slayer's Explosive Gatling Gun\*\*. Generally: Miniguns, radium rifles, combat rifles, combat shotguns, hunting rifles, Gatling guns, Gatling plasmas).
---
(\*: ammo waste, sold well. \*\* I already had this specific gun)
---
The rest were uninteresting prefixes and haven't noticed any increase in Nocturnal per-se but a slight oddity with Berserkers (I wear 0 armor under PA). There was no overwhelming Bash/limb damage like around P12 either.
---
I really hope your are wrong..for the sake of fairness.
---
However. Its very likely you are correct.
---
They probably did it so they can use voice lines from FO4.
---
Getting good and close with a big screen is nearing on vr but without the headache or nausea. And don't worry about GPU horsepower, you *will* crash down to 40fps when you walk in to a camp.
---
My copy of Dungeon Siege 3 would like a word with you about Obsidian not letting us down lol
---
My eldest boy is great fun to team with, hearing him giggle as he shotguns the car that I'm running passed is something *special*....
---
To each their own.
---
Y’all gonna hate me, but fortnite is the genre defining br. They breathe new life into the game constantly and always listen to what people think needs rework and what people want to buy. I hate Epic as a company, probably more than Bethesda, but there’s a reason fortnite remains on top. Where as F76 is janky, frustrating, broken trash that constantly disregards the playerbase. But it’s janky, frustrating, broken trash that we keep playing cause we love fallout.
---
I would agree if that was the only way to get them but you can also get them in game... So yeah it's like most things in life either have them delivered and pay extra or go get them yourself...
---
I think this would work only if put into the wastlander dlc. Make the plans no-drop but you can craft Mods to sell. Currently the market is oversaturated with plans, this would counter that, though in a different way, one that would be more friendly to vendors and sellers as well as buyers.
---
PSN Passion4TheHunt, feel free to add me. play almost daily
---
Unless it's spoilable food, it should not vanish
---
I find fortnite boring.
---
I can craft *nearly* everything, so that would be great. I don't need caps, so I'd be happy selling cheap calibrated shocks, etc.
---
Sell to vendors?
---
I don't have everything but like, I know how hard it is to trust someone with your triple star legacy, instead of basically having a 75% chance of getting scammed it'd be so much easier to just produce the mods they want and sell them off.
---
That and like why don't we have an item for item trading interface yet? Trading a weapon for 0 caps and having it get swiped is like so fucking stupid tbh.
---
Yep
---
Lmao, you're the one making a baseless claim so the burden of proof is on you fella.
---
Saw something very similar but with throwing knives. A tree next to some dudes camp was literally spitting them out on the ground, must have been a pile of at least 500 lol.
---
If you just hide the whole time I guess. You say it’s boring but we’re on a sub for a game were the entire endgame is collecting the best gear to...   collect more best gear haha
---
Lol. Nobody is buying the collectron or fridge because they think they are necessary. They are a novelty.
---
Mine sends me messages through out our work day on improving game play and ideas he has for making our team better. They’ll turn out to be great adults and won’t forget old dad and the fun we’ve had with them.
---
That will not happen. That would break their core principles as they outlined. You may have zero faith but they were clear that items like legendaries are a no no.
---
My documents my games 76 delete both then try launching
---
I mean, it's their gamertag not something in their camp so Bethesda cant do anything about it and there's no way to prove that's what they meant to do. They can just ban people for having a certain combination of numbers in their GT. I dont agree with bigotry, racism, or sexism but its all still technically part of freedom if speech I guess as long they arent hurting anyone.
---
On xbox it's not uncommon to find a camp with EVERY type of serum for sale for 300 caps each
---
I play games to get things done not loligag around like some dragonborn. Gotta keep being productive.
---
I hope you are joking lol. If you aren’t, I hope you know you can repair stuff at a bench for free.
---
When ever i see them i snatch them up and go sell to vendor for 500 caps, any time i see below 400 i buy them and will buy them all. Since i started this i make my cap limit everyday on all 10 of my alts characters. Its a good way to make cap limit and its easy.
---
That’s not what I do endgame and I have 560+ hours in. Honestly I don’t see the appeal of fortnite. Maybe I’m just an old man. Seems too cartoony with little depth.
---
Nah, because you tagged more than 3 people in one comment, so now Reddit is blocking the outgoing notification anyway. That's an anti-harassment measure. So your comment really is pointless.
---
Would love to see a vid of that if at all possible.
---
I have all kinds of issues killing them on my stealth rifle build, for a variety of reasons, and usually I can't be bothered.
---
My heavy build kills them in a few seconds.
---
Honestly I think I'd like to have the colour coded item system in regular Adventure Mode as well. It'd make it a bit easier to scroll through to specific items and in a vendor menu providing we can still see an items colour. 
---
Plus it might stop player vendors from selling junk weapons for thousands of caps just because it's a Legendary.
---
Just take pic or video report and move on they will get kicked off and it will be a better world
---
No. The Fixer is a unique combat rifle. Why would a completely different weapon use the same name?
---
If they sell you what you want they can't sell you stuff you don't want, but buy anyway because the stuff you actually want isn't available and it's still the best on offer. They'll let you upgrade gradually from least wanted to most wanted stuff so they can sell you novelty every step of the way. They don't want satisified customers, but constantly hungry ones.
---
Definitely
---
I got my gatling plasma prime receiver at watoga
---
The support team is busy working on Todd Howard's new yacht and will be back next quarter.
---
Also play as a Stealth Commando build, definitely recommend taking advantage of stealth and VATS in the earlier stages, will help you save on ammo and deal a little extra damage. In the late game you’ll be able to focus on ammo and accumulate enough via killing mobs and buying from vendors. In the meantime just try to use a weapon with really common ammo, also recommend keeping a backup shotgun or other high damage weapon you don’t need to invest points into just in case you want to save on ammo against weaker enemies.
---
Its not hadware issue, I can use the mouse freely and the keyboard works fine when alt tabbed.
---
I don't understand all the fuss around "seeds". **Even if** your character or your account had a unique seed, that's the starting point of a random number generator. That's it. It doesn't change what legendary affixes you get. The **random number** chooses the affix, not the RNG seed...
---
The actual serums are like 200-400 caps from player vendors. Serums are only worthwhile if you want to sell them. Even then, you need to sell over 100 to make you money back.
---
I like marsupial so far .I currently have twisted muscles but I'm not sure if I want to keep it permanently , the melee attacks are great.
---
Almost every game is buy to play in some form or another, how about u spend a few years developing and marketing a game and then just give it away. I would rather pay for a game then have ads plastered all over just so i get it for free. Maybe tomorrow u should go to work and tell ur boss this is a free one and  not get paid for doing ur job. People always bitchen about having to pay for shit, dont play and dont want it and u have no worries.
---
Whenever I do Encryptid I always concentrate on the imposter - don't bother with the robots unless they are in my face or a Legendary pops up.
---
But it's all about the Imposter - why else would you do it?
---
Is thy really what robots buy them for? Crap
---
I don't understand. Bethesda's servers are machines running a service software. What prevents you from using your computer as that machine? It's ran independently of the game. You just connect your game to that server.
---
Why are Americans so sensitive
---
Yea people dupe them and then scrap them. This needs to be fixed. Don’t get me wrong, if I see 1000 meat cleavers on the ground I will pick them up but it’s breaking the game
---
Looks like you had an encounter with the Fallout incarnation of Sanguine.
---
Be grateful that you didn't wake up from your stupor to your newly wed Scorchbeast wife.
---
Out of curiousity, what's your SPECIAL?  (native and modified)
---
Just as an anecdote on the matter of certain characters getting certain drops, during the 50% sale one of my mules pulled the same 2* legendary arm 3 times in a row. With different stats (leather, raider, etc) but identical legendary values.
---
Totally get the idea behind it, but part of the beauty of a Fallout game is being able to build up a character from scratch and make them work. I think it’s important for players to learn how to build there character to their specific needs. Will admit Bethesda doesn’t do a good job helping them though, remember literally getting headaches trying to plan out my build in a notebook during the BETA lol.
---
Well, you're not wrong.
---
Do the archer athlete and mammalogist challenges easy peasy
---
No idea, only been there a few times.
---
I enjoy exploring vs alwase having to find a work bench plus at the end of each day. I just go bk to whitesprings bulk all the crap and sell it to the npc's. Witch equile less time wasted.
---
This guy story modes.
---
It’s just a solid shooter with an interesting art style and character design plus the unique building (which 76 tried to copy)
---
*Presses F to pay respects*  
---
***world crashes***  
---
[](/celestiahurt)
---
I’ve been sniped in the head before. Absolutely sucks lol. I was having the best match ever and the BANG!
---
I think it would create an imbalance in the rarity of plans and mods, which already feels quite thoroughly thought out
---
Smart thunking gamer
---
For adventure mode the event was mentioned either last week or the week before
---
I saw that too, made me decide to actually build a cool camp instead of some walls and crafting stuff
---
Day -14 signing in.
---
What about the adventure xp and rewards? Any rewards can be used on any of your characters.
---
The bombs dropped before Halloween. Do people pay any sort of attention to the lore at all ?
---
I played about 50 games. Every time I waited about 7-10 minutes to find lobby and than another 5-7 minutes to start the match. My match time is about 15 minutes every time(I'm hiding in the bushes). It seems to that my play time and my waiting time are equal.
---
76 has same building mechanics as FO4... they did not copy fortnite...
---
I can’t even remember the players name as he caught me taking the photo, then left the game.
---
That’s absurd. Have you played since they combined servers? I’ve never had to wait more than a minute to find a match.
---
Well, I suppose that's just how the cookie crumbles.
---
Great state. I visited Minneapolis for a weekend and it’s a really fun city. Fargo is also an excellent TV show.
---
There are World of Warcraft private server...sure, they are not official, but you can mod them
---
There are also Minecraft private servers...or DayZ...I also think that GTA V or GTA Online has private servers
---
If there would be a local server installation, so you can host a server on your own hardware, it would not be required to pay for maintenance...and servers could be free
---
One one end it can be seen as a hate symbol but long before it was given the swastika name it was once a symbol used by people in the buda and india religons as a symbol for good luck. As the rebel flag existed log b4 the kkk was founded but after they stole that flag its been a mark of hate ever since.
---
Personal camps are over rated ;)  
---
Player vending had made things a lot easier, travel to somebody else's camp and use all their benches and rad shower.  
---
Also let's a handful of level 8-15 to get murdered by the mole miners outside WS when the camp logs out due to getting attacked.
---
Not going to lie, you'll get the same type of feedback there that you'll get here.
---
The forum is just another form of the sub when it comes down to it.
---
Okay. Do you have any keyboard macro program running? Do you run in fullscreen or windowed mode? Do you run on desktop resolution? Do you run any other application (Discord, OBS studio) at the same time that would steal the focus from the game?
---
Many people enjoy the game and don't pay attention to the lore because many people are yelling everywhere that it's not canon. To me, the way they explained the lore, it makes sense.
---
And non-unarmed 1-handed melees
---
Yeah, you can sell them to vendors for 400 to 500.
---
BTW, I make them on one character, put most in my vendor but actually carry a few grounded ones for when I want to use the flamer or cryo instead of the gatling or .50 cal...
---
I also have two characters I'm using very light mutations on and no class freak.
---
And, given lack of cap sinks in the endgame really considering making and storing empathy and hard mentality serums and picking that up on everyone.
---
But that's mostly a factor of end game cap spend.
---
Wasn't aware this was going on, thanks for enlightening me. I'll be sure to avoid those players, trolls or not.
---
Yeah but it's a dick move to all the non PA players
---
Well when Epic Game did it, BGS stated that they would like to but Sony were not helping. Now that Sony worked on it, they may put some ressources on it.
---
Yes. I was surprised too. 
---
The long story is that since I heard that Wastlanders are delayed I decided to grind NW just to reach level 100 and unlock all the cosmetics. I'm not a Battle Royal player. PvE and adventure mode is my place.  
---
I tried Friday Saturday and Sunday. I played from 10 am until 10 pm. 
---
Waiting time was just terrible.
---
I have all 19 mutant serum recipes, i used to farm, make them and sell to vendor bot and in my machines, found it easier to farm players who sell for under 400. 400 is my max buy i really shoot for 300 and under. Yes bots buy for 488.
---
I’d use suppressor just for the stealth bonus
---
I hope they don't add big cities, i feel like it would ruin the wilderness aspect
---
If u cant handle pvp then stay in passive and stop crying.or unistall do everyone that favor.
---
Are you using left on the Dpad or up?
---
Don’t build your home base on a workshop ever. Workshops are PvP zones, try to place extractors and stash boxes very close together to quick move items before getting killed. Stay crouched to be undetectable in VATS and harder to spot.
---
NOW somebody gets my objection that started with the pride flag. You've just made my point 'EXACTLY' bang on.
---
OP is from Central Europe it's seriously the first sentence of the post.
---
Do you want me to post some gameplay or something because he walked up to me and shot 1 singular whatever the fuck out of his gun and it killed me each time I ran up to him. You want to just tell me more stuff that didn’t happen that I seen with my own 2 eyes or what? The game said that other players can claim the workshop. How does that translate to you are going to get fucking raped by any other player if they come here. I thought in the process of claiming you can fight other players and then it becomes your settlement
---
I use it on all my pa. I agree that it is not as good as f4's tho.
---
Like the responders setting up base in the watoga civic center tower for example
---
Grow up I guess
---
Structures built at workshops are temporary. You lose them when you leave. Build at your C.A.M.P if you want permanent structures.
---
You obviously cared or you wouldn't have sent me such a nice reply, douchebag.
---
When you take a workshop it literally warns you quite clearly on screen about the risks of taking a workshop. Dont lie that you "didnt know" and get out of here troll.
---
Your camp is your base not the workshop. Build that up.
---
Bethesda will link it to today's date just this once.
---
No, you won't get your stuff back, it is a scummy move to be a level 164 and hunt a level 5, but you should read the pop up before taking a workshop. From now on, build a home in your camp and don't take workshops until you are a high level if you don't want to face that again
---
Kill yourself
---
you can buy your own server later today and people won't be able to do this to you 😴😴 pay to not be griefed
---
But there’s zero incentive to taking a workshop if it disappears when you leave then
---
Later today? I didn’t realize the servers were being released so soon. Aren’t there mods available in them?
---
Maybe it's something to do with Obsidian making New Vegas? Not sure, but I hope we get mods because I don't expect Bethesda to add drinks for one's alcoholic roleplay without getting the atom shop involved.
---
I mean, they did that crappy Nuka dark stint with the plastic shell, so they did it irl instead of in game like people actually want.
---
mods are likely to come at a later date
---
1) don't take workshops if you don't want PvP; after survival mode was removed this is how most PVP happens now.
---
2) your workshop claim and build is only on that server, so it's not really worth it spending a long time building it up. You'll never see it again when you log out and back in as you'll be put on another server (most likely)
---
3) your CAMP is your home. This will be saved when you log out and follow you to any server you go. Sometimes you might need to jump to another server if someone already has their CAMP in the same spot (the game will tell you this - you can move it if you want, but it's better to just jump to a new server). People can't destroy your camp unless you pick a fight with them or they waste a nuke on it (not Fatman nuke, but a proper nuke).
---
4) if you follow the main questline it will teach you how the game works. But also be aware, if you just follow the main questline and don't do any side things or events, you will quickly find yourself much lower level than the enemies in the areas where the questline sends you.
---
You can't be one shot. There is a damage Cap in PVP of 110. You are mistaken. Or do the rules of the Game just not apply to you? You weren't raped, stop using that word. Claiming you were raped detracts from people that have actually undergone a horrible ordeal. You were killed in a Game, grow up. There are no settlements. There is your Camp, and there is their Camp. Workshops are PVP zones. You were warned, whether you read the dialogue box or not, you still accepted it. You need to relax and stop blowing up because you had a bad experience. The game is a far more comfortable experience if you pay attention to dialogue boxes and accept that not everyone wants to play fair. Turn on Pacifist mode and stay out of public workshops.
---
Vending is a funny thing. I sell my serums for 250 even though I can get much more from a vendor. But I like to have players coming through my camp so charge low prices on everything and give away ammo. Plus there's always the chance you are helping a lower level player who is short on caps.
---
Americans and Europeans are equally sensitive so doesn’t affect anything
---
I find myself using them to take massive chunks of health down, then either remembering I can bash or using a pea shooter to finish it so I can drain excess ammo.
---
I've already picked perks to bolster my shotgun damage and I'm still pretty low level so I feel like I'm stuck with it for now.
---
The first time for me I had started to run away then it just hit me, "F-it, let's go bitch!"  After I killed the one, two more showed up and I killed them too!  I  felt like a beast!
---
Adjustable seeds or not, the RNG is awful because you are unable to work towards items that benefit your own build -- yeah sure sometimes I get good drops that don't suit my build &amp; I could trade them, but that's not a guarantee either.
---
It doesn’t disappear when you leave it disappears when it gets taken from you. Just built extractors, turrets and a stash box and nothing else.
---
Yeah that would be likely with the Atomic Shop. I still don’t understand why Bethesda won’t release good quality GLASS nuka cola bottles (as seen within Fallout 4) for sale. I mean they could charge a ludicrous amount of money for them and I would totally buy them being a nuka cola fan.
---
Just don’t pvp?
---
I sell each of my serums for 300
---
Solid guns, but exploding makes a big difference if you can find one. The important mods for me are a silencer, I play with headphones and have tinnitus so it really helps, a fast magazine and hard receiver. I was lucky enough to be given an AAE shotgun by a good in-game friend, but just about any exploding will do, not beserker. The Skeet Shooter perk is also worth it for range and of course Demolition Expert for explosive damage. I don't bother with the shotgun power perks, don't need them for crippling, you're better off putting the points into another weapon type. I'm also a heavy gunner and yes I remember the endless plastic runs for shotty shells, i virtually lived in the two high schools.
---
When they were still playing I'd often run a nuked Whitsprings with a group of friends, I'd lead the way and cripple everything, then they'd all get a shot in and we'd all circle back to collect the loot. That way we didn't wipe out the area for other players and once me finished a round one of us would re-log to trigger a re-spawn and we'd do it again. Back when no starred ghouls were still dropping legendaries we'd all end up waddling back to the station completely overloaded with 2 and 3\* by the end. It's less productive now, but still works.
---
Super Mutants are perhaps the worst enemy to take on with a shotty, they're tanky and high level mutants with a decent gun will still shoot chunks off you when they go down, but if you keep moving they're not too much of a problem. I find Ghouls, Bears and Deathclaws go down the best, followed with a decent melee weapon or a flechette harpoon and you can save the important ammo for bigger fights.
---
You on PC?
---
So sorry we beat you guys in ww2 like dogs and now your in a such a abysmal state that noone can say any forbidden words or the thought police will get ya. Its called America ya kraut, freedom of speech
---
If it works :p I'm stuck on a ps4 since a year, my pc is waiting for a new home with its space. Some games doesn't allow to connect two times the same account, or even two connections on the same machine. But it's nice that you can just launch the game twice :o
---
Are you sure there is still a 110 damage cap? Because yesterday I have been one shot by one player. During SBQ I tagged unintentionally a player  and at the end of event he one shot me to steal my flux. I was full life.
---
The incentive for taking workshops is to temporarily mine their resources. You get a good amount of free materials to craft extractors, generators and turrets etc from before it starts eating into your own stash. Some people take workshops to experiment with new builds, but it's in the knowledge that it's just a temporary construction (although you can blueprint them if I remember correctly). I personally no longer take workshops because the PVP element has ramped up since Survival mode was taken down. It's too much hassle for not enough benefit.
---
I've recently paid a whole lotta caps for TS25 and V25 combat shotguns, to test them out in PvP. Man, they suck... On full shotgunner build (if you could call it like that) those pellets would do between 0 and 2 damage, unless you're standing right in front of someone, in which case you're dead.  
---
Right now they're on par with Portable Naval Cannon and lead pipes.
---
oof now libs want software to have sexuality, bruh
---
Good call, so yes the walking cane, baton, tyre iron e.t.c...
---
We're not owed content every month correct, but how long has it been since we actually got new content? Took them months to finally add The Fixer and the Sheepsquatch weapons to the legendary loot pool, those NEW weapons were literally useless until not long ago. Criticism will always come to a game if it's not doing it's best, and I honestly believe they aren't doing their best. Pretty sure they wanted to rely on NW but it's full of hackers and cheaters now I just feel like they gave up on their battle royale button. No idea how long this game will last until wastelanders drop, but hopefully they pull something out of thin air to save it.

Although I think data miners have confirmed that none of that play into treasure maps. I've also recently done over 1,600 more maps in the last week or so with the same results as above.
---
I never considered etsy. Thanks for the suggestion!
---
And yeah I am disappointed in the general direction Bethesda is going. I still love and support 76 but I am going to wary of merchandise Bethesda releases and can only hope they be better in the future.
---
I'm only level 55, I can just get by in higher level zones (if a higher level dude hasn't walked through) and haven't really had the experience with bloodied/junkie stuff. 
---
I play solo because I'm quite introverted so I'm scraping by with a few legendaries and basic excavator power armour on an everlasting quest for screws and springs. 
---
Sad shotguns don't get any better but who knows! Maybe something will get fixed and stay that way!
---
It will have one big city per faction. The only one we know now is the space station.
---
GLOW IN THE DARK PAINT! Only 1200 Atoms.
---
I can quote whoever I feel. Also, anything can be good bloodied and those shotguns are still not nearly as good as other explosive weapons.
---
I'm not 250 yet and that's not even that high, i regularly see much higher level players on the map, not as many as there used to be, but still. Suggesting we all have mental health issues because we play a game we enjoy is kinda shitty though, thanks.
---
Honestly with how the game released and the state it's still in they would have no right to charge us for any sort of content/DLC lmao.
---
I’ve been selling all my serums for 250 caps for months on XB1 and they sell slow as feck. I have learned about 7 recipes I think and usually have at least a dozen of each serum I have the recipes for, I’ve just assumed that most people are already mutated and maybe don’t realise you can sell serums to robot vendors for 500 caps ea.
---
I’ve been lucky and never paid more than 6k per recipe and got electrically charged, bird bones, marsupial, twisted muscles, carnivore and one or two others I can’t remember.
---
r/woosh
---
Exactly is buff is necessary
---
That's a wise stance to take since Bethesda, or rather Zenimax has been taking notes from Activision and EA's books.
---
And you're welcome. I've bought stuff from other franchises from Etsy and they've so far been really good.
---
Yeah i’m hoping for the same. I love shotguns.
---
It's pretty trash right now, sadly have to agree with him. 😴
---
Seems like you tried all the possible play styles. I am heavy tank on one character and stealth commando on the other. some weeks I switch to shotgun to burn through my shells.  
---
I prefer the heavy weapons tank build because it is great fun, I just shoot and don't need to worry about stims etc. The stealth commando is a typical bloodied glass canon, which is more difficult to play with (I do mind dying, I try to keep that to a minimum).  
---
You might have already done this, but I would suggest going 'all out' on a play style. I used to have a combination of heavy weapons and automatic rifles. It was only when I completely switched to heavy weapons that my heavies really started dishing out damage.
---
Check out datamining threads :) There isnt such algorithm.
---
It’s 2102 dude. Where have you been? Open you dang pip boy!
---
If you’re playing at all it’s not trash. I don’t touch trash games.
---
I was preparing a wall of text how this game could have been less boring but theres no point. Even modding seems its going to be very limited. Thankfully Cyberpunk will have a multiplayer component to quench my multiplayer needs.  
---
Also The Outer Worlds is coming out in a couple days.
---
Heavy Gunner builds are nice and very adaptive I use a JE 50 Cal and a JE LMG I can kill a Mirelurk queen in about 3 seconds. 
---
Heavy weapon perks fall under the strength Special. Put 15 points into strength the rest will work itself out. Best part is you can swap perks around easily and play Melee or Shotgun builds quite easily.
---
Also any rapid fire explosive gun will more or less put you in god mode. VE Miniguns are nice but don't pass up on a 50 cal or LMG (though 308 is hard to keep up with in the lmg) You'll drop enemies quickly and never have to use stims it's almost too easy.
---
Pipe wrench

They don't really do anything though.

What has the support team done besides unban wrongfully accused players?

\&gt; Predictable uninformed 'freedom of speech' canard.

You don't understand freedom of speech.

Really? How do they get generated then?

Sorry not really kept up with the datamining side of things and dont quite fully grasp reddit yet lol, would you mind linking me to such a thread?

Grow up.

😂😂😂

But you’ll also be given the option to cancel the build at anytime and create one from scratch

You're looking in the wrong spot. They're the vendors in the back.

By random number generator - completely random. No drop bias apart loot tables for specific creatures. I do not have time to search for link atm, sry.

FO76 sub

No worries, thankyou for the explaination anyways bud :)

Lolwat
---
Doesn't grounded lower energy weapon damage?  Do sent you losing out on some damage on both the flamer and cryo?
---
Before I got a 90% RW legendary shottie generally the shotties I would get from the corpses of the scorched it summoned.
---
With Enforcer+Skeet Shooter is a doodle to make them land.
---
Doesnt make it in game.. subREDDIT not subFALLOUT76
---
Look up "fallout 76 it just works song". It'll be the best thing you've ever seen.
---
they only have 10 people working at the game
---
Y ok u play this game way too much bro. Take off the tin foil hat and go do something else.
---
Personally I'm happy to see all the 200+ level players leave the field for a few months till WLers and give us 150 and lower room to breathe and play.
---
Hope you find another game that can hold your attention as long as 76 has.
---
yea, this is were i am with the game.  i made a 2nd character along the way to. just waiting on the new DLC.
---
If he was a high enough level to one shot he was probably a dickhead. People like that exist unfortunately. I haven’t encountered one for a while but when I did, my friends and I would make sure they never got any legendary kills, would troll him until he rage quit, etc. good fun, but you can’t do that by more with invincible camps and whatnot.
---
Kinda depends on where you can spare points. Shotgun + enforcer in agility or rifle &amp; tormentor in luck. Not sure if +50 limb damage works on SB wings, but might be worth investigating. 👍
---
I wish my Telsa could one shot enemies. I purposely use my Telsa for events because the damage is so low.
---
Developers still thinking shotguns are just melee weapons with ammo counts are a bane to many games.
---
Using a preset would be completely optional
---
Ignoring them is how they grew so confident to be upfront about it!
---
Im holding on to my AAE combat shotgun hoping they change things and make it better.
---
Happens to me if I use VATS on a Stingwing like during the campfire event.      Have to exit and restart the game to fix it.     Also I often play with my brother and sometimes we just can’t hear each other over our headsets.    This is on a PS4.    Those are the two main major problems I have right now.
---
The devs had to redo the effect for the Targeting HUD, because it was infectious, so to say: other players in the vicinity would also see marked enemies even if they didn't use the mod. This spread from player to player until it caused an overflow or exception, and it crashed game clients left, right and center.
---
I'm still not using Targeting HUD, but I'm not surprised it's been nerfed.
---
I agree - it would - however - I think it could call home to Bethesda for license verification on a regular basis - that would deter piracy (of course that could be hacked - but it could also be engineered to check for updates to world content and code etc and have an expiration date on each "key" )
---
At the beginning when you are about to leave the vault there would be a pop up on your screen saying “Who are you?” or something like that and you’ll be able to pick a preset or not if that’s what you want
---
Can i just say that you seem like a lot of fun
---
1 year to a waste of 60$ fucking yay
---
Nice, I may have to drop by if you are on Xbox. As for hard bargain, I’m completely leveled up there.
---
Yes actually, we are owed content Todd, if you sell a game promising it will be a “constantly evolving live service with content updates well into the future” then you have to provide that
---
See if this was blocked in game you would have never known.
---
Oh i meant like after ww2 when we beat you guys now you arent warlike like your ancestors the Prussians
---
I remember my first scorchbeast kill. It was one of the more memorable experiences in my hobby of gaming. I’d just moved camp down to the Ash Heap, across the street from the Charleston Fire Station, and was introducing myself to a fellow vault dweller living by the filthy pond nearby. A scorchbeast came down from Mt Blair and started trolling both of our houses. I may have been pushing level 25, and my neighbor was lvl 60-ish, which was high level for early last November.
---
I’d just modded my vanilla combat rifle with a suppressor, and I was kind of excited to road test it on an apex predator. There’s a high level player living next door, who’s got ultracite power armor and a minigun. I have plenty of ammo, a brand new rifle and a good start on a sniper build. Success is within reason. I started shooting at the thing, my neighbor started shooting and it was probably the ugliest video game battle I’ve ever been party to.
---
I’m into sniping and started building for stealth and rifles with a plan for perks from the start. Naturally I’m crouched and potshotting the creature, and my neighbor is taking the brunt of the damage with his power armor and mini gun. He runs out of 5mm, pulls out a shotgun, runs out of shells, and runs to his stash box to pull out more guns. I’m still plugging away at the scorchbeast as it hovers, screeches and cropdusts us. (this is like a week after launch, so scorchbeasts would just stay in the air and endlessly spam sonic attacks) At this point, my neighbor starts talking with increased intensity, obviously frustrated, accusing the creature of picking on him and screaming at me to start shooting. Mind you, I’ve been shooting the whole time while he’s running around and spraying bullets everywhere. I’ve perked and geared towards stealth, so I’m avoiding damage appropriately for my build, at least as well as I can for a 20-something. After exhausting his minigun, a shotgun, a 50 cal and a missile launcher, he just ragequits in epic fashion. His character is just standing there in the middle of a sonic blast, and he’s screaming in that unhinged way where the person’s voice drops an octave, they stop using words, their face turns a strange shade of purple, and you start to get worried about their health.
---
Now I’m stuck alone with a broken combat rifle, three broken armor pieces and just a hunting rifle  to take out a scorchbeast at quarter health just murdering my camp. I came this far, so may as well go out on my shield. The creature already mentally broke a grown man, so I should at least try to avenge his sanity. Using a couple cabins around the pond as cover and vats to get through the nonstop scream attacks, I just keep shooting and healing. Finally the damn thing lands with a sliver of health, so I toss a cryo grenade, start shooting it in the face as quickly as a hunting rifle will allow, and the thing finally dies. From start to finish, this was probably a 20 minute ordeal. If my hunting rifle broke, I’d probably have to start pulling guns off corpses.
---
I forgot to mention that this whole fight was peppered with a few Scorched periodically joining in, along with some Liberators wandering over from the nearby mine, all of which were lvl 40+.  The whole thing was a trash fire that would be annoying to deal with even today at lvl 300ish, because a nearby player and opposing enemies create a damage nerf effect. I didn’t know that at the time, and I doubt my neighbor did either, god bless his tormented soul.
---
After all that, I’m expecting the thing to be carrying riches that a man can retire on. The fight left me with a broken gun, almost no .45 ammo, four broken pieces of armor and a completely leveled house.  I was richer by two pieces of ultracite scrap and a big bat steak. The biggest haul was the steel and mods learned from scrapping all the weapons off the dozens of corpse piles.  I had to slowly repair my armor as Id gradually earn enough caps to buy bulk ballistic fiber from vendors. I had no idea where to find it in the wild, and there was no advice to be found online at the time.  You also needed a whole bunch of fiber to repair low level armor, which was adjusted down months later. Probably the most miserable couple days of gaming I’ve ever had in Appalachia, just feeling broke and underequipped.
---
After that, I’d just server hop every time I saw a scorchbeast until I got my first decent legendary gun, which was a single star anti armor handmade rifle. A full perk loadout and a half decent gun made a world of difference.  Battling my way to Glassed Caverns wasn’t easy, but at least I didn’t hobble off the battlefield with only one shoe and no eyebrows like the first fight.
---
Ah, ok. I’ll have to do that when I get the chance. Probably around 4:10, whatever time zone Chicago is.
---
Event\*
---
Oh wow. Wrong ammo? How?
---
You can say whatever you like?
---
Software doesn't need sexuality. He used 'gay' to call out a negative aspect, which is homophobic
---
How is lvl 150 different from a lvl 200+?
---
If I'm passing Vault 76 and there's a noob in the Vault I normally dump some stuff in one of the corpses near the entrance. Much more personal than a paper bag.
---
50 levels separate them?   /s
---
No idea. Seems like its loading fusion cores, because it shows only 6 total (right the amount of cores I have), while I have several thousands of plasma catridges. When I switch weapons and switch back to plasma rifle, it shows 999 again.
---
Left for switching between the last two equipped weapons, or at least it used to be that before the bug. The wheel still seems to work but I've gotten in the habit of setting two weapons purposely before I go into a more challenging area because the seconds I spent on the clunky wheel mean the difference sometimes.
---
Most solid builds require at least level 70 to fully perk out, and another 100+ to fully kit, so git smurt
---
The number...
---
I have played a lot for months and have yet to see any 1488s or anything.  I see plenty of 420s and 666s.
---
Do you see neo Nazis around every corner?  Do you wake up and they under your bed?  Are you literally shaking right now?
---
If you’re that offended report, block, or just move on.
---
It’s just kids I seriously doubt members of the Arian nation are playing or have a presence in FO76.
---
But hey I didn’t know a thing 1488 existed but I looked it up and learned something.  See how that works?
---
Did you call them gay before they killed you?
---
It could be a perk with no other effects other than dual wield
---
" hardly a day goes by when I don't stumble upon such shit "
---
Is this true though? I have over 800 hours in and have never seen hate symbols anywhere. I Know it happens because people say it does, but on a constant basis? I have a hard time believing that. 
---
Also remember that if you're in a group they can build in your camp, so maybe before reporting message the player to let them know. I'd hate to be kicked from the game because of something a stranger did to my camp.
---
Weird! I've noticed having to reload as soon as you get into a server which is annoying but easy to adjust to. I haven't done anything with plasma weapons yet. Is that also just when entering a new server? Still way more to deal with than just hitting the reload button either way.
---
Nah I'm pretty sure it will a reward from nuclear winter. I think the costumes in the atomic will be new 1s.
---
...but unfortunately most likely expensive.
---
Ding ding ding
---
The Confederate battle flag was a symbol of prejudice &amp; hate in it's time as well. When they tell you it was about "states rights" the rights they were talking about was owning human beings.
---
Going to say that is not the case for me. I’ve been killed by other players in workshops at least 4 times and it’s always been a one shot kill. 
---
I think with survival gone and some people really wanting pvp, prey on people who they see at workshops. 
---
I usually create a crafting station and stash real quick, and offload my junk, before someone can swoop in now.
---
He's not wrong. The symbol you identify as the swastika is known as the manji in Japanese or the Wan in Chinese and is an important symbol in Buddhism. Don't blame others for your cultural ignorance.
---
Dude. If you dislike the game, LEAVE.
---
Yes, only after joining and if you have a plasma rifle equipped.
---
All guns need a buff not just shotguns due to scrap requirements to make ammo and bullet sponges everywhere late game excluding ghouls.
---
I bought the grounded serum recipe just to sell serums to the vender bots to get my daily caps.
---
Those beliefs include mass genocide. It's perfectly acceptable to call out people who think that Nazis had the right idea.
---
I asked for a working fridge a while back and a vendor machine. I want more useful  utility items.
---
Trade is normal means since we all can sell they just dont drop anymore.  Dont get me wrong I do know what legacy means.  With all the dupers and collectors legacy is a term used loosely.  The survival weapons are a legacy now a tenderizer is a legacy
---
I don't blame you one bit. I was holding out for wastelanders but they pushed that back so what else is there really to do? I have more guns then I'll ever use and enough armor sets to fit an army. The events are fucked and the ones that do work everyone just one shots everything (Even low levels) I try to just use my quad tesla to get a hit on them but more often then not by the time I even look at the legendary, it's dead. The story mission was lack luster in just about every way. Farming bullets seems to be the only thing to do so I can do encrypted and sbq which I have done more times then I care to admit. It's gotten to the point that I drop improved repair kits just to lose weight to do the raid. And don't get me started on the griefers... I can understand wanting someone to PvP but when you and your 3 friends follow me around in hopes of pissing me off enough to strike 1st, it just gets really old really fast. Then there's the atom shop... I get that the dlc's are free but when they are charging the price of what a full dlc on any other fallout game for a SKIN for power armor. It just leaves a bad taste in my mouth. I love fallout but I honestly think it's about time for something else.
---
The id that player had chosen did not do all of that. It's just an id
---
*"Just play another game!"*
---
This kills the live service game. Meanwhile, you've got people playing League of DotA for well over ten years.
---
I saw a post here about drops and perks by someone who was very good about recording his drops. He had the theory that drops you got were a feedback loop to perks you have on you or in your stash.
---
I have it a try. I collected low weight one star items of valuable perks and I noticed a big difference. While I did not record my data, my drop rates changed significantly. Take it for what you will.
---
Melee build, L146.  I took down my first several SBs (L50's) with a combat rifle, but I found it to be relatively ineffective against L65+.
---
Now I use either an AA LMG or Resolute Veteran.  Both are rather effective.
---
  Although I did have a L50 land on me last night, and it's little bat brain decided it wanted to go toe-to-toe.  It stayed on the ground just swinging its wings at me.  Took that one out with a vampire switchblade.
---
I use the same weapons against cargobots and vertibirds.
---
I use a B/E two star hunting rifle with a prime receiver and piercing magazine. Three shots will take out flying lvl 50 and 65 versions. One vats crit headshot will take out a lvl 80 if it’s on the ground. I use full rifleman, sneak attack and bloody related perks/mutations.
---
A bloody power fist will also kill a lvl 80 in one hit with appropriate perks and mutations behind it.
---
just came back to the game myself, lvl 9 
---
PSN: Johnny2-Step
---
Yeah, the mobile games time-gating and daily allowances is honestly too strict on some elements of the game.
---
User name checks out.
---
Another 100 to fully kit lmao . I'm ready to PvP from level 55.
---
NO THIS IS PATRICK
---
Always use a courier for item swaps. They are peeps that will do it for you.
---
It violates the TOS for Sony and Bethesda and if there is any hate speech it should be focused on the Brotherhood of Steel.
---
Happy Nuke day!
---
bye.
---
I'm taking a wild guess now, but geography and history are perhaps not your strong suit.
---
But I kinda understand. Anything smaller than Texas might seem inconsequential.
---
Of course he isn't wrong. Do you honestly think that is the first time anybody has said it?
---
The statement is fucking stupid because it dismisses intent as it always does. And it is always (and I mean ALWAYS) brought up whenever hate symbols are even slightly brought up. 
---
It doesn't matter what the symbol was or originated as. If it (or any symbol in the world) is used for a specific purpose that it takes on that definition. 
---
In the OP's example, the number 88 isn't obviously immediately racist. But when you realize the whole HH thing than it completly changes. 
---
And by the way, excuse my cultural ignorance but the manji and swastica arnt even the same symbol. Are a 6 and 9 the same symbol because they are the same just inverse? Of course not
---
No, you protesting a symbol of acceptance and tolerance, *still* makes you wrong.
---
You totally, and completely, fail to understand the issue. It's flabbergasting, really.
---
The id is supporting an ideology that believes that mass genocide is a good idea. It's pretty obvious that wasn't just a random string of numbers put together. He needs to be banned from the game. Hate groups aren't just another "opinion" to be listened to. They are by the very definition of the word terrorists.
---
I was planning my minimalist pistolero character for wastelanders since I thought I wouldn’t be forced to adapt to the current meta to actually have a good time. Wastelanders being delayed and the atomic shop changes have finally given reason to leave the game and I don’t think I really can defend it from any point now.
---
Just the millennials
---
You went a little over the top on the second sentence, but it’s definitely possible to make a week’s worth of scrip in a couple hours.
---
I think when someone enters a workshop area that is owned by someone, that a message should appear asking do you wish to contest the area, yes or no. If you hit no, you can’t damage the owner, if you hit yes, an alert tells the owner someone is wanting to contest the workshop, and they either need to defend, or leave. 
---
I’ve been ambushed several times just trying to do something for a quest, or challenge, and it has always been a one shot kill. 
---
Example: yesterday I was in a workshop and was on my newer character and decided to build the instruments for the musician possum badge challenge. Well, while I was doing that some guy ambushed me, and killed my guy in a second. Luckily I had already put my junk in my stash, 
---
I sent the guy a message saying enjoy the camp the and the few caps you got. 
---
I fully understand that workshops are a pvp area, but being able to one shot people like that, it’s not a “challenge” it’s just another form of griefing.
---
There's no defending their "EA" perspective of what makes a good game. It's all for money. Not for us, they are marketing us.
---
Other people have observed this too but of course with true random numbers - some people will observe "patterns" and some will not. Only the ones that do post about the patterns and the others perceive as random.
---
That said - the generation of the RNG is unknown really and will occur server side. It will be a pseudo-RNG and could have biases depending on various factors. So the process of selecting an item is know - but how you generate the random number is not.
---
It's also my birthday, so there's that
---
Funny part with content alone this game wasn't worth the $90 for Tricential Edition on Day 1 I paid and should of gotten a real game with content like Witcher or Fallout 4. The game was half made and scorhbeast queen still bugs out every so often.
---
Prime receiver plans only drop from the SBQ - you get one that you haven't learnt yet. So just keep doing SBQs until you get them all.
---
It's a bit different on PC, while you can't use the same account twice at the same time, you can run the game twice. But you can't do that using the launcher as that piece of crap will always log you in using the account you gave it.
---
As for not allowing 2 connections from the same machine, I have yet to encounter such a game. The most I had to do was to copy the files because of a file-lock.
---
In previous iterations of fallout, I hated melee, was strictly a PA shooter, with my weapon of choice being an explosiive Thompson MG.
---
76 changed that - melee by chance, but I have come to really enjoy it.
---
I do use heavies for flying things, but most of the rest is up close and personal.  High level mobs definately get the heart rate up :)
---
The sale was a flop for me...I got total garbage drops and just ended up selling them into the exchange for some scrip back.
---
I haven't even bothered logging in the past three days because there's nothing going on.
---
Actually, on my way to work there are several billboards promoting local neonazi political party, in before coming elections. So I do kinda see them on every corner, thanks for asking.
---
At least you made it to the vault in time! A new home on your birthday, happy birthday!
---
I'm hoping for something lore friendly. Not just randomly
---
I'll try to forgive your cultural ignorance. Here's some information a quick Google search could have earned you: When facing left, it is the Omote (front facing) Manji, representing love and mercy. Facing right, it represents strength and intelligence, and is called the Ura (rear facing) Manji. In Zen Buddhism, the Manji represents an ideal harmony between love and intellect.

---
You don't know this person's intent. Let me say that once more it sticks: you do NOT know this person's intent.  Fallout 76 is an international online service which encompasses many different people of varying ideologies. Just because a symbol means something to you, doesn't mean it means that to others.
---
Thanks for your understanding. Have a nice day.
---
By not letting you scrap ammo they can balance the game to have more of it and keep it very light weight. If you could scrap ammo it would have to weigh more (or you would “store” your steel in it) and you’d have to find less in the wild.  
---
It’s better for gameplay as it is.
---
Hey, hey, guess what day it is...... NUKE DAAAAYYYYY!!!!!!
---
Bi
---
Not a bad idea. Good for new players so that they don't have to grind as much.
---
Exactly that. It's hard to look forward to amy updates, new content as somehow there's always a catch...but still we play...because we want fallout to succeed. Not Bethesda or Todd Howard. But the actual game. This is what they play on...our loyalty. Will it be rewarded? Who knows...can but hope
---
I hop servers very frequently, visit a lot of camps, check the social tab often; on my regional servers (or however the system works) it is quite abundant.
---
Huh? What? I thought the idea behind a private server is that you host it on your own machine and mod it as you please?
---
It really shouldn't come as a surprise that the 'Blood and Honor' types would flock towards a game that's called For Honor, though. With Fallout on the other hand it's the make-your-own-story angle that makes it adaptable to almost **any** kind of world view, but especially fringe ones. I for one wouldn't be shocked to find out that lots of scientologists were playing FO76 as well, searching for manifestations of Xenu or higher OT levels...
---
Not trying to downplay the nazi problem, though, and being from Germany myself, I'm more or less fine-tuned to seeing nazi stuff in user names. Lots of Odins and other Norse gods around on servers, too, although those names alone don't mean much anymore thanks to the popularity of the Marvel Cinematic Universe.
---
the flag itself, I have no issues at all.none what so ever. But now its something MUCH  different. THATS MY POINT clot.
---
https://youtu.be/RcGLGb_Qwe8
---
You're preaching to the choir as far as server hopping and camp visits go.. But I check out every camp on pretty much every server I goto and have yet to see something like this.
---
Cross referencing what people have said on reddit and Facebook the assumption is that there is a player seed value which is fed into the RNG system, so maybe?
---
I'm sure they come up with a way of bulking ammo and give us 50 lead per 100 .50 rounds. 10 lead per 100 5mm. It could be done without breaking the game.
---
They could have that you have to scrap in chunks to gain a small amount of scrap.
---
I agree that there is a "seed" and is applied to the account as opposed to server as some think. 
---
My sample size was smaller but 16 purchases over 3 characters. I got 5 robot arms out of 6 pieces, 2 of those vanguard, 2 weightless, 2 Beserker's, 2 instigating gatling lasers. 
---
What's odd is I hate robot armor although a couple of characters have a life saving piece. I don't see that being a factor in determining my seed. I do have a bloodied character yet only got 1 piece, unyielding and 1 bloodied weapon. I am however collecting weightless armor because I have a 4th I want to build around the chameleon mutation.
---
no they aren't .... NOT THE POINT... NOW ITS SOMETHING VERY DIFFERENT. THATS THE DOOR THEY OPENED.
---
I guess I shouldn't  be surprised as it's the internet, but the acceptance and defense of this sort of thing is a bit surprising.
---
Pistol build here and lvl 237 and I deeply regret it, I jump to my alt melee build when I got it lvl 30 it was already wreaking things better then main and now that alt is lvl 90 I do 110+ damage on regular hit on the queen while pistol does 1-8 damage depending legendary I use and if only 8 if its head shot.
---
Kill the bots too, collect the fusion cores.
---
What's wrong with being homophobic?
---
I've been passing a very bad time last year from now on. Fallout 76 was one of my places to escape. I was fired from my job while yelling at a co-worker who endorsed a know torturer on the workplace, was finishing a long time project on my on, and ultimately, lost my baby boy, during it's last month of gestation. But fascism keeps on the rise.
---
I'm sorry for you and your experience with fascist on your country's history, and having to face those symbols now. I would like to add something more smart and useful, but I'm not very well to do so. What I can barely say, is that we also need to learn some things. Sorry for not being more specific and useful. Cheers.
---
I just switched by pistol build to a bloodied pistol build. It is surprisingly effective. You wont 1-shot everything in creation like a bloodied rifle or heavy weapon build but it is viable and you will pull your weight in groups.
---
[](/celestiahappy)
---
Could be... If I had to put money on it. I would say there are some RNG biases that vary by player
---
True, honestly got hyped when seeing perk from NW that showed dual wielding but smashed my hopes when it wasn't for dual wielding.
---
I hear you but high level doesn't have much to do with the douche level that UF brings anymore. I'm  400+ bloodied. My auto bloodied Tesla, with the right conditions, could one shot a group. But I don't. I take all damage cards off and heal up real nice. Waving at people and throwing up hearts, informing where to get the supervisors, etc.
---
But then a level 76 a$$hat will come in trying out their fancy new gauntlet and one shot all the rest, sometimes even the supervisors if they're alone.
---
Understood and no one to blame you. Somehow I lost my appetite a lot earlier and I just cannot bring myself back to play. I'm more of a solo character and is difficult to keep enjoying. Hopeful about the new gamechanging releases however my gaming hours/levels are lot lower at the moment then I planned when purchasing.
---
Death is a preferable alternative to communism!
---
I always use a tesla rifle for tagging mobs. I use the automatic barrel to decrease damage and only tap the trigger so it can deal the least amount of damage when tagging mobs. If everyone did the same thing, events like uranium fever would go smoothly.
---
Unoptimized explosive shotguns are also good for tagging because they have terrible ranged damage.
---
Umm you get no loot from them.
---
Got a few accounts with many alts and a few them for mini nukes storage only lol. But yea would love to convert it to 10mm ammo as I'm always desperate for it for my pistol.
---
^ This.
---
If their enemy identification protocols do not allow them to discern between deliberate and accidental well, that's too bad... for them.
---
No I know they removed survival but they could have moved the weekly challenge to adventure mode!
---
Hey, you’re welcome to leave if you don’t like the game, if not, zip it.
---
With the right conditions I could one shot a group, as a high level I figure I need to let people know I'm there to share, I'll even shoot a msg if someone seems to not take the hint.
---
PSA: Please don't panic if you see someone with a Tesla, it'll lead to mass hysteria and one-shot saltiness. Instead, use emotes to put others at ease and give them an idea that you're going to be using public event courtesies.
---
A whole lot. In today's society LGBTQ+ people are accepted for who they are
---
soo awesome! so the version for sale and the version you posted the image for here are the same? the sale website shows different cover art
---
WAIT WHAT? They are charging for it? It better have a ton of custom server side options and not be just a private Instance then.
---
Can't speak for the Gatling Plasma, but I got two .50 cal prime receiver plans from regular SBs already, finally also got my first crossbow prime plan yesterday from one. It feels like one in twenty-five SBs will drop a plan, but it is what keeps me killing them.
---
No. It is cured by taking Radaway or using a decontamination shower.
---
The original post is about pretty clear white suppremisit symbology (or rather numerology I guess) so I don't know where you are coming at there. 
---
And forgive me for oversimplifying my point on the facing of a number.
---
No only RadAway , use RadAway diluted 1 at a time to remove Rads with a mutation
---
Okay thanks!
---
What platform you on...ran into a camp the other day and a guy had every brewing recipe in his vendor...grabbed a couple myself just to finish the recipe atom challenge
---
No it won't, just watch out for radaway &amp; decontamination showers if you don't have the starched genes perk
---
*Baüme hus

Party names please so I can research.  Let me guess...they are nationalist and you consider them nazis because the media, Professor, and/or Hollywood told you so.
---
Looks fantastic, well done!
---
Which skill tree is that in? Endurance?
---
Wait does that work now?
---
I see nothing wrong with it. If they want to be gay, let them i dont care. If I'm uncomfortable around gay people they should respect that. 
---
Same goes for religion. It's pretty fucked up that ANYONE thinks they have any kind of moral high ground becouse EVERYONE is judging everyone in some shape or fashion.
---
Luck
---
I don't see what that (positively) changes for them. People grinding for hours = people on the servers, that's better than logging in 15 minutes every day to scrip three of the seventy-six bazillions legendary 3* weapons you bought for cheap at a vendor.
---
So, I'd also like to hear your argument for removing the heart emote, because it's exactly the same as giving someone the finger.
---
Pretty big state, lotsa different geographical spots - swamps, mountains, desert, plains, hills, etc 😉
---
If everyone stopped throwing money at them for Atoms they would take notice and succumb to fixing the "non-critical bugs" which are critical to the players' challenge, event and quest completions. But that'll never happen since people love throwing money at games regardless of the numerous game breaking glitches and bugs players have to deal with. Apparently cosmetics for in game items makes the game better than having a fully functional game to play.
---
Give 1h melee a shield option too.  And this is a serious post.  No way a hand would be without a shield whacking ferals with a machete.  Would give a much needed boost to the specs and add more diversity.
---
I recently made a post about how it would be good to have a reset notification pop-up (if enabled). 
---
Now for the cooldown itself, if it's player- or server-based it's the same really because you can always tell that *at worst* the caps and scrip will be reset the next day at the same time.
---
I wasn't expressing a political opinion. I hate misinformation. The manji is important to a lot of people. I wasn't discussing the merits of 1488.
---
You do get loot from sentry bots, try it.
---
at over lvl200, I mainly only use excavator. pa just increases my weight when I'm in it. and I'm on a 1 strength build. I was using shotguns many levels ago, but they started to regen health and I just noped outta the build. I'm on that sneak crit build.
---
I've got about 5 complete builds by now, one of my favourite is honestly the shotgun build, and it is actually quite powerful, I do agree that shotguns could use a buff but they're not that bad.
---
My build mainly uses a TSE combat shotgun with the enforcer perk to cripple an enemy's legs and then a TS double barrel (salt of the earth) to the face to finish them off in one shot. This is an incredibly fun playstyle that I suggest trying if you like shotguns, it's a bit unconventional but effective nonetheless
---
The only good Nazi is a dead one.
---
Yup, anything after that are vanity levels.
---
[Relevant](https://youtu.be/_xGuAmk0Ed4)?
---
Yeah, keep the post-apo clothing in the Atom Shop (it should be free and in game but whatever) and remove the silly superhero costumes / dresses / Tarzan kilt / fruit hat.
---
Kill the bots, easy 1000 xp and fusion cores...
---
I read that in his voice! 😂
---
Mine too!
---
yes, you get twice, if you are fast enough you get loot before he explode and then after he explode you can get again.
---
No problem!
---
Birthday buddies! 10/23 gang!
---
I had the same issue on ps4 with keypad pylon.
---
Get starch genes to two and you wont lose any mutations when using radaway and stuff :)
---
Damn wish we could have an event of some sort for this occasion
---
Always a safe bet using sneak builds in any Bethesda game. 
---
I think I've seen the sudden health regen happen a few times, so I'll probably have to move on to another build soon.
---
I have a high INT with average STR and only really built my character depending on what I needed at the time.
---
I personally think that laws in diff countries dont matter because words are just words and censoring art and games is illegal
---
Guass rifle
---
There are dozens of us!
---
I buy High Rad Fluid anytime I see it because it is so rare.  I always thought it was designed that way.
---
  Works reasonably well in melee against the critters.  When cloak activates, sidestep or move behind the enemy.  the cloak seems to confuse them and they stop swinging for a moment.  You can get in several hits befor they "find" you again.
---
My favorite, is when you start an emote in the lobby, it continues after you load into the map.
---
Nope, that's called Fallout 4 ;P
---
The best gift is the gift of life... Life with Vault-Tec. 🎉

Can I have your stuff?

Let me just chime in as well to tell you to *eat shit* and leave if you’ve got nothing good to say
---
I’m sure your parents feel the same way
---
that sounds like a utility feature, so that will be 700 atoms to unlock the mod box crafting station. 
---
"This isn't paid to win as you can just find the mods laying around the world"
---
Explosive bolts and nuka bolts
---
It only takes 10 lead to make 180 rounds. The return on ammo would have to be extremely small. I’m not convinced there’s a reasonable way to do it.
---
Maybe we'll be lucky with the patch contents today
---
Why are you even surprised? Someone was bound and determined to do it, so they did. 
---
Personally, if people want to incorporate dopey dumb dumb racist shit into their Gamer Tags, or PSN names, so be it, that's on them. 
---
Just report, ignore, and move on with your life. You cannot control the actions or opinions of others and you certainly can't change them. 
---
I couldn't be bothered with some moron that has a dumb ass racist name, or something incorporated into his camp that is, well, racist.
---
I prefer my Cat Meat fresh would canned Cat Meat still give me +1 agility?
---
Find a trusty melee weapon for backup.  Build a small mobile camp, don't settle anywhere permanent yet.  Stay in or around the forest for awhile, enemies outside these areas will wreck you.
---
Killed gulpers for a hour and had 6 legendary enemies
---
Oh yeah, that sucks. I start into the game flipping pancakes.
---
Fuck Trump.
---
Have you tried the vault raids?  I've been doing them a lot lately and I find them to be a lot of fun, they force me to try different perks and strategies I otherwise wouldn't use outside of them.  Yeah it can be frustrating to find a server that isn't laggy, but it's the only content in the game right now that really pushes you to work as a team.  I'd highly recommend them if you're bored of everything else and have some friends that could join you.
---
that isn't a bug, that is a feature that they stated when they announced the backpacks. Any clothing that already has a backpack on it will override the backpack that you can craft
---
Check your chest log and/or listen to the overseer’s holotapes. Always keep a melee weapon handy. If you travel; a lot of side quests will get activated in your journeys. Public events and others will start showing for you as you level up. Do those events with others. Find “workshops” and claim them and defend them. You may get killed by a “raider” from time to time but it’s a great way to level up and find new places! Player vendors often sell ammo for 1 cap, so check those as well.
---
I think so
---
If they were placed by someone else and you don't have the recipe, you'll have to get plan or get someone to build them again.
---
Check the stored tab too, they may be there taking up budget but be unplaceable until you learn the plan.
---
I agree with you completely I'm English &amp; I feel the same &amp; see the same cretinous Nazi types.  And this sub is no better for racism &amp; pro genocidal stuff. I have seen antisemitic usernames (often specifically referencing the Shoah). Mods don't seem bothered
---
It amazes me that there are often Americans doing it. Their Great Grandparents gave their lives to save Europe (&amp; I for one will be eternally grateful) &amp; this is how they honour them.
---
Op, I found that the early levels we so punishing that I nearly gave up playing, but hang in there. Things start to be more fun lvls 20+
---
In this sort of data collection, it's more likely that the principal investigator would vet the individuals reporting, rather than vetting each individual submission. These sorts of data consortiums are common in research. 
---
If you allowed picture submissions without vetting submitters, even picture proof would be dangerous because non-submission or selective submission is just as damaging to your statistics as avoiding false submissions.
---
I see your funny little post about professors and whatnot was deleted (either by you or mods), but by any means, knock yourself out: Kotleba – People's Party Our Slovakia
---
no, you are buying a dedicated private server from the sounds of it
---
Damn, yall showed up early. I'm still waiting 58 years.
---
A lot of games do this now and I hate it. My biggest issue though is the quality. Most of these battle royal games are trash. They are an after thought which is thrown together when they need additional content. They are full of glitches and cheaters. Battle royale games are fine if they take the time to develop them and release them as individual games. Just please stop forcing your half assed, thrown together PVP modes on me.
---
It seems now more than ever they do this crap for attention. Look at thier rallies 8 people will show up and 300 counter protestors. They'll get media attention because of the counter protestors. 
---
The best option is report them and block them. That'd be what I mean by ignoring them. Posting it on here just draws attention to them. Along with the counter protest it just draws attention to thier stupidity.
---
Also, I had no idea what the 14 88 meant I had to look it up. I'm out of the loop on my hate speech but I suppose that's a good thing.
---
Second of february maybe, 02.02.20 seems like a date, or 20.02.20
---
Low level scorched are great for farming items and ammo, along with xp.  Morgantown has a ton near the airport which are either level 1 or 7.  You can also find small backpack plans inside the airport terminal now which will get you as one extra carry weight.
---
Here's hoping. Got an FE Combat Shotgun as a BFFR 15 Pump that should be worth more.
---
No it doesn't. Youre dumb.
---
Atk does not have free private servers.
---
Maybe so.
---
Thanks!
---
It's a hard scrabble for survival until much later in the game when you start "coming out ahead" in the game.
---
Do the public quests like "Fertile Soil" and any others that pop up here and there as often as possible. They'll be a Yellowish Hexagon on your map. They give you Stimpaks, ammo, and sometime weapons and armor that are a real boon.
---
Stick to melee weapons as much as possible until you have a small stockpile of ammo you can use or can craft enough ammo. i had the same problem when I first started at launch.
---
Just take it slow through the main questline and try not to get frustrated.
---
Out of how many drops? To verify there is a drop bias, you'd need at least 5 of each primary effect (i.e., at best a minimum 110 drops with perfect uniformity) to apply the Chi-Square test for comparing the drops with the expected uniform distribution. With secondaries, like limb damage and swing speed, you'd need fewer minimum drops.
---
Oh okay, the airport is where I made it to when I played a free weekend, so how do I farm them effectively
---
You may want to read about the perk system, it is not like FO4.   Or maybe someone will respond here, I would but I am on mobile.
---
Longtime fallout player and you can't find ammo and health items? Doesn't make sense to me.
---
I think ur confusing cat food with cat meat friend.
---
Thats literally the circumstances of how we meet him in fo4.
---
Why is your tin foil hat made out of shiny plastic? Fix the damn Trading Glitch, this has been going on for too long
---
The OP has been told this time after time, and keeps posting these statistically unsubstantiated theories. I wish he would get some statistical help.
---
They spawn all around, just kill and check for ammo.  Theres a train station nearby where you can break stuff down and sell it.  I'd highly recommend finding the crate inside that has the small backpack plans, it's a game changer at low levels.
---
Get the pharma farmer perk asap, will help with the healing items. Take river behind Flatwoods church up towards overseer camp then back down til the agricultural center. You will gather enough soot flower and blood leaf to make several healing salves-almost as good as stimpaks. Pick up everything in Flatwoods and agriculture center then scrap it all. You can craft ammo at tinkers workbench at red rocket station. Craft and use throwing knives at weapon workbench-will pretty much one shot everything under level six and saves on ammo. Kill all the Brahman and collect hides-then craft and scrap level 1 leather armor. Will unlock mods for leather armor and provide some easy early xp. Hope this helps out a fellow dweller.
---
I’m on PS4, and I hope he is too by the sounds of that.
---
You're saying: "If they want to be gay...", Being gay is not a choice
---
I’m just really trying to avoid death, I went to some damn and got ambushed by level 10 mutants felt bad burning mags on them, and I’m doing fertile soil rn so weird you said that, I’ll just keep pressing them, appreciate it man
---
I think they run on the $60+ we've already paid.
---
I like you a lot
---
Use a melee weapon only in early levels then you can build up ammo
---
I have no idea why there are let any crossbow mods! When I first came across the crossbow in early days I was so excited to upgrade it and see what cool crossbow mods they’ve come up with! 
---
So well... you can imagine how disappointed I was when I discovered there was basically no mods for it.. Making it one of the worst weapons in the game!😭
---
Yep he is I picked up the two recipes you were looking for...add me same name psn and I will pm his gamertag
---
Servers aren’t free to run. We aren’t paying a dime for DLC. Get a job that pays more than minimum wage. This isn’t a problem.
---
Those sleepers are so annoying, they seem invulnerable, fast travel back to the same location sometimes fixes them for me, so could be a loading issue. Seems this game is always going to have network server lag problems that only a restart may fix. 
---
I might be expecting too much being used to previous Fallout games that ran on my local PC.
---
Stock up on grape nuka from whitesprings- will remove 400 rads, but will not remove mutations.
---
Excellent info. I think I was slowly and clumsily getting at the idea of photographic evidence not being valid simply of its own accord, but you succinctly got there in one sentence.
---
I’ve had this all week and keep getting this daily. Getting rid of all the meat and then server hopping worked after a few times. I’ve had it also say talk to her but then she keeps saying stop ignoring me and doesn’t give me the mission.
---
I don't know about you but I had to pay for my game already.
---
Trust me I went wayyyy north and got really slammed, but thank you haha
---
What does stepping to the right have anything to do with respect? ;)
---
What system? I have a faster swinging... something, I think cultists dagger. It's lvl 15 I'm on XB1
---
Yeah that’s how I felt, takes 12 shots to kill this mutant he drops me 3, wild rides man
---
Stop making this about you ^jk ^happy ^birthday ^man
---
We play approx 1-3 days a week for 2-3 hours per session due to work restrictions and average between 3-10 legendaries each most days we play depending on what we do. Playing since beta. Unfortunately I havent noted them down as its only since the perveyor released i really started noticing the pattern as i was farming more.
---
I have a pretty good photographic memory so i would say my estimates for the drop rates are pretty accurate. I think i will start recording it from now on for curiositys sake.
---
Alright, but I’m holding you to that promise, not that I’m not having fun I’m just a bit off base I think
---
Question is, how much would you be willing to pay for them? Seems about the only way we get any content between DLC.
---
Just stay around or near Morgantown airport.  And don't feel bad dying a lot initially, its happened to all of us.  Just make sure to store or sell junk when you get the chance.
---
And all I got was this party hat.
---
Yeah, before you start getting decent damage perks (and to a certain point even after that) enemies are real bullet sponges.
---
Melee, though it can be a bit boring, is the go to weapon type early and midgame due to not needing any ammo. Try also to get a decent "heavy" weapon like an axe or a sledgehammer. The way damage is calculated, unless it has changed since I've been away, light fast weapons do less damage to armor so hitting the baddies with a big old death stick makes life a lot easier.
---
You should get plan for healing salve early on. Did you already do responder missions in Morgantown?
---
I do love death sticks, I really appreciate it man
---
agree.  I usually can get a megasloth to spawn at the NAR train yard in the bog.  This week I got mirelurk kings 5 times in a row, scorched, deathclaw, robots, and sheepsquatch.  I tried for what seemed forever and couldn't get the sloth.  Went to the sundew grove where I know one spawns and no luck their either.  
---
This wouldn't be so bad, except I couldn't get five radscorpions to spawn earlier in the week at middle mountain cabins after over an hour of trying.  
---
I have struggled with earning more than 20 or 30 atoms a day this past week.  Making five lead champagne was rough because I don't know enough tarberry locations to make five.  Swarm of suitors never popped up for me in spite of server hopping.
---
I have become adept at cross dressing, playing fireman, cosplaying as a fisherman, and performing various tasks in formal attire. 
---
Perhaps the changes mentioned in the most recent ITV will lead to improvements that make challenges entertaining and less silly.  Until then, I will continue to roam the wastes in my bathrobe, collecting flowers and scrapping junk for building materials.
---
I’m on An Ounce Of Prevention
---
Sorry I missed you. Had to pick up the wife at the airport...
---
Ok thanks!  I’ll try that next time it pops up.  Did you just get the meat again each time you server hopped?
---
oh, i've seen that around but didn't know what it was. Thank you 76 for teaching me new things....
---
Imma upvote u to take ur down vote away. It's not your fault you didn't know! But yeah, farm that mess, they regenerate LOL
---
Starched Genes is a must have if you want to reliably keep your active serum.
---
Good. Well that will bring you down toward Charlestown where there are plenty of scorched you can kill to get ammo. What type of gun are you rocking? When you can I would highly recommend upgrading your rifleman perks. Hunting rifle is very good early on.
---
Braman milk works in the same way as grap nuka cola.
---
It kept saying I had the meat and I did but she wouldn’t take it. So I get rid of it and went and got new meat. Out of all the dailies, this one I always have trouble with. But server hopping normal fixes it and she either gives me a new mission or carries on from the last.
---
Scalp 'em
---
I had the flowers quest, which I couldn't turn in. Each day for at least three days I tried to return and she would ignore me. 
---
Last night, I logged in and it said that I had Chloe's meat quest and the meats weren't checked off. I collected the meat, and for some reason it finally worked. I have no idea why it broke and why it started working again. 
---
I agree with /u/o00Hope00o's suggestion. Clear your inventory of the quest items, sever hop, and re-collect. If not, you might have a wait a day and try the same again. Good luck.
---
Yeah, the base game itself for average starting price was roughly £40-55. I'm not complaining that the kits are about 50 atoms though.
---
I’ve always wondered how pistol performs at high level.. thanks for your comment.
---
Flame arrows, rad arrows, poison arrows ( you now have flappy limb! )...
---
I was running Short Hunting and a standard 10mm but I have this single action with 120 ish shots and it’s kinda a beast rn, but from many recommendations I’m now using a melee weapons which happens to be a machete, and yeah the trek to Charleston seems like a shlep
---
Ive been using a 1\* vampire switchblade primary and The gutter (with electric charge mod) as secondary for &gt; 80 levels.  (Sometimes switch to AA ski sword for grins.)
---
I run in excavator most of the time.  I rarely consume  foods to enhance performance.  Never consumed a drug, mag, bobblehead for same.  Sometimes remember to power attack, but usually do not, since it takes so much AP.
---
Effectiveness:   I usually use an LMG against flying things (stabilized3), but last night by the WS Bunker service entrance, a L50 SB wanted to go to-to-toe - no sonics, no gas attacks, just landed in front of me, and stayed there swinging its wings.     
---
 I was already armed with the switchblade, so I  went for it.   
---
 Switchblade took it out, along with the 10 odd L48-62 ghouls and scorched. 
---
 Cleared that, across the street from the main bunker entrance, found 4x supermutants (L48+) and a L91 glowing deathclaw.
---
Still had the vampire switchblade in hand.  they all died, I didn't.
---
15 STR, gladiator, incisor, glow sight, martial artist. 
---
Lone Wanderer2, tenderizer1.
---
Luck is 3, with starched genes2 and class freak1. (I used to have bloody mess3 until I started toying with mutations - I've had up to 6 at once)
---
PA has Motion assist servos (+2 STR) and optimixed bracers - ( + str and reduced ap for power attacks.)
---
mutations: Marsupial and healing factor.   (will be re-adding speed demon and a couple others later)
---
As much as I like big cities like Megaton/Diamond City, I think it’s too early for that. These new factions probably only moved into the region recently, canonically speaking, so I imagine all their towns and outposts will be relatively small.
---
I have an Assassins Explosive Shotgun in my  Stash Box.
---
Just can not let it go.
---
With all the Shotgun Perks stacked it should be killing everything..Especially as the minimum   
---
 base damage is supposedly 350+.Throw in Covert Operative/Mr Sandman/mutations/Chems  should be well over 1k damage.
---
Yet you need 2/3 shots to kill a Mole Miner.Yet one swipe with a DCG with 320+ minimum Base damage kills Mole Miners instantly.
---
Something not right there.
---
The problem is you can’t believe half of what Wiki says about anything.  Since you live there and have a better feel for things then I’ll apologize.  You sounded like yet another feeling and emotion driven kid.
---
You know the Allies crushed the Nazis in the 40s and I’m sure there are still fringe groups here and there but I would choose to ignore them.  
---
Where I live if I wanted to be....I could be offended about something every day but I choose to not give those ignorant people power over me because that is what they are looking for.
---
In the 80s we had marches in our town and I won’t say what group because of being censored but we stayed home and didn’t give them the attention.  It took them several years but they finally stopped coming.  I don’t agree with their ideology and I don’t agree with censoring them either.  You erase history and younger generations can’t learn about it and it will repeat itself.
---
Like the number that offends you I’ve never heard of it, and just like the corporation I flew around with in Eve Online  named 4S ... many tried to get that banned because to some it was offensive but to them it meant something else.
---
If you're on PC you can download mods that highlight.
---
If u would of used vats you could of chose ur target...js and ya i farm thoes bots aswell.
---
So I am two hours ahead of you (according to Google). That will actually be handy on weekends. I tend to play earlier and then turn it off for the evening, so this works!
---
I'd be happy with just a 3 bolt magazine, like in NW.
---
Shotguns with enforcer. Enforcer maxed counts like 25% chance to cripple a limb and it counts for each individual pellet. Aim for one of the wings so it lands and close in with your melee weapon.
---
Exactly. Random does not mean evenly distributed events. Truly random events occur in streaks and clusters that humans perceive as patterns.
---
I would like this to happen and also would like to see you dual wielding 1handed weapons. Dual wielding meathooks 😍 haha
---
So if we imagine those resources as a fairground ride
---
You can pay $15 to bypass the queue so you don't have to wait?
---
Hmmm so I'm paying to avoid waiting.
---
I’m pretty sure if you retake a mutation it gives you the mutations effect without the downsides atall for 1+ hour. Correct me someone if I’m wrong., but I’m pretty sure that’s how it works!
---
However I would like a way to select witch mutation I take away! Maybe one of them inoculation pods you use to give yourself the scorched vaccine?🤔
---
Has anyone found Freddy Fears House of Scares as noted in the poster? Today might be a good day to go visit.
---
But now you're openly admitting to paying more money so that the game becomes functional. Like think about it, you're paying more for something you shouldve got on release.
---
It's amazing how Bethesdas fuckery and mind games are actually beginning to work
---
"and camps"
---
You are correct
---
Pistols seemed like they were designed for dual wield from the start. Their DPS is pitiful compared to rifles. Some of them are decent but there's always a rifle that can do the same job but much better.
---
The point is that there is white suppremesist symbology in the dude's name. 
---
How on earth do you change someone else's name?
---
Agreed it would be nice. With Herd Mentality beyond broke I really want to get rid of it on my rifleman but am too lazy to go through the process even though I can craft every mutation she currently has.
---
Dailies have been odd, Sometimes I get 2 dailies from each one, especially camden park.  for the last week, each day pop a squater has been triggered all the way up to the point where the targets are on the map. I don't have to start the quest or anything, just kill the targets and it completes, but next day it will be still waiting.  
---
It all started when I did not finish a Play time quest. I scrapped the toys.  I got it to finish, but a second play time quest had started. Now all those dailies are "halfway off"?????
---
i could see them trying to take back certain abandoned settlements if i recall correctly Sutton seemed to have makeshift fortifications if they could be rebuilt and strengthened it could make for a good start.
---
I was talking specifically about the part of his message that said camp builds. I didn't mention user names at all...
---
The advisor leading the current "Immigrants are the root of all evil" idiocy in the US was himself the great-grandson of an immigrant family who fled to America to escape deadly Jewish persecution in Russia.
---
It only took a couple generations to produce an ungrateful monster that would casually let his own great-grandparents die and fails to see any irony in that.
---
A random seed is merely the number that the randomizer starts from. Computer random number generators approximate true randomization after starting from a seed. 
---
Using an arbitrary seed number does not necessarily violate randomization. It's common practice.
---
This has been going on since the internet became a thing. Most of it is trolling. 
---
Funny how it becomes a problem 20, 30 years later when the political sphere is charged with language that entirely misrepresents the people involved to get a rise out of people unwilling to do further research.
---
Or just team up and get that bonus to your specials
---
WOW! Actually finding how these work kinda pisses me off! 
---
I honestly thought these were for putting a random legendary effect on one of your own weapons or armor, just seems sensible that they would work like that. But nope they are for some power armor I have no chance of ever managing to get  cause I solo the game 95% of the time.
---
I feel kinda scammed by this. I get not breaking down legendary items to custom build your own being easily exploited, but this constant slot machining I have to do to never ever get anything worth a damn, is really getting old and tiresome. Why can't I just put one on my gear and get a random effect?  I'm already using it, can't really be worse than nothing, or having to just cross my fingers for the exact weapon type I want to use!
---
Selling them the way they do just feels misleading!!
---
I remember the moment I first soloed one it was great.
---
I've got the point now where I just do it when they aren't attacking.
---
I was at whitesprings station the other day building a camp and suddenly 2 scorchbeasts descended on me (level 130) and some other guy (level 29). He was jumping around praying and panicing. So I just casually turned around, sprayed a few mags for my 2 shot handmade, let the other guy get a couple for loot then finished them
---
Watching his utter terror makes me miss moments in the game where an enemy encounter actually scared me
---
I’ve always been something of a save slut and I still feel like dying is worst case scenario, I also forgot the penalty was losing junk Which sucks but isn’t the end of the world I guess, thank you for the tip
---
I scrip daily on 3 characters with 2 separate accounts for the following results;
---
Account 1: 
---
* Main, level 350+, Full health, Stealth Rifleman: pulls good gear around 5%, uses Full Vanguard's armor and Instigating weapons, but has never pulled either from the Purveyor.
---
Account 2: 
---
* Character 1: Level 90+ Bloodied Stealth: Pulls good gear \~10%, has pulled several good Bloodied weapons, and Unyielding/Bolstering Armor
---
* Character 2: Level 20 Mule (Used @ level 11 for a couple months), pulls good/great gear \~50%
---
My experience has led me to believe that the quality of pulls is very Server specific, though I have not invested your level of effort into tracking any of this.
---
I always save up scrip for the sales to maximize my number of pulls.
---
I think the only weapons bench I’ve seen was at the airport and I didn’t use it
---
Different stock materials/designs, compound conversion, sights/scopes, different ammo compositions. Really want this because I have a crossbow sitting collecting dust that I will never get rid of because I have hopes for mods.
---
I have never seen it work. Starting to think it's broken
---
This should be able to see corpses standard. You shouldn’t need a perk card for it.
---
Just use whatever you like the most. Me personally prefer steering wheel with pedals
---
I know starched genes2 prevents loss of mutations, but I think it also prevents gaining mutations. 
---
If the latter is also true, then it gives you the ability to select which mutations you get.  Downside is no mutations would be "free" - you have to buy the serum.
---
My AAE combat shotgun was ridiculous in crowds and with dmg and stagger perks that was a dominant weapon.  Then the nerfs came and I got schooled repeatedly so my transition to an auto rifle build (mostly handmades) was complete.
---
Do you AP (Action Points) or AP (Armor Penetration)?
---
Yeah, I don't have any destroyed ones
---
The worst I saw was a swastika-riddled CAMP labelled "Trump Tower" complete with separate "White" and - *ugh* \- "Coloured" entrances.
---
I nuked it.
---
You and all of your tests and data, keep it up man. Fasnacht Man still remembers the hell we went through lol.
---
the whole game is a rip off
---
Ha ha that’s awesome 
---
Best I have seen so far was a camp I visited this week.  I select the vending machine and thousands of chems and stims and in neon above the machine “legit stuff” 
---
I laughed for a good 2 minutes
---
The wider problem is maybe that the foundations of the game itself are fundamentally broken. It wasn't built for this type of usage and itd take a long time to repurpose it properly. We might get a stable game one day but what's the point when there is a community of modders who will always be one step ahead of Bethesda
---
This engine has been modded for years and years, people know this engine back to front and Bethesda have encouraged that. People know it better than bethesda itself if we go by the quality of those mods
---
This problem will never go away while we use the creation engine.
---
We will get two settlements with npcs. One is space station. The other one might be in the opposite corner of the map. There will be a few single npcs in some small secluded locations. And that is it. Please don't expect too much. 
---
I think many locations stay untouched.
---
Could you summarize as to what further research would find?
---
Imho it’s the only PA mod for the helmet that I can really get any use out of...so I guess it stays.
---
I do run that toon in a team. Unfortunately one of the broken bits of the mutation is the +2 charisma does not work with card sharing. With Herd Mentality you need 11 charisma to share a 3 star card.
---
Great style and concept, I hope you sell a lot. That kind of effort and creativity should be rewarded!
---
Way north should problaby not be attempted until about L17 or so.
---
Stay in the forest and follow the overseers quest.  It'll keep oyu in more or less level appropriate areas.  between 17 and 20, head N to the big alligator.  At 27 or so, head south to the Ash heap.  At 40, the savage divide, and 45+, anywhere you want.
---
Along the way, start on the quests you picked up roaming the forest.
---
Scrap a lot of the stuff you pick up, and sell the junk to the bots at a train station.
---
Morgantown airport has lots of meds in the hangars, as well as a repeatable event.
---
They spawn again after they die?
---
Poor fluffy 😧
---
I know. Your brain doesn’t let you forget that time you forgot to save for 8 hours and you die. I’m watching it happen to my buddy who just started and I can see how I was the same way now. It really helps with the fun factor of this game to let go. However, there is something to be said about that apprehension of the new fallout world you find yourself in. That fear and excitement lends to the feeling of exploration, discovery, and accomplishment. This game was awesome because of that. When I started this game though there weren’t people with jet packs and dudes who could jump on top of a three story buildings one shot ing everything. You will be that dude though if you persevere.
---
Yeah, crossbows feel like an afterthought. I only used it around Morgan Town to get the "Kill scorched with crossbows" atom achievement, same with black powder weapons.
---
Would be awesome to add mods to it or even wacky colours. Just...something.
---
I never used left, so I didn’t notice anything
---
You are a small child
---
The collecting flowers one, is the one I hate the most.  It’s so hard to find the flowers, even though I know roughly were they are.  I sometime get this daily at least 5 times a day for some reason and I’d just ignore it but it’s extra scrip.
---
If you see someone steal, do you see them as a thief?
---
Oh wow, you did this? It's incredible!! BGS could take a page from this (huehuehue)
---
There is a way but it is not quite legal if you know what I mean
---
Well, one for sure. The only gym I hit up for lead is site alpha because that is where my camp is. Good for only 80-100 lead though.
---
JFC you're an idiot lol
---
Are you aware that some people make online avatars not because they believe those things 
---
But
---
Because it sends people like you crazy?
---
Like if they saw this thread theyd probably just laugh at you.
---
 They won and you let them, you don't fight this shit by overreacting, you fight it by not giving it the power to affect you so much.
---
 \*Diluted\* radaway / diluted radx does not supress mutation effects.
---
I'm at work, but i've got a cell photo of one of mine from the Red Rocket weekly. Its only waist up though. Imgur is blocked so let me see if i can upload it somewhere else
---
[Here you go](https://ibb.co/2Szm1Vs)
---
Probably a troll, and you made their day because they knew it pissed you off
---
Okay so I maybe the only one but I like the look I have with the trapper chest clipping through the elders battlecoat
---
LOL I wish I could have witnessed that
---
Smooth move exlax. 
---
Admittedly, many of us have done dumb shit like this. Myself included.
---
Also if you search for the Free States Revolutionary Outfit you may have better luck:  
---
[linky](https://fallout.gamepedia.com/Free_States_Revolutionary_Outfit)
---
 Just keep reporting them for causing you harassment by displaying such symbols.
---
Pretty sure Bethesda will ban these types of players in a Heartbeat.
---
I was out of heavy ammo and my all rise had broken after storming the silo and that's all I had left apart from a 10mm pistol
---
Pics or it didn't happen
---
I had a lot of fun doing the challenge to kill enemies with crossbows. Only killed low level Scorched as it's so weak, but it sends then flying! Hope it will get some love in wastelanders, because the trailer shows someone with a bow so I suspect archery will be a thing.
---
Happy Nuke Day.
---
I wonder what they are going to do. I know we are supposed to get an update today.
---
I dont mind the look of most of it. The backpack is just ugly, really would prefer my black shovel backpack to be visible
---
Where is the “pubic” event at?
---
OP needs to visit Lucky Hole mine.
---
I waited two or three weeks and got it half off.
---
Yeah morgantown airport in the chest at the end
---
1500 caps should get you 5 mutation serums at vendors.  I eventually bought recipes for the ones I use. Useful for when I want to dump scally skin for a berserker gun, or take a second serum to negate the downside for an hour, like if you need every bit of intelligence for crafting. 
---
Respecing mutations is easy. Just take a shower, and re-mutate with a few serums.
---
I got my original mutations the hard way. Gambling with rad aways hopping at barrels. I highly suggest just spending a days worth of caps instead.
---
That mega sloth challenge can fuck right off. I spent an hour server hopping and traveling around the bog to the five or so locations it can spawn until I *finally* got the sloth/yao guai random encounter by the Thorn. But the sloth glitched out and was just floating in the air, not alive or a dead container. Just there, unkillable, taunting me. 
---
A tip for the tarberries, there are a bunch in the little creek just south of the Watoga station. Start there and head toward the sunken train yard and you should be able to get more than enough with Green Thumb. If you're still short, they're in the water in most of the sundew groves.
---
Wait.
---
Unless something happened, you're lying.
---
Bottle cap mines were quietly removed by Bethesda just over two months ago.
---
I was one of the ones selling them.
---
Put up a pic of this maybe?
---
Bottle cap mines are back?  I had one and it was removed from my stash.  I also heard about a throwable duping glitch going around too.
---
Lucky hole has a ridiculous amount of lead
---
roflol
---
They blend in with the terrain, or are blown to bits and you can't see the bits.  Or they are blown away with an explosion and are off-screen somewhere.
---
Press Alt-F4 to pay respects.
---
That's what I thought too, I had one in my stash in order to make them and it vanished.
---
Be careful what you ask for as after they "fix" it the armor is going to clip through buildings.
---
Hey, but you got a new possum badge, right?
---
Thanks for the tarberry tip.  That should work well the next time that challenge pops up.
---
Wow very nicely done, looks like it could be an actual in game location. Wish I could visit. I build classic style too, I thinks it's more immersive myself. Dont get me wrong love seeing all the cool unique ways to build camps but sometimes they make my head hurt.
---
I suppose if one has a group of people that they play with on the regular, they could split the bill so to speak? Set up a PayPal or whatever so it's not as pricey?
---
It’s gotten to a point with me if I am at an event and see someone hogging the kills then you best bet I will initiate PvP with said player.
---
I guess my point is that a live service game with no end game content at all is a terrible strategy. There’s a lot of ground between absolutely no end game content and having infinite replayability.
---
Im starting to see a pattern here in this post. Not only are most Fallout fans dog people, but they also love to eat cats.
---
It’s on YouTube and totally not worth it unless you need copious amounts of steel.
---
Stop being lazy and just go naked ;p. Honestly I've been using no armor to avoid clipping in my Blue Miltary Outfit.
---
I found about 200 Nuke Mines at Sutton Station. They were littered all over the floor and other surfaces. I picked them all up and sold them. I think they may be related to some dubious activity.
---
This last week I've seen a lot them in some vending machines too.
---
Recently was a dupping exploit with throwable weapons, so that's probably a good answer for why there's a lot more than before.
---
Right, I'm more confused by the OP saying it was bottle cap mines.  They were removed from the game not ming ago.
---
Killing 6 robots and then killing 1 more every 30 seconds grants you that +60% damage from Adrenaline though
---
Don't forget a wall or fence, just to be sure.
---
Fluffy still didn’t spawn 😞
---
I’ve played this game far less overall hours than I played FO4, and feel like I’ve pretty much “seen it all” already, that says a lot to me.
---
I’ll upload a pic as soon as i can, but a player dropped 8 of them at Watoga Station, 228 damage or something i guess, and you can collect the caps
---
Havnt played in about 2 months, definitely getting on tonight to celebrate!
---
No bottle cap mines unless it’s pc and someone pulled out of dev room. Only way I think it’s possible.
---
Also, as a strait male, do you think I have choice that I'm uncomfortable when man walks up to me and asked if he can buy me a drink?
---
I've seen them in vendors recently as well, bought one for 2k the other day.  You're right that they were removed a while ago but they've somehow come back, although you can't learn to craft them by picking one up now like you used to.  I'd imagine someone found a way to get into the dev room again and spread them with that throwable duping exploit.
---
The most important info is always in the comments
---
That's the only way I would think.  I had one on ps4 before their removal.
---
I guess ? I’ll post a pic as soon as i’m home. Dude was throwing them at Watoga Station and left 8 in a paper bag
---
I was at uranium about an hour ago with my new toy but was only hitting them for 3/4 damage on the first hit. Only need to use one shot, don't see the point wiling them all out with it
---
You could tell him that you're not interested, but I respect your opinion
---
What platform?
---
The Netherlands?
---
Think so too...cool to have one tho, just for show
---
C+ Santa Monica Fascist Stephen Miller? Fuck that guy.
---
Random roll of the dice number of hours.
---
Lucky Hole Mine, probably.
---
So they are charging subscriptions after all. 
---
The number of people who said this would come but were shot down by the fanboy mob before launch. 
---
Proven right again and again,
---
This. Perhaps they could glow for a bit in contrast to the terrain. I've lost several not knowing where they were launched to....
---
How so?
---
7
---
I didnt downvote OP, and I feel like the fact that I played FO4 more than 76 before feeling a little bored validates my point not contradicts it? Unless I am totally misunderstanding your comment, which I suspect I am.
---
PC !
---
There is one at the overseers camp. Some sort of bench is at every train station or red rocket (could be chemistry, weapon, armor, power armor). Also you should be able to make your own weapons workbench at your camp and bring your camp with you anywhere. Highly recommend adding some mods to increase your accuracy and firepower.
---
And the best part is the queen is 75 percent resistant to explosives!
---
I think they should bring dual wield combat/handmade rifles when you're in power armor.
---
Happy Fallout Day everyone! Pretty pumped for Mischief Night!
---
It's been a little while since the last patch, so here is a Bloated Glowing Buglist.

***THE BUG SHOWCASE***
---
A few more yet-unfixed bugs/oversights that I am revisiting just in case they were forgotten:
---
* Event - Lode Baring - When the mine begins to collapse, [audio from the Charleston Church miscellaneous quest](https://imgur.com/a/pkhoeNP) (Melody Larkin) will incorrectly play
---
* Event - Bots On Parade - Enemies spawned by this event are frequently [not hostile to the player](https://imgur.com/a/CV0syhp)
---
* Event - Project Paradise - World spawns of Fragrant Venison cannot be picked up, and are [missing textures for their particle effect](https://imgur.com/a/GSpegJt)
---
* Dead creatures and robots still [continue to animate as if they are alive](https://imgur.com/a/hXq4Qmi), if they were already dead before you fast traveled to their location (this includes Anglers, Bloatflies, Bloodbugs, Snallygasters, Mr. Handys and more)
---
***Bugs and Oversights***
---
* Vault 94 - Thorn Armor doesn't specify that the "Melee attackers bleed" effect is only a percentage chance to occur, not guaranteed 
---
* Vault 94 - Reviving players in Vault 94 sometimes gives you the message "Only the quest owner can pick this up."
---
* Vault 94 - Cave Crickets do not correctly count for the "Kill Mirelurks or Insects in Vault 94" challenge (they are missing the ActorTypeBug keyword)
---
* Vault 94 - Mission 1 - The announcer's voiceline, "Operation complete. You may now access: the Utility and Agriculture Wings." is transcribed incorrectly, it should be "Operation complete. You may now access: the Utility Wing and the Agriculture Wing."
---
* Nuclear Winter - Quick Kits cannot be manually favorited, even though they get automatically favorited into open slots
---
* Nuclear Winter - A crate in Grafton Steel [incorrectly contains a plan](https://imgur.com/a/SwzEGhx)
---
* The Black Powder Pistol has an [incorrect unholstering animation](https://imgur.com/a/GsYMOGF)
---
* The Vault 63 Access Control Terminal [incorrectly shows alias names](https://imgur.com/a/7DQc3Oi) for the vault door status
---
* This truck outside Hornwright Testing Site #3 has [oversized occlusion and collision boxes around it](https://imgur.com/a/zJxswfh), you can see nearby objects visibly unloading
---
* Electrically Charged particle effects [turn red and purple towards the end of the animation](https://imgur.com/a/D1LtoZJ)
---
* The Pioneer Scouts 'Squirrel Banner' can be seen in CAMP Floor Decor even though it [cannot be obtained or built](https://imgur.com/a/ATnmJRV)
---
* 'Beer Keg' can be seen in CAMP Misc. structures even though it [cannot be obtained or built](https://imgur.com/a/sN0LtLi)
---
* Atom Shop - Pint-Sized Slasher Costume - Underarmor doesn't get hidden by this outfit, and [visibly clips through it](https://imgur.com/a/5qTiMcc)
---
* The Vault 51 Overseer Chair doesn't have the 'Press and Hold' activator prompt, and [just activates with one button press](https://imgur.com/a/1tILcSC)
---
* Slocum's Joe Excavator Helmet skin has [no headlamp while deployed](https://imgur.com/a/GcELKHJ)
---
* Getting out of Power Armor sometimes [turns the player's head invisible](https://imgur.com/a/U5QzvQs)
---
* Trapper Chest armor [clips through all outfits](https://imgur.com/a/fm7nctN) instead of being hidden by them
---
* Fasnacht Beret has [missing textures on the emblem](https://imgur.com/a/ianDMDZ)
---
* This building near Watoga Shopping Plaza has a doorway on its bridge that has no collision, [allowing you to reach unintended areas](https://imgur.com/a/TsGiQLr)
---
* The Kanawha Nuka-Cola Plant has 2 incorrectly sized Nuka-Cola bottle structures with bugged collision. [The one near the plant](https://imgur.com/a/Yofw2BC) is massively oversized, and can be walked through, [while the bottle in the water](https://imgur.com/a/KellXQ9) has no collision at all
---
	
---
* Hitting the Aim-Down-Sights (ADS) key during the firing animation of certain weapons, like the Combat Shotgun or Plasma Rifle, results in you being locked into ADS until you hit the ADS key again
---
* Daily Quest - Stings and Things - Scout Leader Treadly's line, "I'll just whip up a batch and you're ready to go. Just drink it down and..." is transcribed incorrectly, it should be "I'll just whip up a batch and you're ready to go. Drink this down, and..."
---
* Forest Scout Armor Mask and Vault 94 Scout Armor Mask cannot be worn with headwear (even though the Urban Scout Armor Mask can), this is because they still occupy Slot 46 (Headband)
---
* Dolly Sods Lookout and Dolly Sods Wilderness have the same exact fast travel spawn point
---
* Serendipity does not specify that it does not function while wearing Power Armor
---
* Cave Crickets are missing the ActorTypeBug keyword, meaning they do not count as insects for the purposes of challenges, Insect Repellent, or the Exterminator perk
---
* Radtoads are missing the ActorTypeAquatic keyword, meaning they do not count for challenges relating to Aquatic/Semi-Aquatic creatures
---
* Getting in or out of Power Armor causes perks to not apply to your weapon until you swap weapons or re-equip it - very easily seen with reload speed perks
---
* If a Honeybeast spawns as a 'Scorched Honeybeast', any Bee Swarms it produces are hostile to the Scorched Honeybeast
---
* The legendary Scorched in the Morgantown Airport Terminal doesn't drop legendary items
---
* Sweetwater's line, "Challenging day? Well, tea will make the world right again." is incorrectly transcribed, it should be "Challenging day? Well, a nice cup of tea will make the world right again."
---
* If you have already completed 'Bucket List' quest, the "Investigate the suspicious person" objective from the personal terminal will never go away, even after finding the body
---
* Challenge - 'Kill creatures that have become Scorched' challenge only counts Scorched and Scorchbeasts, but not any of the other creature types
---
***Quality of Life Wishlist***
---
* Unlock the 'Wood Helmet' and 'Marine Armor Helmet', some players already have these (obtained from QASmoke cells) so it doesn't seem like there's any reason for them not to be made legitimately obtainable
---
* Add duration indicators to the UI buff/debuff bar under player Action Points
---
* Add a live progress bar for future community events to the main menu. Community events are a great idea but they need more visibility!
---
* Add damage numbers for damage-over-time effects like poison, acid, fire and bleed
---
* Separate damage numbers for ballistic/energy/radiation damage, perhaps with different colors
---
* Add the "You are in a nuke zone!" warning from Nuclear Winter to Adventure mode
---
***Gameplay/Balance Wishlist*** 
---
* Vault 94 - Buff the Thorn Armor set bonus, it is pretty feeble next to Solar and Strangler. This is meant to be top-tier armor, but the bleed is quite weak, can only be applied with melee, and the "Melee attackers bleed" effect is only a % chance, instead of guaranteed
---
* Vault 94 - Increase the spawn rate of Rad Ants in Missions 2 and 3 (I have 150+ runs across all 3 missions, and I am still only at 80/940 Rad Ant kills)
---
* Buff Plague Walker
---
* Add perks that synergize with Plague Walker, such as a Starched Genes for diseases, so that it can become a viable build option. Radiation has perks that give you benefits for having rads (like Radicool), would be cool if diseases had something similar
---
* Give Water Filters multiple charges, spending all of those materials for a single Purified Water is not worth it when you can just build a Water Purifier
---
* Add the Alien Blaster to the legendary list (and buff it please!)
---
* Make level 45/50 versions of the Chainsaw and Drill, and add them to the legendary list
---
Cheers!
---
Welcome to ESO 76.
---
Get fucked dickhead. 
---
My great grandfather was one of the pioneers of what would become US Navy Seals. Step great grandfather was a US Navy Bomberdier
---
You can fuck right off with that shit, it's uncalled for and extremely disrespectful towards our veterans.
---
One quick note that you may have noticed in your testing but haven’t mentioned —if I don’t log in for a few days, suddenly my drops for the first server I join afterwards become “lucky”.
---
Seems like a player retention incentive.
---
They have said this multiple times and yet there have been many delays since nw content started rolling out
---
I love the idea. A perk card that can be swapped on or glasses is the perfect way to do it. I don’t necessarily want every single corpse to glow all the time—there’s a lot of corpses in this game and it would be ugly—so being able to do it as needed would be great. A settings toggle could also work. 
---
In the meantime, if it helps alleviate your frustrations, you can sort of use your camera. I do it to find legendaries I’ve lost track of. Just get out the camera and look in different directions. When you stop moving it’ll pop the names up of what you’re looking at. It doesn’t glow or anything, but at least points you in the right direction. It even works for the infamous “Invisible” corpses.
---
Great work! I've been following this and ordered myself a copy. :)
---
 The Scrapbox is a separate container from your Stash and offers unlimited storage space for all your components. 
---
"unlimited" is a very nice word when talking about storage space.
---
7 people lame
---
oh yes it most certainly does.
---
I have 3 luck, usually starched genes2 and class freak 1.  
---
LAst weekend, was in a nuke zone, ducked inside WS bunker to craft some stable flux.   Swapped SG2 and  CF1 for superduper.  When I was done, forgot to re-equip SG2/CF1.
---
Since I was in a nuke zone, hit the door, then popped a couple diluted radways and RadX as usual.  Noticed electrically charged didn't fire.  Though maybe I had taken non-diluted radx.  Rads were building, popped another...seemed to be moving slower... By the time I realized what I had done, I had lost 5 out of the 6 mutations I had at the time.
---
Legendary scorch beasts? Seasonal event? Seasonal rewards for NW? Heck yes thank you.
---
People are either gonna love or hate. We knew we'd have to pay for a private world and I think the cost is reasonable. Especially since I want to support the game long-term.
---
12 dollars  a month???? We are adding a subscription to Fallout 76. Just... how did they think this was a good idea? And locking the much loved Ranger armor behind it. I understand private servers, but to just use them we need to pay 12 dollars a month?
---
You just really cant read a room Bethesda. I love yah, but wow
---
Massive backlash for such a pitiful amount of players on a private world incoming.
---
Took your advice just now, and literally laughed like an idiot the whole time. Thanks for sharing THAT little tidbit. lol
---
Reasonable or not, The fanboys insisted they would never charge for this and went ape shit on anyone predicting it.
---
How do I undo reject the buried with honour quest now
---
The Fallout 1st subscriptions are $18 per month in Canada. So for three months' cost I could buy basically any other game. And I have no more quests to complete and have a great build with cool weapons. 
---
Seems... really not worth it. Say what you want about ESO, it's got 10x more content.
---
A monthly membership is $13, $100 for a year. Don't know why they made it so you had to go to the checkout page to find that
---
This mental image just made the world a better place!
---
I’m not saying I didn’t get my money’s worth time-wise, I’m saying compared to other live service games the content updates are sparse and very spread out, they aren’t executing on that concept very well. And of course live service games are designed to be your “main” game, otherwise why invest so much on continuous updates? The idea is keep people playing/buying mtxs, add more content to keep the loop going. This concept doesn’t work when you only get a content update every 6 months or longer, and that content update is 3 new missions, or a PvP mode that only half the playerbase would be interested in.
---
It really is a shame that it is only for 1st, since it's what, like a dozen items and a count? Should be available for everyone imo.
---
Can you move back and forth freely
---
Prepare for the butthurt
---
I don't mind most of this but it's unfortunate that the FAQ says you can't edit rulesets
---
the ranger outfit is part of the fallout 1^st :(
---
Wait... scrap box can be used in public world’s? Wtf
---
As most of us are mutated. Over 60% of the player base has atleast 1 mutation. I for one have every mutation. So why is it if it was dependent on build would it give you every type vs just 1 type of armor or weapon.
---
*insert and here we go Joker meme*
---
Ight imma head out
---
The Fallout 1st subscriptions are $18 per month in Canada. So for three months' cost I could buy basically any other game. I have no more quests to complete, a great build with cool weapons, Wastelanders is months away, and I'm still dealing with significant bugs.
---
Fallout fist?
---
So I must conform to someone else's standard? I cant say no and leave becouse I'm uncomfortable there now?
---
Very cool! I'm an avid builder in 76, honed from watching others, I'll def take a look!
---
It’s 12$ a month but still
---
It doesn't seem as bad as I first thought, especially when I saw they are giving you 1650 atoms a month with it. It is a private server that you are mostly paying for, since server space is a real cost. I don't think it is terribly over priced for what it is.
---
Is the double entendre intended?
---
Lol. Best song i listen to right now.
---
I have a primed / instigating / improved hit crossbow that's great fun to sneak around with. In Chameleon, it'll kill just about anything and they never know I'm there.
---
We eventually killed everything. It was just a tough battle. This was when the game was pretty new so no legendary stuff.
---
I'll be getting this soley for the ranger armor outfit lol
---
But caps are so easy to come by that you end up buying random shit just to stay under max caps
---
Their update schedule is still very sparse and slow compared to other live service games, they are not doing a good job of maintaining player interest. And this is not helped by the fact that the game launched with 0 end game content. An MMO like game cannot sustain its playerbase without worthwhile end game content or constant updates.
---
All i know is i get an absurd amount of auto grenade launchers. Honestly heavy weapons in general. I started a heavy weapons character because i get so many from the purveyor. Sure its rng, but they move around decimal points to manipulate it.
---
It's going to make things better for everyone. Paid or not.
---
$100 for the year seems a bit steep. I was hoping for more like $60.
---
In Canada it is $18 per month. US$12 is C$15.75.  We pay $35 extra per year above the exchange rate. I guess it's an annexation tax.
---
Did they really have to lock the Ranger Outfit behind a paywall??
---
Seems like no one even mentions the far worse communist symbols every where
---
I bought the game twice. What am I going to do, as a solo player, in a private world for £99 a year?
---
You fixed the ash and goo pile repsawn issue! Thanks dudes.
---
Oh no man I didn’t mean your comment, I quite agreed with it. FO4 had way more content even before you add the DLC’s to it. Something is wrong if a single player game has more content than an ongoing MMO from the same company!
---
if you hold them to what they said and having to many items in a 24 player world creates to many problems. Then i can see why. If you have unlimited with up to 7 people that will not be a strain on the server. think how many people duped so much and carried 10k in weight. it didnt help.
---
Bobble heads and magazines weigh less, sweet!
---
And every one of you owes me 100 ded nazis
---
I made it as far as reading the Fallout 1st bs. Nope. No. Not happening. I was a consistent atom purchaser. I defended this game and Bethesda. But now I'm done. This game is dead to me. The CORE game is still lacking SO MUCH and your solution is to add a bloody SUBSCRIPTION and lock things behind that? Screw you guys. I don't know which once great studio fell harder at this point:  Bioware or you guys.
---
I get that, but at the same time I think that maybe only one person had to pay for it. So like a group can host a server that others can join. I understand why they did this to a point.... but this game is getting pricey for the lack of things to do
---
The only thing i hate is the scrap box. It seems like it will hurt the servers and you have to pay for it. Other then that I think it's a decent deal with the bonus monthly atoms.
---
It’s £11.99 a month in the U.K. - $15.44 at the current mid market rate.
---
We're sorry to see you go, friend, but best wishes and I hope you don't go TOO far away. People are the best part of this game!
---
Take my money... err... atoms!!!
---
Sorry, I was a little excited to read this.
---
Ah of course. Old bomby. Feels like it happened yesterday.
---
Lmfao, but you don’t have to pay for wasteland health care.
---
Serum removes the negative penalty from the mutation for a duration.
---
Everyone always forgets that ;-)
---
Ah yes, id like to buy an online subscription to play my game subscription to get simple features that should be open to all
---
Survival tents will make my lead runs a lot quicker.
---
I didn't say dependent on build mate, i think its tied to a permanent character ID.
---
Business is a boomin'

Thank fuck for that!
---
Another week and they still haven't brought the old NW map back into circulation :( I miss Flatwoods
---
I just want to be at the top of world .....
---
The tent and the ranger outfit have been requested since forever, it's kind of a dick move to paywall them behind the new "premium" whatever...
---
12.99 per month or $ 99.99 for 1-year
---
I've submitted these before, but they're some of my favorite.
---
https://imgur.com/a/gpJzd56
---
I'm a fanboy and knew there'd be a charge for a private world, that's pretty typical. 
---
This is a nice patch, aside ffrom the subscription anyway so take it as a sign that more $ equals a better experience for everyone.
---
Have not been a fan of some of their choices, but this seems much more reasonable than other stuff.
---
I’m just wondering if the scrap box and survival tent is available on both private and public worlds, or if it’s only on private
---
This is getting embarrassing at this point.
---
To add to this: the crux of the problem is that most loot is garbage. Since there are millions of combinations of legendary effects, and since 85-90% are considered bad rolls (due to the effects being weak, bad synergy with character perks, bad synergy with weapon, etc), you have a very small chance of getting something decent, let alone a good item you actually want.
---
As a result, cheating and exploiting are widespread because to compete in PvE and PvP with others you need to get items from a tiny pool of “viable”/“meta” items that everyone else wants. This further breaks the economy and devalues caps as a currency, etc, since meta items are priceless and everything else is valueless.
---
To fix duping would require many changes, #1 of which would be redoing loot entirely. If you look at Diablo 3, you have some set legendary items and class sets, but they can be configured very widely depending on the stat rolls: a helmet may give you more damage % the lower your health, but that % would vary on the roll you looted. This allows you to quickly build your character around a specific playstyle early and then focus on micro-optimizing each and every stat in the build.
---
Instead in Fallout 76 you have to hunt, and hunt, and hunt for the playstyle-defining items you’re after, and if you’re supremely lucky you might obtain the items. However the only optimization to your build is limited to getting a godroll on the same item in your possession. If you ever do achieve that, you’ve completed your build and now have nothing to do.
---
No I haven't, I'm the only one of my team left, everyone else has already jumped ship. Some of them tried some raids early on but got stuck behind buggy terminals and doors so we left it.
---
"Bobbleheads: Weight reduced from 1 lb to 0.01 lb.
---
Magazines: Weight reduced from 0.5 lb to 0.01 lb."
---
Awwwww, yisssssss!
---
"If the owner leaves, the world will stay active as long as one other player in the world is a Fallout 1st member. "
---
Awwwwww, noooooo!
---
Can the scrap box be placed in adventure mode or private servers only
---
Still not pay to win. It’s just scrap, I literally drop scrap because I don’t need it.
---
There are several now.  Tea Time, Load Barring, and Uranium Fever to name a few. Uranium Fever is probably the most common, as it yields three legendary enemies. The problem with ANY event that spawns a legendary is the chance that some one will just one shot kill it and no other players will get a chance for a legendary. This has been (in my opinion) a problem since launch. You have some (not all) higher level players that just sit back and do nothing until legendary spawns then rush in and one shot kill it. Again in my opinion meat week was a much better event because you had players from level 1 to 500+ that could work together. After event was complete every player got rewarded fairly.
---
I love shotguns, expecially the combat one and I have the build for it. With the correct build and a bloodied combat shotgun you one-shot almost everything. I have also a two shot explosive combat shotgun but unfortunately Bethesda mistakely think that two shot is too much powerful so the accuracy is crap.
---
Will it make things better though? It seems like they are just trying to get money out of people who are willing.
---
Sooooooo.  No social menu fixes huh?
---
Bombarded with games perhaps but I feel like the quality and creativity are dropping fast. The last games I bought were red dead, fallout 76 (I started late), and greedfall, those were like months apart, and now there’s such a drought, I’m back to playing old XB 360 games for something different. Outer worlds looks cool but I’m not that hyped for it, it looks like a decent AA game like greedfall but nothing earth shattering. Borderlands 3 I’ll probably get to but once again more of the same there. The only game coming out in the near future that truly looks like it’ll be something fresh, original, innovative is Cyberpunk. And I’d say RDR2 was the last game to push any sort of boundary in terms of innovation, and even then I kind of got bored of that game before I beat it, too much downtime and long distance traveling. I just totally disagree that the industry is flooded with great games, I feel it’s quite the opposite, and should be EASIER to maintain player interest bc the industry is so lacking in vision and creativity.
---
Is this the 1.29 update on PS4?
---
Take a look at www.nukesdragons.com. You can plan out builds from there and even see what levels different perks become available. This game is super reliant on your build, much more so than previous games. If you’re taking perks for carry weight, durability, etc, you’re going to have a tough time. Even a few damage perks for your preferred weapons will make the early game a lot easier. 
---
Take a few workshops too. You’ll get some important plans for CAMP building from them, and decent chunks of XP from the defense events. Just be sure to scrap and stash your junk before you go to the workshop. “Raiders” like to show up at workshops and “Raid” low level players. If you dump your junk first, you just lose a couple caps if it happens. 
---
The game is a slog up until about level 30-35 if you’re at least a little bit focused on a proper build. Once you’re there, you’ll see that you start to overpower many more enemies. By 50, you’ll be wishing for a challenge.
---
Yea, agreed, I do like that you don't have to be a 1st member to join a hosts server. And yea, completely agree with the lack of things to do and things being pricey. I hit about 60 and got bored, so I just grinded out to 100 for trophies and now don't really have interest in playing. Maybe if WL's has trophies I will come back but.... Lol
---
Yeah... probably should have waited after Wastelanders to do this  :/
---
Yep. The price is way too much for one game. Bethesda this is exactly what we didn't want. They should drop the price to 8-10 USD or this is going to blow up in their face
---
Explosive bolts please.
---
That's C$20! Wow, they're really screwing everybody outside the US.
---
Goodbye 👋
---
Both.
---
Yeah, you’re totally right, but this makes me feel better and that’s what counts.
---
Okay. Is anybody listening? Anybody? That's what I thought. Well, if anyone does hear this, come see me at city hall. I have something to... nevermind. Just come see me. Right away. As in now, or sooner. Why noone is coming to see me?
---
Read the latest patch notes....
---
For real? That seems kind of unfair
---
How do you deal with the poor accuracy of Tse?
---
Might just be like eso with the crafting bag when your sub ends you can take out the materials but can no longer put things in.
---
buy war bonds
---
Bye.You wont be missed.
---
K. BYE.
---
I'm not phased by spending money on games but I agree it is high
---
why is the survival tent and ranger outfit locked behind fallout 1st? as stand alone items they would be much better received and probably sell better
---
They said if your membership expires you'll still be able to acess it you just cant make deposits
---
Isn't that the nature of most business?
---
Didn't they argue earlier that they couldn't increase stash size because of servers, and now, they are.... increasing stash size, effectively, but making you pay for it?
---
Wait you can transfer your character between private and public servers?
---
Yes
---
the 'no cosmetix' was a dead letter the moment repair kits became a thing.
---
im looking fwd to (finally) inviting my friends to play 76; not looking fwd to leaving the ps4 on for several days for if/when my buddies want to connect
---
NCR veteran ranger armor, I see
---
Birthday buddies for life!
---
Wow on your bike.. You want money for private instances... Private servers is something you promised from day 1 on the roadmap and never said you would charge for it how greedy can you get... this update has been the last straw for me game uninstalled.
---
Bye
---
It is pay to win. Scrap/junk is literally how you craft stuff, just because you've been playing and have bulk doesn't mean others do.
---
Yeah, I'm struggling to believe this will be funneled back into making a better game.
---
That was fun. Enjoy the game? Sweet, have at it. Hate it? Have at it. If this is what Elder Scrolls 6 or Fallout 5 (if they don’t give up on the IP) will be like, then I won’t play it. If you want to play it anyways, have fun.
---
12.99 per month or 
---
99.99 for 1-year
---
Might aswell make it free and refund everyone that bought the game atoms worth the amount of the game at this point. 
---
What a joke.
---
Yes was going to say this the exchange rate is a fucking joke. £99.99 for the year here
---
I have a question I’m not really seeing an answer to. It says we keep the cosmetic items and emotes and even scrapbox if our subscription ends or is cancelled, but what about the survival tent? Do we lose the ability to use or place it once the subscription ends?
---
Won't this enable people to craft obscene amounts of ammo which will in turn inflate weapon prices on the market?
---
Did you say junk? -- we're properly farked now; people will be lording their massive swinging piles of junk all over us (not to mention fridges and robots!) , and we'll be forced to admit defeat, leaving them and only them the true winners of the wasteland.
---
I gave up months ago, I’ll check out Wastelanders when it drops but this is just another cash grab without adding any content. At this point I’m losing faith in their ability to make games, I’m not excited about Starfield any more and almost hope ES6 doesn’t get made and tarnish the entire series.
---
That's about the same as what they're still charging for PlanetSide 2. That's why I don't have the premium membership to PlanetSide 2.
---
Simply dont pay for the sub?
---
Erm what's fallout premium? Got a link?
---
freaking millenials. lol
---
If they just had ONE thing that they could do that other weapons couldn't that would be best.
---
You'd still have to waste hours of your life looting. Having extra storage is hardly going to win you the game.
---
Oh they done fucked up....
---
are you fucking kidding me right now? adding subscription? to a PAID game? while the core game still lacks a shit tone of things!!its like they literally WANT people to hate them.
---
Exactly, that’s why they only collect the stuff that puts the company in a positive light. They know that my posts will just get them in trouble.
---
Bye and play a multiplayer game solo lol
---
Where does this info come from??
---
GameStop literally gave me $25 off a new XBox if I took the FO76 edition they had in the back room.  I C played the game for about 10 hours and just couldn’t stand the glitches or the game, honestly.
---
But with private servers, when mod support comes, I’ll play again and pay up.
---
If you think all you get is more scrap storage then you did not read the same info I did.
---
Yeah this is just insane. When i was reading those notes i was like "yeah finaly more events, game will be worth to be online again" and booom here they want another money.
---
Since release all patches added just bugs, or way to take money from us.
---
Worst marketing ever.
---
Excellent, less than I was expecting.
---
Yeah and 18$ sounds like a good deal to me... 21 CAD here in Norway. You don’t need to get it, adventure worlds work the same as always
---
It is a lot of nerve to pull a stunt like this when the game itself could be so much better. If these funds are going to help create a better game and feed developers, I’m all game, otherwise this is a dick move.
---
How the fuck did they make the ranger armour look *worse* than in new vegas?
---
From them right now on their twitter and site
---
Oh boy, the anti bethesda youtube channels are gonna have a field day with this. Doesn't sound that bad after reading a second time. Probably going to wait till wastelanders though.
---
It doesn’t take long though, take twenty minutes and you can have more junk than you can handle. It’s pay for convenience at best, I’m stoked for this membership honestly. Yes it could be cheaper but I’m canceling netfilx for this lol
---
They've been screwing up the community
---
Thanks,id like to stay far away from people like you.
---
Oh god what did Bioware do?
---
Sweet, thank you.
---
No problem if all your aiming for is the legs, or the ground around the legs. Enemy legs are made of pudding so the slightest tap is enough to make it into pulp
---
Yeah it looks like you can.
---
Subscription based single player experience, EA would be proud!
---
Fucking finally.
---
This is graftons mayor......
---
I would buy the ranger outfit but I’m not paying £13 for it (one month sub fee)
---
Fuck this shit.
---
This is unacceptable.
---
Bethesda blatantly lied that they won't become like EA and Activision.
---
These microtransactions are the definition of P2W. 
---
Nothing can save this game anymore, not even wastelanders.
---
This kinda sucks for friends that wanted to split the cost of a private server between their group, now only one of them gets the benefits and the others can only join it when the main is online..
---
Yeah 8 friends can pitch in on one server. $1.63 each for unlimited junk storage, a secondary free fast travel point, I like it. I'm going to get one. I don't have friends but hey, maybe I can bribe people to be my friend lol.
---
Lowlifescarab86
---
OsciferJohnson
---
Except that that is not all of it. Unlimited scrap and a second fast travel point work in Public.
---
It's $8.33 USD if you buy yearly.
---
Plus I can finally carry around 300+ teddy bears.
---
and get this, the NRC Ranger armor is exclusive to the subscription
---
what the absolute fuck bethesda
---
Yes only one person needs to pay for it
---
https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/fallout1st
---
I have several good ones, on my hunter character. Sadly, they are only good for stealth headshots. I love the weapon, and I expect it to improve when wastelanders arrive, with bien and arrow.
---
Thats a fucking joke!
---
I've got less than 50 hours in the game with probably half of it being afk waiting for events to pop. You seem to think people put a ton of hours into this game, but lots of us have been waiting for the game to get better.
---
Instead I'll just get outerworlds tomorrow, an actually well made game that isn't full of microtransactions. LOL
---
People: “Give us more stash space”
---
Bethesda: “Here’s unlimited space for your scrap!...
---
Only $12 a month!”
---
UK being ripped of also £12 a month so over $15. Pisstake
---
Wtf this is why I stopped playing this game went to shit with this pay to win crap and now they want people to pay basically £12 a month for some scrap and atom that’s bullshit! I’m done I wanna get a refund on my game but it’s already been a year and I don’t think anyone will buy that piece of crap game. I am at the point I wanna take a fucking hammer to it.
---
I didn’t even read the full patch notes after seeing that tbh. I can’t believe it lol. It’s surviving because of community. What exec thought this shit was a good idea? It’ll just push the people that want to support the game away.
---
OgN GuNxHaVoK
---
I was wracking my brain trying to remember why I thought 10/23 was a special day. :D
---
Think we are best unloading as much 5.56 as possible and keeping hold of our valuable guns
---
Yeah, I've held out hope for a decent amount of time and have been let down almost every time. Wastelanders is what I'm hoping will fix the game, but honestly have no idea if it will.
---
Wow, I guess I'm never going to to be able to use my spin up weapons correctly again... A sad amount of fix's for the time it took to get this patch to us.  
---
Fallout 1st is neat but 7 players is weak. We normally have more people than that on at a time. Not overly fond of paying more when it took 50 something days to get this patch to us and there is more fix's for NW shit then adventure. I do not play fallout for BR.
---
Thanks. Well, that's fucking awful.
---
&gt;more unsung in reported damage to the lives of their so called enemies : get over it : it’s a symbol
---
That doesn't make a lick of sense. Even if granting the first part, that in no way makes displaying Nazi symbols and solidarity with white supremacists any less vile and pathetic.
---
Big mood
---
If your interested om the costume/emote just snag a month then cancel, you still gonna get some atoms and more imprtantly your supporting the game for future development and additions. Also if you raid, it might be very handy for your team a exclusive server lag wise. Cheers.
---
(1) Pay $12 every month to get some private space &amp; unlimited stash, etc. and go to hunt legendary SB praying for the release of Wastelanders in Q1 every day, or (2) pay some more to get a gem like Outer Worlds. Ummmm how difficult choice.
---
&gt;Enemies: Ash and Goo Pile corpses now correctly despawn, allowing those enemies to respawn normally.
---
Somewhere there's a very happy Australian weapons spotlight Youtuber right now.
---
Looks like they hooked a whale
---
I thought it was gonna be a 1 time pay (sorta like Fallout 4's Season Pass)
---
So does the scrap box and it’s unlimited storage move over to adventure? Or is it unique to private world?
---
 [https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/article/3r1YDnDtyO1CtNFbJX6RBJ/fallout-76-fallout-1st-launch](https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/article/3r1YDnDtyO1CtNFbJX6RBJ/fallout-76-fallout-1st-launch)
---
You don’t need to pay money for more events...
---
1000 Atoms = $13CAD, 1 month of 1st is $18CAD. 
---
Paying for a month to get 1650 atoms + armor seems like it could be worth it. Though, I can't see me keeping it for any longer than that
---
Well, you are wrong, the private servers even give you other advantages like unlimited crafting parts storage, extra fast travel point, etc.
---
im in the same boat, id buy the survival tent, but not for a monthly fee
---
yup the crane game!
---
I think this is just a vehicle for Bethesda to make atom purchases more regular and reliable as an income source. The benefits given for the subscription aren't that spectacular now that we know private servers are the same play experience as adventure mode. You do however get an atom amount that's almost equal to the value of the subscription (at least for the Canadian pricing).
---
Hahaha holy fuck, I had to make sure it wasn’t April 1st when I saw the subscription. This game has honestly gone to shit and I’m glad that I don’t have to play it anymore.
---
LuneLightKnight
---
Well I think so. Way too expensive
---
[ncr ranger outfit ](https://images.ctfassets.net/rporu91m20dc/53PwR4dcu7FrRgA1fvyw5Z/b6be94e80461239b5b344402fae1479a/Ranger_Armor.jpg)
---
i just wonder if it'll be like eso craftbag.  once ur subscription runs out, you could take things out of the bag but couldn't put back in.  will 76 do this also, or dump all that crap in ur character's pockets and drop u off at a train station lol
---
Problem solved don't buy one
---
Unlimited scrap should be a basic right in a game like this. How about giving it out to free for the day 1 players who have stood by this game and paid top whack for it originally
---
K
---
Wastelanders died for private servers/s
---
Haikus in fo76! i love it!
---
this would be cool but sadly not just even more of a cash grab for them
---
Travis party181
---
Are you really surprised after everything else they have pulled with this game?
---
Lmao what
---
Eh, im not worried, i can pick up way more junk in the time those workshops can produce lol, and sell it just as quick. Ive played with the numbers and totally not worth it. If you want to wait all day go for it, defend and replace everytime. The time it takes to defend i can have a area cleared out. Ill be already around the map and gone by the time your 10 acid at each site is produced or your lead scraps 😅😁
---
The whole "we paid $60 for the game" bullshit is getting old. How the fuck do you expect them to continue funding the game and keeping the servers up?
---
Cool, I really want to celebrate Halloween 4 days after it's over....
---
Is it so hard to have Halloween events the weekend before Halloween? Not 2 days prior
---
Have you tried killing a supermutant with a hit to the chest? You'll cause 40 points of damage. I have five dif. Ones, even the instigating variety. They are fun, but you need to carry a 'real' weapon also, most of the time.
---
UK is £99.99 a year 
---
£11.99 a month so over $15 a month.
---
Being ripped off here

---
Repeat that, please.
---
That’s not paid to win but ok.
---
CANNOT WAIT! Forget the moaning on here, there’ll be PLENTY of players doing this, I can guarantee that!
---
I dunno if I’d say it’s gonna make things BETTER, but I don’t think it’s gonna make things Worse like some people are acting.
---
Yes it seems auspicious - however cruel reality is preparing me for disappointment at the impending missed opportunities.
---
Wtf man Bethesda must hate you aussies
---
Id be fine if it was private only but it's public as well
---
NCR armour locked behind a sub is going to send the fanbase wild. Bethesda just can't help themselves.
---
i used mine as a nukashine funnel
---
getting downvoted by all the chumps who think private servers should somehow be free
---
I would pay maybe $8 a month ($5 US) for it. I don't care about private servers at all, but I would pay for the scrap box convenience (seriously). But this is way too much, and the private servers have standard, unchangeable rulesets. It's just playing with people you know, that's it.
---
You kids need to learn what pay to win is. I get it though, you have to bitch about something so enjoy that!
---
But it's not just private servers. There are things that make the game easier in Public.
---
I understand that but don’t you think the prices are insane??? And I didn’t want to cancel because I wanted my own server with my friends, but because of this bs I’m no longer doing that.
---
&gt; Scrapbox
---
* Hoard crafting components to your heart’s content with your own personal Scrapbox container.
---
* The Scrapbox is a separate container from your Stash and offers unlimited storage space for all your components.
---
* The Scrapbox is exclusive to Fallout 1st members and can be used in both public and private worlds.
---
Yeah f@ck that, number 1 requested feature and u lock it behind paywall, WTF is wrong with you...
---
Thanks. That's really weak. Bethesda are going to get hammered for this.
---
Keep reading,,,
---
Yep.
---
So get this. Little Bobby and Little Timmy go and buy fallout 76 Tonight right? Never played before, new start new save. Bobby is loaded, money isn't a problem and decides to buy the unlimited junk storage, thus never having to worry about throwing away junk and stockpiles a seemingly infinite storage of junk. Little Timmy on the other hand doesn't want to spend the extra money. And thus has a cap on there junk. Pretty simple stuff right? Now the P2W part. Whenever a new content drop happens now, who's gunna have more junk to build all the cool new toys with, Bobby, who has Infinite? Or Timmy who has Finite? Hope this explains it for you :)
---
Are you able to play on other peoples private servers without paying for my own? Or is the membership required to join that game mode?
---
Bai
---
That's what they said on the post.
---
" In the event your Fallout 1st membership expires, you’ll still be able to access any Atoms received and resources stored in your Scrapbox; you just won’t be able to deposit new additional crafting components."  
---
It would appear that what you could do would be to subscribe for a month and just farm resources like crazy - gobble up everything you can and toss it into the Scrapbox.  Then, let the subscription lapse and still have access to your hoard.
---
&gt; Combat Rifles: Applying a Prime Receiver mod to a Combat Rifle now correctly causes it to use Ultracite .45 rounds instead of Ultracite .44 rounds.
---
[NOOOOOOOOO!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DgZIYdFmZqc)
---
I play the game primarily singleplayer and therefore have no interest in private servers. That's basically it - some atoms, private servers, and scrap storage.
---
It blows balls and i'm really sorry. They just can't stop fucking up. I really want to support this i really do but this is PAY TO WIN and it's most definitely not inexpensive. I would only be okay with pay to win if it was affordable and affordable to everyone not just the US. Which it's not by the way. 12 dollars is stupid expensive for one game that's not even polished
---
Brother
---
It’s not pay to win moron.
---
Welp, we P2W now. Was fun knowing you guys.
---
Yeah, that's some bullshit
---
But you can only use the private server if the person with the fallout 1st subscription, as soon as they log out the server kicks everyone else unless another has the subscription also.
---
So you can't even pool it together with others for a private server.
---
" Unlimited storage for crafting components in your own new Scrapbox container ", I guess we all know why we have limited stash space now... Database limitations, my \*ss...
---
Had game since B.E.T.A. but only level 48, I play it on and off like I do most online games. Last week was my first Mothman since then and it was hostile from get go. Near one of the Nuke Silos.
---
If you’re only lvl 30, how do you know it’s not enjoyable to be lvl 300 and geared to the gills?  
---
My buddy seemed to appreciate my cameo appearance when some jackass was giving her trouble last weekend. The dude was literally begging to fight her lvl 120 slugger in excavator armor, but didn’t seem so happy when I showed up to party instead. I was happy to be able to continually smoke that dude to the point where he accused me of somehow using cheats that will be reported to his friends that work at Bethesda. My friend laughing at him the whole time was probably a mean spirited, as was the issue of Live and Love I put in his sack of junk.
---
The grind to get a B/50 Fixer was so worth it when it can create those kinds of precious moments.
---
At least you can sub one month and keep it. 😁
---
Yes but you can cancel it after you get the outfit. The outfit stays yours when you cancel the subscription.
---
Why do they have to lock it behind paywall?! This is bullcrap.
---
Splish splash bethesda is trash
---
And as soon as they log out the server closes, unless another with subscription is on the server. So that really doesn't help.
---
Yes, pay 2 win is the technical term for that.
---
Yeah idc about downvotes. Lol in any other MMO “official” private servers usually need to be paid for.
---
&gt;**Weight Reductions:** The following items have had their weights reduced to help them consume less C.A.M.P. budget when placed in Display Cases:  
---
&gt;**Bobbleheads:** Weight reduced from 1 lb to 0.01 lb.  
---
&gt;**Magazines:** Weight reduced from 0.5 lb to 0.01 lb.  
---
&gt;**Teddy Bears:** Weight reduced from 0.75 lb or 1 lb (depending on the bear) to 0.5 lb.
---
This is bit confusing... So did just the weight reduce? Or camp budget amount also for these items? Or both?
---
Is camp budget amount of one item depend on it's weight? So say a fatman takes more than a 10mm pistol?
---
&gt; Become a Fallout 1st Member Today! The Scrapbox is a separate container from your Stash and offers unlimited storage space for all your components. The Scrapbox is exclusive to Fallout 1st members
---
What is this bullshit? Seriously. This is fucking outrageous. 
---
I'll just leave this funny quote here for you:
---
"And to say, the Atomic shop is cosmetic stuff. To make sure folks understand--look there's a line. There are people who have crossed it, but we're going to stay on the right side of it in terms of the things you can spend money on and how this stuff works." ~ Pete Hines, 2018 (hilarious, I know)
---
Wo thank you for the info but I can't respond to your problem
---
wow. Is the game free now? I love fallout 76, but this price messed with my guts.
---
I sure hope the redditor that suggested the T.E.N.T secondary camp content months ago gets his recognition due for this now monetized feature
---
Your prices suck, I see $12.99 and $99 for a year
---
They will have a field day with it and I say good for them Bethesda deserves every bit of hate they get
---
Gonna get downvoted for this but seems like a good subscription. More atoms than you pay for? ESO doesn't have that
---
I’d be more inclined to the idea of the prices were set the same all over. Someone care to explain why UK has to pay more than USA?? Blatant thievery
---
Don’t buy it and be at a disadvantage!
---
All I want is the ability to host my own server, for my group of friends, on my own hardware, and not have to pay extra for it. Kind of like Minecraft.
---
Fallout 1st, brah
---
We are gonna know for sure once one of the cm responds
---

---
To be fair.... and only on this one specific point... Elder Scrolls Online is a paid game and has subscriptions with added value, and you don't hear as many people bitching about that.
---
Except you’re not winning anything for having unlimited junk space but I get it, you’re a gamer, you must be a cry baby about everything.
---
Terrible move
---
drink your monster boomer
---
Only 7 people on a private world?
---
Hopefully thats gonna increase right? We need like 2x that to really convince people to come back
---
Fallout 76 optimization died for private servers.
---
But seriously tho I hope the extra money Bethesda makes it'll go toward better public servers and overall the games performance.
---
Locking content behind a subscription service. Really Bethesda? Really? Are you all fucking stupid? People have been complaining that the game is struggling with content and ya'll have the gall to lock anything behind a paywall.
---
Absolutely, people just do not grasp how companies need to make money, and by giving us a great deal like this, I don’t mind at all helping. I bought atoms regularly anyway so it’s almost free for all the extras you get.
---
I wouldnt call myself excited- I don’t actually want any of this stuff except the survival tent and the ranger armor- but I don’t really think it’s as bad as people are making it out to be. It kinda sucks that there’s exclusive stuff, but you don’t need any of it to enjoy the game or do well in it.
---
The only thing i actively dislike is the price. It’s expensive. I might buy a month just to try it out and get the Ranger armor and then just not renew it.
---
7 people is a bit of a let down. Can’t Role play with 7 people.
---
Part of the subscription service is the luxury of being able to buy exclusive things from their microtransaction store. You're paying them money to be able to buy things from them.
---
They also just said this game wouldn’t be P2W like 2 weeks ago lmao. Idk how I missed it in their post, thanks for enlightening me.
---
Same. Let me be clear, an armor and atoms for that price is alright. That said, I think I wont touch it beyond that
---
I report any nonsense I see. Posted a while ago about someone's having "White Power" spelled out in lights. 
---
Bethesda reached out to me specifically asking for a username, and ticket number so they could look into it! 
---
I just want to point out here, too, just because you think someone is *overly-sensitive* doesn't give you the right to make insensitive and/or racist comments under the "everyone is so sensitive" agenda. That just means you're an asshole
---
Remember outer worlds comes out tonight at midnight. ;)
---
Yeah. Group size is no good...
---
They need more pistol options. Bring back the deliverer
---
I see I’m wrong this is a terrible announcement in my eyes
---
So they're not even private servers? You can't buy one between your group, you have to leave one person essentially hosting like we're playing Minecraft on the 360?
---
Pretty sure it said forever on the emotes, icons and NCR armor.
---
I'm Australian on the Australian servers. Sadly, he has fans here too.
---
its ok todd, we know its you shadow posting
---
I want all of my fallout 1st dollars to go toward fixing jet packs.
---
Yup. They have stumbled from one shitshow to the next. I really wish 76 wasn't given to the B team.
---
I feel exactly the same way
---
Now it's boomers because of the bombs.
---
I see your point dude, I bought atoms regularly so with all of the extras you get it’s a win-win for me
---
So you consistently purchase atoms, but now that you technically get them at a better price (12.99 for 1650) on top of personal server access and other bonuses, you don't want it? People like you that say "i consistently made these stupid ass purchases" are why they release more purchases.
---
I don’t think you can refund subscriptions on Xbox unfortunately
---
Generally I am anti salt,  but this is kinda lame. 7 people
---
Bethesda has lots of money. They just are using it in the wrong places, and I was trying to say that we paid 60$ for a game that was half broken. The atomic shop has made loads of money even with ridiculous prices, all of that shit starts to add up to a lot of money out of our pockets. Also why so toxic? Lol
---
&gt; Fallout 1st is a premium membership aimed at enhancing the Fallout 76 experience, offering members access to Private Worlds, unlimited crafting component storage with the Scrapbox, a second Fast Travel point with the Survival Tent, exclusive cosmetic items, and best value 1,650 Atoms each month.
---
* Releases Game as a Broken mess.
---
* Takes months to properly patch it.
---
"Hey let\`s announce a premiummembership now, what could go wrong?"
---
Which is good... the devs don't work for free, the landlords don't let them use offices for free and amazon wont let them have server space for free. So yeah, them making money is good. It means we have a game tomorrow too.
---
They nuked us again with a P2W bombshell
---
I'm happy I refunded my pre-order after the beta and got a heavily discounted copy a week later for 20 bucks. Dodged a bullet there.
---
This game has been shit from the get go. Just a bunch of fanboys who can't admit it yell down anyone who dares call out the bullshit.
---
Not gonna lie, this seems super bad at first glance. You guys keep saying the player base asked for this but I’ve NEVER seen a shred of evidence suggesting that at all. It seems like you’re using us as an excuse to add more shit that we should’ve had since day one. 
---
Booooooooooooo
---
I'm with you too. I don't think $12 a month is so bad, especially when other games like WoW for example are charging $15 a  month as a base.
---
I'm willing to give It a chance, at least for a month and it's not like you're locked into it for a year, etc.
---
I really want ranger armour but it’s fucking 12$ a month. If I buy it once do you think I can keep the armour
---
They're not even private servers. It's a private session. Once the owner leaves, it shuts down unless someone else has a subscription.
---
That's no kind of server and defeats half the point.
---
Yeah I do get that. It’s the same with other games though, and I think (at least for U.K.) Its a minimal extra
---
its actually pretty solid pricing its 12$ for 16$ worth of free atoms and other services 
---
it also means if people buy into this they would be able to hand out more free stuff for people without money to use since they would have a constant source of cash
---
So? Other people having larger junk than you doesn't effect your gameplay at all
---
That's a hell of a buglist to add to the other long one. I wonder for how long and how many people are going to pay a monthly 1st subscription for them to not be fixed?
---
Its offline for the patch
---
I believe we have to pay over $35 dollars a year more than you for this if we paid annual subscriptions it’s just thievery and definitely P2W.
---
Locking armour behind a paywall. Allowing people to craft unlimited amounts and fuck the in game economy. Massive mistake.
---
I’ve been playing since day 1 of beta and stood by this game and this is what they do
---
? Is this new?
---
You keep it forever, it says in the article that you have access to any outfits/emotes you got through the subscription even when said subscription ends
---
Some people are having trouble with stash space, and throwing out crafting materials isn't the best choice
---
You are correct, they dont work for free. So how about they make something worth paying for.
---
So if I buy this I win the game? Finally, I've been trying to win for a while now.
---
Yes that I am having a major WTF moment over. I'm actually pretty thrilled with the offering but the player limit is a bit of a surprise.
---
Just came out in the new update
---
its the next evolution in tethering haha
---
It's the biggest mind boggle of the whole thing for me. Who will pay for a private session that doesn't even persist?
---
Hopefully it gets boosted to more then 7
---
ESO had content. ESO wasn't crippled with bugs. ESO had server stability. I paid for ESO plus, but I wouldn't dream of paying for Fallout 1st considering the state of 76.
---
It's that simple
---
8 players max aswell. it's stupid.
---
I don't necessarily think the whole subscription thing is bad persay. It's just all the other stuff we have been asking for is behind this pay wall.
---
&gt;i giggled at that
---
they are basically charging for stuff that should be ingame for every player, not premium pass bullshit.
---
this is not ok, this is not even close to being ok
---
I remember when they refused to increase stash sizes because they said the server could not handle it but now they offer unlimited if you pay them, yes...
---
I've got a friend with a TSE account. Get gets TSE everything, all the time, which was great for him back before it was nerfed; I've always believed something like this was in effect. My main take away from the post is that some unyielding cav scout armour I got might be worth good trade - good to know.
---
Love u
---
Yeah I can see that as being a little annoying. I dunno, I'm going to try to form a small group/guild and schedule weekly activities. Seems really fun to me.
---
They said it should happen twice as often in new update
---
Yep, no ones forcing people for the 12month tie-in, monthly is perfect for me, what do people expect for a little over $10 nowadays, that’s like a cinema trip which is over in 2hours lol
---
There’s the other thing, people can straight up just ignore that whole thing and the only real thing that’ll affect people is the less atoms. Otherwise there’s no true advantage.
---
all this community does is bitch, bitch, and bitch some more.
---
Can you tell me where exactly it said forever? I've read the article in different language than english and couldn't find anything about "forever"
---
My camp is pretty much maxed out and I'm loaded with bulk junk. Since the camp's are tied to level I don't see how it matters. The lower level players even have craft restrictions so if you had two new players and one was paying the fee I don't see much of an advantage. 
---
Really the biggest advantage to me is the private server to create ammo at the workstation. Lower level players are pushed out of the way in adventure mode.
---
Let's add a subscription service while the core game has almost nothing to do that is actually fun. Next level development right there boys
---
It also doesn't support servers though :p
---
Its not about that, its about the person with the infinite storage has the ability to just snap build every new item/weapon, not to mention ammo, in each update, while the person without can't build everything. In a game where building up a cool base and fighting bosses or mobbing is end game, it is most definitely pay to win.
---
Those players need to figure it out.
---
Is greed.
---
Yup, this game is going to die for sure when it comes out. Just going to end up just like anthem. LOL
---
$5.00 a month maybe but this is bull.
---
Thanks for all the advice. The problem was actually with Bethesda, who got onto my problem and fixed it straight away. I thank them very much.
---
So is the unlimited scrap box.
---
Same here.
---
But what exactly are you winning?  Bragging rights? Get over it.
---
ESO sucked at release, it wasn't until over eight months they began to improve it. They had to remove the original mandatory subscription for some reason
---
My guess is they will add a new unique outfit for the subscription each moth, to keep people "interested".
---
Oh I see now, thanks a lot &lt;3
---
I have a feeling this is just the beginning and even possibly the first sign of splitting player base, I can even see this subscription becoming a battle pass system in the near future.
---
Me throwing away 6k steel doesn't mean you beat me at the game.
---
Where did you find pricing?
---
I wouldn’t say PTW but pay for convenience.
---
$8 dollars a month?? Is that the annual price being broken down??
---
Try being in UK they are robbing us we have to pay over the year $35 more than USA
---
Yeah, it's pretty clear now that storing scrap of any amount has no impact on performance.  Since scrap is just a "single" item with a numerical counter to indicate how many you have attached to it, and it wouldn't make a difference whether you're storing 1 of each or 10,000, this decision has nothing to do with technical limitations.
---
They aren't even persistent? Christ...
---
You'd pay for this?
---
Lmao I hope many people buy a subscription and I hope they keep the features as is. It's a scam and a scumbag move, but if it helps keep the game on life support, I don't care.
---
How much content would you say is in classic WoW vs Fallout 76? How many hours? I put two full years into WoW before Burning Crusade. I've put maybe five months total into Fallout 76.
---
partially. The servers were definitely less stable but it does go to show that the amount of items in a server does affect the server
---
Don't forget you can then sell those cores to the lesser folks on public servers, as well as ammo and what use to be considered rare outfits. Once the flood gates are opened the value of a lot of stuff will drop.  10K for longshoreman, not anymore when half a dozen player vending machines have it listed for 2K or less.
---
I just think it’s a clear money grab
---
100 for a year? Are u insane?
---
Was there a previous multiplayer Fallout game or are you referring to the FO2 mod
---
the infinite storage space is extremely spectacular, especially for solo players
---
You're being downvoted but you're right.  Pay for one month, get the outfit, emotes, etc.  And take your monthly atoms which amount to more than what you would get if you bought them straight up.  It's not that outrageous.
---
Because bethesda keeps pulling dumb shit like this.
---
Honestly, once the game gets alittle better the membership is going to be worth it. But there's some time between now and wastelanders, at the very least. But the membership seemed to work out for ESO, in the long run. And I'm hoping this game does the same turn around. Honestly, this was a hefty amount of patch notes to read through, so I'm glad such a big update came out now.
---
This definitely does sound a LOT like paying to win. This is starting to sound like a two-class system of player
---
The servers are not free for them either. Also you can still play, just not on private world.
---
It does feel pretty unfair, having 2 accounts. I have 8,000 lbs of stash space(way more if i over enuomber) compared to someone else who has 800, i totally paid for a *HUGE* advantage.
---
I have no mouth and I must scream
---
Can you pay month to month? Or do you have to get a whole year
---
I'm totally fine with the price and everything in the private world.
---
However, I'm NOT cool with allowing scrapboxes into public worlds. Not only do I think it is very close to pay to win/convenience whatever. Unlimited items will have an impact on servers and make my game worse.
---
Do characters transfer back to adventure mode?
---
Yes, would like an explanation from one of the devs on this, it’s a big difference over the year for sure!
---
You'd buy premium?
---
Yeah, if you're on a console it's worse because it's a subscription on top of the subscription you likely already pay for PS4/Xbox additional online content.
---
Yes it is the annual price broken down. It's $8.33 a month
---
Yeah I think it’s mainly just due to the initial out rage with this
---
Wait what's happening??
---
It's a great deal for US pc players, for everyone else, sorry.
---
Yup...
---
It is still the Nuclear Winter DLC season, so this is expected for now. If the NW focus continues after we move on from the NW season, well... then we have a problem.
---
How am I beating you at the game when you throw out steel?
---
It says 13$ for me
---
Yeah i see no prices.
---
I disagree, freedom of speech is common in developed nations. The problem here isn't that it doesn't apply to Bethesda, an American company. The problem is that freedom of speech doesn't mean you are protected from private actors and companies banning or shunning you. It just applies to government actions, and even then it doesn't mean your words and behaviors which are disruptive can't be punished based on context, but rather censored based on what they are, unless it involves incitement of violence.
---
And if you've been waiting for the game to get better due to the sheer bugginess and was hoping they'd actually fix the bugs instead of trying to monetize it more and more?
---
What about us?
---
Most of the features of the subscription are just copy pasted from ESO.  
---
The price is also quite cheap compared to other MMOs.
---
While there are exceptions... game technology is at a point where they have to put in extra work to allow players to run the server themselves.
---
Easier for them to host their own service that spins up copies of a world on demand. 
---
Not saying it isn’t still possible... but current game infrastructure and support is working away from that.
---
Remember that Obsidian is not what it used to be. Outer Worlds is overhyped and likely will not live up to the hype. It's likely people will bash it again. It's incredibly annoying how people *still* think Outer Worlds will be the best shit ever.
---
$16.50 of fake money. Lmao.
---
You paid $60, played the game for 200 hours, and have the balls to want a refund?  What an entitled puss bag you are.
---
The ps store.
---
Annual is 99.99  
---
Monthly 12.99
---
$18 is the monthly price. It's $130 for the year.
---
I'd be upset if it wasn't for the Atoms included with Fallout 1st, but yeah.. games take money to make and run - if you don't give people a decent option to spend money, they won't, and then the game gets less content and eventually shuts down. I'm good with it. Nice looking patch!
---
My favourite wheel is full. Where would the survival tent even go?
---
Being able to access to your stash from every workbench in the world, having stuff in your stash is basically the same as having it all on you.
---
And even better, if we consider that you drop junk on death.
---
Nothing that costs money in this game is actually needed to play the game. This game is a mmo esque game and needs revenue to survive. Just like netflix, hulu, warcraft, xboxlive, psn, eso(+), CS servers, ETC   
---
Everything is moving towards this new subscription model because it works. You can pay for it or not, your choice.
---
Massively stabbed in back. There not even private servers. If you have your team in a private server and the person with the membership leaves then you all get booted unless someone else has the membership. 
---
So it’s not buying private server access for your team unless you can all be on at the same time it doesn’t work
---
Don't ya hate how whenever there is Bethesda drama everyone is suddenly an expert? Must be f--kin nice. We oughta leave this world behind.
---
I mean more generally in the things you can build.
---
Do you realize that maintaining online servers costs Bethesda hundreds of thousands to millions of dollars a year? It's not free to run games and store everyone's character data.
---
Its the same premium cost than ESO giving the same things like unlimited stash, 1650 ATOMs is the same amount as the ESO+. Basicly they took the ESO+ copied it, changed a few things and slapped it on FO76.
---
Lazy, and pointless, since FO76 does not have the content nor the endgame etc to warrant a subscription service like this. Unless they add more regions (keep increasing the map size), and actually add content like ESO has been. Then its just a giant rip off.
---
ESO+ gives you bang for your buck, not Fallout 1st.
---
Exactly. Having more space isnt pay to win. You are literally not winning anything.
---
Also its a singleplayer rpg which FO76 isn't. 
---
Might as well say there's a pokemon game coming out.
---
be sure to turn off auto-renew in ur console settings once u've had ur fill tho
---
Compared to this game? sonic heroes is a good game. LOL
---
I actually kind of dig this Fallout 1st business... For $13 a month, you get all the goodies they mentioned plus roughly $16 worth of Atoms each month... I get the hate, but... I'm on board. I have plenty of Karma, so downvote away!
---
Don't do it, it look worse than in new vegas
---
Yea that's annual broken down.
---
You're getting Atoms for 50% off then a bunch of other shit
---
Mostly the mod. Though I suppose I probably should have worded it a bit differently, since that was kinda....Eh.
---
Who said I didn't like it? It's just never been worth 60 bucks. 20? Sure.
---
So what happens to your scrapbox and everything you have stored in it when your subscription runs out?
---
They are selling well enough that they just hired about 20+ more people to the Fallout 76 studio, so I guess they are already doing that.
---
I can build Ultracite Jetpacks. If you have the materials and a little something for your friendly neighbourhood craftsman lets talk
---
Well we’re being bent over and shafted by these fuckers over here
---
I’m so angry I can’t believe Bethesda would do this  *pulls out wallet* where do I sign up?
---
Your down votes can not stop liberty prime. He shall not fall to communism. [Btw just incase some of you dont know this is cannon from the fallout games]
---
For fucking real. That's the biggest issue here, I think. 
---
Paid private servers is one thing, I'm not even that upset about it since many games do this. 
---
BUT, now they're locking highly requested features behind a paywall, and moreover PROVING that an UNLIMITED SCRAPBOX IS POSSIBLE IN A PUBLIC WORLD. So why didn't we have one to begin with? The answer, of course, is $$$. 
---
Honestly, I'm just perplexed. Who is this for? The most diehard fans of this game are presumably on this subreddit, and the mood on here was already gloomy because of the delay of Wastelanders. So what do we get instead? Surprise! You get to pay us more money. Go fuck yourselves, Beth.
---
All I wanted was them to fix the little amount of storage space. I don’t care for anything else this membership provides. Now they won’t ever address this issue for people who don’t pay monthly.
---
Well this is dissapointing.  
---
I run with a streamer frequently who is one of the few who has bothered to stick with the game on twitch and we've been waiting for private servers for a while now because he's been looking for new ways to engage with his community and new things do in the game since doing the same thing is over and over is not the most enjoyable to those who watch.  
---
When he's got 4000 members on his discord with only 7 slots you can't do a community server without someone getting upset and the fact it isn't perpetually up unless he or someone else with a subscription idles in it is disappointing.  
---
Also locking that scrapbox behind a paywall is a dick move.
---
Just so I understand: $13/month gets you 1650 atom/month. Normally atoms are $1 for 100 atoms. So they are basically giving 350 atoms for free, plus everything else you get with the sub.
---
Happy nuke day! Just texted my best friend telling him to make it to a vault
---
If 8 people all paid (around £12 each) for a years worth of a server, would everyone get the benefits of Atoms, NCR armour and whatever else, or just the name on the server? Like if people set up a PayPal for it? 
---
I have no experience with private servers since I normally play single player, so I'm trying to wrap my head around the ridiculously overpriced nature of these servers.
---
Sorry if it's a dumb question, I just can't fathom what they were thinking. 😐
---
I see your point. Guess I'm in the wrong here
---
Correct me if I'm wrong but WoW is free correct? Also as far as I know WoW is not a broken buggy mess and has probably 100x the content then fallout 76 ever will
---
And tore up my homework!
---
uhm you get 1650 atoms thats already worth the money plus all the other stuff you can farm an alt in no time to 50 now you can solo nuke ws  its not really that bad
---
*12.99 
---
so... $13...
---
I can't believe how well simple psychology works in mass
---
Didn’t even think of that. Hell of an idea, bud!!
---
Okay so the early levels in this game are rather punishing, or at least they were on both my characters and I am no stranger to difficulty. The game likes to hand hold on some aspects but then leave you completely blind on others. One aspect is that there are different [leveled zones on the map](https://www.falloutbuilds.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/41/2018/11/60ca88de-790x812.png) where max level enemies are either capped or uncapped. I would suggest staying in the forest region and completing the Responders questline to help level up, this can be started in Flatwoods if you went the "wrong way" leaving the vault. Questlines in general are usually given by  little markers saying "check out the abandoned mine shaft" and will then trigger once you do said task.   
---
General Tips:  
---
\- Plan your build out with [Nukes and Dragons](https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks) site asap, while it will probably be a little botched by the end it won't be completely awful to fix with the terribly slow respec system (hints: focus on one weapon type and make your build around damage then convenience)  
---
\- When you level up you choose a special point to add (stops at level 50) and a perk card, you **DO NOT HAVE TO PICK FROM THE SAME TREE** (you can level up strength by 1 and then pick an agility perk card for example)   
---
\- Don't buy ammo or health items from vending machines and robots at train stations and towns, they are crazy overpriced.   
---
\- Routinely scrap junk at a workbench and store it in your stash. Dying in this game means you drop carried junk and scrap in a bag on the ground which others can take (though people tend not to for the most part)   
---
\- Stash is **YOUR STASH**. If you find a container that says stash it leads to your stored inventory not someone elses even if it is in someone else's camp. (**EXCEPT OVERSEER'S STASH** that is a public container and does not go to your stash)  
---
\- You can sell stuff to vendors to a max of 1400 caps per day, this resets every \~20 hours. All vendors draw from the same pool of caps. Selling stuff to the vendor adds back 1/4 of the caps you paid for an item, this is nice when you have more than 1400 caps worth to sell.  
---
\- Have a decent melee weapon on you at all times, shit happens and you will need it. (even if you are a stealth sniper)  
---
\- Plans and recipes you find in the world and in vendors will be picked up into the "Notes" section of your inventory, you have to click on them to learn how to make said item and then they will be consumed (known plans will be labeled as such and cant be learned)   
---
\- IF you see a large glowing green fissure or hole in the ground, **TURN AROUND AND RUN** =)   
---
\- Treat everything that can do poison damage like a Cazadore  
---
\- Events are marked on the map with a yellow hexagon icon on the map, if they are larger and have a " **!** "  then they are free to fast travel Public Events   
---
\- Events like Free Range, Arktos Pharma, Scorched Earth, and Encryptid will say "hard" on them. Trust me you will probably not have a fun time showing up to these events when you are underleveled (suggested 50+)  
---
\- Turning on Pacifist at level 5 in your settings will make it so if you accidentally hit someone you won't do any damage and engage in unwanted PvP around the map  
---
\- Workshops are PvP areas. Claiming one or contesting one will open you up to PvP even if you have pacifist mode on. The game will say they are a good source of resources but they are pretty bad and you can find better elsewhere.   
---
There is a lot more but I think this is a good start to not having a bad time.
---
Welp free storage space for Fallout 1st Owners. And here we go........
---
That's your only response?
---
Is 1650 atoms per month really pay to win? Being able to have a stash with some extra space to put fucking crafting components in? That's pay to win?
---
This too. If someone leaves the server should be left open. If the server's empty it should stay open for 5 minutes and then close. But will always reopen if someone whitelisted joins the server
---
Stick to gwent
---
I wouldn't pay anything, they said all DLC would be free and I paid 60 dollars for this game.
---
&gt;read our recent article on Fallout.com
---
lol they said "sometimes"?! Try all the time, even when I didn't see the Sentry Bot fire off any rounds
---
plus i’m already paying xbox $60 a year just to play online.
---
If you haven't gotten your £50 out of it yet, that's on you...
---
I only paid $15 for the game, if it was a $50/year I might be on board. But $13/ month is too much.  I kind of feel mislead, with them saying stash box limitations were for the server stability, but now you can have unlimited if you pay. This is going to turn in to the largest "outer world's" promotion ever.  I'll keep playing as long as I keep enjoying it, but I have a feeling all of the new content will only go to the subscribers.
---
That's great I will be getting outer worlds as well, as iv been looking for a single player experience made by the good people at obsidion!
---
Yeah it sure does seem that way. I mean they always charge us more than just the exchange rate equivalent but a greater than 20% markup is a bit of a gouge.
---
lolololol ty Bethesda...i was needing that humor in my life today.
---
thanks cant wait to rip that stuff and port it to fallout 4
---
It's not bullshit, people paid triple-A price and got a janky game that was universally criticized. 
---
Players expect Bethesda to fix their mistakes and make the product worth the original price before they go digging for more money. That's what Square Enix did with FF14, because they have integrity.
---
Also, you can stow your 'keep the servers up' nonsense. The costs involved with that are a joke and Bethesda should have had those costs covered with their pre-launch plan. If they're so stupid that they knowingly released a semi-broken game with no plan to support their own servers, then they deserve every bit of derision this community can throw at them.
---
It's not our job to financially make up for Bethesda's own shortcomings. It's their job to provide a product and service that's worth the asking price.
---
Didn't WoW come out like 20 years ago?
---
Uranus Fever?  Load Guzzling?
---
It's more about the fact that they're withholding content behind a paywall that has no reason not to be added to the base game.
---
I'm inclined to believe that it's server based as well with a possible skew towards lower leveled characters or some general stat. You'd have to try toons on different servers, possibly the same ones to rule that out as a variable. For example, on your toon that gets good pulls, do other players on that server get good pulls as well?
---
When dealing with RNG and programming, you also want to think of Occam's razor. For example, if you pull a number of similar items in a row, I'd be more willing to bet it's a caching glitch with their RNG than some type of complicated setup based off of perks and inventory. I honestly can't imagine that Bethesda of all companies would bother with something that gets that specific with character stats, unless they have some algorithm that classifies characters and they use that one number to adjust things, which would show up all over the game for various things. 
---
If we were talking about money related loot boxes, it would be another thing entirely. Gaming companies always game the system to encourage more spending. But this is RNG for an in-game item that does nothing to further their profit except maybe keep players playing longer, it seems pretty far fetched to think they would spend programming hours to skew those results. I think it's more likely that if they filter it based off of a simple thing like character level or something like that and just have terrible RNG that is weighted horribly towards bad pulls, with some people getting lucky or certain servers being weighted differently.
---
And how is it P2W
---
You should always get a full tank....
---
Like I have been saying since Skyrim, Bethesda is trash and their unwarranted succes flew to their heads, thinking they don't nees a QA department, bugtesting or have to cater to fans. You are all just whales.
---
They also give you 1500+ atoms/month... more than enough to buy whatever you want
---
The fact they're locking basic mechanics behind a paywall is the most absurd part, also the NCR Veteran Ranger armour being locked behind a paywall as well
---
Good job Bethesda, by including that armour you just fucked the entire timeline and lore of the Fallout series in pursuit of money, £80/$100 a year is a joke for unlimited scrap storage (should've been there anyway it's absurd that materials that are required 24/7 carry weight and you can't just have it in a box all the time), private worlds (should've been there at the start too, thanks Bethesda), a survival tent so you can have an outpost outside your base? fucking pisses me off since I was one of the ones who suggested an outpost idea
---
Some atoms and emotes/icons? must be worth $100 per year for Bethesda to fuck the lore so much as well though
---
Mass Effect Andromeda for one. That game was nowhere near ready for release. And Anthem. Oh Anthem. They burned so many players with that one.
---
You'll be downvoted to Oblivion, but you're not wrong. You can't deny the value. If you've already been paying for atoms, that alone is enough value. Unlimited scrap? Solo play when you want it? A new mobile camp? ...I'm pretty much on board with it. It sucks but this is what you get with "games as a service". People should have seen it coming.
---
Except they implied that 1st members get these bonuses, including the scrap stash box, even on normal adventure servers. So... what's up with that?
---
It’s not alright I’m against it, but there’s not really another option
---
They’re forcing you to 1) be online all the time so others can play in your server. Or 2) Have multiple people buy the sub JUST TO PLAY ON THE SERVER. I don’t care about any of the extra stuff offered. I pay a fee. I expect my server to be online when I leave. Should have to force others to sub just to play in it.
---
This post didn't age well.
---
Infinite junk was only on the Private World, or no?
---
Nice language.
---
Your not actually paying for a server though. If the person with the membership leaves then the server will boot everyone else forcing everyone who wants this to sign up unless you and your mates log in and out at same time to o pay get one membership
---
They want us to pay 100 bucks a year to be able to fulfill the objectives they lied about being able to fullfil.
---
Sorry, I was at work, what did I miss?
---
Don't forget they fucked the lore with the ranger armour
---
Is that $13 a month!? That’s an outrageous price.
---
You can kiss your chances of ever having another stash increase again goodbye!
---
It works on both
---
Juswrld24
---
 What the FUCK Bethesda? Why the hell would you add a subscription service that has other effects other then Private Servers?
---
Im down.
---
God, all you outraged tiny brained imbecils. That quote doesn't even apply here, lmao. Private servers cost MONEY to operate for Bethesda, a BUSINESS. of course it's a charge! They are even generously adding 1650 Atoms and Cosmetics and bonuses on top of it!
---
It’s for public to
---
No
---
I played ESO from release and 76 from Beta. The bugs cannot be compared in my experience.
---
Never ! Here's a membership and smile
---
Lmfao
---
Thanks, if you got any suggestions for the next build's theme, please go ahead \^\^
---
I honestly can't believe what I've just read!
---
I was ok with ESO+ until morrowwind. I spent hundreds on eso+ for the content The bonus stuff was just bonus. But then here came content that wasnt covered.
---
This isn’t the atomic shop... though I agree the scrap box thing is awful
---
Yeah come on guys they said no micro transactions would give competitive advantages. Guys, pals, comrades and amigos this is only 1650 its a full dlc price so of course they didnt lie or try to cheat the consumer by pulling this obvious bs.
---
 I mean like i was just getting back into the game and seeing this really motivates me to continue shiting on it.
---
You agree with urban dictionary? Cool I pulled this directly from UD:
---
Pay 2 win:
---
Good ways to milk players of the money they thought they wouldn't spend in the game include: **energy bars that reduce the time he can devote to his game, huge timers that need to be reduced for the player to be able to continue his journey**, better gear to deal with players that don't want to pay, and, the most common one, the existence of a currency in the game that can't be earned without your credit card.
---
&gt; I made it as far as reading the Fallout 1st bs. Nope. No. Not happening.
---
You and me both, which is a shame because I was looking foward to play the event. 
---
After all the problems and bullshit the updates had like laggy raids and borderline impossible farsnatch masks drops, this? They just keep asking for more and more money while delivering shit. 
---
Unopened vaults, unobtainable throphy mounts and beer keg, and now we have to pay for more stash space? This guys are sick.
---
I imagine there will be far fewer 1st members so the load on the servers won't be the same as if everyone had unlimited stashes. Maybe some of the revenue from the memberships may be going to more servers, too.
---
Fuck Nazis.
---
you can have unlimited scrap in your box, compared to a non-paying player who can't, that's the p2w part
---
From what I’m reading on. You can still access it. Just not deposit stuff in.
---
That is what I wanted too
---
No problem with paying for private servers here. They're just doing it wrong
---
Per their announcement you can still access whats in it; you just can't cram more in.
---
I cannot defend this shit anymore. This is disgusting.
---
With my limited time, it’s the only game I currently play. Still probably won’t get the sub, but who knows. Really don’t care about the outfit or private servers. Literally the 350 fee atoms a month is what I’d look at.
---
Yeah thinking about what I’ve already spent on atoms, this price point is fine.
---
Thanks for calling out the massive hypocrisy on this sub.
---
When you love hating Bethesda you never work a day in your life.
---
You always get a full tank on a new purchase, if you aren't you are actually getting scammed.
---
To be faire... ESO has also 10 times the content of FO76, and regular content updates which are still to be seen in FO76 after a complete year...
---
Time for a Legion playthrough!
---
I'm confused by your post.   
---
They are charging monthly - or offering a discount if you want to pay a year upfront.   
---
All updates are FREE already (no DLC coming as it splits playerbase)   
---
Im not saying they are doing things right, it just feels like they are doing exactly what you are asking for. Sorry, am I missing the point here?
---
An extra fast travel point for free? Being able to have literally infinite more things in your stash than other people.? Having an allowance you could easily spend on hundreds of utility items a month (a catagory they've already lied about twice).
---
It's objectively P2W
---
Yes, you can use the unlimited scrap box in adventure mode and the tent too
---
So you're planning to get others to pay towards your subscription fee, so you get all the other items that comes with the Private Server access, and they don't?
---
Wasnt the big speil from Todd Howard about making DLCs free because they didnt like to gate off content to some players but not to others, such as exclusive to Fallout 1st skins, items, bundles, deals....
---
Yep you can find 6 months Xbox love for £25 and like I have said elsewhere they expect us in the UK to pay over $35 more than someone in USA. Pisstake thieving bastards.
---
All those players myself included who stuck by this game since day 1 and this is what we get some P2W bollocks. Locking armour behind a paywall with no other way to get it
---
Lol what a cuck
---
Can you link the numbers you're quoting? I'm genuinely curious. I'd like to know if your brain interfaces with reality or if you just invent wild numbers to try to prove your points in arguments.
---
Also, can you explain why other games DO have MP services that don't cost extra, or even anything at all? I played Path of Exile completely for free and their servers perform a hell of a lot better than Bethesda's.
---
I was just thinking about selling some bobbleheads because they take up so much space.
---
I will get it for the 1st month, the amount of bonuses you get just for signing up are pretty good and that you get to keep it is even better. I am on PS4 and wouldn’t mind letting you join me to check it out some time.
---
It's really not.
---
Not that i'm judging, as i am guitly of buying multiple copies of games myself, but if you dont mind me asking why did you buy 4 copies of 76?
---
it costs 3 cents per 1,000 servers this isn't a joke that is the literal cost of bulk servers.
---
If you wanna see the outfit just play FNV? or download the Veteran Ranger mod for 4?
---
Gun shot looping fix, $50.99
---
But how much of this will they take away when ending the sub? like, all the Scraps
---
That's what kills me. These last two updates have been basically: 
---
Hey Vault-Dwellers, Big News! Wastelanders is being delayed until next year, so you don't have anything to do in this dying game. But don't worry! You now have the option to pay us money for basically no reason. Happy Halloween, Vault-Dwellers!
---
Bethesda sold a busted game and are now offering a paid maintenance plan so that you can buy the repairs.
---
Yeah calling this ESO76 is a massive insult to ESO.
---
its 13$ per month
---
When you pay $20 a month.
---
Want a bug fixed they will give you a price list. Thieves
---
Exactly that’s the initial game, the rest has to be paid for 👍🏽
---
Then in this case itll probably be saved to your console/PC most likey unless IMO since not many people will be getting the subscription it won't hurt the servers and that's what they are probably expecting
---
Oh no someone’s complaining about the same system every single MMORPG uses oh god it’s a tragedy oh no! If you don’t like it stop playing, the useless complaints help no one.
---
&gt; You are acting like people were clamoring for an "online fallout game"
---
a lot of people were asking for a fallout online game. 76 wasnt exactly what they exected. they wanted a game like NV where you and a few other friends could play together
---
I am buying it on PS4 but for myself only
---
I literally felt sick after reading the patch notes. It is even worse than I expected.
---
This is what I would like know. I fucking hope not.
---
Ah yes, because he certainly was the only person ever to think of that.
---
That's wrong
---
The price is about the same, WoW is like 13€. 
---
That said I'll problaby get it, but I don't feel like paying for a year up front so I really wish there were 3 and/or 6 month options.
---
You guys remember when buying a game was enough? Pepperidge farm remembers
---
It was always gonna be paid that's your own deal
---
Yes, but remember ESO on launch. Many people thought it was a massive failure of an MMO and thought it was going to die. Then they literally gutted the game and rebuilt it from the ground up. Kinda like what they are doing with the core ideas that failed with 76.
---
Todd Howard in disguise trying to boost morale by using nostalgia to  ldistract everyone from their blatant cash grab.
---
... nice try Todd. You almost got me.
---
I remember when NV was out and Dead money came out, people were hating on the game left and right. 
---
Now NV and Dead Money are the greatest Fallout content all of a sudden
---
They said you would keep whatever you got during your subscription
---
You played for 200 hours. You got your money's worth. You're like the middle aged women who buy wedding decorations on Friday and return them with the tags ripped off on Monday.
---
What is everyone seeing that I haven't seen? Anyone have a link for this?
---
I know some people just want co op fallout, but a huge part of the game for me is the other STRANGERS wandering around, friend or foe, etc.
---
Private servers is dumb
---
This is crazy. They should try something more like Fortnite, not messing with the game itself.
---
Dude that unlimited scrap thing is straight jacked up the frikkan hell bethesda if i wanted bullcrap like that id play eso
---
Yeah, no. None of this is beneficial for a game. Especially one as buggy and lacking in content as this one.
---
Even more were begging them not to go live service because they knew how shit live services end up due to greed.
---
You can find a handful of people wanting anything, the majority is the important group to listen to, otherwise you'd have shit like antivaxxers making laws.
---
\*pays 60 dollars from game and plays beta"
---
\*dosent play for 7 months\*
---
\*starts playing again last week\*
---
Todd, "give me more money its not like you are paying for like an actual advantage that is what scrap kits are this is merely a payed enhancement"
---
Nah I'll still play. I'm to high level, and the game is still fun
---
There isn’t an excuse for the pricing. The armour had better be cosmetic or will be uproar. And market will be saturated. They always said that the servers weren’t stable enough to handle unlimited stash but now you can have it and switch between private and public as you please. We have all been conned
---
Yup, still not free
---
(edit) you actually pay for the core game, every single expansion, a monthly (high) fee *and* you pay for extra mounts etc.
---
This is such a nonissue lol
---
It makes me really worried about how much longer we have with this game.
---
If they're doing so bad that they have to resort to paid subscriptions I can't imagine this lasting another year let alone the foreseeable future. 
---
This feels like they're about to give up.
---
Big yikes from me.
---
good night bugthesda !
---
Not really I play solo. There's no way to communicate with other players because I don't use a Mic..
---
 I don't use those stupid emotes because they can't relay what I'm trying to say anyway.
---
The logical outcone to this is that, much like ESO the staff size would increase tenfold instead of like... 6 people running this game. The inlogical and most likely outcome would be that game literally vomits on itself.
---
Think I will wait until Wastelanders comes out before I consider becoming a Fallout 1st member, so until then it's just going to be life as normal for my Cult of the Mothman follower.
---
Unlimited scarp space y'all are some of the most pathetic people ever I swear I have played the game since launch and never ever needed more than the current limit and.i do horde shit but you Kno what I Kno what I need and what I don't and dear I fucking say it fallout was never ever designed as a pvp game and it should never be so please please indulge me on how having more scrap is P2W
---
&gt; but now allow you to hold unlimited scrap with a subscription, which shows that holding any amount of scrap has no impact on it. 
---
No.  It shows that it takes dedicated servers and the money to run them.  Duh.   Your conclusion is 100% backwards.
---
It’s the exact same thing as ESO+ and guess what everyone loves that system. The only issue people have with this is the fact it’s on the black sheep of Bethesda games FO76
---
Yeah, I don't mind. PSN is DbLoki
---
Xbox 1
---
Im 99% sure some of the devs came out and said in an interview the stash limit was a design decision and not based on performance, they said it was because you should have to choose whats valuable and whats not, what to keep and what to throw away.  
---
But im guessing since we were initially lied to about it being a stability thing they never changed it
---
I get stuff takes money to do but subscriptions are the worst...  Give me a $10-15 DLC with this content and call it a fucking day.  This greedy shit has got to stop Bethesda.
---
No, just if you log out, someone who is still online needs a 1st subsctiption. People without 1st subscriptions can still join.
---
I imagine some will set up a way to go afk to stay online for their friends if they have to go to work or something. Really, it's a pointless restriction.
---
Lol people are so up in arms about this but I pay as much per month on average just for atoms. Plus you get atoms per month with it for -$9/mo I'm good
---
Uninstalled already. I'm not going to stick around to see what kind of bullshit they come up with next.
---
That is how it sounds.
---
I know it’s a pisstake.
---
$99.99 a year
---
£99.99 a year
---
Great exchange rate there fucking thieves
---
I agree, with the lack of content for me to enjoy right now it is hard to justify the subscription.  Now I basically log in to do my 150 daily scrip.  It really does not seem like all that bad value overall, I am just not as invested in the game until Wastelanders comes out
---
Yes I'd put money on the main game becoming F2P and then Fallout 1st as the full experience.
---
&gt; know one month isnt by any means a small amount of money. 
---
It *really* is though...
---
I literally walked over, took the disc out of my ps4, put it in its case, and tossed it in the closet. Looks like I'm picking up Outer Worlds to play instead. Obsidian DID make the best Fallout anyways with New Vegas. So why not give their new game a chance. 🤷‍♀️
---
What does a "dedicated server" have to do with the stash limit?  The same server runs the entire world, stash and everything, anything that affects a world affects the same server.  And storing more scrap wouldn't take any more processing power, no matter how many scrap you have each item is stored as a single variable and then simply has a number attached to it that represents how many of that item you have.  You really don't seem to understand how Fallout 76 servers work.
---
😅 I’ve got plenty
---
Power to you then. I'm not here to tell you how to spend your money/atoms. I just think what they're doing is scuzzy.
---
Maybe they delayed the patch to nuke their own reputation even more with this patch today :D
---
Yet after a year after launch which game was buggier? LOL
---
Welp...Youtube's gonna explode. I'm not buying anything else except the thing I've already bought and that's the base game, period.
---
I am however extremely saddened that instead of good new content to explore, play &amp; enjoy we are constantly getting Atom Shop updates &amp; convenience items and now this arse of an update.
---
I was hoping that after a year there would be more places to explore, more items to grind and more monsters to slay.
---
I really hope this is not \_why\_ Wastelanders was pushed forward...
---
Why does it matter so much? They said they were charging for private servers (which is  not an unheard of practice) and this way they added more benefits to make it more palatable. $13 a month gets you $16.50 worth of atom a month, a private server, second "CAMP", and unlimited storage for **scrap.**  If you don't want it, fine, don't get it. You aren't getting a competitive advantage in PVP or anything so seriously who gives a shit
---
my biggest complaint is the unlimited scrap stash when they said that increasing the normal stash size induces server instability
---
From the downvotes you recieved, it looks like people don't want you to win.  Upvote me and I promise to win by not paying.
---
Still it remains to be said,  this is a feature that we players actually requested, a separate unlimited stash that (hopefully!) doesn't impact server or client performance. We just didn't ask for it to be at a premium, but there you go.

For me, I sadly won't have a choice, as I've been throwing away precious scrap materials constantly for stash management. And I've been buying the special deal atom packages every time they were available, anyway, so Fallout 1st is merely a 50% price hike on those for me (this doesn't apply to everyone, obviously).
---
The one-year sub is an even better deal, sure, but not worth considering even for me with &gt;1500 hours already invested, because how do I know I will still be playing in six months from now?
---
What problem I see with the scrapbox is PvP / griefing, when the guy who killed you and took all your junk can easily stash it by deploying his survival tent and going to his scrapbox. I neither do PvP nor would I touch other people's junk (pun intended), but at least I won't be at the receiving end of this mechanic any longer because I'm not forced to carry hundreds of mats with me any more.
---
Lol the atom shop is Not even canon...... I mean liberty prime Power armor you think is ok but Ranger armor oh shit
---
Absolutely wrong lol. Read again.
---
But you won't get anything and every sane person knows that.  
---
Bethesda just tries to milk as much money from this disaster of a game as they can. :)
---
&gt; everyone of your team will need the subscription
---
Blatantly false
---
I have no idea how on earth Bethesday still has anyone supporting them, even on their forums. I hope your actually an bethesda PR guy, because god damn if your not I feel legitimately sad that you've spent this much time on this trash pay to win asset flip.
---
Sell junk? Not hoard it for crafting or something ?
---
You can RP last 8 people alive or one PvP group hunting other :(
---
The elder coat was only for cash buyers as well, this is not the first.
---
Also lets not forget you can't even Mod or do anything really with these private servers lol which make the idea entirely pointless thats a failure on epic proportions, Bethesda is so out of touch with the players i think their staff got replaced by robots who only see spreadsheets or something.
---
It's scrap... you shouldn't be hoarding scrap in your normal storage let alone in a purchased infinite storage.
---
There's no scrap in this game you can't easily collect on an as needed basis... this feature is no more necessary than the repair or scrap kits from the at om shop.
---
Do you think you're being cheeky or something? Link the article, like a sane person.
---
It's awfully quick for a person to change their mind about something that's as small as this. Heck, diving into the Vault 87 entrance that is your post history, you seem to claim that private servers are pay to win, (also) because you can... level up there, and that's apparently the point of it? You can literally get level 50 in a few weeks or a month at most, and you don't need to level up any more if you have everything figured out.
---
Why are you not listing the stuff I've asked you to list, since my first reply?
---
Ah yes the shitty workshops and unlimited scrap space is not P2W please indulge how it is
---
Kinda sucky but that is how it works in many games so I am not totally shocked
---
I just have a job where I have to manage infrastructure costs. Money has to come from somewhere. Subscriptions are long overdue IMO.
---
I'm not a fan of the atom shop 'but our cosmetic garbage' model of supporting stuff like this long term. Hopefully they can pay developers to fix things and stop paying modelers to slap crappy skins on garbage. 
---
I want the trade bug to go away, not another vending machine skin.
---
The problem is ESO has an unreal amount of content to go through where the monthly subscription makes more sense. 
---
In FO76 there’s no new content and you’re paying $100 a year primarily for unlimited scrap over the other things...
---
Nope, go watch youtube, lots of people who don't even care one way or the other about bethesda or obsidian are loving the game.
---
I’d assume it’s an intelligence perk?
---
No I just think that you’re an idiot and blinded by the fact that this isn’t the game YOU wanted
---
Totally agree! They waited until a week before to mention we would have to pay. I could understand if the server was like Nitrado where you can change settings etc but it's basically a normal server reserved for members only. It's very expensive like everything else in the game.
---
Where did I say that? It was an example of what a group of what people could do you nutjob. And if they were all in, they could all use the stash by giving their stuff to the guy who actually owns it and share materials. What the hell is wrong with you.
---
Oh no, I’m not going to buy it. I just mean getting 1650 atoms a month is nothing to sneeze at.
---
I’m just super glad Outer Worlds drops soon. I think I’m done with WV. So much for Bethesda’s solo player love.
---
Can you give an example of a game that does a $5 sub fee? I have only seen those with either free online or $10+ a month
---
I am incredibly disappointed.
---
It's like poetry.... doesn't rhyme, but its beautiful.
---
And so is server persistence - I need the community to be able to play without the F1st users online.
---
Not anywhere near as much of a failure as Fo76 launch was, and after the recent news of actual in game improvements being delayed then they add this, you see why a backlash will happen, this update/subscription should've been added after wastelanders.
---
thats been my point from the start. Once the door is opened.......... very hard to close it again. I dont care WHAT opens the door, just that , nothing ,  should.
---
the worst part is it's not even a decent recreation, it's more like a bastardization
---
[compare it to the Fallout 4 New Vegas recreation](https://www.artstation.com/artwork/k4av10)
---
Inventory space is winning this is ptw in my case i cant move at a normal pace and becuz of it i cant fight in pvp cuz i move to slow
---
Yeah it seems weird
---
No, it's not... stop spreading bullshit dude...
---
From what I understand, most of these microtransaction stores make the vast amount of their income off of a small base of buyers (whales). There is no incentive for them to spend money to make things better when all they have to do is keep that tiny demographic hooked.
---
This is the endgame. Pay money to get benefits.
---
In the future they may add increased budget to private servers
---
Dude is trying to stir the pot over shit not even implemented yet
---
Exclusive outfits that break the lore yaaaaayyy
---
Im killing myself
---
Bethesda mentioned mod support and stuff though....
---
What?  No, it doesn't.  It's a variable with a number attached.  Dedicated servers have nothing to do with the stash limit.  I've explained this two you in two other threads now.
---
I feel as though they don’t want this to be a “winnable” game so P2W wouldn’t matter. Very similar to ESO is how I see the future of this game.
---
You can use that scrap box on public worlds too pal
---
Most of MMORPG's have actual content, interesting mechanics, challenging Pvp. This game lacks in every department
---
It frustrates me how the Internet keeps fucking changing their minds like that. I know it's a congregation of people who don't even know eachother, but they seem awfully capable of consistently hating Fallout 76 for the dumbest reasons and making up literal bullshit arguments to prove their points, resorting to lying.
---
Fallout 76 fans will find a way to defend this shit
---
Kind of, you can access the stuff you put in the new storage space indefinitely, but you can’t put anything in there once the subscription expires.
---
You PAY for an in-game advantage over people that don't pay. That's what Pay To Win is. That's the definition of the term.
---
Okay, and my point is that doesn't make the slightest scrap of sense. When you don't draw any logical connection between why one getting in would lead to another, then you might as well complain that they should never had made a game, or had any content at all, because that ***opens the door.***
---
Do you genuinely think the American Flag and a bear as player icons are dangerous and opening the door? Because if so, that's bonkers, if not, you've just defeated your own argument, not everything is a slippery slope. That's just a logical fallacy.
---
They announced that using New Vegas iconic armor 2 days before the Outer Worlds launch. Funny.
---
I dont think you understand why people are pissed in the slightest.
---
If they didn't want to add an unlimited junk storage container, it wouldn't be in the fucking pass. The fact that they added this unlimited storage tells us this is how the Developers want people to play their game.
---
It's reasonable on free-to-play games where you aren't paying for the experience. I actually just so happened to buy Fallout 76 (I massed over 200 hours on PC) around 30 minutes ago for £20 on PS4, only to be kicked the very instant I download it and be told that If I want to store a competetive amount of items, I'm going to have to fork out £100 a year.
---
1st is extremely dumb in every sense of what it is, especially when nothing about it is 'cosmetic' as we were still told.
---
What's even more dumb is the idiots supporting it as a good paywall to play the game. You've shadowed other people for having an opinion and for that, my good friend, you're a fucking idiot and one of the reasons 76 will die.
---
Luckily I can get a refund on my PS4 version as I've less than 20 minutes play time.
---
Honestly 7.99 sounds pretty good, I wouldnt mind if they cut the atom count
---
happy cake day
---
Thats £4 more per month than I pay for my minecraft server, which is on 24/7, can hold 48 people and I can mod to my hearts content
---
&gt;As someone who has every magazine and Bobbleheads, I welcome this!
---
Likewise!
---
My CAMP will be eternally grateful
---
This isn’t fallout anymore.....
---
That's fair, I was too.
---
I’d agree for the most part... but did you play ESO at release? It was AWFUL. Stale, grinding, no real dialogue choice for questers, etc.
---
I get private servers with 15$ per month with some benefits. Even the scrapbox i can handle, but the Ranger Armor? That's a dick move
---
Why is the helmet brighter than the rest of the armour?, also the fingerless gloves, they can't even copy another developer's work correctly for a subscription service bonus
---
For robotics you have to craft the piece for it to count
---
This would be a dream.  I am hoping this becomes an option when we can start modding this thing.
---
Rolls D100 ... "oh boy, you are in for a ride!"
---
You forgot to mention
---
-a month of hitting up Fort Defiance and no one else nabbing the asylum uniforms
---
-a month of being able to do events without worrying about idiots one-shoting legendaries. 
---
-a month of farming west Tec with no arriving and finding corpses
---
Perfect. Just in time for Outer Worlds coming out. Bethesda are out of their minds. .Instead of paying $20 a month I'm buying Outer Worlds when its released in 2 days. Fallout 76 Is an unstable game that constantly crashes at the worst time. As others mention there is ZERO end game things to do. As a solo player Vault 94 is useless to me(Why not a solo version for people like us? Its always been a solo game)  I'm happy they are postponing Wastelanders but if they had their shit together they could have it done instead of using resources to fix a game that to today is still pretty broken a year after its release. 
---
October 25...2 days. Outer worlds. Lets all use our money in that direction. At least until Wastelanders.
---
&gt;really doesn't seem that crazy, and it helps the further survival and development of the game..
---
You're crazy to think this money really is going to go into further dev of the game. It's a simple greedy cash grab on their part
---
I have seen them in a couple of player vendors recently.
---
I think some of them really just don't understand those types of servers and how they work. It would be amazing in this game if we could build up private worlds with camps that stay permanently
---
I’m gonna do this, get the armor, atoms, etc, and go on a junk collection marathon and fill that scrap box, then cancel and still have access to all that junk... unless I’m missing something, the scrap box contents can be used, just not added to.
---
This is not giving me high hopes for the seires or elder scrolls
---
I get needing to make money but this is beyond a joke.
---
The way I read it you will have to put them in the other box.  Then if your subscription ends you can still take things out of the other box just not add to said box.
---
If I am reading that correctly.
---
Well, it can work like that, they’re just not doing it that way. That same rule can apply whether there’s 7 or 23 invites.
---
Just watch the price of any actually desirable atom shop items ratchet up to put pressure on people to get those 'best value' atoms with 1st.
---
Amazingly well done. :)
---
They've found a way to defend this game since launch
---
So out of those 50 to 100 people none of them can check version history when releasing patches... like patch 5 and patch 10?
---
All you have done is explain how little you understand servers. 
---
" It's a variable with a number attached."
---
Every server support specialist in the world is laughing their heads off at you right now. This is the most basic, misinformed statement ever.
---
The cost is *not* reasonable, as they could have handed the files off to the community, and let them run their own servers off their own hardware, while leaving the paid option for those without the hardware or knowhow to do so.
---
I.love new vegas but dead money sucked and yah i remember the hate too strange its like people forgot
---
From what I can recall they switched to revert a declining playerbase.
---
Oh and you can only have 7 friends on your server, so not usable for f76 faction clans for operations and such. And the person that owns it has to be online for the server to stay up unless someone else in the server when they leave has 1st... oh and the server stability issues, why we couldn't have unlimited storage.... welp unlimited scrap storage for members...
---
I have a junkies lever action and a furious handmade.  Either weapon works quite well.  It'd be even easier if I had a junkie's handmade instead.  Just aim for the noggin in vats and crit them into oblivion.  Shouldn't take more than a clip if you're stealth.  
---
Dunno why someone downvoted the comment.
---
Hmm ok thanks for the reply
---
Don’t judge me on my bone storing habits!
---
It's an MMO. People trade caps for items that make them do better. Put a camp in the ash-heap. A camp near the TOTW. And the vault ofc in the forest. You've cut down on thousends monthly spent on fast travel.
---
You're such an apologist you can't see basic facts or definitions.
---
I just uninstalled it. Might come back if it somehow cures itself of this retardness.
---
If it was a dedicated server I’d get it, but Bethesda deliberately chose to make them this way to make money, it’s just so careless to the fans.
---
That all falls under the
---
-1 month of quality time
---
There's a few differences, though. One very noticeable is that ESO *actually has some fucking content*.
---
I have to laugh about how you think that Outer Worlds is in competition with Fallout 76. The success or failure of Outer Worlds has no bearing on the state of the game industry, the decision making of how Bethesda makes its games profitable, or will it change the fact that lots of people love Fallout 76 and play it often.
---
Thanks for your patronage, Vault-Dweller! We at Bethesda strongly believe it's players like you that make Fallout 76 an amazing experience! That's why we're introducing Fallout 2nd, and just for the low-low price of $24.99/mo, we'll sell you back the weapons we nerfed! But that's not all - you also get a Vault-Tec pumpkin for your C.A.M.P.! Thanks for being a loyal Bethesda customer, Vault-Dweller!
---
&gt; Private Worlds
---
They basically sell you Private Worlds. The feature people are asking for since release. All the other stuff is just cluther. Don't read this announcment wrong it's just paying for being able to play alone with a frien...
---
&gt;As a member of Fallout 1st, you also gain access to your own private Scrapbox. Use the Scrapbox to store all your crafting components so they aren’t taking up space in your Stash Box.
---
What. How. What. This is a feature people wanted since release. This is a basic quality of life feature. Something that would've been made available via mods three days after its release if it wasn't a live-service game. And now they want **FIFTEEN EUROS** per month for it or **ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY** a year. 
---
This is more then a UHD Netflix subscription. What. How. Why. What. 
---
I don't know if i should cry out in anger or get an erection from the sheer brazen audacity of it.
---
My JE shotgun is permanently damage bugged so I don't even know their potential atm. :P
---
If anyone has played ESO - this is just how it starts.
---
Get ready for "Crown Crates" next :(
---
Yeah I was on from day 1. Don't get me wrong it had issues, but I never experienced any that were half as annoying as the ones in 76.
---
Oh my. The balls of Bethesda doing this is actually funny and sad at the same time
---
I have already tried to purchase the subscription. For me it is a good deal.  I dont see the problem so much being the stash, but the tent is huge. Just about everyone builds a nice base that is just about impossible to rebuild if you move. I was super excited about the whole camp thing, but it was unuseable if I wanted a nice camp.
---
The tent being an atom only purchase would have been horrible on it's own, but behind the paywall is ridiculous.  I will gladly fork over the cash for the sub, but I feel the tent being first exclusive is a dick move.
---
Scrapbox is a separate storage space from your Stash, your Stash space remains the same
---
I’m honestly going to miss it
---
More like Beetlejuice's number in line at the end of the movie. Before he stole the other dude's number and got his head shrunk.
---
A red dot and short scope would be nice. Explosive bolts would be a lot of fun for amusing PvP fights and NPCs.
---
Because this is literally how servers have always worked in this game.
---
They don't have servers with worlds 1-infinity lined up always running and ready for people to log into, servers are generated on an as needed basis when the previous server reaches it's player cap and when the last person logs off of a world that server is unloaded.
---
Y'all are some of the most pathetic community I have ever seen in my life cry about unlimited scrap storage and let me ask you would you be willing to pay 120-200$ for a game games have stayed 60$ dollars even through inflation and on top of that the equipment to make graphics and stuff better also is alot more expensive and games stay 60$ Dollars but 90% of people wouldn't pay 120-200$ for game
---
And what does the definition say right below it?
---
But the private server doesn’t do anything except exclude random players.   Which is not good for the community at all so what’s the fucking point
---
Thats almost the exact same monetization system they use for ESO. its nothing new. Its just a pricing scheme they know will work.
---
Must be hard to be you
---
Yeah a big told ya so to those claiming the scrap bot and fridge wasnt a slippery slope
---
I was against it at first but i believe i have been won over, well played bethesda well played a tip of my hat to u
---
Is it possible they introduced one for the same reason? Because this seems like a much better sub. I know it seems a little p2w but I don't think it affects much, all of the bonuses seem kinda minor
---
\^\^ this.
---
Very true. This game should have been primed way heavier
---
Got you confused with another bootlicker here: 
---
https://old.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/dm0bkw/now_that_weve_seen_how_private_servers_are/f4vimo7/
---
All the salt is making this popcorn mighty tasty
---
Or you know the fact they are prioritizing this shit sub model over fixing game bugs that are still in the game since launch. Or the fact they constantly lie to us. But hey other games do it lol
---
Exactly my thought.
---
Was literally gonna decide whether to get 76 or outer world's this Friday. My decision has been made
---
I was wondering this as well.  Why not offer a cheaper subscription option without private servers?  I am a solo player mostly as well and don't see how this benefits me.  The idea of additional atoms, tent, scrapbox, cosmetics, etc. seems decent enough for a subscription fee that is cheaper.  Just my two cents.
---
Patch notes must have come out, people bitching
---
They just changed their stance last week, this was to be expected they aren’t going to run private servers for free and servers alone aren’t worth the upkeep cost so they have to sweeten the deal
---
75 GB isnt even that large for modern games, i have ARK survival Evolved installed, its over 150gb.
---
Fallout 3, or even fallout 4 online would have been leagues better than this buggy money grab. I don't understand how you could have paid full price for this game and still think it's worth defending. Out of genuine curiosity, what makes you think this game is worth defending at this point?
---
If we're being honest, and you have to really consider whether you can afford $13 or not, gaming (particularly games as a service) might not be the best hobby for you.
---
The pricing wouldn't be much of an issue if the game wasn't still a broken mess *one year later*, missing tons of QoL features. They just launched private servers and subscription fees and *the social tab is still broken on PC*. Good luck managing your servers in these circumstances.
---
Chat text is still missing too.
---
Just.. ugh...
---
What advantage?? Having more steel? It's a CO-OP survival game more than a PVP game nowadays. I'm happy that guy next to me has enough scrap to make enough ammo to pump into the queen
---
More importantly, what happens to the **survival tent** after the subscription ends? Does it stay on the map, but you cannot edit it anymore, or does it disappear completely? (I suspect it disappears, I just want a confirmation)
---
Can you edit the camp other than place it/move it?
---
Does it include a scrapping station of some sort?!
---
You mad bro?
---
Yay I’m glad I made it in with a 8 days before my cake day. By the way everyone is invited.
---
With the sub, it is literally a two-class system.
---
PS2 also has a 'developer' with a shady past who has history of trying to milk every last cent of each hype-wave and abandoning projects as soon as the hype shifts so they have some similarities indeed
---
&gt; Nazis and White supremacist killing people in the US? lmao
---
Yes, that is literally a thing. Why are you just laughing at people dying from hate crimes?
---
&gt;60 people get shot every week in Chicago and news flash it ain’t white folks but hey you can’t be a victim pushing those facts.
---
Oh okay, I get why. Man, that was about as unsubtle a dogwhistle as you can get, you people really need to put more effort into it.
---
Bro its just junk this juat mean cheaper more abundant junk for sale
---
Of they do that then I either expect compensation for the 60 bucks I spent buying it in the first place, or a whole 60 bucks worth of benefits for me paying for it in the first place
---
I know but scrap won't count towards stash anymore which is awesome
---
For me Private worlds means nothing as most of my friends stopped playing this months ago. I do like the idea of getting monthly atoms along with exclusive sales in the Atomic Shop. Which does offset the monthly cost as you would pay around £12 for the equivalent on the Xbox/PS stores if you buy atoms every month  
---
The scrapbox and survival tent sounds nice but i feel like it takes away the "hardship" of living in a wasteland 
---
The fact that these are available in the main world does put me off 
---
So £11.99 a month or £100 for the year I'm on the fence since gamewise i don't have much else to do
---
Its a business man of course their end goal is to make money. Thats what it means.
---
The issue with that is that giving unlimited scrap space automatically increases premium members stash space, because regular stash is now junkless.
---
Actually I think it's better because new content is still free, whereas unless you have premium you must purchase each one on ESO
---
It’s not gonna crash and burn, just relax dude is are you really so butt hurt you have to complain on the internet
---
   
---
bethesda is a joke
---
Mmm the subscription seems pretty good though
---
Especially for a game that is broken, buggy, and poorly designed.
---
It's almost like Bethesda literally doesn't give two shits about what it does with it's fanbase anymore.
---
Sorry, I just can't defend a game that is already dying for lack of content, bugs and crap stability, and instead of improving that adds a subscription to milk dumbass players.
---
I think its good, keeps it more exclusive and means I'll see less people running aound looking the same or as good as I do, thats what would end up happening if they had just released it in the atom store
---
I did the math and it comes out to around $.07 per hour of gameplay based on my average playtime per month.
---
Sounds like a great deal to me, I'm subscribing for a year as soon as I get home.
---
You’re right. The whole game is won at that point! /s
---
you clearly have no idea what you are talking about.
---
All dlc will be free they said, if they go back on their word for this. I'd be done
---
They said "exclusive for members" i wouldnt be surprised if you can only use it while you actually have an active sub...
---
I wont be surprised by any shady money making scheme from them anymore...
---
There's already an armour set included in the subscription
---
The keyword is 'no longer *sometimes*' -- it now 'always' loops endlessly. Democracy is non-negotiable.
---
I hope there will also be a silver membership once. where I can only use the private world with my friends without other bllshts. but for reasonable, requisite money, not for this Joke. i dont same mistake again.
---
You shouldn't have to try, as soon as you realized you didn't actually like it you would have done better moving on
---
Ah bummer. Well back to f4 then. Ty though.
---
&gt;Only 7 people on a private world?
---
That's how they can up your stash.
---
These are the real changes we wanna see lol
---
Silence is golden.
---
I’m curious how it’s P2W lmao more stash space?
---
My unlimited scrap stash box will one shot the queen.
---
It's all connected, isn't it?
---
Yeah i wanna see it live too, after the one sniper outfit missing gloves.
---
"Fallout 76 is just becoming a Mobile game at this point. Log in once a day to do your things, and pay for shortcuts"
---
THIS X 1000000
---
Dedicated servers cost money on their part, but the scrapbox is not defendable whatsoever.
---
Eh. The samurai armour looks cool but is a bit much, they're kind of all over the place with the game's visual themes. 
---
Also, the wallpapers are mostly ugly. I find it funny that most people were requesting new wall types, and instead we're getting ugly interiors to match the ugly exteriors. xD
---
I would like them to put the things people have been asking for into the base game, not charging extra after already charging for the game.
---
And the homework was inside my dog!  The carpet is fucked!
---
We pay like 135 dollars for something that American gets for 99. 
---
It is a rip off.
---
This happens every time I select a weapon or a piece of armor to sell. I have to price them one at a time, exiting and re entering for each item. It doesn’t happen on plans or aid items but it truly pisses me off! One of the many small bugs that annoy me on a daily basis.
---
They still have to compete with other players on farming that scrap. Its not like they're provided an exclusive area to farm it.
---
Would you like some cheese ?
---
It doesn't have to be PvP to be pay to win. It just has to involve spending real life money to gain an advantage over someone who didn't pay. Whether or not you feel the advantage is significant is irrelevant.
---
I wasn't going to ask my friends to sub (and they likely won't). I just wanted to host a place for us.
---
"We are soooo sorry! We really understand how badly you all want a higher stash limit, but the servers just can't handle it..."  
---
***paying a 15€ bribe***  
---
"Ok, just kiddin'. Actually, the stash limit isn't neccessary at all"
---
Bethesda says yes, but it cost 500 atoms
---
It's a shitty version of ESO+.
---
It's also a slap in the face when you consider the fact they've delayed Wastelanders but still thought it was a wise decision to both announce and launch this service in the time gap Wastelanders was originally supposed to launch.
---
Not to mention tying the most iconic modern 3d Fallout armor to the subscription to atleast try and drain one month sub out of the hardcore fans is a big ol' dick move.
---
I got my Prime Receiver plans for LMG, Lever Gun and 10 MM Auto from regular SB's, all in Ash Heap.
---
&gt;Fix the damn Trading Glitch, this has been going on for too long
---
 Fix the damn Trading Glitch, this has been going on for too long
---
Bethesda is jealous of the accents, and instituted the up charge.  :)
---
Then don’t play. Simples.
---
I remember xbox live and psn being £5 a month. £12 a month is seriously overpriced for what you get.
---
I preordered the tricentennial edition for 120 dollars and all I got for that was some pictures and a skin. Now they have the balls to offer 100 dollars for a season pass. Jesus Christ
---
Okay, that's actually a pretty good deal.
---
it's the fact that before the game launched they said that private servers were going to be added post launch. alot of people, me included would rather play on a private server with group of friends instead of bunch of randoms on a broken server. now they didn't say it would be "free" but its pretty shitty to charge for it.
---
I have bought this game after the free weekend, I am a very casual player and only log on occasionally. 
---
I had quite some hopes, I enjoyed the base very much and was looking forward to the wastelanders add-on. 
---
I get delays for wanting to bring quality, it's disappointing but still.
---
But this just dumb, for several reasons:
---
1. The goodwill is barely returning after the disappointing launch, people have been defending this game more and more. 
---
2. Player counts are low, but slowly rising. So in my opinion you nourish that part, give people a reason to play this.
---
3. The bad raid, like the raid launched in an almost worse state than the game itself. Still bugged as hell by the way.
---
4. They have delayed a much wanted add-on. Not a bad decision but in light of this, it worries me if they chose this launch over the wastelanders. Probably different departments but still.
---
5. Still a ton amount of bugs and errors.
---
The first two points are probably going to slow down or halt. Any goodwill is gone and  I don't see anyone promoting the game after this.
---
Point 3 and 5 are another big reason why this is a bad decision, they are offering a subscription for a broken product, no matter how much has been fixed, the game is still not stable. No one but the most diehard fan will subscribe.
---
Point 4: seriously why announce this before your big add-on with classic gameplay. This adds to point 2 as well.
---
It's just a really dumb decision.
---
To be honest, since I hit endgame I only really log in to catch up with a few friends who are still playing. But yeah Outer Worlds and red dead here I come!
---
Next, diluting the product further
---
Comes with fallout 1st month 2...
---
Cures your diseases too!
---
Who cares? That doesn’t help you “win”.
---
I hope to god they don’t
---
You mean like with a virtual shop or something where they could, i dont know sell cute costumes for money?
---
Yeah of course that doesnt suit a fallout game... /s
---
It already has a MTX ingame shop that sells gameplay relevant items, a subscription on top for how little content the game has is ridiculous and scummy.
---
I would'nt call it a rip-off, you get a shit ton of atoms and private servers. But it is too high of an price
---
Bethesda announced just last week that FO76 was going full-on P2W.
---
Did you think BGS was going to waste any time on the subsequent milking of the player base?
---
Oh, sorry, I thought your post was satirical. I didn't think anyone could be downing that much kool aid. Enjoy paying 100 bucks a year for a game you've at least spent 60 bucks on
---
Indeed. You almost get more atoms if you don't use the 1st subscription. That is ridiculouse
---
Yeaaahhhh, was thinking this as well.  Really odd.
---
But considering they just dropped a subscription plan days after delaying Wastelanders....yeeaahhh...not sure about their decision making right now...
---
Thanks everyone who asked me to add them! I added y’all this morning. :) :) next time I’m on I will ask if someone is and we can slaughter some wendigos! I’m so excited!!
---
K.
---
Wow, the ball was dropped.
---
If you just un select it from your pop boy as a daily it never goes off. I had to do it like 6 months ago and I’ve just never turned it back on lol.
---
I don't understand why it doesn't persist as long as someone is on it. God forbid I want to change chars or take a 15 min break. Sorry everyone! I am hoping that's not the case and we are misunderstanding things.
---
You can have all the junk in the world and I could still rock you with my best gun.
---
Bethesda - Lets go Whaling boys!
---
Wasn't ESO also a disaster at launch?
---
And now you're trying to imitate me. It's quite ironic how you're accusing me of changing the subject after being quite-unquote "proven wrong", yet you're the one who keeps accusing the new private server thing of being 100% pay-to-win without even listing the pay-to-win items in the atom store... after being asked to do so multiple times.
---
Besides, that was supposed to humble you up. Not everyone will do your bidding. You are not Gustavo Fring.
---
I’ve been defending Bethesda, but I agree with you. The only thing I’d be okay with is the eso approach and that’s AFTER we have some decent content 3 years down the road.
---
Stop whining! They already said it will be free.
---
I tried an identical shotgun and other similar weapons and the permanent damage bug seems to be on all shotguns but no other weapons.
---
If you're talking about irl, I like the one I have, thanks. :P
---
They said a bunch of things they went back on their word on. Not saying this will 100% be one of them but yeah they lie often
---
So you are saying items that should be included in a paid to play game, but sold in a shop for a currency created by Bethesda, that has no real value at all, giving them for a real money subscription, is value?
---
Ok.
---
The vast majority are done not just with Fallout 70shid but Bethesda in general.
---
I wont be buying another game by them unless it is on sale $20 or less. 
---
I will not support a company who lies and provides a shit service.
---
Private server? What we got are servers dedicated to VIP members. It is not the same thing.
---
And they're locking the ability to store unlimited crafting components behind a subscription paywall, unless I'm reading it wrong. For many players, that Scrapbox would free up a huge chunk of inventory, which has been a primary concern/request since launch.
---
Yes, *technically* it's not in the Atomic Shop, so the quote doesn't *really* apply... but this is a slap in the face to the player base. Let's try this quote instead:
---
&gt; “There’s always going to be new content, changes in game balance,  whatever it takes, and by the way, it’s all free after launch – all our content, there’s no season pass and no paid DLCs." - *Peter Hines*
---
Wait, Whats the scrapbot? Does it autoscrap stuff?   
---
I haven't played the game since launch.
---
Yes. And you should smack yourself. Youre the one who bought it 2 times. Must really love bethesda huh? Fail lmao
---
What the holy hell did I miss?
---
You can’t play cause you’re calling this game out on it’s bullshit that we are more then happy to eat* fucking lol
---
I’m laughing at you because you’re a liar and not from Eastern Europe.  You’re some self loathing ANTIFA brat perpetually triggered.
---
Have a good day (you won’t)
---
Haha, sure. People keep saying they're done with the game since the BETA and yet here we are
---
That exists in addition to being able to host your own servers / the ability to just join a friend's server if they are using the Microsoft store version.
---
FO76 has no option for you to host your own servers.
---
See ya later, you don't owe anything to businesses ya know. As soon as you realized the game wasn't for you I would have moved on. Some of us like games like NMS and Rust, it's just different tastes
---
&gt;market for wood
---
Lol.    
---
But I agree it's a big concern for steel.
---
It's super obscure even for old gamers.
---
typo'd
---
Imagine thinking you need to be able to one shot queen or other ridiculous fallacies to make the game P2W 🤡
---
It is worth having one if you want to quickly get max caps for the Robot vendors, but one run of Westek gets you pretty close.  I have all the recipes, but mostly because it was my cap sink for a month or two.  I sell quite a few but I will likely never recoup my investment, but endgame caps are plentiful and have little value.
---
Wow 
---
I loved this game but this is not okay..
---
I'm starting to lose hope for this game.
---
In any other game where community feedback is exchanged, those great ideas make it into the game where everybody can enjoy them and it helps add more content to the experience.
---
In Fallout 76, all community ideas forwarded to the developer team are added to the game behind a paywall and only a select group of people who actually spend more money on the game, or are lucky enough to have Atoms can experience those things.
---
The developers for 76 are not doing anything to add to the primary content of the game in a significant way. As an example, there's dozens of workshop items from Fallout 4 that aren't in Fallout 76, but Bethesda hasn't even added them in yet as standard objects.  
---
Wild Appalacha has added things, but the amount of things added are almost always fleeting because of how they're obtained.
---
&gt;Private servers cost MONEY to operate
---
Not when they shut down once you leave...
---
But we could have already kept all junk out of our stash..it doesn't change anything. I have mules with no junk, only weapons, armor and outfits...literally nonothing has changed.
---
Welp, that statement aged well.
---
Agreed. And they were doing so well for a while.
---
Its something I've wanted since Fallout: NV really. Fallout 3 didn't really need it I suppose, but Fallout: NV would have made a lot of sense to get a dual wield for pistols with the revolvers and such. And after Skyrim came out with dual wielding swords and daggers and such, I was shocked when Fallout 4 didn't have dual wielding for pistols. Really all they have to do for some balance is make it so you can't aim down sights while doing it, only hip-fire. Kind of like how in Skyrim you can't block when dual wielding swords, only attack/power attack. So I guess no grenades/aim down sight as the tradeoff for dual wielding?
---
So pay for a month, store up on everything on your private server in a 8 people farm setup and when its over you never have to collect scrap again?
---
I dont think they will allow that...
---
Yeah maybe some jerks will do that. Hopefully not on the bedroom floor.
---
You tell me this NOW?!?! Lol but thank you though for next time this bug happens 😂
---
Never talked to the mayor on my alt.  Silence is golden.
---
Infinite scrap, not infinite storage. You still to run a second character to carry all your meds and weapons.
---
Oh, I took an improv class, certainly more outside than you've ever known of.
---
If I suggest to a manufacturer that they make and sell something I want, then expect them to give it to me for free because I suggested it is beyond ignorant and entitled.
---
This 'community' is just a pile of anonymous people playing a game, talking about it on an online discussion forum, this may give Bethesda ideas if they notice, but this *pile of peeps* have no power and are entitled to nothing, beyond the freedom to stop playing and delete FO76 from their devices and move on, we are all free to do that.
---
And *Caveat emptor* also applies to people who buy video games.
---
Fuck!
---
Imagine thinking you need to be able to one shot the queen or other ridiculous fallacies to make the game P2W
---
I don't mind if they work on other content, that's not the issue. I just don't like that they're making gameplay improvements that you have to pay extra for, and charging an insane price.
---
I paid $15 to watch a monkey kick a field goal before so....
---
It's not the devs, it's the people in the business office...
---
Perfect, that’s what everyone has been begging for.
---
Can someone clarify for me, is a private server character locked to that server?  Or can you use your already existing character.  Just curious about this portion of the server.
---
This will be my issue. The prior explanation for the storage cap was server stability. If that's no longer an issue then this is some bulls%$t.
---
To be fair...alright, I can't BS my way outta this one. But you got to admit there's at least a bunch of quests here and there that'll keep you around for a good amount of hours. It's just after you complete all of that do you run out of stuff to do
---
3 in classfreak makes the penalties of pretty much every mutation negligible.
---
'A "gem" like Outerworlds' he says as the game is not even out yet and it pulled all of its content from past bethesda games with a no mans sky art-style. Hunger, thirst, a VATS system, watched CohhCarnage dump all his ammo on a difficult enemy and it dropped no loot. This time they just added some Borderlands memery.
---
The entire game is again a parody on capitalism and corporate injustice just like Fallout....but in space like everything else in our modern times. (Occupy Mars btw)
---
You can also only spend 99 for a year as a discount and if you have a job you can work for 1 weekend and afford a lot of shit for your downtime. Or go ahead and play the other game but make the decision before typing about it in the forum you don't care about. ggez
---
It would make my day to nuke it, so everyone's a winner...at least in game.  If someone's making racist towers in their leisure time, I doubt the word winner can describe their life.
---
The scrap bpx applies bpth in adventure and in private my boi.
---
I just pitched a survival tent in my pants.
---
I was willing to play this broken game because it was fun, it sincerely was, bugs and all I had fun.  But if you expect us to *subscribe* to this for any amount of money, you guys have gone waaaaay off the deep end.  No thanks.
---
Im amazed how people like you can do these mental gymnastics and not see how shit Bethesda is treating us
---
Why should Bethesda eat the cost of private servers simply because you pay playstation or xbox extra money to play online?  I am not saying people shouldn't be upset or happy, but direct your anger at your consol companies for charging you to use your internet not Bethesda for wanting to make money to pay for continued overhead.
---
If a title isn't profitable, eventually they will pull the plug on it, this makes the game more profitable and gives the game higher priority in development. So no, I'm not crazy to think that a game making more money, will make it more likely to have new content developed.
---
what the fuck its 15 euro a month here or 120 euro... thats like 140 dollars
---
You forgot about the limit to 7 people in the private server....thats why you can store more since there is not 20+ people running around and it doesn't need to track them all. Just you and seven other people
---
In the case of spotify since there is no such thing as advantage or compitition, it would be comparable to music that you would only have access to through premium
---
You're preaching to a brick wall here. Everyone left on this reddit are either just here for memes, or have downed the kool aid so hard they'd make Jim Jones proud.
---
Yeah, but then Bethesda would miss out on a revenue stream.....
---
But Eso is fair, it gives good content for the money you pay, Fallout 76 gives something that should have been available for free.
---
16 bucks in literally any other microtransaction service might take you somewhere, but the prices in the Atom Shop are so inflated that 1650 a month is barely anything.
---
People never wanted unlimited SCRAP, they wanted an infinite STASH.
---
The server space required to store scrap is easy.  There's 33 types of scrap and then the value associated with how many you have of each.  Simple.
---
But infinite stash space is different.  Then you're having to take into account the hundreds of types of junk and consumables and worst of all each and every individual piece of armor and weapon which individually have their own values for condition, level, mods and legendary effects.  That's a WHOLE LOT more server space to deal with.
---
It is. I don't know why are some people trying to pass it off as if it's actual armor with it's own stats when it's not
---
Already preloaded and waiting for the 25th.
---
I also uninstalled Fallout 76 and the Bethesda launcher and i dont plan on ever using it again.
---
Also dont forget Cyberpunk 2077 will have a multiplayer mode that will quench my multiplayer needs and its made by a company that wont try to nickel and dime me.
---
WHAT THE FUCK IS THIS SHIT
---
Yeah this can likely be an atom bundle in disguise if you cancel after a month. Just have to make sure of the items that are kept with the cancellation. The outfit is likely one of them.
---
&gt;Thank god the outer worlds releases tomorrow.
---
Amen good sir.  
---
Plus it'll only cost me $1 to play it on XGP.
---
They also said the Atomic Shop would be cosmetics only. They are changing their minds more and more
---
I know I just had a shower thought.
---
Because there is a serious lack of understanding that they're paying for additional real-world resources. Private servers are additional server time, and AWS doesn't just give that stuff away. I was fine with up to about ten bucks a month just for private servers, and it turns out I'll be paying less than that and getting more stuff thrown in. The separate junk stash is a dream bonus by itself, but also free atoms every month? For $8.33 a month I'm thrilled.
---
If a person doesn't want to subscribe, then...don't? It'll be the same game as it was before for that crowd. A game they apparently still enjoy enough to get angry about.
---
Yeah sure man a game I really like is going down the toilet :)
---
They did say increased camp size was coming to subs
---
Well the scrap box can be used on any world, private or not. But still, in a game that’s like 95% PVE I don’t see how being able to fast travel to one extra location for free, or having a box that can hold unlimited JUNK items only, are pay to win. Once again, it’s just convenience items imo
---
Can't you just farm those Atoms in normal play?
---
scrap stash and item stash are different 
---
10000 wood and 100 wood is still the same id number and would be counted as 1 item in a database
---
a 10mm pistol, 10mm auto pistol, legendary 10mm pistol and so on are all assigned their own unique id number and takes up a lot more room in a database. 
---
it won't stress the servers by storing the scrap as they all stack. that is why Unlimted scrap stash is not an issue.
---
They lied about an increased stash space which will cause performance issues.... or to be fair maybe and only maybe they found a workaround to increase the stash....but decides to charge us for it.
---
Everyone keeps saying it's pay2win, but can anyone explain to me what you are winning?
---
ehhh... I wind up bulking and selling a bunch of stuff when it comes to scrap honestly. It's just a few items that are harder to find or I use in large amounts that are the problems. Most common junk I don't bother picking up, but anything with plastic, adhesive or ballistic fiber is always needed.
---
A lot of times the biggest space sink I have is the aid category. Every so often I have to clear it out because I grab every aid item I come across, even if I've got 50 stimpacks in my stash already....
---
Buy it or dont.  Keep playing or dont.
---
The unlimited scrap is probably there due to the fact that it wasn't scrap that affected stability. It was the gigantic fuckload of duped weapons and armor that kept being made
---
Good for you! I would rather play with a stick and a rock.
---
Stash stays the same.  Scrap Box has unlimited storage for junk.  You would be unwise to store any type of junk in your stash if you pay for the service. Scrap Box transfers to public servers too.
---
Fallout $13
---
I think the idea is that because it's paywalled, only a percentage of the playerbase will have these scrap boxes. If only a percentage of the playerbase has these scrap boxes, it will affect servers less than if everybody had scrap boxes.
---
I guess the real test is to get 24 FO1st players on one server with millions of scrap and see what happens.
---
Name a video game developer that isn't greedy and is just making immersive, expansive games with unique worlds for the good of the world and wanting nothing in return for it? Maybe Rockstar, are their games free? I heard Outer Worlds is almost free, maybe just go play that? Please? Right now? Get off Reddit and do something else!!!
---
What’s the competition in an mmo? Nuclear winter is separate so pvp is off the table. Most PvM is not “winnable”. Whats the win in 76??
---
Wow, and to think I was looking forward to the npcs :/
---
900 hours of sucking Todd's dick lmfao
---
Wow, your  choice actually  included 76 ? 
---
Damn.
---
My hot take, I'm 270 and switched to shotguns from rifles. Shotgun meta used to be TSE. After the (double) nerf, many wrote shotguns off. I feel this was hasty, as I've found these weapons to excel at crowd control (due to cripple/stagger) medium-to-short range damage (using VATs) and facetanking (using Vampiric legendary effect.)  VATs will let us compensate for accuracy loss at range, and gives us a damage boost in the form of each pellet being counted as a separate critical hit. I can keep practically any mob on the ground with staggers and limb cripples using a non-legendary combat shotgun, thanks to Enforcer. Tanking is easily managed with vampiric legendaries, as each pellet triggers the regen effect. Additionally, each pellet has a chance to trigger "Four-Leaf Clover," meaning every other shot is a critical hit. Shotguns are my favorite utility weapon in PVE. As with all weapons, Bloody or Junkies builds can make Shotguns even better at what they do, but it's not necessary to enjoy the weapon. Now, for some caveats: personally? I'd avoid explosive or two-shot with shotguns. Explosive will spread any procs to you, and shotguns are a close-range weapon. Two-shot damage is superfluous on a per-pellet basis. I HIGHLY recommend leaving off barrel attachments for shotguns that you intend to use for medium range engagements; the damage drop-off at range is pretty intense, as you see from other posts here. I would also avoid using shotguns in PvP, as many people use perks which counteract what I feel is shotgun's greatest strength: crowd control.
---
60 bucks you spent a year ago... Well 120 for you cause youre not a smart person, but thats 60 for year one. Its a deal i say. Now its 100. So i guess you have to pay 200 now. Lol should just play on Xbox. Thats where the real fun happenz.
---
Same! I just got back in after more than half a year away. Rejoiced at 800 stash space. Same bugs I encountered are still there. This is reminding me why this game is a load of bullshit.
---
I mean for $13/month you get $16.50 worth of Atom. So the benefits literally do outweigh the cost
---
Haha, me to. Pre installed, now I await something I feel will be worth my free time.
---
Imagine thinking everybody has been begging for 15$ a month private worlds 🤡
---
You forget what sub you're on?
---
Awful comparison because we already paid full price. We paid that premium.
---
The Burrows and The Charleston Capitol are the only other interesting ones IMO, they only summon Glowing Ghouls though, I think.
---
We can't handle it until you stuff our pockets. Really shows how bullcrap that excuse was the whole time.
---
We got nuked by bethesda.
---
The tent should have been in the regular game.
---
Todays update was adding in private servers via a paid monthly subscription, but that subscription doesnt just give you private servers it also gives you scrap boxes where you can store infinite components and a survival tent which you can place down for a second free fast travel spot, these can also be used in public worlds too though, so if you pay money, you get a pretty considerable bonus to playing.  
---
Scrap boxes and tents should have been free quest related objects not behind a pay wall.
---
Xbox: JayLuh &lt;-
---
Never done it but i hear nuking fort defiance yields a lot of flora.
---
The base game is there if you want it.No one is forcing you to pay the monthly subscribtion.You act like bethesda just works for free and should kiss your boots while there at it
---
I expect so. They'll do that just to hook the "I'm never paying" crowd into paying a one off for the outfit. It'll be a nice bump in spending for them and it's easier to go back to your dealer once you've plucked up the courage to buy your first fix.
---
The mobile Elder Scrolls game is already out, and it's pretty bad. Entirely focused around time-gates and microtransactions.
---
I enjoy nuking vendor camps that have dozens of non legendary armor and weapons.
---
No! me!
---
the Ranger armor that they are giving to Fallout 1st members is not NCR. it is just ranger armor which was prewar.
---
Subscription service on THIS game? LOL
---
HAHAHAH
---
For those on XB doing that:
---
XB1:  AlpineYJ
---
Totally agree. The fact that ESO Plus gives you access to all the minor content updates is grand. But there has always been divison around the Crafting Bag. And then they went and made it so you couldn't change the colour of your items/clothing unless you were a paid sub. 
---
And then....they brought in loot boxes and locked the majority of the top tier "real-money" items behind a loot box system which was and is inherently unfair.
---
It's greed either way you look at it, I'm afraid
---
So people who spend more money can hold as much junk as they want and never have to worry about not having resources because their private worlds are an effortless two minutes away to get anything they could really want. Cool.
---
If you don't like it, don't buy it.  It's that simple.
---
Personally, I don't think $12/month is that bad. I play approximately an hour and a half to two hours every day (more on the weekends). The average movie also runs about an hour and a half to two hours. The cost in my area of seeing that movie in a theater is also around $12. So I would get an entire month of premium services for the same cost as going to see a movie a single time during that month.  Again, that doesn't sound unreasonable to me.
---
I paid $200 for the power helmet edition of this game. I defended this game from the get-go... and now here we are a year later. Let me list all of the ways we have been fucked over since before this update:
---
1. The power armor edition gave out the wrong bag.
---
2. The game was released as an absolute mess.
---
3. You guys tried to compensate for the wrong bag with 500 atoms, which could get me a fucking flower pot for my camp...
---
4. The “new” bags took nearly 6 months to get manufactured and to my house. By that time I already forgot I even had the damn helmet.
---
5. You guys begin adding pay-to-win items such as the repair kits and scrap kits. 
---
6. You guys add a refrigerator which gives people who buy it an advantage over others. Note: there is no possible way to earn this in-game, only through the atomic shop. 
---
7. You keep releasing buggy messes such as nuclear winter. All of the events are boring and any new content released is extremely repetitive and nothing feels really new.
---
Here we are one year later. Just when you think things couldn’t get any worse, the game that costed me $200 would now cost me $200 and a $12 monthly fee to get items that I would not otherwise get. Do you really expect me to pay $12 a month for something that I paid $200? Adding scrap boxes which can be brought into public servers is the most ignorant and selfish shit I have ever seen a game company do. You guys really are trying to suck out every last penny out of your true fans who really stuck up for this game. The people who are still here after one year of this horrid game being released, are getting shit on by having to pay more money. I am a huge fan of the fallout series, but I’m no longer a fan of Bethesda.
---
So finally a way to run a raid XD
---
"For a long time" lol youre just mad. Once ES6 comes out youll be creaming your panties over Bethesda again
---
a wee bit stoked actually
---
That scrap box should really be added for the public then. Damn dupers.
---
$12.99 a month to get 1650 atoms on top of the other perks as a bonus. I'm in.  I'll be spending less money monthly than I do now and get more out of it.
---
That said:  
---
Stop calling them private servers. They are not.  They are private instances.  
---
Private servers would be "24/7 on" where your friends could drop in and out whether you are there or not.
---
Don't allow the Megastash (I won't accept any other name) in public worlds.  I know i'm getting it as a perk, but that's for me and my private instance.  
---
Tents are fine in public worlds because they benefit anyone who comes across them.  They way I see it, it's more random stash points you can run into.
---
My understanding is it is designated servers and yes. But I may be ignorant. So please correct me if I’m wrong!
---
Yeah I also didn’t understand why they couldn’t have started it yesterday
---
The scrapbox that gives you unlimited storage space can be used in Public (Adventure) servers.
---
So, why exactly are you in this sub 10 months later?
---
Yeah, except I already paid for the apartment, and now the landlord is locking the building's amenities (which were promised under the original rental contract) unless I pay him extra. 
---
Also, just curious, why the real estate analogy?
---
The hero we need but don’t deserve.
---
.......i think you just proposed a challenge, buddy lol
---
Wow, look at Mr. Popular over here, with more than zero friends who play Fallout 76.
---
Congrats on forcing my hand with the ranger armor, you sonsabitches.
---
16 times the monetization 👍🏻
---
Like what the hell happend in the span of a year, Bethesda used to be my favorite game company
---
its not even dedicated server, if its not much trouble for you go and read the FAQ of the subscription and you will see what i mean.
---
Lmao " Xbox " why the heck would I buy a Xbox if my Hardware is already more powerfull than it?
---
I'm going to go out on a limb here and guess that you will never have a shot in hell at becoming the CEO of any company.
---
Fallout 76 is essentially a casino.....a skinner box........the idea is to keep players around long enough so that you can entice them to eventually spend. Right now Bethesda is doing a poor job of enticing players to stick around.
---
Great feedback 10/10
---
They already announced that wastelanders is delayed to Q1 2020, and I will gladly take you up on that bet, there is no way that wastelanders will be behind a paywall.
---
True.
---
What is winning really, the game is not set up really to be a competition between players, really the workshops are the only real player interaction and i have rarely ever see that. This is a single player game that has player interaction. When have u ever been on a server where the server shut down and said u lost because u didnt launch a nuke and kill the queen. Maybe im wrong if so please tell me because i dont see it any different.
---
It’s an mmo. Updates will keep happening just line ESO did. All will be well.  Hopefully lol.
---
I guess you should see yourself out of this sub then.
---
Its not about the money. Its about how we as consumers and fans are being treated. Learn to respect yourself a bit.
---
Well, I got the game half off, so I'd probably sub for one month, get all the solo play I want out of the game then park it.
---
See my other reply to your other comment
---
There will be a "bug" where everything gets deleted.
---
At this rate, offline mode subscription will cost about $19.99 monthly.
---
I make that in less than an hour, I’m happy to be part of the problem 👍
---
EA at least makes quality games now.
---
In my defense for the fridge and bot, I didnt realise they were the actual items when I brought them, I thought they were skins for the newly added bots and fridges, was only after i started playing and realised I only had the 1 option for them that I realized I didnt buy a skin but the actual unlock for them
---
They've stated that once you have unlocked it from the atomic shop, you get to keep it even after cancelling your subscription. I'm still pissed about the scrapbox though.
---
I mean realistically everyone talks about how useless the atom shop is. Especially when you get atoms in game.
---
It was literally never going to fund this project past the first year. Even if they added everything they could.
---
At least the game will be worked on this way. And maybe with a little more incentive now that it's an actual service they can make money on. Honestly I thought the game would be dropped immediately after wastelanders but at least this gives me hope that they might stay just for the money.
---
Technically any1 who bought the game paid for its development
---
If I can dilute a stimpack, surely I can dilute a game, right?
---
ESO+ you gets 100's of hours of DLC as well. 
---
Fuck Bethesda.
---
Fuck Todd Howard.
---
Not gonna lie, also pleasantly suprised that not only are we getting riot gear, but that it is area appropriate. That being said, it sucks that this isn't just in the atomic shop proper. I'm curious to see if you can keep it after a membership lapses.
---
Yes there is, you fucking cretin. Don't buy. If it doesn't sell well they'll take note of that.
---
&gt; why? Because I loved it 
---
This is the only problem I'm having with people on this sub currently. Some braindead idiots are blindly defending a completely broken game.
---
You paid for a fucking completed, fully working game, you did not pay to have a relationship with a game. Your feelings towards the game do not denote whether you "got your moneys worth". Not a single player has gotten their moneys worth, as the game does not work on basic and fundamental levels, and you paid for something that is supposed to fully work on every single level.
---
This is why Fallout 76 is not considered early access. The developers see this game as a AAA videogame and it's fucking disgusting.
---
In a AAA videogame on PS4, you cannot actually walk, or sprint properly without your character doing some half-ass sidestrafe which fucks aim up on guns.
---
I repeat: The movement in an AAA MMORPG is fundamentally bugged and has not been fixed in over 365 days.
---
Are you a narcissist, by any chance? Because "for making a fool out of yourself publicly for all to see" what? I audibly giggled at this. It reeks of arrogance.
---
Even if I did clairvoyantly "make a fool of myself", I wouldn't care. 
---
And, I am not the type of person to assume, but you're the guy who thinly veils his attempts at bashing 76 with silk paper, or sometimes not even.
---
I am completely sure I've offered you more argument than you have even bothered providing for me.
---
Instead of telling me to take a debate class, why don't you take one yourself, whatnot with all the strawman attacking and 76-bashing? I'd like to see you try being independent, instead of being a sheep.
---
That poor strawman. You killed him.
---
Illiterate? That's just great, my man. You did shrug away my points and go attack the strawman. You downplayed the definition of pay-to-win for your purposes;
---
And, here comes the donkey bridge into my next point, or more like notice;
---
I'm not going to respond to you anymore. For multiple times, I've offered you good points that you scrub away and then add your own completely random strawman point there.
---
You seem more invested in bashing 76 for whatever silly reason you can make up than responding to people who call you out for it.
---
And also more invested in unironically using "rofl". Are you even old enough for r/teenagers?
---
As someone waiting for private severs to get this game, this is not what I wanted. At this point it is obvious that the game will Never have mods or self hosted private servers. I guess they gotta make money, but it's so aggravating when the game is so close to what I would want, but they won't because they won't be able to monetize me.
---
"Gotta support the game bro"
---
This is the problem.  People like you stating it's not an advantage.  No matter how small, it is an advantage.  I said this when they brought out the Unstoppable outfits for atoms giving extra HP.  "But it's 10 HP! How is that an advantage?  That's not P2W."  It starts small.  Unnoticeable.   It really doesn't matter what you think because it is the definition of P2W, whether you think it is or not.
---
Honestly can’t believe people are still playing this piece of shit game
---
If I take the bait my stash gets at least a 100 pound boost!  You would be wise to also smelt all ore ASAP as that is listed as misc and not junk.
---
Todd is a slimy fucking liar.
---
Somehow this is the straw lol. How’s this surprising or shocking? Tbh I’ve got better things to worry about. Bethesda has been bitches for years now.. this ain’t new.
---
But it's not unlimited resources, only unlimited storage for what you've acquired. It will result in hoarding, but that's already been happening with muling.
---
Limiting the players to 7 probably has a lot to do with increased stash.
---
This is unprecedented. Not a single AAA game has released and continued on as terribly as this game has in YEARS. Stop making dumb excuses.
---
I would love infinite scrap. Just saying. 
---
I don't want to pay $15 for it though. That's insane.
---
I would love fortnite dances. Since almost all of them are taken from real life inspiration anyways.
---
It won't.
---
Haha. Good thinking, love it.
---
Ah, and now you just come in here to hone your edginess.
---
Back to runescape.
---
alright ima head out, see you in 4 years when $13 a month gets you anywhere near as much as it does in ESO
---
Cause youre a baby and you bought a ps4 and a pc. Why not? dont you wanna complete your collection?
---
Sorry I don't think thats it?
---
Doesn't seem like it's the *real* limiter when the infinite Scrap Stash is available in both public / private now.
---
It’s what they said if I understood them correctly
---
Sure bud whatever helps you feel better.
---
At least they aren't censoring the whole anti-China stuff within the game.. So I guess they are beating Blizzard on that front.
---
This is only an argument as a benefit if you already planned on spending $16.50 each month on Atoms? I’m sure that the vast majority of players don’t buy Atoms each month and they want the storage space and don’t care much for the atoms. Sure it helps if you’re a whale in a horribly launched MMORPG, but for the majority of the little player base that exists they don’t want to pour more money into the game.
---
L
---
IT WORKS ON BOTH LEARN TO READDDDDDD
---
"Weird how that works." It's almost as if different people are effected at different times and in different ways to what goes on with the structure of this game. That is weird isn't it.
---
It only holds crafting components not everything.  It is for paid “members” only and is on public and private servers
---
Actually I don't.  $12 is the price of a movie ticket, which would provide about 2 hours of entertainment.   I play at least 2 hour every day, so it actually seems pretty reasonable to me.
---
Same. Reached 325 last night. Been playing since beta and defended every move. This is too far
---
Unlimited stash space has nothing to do with amount of players / server since it is not tied to private servers
---
If my hypothesis is correct all game companies have turned into EA
---
You just asked in the title. Stating that now you have to pay 100 euro for it. 
---
No, you can still play publicly by yourself or with friends.
---
Soo... Yeah.... I could pay more money to Bethesda or I could wait 2 days and play Outer Worlds. Finish that then buy RD2 and milk that until Cyberpunk comes out and spend less than a 2 year subscription to Bugthesda. 
---
Just release the private worlds to the mod community, let them fix it, tweak it, mod it and get to work on playing fallout 1, remember what Fallout is all about and work on making Fallout 5.
---
It is accessible from everywhere. Public and private servers.
---
Not just that, but they proved today that they care more about money and the microtransactions than they do about making and sustaining a good game. They can't add new content because the teams are to focused on making Atom Shop Content.
---
Ah so you’re not winning if you have it. Someone having more junk than me does not effect my game in the slightest.
---
I paid 60 just like you i have gotten 700 hours out of this game,to me thats money well spent.
---
I agree with the private server part. Essentially people would pay to create their game for them. It’d be a win win.
---
Not nearly the same, but I'm afraid we won't convince each other here.
---
We will have to go with the old agree to disagree.
---
Yeah it’s for some people not for some others.
---
And it's not. Hard to consider this an MMO when there is so little to do end game. I consider this more of a co-op RPG.
---
From Bethesda:
---
&gt;Private worlds will continue to evolve with new features such as expanded building areas, increased C.A.M.P. budgets and Workshop persistence. We’ve also received a lot of questions about playing Fallout 76 with mods and this, too, is something we’re excited to add to private worlds in the future.
---
So yes, workshops will persist but not just yet. As for CAMPs, I don't think they've said one way or another.
---
The inner me wants to defend him... but I cant defend the actions this company has taken since release
---
They're making it really hard to regret spending €12 on a steam key for this game, and not a dime more. No atoms. I was actually enjoying it a few months back but got bored, couldn't be arsed launching a nuke and stopped playing. This shit sure as hell won't bring me back.
---
I managed to optimise GTA IV and EFLC on PC and am having a blast playing that old classic.
---
Can anyone tell me if the fast travel tent or crafting stash privileges are automatically removed when a membership ends?
---
most likely.  similar to how the accidental free items are.  it can be there, but you can never re-place it (and it would be cosmetic only)
---
You are constantly playing in public...
---
Aww...does it bother you when people like things you don't?
---
Bothers you so much you can't come up something better than a 12 year old?
---
I would feel sorry for those subscriber's whose characters wear the NRC Ranger Armour. The uniform immediately places a target on that character with many of the Fallout 76 community players feeling resentment and annoyance to those paying for the privilege and Bethesda breaking their commitment to the cosmetic only atom shop. This displeasure could sadly create further griefing, further tension or even damage the friendly atmosphere of the gaming world itself.
---
Did you know this is exactly how elder scrolls online works? Free players have to deal with component limits but ESO+ members get unlimited component storage. Also the same with the free Atom Points.
---
Yeah the junk stash should have been a free update. I get that unscrapped junk, ammo, aid items, notes, weapons and armor (with levels/mods/legendaries/wear), etc starts adding a lot more to track that could start to bog down the servers. But obviously scrapped junk isn't the same. At worst there's what, 66 values to hold (one for each base junk and it's bulked version)? Those are strict ints that can be changed with no change to the hit on the server performance. Obviously infinite storage is an issue for the servers or that would have been their premium service bonus, but it still feels cheap to include infinite junk as a premium exclusive when it's such a basic feature.
---
The whales will love this. Who spends that much on shitty worthless trash from the Atom store? oh wait a minute.....with the added game play changing items... oh i see.....Pay 2 win.
---
That's fair. I ain't as blessed money wise.
---
The salt is real
---
Pahahaha this game is such a fucking joke
---
Just let it die already.
---
1) there are NPCs
---
2) human NPCs are coming in q1 as a response to community feedback (a good thing) along with additional main quests, new weapons, etc
---
3) subscription is voluntary lol
---
Preach
---
Setting a great example for the type of whales they want to hit with the subscription service.
---
Do they give Ranger combat armor?
---
What 30? It's 100 Euro a year for me.
---
I read you could and emotes and icons too.
---
This is what I want to know. So if I server hop Fort Defiance for Norse uniforms, will I just get out back in the same world.
---
When a massive part of the game is looting and getting junk, having unlimited storage gives advantage to someone that doesn’t.
---
Except it's worse than a single player world, they aren't even persistent
---
I mean there's always the one random who wants the thing. People say n one wants to die but suicide is the leading cause of death in men below 50 in the US. It's called an expression ok?
---
I won't defend them anymore. I understand Bethesda needs to make money but offering unlimited stash and tents to paying customers is too much for me. The price is absurd too.
---
No no no. It was limited before they decided to charge for it. Now they got around that problem, but it requires a monthly $$ to work. That was how they "fixed" the issue.
---
Sucks to be you. I love Xbox.
---
Its a private instance hosted your end so if you leave the world or close the game then that instance goes away its basically the same as if you went into normal mode and was all on your own but instead of the system moving you to an instance with people it leaves you there till you leave.
---
Like every other business?
---
WORSE than, not worst than.
---
Each to their own mate :)
---
I found it a massive kick in the ball sack lol
---
In a PVE game?
---
You can absolutely argue its not p2w... There's nothing to win...
---
What is 88?
---
It's the private server thing they've said was going to happen since before launch. Not a huge deal.
---
I quit already after seeing the patch notes, and I'm Hodd Toward.
---
For the people that wanted to play the base game and not pay for cosmetics, this update fucks them. Those benefits being kept behind a paywall is offensive, they are too important for regular play not to be accessible to everyone who paid the original sticker price.
---
Oh man.. thats disgusting.. there is no content for end game.. no clans to communicate with others, no chat... nothing to keep me just some daily / weekly challeges with the same content over and over.. i was playing the game just to support it and now this? I quit... I don't know what Bethesda do with this game.. 
---
I would prefer to give 5 or 10 backs to pay for wastelanders update, than this..
---
Yup, it is official now. We all knew where things were going.
---
It's unlikely I make it to 2077, but I still hope so, tbh.
---
read the latest patch notes
---
There are so many flipping cry babies on this sub. Like seriously, do you wake up each morning to cry like a little baby on Reddit.
---
This is NOT PTW. 
---
"Zomg11111 player B has more steel than player A.v
---
Who cares!? There's no combat advantage. Period.  And let me remind you this is a co-op/PVE game, not a PVP based game. I think it's great that people have more access and storage capabilities when it comes to scrap. I mean the end game is killing the queen and I'd love for Johnnie next to me to have 30000 rounds to put in the queen. More power to him!  I'm a level 200 with 355 hours in and I've never ever had an issue (even when stash size was hundreds less than it is right now) with not having enough scrap to make as much ammo as I need or to repair any armor I need. If you say differently then you're absolutely lying. It's so easy to get scrap to get materials for ammo and for armor and weapon repair on an as needed basis. The unlimited scrap stash is more of a QOL addition more than anything.
---
Do I think this is the right time for releasing this right after delaying Wastelanders? No.  But if you use your simple minds, for the cost you're receiving a decent deal.  
---
But here's the kicker, and for you slower folks, I'll type slowly.  If you don't like a product, whether it be a videogame or a car, don't purchase it or continue to support it.  It's that simple.  Nobody cares on Reddit.
---
They are not allowing mods on the private servers now any more than in adventure.  Can we wait to get our panties in a bunch until something actually happens?
---
You know what I mean. You can take all your junk and put in your fancy scrap box freeing up room in your stash box etc point is you have unlimited crafting ability to mess the in game economy.
---
Clown
---
It's a damn fine song
---
The scrapbox is the first thing about this game that I'm genuinely pissed about.
---
IMO, the other non-cosmetic stuff they've been selling didn't give much. But the scrapbox? That truly is a pay-to-win item.
---
Ps. Im paying 100 up front for a year. You pay the extra if you want to a month. Im all in. This is the best thing to happen for fo76 and myself. Guess ill play woth myself more now! 
---
Totally  an innuendo
---
You paid towards initial investment, not ongoing. 
---
Wastelanders is pretty much an entirely new different game they are having to write, almost unrecognizable from the beta release. 
---
And as such no one is taking anything away from you or preventing you from never putting in a penny. You'll even get all the newly released content for free. 
---
This isn't for you, this is an added bonus to the people who are willing to support the game more, who don't mind investing in the game and the community.
---
lmao
---
It is an overall cost reduction in theory. Makes u feel like you are getting something "free" Box Cereal $3 - buy one get 1 free = $1.50/box
---
If they don't invest it back into the game the least they should do is put it into making a new creation engine instead of the existing one they've used for a f#$king dark age
---
All I know is this'll make crafting specific guns to scrap them to learn their mods (like the Handmade or the Ultracite Laser Rifle) *much* easier now
---
Constantly fighting either trolls, griefers, or legendary one-shotters will be a nice change or pace.
---
And just like that, Fallout fans became The Outer Worlds fans
---
A paywall **Behind** a paywall Bethesda leading the industry in new ways
---
Its €120 for me(Ireland) which equates to $133
---
Private servers can only have up to 8 people. Public servers have 24+.
---
 That's a huge difference
---
If you spam the loot button immediately upon looking at their dead body you can loot them before the inventory empties. I’ve also had luck looting them by waiting 30 seconds or so and swinging my crosshairs on and off the body.
---
I'm with you, but also big oof.
---
&gt; You could see FO76 had a lot of developers put their hearts into it 
---
Really? Because I still can't fucking walk or sprint on PS4 properly. 
---
&gt;  bullshit subscription is gone 
---
That's not how Bethesda works buddy, I figure we'd have got some fixes to the game by now if they cared what you, or I thought.
---
This is not new what do you think the creation kit was made for? The fact that you can see whats in a container without opening it was a mod, the faster power armor animation when in combat also a mod, real time vats lmfao also a mod every improvement they have ever made was stolen from some poor mod maker.
---
It won't fix it, but hey, you can reconnect to games so you don't lost your workshops! Just pay a little more money!
---
&gt; But you can for sure stand in a public place in America and shout all the racist slurs you can think of as loud as you can.
---
You cannot, you will be arrested for disturbing the peace and possibly incitement. This is the point I'm making, if you get away with that in America, it's because no one called a cop who was willing to enforce it. People yelling racist things in public get arrested every day. As long as they're homeless and not political leaders, that is. 
---
&gt;You can burn as many crosses as you like too as far as I know. You're example is illegal because it is on someone else's property.
---
No, I meant that literally. The Supreme Court [decided a case](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virginia_v._Black) saying it was illegal to burn the cross on your own private property, not someone elses. Because as long as it was visible, it was an intent to threaten, which meant it wasn't protected. 
---
&gt;In Germany for example (and several others) its strait up illegal to hang Nazi symbols or even historic pieces like flags or uniforms outside of a museum setting.
---
I mean, hang a flag celebrating 9/11 or claiming death to America outside your window, and see how long your free speech lasts. You might have a court marginally protect you, but I doubt the police would.
---
&gt;There are no statues of Hitler in Europe anymore, yet everytime a statue of a Confederate traitor general is threatened to be moved out of a public venue (not even destroyed) there is a litteral freakimg riot
---
There's thousands of statues that have been taken down quietly, it's mostly just in conservative areas that idolize the south that they defend it, as a proxy for defending their own racism. Which isn't a free speech matter as that's not the government censoring citizens, but deciding what public figures to honor. The government could impose a rule saying they will never put up a statue of a Confederate on public lands, and it wouldn't be a suppression of free speech. Banning private speech, and being entitled to government endorsement of it, are different things.
---
The whole community is a brick wall sorry y'all complaining about shit that's not P2W
---
I for one am excited about Fallout 1st. For the money, it's worth it for me and my wife. We have always wanted to Co-op FO4 and now we will be able to get pretty close. We've enjoyed playing in Adventure and overcame our fear of playing online, largely due to the community. But, we also like to build camps/settlements, mod the game and take on the wasteland together. Plus, it would cost you about $160 a year just to get the 1650 atoms a month. So, $99/year is a deal. I'm sure many will disagree... But, I think that Bethesda has to charge for Private Servers. It cost them money to maintain them, update them, provide them with electricity in direct costs and man-hours. If they continue to improve and add new features to the game, that means they have to do testing on both public and private servers. Especially when MODS are introduced. I know, "Why can't we have our own local servers". Well, that would slow down any chance of Bethesda ever getting a handle on QC and could make the game worse when you start using MODS. Also, we have asked for this. You probably wanted it for free. But, that's not how the world works. Products and services have costs to them.
---
so you're fucking off, is that what you're saying? ;-)
---
Must be exciting being you
---
The scrap box is on all servers I believe.
---
Unless I’m confused about something I believe EDT is equal to EST
---
Ohh  I see okay so we're both in agreement that buying it would be bad, that's great.
---
This has been implemented with high priority and with most tests, to make sure it will work better and more reliable than anything else in the game.
---
Just guessing...
---
Exactly thieves
---
Pete Hines' johnson
---
Bethesda apparently confirmed. It works like the eso membership. So you could just buy 1 month and get the NCR outfit etc and just hoard junk inside the box so when it runs out you have a stockpile
---
Oh. I didn't know this. That is bad, but what if the person on has 88 in there name because they were born that year and were unaware like I was?
---
That is true. I just find it that, after an entire year of them saying "no pay to win or advantages with money", they add this. Again, you're right about it not affecting other people, but it's still kind of.. scummish? And this money is going to just fill their greedy desires anyway, so I dont really see the reason why anyone should support it. It's like capitalism, you're absolutely right.
---
I tend to ignore most of the shit bethesda does, but damn did they fuck up this time.
---
It's like they're fueled by controversy! Whenever you think they'll make the right move, the do the exact opposite......unfortunately
---
Hold up is this real? Why the fuck would I pay a subscription to a game I already fucking bought? 
---
How is this not giving pay to win 
---
Oi Todd you fucking kretin
---
Absolute money grabbing little shits
---
Club membership is different from atom shop.
---
&gt; Buried with Honor: The Grafton Mayor’s introductory dialogue for the Buried with Honor Daily Quest no longer plays every time a player logs in.
---
I would have paid $13 a month just for this.
---
If it doesn't sell well, you know they will come up with something.
---
MMOs should always have player votes updates. Idk why more companies haven’t thought of this.
---
Then stop your shitty ass crying about shit that's not even remotely P2W
---
They are likely chasing after Chinese investment for their Mobile games. Someone mentioned in an Article that they are trying to convince a potential buyer that they are worth investing in, hence all the Games as a Service approach and the mobile gaming they started shoving.
---
At least ESO is a MMO with content... but yeah this is a massive facepalm moment.
---
Just when I thought you guys couldn't fuck me anymore than you have, you flip me over into a new position and keep on chugging.
---
P2W = Pay to Work
---
Ok sorry I obvs didn't read it properly, doh.  It's strange it doesn't show when crafting for you. I had the arms left for that badge and as soon as I learnt the plan I crafted the pieces straight away and got the badge.  Hope it gets fixed for you.
---
Nope, it's one thing to not like a game and it's another to follow the subreddit every day to bitch about the next big thing everyone is bitching about.
---
Maybe it's only available on the private server with limited playable slots.
---
I hope people take this is as a slap in the face and their server numbers drop more than they already have. Like I said in the other thread, this is entirely to get people to pay again, not play again.
---
Free Hat?
---
What does it matter if they are robot or human? Lol
---
Well considering I play Fallout everyday and don’t use Amazon, it’s an easy decision.
---
You do realize that those are features of the private server, not to be bought in the atom shop, right?
---
You have no idea.
---
because $8 a month for a fake currency that you weren't going to (hopefully) buy anyways sounds like a great deal, Im sure.
---
I didn’t know Bethesda used furries as marketing
---
Why would anyone pay even more for an unstable private server? 
---
I also feel like veteran players that have been there since day one and especially the ones who bought the Collectors Power Helmet Edition should get this free or at a deep discount.
---
That's people for you.  No consistency.
---
Comedians are funny when they make fun of other people's pain points, but when they hit mine it's a problem.
---
It's OK for the politician on my side to do this bad thing, but when the other side does it it's a problem.
---
It's OK for my religion to have his bad side to it, but if someone else's has that too, theirs is false.
---
People are like that in general.
---
You can boycott but there will always be people playing this game
---
wowz that's big
---
Morgantown is interesting to nuke.  Lots of unexpected flora and it buffs all the events in Morgantown to nuke zone levels.  Nuked Back on the Beat with a full crew of 4 is pretty fun.
---
Im just saying nobody forcing you to pay for it the main game is still there,but bethesda still has to make money to keep it alive
---
Lemme help you out. I'll subscribe so you can stay away from this awful piece of shit game. Thank me later
---
Bethesda Brass: So how are they reacting to Fallout 1st?
---
Bethesda PR: They are... responding overwhelmingly, sir.
---
Bethesda Brass: Excellent!
---
Im expecting the delay to wastelanders to be becuase they are trying to cut up the DLC in a way that they can charge for most of it.
---
&gt;make up the cost of paying the $16 a month
---
You realise you're paying Bethesda while asking them to pirate their games? Holy shit something needs to happen to the Human Race.
---
You're paying for access to a private version of their server. A server they still have to host and pay for.
---
"It's just a joke, bro!" That is the lamest fucking excuse for these assholes. Read a book.
---
For $60 one could buy a real tent.
---
Oh my bad if that's the case then.
---
 I just assumed they were on private only.
---
Eastern Daylight Time vs Eastern Standard Time. Anyway I’ll assume you are EDT and see you at 3pm. What platform?
---
So this is finally it, eh? Bethesda has finally pulled some shit I just can't abide by. Putting our much requested, base game aspect, additional stash space behind a $100/yr paywall. 
---
This is the first thing they've done that's made me actually livid. And it's a shame since all the rest of the updates sound great. I'll be spending the next couple of days deciding whether I'm uninstalling this game or not.
---
Actually though you are kinda right (I'm 18 for a reference) I remember them being big on YouTube and whatnot but never actually to me or my friends because none of us played PC at the time
---
Will the elite riot gear be available in the initial bundle?
---
You can literally take every single power station and have mass fusion cores being made without worrying about defending the workshops, while also having ammo made at the ammo depot. 
---
If you look at end game trading ammo is the currency people use. This private server literally lets them afk farm ammo for hours without doing anything. That is a massive advantage.
---
I get that, I’m stoked going forward because there will be more actual game play but I like the building as well.
---
Yep. Adds are a gift from the lord, especially since I run encryptid at full health and want that adrenaline boost
---
It's sad because I genuinely enjoy aspects of the game but I no longer want to support these joke ass people
---
Does that mean I can sue Bethesda over it, or is posting to Reddit make it an unsolicited idea?
---
&gt; 76 is lonely enough as it is, never mind private server bullshit.
---
The thing is, I came up with a few suggestion as to why people might want a private server, but the 8 player (including yourself) limit has killed most of that potential (roleplay servers, PvP servers ect...)  
---
And the fact you can bend any of the rules has broken the other uses I came up with like having only high level enemies ect...  
---
So now the only benefits I can really see is youtubers who wanna make videos on lore or something without being harrassed constantly
---
Nah the subscription bonuses apply to all servers.
---
So my wife and I would have to pay 30.00 a month to share a server?  WTF....hard pass
---
"unlimited crafting component storage"
---
For anyone saying its a server thing this entire time, I am sorry but you were wrong. They learned this one from ESO.
---
Bethesda headquarter
---
More junk means less time grinding for junk in which case you win by simply being in a private server letting the workshops do their bidding. All that extra junk means more ammo. More ammo means more time actually killing higher level areas. Yes you are paying to win.
---
I would think that this wouldn't be taken so badly if they didn't start out with "no pay to win MTX cosmetic only" and proceeded to sell everything the community suggested or wanted back to them for atoms.
---
That along with the lack of mods (and the very likely chance that they will be creation club mods rather than true mods when/if they ever turn up) along with the 8 player max on private servers and let's not forget the unlimited storage which we were assured that they couldn't increase any more than they did and then this comes along of course they can do it if you pay 100$ a year.
---
the whole thing stinks of money-grubbing this isn't about making enough to keep the game going its about making enough to make the investors happy that they made more this quarter than they did last quarter.
---
When/if people swallow this what comes next I wonder what method of separating the whales and the money comes next?
---
EVERYONE SHUT UP IT COST THEM TIME TO GIVE US WHAT WE ASK FOR AND EVERYTHING HAS A PRICE NOTHING IS FREE ALL YOU PEOPLE DO IS COMPLAIN THEY ARE TRYING THERE TRYING TO MAKE THIS GAME GOOD THEY DONT HAVE TO DO ANY OF THIS
---
Same here. I've tried tike 15 times so far. Tried 3 times at 12:00
---
I have been quiet all the way through on items they added to this game, but this is getting to a point in gaming where AAA games are just out of hand and for crappy games with little content they feel like they can keep asking for money with little to none effort put into it.
---
1st was the repair kits... hey it is just a small item that allows you to repair weapons on the fly, but we also added a way to earn in game. Only reason i even do the SBQ anymore is for the repair kit. People seem to not figure out how to do sheepsquatche imposter efficiantly enough to be able to just keep doing it over and over.
---
2nd was scrap kit, basic little tool to allow you to bypass having to find a stash box, and safly srap items in inventory and store for a fee. I was annoyed but also kinda saw them as a useless type item.
---
3rd was Scrap bot and the Fridge, Fridge was only small benefit as perks kept items in inventory good for longer anyways, and the scrap bot was nice for some idle junk collection, noticed they were P2W features, not major or game breaking as you could earn those out if you wished.
---
But **NOW** they have finally released something that people have been asking for and Bethesda Promised since before launch almost a year later, they announce they will be adding the Private Servers, and first thing i noticed was how they said it in first place, "for those that paid for this service", my heart sank as i knew exactly what that meant, bethesda wasnt gonna deliver any descent future update without making users drain wallets.
---
I bought the stairs, the vault stairs, and i am still pissed about it, as i originally saw them when i was saving atoms for a power armor skin and got excited and bought them. As soon i went to stack them i saw how much of it was nothing but a asset flip, they didnt even bother making sure they lined up with anything else in the camp. They Clip through walls and they dont line up on the bottom or the top to make them truly look good, 500 atoms from me but that was $5 usd for those that actually paid for them, and bethesda couldnt be bothered with nothing more than a basic auto responce when i sent in a report on them being broken.
---
When will they actually add something worth while without asking for money, who knows, but i know this in last week since announcement of Wastelanders being postponed again, 3/4 people i played with have moved onto other games, and i am trying to stay on FO76 but every day i have less and less reasons to play.
---
Yeah that's because you are buying those benefits. The backlash is from people who choose not to on principle or can't afford to buy them.
---
Sounds like a commie living in a capitalist world proclaiming intent to break the law because the system won't bend their way.
---
How much did you pay retail for the game? How many hours have you spent playing it? If you have not gotten your monies worth, exactly how LOW do you value your time?
---
Who stores most scrap?  Scrap is everywhere and aside from a few rarer pieces can be collected on an as needed basis by killing a few enemies or picking stuff up off the ground, stash space is better put to use holding onto stuff like legendary armor and weapons you aren't currently using but have effects you can't pass up.
---
They aren’t making shit good lmao
---
No wonder the game went down to 15 dollars on Amazon. can't believe I bought it for my brother to play it today.
---
yeah with food buffs and nukashine and drugs it good be a godly weapon to use
---
You mean you actually got the atoms? Mine wouldn’t update so I lost out on 30
---
&gt;so how do we expect Bethesda to pay for all of these new features?
---
I expect for them to charge for cosmetic stuff only.  You know, because before they released the game that's what they said they would do.  Saying one thing then changing it later is bait and switch.
---
Yeah f the bag lol
---
From the article they put out seems not at launch, but down the line we'll get bigger budget and persistent workshops.
---
Yeah I thought this would make me angry but I'm cool with it. Hope it gets support and allows the game to grow.
---
Is it? Isn't WOW $15 a month?
---
I posted about that not long after BETA but I'm sure I wasn't the only one, steal fan ideas and sell it back to them 
---
What a great fucking business model, IM SUURRREE it won't piss off what little loyal fans are left/s
---
This whole subscription shit is fucking bullshit corporate cockwomblery 
---
No Todd it just doesnt work
---
Nobody forces you to buy it, but the non-sub game is objectively worse now that we know the stash limit will never be fixed. Plus it sux to pay full price for a game expecting it to receive updates and fixes in the future, only to learn later that to you need to pay even more if you want those fixes.
---
[I'll just leave this here](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/cr8h7f/pioneer_scout_squirrel_level_backpack_mod_concept/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share)
---
Who said I was buying $16 a month on atoms? $5 500 atom purchases with the occasional $10 one once in a great while =/= $16.50 a month. Lol. Idiots automatically assuming people buy large priced options without checking before speaking. 
---
And for the millionth time, something you lot don't seem to understand, its not the ATOMS that are the problem. Its the UTILITY behind a paywall that is. Unlimited scrap is gonna wreck the in game economy. But sure its totally a "bUt....BuT....dA aToMs!" reason for complaints. 🙄
---
this is your fault for still playing this game
---
if the game were empty, they'd work on making something better
---
So.....
---
How is it pay to win..... If the "p2w" stuff can only be used in private servers?
---
Wont make a dent. Instead i propose to just stop playing the game altogether and never return.  
---
I fear for ES6 and Fallout 5 to be honest.
---
👍
---
That's disgusting. 2 things we have been asking for for about a year and this is how they are going to implement it?! Fuck that. That's some greedy ass shit.
---
I was at a workshop i took the high cap backpack makes u squishier and not if ur guns were already in that box
---
Oh noooo, I'll rethink my horrible ways, guy who uses emoticons in every reply.
---
If you're mad at Bethesda, uninstall the game, the launcher and **stop giving them money.** That's the only thing they'll listen to.
---
Clearly enough people are paying for this shit to make it worthwhile. If we stop, Bethesda will retreat.
---
**Boycott Bethesda now.** They're turning into EA and the writing has been on the wall forever.
---
I've been spending about $13 a month on atom bonus packages now I get even more atoms more cosmetics and private server access for that price? 😁 I'm all kinds of happy!
---
15... a month! That's what's the most insane part to me
---
Yeah I’m done with this game now. Wastelanders could be incredible but this is insane.
---
They are trying they don’t have to do anything to spilled brat
---
&gt;buying a atom bundle for a outfit 
---
Not scummy 
---
Making you buy subscriptions for classic outfits that would get anyone who liked that game by the balls 
---
Scummy.
---
We are a year in and the updates have been lame. ESO had Craglorn by this point, an entire map of endgame content, with quests, dungeons and trials. We got grindy backpacks and alcohol crafting.
---
Canada the price is 20$ here with tax included. The cosmetics and emotes aren't even worth 1$ since it doesn't cost them so much to make and Atom's also don't loose them anymoney... so their pocketing at least half if not more of the membership fees.
---
Lmfao me neither i got 3 copies for less than $50
---
I think you are missing the point. They need to make money to keep the game running. They make new story, weapons, armor, events, and missions available for free and charge for all the extra frills. 
---
So far everything they charge for is either cosmetic or meant to reduce the daily grind. Nothing that would give one player over another a direct advantage in PVP. If they gave all that away for free, then how would they make money?
---
As soon as you get home from Bethesda HQ?
---
im most concerned about server stabilty taking a shit once they let these people with unlimited stash into PUBLIC servers
---
Congratulations To BSW on "How to Kill a Franchise"!  BTW How's Fallout 5 coming along?  &lt;snort&gt;
---
im just happy for private servers tbh lol
---
And yet you still have a competitive advantage as a pve with private servers. Before if you needed more steal or lead or whatever you needed to raid. Now you don't. Now you just sit there and let all the workshops do that job for you. Its pve with indulgence. Glutton junks like you allow this.
---
You’re very clever. I bet you make all the kids in class laugh.
---
Yeah, they need to remove regional pricing for me to at least consider buying into this membership stuff.
---
I agree
---
They did. The initial limitations were to give the game a real “survival” experience. It was in one of their panel interviews.
---
Both of those should be in the atom store and obtainable via challenges / atom accrual in-game.
---
To be honest I feel the prices are fair for this service. If I remember correctly private servers for Battlefield 3/4 were more expensive when they were released and they are still running to this day.
---
Why even keep playing? I stopped after 2 months of playing, Repetitive and not very enjoyable. played from March- April. I dont know why people even give this time of day anymore.
---
I hope they learn some shit
---
Free private sessions would’ve brought so many players back. Bethesda instead decided to nuke the franchise for immersion’s sake
---
What's a WoW sub?  Don't they charge about the same?
---
Fantastic job! I snagged 'em both because that's just about the coolest thing I've seen in a long while.
---
Just based on the name alone "Fallout 1st" seems like a political spoof off "America First". Seem like this was meant to be a partial joke of a membership. Thought last I checked it's not April 1st.
---
"Would you like to know more?" - Starship Troopers voice
---
I'm confused though. So it's 1650 atoms but they also give you 1650 atoms a month? Do we only have to pay the one time and it will be free after that?
---
12.99 optional private server hosting fee you mean?
---
How about unlimited stash and scrip and caps. Thats what this whole game is about now. Get as many legendarys you can scprip them, stash the ones you cant can't turn in because of the cap or sell them to a vendor or player. Then go to the purveyor get shit and do the cycle again.
---
Anthem.
---
Its almost like Bethesda just wants money and doesn't give a shit.
---
That’s fair!
---
"Pubic servers" sound interesting... just sayin'
---
I think it's poetic
---
yeah i kinda frown on that being a member perk but...i wanted the private world myself anyways soo nice bonus i guess lol.
---
Given this days patch notes I might be crediting them too much for anything...
---
Ok deal. Lol. Notice u didn't say you were happy with your ps4... Typical ps4 user problem.
---
Regardless of whatever opinion someone has of the latest move and regardless if a player subscribes or not, there's nothing to be gained from players turning on each other. Yes, you could argue that Bethesda made the fire, but if we turn on each other for whatever choices players are making, then it's us lighting the match. Whatever someone chooses to do - or not do -  with their money is their choice at the end of the day.
---
Sadly, there's already signs that this has already started happening and the servers aren't even back online yet.
---
12,99€ for both
---
So then you're saying that the people complaining about it will ruin the game?
---
Had this game since the beginning, stopped playing it about 2 months ago. Been playing No Man's Sky, until Outer Worlds comes out. I'm probably done with F76
---
I popped some mentats beforehand
---
it really sucks because i actually like the idea of an elder scrolls dungeon crawler, but the monetization is some of the most obnoxious ive ever seen
---
What servers have you been paying for that only allow 8 people total and boot all secondary players off the second the paid member leaves for $100?
---
Nope, you get the Definition wrong :). MMO stands for Massively Multiplayer Online thats correct, but Massively just describes that it can be played by Thousands of Players Online, which Fo76 can be. The Massively doesn't refer to the Server Capacity ;)
---
Not deceptive at all. This is a completely separate service. The value is actually good. The number of people you can have in a server is the only let down.
---
Well they did drop a bomb of sorts
---
i'm excited about the legendary scorch beast and more events.
---
Haven't played in months but because i'm voicing my views and saying i'm finally uninstalling means i'm playing the game? Ok. Makes sense.
---
I think they implemented that with limiting the private server to 7 other friends, instead of lobbies with 24 ish people, so it cuts down on server stability. Least, that's what it sounds like
---
youre buying a private server. private servers cost money in every game thats ever had them.
---
It is a basic feature Are you mad? Call of duty, gta, minecraft, stardew valley, Star Wars BF originals and reboots, terraria, world war z. None of these have premium sub for private servers or worlds.
---
WoW is a lot more expensive than $100 per year.. 
---
Base WoW sub is $15 a month which is $180 per year.
---
It doesnt need to be said its just something you can assume if you have a functioning braun
---
But it works on private and public
---
That just sounds like someone not taking proper precautions when taking a workshop. Also how many heavy guns do you need? Really just sounds like you need better inventory management
---
No new features mostly stolen from mod makers, mostly retextures with mods we could make ourself, most of this game we have already paid for when we bought skyrim then again when we got fallout 4.
---
The 8 player limit doesn't make sense to me either. Why did they decide to have a lower player limit for private servers?
---
This will limit RP potential and how many players can participate in planned events.
---
Persistent and private have different meanings. All the word private indicates is just that, private.
---
#The Scrapbox is exclusive to Fallout 1st members and can be used in both public and private worlds.
---
Which means the "technical limitations" that they said limited our stash size was a complete and utter lie.
---
I was Never good at English so meh
---
Pretty sure yongyea is gonna make a video on this. Discussing the incompetency of the people working at Bethesda.
---
you get a private server too.  im gonna try it out for a month or so since the game itself is on sale :-p honestly just wanted to be able to play it "offline" so close enough lol
---
I mean I was, but later I found out that PC is a thing so.
---
then, if this is true, why didnt they do this for EVERYONE? not just people who will pay $100 a year?
---
I'm pretty sure it would be anything with Bloodied, Stronger Power Attack, and +1 Strength.  Some of the higher tier weapons would be either a super sledge or Grognak's Axe.
---
You mean an optional private server hosting fee?
---
and mole day
---
I'm sure he's a great person privately but he's been called out so many times and his lies don't seem to end. That's slimy if anything.
---
Yup, this one is a troll folks
---
Just based on the name alone "Fallout 1st" seems like a political spoof off "America First". Seem like this was meant to be a partial joke of a membership.
---
That's like half their player base at this rate.
---
ill take the private worlds thank you
---
Now now, no point in reason and logic in here today....
---
It honestly seems like it would make gameplay more boring. I enjoy having to go out and scavenge scrap. If I can have unlimited there’s no reason to go out. Sometimes it’s a different bit of scenery that brings life back to the game. Other than the 7 or 8 locations on the main Legendaries runs.
---
Yeah, stuff like microtransactions, and paid subscription for stuff promised at E3. Incredible job
---
Dupers will buy that shit and since you can use scrap container in public world, they probably cause disconnects constantly. Also, non dupers can hoeard scrap legit and basicaly become billionairs and fuck up the market which basicaly is the whole endgame for non pvp players. Good new is that when Red ded and cyberpunkl launches, nobody will play fallout76 anymore so nothing to worry about afterall.
---
Context: Riley Reid is presently having a special.  For $99, you get access to her private Snapchat content for life.
---
I’m not gonna lie 76 does feel like a side project
---
It's not the fact you're paying for convenience, its the fact we got lied to once with the fridge and the scrap bot (they are both 500 atom, mega easy to get) but now you have an actual Pay To Win cycle in the game.
---
Oh shit sorry braun is the Word for brown in germany and my phone has Auto correct on. You guys are really superior to me
---
I'm not to interested in those features either, but just because they have no value to me doesn't mean it wont to others. They offer a lot for the price. For anyone who regularly buys atoms or enjoys playing in groups, I imagine they will get a lot out of it.
---
It sounds like your just upset they didn't come out with something that is directly targeted at you.
---
Well last picture is a bundle, but haven't seen anything on what's included in it, sorry!
---
Do it. Paying for this or even playing shows that you're okay with this, and everything they've done in the past. Go.
---
A subscription would be fine, if it was tied to the private servers. But locking gameplay elements behind it reeks of greed. Or desperation...
---
This is what happens when people start making threads where they say that they will "Gladly pay some Atoms" for quality of life updates.
---
You reap what you sow ladies and gents, Bethesda really making it difficult to actually enjoy this game.
---
Again... no human NPCs. And f you want human NPCs there are literally 23 of them in every game and they are constantly changing. 
---
If you want AI human NPCs because you really need them, they are coming lol. So why are you still complaining. Also if you haven’t played in a year, you’ve missed out on a lot.
---
I never mentioned anything about expecting Private servers to be free though?
---
If you'd like, i can point you in the right direction and help you build a gaming PC. With free multiplayer, the ability to build a PC cheaper than buying a new console, steam sales, and all the other benefits... You'd definitely save more money in the long run.
---
Yea. And guess what else? They didn’t lock basic shit behind a pay wall. Bethesda is far more greedy then any of these guys
---
That's right.  Functions just like it does in ESO.  If your subscription expires you can no longer add items but you can use any items already in the scrap box.
---
I will pay for the subscription once cross platform play is enabled. I just want to play with my friend who is on PS4.
---
This isn't even good NCR ranger armor!
---
They didn't say free DLC forever or all DLC realeases though......
---
If you haven't played in months then why are you in this thread? The title says "stop playing". You already stopped playing.
---
That's been proven false, multiple times on this sub as well.
---
Boycott.
---
Yeah, there was a lot
---
who knows, i can't afford it so I'm not getting it. though with the way the servers work i wouldn't be surprised if that was a thing
---
Eh, yes and no?
---
Storing stash by weight instead of item slots (like other games' bank systems) obfuscates things.  "Lead: 2,430 Pieces" costs a heck of a lot less in server resources to tally than "Combat Rifle, Level 35, Long Barrel, Hardened Receiver, Medium Recon Sight, Stinging Magazine, Bruising Stock, Silcencer, Highland Tartan Skin, 53% Item Condition, 127 Maximum Item Condition, blah blah blah"  Most players above middling levels will have at least some of all scrap types.  Doesn't cost any more server resources to store "Ultracite: 53 Pieces" than "Ultracite: 1337 Pieces."  So letting players store more scrap, by itself, costs nothing on the server side.
---
But it does lead to people storing more complex items in their stash, as they replace that "Steel: 1137 Pieces" with a weapon with 17 different variables.  I agree that has unfortunate implications for the previous Bethesda party line on stash limits and server space.  Kind of makes me wish they'd store by slot count (with a materials stack system for identical items and ammo) instead of weight.  But I guess hiding the true accounting by weight allows for easier average usage and number juggling behind the scenes.
---
Worse? No, getting close? Yes
---
Jesus fucking Christ Bethesda...
---
Fucking duh. I've said this for a long time but got shut down every time.
---
People defending this by saying "WoW and other MMOs have expensive subscriptions too!" have lost it. The most successful MMO of all time and biggest trainwreck of 2018 are not equivalent.  
---
Fallout 76 still hasn't even justified its original $60 price tag for a significant percentage of the people who bought it (possibly the majority!), and Bethesda continuing to find new ways to take our money for a mess they still haven't fixed is insulting.   
---
I'm terrified of what Starfield and TES:VI will look like at this point.
---
It is just bizarre. I literaly have no words, and I am pretty fucknig talkative person. Payed sub. For Fallout 76. I am just... wait, what?... is this all real?...
---
No I’m with you. I buy a lot of Atoms and it’s still been cheaper than buying a new game every few weeks. I’ve played 76 for a whole year and not even played another game so I’ve got my money’s worth. I usually buy a game every couple of weeks, complete it and move onto the next game. I’ve saved a fortune this year. It’s not like you’ve got to buy it every month and I’m guessing that’s what Bethesda ate expecting, one time purchases to get the outfit, stash and rent.
---
I feel really bad for you. You deserve better than being manipulated into spending money on a sub par game every month
---
If they give people everything they ask for for free, then how would they make any money?
---
I recently moved all of my top-teir weapons from my stashbox to my character to make room for bobbleheads, mags &amp; junk.
---
I equipped 5 pieces of WWR armor, as well as bear arms-- the game ran like absolute garbage. It also affected players around me while fighing the queen. This never occured with them in my stashbox.
---
But that was gonna be a thing with private servers anyway.
---
I thought they said unlimited scrap storage was a server limitation and they couldn’t implement it...guess not.
---
Gee, it's almost as if the fans who want to support the game matter more to Bethesda than the freeloaders who don't. Who'd a thought?
---
You got it wrong.
---
if you don't sub, $0=0 atoms, if you sub $13=1650 atom.
---
I'll never badmouth Bethesda again if they give me tools to play this game on a Rust-like server. I want this game to feel like it has consequences beyond taking 4 shots to kill scorchers with my max rifle build. I thought that's what survival was gonna be but I was dead wrong.
---
Yeah, I got that issue and made a post on it too.
---
Because EU doesn’t pay enough for nato membership. We have to compensate that. On a more serious note it’s either tax related or a blatant ripoff
---
Are they giving away the Nuka Cola Cherry paints like with F4?
---
And not just in private servers! They say it carries over to the adventure servers. You know. The ones that can't handle it. It just works!
---
They broke with expectations.
---
If you properly announce these plans and do not conceal intentions, it probably would have been fine.
---
People just don't like to be lied to, except apparently you.
---
Incorrect, not unlimited stash space but junk space, still dumb they don't give unlimited space though especially with weight of those stimpacks lol. Don't worry its still not pay to win as just makes life easy now that I can take all the junk from alts and store in a box.
---
I get the hate, but I’m down for 1650 atoms a month for 8.33 a month.
---
Who's that?
---
It empties the world of all the junk and speeds up the learning of all the possible mods. Where as now you have to manage your inventory.
---
You and everyone else that wants a cheap laugh every time Bethesda screws up
---
I'm not scripping god teir items, I sell them on facebook trade groups,discord, /r/meerkat76. Takes like 10 minutes at most to find buyers most of the time.
---
I'm only pissed about the scrapbox since you can't argue against it being a true P2W item.
---
stability issues = money issues
---
Nice, you guys finally took 5 minutes to fix the typo after 11 months! Now what about fixing the game breaking damage bug? Any more info on that?
---
I thought I'd be mad but I kinda felt a subscription would benefit the game and with how much I play, count me in.
---
The game is feeling very bubble gum like at this point... lots of silly stuff, cutesy additions, and comic book feel to it. I think i might go back to Fallout 4. Im starting to miss what fallout used to be.
---
\*I'm sure you've tested the server yourself, you're *probably* a 100% correct genius.
---
\*No, junk still weighs stuff which would leave 800 for your weapons/armor for one character
---
\*A free travel camp with everything set up right at it that multiple threads have been made about in the past year
---
\*Paid paywall? Links? useless asterisks\*\*\*
---
\*Everyone keeps saying that supported by buying atoms and everyone is always wearing or using atom shop shit
---
\*Talking out of your Scorched-hole: priceless
---
Same as how I feel. A few of my friends that quit fallout, are starting again today . Been very excited since we learned private servers were coming soon. 
---
I'm not rich at all , and I can easily afford this.
---
What is the value for they caps you would receive as part of the service?
---
Total BS
---
This monthly membership is a great addition, I was expecting 9.99 for private servers alone with all other benefits it’s easily worth 12£/month
---
Thank you for giving me cancer. I never knew I could get it this easy. Chill with the kool aid
---
If you can't understand how someones salary has literally nothing to do with a market being unsustainable based on the consumers interest and oversaturation of the market then I don't think it's my understanding that's fucked here.
---
Like you literally showed me how much someone makes to prove market sustainability. You clearly have absolutely no grasp on why that doesn't matter at all?
---
That's why big banks, the stock market, and several other "too big to fail" markets never fail right? Because they make so much money? Jesus christ.
---
Nuke WS and Morgantown ad nauseam on your private world, farm all the raw fluxes and fluids you can, because there's nobody else but your friends there, craft a shit ton of stable fluxes, put them on your junk stash, go back to the Adventure Mode and profit...
---
I agree. I have many 5 characters with stuff I transfer between. It's a pain!
---
Because i'm complaining at how hard they're being greedy, taking away my interest to play in the future when there's more content.
---
But apparantly, complaining automatically means you're playing according to you/others?
---
Love to know how that works, don't dodge the question with a question.
---
Before this game I was a massive fan of Bethesda
---
Today, I'm currently weighing up if I should mail a box of my own shit to them
---
Well, don't Google the name of you are under 18 or are a Jehovah's Witness.
---
Blizzard happy as fuck right now that someone just out-stupided them
---
As I understand it, the NPCs will be limited to small areas. I'm okay with that. I don't think I want them everywhere. I want my NPCs to be the other players I can talk to or just wave at on my way by.
---
That’s apples to oranges. A stat increase is P2W. Not being able to hoard more shit
---
\&gt;Are we a joke for Bethesda? 
---
Yes.
---
$12 a month to look like you walked out of a better game.
---
Certainly, they will be. The most controversial one will be the unlimited stash thing, which as far as I've heard, is for junk, but I can't find any sources other than Reddit comments contradicting each other, claiming that they will be available in public servers or only private servers.
---
&gt;really struggling here, for something a child could understand.
---
It would take an incredibly young child, since anyone past three understands the distinction about how an action or word can be acceptable, and a different action or word not acceptable. 
---
&gt;Who are you and I, that should make that decision. 
---
The game developers. The game developers make that decision, they made it for literally everything they chose to include and not include. They didn't spend time saying "Who are you or I to include an American flag, but not ISIS or a McDonalds flag?" They included what they wanted, because that's how making a game works. You make what you like, you don't have an existential crisis and create nothing. And fans give feedback as to what they like or dislike, which developers to an extent are trying to cater to, within their original vision.
---
I'm not even explaining how making a game works here, I'm explaining how anyone makes a decision to do anything. It's always about doing something you like based on your values, and if someone says "who are you to decide?" the answer is "I'm the person who gets to decide, what sort of nonsense is that?"
---
&gt; "look over there, there is a flag flying, I can fly mine ". Who are you and I, that should make that decision. 
---
Also even ignoring that solipsism, my answer would be "No, because one is a flag for a terrorist organization, and the other is not." If the person objects and says they see no different, I'd call them an immoral idiot and tell them to get lost. If they object to that judgement, I don't care. That's how having morals and making decisions as a human being works, for everyone.
---
Since that's not even debatable, the question is why that person is pretending like it's all subjective. And the answer is that they have a terrible opinion and bad morals they don't want to admit to, because it's unpopular, so they just have to pretend there's no differences between good and bad values, it's all the same. They don't really believe it, but it's easier for them to pretend all flags are the same, than admit they support ISIS. Or hate gay people.
---
Wow so if you have workshops setup you lose everything?
---
If you think this is karma farming, open up some of the comments below threshold. It's cancer
---
And it has free mods that actually make the game run better than vanilla
---
^(And there is a bunch of creepy sex stuff if you're into that. I don't care I'm not the morality police.)
---
Lol. The mtx that are all optional? The only problem I have is the scrap box in the subscription. Other than that, I’ve earned thousands of atoms in game and bought everything I ever wanted in the atomic shop. 
---
And they’ve added a fair amount of quests, challenges, new mechanics like brewing, and additional game modes. All of that has been free.
---
Many people seem to like it though. I know a couple of people who play NW exclusively.
---
No, Jesus you people in this sub are a bunch of suckers. You are the reason this game sucks because you keep throwing good money after bad.
---
Well for Canadians (ME) it is almost $18 without tax included.
---
I have never seen a game with that few players for that much money, AND it doesn’t even stay online if you leave. 
---
By saying “one Fallout 1st player needs to stay in” it basically becomes a private match (like a private game on Minecraft, as opposed to a realm that stays after logging off).
---
All that and a huge price?
---
Private games run by you on your platform (that require you to stay in) are free on most games. If the game takes too much to run and needs a server so be it, but if its going to be CAD$20 a month, it should be at least like 20-30 players.
---
Wasn't it found out that we interpreted what he said incorrectly? That he actually said no pay-to-win items, and not only cosmetics?
---
I think one of the unmentioned problems is that many people invested in ammo as a currency. That stock market just crashed.
---
I am super excited about the T.E.N.T, but I think it being exclusive is a major mistake. Being Atom exclusive would have been bad.
---
Unlimited scrap is very QOL. Running out of adhesive while fixing stuff is annoying, not hard. 
---
Locking out the arguably most iconic outfit is also a strange choice.
---
A lot of people think they should get everything for free. A lot of the issues are blown well out of proportion and hampers the communities ability to counter Bethesda when needed.
---
Yeah! I just consolidated all of my sellable stuff and collections to one character. 60+ bobble heads and 6 magazine racks takes so much space 😅. This will help so much!
---
I wonder how much Obsidian paid them for the timing of this release??
---
Essentially, you are buying entertainment by the minute.  If you compare both services by what they offer as far as content, Amazon Prime is the clear winner.  If you are looking at the amount of time invested into both as well as replay value, well then it becomes a personal choice.  I have watched numerous movies and tv shows on Amazon Prime, but the amount of content absorbed is nowhere near the amount of time I spend with games.  While some movies or shows have some replay value to them, that only goes so far.  
---
Even with Prime, I still purchase music, books, shows, and movies.  So it is all one big advertising strategy.  So my spending is increased.  At least with Fallout 76 subscription, you are getting something in return.  1650 atoms a month is not a lot in game shop currency.  It is more than you would receive if you spent $10 a month on atoms.  So you get a private server, some spending money and a couple of extras.  If you spend the money each month anyway, its not a big deal and you will end up saving in the long run.
---
Yeah, its a kick in the pants to have to pay for something that many players were looking forward to using.  BGS should have been more upfront with their business plan and model from the get go.
---
True, but I don't want to support shit games and greedy developers.
---
I think US prices don't typically include any sales taxes whilst UK prices do...mainly because we have a single value added tax that applies everywhere in the UK and US taxes vary by location (state, County, city, etc). I wouldn't be surprised if the exchange rate works better when you add 15-20% onto the $ price.
---
Having said this, what I've said is definitely true in physical shops and I'm not sure if the same logic applies to internet purchases.
---
the "line" was destroyed months ago.
---
Bethesda (together with 2k, EA and Actvision/Blizz (and maybe Warner)) Doesn't see that they will hit a wall eventualy, if they keep on "maximazing profits" without thinking on the people that still play the game.
---
The industry need more of the present Cd Project Red: " It seems like it’s very profitable, though. It’s probably a hard decision for the guy that runs the business to decide if we should do it or not. But if everyone hates it, why would we do something like that and lose the goodwill of our customers? "
---
Seems like your problem is having an unoptimized build and bad inventory management, as well as willfully entering a pvp zone while overencumbered.
---
I better check on my phone then, not workstation
---
Well it’s optional, I don’t have to buy and I haven’t yet. But do your eyes hurt from crying so much like this?
---
I'm going to buy a month to see if it's actually worth it.
---
The market won’t be gone or dead. It’ll just change. Nothing wrong with that.
---
Of course they would strong arm people into buying the membership by using the most requested armor
---
Yup. People are really stretching the definition of the word "advantage"
---
Larian Studios
---
I saw where it said you can keep the stash but not put any more in. In a month I could fill that stash, that I wouldn’t have to worry about filling it for a while. The tent I’m not too bothered about, I’m always at max caps so the cost of travel is nothing.
---
Downvoted
---
They are insane ! Fellas let's rage so hard they feel that!
---
Official forums are always jam packed with shills. Look at the rest of social media. Sorry to say but reddit is filled with shills too. Not as many but still
---
Sorry that was my dad he goes on my account sometimes to dunk on idiots
---
Everytime this is pointed out, the fanboi response is "uhhh, well it won't be many people lol".
---
How the F**k can they know how many it will be?  So, what, their strategy is that if it's just enough we are good, but if it's too many people then the servers will just explode, oh well?  
---
Get real.  They are doing this b/c there is no impact to server performance for doing it!  That is the only reason they would allow it to also be on live servers and not just on private ones.  We've been bamboozled!!!
---
I'm out. WTF.
---
I did actually like the game, it wasn't the best or anything, but I had a lot of fun. But this just sucks. 
---
On a positive note, at least Jim Sterling has something new to rand about.
---
How do you sue for an optional service?
---
I collect rare and uncommon cosmetics, so I have a lot of that taking up stash space.
---
LOVE how people are down voting this 😂
---
They probably figure if you're dumb enough to buy it twice then you're dumb enough to pay for the subscription.
---
some hard core rolls there, generally does that Character seem fortunate?
---
&gt; How much did you pay retail for the game?
---
Fair questions, I paid full price for two copies. My son and I to co-op the fallout world (as was advertised to us). I paid the bicentennial versions so I think it was $80 each?
---
&gt; If you have not gotten your monies worth, exactly how LOW do you value your time?
---
My son only played a couple of weeks before the amount of bugs ruined the game for him and he stopped playing. I lasted about a month when it released before I quit too mostly due to stash limit and so not being able to loot anything. I just started playing again last week to see what has changed.
---
So no, I don't think I've gotten $80, much less $160 worth out of this game.  If you add in a monthly sub now, that's a good chunk of money into one game that by all metrics isn't worth $50, much less what has been paid.
---
I think I will likely acquire all future Bethesda games until I feel compensated for the money invested into Fallout 76.
---
8 person limit 😰
---
In true Bethesda style! Nothing is free bitch!
---
None of that gives me an advantage in PVP. Bobble heads and magazines are all over the world and I would argue are easier to get server hopping public servers. Literally none of that is something to complain about. 
---
If you're gonna complain complain about the unfair exchange rate, that's actually bullshit.
---
There were a lot of good updates in this patch, and I'm very happy about NW getting some more love.
---
I'm apathetic about the 1st service, I may pay for a month for the cosmetics, or maybe not. Just, meh.
---
Wow, the fact that you'd have to pay to play solo, is just astounding. Every previous fallout game has been a completely single player offline thing. All I want is to be able to play this game by myself. And now I'd need to pay 13€ per month to be able to do that? That's bullshit. Just let me play offline instead of giving me a private sever for which I need to pay. Let me mod the game, because that's what made 4 so replayable.
---
It's not even a continuous server because at least one first class player needs to be online. I'd bet that instead of it being on an actual third party private server it is just hosted by the owner.
---
Also you should blame VAT
---
This is kind of ironic because that is similar to what I say with the other non-cosmetic items.
---
The difference with the scrapbox is that there are no free alternatives. You could say that you can make multiple mule characters, but there is a limit on how many characters you can have.
---
As for the 'winning' part, you'll naturally have more resources available compared to other players because you don't have to discard anything due to weight limit and you will be better off in the trading market.
---
Yikes...while I was expecting a charge of some sort to be able to use private servers...but $12 a month seems really, really steep.  Especially since you can get services such as xbox game pass, apple arcade, etc...which feature tons of games....for less!   Obviously not apples to apples...but it just doesn't seem like a good value at all to me.
---
Ill be purchasing this just so i can play with a couple friends together. I think with time, we will probably have modding capabilities and offline play as well, Just have to be patient. 
---
Not sure why this is such a huge issue with the fanbase. Scrap is useless so idk why it matters if you have unlimited amounts. If it were just unlimited stash space id understand the upset masses.
---
Yeah ok but, they changed their stance last week and suddenly they have all this content, all imagery for promotion, organisation for payment etc done within a week. Theyve planned for this, a long time in advance.
---
It’s the reason why companies are still getting away with putting out “live service” games, AKA unfinished scrap heaps that the companies know will still make money because there is a devoted and loyal fan base that follows it. Pure extortion and it’s disgusting how people defend it.
---
The private servers is not what I expected. I thought they would let us rent a server that would be up 24/7, and let us change the server setting. The characters made in these servers would be seperate from public servers, to not mess with the game economy. That what I had in mind in what they do.
---
Which is crazy when what I want to mod are things like unofficial patch and improved inventory management.
---
Whale? It’s 13 bucks a month. Calm down.
---
They're probably doing it this way, because they know people will flock to hosting services that will offer more stable servers than they can. Or these private servers will magically be super stable and everyone will want them, just so they can play the game without crashing every 2 seconds. Also they're a greedy PoS company.
---
And for those that say "but Minecraft does it!" reality check; you can host your own servers on your own rig without paying anyone a dime. Will it be harder since you have to do all the hard work? Yes. Can you pay $5 a month for a decent hosting service that allows for even more people to play than 7? Yes.
---
Plz stop trying to justify this greed. They're doing this because people keep justifying and supporting their shitty practices. Just like they keep adding stuff to their atomic shop they promised they wouldn't.
---
I just want modders to rip the Appalachia map, and build a real game on it as an FO4 total conversion mod.
---
I bought GOTY Witcher 3 for £15 a while back
---
All these greedy fuck wads in the comments..
---
Todd: Pete, get him
---
Pete: \*attacks with his Twitter handle\*
---
Wow that's just next level stupid and will encourage them to pull stunts like this more often.
---
Next up, Fallout 2nd sub. You need to have Fallout 1st to buy it, and it gives you the ability to fart in game and have it smell like ripe strawberries. Only $10 more/month.
---
Was truly considering getting Fallout 76 to try on my new rig, now thanks to Bethesda, they made my decision way easier
---
Nice
---
5 us doesnt give 12 cad. On the website i see for 6$ canadian with new app in beta and for microsoft store its 12
---
Bethesda, you're nuts. [Alright fanboys and girls, it's time"](https://data.whicdn.com/images/300768678/superthumb.gif?t=1509816094)
---
BECAUSE, if you were actually prepared for PVP, something that’s easy to do in the base game, he wouldn’t have an advantage over you.  Also this person didn’t even have the service that you’re saying would give him an advantage. To reiterate, if you had entered a pvp zone with better inventory management and a more optimized build, you wouldn’t have this problem. Now if you got jumped and they used a bug to kill you, I might have more sympathy, but that’s not what happened.
---
Its beyond f\*\*ked up. Prices were already crazy now with this everything is gonna sky rocket. Im soo very glad i was able to get a be handmade from the purveyor cause otherwise id never get one knowing how insane everyones prices are. now with this stuff out itll be pretty much impossible to get it from other players
---
I did.
---
The atom value makes up the cost of the subscription, for sure. People who are super upset about this obviously aren’t regular atom spenders.
---
Stash size. This only holds junk.
---
They would have made more money initially if they actually fixed bugs permanently instead of just p!ssing off the people who paid full price with half-assed attempts at fixing the problems.   Instead, interns create the "patch/hotfix" with repeatedly horrific QA that seems non-existent..all the while the devs follow the blueprint instituting additional revenue streams.  Its obvious that the "technical" limitations of the initial release were purposefully created knowing it would push the whales over to the subscription.  Sure,  its their right to do it...no matter how wrong it is. Just like its our right to say F OFF.
---
The way you communicate is bs.
---
They can't have a situation where a modded private server is more stable and better balanced and better storied than their base version.
---
I totally agree and i'm not saying it's not bullshit, since I stated bethesda was being shitty.
---
I was just saying you really aren't being forced to purchase the subscription for the items, since people have been doing fine without the unlimited stash and tent thing
---
Thatll be 1600 atom points if you want.  Its just cosmetics though.
---
You can do business without being a compete asshole
---
Bump
---
iirc the reason why they added weight to the junk in the stash was to "increase the survival feel". where you would have to manage your materials instead of hoarding 100,000 weight of wood.
---
&gt;Well with the money they are now able to buy a second potato on which they can run their servers.
---
They will probably rent a cheap potato in Romania or something.
---
Why would it? The Ranger Armor doesn't have the LAPD logo on it but the CPD for WV use.
---
We've been asking for increased stash space, or at less things like scrap and ammo taking up less stash, for ages. Pretty much since release. The mantra was always that it would harm server load.  
---
Now either that was a straight up lie, or people who pay Bethesda will increase server load for everyone. Or if we all pony up for extra stash space, servers will be unplayable.  
---
Most likely scenario is that they deliberately held back this stash box so they could sell it for real world cash at a later date. Everything else was an outright deception that they were fully aware of.  
---
And the worst part? Despite knowing all this, I'll probably stump up for it anyway... Grrrr…. \*shakes fist\*
---
Honestly, I wouldn't even necessarily mind if they wanted private servers to be behind a subscription. But $100/year is ludicrous.
---
One day someone's gonna say "yes".  :)
---
Can we have your stuff too?
---
The issue people have is that the price, compared to other games that are supposed to be a similar genre, F76 is cash milking.
---
For the year option I can run an Ark server for 64 people. I can customize that server far beyond anything that F76 can do. There is also a debatable more things to do in the other survival/open-world games.
---
That includes: More building, pet/mounts, end-game content, greater arrange of crafting.
---
Bonus: Not paying for cosmetics in most of those games. Usually only new maps, if that.
---
And 19,800 atoms... why is everyone leaving that out?
---
"does microtransactions right."
---
Meaning they don't exist? That'd be nice.
---
NO
---
Hard to tell if stash limits were only placed to trick to thinking that something with a small about a data hurts the server so they could charge you an arm and a leg for the ability to have unlimited junk. Still Im paying that service.
---
Doesn't ESO have unlimited scrap?
---
Placing bets now that it'll go this way, all other NCR variants can be bought via atom shop BUT can only be modded to the original outfit given if you have fallout 1st subscription
---
Happy Nuke Day, where Bethesda nukes their own game.
---
I have the sad suspicion that the next Elder Scrolls is gonna be a shit show too so that'll most likely be 2 good franchises down.
---
Go wish your mom a happy labor day
---
Supposedly you get to keep it it not add to it, only subtract. 
---
So go crazy for a month on scrap then cancel.
---
Cool can I have your in-game stuff
---
I mean- why is anyone suggesting these and then being mad when it makes it in-game? Of course it's going into the item shop.  That's where new items come out. The developers still spent the time and money to create the item in-game. That said, all atomic prices are way too inflated and not worth it.
---
Pay to not have to spend 10 minutes farming for whatever scrap you don’t happen to have when you’re trying to craft something? No, it’s not pay to win.
---
Look I’m not saying I agree with Bethesda’s choice here but everyone is freaking out like you can buy the legendary armor and weapons you want instead of grinding for them. It’s a huge overreaction. Everyone knew we would have to pay for private servers, they just sweetened the pot a little bit.
---
A Canvas Tent at that.
---
My argument is you dont have to pay for it,everybody is making it seem like you cant play the game till you fork over the cash.Im not going to pay for it,but tis not pay 2 win just because you can store some extra junk you found.
---
Fair enough my man.
---
I still love the game, and been here since Beta.
---
However, I play other games on and off, so I’m kind of screwed with this whole subscription. I don’t play it enough to get a whole month, but would be incredible happy to have my own little world away from everyone but my friends.
---
Junk box cool nonetheless, but a shame they couldn’t give that to everyone, damn money grubbers.
---
Pricing model is similar to other games with private servers. I already pay for Minecraft servers for my kids as an example. People don't have to buy the private servers to keep playing but for folks who want it it's there and you get a couple of other perks for your money.
---
That's right. But we aren't playing each other. If I had to beat other players to get to the end game missions, and I had the sub and they did not, then sure, I would be able to "win" easier than they would. You can "win" the game with or without any of this stuff.
---
You seriously collect your scrap from workshops?
---
You can get more scrap than you could ever need in a fraction of the time playing on the normal server and just killing the right enemies or picking up the right junk...
---
This isn't p2w... this is just another pointless novelty convenience for people too lazy to actually play the game normally.  So you have 50 million adhesives hoarded in your scrap box and I only have a couple dozen... that means you win at repairing your weapon a million times.... oh... no, because when I run out of adhesive I just pick some plants in my garden and make some more.
---
When I first read about it I thought it would be a one time fee... oh how naive i was.
---
I wonder if you are allowed to dupe if you're a 1st member.
---
This is bs, the ”unlimited carryweight” busted that myth.
---
People wanted to be able to pay for PRIVATE SERVERS not PRIVATE SESSIONS. A private SERVER in persistent, has settings that can be adjusted, at the very LEAST has the SAME pop cap as public servers and your characters can NOT be used on both public and private to protect the economy of public.
---
You tease us with something people have wanted since day 1 with this "private server" talk and then have the audacity to switch it to PRIVATE SESSIONS!? These are in no way similar! 
---
My last interest in 76 was being able to host a PRIVATE SERVER with PVP enabled and Legendary gear disabled to give my friends and others interested a mostly gimmick free fallout pvp experience.
---
To think I allowed myself to get excited about this announcement. What a damn fool I feel like. 
---
PS unlimited space for junk is horse shit after claiming it is hard to up stash space due to server stability.
---
Absolutely not
---
 Who Else but Bethe$da ?
---
“But you know that” 😰😰😰
---
Thanks, but no thanks. Gonna have to write this game off as a loss for me. Spent $60 and I don't think I have 20 hours in it. This saddens me a lot. I'm from WV and I loved running around and seeing the landmarks of my state that was great, but, man, this game seemed doomed to fail anyway.  It could have been something amazing. Now it will just get uninstalled never to return to my hard drive.
---
A subscription model wouldn’t be so bad if the game had been legitimately great and there weren’t all these problems and deceptions around it. Instead there has been a failed launch and a monetization model that has been increasingly toxic.
---
Ye ark is insane  in space
---
I see why people are angry. BGS promised that only cosmetics from the Atom Shop would cost money. 
---
Imho they should have made it subscription based from the beginning, and it should have had XP bonuses, storage bonuses, camp limit bonuses etc attached to it. I would have gladly paid for it, knowing that my money was going to improve the state of the game and servers etc.
---
People are rightfully angry because they were promised something, and that promise was taken away. BGS has approached almost everything they've done for 76 poorly, and if they aren't more careful they are going to completely kill off the player base. A lot of people I know are so disenfranchised that they won't even be buying the next single player Fallout installment.
---
This is the only thing I'm pissed about. The other non-cosmetic items had better free alternatives, but the scrapbox doesn't.
---
But the game still stutters, still freezes, still can’t run for over an hour without a good chance of disconnecting, why would I pay for that? I’m honestly okay with paying but not for shit.
---
Wasn't the point of the atom shop to fund the development of this game?
---
Boycott Bethesda Christmas 2019! Make them listen, by hitting them in their wallets!
---
lol you're beating up a strawman pretty good there kid
---
Why?
---
Seriously... I reinstalled yesterday after not playing for probably 10 months to hold me over until Outer Worlds. I enjoyed playing it a bit but was surprised at how little has changed for the better. The news from today makes me want to uninstall again and completely forget about Bethesda.
---
You’re last paragraph is stating that they will have to....they’ve played it for almost a year without it, they can continue to do so. I get it though, you gotta look cool on reddit.
---
Storing infinite junk should have been in the game the moment the game launched. But if they already are so incompetent that they can't offer that at launch then at the very, very least this should be a free update. 
---
Bethesda once said "Look, there is a line. Other companies have crossed it but we will stay on the right side". And people defended when they introduced repair kits because "It's no big deal". And they defended scrap kits because "It's no big deal" and they defended the fridge because "It's no big deal". And see where we arrived now. Bethesda, you have crossed that line that you wanted to stay on the right side of more times than i can count at this point. But this is taking it a step too far. Unless they reverse that decision i'm done with the game.
---
For fucks sake...
---
I stopped playing for a bit in the hopes that things would get better and the Wastelanders update would breathe new life into the game but Bethesda seems to just keep fucking this cancer ridden corpse of a game.
---
(Assuming the "." is a "," in   1 in 40.000)

Yeah, have to agree. Everyone moaned about the Protectoron, but guess what, I see them at almost every camp I visit.
---
I have to assume reddit is no longer an accurate representation of the actual player base.
---
All my friends laughed at me when I bought it (nevermind that I paid full price). I defended and defended the game. I'm done with it for good now, boys and girls.

Yes... pay for convenience
---
Sounds like a corporation.
---
this makes a lot more sense actually
---
?!?!?!?!!?!? all you have to do is actually head over to the trading sites to see you are full of crap, .556 ammo has replaced caps for many high volume traders FACT
---
I went heavy weapons tank on my main for the ammo purposes, but after awhile the slow gameplay of it got to me lol. Also, with how many PA glitches are in the game I’ve sworn off using it until it’s fixed fixed. 
---
I also avoid glass canon builds so not sure about going 100% stealth commando.
---
Words cannot describe how shitty this move is Bethesda...
---
The only positive spin I can out on it is the ability to role play as Mr Burke from F3 😂
---
Don't tempt them. Don't tempt them with anything.
---
&gt;I'm going to be more privileged then you are.
---
except that everyone else can do this too =P
---
I’m really annoyed that they didn’t make an offline option, and the servers aren’t dedicated so I don’t see how it’s costing Bethesda much money. I’m okay with the idea of the subscription but I wish they’d add an offline option.
---
I mean most games do this Battlefield does the exact same thing is not out of the ordinary.
---
"We heared there is a lot of stuff you suggested. So we decided to put all of it behind a huge paywall!"
---
I don't understand it. I mean, I do, but only as an option next to hosting your own damn server. Like *so many other games* allow. This is pathetic.
---
All this pay to win talk seems a bit silly to me , what exactly are you winning ? In what possible reality is playing by ones self a pay to win scenario? PvP battles against you and yourself ? I just don’t get the complaint.
---
They already broke the "cosmetic only" promise with repair kits
---
I think at this point we can just assume that chat text has never even been a consideration for implementation and they want people to just use the crap emote system offered or third-party software to communicate if you don't or can't use a mic.
---
It really won’t be that many people quitting lol. The people crying is only a small portion of the player base.
---
Could always be the Shi, no?
---
&gt;Well what do you think reddit
---
I think there's already more than enough of these fucking threads on the front page, and yours is just adding to the clutter.
---
Would they take your scrapbox away after a month if you cancel your subscription? I can see them doing it
---
It'll be something to experiment with I suppose. Like if you leave loot to be transferred in a container, will you even come back to that same server.
---
Exactly
---
I'm not privileged when it comes to money. I'm not even middle class. When I get some extra income or save a little bit, I do nice things for myself - like put a little on a preordered game or get Fallout 1st. Shame on me, right?
---
If you can’t afford $100 bucks a year on something you enjoy I would worry about your money management and career choice.
---
Well, we know the code is incredibly bad, so they're just using that to make a bigger profit.  Seems like a better business decision than spending money to fix the code! ^^/s
---
This certainly is the Castle Bravo they dropped!
---
See the thing is, its not just the cost of buying the console. You've got the cost of multiplayer. 
---
Going with used PC parts, which work just fine. It is *entirely* possible to build a gaming PC that out performs any console for under $350.
---
Same. I’ve always had a soft spot for melee in 76, I’ve just never gone full melee.
---
it would have been 1500 atoms in the shop.   You can still get it for one month of 1st.   NOW i do not know if they would take it away after the first month if your not a member anymore but at least there is that. 
---
You are in a sense getting the outfit and 1650   for the price of 1300 atoms.   I think it is worth it at least for one month and they dont take it away. Which they possibly could.
---
Remember fellow gamers, all this outrage amounts to nothing but internet karma points and echo chambers if you don’t VOTE WITH YOUR WALLET. Stop supporting these companies that shit all over you time and time again. Stop buying their games and delete your accounts and profiles if you are truly angry. The only way you get any chance at change is to hurt their bottom line!
---
just wait till they charge for mods to use on those paid private servers
---
I don’t recall the source, but supposedly all cosmetic benefits (like the armor and icons) are permanent and not something you “rent” with the subscription.  I guess the scrap box is permanent, too, and simply becomes “withdrawal only” if you aren’t currently subscribed.
---
Go ahead and cry lil crybaby
---
they would then have to separate scrap storage from item storage or make all of the scrap weightless.
---
If they made the scrap weightless, then there is no reason for the reduction perk or the risk of dying as that is what you lose. 
---
and with the scrap storage container, they are able to separate items and scrap. I think this is the case so that the camp stash isn't sharing the same list as the scrap stash. 
---
I don't know how they set up their database or how they keep count of Items, so I could be wrong. I just know about databases from my programming classes when I was in college
---
The game isn't back up yet so impossible to know. You might be better off asking tomorrow, cause this post is gonna drown in the fire and brimstone of the Armageddon.
---
Todd?
---
Is that you?
---
But for a steep price? Instead of letting the community have a standard feature?
---
Not if they have issues with money
---
Cry some more. Guessing you don’t know that every game with private servers charge monthly. But keep trying to fit in with the other cry babies.
---
that is fine so long as those characters can never rejoin the general public servers though
---
what stops you from making every rad roach from dropping legacy weapons or every enemy giving you 5 levels of experience or just admin tossing out any item you want
---
I do think that kind of thing is needed letting people host and run their own servers from their own equipment but at same time the danger of letting people who do enjoy running into people randomly is very high - I mean I play mmo's to play with random people and meet new friends the idea that people could leave the main world become unstoppable behemoths and then return is horrifying
---
I mean look at ark when they let characters move between servers and how horrifically that went as a example since people just mad rapid lvling servers then went to normal servers and trolled them to death
---
nah, anyone who works in IT with virtualization knew what this 'stability' meant.
---
Resources.  It was always about stash space being a resource hog.
---
I bought the 200.00 helmet edition and my wife and I play together. She loves the camp building and I just love the fallout aesthetic game world. We were waiting on this option to share a server of our own. But the fact that we both don't always play at the same time will mean we have to each pay the membership has ruined the whole idea of a shred server for us. 
---
I honestly feel like this service should be free for the ones who have been around since day one. Especially the ones who got the power armor edition. 
---
oh well too many good games out and on the way. BL3 Outer Worlds just to name a few.
---
www.Bethesda.net/en/status
---
The patch is not broken (for what we know right now) since the servers are still under maintenance.
---
When the vast majority of players leave, and no one buys the game due to shit reviews, or buys ANY future game out of fear they will do this all again, you tell me.
---
I don't need that many every month. they are adding that to the package so people like you will assume it's a good value.
---
The hate here is real, but these are going to sell faster than collectrons.
---
Anyone know if it'd be possible to get a refund for this game if I bought it at launch from GameStop?
---
no it doesn't. that's like saying any other game that has optional private servers has an annual subscription. you don't have to subscribe.
---
The only thing I care about is increased performance on private world.
---
Splitting the cost of the server with a buddy will make this worth it to us.
---
I dont give a shit about any of the other stuff. 
---
Now time to wait for reviews on the quality of the private server...
---
Exactly, the cost is about 6% of what I pay for my Television subscription Service, but I spend a lot more time with this game than I do in front of the TV.
---
The cost per hour of entertainment with this game is an excellent deal, even if you buy all the bells &amp; whistles, so I don't understand all the Bitching &amp; Whining.
---
I always ask; "Would you rather Bethesda insert a bunch of commercials into the game"
---
The real issue seems to mimic an increasingly large segment of society today that feels they deserve everything for nothing because they are "Entitled".
---
that's my gripe with it also.  there simply isn't enough end game content for the price. as of now instead of 12.99 I would think 8.99.
---
You can play a large library of EA's games for less than the price of this. This is so shitty it could actually make EA look good.
---
It's not that I can't afford it, 100$ a year on this shit is just simply not worth it. Would you pay 100$ a year for someone to shit on your face? Don't think so.
---
mmhmmm, but only if you PAY FOR IT, everyone else cansuckit amirite?
---
It says "Exclusive Sales" not exclusive items. I'm pretty sure that means some items are better price for members. That's in a way no different than being an xbox gold member. (They could be using the wrong terms though, so I may be mistaking as well)
---
i never played F76 and this sounds awful. i was hoping the game was gonna get good a year or two after launch. or at least playable and worth like $15 
---
is this gonna be as bad as it sounds?
---
Eh, honestly all of us are still on the game, we still play together, we've put in roughly 500 hours each. Sure Bethesda has messed up time and time again, but we just try to make the most of things. Plus most of my personal purchase was financed with redeemed rewards from Bing, so it was more like I spent $140 rather than $220.
---
I’m sure it’s not but keep trying to fit in with the trend right now.
---
I mean. I think they should have just done a subscription that gave you XP bonuses, storage bonuses, camp limit bonuses. Like every other game. Not give you a private server to farm.
---
It's an MO game, not an MMO game.
---
Yeah.. Gotta say it looks a lot like desperation from here.
---
probably because the eso sub also gives you free access to any and all DLC (bar xpacks) the game has. putting aside that it receives updates on a relatively regular basis, those dlcs happen to be quite solid and generally enjoyable.  
---
someone's going to burst in and say how fo76 is already a lot better because it offers its updates for free, but... so far there haven't been that many notable and great additions to the game and wastelanders is still miles away.
---
the problem is that we shouldn't pay to have certain things
---
it's people's fault with their brilliant ideas of asking  in exchange for atoms 
---
renting servers made sense, but everything else no longer
---
&gt;\*No, junk still weighs stuff which would leave 800 for your weapons/armor for one character
---
The weight doesnt matter when you have a junk stash that can keep an **unlimited** amount of it
---
Jesus Christ. You types of people just dont get what the [effects of having unlimited scrap stash will do](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/dm0z7w/advantages_of_private_worlds_and_the_subscription)
---
&gt;\*A free travel camp with everything set up right at it that has been reqested over past year
---
Yay, our ideas being sold back to us! Thats clearly what we wanted
---
&gt;\*Paid paywall? Links? Proof? useless asterisks\*\*\*
---
You can only get the outfit from paying for the subscription. Thats called a paywall.
---
&gt;\*Everyone keeps saying they supported by buying atoms and everyone is always wearing or using atom shop shit and now they don't want to pay less for atoms and more shit
---
Because before, even though the pricings were a bit steep, it was purely **cosmetic**. Then they tried to trickle in these "convenience" crap and now it just evolved into P2W.
---
&gt;\*Talking out of your Scorched-hole: priceless
---
This statement gives me the impression that you enjoy witnessing people getting shafted so you can laugh at people that are asking for a little bit of fairness because "hey its not a problem for me, right? It doesnt effect *me* so people have no right to complain about it"
---
You're neglecting the "server" in "private server." Server means server. It's pretty basic shit.
---
After this update they don't have to worry most people will quit. I think GameStop is giving 15 buck trade in for the game. Right now I think GameStop is being ripped off.
---
Their game is still shit and they have delayed a huge piece of content. There's absolutely no give and take, they keep adding more ways to pay without adding proper content or fixing the shit already there.
---
I see your point here. I would love to have all dlc free and I hope that's how it happens. But in this greedy modern society big corporate is notorious for changing plans and going back on their word. A lot of people would agree that Bethesda has gone back on their word multiple times already with this game. 
---
By the way there is already paid DLC technically in the game with this new service as you get an outfit. There was also paid dlc technically when they had the atom deals with the outfits.
---
Outer worlds is going to be on gamepass??? You just made my day.
---
Link to server costs and suff?
---
Preach it brother
---
Well golly gee
---
I know how that feels...
---
You are just out here booting people today!
---
I LOVE IT
---
I haven't played Fallout in 2 months. I think it's time to finally uninstall
---
Since when does the game not give you a message telling you the servers are down for maintenance and your link just redirects to the Bethesda homepage...
---
These kids don’t know true pay to win. Their favorite youtuber used it once and it stuck with the.  They’re idiots.
---
But I already paid for the house, what do you mean I have to pay more to build a new room? OUTRAGE!
---
Meh. Outer world's looks like it's gonna be a great RPG/Shooter that lasts about 30 hours ...
---
It has none of the open world exploration fallout does. It's more akin to mass effect than Fallout. 
---
Not what I'm looking for
---
When I wrote these type of things were coming, back in 2019 summer i got around 300 downvote or so. Nothing to say.
---
Assuming the servers are constantly tracking all enemies, this could actually really hurt the server stability. If you have a ton of servers with 3 ppl each I would think proportionate load would be larger than a normal filled server?
---
At least they removed the NCR texture and changed the LAPD to something that's unreadable. Really cover their tracks where it counts....
---
You're today's lucky winner! Allow me to introduce you to [Goodhart's Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goodhart%27s_law), which can be summarized thus:
---
&gt;"When a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good measure."
---
The ***purpose*** of business is to provide for its employees by selling best-in-class products and services; a company's ability to make a profit is a ***measure*** of how well the business is fulfilling is primary purpose. However, starting in the early 20th century, literally all of mankind started falling into the trap of thinking that the measure was the goal, and so all the big corporations we know and love have been run by people who fundamentally misunderstood the true nature of business and focused on making a profit above all else.
---
Business does not exist to make money, even though making money is vitally important for business to function. But the lesson from history is very clear: when measures become targets, bad things happen.
---
Already preloaded. Only 40 gigs too.
---
But by paying, you get more free space in your stash, where you can keep more weapons and gear. Does that not strain the server, by your logic?
---
I'm not too proud to admit that I dropped 9.99 on Elder Maxon's sweet coat, and I skipped that game. So, for the Ranger armor.
---
.. I would try out premium if I can keep it afterwards.
---
Hell yea! Imma buy em all!!
---
Maybe so, but the single player was worth the price of the game, the online is just that extra bit that is nice to jump into with other players
---
Not defending the timing for this or its how they are playing it off. However, This is pretty standard Pricing for a MMO, wow is 14.99 a month, ESO 14.99, FF14 12.99. Dont get me wrong, i think it should be lower because at least with those games there's a lot more content that warrants that higher price, ESO is one of my favourite games, and i do like them taking after its model of design, BUT with the delay of wastelanders, the less than stellar launch and admittedly still low amount of content, it should of been reduced, it remove most of the public outcry it would of been wise to give the first month for free, be 5.99 a month until wastelanders, increase it to 7.99 with some added features, then increase 1 pound per 2 - 3 months, until it was back to 12.99
---
I wholeheartedly agree. It’s actually a massive deal because you get all of that stuff for barely more than it costs for a power armor skin.
---
Agree 100% Todd.
---
&gt; Yes, I don't get the outrage.
---
If that's true, then I get the impression there is no shortage of shit that you just don't get.
---
I never lose my bag in the grass. Are you color blind?
---
Great NEWS Tod just got a promotion and a new Lambo! High 5 to us suckers for paying him to win!
---
Because a large portion of the community is toxic.
---
nobody cares
---
"Private worlds will continue to evolve with new features such as expanded building areas, increased C.A.M.P. budgets and Workshop persistence."
---
https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/article/3r1YDnDtyO1CtNFbJX6RBJ/fallout-76-fallout-1st-launch
---
These comments are gold.
---
What new content? All I’ve seen is a raid and a cookout festival.
---
The endgame is barren, I bought it when the game was a garbage heap sale, put in 64 hours I think, after clearing the map I quit cause the main quest just ended and there was nothing to do except run around. I literally fell asleep playing sometimes and would wake up from a Scorched.
---
I still keep an eye on it every now and then cause I’m guessing the game will be good someday eventually when it’s finished.
---
Agreed. Still looks like it's gonna be a great new IP.
---
There should be an option to just get a private server for free, Bethesda wouldn’t have had to spend money if the let us host them ourselves. No one asked for an atom shop monthly subscription either.
---
This fanboy is shocked. I always defended them saying that although they might not be the best programmers they clearly do it with a heart.
---
I hope selling that heart just now can finally get them some decent programmers. 
---
Damn Bethesda I'm hurt.
---
Not sure what I posted that you mistook as uncivil or not calm, but never mind.  Looks like they probably could deal with dubious PC gamer IDs, I dont think OP posted what platform he was on though so I guess that's the end of that for now.
---
You’ve made good concise points about the subject? Must be a troll /s
---
You know that Zenimax and Bethesda are the same company, just different branches/subcompanies, right?
---
A round of cosmetics only available to  people who paid for the game? Lifetime of whatever "premium membership" they launch?
---
it looks like they changed it to CPD (Charleston Police Department)
---
the fuck do you expect when the game wasn't even making any money in the first place??
---
They took so many steps back they didn't even realise the countless piles of dog shit they stepped in.
---
Unlimited Scrap Space should be a free feature, considering the state the game launched in and still is. Sounds to me like they know that this game has no future and they just want to make as much money as they can before it crashes and burns.
---
I don't like this.. In my openion its not ok.
---
Well said. Apparently it's just junk though..
---
Definitely. They could've delayed wastelanders for only a little bit. after releasing wastelanders would be the best time for this because it would allow player to immerse themselves in actual content
---
They said DLCs will be free for the first year, indicating they’ll be paid for starting the following year. Wastelanders should still be free though
---
Private servers arent the issue. Its the pay to win aspects that are clearly included, like unlimited stash. Its ridiculous and this company has lost all its good rep.
---
They delayed the decent update and replaced with this, shows they dont care at all about fixes etc..
---
RIP Bethesda 2019 honestly.
---
This ***might*** make me stay.
---
It doesn't bother me.  This is the traveling mob of Reddit outrage.  They'll be gone in a couple days.
---
Personally I'm fine with the subscription it's a suitable price for as many servers they have to run.
---
Yah but this games heavily exploited bugged too and might as well be a beta shoving a sub fee in there i remember when ark wiped my single player data never went back still waitin for that in 76 and pvp in ark was a horrible expeirience the lets play server was not a fun place but i switched to pve had more fun less taunting and such there
---
I could be wrong abour this, but isn't that due to currency exchange rates? i.e. the Euro is worth more than the US dollar?
---
Funny because Activision has posted nothing but beats for the last 4 quarters. Meanwhile EA had one even quarter and 3 beats in the last 4. 
---
Uh oh you found somebody that follows the market.
---
How ironic.
---
Why are you commenting on something you haven't followed don't seem to understand? That isn't useful at all.
---
Whoever is in their marketing and strategic planning should be looking for a new job.  "Hey, you know how we said Wastelanders was coming out this year?  But like, now, its totally not?  Well, what if we launch the subscription instead?  And.. AND... hear me out on this... add a bunch of perks that will make non-subscribers pissed off?  Bu then in like 6 months, we totally put those in the Atom Shop, and piss the subscribers off too?  I know, I know, this is why I went to Dartmouth...."  
---
I guess I'll catch y'all after Wastelanders comes out and see how they have managed to fuck that up.  At least I still have work to do in Skyrim...
---
I bought FO76 3 weeks after it launched. I thought that was enough time to get a good fell for it. I was happy with some things, but overall disappointed. Quit playing when stash was still 400. 
---
I heard private servers were coming. I was thinking about setting one up and hosting it for my friends that never bought the game. Maybe we could play it together and have fun. 
---
But this, no. I will still tell my friends to not purchase this game. It's all designed around customer interaction for income, microtransactions and the like. It doesn't feel like a game with MTs, it feels like a cash flow designed to look like a game.
---
Wait.....when exactly is Outer Worlds gonna go on Game Pass?
---
The real april fools joke is the fact that you all still play this game and buy atom store shit.
---
Literally just move on and wait for starfield or tes6.
---
That wouldn't work, servers require constant maintenance. Asking for a one time fee is just asking for instability. They should have never promised to give all additional content for free, they should have known that wasn't feasible. This isn't Runescape. This is Fallout. If they had just charged from the beginning they would have had the funding to accomplish what they needed to by now.
---
I thought the devs said they weren't going this route with the game when it first launched. Unlimited component storage is pay to win. I could be wrong. Shoulda paid more attention to the subreddit when the game dropped
---
i mean i don't personally care about the changes and i'm happy to get private servers. but if you are a person who is sooooo bent out of shape over things that you really feel that things are the way the OP has written, you can go cut grass or dig ditches or donate plasma or something for 100 bucks a *year*. =P
---
i'm not saying people should do that, i'm just saying that a person is that upset about it, i think that energy could be channeled into something that would get them 100 bucks in a year.
---
Well shit, I guess the handmade rifle skin was also the community's idea because somebody made a post about it before it became a thing. Wastelanders is going to be our idea because we mentioned humans before they announced it. Don't forget the mailboxes that were datamined months ago, that's our idea too
---
&gt;I can no longer defend this game.
---
you're about a year too late.
---
End of the day I guess this confirms the game is not making enough money to fund itself.
---
I don’t think they trying to piss anyone off. They came up with a sub they thought their fans would enjoy. Renting server a month in Ark cost me $11.99 and it’s the best thing I ever did on how to play that game and I’m definitely tryin this out
---
Agreed. But damn I wish it was NV in space
---
I understand complaining about Fallout 1st, but skins? Really?
---
Ok but thousands worth of junk kind of is as now people can store an unlimited amount of junk.As bethesda said having an unlimited amount of space will cause server disruption servers are under enough pressure as it is. It doesn't need another problem adding to it.
---
Classic WoW is actually worth the money
---
Through paid DLCs, like they’ve always done.
---
And then go for $7600!!
---
I've learned my lesson in the past with buying on to a "optional membership" - I buy into it and the game completely shuts down never to be played again.... RIP Money.
---
It was only 17 for me, Which system?
---
So You get to buy "Fallout 4 multiplayer" for 100$ as I see it
---
(That's the joke)
---
I really hope they consider going free to play. It would bring new life to the game, new people to meet, and maybe a new public image. Their decisions wouldn't be so scrutinized if you hadn't paid $60 to get in, on top of the Atom Shop and Private Servers 'scandal'. It very much worked for Destiny.
---
well your choice was between 2 shit games so...
---
Yes. The art department is definitely doing some heavy but fixing and coding.....
---
I did read it and I am not bothered. "LMAO"
---
It’s just 30$. Nothing huge.
---
I bought FE 3H full price and didn’t bother to do the second level.
---
honestly, their real problem was keeping the scrapping station, outfit, and especially the tent behind the paywall.
---
if they said "for 12.99 a month you get private servers and a free 1600 Atoms/month.  you also get the outfit, and scrapping station for free"   coupled with "we are adding a scrapping station and tent to the main game" (even if they had been added to the atomic shop) there would be a lot less blow back
---
tho realistically, the scrapper and tent should be added to the base game.  and the tent should probably be locked behind a quest. (this actually would have been a great addition to the release of wastelanders quest lines)
---
We complained about people who cheaters using items that could easily be exploited, what happens? Oh, yeah, let’s nerf TSEs into the ground and let cheaters keep doing their thing
---
I don’t understand it
---
Yeah, I know this post is redundant, but even I'm calling bullshit on a subscription service for a game this troubled.
---
Normally, I think Bethesda gets shit on too much by the Fallout community, but they've certainly earned it this time.
---
It probably won't all be in today's.  They tend to add stuff in the background files and then drip it out over time.
---
I feel you. I bought the power armor edition and regretted it instantly
---
Gna be entertaining to see
---
I never got past 10 minutes of Fallout 3, wasn’t a fast enough pace for me then. I like games where it’s no stop run in get killed and then repeat. Then I started playing different games where you had an open world etc and loved it. So I pleated Fallout 4 and that took over my life for 6 months but not like 76.  I’ve got a daughter who I’ve got in training to play along with. She’s only 9 so way to young to be playing Fallout but in our own server, where we can just stay around the vault and build. It beats playing Minecraft with her as that sends me insane.
---
Just updated and I went to log in and it said " Failed to log in this account lacks the needed requirements"    Doing a hard restart....HMM....Not cool t his is starting to feel like Ark
---
I agree but I think it will be more akin to a KOTOR 2 experience. They've even said as much by comparing it to Mass Effect and the Normandy, which was just like how you got around in both KOTOR games. I'm excited because I think it will have the depth of story and replayability those games had but in a totally new universe they created.
---
See ya.
---
People can't be hoarders in a post apocalyptic world? Bullshit.
---
It does energy damage too up to 110 if modded right on top of the rads, bloodied is good for hitting that damage cap.
---
Well played, sir.  Well played.
---
More like 1 step forward, stubb your toe on nonexistent rock, laaaagggggggg, rubberband back 2 steps
---
Ah yes, programming new content does not require artists whatsoever.
---
And it would be yours to keep, free forever. Just imagine!
---
Don't forget about the raids!  There's no way that those won't be better in a private world.
---
Your title reminds me of the classic hit [C.R.E.A.M.](https://youtu.be/PBwAxmrE194). I could go for a Fallout video attached to this song.
---
The game was $60 at launch. It was not finished and Bethesda has been working to fix it over the past year. This patch TODAY fixed the issue of the prime combat rifle using the wrong ammo. It took 11 months to make a simple fix to an obvious issue that has been in the game since beta.
---
People are mad because the game is still a work in progress and not Bethesda is pushing a premium membership to get features that have been requested by players. New content has been lacking and half of the 2019 roadmap has already been pushed to 2020.
---
Well you commented addressing the anger of a paywall so that’s what my response was targeted at, I agree that the unlimited stash is a bit to much and even pay to win, we can find common ground and agree it should not have been implemented this way or at all
---
So will you be coming back for wastelanders?
---
I would not be surprised of it does go F2P once there is more content and a more stable foundation, much like how Destiny 2 has only just gone F2P. 
---
It's a harsh reality but it's all about cash, they need it to make the game better and continue to support it, and in a game that's always online they need to keep them servers running and that costs money, obviously Atom sales weren't doing it, can't imagine why, so next step is a subscription. If going full F2P is beneficial for them financially then they will do it. 
---
Plenty of MMO games you had to pay up front to buy them then pay a sub each month, it's not uncommon, though less so these days.
---
yes they do. this is where they get the ideas about what shit to sell you.
---
congratulations, you played yourselves.
---
Wow, I finally found one of the few rational people on this sub. I couldn't agree more.
---
I mean for a 100 bucks, I could get a EA Premier subscription and get access to over 200 games, or a Playstation Now account  and some booze, or Xbox Live Gold Premiere for like 5 months and some booze...   
---
Maybe they should have tried timing this with the release of Wastelanders, but if they're dropping it before I wonder if they're expecting some negative backlash from it's release at this point
---
Kiss me
---
You don't know how servers and databases work. 
---
They still use up database space regardless if they connect to a private server.
---
You know how you have something like an Excel sheet or a word document that's a few MB - then if you delete half the info inside, it shrinks the file size.
---
Information takes up database space.  Connecting to a private server doesn't delete their data (which is how you'd get more space like you claim).
---
so true.
---
And people don't have to get a private server anyway really. i think the examples of the 'edge' you are going to get is a bit over the top anyway. if you really want to pvp in this game, i'd think you go to NW where pretty much none of these things are benefits. and people killing the SBQ faster than you... i mean who really cares. nothing wrong with competing on stuff like that, but i don't think the game is designed around who can kill the SBQ the fastest anymore than any other game.
---
If you want to pvp, there are way better games IMO. And if you are doing speed runs on the queen... well that's just kind of normal end game stuff when there is no content. people get bored and look for ways to compete. =P
---
Except it applies to all game modes, not only private worlds. You have unlimited crafting storage on the official servers as well.
---
Do you have any Bitcoin?
---
It's just too much real good money for nothing real to me. And ontop of them Saying unlimited was impossible, and then to release it behind a pay wall, just sucked. I really wanted unlimited. And playing on console just adds another monthly payment.
---
I paid for one month. Can't wait for the servers to come back online!
---
I have 15 mule accounts on xbox. But I won't be using any of them anymore because this announcement has convinced me I am done with the game.
---
Maybe when bethesda quits raping everyone over a barrel, maybe. 
---
im with OP though, fuck Bethesda at this point, until they get their shit together nobody should be buying this bullshit. 
---
If you’ve bought the game with all the things that were supposed to come with it you’ve already spent around $150
---
Not to mention cosmetics and scrap boxes or other bs you buy in store and now on top of ALL THAT they want to charge me another $100 for single player with only 7 friends? 
---
That wasteland is gonna be pretty lonely friends. Literal lone wanderer.
---
I'm happy with the decision but not the reasoning behind it. It doesn't mean I don't care about the game, I just hope there is an actual server population decrease quickly so it's seen as a direct correlation as opposed to a coincidence. I want the game to be successful, but it won't be the way they're treating it.
---
I thought that re-re-re-releasing of Skyrim on every platform was the real cash cow...but I guess I was wrong.
---
This doesn't seem correct.
---
Fuck. I only bought this game 2 weeks ago expecting since it was a year down the line lost of the initial problems were fixed/on the way to being fixed. I log in to find a game just as broken as the launch reviews suggested, just as lacking in interesting lore, and just as devoid of meaningful content as it was almost a year back. Now they want me to pay for a premium service when the core game is still a fucking mess? Unless Starcraft and TES6 have absolutely awesome reviews out of the gate, I shall be waiting on them going on deep deep sale if I even get them at all
---
This isn't private servers, that's a technology (given the current limitations of the game) that hasn't been developed yet as far as I can tell.  It's more of a 'private game' mode.
---
They would need a different service with AWS to provide real private servers.  As they're *highly* unlikely to hand out the server code to anyone, it gets tricky.  They'd have to control the base server game and set it up to allow more granular control (probably hasn't been developed).  And they'd have to separate the characters at a server level (also probably not developed) so that there's no mixing between private and public servers.
---
I have doubts that they'll go that way (or be able to).  It will be *more* expensive to do this, though if they cut out the atoms and other bonuses, it might reduce the cost some.  Not even sure how atoms would work if you can just add a mod to give people on private servers the same things for free (and that whole though almost puts the last nail in the coffin in my mind).
---
Not for some  video game tin cans and type writer! 😂😂😂
---
greedy incompetent cunts like todd shitward
---
I can make stuff up too, y'know. This is the internet. You expect me to believe you 'have hundreds of hours working on videogames online and writing scripts" just because you say so? Cause if you *have* worked on game development (or have a decent understanding of it), you should know that the Artist Team and Dev Team are *completely* seperate from one another. They make stuff for the atom shop and other such things, but they're not the ones in charge of *any* of the game's stability, whether it's bug fixes or balance changes.
---
Well, they did finally realize that the amount of scrap is an integer that they can store in a database table with little cost.
---
There is at least that...
---
It's scrap. A lot of people are making drama for unlimited scrap. But honestly who cares when you are HL with good Camp to have unlimited steel lead wood leather etc... Usually I give my scrap or throw it when I meet one new low lvl player.
---
Yeah, the Fallout 1st thing is optional and even the gameplay bonuses are mediocre at best. Nobody is forced to pay to play 76 as it has always existed.
---
I'm gonna stick around for the ride. There just aren't any other multiple games that are appealing to me.
---
Thanks Obama.
---
Holy melodrama, Batman!
---
I ain’t buying shit lol
---
This is a bold move indeed. A bold move in the RIGHT direction. It should have been this way from the start, then we wouldn't have a game in the state it is right now. I may actually start playing again because of this move; it shows me that BGS is taking the game seriously and is trying to save it from imploding.
---
Nobody has to know
---
Exactly my thought. Definitely considering it
---
They just need to remove it. This is pay to win content, and something everyone has been asking for month to be added in the game for free. Whats next ? More CAMP budget for those who paid for it ? Come on Bethesda, you can do better than this...
---
Just as a disclaimer.
---
That's not people in game, the number above is the number of subscribers this subreddit has, the one below is the number of active users on this subreddit in that particular moment.
---
It's more the principle, got a half finished game, then delaying content and not a week later announcing this
---
inb4 Elder Scrolls VI subscription
---
Pay to win gets misused so fucking often nowadays.
---
Pay to win means you can buy something that gives you an advantage over someone else and that other person literally can't get to your level without also buying it.
---
That's not true at all in 76. Having infinite scrap doesn't give you unreachable levels of power.
---
Had some friends early in '76's launch like that, would loot multiple TSE's in WhiteSprings in every run, and other god rolls.. (pre TSE and WhiteSrpings nerfs)    
---
They eventually got bored and quit :-/
---
run along home to your fake forum now Bethie, the jig is up.
---
Yeh I agree, I followed Fallout online, a long time fan. Wasn't to keen on the idea but had to try it and I love teaming with randoms or playing with friends but it's getting silly now, seems every new update is aimed towards making money, with little to know DLC being added to keep us happy, when really the number of palyers are declining...
---
Then they go ahead and do this, I'm both shocked and baffled.
---
It's currently available for predownload!!!
---
There absolutely is.
---
Oh, I completely agree with you. It is still better than the alternative.
---
I was a sucker that bought the Tricentennial edition... At launch! 
---
Still, I rather enjoy the game and really want this feature.
---
And it only runs when you are on, so your friends have to buy it too.
---
You could already easily stash a set of pvp armor again, as long as you manage your stash. And it’s not like a scrap stash givers you more character inventory, your character inventory is the same.
---
  One of the more satisfying moments with melee of late was taking out a SB that decided to go toe-to-toe with me.  No sonics, no gas.  It screeched, landed in front of me, and started swinging its wings.  
---
Took it out with a switchblade.
---
(Don't think I'd try that with the queen though....)
---
If your budget includes buying 10s of dollars of cosmetics for a game every month, I wouldn't call you underpaid.
---
Whatever you think about Fallout 1st, it's not Bethesda's fault that Microsoft and Sony gouge us for the ability to use our own internet.  It's shameless, and I hate it, and I'd be all for arranging some Occupy Microsoft protests in Washington to send a message.
---
Private Instances\* Its not a private server... Its the same thing as a GTA V Online invite only session but your paying £11.99 per month for it.
---
People just see obsidian and let their imagination do the rest.  I feel like there are gunna be some disappointed people that have the idea of 'space NV'. Hope its good though, totally down for trying it out. Maybe fill a space left by Mass Effect.
---
We will see very soon how this will effect a bear in mind "Bethesda Server" it will not be consequence  free mark my words there will be stability issues as a result.
---
Probly fed with a bottle of microtransactions as well
---
i like the private world and everyhting else but this got me. Very surprising. I even said something to this effect when the fridge was out.     They should give this to everyone.   If a problem making it a 10k limit then. either way  shouldn't be a thing you have to buy.
---
We live in a society!
---
I get all legacies AAE Flamer please AAE Gatling Laser please
---
Is the exact same premium membership monenization system people flip the fuck out at r/MMORPG every time a Korean game implements it. And those MMOs are f2p. Some games have died due to this system, Bethesda gets away with this due to the Fallout brand.
---
Hello Games (maker of No Man's Sky, which has released a ton of new updates including VR for free)
---
Bye. Wont miss ya lmao
---
Pacifist mode is a thing. And if there is griefing, that 1st member can just peace out and boot up a private server where no one can bother them.
---
They sound awesome, go play their shit
---
I don't think the cost of the console should count that's like adding my TV or the electricity.
---
Keep in mind this sub has some of the most toxic and entitled people in it. They expect everything to be free and will whine and whine if they don't get their way.
---
Junk might have very little value, but it all adds up in the long run.
---
With the scrapbox, you also have more available stash space for other stuff because most people use the stash to store components.
---
Bethesda really lost me on this one, private servers are fine. Not my cup of tea, but the other benefits they get that should be part of the main game and its sick to charge extra for that. We've endured so much crap as a playerbase and this is the thanks we get.
---
I mean, id buy it If the server cost is higher in Europe. Meaning something physical is the boundry. But If its only data well 👀
---
Just like FO76 then?
---
Point is, we don’t know the financials of D3 to state whether it was a success or not.
---
A much simpler and better thought out limit would be to have maximums on junk but have them still not interfere with standard weight. I.e: 10k steel limit, 3k copper limit, etc.
---
I’m heading back over to BFV, that Pacific Update looks SWEET! This is most likely the point at which I am basically done with Fallout 76.
---
I wouldn't go \*that\* far. People have other needs.
---
In contrast the 100$ makes it like 10.50$ monthly, like a Netflix subscription.
---
2 hours with 800+ upvoted is insane.
---
This is Bethesda we're talking about - both of those are pretty unreasonable.
---
Taxes...
---
This would be the straw that stamped the shit out of the camels back for me.
---
The fuck are you on about
---
Imagine actually buying and defending this game for this long.  
---
You all really were taken for a ride, lmao
---
Or keep playing FO76, but just don't pay for the extra stuff you don't want anyway.
---
Gods below like what are they even doing at this point.
---
Fair statement, but I’m not so sure anymore. There’s a long history now of scummy behaviors. First they were on the forefront of the micro transactions trend with the Horse Armor, then trying to implement paid mods, then implementing the Creation Club, and now everything they’ve done with Fallout 76. 
---
At this point, I’m not sure how to separate BGS from Zenimax. I love BGS games and am hopeful for ES6, and incredibly excited for Starfield, but I won’t be surprised if either/both are marred by some scummy/predatory monetization practices.
---
I'm not against MTX or subscriptions, tbh. Games cost 69 USD at launch since I was a kid, and that was back on SNES days and I do realise how much more expensive is to develop and run today compared to back then, and I'm not gonna even start talking about inflation and stuff, but Bethesda is just a PR disaster of a company, that is difficult to give them some credit. Just give everyone a couple thousands of Atoms and a badge and call it a day, it's not that hard or expensive and would do wonders to calm their playerbase down...
---
bathesda more like cancer
---
76 is now officially going to die, by the hands of its own creators, doing everything they possibly can to repel anyone from wanting the press on, game has all ready become boring and very little to do that means anything. Cue pay 2 win tactic...people now have a valid enough reason to not play anymore, because monetizing everything screams "we love you, keep playing!".
---
ARK Survival Evolved Modded  
---
Heavily Modded Minecraft  
---
Co-op Modded Skyrim  
---
Or literally [half the games available](https://fragnet.net/?page=gameservers) at your typical game server host.  The other half being simpler, but will allow you to host more than 7 people...
---
&gt;Yea and you still would have the Issue with your "Server Box" that you need Linux Skills, a very fast SSD and Probably at least 4+ Cores alone for the Application
---
Yes, and?  Linux is pretty common.  Nothing you listed is particularly expensive.  The computer I use everyday, at home, exceeds those specs and I'm on fiber internet.
---
Boo hoo baby. Go finger your mom.
---
I would imagine it’s similar to their craft box from ESO can pull whatever you want whenever you want but if you don’t have the subscription then you lose access to putting stuff in or using anything inside it
---
So, here's the question. 
---
Does the loot timer still apply in private worlds?  Currently an item can only be looted every so often (20hrs isn't it?).  If you can boot up a new world and re-loot that will indeed kill the market, but if this is prevented it shouldn't be as big of a concern. 
---
I know this was an issue back at launch. People server hopping McClintock clearing out the springs on every server, same with the weights
---
But it literally is ptw, you can go to an offline server and farm every single workshop with 100% no other players working against you, then hop into a public server and sell off everything from your infinite scrap pile and make easy caps. 
---
It seems that people who are defending BGS don't get that we're 300% ok with paying for a private server. But your stuff in a private server should stay there, just like with Minecraft. Not to mention the fact that it's overpriced to hell and back. Minecraft servers are like $7-8 a month not this fucking $13 nonsense. And the "sweetening the pot" thing is not even worth all that much. In a game where you can fast travel literally anywhere and have a perk to make it even cheaper the forward camp makes zero sense.
---
Lol thx for that
---
Bla Bla Bla Who Cares
---
Crafting mats are just one entry in the database, with name, with amount and that's it. The server doesn't care if amount says 1 or 1000000. So yeah, server stability is an outright lie. It would be true if you got unlimited storage for everything. A fully outfitted power armor frame is basically 8 items in one to keep track of so yeah, that would make sense. But unlimited crafting storage will have zero impact on the servers.
---
at launch, so tomorrow/in two days depending on where you are.
---
choice is cool indeed my friend. my choice to write a word to the attention of a company as a costumer. my choice to put my money wherever i want. my choice to use my play time on other games. and of your course, your choice to embrace their decisions. 
---
choice is cool indeed...
---
honestly, this is exactly what they should do.
---
they are clearly shifting to the "pay to play, or free to almost play" model.   if they were smart, they would just announce that fallout 76 was going to become free, and give every player X amount of Atoms. (this could be based on how long ago their start date was, or just give a straight amount to everyone)  since they value atoms at roughly 1 atom = 1 cent, then just give every player 6000 atoms, thats not that many in the big scheme.   Then make the premium membership cost 2000 atoms per month (still receiving the "free" 1650 monthly).  that would give players who paid for the base game a boost in membership, and make it theoretically possible to pay for the membership through play.   and it would ultimately be *VERY* profitable for them in the long run.
---
or make the membership cost like 300 atoms a month, with none given.  so that the people who are paying real money get that extra bonus
---
I know bud.  However, just because they like to bitch doesn’t mean we have to let it go without refuting their flawed logic.
---
Private game, not private server.  But this is probably a good deal for people like you who already spend some money on atoms and bundles.
---
Look at it from the standpoint of people who just wanted a AAA game and already paid what they think it's worth.
---
I'd be more inclined to think pulling the same item three times in a row is likely to be a caching, server communication or refresh glitch. There's a lot of latency/problems in this game's communications with the server and this would explain it more easily than a weighted system, which still would be more likely to pull different items in a row, just from a more limited pool.
---
I'd actually *pay* for that.
---
it looks like a chinese borderlands knock-off?
---
The moment they released actual gameplay on youtube everyone suddenly went "wait...this looks shit"
---
Guild Wars 2 does not have a subscription, neither does the first one afaik, the other two are free to play.
---
They have turned all the players' ideas into pay items lately. This game is past salvation.
---
We tried, though.
---
Happy to give you something to read ;)
---
&gt;NOW i do not know if they would take it away after the first month if your not a member anymore
---
Already established that you keep any items from the subscription forever, including the Scrapbox. However, you can't use the tent after expiration, nor can you store stuff in the box. But outfits and such will be yours forever
---
I have a very good job but I don't like blowing it on a lying company anymore.
---
You're either very young, naive, only play MMORPG, or a mix of all three. "Most" RPG don't have this.
---
I'm assuming there's gonna be a halloween bundle with the exclusive orange smoke machine
---
Its amazing the amount of people stating that the €100 a year is a "great deal". When i was a kid when you bought a game you got everything then dlc was introduced and now they are restricting game elements that they said was impossible to do but then add them to a payed service. I must be getting old but there needs to be a line drawn to how far game companies can push their fan base its getting quite ridiculous at this stage and people who defend it need a reality check.
---
They really needed to come out and make the game free to play with this subscription addition to the game. If they wanted to go full ESO then just go full ESO. 
---
In addition I 100% agree they NEEDED to do something for everyone who purchased the game on day 1 or frankly anyone for buying the game up to this point period. Hell, I would even have been "fine" with giving everyone at least a month of the membership for free as a thank you to all the loyal fans.
---
That's what we said back then. Nobody cared about the repair kits themselves, we cared about the implications for the future they represented. Because we knew that if you give them an inch they'll take a mile. And this is exactly what we envisioned back when everyone else was repeating"It doesn't matter this feature isn't important!". Yeah that feature wasn't, but it allowed them to keep going and see where that got us now.
---
I just follow my marker
---
Don't worry it will be forgotten like every other outrage before and the game will still persist.
---
Boycott Bethesda Christmas 2019! Hit their wallet, and make them listen!
---
The game doesn’t even run properly, arguably worse than day 1 and they want people to not only pay for pay to win items now they want $100 a year for a fucking infinite storage box and private servers? LMAOOOOO wow. What the fuck is going on over at bethesda
---
It also has 1650 atoms for whenever they release another highly requested fo4 reskin in the atom shop
---
Tents would be gone, and you'd still be able to pull your junk from the scrap box until its empty, you just cant add to it anymore...that's how I read it.
---
The problem isn't the subscription itself. The most popular MMOs on the market right now (WoW, ESO, FFXIV) all follow subscription models. The appeal of subscription though is everyone's on a more or less even playing field and you're not getting nickel and dimed to death with p2s cash shop BS, whereas Bethesda's managed to find the worst of both worlds by combining a questionable premium level subscription with a ludicrously expensive cash shop.
---
Remember his is the future of ES6/FO5. The continued engagement of the mod community is far too valuable not to monetize. You will never again get a truly single player game, there will always be some sort of soft paywall to use mods from now on. Welcome to the wasteland suckers.
---
Further, if you follow the trends with EA and ATVI you can reasonably predict their pops and drops on a seasonal basis as has been the case through most of the current bull market.
---
You might not be wrong but I'll be really surprised if server stability is increased by anything that was released in this patch.
---
Workshop ownership is not preserved...
---
&gt;All character progress you and your Friends make, including C.A.M.P. placement, is saved as the world shuts down - the same as when you leave your game from a Public World. Private Worlds are not persistent
---
So you just keep your gear, stash and C.A.M.P. Everything else gets wiped when the server restarts.
---
I have no idea what you have been doing with 900 hours of your life (nearly 40 full days.... let that sink in) on this game in its current state. What do you do exactly?

You couldn't get the Maxson outfit without buying the special atom bundle either, and some other outfits in similar deals. The price for a month is about the same and you get to keep the outfit and emotes when the sub runs out so it's not like purchase only outfits are something new. Caught in the crossfire I guess.
---
Read rule 1 of the sub.
---
Maybe they thought:
---
"Wait a minute, The Outer Worlds can be bought for $1, let's offer a better deal for Fallout 76!"
---
The game probably has to be funded for sever stability and future updates. The people working on the game have to be paid. I see these high prices as desperation tbh.
---
You check that helmet for mold?
---
He did not apply logic or reason, he just made an open air question. I actually did so in my answer to his comment, I cant also wait to hear back from you. Unless smarty pants comments is all you can come up with.
---
No, I'll let it die along with this game. 😴
---
You said, in your own words, that you were a "consistent atom purchaser." It came across that atoms were your main concern from that point forward. 
---
Before I go any further, let me ask some questions.
---
How familiar are you with games as a service?
---
Have you played any live game with a f2p option plus a subscription based option?
---
Have you ever played an MMO with a subscription fee?
---
I'm curious, because it's common practice in MMOs/live games to give more utility items to paid subscribers. Double XP, storage space, extra crafting items, etc. are common perks for subscribing. I dont see any difference in utility items being offered in ESO subs to Fallout 1st. Hell, your $15/month in WoW just gets you access to the game, nothing else. 
---
I get feeling like the wool was pulled over your eyes. The period between announcement and launch wasn't honesty from the developer in the slightest, and we've watched them roll back statement after statement about what wouldn't be going on in the game. By all means, vent your frustration. Please stop name calling, and being rude to others on the subreddit. We aren't the ones who lied to you about what the game would and wouldn't be.
---
You are completely correct,it is terrible what they are doing. I pre ordered the tricentennial but cancelled about 5 days to lunch after some bad reviews where on YouTube. Got my copy for £5 now. I only started getting into the game a couple of days ago and now this.
---
Sicking. Bud.
---
Which would be completely valid concern of theirs if they allow a character to play on a private server, cheat a bunch of stuff and then populate public servers. A lot of games you can't exactly transfer character from different worlds like you could here. Minecraft for example doesn't need to be concerned because the character is tied to that world and can't transfer to another. So i get why they won't give us the hosting tools
---
And if anyone knows of any for PS4 players that would be even better.
---
Tell that to people playing on ARK ...
---
Agree.....  
---
Ironically I know more than a couple people who ended up quiting '76 not due to bugs but how "lucky" they were, had everything in spades a couple months in, gave away TSE's (before the nerf) because they had so many, etc.  
---
They got bored
---
In the long run? In the long run trading legendaries will always yield more than trading junks, you cannot even find someone who would trade legendaries for junk, well, perhaps something that caps can buy, but you can never hit that trade only level. With the absurd amount of time to get enough junk for value equal to legendaries, it's doubtful this feature would be of use to anyone under this context.
---
Even with the scrapbox, you'd just free up some space from mules you have for equipment, and boi you'd still have to farm stuff that are of value if you are to gain such little advantage as you said. And if you have that many stuff that is of value you don't need the scrapbox, you can get anything you want already.
---
10USD would of made more sense that I agree. And some people haven't racked up the hours because its fun. Some people are still playing because they hope it'll eventually be fun. Hours doesn't mean its good etc. It means by most that people are still clinging to the hope the game will improve.
---
They are super popular and they are dying are very different things
---
I'm not trying to be combative at all but I don't really see how unlimited junk items provide an in game advantage.  Can you please explain to me why this is p2w?
---
my guess is that there will be a third (and maybe fourth) map shift.
---
THEN they will start rotating them.
---
I doubt very much they will start a rotation until they have all the maps added that they ever will.   more people would be upset if they started rotating, then stopped for 3 months to feature watoga instead, then rotated again, then stopped to feature berkley, etc etc
---
Maybe if it was a one time package thing it would be better. Not 12 a month..
---
I don't think it's the NCR armor, likely the desert rangers.
---
Not defending, bethesda this is till clearly bullshit
---
The only people still playing are the ones who can at least stand this. Besides, it's not like griefing is even a thing anymore
---
Only if you donate $10 a month to charity as well. Feed actual hungry children instead of just Bethesda's overstuffed executives.
---
I’ll try once the servers are back
---
And yet you still had to pay all that to keep playing. A new farming method or raid boss isn't drastically altering the game.
---
I'm gonna guess alot tonight, by the end of the month probably at least half of the population.
---
Best thing about these polarizing updates is that it will weed out a lot of the entitled toxic people as some will actually follow thru with their dumb quitting threats
---
And some games work on PC too. At least minecraft does.
---
Wow, I was deciding to come back and start playing again because I saw private servers where coming. I had no idea we had to pay a subscription, that's fucked up.
---
My concern isn't the subscription fee, I'm free to choose to not pay it.  My concern is how much of the Wastelanders update will be locked behind that paywall.  I'm wondering if they delayed it for exactly that reason.
---
Comment of the day.
---
And what exactly is the POINT of a private server if they don't support mods YET?!?
---
HMMM? It's not like your CAMP persists outside of you being logged on. So you don't need to protect yourself from griefers. And you can always just hop on with your friends whenever you want.
---
So other than a way to milk $100 a year from the people who've stuck with this game, what do we get exactly?Oh, besides a delay on the Wastelanders expansion which is what we were ACTUALLY WANTING!!!
---
Hey everyone, fyi outer worlds is coming out soon and it's made by a company that actually gives a fuck.
---
I'm ok with the subscription, as long as this game gets supported just like eso does. More maps and content every year.
---
That usually works, but every now and then the marker seems to be off by a couple feet, or the bag is hiding under a corpse.
---
Prime example of Fallout 76 fanboy right here, gents.
---
With how many people are lining up to buy it I doubt they will notice
---
Wow you're hard and such a comedian 👏👏👏
---
Unless I'm missing something, they are doing free DLC.  Did I miss something that only subscribers gain access to the DLC?  
---
We knew that the "private servers" were going to be a paid model to begin with, the big contention I see is with the scrap box and the tent.
---
Do you use thr quest marker?
---
&gt;getting embarrassing
---
Meh
---
I have heard rumors it was a bit short, but watching a stream of it this morning it looks like a lot of fun. It really is New Vegas in space.
---
Damn, that's dissapointing, maybe I'll give dwarf fortress a spin then
---
Jokes on Bethesda, their marketing department just killed the game, bye bye base and anyone with a few brain cells left.
---
&gt;For me winning in this game is spending more time playing the parts of the game I enjoy and less time farming to be able to do so. I win when I get a legendary for example. I lose when I need to go back to my base to stash resources.  
---
&gt;Every game needs to have a win condition, or at least  allow the player to create its own like Minecraft. Otherwise what would be the purpose of playing a game ?  
---
&gt;To sum it up, all games have a winning condition, its pay to win when you can give money to the developer to achieve it faster. This is the most basisc tenet of gaming design.  
---
&gt;Cant wait for your answer recognizing you got it, or providing an argument against mine.
---
TLDW: You forgot what laws are buddy.
---
They're not the same car, they've never been the same car. You pay more for a better specification car that can perform a whole lot better than our European standard Land Rovers.
---
You see, the laws are different depending on where you are. This is like me responding with "WELL WHY DOES IT COST ENGLAND 5X WHAT IT DOES AMERICA TO GET A LEGAL BIKING HELMET?" Because our laws are more strict on that matter. Simple.

 That is the one thing keeping you from playing adventure mode?  Weird hill to die on.
---
Sorry man I didn’t read this. TL;DR?
---
Everything’s pretty much been said... So I wanted to point out what an excellent short story your title is referring to. Everyone (bar those with weak stomachs) should give it a read. 
---
Edit: It’s a horror read btw.

[I Have No Mouth And I Must Scream. ](https://wjccschools.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2016/01/I-Have-No-Mouth-But-I-Must-Scream-by-Harlan-Ellison.pdf)
---
I dont understad why private servers even cost anything in gta online you can have a private server with your friends too why doesnt it work in this game
---
I can't believe there's people out here saying that they see themselves paying ONE HUNDRED DOLLARS A YEAR for this fucking subscription that Bethesda KNEW people wanted since before the release of the game.
---
This is why Bethesda does it, because y'all will pay for anything...
---
I'm very disappointed in some of you guys
---
Itll go down before it ever goes up, they put that up so people can't get butthurt when it drops  lower than what they paid.
---
Yeah, gotta tell the scorchbeast to hold on while I reload my weapon.
---
Take care!
---
I've more or less seen the inventory / stash having no effect on drops, my main (and unlucky) account only carries Vampire's weapons and loots them so infrequently I always stop and check them....  
---
Would be nice to see someone do another major sale event and track the returns w/ and without the perks / items..
---
Then why has there been a limit for scrap in the stash box for the last 10 months? There is only some much scrap the stash will hold. Junk weighs a lot in the stash box
---
[Microsoft Rewards](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/rewards) is  something you might want to look at. I haven't paid for Gold in years, and I have Game Pass Ultimate until March 2022. All you have to do is search on your phone and/or PC every day and earn points for free Gold/Game Pass.
---
OH SHIIIIIT I just watched the trailer too, heart skipped a beat there
---
👌👌
---
Today will be my last day playing heavily for a while. For months, she just watched , pretending to not be interested, i turn  and say , if you want to play you can. She's quickly look back down at her tablet " no I'm good" . Last night as I went to bed she started making a character and I knew . That my playtime will be cut down drastically going forward.
---
I hope this crashes and burns. This is a slap in the face and I hope they learn.
---
They gonna recieve a nice clean servers, thats it.
---
The fewer people on the server, the better server works. I noticed it due v94 missions.
---
Imagine comparing a Game Subscription Service Price to a Plattform Subscription Price. PSplus / XBoxLive is a Plattform Subscription, FO First a Game Subscription comparable to TESO Plus, WOW Gametime, SWTOR Plus, etc (which are all based around the same Price of 12-15 Dollars per Month).
---
Guess you’ve never played battlefield....
---
October 25th.
---
I agree, Currently at this stage, the membership gives us too little for what it costs, Nothing the membership gives will keep players who are quitting due to a lack of content and a feeling of being used. I do also miss buying a game and it being complete, i don't think DLC or an expansion is inherently bad, its just slowly twisted it's self from being a way to add more content to the game you love, to selling you features of the game you had before for money, knowing very well most people will buy it, the season pass and even in some games the 2nd season pass
---
People's love for the Fallout universe is the only reason anyone's playing this game at all; the lore is pretty damn important.
---
He already has.
---
Look up the definition of pay to win instead of thinking you are clever, ill wait
---
Awe. Try again .
---
&gt;$60 game
---
&gt;does microtransactions right
---
You ok?
---
I don't know if Bethesda knows who their target audience for the game is anymore.  Between the Battle Royale mode, Survival mode, a story mode and the base game's "Adventure Mode", it's kind of reaffirming my lack of enthusiasm for this service.  
---
They seriously have no target audience for this other than the consumer be alive and have a positive cash balance in their bank account.
---
There's no nostalgia to peddle for any of the features they've put into this mode, so it's not for long time fans of the series.  No access to weapons, raids or any other battle-based draws that players might want.  No additional maps for Nuclear Winter so it's not for them.  What you're getting is $16.50 in scrip currency handed to you to spend at the company store, the ability to be alone and the ability to store unlimited junk.  It's like they just took top complaints and mushed them all together into a package deal regardless of who would be interested in it.
---
You know what would make a target audience care?  Targeted features for each subset of playstyle.
---
Just because they offer a service doesn't mean YOU, OP, should subscribe to it.  Service would imply value and right now, there is no value in their offering, only walls that serve to split the community further and devalue the stress we as consumers have been dealt with this broken game with no promise of redemption.
---
I think you and this community deserve better than having scraps thrown at us unapologetically and insisting we pay for it.
---
I'm tired of Games as a service for actual individual games.  It doesn't work.
---
I have a feeling none of these people understand servers or development at all. You’re absolutely right btw. Not sure why you’re getting downvoted. 
---
As a person who runs servers all day as my job, you absolutely can’t compare a game like FO76s server needs to MC. That’s just ridiculous.
---
This is the same exact mentality I have! I haven’t spent a cent past the $80 on this game because it won’t be accessible one day, and probably sooner than we think. It’s a morbid way of looking at things, but one day this game will die and all of your content will be gone. Just like life lmao
---
Salty?
---
&gt; Also I would like my camp to stay and workshops too
---
this was my expectation.
---
if im paying for a private server, i want all the workshops in the game to never reset.
---
considering "Robot Armor" is a rare Armor drop that was a little odd...
---
OK, I just can't see playing this game at all if PVP is all you enjoy.
---
Shills gonna be shilling
---
Yeah, but it’s the principle. Why should I feel like I’m not getting the most out of the game if I’m not paying $100 a year? The servers I understand. But the other stuff? Come on now.
---
&gt; Elder Scrolls Online asks a subscription fee but still offers a TON of content if you just choose to pick up the game for $5 at a local GameStop and skip the fee. 
---
You mean like how you can go buy Fallout 76, play it and all future DLC free with an optional premium service?
---
Well, this is the nail for me. I will not be pre-ordering anymore Fallout games. I will always wait for the review....and possibly skip the next Fallout game all together. This is a sad day for us.
---
The day people post identical whiney  b**** posts
---
Games gonna be a let down too but ok lol
---
&gt;that has barely content to justify the cost of subscription
---
You are being **far** too kind. This game does not have anywhere near the content or level of updates to justify a subscription.
---
Who the fuck is playing this everyday though? Most everyone moves on to other games monthly, why would you justify wasting your money on a subscription for a game with NOTHING to do
---
You’re getting nothing free. That’s included in the overpriced price.
---
This game being the dull, dirty stone. 😂😂
---
Agreed - i just referred to it in the singular as i recalled a specific post - i see the sentiment is the same for them all.  
---
It'd cost them nothing to credit a few individuals or even just the fans, whatever, etc.   
---
It seems counter intuitive to take a community generated concept, give it to the community but do so behind a paid feature. This is a similar but worse version of the Fridge.
---
You realise that having 9,000,000,000 junk has the same effect on servers as having 9,000,000,000 .45 ammunition on the servers, right?
---
The '900 hour' user you mentioned posted multiple times about how he managed to get his items, and shown pictures of his stash and exact amounts of ammunition (which, may I add, weren't extremely excessive. 4,000-10,000 of each ammunition at 900 hours isn't shocking).
---
In fact: Here's the exact post the user created explaining how he farmed his ammunition: https://www.removeddit.com/r/fo76/comments/arineq/900_hours_played_my_favorite_farming_locations/
---
When at any point in that post did the user get "confirmed as a duper"? A Bethesda employee replied with a sarcastic comment, got a moderator to delete the message and left the user banned from both the fo76 subreddit and the game.
---
They're down
---
First, the subscription is not mandatory.  You only pay it if you want a private world. 
---
Second, you've deliberately misused accounting to inflate your costs.  It's like saying that you spent $28,060.00 for a concert ticket worth $60 because you decided to buy a new car before going to the concert. That's not how it works. 
---
Look, its fine to complain about private worlds having a subscription but using high cost choices that you made to justify it comes across as a bit silly.
---
* Scrap Box with infinite junk storage = massive stockpile
---
* Private servers with uncontested workshops = massive junk generation potential
---
* Secondary fast travel = faster/cheaper farming of high volume junk areas
---
1 month of farming on a private server could stuff that scrap box full for several months worth of repairs. How is that not a paid advantage?
---
I agree with what you've said, I can see the appeal for people who have friends they'd want to play on a private server with, but there's simply not enough content for this to have any appeal..
---
If this came with the wastelanders update, it would make more sense. Maybe mods will come soon and it'll be worth more.
---
If this is a slap then the release ordeal was being Bethesda's pegged buttslave. These players are still after that, so they'll gobble this 1st premium thing up.
---
Here’s the thing. It’s easier to patch the bugs later because a complete game at the start would delay release and cause more debt because you would have to keep paying the employees without getting any new income.
---
&gt; "And to say, the Atomic shop is cosmetic stuff. To make sure folks understand--look there's a line. There are people who have crossed it, but we're going to stay on the right side of it in terms of the things you can spend money on and how this stuff works." ~ Pete Hines
---
Uhuh, whatever you say Pete.
---
Thank you whales for supporting such atrocious and alarming monetization schemes. Without you Bethesda wouldn't have funds for creating other ways for making more money.
---
I more pissed the servers are still down.  Dgaf about luxury items.
---
Don't forget YOOONNNNGGGG OUT
---
He is an idiot, but you’re gonna pay again for a game you’ve already paid for. Meanwhile: he can sign up for Xbox GamePass ultimate, get 100+ games, and that Other Worlds game... for the same cost that your skin p2w shit will cost.
---
Info: I dont play anything Fallout anymore, some of your posts made into my feed and thats why I’m here.
---
What we get on the private server is how the game ought to play already. I'd pay five bucks a month for it. Fifty for a year. We already paid sixty dollars, more if you got the subpar special edition, or fiasco edition. It's brazen to assume - for all of 76's continued problems, and the recent going back on their promise of never allowing the ability to pay for in game progress/bonuses - that makes the premium pricing model: yet another bad look.
---
You do you. I paid for runescape for years. Who am I to judge? Stop expecting so much from people. I don’t know how to simply explain that they didn’t ask you for your input. Bethesda is going to go what Bethesda is going to do. As is Blizzard and Bungie. 
---
Even at a young age when I spent money that want mine in cosmetic skins and shit, I eventually began to see that it was all for nothing. Jagex sure got a lot of money out of me while it lasted and that’s kinda the root of the problem. 
---
Gaming has shifted to a money grab. And it’s tougher for the consumer to make better decisions. Gaming used to be a save haven from the bullshit if the world. Now, someone left the window open and we are invaded my this shitty business practice.
---
I also want it just for the ranger outfit and then won’t get it again, I could not give less of a shit about their unlimited junk box and lonely private servers
---
To be fair it's meant for multiple play-throughs and apparently it's around 25-30 hours or more depending on play style, I know I will at least play through it twice(One corporations character, one rebels).
---
Playing this now is a vote for this kind of business practice in games. You are literally hurting the industry.
---
U know defiance went f2p after every bought it they gave ever1 a month of there sub service for free although this isnt f2p its still a somewhat similar situation
---
You are wayyyyy out in left field buddy. Now that components have to be stored separately to take advantage of the unlimited storage, if anything it will make duping harder. They just took away one of the biggest methods people had for crashing servers to duplicate weapons and armor.
---
Just accept it, or move on. The free ride is over. If we want this game to keep improving and get fixed, we have to invest in it. Not just whine and scream about all of life's "unfairness"
---
That would be a good idea but maybe too niche for just a single event? Facebook is probably your best bet for real time events like this
---
Exactly. It mostly pays for itself and yes in a perfect world all games and everything included would be free but we don’t live in a perfect world.
---
Yes. Just start with one month and than when you get used to "not managing your junk" it will be very easy to you to play without this subscription .
---
Man, I would love to be so well off that I have over $380 to just throw away on a sub par game run by greedy developers
---
Just as I was trying to get back into this game, they release this crap. It’s safe to say that Fallout 76 has become worse than Call of Duty ever thought about. And that’s sad. What a pathetic, scummy attempt at a cash grab. And the things you get aren’t even close to being worth $13/month. The audacity to release a yearly subscription really baffles me, as well. As if this game’s life cycle will last another year.
---
Yes, but what I mean by vendor is trading, as I said elsehwere I use /r/meerkat76, discord, and facebook trading groups to trade off legendaries I don't need that are worth anything more than scrip. Otherwise they are scrip food.
---
Bitch, I aint buying shit nor leaving so tf u mean for the people wearing this new outfit? I want shit as well😂😂
---
In all honesty I thought the private servers were going to be waaaaay more. Look at battlefield... 12.99 for 1 month is too much for children asking their parents for money 🤷🏻‍♀️
---
Says the guy who browses BBW porn on Reddit... ouch
---
It's a PR Disaster of a company, that's why. Sometimes it looks like they're running some sort of experiment about how much a fanbase can take with this game. They are Vault-Tec and this is the real experiment running on Vault 76...
---
r/lostredditors
---
Good riddance lol.
---
The infite cap stash is worth 120 euro to you?
---
For only 1 year?
---
hows that "canvas bag" treating you?
---
Yeah you peasants. I am leasing out land in my private server- you must grow 200 pounds of corn a day or you lose your land tho
---
Probably not scrap to make 5.56 ammo though, since that's also used as a currency.
---
For like a month sure
---
Public Worlds too.
---
You have a good point
---
So, I paid for Beta, I play the game often and like it. I've always been a Fallout fan. But now... To "win" I need to pay $17 a month (Canadian) . I have already had enough of the lies, not gonna be pay to win.. but that is out the window now. Outer World's??? Perhaps.
---
You don't honestly think it would take a company as large as Bethesda more than a week to throw together promotional imagery or arrangements for payment, do you? It's not like this is one guy in a garage or a couple friends working in their parents' basements here. There's a whole department that just does marketing stuff. They also already had payment organization set up since they do transactions for Atoms and whatnot. All of this likely could have been set up in a day or two, let alone a week.
---
Ik but some people held it. It had highes and lows. But nots officially broken through the half pipe. I've never seen a low this low.
---
Another thing to keep in mind is this is a TEST server. Maybe the early adopters get it first. But I'm sure stuff like that will make it into the game. It has it's problems yes. But I feel like this is entirely manufactured rage since the info has been ours to parse through since Gencon. I'm only trying to take a rational approach to this
---
Why wouldn’t he at this point, they’re feeding material to the guy
---
Haha the nukes weren’t the only bombs to drop today
---
Then i'd drop the console.
---
We received some concerns about the post's vote count spiking after the announcement went out, causing people to suggest that there was nefarious voting afoot to cover up the outrage over the new subscription offering.
---
Wanna play some destiny?
---
Sup Birthday Bud, I hope you have a great day!
---
What makes this even  nuts is that 100 dollars a year is the discount. 
---
If you pay by the month its 155.88 a year.
---
And the junk box should really be in the base game to take pressure off the stash limit issue.
---
Right after a delay to wastelanders. 
---
This isnt a good look.
---
Who still uses caps as money? End game traders use 556 rounds, no limit on ammo.
---
Today a line was drawn between Fallout 76 fans and Bethesda fans.
---
You can no longer be both.
---
Nah, I like 1650 free along with the other stuff. They pay me in the long run.
---
Yea junk doesn’t really give a pvp advantage at all in my opinion and private servers without friends will get old fast
---
Honestly, I'll be subscribing for a month to snag that sweet sweet NCR Ranger armor, but more than likely I'll be holding off my monthly donation until we get a substantial content update that justifies paying for end game.
---

---
In addition to it being cheaper, the subscribed account can act as the designated "scrap mule"
---
Raid the map for everything with your team. Transfer scrap to the subbed account, and disperse scrap to your crewmates as needed.
---
More games will be out after that, which I'll also play.
---
Then get off this sub
---
Agreement to not purchase another Bethesda title till they get their act together.
---
Why are you on the sub then idiot
---
Probably ﻿going to. Pretty much taking a break from 76 until wastelanders comes out, ran out of things to do.
---
Difference is that they’re marketing this game as an MMO and with the asking price of $100, they’re acting as if 76 is a higher end game worth spending that much on. It’s utterly insane imo.
---
Again someone else missing the fucking point, The point is they said this couldn't be done as it would make servers unstable, it frees up space for payed players in their stash and there by allowing payed users to carry more essential equipment on their person. it essentially gives them the ability to carry what they want without having to go back to their stash.  No one that is semi reasonable is mad about the servers having a cost they are mad that payed players get the benefits for in essence a larger stash because its not holding junk anymore and also they don't have to carry as much on their person since they can fit more in their stash. I dont know what game your playing but everything takes junk to make fixe 60 percent of my stash is junk since many of my perks make armor and weapons i use weigh nothing. So get your head out of your ass if you dont think its pay to win.
---
So sell expansion packs.
---
It’s kinda like hey give us all your money now and we promise Wastelanders will be worth it. Do this after Wastelanders and maybe I’ll think differently.
---
Oh I'm not. If I wanted to play a mobile p2w game I'd get one.
---
All to you for getting something you want, you're kind of aiming for something in the middle. But I feel that is their exact intention; offer something ludicrous and gauge the reaction and then aim somewhere in the middle that's still profitable for them, but still deemed *acceptable* by a portion of the player-base, which in turn will argue *for* them and make their additions look less out of nowhere.  
---
It's an incredibly insidious thing to do, when you work it out on paper and in the context of deceptive framing. It's quickly become their rhetoric, piled on even more by the cosmetics-only decision they touted then retracted. They feel confident that they can introduce more with less, because people do let them keep pushing-- when the pushback is too much, they back off only a few feet and plant their flag.
---
Todd Howard has been a liar since the start.
---
You do you.  I'm buying a year as soon as I get home this evening.
---
Not looking for a game that works to drastically alter.  WoW adds content regularly, there's SO much stuff to do if you like the content (that's another whole argument though).  If WoW got nothing else right, it does give you more than enough things to do to keep you entertained for thousands of hours.  And ever expansion adds hundreds and hundreds of hours more to the mix.
---
Hell, I quit playing because I couldn't come close to keeping up with it all.
---
Oh you know what, it's probably that one is GamePass for PC only, one is GamePass for Xbox+PC, and one is Gamepass for both+Xbox Live. The both+Live is called Gamepass Ultimate, but I guess the other 2 are just called Gamepass so it's confusing.
---
PC-$5, Xbox-$10, Ultimate-$15, maybe because there's more games available to play on the Xbox version than the PC version, since I'm pretty sure it's the same catalog and not all of them have ports for both.
---
If you have Xbox Gamepass already, I believe you can play on PC though, so maybe they sell the Xbox version for more some places but it's listed as PC and no one notices, but the PC subscription wouldn't carry over to Xbox. Just guesses here though.
---
I wouldn’t mind but most people would be angrier
---
Too bad they are off during the holidays.
---
Shouldn't be much longer, hopefully within the hour.
---
🤣🤣
---
the problem shouldnt be unlimited stash scrap space for dupers though, it should be terminating the dupe glitch at its root.
---
I respect your position. There are many opionions out there. That is what makes a free country great. However, the crying and whining are not appropriate ways to make a case. A server is a good idea if you want to play on your own terms, and therefore pay to do so. There are many people with not so good agendas making comments and making the game less fun.
---
To me, having unlimited scrap means I essentially have unlimited ammo, unlimited ability to repair my guns and armor, unlimited ability to craft anything.
---
Now my stash can be used for just storing tons of weaponry and gear and no longer needs to be bogged down by holding resources so I can repair or craft ammo so I can go enjoy the game (holding resources means I need to stop playing the game and go back to grinding (not necessarily bad)). Now I can literally pay to pretty much never have to grind again, because instead of thinking about if I need that roll of ducktape, I can just yolo pick it up and know I'll have space for it always and that at some point the scrap will be beneficial and give me the win.
---
Now since I'm spending less time grinding and collecting resources then other people I can experience non-stop action, meaning I will get more legendary weaponry, better gear, etc. etc. Meaning I have a clear advantage over other players because I spent $100/yr.
---
Wow you are so funny well done
---
Thank you for explaining it to me.I am surprised i have never heard of this before now.
---
People like you are making this an industry standard.
---
Agreed, paid private servers hold more than 8 players. Hell they should hold more than 24. This is just blatant cash grab and I'm not buying into it.
---
The ranger outfit tho
---
You forget, anything that they release is p2w. Well according to some on here anyway.
---
Exactly. Unsurprisingly, each game has its own independent needs, client side and server side.
---
Also, I know you already know this but I’ll put it here for others to read:
---
The more specs a server requires, the higher the cost. For people talking about VPS/cloud like GCP and AWS, just remember you’re not just getting charged for the machine, but all of the network ingress as well. A simple Linux server can actually end up costing hundreds (even thousands) a month. The costs always fluctuate depending on the usage.
---
Where did they say this?
---
That’s not what I’m trying to say here. The game was promised as being subscription free with continuous free updates for all players. Numbers aside, that doesn’t bother you?
---
Yikes, no. I don't know where even to start... I planned to come back to it because I believed the game could only improve, but now this, time for boycott I guess.
---
Psht... I play Anthen. That's child's play LOL! At least you still have a roadmap LOL!!!
---
I think they dropped it to break up the server population for Wastelanders and give people that single player experience.
---
This argument doesn't hold a lot of water. Just as many games that make you pay or in some cases for console players you need a whole other system dedicated as a server.
---
For one month of first,  you get the outfit, emotes, and 1650 atomic points.... just pay for the month then cancel lol. Literally getting $16.50 in atomic points plus all that other stuff... a steal.
---
Oh ya. I just uninstalled too.
---
But there giving out atoms every month as well unless ur saying there gna raise the average price of shop items too
---
No idea, my friend. Sorry.
---
but in "MMO",which FO76 is NOT. there is a steady stream of updates and content. not to mention in most cases the content is finished when released.  i pay for ESO+ (Zenimax) bc i feel like i am getting a good deal with all the dungeon packs and dlc chapters included. 1000's of hours of content. and that is after i spent $60 day one for it. F)76 doen't have enough to even warrant a $60 purchase let alone a subscription. i hope this cripples the game and puts Bethesda back down to size.
---
That you don't have to buy...
---
It’s just immature children being immature children lol
---
Not defending beth but its not unlimited gun space, subscribed or not you still only have 800.
---
I freely admit that this is kind of stupid, but it's mildly amusing to me right now that at $13CAD for 1000 Atoms, it makes a single Atom's value at roughly $0.7692CAD.
---
Proud to be a paypig. Welcome to 2019 we're at peak pants on head.
---
Agreed.  Select people with unlimited scrap in public servers...what could go wrong??
---
They lowered the weight of a lot of items for display cases to fix this issue.  It's in the patch notes.
---
Now everything the playerbase wants will be behind the paywall. Want a higher script limit? Exclusive Fallout 1st feature. Want bigger camp budget? Exclusive Fallout 1st feature. Things not working with the purveyor? Buy a loot box for 1000 Atoms for a guaranteed 3* legendary. Want to play Wastelanders content? Sorry, pony up because it's only for Fallout 1st paying customers.
---
I paid $80 for the Tricentennial edition, $60 for PS4 online sub and bought Atoms once when you got 1500 for $10. I'm going to cut my losses. Sad to say after defending Bethesda and this mess of a game. Just when I got a thriving trade business going too. Now I can't compete with the sub players. 
---
I would have bought extra stash for a one time Atom purchase. Now, I won't be buying anything because I'm done. And it makes me sad. I loved the Fallout franchise. Now I'm just sour on Bethesda. Had years of good times though. Everything and everyone dies. Today Bethesda died.
---
Because you'll be on a private server with far fewer people which means those fewer people can have more stuff?
---
Boring Borderlands clone? The only thing this and Borderlands has in common is they are both in first person and are shooters to an extent.
---
Dumbest thing I read today, lay of the crack and caps.
---
Wait. They will realize they dun goofed and drop server files
---
I think the scrapbox is a kick in the teeth to other players  by far.    Scrapbox should have gone to everyone.  So many people would be extremly happen and go right on hoarding.
---
$99 to win is a fair price. I'm sold
---
Bummer, downloaded the game last night and had today off, was looking forward to playing more today
---
May as well be a huge TARGET..lol
---
If you create a private game, you'll have less lag from what other people are doing.  So...yes, kinda.
---
You'll still crash.  CTD or the equivalent console crashes will be pretty much the same.  Server crashes will be a bit less frequent, as it's possible that some of the crashes are a result of other players breaking things (accidentally, or on purpose).
---
The bugs will be the same.  If they get fixed in the regular game, they'll be fixed for your private game (since they're exactly the same.
---
Keep in mind, whoever has the sub creates the private game.  If you crash, or log out, the world will disappear.  You're not getting your own private server or persistent game world.  You're just getting a regular game session that is locked up and no one can get in unless you invite them.
---
Do you honestly think a warning label stops anything or works...
---
They should have kept and improved Survival for sure, I suspect they felt like the team was getting pulled in too many directions and converting a game that the base of (FO4) was a single-player PVE was hard to balance while keeping it compatible with the coop PVE mode.  Ever having included PVP in the game outside of a distinct separation like NW was problematic.
---
Sadly I'm playing on a PS4 and the Playstation Now catalog isn't as great as the game pass on the XB1.
---
Hit me up with a Message (Not a Direct). I ask some Co-Workers tomorrow that evaluated a whole bunch of them and come back to you as soon as possible
---
The floor patterns are gorgeous but the wallpapers just melt your eyes.
---
F076 is the worst game to be hyped. NMS doesn't come close and that game is actually playable now.
---
Yes, because I am capable of even the slightest bit of nuance I am desperate for Todd to shit in my mouth.  Bethesda doesn’t listen to people in this sub because the prevailing reaction to everything they do is “DAE BETHESDA IS THE ANTICHRIST”. When everything from the price of pure cosmetic items, a completely worthless fridge and the price of a subscription service all get the same over the top reaction, there is no feasible way to sort through it and find meaningful criticism.
---
OHHH BOY DID THEY DO SOMETHING SPECIAL
---
Perfect timing to ask this question..... *sits back eats popcorn gif.*
---
Everything you stated Boss\_Zombie is purely either circumstantial or by opinion.
---
1. The instability of servers currently in use degrades mostly due to people on it and their activities. (yes this shouldn't be the case but it is.) a private server likely will not, yet to be seen so nothing factual can be said yet. Everything you stated Boss\_Zombie is purely either circumstantial or by opinion.
---
2. The idea of storing everything that isn't junk is because you have too much junk....
---
3. Now it's free
---
4. when has this not been the case for any other game
---
5. I love the atomic shop items
---
Like I said circumstantial or opinionated.
---
Time to play as Rodd Toward with max lying when outer worlds this friday
---
Please do. Support good practices and games made with a bit of soul. 
---
I cant believe what has become of the Fallout franchise. Hellish.
---
I wanted to download it on pc but windows store was like no because of not being able to update windows 10, but yea I downloaded on og Xbox one. I hope they changed windows store to be more flexible
---
THANK YOU THIS IS WHAT IVE BEEN SAYING! 
---
Sorry lol but really though
---
Edit: let’s not forget battlefield makes you pay for dlcs too... like people shut up holy shit
---
surprise attack from the Scorchbeth Queen
---
Yeah, I'm not against the new subscription thing, not like you HAVE to pay it to play. Mean it gives you atoms, junk storage, among other things. I'd get it today, if there was actually something to do in the game.
---
Lol 1650 free atoms and a server O gee wiz were do i sign. O wait i pay 15,00 a month for ESO+ get a unlimited storage craft bag and 6,000 crowns.  Far better deal.js
---
Last I heard, ESO base game was not free. Let alone the other chapters (Elsweyr, Morrowind, etc.). But even then, both the base game (standard and extra editions) and the subscriptions are available on Steam, with regional currencies and exchange *rates. As it stands now, 1st (1 month) costs the same I paid for the Tricentennial Edition when I preordered.
---
I know, Bethesda's not responsible for my country's economy, but man, they're making it difficult to buy stuff from them if you're not an American.
---
From the trailers, it looks more like Bioshock in space....
---
Mirrored my sentiment exactly. Just the servers alone at the same price would be fine. Locking gameplay features behind a subscription? How tonedeaf is their marketing department? The fix for this is easy, ditch the items and atom from the subscription.  It would actually be better if we never got the items at all.  
---
If I don't want a server, then it's a monthly subscription to Atom I won't spend because there isn't that much atom worth of new content per month. It's tone deaf AND a poor value, mismatched bundle.  
---
We were talking in here about the idea for a second small camp, awesome idea. If that's all I want then I need a monthly subscription?   
---
I feel so sorry for all the developers working hard on this, the game has been fantastic to actually enjoy. But the business and marketing team have the business accumen of a child with a crayon.
---
I have been batting for Bethesda this entire time, I have put in the hard yards for advocacy  because I really believe this is a great game. But this is just poor taste and shitty value.
---
What game are you playing where anything about your camp is tied to your stash space?
---
Hell, at least when Wildcard wanted more money they had the decency to give me an entire map new dinosaurs, and a whole new mechanic with wyverns. It's definitely a buggy, messy, half baked game. Yet, I can tame dinosaurs in it.... I may give it to many free passes just for that reason
---
Seventh
---
Also ESO is an MMO and already a huge game to begin with. This has been the standard practice with MMOs for years. I wouldn't really consider consider F76 an MMO.
---
I watched cohhcarnage and a viewer drop 300 subs in his chat. $1500 so some of those people can spam some more emotes, FOR ONE MONTH. GJ Jeff Bezos

I'm angry that Bethesda took a franchise I enjoyed and drove it into the ground but hey, thats happening to every franchise I enjoy these days.
---
Karen's 😂
---
Outer worlds take me home, to the place I beeeloooong
---
Probably right.
---
I'm not sure what there called. But whoever gave Bethesda money (I'm assuming for shares) wanted more profit. And I'm just guessing this is one of the ways to make them not sell there part.
---
If they offered this at half it's current price I would have not even thought twice about it and bought it.
---
I feel ashamed for ever suggesting the Forward Base/camp idea. I am sorry my community.
---
why thank you, it was nice to see someone agrees with me, wanted to provide some backup and my 10 cents. 
---
to your point Ferrari's are sexy but you basically have a beautiful shell and a very fast engine, the really fast ones used to not even have radios in them, but we pay millions for them not because their great cars to take our kids to school in, but because their fast af, sexy cars.
---
i may be stretching the analogy a little but oh well.
---
Bye. See you in wastelanders, the free content drop coming in Q1 2020
---
I mean, maybe, but it doesn't sound like it.  They're not taking away the outfit even after you stop paying.
---
I hope everyone is strong and avoids that NCR outfit. They’re literally treating you like dirt with that one. We ask for it for months, only for these gross, greedy sacks of shit to lump it in with their worst scam yet. Just remember, one day this game will die and with it, that NCR outfit
---
but it's not?
---
Why dose it take for hours for this fuck it up update
---
But How does it give an advantage?  you guys keep downvoting but keep failing to give a actual advantage that makes it pay 2 win....Storage space is literaly no issue for me so that item is useless and the camp thing dosent help you get an edge in gameplay.....Thats not pay to win.
---
With most games where you pay a to subscribe you can only use the extra perks you get I.e clothes storage skins if your paying when you stop it's no longer available to use I doubt this game will be any different.
---
Exactly, it’s Mass Effect meets Bioshock/Prey, less open world more story driven
---
i like how fallout 76 fans are like battered housewives
---
I will.  No problem paying for me.   But the scrap box is not cool in anyway  should be free for everyone in this update.
---
No.  [https://bethesda.net/en/status](https://bethesda.net/en/status)
---
There are still going to be a lot of people playing. The people that are rage quitting are the same people saying they're going to leave for months, and then you see them back in here complaining more about every single thing. And yet they're still here. The amount of people that actually leave? Probably not that high.
---
Weird. I wonder what I've been the system administrator of for the last 5 years then. Maybe all my certs in the IT field are just wrong I guess.
---
I don't see how that's even a point or relevant. You compared two services. One provides tons of content and currency to spend on a huge MTX shop. One provides maybe we will get around to it later in a content short game. Wonder which one i would pick?
---
My bitching can ruin the experience for others. I'll grant that.
---
As long as you also concede that apathetic acceptance of a shit product just encourages BGS to ruin the experience for others by releasing another shit product next time. 
---
And yeah, I'm subbed to this subreddit (not the game) because I have been a lifelong fan of the fallout series since it's inception. I want to see where the series is going, and how it's being treated by the people who own the right to make it. I'm subbed so I can bitch about shit decisions like walling private servers off behind a subscription. I'm subbed so I can bitch about obvious outcomes to shit decisions like effectively crippling modding potential by walling private servers off in the way that they have. I'm subbed so that maybe my bitching will convince somebody else to stop apathetically accepting a shit product so that maybe the next product will be less shit.
---
It's a massive cash grab. That's the thing about it. It is massively cash grabbing RPG.
---
I never mentioned Todd Howard at all. Whose comments are you reading?
---
Yeah it's 206.2...ayyy you almost got me!  
---
# (☞ﾟヮﾟ)☞
---
Is that scrap box also gonna stop me being one shotted in actual pvp or is it going to help me with generic pve problems? I still cant build a house better than yours because I'm still hindered by the same camp limit as you. Besides most people are gonna move to their private world to avoid being one shotted and to get the most for the money they pay anyway. I have a feeling your experience wont change much in the long run if you dont subscribe. This is just the fucking repair boxes all over again.
---
Kingdom Come: Deliverance is also on there if you never gave it a go, pretty great RPG once you get a couple hours in.
---
Truth in theory, but bethesda has done this (not to this level mind you) before with eso with the premium membership and players keep coming back.
---
These are the same people who pay for a movie ticket and then ask to see the manager because the popcorn, peanuts and candy are not included
---
They said "we will support the game as long as one person is playing"
---
This is them trying to stop everyone from playing it, so they can give up on it.
---
&gt; How the hell will that work when trying to load a camp into a public server?
---
In code: If player is member, then load bigger camp.
---
Not that hard to do really.
---
Multiplayer is still trash. Free roam is okay, PvP is god awful. I still think the game needs another title update to be good.
---
please reply to this so i can block you
---
imagine still playing fallout76 in 2019 lol.
---
As someone who already has their 1st subscription, you’ll be welcome in my world when it’s not full. My gt is IAmNukaBoy.
---
I see a lot of posts like these saying things have to be funded. You do realize that's what the atomic shop was for, right? If they actually sold good skins and stopped fucking their customers over I'm positive people would love to support them via atomic shop. Not to bring Fortnite into this but their cosmetic shop makes them so much money it's ridiculous, this game could honestly be the same way. I would happily spend money on an NCR ranger outfit and Fallout 3 weapon skins such as the DCG.
---
Two Zenimax games
---
Only for junk.
---
Stash space isn't changing.
---
$12 a month isn't squeezing anything unless you work at McDonald's lol
---
Rahter than just jump down your throat let me just explain to you  one outcome that will happen of you'll hear me out. Let's say i jump into my private server and farm lead,steel etc then proceed to craft 100k 5.56 using the junk and store an unlimited amount  and be able to store my unlimited amount of junk then hop into a public server and sell my 100k 5.56 in my player vendor for caps and be able to do so indefinitely since i can store an unlimited amount of junk. It creates a market flux as the lets say "premium players" who can store an unlimited quantity of junk will then proceed to sell their stuff ie ammo, bulked junk at a far cheaper price since they have no restrictions on how much junk they can store Well thats my worry what do you think?
---
Tell me how it is... Im iffy only because I am already dedicated to a few games...
---
Breeding/murdering sheep in Ark and doing unspeakable horrors in Impossible Creatures and Age Of Empires...
---
You don't get my point do you? I'd make it plain.
---
This game is so mediocre that it lost a lot of players' confidence in the studio and the game. What they should do is to fix the fucking game and regain players' heart, instead of trying to grab more money with subscription.
---
You only subscribe to good things. And they trying to selling a subscription is like they are saying the game is good. But the game is mediocre at best. Most (if not all) players are here just because it is a Fallout game.
---
Alright man enjoy standing under the scorchqueen holding a button down for five minutes in a shitty game barely held together at the seams while paying a premium for the privilege. Fuckin idiot lol

Its seen in the Fallout 4 intro during a ww2 period, but wasn't invented until 2044.
---
EDIT:( that's just the example I know of, but I think jet is also broken, and ghouls needing to eat/drink)
---
 Separate the scrap-box and survival-tent feature and add them to the atom shop so they can be earned in-game! These are game altering mechanics and should not be accessible only through a paywall.
---
Bye console peasant.
---
This game is good, and I have defended it to vociferous disagreement..
---
But this is too much. Im extremely concerned for Starfield and ESVI
---
Relax, it’s just video games
---
That's understandable, and you're not wrong either. I don't think we're flat out saying it's not doable. But do you expect a layman to put that all together successfully? We all do this professionally and from day to day experience, most clients I deal with don't even know how to clear their browser cache.
---
Is someone going to set up a physical server at home for FO76? Speaking for myself, it's not worth it.
---
Also, just because a gamer built a PC doesn't mean they'll know how to troubleshoot a server with an OS they've never touched before. Just because it may be more obvious to you, doesn't mean it is to everyone.
---
I'm not trying to act elitist here because I am in no position to do that (as I stated above, I'm a hobbyist when it comes to servers) but oversimplifying it isn't helping much either. I'm just trying to be a little realistic here.
---
But it's warming what do you mean it makes it colder, warming doesn't make it colder this is fake
---
But it's a mmo there is no way to win, what do you mean this is pay to win this is fake

The stability and bug fixes aren’t exclusive to private servers though..?
---
Oh the private servers will run smoothly.. you are talking about the peasant servers clearly.
---
Only time will tell what really comes up with the addition of the scrapbox.
---
I mean again, less open world, 2 companions more akin to mass effect, POV as in first person? Lol. And weapons in most games are pretty similar same with weapon types if anything they’re more bioshock/Star Wars I think, and armor is yes like 3 and NV
---
I'm not missing out beacuse I don't care about that game
---
The psychological tactic is that the masses are too fucking poor from playing video games so they want to be spoon-fed more free video games and dopamine at zero cost to the fat building up in place of their muscle.
---
These guys are at least one of three things, but likely a combo of 2-3: trolls (maybe), idiots (highly likely), Bethesda employees (better than average chance)
---
Yeah, 100%. This sub isn't the entire player base. You've got /r/fo76filthycasuals plus the people that don't even use Reddit plus like I said the protectron and fridge are super common in game
---
For me it's that I'm young and work minimum wage, I have a partner and a child to provide for and a house to pay for, I cant afford to pay a subscription no matter how cheap it is, since its selfish for me to pay that on top of the wifi bill and ps plus I already pay, when that could go on much better things, it's annoying that a company who have brought out incredible games with no necessary microtransations or subscription, to fall into the same system as every other company, it's going to be impossible to play more than one game at once soon, as itll cost like £/$15 a month to play a single game
---
That's assuming Wastelanders will even be free or will be a "Fallout 1st member exclusive".
---
Hey do you play on ps4? I think I’ve seen your name
---
What I need is the company I once loved to stop lying about what "the community" wants, and for the apologists to realize they are part of the problem. It's unrealistic, but I try to remain hopeful. Edit: btw, disappointment, and frustration are not rage, just so you are aware. I'm just extremely tired of this shit.
---
They are private and are already sitting on a pile of cash. But more money is more money. I'm not hating on them for it. Not sure if I will pay $100 but it could be worst I guess.
---
r/Democrats might edge out but pretty much yeah
---
The private server stuff carrying over is also a big thing. Farm workshops for junk and blueprints. Farm locations for legendaries and ammo. Etc. No direct or enviromental interruptions. Then go into adventure mode and the subs and sell all your cheaply earned goods for premium.
---
What mobile game even does this shit?
---
You are talking like they have no sales for old games at all or they don't earn shit from TESO.
---
That's great, but did they fix the issue where the loot in ash and goo piles disappears?
---
They could have made servers that would run on your personal computer. And if the server software itself is an un-optimized mess that can't run on a PC, for some odd reason. They could still allow it and we could rent a server from specialized game server service provider, and install it there. These service providers already offer "ready to go" servers with preinstalled software etc. and easily accessible controls for more casual gamers.
---
There would have been zero upkeep cost for the servers (for bethesda) and a whole lot more happy customers. Bethesda could have even sold the dedicated server software as a separate product (so the service providers AND customers have to pay for the software). But nope, they gotta try and squeeze a ridiculous amount of cash out of us, for servers that are NOT optimized for gaming (that is if they use the same Amazon servers they've used in the past).
---
Not having them is the issue and now behind a paywall, I mean the rest behind the paywall is the issues as well. Its now a pay to win game. Bethesda are history.
---
You're a fucking idiot!
---
PLEASE STOP GIVING BETHESDA MONEY! YOU'RE RUINING GAMING FOR THE REST OF US! FFFFUUUUUCCCCKKKKK!
---
Hopefully they’ll only be accessed in the private server
---
Noooo! Before  you go, spend your atoms on the new loot bag skins so we can find it easier
---
There it is. You just proved that youre too stupid to have a proper discussion and actually get off to the suffering of others.
---
Imagine using the 'f' homophobic slur in 2019. You're pathetic.
---
They use a small update to cover them adding garbage like this seemingly every time now
---
Buh bye
---
You may use my trash can. Toss your login details in with it, I'll dispose of your stuff.
---
Yeah I think a lot of people are jumping the gun on Outer Worlds just to stick it to Bethesda. I've seen a lot of comments like "Outer Worlds is a better Fallout than Fallout"
---
It's a relatively short game, the developers themselves have stated the game won't have massive diverging paths despite there being multiple factions. You play the same content just with tiny differences.
---
I don't care how many playstyles and weapons there are. It's a 30 hour first person shooter. You can only play the game so many times before you get bored. It's not like Borderlands etc  where you can grind all day or Fallout 3/NV/4 where you have 100+ hours of solid content to explore ontop of loads of different playstyles and choices/factions. Once you reach the end then that's it.

Dang, I've been waiting for nearly a year now for even a hint that there will be a redemption arc for this game and this is what we get? Wastelanders delayed for a $100 subscription to be implemented? At least its fitting that this was announced on the day that the bombs fell.
---
this this this.
---
would make the most sense and would get Bethesda SOME points back
---
Well apparently it works for RuneScape. Though their community has been in revolt for months now but this is definitely NOT the way to go! Wtf Bethesda?
---
you're actually buying it? wow.
---
I love how this sub always has an opinion on how other people should spend their money.  If someone else thinks it is worth it, who are you to call it frivolous?
---
Edit: corrected typo
---
World of Warships occasionally offers a 300 days of premium time for $40.  That's the best sub-type thing I've seen.
---
Chiefly because of the ever present notifications. I uninstalled.
---
Time to uninstall. I've really stood with this game through thick and thin.
---
I stayed when everyone left saying it was a buggy, unfun mess.
---
I stayed when Bethesda broke their promise of "cosmetics only." 
---
I stayed when bugs were *reintroduced* to the game.
---
I've stayed through all of that. I give up. You really messed up with this one.
---
think you forgot "not" in a couple of places pal...
---
Done what? provided content for money which is something fallout 76 will never do. The reason the sub on ESO works is because it provides content. The fallout 76 sub provides what? Some JUNK storage? lol ok. Once my camp is built why do i care how much junk im storing? I need to repair guns and armor and mod that's it. It's a useless service. You following me yet? And private servers with 8 people? hard pass. What's the point no one can really grief me anyway. Oh you can destroy my camp? big deal ill use all that useless scrap to fix it not even worth caring about lol
---
I don’t need or want any of that stuff so I really don’t care. Buy if you want it. Pass if you don’t.
---
Again, if you don't want to pay, dont.
---
This is the definition of free market.  Noone is forcing you to pay for a subscription to a private server.  It would be a different story if they all of a sudden added a subscription to the core game, which they did not do.
---
The playerbase wanted private servers, so they gave you private servers, now you are pissed you have to pay for a new feature.  Thats how business works. 
---
Also, if you feel it is mediocre, why do you still play?  Many of us play the game regularly because we actually like the game.  We arnt playing it because its a new fallout, we play it because we like it.  
---
Im sorry if you do not feel the same way, but to group us all together and claim we only play because its a fallout universe is biased and untrue at best.    We all dont feel the same way you do, or you would not see numerous posts every day with stories of "I had a great time, here is what happened".
---
This game touches people, differently than it may have touched you.  But to call us all fanbois and thats the only reason we play makes you sound no better than Antifa calling someone a racist just because they  have a different view.    Dont be the asshat of the fallout world by claiming to know other peoples opinions.   Because you dont.
---
Nope
---
This would have been something to introduce with the launch of wastelanders.
---
Launching it now,  when the game is in such a bare bones state is a really bad idea.
---
There's definitely worse out there for sure. But why are they able to put $100 houses in that game? Because people are buying them and it's making those kind of in game purchases ok. Which means it will continue.
---
What actual content are they charging for?  You know, like other games that charge for content expansions.  Oh right. Nothing.
---
At this point I'm not sure if it's fair to compare it to EA. Bethesda is doing worse 
---
I mean, yeah, they suck, but at least they backpedalled when they saw their schemes were awfully received (Unless Anthem or some other new game of theirs tried again, then never mind?).
---
Bethesda here seem like they're deliberately trying to kill Fallout with each new update
---
I will quit when the game gets F2P. I bought the game at the full retail price on day one as a loyal Fallout fan.
---
Perfectly fair to host a private server and the other bonuses. Good luck doing literally anything fun in the real world.
---
I'm on PS4 - thanks for the offer though!
---
See you tomorrow in Appalachia bro👍🏻😉
---
Players are dumb, companies are not your friends, real world is run by money.
---
Oh..... and you’re going to buy it anyway.
---
Tell us where Bethesda touched you.
---
You're blaming Bethesda for the fact that Sony/Microsoft have you bent over paying for their services in the first place?
---
I was doing melee with my main but went heavy guns because I got sick of, for instance, jumping with marsupial yet still getting hit by a lunging ghould despite my being 20 feet above him (Bethesda please fix this!). I also always had a problem with blocking, it seems like I could rarely time it right. It might also be partly due to my internet being on the slower end and my inputs aren't registering right? I do enjoy heavy guns though.
---
Lol
---
Simply pulled the gun waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaay too early.
---
Or give them a raise for all the money they just made Bethesda. 😂
---
Yeah, that really sucks. At least they are cheaper than Battlefield ones.
---
Given the low cost of the game currently, it's not far from it. Even in the PS Store it's like $23.
---
Bruh that's like £13 per month I would have spent on stuff I wouldn't have used. These days, I spend a lot of time playing 76. More than I spend watching Netflix. I was already forking out now and then for atoms and this sounds like a way I can support a game I care about and enjoy whilst also getting some stuff I think is cool.
---
Sorry it doesn't sound like something that you're into and I can totally see why. Doesn't mean Bethesda are gonna stop it
---
I bought ten years just to spite you.
---
Yes, because they are no longer in your stash.  It's not tracked as an individual inventory item anymore, its now stored as a value, like caps, which doesn't need to have a limit because it's just a single number, likely stored as a floating value ranging from 1 to  2,147,483,647.  My guess would be subscription accounts will have an unlimited caps limit soon as well.
---
Bethesda's new business model seems to be "Identify coding design stupidity, sell a solution." instead of actually fixing their game for everyone.
---
Troll.
---
Well, I guess Fallout 76 is dead in the water at this point.
---
WHY?! IS THIS! HAPPENING?!
---
FOR CRYING OUT LOUD BETHESDA!
---
The only thing I cared about was the private server.  No more people killing legendaries in front of me with a one shot, no more people trying to join my group so they can try to mess with my camp or start PVP with a friend, No more being level 30 and not being able to go to an area because higher levels were recently there and set the mob spawn in the 60s. 
---
I don't necessarily agree with the scrapbox and the tent being locked behind the wall, but the personal server is what I wanted.
---
I wanna host a server by myself with my friends with crossplay
---
Well I totally agree that a lot of the content they released has been super underwhelming, but while it has been bad, you can't really pick and choose what you decide is "true content" and what isn't. I can agree that it's bad content though, but still they have delivered content as promised..
---
I'm trying to find the Gencon panel. But I am 99% sure Bethesda has referred to it as a PTS.
---
I didn't contradict myself. You can host your own server. You can't do that with FO76. MC Allows that. How is that a contradiction? Do you... know what that word means? FO76 isn't allowing the same thing as MC because you can't make the server yourself. What....
---
Bethesda not allowing true private servers and instead making a monthly sub to have a "private" server is pure greed.
---
Edit: Sure, if they LET people have their own ability to host, it'd be like MC. They aren't. I bet they won't any time soon either.
---
Sorry but yea now you find no more points for argument and all of a sudden "only time will tell".
---
You should thank me for getting you head straight.
---
But we don't see anything like that here hrmmm
---
Bethesda employee says wut?
---
Byyyyeeeeeeeeee
---
They said the Atomic shop would only sell cosmetics, too.
---
If you were a longtime fan, please take the time to email Bethesda.
---
info@bethsoft.com
---
Just tell them directly how you feel about what they are doing. It takes 5 minutes, tops.
---
This complaint I agree with. I want to buy a subscription but I want my workshop status saved on a private world I'm playing solo on.
---
Otherwise it's not nearly as useful. Being able to stockpile unlimited mats and blueprint and rebuild each workshop every time I log is possible of course but isn't nearly as good as my build progress from last time still being there when I log on.
---
Good for you. I'm sure bethesda appreciates your visa ..err I meant loyalty.
---
Exactly. Sell Fallout for good.
---
Lol. I hear you. I keep checking in and hitting the xbox purchase link..... good luck when it finally comes online.
---
haha no, but a pricetag might
---
I disagree ... about the whiny bitch part. Again I'm sure bethesda appreciates your business. I'm sure theres a brony subreddit you could be posting in rn. Begone you wannabe troll thot.
---
Don't let the Vault door hit ya on the way out!
---
Too late, i've seen lots of people throwing their credit cards at the screen at the moment
---
Lol, im getting it. If I lika I support.
---
"it doesn't affect me, therefore it is not a problem" is kinda a shitty attitude to have, just saying
---
Not sure about that one bud.
---
It’s a fallout joke... in the games lore they dropped the bombs on this date.... go cry somewhere else milk drinker.
---
We all asked for those itens, but we didnt especify that we wanted for free, so, Bethesda put a price on it
---
17.99 + 15% tax = $18.14? Interesting.
---
I suggest you never pick up an actual mmorpg.  This is pretty standard stuff here.  I mean hell, Destiny requires you to buy an expansion every 4 to 6 months at damn near the cost of the base game.
---
I’ve loved the fallout series since the very first game when I was a single digit kid playing on my pops lap.
---
That said I absolutely hate the direction the gaming world is taking as a whole. So few companies release full and complete games I feel good about buying now. 
---
At least we can all breathe a sigh of relief with Todd announces Skyrim for your Tomagatchi coming fall 2020!!
---
I just dont get it, there are so many other games out there with continuous profit that arent sleazy pos's  and yet bethesda refuses to learn and drop this underhanded business model of getting paid to do almost nothing anyone is asking for.
---
Again, I said nothing about voicing discontent. Go ahead and do that as much as you want.
---
I believe you might need a day without internet. Maybe walk around outside a bit.
---
Muting you because you seem unstable.
---
that despite being full of bootlickers, this is unfortunately one of the last remaining Fo76 communities on the internet and you're essentially required to be a part of it if you want to keep up with news and information on the game.
---
if anything it says a lot about the state of Fo76 as a whole to be honest.
---
I think the idea is that while for right now you can jump back and forth between private and public servers, at some point they would probably have to lock you into one or the other.  This is especially true once we can start adding in mods
---
Pay to win now confirmed with 1st membership; they pretty much just threw all good will under the treads of their greed.
---
Yep! I already have it downloaded and ready to go on Friday!
---
Did you guys know its a trump owned company?
---
Shouldn’t be in at all, don’t buy into this crap people! Scammers!
---
That was my first thought also, but no. They are available to f1st in adv and private.
---
Hahahahaha Bethesda.. what a fucking shit show you have become.. I'm glad I didn't waste more than beta on this hot garbage.
---
I’m the troll? Look at your posts.
---
You’re just triggered.
---
Hay if you pvp players do a server you then will havr ur pvp server bk :p
---
Ill buy it
---
Lmao that video was awesome!
---
A relevant and informative reply. ;-)
---
Think about it like eso, shit at launch and becomes better every year.... Only Thing diffent between eso and 76 is eso became free and then added the Pay for convinience sub
---
No. I've seen countless threads about a single player \\ private server option. I've seen countless 'i need to stash more junk because i'm a hoarder' threads as well. They've offered a private server option for those who want it. Its what you wanted. The game was advertised as having PVP and there were always complaints about PVP and griefing and all this nonsense but it was NEVER advertised as single player \\ private server.  
---
Pay to Play.
---
I do have to agree a bit. I would re write it a little if it wasn't scummy to do that after it's been up for bit.
---
So you shit yourself. Good to know.
---
Well ain't that a kick in the head.
---
Someone's salty because their redundant thread is getting downvoted. Someone call the waaaaambulance!
---
;D
---
Yeah. They may be called something else though, idk.
---
It’s such a small advantage though. You tell me how you “win” this game and I’ll agree with you. I’ll wait... lol it’s just pay for laziness at best. You can’t craft anything that would put you in a crazy better position than anyone else.
---
Yeah, fixed that a few minutes ago when I noticed it. Didn't check what I was typing well enough.
---
A subscription where they're locking useful things and one of the most iconic outfits in the entire series behind a paywall. This game has so many broken promises attached to it that I just can't give it the benefit of the doubt anymore and keep thinking they'll actually turn around and make it something decent since all they've proved so far is that they're going full speed downhill.
---
Maybe I've just been doing it wrong, ha!
---
There are people on this sub who are gonna shell out the cash. There's also people who aren't gonna care either way and still play the usual way. Besides even if everyone went along with it, reddit is a v small amount of players, plenty of people will still be playing. So how about you just stop and don't worry if others quit? Trying to convince people is just showing that you know you're the minority
---
It's a year old. It would be in a better state if the fanbase didn't expect the developers to work on the game while living out of their car, leeching wifi from McDonalds. Those people have to make a living too, and the company has to make a profit. If not, you can kiss your shitty little game goodbye. It's never going to improve without a steady income stream that can't be subverted.
---
Is this supposed to be Irony that today is when the bombs dropped and also the day that FO76 died?
---
it's funny. i see a lot of folks complaining on here about folks complaining about bethesda/state of 76. but we are in the midst of a year and a half course correction by bethesda to try and answer the initial complaints about this game. complain directly to bethesda, and on redditt, and on youtube, and on twitter. they see all of this. they know that their base is now completely splintered. and for all the corporate apologists who say this is just business and they have to make a profit...it is 'demand' that should dictate profit, not corporate whim. so complaints and holding out from purchases help on all fronts. guranteed by the time wastelanders get here the private server cost will be 50% of what it is today.
---
yes there is a brony subreddit and i’m the creator, the mod, and all 100k members 
---
the amount of my little pony lore that is in my brain is incomprehensible. your mortal brain will never be able to understand my little pony like i do
---
They have shown themselves to be liars, to be incompetent, incapable, and motivated solely by greed. Do not purchase any more Bethesda products, they are trying to take advantage of you.
---
Lore was rigged from the start.
---
DLC stands for Downloadable Content, and they also said that no game-altering content would be sold for money.
---
I was one of the few downvoted hard for expressing distaste and distrust for Bethesda... 1 month after launch when we found out about the ATOM store b.s... 
---
Im glad i stopped playing months ago :)
---
Well how about a thank you? Someones gotta buy shit so you can still play and cry.
---
People still play this game?
---
and it scored 85% on metacritic!
---
Valid point
---
Ah you are correct my mistake.
---
I'd rather see tiered membership plans, I would happily pay 60-70 a year for access to the perks aside from cosmetics, atoms, or private server access
---
You can get all these answers in the patch notes.
---
Everything persists between Private and Adventure servers for a member. Both Scrap Box and Survival Camp.
---
You just admitted that peer to peer isnt a connection to a server. Lmao.
---
1: Not sure but I believe yes?  
---
2: Yes you can  
---
3: The Scrapbox can be accessed both in private and public servers.  
---
4: See above  
---
5: Yes on adventure mode, not sure with NW, I assume yes?.
---
Which we all know was complete bullshit.
---
Any utility items could have, and should have, been available in game.   
---
Bottle caps - not Atom Caps.
---
any idea on how to cancel?
---
$100 a year is nothing. If that makes or breaks you, you have bigger problems than this game. You need to reevaluate your life choices.

I'm not defending them. I do believe they crossed the line with the new update. I'm just saying that they won't really see much during the holidays.
---
No sir.  That bad omen is the log on screen you still let run on your computer.
---
Other items should also be stored as "just values and numbers".
---
That's called good backend server design.
---
Nine for me and one for u/lindstrompt

"Someone, somewhere, will buy it"
---
Not if you uh...."live" in New Zealand
---
How the player-base reacts to this will determine the future of ES and Fallout games. If it is tolerated, or worse still, embraced, then we can expect this business model to become the norm for all Bethesda games.
---
Can only speak to consoles but Ark Survival, Minecraft and Conan Exiles comes to mind. Folks aren't happy about it but those games also don't come with fan bases that were used to monetization free single player games so its not as crazy as here.
---
Aaaaahahahahahahahaha.
---
Nothing I need, just something I wanted badly, but I am not going to support a game that pulls this scummy tactic.
---
🤔👍
---
lol it me
---
Aaaaaaahahahahahahahaha
---
God it's so hard too. I've spent so much time making a fo76 base, character, weapons etc that I really love. I've got every award from every LTO event. I was SO excited for wastelanders and the halloween event. Not I can't even look at ny disc without feeling betrayed. Maybe I'll just suck it up and buy The Outerworlds or focus on MW
---
Look man, people will never learn. They will never understand that they are supporting this kind of garbage. They are enabling developers to do this shit.
---
We wanted private servers so we could have a thriving community on it. They said PRIVATE SERVERS! And we DID NOT GET PRIVATE SERVERS. 
---
The people who are ok with this will never accept that Beth fucked over reasonably large portion of their player base today. They buy it and play solo. They will not even look around see that they are paying people to take a shit on people.
---
Aaaaaaaahahahahahahahaha
---
Still waiting....
---
Its the best comparison to how the Private Worlds mode works not comparing the games beyond that both F76 and GTA Online use similar instance based servers they even manage the instance in a similar fashion... when there is too few people that instance closes and the players get merged into another instance.
---
So....they totally can raise stash space 800 (I think thats the current limit), they just dont want to?
---
MMO's are dying my ass, look at City of Heroes, within the first 3 months they had over 500,000 active players after they brought it back with the new private servers.
---
I find a whole bunch of stuff to do every day even when my friends aren't online. When they are there's never a dull moment or a time when I feel like there's nothing to do. I'm almost level 250 on my main guy and 75 on my alt. I still feel like I've got a lot I haven't even done yet.
---
Also saying this is a joke of a community isn't the most constructive way to get your point across.
---
The player base on this game is a fraction of Fortnite's. Fortnite could probably fund there game by selling merch. 
---
I honestly think the best thing they can do for this game is smooth of the issues with Nuclear Winter and make it completely free to play. It's actually a really fun BR. I could see people flocking to it and then trying out the main game.
---
having "I'm seriously trying to resist my urge to just buy it but my will gotta be strong." in your own post about how the subscription is a ripoff is comical.
---
so it's insane, but you want to buy it anyway, despite your post?  
---
this is how shit like this gets put in the game.
---
I think subscribers will disagree. It's increasing value for them.
---
Well we assumed they would honor the cosmetics only promise they said before launch so we didn't think we need to tell them not to shove non cosmetic items in the atomic shop. Jokes on us for assuming Bethesda is honorable.
---
Holy shit.
---
Hah, when you get there. Let me know what sort of heavy energy weapons you picked up. I must expand my collection. :)
---
Alright, so I'm a big fan of the lore, but ima actually have to say that the Ranger armor, aside from actually being called Ranger armor, doesn't break the lore. It was LAPD Riot gear from Pre-War that the NCR started using, this one is also pre war riot gear, and it also says CPD (Charleston Police Department) instead of LAPD. So as far as I'm concerned lore wise it's fine, but the whole exclusive subscription bullshit is not
---
Tell us when Bethesda bribed you.
---
Me too lol
---
Yeah. I’m not here to argue or justify their actions outright. I can see where people are coming from, and I wish games would go back to the 19.99 dlc drops every several months like the old days
---
Love how people freak out over something that’s completely optional
---
Its just riot armor? Its only lools like the ncr because its not hard to just put a duster over it lol.
---
This post sums it up nicely

why is this comment downvoted?

Is not a smart move to fuck with your customers tho

OHhhhhhh shhiiiiit! I can't believe they did that. My god that is scummy.

I literally run the raids everyday dude. So yeah, it is an experience I’d like to subscribe to... Lol
---
Gaming companies really want to compete for "Most Moronic Company".
---
*Arena Net is trying monetize Gear Templates, something most big MMOs have for free.*
---
*Riot Games is trying to monetize champion progression and achievements with their Eternals system, something games have had for free for YEARS.*
---
*Blizzard has recently proven they care so much about money, they're willing to support China.*
---
What the fuck is going on in the gaming industry?
---
do you really need someone rplaying to assume the obvious?
---
I swear money is like a rash to some people in this sub and they desperately want to get rid of it.
---
Sure wont, but at least I ain't got cancer clogging up SSD space.
---
Thanks. U Xbox?
---
What private server, this is nothing other than private world instances where you can't change anything.
---
But yea sure keep licking.
---
I mean it's obvious the industry is fueled by greed. Consumers are just so ignorant they fall for the "we need the $$ to develop you more content" scams. They are making enough money to develop content already don't be fooled they want to line executive pockets
---
True lol
---
&gt;This is the kind of stuff the term P2W was coined around.
---
No, it isn't.
---
That's why there are different terms like this: 
---
Pay to win, pay to progress, pay to skip etc.
---
If you can buy something with real money that gives you something that other players can't get without paying then it's pay to win.
---
If you can buy something with real money that gives you something that other players CAN get without paying, but it probably takes longer then that's NOT pay to win.
---
It's also on a private server, how am I winning when I'm alone or with friends??? Or you hiding somewhere on my server? I hope you're joking lol.
---
It will after Bethesda realizes that the amount of subscribers won't get as high as that they hoped for.
---
&gt;Now you can do exactly that. Why not just enjoy it?
---
Because I don't want to spend $100 a year on a buggy game where all features added were advertised to be free?
---
Ty sir.
---
1) Because it is *not* what we were asking for.
---
2) Because it doesn't allow us to solve any of the problems we wanted private servers to solve.
---
3) Because the cost isn't worth the value.
---
Bro € gets the worst deal. Id love to take the £ deal 🤣
---
pretty sure the monthly atoms don't change, either. 100 is just such a round, nice number.
---
This lools like the elite varient
---
I love the creation of problems to provide a fix for a fee.
---
I’m going back to ESO and BFV.
---
Blizzard would like to have a word with you.......
---
I really am baffled too. I keep up with the news because I wanted to come back and play more when there was more content. 
---
But holy shit this is next level out of touch greed.
---
Why can’t they offer a pricing option for private servers on their own?
---
If you say it then its completely true.
---
I won't.
---
What do games cost?
---
Does anyone remember them telling us that having over 100,000 of an item flags us as potential cheaters? Here it is:  [https://imgur.com/mklmf8p](https://imgur.com/mklmf8p)  It wasn't a problem because there was no legitimate way to obtain that amount of items.
---
What about now people have the ability to store more junk than that? Junk is extremely easy to get a hold of and obtaining 100,000 of it *could* flag your account as a potential cheater.
---
oh ...they'll allow it...by asking you prices that get higher the more indepth a mod goes
---
I have a vats build and concentrated fire, so I do head shots. I can clear whitesprings with that bow. Must stay mobile, but if you shoot and move, you can easily clear the clubhouse.
---
Okie. I'm not that person, but it's ok. I respect your point of view.
---
Wait, you can't mod or tamper with the game? What's the point in paying if I can't mod? I want to port FO4 mods over and have the game I wanted from the beginning and I can't? Smh 76 is dead to me. Edit: autocorrect bs
---
I've forced several people to buy stuff today already
---
All their prices are like that. The base game was €60 when I tried to buy it on their site. Got it on Amazon for about $58 later.
---
...why? That's how it works there too. You can't transfer a character from an Unofficial server (where you might have set 1000x experience rates and spawned in endgame gear) to the Official servers.
---
It does.
---
Lmao they release this around the same time outer world's comes out... Hmmmm $100 on this bullshit or a new, actually good game for $60?
---
Thanks! Challenge accepted.
---
Yes. They ask me 15 Euros which equals $$$ 16.6.
---
I was wondering where that left us PS4 people?
---
This sounds like stuff I can do in the Halo PC demo.
---
Which is free and came out like 15 years ago.
---
&gt; This is seriously fucking insane. BGS, you had all my trust still. Somehow you kept it. 
---
Honestly, I still trust the BGS. Some of their maps could do with a little bit of an update but overall the **B**ritish **G**eological **S**urvey does great work.
---
You insulted me for no reason.
---
And in your post you fail to realize that it’s not about fast travel, it’s about not being able to fast travel when you’re over encumbered.
---
With this 2 CAMP you can put it next to your looting site, this gives you the possibility to stash all you want because you don’t need to walk back to your original CAMP.
---
You also fail to notice TESO, a Zenimax game that has a similar premium, why would anyone be surprised? Because they promised? Things change, money is king, it’s “naive” to not expect this.
---
Have fun in the wasteland friend.
---
delete this, todd.
---
I don’t use ammo weight reduction perks. I use weight management skills. Perhaps you should consider learning weight management skills. Competitive gain on an ammo perspective is idiotic. Why do you carry so much ammo? Your gun is still only firing an x amount of bullets at a time. It’s your choice to do it and waste cards on weight reduction for ammo. Use mules. If those are full, then you’re a hoarder and you caused your own pain. Not Bethesda.
---
Can't believe you made an account JUST to argue about Fallout76.
---
I’m going to assume that people thinking of self hosting aren’t plebs. Most people would probably choose to pay for hosting but Bethesda isn’t giving us either option. There are a plethora of online videos and tutorials that show anything from building a server to configuration of obscure things like drive limitations in windows server. I think someone with the interest in doing so and a couple working brain cells should be at lest be able to get a pre configured docker image up and running just fine.
---
Why sell you a skin when they can rent you one instead.
---
nobody pvps in Fo76 though.
---
This is what my post was about...not a big deal to normal people i assume.
---
I'm not giving them a pass. They have certainly screwed up a lot of stuff. Also, I haven't spent one red cent on the game besides my initial purchase. And even then, I waited til Cyber Monday and got it for half price.
---
That makes sense as to why unlimited junk can’t be added to base game
---
I won't, i already paid for the game and that's it for me. But since there's people willing to pay for that now, complaining about whether it's too much or not is going to be way harder, since they're already paying for that and the community is divided into people that support it and people who think's is a P2W
---
I think thats a valid thing and the price will go down but this is what was requested and now this is whats available to those who will buy into it. The ironic thing is I definitely will have a private server... and I never asked for it.
---

Yes. It's a profit first product second scaling micro-transaction gaming world at the moment. But, hi, we are the 'demand'. We control the market, not corporate whim. We complain about bugs, if we're loud enough they get fixed, we complain about lack of content, if we're loud enough they add more content, we've complained about lack of npcs and lack of private servers (that's getting sorted)... we complain about cost, if we're loud enough prices will go down. It's a cost value equation.... at no point in that equation does bethesda lose money....it's only how much profit we allow them to make. Their fanbase is deeply splintered. They know this. They're walking a grey line right now...and will either choose to fleece their ride-or-die minority, or they will choose to lower prices over time in hopes to retain 'returning customers' in future releases. What I find endlessly fascinating is the daily posts on here by 'consumers' who are preaching 'corporate talking points' to try and excuse run-away profiteering. You all are either PR plants or deeply confused about what your role in all this is. Do you stand in line at mcdonalds shouting at the drive-thru customers that the dollar soda should actually be 3 dollars?
---
I see where you're coming from, and I loved Bioshock too. But it is an adventure game, like assassins creed where you control the pre written character. Outer worlds is supposedly an RPG like fallout or skyrim where you control ***Your*** character, making the characters look and seeing them in the world is a big part of that RPG experience for me.

One less turd in the punch bowl
---
Preordered Collectors Edition here. I feel ya.
---
you can use both on regular servers as well so long you're still subscribed.
---
Didn't play for a couple months now due to a busy workschedule...I figured 23th of October would be the best day to start again...
---
Also paid 200 euros for an unfinished game, and talk of listening to the fans...instead, I see this.
---
Think I'll wait again, what a disappointment Bethesda, no shame at al.
---
Check out the Season 2 for it... giant island turtles you an build castles on... Magma lizards... and water platforms to make dock bases.
---
Dopamine addiction.  It's a real thing that social media companies utilize to addict people to their platforms.  Video game companies have caught on to the model.
---
It's funny that companies are so low and shitty now that they have to addict their customers to their products just to stay afloat.  No wonder drug dealing criminal organizations are so strongly funded, the rest of the business world seems to have taken a liking to how they do business.
---
Release product with mechanics that fuel dopamine production (i.e. Legendary drops as one example), watch consumers get hooked to those mechanics.  Slowly dial up the bullshit so that those who are addicted aren't pushed away before they experience the new content further addicting them, downward spiral until the company moves on to a new product with a new group of addicted children to fund them.
---
This world is a fucked up hell hole of madness and bullshit.  No wonder more and more people are committing suicide these years.  Shit is only getting worse and the mass complacency with these types of business behaviors only fuels their greed.
---
With the removal of slap damage and all PVP basically being contained in Nuclear Winter, who are you even competing against anymore?
---
Right? It’s so annoying when people pay for a game and then expect the promise of content and a live service without more and more microtransactions every other month
---
Now my question is will the subscription be mandatory, as in I cannot play AT ALL without paying the subscription. Or will it be optional and the features (private servers etc.) are just for those who do pay?
---
Yup. On xbox. Gt is GrumpyDude
---
16 times the lies
---
I've been there, my friend.  No home, no car, and--of course--no video games.  So yeah, now that I'm doing better in life I have no problem paying a little extra for something if it has value to me.  
---
Yes, I paid $60 for the game when it was released.  I have gotten 1300+ hours of entertainment for that initial $60 investment.  And I would like more content in the future, which costs more than what that initial investment would cover. 
---
As for the monthly subscription, how many of us actually purchased Xbox Live Gold or the Sony equivalent specifically for this game?  Most of us already had it to begin with yet people are talking like Gold was invented exclusively for FO76.  Besides, that a Microsoft/Sony thing, not BGS.  You wanna play on online game?  You've got to pay MSN for that monthly Gold subscription.
---
fanboys!     
---
Irrational fanboys!
---
yea thats not the same ranger armor as in the sub, hrmm interestin
---
I've been playing Fallout 76 for a year and I barely got 30 hours of fun out of it. Most of those hours were before I got to level 20. After that, I quickly realized what a piece of garbage the game actually is.
---
r/paytowin
---
well that sucks... I'm still buying it I really want a private server for when mods comes out.
---
Oh they could add it, they just chose not to. Either way, it has nothing to do with the larger stashes crippling the servers.
---
It's great that you want to do that, and great there is a way for you to now enjoy the game even more. But literally every line of your post made me cringe.  It's the literal exact opposite of what I look for in a video game. Paid advantages are not a level playing field to some. So imma say goodbye and let you people take it over. 
---
Not insulting you here. This is something you can enjoy. You feel powerful and more accomplished spending the money then being better than other players because of it.  I want that feeling, too, but I want it earned under equal circumstances.  And it has been like that up until now. This is officially pay to win.
---
It's like working for your money/riches vs inheriting it.  Both are cool. Both are legit. But I want to earn it on an even playing field.  Not one with a skip system.  
---
And its disappointing to so many people because the classic Fallout fanbase has mostly been similar to my style of gamer. Classic, grindy rpg, character building, and using creativity. Now, its using sales tactics to capture the main gaming market. Which is fair. Me and my comrades arent the whales so they need to cater to that. I get it. It just stinks one of my favorite IPs is now just around for raking in cash and not making revolutionary gameplay for its dedicated fanbase like it used to. 
---
So. Have fun. Hope you enjoy it. Enjoy paying extra money to roll over the people that aren't paying extra money. If that's your thing, power to ya.  I'm gonna go somewhere else where investing time and skill are more valuable than straight up $$$.
---
Wow, the advantage saving 50 caps on a fast travel will give.
---
A few extra caps is definitely the only thing that gives me an edge in pvp fights. Every time I loose in pvp I think to myself, if only I had 1 extra free fast travel point to save on caps, I would have won that fight!
---
Maybe for now but they'll do something to piss you off, but for now enjoy what you enjoy.
---
Yet they don't go all nice and round $100 for countries like Australia.
---
I take some trouble with their coastal inconsistencies though
---
Lmao wow. It’s an never ending game, no way to win.
---
I don't think anyone really believed it. I mean, there's no way an arbitrary weight limit actually mattered to server stability. 500000000000000 of something maybe, sure, but not 800 "pounds" of whatever.
---
Well no, persistent CAMPs would actually be closer to FO4’s code. When you close Fallout 4, the game doesn’t delete your settlements, because player data and map data are stored together on the save file. FO76 could have worked the same way — this is exactly how Minecraft works, which is why you have to start over when you switch servers — but instead of designing the game around persistent servers, they’re using instances that dynamically spin up and shut down as needed to accommodate traffic, and all instance data gets cleared permanently upon shutdown. Adding support for persistent servers at this point would require some changes to how data are stored, but it wouldn’t have been an issue if they’d planned for it, and the game would play much more the way you’d expect, so you wouldn’t lose a workshop because you disconnected, your CAMP wouldn’t get wiped because someone decided to build there, etc.
---
I really have no idea how people missed this.
---
Junk in fallout games does not save as a single integer. Unless they changed something from FO4 to 76 witch I doubt very much. You could have a stack of 1000 iron and drop it on the floor and it will drop into 100 seemingly random amount stacks.  Not only iron but every junk item in FO would do this. I’ve had massive issues in FO4 after I play for like 30 hours. This could be fixed by dropping those 1000 iron bars and picking them all back up and it would then save it as one integer. If you did this to all of your junk stashes it would drastically improve gameplay and stop CTD for a wile till you have to do it again.
---
I realize that, which is why I responded to someone else's comment about taking the skin away rather than reply as a top level comment
---
Wait what? Ah FFS no. I really hope something got lost in translation here. I've been enjoying this game over the last year but I'll happily dump my gaming into football manager instead.
---
Here a secret picture how they decided on this:
---
[https://imgur.com/TCTs7i0](https://imgur.com/TCTs7i0)
---
Today but in 2077 the bombs fell. I don’t think people will forget it
---
I've been complaining for too long and here is a sample of things that I will keep complaining about ...
---
[https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1L\_y\_39vxd-HRqMYACkOk0qPVuSNPnTesWMXd3QLAdTs/edit#gid=306619144](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1L_y_39vxd-HRqMYACkOk0qPVuSNPnTesWMXd3QLAdTs/edit#gid=306619144)
---
But I see this patch ... positive, for communities (not so much for individual players) although there are things that should be adjusted so as not to adversely affect the usual servers (population of events and stores for example).
---
If this serves to correct all bugs and public servers are more stable ... I see, fine. But if they are going to give priority to these things of payment then ... logically I will see it wrong. So without even trying it or seeing its impact it seems positive.
---
Cause they are making you pay 100$ a year for it
---
Too late for the good part which is understandibly why they are doing this....oh well i like convienece.
---
Yeah, I'm done with this game. Charging 100$ for this pile of unstable sh\*t? Nope, I'm out.
---
In theory? 
---
This is the reality.
---
This is the first thing most of peoples with private servers will do after the update is over. They will take all the workshops and farm all the events. 
---
The other side of this is that we will buy 1000 5.56 for 1c in a week or so. 
---
It will be fun.
---
Honestly if you can’t manage you stash weight then you may have a problem and should probably see a doctor.
---
Thanks! 🤗
---
I mean free to play as in you won’t have to buy the base game it will go to game pass etc
---
Was able to get it through Microsoft. Clicked the Xbox icon on the Fallout 1st site and it took me there.
---
Oink
---
As far as I'm aware there's no moderators on this subreddit that work for Bethesda. That goes a long way to reducing censorship.
---
Yea but when the head of Bethesda says all future large content will be free and then back tracks and does this plus back tracking on only cosmetic micro transactions plus doing this with the game still full of problems is a joke
---
And delaying the wastelanders expansion for this ha Bethesda is turning into a joke company
---
Sadly it is not only Bethesda, it is the effect of the corporate takeover of the video game industry.
---
I'm generally a limited government type but it's far beyond time for government oversight into the predatory practice of the skinner box gaming model. These companies should be held to the same standards that casinos are held to.
---
What do you mean?
---
I'm 2/3 the way through a degree in this subject. But you don't even need a degree to understand that servers aren't free. Storage isn't free etc.
---
It doesn't seem like you understand any of that. You sound confused that they can give you more storage if you pay money. Which literally makes sense.
---
I’m on PS4 , I’ll take the PS4 stuff !
---
Well this settles it, I'm definitely not voting for Bethesda.
---
The people who make those decissions dont care about all of this. They have a calculation in their table that shows how to make the most money and tahts it.  Even if all the developers, designers, programmers, project managers, etc. would want to improve something, then in the end they still cant and have to do what a few individuals tell them to do.
---
In the US, both console and PC games are $60 each.
---
I do not have a PC at home. Or a laptop.  And I'm thinking of ditching my smartphone for a feature phone.
---
I'm glad PCs are working for you. I've done both, and consoles are flat cheaper for me. And more comfortable. Do they have better graphics? No. Better controls? No. But they solve the problem I have: economical gaming without the overhead of a PC.
---
Doesn't work that way, there are people who will buy anything thrown at them
---
Go ahead idiot, feed em more encouragement. You are the problem and you are an idiot.
---
Absolutely. Much appreciated as well. I just see the benefits to it and I'm confused as to why everyone expected this to be free.
---
Please don't even think about that until we have an account wide stash.
---
I think we were ALL urged to take a stand against Fallout 76 in general a year or so ago because a portion of the Fallout community thought that the very existence of 76 was a slight against the series.  We need to send Bethesda a message, they said!  And here we are.  We didn't listen to that crowd and we played 76 for an entire year.  
---
Nobody listened to them and nobody is going to listen to you.  Everyone should probably do what they've always done.  Spend their money how they see fit.  
---
Good luck with the crusade, though.
---
Just out of curiosity do you know where I can get free server hosting and free developer time? My company could really use both.
---
Do you know what their profit margins are?
---
intelligent
---
mature
---
educated
---
hell yeah, this fallout first thing sounds interesting. why not? played 4 until 76. Now all I play is 76. I'm old game solo and sometimes with friends. mainly alone. So I do not care one bit.
---
Uh oh lol I hear reality. Don’t let the trolls read this lol
---
and the youtubers who focus on pve content have double that amount. you're arguing a losing case here. the fallout playerbase isn't a competitive one.
---
Yea whatever that is LOL looks like somebody wrote it in their phone notepad. Thats no official poll somebody probably made that and posted it
---
Great response man! 👍👌
---
They never said they wouldn't move the line.
---
Look at the patch notes girch
---
I remember Dust514.
---
Absolute shithole excuse for a game with heavy p2w mechanics that were not cheap.  When Valkyrie launched, the Dust514 servers were shut down.
---
How many people wasted hundreds of dollars on digital content that was made inaccessible to them with a flip of a switch?
---
This business model longterm is a scam.
---
So is my backlog of good, quality ESO content.
---
Unlimited junk space correlates to unlimited lead, steel, plastic. Which also means unlimited ammo in junk form.
---
Right???  Money for new content has to come from somewhere.
---
Yea, the fact that it shuts down unless a fallout 1st sub is present is absolutely ridiculous.  It doesn't matter atm because chars will likely transfer between public servers and unmodded private servers, but when they lock chars to private servers due to mods, thats going to be a really big issue
---
Starfield. Starfield will be exclusively subscription based. Quote me
---
A little dramatic don’t you think for a paid private server? Did you want it for free? Can’t you play for free with mods now on all of Bethesda’s games?
---
That’s because of VAT. Blame your government for taxes lol
---
Are you slow..? I’d love for it to be better. That’s exactly why I am excited for them to take in more cash from the people who are willing to give it to them. You think their employees get paid in caps or something?? Seems like you don’t want the game to get better to me...
---
I understand I won't get everything I want. But I expect to get everything I was advertised.
---
Smart move
---
I thought there was a character creation? What do you mean by not having a custom character? Not being sassy or anything I genuinely want to know since I haven't been following it much.
---
Did you pay for any content in Fallout 76? Are you going to pay for Wastelanders?
---
No? Right.......
---
ESO has more, not arguing that, but you’re not forced to get the premium subscription if you don’t agree with the benefits.
---
And what you consider a dumb argument is what others consider the argument to buy, being able to stash infinite junk and have it in front of a dungeon is a win win scenario for me.
---
&gt;I'm going nuclear at this moment
---
Why the fuck are you going NUCLEAR over a fucking outfit wtf is wrong with you
---
Thats what the true pay to win means lol you think that extra stuff is p2w you must not have actually played a game as a f2p player before lol.  Cod, world of tanks, world of warships, etc are perfect examples of pay to win which offer actual player aka combat advantage.
---
Yeah but you're declaring that you're okay with it.
---
No one is forcing it to be purchased though... Its not like its a different map section or weapons and armor, etc.
---
I said it countless times... Items of the same number a just a counter going up. It costs nearly zero space... But hey, people defended bugthesda
---
How about just fixing your game, making it stable and removing trash monetization.
---
I propose a massive PvP battle with our new pay to win prizes to determine who gets all the stuff.
---
So we should all get unlimited junk
---
Oh yeah I can pay 5.99 a month for a Minecraft server that lets me customize every inch of it! What can you do with this server idiot?
---
Here’s a hint, they don’t want to put any resources into this and they’re trying to cash out and squeeze anything they can before shutting it down or stopping development.  Anyone who buys a year of this is going to sorely disappointed when they stop getting content in a few months, I guarantee.  Let’s see if they even decide to release this next update at this rate
---
yeah, it doesn't reflect you. but you also don't reflect the playerbase.
---
if anything you're the odd one out here.
---
I am not surprised by this. But the game is so mediocre at current state that asking people to pay for premium is so fucking stupid.
---
No need to wait, at least in Germany .)
---
Sadly only CC or fucken PP is available.
---
Like Charlie Sheen, I win.
---
It's not unclear when they have clearly stated as much, even answering the exact question on their Twitter feed. I'd advise treating the monthly subscription the same as the Atom Bundles they have released in the past where you got an outfit and bonus atoms for $9.99, at least until they give us some more content to justify a monthly fee. 
---
Just snag an outfit and 350 bonus atoms whenever one rolls around you cant live without!
---
I dunno man, I have fun playing, and $13 a month is  worth it to me, especially considering that if I don't like the private servers, I can just stop paying for it. I don't even care about the atoms and outfits and whatnot. 
---
If you don't agree with it, that's fine, and I know that $13 a month just isn't feasible for some people. 
---
If people don't agree with this and decide to stop playing, that's absolutely their prerogative. 
---
The amount of sheer anger I'm seeing though, it's a little unnerving.
---
HaHaHaHaHaHaHaHaHaHaHaHaHaHaHaHa... ho ho ho
---
Well if people start transferring their scrap from their private server to a public server then we got an issue.
---
I would highly recommend not supporting this move in any way. $8 is like 1/2 - 1/3 of full price DLC's full of content. After 2-3 months you could have had a DLC full of content for a different game. 
---
Or an actual full game on sale in the store. We need to vote with our wallets NO on this one. But of course you're free to do with your money what you please.
---
&gt; Thats what the true pay to win means lol
---
"In general a game is considered pay-to-win when a player can gain **any gameplay advantage** over his non-paying peers."
---
I don't think you're in the minority.
---
I'm serious, I will gladly accept any items from players leaving. I may personally like to have them or I might be able to give them to newer players or friends. Some of my friends don't have lots of time to grind out certain gear so I like to help them out when I can so we can play together in the more advanced parts of the game.
---
Thanks, hopefully not too long for UK 👍
---
\*Than
---
That's gonna be a "boo" from me, dog. This is shameful. My favorite game worlds, ruined by these disconnected clowns. "It's available RIGHT NOW" like it's a good thing.
---
I'm guessing they're purposely overpricing this, so in a month they can discount it by 10% and be like "Look fellow gamers! We heard you and we listened! Discounts for all! &lt;3"
---
It was bad enough with that last Bethesda post announcing paid private servers, increased Atom shop presence, and delayed content (because they're incapable of building a stable $60 game). That pissed so many people off and they still act like they're providing such a good service, but this is just next level.
---
I see them as bad. You are paying for what I would call a significant advantage. Know how much time I spend managing junk weight and how much I throw out - it's a lot.
---
The camp thing is a convenience but also very nice. The atoms and atom shop items are also things that can give you an advantage in game (repair kits, robot collectors, fridge).
---
It is already DEFINITELY paying to have an advantage and there is no sign it's slowing down. How far do you think they're going to go with it if people are paying? To me yeah the anger is justified.
---
Edit: not to mention the penalty of death is losing junk but with the camp and infinite storage then presto basically no penalty. And the junk reducing weight perks and affects on legendaries? Who needs them now
---
No, I’m going to keep playing.
---
&gt;a way better experience.
---
Crashing every 5 minutes
---
Unplayable without mods
---
empty map
---
8 random events total throughout the entire game
---
I think people are blowing this whole p2w out of proportion. While yes this whole fallout 1 subscription is a kick in the teeth I don’t see any pay to win. I don’t see myself buying this and “winning” all this provides is convenience at the expense of non paying players but work still has to be put in to fill the bag. But anyways let’s continue with the circle jerk, BETHESDA BAD!!!!
---
Eh I made a PVP/PVE server and built a Colosseum (read took over the entire desert on Ragnarok and Mountain Redwoods) of sorts for battle royals with commentary by me to those in the "Spectator Chat"..
---
I'd fly over and do drop summons and claimable creature spawn ins to make things interesting.
---
Sadly many folks left cause Red Dead and some other big names so i shut my server down.
---
We should make a support group, brought 5 friends into this, 2 left a while back, and the rest quit today, think we’ll still be back for wastelanders though. For now it’s OW time
---
"Personal" server, is that better?  The only other people who might be able to join my server are people on my friends list, and they can only do that for as long as I am on unless they are subscribers too.  
---
But I intentionally don't have a lot of online friends in this game, so this server will bascially be mine and MAYBE one other player. 
---
Feels pretty private to me.
---
Absolutely.
---
They also give you 19,800 atoms for $100. That’s basically half price what they usually charge. It’s actually a deal if you are the kind of person who buys atoms.
---
Wow...
---
When i click the xbox button its tellinh me purchases coming soon.
---
The concept of creating a private server with friends and nuking an area without hordes of people who race to get the kills and flux for themselves is also quite appealing. I’m just saying
---
Indeed its bethesda in the end like come on lol.
---
I'm subscribing after work :).
---
If you choose not to subscribe how do you see your experience changing? If you are enjoying it now you will continue too. If you are at endgame and have hundreds of hours into it and plan on continuing to do so like many of us than this is a great QOL improvement and a way to hopefully fund future improvement and content.
---
But a lot of people pvp and you said nobody. Killing supermutants is not very exciting for many people.
---
This was my question as well. It’s either the worst marketing move, the laziest move, or so advanced it is above our normie heads.
---
we didnt escaped the biggest bomb of them all .. this game
---
More NW xp for me
---
Bethesda is threatening you with a premium membership?  Have you had to replace a worn out rape whistle in your lifetime?  Has Life Alert banned your account? Do I really need more than a dozen layers of tinfoil to keep my mind safe from the annunaki moon rays, or have I already hit cap on armor penetration?
---
I really don't understand how many people are defending this money grab.  "Oh, all updates will be free. In stead of moderating, we're going to provide the option to buy a private game world, for $100 a month, which includes other p2w features, such as a fast travel camp and unlimited fucking junk storage".   
---
THATS what has me so mad. It's not "oh, you have the option" it's "the only way to play this solo still requires a network connection because we \_still\_ won't release home server code, unlike just about every other game in our genre"   
---
And that unlimited storage for junk is more p2w than anything else they've done so far.
---
They started going downhill a while ago. It just took them time to fully build up speed. This last year was when they hit terminal velocity.
---
It's not server, it's more like instance.
---
Agree
---
Only thing I’m paying for is modern warfare, cyberpunk 2077 and maybe outer worlds. This game is dead.
---
Love the Chinese Pack.
---
It's not bethesda's subreddit.
---
Lmao, worry about real life problems friend. Y’all are getting to angry over something irrelevant to real life.
---
At this point I'm pretty sure that Bethesda views Fallout 76 as a lost cause and Bethesda is just using it as a sandbox to see how much shit they can get away with with the player base. Using the info that they learn in FO76 , they will build revenue models for future games that will ride that line of pissing off fans and being fair. I'm glad that even in your failures you can turn it into a learning experience.
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/d5wzfj/fallout_76_paid_subscription/
---
It was a side project to find out how much more monetization they could fit into what is typically a single-player game by giving some MMO elements. The answer is, apparently, a lot. 
---
I know that Fallout 76 has hurt their reputation a lot and the launch was a disaster from a technical perspective, but if the sales figures are good for the Atom store and Fallout 1st, then expect to see the same kinds of monetization in Starfield and TES6.
---
Yikes. So out of touch. Bye bye Bethesda. Hopefully your fanboys wake up to the truth now, this is beyond ridiculous.
---
Xbox live isn't a Bethesda service or charge.
---
If you're not happy with Fallout 1st, thats fine and understandable, but trying to imply that Xbox Live has anythign to do with Bethesda is questionable.
---
Xbox Live and all those equivalent console versions are all bullshit, and its one of the primary reasons I don't play consoles at all.
---
I do, yeah. The duping days were the good days, man.
---
No Stimpak diffuser though.
---
ESO is inherently bad simply because its an MMO. An unfun, boring ass MMO at that.
---
We should get market rate today things can be updated in near real time at least once a day. Not based of some pound to dollar average from the whole year
---
Tolls must be payed
---
Pssst guys Outer Worlds comes out in a few days..buy it instead. Free with Xbox Games Pass!
---
Very good and thought out concern, OP. I don’t like that as well. I defend Bethesda left and right but they are messing up with that feature. The crafting bag doesn’t bother me just because I saw how it worked for ESO and I’m *optimistic* it’ll be the same on 76 lol.
---
Available for preload right now. Releases Friday.
---
To stand near you on this, it is concerning with mods for these private sessions, not servers, private servers are what minecraft realms are. Anyway my point is also that whatever we come up with as a negative bethesda will clearly "eclipse" what we think of as worst case.
---
They know that, thats why this is comming out now. 
---
But imagine if you could host your own server. It would instantly put the janky official servers to shame. Do you really think they want to be outshined by shit like that?
---
The fact they did not relase a free version along side this is beyond the dumbest thing i have EVER seen. But there will be plenty of time to forget about all of this before the next time they have to wheel todd howard out so he can hype you up for the next game.
---
So why would they have to delay Wastelander to add this?
---
It'd be cheaper to buy a used server and figure out how to set it up properly if you'd want to run one for years. Works great, plus you've got absolute control over everything, as the hardware sits on your desk.
---
No you don’t... 19,800 atoms for $100. You can’t get that deal currently.
---
Amen brother AMEN!!!!
---
The survival servers were dead after patch 11 because the took map markers away and capped PvP damage so then yes they were dead but not before that theu were not
---
He said he bought them for other people and one for himself to mule with. Now he's just making use of the accounts that his cousins are letting go to waste. The private server subscription is a whole other thing that has nothing to do with how many copies he owns. 
---
Really what business is it of yours to decide how other people spend their time or money?
---
I have three copies of the game and plan to buy a month subscription to the private servers and I have a full time job a wife and two kids and I play the game early in the AM between when my wife leaves for her job at 5am and when I get the kids on the bus at 8am before going to work (yeah, I'm on reddit at work, nobody is perfect).
---
&gt;That's fucking childish.
---
You just insulted someone because they bought something in a video game.
---
Exactly, we console players are already getting bulshitted by having to pay just to perform basic device functions, we don't need to to pay more just to get what should already be in the game, of course you don't have to buy it, but it's s bit excessive to spend 100 dollars a year.
---
The joke stopped being funny last year though that's the sad thing.
---
The time to draw the line was when they announced repair kits. That time has passed and this community is going to get exactly what it asked for.
---
There is definitely a character creator and you can see your characters face and model in the equipment menu 
---
You also can see yourself in mirrors and when you idle you get a 3rd person orbital view of your character 
---
I'm hoping someone mods in 3rd person gameplay one day, but that may take some months
---
Hell yeah
---
Boycott 76
---
How about instead of charging they release a server client? That would be private and free, wow. Enjoy paying for mods as well with Bethesda’s half baked server.
---
Lol like I'm stupid enough to still be playing this dumpster fire.  I feel like an idiot for buying it initially for like twenty dollars, just encouraged Bethesda's shit behavior.
---
They don't want to beat EA in most downvoted comment, because after that, EA changed the game.
---
Bethesda doesn't want be forced to change the game for players to be satisfied.
---
Let us all know how Todd's dick tastes.
---
You keep it if you buy a month appearently
---
Reeeeee
---
Wouldn’t argue with them
---
you must love conspiracy theories
---
Because they would never get the attention they desperately seek.
---
How long till servers are back up?
---
And they can do exactly that, they can pay and invite their friends and have a rpg immersion gangbang, and have unlimited storage.   Sounds ideal to me and I don't even care about role playing or immersion.
---
So way back when, when it launched, I was super excited and overlooked a \_LOT\_ of broken things.  After a while of crashes, etc, I finally gave up and went back to D2.
---
Can anyone tell me... Have they fixed the nuclear plants yet, or do they still crash the game?
---
Because if you merge the accounts into one, w/o accountstash, you'll again need a 3rd party to transfer shit.
---
It’s like the crafting bag in ESO+. You can add to it while the subscription is active and once it ends the items stay there you simply can’t add any more.
---
At least that’s how I understand it.
---
I bought two $60 copies of this game day one for my friend and I. This game has made me lose faith in Bethesda completely. No amount of refunds, free Atoms, or other content could fix that.
---
Yah took me a while!
---
Thank you, I have done the same on defending them. I just really don’t know how the crossing of servers is going to turn out well.
---
This isn't an airport, you don't have to announce your departure
---
How to spot someone that has nothing intelligent to contribute.
---
#Please just answer the question
---
DO YOU UNDERSTAND THAT SERVER SPACE IS NOT FREE?
---
I need to know if you can grasp this basic concept. Please. Yes or no question.
---
But private servers as they are in other games is never what was promised to us when they originally said they were going to look into private servers back in 2018
---
And were is the pay to win?
---
Why would someone purchase this?
---
So they could play by themselves and freinds and not have the possibility to be trolled?
---
If that's the case Bethesda made what was a Single player game always Multiplayer to later on sell server space to make it Single player?
---
Who the f*%$@ even asked for this?
---
Shut up 4head
---
I also wonder about what happens to the ranger armor and the tent... Are those still usable?
---
That’s the spirit! 😛
---
You seriously don't know what a server is nor will you bother to look up the definition.
---
"a computer or computer program which manages access to a centralized resource or service in a network."
---
That's it.  That's all a server is.  There's nothing special or magic about it.  Its just another computer.  
---
Years of games (and other programs) with dedicated servers that were just a modified version of the game client that allowed you to host your own games on your normal computers and hooked up through various network protocols - including P2P.
---
&gt; Nothing...welcome to the real world
---
Is the exact same response I would give you after your main post and everyone else's following any and all comments about content and spending.  If you wish to do something, constructive, don't buy their games  nor read any articles or anything else related to them.  It will save you stress, money, and time.  
---
Not defending or attacking anyone here either, be it Bethseda or poster.  Merely curious why care about it if you don't like it.  It isn't like things will change at this rate.  No magical movement or posts on a reddit will change things. Only change will be noted by lower sales, lack of interest, and fewer videos.  As if no one recalls that even bad publicity is still publicity.
---
PR departments can spin anything outside of lower sales or general interest.  So do something actually constructive as a player, group of players if you want change.  Whine less and do it instead by not taking part.
---
OH but they cant do that cause that causes instability? Or has that been a lie the whole time?
---
that wasn't the discussion the comment was on the ability to make private servers run off private equipment as such they could mod it by editing the values
---
It’s amazing how this sub is still divided 50/50 over this. Sunk-Cost fallacy is real
---
No company operates like that. That’s incredibly costly as they would have to hedge wildly.
---
You just sound whiny and wanting attention when you complain but dont say why.
---
Just game on PCs.
---
The reason they do it is because YOU ALL PAY FOR IT.
---
I haven't owned a console since the n64 because of all the under handed bullshit of charging to play games online.
---
Listening to you cry and complain about a completely optional choice in a video game on reddit I am guessing your friends secretly think you’re an idiot, and not because of Bethesda.
---
Tinfoil hat firmly on
---
A one month subscription cost less than some of the available cosmetics in the atom shop, it comes with 1650 atoms and you get to keep the Ranger armor if you cancel.   So just subscribe and cancel.  Problem solved.
---
But companies NEED money dood, they totally don't make money after the first day microtransactions are the only way for a game to grow dood./s
---
It's sickening that there are people that truly believe that microtransactions are needed for games/companies to make money.
---
That's not gonna happen because the eso equivalent material stash is the main selling point for premium subs now. Like fast pass tickets at an amusement park, once you get used to the convenience(and superiority for some people) it's hard to play the game without it
---
You mean the 25 people who will come back under new usernames and continue to play the game like nothing happened.
---
$160 for Fallout 76 😂😂
---
Yes, we knew they were a rental service, but the cost of $13 dollars a month for it is more than PS+, and it adds services (like another tent and unlimited scrap-box) that should be available base game without a paywall. 
---
As for PS+, it gives a percentage (I think 10%) to the devs I believe, but I could be wrong. I tried looking it up, but couldn't find anything conclusive, but I think they could've gone without requiring PS+ for this game.
---
Also, not everyone can just "switch to PC" just to play a game. I have a Mac, and Fallout76 would take up near all the storage on it.
---
The point is that it seems this game was made purely as a cash grab. A game shouldn't costs over a hundred dollars a year to play
---
Oh ok lol, Sea of Thieves and State of Decay 2 are both on GamePass, and they're putting Xbox Live on Switch so I wasn't sure if I just missed the news that they were bringing GamePass with it. They're already adding Live and crossplay, I think if the Switch can support it, GamePass is a possibility.
---
HAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHA
---
glad i got out months ago
---
Before it was kinda difficult to sale some now its gonna be harder
---
That ”it just works” line cracks me up each time.
---
I'd consider being able to store unlimited scrap, ability to play single player, and fast travel thingies features.
---
Edit: Changed things to thingies.
---
There sat there laughing at all these comments probably and setting up there bank account to watch it start filling up when the game comes back online
---
To be fair ESO didn't have anywhere near the same amount of content it does now back when it first dropped ESO plus on the community.
---
My account on this terrible website coincides with the release of this game.  I barely use it now that I've traded for everything I need. 
---
Their "front page of the internet" pretentiousness, the incredible petulance of the vast majority of the users, combined with the obsession with upvotes and other nonsense.  Its sad that I've even had to use this garbage site to get my rad gear.
---
I mean I guess you could say it was from the Savage Divide or Toxic Valley or some shit where that would make sense but we all know it's just Bethesda being lazy lmao
---
If you want to see exploited join my private sever. Use the work shops as you please just know I expect a 50% tithe From all you acquire from my lands I graciously allow you to work.
---
the only part thats wrong is the last part. every game sucks now
---
Atleast battlefields has a choice between a day or a week, not a month or a year like fallout
---
For people who don’t pay, he’ll bug you every 30 seconds.
---
They did it right before the release of one of their competitors too.
---
Not the best move.
---
Just one. You do have to scrap a few to learn the plan for the helmet. It is not 100% Learn rate. But after that, You use one head to build the helmet, scrap the helmet and get the head back repeat. When super duper goes off, you will have 2 helmets now and scrap for 2 heads. And so on.
---
So you think extra storage and a fast travel is an advantage? lol you make me laugh. It offers no stat boost whats so ever, no weapon boosts, it only offers storage for scrap and a camp for fast traveldoesnt make me any better in combat now does it? you can build to be op af in 76.  so once agin tell me how you would have a ACTUAL advantage over other players in actual combat where the p2w will actually mean something!  because a extra storage isnt really appealing or a extra fast travel point, plus its funny how you have to call someone stupid to make a point lol goes to show ppl cant keep things civil. Aso your missing the fact it also for a private server that is offically from bethesda so id rather pay for it and get a few extras then Pay and get nothing else.
---
Obvious bait is obvious
---
In a game where looking cool is literally a selling point and endgame content
---
Yeah I shoukd have worded it much simpler, *game is good and doesn't require real money every update*
---
ok passive aggresive asshole. keep bending over.
---
He wears those tight little leather jackets to hide the bullet proof vest lol
---
That does.
---
I will never give Bethesda money ever again. What a pack of greedy fucksuckers.
---
This subreddit is hilarious man, a bunch of people proud of being gullible simpletons being taken for their money repeatedly. Either its Bethesda marketers or people with mental illness of some sort I dunno man
---
EA is in the name of the company twice.
---
Says it all really.
---
I thought they were leaving contact info so they could empty their characters to those left behind.
---
I’m from China and there’s actually quite a fo 76 community in China despite it’s not very popular compares to fo4. I’m sure they will be glad to have this pack. After this datamine comes out almost every Chinese player is hyped for this now. You know, it’s a faction themed pack. Every faction has people who love them. And the Chinese Army is one of the major factions in Fallout despite it hasn’t get much attention in the typical gameplay stuff.
---
But of course, there’re few requests about this on reddit for sure.
---
Joining is up and running
---
MORE PAMPHLETS
---
I could see a way around this, with the junk storage have it auto-scrap all junk into its components, then its significantly less information on their servers.
---
True, or just merge all but 1. But I see the logic. I just wish I could have all my atom store stuff apply to all my accounts.
---
Fo76 revolves around junk. just pick your poison. ammo would probably be mine. I could essentially have hundreds of thousands of 5.56 within a week.
---
oh alright, sorry about that then.
---
workshops are containment areas for the 1% of your kind, that's what the average player doesn't get.
---
Nor what the word "promise" means.
---
Server hopping lucky hole mines is just super easy for lead with excavator armor, now people will be able to do this for thousands upon thousands on lead pieces. You can come out of the mines with about 400-500 lead, refreshes every server hop. Wes tek for steel, kill all the supermutants and scrap their assault rifle with scrapper perk, unlimited steel. You can now do this without worrying about the weight limit. Do you see the problem of unlimited ammo now? This game is slowly getting worse and worse.
---
Every game has become a mobile game
---
Okay but if the game doesn't survive then don't come crying back to the subreddit 🙂
---
Man, I sure got a lot of play time out of Enter the Gungeon, Binding of Issac, FTL, and Dead Cells, just to name a few. Oh yeah, loved that X-Com 2.
---
Np amigo, no way you could have known.
---
Dedicated servers used to mean that all the tools to start up a server were included in the fucking box.  This was STANDARD for two decades.
---
It said “The American Empiricism must fall”😂
---
You know, Fallout is all about the Cold War mindset and government propaganda attack each other
---
I know it feels good to be a contrarian but there are some points where you should step back man. You’ve gone full circle to bootlicker.
---
I understand that you dont care about those. But the people who do just dont matter?
---
They proved that when they released this game, then they proved that like 20 other additional times after release but ya'll still here playing it and giving them money so I guess they don't care.
---
Way to copy and paste dude.... I think we ALL get the idea.......
---
If that is the case, that may be the final nail for me. I really hope that is not the case, but that really makes the private sessions so much more lucrative.
---
Don't joke about bullets, not funny no matter the context.
---
Interesting!  I remember reading your post about the Dallas trip, but didn't realize Fasnacht was supposed to be controllable.  Did they mention how they'd planned to use that functionality if it had, indeed, worked?
---
Yeah your tough, only big scary guys like you get red at the face and dive into people’s post history looking for ammo to use in keyboard wars. You are one immature 39 year old.
---
 Uh huh. I'm 73 ... you are a kid.  I would have guessed about 14 actually, but hey.
---
Honestly, I know this isn't the best answer but just install another game. The best part of this broken ass game are the low levels where surviving is difficult, so if you're getting bored as you get higher level you're gonna be super bored once you lvl up. It's literally just grinding the same broken events and locations over and over, hoping rng will bless you this time. Played since beta and got to 230, running on the hope the game would be anything other than a broken mess. It won't.
---
That's actually smart as fuck, i'm gonna do this.
---
Thanks! I’ll think of you often while filling my scrap box!
---
Last time it was only 300 people out of the 200k that sub here that took that poll. Not very convincing data, don't know what you've got against survival mode or those who played it but you sure love to back up your bias with this "poll"
---
Junk cannot replace caps because none of them are universally accepted, even as a whole we have better options like ammo.
---
Traders already use ammo as currency, so what will just happen is instead of trading 5.56, people will trade in lead, steel, or acid (which people already do, tbh) or screws or other valuable things.
---
This is the exchange of goods and services, and a variety of ways to build wealth is good for the economy.
---
This is not a good move.  Not when it's still suffering.  If they wanted to do this, they needed to wait until things were better.
---
I mean if fo4 paid mods store taught us anything it's that this company would sell their mothers on the corner for a profit
---
But you would be fine with buying the NCR Ranger Armor from the Atom Shop?   A place where they sell re-used Fallout 4 assets for the price of entire FO4 DLCs and where they sell power armor skins for $17?
---
Crap, you're right. I just checked the status page and they went down at 7am eastern, not 9. 
---
https://bethesda.net/en/status
---
If you’re in America, please sue them.
---
Its Obvious that you dont know what you talking about, dont worry
---
Agreed for the most part but I honestly don't know how junk is pay 2 win ?  I run power armor and heavy weapon and just hit 160, I've ever had an issue with it. The unlimited junk thing does nothing for me
---
I'm ok with that.
---
r/futurama
---
They will definitely have to start planting audience members for pre scripted questions too.
---
I suspect this was released because wastelanders is free and they got to make profit somehow
---
You must be trolling
---
5 euro per month would be manageable, could exclude the private servers from it to reduce costs.
---
I'm just taking your immature dancing around the point as confirmation that you didn't understand any of this...
---
you supporting this only hurts us all but your too blind to see that. have fun when they shut the servers down cause you people never took a stand.
---
Couldn't they then have servers dedicated to only storage, and use the same systems to allow access to this storage to everyone?
---
Because buying a game once on discount at $25 isn't going to keep a company afloat for the next 30 years. Buying the upgrade package isn't required to play the game. You'll still have everything you currently have even if you don't pay the subscription.
---
Yeah but there is no other way of obtaing the skin and sincerely, other the fact that as a console player I already pay a subscription to play Fo76, private servers are a basic feature of every multiplayer game plus they always just said they were going to give us this feature after the launch, not on payment, they are just lying to us for greed, even the stash weight increase was said to be impossible but now they would do it with the subscription
---
Do you think I want him shot? I’m sure he’s as happy as we are about all this and he’s taking a lot of heat he doesn’t necessarily deserve
---
I totally understand that. For those of you who don’t mind these predatory cash grabs then have at it! I’m not saying All of you should boycott, but for sure those angry enough to make a post or complain about it hopefully back those actions up with monetary action. Complaining is healthy and let’s us vent, but actions speak louder than words.
---
If you personally don’t have an issue with them doing a monthly charge in this particular case or releasing unfinished games but still charging 60$ and are happy to keep paying then more power to you brother. I enjoy a ton of Bethesda games! It’s one of my favorite companies, but I do not support their trajectory over the last few years of becoming about the money, not the consumer.
---
you do realize you can use the scrap box and tent in regular servers, right?
---
Okay there grampy.
---
*You're, at least I know the English language ya nerd
---
Immature 39 year old with clear skin 😚💋
---
*than
---
*paid
---
The people making wastelanders are not the people making paid membership benefits...
---
Out of all the outrage posts...this has to be the dumbest. You're acting like the entire dev team is working on...a subscription model that would've taken a day at most to come up with.
---
AND wouldn't be being worked on by programmers.
---
Except 76 isn't those games at all. You guys are already whining because of some kind of "advantage" to be had (there isn't one). Can you imagine how it would be exploited if all those features meant for solo play were included and could be hot swapped back and forth?
---
All of you should just quit. Right now. Stop whining, stop playing the game. Go play something different, and make room for the players who understand nothing worth having is free.
---
Oh, don't get me wrong. I'm not trying to downplay the number of items, and various combinations that you described.
---
But again, databases are quite literally designed to handle absolutely enormous amounts of entries and data. Pair that with well designed software and decent hardware and there shouldn't be much issue as you've said.
---
Another way of doing things is to automatically generate all possible combinations of things, and have a completed item list (theoretically one should exist, but it's probably not explicitly written out). From that point, all your software needs to do is point to the item ID from that mega list and store the quantity...which would also greatly reduce loads.
---
&gt; Edit: fixed the link
---
I know how to farm.
---
But that take tons of time I'd be better off trading legendaries.
---
I picked up 76 in the first place because friends were getting it and told me it has multiplayer PvP. And it did for a long time and i really liked it. Not so much now. Thats just my perspective i guess
---
See my entire post outlining why they shouldn’t have put repair kits or utility items in the Atomic Shop
---
This kinda is going the ESO route.
---
It's crazy becuase that's something that even the PTW assholes at rockstar let you do in gtao for FREE.
---
You’re right. It just seems backwards to me to be asking for improvements and then bashing Bethesda when they try to raise money to fund projects to implement said improvements. 
---
This patch has so many QOL improvements and other bits of content for free. These are QOL improvements and bug fixes which you just mentioned!
---
Imagine if your employer asked you to work for free or until “things get better.” You probably wouldn’t work there.
---
By playing it you are declaring that you are okay with it. You are voting with your presence.
---
Listen I loved Fallout 76 I met most of my friends on it I have fond memories on that game I was so excited for wastelander looking forward to new content on this game. But instead of giving us that they discussed to have a game breaking monthly subscription for the low low price of  $99 for a year. WTF Bethesda I looked up to you thinking you never be as greedy as EA but with this shit and barely any new content I done I just done. And I know so of you may defend Bethesda decision about doing this and down vote the shit out of this post but I just a concerned fan of this game so please do yourself a favor and not buy this shit even if it has the NCR Ranger outfit you can get it for free on fallout 4 or New Vegas. Please don’t waste your money on the subscription service or they might do this to their other games as well. Thank you for take the time to read this
---
Pay to win pay to win pay to win pay to win. 76 is becoming like Dust
---
Bethesda would not have caught nearly as much shit if the game had retailed for £30 (with 2 months free) and hit us for £7-8/month sub. Plus cheaper atom store stuff, people wouldn't have batted an eyelid at those prices. Once stuff goes in to double digits for recurring payments people get annoyed.
---
I get that man and i have been at the bottom too, nowadays i won't spend overly on games because of A. An  addictive personality and B. I'd rather spend it on the family.
---
But in the wider view im not looking at this on a personal level rather gaming as a whole.
---
Sounds good to me. Thanks!
---
Dont be that weird guy that goes through others post history. I support local businesses. You are supporting greedy developers. Spend your money on what you want, but mistakes will be made.
---
I paid full price, for a power armor edition, which I haven't opened.  I also paid for a digital copy of the tricentenial editon, and personally I am happy beyond belief that I can pay for a personal server with unlimited mats stash. 
---
And...
---
Before we discuss the current fo76 market status, let us all look no further then reddit, which has destroyed the market. Nothing really done about d*pers. Overpriced weapons and armor everywhere you look on here.  If anything this will flood the market and bring down prices.
---
What isn't in the Patch Note is if the CAMP budget increase transfers. If I take advantage of a bigger CAMP budget in my private server, will that CAMP place in Adventure?
---
Never have I ever had an MMO be free AND good, there's no inbetween. 
---
So excited for private servers and the fact that I'll be getting more Atoms per month than what I pay for (1650Atom -&gt; $12 a month). If you can't afford to have a good time I suggest you just continue your little grief party and simmer in your vinegar while the rest of us have fun.
---
I didn’t know any of the history of Zenimax or Providence Equity Partners. Thanks for the info!
---
In either case, I totally agree it’s not the rank-and-file developers who make these decisions. It’s either BGS leadership or (seemingly more likely) Zenimax’s direction to BGS.
---
I was already out a while back now, after I lost my patience with the bugs and broken patch releases.
---
News like this just confirms to me that I made the right decision ... and was a fool for wasting the time (and money)  I did on FO76.
---
No criticism to those that are still enjoying the game at all.  Each to their own, I guess - but from someone who Bethesda lost a little while ago (for numerous reasons), this just looks to me as a shameless cash-grab taking advantage of those people who crave "improvement of life" changes that should be part of the game already.
---
I just think of all that hideous micro-management of my inventory I had to do when I was playing Fo76 and quite how tempted I would be to spend MORE money on this game just for the endless scrap storage, and it seems almost, well, insiduous.
---
That is the word ... insiduous.  Look it up.  I did lol  It really describes how Bethesda has handled improvement of life changes to the game and connecting the same to micotransactions (and now subscription models).
---
gonna corner the player market on bulk cannonballs
---
I get peoples frustration with stash sizes, but you don't need to stockpile that many resources to craft/repair on a general basis, you just don't.
---
that's how I found out about this bullfuckery
---
There is a difference between stash and scrap though. Stash can encompass every single item in the game that can be picked up and stored in your stash. Scrap is only 33 items in the game. I agree the stash limit is really low and needs an increase.
---
Can I have your stuff tho?
---
Yeah I suspect that most people that get this subscription is doing that I think I might be doing that later on
---
The 'fake' outrage is that the publisher has the balls to add a paid subscription service to a half arsed broken mess of a game. Atoms shouldnt even be in the game, its broken! No monetization should be in it cause it isnt finished!
---
I'm not a native English speaker, so i dont really care about that tbh, but People usually refer to this kind of insults when they are out or arguments
---
Man I’ve put so much fucking money into this game and they ask for a 100 subscription. I’ve already bought the fucking collectors edition, have bought every atom shop bundle, and bought countless items in the item shop. I’ve played this game since launch. Supporting it the whole way and have been trying to get people to see past all the bad parts of the game, and they do this shit. Fuck this game man.
---
Haha! I would give you silver but im poor.
---
Maybe they have fucked the game completely by mistake and can’t get it back online.
---
What’s really weird is my s.o. hasn’t gotten an update either. But I’ve already downloaded it...
---
Thank you for performing cpr on a 1 year old cadaver
---
Sorry, this is not my main language
---
Haha are you really thinking about buying this?
---
They want PvP players to main nuclear winter, it's not the ideal place for PvP but it is a controlled environment that's constantly updated, give it a try. It's more challenging than camping at workshops I'm sure. Maybe they'll eventually fix pvp.
---
“It’s about the people who survive in it”. If you play game you will learn a lot about people who survived the bombs and unfortunately didn’t survive the scorched. Also... I’m not sure if you are aware... but there are 23 other people who survived also on the map!
---
I honestly don’t care about human NPCs. I just want more story. And lucky for you we are getting both. The lore in 76 is extremely well written and detailed. You don’t need human NPCs for that.
---
Lol - I give up. I'm going to stick to clearing my nose and stop trying my hands at maths. Thanks
---
*Fee to play
---
Longest update ever
---
No shit sherlock
---
Just about to say this...
---
I thought was gonna be 7.30 pm UK time now thinking 8.00 pm wasting my evening
---
I think the idea here is to ruin the public servers so the only way to play the game without constant crashes and disconnects is...(drum roll) to pay for a private server.
---
Yah I’ve been hosting servers for various games since Far Cry 2 and certainly did not expect private servers to be free.
---
its is not bad for 13    you get 1650 atoms     so its a net win in those terms for anyone that would have bought atoms anyway.
---
 Oh mine is half wild, un neutered and my baby boy. 
---
 In Canada and other civilized countries we often give gifts from our pets at birthdays and other gift opportunities.
---
I've put over 150 hours into the game before getting bored and giving up. The stories all seem to end with but then everyone died. There was no suspense to so many quests because you knew that there were no human NPCs so you knew you were about to walk to a corpse. There were interesting points in the story occasionly I will admit and certain side quests were interesting but were ruined by knowing all the characters were dead. 
---
And new Vegas easily surpasses 4 and 76. Only 3 is close to it, I can see people preferring 3 but those two are better than the rest because they had actual care put into them and had interesting lore and stories which is mainly because they felt more connected to the originals. 76 and 4 have shit all over the other games in the series it feels like
---
You want me to stop playing the game I've paid for because you don't like their business model?  
---
Their setup is pretty shitty in places (taking suggestions from the player base and making them premium paying items is a wanker move) but the game is still enjoyable. Without throwing extra money at it.
---
(bit of a rambling rant)
---
This left me speechless. You just can't be this detached from reality, Bethesda. The incentive to get 1st goes from absolutely negligible, to absolutely negligent. You should really reconsider on how to monetize this game. I'm glad I got this game on a reseller for $15, because this game is so not worth full price, and I feel really sorry for those who preordered or worse, got the collector's editions. This game is getting too expensive to play for so little content inside, a problem that this game shares with many other "live-service" games. I think this would have been less egregious if it was accompanied by a big update, like Wastelanders, not a bug fixing patch. This game is close to be one year old and   has nowhere near enough content for a month. My issue is not with the subscription per se, (its value is extremely low for the fact that it's 85% of an XGP Ultimate subscription where similar services, like Minecraft Realms, it's $7.99/mo for ten people) but the lack of touch. It's not the time. Polish the game, and emerge later with a brand new image. Make the game F2P, refund the people who trusted you with their money on the premise of this game, reconnect with your audience. Why are you so keen on nickeling-and-diming everything from whales? When the whales leave, there's gonna be no one left.
---
Uninstalling the game for now. I've got better things to do with the space for now.
---
For-fucking-real.  The sense of entitlement in this player base is just gross.  Last time I checked Bethedsa was not a 501(c)  You dont want it?  You dont buy it.
---
You don't understand how data basing works.
---
600 hours?! I feel sorry for you.
---
No I dont cause its shit, it was awful when I playes it. It wasnt acceptable so I stopped, it didnt work. Ita not acceptable.
---
Nah 76 aint bad.  Anthem is far worse..js
---
A shell of the company they used to be. Tell me lies tell me sweet little lies.
---
Thank you!
---
Man I loved Far Harbor as a location. It was one of my favorite things about 4.
---
I remember when people said the repair kits would bring a big competitive advantage. Havent really seen much about it since. They just seem like a waste of atoms now, especially since you can get better ones killing the SBQ (usually).
---
I feel like the people who actually use their scrap to craft stuff like ammo wouldn't hold onto it long enough for "unlimited scrap storage" to matter anyway. This is probably only "helping" the hoarders who have 500 pounds of wood and dont do anything with them.
---
This is of course assuming the unlimited scrap storage is just that- SCRAP storage. I dont expect people to be able to hold 1,000 fat mans and supwr sledges in their fancy new trunk.
---
&gt;The more people LET them rip them off, the more they will do it. Uninstalling and discontinuing support is the only way to get a functional bethesda that makes good games, back. They must be forced into making a product worth money, by fans NOT giving them money for trash, and pre-ordering everything.
---
you should Watch Jim Sterlings video, which is already out.
---
why would I leave anything for you bootlickers? I'm taking all my legacy plasmas with me.
---
Private worlds which you’d have to pay for anyway. Which is essentially the fee you pay, with the rest being extras. And you don’t “need” private worlds either.
---
Wtf? Who’s gonna have more junk to build all the cool new toys? As if it’s hard to build anything in 76, as if no one can go farm for the materials they need anyway? As if people still have stash management problems in 2019. This subscription shit is stupid but it’s not pay to win, having more space over another person is hardly an advantage when they still have to go and play the game to gather those materials in the first place, I can’t wait to complain and be steamrolled by someone who has more tin cans and coffee mugs then me, you can build anything in the game not have it cost much if you actually don’t horde everything and manage your stash properly
---
They don’t control this subreddit. They have literally no power here as far as I know
---
as a returning player, i am buying it for one month.
---
I think it's very obvious Bethesda just doesn't care about public opinion at this point. They exist to appease whales, and if that means losing a chunk of their most engaged customers, well so be it.
---
I think they messed up big time
---
Lead duping is my favorite past time
---
It's ok you can actually MOD that one and make it prettier
---
Not even that, reviewers aren’t reporting ANY bugs or pressing issues of a similar nature. We’re actually going to see a day1 patch that runs... like a day1 patch should.
---
Haven't we been getting all the DLC free anyways?
---
Keep supporting a greedy publisher whos fucking over its consumers.
---
It's a lot easier to understand what's going on with the prior knowledge of ESO+. Have they said you get future DLC access with 1st, and can you buy DLC with Atoms?
---
That's the real value of ESO+. You can subscribe, play the DLC, and if you like it, buy it with the currency you got from the sub.
---
Who are you and what do you want us to ask? I feel like I'm missing the point of this post.
---
But It's a game not a necessity like food, and is it really that terrible? An optional subscription service that gives you the money back in in game currency? We have different ideas of bad business practices
---
No thanks. No desire to PvP on a 8 man server where we still need to challenge each other to a duel first.
---
LMAO alright that's enough Reddit for today, you fucking killed my lungs. Laughed for a good while.
---
I would pay to have a way of kneecapping all of you in game with 12g coinshot shells
---
(just kidding)
---
&gt; This sub especially, it's like a cult of insane people who worship Bethesda and will defend everything they do
---
i see this man never visited star citizen sub, we are still normal compared to that lul xd
---
“There’s always going to be new content, changes in game balance,  whatever it takes, and by the way, it’s all free after launch – all our content, there’s no season pass and no paid DLCs."
---
 - Pete Hines
---
you picked the worst possible time, congrats.
---
He never said you could host it, and we simply do not know what mods will look like.
---
They're private anyway so it won't affect you
---
You don't understand how databases work.
---
FO76 is not the first game to be concerned with database issues regarding items that have a lot of properties and people stockpiling them.
---
Each item requires far more values/variables to be tracked than something like scrap material, which has one property - the quantity.
---
That'd be cool.  I like this idea.
---
Gamers rise up but unironically.
---
I'm fine with us agreeing to disagree. I was fine with that when you replied to my initial comment stating you didn't care how other people spent their money.  But when you made it personal with the next comment, it rubbed me the wrong way.
---
Let's let bygones be bygones and call this conversation done...
---
This is information from the presentation...
---
&gt;Also included in Bethesda's update is a mention of modding: "Additionally, in the future you’ll be able to mod your worlds. Stay tuned for more information on the service in the coming days." It's probably safe to assume that with Bethesda handling the selling and hosting of servers that mods will run through the [Creation Club](https://creationclub.bethesda.net/en) and not from any outside sites, even for us PC players. 
---
This is what they defined as a private server since before the game was announced in 2018.  I can't find anything that says otherwise.
---
Today I learned World Of Warcraft is a mobile game.
---
Your standards must be really high to defend Bethesda up until this point.
---
With how Bethesda has handled this game clearly proofs they are just another greedy corporate "TRIIIPPPLEEEEE AAAAAAAA" company, to whom shareholders income comes first.
---
I'm fucking scared how TES VI is gonna turn out...
---
Every  time I play both my girlfriend and I remark "this games really isn't as bad as people say". 
---
But then its such a shame to see how out of touch Bethesda is constantly. I play the game with rose colored glasses on, I really do. I look past the fact that I'm managing my inventory for 25% of the time I play. I look past the 0 damage hits when I sneak attack a monster every time. I look past how attrociously difficult it is to build your camp sometimes.
---
I endure all of this, and every God damn week Bethesda comes out of nowhere with somthing ridiculous (like a year ago when they ruined my explosive build to combat TSE), and almost never fix the things that actually bother us. I was really looking forward to today's update, and I think not playing for a year is the reason why. I forgot how broken Bethesda is. 
---
It's a good thing I own Fo76 for life, I'll just come back every year from now on until we're finally at the point ESO got itself to.
---
:( **Bethesda, what's going on?** :(
---
They must have their first year game dev coop students working on the game at this point.
---
People can’t do shit so long as you don’t enter workshop PvP or fire on someone without pacifist mode
---
So, your claiming I'm well off because I was excited to buy a power armor edition and a digital tricentenial copy?  Like, have some love and lose the shitty negative jealous attitude bro. 
---
Life is about love, not anger and asshurtness.
---
I like this idea! Give 76 to Obsidian if “The Outer Worlds” is a smash hit! 🤓 I don’t think it works like that! But I’m hopeful.
---
Ah it’s not just me on Xbox. Was wondering if they REALLY are still updating or my internet is the issue.
---
Is the Halloween event crap or something? Why are you acting like we didnt just get another update?
---
I can't find any solid info on this..but it seems like although the world is not persistent, the progress is. The marketing page implies this saying "persistent workshops"
---
Yeah I really like him because of his willingness to at least give 76 a shot. With outer worlds out soon I won’t blame him if he just switches to that
---
It’s not horrible but I definitely wish it was less. $23 for private server access that can be shared with friends, unlimited scrap storage, a free fast travel point (useless tbh), atoms that end up costing much less with the pass than if bought alone... it’s a good deal but I’d rather just pay for the servers. Also it’s super p2w, and we will definitely see people charge others to use their private servers so as to make some of the money back.
---
Anyway I’m on pc and I’m gonna buy a months worth to test it out. I know it’s stupid as it supports Bethesda and they’re fucking us over one update at a time, but I really wanna try those servers.
---
People do try to rdm, but you have to hit back, and can set yourself to passive mode
---
Workshops do have pvp if others try to claim it from you so watch out
---
Only players you have initiated combat with can destroy your camp, so dont try and claim a claimed workshop and go back to camp (I did that and the guy blew it up)
---
Why feel sorry for me? Why? For playing a game i enjoy?
---
So I am guessing based on the fact you haven’t answered my question for the 4th time is that you indeed do not actually play the game. 
---
Why out out a hate video for a game you don’t even play? Lol
---
Yup. Vault 94 way up by the Red Rocket megastop. There's 3 different raid events that rotate weekly, and 3 different "skill levels" to play on. Novice has no timer, and standard and expert have increasingly short timers. Rewards include Bulk ammo crafting kits, improved repair kits, and plans for 3 new types of armor (1 PA set and 2 regular sets) that have unique bonuses like poison and bleed damage.
---
just don't take workshops and turn pacifist on once you reach level 5. nobody can harm you then.
---
I'm aware, but can all of my FO4 mods be ported? Weapons, armours, etc...? If not, I'm not interested.
---
This isn't an MMO though?
---
Fallout 4 did.  So it may.
---
It is still not free, you need a subscription for GamePass.
---
Are you aware of what Bethesda is even doing? There locking content from us with a overprice paywall and in the first place it should be free!
---
Very niceu Caesar-Chan!
---
In thinking about it, I don't buy my console at launch. I wait for the first price reduction, at least.
---
And we can actually discuss console purchase tends over time. They release these figures as investors care about them a lot.
---
I think they must be having issues with getting this sub service on there. Nearly 5 hours now it’s a ridiculous amount of time. I’ve installed a 5gb update on Xbox so it’s offline for some other reason
---
There will always be things others have they you may not have the chance to get any other way than a direct transaction of goods. Some items are very rare and hard to come by even for those of us with hundreds/thousands of hours in a given game. I just would like to make things easier for people transitioning to other games. A person who gives up their loot and gear will be lifted from their burden to come back and continue the grind. Giving up their loot will also help others who again may not have lots of time between work and family to grind out gear. I just want to help out in a few different ways.
---
Why are you making videos for a game you don’t even play?
---
We’ve already payed for the god damn game and we’ve supported the atom shop. Stop betraying us Bethesda by hiding stuff behind paywalls
---
I am pretty sure that the people who practically rule the company put this as a top priority, so that most resources got directed towards it. Its not like all the designers, artists, programmers and other employees can decide what they want to work on.
---
It's free after you pay for it. /s
---
The community I generally pretty nice to new players. Apart from some rare griefers the main thing that will kill you are enemies not players
---
Still showing at £11.99 for me?
---
https://imgur.com/gallery/MaTNYl9
---
Fallout 76 is just Fallout, but online. They didn't make any major changes to the system, and it's not trying to be anything but Fallout Online (would have been a better name I think)
---
It's what it needs to be. Charge people money to have a better experience, put that money to work developing the game. It makes perfect sense. Stop grandstanding.
---
 Pete Hines
---
Obsidian could be our saviors!
---
I hope you feel terrible for liking video games.
---
Don’t give them money! You would just support what they’re doing.
---
Wow i felt trolled so hard lmao. I dont understand tho cause im already paying for nintendo online no way im getting another subscription
---
Please boycott. Faster, more responsive servers for me.
---
Why are people acting like if we haven't seen this before with ESO plus?
---
The entire is point is getting a private server, everything else is a bonus
---
In many countries false advertisement is illegal and you can ask for refund 
---
If enough people do that Bethesda would make a change to stop people asking for refunds
---
The hate video isnt about the game, its about Betheadas stupid anti consumer decision.
---
By definition it is lol
---
Yea but I sold it a couple months ago
---
No, you misunderstand, or I didn't write as clearly as I thought. The raw drop chance of any given 2\* legendary combination is roughly 1:200, provided they all are equally likely, so getting the same legendary combination twice in a row as a 1:200 chance, and getting the same legendary combination thrice in a row has a 1:(200\*200) = 1:40,000 chance, i.e. you get this, on average, every 40,000 attempts of someone doing three consecutive pulls.
---
(Based on the unstated assumption that consecutive drops are calculated independent of each other.)
---
who is also in that board room: heads of pr, social media, sales, advertising. all these folks will have teams tracking all social media outlets, purchases, and customer service tickets. we complained about the game so they changed the game to appease us. we complain about pricing, if we're loud enough they will change pricing. they profit regardless, we decide how much they profit.
---
Lmfao “NPR” I hope that was in purpose.
---
I think spending 5 bucks on gold bars in red dead online is a rip off, and that is an infinitly more polished game. These niggas must be smoking crack, the base FO76 game isn't even worth 20 bucks.
---
Infinite junk sounds fucking amazing, but to pay $13 a month or $100 a year is fucking bullshit. What a goddamn joke.
---
Oof that would suck if the host could time out, especially if you are playing across time zones and sometimes have different play schedules than your friends. Anyone Subbing already let us know?
---
I’d like to see the amount of people who’ve bought that subscription... I bet maybe in the 10’s
---
Can't answer that one lol Nintendo is always a crap shoot, you never know what they're doing until it's done. Microsoft is getting better with communication but it's still confusing sometimes.
---
I can't believe you think spending a bunch of atoms that no one paid for is somehow making then money? The majority of people never actually PAID for atoms. They just used the free ones in game. That actually loses the company money.
---
I don't know, do you drop your junk when dying in ESO? 
---
Might make a difference there.
---
No, Bethesda pretty much busted mine with their dick move today.
---
Wait...
---
Honestly its those other two shmucks running 76 atm... Hines is probably shitting in fear because they just fucked him figuratively in the ass on this...
---
Glad you're jumping to the defense.
---
So they mule. Alright. So that must mean its on PC.
---
So he continued to buy the game, at a lower and lower price, with the assumption that his cousins would play with him.
---
So they didn't want to. So he used those accounts for storage.
---
Great. He has 4 accounts. 3 for storage. 
---
But how much time does he invest in the game, while having four accounts?
---
How many accounts do you have?
---
Suprise question. What kind of business model is this; if people feel it necessary to, rather than have more storage, the need of more accounts for more storage, which helps sell your game and pad the numbers of existing accounts?
---
I'm dumbfounded that I just came back to give Bethesda a chance, and there's nothing here to retain me? If anything this is a push.
---
i mean i guess, it's still doesn't meet that MASSIVE server count to be called an MMO.
---
Very good update Bethesda. Can't wait to get home and get my very own scrapbox. Finally don't have to worry about managing my inventory.
---
The issues you're raising already exist in the current paradigm though. I can log in as a new player "on the morning the vault opened" and encounter level 250 players who have already launched multiple nukes, so it's not entirely lore friendly. Mostly what I'm talking about with persistence is the idea that your CAMP would still be there when you log off, so friends can visit it, use your shops, take cover under you turrets, etc. and you wouldn't lose workshops because you disconnected for a second. I don't see why either of those would be inconsistent with the world design.
---
It is.
---
&gt; except I could spend a day farming for all the junk I could possibly need and be set for a month instead of doing it every goddamn day.
---
Except you would still spend the same amount of time collecting junk, so you save nothing.
---
&gt; oh nice somebody is nuking the Queen. too bad I need to go on my ballistic fiber run.
---
Right, because spending all day collecting a ton of junk instead of spending a few minutes collecting a little junk each day is totally going to ensure that no one nukes the queen while you are collecting junk.
---
Agree 100% on this
---
It supposed to be permanent as its cosmetic. So getting 1 month then canceling should give it permanently.
---
I used to defend them because I thought the game had genuine potential, but not anymore.
---
Good question because they might get 10$ out of my cheap ass if its permanent
---
Might as well
---
This company's selling poker games and some mobile games that noone gives a damn about. And the company's somehow valued more than Bethesda, which means Bethesda's making less money. This makes no sense. All those masterpieces like Elderscrolls and Fallout series for nothing. No wonder all those big game developers are leaning towards shitty mobile games. There's no money in AAA titles. Feels cold
---
Yes. It is spelled out in their FAQ on the Fallout 1st page. Once you get it you keep it.
---
War swans will all be eaten after Brexit. The Queens going to go fucking mental! Greggs sausage rolls will be the new currency.
---
I missed that, thanks. Do you have a link maybe? I'd like to read that.
---
Or if you want fast travel anywhere. Or if you want unlimited creating storage (which wasn't possible previously when they reduced stash space).
---
I experience this game plenty in the headlines every week. Definitely would rather play Minecraft.
---
Yes they are, because you know, they're F2P............
---
&gt;Do you think that 60 cost in the beginning is going to sustain a game for its entire lifespan?
---
Considering the state it released in, and that its an asset flip, yes.
---
&gt;They dont have the numbers to be compatible quality or quantity wise.
---
This is not our problem. Bethesda is a multi billion dollar company. If the quality is there, the game will sell better.
---
&gt;They do have a dedicated fanbase, that's there only support at this point.
---
Which they're milking very hard. And lying too.
---
Well don't worry there, this specific whale left after meat week and never came back
---
As long as we don't have to buy the sub to access the coming game content. It's possible they put it into making meaningful free content like they promised. I just dunno, I'm rapidly loosing confidence.
---
Im up voting every single post about this bs Bethesda needs to realized they messed up.
---
 
---
1- Bethesda said that only consmetics would be selled on the atomic shop 
---
(LIE) Now theyre selling PAY2WIN
---
2- Bethesda said we coundt have more stash/scrap size because of the server stability and currency balance 
---
(LIE) Now the new service fallout 1st lets you have all the size in your private and public servers. If it was only on the private server i would be ok with it
---
3- What happened to you Besthesda ? we use to like you but in only 1 YEAR you guys became EA ! And thats not a good thing !
---
I bought 6 versions of this game already.
---
1 version for 79 dollars (tricentennial version) pre order, participated in the BETA 
---
6 versions for 20 dollars for  friends of mine/gifts
---
I defended this game for a lot of people, but now thats it.  I even bought the game to play with my brothers and friends. I love the fallout series but Bethesda you did it, you became EA. And thats not good.
---
To finish it all, you guys decided to postpone the wastelanders update and decided that would be a great idea to put some Pay2Win features besides your previous statement promissing that this wouldnt happen. 
---
This game looks like a mobile game now. I paid 79 dollars in this game on preorder and 2 months later the price was 20 dollars.  Thanks for opening my eyes.
---
Agreed
---
How can you say something so controversial yet so brave? *slow clap*
---
The servers are still down, so no one knows how anything is.
---
Jeez I have 3 copies to cash in thanks. Any idea if we get more for tricentenial?
---
That was a Fallout 4 retcon, it was supposed to have been an Enclave design. The Fallout lore is an ever-changing thing, though, I'm not too worried about X-01. But yeah, a ranger outfit from a different faction based on the other side of the continent a century in the future is also pretty lore-breaking, even for fallout.
---
It isn’t that bad! Why don’t you think they make netflix a one-time purchase? Because it takes work to upkeep. If they made private servers a one-time purchase, they would eventually be under pressure of updating the game without getting any income because of it.
---
You've obviously never been on any market subs, selling junk is big business.
---
And ammo too, so if I can store infinite acid, cloth, steel, lead and plastic etc. I can create ammo whenever I want.
---
I regularly sell acid and lead at 4 caps per 1. 5.56 and .308 is worth a cap a bullet.
---
Bethesda have well and truly fucked up, yet again. An absolute disaster of a game. This shit is a hell of a lot worse than what EA pulled with Battlefront 2 at launch.
---
For the love of god Bethesda, just release an offline version of this game and give us the 76 Creation Kit so we can ~~rebuild America~~ fix this wank stain of a game.
---
Wow, how do you pull money from your future paychecks like that? Cuz I’m pretty sure they want the $100 right now.
---
There are alot of (Whales) keeping this game going for everyone who chooses the free road. Then whines when they add something new to the game.
---
so for what i pay to buy atoms each month i get my own private server, unlimited junk storage on it and public servers. an extra free fast travel spot &amp; cosmetic items. that i get to keep after i turn the service off. and free atoms? $12.99 a month or $99 a year ($8.25) sign me up.
---
Lol.  Have they also not played the game? How many comments do you have?
---
Isn't outer worlds done by their sister company? Why would that game be any different?
---
The only reason I can see my self using a private server is for Wastelanders, so I can play through it without interference. But will I still be playing this game in a year’s time? Who knows..
---
They broke it with all the buildable items for me. Skins for them are one thing but there’s a large list of buildables only obtainable through atoms. Yeah you can get some through dailies but god damnit I hate the dailies so much.
---
Haha I gave up even attempting that XD I am glad my helmet didn't have mold though XD
---
Well said, I feel the same way right now. I regret buying this game at all.
---
Sound like a Bernie supporter
---
I would argue that Fallout 76 isn’t “winnable” like the others in the franchise, but rather you just continue playing after a few quests to unlock some factions.
---
It just works......
---
If it doesn't, there'll be a ton of people fuming about spending huge caps on one.
---
Cool, thanks all for letting me know. I'll probably get a month then cancel just for that.
---
For the people who bought the service yes
---
I'm most likely going to get it, so is my buddy.  I never wanted to play with other people to begin with.  This is exactly what I need so that I can play the game alone (or with my friend) and actually enjoy the game.
---
So lets milk this dedicated fanbase from all there cash before we go under, and you shills will still think you are doing something
---
Literally buying The Outer Worlds for $60 instead of going through game pass just out of spite. I’ve defended 76 since release but this is just the final straw.
---
😂 made me chuckle
---
I pre ordered it too, you’re not special. And I got exactly what I paid for and what I’ve had since launch. This has literally no real impact on the game or story. Other than the occasional cap or two you might have spent to fast travel to one location.
---
I think the majority of people here would shut up and stop complaining if it had a solid single player mode. The game is honestly pretty great at its core.. if I didn’t have to deal with other players. I got into the game super late and other people were the least enjoyable parts of the game.
---
Wow this is probably the first official Bethesda FO76 post that got downvoted into oblivion.
---
They aren’t keeping anything alive but the fat check going into executive hands. This game has bugs that haven’t been fixed for ONE WHOLE YEAR still present. The raid they released was bugged unplayable garbage, now they want you to pay money to play on their servers under their rules with no hope for free community made patches or mods (which by the way have bailed out and fixed every other bugged game these devs have released over the years) I literally don’t understand how you can be so engorged and happy with this, they have stood by their open world games for years with free modding and a high level of mod support. Now they see an opportunity to bleed people dry who already pay for their online live/playstation subscriptions and have paid 60 dollars already to get in game. Now you want me to pay monthly to get mod support and a “private server” that has no customization. Oh wow but atoms are cool and unlimited junk that Pete Hines said was already a base game feature before launch. I don’t get it, how can you play any other Bethesda title and look at this shit and say it’s okay.
---
And nintendo online is absolute crap it lags like hell
---
I do understand how databases work. They could have done this unlimited scrap for us a long time ago, but instead they are selling it to us. THAT is what I take issue with.
---
&gt;  something like scrap material, which has one property - the quantity.
---
And cost, and weight, textureset used, model file used, etc. I modded bethesda games since morrowind. There is a lot more than just one data point to track. But like I said, this isnt my point of contention.
---
Lmaoo this was my friends first thought when she saw the monthly option. She said "part a me wants to buy it for a month and farm up a ton of stuff, but it's supporting ptw so idk." This is definatly gunna inflate the market. Its guna be a whole new pay to win meta of unlimited stash walking around.
---
ITT: teenagers and pre teens.

Those no number associated with mmos lol. It just means open world like game that can be played online with others. Local and randoms alike. 76 is on the smaller scale like I said but over years it could be huge.
---
Outer Worlds &gt; Any game Bethesda ever made
---
they should honestly just make the game free to download, and give everyone who already had the game on X date (presumably today or the date before they go f2p) 6000 atoms.  then add an option to get the membership for 500 atoms per month (sans the bonus atoms).
---
play to pay is a model used by most mmorpgs, and it is ultimately very profitable for players.
---
doing this would essentially give players who paid for the game a 1 year subscription, and keep them engaged in playing the game.
---
and making the membership buyable with either cash or atoms (which are also buyable with cash)would mean that regular/casual F2P players could eventually get a taste of the membership, and maybe be enticed into paying real money for it.
---
its like Beth only knows how to make bad decisions, despite all the other similar games having already done this...
---
Wonder if the fuckwads creating posts begging for their gear really think they'll get anything too?
---
It's always worth scrip!
---
Oh, I've been on the internet, was on it since 1989, let me tell you something, people then had functioning brains and typed in complete sentences.  People now, stupid af (did I use the af correctly??)  Fucking morons... That's a fact.
---
That’s a shame. I was really hoping for persistent workshops! Fingers crossed that it gets added soon!
---
Finally, THANK YOU
---
Ha same. Pretty bummed out that we don’t get the subscription for free though. Like we paid the highest possible price
---
so I feel like they should have marketed the game this way from the beggining.. charging a subscription fee would bring in revenue that CAN guarantee new content it CAN help pay to fix server stability and it CAN help with longevity for serious players but CAN and WILL are two different words so we will have to wait and see... YAY legendary scorchebeasts lol
---
except I'd be free the rest of the month. it removes the micromanaging part of the game which is such a nightmare for several people. it's the very definition of pay2convenience.
---
You are what's wrong with games today.
---
I'm not as worried about the server being persistent as long as the workshops are persistent. If I can log out and come back later to my workshops still being built-up then that alone would be worth the cost of the private server. I've got $15 burning a hole in my pocket just to find out anyway
---
Pls post a picture of that ranger armor,I wanna see if it's the real deal
---
And even better with the 12.99USD turning into 14.99EUR, aka... 16.68USD.
---
Getting double rear ended on that one it seems if you're not in the US.
---
Dunno if they know how exchange rates work at this point.
---
There's no use arguing. These people want free gameplay for the next 30 years and are going to scream and cry any time something costs money.
---
4 was entirely focused on the new gameplay, like the settlements and new shooter mechanics. There were minimal RPG elements and the storytelling felt much weaker. I've stuck with 76 appreciating for what it is not what I wanted it to be for a while but this is the final straw for this game. I wish it had been something special but it's been badly run and crashed into the ground for profit
---
well thats something at least
---
"everyone who doesn't agree with me is a jobless NEET using their parents money"
---
fascinating
---
Why are you acting like most people weren’t anticipating Wastelanders the most? Delaying it could be good in the long run, but announcing the stuff they did afterwards was the WORST way they could’ve gone about things.
---
Edit: Personally, I got the PC version in anticipation for the Wastelanders DLC. To have it pushed back, then have this subscription stuff announced shortly afterwards left a bad taste in my mouth.
---
Lol even for the 12.99 a month you could skip on on 2-3 Mcdonalds a month lol.
---
They say the server initiates a shutdown timer when you (or the last fallout 1st subscriber you invited onto the server) when you leave. Therefore it is reasonable to assume they cannot be used as a courier service on a single account.
---
All my arguing all day on the subject as a whole, and finally I have found somebody that I have sympathy for.
---
Sorry there is no money in that,  so they aren’t interested
---
Lol it’s going into elder scrolls 6 that’s the whole thing with FO76. Slow updates little to no bug fixes no implications of free new weapons or armor but all locked behind pay walls. FO76 and it’s fan base are nothing more then cash cows for their new game
---
RemindMe! 14 days
---
Debatable. Maybe if you were expecting another fallout 4 but I’d say 76 is good considering they were trying to replicate that with a four times larger map and multiplayer.
---
Don’t you have to pay for servers on Minecraft?
---
I love playing and it’s still not worth it. I’m deleting the game as soon as I get home, they don’t deserve extra money for features we were promised from the start. This move is an insult to the remaining fans who supported them through previous controversies.
---
No idea but it doesnt matter. Its about Bethesdad decision, if this happened in another game it would be the same. Its a dogshit decision and you cant see it.
---
New player here. Most people are friendly but passive mode will help with the few who do want to engage. It’s been refreshing to be in this community after playing a lot of red dead online.
---
&gt;No private servers for everyone? Mods ONLY on bought private servers? What in the actual fuck Bethesda?
---
This was known back in 2018.
---
It's horse crap...More lies
---
Hmm, you are one who likes the sound of their own words in both their mind and outloud.  I typed about a game and the business related to it not about international situations, so ya...high horse much?  So go soapbox on YouTube or something, it'll make you feel better, kay?
---
Yo this game is trash b. I bought on launch, and sunk 400 hours into it. I am level 162. I had so much fun with it especially when they updated a few month back and really polished the overall gameplay. But now, after I have taken a break again and was coming back, seems in vein. They have still no learned their lesson. Such a shame. Elder Scrolls and Fallout ate literally my favorite franchises, but I cannot support this behavior anymore. Wake up, man.
---
They rushed the game out for people to pay full price to have a Black Friday sale for half price 10 days after it came out
---
The game was a hot mess from the start, but it’s nice to see the fanboys starting to take off the rose colored glasses
---
You can use them online
---
This needs to be pinned at the top of the sub.
---
Is ESO really that good? I got it about 2 years ago maybe I'll give that a try now that I'm over runescape. Is it like the new WOW?
---
I'm going to wear it, and do nothing all night but flash the "cash" emote at all the salty poors.
---
This game looks like a mobile game now. I paid 79 dollars in this game on preorder and 2 months later the price was 20 dollars.  Thanks for opening my eyes. 
---
“There’s always going to be new content, changes in game balance, whatever it takes, and by the way, it’s all free after launch – all our content, there’s no season pass and no paid DLCs."
---
And to say, the Atomic shop is cosmetic stuff. To make sure folks understand--look there's a line. There are people who have crossed it, but we're going to stay on the right side of it in terms of the things you can spend money on and how this stuff works."

It's not enough for sombody to fall, they must be made to know why they fell
---
*sigh*
---
Im suffering from a progressively debilitating problem. I thought I was typing "on me" and instead typed "in new." Word substitution is one of the early signs. :/
---
They're not exclusive, you can use them on both.
---
Yeah, I have no problem with paid private servers. Heck, I would have no problem with any of it if they opened the unlimited scrap storage up to everyone, or put it in the Atom Shop to make it earnable. It's that a gameplay improvement I've wanted for a year (since I bought the special edition of the game for $100) is now going behind an $18 per month paywall.
---
Oh I’m just deleting the game I waited months for private servers and I was very patient with the game. Now I have a reason to delete it. I’m done.
---
Have fun eating government cheese and sucking dick to make rent ya poor bitch.
---
Are you talking about Fallout:NV or Fallout 76?
---
More tantrums. Yay
---
Amen, I’m uninstalling right now and making room for the outer worlds that I payed 2 bucks less for than their stupid subscription
---
Start your boycott then! I’m going to keep playing and give the new private servers a try!
---
Half priced atoms are predatory now? Lol
---
It doesn't lose the company anything actually. It's not real. It's a switch that's turned on and a number that's entered into a database that already exists. Using digital currency played in a digital world spent in a digital shop literally costs them nothing. Pennies maybe, in computational power, but that's hardly a leg to stand on when arguing this.
---
And I never said it made them money. What I said was assuming earning atoms in the shop is a reward is childish, when in actuality all it is is a manipulation tactic to get you *into* the store in the hopes you'll become a whale.
---
The fact that you're even defending this at all is disgusting enough.
---
Furthermore
---
&gt; The servers cost money to maintain, why shouldn't they charge for them?
---
Never said they didn't cost money. What I said was they're not SO cost prohibitive that they warrant a $12/mo sub price. Or any price at all. Countless upon countless of games have private servers at no cost to the end user.  This is a blatant money grab through and through.
---
&gt; They tried to do a completely MTX based revenue system. 
---
No they didn't. They started a MTX system and feature-creeped p2w mechanics over time. They didn't *try* to do anything. It was a business tactic. game effecting loot boxes were in the database since week 1.
---
&gt; Now we will finally see improvements and fixes that we're done before,
---
what about people who bought the game hoping for updates on launch? What about people who played through the MTX only shop hoping for updates? What about the people played through game effecting lootboxes hoping for updates? Keep holding the carrot on the stick and people like you will never notice it's not getting closer.
---
Or what about the scrap-collecting robot that was featured in the trailer with it's docking station and everything only to be cut from teh game and re-introduced in the atom shop?
---
That's what they said when they announced there would be an atom shop.
---
That's what they said when they announced game effecting atom shop items.
---
Yet still there hasn't been a single significant update outside of a tossed together BR mode for no reason. WHen the rest of the game is in shambles. Stop fooling yourself.
---
&gt; You knew it was a bad idea. You know what is the beat course if action to fix the problems this game has. Yet still you whine, because dammit, you want your cake and you want to eat it to.
---
If this were f2p then I *might* be inclined to agree with you. But this was a full priced AAA title. That seems to have no affect on your unwavering apologetic arguments in defense of a disgustingly greedy company.
---
You're very obviously viewing all of this in a bubble without looking at the amazing history Beth has had and the good will they've managed to patently destroy in less than a year. There are endless number of games that manage much larger games with a much larger playerbase that don't use dirty tactics and outright lies to make money, but you've managed to convince yourself that everything they're doing is not only warranted, but somehow needed.
---
Who asked for items to be taken out of the game and put into a shop?
---
Who asked for access to servers for $100/year? 
---
how can you not be considering the value to cost aspect of this whole thing?
---
You're the reason Bethesda is considered an absolute joke. They'll make a boatload of money, sure. But at what cost?
---
Outer Worlds will be the best 3 days of gameplay you have played all year!
---
NGL the stockholm syndrome is something else in this sub.
---
Like all of us.
---
Bought the game on launch day. Got the collector's edition.
---
Over 1000 hours played across multiple platforms. 
---
I've been in the nexus modding community for over 10 years.
---
I literally went on forums and defended the game in 2010 when people were calling it shit.
---
I still don’t see how a premium vendor who (for example) collects materials for a month and then makes 300,000 rounds to sell is any different than a non premium vendor who collects enough materials to make 10,000 rounds per day. 
---
It’s still the same amount of material and ammo, the non-premium guy just has to break it up into smaller chunks. 
---
I really don’t see this as a competitive advantage, just a convenience, and I’m fine with pay-to-convenient. 
---
It’s like the atom shop headgear that has environmental protection built in. Not an issue because everyone else can just pull out a gas mask or veil. 
---
The collectron is a little different but it’s essentially a junk node and extractor, so I feel meh about it. 
---
Thanks for keeping it civil. 😀
---
The first ten seconds of the video is Jim sounding like he's going to literally die laughing.
---
Bruh, it ain't even on steam
---
I was able to and i chose to.
---
In adventure mode or only private servers?
---
It’s truly not going to matter.  Even with infinite materials space in ESO, farmed stuff remained basically stable. 
---
I like farming in 76. It’s calming sometimes. When I’m able to sell 70k 5.56 rounds to just two people in a week, it’s not going to magically shrivel up demand. If you make caps from ammo, me holding every single workshop isn’t going to put a dent in your production. 
---
Doing every single event solo isn’t going to get me better gear. 
---
Having 30,000 aluminum isn’t going to impact your sales. 
---
Without a private server or duping, I have so many serums to sell just to vendors that it’ll be Christmas Day before I’m out. 
---
It literally doesn’t matter at all how many resources I have. The only way it matters is if I try to pump those caps into outbidding you on a weapon, or purchasing things for over market value.
---
what about all PLAYERS though? That would be crazy.
---
so long you're subscribed, yes.
---
More bethesda shills putting their head in the sand and pretending everything is fine yay
---
This is basically my biggest complaint.

Why not just give access to the Creation Kit and let people make mods already? Seriously. I'm sick and tired of waiting.
---
Adventure and private
---
There was never such thing, there was bug removing your entire inventory in vault 94 but it's already fixed
---
Aww, too late. Bought it already and negated your vote.
---
Whats funny is how they have to entice people with a cosmetic from a game THEY DIDN'T MAKE.
---
But hey, RDR2 is coming out next month on the R* launcher, so that'll be good especially when RDRP servers become a thing.
---
I am not crying, but I am willing to take any free gear or items from those who are leaving for good. You don't seem like you are leaving so my post /request isn't very relevant to you. I have got one PM from a person who may take me up on my offer. I welcome others as well.
---
So by buying cosmetics I’m contributing to a paid subscription for servers and shit. Makes sense.
---
I can’t wait I’m excited
---
I just made a post explaining why (for me anyway) maybe you’ll have better luck.
---
I'm like 99% sure that bust is already in the base game, I think I have it on my kitchen table. I believe it's supposed to be Teddy Roosevelt.
---
Wouldn't really make sense to put a Russian leader in the Chinese communist pack anyway.
---
Probably so I think.
---
Here's what they need to do. Shut down Fallout 76, start development of Fallout 76: A Wasteland Reborn, and in 5-7 years release it as a F2P title.  Fire the executive that keeps meddling with Fallout 76. They're the ones that thought reusing Fallout 4 art assets would speed up development, which is why the initial dev time was only three years. There is no game developer on the Austin or Bethesda team that think reusing art speeds up development.
---
ESO took 7 years to release and then a few more years to get good. Final Fantasy 14 had to be shut down and completely remade to get good.
---
They don't care. You were dumb enough to keep giving them money after the absolute trainwreck of a launch, so they already got what they wanted.
---
Hopefully it sells like hotcakes and they get the backing for a big money sequel
---
Side note, have you seen the fallout project where new Vegas is recreated in fallouts 4s engine. I cant wait till that's done
---
&gt; A Private World holds a total of eight players and must be started or joined using existing characters. Only the owner of the world is required to be a Fallout 1st member, and they can invite Friends from the Social menu to lead them into a game. Alternatively, Friends can join a member’s world from the Social menu if the owner is currently playing on it. When the owner leaves their Private World, it will remain active if at least one guest is a Fallout 1st member, otherwise, the game begins a shutdown timer, notifying all players before removing them at the end of the countdown.
---
So it will be like the world shutdowns that we used to have. If no-one is present on the instance it will just delete.
---
I've already earned over 8600 points this month, which is more than enough for a month of Gold. You just have to be consistent and do your Daily set and searches each day. You can also earn more on the Rewards app on Xbox One.
---
I love the gameand am planning on getting it. It's $10 for Xbox live, $60 for internet for me. It's not like people aren't already paying to play this game anyway lol
---
How were you able buy it? 
---
If i go to the bethesdas fallout 1st page and try to buy it, it keeps telling me "purchases are coming soon"
---
Can you buy it in game?
---
I'd love to host my own servers. Bethesda's still using a farm of 486sx machines. I'd use my render farm from work on off hours to run it.
---
who knows, and even when it does become available, mods will only be available to paying subscribers and  after all this shit, i guarantee you the modder community for this game is going to be nearly nonexistent, this game just isn't worth modding when the only people who can use them are the (probably very few) paying subscribers and only on their own private servers (which aren't really yours and which get reset if there's not someone on it)
---
Delightful.
---
I choose to give it a month to see how it goes. If it sucks I won't renew. But because someone wants to enjoy what they paid for you'll grief them? How does that make sense for you.
---
Grant you if it's a year..but how can you differentiate between a month and a year?
---
You're doing the maths the wrong way round - you need to take 20% off the UK price to reach tax free parity (the 15-20%  US tax was a complete unresearched guess).
---
When you do, and using the current exchange rate, UK people pay $6.83 more on the annual price and $0.18 less on a monthly basis (to Bethesda - the rest is to the UK government). I guess they rounded a little to hit the £xx.99 price points but not as much as you're saying. 
---
Considering how stable our pound is at the moment this could have changed a lot by tomorrow. It could be a terrible deal or an amazing one depending how certain EU related dealings go...
---
13$ = runescape lol
---
Pfft I doubt they’ve even broken even yet.
---
Yeah got the game yesterday, a 5 hour downtime on my day off has sucked
---
okay cool? Good for you.
---
And theres nothing different about the game for anyone who doesn't want to pay. Woopie I can store 5 trillion steel instead of taking 30 sec to manage it daily. The best changes are available for everyone so, whatever. It's private world+ and I'm gonna buy it.
---
Don't blame Bethesda for you using a console to play the game - they don't get ANY of the money that Microsoft or Sony gets from your subscription services.
---
If you don't want to pay to play online, use a PC.  Easy.
---
It's almost as if people are looking for anything to complain/whine/scream about, even if it has ABSOLUTELY NOTHING TO DO WITH BETHESDA.
---
But, so long I guess?  Good luck?
---
Free stimpacks is a great perk
---
I'd say Bethesda's done more good to the gaming scene and deserves more. At least more than Zynga. I'm absolutely not okay with some sellout mobile game company making more money than Bethesda
---
 Whats an RMT?
---
1tb drives are dirt cheap.
---
And the file size is understandable. people want more and more detailed games, and developers trying to give that need to produce larger and larger texture files. And 76 has hundreds of objects each with their own textures, as well as LOD textures mind you, so the file size makes sense.
---
Still no content in the game other than farming legendaries in a game with a brutal RNG which makes trading the only way to acquire the gear you want.
---
Now dupers will have their own servers to make hundreds dupes so that when you go to trade for the gear you want, your bid will instantly be crushed by some guy offering 5 Legacy weapons.
---
Clearly you have zero idea how private servers work in every other single title that offers such a feature. They are a completely separate entity from official servers, whatever is done on them doesn't effect official servers. The only reason we don't have that is because Bethesda knows admins of those servers would fix their glitchy game and then no one would have a reason to play official.
---
Nice deflection. Pay to win with other stuff via a pay wall is predatory...
---
Nope, that was my phone's autoincorrect!  You typed 'on me'.
---
Still. $12.99 is nothing.
---
On the brink of rage, that's where. The game is expensive enough to play as it is. We don't need to be charged for extra stuff that should be free
---
You're right. The team for making actual content and AS probably aren't the same, but as it's clearly been showed that there are more people working on AS content rather than actual game content.
---
You're also missing that the subscription benifit for your stash proves that Bethesda lied that they couldn't expand stash because of server stability. The truth is they wanted to make you pay for it instead. You are also right that this isn't what the game engine was meant to do and it's reduced flexibility of devs which is why they shouldn't have just basterdized the engine into doing it and used a different one
---
Source?
---
To find 24 people gullible enough to pay for FO1st?
---
Maybe. I've always said NW was going to go free to play after they smooth out the issues. It would be a really good move imo. NW is fun as hell, people would flock to it if it was perfected.
---
I didnt even buy the game at all. No matter what, I am putting my money where my mouth is. Sure I may seem irrational to only purchase major releases on steam but hey it helped me dodge a bullet known as Fallout 76. 
---
It's also why I'm planning on waiting the extra few months for RDR2 to launch on steam. I am not giving rockstar any ideas, even if they essentially give you the cost of the game in rockstar titles like LA Noire.
---
I don’t see anything wrong people will still buy stuff
---
Your math is bullshit...
---
its 94.96.. tax is probably pushing it to around $110 at most. Also obviously you got 76 on a sales day so you just made yourself look like an ass.
---
That's why i explicitly said "crafting mats are just one entry" and "It would be different if you got unlimited storage for everything". But for Scrap there is none of that. Yes, if you can take scrap out of your stash you can put something else in, so unlimited scraps is going to put a little more load on the server. But somehow i doubt that that server runs on dollar bills so if it can handle that if i pay 16 bucks(and yes, it's 16 in €, not 12)  then it can handle that if i don't. Unless Bethesda has invented some kind of system that can convert money into computing power.
---
I especially love the whole “it’s pay to win” argument being thrown about. Unless they add a junk jet and count this junk/scrap container as it’s ammo capacity there is nothing at all even remotely pay to win.
---
Check today's patch notes. Fallout 1 is a 17.99 USD monthly subscription for private servers and a couple other things.
---
real money transaction. buying items for cash.
---
So you can claim it is pay to win but can't actually make the argument yourself?
---
Or, it could be bethesda's constant lies and going back on their word.
---
The fact that they copy pasted for and all of its bugs, releasing a half baked game for triple a prices.
---
It could be the fact they false advertised most of the merch and substitute it for far poorer quality.
---
But yeah, it must be people wanting "free gameplay."
---
I mean I understand we already paid for the game. But I'm looking at this as another perspective. I work. I don't have time to grind all day and night. Believe me I would love to. I'm the type of guy who used console commands on my PC even after I beat part 4 on the PS4. Just to increase my carry weight to 50,000. I know that's a little bit extreme but why can't this be done? There's got to be a way around this there's somebody that knows how to fix this... backpack does nothing at all. I want 6 different kinds of power armour at all time. And I don't want to have to waste my perk points in putting into they will weigh less. Would rather put them into points that cause damage or defend.. this is a missed opportunity for this company to make money. I know people complain about money all the time. But a couple box isn't going to destroy somebody. The way I see it you can spend your money must foolishly. We're going into 2020 with a game that is restricting you on how much you can possibly carry in your stash. So make it optionable for those that want to carry more for a few bucks
---
*game crashes just before the boom.
---
Dang
---
99.99 is a lot when I get ps plus for 60 a year and get monthly free games ( this month it’s  the last of us )  and lots of discounts .
---
With this cash-grab of a server sub system, I feel like my dreams of a persistent 76 world are dead.
---
The problem isn't the team size, it's that the game released before they finished development. They only had 3 to 3 and half years of development. ESO took 7 years to make, and then a few years to actually get good. Final Fantasy 14 took 5 years to make and they had to completely shut the game down and remake it to make it good. Most of the team is working on things that would normally be finished before the game is released, so new content comes in very slowly.
---
Or maybe the subscription is to help pay for wastelanders? Considering it wasn't part of the game? And people complained so much about a product that was exactly what it was advertised as? And now Bethesda is essentially creating an entire new game to add into 76? If you don't want to pay for something that was never supposed to be a part of the game that you paid for, just don't buy a subscription.
---
Lol that's fair. I also work 50 hours a week and make an above average salary.  Nothing crazy.  But its mindsets like this that allow devs to get away with locking progression behind paywalls. 5 years ago you didnt have to pay for items like this. Just disheartening. But have fun. I'm not trying to ruin anyone's day.  
---
Imagine your favorite sports team signing a player that is best ever but just got out of prison for hitting a woman. It's like that. Good for team cause he's a good sports player but on a personal moral and ethical level, its shit. Bethesda will make money and people with have fun. But I'm out.
---
you will be surprised how many people will buy this, it's actually amazing deal.
---
Usually they're down until they're back up.
---
Bethedsa can say fuck all. Sooner or later someone is going to push a hacked private server function and then use mods from the Nexus, it's bound to happen.
---
I paid 60$ for a game, last time I checked ain't I suppose to play the game in a way that I like rather than a way some bullshit company wants me to play?
---
What's next? 19,99$ subscription to play the singleplayer campaign. Another 19,99$ for the coop experience, and 19,99$ for the online subscription. Another 14,99$ if you want private servers.
---
Oh you can get it all for 59,99$ subscription package deal.
---
Fuck - em.
---
F
---
They would not go into great detail, just that the rares were supposed to be a bit more common then they were.
---
"And to say, the Atomic shop is cosmetic stuff. To make sure folks understand--look there's a line. There are people who have crossed it, but we're going to stay on the right side of it in terms of the things you can spend money on and how this stuff works."
---
  -Pete Hines
---
Crazy. I get a "Coming soon" message every time.
---
EDIT: Nevermind. Chrome was loading from cache for some reason.
---
Oh no, this is bringing bad PR no matter what happens. They delayed a content update so they could charge the playerbase in a pay to play game for features they said were impossible to implement or would be very challenging.
---
This is honestly just gonna boost awareness for Outer Worlds.
---
Why play shitty Fallout 76 that makes you pay 12 bucks a month for basic features when you can get gamepass for 10 bucks a month with tons of games including the game inspired by Fallout and made by the original Fallout creators?
---
This is still dumb. It's not like every item needs to be constantly loaded in inventory. Only one set of data needs to be in place, just keep track of how many each player has.
---
If everyone took the membership they'd be getting a fuck ton of money so they could easily scale up their servers.
---
considering buying Modern Warfare because you're mad about how bad bethesda and FO76 is, is like ringing up hitler to see if he wants to hang because Pol Pot hurt your feelings. 
---
Seriously though, don't give activision or bethesda anymore money till they cut their shit out
---
Yeah, if you do them one by one.
---
😆, keeping the game alive for us all...how sweet, too bad...its been dead for quite some time. Anyone who plays is keeping the game "alive", not just people who eat up the atom shop garbage or feel special cause they are willing to waste $13 a month for not a whole lot of value, you are just buying Atoms and getting a couple incentives for buying said Atoms...you are not special, dumb, but certainly not special.
---
It's the most recent Inside the Vault
---
After 12 months of $4.99 I’ll have paid the price of one full game while having played through dozens of full games instead of just one.
---
And PC doesn’t have Game Pass ultimate. It’s all one single pass at one single price. This isn’t just about the Outer Worlds, it’s about every game included on the Game Pass (Metro Exodus, Forza 4, Shadow of War, etc)
---
I’m actually shocked F76 even has fanboys like you. Lmao
---
Damn fair point
---
It’s kind of hard for them to take the time to fix private servers before releasing them with all the hate they are getting for delaying the other update.
---
ohhhh sorry, I uninstalled the game.
---
A large portion of people wanting private servers wanted them to have a persistent community on a single server dedicated to like players. This what private servers have always been for. Never has there been a server that the admin/owner/renter needed to be on the server for anyone be on it. 
---
A community cannot even begin to grab a foot hold with what we have. They are better off using public servers and trying to get everyone on the same one.
---
What we have right now is nothing more than a p2p system with a timed auto kick after host leaves instead of instant.
---
not if they were hosted locally, which is what most og players wanted from the beginning. back in November, when people brought up private servers, they actually meant private. offline. not a subscription service.
---
I want to mod the game and play it like I did with past titles, not to be permanently tethered to Bethesda's services. which suck, by the way.
---
i totally see that happening , even the name suggests that can happen
---
I couldn't take all the denial, money grab after money grab. I had to get out, and honestly not thinking about this game or playing it is a lot healthier.
---
👋🏻 bye
---
They will ratchet this shit up until it is no longer profitable. Clearly they are only interested in the whales who will pay any price for an advantage. I got my $60 worth of value from the game but the string of bonehead moves and bad PR kept all my friends out of the game so I pretty much played solo through everything. I enjoyed the base gameplay concepts but I can’t see myself ever coming back. Unfortunately I think this has turned me away from any game this company produces or publishes in the future because this type of monetization needs to die a harsh death.
---
Grow up
---
QQ
---
THEN DONT GET THE SUBSCRIPTION
---
Quit acting like this somehow prevents you from playing the game
---
&gt; literally shouting at a company to make something for you and expect it to be free after they spent time and money to create it is beyond naive. Nothing has ever worked that way in the history of ever.
---
Video games with ongoing updates that aren't under a subscription at the time of purchase do operate this way though. At the time these suggestions were made, the understanding was that the game would be updated for free as they made their money through skins and crap like that not gameplay altering things. I don't think anyone is demanding payment for their idea being included in the game. The outrage is over a pay wall being put up, months after the game was released with no mention of such a paywall that include some of these community suggestions that were volunteered under a different set of circumstances.
---
Should have been more subtle I suppose
---
Honestly this price is no different from what ark servers are charging. Plus they will be adding the ability to mod. Which once mods hit a server (not sure about xbox or ps4 yet) it will be a completely different game. Cosmetics and all that made by Bethesda's behind a paywall and then cosmetics made by modders which will be free. 
---
Once the modding community gets a hold of this game it will be an entirely different beast. At least that's my opinion based on what the modding community has done for games like skyrim fallout 3 and 4 and games like ark.
---
Because it actually made sense. And there was actual evidence to support it with item duplication. So by all accounts, it made sense and seemed legit.
---
But hay, blanket labeling people "fanboys" is the hip thing to do, I guess.
---
It's not really an MMO, though. It's an always-on survival RPG with multiplayer elements. An MMO is a different beast.
---
Nooooooooooooooooooo all those 1 star robot limbs gone to waste..
---
Thing about ESO, it’s worth it with all the content it churns out.
---
The scrap box should be stand alone since you can use it in a public server
---
We’ll see if modern warfare is better than previous ones, haven’t bought cod in awhile
---
You enjoy it? YOU ENJOY IT??? 
---
Why I've literally chewed my tongue off in rage so now I can only type my outrage. I"M g0ing to Ch3w ofF my FINgrS mn0W jhbfdc9o;iuj     mrl;kokl;0-i9o  m,k
---
"I modded their games therefore I am basically a triple A developer that understands large scale database storage and normalisation"
---
I hate it when modders get too big for their boots.
---
I feel like this game was really making progress to not being a laughing stock. I played at launch and didn't really play again till last week and the gam has changed so much for the better, on top of us getting the wastelanders update that everyone is excited for. Now Bethesda is pulling this and it's just instantly killing any good will the game has built up over the last year, and once again the game is a laughing stock. I don't know what happened to Bethesda, but this is one hell of a power move that is just going to/is backfiring immensely.
---
Yeah we should get like 50% off of that subscription thing or something
---
Ha! Exactly something a welfare monger that leeches off society and has never done a single day of hard work would say. I’m sorry you don’t have 10 bucks a month of disposable income, but don’t take out your anger out on the rest of the world. Look into going to college or a trade school. Shit, if you want I’ll toss you a few bucks to muck stalls on my ranch. Make sure to stay positive, just because you need to ask your mom for an allowance at the age of 27 doesn’t mean you’re a failure.
---
I drew the line after Bethesda's baffling poor handling of 76's release, and that line is now a canyon. I will not be buying any more Bethesda products until they earn back my trust, and that will take a lot of doing. At their current pace any new game from them will not even be worth the bandwidth to pirate.
---
Me too. I was wonder if it was just me.
---
No. Most of them don't delete their game and keep playing, or take breaks and come back later. It's the same thing with the boycott crowds, they scream it but don't practice it.
---
Its fine being upset, I'm upset even angry, but it's made for people that want it and will pay for it. It's not a competitive game and it's not a MMO so everything is ignorable. Wastelander will make or break the game as far as I'm concerned, they fail there and it's done. But as far as this is concerned, people should of seen it coming, it's an online game and its the new norm.
---
If people actually stood by their words and really did do as they say, then maybe things would change. But people rarely if ever stick to their guns.
---
no problemo
---
It’s okay, just wanted to finally get in on the game, played a free weekend and while lonely it was worth buying now that it’s on sale
---
&gt;Also obviously you got 76 on a sales day so you just made yourself look like an ass.
---
76 has been 17$ pretty much every day since free week.
---
Wallmart has it for 16$ right now.
---
Also, the 110$ ARK: Survival Evolved Explorer's Edition does not include the most recent expansion pack, which costs... hmmm.... , what is  144$ minus 110$?  35$ fuck, idono, I am an ass with bullshit math, maybe you check the figures for me.
---
I'm going in with that expectation in order to avoid disappointment, but I'll be buying regardless
---
:/ dude your talking about an mmo compared to a linear story driven rpg. Yeah outer worlds will have plenty of replay value and a die hard cult following, but theres no way it can replace a multiplayer fallout game. Sure fallout might see a dip in players for a bit but people will be back and more noobs will join too.
---
STOP. DEFENDING. THIS.
---
It's 2019, not 1995! Don't fucking DARE to defend these practices. Just don't fucking DARE. Saving a FUCKING item into a database is not an expensive operation. And don't act like storage is expensive. 
---
Just STOP defending this piece of shit company and their early access crap they charged full price for.
---
K👍🏽
---
Or just make the scrap box free. They're creating a problem and then selling the solution.
---
And it might actually be playable on a private world. It's been so laggy up to this point that standard and expert were a crapshoot whether lag would cause you to fail.
---
Fallout 5? You mean Outer Worlds?
---
Foolishly bought the game thinking they'd sensibly use the Conan Exiles server model. My own fault, but I really regret buying this game.
---
&gt; You're also missing that the subscription benifit for your stash proves that Bethesda lied that they couldn't expand stash because of server stability. The truth is they wanted to make you pay for it instead
---
We can judge that when we actually see the private servers in action, yeah? When I read that it sounded more like "on our servers, where we're hosting way more people we have concerns about instability. You can feel free to make or break your own server as you want." I will be interested to see how the most popular private servers perform when large player counts start interacting with looser stash limits. 
---
&gt; which is why they shouldn't have just basterdized the engine into doing it and used a different one
---
I don't know enough about game engines to make that call. I will say however that one of the main selling points to me was how 1:1 Fallout 76 feels with Fallout 4. I wouldn't have bought it if it was like ESO, where it was clearly an MMO game with a Skyrim-ish skin.
---
Single player mode was never promised, this was never going to be a single player game
---
Private servers were promised but if you thought they would be free you're an idiot
---
I was never a member on RuneScape in 2004 but I still got a weird amount of time out of it
---
Why thank you my good sir/ma'am/insert_prefered_title_here, I thought comparing money grabbing to an addiction was a good idea in this case
---
Don’t be a shit head, of course it’s p2w. You get unlimited scrap space seperate to the stash, so you replace all the junk currently in your stash with weapons, armour etc, which means extra stash space comes along with the unlimited junk. You can’t have that without paying.
---
Probably a wise choice. This sort of stuff happens in failing MMO's all the time. Next, free-to-play will come, along with more cash store options. This game isn't worth your money.
---
*not related to your reply, just saying it generally"
---
Also people that downvoted my post is literally newborns that haven't experienced the golden age of gaming.
---
How someone can be so fucking dense to stand up and defend this kind of behaviour is fucking sick.
---
This in no way constitutes a class action law suit.  It hurts your feels but they will laugh at your insinuated threats. Also, vent brotha! That’s what reddit is for.
---
I guess yeh
---
You can suck a sack of diseased farrel ghoul genitals if you think that people will pay that kind of money for this broken game.
---
And to the one who down voted. You a communist then?
---
Read the post you just commented on.  Scrap storage stores scrap items and the stuff that hits server load the hardest is unique items with variables stored for mods and condition.
---
Its actually a miracle that there is anyone left to complain about this game in the first place. Honestly, what did you expect at this point?
---
It’s called “Fallout 1st” for a reason. I doubt the delay of Wastelanders and this news is a coincidence. Fully prepared to hear that members will have access to Wastelanders first and that the work on private servers helped make both Wastelanders and OG servers viable.
---
I've spent $60 on the game, and I am going to spend $12.99 for one month of 1st.
---
Woaaaahhhhhh
---
I agree and I am not complaining about the subscriptions I am complaining about Todd getting on stage saying eventually there will be a single player mode but not a launch
---
What platform are you on? If you are moving on and on PC I am collecting anything you may give to help out my friends who don't get to play as much anymore and who don't get to grind out gear. If you want you can PM me you bnet name if you are on PC.
---
Someone discovered the word “shill” today it seems. I have no reason to buy this, I don’t need to buy this, and the game is still the game I bought originally. You’ve provided no justifiable arguments, hell, no arguments what so ever. And have opted to try to personally attack people by calling them a “shill”. But hey, tantrums are cool right?
---
Congrats on finally realizing you're a joke. That's more than most people here. Every person has one big game they regretted. 
---
Can't say people would have fallen for the scam as long as you did, but better late than never. The hardest part will be looking at your peers in the eye as they judge your choices for the next month as the "Fallout Guy," but it'll pass eventually.
---
Remember this next time people warn you about a game before release.
---
And being a dismissive asshole, hows that working out for you?
---
Yep. They are strongarming us into buying the service. Instead of a nice bonus to the subscribers it feels like kick in the nuts for us not willing to subscribe.
---
Thanks for the useful input
---
Me too, I've been following the updates even though I haven't played in months. Today I finally uninstalled the game and Bethesda launcher altogether. The saddest part is until now I still had a relatively high amount of hope for the game.
---
Geez over react much? The duping issues are way more serious. Stash boxes will affect the scrap available in vendors, that's a valid point. Right now all excess gets bulk and sold to the station daily. Acid bulk at 25 and screws at 2 are the things I keep in my vendor because of space. End game players have scrap figured out and usually have a mule anyway to store the guns and armor too. I see the point from a low level perspective. It makes it a lot easier on newbies to make money in game.
---
The second camp locked behind the paywall does have a cost savings attached too. I spend a lot of caps hopping around the map, but I make it back in the vending. All this stuff helps the lower end player is all. It's not a p2w for smarter guys. The cosmetic lock and atoms bothers me more. They could have offered the server for 12 a month, none of the add-ons and that would have been fine. Stops the disconnects from the duping jackass and vault raids can finally be done duo without the lag. If it fixes the lag, that's worth it.
---
They probably not making enough in the atom store, so trying too hard to get the current base to buy in. All they needed was private servers for the lag issues.
---
What do you think fast travel is? "Teleportation"??
---
Higher than New Vegas!
---
Lol all the down votes I got calling this mess what it was at launch feels good
---
LOL This is what you all wanted. Private servers and all this. Why couldn't we just say 'we need better server stability'? The reason for private servers was to kill off PVP community and now people gotta pay to avoid it with actual cash. LOL
---
Sorry but I think you've tripped and hit your head. You seem to have confused suggestions to improve a weak base game, and bring it in line with its triple-A price tag, to be begging for game devs to create things for 'free'.
---
Let me share something you may have forgotten during your irrelevant argument about intellectual property laws:
---
[https://www.metacritic.com/game/pc/fallout-76](https://www.metacritic.com/game/pc/fallout-76)
---
There's a reason this game has garnered nearly universal disdain from critics and numerous backlashes from players. It was NOT a well designed, polished game from launch, and Bethesda have not yet brought it to that state even a year later. They were well aware of its many, many problems at release, too-- they gave us all an open letter saying as much-- so don't try to hand me any nonsense about subjectivity. This game has been riddled with issues from the start, and current players submitting ideas to make the game better so it's more fun for everyone and more appealing for new players are not some detached collection of beggars as you make them out to be. They're trying to help Bethesda turn a turd into a win.
---
No, you're just ignoring context so you can focus entirely on some simplistic argument about intellectual property. So sad.
---
Who cares one side or the other we all lost, were all disappointed and untrustworthy of Bethesda in some way, and they should be the one to feel our pain.
---
Bud, you're not making a winning case. Everybody is in agreement, you didn't prepare properly. Besides, you can have the highest defense rating in the game, and there is enough exploits in damage to 1HKO yours and everybody elses ass. P2W, not even close, this ain't winning. This is convenience. If it was P2W, the sub would yield you free 5 star legendary weapon and armor set that would require a year of grinding otherwise to compare and still only have a fraction of that power.
---
EDIT: On the other hand, they can have a server all to themselves, and exploit the fuck out of it, like Legendary Farming events without the intrusion of idiots, or being able to Hunt the SBQ with a close group of friends who aren't useless :D
---
It sounds like you’ll be back before wastelanders.  The general talk around here is TOW isn’t a long term content heavy game.  Keep your items because it’s a revolving door, we all know you’re coming back.
---
The statement in the patch notes is saying that even Fasnacht masks can be worn to the event.
---
They literally took all of our suggestions and want us to pay for them.
---
I haven't played in a month and I come back to this shit? Dude, f#@k Bethesda.
---
Yes, in the Atomic Shop there is an item that is a map of the game that glows in the dark, it is available in the shop for everyone. 
---
I think it's dumb that this item in real life comes in the CE and if you buy the CE you don't have it for free
---
This is why i hate the," you need to pay for the devs" bullshit responses. Most games go without making money for 5-10 years under their parent companies and then release a product and start making money.
---
This game was bethesdas Dayz
---
Your friend is a jerk, Todd is a great comedian who, like anyone else, deserves his privacy.
---
Imagine being that the only comment you can say to someone when you don’t even have proof of them doing so. 
---
Well if you didn’t complain about the refrigerator being “pay to win” like you are complaining about private servers being “pay to win” I can only guess :) 
---
If $12.99 is too much for you after we haven’t been charged for any of the dlc’s like ark and Conan and battlefield and you want to say battlefield is better because you only have to pay $1.99 a day for ps4 and Xbox when pc users have to pay $2.99 a day then by all means, complain your heart out. You sound like a fool anyways 🤷🏻‍♀️ 
---

Oh and there’s a link so you can check out the different prices for battlefield 1 private servers. It’s the only battlefield game I played so that’s why I’m referencing it. 
---
Consider us lucky.
---
Y'all are always getting robbed when it comes to games down there, aren't y'all?
---
Boicott
---
I prefer blocker because it's strength based, and as an unarmed, I need to use 15 points there. I frequently find super mutants sneaking up on me, and "smashie, smashie", so 45% off of that is pretty nice. But YMMV. I don't know if Serendipity has a cool down, but it regularly procs for me.
---
They more than likely had a hand in it, alongside zenimax
---
Private servers cost money to host.   
---
I'm not defending this decision - There's a lot of BS in the implementation.   
---
But 8-12 dollars a month is on the higher end of normal for a private server.  
---
So the price is nothing really new.
---
Then guess what, don't buy it. It is not in anyway preventing you from playing
---
&gt; This was when the game was pretty new so no legendary stuff.
---
Oh, well, that makes that story completely irrelevant then, lol.
---
not if I'm playing offline. that's besides the point, though. because the whole point of "private" servers is having access to the files, mod them as we see fit and host them ourselves. locally or otherwise.
---
&gt;If you are talking about P2P, unfortunately the way the worlds are designed in this game, having it tied to a single user and not a 3rd party server wouldn't work.
---
modders made skyrim work. you'd assume Bethesda could make this dumpster fire work. or better yet, don't code it like that from the beginning.
---
if you look at the data folder this is just a glorified Fo4 hackjob stitched together. it was definitely done on purpose.
---
About the sad reality bit. The sad reality is that people fall into this scheme and put up with it. The devs only get away with it because there are so many little screechers who don't know what they're buying, and don't want to wait to find out. It's a manipulation ploy to make games a money hook, rather than an entertaining experience with the fear of boredom  if you don't pay up.
---
This subscription is atrocious. If 76 was Free to Play AND a polished game, mabye, but cmon man there is so, so, so much more value for your money elsewhere. Games that are fun and don't pry every gaming moment to push you to buy nonsense to get by.
---
Enjoy the game for what you already purchased, ahem... already purchased...  But at a minimum, consider not giving them more money until they release more content...
---
I beging to be scared about the fact that the NPCs could only be release in private servers for "making it more stable".
---
Do you not understand that a single player game and a multiplayer one work differently?
---
Storing items on your save file is a **lot** different than storing them in an online database.
---
To be fair anyone that bought this game should be putting into heir clown make up after all the shit you’ve jumped into despite the HUGE WARNINGS  🤡
---
&gt;robbing them of their legendary tag rights, trolling them in-game, blocking their access to our C.A.M.Ps and whatnot.
---
😂 I'll just retreat to my private server where I get to launch private nukes, capture all workshops on the map with no griefers to bother me, and farm every damn legendary I want.
---
&gt; I will probably sub for 1 month to get the ranger outfit(smart move Bethesda) and then never touch it again.
---
Basically this. One month for the costume, icons, bonus Atoms, and whatever other random crap you get, and then you're done. 
---
Plus, hell - you probably won't have access to add stuff to your "craft bag" once you unsub, but it can be used to hold whatever is in there, and it's just another CAMP decoration at that point.
---
Only you can answer that. Fun is a subjective term and different for everyone... 
---
I personally don't enjoy single-player games anymore. They're just a thing of the past for me. I liked the Fallouts and Skyrim but I'd honestly never go back to playing games like that. Those lonely, empty worlds with nothing but NPCs that are coded to do very limited actions.
---
Even 5$, those features should be free and unlimited junk storage should've been included from the start
---
Good, now we know who to laugh at when we see them.
---
There is no mod support yet
---
i’m just happy the bobbleheads weight was decreased... dramatically!
---
I'll say right now at the start its really fun and hope you have a great time
---
Good one.
---
It literally isn't pay2win though. It's pay2progress/pay2skip.
---
You mean people who enjoy the game and not butt hurt about everything? 
---
I’ll defending a game I like by playing it and paying for what I want to pay for with money I earn...
---
&gt;They also give you 1500+ atoms/month...
---
Don't try to confuse the mob with facts and logic, they'll only attack you for it
---
Yeah, this is a big FU I feel, especially like a week after the delay of Wastelanders
---
I was a day one purchaser and I had my fun with it early but have not touched it in months and was kinda waiting / hoping for Wastelanders to be what brings me back into this.
---
But this is just a SLAPin the face and with all the bugs and fixes that are still needed they should not be charging anything extra for this. Or maybe price it like an Expansion for $20-$25, but even then that is too generous
---
If they want a subscription they HAVE to be 98%-100% bug free and stable. I have read there still alot of issues
---
Ah I’m in Chico. I’m working fire clean up around paradise and it’s so creepy blacked out at night.
---
Ps4 “thisisnttim”
---
With what it has it's not even a good deal, the subscription is a joke...
---
It’s been saying investigating for the past 2.5 hours :( 
---
Any idea why they do it prime time eu time?
---
https://bethesda.net/community/topic/369662/upcoming-fallout-76-maintenance-october-23-2019?language%5B%5D=en
---
Here you go! Maintenance usually doesn't last this long, but they are deploying an update, so it's kind of expected.
---
Paying for servers? Fine
---
Paying for a sub?  Fine
---
Making pay to win items in the sub usable on the public servers? Complete bullshit
---
All of you who plays this game are to blame. You have been warned of practices like this, yet you all went and bought that garbage game and gave them money. Keep being their whores.
---
people apparently want to act like all of a sudden you cant play the game without private servers, a junk box, and a tent....
---
Oh, really? Because I'm on steam right now and it's not.

I also don't agree with the features that are exclusive behind the locked paywall. At one point they said it wouldn't be pay to win. If you have unlimited storage and a fast travel point that you only get by paying... sounds like pay to win, or at least pay for convenience.
---
Need plenty of Stanley nickels for this.
---
Oh ya. That easily frees up a couple weapons for the ol box.
---
Prolly best to save all your real life caps and play the base game, regardless of the subscription price.  Nothing changes either way.
---
Yeah, everyone seems to think wastelanders will be like a brand new game but in reality it's still fo76 game performance with player looking npc's
---
Wait, you think that it will happen or it will happen? If you have to pay per month to have npc now that is another level of greedy
---
Nothing for me..
---
&gt;wait for starfield or tes6.
---
This makes me fearful for those game if they would do this kind of stuff with this game what stops them from doing the same in those?
---
I think you get access to the last big expansion when a new big expansion drops.
---
Conspiracy? I think so, Bethesda is siding with obsidian for a cut on the release of the outer worlds. Obviously that game won't be the train wreck that Fo76 is so they said fuck it well send you our players if you give us a 13% cut of your first month revenue.
---
/s I hope
---
He meant full release not alphas or beta releases. I believe they released Minecraft Realms on full release.
---
So you're uninstalling right?
---
You mean like the op’s and yours?
---
Well I hope they lubed me up first..
---
Never thought I'd see the day when somehow, out of all the big third party devs, EA has the best public image.
---
Lmao i'm not even going to lie im right there with you.
---
I think someone said down in 2018 that Vault Tec **IS** Bethesda at this point
---
If you're gonna dump your stuff at least put it in a container, bags don't last long after you leave.
---
Exactly what I thought when i heard about it, "Oh a ESO copy cat subscription"
---
100 dollars for a year isn’t a ton of money even at minimum wage. Also at 1650 atoms a month, you get over 19000 a year which translates to over 150 bucks. It’s optional and you don’t have to pay.
---
Cost less than Netflix or Spotify, that's my thinking and that's probably how they came up with the price. 
---
It's a little high yeah, i think 7 quid a month flat fee would be better. Rather than making you pay a year upfront to get a better price.
---
It just depends on how much you like the game world i guess.

Seeds totally make sense in single player games in order to thwart the "save game-open chest-reload game" shuffle. If you save the seed, the loot rolls will stay the same across saves/reloads. I don't think Fallout 4 had this, so I don't believe 76 does unless very strong evidence comes up, which I so far haven't seen. If 4 had such a mechanic, I can totally believe that BGS would have left this in for 76, even though it doesn't make a lick of sense in an MMO where you can't save/reload and where you want all important RNG rolls to happen on the server.
---
A few thousand drops are actually a good start, you ought to be able to get some good data on single-effect drop chance out of those. For combinations of 2 effects, you'll want tens of thousand of samples, for combinations of all three tiers you're looking at hundreds of thousand of samples to get enough data so you can hope for reasonably reliable results. If you want the possibility to analyse the existence of per-character seeds, those numbers apply *per character, from multiple characters*. Sorry, but them's the maths.
---
Analysing legendary drops from mobs is tough because stuff like location and mob level might get into play, influencing base item drop chances and (because not all base items have the same list of permitted legendary effects) hence legendary effect chances. So the purveyor is your best bet. The only way I see to get reliable data is to ask people to contribute, in as controlled a manner as possible: They'll need to note down *every* drop from the purveyor during, say, one week or one month of play, or from spending the whole 1000 scrip, or some other well-defined circumstances, then share the *raw* data with you, e.g. in a wiki or Google spreadsheet. Additional required information would be the time when the drops were recorded, since patches might change drop chances.
---
As for the explosive weapons, that does sound unlikely, provided you've looted the thousands of legendaries on your main that I assume you have, since you've likely played a lot since launch. Now, Explosive is a T2 effect, so only exists on 2\* and 3\* legendaries, which are probably a distinct minority, but still, I can see why you'd be invested in finding this out.
---
I agree. I'm not completely onboard the hate train yet, but I am disappointed that it's not a persistent server.  I don't mind dropping the cash so my friends and family have a "safe" place to enjoy the game together. But we are all working adults, coordinating online time together like this won't make the investment worth it.  I'm ambivalent towards all the other "goodies."
---
Hey man, no need to be rude. I’m still going to be playing the game, but that doesn’t mean I can’t voice some concern over making Adventure Mode into a two tier experience.
---
Most of their stuff is Eastern US-based. Good for most people working, but not for Europeans and college students like me that get out around 12
---
But despite the means, releasing Skyrim on every platform possible was a good thing. It's one of the best games of this decade and many people want to play it on their platform of choice. Even Skyrim VR is one of the better games to get for VR. It was a cash cow, but a good cash cow...
---
Now they've killed their youngest cow and try to sell it's rotting carcass as a subscription...
---
Wait is the game going subscription only or is OP overreacting?
---
I dont understand this. You can buy a system, game, internet, food, water etc, but 12 bucks is the line past poverty?
---
That is the same line of thinking that I have.
---
This information would’ve been so nice last night😂
---
Tbh they should have done it the other way.
---
Private servers with NPCs would actually be fun, I can’t see how running around in an empty world with just you, a handful of people and some creatures is going to be fun.
---
Thats fucking rude
---
So you're saying... they lied to us...? 😐
---
I've been mocking the outrage throughout the forums because the entitlement mentality behind it sickens me, but this post seems far more well reasoned than the "OMG, Bethesda sucks, boycott, boycott boycott" drivel clogging up the server.
---
My thoughts are roughly parallel to this. The private servers don't offer enough to make it worth it.  I've paid for and ran TF2 servers - so I understand and am sympathetic to the costs of server equipment that Bethesda faces. But the value proposition isn't there in what they are offering. Specifically:
---
1. TENTs are a nice to have, not a must have.
---
2. Scrap stashing just removes one front of the headache of inventory management, but it honestly isn't worth the bad press of its inclusion.
---
3. Private servers need the following for me even consider them:
---
   1. Persistence
---
   2. Difficulty control.
---
   3. Public as an option. I don't mind having randoms on my server if they want to share my experience.
---
   4. I control the build limits on a per user basis.  If I want to crash the server with teddy bears, so be it. If I want to deny that to my friends and randoms that might stop by, so be it.
---
   5. Mods - even if it's of the walled garden variety. A major obstacle to this is Bethesda is going to have to give modders CLI access to the servers and some ability to add files and resources to those servers - and a method to back that up on their machine.
---
For the moment - it's a curiosity to me. The reddit rage it is inspiring amuses me. I'll enjoy the game either way. I'm not planning on buying it yet because what would justify the expense to me isn't there yet. But this is a step towards it.

Later fellow nerds. I’m done with this crap.

Just wait till the turd all over TES series, it's coming

Well thanks for the info. Guess I’ll wait a little longer otherwise I check back tomorrow. :)
---
Game Pass is amazing. I have a PC, Switch and PS4 - used to be an XBOX boy (original + 360), but I skipped out on the XB1 because Microsoft shit the bed out of the gate.
---
Since it launched for PC in June, Game Pass has completely taken over my gaming time on PC. Not only is it a good deal, but the library is FANTASTIC. It's a great deal even at normal price let alone the $1/month promos they have been running for new subscribers. Played Blazing Chrome the day it came out, played Gears 5 the day it came out, and now I have The Outer Worlds pre-loaded and am super hyped for it.
---
It's taken over pretty much 100% of my PC gaming time. I launched Steam for the first time in months this week to play Call of Duty WWII (since I got it in the Humble Monthly) but that's it.
---
Repair Kits, Scrap Kits, Fridge, Ressource Collecting Robot, This. Yes none of that is a big advantage but all of that is not "Cosmetics Only". All of that is another broken promise. So yes, time and time and time again.

---
So do you get infinite stash limit on all servers, or do you only get infinite stash on your own private server?
---
That said with endless scrap you can make any item in the game infinite times as long as its not legendary.
---
 Legendary power armor now could even theoretically be produced infinitely.
---
If someone wanted they could save up 500000 of everything and make 10000p tesla rifles and fuck a server up qith their own character going way of space limitations and walk around
---
Thats not the point, the point is those should be free and included in the game. Unlimited junk shouldve been done from the start.
---
There it is. Infinite scrap storage isn't some coding nightmare that'd be impossible to do, it's just something they wanted to charge for.
---
Those downvoting or the fanboys and hanger-ons. Truth hurts.
---
Definitely is and I wasn’t asking. If it makes you feel better to pretend it isn’t, go right head. Not healthy though.
---
Enjoy getting deepthroated by Bethesda boots and thrown around like a rag doll.
---
I'm not surprised you create time for DOZENS of single-player games in a year. Thats why you're worthless to society and just making Bezos-coin or Bill Pay-gates more rich.
---
I have 600+ hours in 76 and I spent $60 on launch and thats it. Multiple cosmetic bundles purchased with pure-gameplay atoms. Extremely worth it. Oh and I can't wait for driving 4. So many great new mechanics since driving 3. I'm actually shocked other-game-"fanboys" like you are spending time in another games forum harassing its users when you could just be playing single player game pass games for years and years alone.
---
Lol right but now those npcs won’t be there
---
I think a silly hat would be reasonable to expect. I mean by now they probably have all the silly hats you can imagine, but there's always room for more I suppose.
---
It doesn’t. At all. It’s a game.
---
There's literally zero proof they delayed Wastelander's to implement the Fallout 1st subscription stuff. You're making assumptions and then bitching about your assumptions.
---
Oh, and look, you're a T_D user. Doing a little salt mining, heh?
---
Since the release of f76 they turned from one of my favorite company to my most hated.
---
Perfect
---
What’s the ratio of Stanley Nickels to Bethesda Atoms?
---
Ideas I came up with to fix the subscription: DEL
---
Alternative: "we're sorry we charged you any amount for an incomplete, buggy, empty game. And since we have only released content that is either outright garbage or, at best, somewhere south of mediocre, here is a bunch of free stuff as compensation.
---
If that doesn't tell you everything you need to know, then I can't either.
---
&gt;Allowing bethesda to fleece you for as much as they can is one thing,  
---
&gt; I'm not trying to slam you for enjoying the game  
---
pick one fucktard
---
Because they think they know whats best. Not the person buying the game. We can't possibly know the reason why we bought it and wanted the game. Only suits that never met us or even know we exists knows what we want.
---
its back on now
---
Hey look, Greed wins again, so shocked. Thanks Bethesda, for the 400 hours I got out of the shell of Fallout 76. Deleted off the ol’ Xbox like a bandaid ripped out to get it over with. Here’s to Outer Worlds hopefully scratching the itch that Fallout used to.
---
BYE
---
You're gonna get downvoted to hell and back, but you are 100% correct. This community have their entitled heads up their asses about this. Things cost money! News at 11...
---
All good. Still, fuck bethesda for this.
---
Have a great day and may all your drops be 3*
---
That is a maybe... if they include AYP (as you play) so if you miss days because you are a wageslave you get to play a FULL month or year period without getting fucked over.
---
And they drop the yearly price by a HUGE chunk...
---
They probably just made more money than launch day, and are scrooge McDuck swan diving into a pool filled with $100 bills and redditors' tears.
---
And eventually mods will be a thing. All these things should be free.
---
It's online now.
---
If you do it everyday then you dont play the game right. Junk collection is a part of everything else you do so it should happen naturally.
---
I thought witch burning was in the previous game. (In all seriousness though, I completely understand your position)
---
Anyone else planning to play any of the new games coming out?
---
Lol, and there is still nothing to fucking do in the game once the limited quests run dry and you have good gear. Embarrassed I bought it tbh.
---
Man I hope so
---
Clearly. I got downvoted for even bringing it up lol
---
That was a mistake, i mean them releasing this before wastelanders. Because yeah you're right, we have No idea what we will be getting next year, and we have No idea what will be added to the atomic shop either, which is why I will wait a little while longer. I've stayed strong not buying the fridge and the scrap robot, i can resist this too!
---
I’m in a server right now, just came back up.
---
Private servers have been a thing since the early days of online multiplayer.  I remember creating private servers for my friends and I to play Quake II DM.  Same for DooM and other games.  Paying for it is one thing, but the idea of private servers is nothing new and I like it.
---
Don’t forget to hit Fort Defiance every day for a uniform that hasn’t been nicked already.
---
If I asked my girlfriend to get me a online subscription that cost £100 I wouldn't be able to touch her for like 4 months...
---
£100 isn't that much to you, but is for others. And as far as supporting the game goes, they have everyone's money, plus the atom shop and still it's buggy with barely any content added. It's not like they've earned the benifit of the doubt or anything.
---
Pretty clear
---
Then go on a public server. No one is forcing you to be antisocial
---
Its 8 something a month for a private server. It's not persistent but you can invite 7 other players. It's actually dirt cheap. Running a persistent server for other games is around 80$ - 200$ a momth. Which is why you get spamed to donate.
---
People are just upset that everything is not free as usual.
---
In other news Red Dead Online is pretty fun now and I ranked up from 10-76 and completed all the new frontier pursuit roles in less than a month without spending a dollar and had enough money left over to go on a pretty wild shopping spree for dumb outfits.
---
I'm sure Bethesda wouldn't mind renting you a piece of properly toasted toast
---
You got scammed into a dead end job. I just made a minor loss on a game that I didn't enjoy as much as I thought I would. So yeah, you're pretty much feeling holier than thou because you hate your life.
---
But the huge difference is that ESO is a MMO and fallout 76 isnt. And wheres your source for "million of eso + subscribers" ...
---
I might be wrong but isn't gamepass ultimate cheaper then fallout 1st?
---
Pretty sure you're the deranged one here bud. It wasn't just on twitter. Interviews too. Not only that, you have an official statement confirming that was the promise just a few days ago
---
Okay, but it just makes you seem like a chump
---
Meh... I'm not that big on online play.  Only even bought a PSN subscription for Fallout 76 in the first place.  I'm fine with going back to the lonely life.  ;)
---
Ah, a T_D user. Back under your bridge troll.
---
While your at it download the outer worlds tommorow on the epic games launcher!!!!! /s
---
I have tons of end game gear (not that there's any real end game) and have never once used ammo in a trade.  If you're using ammo in a trade, more than likely you have shit gear and need "something on top" to make the deal a bit more sweet.  
---
As for doing PVP daily, either you mean with friends, which doesn't count, or with enemies, which means you're a turd pissing people off to the point they want to fight and kill you... Either way, storing junk is a marginal advantage are best that will only hurt people trying to get other people's junk when they die.  Also, guess what:  if they have that nifty box, they probably aren't going to be playing on your server anyway (since they have their own) so no real advantage to them over you.
---
Yet more noise without any valid arguments. Honestly it’s just pitiful.
---
Shouldn't have to pay more for exclusive content that should have already been there from the start
---
Someone should tell Bethesda. Website still says they're down.
---
*Bethesda*  - Hold up guys! Let me change this history to make it fit with all the other things we've crammed down your throat.
---
*Also Bethesda* - Give me your money so I can re write history, thanks guys, it will be done next year.
---
Just give me reach around or a rusty trombone.
---
Why are they booing you?  You're right.
---
Elaborate
---
Military canvas tents with nice post-apocalyptic patina go for as low as $15.
---
If you consider sinking more money and time into a game that's not worth either "reaping the benefits", I guess?
---
Woah wtf?!! At first I thought ok bit cheeky but seems decent but at 100?!! No way.. that a month or year?
---
I know Bethesda has to make money etc but this? That's a clear ripoff and that really does upset me
---
Every single bug in the game being fixed in One update
---
they arent even rival games what are people smoking
---
... are they?
---
While some have gotten in, I don't have a green light in the Bethesda Launcher (even refreshing), no official blurb about it either.
---
EDIT: It is now.
---
Nothing I didn't already know. If you think it's going to be different then I'm sorry for your loss in advance. I'm not wasting anymore money.
---
As far as I can tell Minecraft is not available on PC through game pass.  I was going to try playing it for the first time ever, but even with game pass on PC it wanted to charge me full price.  I also went to the official games list for the PC service and it was not included.  I can't access the official list atm, but here is an old copy.
---
https://www.pcgamer.com/xbox-game-pass-pc-game-list/
---
Includes Minecraft Dungeons (which is not out), but not regular Minecraft.
---
Best experience ever with ttw
---
The same dev team as outer worlds
---
&gt;Oh you sweet child... 
---
I stopped reading at this. For all I know, you very well could have some good insight on this game, but I'll never know because of these four words.
---
Are you realy comparing singleplayer game stuff to MMO stuff ?
---
Well no, you won't, because they'll be on private servers.
---
I hope not.
---
In other news Red Dead Online is pretty fun now and I was able to level through all the new roles in less than a month without spending a dollar.
---
Sad to say they were right? Wow you all sucking Bethesda's dick right until the end huh?
---
Thank the gods, that the Bethesda launcher uninstalled this pile of junk from my hard drive itself...
---
&gt; I think you may have wasted your time. 🤷🏻‍♂️
---
Oh those precious seconds
---
Grafton mayor is still there 😂
---
It’s the same as buying the 1000 atom pack every month for a year.... and getting everything else.
---
I don't get why people want to play solo since most of the missions you play on your own anyway. Having other people lurking around just makes the world more alive
---
Well...bye..just as well, the community doesnt need your idiotic toxicity. Might I suggest my little pony or a care bears title?
---

---
They are, I don’t have a green light either but it’s working.
---
Man, you can spot the Bethesda shills from a mile away.  You're doing a good job, I hope they are paying you well.  As an aside, I'd kept that resume updated, though, I don't see your services being needed for too long.
---
Don't lie... You were either never going to get the game or you already got it and are just looking for hatemob upvotes...
---
Welcome to the real world. We are glad to have you. Now work to get a better job and you can afford better things. No one should bend over for you if you’re complacent with a minimum wage job. Work your way up and you can afford nice things.
---
There is really no need for that. Stop playing the game, stop buying things from the Atomic Shop, maybe even leave this sub. These are all things that can have more impact than just reposting the same stuff over and over. After all, if there still are some suckers left to play this piece of crap, nothing said here will change their opinion.
---
LOL sucks when you get caught in your own contradictions doesn’t it?
---
The fact that you feel the need to bring T_D into this does explain the unstable/bipolar nature of your posts though.
---
But you'll have to pay per month to have your own world and play with mods? Lmao
---
They are smoking the dollar bills of their stupidest and most loyal fans.
---
This is the best analogy I've seen. I feel like this comment almost needs to be it's own separate post so people can see how screwed up Bethesda is.
---
Rideable bicycles, now with fallout 1st premium
---
Why in the world would they do that? They know you're willing to pay for an unfinished game so why wouldn't they try to get more money out of you?
---
"A fool and his money are soon parted" is a saying for a reason...
---
Tbh I don't even think Bethesda knows how to track this sort of thing by this point...
---
I’m willing to buy one month just to check out the features and get the outfit and atoms. Definitely would not go for the full year, let alone a second month
---
That's your right
---
I just find it insane that there's people still defending Bethesda...
---
I’ve just tictoc’d Todd
---
Stay safe, that stuff is probably toxic AF. Get some rad-x and radaway. But DON'T eat the giant orange mushrooms. xD
---
ESO actually releases content though. They also give tons of shit away for free, remember the event where they gave you a free huge mansion in Summerset?
---
Xbox is online
---
You do realize that attacking an opposing side accomplishes nothing?  Your basically just going to your side saying "Look how good I am for attacking them" meanwhile you just increase the resolve of the side you attacked.  Anyone one the fence is more likely to join the opposing side because they don't want to be associated with the toxicity. 
---
In other words, all you post is doing is circle-jerking with people who agree with you and actually driving people even more to buy the service.
---
Ah fair enough. I was also very excited for a multiplayer fallout, something about the world just suits the idea of grouping up together to survive the wastes. 
---
I'm holding out hope for a fallout mod in the vein of Skyrim Together, where they mod an existing fallout for coop/multiplayer play. Any mods you'd recommend for fallout 4?
---
Ur mum is cheaper than game pass, too.
---
Why u still on this fucking sub
---
yeah, I keep forgetting the special ones. I meant more their meshes than the designs themselves.
---
if there's one thing Fo4 did right it's PA and how bulky they look.
---
Remember when we were all pissed about $2 horse armor?
---
Those were the days.
---
I'm old.
---
Definitely hard to disagree with any of that, also pretty much sums up most if not every gaming community/forum at one point or another, (and probably just about anything else you could think of) not just Fallout!
---
At times it reminds me of when Bethesda first revealed Fallout 3. The howls of protest from many corners that it wasn't an isometric RPG like the first 2 games was immense.
---
&gt;Now weapons, armor, so on? Each requires a lot more to store.
---
What exactly though? This is game data, not video or audio data. Even if a player record with all items and related information was 64kB of data, you'd be looking at only a single modern top-of-the-range machine if you wanted to serve the entire human population. ( Half a petabyte )
---
Bethesda barely has moved 10m units here, so a more realistic figure is in the gigabyte range.
---
What magic pixie dust do they need to store that makes this such an issue?
---
Do you only have to pay once
---
the helmet looks too round, nothing like in FNV or promo material, looks like the F4 mod.
---
I agree that nobody else is doing better and I've complimented you for your data collections before, but you still don't have a sample size adequate to answer the questions you're asking, which means you're still spreading misinformation. You need a statistician or statistical training.
---
Came here for that same reason. Absolutely heartbreaking.
---
I think a lot of people have already.
---
You are right. I have the same feeling. 
---
I paid full price for this product and this thought that it will soon become free to play don't make me happy at all.
---
$13 a month, $100 a year, PA users get no cosmetic though. How is that not them being shafted just because the Atom Shop had PA skins?
---
To play devil's advocate, or attempt to act as a voice of reason, why would Bethesda do this?
---
We all purchased the game, and a transaction was finalized, complete with a contract that binds both parties to an agreement.  You and I had all the time in the world to read it before clicking "agree".  A receipt was printed or emailed, and within the agreement was likely a window to refund the product if you were not satisfied, either directly to the company or to a retailer. I believe Steam honors a refund after a small window of play time, like 5 or 9 hours.  I have no idea what Amazon, Game Stop or Walmart do.  If any of us were unhappy with the game at launch, we had our opportunity for a refund.  That ship sailed away long, long ago.  I digress.
---
I have no idea how many hours you've personally spend in Appalachia, but based on the fact that you post on the game's subreddit, I'm guessing it's more than a couple hours a week.  If there's an industry that replaces worn out and heavily used parts for free new ones and somehow makes a profit, please let me know what it is.  Sears used to do that with their Craftsman tool brand, and they're not doing great now.  Again, I have no idea how many hours you've logged in the game, but I feel confident that $60 investment was stretched out to pennies spent per hour of entertainment.
---
I would be removed by police or laughed out of the store if I drove my 2018 car to the dealership, sat myself down in the manager's office, and proceeded to demand new tires, an oil change, brakes, floor mats and wiper blades because I bought the car from them last year.  Could you imagine if I demanded they waive payment for all of 2020, simply because I magnanimously chose to buy a car from them?  Like I was doing them a favor?  That behavior would be classified as insane anywhere on the planet, but somehow it's not when it's on the internet?
---
Where does this sense of entitlement come from?  What is it about the video game industry that makes players think that they deserve so much?  Never get it twisted that the dealer is the addict's friend.  He might be nice to you, give you a bit of free product to sample, ask how you liked the last batch, but he is not your friend.
---
The only fault I see on Bethesda's part is being soft and gracious because of a rough start, offering a full year of DLC for free, and now the weaning phase is extra difficult when mommy needs to get back to work full time to keep baby warm and healthy.
---
Well a lot of the suggestions were back when "atom shop will only be cosmetic" was still true.
---
I already see this post getting downvoted to shit by fucking apologist like oh HoW ArE ThEy GoNna MaKe MoNEy but the hundred doller pass for private and mod servers like wtf is going on private servers should always be free in a game like this and mod are made by the community for the community but Bethesda always finds a way to capitalize i guess.
---
I am getting the sub tonight and consolidating all my junk. I will finally be able to store more than junk and some grape mentats in my stash!
---
I can’t freaking wait to buy this.
---
Bethesda screwed the pooch and should have offered this game as sub from the get go.
---
You broke kids that will buy RedBulls for 2 bucks a can each day whining about coughing up 15 bucks a month.
---
With a sub based game you get better experience...because they have the extra money to do things.
---
I feel like “Bethesda shitting the bed” is not enough. What’s a better way to say it lol.
---
True.  I'm pretty sure that the one I had dropped when doing a dropped connection event at Harpers Ferry but I've done a ton since.  
---
I'll try doing One Violent Night more often.  With the change to public event frequency, I should be able to get more runs in after the patch.
---
its just a costume lmfao
---
They reduced bobbleheads and magazine weights
---
pepperidge farm remembers
---
One of the best glitches! (Or is it a bug?)
---
Oh Bethesda dropped nukes alright
---
This is the one thing that people forget. No business makes a decision that will intentionally hurt themselves. Do you know why? Because they have teams of people who are experts in behavioral sciences. They have people who know exactly what they're doing.
---
You are not the type of player this change is for. You're not a whale. You're not suffering from the Fear of Missing Out. You're not suffering from the Sunk Cost Fallacy. Basically, you're not part of the ***vulnerable population of players who drive this industry to greater profits***.
---
All of this backlash is meaningless. As long as Bethesda has their loyal whales who are psychologically unable to escape their immortal, unethical manipulation, they'll continue monetizing it in more predatory ways. This is why we need heavy regulation.
---
Unfortunately, the entire games industry has turned gamers into their best defenders. "It'S A SlIpPerY SlOpE!" is often used as a defense against regulation here. And all I can ask is: Do you like to be treated like a farm animal? Do you like to be treated like you're not even human, but simple cattle to fuel their machine? They're not making games out of a love for entertainment. It's become twisted and warped and it is now only meant to be a revenue stream. Anyone who believes otherwise has simply not stepped back and looked at the industry over the last two decades. And it's heartbreaking that they refuse to see how we, as gamers, have been manipulated into being pawns in the endless battle for greater profits and millions of dollars in bonuses for executives like Todd Howard, who can brag to Elon Musk about buying the most expensive Tesla like it's nothing.
---
&gt; **Edit:** I can't wait for Jim Sterling's take on this. Hope he doesn't blow an artery. 
---
Jim Sterling is dead.  He saw this headline and rage-gasmed so hard his head exploded.
---
Go buy Outer Worlds. It's good!
---
Oh. I could have guessed you were one of those.
---
They did say that stuff is coming in the future. This is the problem with agile development. Nobody wants partial products and yet they also don’t want to wait.
---
If you've stuck with this game since launch, rolled through all the bugs, the terrible issues, the microtransactions, the pay-to-win features... this ain't going to matter. You'll pay it and feel honored to. There's literally nothing they can do to make you go away.
---
What's the big deal if it shuts down? Why keep it open ur nobody is there? As long as it saves your stuff like workshops. It does, right?
---
We shouldnt be rushing content, everyome complaining about no content would be the same assholes complaining about bugs if it was rushed.
---
Just when you think you get a bond with him, they fix it.
---
Also a bummer for the firing sound loop from the ws robot. But if they fixed that as good as the last time they fixed it, we'll not have to miss that one as much as the grafton mayor ;)
---
Check the patch notes.  They lowered the weights on a few items.
---
oOoooohhh wow well yes that makes a huge difference. thank you very much!!
---
Outer Worlds plus a ton of other decent games to try, Bethesda truly are idiots
---
That seems likely yeah. I actually might buy it because I’m a sucker for Halloween colors and decorations
---
&gt; The Scrapbox is exclusive to Fallout 1st members and can be used in **both public and private worlds**.
---
Is it back on?
---
I wouldn't mind camp destruction coming back
---
you wear costumes like the ranger one over your actual equipment and it overrides your look.
---
underarmor like the camo one in the shop you wear under your actual armor (leather, raider, metal, etc.) and it doesn't change how you look.
---
100% agree with you, FO76 is a mobile game in console, I gave you over 600 hours but this is it I'm done with you and BGS.
---
13.5 millino players, nothing about eso plus
---
happy cake day!
---
Yeah, someone at Bethesda should really be fired. This is a PR disaster. Say what you will about the service, what it adds or not, but it seems like Bethesda has been taking a course from Blizzard or EA on how to fail completely at PR.
---
But people already have all around builds that kill everything in one shot.
---
What's the point in having so many separate things when one build can be OP. And would they just carry all those weapons on them at once? Or switch all the time? Its still the same inconvenience a player who frees up stash space for a weapon would face.
---
I’m just explaining how it works
---
Ending it with an insult further proves my point...I will never apologize for being well versed and articulate.  Sorry you view intelligence as a threat you feel the need to try and tear down.  Explains a lot.
---
I mean, it would be a skin for the PA and would thus be as bulky as the current sets are. See how the Enclave Hellfire armor was made a PA skin and was still bulky.
---
not necessarily. If the private server you get for subscribing uses it's spare room for extra storage, a server dedicated exclusively to extra storage would more than likely be able to fit many player's storages.
---
Boy, how wrong you are, considering I've been playing since the BETA went live!
---
I don't get out of work for a couple of hours so I can't say yet. I imagine it will be up by the time I get home.
---
I actually have 5 upvotes which is surprising
---
Switch your location and you could be playing tmrw at 9 pm :)
---
*licks Todd's boot*
---
No, but I would Wager their 4th Quarter will look pretty good this year.
---
Thank you very much friend
---
So you're telling me there's a furious explosive handj-I mean- handmade in there?
---
I would. What about the decontamination shower?
---
Oh well
---
Ok, so playing devil’s advocate, and buying into their explanation. Yes, what they said is technically true. 
---
To obtain unlimited storage space, you need a subscription, which entitles you to a private server, with a max 8 person limit. Which will not stress the game engine. Allowing it to efficiently keeps tabs on inventory without crashing. 
---
Soooo maybe ?
---
How do I do that and to what location?
---
The person who has the membership would have to be on all the time in order to take advantage of the private world.
---
All these private servers will do is allow people to reverse engineer it into a moddable environment.
---
The modding community has proved timed and again that they can do anything.
---
And how can you judge someone without knowing their life or job. You are fucking stupid holy fuck go back to your cave
---
I hope they come when they allow us to mod the game.
---
We have to accepted the fact that eso have a dark opening. After two years, on youtube review said it was better so much than game opening.
---
About fo76, the game itself i knew overpriced for the product. Bugs, glitches and lack of contents. 
---
The fact that this is online multiplayer game was announced from the start but seem people just want to turned this game to single support game.
---
The subscription services didn't require to buy (of course buy it help you gain many perks), you still play the game like it should be.
---
About dlc, if the delay make wastelander better then it worth the wait.
---
How am I supposed to know if you had any to begin with, and also thats all I know they reduced, so I was just throwing my 2 cents out there
---
It always felt like one to me. They’re using it to test multiplayer options that they could use on Elder Scrolls 6 without a fan fuss. They’ll also be using that to kill off the franchise and sell it off to someone else. Simple.
---
As fan of fallout 4 and 76  i can't defend this .
---
I will say no  to this because as ps4 player i need ps+ to play which 8 euros a month.
---
Plus your sub of 16 euros  that makes 24 euros a month that is almost two months of WoW subs..
---
Just no  fuck no
---
A former fan
---
Don't take it personally, as it can happen to higher levels as well. I'm level 110, with good weapons and perks, but as a sneaky sniper, I will occasionally get no rewards if she goes down too fast. Sometimes the most powerful bloodied players will take her down before I can get enough shots in. That's just fine with me, especially since it's never been a nuke I launched.
---
rip game economy
---
I recall the TF2 at Valve...full price at launch...later test bed of the f2p model at valve...
---
This FO76 will be the test bed for Failfield...
---
Exact same experience, I'm thankful to see less division this time around.
---
I could understand like $5/mo but that price is ridiculous.
---
dude lmao its just 13 bucks a month you guys don't have any money lmao
---
;)
---
The way I see it, we have x3 routes to take for money to continue to allow the servers to stay open as well as fund their staff:
---
- Option A, we all proceed to buy all the cosmetics (that means buying additional atoms, not using the ones we earned for free from challenges), emotes and CAMP skins available and show them that's all we want available in the Atom store.
---
- Option B, we release a subscription service that either allows players to gain a benefit over base game systems OR grants access to locked content such as private servers and systems such as the scrapbox, that is already slightly game breaking in my opinion and will affect the in-game market for junk. (I think people can handle some minor pay-to-progress, over content they've been wanting since launch getting locked behind $100-a-year-sub).
---
- Option C, they instead release Legendary Weapon and Armor lootboxes, that provide a random 3-star legendary as well as x10 scrip per box, with the rare low chance at obtaining a 4-star legendary. (This is the actual P2W crap we don't want festering it's way into the store)
---
It costs money to keep an MMO running, so just wondering which route would you say is the best for us to take?
---
also not really how it works. but we can definitely agree it shouldn't be as big of a problem as it apparently is.
---
I own Fallout 76, was going to get people to buy it and play it with me. Guess what, not gonna happen. If this doesn't kill the game, then clearly there are people who have no respect for themselves. Guess who's going to give a 1 star review on amazon today.
---
I feel like those are the same people
---
"Add all DLC to Cart" costs $94.96 .... it only adds DLC to your cart. DLC doesn't include the base game... you have to add the base game to your cart for $49.99, otherwise you can't use any DLC.
---
I'd rather people think I was being purposefully idiotic then unintentionally idiotic.
---
...yeah, but people are still going to play this game. So the outrage means nothing. The game will continue limping forward because that's all Bethesda ever needed it to do.
---
I'll be completely frank here, and I mean not to offend anybody. The idiots are not Bethesda, but the players who allow them to do this and keep playing the game.
---
New content?  Wastelanders is delayed until sometime next year.  The Vault Raids are still barely functional last I actually got one to load.  And the game itself still has some MAJOR bugs that have been around almost since launch, besides.
---
They screwed up with the Atom Shop.  It would be making far more profit if they dropped the prices, because more people would be buying.  Instead, they get a handful of large sales that don't even come close to what millions of micro-transactions would add up to.
---
They're screwing up with this subscription plan, too.  If it were JUST paying for private servers... I'd be fine with it, actually.  But no... we're going to throw in a bunch of stuff that's going to upset the game balance along with it.  Unlimited stash, forward camps, Atoms to buy the PTW items in the shop...
---
Just... no.
---
It's pay to win when a paying player can repair weapons more often than a non player can. You're part of the problem by arguing that it's not pay to win. Go be a whale and spend all you want. I'm done with FO76
---
This is what happens scummy investment firms get into gaming. They don't care about customer happiness, they don't care about delivering a quality, they don't care about building company reputation. All they care about is return on investment. X amount of money goes in, Y amount of money comes out, and all they care about is that y is bigger than x. Which means cutting corners everywhere and making the cheapest garbage possible, while implementing the most insane and consumer-hating pricing models like the 18 dollar power armor paints and this subscription.
---
Also teddy bears!
---
i think with this you can play single player so modders could test there mods in a one player server
---
If they're not then they need to look at why surely?
---
They frequently offer random crap no one asks for, their price structure is mental and they've burned so much goodwill that people are less inclined to purchase atoms.
---
Maybe if the shop isn't working they should adjust it until it does instead of adding new ways to drain thier core players of money.
---
yesss
---
Can you move characters between private and normal servers? That is very uncommon for a number of reasons I'm sure BGS doesn't care about.
---
The original thicc black Xbox, I’m guessing.
---
This only raises the question of why this wasn't a feature released in the game through the Atom Shop or god forbid a side quest.
---
Stop crying and learn how to play the game. Plain and Simple.
---
The junk item?
---
Just playing until Cyberpunk 2077. Might have to quit early. 🤷🏼‍♀️
---
Thank you for letting me know
---
Yep you can count me and and you plebs that can’t afford it can thank me and others for when the game gets better for you because we paying the sub.
---
It’s like taxes in real life.
---
Everytime I buy an 8ball from my dealer he gives me a free line! I save so much money now!
---
I’m gonna buy it, I really want some of the things. $120 a year isn’t bad, considering you make that in a couple days if you work
---
You just play the game and gather the materials to make flux. That's all.
---
Honest questions/food for thought:
---
What happens if they didn’t? The collection units max out in under an hour of you being gone? You lose the workshop when you don’t defend it?
---
If you load into your private server, you literally have the ENTIRE map to loot by yourself.
---
Are you talking about Skyrim Together? Is that locally hosted?
---
I like how they promised dedicated servers, which EVERYONE KNOWS means a server you can run on your own hardware, and always has meant that, but now they have private instances instead and its gonna cost a hundred bucks a year or 13 bucks a month? Fuck that.  No buy.
---
o
---
Hide it on top of the refrigerator.
---
what armor??
---
There's a lot of outrage going around for sure. I can sympathize with a lot of it-- it does strike me as another 'wtf' moment for Bethesda to release this now, in this state. But I don't think it's as bad as some are making it out to be. And in the long run I think the sub could be worth the asking price.
---
Personally, difficulty control and increased camp budget/building flexibility were the two things I most wanted and expected from this update. The difficulty part is more complex so I thought maybe they'd tease it out with just a simple setting or two for now, but I really, REALLY expected the private servers to have more camp budget. I don't see why it shouldn't be 100% up to the player, because if it causes instability then that's our choice.
---
TBH, the only explanation that comes to mind is that they want to further monetize the camp budget increase somehow. It's a bit cynical, but they've brought this attitude on themselves IMO. xD
---
Anyway I agree with your last statement; it's just a curiosity to me for now. I won't be so ideological as to claim that I would never sub to this game, and I'm actually going to try to write another post with some more specific band-aid suggestions.
---
Ending with an insult?  Are you a child or simply touched?  You are a "content creator"  and apparently wish to voice your opinions....therefore soapbox, look it up, so I imagine you enjoy it?  So ya.  So to end it on an insult?  Perhaps you are a pompous ass or an attention seeking child?  I dunno.  But do enjoy yourself hmm?
---
How about no premium service at all
---
They also added a ton of rewards in game... for free
---
You seem to not know what kinda servers they use or how they are sharded. Nobody is getting real "server" they are getting a private shard shared with other servers.
---
No 1,650 is for one month sub. Not a year.
---
FFXIV 1.0 was in a better state than FO76 is...
---
thats what i have too do already,i mod on xbox my next mod for skyrim will have around 500/600 armor pieces helmets,cuirass,dress etc (i havent counted them all yet) so i do that alot already
---
Before you even knew I existed. OK buddy, you're delusional.
---
And one of those what? People who have a grip on reality? 
---
I bet you're one of those types that pretend a game is a game to you when you don't get why others complain, but cry the loudest when it doesn't go your way.
---
I’d like this but for survival
---
You sir, are the angel of outrage.
---
True. I no longer trust or respect Bethesda.
---
Downvotes speak for themselves. Get good kiddo 🤗🤗😉
---
A lot of people have waited ages for the Halloween update for 80% to be locked behind a bundle. Beth know what they’re doing.
---
If it were 5$ I'd pay it but theres too much not yet included, like mods. Also is the scrap box only available on the private server or will it bleed into the public. My days of not taking their decisions are seriously coming to a middle.
---
Sorry for the shitty post, i skimmed patch notes and am paying the price of shame for my ignorance
---
Took ARK about 3 months from release date. What's your point?
---
Certainly hasn't been a product delivered as promised. Look at the work put into No Man's Sky since their abysmal launch - it's like they went in completely opposite directions.
---
False
---
Right, because they don't have something called Atom Shop in which people buy items for real money or anything.
---
"All content post-launch will be free" - Pete Hyenas.
---
ESO has always had actual content though, also crowns could be used to pay for DLC and you got 1500 crowns per month (I think I haven't played ESO in over a year) DLCs came out every 3 months so you had enough crowns to buy the DLC for your subscription, which of course is great if you don't intent to keep your subscription so you can play them without it.
---
Though the thing that annoyed me is when they brought out chapters, that you couldn't use crowns to pay for, effectively making crowns useless for the majority of people, and it became as you said, double bank space and a craft bag.
---
Exactly m plenty of money to pay staff and post huge profits. This is greed at your expense and you're apologising on their behalf.
---
Saving money isn't exactly a punishment.
---
So this is just like ESO plus... Well as long as they don't lower the stash limit to under 100 like ESO does it's kinda whatever don't really need any of that stuff unless you want to be a professional vendor I guess
---
people can spend their money however they like
---
Slight correction to your mispelling: "Bethesda screwed the pooch and released this game as a broken massive POS marketing test to see what they could get away with".
---
If they wanted a sub model, free-to-play would've been the option to use. Also making the game a good MMO would've been smart too.
---
But hey it's working well. Why pay for a good MMO like ESO or WoW when you can pay money for the arguably awful FO76!
---
True, i just wish they held off on this update till we had more content, fallout 76 will likely recover but it just feels like with the timing, people didn't think this through, Releasing a subscription right after delaying the next DLC
---
I think we should do the opposite. Everyone should start playing the game so Bethesda has to pay for extra servers. BUT, no one is allowed to spend ANY money in the atom shop.
---
I was just looking to see how the community that plays it views it.
---
No hate, i'm honestly curious after reading the rest of the forum - why did you invest in a private server? Where are you in life and the game world?
---
That’s def a good point. But also isnt FFXIV like $15 a month for the base game?
---
Only $100 for a year
---
Sounds like a single player fallout game but with less assets, no npcs (so not even 2 yes and 2 no answers like in FO4) no mods, more expensive with extra steps. where do i sign?
---
Bethesda is a a scammer company.
---
But ey, i refunded the game and got my 60 bux back, long time ago after the release. But those dummies forgot to take out my game license, I can still play it in the bethesda launcher just like anyone else who has not refunded it.
---
Halloween CAMP rewards?
---
I could play this entire game (including pvp) with 2 weapons and 1.5 set of armor. I even carry 2 PA sets around with me. Idk how holding more, inferior weapons and armor sets in my stash helps me “win” easier. Unless you count more stash space for legendaries to sell in vending machine paying to win. But honestly, caps are mostly meaningless to high lvl players so who cares? I see nothing in Fallout 1st beyond QoL (unlimted scrap, second free FT, peace and quiet) and cosmetics (Atoms and ranger oufit). Get back to me when you learn what P2W means.
---
Why? The more popular the posts about leaving the game are, the higher the chance that others will follow. If enough people quit, Bethesda might recognise that keeping the game alive costs too much money and they will pull the plug, causing another PR outrage. This is what some of us are hoping for.
---
At this point I want them to fail, ideally to go bankrupt as soon as possible - so that a better studio can  buy the Fallout IP and treat it with respect that it deserves.
---
Don't worry, you don't have to pay a dime and can stay on the public server duping and exploiting to your heart's content.
---
You can also loot all items &amp; legendaries without server hoping &amp; probably run vault raids without lag. No longer can you just work harder to keep up with the advantages 😌
---
the atom shop on xbox still has visual problems, they cant even get that shit right and they want me to pay $18(cad) a month. im good with paying premium subscriptions when they are actually premium.
---
I wont and wasn't planning to, but good job on solving a problem that never existed. You "Don't like it don't buy it" crowd are really allowing developers to make shitty decisions like this. I bought this game on launch, I played it and enjoyed it and have been waiting for more content. The subscription model makes me not want to play a game which had potential but has been terribly managed. That's the real problem.
---
Solve that? I know, "stop playing". Guess I have stop playing a game I enjoy because of terrible management. Am I not entitled to criticize the company for that?
---
Coming from someone with hundreds of hours in this game, and faction role playing....do what us smart folks did....walk away from this game for now. Nothings changed to keep anyone here longterm, which is ultimately the problem, and even with all this "content"....mooosst people still do the same shit...walk around for hours killing the same shit doing nothing, all to earn a level that doesnt really matter. Ya end up looking cool to newbies and kids on the map as a high level, buuut thats about it. Luckily I realized this about 2 months or so ago and walked myself....and anything changing here aside from what I said...is far...far away. I personally have just about zero desire to even start this game up anymore.
---
Eh, you're not goin anywhere. You've put up with everything to this point - from the horrible launch state, the 2 steps back, 1 step forward patches, to scandal after scandal, to pay-to-win slowly bleeding in: you'll put up with this too. Have your little whinge, collect some upvotes, then shut up and crack open your wallet - Bethesda's hungry.
---
IF you're wasting 200lbs (much less 600) on scrap you're already doing something seriously wrong.
---
If that's not a last ditch effort to milk what's left of their few loyal players, I don't know what is.
---
I’m taking about building lasting structures, I know I’m in the minority but a huge draw of fallout 4 for me was settlement building, I enjoyed building fortresses and towns and trading posts and raider arenas and a private world would allow you to do that and keep your progress otherwise it’s all for nothing. I couldn’t care less about the collectors, I want to build lasting structures
---
This is amazingly tone-deaf. They needed goodwill and some easy wins. Fix some nasty bugs. Add some frequently requested items like power armour displays. They need to give something to the community. They need to win back some badly damaged trust on a game that has long become a punchline. 
---
This ain’t it, chief.
---
it can be set up in multiple ways. which is exactly what Fo76 should've been from the start.
---
"for free"
---
For lead pop on the excavator pa and head to luck hole mine. (You’ll have more then you could ever want... No joke)
---
Farm acid from the cave crickets at tanagra town (around 50 per server hop)
---
Nope, 15 bucks every month
---
Just saw your other comments. You got some real problems, buddy.
---
You'd be surprise how much people are willing to shell out for houses and cosmetic items in ESO.
---
Oh ok, I was talking about if they had open persistent servers from the very beginning for the entire player base and designed the game around that. Not just strictly private servers from the get go.
---
In the past 3 days I have posted over 150 times to 12 different subreddits. ONE of those 150 was in T_D in a thread talking about James Clyburn. That means you scrolled down ELEVEN PAGES of my post history to find something to dig for. This is what is wrong with "Cancel Culture." Stop being part of the problem.
---
There are a million places on Reddit where you can debate politics.
---
Choosing to do it here is kind of stupid.
---
I didn't think they'd be free. I'm actually OK with them being subscription based. Just....a hundred dollars? For THIS game?? That's ludicrous.
---
^ found the one who doesn't understand principles. Didn't your parents teach you self-respect.
---
Way to understand the point. So what about the rest of what i said?
---
Have you purchased your monthly Fallout 1st Membership? That will solve the issue.
---
and people can report predatory practices like this however they like
---
Ok, don't buy anything like 90% of the people playing. That's sticking it to the man.
---
Wait you buy Xbox gold just for this game?
---
Oh, no problem
---
I had no idea this was coming to Game Pass, and on release day to boot! I swear I almost pulled the trigger on this game last night but decided I was going to get it digitally vs a physical copy. 
---
Thank you, you saved me $60!
---
Well it didn't appear in there before hand my mistake on the wording
---
I doubt raids will run smooth
---
This is reddit people get downvoted for asking questions
---
Wait, there is no invite only option?
---
I think a contingent of the player base has a wildly inflated sense of self worth and a decidedly worrisome grasp on the most basic business principles.
---
Some are also incapable of formulating an argument that would pass through one round of a junior level debate.
---
if this shit was only exclusive of private worlds, i will be ok
---
but this can be used on a normal play, and it's too good of a life change, i would pay for this, but not every month, just a one time.
---
at this point, just go free to play and gift 3-6months to all the og players
---
It’s funny how everyone is saying dupers are going to benefit. Last I checked, you can’t craft/dupe a legendary no matter how much junk you have stored.
---
Those don't really seem like worthy benefits. How much power does your computer use? I used to leave mine on 24/7 and it added maybe $3 to my monthly bill. (Side note: Actually, I can track my power usage in realtime so I'll leave it off for an hour then turn it on for an hour and then just add it up.) It seems like a waste. Is a "controlled environment" necessary? Is your house not controlled enough? The only reason that I can think of is if your computer can't handle it. It just seems odd to pay for a service that you can *very* easily setup yourself at home. The game gives you all of the tools to do it.
---
You are literally struggling to be coherent.
---
You have the PC version right there... so having to do that is your choice, not a mandated one.
---
He was banned from Reddit? You sure about that..?
---
How exactly do you earn points?
---
Subscriptions are the future i will be getting this as well i dont understand why people are so mad we knew private servers were gunna cost money at least now they give some other incentives besides just a private server for 13$ or 8-9$  a month for the year i will say atom shop prices need to go down though cause if ur telling me a fridge is 7$ and a private world+extra junk space in stash+ mobile camp away from camp+ 1600 atoms a month for just a few dollars more... yeah im all good with it as long as atom shop prices come down cause comparing the current costs to what we get with the subscription are waaaay fucked
---
They ran smooth in survival before it was killed off.. coincidence?
---
Lol, you sure cry a lot about others' opinions on something you think is 'just a game'
---
Think they said it was added to your favourites wheel. Whether that means you loose one slot or have more spokes in your wheel I’ve no idea...
---
Yeah, was really easy. There were about 1000 different ways to go up 10 levels an hour. I haven't levelled up once in 4 hours, so another fix it seems.
---
Best reply I have seen all day
---
Don’t recall that one. Just looked up the image and honestly don’t remember it. I suppose there may be one or two floating about, but it’s still not nearly as known as what they chose.
---
elsewhere there's a post with a datamine.  IIRC Pumpkin stand/bench/rack is on the list
---
You can still play on the regular servers for free. I assume you are talking about Destiny 2 yes it is f2p up to the latest expac that still needs to be bought
---
Finally some good news
---
Oh, cool.  Their site made it sound like workshop persistence was *coming*, but not available yet.
---
It isn't even that, it's convenience (and I'm still against it).
---
Pay to progress and pay to skip are both P2W versions.  If you could buy a boost to 'skip' leveling from 1 to 50, you'd certainly call that pay to win.  This is neither of those, and not really pay to win in any reasonable way.
---
The fact that they're locking highly requested and (mostly) expected things behind a paywall is stupid.  I'm not ever going to be OK with that.  Hell I've skipped entire games because that's how they structures things.  I'd have skipped 76 if I knew that's where it was going.  But this still doesn't really approach P2W levels.
---
(I'm not talking about the private games feature, no real opinion on that.  I don't think that's worth the money, but I have nothing against it, other than it doesn't go far enough.)
---
I was trading in some games to get a controller,  a guy walked in with 2 copies of it, poor guy didnt get any money. So he asked me if i wanted them lol
---
Also the cashier guy pulled out a small box with a whole ton of copies of 76
---
"Presses send over and over until the 10 minutes is up"
---
The difference is, ESO has actual content in it and DLC that the plus sub pays for.
---
ESO, as an MMO would in no way get away with the extreme lack of quality and content 76 has.
---
40 on x 17 on s and original
---
Thank you! Just checked, yes. Go to your favorites wheel and click "Y" (atleast on xbox) to deploy. Thank you, I never wouldve found it! 
---
And no, you don't lose a slot. Just tells you to press a button :)
---
Bethesda don't even have to work, they just let the whales write the scams an ship em out. Bugs included!
---
My boot, your ass, you set up the time :)
---
Tricentennial time
---
ty
---
I'm just sitting here laughing. You guys stayed with all of Bethesda's shitty decisions over the past year, and now you're all surprised Bethesda is continuing to make bad decisions?
---
How long did you leave it before logging back in?
---
The quality difference between the two games DLC is so incredibly big though. ESO adds hours of single player story, dungeons, and pvp modes. 76 has had... a pvp mode and crafting additions/vendors?
---
Obviously you are entitled to your viewpoint and in one way I agree with you. I differ because I have not taken a workshop once since they closed the survivor realm. Why? I like my head on my shoulders and I have seen too many server jumping dic ....I mean .... PLAYERS who like to get XP and a bit of junk by killing anyone with a workshop then moving on to the next server.
---
I would pay more than $100 per year to get rid of all the griefers .... and double that again to feed them into ...no ... shut up and be nice!
---
I like open worlds and don't like space so idrk about the outerworlds
---
Im willing to buy that for 3 months when wastelanders gets released
---
I can understand that but at the same time imagine being promised a raise and actually having your wage lowered. I guess we can chalk this up that no ones ever going to be happy about Bethesda and 76 in a topic.
---
Pete "Cosmetic" Hines
---
I'm very excited about the idea of private servers. 2$ a month for unlimited storage is an absolute bonus for me as well as being able to do all the events/workshops without having to worry about other players thank god.
---
True
---
Dont buy it
---
So you are saying that private servers and the main servers are accessible with the same characters?
---
Idrk. Idc about space and I like my RPGs open world.
---
Scorched Sierra was from the Lonesome road DLC when you chose to nuke the NCR/Both.
---
Bulk scrap cannot be stored in the new scrapbox
---
Sorry! 
---
The Ranger Armor Outfit! 
---
My bad!
---
I doubt Wastelanders even exists, at this point.
---
get over yourself. Cancel Culture is stupid.
---
Oh I have stopped playing the game months ago, it's literally not worth my time. I'm just here for the drama, it's fun eating popcorn and watching Bethesda obliterate their reputation like a bunch of complete nimrods.
---
I was only going to store non bulk in it anyway, but thanks for the warning.
---
How were you not out before this? Seriously though, those of you who stayed until now, you're why this announcement was even made. Why wouldn't they think they could sneak into wallet and take more money at this point?
---
Yes it's just a general change
---
That's a distinct possibility, but there was no one else on my world, so I don't know if the timer even kicked in or how long it lasts.  I'll check again tomorrow and see what's up...
---
Yelp because bitching every time Bethesda lets out a fart is really making new players wanna join
---
Commie man bad
---
This is what the "Community" asked for. Lmao...
---
&gt;Didn't pay for the game 
---
&gt;Wants free stuff
---
Entitlement much?
---
&gt;Pay to progress and pay to skip are both P2W versions.
---
They aren't.
---
&gt; If you could buy a boost to 'skip' leveling from 1 to 50, you'd certainly call that pay to win. 
---
I wouldn't.
---
I’m on pc and it’s been up for half an hour. Public servers aren’t much better than before, private’s are buttery smooth.
---
Try restarting your launcher.
---
If 12 dollars puts you over the limit I'd say maybe pull back from gaming until your situation is right lol. People buy 300 dollar systems 60 dollar games 50 a month internet then screaming at 12 dollars is ridiculous.
---
We all Literally payed for the game, now a subscription just to get the private worlds.  
---
Man this sucks, Bethesda you have lost everyone's trust
---
Ha ha ha ha FICKLE
---
So no unlimited junk, like things we could display, only component scrap.
---
So you don’t think having extra stash space, resources, and bartering ability is an advantage?
---
That's wild
---
&gt;Cancel Culture...
---
No idea what you're talking about.
---
You gotta buy the fallout 1st to be able to build it
---
I preordered literally a week after E3
---
Also ESO Plus does provide more.
---
And the tent....
---
the moment they allow this game to be modded and played offline/locally it dies. why buy their stuff when you can just download it for free? why play online when you can have a much better experience offline? you can even invite friends for a lan party.
---
&gt;Same base engine... not a modified executable. Way more than that.
---
...so you're saying it's even easier? because there's nothing stopping Fo76, from a technical standpoint, from being played locally.
---
I've been playing Fallout since 1998, I don't see myself getting tired of this game anytime soon, &amp; it's only $100
---
I don't think the benefits of the subscription are enough to impact you experience in a negative way. I am going to subscribe but its because I really enjoy playing this game and want to continue supporting it.   
---
At this point there isn't enough included to make your experience inferior. Where this will add some major convenience is for me at end game being able to free stash space for collecting weapons I want or holding onto more ammo and flux.  
---
We will have to see what comes in the future but as it is now I don't think there is a whole lot to be upset about. I've kind of thought a subscription would benefit this game. I hope it keeps the game going longer.
---
You could get game pass and actually play some way better games. OUTER WORLDS THIS FRIDAY BTW
---
there is nothing in the game that justifies any paid membership.
---
*Shill warning*
---
When using it, I carry heavy weapons like a super sledge
---
They don't test their shit.  You surprised?
---
Why? I realize fallout 76 is a dowsing rod that only finds idiots, but good lord. What flavor are the farts you have to be huffing in order to white knight for BGS when they double down on a Pay2Win structure by ignoring the most basic of balancing restrictions between private and public servers?
---
Edit: deleted your comment, eh? It's cool. I get it. I was agreeing with you. Being rhetorical.
---
And...  Grafton's mayor...
---
I will be getting that tombstone for sure
---
The map is so large and the max player count is so small that I question the point of a private server... You're basically always alone with each other anyways.
---
But I’m not going to build up a special set of armour for ghouls whenever I fancy a walk around whitesprings.
---
If Wastelanders actually even exists or is vaporware.
---
Right but after you buy it then what?  I can’t find it?
---
This isnt what i asked, you can do whatever you want honestly, dont be weak and make everyone do choices for you
---
You can host a Minecraft Server for free if you didnt want to pay for it though. Also a very viable option since it requires almost no expensive hardware to do
---
I'm with you dude. I don't know how people can continue to defend this company. With everything that's happened, it's....bonkers.
---
But staying on the fallout reddit seems to worth your time lol. You still love it, admit it. You cant stay away.
---
They also charged $60 for a sandbox game with a promise of free DLCs and have released no major content in 12 months. In perspective, ESO had 3 DLCs released after 12 months, now while they charged for the DLCs, they didn't promise to make them all free unlike FO76.
---
The game cost $60 dollars at launch. $200 for the power helmet edition. I understand you get value from the game, but from comparing this game and other AAA $60 games, you can see where people are coming from.
---
 Sure they constantly update the game, but that's to fix it. Fixing is somthing you do to broken things. When I purchase things at the store they are not broken.
---
Runescape gets a weekly update, additions to a game that's already so very enjoyable. This is not the case here.
---
Just a couple minutes as a test. Someone else pointed out that the server deactivation timer may have been running, but I have no way of testing that at the moment.
---
My stash is half scrap and 1/4 display items. Bethesda has a history of "giving" us what we ask for but milking everything they can or killing our goodwill, sometimes both.
---
Yeah this shit is pathetic.
---
It's amazing how many people don't realize this. Most servers are 100% independent of each other where as FO76 you have an account with all of your associated gear that joins different sessions.
---
Jim's not the best pointman for this.  I think he does good work and he's had many valid points about Fallout 76, but he's also taken cheapshots from time to time without doing much research to back it up, like the time he mocked Bethesda for banning a guy who clearly cheated.  He ignored that he cheated and tried to spin it as him getting banned for playing the game a lot.
---
The subscription is indeed BS, but he's not the best messenger to get Bethesda to actually do the right thing here.
---
But Bethesda is going to make a bunch of money out of it, so it's fine!
---
That's outrageous
---
you're gonna be looking for long
---
Many thanks fellow supporter of a wonderful game!
---
I have not had a problem with Bethesda up until now. I’ve been around since the beta, I powered through the lack of content and game breaking bugs that were eventually fixed, I enjoyed the battle royal mode, and I simply didn’t participate in the micro transactions or the survival mode. I even planned on playing the Wastelanders DLC when it came out. This “Fallout 1st” is what ruins the game for me. It’s a subscription service more expensive than Netflix for shit that should already be in the game. I understand that private servers cost money to run, but it wouldn’t even be a problem if offline mode were an option. Bethesda does not respect their fans, so I won’t continue to spend free time I have on their sub-par game
---
It's pretty sad that you have to think twice nowadays before buying new installments in decades old franchises because it is now the norm to sell you half a game then try to pickpocket you later.
---
This is the only online game I play so it feels like I'm already paying $80 a year to access a game I paid full price for.  An extra $100 a year for a private server seems a bit steep imo
---
Amen
---
Yeah, in one month's time you could probably get a year's worth of junk out of a private server, particularly abusing the workshop mechanic and revisiting the Lucky Hole mine, and lock the junk in the unlimited scrap box, to carry you on the public servers.
---
This isn't Bethesda anymore. Or wait maybe it is *insert horse armor etc*
---
Activision-Blizzthesda
---
You're entitled to fuck all except the base game that was part of your purchase agreement.
---
*lose
---
Calm down, it's his money, not yours. He decides what he does with it
---
&gt; why buy their stuff when you can just download it for free 
---
To pirate or not to pirate... that is the question.
---
&gt; so you're saying it's even easier? because there's nothing stopping Fo76, from a technical standpoint, from being played locally 
---
There is a barrier. Right now certain data calls are being incoming and outgoing to the server. Those need to be rerouted. I'm not giving Bethesda too much credit but it may be even harder than Skyrim, depending on what is actually going on server side. Or it could be easier... not going to give Bethesda more credit than deserved... probably easier lol.
---
Atoms are separate so I assume that this will be as well.
---
If you only need a handful of whales to support yourself, who spend thousands of dollars, when a few thousand players wouldn't spend a single penny... maybe?
---
yessir that’s the deal i took , got 3 years worth of ultimate
---
Did it grant the 1650 atom right away, or do you have to wait for it?
---
Oh you are right, it will help keep the game going. It's not like we've paid 60$ already, plus the absurd amount of money people waste in the AS.
---
Why does everyone keep niggling over this...
---
Heh, well I'm given to understand that there were a few more distracting headlines in this one!
---
Came here to say that Game Pass is a subscription service. Just realized they added subscriptions to 76...wow.
---
Hahahahaha 'server' 🤣🤣🤣🤣 fallout 76! 🤣🤣🤣🤣 fucking 100$ ahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha
---
No the only bugs i complain about are horribly inexcusable ones
---
There is a non zero chance TES6 will be built using FO76's engine, and will include all the same online features.
---
Man, game couldve been amazing. I only play to redo my house
---
Apples and oranges, you're clearly and oddly enough admittedly trying to compare a service that offered free dlc to one that charged for it.  And don't try pulling this "no major content" bullshit, they pushed out new content through Wild Appalachia and even if some people don't like it they also pushed out Nuclear Winter.  It's not as if they've been sitting on their hands doing nothing but pushing off Wastelanders.
---
Hmmm... No, fam. That's a paywall that negatively affects game design.
---
If it's not pay-to-win, all of that would be unlocked with a click of a button, not the confirmation of a real-life purchase.
---
What do you spend $10-20 a month on? Cigarettes? Starbucks? Dutch bros? Weed? Booze? Porn? Fast Food? 
---
Me spending $10-20 on my entertainment disgusts you? After I work 60-80/week, and take my daughter to her travel soccer club games/practice, and take my son to his guitar practice.
---
I’m sorry if you literally can’t afford the $10-20. But with a few exceptions, I’d wager most people playing fo76 or on Reddit can probably check how they are budgeting themselves and find $10-20 if they really wanted to.
---
I suspect the approved mods will come from Creation Club and require payment as well.
---
It's not just this. This was the straw that broke the camel's back. Bethesda have either completely lost touch with their fan base, or they're completely tied to whatever Zenimax needs them to do per quarter, but honestly, I am gonna be extremely hesitant at the next game. I'm just gonna watch out when the next one comes. Definitely not pre-ordering again. I have lost a great deal of trust in them that was already thin on the ground.
---
Like I said in the post, I want to be wrong. Really I do.
---
&gt; If they start pulling stuff like this in mainline Fallout
---
*&lt;points at FO4 DLCs&gt;*
---
Poor little studio known as Bethesda, released a barely functioning game that went on sale for half price TWO WEEKS AFTER LAUNCH and spent all their time MAKING MICROTRANSACTIONS instead of fixing the game to actually be worth the price. We should all feel bad for the studio that RERELEASED SKYRIM ON THE SWITCH WITH BUGS FROM 2011.
---
But on a serious note: Live service games also need a thing called "Quality" to be able to make money. But that's something Bethesda just doesn't get. The game released in such a bare bones state and has received little to no love to actually flesh it out. So people aren't willing to spend money to support the game because there's nothing there.
---
Conspiracy confirmed, Bethesda is taking 13% first month profits of the outer worlds and sending all of us to them.
---
No I'm simply pointing out you can't just walk into an office and start re-assigning jobs people aren't trained for.
---
No monthly subscription required!*
---
*you have to open a loot box to get my stuff
---
Can someone tell/show me what's in the Atom Shop? Otherwise I'd have to wait another 18 hours
---
While I do believe that most people will just keep going like nothing ever happened, I seriously doubt we have numbers in the millions
---
All I can say to this is...damn. I'm a dev of a few small indie games and I couldn't ever dream of pulling something like this. This is just nuts. Feels prrrrrrretty prettyyy pretty anti-consumer to me....I can barely bring myself to release ONE paid DLC or micro-transaction. Ugh.
---
This is the internet not how that works bud
---
Nuclear kisses you back😘
---
STOP. PLAYING. THIS. If it's that big of an issue for you to get this worked up about it then just stop. You are under no obligation to play. They are trying to find a balance that fits their player base. If they make a change, and they loose a lot of user base, they'll change. That's pretty much the only thing that will make them change.
---
I've got no problem with it. I probably won't buy it, but it ain't hurting my experience.
---
I've literally just sacrificed $12 to try and was able to loot clipboards, hop and loot them again... This is exactly what they're doing... Not even a private server at all, such dishonesty.
---
Damn, if anyone was wondering what the final nail in the coffin would look like. This is probably it.
---
Honk, honk, Bozo.
---
That membership in ESO is shit too
---
Ik
---
Seems like you might be right....second crash in under 30 mins lol
---
No, it's more like ordering a $60 burger, but the burger came out undercooked, so I had to wait until it was made suitable to enjoy. Then I was told I can buy a monthly subscription for fries at the rate of 20% of the price of the burger. 
---
Makes no sense.
---
I'm with you OP... while I understand money is what makes this world go round, I thoroughly do **not** understand how unlimited storage *is* **not** a benefit. My stash would have *maybe* 100 lbs in it... maybe.... freeing up 700 lbs for fun guns and such. I'm so very disappointed in this decision; if that's not an advantage, I don't know what is.
---
Lol sorry I met a source for the 3 cents for a 1000 servers
---
I'll never buy another bethesda game again, no matter how much I love fallout, elder Scrolls, etc games. What they lose from me they'll probably recoup from catching whales but at least I can just not be involved in any of it
---
A private server is not free stuff. And taking community made mods and saying oh TheY hAve ThE BeThEsda SeAl oF aPproval isnt worth 100 dollers a year. And you and i both know that Bethesda on top of adding this bs will be more than happy to make you pay for mods they didnt even make.
---
No because it's not actually a server; it's an ephemeral instance that will get removed from memory as soon as the last ~~cash cow~~ premium player leaves. Crashing while holding workshops will still cause you to lose all your workshops, etc.
---
Ha ha ha FICKLE
---
Fucking drama queens, the lot of you
---
Actually a cool idea.
---
Yea mine is near its limit too. If everyone goes on their own server with just their friends, what will be left in public servers. I disagree with the cost of $100 dollars a year. Especially for only a few benefits. And why not give those benefits to the whole community! I need a slightly bigger base. I dont need unlimited stash but another increase would be nice. We'll see what the future holds i guess.
---
Fun fact weapons are so heavy that you can't store so many more of them if you remove junk from your stash.
---
People actually wear Weapon Weight Reduction armour pieces so they put weapons on themselves instead of stash.
---
Dude you need to play this game more you sound like a noob who doesn't know how the game works.
---
I've just done it, and it's exactly how it is implemented.
---
Tombstone actually sounds pretty cool!
---
There's so much outrage over this, but it's all for naught. There's only one thing that matters. It's your wallet-vote, and let me tell you, we're all losing that battle.
---
Amidst the outrage and reddit frenzy, people are still playing this game. People are still buying from the atom shop. People will buy this subscription, even just to get a piece of armor. You will all still preorder Elder Scrolls 6 "super mega luxury" edition for $120.00.
---
If you really want to make a difference, stop playing. Stop blindly buying from Bethesda. Otherwise you are indeed part of the problem. Anyone who continues to play this game or purchase this subscription in any form, or preorder any future Bethesda games before seeing reviews... You are telling Bethesda this is okay. That's why they've already pushed as far as they have, and will continue to do so.
---
This will fall on deaf ears because people cannot help themselves from buying useless digital goods. FOMO (Fear Of Missing Out"), and Sunk Cost Fallacy are strong in the gaming world. There will always be someone with a credit card who will buy this shit, so expect to see a lot more of it. FO76 has been a huge marketing test, and the answer has been resounding, because you are all still playing and paying this game.
---
Screenshot that twitter post before he deletes it.
---
I haven't logged in a month. What am I missing? What's going on?
---
Games as a service.
---
In July they had:
---
* a 12 month xbox gold for 21,500 rewards points.
---
* A $1 special for 1 month for Game Pass ultimate that converted all of your regular game pass or xbox live to ultimate, month for month
---
* And a $1.25 xbox gift card for 1,600 points.
---
So those stupid points I collected to keep my gold pass going got me 3 years of GamePass ultimate for free. Thanks Microsoft!
---
as if the whales on whom Bethesda depends on would have a will or even interest to do this ,sadly :/
---
That's why some companies depend on those, it's calculable cash no matter what
---
Happened to me twice. 2 server disconnects in less than 10 minutes.
---
&gt;No I'm simply pointing out you can't just walk into an office and start re-assigning jobs people aren't trained for.
---
Probably wouldn't have to retrain so much if you had the programmers programming and the art guys art'ing. I don't think you're very good at this.
---
Yes, but those are mostly all data points that ALL items, including scrap have, so there isn't a reason to include them in this discussion as its shared.
---
Items like guns add additional properties on top of that, far more than scrap adds.
---
Yea, they could have done this for scrap before, but they can make money doing it now.  We already know they're being scumbags about money, this shouldn't be surprising anyone.  I'm just letting people know that the issues with storage space in general does hold some water, it isn't something they just made up.
---
Its also probably a matter of balance.  They don't want people stockpiling thousands and thousands of raw materials.  If its limited in quantity then people have to play more regularly to acquire it as they use it, instead of just living off what they've acquired 1-2 years ago; but they're willing to sacrifice that balance to the few people who will pay a monthly sub fee.
---
How are private servers a fixed version
---
ah, understandable. Minecraft Realms as annoying as it is, is decent I guess. Like you could do much more via your own server or renting one, but for what it is it does its job without fault.
---
It can be either super tanky or squishy. Depending on your build. Put on serendipity, blocker, nerd rage, born survivor, rank one of first aid and field surgeon and the build pretty much runs on auto pilot. Once you start getting mutations the build will get out of control. Speed demon, talons, twisted muscles, scaly skin, grounded and bird bones. I’m sure I’m missing a few but those are pretty mandatory. If you use a combo of unyielding and bolstering armor you can have over 300dr (any more and I don’t see any extra benefit) mostly you get the most out of percentage based damage reduction like blocker.  You could also go for a stealth Assassin and use vats attacks and gun fu for stealth teleport attacks. Just depends on how you build it. Since unarmed only has one damage card you are left with extra cards slots for survivability or stealth or a bit of both depending on how you like it.
---
&gt;To pirate or not to pirate... that is the question.
---
not even that. there's a hellfire option in the nexus. better than the official one.
---
&gt;Right now certain data calls are being incoming and outgoing to the server.
---
like any other online game. doesn't change the fact all it requires is a local server.
---
&gt;I'm not giving Bethesda too much credit but it may be even harder than Skyrim, depending on what is actually going on server side.
---
the only thing going on server-side is what they chose to be. this game is literally a modded Fallout 4 from a technical standpoint.
---
Any fix?
---
Or just bin my lovely base...?
---
My naughty list is; EA, Blizzard, and Bethesda.
---
The worst part was that it was in a decent place for like a month...
---
Ooo am so excited! 
---
And I was worried I wouldn't be able to decorate my camp since right now the only pumpkins are in a bundle.
---
Just like when they finally added most plans to vendor bots, the price of say heavy combat limbs went from 10K plus caps to like 250 caps. With many more Responder Vendor Bot outfits in player vending machines no more 10 to 15K for those either.  I know I'm hunting that bot down on my private session to grab them for cost.
---
Then you deploy it from the favorites wheel. There is a new key option added specifically for it.
---
I'd say you're in the minority then.  I'd *think* you're in a very tiny minority, but that's just a guess.  
---
But it's all relative in the end.  We all have different levels of tolerance.  Yours seems a little higher than mine, and that's fine.
---
Not an argument. Just pointing out the logical fallacy in assuming people will prove to be hypocrites when you the majority of players you encounter will prove to be 1st subscribers. The illogic being that most of the people who will still be playing this game are the ones who haven't already abandoned the game for one reason or another. Making them more likely to find the new subscription model tolerable. 
---
I used mean language, and I'm sorry if that confused you. But I'm not making an argument. Most of the people bagging on this game are already not playing it anymore, or have stopped because of this. Which means the remaining players are by default more likely to choke this shit down, and thus more likely to subscribe.
---
I don't care if you like eating shit or not. But I'll point out that standing in a room full of infamous shit eaters does not prove most people secretly eat shit.
---
This is bad. Very, very bad. I know that there's still a free option. But the general public will have a field day with this news and it will only make the game look worse. 
---
But on the flip side it's been months since I last launched the game. I may just free up some space until the Wastelander update comes out and then just be done with it. Also on the side note. I need to be patient when Fallout games are released. This will be the 4th game that I bought on launch day only to have it drop in price by half a month after it's released.
---
Nobody better buy this bullcrap
---
So, let me see... if beth is changing the game to be pay-to-win you might as well go do the pay-to-win stuff that is already been part of the game since launch?
---
Same, I pre-ordered because I ignorantly trusted Bethesda. Such a mistake. With the price going down so quickly we should have been a refund. I'd say in game credit but considering they tried to give people a handful of atoms in exchange for a bag, I doubt we'd see anything at all.
---
Fancy talk wont change facts. Clearly how it works (:
---
Dude let's stop right here. You and I both know we'd buy a monthly fry subscription. Let's be real.
---
I'm ok with the price for private sessions. What I don't like is including the unlimited junk storage behind that pay wall
---
Outer worlds.
---
Give it time, Bugthesda is just getting started. Soon we will be segregated by those who play in Public servers (Poor), and those who play in Privileged...i mean...Private servers (Rich).
---
No I mean THEY number in the millions.  The numbers here are likely no more than a couple hundred at best.
---
Nah. Go watch some reviews. Wait until they talk about exploration. It's about the only not glowing part of every review I've seen.
---
Definitely still broken. I was wondering why the door wouldn't fit right.. still works but looks a bit silly.
---
Did we even get an update today? This news1 overshadowed it and honestly I won't even log in to see it.
---
Whoa! Incredible use of DOF. Love them.
---
S I C K L E M A N
---
where's the tent? and I'm assuming the box is only valid while you're subscribed?
---
Or maybe it was already broken havent had time to rush to repair i agree its garbage never said it was and thats exactly what happend to me all 3 of em were havin a hayday
---
Huh?
---
"Outraged for no reason"
---
🤔
---
If this isn't a reason to be outraged, then what more does a company like Bethesda have to do? People already had reason enough to be outraged at launch, now there's even more reason.
---
That's with internet. Xbox live is $10
---
A guy on my friends list showed up at my CAMP without me inviting anybody, so can confirm.
---
Ok thanks! That's kind of what I was wondering.. does it start out fun and get less fun over time due to the mechanics of the inventory and stuff like that.  I actually had a pretty good first impression with it but then saw a lot of posts today about the subscription things so I wasn't sure where the game was heading... (I'm afraid of mandatory subscription or something...)
---
Near the same price as eso+. I had that while I played that then canceled it when I stopped playing. Looking back I dont regret it. I’ll just cancel gamepass until I get bored of fo76 since I haven’t been using it. 🤷🏻‍♂️
---
I agree just more players being upset.
---
Paid servers will crash the market in public servers due to the ease of farming in private servers and all items transferring.
---
So yes, it will take away from my experience when I have to grind twice as long for caps due to the changes in the market.
---
So you stole the game but feel entitled enough to still post this?
---
It's on Gamepass right now so you can preload,
---
PLAYABLE Tomorrow at 6 pm PST.
---
I'd made it in shortly after posting that.
---
I agree completely and you are the first person to  actually mentioned this. I am so bummed out by Bethesda. Words can't describe.
---
I've been looking into it but for the life of me I can't crack the Appalachia.btd file. genuinely asking, if you're into software development or knows someone who cares enough, let me know how to unpack it.
---
I don't even care about the legal aspect at this point.
---
It has been quite some time since I've last played. I won't deny that. And there's a good reason for it. It's junk like this and lack of friends that play it because of junk like this.
---
We agree on that, but mats are (at least for the time being*) stored in our stashes, aren't they? Unlimited stash for scrap can make a huge difference even if the limit remains for the rest of the items.
---
This, of course, is my experience, mileage can vary, etc.. but just as an example:
---
-Aid and ammo I keep on me, it's lighter thanks to perks/armor
---
-Between the rest non-junk items I have, distributed among vending machines and stash, around 400 lb (maybe a bit less if I have already done my scrip/caps run).
---
The rest is junk. I usually eat up my mats after Scorched Earth or Encrypted on repairs and bullets, so it's not really an issue for me most of the time, but I can't say it wouldn't make a difference.
---
Lmao it's a 24 player online game, it's a third of the phrase MMO, let alone an MMO.
---
How can someone repair a weapon more often then a non player can?
---
Thats good advice.
---
"Until this bullshit is removed" = indefinitely
---
A lot more plans than I expected, neat. Even if a lot of them are pumpkin styles
---
They wont ban mule accounts. They couldn't really prove they are not valid accounts, and the owners are still valid paying customers. Pretty sure there is some legal issues there.
---
Talking such shit about the people who do enjoy this game, while being a member of the very subreddit of the game you hate on.
---
Perfect. Thanks.
---
At this point I just feel Todd is crashing the game with no survivors.
---
Why are you even on this subreddit if this is your view on the game?
---
Yep. I pay for ESO Plus and feel I truly get my money's worth because it's an amazing MMO. But Fallout 76? Not worth the Sub cost
---
I guess you and I are currently being dumb then, haha ;)
---
In a future patch, but not today's apparently. Bethesda's new slogan should be "pay us now, we'll make it right... eventually. "
---
Didn't see it in Pip Boy. Thanks tho
---
I don’t want your freebies, I want to help out the people who’ll appreciate the stuff. I’m lvl 250+ with all the gear I need. Your threat is about as impotent as you are “son”
---
No. It's not your intellectual property tonuse however you please. 
---
That's not how it works.
---
Babies first communism rage
---
Is he invincible? or have you found a way for him to not drop his junk when he dies?
---
You keep the box and all it’s contents will always be accessible but you won’t be able to store anything additional in it if your subscription ends.
---
&gt;Bethesda devs are lying and greedy snakes
---
yup its totally the low paid devs who probably hate what their creation has become.  has absoulutly nothing to do with executives and publishers choking funding until their demands are met.
---
Lots of noise, little content. Like a child screaming in an empty room. I’ve no interest in 1st, I’ve played since beta. However, unlike many people here I have this really amazing secret plan. Now don’t tell anyone about this. But I’m going to play the game without buying the 1st sub, and continue roaming around and enjoying the game the same way I always have. I know right, madness! Playing a game I enjoy, in a way I enjoy, without feeling the need to buy this completely optional thing that has zero impact on it. And I’m going to do so without trying to sound superior by belittling and being aggressive to random people on the internet who don’t share my viewpoint. Because people can enjoy what they enjoy. Radical thinking right, truly astounding.
---
You can pre order a year of private servers for a boost package for Wastelanders update :^)
---
True but it’s gonna be buggy as fuck either way
---
Investors.
---
And yet ESO is regarded as one of the top MMOs in the world.
---
_you don't ever have to drink that old brew_
---
I'd say the main difference is that ESO subs get you access to every bit of content you'd normally have to buy, while this gets you access to an empty version of the game you already play normally.
---
They both give a general "infinite crafting material storage" perk and a couple small things (ESO doubles your general Bank storage, F76 gives you that fast travel mini-camp). But the sheer difference in actual provided content is staggering.
---
I would rather willingly get addicted to crack than buy that shit
---
Is there a separate icon so that you show as being in private session, similarly to say playing in NW?
---
If you're on Xbox and quitting, I'll take your gear off your hands haha :)
---
Although I'd rather the community stay alive and active!
---
i agree its a good deal, if we look at the private instances as another perk rather than the focus.
---
  the fact that the world folds up when u leave is a huge bummer tho (and not even how bf3's servers worked, they existed w/o the host's presence).
---
so funny yall support this POS game and company. go buy Outer Worlds this Friday.
---
Yeah just learned about the assbrained decision to be able to transfer between public and private servers. There will be no modding for this game. It was questionable when all the servers would be controlled by BGS. This all but kills everything except maybe local ui mods or something, if anybody even cares enough to try and implement them.
---
This is what you all requested. Thanks.
---
Bethesda: "We appreciate our 76 community"
---
Also Bethesda: Pay us 100 dollars a year to split the community.
---
Awfully angry for someone who made their own mistake. I'm pretty happy, I'd say. I saved all my money
---
Did you forget they lied about Fallout 76's development or the pre launch promotions?
---
1 year free? Most you'll get is 200 atoms
---
/s
---
Not part of the 1st scam
---
It has been no content for almost 5 months now, except the shitty raid.
---
Oh it seems I struck a nerve, guess if I go a little further you can untie my boot through your mouth.
---
Fast? They've been cutting corners at the cost of gamers for 10+ years.
---
It's not incorrect though!
---
I would say it is not bad. But not the right moment.
---
You see the game yet lack of content, poorly optimized and then release a pretty subscription services. 
---
Not like eso, they have many years worth of contents. So subscription must worth the price.
---
But i thought you misunderstanding from here. I expressed that players want something like test server or private server on player's resources (to do everything they want) than bethesda's server.
---
The hard fact is the game was announced to be multiplayer-online game from start so what do i know? 
---
¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯
---
I still play the just like before.
---
Oh not me, I stopped playing ages ago. And only came back to see how the shills try to defend this. As soon as I saw Jim Sterling's video I knew there would be some Gold Medal levels of mental gymnastics going on. ;)
---
You dropped this \

I'm sure their EULA has a line somewhere that says they can end your account 'at their own discretion'.
---
"Bethesda, this thing isn't working the way you described. Is this a rare bug, or was that intentional?"
---
Probably one of those astronomically rare bugs. I'm assuming that any "crafting item" that can be scrapped to a base component cannot be stored in the Scrapbox? I'm assuming a Teddy Bear, made of Leather and Cloth, cannot be stored, whereas Leather and Cloth can be stored? If so, then Hardened Mass, Scrap Assaultron Heads, and other items used for crafting would need to be scrapped in order to store.
---
rip
---
Like this guy op was talkin bout. A dude posting pro nazi memes up and down the sub?
---
Let's hope it lasts, we all know bugs come alive from time to time.
---
I think the stashbox and the tent are stupid to be part of the subscription service. 
---
But I don't think the subscription for the private server is stupid, well I hated that there was no offline version of the game and didn't like it when they announced back in 2018 you had to rent the servers from Bethesda. But I was told by people here to get over it.  I'm over it now and I'm completely fine with the subscription cost since I was well aware of it.  
---
But I agree the other stuff is just bonkers stupid.
---
So many people are leaving this game that they had to add a new door.
---
Nope and that's what I'm planning to do, pay for the first month and come back every month to see if the extras are worth it. The Atoms makes it worth it alone, but I want a little extra.
---
Sure but it was never THIS bad
---
5 months isnt that long wtf, development takes time.
---
NOBODY should pay for this trash. It's a fun game but this is a complete slap in the face. I could see it being $4 a month... Maybe. That's even going a bit far with how little content there is in the game and this isn't adding anything new to do.
---
lol is your name Richard Meyer on twitter?
---
ESO is not free to play.
---
As long as it's Play Anywhere. The Outer Worlds should be as long as your playing on the MS store version/GamePass PC.
---
I am thoroughly. Sounds like you arent though. Also, nope, I'm still in a one bedroom lol. I have a mediocre job. I just save money better than you apparently, as I have some to blow.
---
Forewarning I don’t own the game and I’ve been following the subreddit for the past year to see if the game would ever be in a good state to purchase and holy shit this destroyed my hopes and dreams. I haven’t trusted Bethesda since the paid mod debacle on steam workshop 4-5 years back and now I know why. This company has completely taken a turn from being one of the most loved to the most hated because they decided to say fuck the people that purchased our games and have shown us support they’re only wallets to be milked. After this announcement I think I’ll stick to the good Bethesda games and hope they don’t ruin TES-VI
---
Oh yes those atoms.  Because it makes such a difference when I dont give a shit about buying a new skin.
---
Any game that's published by Microsoft (Which now includes Obsidian) is on game pass from release
---
Pal I bought a game that I didn't like. You're behaving like I lost all my life's savings in Todd Howard's ponzi scheme.
---
If i pay for a 1st subscription for my gamertag, can my brother create private world's when he is playing on his gamertag on my console
---
You can still host private servers without Realms though; you're just paying for convenience.
---
Great, now I want a cheese burger.
---
Yes. The content was delayed solely to push out this Private server thing.
---
Makes complete sense. Especially when you go back and read the dozens of "I'd rather wait for content than get buggy shit" posts
---
Fuck Bethesda
---
IKR It's not even the good set like the Riot style which was always far superior looking.
---
I'm with you. Months ago when they nerfed TSE, I had finally gotten my first one. After multiple nuke attempts that crashed out halfway or further into it, I said screw it. I've seen the community is still active, I made a new character to give it a fresh take. Made it to level 32 with almost no hiccups. Well, none that were as bad as back then. But now this, and we all miss out on Wastelanders until next year. What baffles me is the marketing; who in the hell decided this was a good look? On top of the fact that many other much more stable games charge a similar service for less. Really at this point I just imagine the vault boy digging his own grave and saluting with that same, familiar grin, as if to say hey, I know what I'm doing here, and I love every second of it.
---
Damn... I thought this was a joke when I first saw it... holy shit Bethesda...
---
I'll stick to my words,  I bought it in preorder......... and played since beta.....
---
But these fries are so salty.
---
I'm just putting it out there. Not trying to sound like a jackass.
---
"players have been asking us for items with real utility"
---
😂
---
Isn't it a little sad that one person can take all the blame for an entire company just because they show their face?
---
I'm pissed but for the life of me I can never understand the Todd hate. Tim Sweeny got all the blame for all the failures of SOE/Daybreak but even when he left it was more and more of the same shit show. It Todd Howard left Bethesda, it wouldn't be better because of it. It'd likely be the same, or possibly even worse.
---
Hmmm would this be viable for dumping gear to alts then?  I do it now but hold my breath every time!
---
You wildly overestimate the effect a random stranger on the internet has. I was just providing you with an explanation and responding to your outdated “threat”
---
All those people buys Atoms out there and it's not making money? I find it hard to believe.
---
And even if the game is not making any money, if they want money, they need to work for it, fix the game first, try to earn money next.
---
I see where youre going with that but its a little bit of a stretch, is there anyone over level 50 having problems finding enough ammo...? lol
---
I love all the "What about me, I bought the base game"
---
Yes yes you did. You agreed to give someone money and get a product in return. Your agreement was fulfilled. 
---
You are not entitled to fuck all after that.
---
Thanks - yeah I guess my current thinking is either 1) stop playing right now and wait months until W.L.   Or 2) play through fairly quickly now and then put it away for months until W.L. and then see how it is with that ( I figure after a few months I'll have time to forget all the little details of it, so it seems new again - or maybe it WILL be pretty much a new experience )
---
Main thing I'm afraid of with waiting is that the way things seem to change every few weeks that maybe W.L. will either end up never coming, or maybe be a paid release somehow, or some other thing that makes all that waiting totally not worth it (and then I'll just be angry like everyone is now haha!)
---
Ct h
---
TLDR for those to lazy to read? What new content is going to be paid?
---
Just dont buy it lol, capitalism 101
---
What I'm curious about is why now? A subscription model is generally always the best business model from a financial perspective. So why now, and not a year ago?
---
Nice instagram normie emoji
---
100% agreed
---
The only "money" they now get from me is Bing Rewards. Plus those rewards otherwise expire so it might as well go to something. I make enough platinum on warframe, and get enough ancient coins on Sea of Thieves.
---
Are you saying fallout first isn't pay to win?
---
Todd Howard.
---
EULAs are impossible to defend legally.
---
Under 8.50 for 1600 Atoms...
---
The other stuff is gravy
---
Also Subnautica is coming November 7th, which I am hype for as well. Good time to get game pass
---
Favourites wheel, far left, 'survival tent'
---
From what I understand the private servers are going to be P2P and not dedicated, so it's not really costing them much at all
---
Or, and this is crazy, how about actually filling FO76 with content players can enjoy before trying to charge them more?
---
Its good for streamers and youtubers
---
This was a major reason for me getting the game. I haven't even played much since launch in lieu of doing it all with just friends and mods. Now, for the first time, I wish I never bought it.
---
They weigh less now??? Awesome! My comic book store owner really needed that!
---
As someone said above, this has basically become a mobile game.  Log in to do activities, hit the activities cap for the day and log out.  And pay for shortcuts!
---
Was your location taken away a week ago?
---
They just come up with stuff they can put behind a paywall and add it to the game. That's their roadmap.
---
Months ago: Hey Bethesda can we get the ugly brown paper bags changed to something more visible like the vault lunchboxes?
---
Bethesda: We gotchu fam.
---
&gt;Loot Bag Skins: Use these new cosmetic items to replace the appearance of your Paper Bags in Adventure Mode when you drop 
---
items manually or on death.
---
This is like the extra salt thrown on the gaping wounds of the community.
---
If you want unlimited scrap storage, a second mini-CAMP, some exclusive outfit of some sort, and the ability to create your own 8 player world that's invite-only (and a bunch of atoms thrown in on top), then yes you need a subscription.
---
Otherwise, no, nothing has changed.
---
But you can only carry so much ammo surely
---
This is what I agree with and why I posted this
---
from my heart: if anyone just blindly buys that subscription i will have to lose my respect for you automatically. said nicely. Please do not just throw more money at Bethesda, they cannot be gifted even the tiniest income from this shit. If they do even roll 5000 dollars in on this, they call it a success. Please, do not purchase this subscription. It's for the better future of gaming.   
---
Die hard fanboy or not, u have to see this objectively in hindsight of Bethesdas recent FO76 chaos. Please do not give them money.
---
For real?
---
&gt;Or you could get Game Pass on Xbox for about £6 a month and get it (and 100s of other games) free
---
Or buy somebody's 3 month code they got free with their cpu for a fiver ;)
---
Might just be active by default. Check your favorites wheel. (Below it, should be key option)
---
Correct. I wear no armor at all. Some people wear their armor and break it to get the legendary effects. I don't bother with that since I do go into nuke zones and the hazmat takes the armor off. Then you have to repair an rebreak.
---
I haven't played in a while, but Born Survivor and First Aid help a lot with declining health. And yes, it's a full health character. 
---
I'm not saying that berserker isn't somewhat squishy, but you can really play effectively around it. I don't think it would be fun as a main character. But, as an alt to change things up, berserker was lots of fun for me.
---
You access it through the favorites section. On PC click F and there is an option at the bottom of the screen to place it. Similar to how you move your camp in the pipboy.
---
There is no way they went in as a community first approach to this cash grab.
---
seen as the game is a one time purchase, boycott isnt going to work as well it was a sub/ a repeatable charge. The best thing is to cause a fuss, do not buy thing from the atom store and make them listen
---
Maybe try outer worlds , its by the same developers as fallout new vegas(obsidian). I was a huge fallout fan myself but gave up on bethesda since fallout 76.
---
"Recently" All it takes is a rotation to make places respawn.
---
P.S: It is absolutely hysterical that their attempt at a nostalgia farm was the NCR Ranger Armor from New Vegas, a game Bethesda didn't even touch, but was developed by Obsidian. The last time Fallout was actually good. 
---
Friendship ended with Bethesda/Fallout, now Obsidian/Outerworlds is my new best friend.

Shi are in California only
---
I bought this game LAST NIGHT because it was $30 and I wanted to try it. Still havent had a chance to play cuz I went to bed and went to work.
---
At lunch I find this shit out. I'm calling microsoft when I get home to return it.
---
Skins are easy money grabbers I don't really get it why they don't just release more skins and had to put out this embarrassing subscription thing.
---
&gt;I defended this game for a lot of people
---
That was the problem, like you many people did, when it was obvious it would come to this since they added repair kits.
---
So still unlimited material space though right? That would adversely affect at least the Reddit Market of trading as most characters have only a limited space to work from. If it goes this way, the whole market is screwed in a sense.
---
If you’re fine with being screwed over or treated as not valuable that’s fine but the agreement was that things like this wouldn’t happen.
---
5.56 is used as currency in the trading community, you can basically farm/hold more currency than non-premium players. This update is a direct inflation to the economy. You'll find people wanting ridiculous amounts of ammo for items now.
---
Yes we are all are aware of you crybabies standing in circle jerking each other off.
---
So I guess I missed the mad memo. Why are people mad about the private servers?
---
How is that an improvement
---
I love how up in a roar this sub is over this. Oh how naive so many people are here.
---
Anyone who is upset at this, I TOLD YOU SO!
---
If you want to search my comment history and find it, it's there. I said this about a few months in to the first stash expansion.
---
Gotcha. That's a good question, I do not know.
---
And enjoy our Halloween event!....
---
-Oh wait. We're releasing that 2 days before Halloween. But, but, but it lasts until November 4th!
---
Well if there’s only one person and maybe his buddies, they are not gonna have a million pieces of junks anyways. It’s still a challenge, but private serve shrunk it by 20 folds compared to the public servers.
---
There is a workaround, you just need a buddy.
---
Trash Game by trash company. RIP Bethesda
---
Alt+F4
---
It's definitely one I'm interested in, sounds like a smaller world and a bit more of a linear game which I'm kinda of two minds about, but once it's officially out there for a bit I'll probably check it out.
---
Hey why not just keep playing and keep enjoying the game?
---
And it's not even a potato. It's a banana.
---
Preach it brother 🙌. But too many rich snobby kids that don't give a fuck
---
Dude you’re literally commenting on every post if you’re not about the frustration that’s fine but you’re asking all these dumb questions like you can’t get your answers from the posts on hot.
---
I mean its only 13$ month for over 16$ of stuff
---
But if you keep it in junk form and it craft it when you need it then it won't take up any space.
---
It just works.
---
The only thing that really bothers me is the tent camp thing, we asked for that for a long time, and it's behind a pay wall.
---
The unlimited scrap would be cool, but doesn't really mean a lot in the long run (though the fact that it wasn't possible before, but suddenly it is now with a subscription rubs me the wrong way).
---
The rest is fine.
---
It's just scrap, I dont see it as a massive deal but I'm not so big into the economy of 76.
---
And if you want the content that Pete Hines promised would be free forever. Like a second Camp and infinite Junk Stash. Hardly anyone is mad about the Private Servers. Personally I like the new additions. I just despise that they put "free forever" game changing content behind a paywall. Cause you can buy a Fridge or Scrap Bot by grinding Atoms. You can't grind this paywall content. So Hines lied.
---
Well atleast that's been the norm for what 6+ years of bs now? Atleast Bethesda had the chance for some foresight here, but we both know they have low perception.
---
It kind of is pay to win when you can farm everything alone and then go back to public servers and sell.
---
Nukes, legendary spots, workshops, and the free stash space. It absolutely is a paid for concrete advantage over non-paying folks. Which wouldn't even be a problem if private and Adventure were separate environments. Going back and forth between the modes affects negatively everyone because now the already impossible market prices will get even crazier.
---
It also kind of defeats the purpose of a private server. I was hoping for real presonalization of the game world, even if only to allow new Storyteller videos to be made. I was hoping for high level enemies across the map and more spawns. Hell, I was even hoping for the console commands to play around when bored like I do in 3/NV/4. What they give woth the subscription is really meaningless when compared with what they could have made it be.
---
The samurai and gladiator costumes look awesome. Hopefully I can wear the gladiator one without everyone thinking I'm cosplaying as Caesar's Legion...
---
The Chinese Communist stuff looks pretty good, too, especially that power armor and Handmade skin. Surprised there isn't a Chinese stealth suit in this datamine.
---
Which is how Diablo II worked when it came out almost 20 years ago.  They gave players the open servers and characters, which were allowed on local/lan play, but couldn’t transfer over to the regular battle.net servers.
---
Good point so more , you can do the same with public servers
---
........
---
So what, their money their choice, dont become a fascist and limit peoples freedoms
---
Two separate companies. Just under the same publisher.
---
I understand what youre saying, certainly not an easy situation to navigate, but I think I would be a bit more understanding with Bethesda if they told us roughly how much Wastelanders is costing to develop, and of course it better be earth shatteringly good. I just find it difficult to justify asking us to bail them out, when so far they have shown no evidence to suggest that they have learned from their mistakes and wont just do this again with Starfield or TES6 even though those (I dont think) will be multiplayer.
---
This was the easiest way to implement it. To make private servers work the way you'd expect, they'd need to write alternate versions of the network code, and that would have cut into their "building p2w mechanics for the Atom Shop" budget.
---
Nah doesn't work as it is not peer to peer for the servers.
---
This is BS considering that at E3 they basically said that private servers would be free too all players now they are putting promised game play features behind a paywall
---
Then don’t buy them?
---
But but.... this game is trash?
---
I hate you
---
calling people "normie" in 2019 lmaooooo. you're still a clown.

So wait.  The CE comes with a physical map poster and you're mad there's an in game map in the atomic shop?  I thought you were saying the CE gave you a free in game map, but anyone can buy it with atoms.
---
I’m also curious about this
---
Half priced atoms and I won't have to spend half my time managing my inventory, plus I can safely farm workshops and get that sweet sweet armour.
---
If you want Fallout lore, Fallout 76 is a terrible choice.
---
Case in point: adding the NCR Ranger armor into Fallout 76 that not only takes exists on the opposite side of the US, but that wasn't even going to be invented until, at least 150 years after Fallout 76.
---
You're not paying to play a game you already have. You're paying to use BGS intellectual property in a different way that was not part of your original purchase agreement. 
---
This is how many games run their server rental service.....
---
This is honestly great. Watching this game fail over and over again is hilarious.
---
Great rebuttal
---
I'm also heavily in the trading community. Most expensive items want 30k caps + 5.56 because they're so used. Take the red asylum costume for example, I saw it being sold for 30k caps and 20k 5.56 ammo not long ago.
---
They're not silent - they're all over at r/fo76filthycasuals. Whales are already signing up for year-long subscriptions.
---
If you pick up a beer bottle on the private server and you jump back to public, do you still have that beer bottle?
---
Does experience you collect on the private server transfer to public?
---
Man, I'm glad I'm not the only one. How does forward camp placement work?
---
&gt;Because people can enjoy what they enjoy.
---
I already said that I don't care if you like eating shit. I don't really care if those of more discerning palate, such as yourself, prefer the older shit without all the new frills. It doesn't alter the fact that a bunch of people eating shit together are hardly proof that everybody else who doesn't like eating shit are hypocritically also shit eaters.
---
Please. By all means. Continue enjoying the things you enjoy. Enjoy Fallout 76 if that makes you happy. I would appreciate it if you would do me the same kindness.

I enjoy pointing out how shit fallout 76 and it's business model are.

Plenty of other games to play in my library. Goodbye level 170 melee, 154 sniper and level 30 laser dude. You were kind of fun regardless of the constant bugs. There is no way I'm paying for a game in this state or playing a game that now puts me at a disadvantage against other players.
---
*(under breath)* holy shit...
---
the scrapbox
---
the tent
---
the ranger outfit
---
Not really. Trump supporters do it all the time.
---
Exactly. There should be no VIP bonuses that offer ingame advantages because that's literally p2w. Renting your own server is different because that's an actual service that costs money. Exclusive skins are fine, and the fucktons of atoms would be fine too if they didn't break their promise on the cosmetic MTX only. But fuck Bethesda for thinking the tent and the junk space would be ok as exclusive VIP perks.
---
Yes its next to the cave network right above the baileys cabin it's a big metal door with a key pad
---
What a dumb comment.
---
I would like to know this as well
---
Bethesda reminds me of the cable guy from South Park who rubs his nipples when he denies people what they want
---
Me too back i when it was 5 bucks a months i quit when they removed free trade and becuz of that i canceled my sub and bitched for on their forums people just want to be heard that this kinda stuff sucks is it gna work no but its just another part of being involved with games these days
---
 I make my ammo and I always have enough mats. I run a full auto Handmade, among other things. You don't need unlimited ammo, enough is good.
---
Give me one logical fucking reason why it should be expensive to store items on a character. Just one.
---
Remember the good-ole-days when all we had to complain about was the canvas bags?
---
Only now there's no way to tell which of that is for me, and which of it is locked behind a paywall.
---
They've said and gone back on several things now though

Wow. Players who are premium are getting a bad wrap here because we are hardcore players. No one put a gun to your head to buy the PREMIUM package.

I wasn't that upset because you could earn them in game still. Then they just doubled down on it.
---
"We're offering a free dunce cap to compensate our ~~gullible~~ loyal players who actually paid for this garbage." - Bethesda, probably.
---
Sounds like my local checkers.
---
&gt;  complaints are give us something worth 12 bucks a month and we'll pay it
---
thats up to you as a consumer to decide,if you think a product offers you good value for the price they are asking then buy it if htey don't dont buy it
---
&gt;i'm sure when you buy a new car you just walk in and pay whatever they ask for? or do you negotiate?

you know you can't negociate on new cars right?

only used car salesmen let you negociate

I'll join the strike but only from 730-530 m-f

Iv spent money in the atom shop about 30 dollars actually on the bundles at a time were the game was being sold for like 20 so yeah i think i put in enough cash to to complain
---
I interesting, well I'm slowly scraping off all but the cool people I've met who are needy or coming by all the time asking for stuff  begging me to carry them through silos etc
---
Oh ok that sort of sucks
---
Pretty much every community requested feature at this point is getting price tags thrown on them.  It's so frustrating and disappointing to see.  
---
Even the fucking brown paper bags now have "skins" being sold in the cash shop when folks asked if we could simply change them to be vault lunchboxes or something more thematic.  It's such an insult to injury at this point.  They're going to throw price tags on literally everything they can.
---
I wouldn't be surprised if TEXT CHAT finally gets added in but with some stupid cash shop item tied to it.
---
fucking drama queens
---
Sure do and ima have to pull and r/emojipolice on you for that normie emoji
---
5.56 is also used as currency in the trading community.
---
It wasn’t slow or little by little. It was obvious from day 1.
---
All cash shop items are always downloaded to the client, regardless of whether you own them or not. This is necessary so that you can still see those items if other players are using them. But the access control is on the server side, and giving away the server to the public lets everyone do with the content whatever they want. While that is not the only reason, I am fairly confident there is virtually zero chance that Bethesda would let people host their own servers locally, except maybe at the end of life of the game when the official servers are shut down. It was even [confirmed by Pete Hines](https://twitter.com/dcdeacon/status/1034123132284624896) months before launch that private servers will only be hosted by them. Anyway, with all the downvoting and hysteria going on lately, I am out of /r/fo76 and /r/fallout for the foreseeable future.
---
I've seen you on here before. You bring up that guild wars 2 shit every chance you get and I shut you down on it before.
---
What he said is absolutely **not** correct. You making the coffee runs for the code monkeys on guild wars 2 doesn't make you a big shot AAA developer who knows about large scale database storage and normalisation.
---
That's like saying "I was a UI designer for call of duty, so I'm qualified to talk about the back end data storage system"
---
GTFO
---
Didn't that helmet get a recall due to being prone to mold or something?
---
I'm impressed they can even handle/afford adding that kind of content
---
I did it, no regrets.
---
Well at least Bethesda is letting players pay for a feature people have had for a year after exploiting the mortar box. A whole year and there's still players with hundreds of thousands of weight in their boxes of just scrap.
---
I currently have the outfit, and instead of the normal Atom Shop Symbol, it’s followed by a Fallout 1st symbol. I’m not sure what that implies about the usability after your subscription ends, but I guess we’ll see after a month.
---
Others say the PN said you keep it despite your subscription ending (which I guess I missed and still don’t see), but that symbol makes me a bit skeptical.
---

---
Thats what I mean, they suck that they can't figure out bugs; it should be their priority  over trying to ring out more money from something that is essentially dry till new content releases.
---
The people in management who know whales will buy it.
---
Not to perpetuities the Us vs Them mindset, but *most* people were saying that last year. And then they quit the game and spent their time on better things. Most people realized this game was sinking and jumped ship. 
---
So the only people left are the die-hard F76 fans. The people who, for one reason or another, are able to look past the egregious microtransactions. And that naturally creates a bit of an echo chamber. 
---
Make no mistake. This game is a bad joke to most people.
---
the bit i left out is the important part, its not that obvious
---
Best thing they could do rn is lower the price to something better like 8€ a month and 60€ a year
---
let's be real, the $'s not the issue.  its being able to say "im cancelling my subscription" in real dollar terms in real time.  if we get the same kind of "service" we saw at the beginning of this game once subscription dawns, then enjoy the game, but don't subsidize it.  just my two caps -- make 'dem work for 'dem atoms, i mean, sustainable profit business model!
---
I was picked by community of not Fallout players to come here and tell you the truth
---
NO MORE MONEY FROM ME BUGTHESDA !
---
If everyone is in a party I can see it mentions shutdown of the server. To me it sounds like they granting the host a dedicated server on their hardware. When the last subscriber leaves it saves and shuts down the instance. This would be easy to test with a friend that is not subscribed. Capture an area. Leave and then wait for the shutdown and hop back in. Not having to spend the first part of a play session setting up your workshop would save a lot of time. I also assume all members are automatically put into the same party and leaving the party removes you from the server.
---
If their servers are hosted on something like AWS this makes sense and essentially they are passing the server costs onto the subscriber. You sign in join your server and it pulls the save state from their database and spins up an instance just for you.
---
If I had fired up the game in the last 4 months this could be cool, also if I had any friends but that’s a whole other topic. Sadly I have hardware at home and would prefer my own hosted instance or use one of my VPS instances out there. Again if I played enough I would consider canceling one of those to cover the sub cost.
---
Very well written--- I agree with most points, quibble on a few, but overall I think you've hit the nail squarely on the head.  I wish instead Beth had simply said "We were wrong, and we aren't making enough $.  We're moving to an ESO+ system, effective Jan. 1".  I'd have been ok with that (I think), especially at an $8-10/month price point.  Everyone gets the increased junk storage and atoms (with a minimum of 1 new outfit like the NCR armor per month), and dedicated, persistent private servers could have been a higher tier ($12? 15?).
---
&gt; All the content we ever put out for Fallout 76--all the DLC, all the post-launch stuff--is going to be free. That's important. And to say, the Atomic shop is cosmetic stuff. To make sure folks understand--look there's a line. There are people who have crossed it, but we're going to stay on the right side of it in terms of the things you can spend money on and how this stuff works and what you're getting for your $60," Hines said. "That you know, when they put out new content or features or whatever, I'm getting that stuff for free. That feels right.
---
&gt; -Pete Hines
---
Not something I care about. I get my own stuff.
---
hell yeah 2k caps op shit at any discord server. Let's destroy what's left from this game economy!
---
Agreed!
---
And the server is only accessible when a paying member is on it.  I understand the server needs to refresh at some point but this is still not great.
---
I'm not one to tell anyone what to do with their money. I think people who buy $8.00 coffees everyday instead of $1.00 coffees are silly, but that's their choice.
---
But it is important to point out the losing battle. There's no purpose in people being outraged or even annoyed over this when they continue to support the behavior. And yes, I personally do think you are part of the problem, but it is your money, and you'll do as you please with it.
---
It's not that this subscription is the end of the world. Worse, it's actually just the beginning. I told people years ago that mobile gaming would infest the AAA space. No one believed me. Now it's happened. Another 5 years and we will continue to see boundaries pushed. Mark my words, we are not far off from developers beginning to paywall mission completion, endgame, certain skills/abilities in games, etc.
---
Question is where do we as consumers draw the line. That answer is different for each person. But we all have a limit of what is acceptable. Sure, I can afford FO76 and it's subscription. Do I want to? Hell no. I can't personally accept or encourage this kind of greed.
---
Imagine being this stupid.
---
Hey I share your oppinion, but these people don't want to hear it they already get it enough everywhere else. It's falling on deaf ears as they say.
---
It's literally ESO's subscription model with some additional bits/bobs at a slightly reduced price but not enough to justify the lack of content, especially when the game costs $30-$60 upfront.
---
I’m going on holiday for a week so I’m with you. Although technically I won’t be with you.
---
That is the view from most companies, unfortunately.  The company is there to make money -- that is its purpose.  If they can be on good terms with their customers the better, but it is not necessary to its function.
---
these are not private servers. they're just a paid subscription. a private servers entails I have the server files and control over the game.
---
Ahahahhahahahhahaha😸
---
Great find!
---
If you say so - but i already see a lot of users looking for someone with 1st membership on the discord. Guess now i know why...
---
:D
---
Any Semi-Auto Cards and anything that boosts sneak Damage. Those should be under Perception and Agility.
---
Oh thank you, can I have them call you as a reference?
---
I really hope if they sell it, they sell it to obsidian
---
Its our duty as consumers to not support this type of business practice.
---
You titty sucker downvote more I need less karma
---
So where would I find one of these, probably mythical beasts.
---
Ya but everyone bought the game and anything extra should be a one time buy or included free that's all
---
Me too honestly
---
Well that sucks
---
imo it's more that they have repeatedly said most of these things are not possible at all due to balance/sever storage/ (i can't even remember half the nonsense they've spouted at this point) but suddenly are not only possible but implemented behind a paywall, frankly i just hope the backlash is enough to get them to reconsider as at this point they've got one foot in the grave developers like jagex have been digging themselves with this mxt nonsense for awhile now..
---
&gt;fix the game first, try to earn money next.
---
How are you going to get the programmers to fix the game if you're not paying them?
---
It does look quite good.
---
Quality of life improvements shouldn't be behind a paywall.  Especially ideas that came from the community.
---
It's not that we're not getting what we paid for, it's partially that what we got was crap, and needs a lot of work.  Then they sell you the improvements.
---
I don't care about the private servers or the exclusive costumes.  But stash increases and other strictly convenience things should have been in the game to start.  There's a ton more things that need improving, and starting to put them behind the paywall is a bad sign.
---
Honestly, I'm fine with what I got out of the game as far as what I paid, but if this model had been in pace before I purchased the game, I'd have passed on principle.  I've done it before.
---
How dare you try and get an addict back into thier habit. This person is recovering via FO76.
---
I hope ur mistaken that shits annoying
---
Thanks for that, Zero. Nice to see you're still getting work. :D
---
Absolutely Not I've played over 20 play through's without mods. I still play fallout 4 with and without mods. My mods are mainly settlement building related and a few skins. Plus a lot of graphic ones to improve textures or change weather ect but game play is still the same. I know you can get guns ect but if I'm playing to kill shit I play no mods.
---
Xbox. I’ll be running the event tonight/tomorrow and also doing NW to get those rewards.
---
It was BS then and its BS now. I really wanted to sit down and demonstrate all the issues with 76 could have been replicated in 4 showing it was a client issue and not this "server" people continue to scream about, but never had the time. It just shows they now understand thier own engine and are using it correctly. Just if we want to use it, we must pay.
---
Its a subscription for access to private servers which additionally comes with some other benefits, which is not at all a necessity for this game and shouldn't be used to imply that the game suddenly has a subscription fee, because it doesn't.
---
Fucking fanboys.

---
Fallout is nothing like TOW. 
---
TOW will not scratch the Fallout itch, and vice versa. They’re completely different games. 
---
Stop comparing them because TOW is made by the devs that made a couple of Fallout games.
---
Some slimy money hungry asshat who doesn't care if the game LASTS a year, as long as enough people pay up front.
---
Ah yes, because who better to judge what the community wants than the company that acts voluntarily deaf to what everyone is saying and acts like the problems will magically go away by taking more of our money.
---
id support that
---
even if i lost out.
---
but thats what they should fucking do.
---
everyone who bought the game on day one gets a year free.
---
Do you have any idea what the exclusive emotes are?
---
Even a month would be nice.
---
Tbf I would laugh too. Wasn't it 30 bucks after 2 weeks?
---
I think that contributes to my outcome here; spent a boatload of hours on pc and Xbox in FO4 modded.  When I wanted to change things up, I’d just grabbed some new mods went to town. 
---
I so wish private servers were here in 76 and moddable! (Don’t think that’s a word).
---
I wish peace apon you
---
Ark, Conan (I think), Atlas, pretty much any game in the survival multiplayer genre, already allows you to host private sessions. It looks like thats all these FO76 "servers" actually are. That they're asking money for something so basic is pretty sad. Unless they're actually offering a dedicated service, but with an 8 player max I highly doubt it.
---
If anything I think it will make player vending better!  Think 3-4 high level vendors stocking only high value items.
---
I completely agree with you. What I’m saying though is that I like the franchise (even though some of the games are bad) and I wouldn’t like to see it cancelled.
---
Are you in the toxic valley?
---
I actually got lucky once and sniped a poor guy in his base while he had is back to the window and i was in the crashes airplanes looking down
---
I played fallout 76 at launch and I've been following this sub just to keep up with the game and see how it's progressing, but this is just... Wow.... Bethesda really needs to get a gripe and hopefully before ESVI drops
---
They’re taking ideas that the community asked for, then monetizing them. Plus the stash thing has been a huge complaint for a while, and Bethesda said it was just due to server stability. Instead they decide to monetize it.
---
Just get to the point. You HAVE to pay money to play singleplayer.
---
Yes i know. Zenimax takes care of ESO and they fucked it up with their sub and item shop.
---
Items are lines in a table. More lines = bigger file, bigger file = longer load times. But you already knew that.
---
Have you ever noticed how it takes a while to open your storage on an older Fallout 4 save compared to an empty container on a new save? Now imagine 24 players and all the containers on the server. 
---
I'm not saying it should be expensive, just that it is. The outdated engine probably plays a big part in that.
---
So you dont care about everything I mentioned above, but the scrap box thing is the thing that annoys you?
---
This is why they charge ridiculous amounts of money for fuck all, you cant complain when you literally are the problem itself.
---
I have wanted that for a hooooot minute.
---
I agree with all that but there’s a lot of people that enjoy the wasteland with their friends and don’t like certain aspect maybe of it. Giving them their own world they’d gladly pay for and use solves that issue. 
---
I think a lot of griefers and PvP’ers that instigate PvP are already bored... now they’ll be more bored and maybe find something else. 
---
On the other hand many won’t buy into the servers and will continue to sell... I see it as a win/win...
---
I’ll put money down it gets delayed to Q2 2020
---
Cool story. But you're still here posting.  I dont buy any in-game content that any company offers so why dont you go play in traffic and we'll see you in a month when you're here to cry some more about something else.
---
On pc also?
---
It's overpriced, regardless of whether they need it or not. Besides that, Bethesda knew the cost of this going in. They shouldn't have assumed it was going to be successful and that they could maintain the servers on the Atomic Shop/sales alone. If they launched it without a subscription, they need to keep it that way. The fact this news comes just after delaying an update that promises to fix many of the fan complaints doesn't help their case either.
---
this is the day the fucking bombs fell indeed.
---
cuz they just launched a SHIT load of one
---
\- Angry Video Game Nerd
---
(well i imagine thats what he might say)
---
dammit he should do a fallout 76 video i know he usually does only older shitty games. but really that would be great lol
---
It didnt scare me enough then... it does now.  - Luke on Fallout 76
---
Probably because their infrastructure is a joke. Private server usually entails you (the player) have control of the server. Difference is like Battlefield is it's called Host a Server, not a Private Server. But yes, the fact it goes offline without a Fallout 1st Subscriber is an issue, and so is the 8 player limit.
---
Every time I see something about this game pop up I am glad I avoided the dumpster fire it turned into
---
Yes, PC !
---
Bethtronic Sharts. Which is fitting for what they’ve been releasing.
---
Edit : what started as something off putting, and smelly, has become a steaming pile.
---
I don't think that was even the first, but it's an interesting find (and quick too!)
---
Maybe the ammo benches they announced months ago
---
This is 1000% because there LiVeSeRvIcE game will DIE without mods, just like all there other games... but if they allow mods then all their $30 "microtransactions" would be supplanted by free and objectively better versions, cutting them out of there only reason for making the game multiplayer in the first place!
---
Did you SEE the limp wrist attempt at making the ranger armor from FONV? a modder can (and already had for FO4) make one photorealistic, with all the gadgets and touches it had in FONV!
---
If modders are going to supplant their micros, them might as well bilk them for $100-$130 for the privilege. As for server costs, they are literally not accepting any extra workload, as the amount of players will remain constant as they are now, and when the players who paid for this leave the instance (which is what this fricken is) the servers dump all the information just as if it was an official server!
---
Well some believe that the private server money is what’s needed to keep the continuing expansions and service to the game plus keep it running for years. But my opinion is much different. I believe that this game is continuing to sell around the world plus micros so the constant flow of money and profit is still strong however I do realize that it will only last so long and at some point if there isn’t another way to financially support the game then they will have to end it. I have read and play with guys who refuse to pay for micros so I’d say that it’s just a small percentage of what they make on the game. My team and myself have already said we’re not playing private servers because that’s not the MMO experience that we want.
---
This is gamebreaking
---
It's not a private server though.  It doesn't persistently exist without you there.  It's a friends only session that's only available if at least one person who's paying $100 is online.  We aren't renting any private servers.  We're paying for access to a friends only game mode.  There's a huge difference.
---
They should have just given us peer to peer servers without a fucking subscription.
---
I'm honestly shocked there's been this level of backlash over the news of this subscription crap. Ever since the launch of the game this reddit has been overly apologetic to the game and Bethesda to the point that I thought they got lost on their way to r/Cucks or something. 
---
I guess Bethesda asking to be paid for screwing the community was a step too far.
---
To be fair, I don't think they make your bags easier to find at all.
---
It's so sad that people don't understand this, that's how were here in under 5 years. The gaming industry is really infuriating at this point.
---
Because your leader wears blackface. 
---
It’s reparayshuns n sheeeeit.
---
Wonder what happens after the month to your junk? Your plan seems good. I play 3 MMO esque games (FO76, Warframe &amp; Destiny 2) so between the three there is always content but I don't play all 3 everyday. I usually take breaks between content drops.
---
A month sub will work great for me. New content drops and I sub, complete the content and play until I am bored then switch to the other games and cancel my sub. Seems like it will work great for me personally.
---
Might want to check the sidebar of that sub and realize a mod here doesn't like a similarly named sub and has it set to automod it out. So when I say meerkat76 I mean what is actually in their sidebar.
---
It still sounds like you want to buy the sub.
---
Dude. Go spend time with your kids and stop spending all your time trying to bitch about games on Reddit. 
---
All of your comments are all the same. WWE, gears, fo76. Just nonstop whining. 
---
Imagine having so small a life.
---
I would probly buy some
---
100% of the DLC has been and presumably will be free in FO76, so why would they say anything about buying DLC with Atoms?
---
We called it, they’d add special storage for a damn fee
---
Edit: oh and with the people who actually get in to this get 1650 atoms every month, I wouldn’t be surprised if the prices of things in the shop skyrocket
---
[Angry Joe too](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QXQjx49JH7A)
---
Im with you $100 a year isnt that much but i would have like to be given the options to turn my extra pc to a server
---
A bit off topic, I tried Warframe as it was a free game with the PS4 when it launched. I just didn't really get it. For some reason I just couldn't wrap my head around what I was supposed to be doing,  why I was doing what I was doing, and what the goal was...
---
Investigate the area looking for why you can't place it there, they probably hid future content nearby.
---
Somebody else had their camp moved and there has been found the entrance to Vault 79 (the wastelanders one).
---
It isn’t unlimited stash tho it’s unlimited stash space for junk. They have stated in the the past that they can’t have infinite stash space due to server stability
---
You can also get fallout 4 for like 40$ or less in some places. Just saying.
---
The shit winds 'a blowin randy
---
Stash space is p2w
---
So, that was a lie.
---
I noticed the other day that missiles reduced to a WT of ~2 when I tried to dump some into a bear-proof trashcan that allegedly had a limit of 15. I think I put 6 or 7 in there before it stopped taking any. But when I carry missiles they cost me 4 WT :/ 
---
I’m not as versed as you are in scripting/dev/computers, but I thought it speaks to your point.
---
:( I wish I knew this. I’m still waiting until I can afford to get this game. It’s been a rough year. I still like to follow the groups so I can live vicariously.
---
Bye bye
---
Yea - I was advocate of this game for far too long.   SMH.
---
I really hope this happens.
---
🤷‍♂️🤷‍♂️🤷‍♂️ k.
---
this is smart. i actually got my live membership from costco, and it was a 2-yr so ive got some time before its done. ill have to look for this next time though
---
I will becouse you arent stating the problem and when i ask you still dont give it
---
*SIGH* This game is so much fun. It's a shame the rest of the world won't get to enjoy it, when Bethesda keeps making decisions like this and "proving them right".
---
I'm not clued up on how these things work, but isn't it a private "session" we're being offered, and not a dedicated private server?
---
IMHO part of the rationale for the Wastelander delay had to include avoiding direct comparison to Obisdian's new title Outer Worlds. BGS isn't know for stellar bug free releases and so far TOW is hinting at a very stable initial offering.
---
&gt; I literally coded the UI
---
#That's like saying "I was a UI designer for call of duty, so I'm qualified to talk about the back end data storage system"

&gt; and helped build the backend of gw2:HoT expansion from the ground up.

What does this mean????? WHICH part of the "back end"? "from the ground up"? 
---
You were doing full stack development on an MMO??? 
---
Again...
---
&gt;hell what languages do you even know?
---
C#, C++, PHP, JavaScript, SQL
---
And I have years of experience in **database normalisation**.
---
Gee wizz, I wonder what 2 of those languages have in common with database storage and server side data management! And normalisation? whats that!?!?!
---
lmao gay
---
I'm not so sure I agree that scrap space and the tent is a really PvP advantage. Maybe an advantage on world events or farming. I would argue that some skins are more advantageous than that. I play PvP centered games and a black skin or a bush colored skin gives someone an advantage over a crazy blinking gold skin. But it's not a popular opinion so it gets downvoted to hell. Not justifying Bethesda lying about the Atom shop... fuck man all we want is truth and transparency.
---
Yeah I mean your already getting the worth with the atoms , if you commonly buy atoms then this is a bonus with perks
---
Bold? No. It’s fucking ridiculous.
---
Doesnt apply for EU. We pay 4$ a week for 4$ in atoms
---
Don't do it!
---
That same 12$ could go towards:
---
A nice sized pizza.
---
A coffee and a really nice scone. Maybe two of each, depending on where you go.
---
Stardew Valley?
---
Terriaria (or however you spell it)
---
Gary's Mod
---
Don't Starve (tis the season)
---
It would partially pay for Outlast, or fully pay for Outlast's DLC.
---
You could put that 12 towards gas money, and spend a weekend camping somewhere.
---
You could put it into your savings, helping you accumulate towards other goals: car, house, travel, schooling, new PC, new clothes, etc.
---
You could buy any number of horror or fantasy books or comics.
---
You could pay for an entire month of Netflix. Or Spotify and explore various genres of music, dungeon synth, dark ambient, psybient, afrobeat, viking metal, post punk, etc.
---
You could put that 12 towards buying a Nintendo Switch or towards the Luigi's Mansion or the next Animal Crossing game.
---
You could buy that bigrig driving game on Steam and spend an evening dodging oncoming traffic.
---
You could buy a gigantic amount of salad mix.
---
You could buy several packets of socks.
---
You could buy a large amount of clenexes.
---
You could buy a porn subscription. 
---
You could buy an action figure.
---
You could sub to a Twitch streamer and spam fun emotes. 
---
You could buy Jenga or other like games.
---
But you are supporting it though. That's all. Just wanted to let you know. And if people.like.you(not saying you're a bad person or anything) keep doing it, then it will continue to happen. Wouldn't it be nice to receive all that shit for free? That how it used to be. 😁
---
After all of Bethesda's pretty heinous bullshit, a year of Fallout Cringe sub time is hardly acting entitled. Not that I give a f\*\*k about it, it's not going to make me, my RP Discord community, or my friends come back to the game.
---
These private servers they spoke of got us all excited, perhaps we would finally have a real multiplayer Fallout server free of hackers and exploiters where we could roleplay and mod the world as we see fit. But nope, we have instancing and are still under Bethesda's thumb.
---
A dedicated server is not something with a fixed capacity of 8 people, no mod support, no changing of settings, and certainly not **shutting down** after the owner logs off to eat dinner for 20 minutes.
---
You seem like a Bethesda fan boy and I find it hilarious that you think anything you said it worthwhile or meaningful. Bethesda is indefensible; is this the hill you want to die on, "Shankwelle"? Or whatever your name is. Fine, but I'm not going to listen to it any further than this.
---
I wish unending misery on all involved in this pathetic greedy move. You should be ashamed of yourselves.
---
Did you get the game for free?
---
I paid full price for this game, I pre ordered it because I was a massive fan of Bethesda. Such a mistake. I'm sick of defending this game, I'm bored of its lack of content. I was already irritated with the over priced atom store, this has just really pissed me off. Time to uninstall, it's obvious their priorities lie in money rather than developing a really great game.
---
Thats not what im sayong or talking about, why do you change the subject?
---
It’s not pay to win , it’s pay for a slight conscience with storing junk
---
Ghouls sliding around on the ground at WS is evidently still a thing.
---
Nope couldn't figure out why mine wasnt working either
---
- David Icke
---
~~*30 two*~~
---
Because their infrastructure isn't perfect, especially for the first integration of it in a fall out game.  But guess what?  No one's is perfect, and there isn't a single game developer in the world that wants to hand out their server infrastructure for their online only game to the masses and bring that risk upon themselves.
---
WoW has private servers because people reverse engineered it and created their own server infrastructures essentially, its not like microtransActivision-Blizzard released that.
---
!remindme 4 years
---
Good for you then. Hoarding things you’ll never really use and are pointless outside of PvP when the world poses no real threat, particularly as you use a universally capable loadout rather than stopping every five minutes to change your gear when you see a different enemy. Nowhere near pay to win.
---
You do NOT give Bethesda more of your money. That is what you do.
---
Don't trust anyone. Don't preorder.
---
I'm trying real hard but they I slip and down the dark fallout 4 16hr marathon whole I go. I'm never going to get my 1year chip 😢
---
Going forward, that man's words have 0 meaning.
---
All the things you said aren't paid to win, are in fact, pay to win. Lol
---
"Utility" is just a PR way of saying p2w.
---
&gt;Edit: I can't wait for Jim Sterling's take on this. Hope he doesn't blow an artery.
---
&gt;Edit 2: Aaaand his video is up. Poor Jim. I wish games were better so he didn't have to suffer so.
---
The fuck do you mean?
---
He literally makes a living off being an outraged manchild on the internet for fuck sake.
---
Guy is living the dream. 
---
It's pretty pathetic that you even follow anything Jim Sterling does.
---
true, is only 12 bucks a month. If you got a full time job that's chump change.
---
Yeah I had to scrap my bulk.
---
When you leave the private world it shuts the world down if you are the only fallout 1st member in that world
---
Is this a question or an affermation?
---
Unstable for complaining at the way they're pushing for income, stating i stopped playing and no longer have a future desire to play new content because of the corporate greed?
---
Ok, that's one big assumption mr. I can't take other opinions and/or criticism, muted by a stranger on the internet, oh the shame, what in damnation shall i do?
---
No you can still take out but not add anymore back. Its like elder scrolls online with the storing system
---
and Fall out 76 might eventually have that as well, but expecting that from the start, especially with everything else they've been trying to prioritize, is crazy.
---
They must have misspoke in the patch notes again. Classic.
---
project much? I wasn't accusing "You" of anything. I was speaking generally, "You" in the second person, plural. like, "damn, you (all) need to chill the hell out over this game."
---
If Bethesda realizes we don't need it, they'll make us need it.
---
Too late on that warning. They allready realize most of the fan base is happy to bend over for them. People kept justifying  their ridiculous atom shop prices, lack of content and constant screw up. Now they know regardless of how much we complain we will always keep playing. No doubt they will do something similar with elder scrolls.
---
Hope it's not like Obsidian's KOTOR 2 which was an unfinished buggy mess
---
Ah never played ESO and handed thought of that but that would make sense good point
---
Bethesda tested it's fanbase trough all the bullshit they pulled with the entirety of Fallout 76, they made fools out of everybody, going further and further, breaking promise after promise and all you did guys is take it. And look where it led, they just announced 100$ subscription service to A FULLY PRICED GAME, some of you guys bought the game ON RELEASE or even PREORDERED it and Bethesda knew, that it can fuck yall' and get away with it. And no amount of uproar will change much, some things might change but Bethesda won't stop doing this shit.
---
I don't know how many times or how many ways I need to phrase the concept that I don't care what you like. I was addressing the logic of the original argument. That being the notion that many people who are vocally opposed to this new direction will actually just give in and fall in line anyway because he will see a lot of player using this new product. When in actuality many people vocally opposed to this new direction are already not playing, and thus not represented in the game anyway.
---
The childishness here is apparent in how defensive you are in relation to parts of my comments which have nothing to do with my point. My point is that the people who will still be playing the game don't represent the people who don't play anymore or are quitting from this point forward. As an aside, I also describe the game as shit. And these mean words are the ones you can't help but fixate on, belying the childishness you keep projecting onto me. 
---
Would you care to address my point, or is the fact that Fallout 76 is a shit sandwich still too much of a smokescreen?
---
Why do you want me to stop replying to you and how am i a troll, maybe im just calmer than everyone screeching but im still willing to discuss this more civil than most that have an issue
---
First you’ve got to buy a membership and then unlock the outfit (for free) in the shop.
---
Sorry lol 
---
So I'm not exactly sure what this subscription means. You're still able to play, right? But you miss out on stuff?
---
why would you watch low effort outrage gaming videos?
---
Yeah, probably.
---
It was $17 dollars two months ago when I purchased it, how the fuck did it go up to 30+ bucks? Plus a annual sub of $100?
---
I've seen some CAMPs "floating" but nothing underground yet.  I thought they removed the ability to have a CAMP float and only supported by a stair case.  I thought about doing something like that but I can never be bothered.
---
Activision wants to know your location
---
If I understand the changes it will make player vendors much less competitive for those without the 1st subscription. Those of us without will still be forced to make regular choices about what to retain and often the option is to give away or dump items to free space. This new reality will be an important convenience for some of course but we still have scrip and cap limits in place.
---
Same bro, same. Just can't anymore... division 2 it is then...
---
I could use more socks...but more importantly, where were you when I needed help making more important life decisions? That's more detailed advice than I got about choosing which college to go to, or what to major in.
---
Just whiny asses. They'll all line up and buy the pass, or skip 76 from now on. But when ES6, Starfield or FO5 come out, they'll preorder/buy like everyone else.
---
gotta say I was starting to enjoy the game a little bit was even thinking of maybe splurging on a atom shop item to make my house look nice even said I would never do that. check the news today, no chance in hell am I ever buying anything of yours ever again.
---
Dude you are literally talking about 90% of stuff people buy. Whatever you feel has value has value. Imo. Sorry you're so angry about it.
---
But see they're not idiots. Most of the people complaining here will still play the game, will likely buy at least one month sub for a digital armor set, and will definitely preorder Elder Scrolls 6 $120.00 "roadmap edition" without even waiting for reviews.
---
Sure, they're massive scumbags, but they know their audience well. This whole thing has been a market test,  and the fact that this game is not yet dead is a resounding answer to Bethesda that this behavior is okay. Trust me, you will see the boundaries pushed way further than this in the coming years.
---
If I go out on limb, I would say yes you can place both but only if they paid the fallout 1st sub. Upon closer inspection, the 2 different smoke machines are physically 2 separate items and you can have 1 of each in your camp.
---
You do realize the entire point of this thing isn't because Bethesda loves negative publicity... but because they need this game to bring in more money?  Giving it away for free for a year is sort of the opposite of making money.
---
You can do it stay strong.
---
I believe im catching what you dropping 😏
---
The problem is that the game doesn't distinguish. "Private servers" are literally just regular servers that get locked when you join. There's no evidence that they've changed the network code in any of the ways that would be required to make what you're expecting work.
---
&gt;Or do I have to be a member to even have the honor to look at it?
---
Yep. Exclusive to Members only, but once you claim it, it's yours forever, even if your membership expires
---
Can you see in the future?
---
Thats awesome
---
 activision-blizzard Ubisoft paradox interactive also enter the chat
---
It's not personal, everyone knows the game is mediocre, anyone who disagrees need to play some decent game ASAP. If I were you I wouldn't dare say this is my personal opinion given my number of upvotes.
---
Wow, I can't even fucking look at it
---
Splintering an already dwindling base is concerning. F76 should just be free to play at this point to bring in new blood.
---
 The point of peoples annoyance with this is that 76 is a year old and is still plagued with issues that shouldve been fixed by now. Each new update/event has been a disaster or total flop. Things we want will now require cash and while not pay 2 win. Its pay 2 solve some major annoyances. Which again would be tolerable if it seemed like they cared about fixing issues.
---
 There hasnt been enough worthwhile content or improvement for any logical person to go yeah ill pay extra to this developer while the game stays exactly the same.
---
Yep.  Best  lead  spot in the game!
---
Yah but unless you need to play 24/7 not everyone will need a subscription.  As you did say everyone who wanted to play would need to get a subscription.
---
I play Warframe &amp; Destiny 2 and they are referred to as MMO Lite sometimes. I classify FO76 as a MMO Lite as well similar to Warframe &amp; Destiny 2. 
---
You can solo if you want in all 3 but I wouldn't recommend it. Solo WF &amp; D2 is boring. If anything I would like FO76 to start introducing match making for some content similar to a Destiny 2 Strike. It allows individuals to group up for one activity and then disband after completion. Works great for me as a solo queue player.
---
The amount of people here who do not know basic math is astounding. 
---
XBox live is 9.99 a month.  
---
Fallout1st is 100 a  year, or 8.33 a month.
---
Unless you are using an alien mathematical system, 9.99 is more than 8.33.
---
According to the devs, this game has been finished for about two years. That left two years to polish and get it ready. It's only a dollar, which isn't much for a brand new game.
---
I pity you.
---
At least on that game I have a fighting chance when a team tries to 1v4 me
---
And that doesn’t sound all that bad.
---
I forgot console players had to pay for games. I stopped that when I found out the 360 required gold to access facebook and netflix.
---
If they had used that, they would literally be liable for stealing an idea. This way, they can skirt the legalities.
---
Yep, I know, it’s kinda annoying.
---
I honestly thought Bethesda was done with the Fallout76 diarrhoea, but no, seems like they had one last steaming bowel movement within them.
---
That is true. But the fact that it includes features this sub has been asking for for almost a year now makes it look more like extortion than anything else.
---
i guess if you really need a fallout fix, though that just supports bethesda further.
---
Im not talking about CC. They literally put every mod on steam for Skyrim behind a paywall offering to split revenue with Steam and mod authors. Public outrage shut the whole operation down within 48 hours.
---
Bethesda was the one who brought the idea to Steam. People shouldn't forget that.
---
There is ABSOLUTELY room for better decisions on private servers and I'm hoping that since private servers are being sub only that modding is coming to support this lame decision. If not this is a very poor decision. The bank space I understand, but private servers should not have been behind a sub. I'd definitely have changed that one. Honestly sounds like this game was never going to have an offline solution and you're always just going to be on one of their servers.
---
Modding private servers better be on the drawing board tho, for certain.
---
Lose scrap and stable flux worked for me. Bulk items or hardened mass stayed in my inventory
---
Ya that what the other guy said thank I never played ESO or any subscription games for that matter
---
Supporting the servers forever.
---
Same with ps plus.
---
Damaged goods is damaged goods, obsidian would be wiser to start from scratch &amp; stay as far as possible from the name Bethesda &amp; FO76.
---
Most likely but this is something to hold them over.
---
I don't know why ppl are so suprise.... Bethesda litteraly invented microtransaction with that horse armor crap in oblivion, and now suprise Pikachu evrytime BSG fuck up for greed
---
Why are you saying $16.5/mo? That’s not the price.
---
&gt; $30 is nothing huge 
---
Brag.
---
Ah okay that makes more sense. I just found out recently that if armor breaks the effects stay, so that's pretty useful information. Maybe il have to think about a 3rd build with berserker.. it'll all depend on how well MW and Outer World's do.
---
Agreed.  Put some skins in the shop, maybe a few bundles I could buy with my sub Atoms, and put a lot of this stuff in the game as unlockables.  I'd love the idea of revisiting some early-game quests and sites at the chance of gaining a new outfit, etc. I think I've been to Point Pleasant maybe 3x combined over two characters.
---
Best post I’ve read on this all day
---
That's cool of you.  I just did the event, one level 300+ guy was taking it all and then proceeds to shoot me and toss grenades when I emptied a couple he hadn't gotten to yet, just getting angry at me for whatever reason. Like he looted every other container before me.
---
Paying for private servers and cosmetic items I can understand, but forcing players to buy a 100 dollar yearly subscription to unlock essential gameplay features? Fuck that.
---
It's not like Minecraft realms where it's always up, it's down if there aren't any subscription holders in the world
---
Go to weapon wheel and then press jump button
---
I do this too because ore sucks. If you come in late to the party just kill the moles since the person looting is trying to ensure all compartments get emptied. But heck if you're there from the start by all means I'll kill the moles and you all take the loot. My fave is when I hit the no loot bug and they're all empty so all I have to do is tap/unlock each of them.
---
[Ask, and ye shall receive](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMF5wSmQkDY).
---
Yeah £12.99 for the UK after doing my own research and finding the benefits although I don't like how they did it, it's not that bad all things considered
---
If you want to let friends into that server, does it happen with the regular Social Menu or are there other options?
---
On favourites menu
---
While I agree with all of this, I have one issue - Atoms \*bought\* are for suckers. No need to waste your money when you can get thousands for free.
---
Right like what the fuck is wrong with people?
---
&gt;What does this mean????? WHICH part of the "back end"? "from the ground up"? 
---
Literally the server architecture that required updating for the added features added in HoT so that the client and server were able to properly communicate, keep the datasets clean, and have both running in parity. Not to mention if you've worked in the industry you'd know that you get moved around from team to team quite a bit especially during crunch. So during crunch I actually did a bit of everything from play testing, to coding AI, and yes working on the database and how to keep it in parity with the clients.
---
Once again, what games have you worked on?
---
It sounds like you have some serious issues. If you are gonna get this worked up over a game that you don't even play, I would hate to see your reaction to something really important.
---
I've been enjoying Fallout 76. It ain't perfect, but it has what I'm looking for. And it seems to be what the market is looking for. If everyone really did have as big of a problem as the vocal minority here would have you think, then the game would have shot down months ago.
---
Right now it just seems like you're upset the gaming world doesn't revolve around you. Truth is, there is plenty  of games out there that could make you happy, but you choose to come here to be bitter about a game you don't even like.
---
You can literally go back into my post history and see me several times asking how to GET legendaries much less dupe them. Sorry for not being able to read your mind
---
&gt;I'm seriously trying to resist my urge to just buy it but my will gotta be strong.
---
Don't be an enabler. Corporations don't need your good will. They will piss on your head and tell you it's rain if you let them.
---
Stop taking it on the chin. Move on. Realize you are nothing to them but a wallet to be pried open through any means necessary. Don't let yourself get used like that.
---
It's actually just an abusive relationship some people have with these publishers. Get out.
---
And Fallout 1 &amp; 2.
---
I do. Considering that I haven't touched it in weeks, and after today I don't think I will ever touch it again.
---
It's bullshit that there's zero content and instead of improving the game they find new ways to milk the playerbase.
---
$130 here in Canada
---
You don’t miss out on anything. You can get private servers and a crafting bag (if you’ve played eso). Well you also get a NCR ranger outfit that everyone wants...
---
Does the tombstone say your name when you drop stuff?
---
Games pass for both console AND windows PC.
---
It does look good, however I'm VERY skeptical about the linear aspect
---
When did they lie though?
---
the last I checked, 9.99 (the price of Game Pass, or Now) is more expensive than 8.33 (100/12)
---
Yep np👍
---
You clearly don't know much Fallout lore and are just spouting the generic "lore inconsistencies" crap.
---
$100 for a year is like $8/mo
---
Nan only if you framed 100k of the same type of scrap people regularly get thousands of a week and builds up fast if you dont have to dump it.
---
I definitely agree, but to me fallout76 is worth money to. I understand not everyone sees it that way but if some players want it then why not try it. It will only be improved upon with time. (Hopefully)
---
I think you are closer to being a cunt actually
---
Yeah me too, I suppose Wastelanders could end up being a paid subscription for the F2P folks.
---
Yes they are getting my money tonight I spend more than that a month on coffee so why not?
---
Better than other atom deals
---
What seems ridiculous is console players paying Xbox or Sony just to be able to game online. That is the biggest scam. How come PC players only need internet to play the exact same games, it's like buying a car and then paying the manufacturer a monthly fee to be able to go on the freeway 🤔
---
complaining about how people have the mentality of "its just cosmetic" mtx in games is a toxic way of encouraging mtx in general. Games are now pushing Customization as a SELLING POINT in trailers and at conventions. When the end game is mostly about chasing cosmetic items down or grinding for them it becomes P2W for a skin that has no real value because at the end of the day when they shut the servers down, you no longer own that item.
---
Not here to argue, just saying my piece. I refuse to subscribe to (then cancel) this bullshit for skins and a scrap box they could put in the base game but WONT. I cant wait for the shit show these suits make of the elder scrolls games.
---
I refuse to put any more money in this game cause its still broken mess. People being mad for you IS A GOOD THING why do people seem to think that because people complain about something that they need to jump in defend it because they like the COMPANY thats driven to screw people for money.
---
You dont get a private server, you get you own instance while you are playing. If youre  offline and your friends want to play, they cant.
---
A server is running 24/7, this is a normal instance that would be normaly generated by the game when you start it. Only difference is, you control the whitelist. This genereates much, MUCH less server load than a real server, which you could rent for any other game, at this price point.
---
Oh fair enough. Well, enjoy the outer worlds, nonetheless. Only about 26 more hours to go
---
Pretty much every time people rage they end up coming back eventually. They don’t “fall in line” and buy into it, but the tantrum passes and they go back to playing as usual. Just because you see someone use something doesn’t mean that others will few they have to. And if people aren’t playing the game, then they aren’t worth being represented. If you rage and leave then that’s down to them. Especially over something not required by any means. “I don’t want to play this game and will talk bad about anyone playing it, all because I don’t want to pay for this optional thing I don’t need to pay for”. Those that stick around, where they “buy in” to the new scheme or not will provide the numbers and stats that they will see. You don’t have to buy into anything, but it’s “cool” to call things a shit show and rage right? To get so bent out of shape and scream rather than provide actual feedback. Hate trains are just too popular and are great at getting the views on social media. Parents don’t listen or bend to the whims of tantrum children. So why would a company
---
I plan to boycott everything Bethesda until they get their shit straight.
---
Honestly, if it was just a monthly premium membership thing that gave those discounted atoms and a few other small perks (y'know, not unlimited scrap space and second fast travel camp) I don't think there'd be that much of an outrage over this Fallout 1st thing.  It'd be a decent deal for those who actually buy atoms and easily ignored by those who don't.
---
But it ties in the private sessions that fails to deliver on actual persistent private worlds everyone was hoping for and expecting. And on top of that gives much desired and asked for unlimited scrap storage and second fast travel camp which are big enough perks to make it feel like a straight up punishment if you don't have it.
---
You don't own the server. You're renting it. Whether or not mods are available for free on them is up in the air. 
---
But come on, let's think about it. 
---
Paid mods will probably become a thing exclusive to this service. 
---
Bethesda has wanted it for years.
---
I ain't paying for squat.
---
I don't even spend the atoms I earn in game.
---
Cos fuck that noise. 
---
My progress might be slow but I earn every bit of it.
---
And there's absolutely no value in First. None.
---
why would i go through your post history. that's stalker level creepy imo, haha!
---
and you wouldn't want to read my mind, haha! have some upvotes for you troubles, though!
---
Is it just the normal ranger armor or do the desert and elite riot gear versions come with it?
---
This is honestly the **only** thing that's upset me about today.
---
do u feel offended by this question?
---
That is pathetic to look at
---
Yes I know this but I also know that they've done it before and in theory it's the best way for them to make money without keeping on pissing off everyone else, it's a long term investment for them and I'm in a place in life where the money is not that much to lose if it doesn't work out the way I want it and I enjoy the game enough to know I'm not going to just stop playing within the year so no harm no foul in my book.
---
So addressing my 1st question. Would that mean all captured workshops go back to their neutral state if no membership players are in there?
---
It like they don't care about people who don't want to drop 100 dollars on this game
---
There was a minuscule chance I would have bought the game when private worlds came out. Now with this shit I'm not touching it. I'll just pay the dollar to play outer worlds on xbox game pass. Fuck zenimax and their greed and fuck bethesda for putting Fallouts  now on the dumpster fire of a video game.
---
There’s probably at least 5 people who will do this, and that’s more money than they’re planning on getting otherwise.
---
Not all of us are as privileged as you, pal. Sorry us being angry that the game I paid $120 for is once again adding more MTX that hurt thr Game, completely breaking their promise about "only cosmetic mtx" Once again.
---
Minecraft? Rust?
---
There are enough empty areas in the map we already have to not need new maps for at least a couple of years. Plus, according to some past and only partially debunked datamines, there already is a 3x greater map in the game files with supposedly a new and permanently snowy region. 
---
It's going to be a while before we go to DC ot The Pitt, if ever.
---
Which is true. It only weighs 10, but it's a frame, that has to keep track of which item is on it. Two arms, two legs, torso and head, as well as a fusion core. All of which in turn track their own stuff. So while a PA frame only weights 10, it can be up to 8 full items, while for example 10 kilos of wood only track that they're wood and a number.
---
Feeling is mutual:)
---
Or for anyone who participated in the Beta...
---
Yup. Unless you happen to enter the same world and no one else does after you leave.
---
Just like server hopping, but paying 15$ a month.
---
I hope to. It does look good
---
Oh look this guy knows how to click buttons on his windows for tykes server installation. You think that makes you technically competent? I bet you couldn’t program your way out of a while loop.

I tried to refund it but was denied. I got stuck with it so I tried to get into it a couple times. Failed. Finally succeeded just last week and now I’m back to hating it

If you are not sure what I said, just reread what I posted.

If it helps you along, then no - i said nothing about whether or not mod makers should or should not be able to profit from their work.

Crazy how they never thought to implement brotherhood and enclave stuff to the atom shop, given the number of role-playing players and everyone's "aligence" to a different group in Appalachia.

Farming without people interfering is a huge advantage, along with all the other stuff that comes with the "premium" membership. Stop shilling for Bethesda man, its ridiculous.

Yes sir https://imgur.com/a/J50Nqdd

Make it offline if you want to play solo, but they’ll never do that, no money in it
---
It's an experiment in how much bullshit they can get away with before losing all consumer goodwill. Look at all the bullshit they've been pulling these last number of years and people like you are still willing to give them another chance. Those people are what they're banking on. The ones that keep saying "if X I Y" and when X rolls around they say "oh by they gave us Z, it's worth it" and continue giving beth money

Anger? I am anything but angry at the ever evolving Trainwreck that 76 is. Hoisted by my own mirth, more like.

Similar issue, I want to wear masks with the wrapped cap
---
Astonishingly that does seem to be the case...
---
Can you get nothing right Bethesda!? Srsly
---
Yup. The game is nothing more than a huge marketing test, and the answer to it is resounding; That this behavior is okay, and it will continue, because people keep playing and paying this game.
---
You know what, we all paid for the game.
---
Well I am telling you, it's not an opinion, it's a fact that this game is mediocre when compared with many other games.
---
That's why it's not worth subscription content before they fix all those problems because we paid for it.

I've never played the game and have no interest in buying it, but Bethesda seems to have completely disregarded its player base. 
---
Very backwards for a gaming company especially.
---
I do a good job :) that's why I get paid.
---
Issue is it's not a server issue. Since how much scrap you have is most likely stored in an 64/32 bits of data , which means the server can keep a track of either.

Watch they sell them in the f076 atom shop 1500 become a c.a.m.p. placeable pile of money and 1000 transfer to the starfield store.
---
Bought it because there’s nothing wrong with supporting a franchise that I enjoy.  Do I want more for my dollar? Of course anyone with a pulse should.  I for one have gotten hundreds of hours of entertainment out of FO76 already, I feel more than satisfied with supporting them.  The atoms are a nice bonus.
---
Astroturfing campaign. They want to make it seem like individuals are posting these but it's pretty clear it's from some group. Question is where?

---
Smoking all those dollars they're rolling in when people actually bought this "game".
---
I've been on my private server for more than an hour now and nothing in my vending machines are selling. I guess I need to lower the prices or something.
---
Kinda sounds like you give a fuck
---
The devs probably thought that....but marketing..... nope.
---
They could have taken this as an opportunity to get some brownie points by making the server 10$/m for people who bought the base game, and make the base game f2p. That way you get an influx of new players justifying the need for people wanting private servers.
---
big...
---
p2w concerns all kinds of ingame advantages and progression, not just pvp and literally "winning". You can absolutely have p2w in single player games, classic example being all those energy systems in mobile games, or when you hit a soft paywall where you can't progress without spending money.
---
I mean I get that, but I just don’t think this subscription is all that bad. I don’t think it really hurts the game nor does it help the game. Plus it’s completely optional. 
---
To me, the cons are that it just further showed how much Bethesda lied when it came to microtransactions and what you can get with them. Then the game itself while having improved somewhat decently since launch, is still not in a great state. So yeah there’s all that, but like I’ve said, I think subscription in of itself isn’t all that bad.
---
But an expanded stash, and a new mobile mini-camp ARE new game content.
---
I fucking regret this so much but god I loved the beta
---
Pay for convenience is still bullshit on a b2p game. This is something you see on a F2P Korean MMO not an AAA game. At least there it makes sense because that's the only other income source for the game outside of 20-30 bucks skins.
---
And people were expecting to host their own servers themselves, people was expecting they were gonna get their own launcher, not paying to rent one.
---
Yes. You need to invite your friends to your friends list.
---
I'm confused, is Bethesda the culprit behind all the money grabbing schemes, or is it Zenimax really the one pulling the strings behind the curtain? Little bit of both? I'd imagine it's like a repeat of Activision and Treyarch with the shitshow of their Bo4?
---
No mans sky has been completely overhauled from its disastrous launch all free of charge. Its had multiple title updates that have improved it. All from a smaller developer. Lets go play those though cause our opinion differs from yours on a subscription. Elitest class warfare even in gaming.
---
Fixing year old bugs would be a greater sign they give a shit about 76. Launching non bugged new events would also show care. They care about money like all companies lets not sugar coat it as care or potential thats based on nothing but blind trust in a company that has destroyed its once coveted trust with the majority of its base. 76 has been a disaster to their reputation and this just creates more of a divide.
---
Thank you, member
---
Lol you know how those immutable item entries just love to balloon in size and crash a server somehow.
---
Why do people seem to think the cost of xbox live or PS equivalent matters?
---
Bethesda has nothing to do with those fees and doesn't get any money from them.
---
If you have a problem with those, stop supporting Microsoft and Sony by purchasing a subscription just so you can use your own internet that you already pay for to play games online.
---
Or get a PC
---
It “just” works
---
I must admit I am struggling to connect to the players raging about this. I play other MMO Lite games and the prices seem to be on par. In FO76 I pay a sub for a month, get premium currency and some cosmetic content and also access to some paid for QoL items. I can play until I am bored and cancel the sub.
---
Destiny 2 &amp; Warframe works a little better in the sense that I pay upfront instead of a sub but there I get premium currency, a season pass and QoL improvements (XP boosters, better season pass rewards, credit boosters, resource boosters, resource drop chance boosters and in Warframe's case an opportunity to skip the grind on some items and just buy them with premium currency).
---
Maybe because I view FO76 as a MMO Lite game I don't find their practice much different to the other MMO Lite games.
---
And your statement is misleading. You can purchase Fallout 76 1st for 12.99 a month, or 100 a year. If you purchase it on a monthly basis, it is cheaper than 9.99.
---
Smh just go play another game, its that simple, I get people are upset but seriously bethesda does not have a gun to your head telling you to play their games do they?
---
Better than being a dick that's removed.
---
The mere existence of Fallout 76 proves this.
---
Microsoft now owns obsidian. Outer worlds is still published by dynamic division of whatever but going forward Obsidian is a full Microsoft first party studio.
---
It’s $13/mo or $100/yr
---
Well there are sever cost, maintenance and devs many games do this it free to play but if you pay you get perks since the money you pay goes for stuff for the game. ESO is same way. I think it is poor taste but I can understand.
---
I figured with the TOS being converted to Zenimax a few months ago that they were involved now.
---
i feel like they are trying to surpass EA since they are already equal to them the worst can be EA getting the idea of bethesda and implementing it with the AI that they have in development that is rumored to  target whales pocket even more.
---
Since there's nothing to win in this game how is it pay to win
---
It’s worth a month, to try out the private servers - me and some buddies been PvPing in peace! 
---
Few atoms to play with and the best looking outfit I’ve seen and I got some pretty cool ones! 
---
Worth noting, I’m gonna farm the hell outta the game and then still keep my scrap for when my month ends ;)
---
Nothing remains in your next server, it all resets!
---
Personally I don't have problems when playing( like, consistent bugs or glitches that ruin my play through. There are some, but never game breaking.. for me at least). Even on my Xbox which is more plauged than most, I still enjoy this game evwn when it fails. Fallout 4 crashed more on me with my mod list than this does and I love both. Again, you don't have to buy it (the subscription). And honestly then it makes perfect sense why it's optional. Why offer this service to all when a significant part of the customer base is consistently disappointed. From a business point,  why wouldn't you offer a service that can benefit your core consumer base... the base that are hardcore fans and customers....  these are two different demographics, both with valid reasons, but they (bethesda) are in no way In my opinion screwing anyone. I have Been buying atoms, that's my decision, and I don't regret it, I love the joy I get from these games, this service will help me, and other hardcore fallout customers, and I appreciate that. This game is a gift, no customer earned it... a huge team of people worked their asses off to make it, and I love it! They don't owe us shit.... they have a job, and luckily, they do listen to us, and they want to make products that we enjoy, and I think there isn't a single damn thing about this that makes them look like evil penny pinching jerks... regardless if you don't like the outcome, these services are optional and you have no obligation to buy. That literally means Bethesda has not only listened to it's customers but also moved it's business in a way that can still generate profit... I'm glad a company even considered it's customers opinions, cuz now days
---
... not many of them do... 
---
But they all consider profits ...
---
Guy who doesn’t play game tries to tell other people game is bad. Lol. That’s just sad. Troll
---
&gt;Your own server that's probably still insanely unstable.
---
You don't get your own server. You get your own instance. It's not even persistent. I know their implementation would be garbage, but I didn't expect it'd be this garbage. 
---
Shame on me.
---
This game is literally pay to win
---
Then it's those people's prerogative to not pay for it... I'm not sure why you think it's some brave or notable act to not pay for the service... I doubt Bethesda is actually expecting even close to a majority of players to opt in for this, just enough for them to bring in enough extra money to keep the game going for everyone else.
---
And hey, it only took a few hours but finally the first cheap jab that the only people that think this through rationally must be a Bethesda tool.
---
I hope *some* peasants stick around, if all the remaining players have NCR ranger armor it won't seem as special.
---
esper the playerbase that tried to stick to it and defend the game.  I still like the game, just not what the devs are going with it.  Haven't touched it in a while either but hoping wastelanders will give me more enjoyment again.
---
Pete Hines has been off twitter for about a month.
---
Now we know why - he's in hiding.
---
You aren't going to be able to right now, prices are crazy on memory right now, and an SSD the same size as the one in the ps4pro will be almost a third of that budget itself. You definitely won't be able to put together a rig that can run this game on anything but lowest settings at like 20 to 30fps.
---
Bethesda released a subscription service, so for $13 dollars a month you get a private server or session, free atoms, NCR ranger outfit, a second free fast travel point, and a container that holds unlimited scrap.
---
Bethesda: we hear your feedback, so we'll be adding a highly ask for feature which is to be able to play the game. This feature will cost $60 upfront but, don't worry every time you log in you'll be greeted with "disconnected from server" every few minutes or if you upgrade for an additional fee of $120 you'll only disconnect once an hour.
---
We like to call this a convenience package. With this package you'll also receive one loot box for FREE!! IN this loot box will contain a fix to a random bug! Can you collect them all and fix the game? Find out by buying loot box's with a shocking low price of $15 per loot box.
---
RIP To my cave camp. I had just started to get it to where I wanted it and now it is gone :(
---
At this point pretty much every long-requested community feature seems to just be answered with cash shop stunts now.  It's really disappointing.
---
More than likely.  Yea, I usually pick through it all, take what I want and leave the rest in the containers....But, I just hope at the end, I get the Plasma grenade plan...but I never do...
---
They added a 100 per year sub where when u buy it you have your own server for 7 ppl including u and now have unlimited stash and capped scrap
---
Not sure I understand this sentiment. There is no time or place for this offer. This just implies: "if they would've given us content first we could've looked the other way regarding this terrible practice". Stop tolerating this kind of behavior.
---
Not a server, it's a session.
---
Shiiit
---
I mean name another mmo rpg that doesn’t have the same things ? It’s the name of this type of game buy in or get out and whales have a serious advantage
---
Im more interested in a respec feature. Challenges that work. 3star enemies dropping 3 star gear. Lvl 50 not being the cap. Events that you know, work properly and have replay value not tied to a busted RNG. But if this games perfect for you as is set up that auto pay.
---
But man that server is buttery smooth. No lag spikes no crashes, own every workshop farm plans, already got a pink red and forrest asylum outfit. I love it, oh and the fucking legendary spawn rate is damn high since there is no competing. Best $13 I have spent since i spend 2 more than that on atoms a month.
---
Damn, I really predicted this when arguing about the first bs they pulled with scrap kits months ago mentioning how they will be turning into TESO! Sad to see I was right.
---
Oh dang where is  that?
---
group? are u guys hallucinating or smoking something?
---
please stop thinking is a troll group or something that is done in purpose to hurt the game when we all know that bethesda fucked it up so badly that is just sad and at this point is better for them to get shut down and sell the ip to someone who could at least repair this game and make another fallout games without the same engine and bugs since F4...
---
Ofc they will, just like they did with the Maxon's Battlecoat, Minuteman General, Mechanist Outfit,etc. I don't see how it is a bad thing tho, I might cave in and buy 1 month just because of the ranger outfit since I seriously don't care about anything else included in the subscription but it's not like this is a new tactic that wasn't used before.
---
You do keep all the cosmetic and avatar items after cancelling.
---
First off, it's not pay to win...because there is nothing to win. Like...these are all convenience items at best. The only real competing in NW.
---
No one needs 100 let alone 200 of any one kind of junk scrap...at all. Pick up what you need, leave the rest. The scrap box is to help people who can't legitimately do inventory management.
---
Forwarding base pay to win? No.. As a high level player I have more caps then I know what to spend them on besides the next mutation serum recipe. So the base saving you caps on fast traveling is meaningless, just a convenience. It comes with the ability for minor crafting you say? Well I already use Mappalacia* when ever I need a quick work bench. No "edge" there.
---
I swear everyone is freaking out over nothing and its just this mob mentality taking over.
---
" Ranger Armor Outfit "  
---
So if  I buy one month of premium, and never buy it again, do i keep this outfit FOREVER?
---
I paid 20 bucks two days after release and still feel ripped off right now
---
Doubt it, I think you may be underestimating what people are willing to pay for in their favorite games.
---
I would be willing to bet that this will be hugely successful in terms of profits, and Bethesda will not care about the bad press at all.
---
Right... these are all different currencies though. Is that a lot? How does that compare to the cost of atoms? You get 19,800 atoms for the year subscription. How does that compare to jut buying atoms outright?
---
Can't wait for full respecs to become part of the premium membership then. /s
---
I don’t announce my departure at the airport, but thanks for the feedback!
---
What did miss? I just turned this game for the first time since drop last night thinking all the bugs were ironed out.
---
We're all hoping for that plan...lol
---
Can't wait to get downvoted to hell, but just because the community suggested a feature doesn't mean the developers that worked on it don't need a paycheck. 
---
Just because you paid for the base content upfront doesn't mean the community can post four dozen unnecessary but nice to have improvement requests a day and get them without ever having to pay another dime. 
---
Just because you can host ARK for free on your own machine doesn't mean that Bethesda can host your data streaming from private machines onto servers they are legally responsible for securing while you play FO76 for free.
---
Just because Steve and Bob have unlimited scrap doesn't mean they win the game, the definition of pay to win in this community changes more than its collective underwear. 
---
You don't have to like it or to buy it, and you don't have to defend it, but the vitriol at the developers is something I haven't seen since I stopped working live shows at music venues. It's amazing how much this sounds like the people who CANNOT BELIEVE there is a $5 door charge to see this band because they're going to buy one well drink and it's not like this is Slipknot, so there shouldn't be a charge. You should be happy they came. For free. Just comp them in! (Times 100 people who all believe this because they don't want to pay the cover.) 
---
It's $8.33/month if you buy the year all at once, or $12.99 for monthly. Either pay it or don't, but let's not act like it's astronomical or that they put an actual way to win or existing feature behind a subscription. The game everyone has already been playing stays the same ~for free~. 
---
And you know why they keep doing this? Because much like Nickelback, people may all say they hate it, but an awful lot of people are paying for it. Bethesda isn't buying all those scrap kits, the players are. Kind of like the army of scrapbots laying around the wasteland lately, despite the Reddit shitfit that happened when they came out.
---
The comments on this are horrendous.
---
I can’t find it. If you’re talking about the protection emote, it’s called the Protectron shuffle and it’s basically just the robot.
---
Is a good business model! Finished your sentence.
---
I can understand offering a subscription service for access to a private server.  It is an additional service.  But to charge $12.99 a month ($4.99 a month seems like a reasonable price point), and justify it by adding other bonus items is wrong, when a some of those items have been user requested features or recommended improvements.
---
I continued to play Fallout 76 thinking when Bethesda increased Stash limits or increased CAMP budget it would make Fallout 76 a better gameplay experience.  From the game’s history since launch this seems to be an over expectation on my part.
---
If Bethesda allowed MODs it would kill their micro transaction strategy.  The MODs that have extended the playability of Fallout 4 are an example of what user feedback can do to improve the game beyond the designers envisioned.
---
I like to hoard everything.  In Fallout 4 there was nothing more satisfying than build a humongous warehouse full of power armor stations with power armor on display.  Each with a toolbox loaded with additional pieces and fusion cores.  I like being able to through prewar money into a bathtub as a decoration for my settlements.
---
I loved the mod that let you build on the entire island in Fallout 4, I built a literal Fortress.
---
I was hoping experiences like these would find there way into Fallout 76.  But, if they do, it’ll probably cost.  The opposite of a good experience.
---
No I don’t want your shit service I want you to cut it give us private servers with mods and more controls
---
100% without a doubt every single one of us who bought this game are chumps.
---
Dude, you can't even see now.
---
No it stays in your scrap box you can take out but not add...if your membership expires you can only retrieve until depleted...but if you renew you can then start to add again
---
For Bethesda's private world? I thought the post said the can only join IF the admin invites them.
---
Ok, this time I'm really done.
---
Seriously, I'm boycotting and not playing anymore.
---
No really, uninstalling right now. I've played 10,000 hours of a game that cost me a tank of gas worth of cash and this completely optional $12 a month is an outrage. I deserve more.
---
Fuck this, I'm buying Outerworldz.
---
*buys one year Fallout 1st membership*
---
believe me, you were. look how you've changed. now you can go to Bethesda hq and get fucked irl too
---
Hmm but Wastelanders is supposed to drop in March. If they close it any sooner it will cause irreversible damage to their reputation like Watchdog and Unity did to Ubisoft.
---
I'd say there is at least one more year, and by that time I hope the game is way better that it is now.
---
Do you play the game though?
---
After all that time claiming ash and goo piles had no effect on enemies ability to spawn, they've apparently fixed the problem that wasn't the cause of the problem that we thought it was causing to cause happen to cause the problem. Cool.
---
&gt;you’re basically buying your own server
---
No you're not. You're paying to be allowed to host a game on your PC. You're paying to use your own hardware.
---
How about $12 a month all you can dupe Buffett with one time access to the dev room ? Your welcome bethesda mention me in the patch notes
---
People are mad because Bethesda pay walled community requested features. This isn’t about PvP vs PvE.
---
I can't believe they are making us pay money to play the game now!!

A raider must be a raider, am I right? I hope you enjoy the 120€/year for a single player mode in a crappy server without mods nor actual reason to pay that money.

I think bethesda know that no one will buy into there shit, so infinite x 0 shouldn't affect server much, worse case scenario 2 or 3 whales will buy into it?

&gt; I don't think Chinese nationals living within the borders of China are allowed to play Fallout games.

And you are completely wrong. Bethesda even has a Chinese partner called "Sonkwo" which sells retail Chinese region keys:

---
You can use Google Translate even if you don't read Chinese. Chinese players can play it just like westerners without problem, despite they were just pretty much as disappointed as the latter did when the game was released, being poorly optimised and polished.
---
Anyway, Fallout games in China mainland is **absolutely legal**. But I agree that it's hard to get relevant information without being able to read Chinese.
---
Bloddied explosives for sale. Want AAE handmades only. No cap offers. Is that right??
---
on what
---
I think they set out this way but the money budgeted for servers which is extensive is not enough to scale.  This is their chance to get back on top and track with the game.
---
You want the game to die or get worse fine....keep on moaning about Atomic Shop and an available sub.  
---
I’m paying for it because I’m a strong believer in the game experience of a sub based game.  I have yet to play one that sucked and I’ve played plenty.  If things don’t get better after a few months I roll on.  I’ve already gotten well over what I put into this game investment wise.
---
F2P sucks ass in my experience.
---
The liscence plate is just "hahaha"
---
You must be new here lol
---
I was waiting for this and in fact would have paid extra too. All I wanted was to play this game alone on a private server and be able to mod it. Held off on buying the game for that. Looks like it’ll never happen.
---
I agree. I stopped playing this game for a long time like 3-4 months. Cause of the bugs and toxic player base. But you can’t be salty just gotta play a new game. 
---
I bought 1 month ima try it out and if I don’t like it I’m out

Pretty much. Shhhh no more good ideas guys or it'll end up in Private Servers.

I am definitely not buying the next Elder Scrolls unless it has insane reviews. Skyrim was amazing, but that was a decade ago. Oblivion was amazing, but that was 15 years ago. Fallout 4 was significantly worse than Fallout 3 or New Vegas. Fallout 76 just works, you can go anywhere, you can't even see the servers (/s). 
---
I'm not interested in supporting this company anymore unless it's obvious that they've put their work into the next game.
---
I use to always rent a server in battlefield 3. It was worth it for that. I’ll have to see if it’s worth it for this but I think it will be.
---
riot gear. Todd i love you
---
Omg I can see you have serious brain problem as well, get a doctor asap
---
Just a heads up it sounds nice but given the similarities between the PVP/PVE communities here and in runescape, it doesn't exactly work perfectly for everyone 100% of the time.
---
they told Adobe the same thing.....in 1997
---
You fuckers somehow support this shit game anyway.
---
You'll definitely all buy this and create a new trend even worse than loot boxes.
---
I will give it a go. I get it for free with my XBOX Ultimate Sub so can play on PC or Console.
---
No there's another one.
---
Dunno what you peeps are on about. Been using private worlds to transfer items between alts. Super happy about this. Was hoping for an account wide stash but this works.
---
Um.... when it was first announced they had a link with the price. They GIVE you 1,650 atoms / month included in the subscription lol. 
---
Since you like to convert atoms to dollars, I guess they are giving you $16.50/mo. Nice!
---
Don't let the door hit you on the way out.
---
Just play a different game. Fuck this game. How can anyone who likes Fallout play this game?
---
What’s the point, you’ve already paid for it.
---
Oh damn - just checked out the recent trailers.   Looks like they’re adding more content and responding to feedback!  Thank’s for calling this one out -  forgot about this game!
---
How are you still playing this game? There hasn't been a single good review since launch. I've never heard of anyone enjoying this game. Why in the world would you go so far as to pay a subscription fee to a company who shit in your hands and tried to convince you it's steak?
---
Update code was cracked it is 000000
---
Make it offline rather than this server BS
---
&gt;	to properly enjoy a game
---
You still won’t properly enjoy the game after you buy all this stuff. You’ll be playing the game you paid for, but won’t be enjoying it since this game is pretty dry of content.
---
Was thinking of buying this game but not any more outer worlds can have my money
---
I wont be doing it again, so at least I can thank them for the shitty lesson learned.
---
¨opinion i dont like = obvious troll¨ wow guys arent u a little old for acting like a 3rd old grade?
---
[laughs in Anthem]
---
I mean look at your post history all you do is shill for bethesda, so it is pretty damn obvious. You can't even say a negative thing about them. It is kind of sad really that you have so much of your own self worth tied into this shit tier "live service" that is going to end up offline before the end of 2020 at the rate it is going. 
---
Do you defend anthem just as much too? LOL
---
Stash and scrap limit are different things. There's only so many types of scrap so I would imagine it's a lot less load on the server's then an unlimited stash would be.
---
Well did you read the quote saying they WOULDN'T add pay to win features? What is your stance now that they have betrayed that promise?
---
There it is!
---
But how else are people supposed to feel entitled and start another hate train?
---
Wut
---
Can you play your public character in private server? I've been reading you'd have to start from scratch.
---
I would at times, like to play alone on the private server... I cannot do that if I have a friends list
---
Idk I saw someone dabbing in NW.
---
I have only done the event 5 times or so and 3 of those times were solo. Now I kind of feel like a dick for the two times I took everything, never knowing i was taking loot from my partner that was helping me.
---
i hope wastelanders is something u enjoy i really do i dont see how this game is gonna survive otherwise
---
Yeah it is
---
I recognize people all the time unfortunately
---
They do weekly state of the games on youtube. They are super into fixing bugs and since I left it 2 months ago they have added a new raid and 3 more missions and a new special.
---
Yeah I filled up 5 garages with Elegy's....wait ...what game we playing again?
---
&gt;we couldn't have unlimited stash because of the server stability issues
---
So I am not following this game anymore for each step but please tell me you guys didn't honestly believe that claim? Things are starting to make sense. From bethesdas perspective it must feel like they are talking to absolute fools. Ofc it is tempting for them to keep lying, ya'll keep believing it.
---
Nothing personal mate, but you people are part of the problem and deserve the lesson. ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯
---
To this day I don’t know why they picked free state out of all the factions, they make the least sense both popularity wise and lore wise (why would a bunch of free staters be making camps and proudly waving flags when they are just a group of libertarians?) the brotherhood was the obvious choice, they put them in the game for brand recognition the least they could do is milk the cash from them right
---
its not your own server if it dissapears after you log out
---
How about if the only way to get the membership you have to pay, up front, $500 and then you get the membership for an entire year.  BUT they give you 50,000 atoms.  Is that still a good deal?  For how many people is that a good deal, on average, would you guess?  This is stretching it but I'm trying to make a point.
---
If they had this exact deal, and also another sub plan say for maybe $5, without any bonuses or Atom points, but you got to use private servers, I feel it would make the whole thing way more palatable.
---
dude owes you 30K caps, don't let him weasel out of it.
---
My level 313 was fine. No different. No starting from scratch.
---
You can't restart it.  It's not your private server, it's your private session.  No persistence.  Big difference.
---
I would be hyped but vault 94 lowered my expectations
---
Care to elaborate?
---
23 dollars
---
Yeah this is some bull shit, if it was just servers that wouldn't be an issue honestly it makes sense. But the fact that you can have infinite junk and other things makes it pay to win and stupid
---
No there isn’t?
---
Sorry miss realized the quote, can't post the source as it is a direct connection to a server farm. Aka not a public price.
---
nope
---
My guess is that they wanted those communities to not have to deal with radioactive rubbles of a city hit directly several times from the moment they came out (none of those Vault's experiments were intended to be lethal, and 8 was a control Vault like 76), and give them some space to rebuild in a relatively untouched environment.
---
76 dwellers were meant to disperse across the region for gameplay purposes, but that makes zero sense from a realism standpoint as well. You want your community of best and brightest to form a safe little city so that all progress can start anew from there, but they didn't even give us a GECK. They couldn't have known that the forest would stay a forest, so it way quite the gambling not to leave us with a kit.
---
Vault-Tec being Vault-Tec, the option of specialized underground means of transportation to reach the vaults is probably the most likely explanation for putting these shelters far away from civilization.
---
It's their "Happy Anniversary, Suckers" to all of us who have stuck with them from the beta.   
---
As far as I'm concerned, the game is dead to me at this point, and I won't be playing it anymore. This was the final straw. I've been playing since beta, and have tried to give Bethesda the benefit of the doubt, but this is completely unacceptable. I think the only proper way for them to learn a lesson is for everyone to just stop playing and buying.
---
You’re absolutely right, I agreed to give someone money to get a product in return. However that product was not what was promised.  It was half finished, buggy to the point of unplayable for the first chunk of its life, and still incredibly unstable to this day. The product we were given was not the product we were promised and that’s the issue. Now BGS is asking me to pay a monthly subscription for a product that should’ve been part of the base game a year ago. They said leading up to the release that stuff like this wouldn’t happen. I didn’t pay for this product, I paid for the product they promised me a year ago. Do I feel a little entitled, sure. Entitled to an explanation more than anything. You may not agree and that’s fine, but if consumers conitune to let this sort of behavior go unnoticed then it’ll only get worse.
---
Yeah, no. Dude has a point. It's not just items. It's items with individual levels, conditions, mods, damage, 3 resistance values, accuracy, range, values, weights, etc.
---
All those values stacked on their own? Yeah, still not bad. But hundreds of them across thousands of accounts? Yikes that's a lotta bandwidth! It's why *EVERY* MMO has limited inventory and storage space outside real basic items that stack seamlessly like currency.
---
Oh my God that cave was the best!!!
---
"Alternatively, Friends can join a member’s world from the Social menu if the owner is currently playing on it. "
---
I'm not sure as it is very expensive to run a big Studio like Bethesda, look at how Telltale went down due to people working but not making money
---
Wouldn't it be helpful if your fighting the scorchbeast queen to have someone fighting with you that has massive amounts of ammo in reserve?
---
I don't really do PvP so there is no advantage to be had against me there.
---
Yeah same
---
Perhaps they aren’t humans at all.
---
*Sterling. Pounds is a unit of weight. ;)
---
Nah man it was pretty silent until today
---
If the game was fixed I’d almost certainly pay this sub without much thought :)
---
Yeah? Be like me and bought the collectors...
---
How
---
What about the top entry?
---
Also, you just need a friend with the subscription. Then join him on his or her world.
---
It literally is not. How’re all those “lawsuits” going?
---
OI! YOU GOT A LOICENSE FOR THOSE CREEPY SEX MODS?!
---
You’re right, this was never meant to be a sub game; the toxicity of certain people in the community was never intended either, yet here we are with griefers ruining the experience for quite a few of my friends and others on this sub. 
---
We’ve gotten several updates adding new content for free. I’m of the mind that if I can enjoy a Fallout game with a handful of the friends I’ve made on the game where I don’t feel obligated to run a PvP character (yes, I am my squad’s problem solver), it’s worth considering a subscription probably after the Wastelanders update. 
---
I still have my issues with the game, and where the game is at this second I probably won’t pay the sub fee. At the point Wastelanders gets stale like the rest of the game, Bethesda loses my sub. If Wastelanders gets stale after a month, they made $13 for what they are trying to pose as an almost DLC sized update that will radically change the game. They never intended to add NPCs, they caught enough backlash and enough of what player base they had quitting the game because there was nothing to do. I’m 1300 hours into the game, with the lowest of my 5 characters being level 98. How many other games do you get 1300 hours out of for $60? 
---
I have yet to pay for an update to 76, and by how most people talk I’m the only one. Granted, Bethesda owes us for the over all lack of content in the game. It’s absolutely asinine that Bloodied is the only truly viable build. It’s insane that caps are absolutely worthless and the entirety of the game economy is completely out of whack. I’m willing to consider $13 for a little piece of mind. I’m willing to consider $13 to not have server after server looted and having to compete with 23 other people on a server for a run through West Tek to get steel. I’m willing to consider paying $13 to know I don’t have to compete with some prick for a workshop to get resources for ammo I desperately need.
---
You really need help since are you are imagining things, maybe it's related to the removed dick thing of yours.
---
someone said 0000 works.
---
i dont consider buying the game playing it and refunding like if i played it. i hope that satisfy ur answer
---
That's a sacrifice Bethesda is willing to make...   /s

---
I'm hoping you're right.
---
They have other games.
---
Nah...strategically done to keep everyone grinding. If everyone had all the plans and reached pretty much endgame, people would  probably get bored and stop playing altogether imho.

Been around for online games for a while.

Most notably with diablo 3 before they added seasons and changed how the items spawned.

Diablo 2 referred to legacy items via their patch number. IE 1.08 valk.

Hate this games as service crap.
---
Wait you have to wear the skeleton costume?
---
I preorded this game, with a lot of apprehension about how it *could* play out, but with faith that they would stay true to what we've all come to love about Fallout. I knew it would have a rough launch, and that most of the issues would get smoothed out over time.
---
I could never have anticipated how insanely scummy they would become with it. The merch fiascos were bad enough. Then they go back on the **promise** that the atomic store would never offer any sort of "pay to win" elements. Shitty yes, but honestly not entirely unexpected.
---
The audacity for them to pull this though? That's shocking, and absolutely disgusting. To think that a lot of us paid full price for this game for them to essentially shit on a plate and claim they baked us a cake. We can't let them do this, they can't be given the impression that this is okay at all.
---
I've been a Bethesda fan since I first played Fallout 3 and Morrowind. I've been looking forward to Fallout 5 and TES 6 for years now, and all these stunts they've pulled with Fallout 76 have convinced me that I absolutely will not be buying either of them. *If* I do play them, they'll be pirated or bought secondhand so I'm not supporting Bethesda. They can crash and burn if this is how they're going to be doing things now.

They don't care tbh, too busy rolling around in money and using it to wipe their tears of joy
---
Say it with me: "Bethesda hates you."
---
I'd agree if the food at tacobell sucked or if they sold you expired, moldy meat and asked for a premium just to get edible stuff.
---
Would be nice if that wasn’t a paid feature as it should be baked int and not an unending 100 a year fee
---
Never back down never surrender when backed into a corner of your own making huh?
---
honestly hope that so few people partake in this that infinite storage for payers would actually be feesable
---
Just dont play them then.
---
Don't get me wrong I enjoyed Fallout 76, but this is ridiculous. 
---
At the least it should be a completely free update given to everybody because it's something the game should have been RELEASED with.
---
At the absolute most it should be treated as a DLC with a one-time payment of $10-15, after which you own and have access to it forever. Again, because it's what the game should have been released with but a cheap one-time DLC purchase isn't that bad.
---
"can pay to have unlimited stash of these junk items."
---
No. You're paying for a stash you can place unlimited junk in. You still have to farm the junk. And that's no different then farming, crafting, selling. I dont see how that would effect the market.
---
Would you pay $13/1300 atoms for the ranger armor if it was just an atom shop item?
---
I mean how can you not do what they have been doing when this is your playerbase? It's like they are dealing with toddlers that happen to have wallets. It's easy money.
---
I just drop a bag, change char and pick it up.
---
I'm on ps4 and both chars are on the same fast travel point. I spawn in on the bag basicly.
---
Worked for me as well once I refreshed my browser.
---
Lol good point but I've always used pounds as you know being a Brit I'll edit it though
---
I like completing the quests to get some sort of advancement on your character, like escavator to get double ore. Collectron, fridge and now the tent could of all been a questline instead just paid items that arent achieveing at all to unlock.
---
This is also sad wastelanders got pushed back and now we got this.
---
The fact this needs to be said is why Bethesda doesn't care about blatantly lying to consumers. The lies are numerous and well-documented yet people are still playing the game. There are so many better options available that the choice should be clear.
---
We’re paying to alleviate problems they’ve put upon us. The sub would be fine if the game was in a good state with good and well though out content but it’s simply not.
---
Agreed, and this is why I’m not rushing to pay $13/month. I’m just entertaining the idea because there is a peace of mind in private servers if the content is there to do with my friends.
---
When i have problems i check under setting in main menu that chat is not set all the way down, happens to me on ps4 sometimes.
---
Rarely it is due to the server, if this is the case we create a psn chat party.
---
Psn chat party is actually really great tool if your playing with more than 4. Or if you or one of buds is server hopping for vendors or tameable animals.
---
Edit- saw tag for pc now, but hope this helps you for the settings part.

MS bought Obsidian Studios and MS is having all first party studios release their games on Game Pass so ALL Obsidian games form now on will be on Game Pass
---
That's literally the only argument that would count. But that would NOT justify selling the solution for 12 bucks/month. They should've never released the game in such a desolate state and made sure all the components work.
---
Paying your ISP, then paying subscription to play online games, then paying for permission to play alone.
---
It's madness.
---
nope, it's under the faq
---
Yeah but it creates animosity between the communities. In runescape we're separated by the wilderness ditch, if I don't want to play with you I don't have to.
---
FO76 on the other hand with you being forced to play with all, and it's history of griefers, followed by buggy PVP protection mechanics....
---
Can’t stop playin if I never started.
---
So glad I avoided this dumpster fire and played other games.
---
No, pretty sure you comment takes the cake asshat.
---
I am - buying ALL THE MODS !!
---
oh i agree with you 100%
---
But you can’t pay daily, you have to pay for a month at higher rates, or a full $100 which some people can’t afford to just spend at once.
---
Right, don't we all upvote all the feel-good stories about giving junk to a new player? I know if I have extra I'll pay it forward, I'll go around fixing random people's bases.

Ah ha! That makes sense. Thanks for the clarification!

Yeah, because EA and Activision are doing so poorly. Sadly, people are going to not only eat this up, but beg for more.

---
Yup,  it's actually scummy and out of touch, the game should work properly before they add in game purchases like these "subscriptions"
---
Happened to me many months ago.  I stopped playing the game shortly after.  The blueprint system never worked for me simply because finding the right terrain to replace your building was impractical at best - impossible at worst.  My old area was made off-limits so I gave up.
---
Be a Brit all you want captain... haha... I'm Scottish.
---
they made a ton of claims that didn't deliver. i don't even know where to start with what they lied about.   
---
lying about what your product contains and then not delivering can be considered a scam.   
---
but the best part is that they fix some problems (not even close to all of them) by basically asking for almost twice the price of a triple A game anually. they're giving less than money's worth by a factor of at least 4 which can be considered extortionist as they own the IP.  
---
at this point the only ppl that i can imagine play are people that have money laying around they don't know what to do with.  
---
that's like going to a burger restaurant where its 20/burger and its been always great and then bwam they swap if for a mcdonalds cheese burger the next day, but you already paid for it and the sauce is missing (which can buy for another 20)

outer worlds is included in the sub. it's only 1 dollar for 1 month but that's plenty of time to finish the game a couple times.
---
Maybe... But you decide who's allowed in it, which gives you enough agency that it's pretty safe to say it's yours. Cheers!

No worries, and those words were given without regard! I wish peace and understanding apon your family! No appreciation needed! People owe no gratification, to wanting the world to be better for us all.... i Will pray pray for your understanding as Well! My friend!

How were you even considering blowing off The Outerworlds for this pile of hot trash game?
---
15€ on PS4 in France
---
Atleast they're trying to fix their mistakes. Can arguably say they've put BFII in a good position
---
It's on the Epic Games Store and the Microsoft Store. Also available on Xbox Game Pass and PC Game Pass.
---
Mines 20 bucks a month cause Canada! Whats that equal out to?
---
Two people are competing for scrap.  They both have access to the same game area, and have the same amount of time to collect the scrap in.  One person has unlimited storage and free teleporting between their home base and their current scavenging area, the other does not.  Does one have an advantage?  Yes, absolutely.
---
I’m not interested personally. All I know is the number of atoms they give you for annual sub is twice what you would get if you bought normally. Plus the private server plus the unlimited scrap stash (something I do have a serious problem with)
---
Which turns off once you log off...
---
No, the stash works the same in public and private. The junk stash is an item you have to build in your camp, under stash boxes. It can only have junk placed in it and has unlimited weight. You can take it out and put it back in on any server. I’m not sure what happens to the junk inside if you cancel your subscription though...
---
Under the year plan, you're basically getting half-price Atoms.  Will they produce something every month worth spending that on?  Probably.
---
Also, private servers are an interesting option.  Maybe if you wanted to level up a character without worrying about encountering creatures beyond your level, loot a nuke zone without interference from anyone else, maybe you are part of an RP community, or a streamer.  There are some interesting possibilities there.
---
I just don't think $8.30/mo is worth going to war about.  I play the game enough anyway.  Admittedly, I feel different if I was a console player and had to pay the online fee on top of that.  Or if I were an international player, subjected to some really screwed up non-localized pricing.

At least we got our canvas bags
---
I DONT LIKE SPACE THO AND I WANNA OPEN WORLD
---
oh my bad. everything is copesetic again...  
---
but seriously, thank you for the info
---
&gt;I defended and defended the game
---
Why though? I will never understand this. Nobody is saying that you can't ignore what everyone is saying and have fun playing the game. But defending it? Why would you?
---
Yep I spend $15 a month on atoms anyways, this just means I get added bonuses.  Also The Outer Worlds is still free on PC too if you have game pass.
---
I love how if anyone pointed out the lies months ago Bethesda was doing you'd get downvoted into Oblivion by you rabid fanboys.
---
oh thanks! unfortunately I dont have xbox. This just makes Bethesda look incredulous, damn
---
not dissing mcdonalds burgers they can be neat but its a scam if you expect some prague burger or smt and they give you that shit. (same logic applies to the game, the game can be neat-ish but it's just not worth or even what was promised)
---
That would have made the most sense but they have to deal with the current reality where they released a dysfunctional game.
---
Well Angry Joe pretty much summed up my thoughts on this mess.  What an absolute joke; they are utterly tone deaf.  I'm not even angry at Bethesda for this rubbish, maybe slightly disgusted, but mostly I just pity them.

No-one wanted MMO lite in the first place.  All we wanted was something akin to Fallout 4 or New-Vegas that we could play multiplayer with our friends.  We sure as hell didn't want some 'live-service' BS model where they try to fleece their customer base at every step.  Especially something that came out as buggy, broken and vacuous an experience as FO76 did.  But we made do, we had some fun (most of us) and kept on going.  
---
The base game isn't worth the original price, let alone paying that much for a subscription (especially if you're a solo player, like so many of us are now our friends dropped this game like a stone in its first weeks (days?) of release).  I mean, this is just sad now.
---
But you came in with your anecdote as if to say "you're wrong! I played new vegas and it didnt crash".
---
Gtfo with your bullshit. New Vegas is just as broken as 76. If not more.
---
PS Now is a different product entirely though compared to game pass. Now was the (awful) solution sony had for playing PS3 games for most of it's life. Game pass is basically like EA access
---
Eyy a Scotsman
---
I could but I have 200+ on my list XD I would have to be feeling aggressively antisocial XD
---
Because the ESO model worked the same way, until it didn't. The chapter updates don't fall under the purview of the "pass" and must be paid for separately.
---
It's a Bethesda game for both, why would they not adopt the same model for their first multi-player installments of their two biggest IPs?
---
It was separate for 500
---
Yeah, pay2win, pay2progress, pay2NotBeAnnoyedAsMuch, it's all the same thing. I wish we had a more precise term because "p2w" is misleading. Many p2w games can infact be won or progressed without paying, they just offer an edge to those who do pay or annoy those who don't.
---
Ohh I like this idea but can they maybe finish it first, as well?
---
Congrats on missing the point
---
You realize you don't have to buy the subscription, right?
---
Spit in the face of people that paid full price.
---
I'm afraid so, people will always find a way. I'm a huge Bethesda fan but there is no way I can support what they're doing with the game right now.
---
Even if the game was in a good state, the subscription would be hard to justify since they lied to the community.
---
At first I wasn't sure if it was solely a private world thing. I read the patch notes and found that people that get the subscription will have unlimited storage in public world's. While us peasants that paid the full price for the game and pre ordered it will still be struggling to keep that cute little teddy bear they found on their adventure in their stash box STILL.
---
I pay $10 a month for a gym membership I don’t use any more
---
Was talking to a true capitalist (sales 3 star legacy for real world money Aka black market) a while ago when they first announced the private server function he said if they don’t make it subscription base then it would hurt the market. But if they made it sub or non transfer to non sub servers then they were good.
---
Two things to take away from this, Bethesda supports black market trading of 76 and as long as the whales are happy Bethesda is happy.
---
+the $60 you already paid for it.
---
that bet was offered to bethesda. obviously they need the bank role.
---
whining is what brought us private servers, whining is what brings us patches/bug fixes, whining is what brings us new content, whining is what is bringing us npcs, whining if loud enough will reduce costs. keep whining. i love the whiners. thanks.
---
The comparison between Game Pass and Fallout 1st subscription is EVEN MORE FUNNY IN EURO AREA, BECAUSE ULTIMATE GAME PASS IS 13 EUROS A MONTH SO LESS IF THE 14 EUROS IS CORRECT (I haven't checked yet).
---
Stores were selling fo76 for 10euro here 10 days after release.
---
My opinion of the game has literally nothing to do with my point. That's about as simple as I can say it. 
---
I think the game and this new subscription model are shit. And that has nothing to do with my point. But I'll keep adding it to my comment because I like shitting on this product, and because you can't seem to ignore it.
---
Can you even articulate a response to my point without being sucked into my opinion of Fallout 76?
---
and outer worlds looks like some poor chinese company saw borderlands and thought "lets make our own"
---
Have you watched any gameplay at all? It looks atrocious.

Your friend can spend their money as they see fit. On the plus side, you get to benefit from any private server they host.
---
Regional pricing
---
It would be close to that in Aus
---
Likely closer to $17 and-something-cents
---
I encountered this message only once. It usually means that the place will be used for a future development. It gives you one free camp move though. If it's not bugged or something.
---
According to his post history, they stopped playing a while ago.
---
And that whitesprings always spawns low level mobs on a fresh server. Kill them, wait for proper level respawn... profit?
---
Yeah that's what in thinking as well
---
I think it goes to a cloud server hence why its unlimited
---
I love your analogy
---
[Here's a pic of the datamine showing the 3 Variations in a bundle](https://i.imgur.com/tZR4gZv.png)
---
So false advertising then? Is this a massive error if they are "selling it as private servers"?
---
Not trying to argue with you and I hope your day of work was proficient and satisfying but none of the changes are ideas from reddit. They talked about how private might work in interviews before launch and a subscription service with premium items is nothing new.
---
 Im willing to give gaming companies money after buying their games but not so much when it feels like im being manipulated to do so
---
Can confirm 000000 works. It turns out, this is the entrance to Vault 79!
---
I feel like the player base is going to shrink even more thus shrinking the whole playing with people idea. Wastelanders would remedy this by bringing in NPC’s which would bump up the base, so it seems really calculated.
---
Dude, theres got to be a point when the company supports the fans.
---
Yeah, my girlfriend has game pass, so I’ll be trying it out! If I like it I’ll definitely buy it!
---
This is really interesting but also sounds strange and should be tested a bit more... here are some easy tests:  
---
1. Go around to workshops and see if there are any left over structures from other players
---
2. Go to Whitesprings and see if anyone has destroyed the cars
---
I can't imagine why they would do this, it seems like an inefficient way to provision private servers. Like, people leave servers and rather then re-populate them or shut them down they keep them running in the hopes that someone will use it as a private server? It is also seems strange because I am entirely expecting private servers to be scaled down resource wise because they don't need to handle as many players. Something very strange here. Whether certain items spawn may simply be random.  
---
Strangest tinfoil hat scenario is that the same logic that kicks everyone out of a server if at least one player doesn't have Fallout 1st kicks everyone off a server as soon as you join it lol
---
I played runescape my entire life and throughly enjoyed it. Is there an in depth "skilling" system in ESO with perhaps skills as simple as woodcut ting, cooking, fishing, and firemaking?
---
I find while MMMOS often have skill mechanics or professions, they aren't usually in depth enough to focus your entire character around them and you tend to do those things on the side of questing/PVE.
---
But a mobile game would be free. Honestly, just play Runescape. Better game. Free. Can buy “paid” subscriptions with in-game gold now, which means if you just play a lot, you can get the member benefits. And you can earn gold a lot faster as a member (especially at higher levels) and just maintain your membership for free!
---
Most junk sellers sell in bulk already on trade subs or group post. And odds are they will probably link to the Vendors, because why would Bethesda not do this? They're already selling things the community suggested to be added. The community suggested the Fridge, Collectron, Forward Camp, and NCR outfit which are all paid things. Given most can be bought from earned atoms, but this itself is a ploy to make you spend the ones you earn to then not have enough to buy more stuff that is added. It's how marketing works, and Bethesda knows how to get money from people.
---
It’s 12.99 a month UsD ?
---
Didn't you already pay for the game though?
---
Well that sure is buried.
---
You also had full control of the server and they're persistant, these are not and are ass.
---
Ooo good to know I can't play tonight (early start at work) and I have a habit of bulking things b4 I stash so a good pointer to know. *starts chanting don't bulk scrap don't bulk scrap*
---
I don't understand why you would get so judgemental over someone having strong feelings about a game. For many of us, the issue isn't with what Bethesda is doing, but with the precedent it sets. A video game company released a game under the pretence that it would have cosmetics only microtransactions which certainly helped with the sales of the game, only to break said promise. A company requested feedback for monetization, disguising it as quality of life improvements.
---
It's not really about the game, it's about how us customers are being treated with a complete lack of respect. It's about how we were being lied to the entire time and when the lie caught up to Bethesda, they tripled down and essentially asked us "What are you going to do about it?".
---
Make no mistake; this subscription service needs to fail. Fallout 76, whether you like it or not, needs to forever be remembered as a financial mistake so that this kind of move does not become a standard for the industry as it has with lootboxes or "time savers". People like u/dj-mike-h and u/MegatonDeathclaws are part of the problem by virtue of the fact that they're enabling Bethesda's schemes and bringing us closer to the standardization of excessive monetization of full priced premium video games.
---
I respect everyone's right to purchase what they like with their money and I'm in no position to tell them what they can and can't purchase with the money they've earned, but I can certainly feel bitter about it, and anxious about the future ahead. It's as if in an attempt to fight climate change I changed all my habits and bought an electric car, only for my neighbor's house to run on coal and for him to drive a hummer. It's frustrating. But ultimately, my frustration is never against the people who fall for these monetization schemes, but for the executives who ultimately came up with them.
---
As an ESO player, once you go craftbag (scrapbox) you never go back. 
---
Fair warning for anyone wanting to try it out.
---
Anyone who legitimately quits over this would have quit for some other reason eventually.  
---
I think it's great and a very good move.  Shores up support with players they want to keep and winnows out the cry babies.
---
I lost the workshop. But my bag prevailed.
---
Well, some people did this on purpose. They'd build a normal base for their CAMP then once they were done building their CAMPs, they'd remove the base supports thus leaving a "floating" CAMP.  Looked pretty neat actually.
---
Nah there was a massive circle jerk at the beginning. Typical gamer anti hype train that YouTubers make a living off of...
---
But now it's indefensible even for the people who avoided jerking off the redditor next to them because 76 bad. I'll gladly lube up now
---
If they offered them for free they wouldn't be able to keep them up. Private servers will remove the trolls who are ruining the game for others.
---
Lmao, you can always go deeper. My money's on them putting mtx in _all_their games EA style from now on.
---
Gotcha. Thanks. And to verify you can just take your scrap out of your stash and dump it in the new box, freeing up more stash space correct?  I mean sounds pretty self explanatory but just want to verify that.
---
No problem, fellow Cincinnatian
---
I said this forever ago when the PVP people made it almost too toxic to play. Not my idea, runescape's.
---
But yeah it might be a cool idea, in runescape it was originally just a separate space. However as time went on and the PVP community fluctuated, the devs started adding content as a means to "lure" PVE players into a risk VS reward system.
---
So it can be interesting, but sometimes your just asking to have the top tier content stuck in there and then you eventually "must"  succumb to the risk VS reward system, even though you have 0 interest and experience in PVP.
---
It has its pros and cons.
---
Starfield always online singleplayer experience with atom shop!
---
Or maybe we just don’t pay for this absolute bullshit premium membership for an AAA title that has been fucking up since launch?
---
Time is also a currency, people can choose to spend it elsewhere.
---
Can't help but agree with you, as well...
---
I was trying to setup a Facebook group to fill a street with peasants to throw rotten vegetables.  Maybe a deep fake on Cersei’s body would be enough.
---
I am digging it. I bought in.
---
Arguably you would actually be COSTING them money by eating up bandwidth and server time :)
---
This would be a dream come true.
---
You're backwards there, there's no way allowing increased drop/spawn rates or increased XP and then transferring to production servers is OK.
---
Seeing as I have no issue blowing a 100 bucks on PoE in a month? By me refusing to deal with their BS absolutely hurts them. I'm a former game dev I throw money at devs who deserve it. That is why I've made it a point to make sure no one I know wastes their time with this shit tier game.
---
I have no idea why he hasn’t edited it
---
Sorry. Was it one of the old school true floating camps? (without any visible support)
---
Why so mad?
---
Damn, that sucks. Thanks for the help!
---
"But fallout 76 is multiplayer!"
---
yeah i know but my point is how is it pay2win if there are only 8 players 
---
barely any competition to win against
---
Thats like 8 whole games on sale
---
From what I have read in the patch notes. Once you disconnect and there is no other member with a Fallout 1st on the server, it shuts down.
---
Is there a possibility to reconnect to same server without friends on it, I don't know.
---
Straight up fuck Bethesda
---
They’re following something similar to ESO’s model—which worked for Zenimax.
---
This is what we all wanted. Not like what Bethesda gave us. Not like THIS! (Insert matrix meme here).
---
Remember when games didn't screw us like they are now? When we could play with friends on our own servers hosted on our own computers, not tied to a service that would kill the game we're playing once it went offline?
---
I can't believe there are idiots defending this kind of stuff and calling the rest of us babies for not liking it.
---
I'm not but you can go ahead and think that :)
---
I initially thought some players were berserk to begin with LOL
---
You are the type of fan that Bethesda loves, they can drop one of the most broken, shallow and greedy AAA game of all time and you still are going to buy and pay 13 Euros subscription for a private server, a basic feature that almost every multiplayer game has
---
Yeah and I played for hundreds of hours making it also cents per hour entertainment. Now with the potential of content next year, someone has to bank roll that operation.  It’s crazy to think my purchase of the original game would fund content for years to come.  My free atoms in the atomic store sure wouldn’t.
---
Thanks for proving my point. Try harder.
---
I run a junkies rifle build and this is,more or less, my perk load out

Is this like a premium membership or something?

Edit: nvm yes it is.
---
Why haven’t you updated the post? Instead you are spreading misinformation. I’m not defending everything just because I think people should be accurate in their criticisms. Why are you getting mad?
---
But it was to me... when they were talking about private servers and pretty much killing the player base and killing PVP along with it. Now I'm glad. I was so glad I got my own private server. LOL Thanks Beth
---
Ah the old "If you don't like it don't play it." Noise. Nothing shows a lack of integrity like binary absolutes.

The difference is that Fortnite is a free to play game that requires those cosmetic microtransactions to survive, while Fallout 76 is a premium-priced AAA game released by a prominent video game developer. I think Fortnite has excessive monetization as well but I understand why it does.
---
It's hilarious how far BGS has fell from the top. At what point do they pull there own heads out of there own asses and realize they are being super ignorant with there monetization for FO76. Do the developers even have a say any more with what they are working on? Or has BGS fell under control of investors and shareholders? This is pathetic and sad to see they deserve all the hate they will receive from this. It's just mind blowing they are pulling shit like this off when the game is so broken and unfinished, it's so unfair to us. Super disappointed in you BGS i'm starting to lose hope in there other franchises with how they are pissing on the FO76 community.
---
I hate Scorched.
---
Whoa, you showed us! What a little baby you are getting mad over a video game that your mommy probably bought for you, loooooool. Loser!
---
You can still play. They've already got your money. Besides you know wastelanders will bring you back.
---
That was the collectors edition but yeah
---
Who said it ran better? The frames run more smoothly. 
---
A solid 30 frames on PS4 is bad, but acceptable. 20-120FPS on a 1050ti/16gb ram/1tb ssd is just not enjoyable to me.
---
Outer Worlds on game pass for $1 looks really good now
---
? All I am doing is stating a fact
---
👌💪
---
Item duplication vs. unlimited item storage isn't even arguable. With unlimited storage, you're storing legitimately gained items that the game can account for. Duplicating items is exploiting bugs and causing unintended results, which even if noting is created by it, can result in instability when it occurs in excess. I've had plenty of single-player games end up with corrupt saves or crashes due to abusing glitches that didn't create any additional items in game.
---
The item storage is literally just an interface with item IDs that have a numerical value attached to tell the game how many of each item are available to each player; its not like every single instance of every item in storage has its own set of data attached.
---
300+ hours before I gave up.
---
Saw some similar stuff on my friend's server
---
Thought it could have been the auto-kill then when the mobs are not level matched to you
---
Came upon dead Super Mutants in his server and a death deathclaw at the power sub station. The Ants being dead is obvious as the deathclaw often kills them but the deathclaw being dead is strange
---
I preordered the tricentennial edition for $130 aud
---
No, they quoted you for a reason... no one is actually going to have an "unlimited stash" of anything, they're going to have a finite stash that just doesn't have a cap.
---
If in a single play session you collect 1000 acid to sell in your vending machine is that any different from my collecting and selling 1000 acid over a series of sessions as my stash space allows?  It takes the same number of enemies/scraps to produce the same amount of acid, you just did all of yours at once and I spread it out over time and your storage space available isn't giving you any advantage in how frequently people buy your stuff.
---
And you seem to be working off the assumption that they're going to link this new storage to your vending machines ... but that's not how vending machines work, they only pull directly from your stash.  If you want to sell some of your massive quantities of scrap you're still going to be moving it to your stash where it takes up space just like for anyone else.
---
Imagine being Bethesda right now.
---
That doesn’t even make sense 🤣😂🤣
---
I agree, private spaces is ok by me so far.
---
I don't get it. If you don't want it anyway why tf do you care? I bought the subscription because it's decent value for the money and I don't mind subsidising the game for those who don't want to pay -- even if they're tantrum throwing entitled whiners.
---
It’s literally just unlimited scrap storage and has practically no impact on the PvP side of things. Not to mention, the game for the most part is PvE. 
---
I get your other grievances, but one person having unlimited scrap storage versus one who doesn’t has such a minimal impact on the game.
---
You deserve a million upvotes.
---
Also a branding nightmare. Their brand image is so poor now. EA's evil, but Bethesda's just straight up incompetent.
---
They'll learn the hard way with the rest of America when the next recession hits.......just like their fathers did before them. All of that wasted money will be missed.
---
For now it appears that the federal reserve is going to continue pumping the market and people are going to continue to borrow and spend on useless items to achieve the never ending goal of being a consumer.
---
I'm with you I was dreading the need to spend $60 on Outer World's and will be jumping all over the opportunity to get it for one dollar.
---
We warned you.
---
The only thing possibly worse than this is if EA started selling an expansion for Anthem that fixes all the problems with Anthem. LOL
---
Makes a lot of sense tbh , but I’ve never seen the underground transportation and most vaults have cars or buses outside , again it seems like a bit of a dangerous and disorganised / unplanned method of transportation which you wouldn’t expect from a multi million $ vault. But yeah you’re probably right.
---
My god you arent getting it

Looks like fallout to me.
---
Hold on for a couple of months they might add the option and charge you for it.
---
This seems basically equivalent to Minecraft Realms, in terms of pricing and server setup, course then there's the bonus' which is just disturbing considering how big a difference they make compared to "normal" players.
---
As a console player we've been getting used to this as the years pass except that in reality we don't have a problem paying for it the problem comes when the game is in this bad of a state.
---
It’s not “BOLD” it’s fucking disgraceful, DUMB CUNTS!
---
Zenimax Surely helped out with F76. They're stupid sub in ESO+ item shop+ disabled game sharing (only game on the market that does that) ruined an otherwise game for me. What a fucking joke. I had high hopes for F76. Uninstalled it today after I've learned about the sub.
---
This is whati want to know as well, i just ran into a guy with the outfit and it looks very cool
---
Does the railway Rifle trick still work or was it patched?
---
The whole game is a rip off. They market their content updates as DLC so you'll be paying a lot of money if you're not a sub. There's so much monetization to the game now that I honestly can't believe that the updates aren't free.
---
And you hit the nail on the head with the xpacs. Last one I bought was Morrowind. No new dungeons, Short questline, and that arc they teased with orsinium that the deadric princes are getting ready for war? They just tease you again so you have to pay $20 for the clockwork city DLC to see the story they teased almost *2 years before*.
---
C.A.N.V.A.S.
---
I wouldn't take this post seriously.
---
Enjoy your pay to win content.
---
70% of your stash is junk? Geez
---
Have you ever thought that junk sitting there is just useless, wasting space? Yes you can choose however you play, but to play in a stupid way and then whine about it, is weak.
---
Weapon Weight Reduction is the 3rd legendary star and it does not affect how well the armour protects you.
---
That would be awesome
---
It's not the PVP part, it's the market part. I never said PVP. We'll see though what happens.
---
Lies, lies, lies! Lieing this much ought to be illegal!
---
I did a similar test, got the same results. But then after repairing one of the power plants I got disconnected by the server, came back and all of my stuff was gone.
---
Bethesda did say that in the future private worlds would allow for customization, so it may be possible in the future.
---
Such fucking bullshit, I should get a free year cuz I brought a moldy ass helmet
---
Over dramatic I think
---
Congrats OP, you trended enough on this sub for mobile users to get a push notification 👍🏻
---
source: i just got a push notification
---
No p2w, 16 times the detail, it just works, canvas bag, ect.
---
Bethesda brought that to the conversation. Some players are unable to see it, some are aware of it
---
theres gonna be 3 variants
---
I don't know how long you played this game and i dont know what is your expirience but the more you think about this "Private servers" (they are not private and not servers. They are just sesions on recycled servers where everybody from your friends list can join without invitation) the more it becomes clearly to you that this is very unfair for players without subscription. 
---
One of many things is the ammo. 
---
You can store as many junk as you want. Thats mean you can craft big amounts of ammo. For free players it is limited by your stash and your carry weight. For paid players it is not. 5.56 is used as currency. Unlimited ammo=unlimited currency. 
---
Other thing are events. 
---
Some time ago Bethesda tried to improve our end game expirience and they made a cooldown on events. This was a big game changer for end game players. I myself noticed about 90% less loot and legendaries from events just because every single event was overcrowded. Guess what. On "Private servers" you are always alone. You dont have to worry that somebody is going to kill legendary monster before you will do some damge to it. Just because of this  events like Uranium Fever and One Silent Night becomes more valuable than on public servers. 
---
Another thing is scrap box. 
---
Unlimited junk makes the whole survival aspect of the game a little bit funny and not important at all. All the carry weight and stash managment becomes less important. You dont care about your junk items any more and you have 800 lbs of stash space just for your weapons and armors. Because of the unlimited junk items some of the perk cards are also not so muxh important any more. You dont have to use Bandolier any more. You can just craft some of the ammo you need directly from your unlimited scrap box. This will change some build radically. 
---
There is many other things. 
---
Just wait few weeks to learn all the ways to exploit the new "Private Servers" Bethesda made for us.
---

[Fallout 1st Honest Ad](https://i.imgur.com/wEaHFZp.jpg)
---
Are you insane? Why would Bethesda give you something for free if you've already proven that you'll buy their shit full price?
---
Lmao, when they added the refrigerator I mentioned on this sub that they’ll monetize the stash box before the end of the year. I got down voted to oblivion and everyone told me to keep reaching.
---
This is a tough one to digest. I like the thought of having my 'private' server where I don't have to keep jumping worlds to find the popular looting areas all looted out. Not having to deal with some a-hole wreaking my grove, also sounds appealing. Is that worth $100 a year? Tough call. A virgin world for my plunder... it's growing on me. 
---
Yea, they want to make as much money as they can. Still tempting. So ironic Outer Worlds is based on the outlying planets in the universe ravaged by the effects of unbridled capitalism. Hmmm.
---
I went to Glesga (see what I did there?) Last year February all I will say make your food os top notch the scotch pies to the pancake things and the Irn bru in a glass bottle
---
It's because they're ashamed that Obsidian is better at making games than them.
---
Ad Victoriam
---
From what I can tell it's not unlimited storage or even unlimited junk. Just unlimited scrap. Not sure how that's game breaking but then I'm not really in touch with my weeping.
---
It is from this video, which is also great as well: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjyeCdd-dl8
---
u/SirActionSlacks still on the Fallout76 train? Please flame the shit out of this at the next what the duck
---
I dont either tbh
---
Oh, I got it. I'm super happy being able to go private to do ammo runs etc, but I was kinda worried when everything was still there. I still want to play, not just run a collector.
---
Every single person still logging into this game is an idiot in some sense of the word for supporting Bethesda through the fuckery.
---
true man, if this is the reason wastelanders has been delayed.. quite disappointing
---
I think they will make camp budgets much higher in private worlds in the near future.
---
It's actually kind of a nice, small change, despite all the other lame news from today.  I like it more than I thought I would.  Though that might be because the second one I killed doing the pumpkin quest dropped a junkie's handmade.  Just what I was looking for.
---
Who to?
---
There's only 33 scrap items, plus a number for how many are stacked, that's not gonna cripple servers at all. Folk are daft. Reddit is like Facebook now. Opinions &gt; Fact unfortunately.
---
oh my god, the things i just saw in this thread. you people have some sort of mega level stockholm syndrome i didnt even think possible.
---
i have no words to adequately describe how in the hell anyone can defend this. if your going to participate in this scummy business practice and perpetuate bethesdas idea that they can get away with putting out a garbage product and seemingly intentionally trying to make it the most anti-consumer product that exists...well you deserve to lose your money. you do.

How exactly does he win from having flux on his main account ?

No because it's QOL. You dont want it don't buy it

They wanted, and still do, you to give them your money.  More specifically they wanted, and still do, you to give them money again and again, forever, while they do as little as possible to "earn" it.

Lol idk about you but my scrap takes up a good chunk of my storage.
---
Lol you spent $600 on this game? Sometimes I look at the gaming industry and contemplate just how we got to this stage, usually once a publisher sinks to a new level of greed. Then I see people like you and realize it's going to get a lot worse.
---
How much space is in the new storage container , is it unlimited ?
---
I know it's only junk but being able to store infinte anything is pay to win in my eyes, this isn't a subscription based free to play mmo it's a full price game
---
Aye but legally.... wording can fuck a company.
---
Thank you for the information!
---
What ended up happen was further outrage
---
I don't play it, haven't for months, maybe a year, but I bought it so I check up to see if it ever becomes a real game.
---
ESO is the most fucking greedy game I've ever played. Subscription that is a must + item shop with some p2w items + 1000000 + race locked behind special game edition + paid dlcs that look exactly the same + expansions that you need to buy separately and cost a full $60 price and BEHOLD a system developed to bypass Xbox game sharing. It's literally the only game on Xbox that does that which means if I my wife wanna play she needs to buy everything again, which on a console is u thinkable (prices are few times higher than PC). ESO became a joke.
---
&gt;Turns out its the entrance to Vault 79! 
---
Wow, new vault they added in secretly yet again! Wonder what *this* vault will be used for

Are you fucking kidding me? Do you not have any downtime or break time at your job where you casually look at your phone?
---
Nice, now if only I had that kinda luck
---
I'm standing in the line 
---
£60 for the world's most buggiest game
---
I agree, these whiny kids need a timeout. I don’t know why they’re so ungrateful for all the things Mr. Howard is doing with this game. Todd is a wonderful beautiful man.
---
I'm blaming it on a server hiccup due to the new release bc I just got disconnected again, but this time after rejoining the private server all of my progress was still there.
---
welll...technically I didn't get disconnected this time, instead my game had crashed so there's that lol
---
Question: Im New on Reddit and wanted to ask how did you get this Brotherhood thing?
---
I'm not bothering about it, makes no difference to my solo adventure play, except the new login poster to the right of NW.
---
Just ignore it and enjoy the part of the game that you say you love, don't cut your nose to spite your face :(
---
He is farming everything. All legendaries are spawned just for one player. Do u see what I mean?
---
Not just players haha! Every walk of life! HeHe

---
He needs to grind way less? Also he can store an infinite amount? Paying to circumvent grinding is one of the facets of p2w. The idiots on this sub made yoh belive that p2w means only winning in PvP, didn't they?
---
Oh no, capitalism! How horrible!
---
Fun fact:  I have an actual, real-life, working, bar-sized, Nuka-Cola fridge in my breakfast nook. 
---
It cost me fewer real-life dollars than Bethy is charging for their in-game fridge.
---
You're being down voted but you're right. I'm in the same category as you, I work 2 jobs and have limited play time. I will be happily paying $12.99 a month
---
Todd is cool, you suck.
---
That's the joke.
---
Say what you want, I like having a stable private server
---
Ohyeah, no bet needed this games already a side project.
---
Lol you bogan.
---
xD
---
It's $14.95 for 1000 atoms I don't buy atoms usually so it's pointless for me I just like shopping peoples vending machines at the moment anyway.
---
Paying for servers makes sense. The outfits and tent seems like a slap in the face
---
There is no competition on acquiring loot, yet he can sell it on public.
---
I see your point, but unfortunately can't agree. Gaming standards, and dollar value are objective, it's easy to say that anything isn't as up to standards that you, as a consumer, have made your own version of. 
---
As far as your example of burgers go, most businesses will have some kind of representation of the product you're buying, whether it be a picture of a burger in a burger joint, or a trailer for an unreleased video game. In my opinion, the game play of Fallout 76 is exactly what I expected, because it's what was advertised and shown in ever trailer I saw since the announcement at E3.
---
Having problem with game play mechanics like storage space is not a sign of a lack of content or shortcomings from developers, but exactly what it is, a game mechanic. 
---
The addition of paid servers is not a bullshit solution to their game, but a way to give the players what they want. A business works by making products in exchange for money, and they are making a new product for the players who asked for the product they are making, simple as that.
---
Sorry if this offends you, but Bethesda did not do any of this to personally attack you.
---
It’s fun and I love Fallout
---
I can only assume they think their customers are morons and want to fleece them of every cent they can get. The problem is I think they will succeed. Only people who are morons will keep playing this game.
---
Bethesda:" Hahahahha. No."
---
Lol this is golddd ⭐️
---
Because why not
---
Thank you very much! I’ll pay it forward with a charitable donation.
---
Well I'm just gonna play the game and keep on not paying additional money like I have been since day one. Everyone else should have done the same.
---
It's fun.
---
They aren't really leaving. They just gotta save up their allowance.
---
If you cancel the service do the games stop working?
---
ThE sUb Is JuSt BiTcHiNg. If YoU dOnT lIkE iT tHeN DoNt PlAy It
---
Then leave. No need to announce that you’re leaving a game you no longer enjoy playing, mate.
---
Original (OG) Xbox One.
---
Well, the "server" is "virtual" running on "the cloud."
---
It's how things are nowadays... :(
---
The biggest reason they won't link the scrap storage to vending machines?  Because it would take more work.  There's also no reason for them to do it when doing so would actually provide people with a direct advantage in being able to stock their vending machines without a restriction based on stash space.
---
And you're SERIOUSLY counting the NCR outfit as an idea they stole to sell for money?  It's a fucking cosmetic outfit, the one kind of thing they were straightforward about selling in the first place.  There was never any reason to expect an outfit used by a west coast organization two hundred years in the future to show up in Appalachia... the only way it was ever going to show up was somehow as a microtransaction.
---
Angry Joe's was pretty funny as well. Dude almost popped an artery
---
That entire comment section should be posted to r/agedlikemilk for some delicious free karma.
---
Hey man fack you I had to wait until after work to be outraged! Let me have my piece.
---
I would love to believe that it is all a funny joke but that's not reality before us. Its ptw now, not a conspiracy hoax.
---
How did they lie
---
Annoyingly yeah and that's why I made the post and you reminded me I'm gonna edit it again and add this info in cheers, mate
---
All the flux he farms from one nuke is just for him only....to sell to public ofc.
---
On the bright side, there's a new dupe method involving private servers! Loot for all!
---
It does, and I did say that. My point was that the extra stuff wasn't needed, and that I'd envisioned the servers being a thing on their own, comparable to realm prices.
---
the challenges start on the 29th of oct. and runs until the 12th of nov.
---
The date is the start of the great war in Fallout Lore.
---
No, they are just dumb. But I too think its to reduce player numbers and earn some money before shutting down soon. (maybe 1-2 years)
---
That is a huge deal because scrap looting is the only reason to PvP other people
---
I’m confused though, technically speaking there’s nothing they can loot that you wouldn’t be able to, you would just have to wait, or hop onto another server and try again right?
---
It’s kinda like the fast passes at theme parks, it’s the same ride, they’re just paying to get to the end of the line quicker 
---
Not saying I think it’s a good idea, but it doesn’t seem as bad as your saying?
---
How is it fun?
---
At this point, I wouldn't be surprised if they monetized Wastelanders and Perk Loadout as a paid dlc /mod. Maybe get a 20% discount if you're a "Fallout 1st member".
---
I’m still playing I just don’t spend money ! It’s easy
---
What the fuck are you smoking where the size of your camp or what you can build in your camp or ANYTHING linked to your camp is limited by your stash space?  The ONLY thing even remotely close is display cases and you're going to run out of budget long before you run out of stash space.
---
I do like the random encounters that just happen with random people. I just think private servers, while highly requested, only serve to be another thing that divides up their fan base before it feels like a ghost town, even with millions playing.
---
EDIT: also Bethesda needs to stop running around like a chicken without its head. Do many mmorpg’s have private servers? If not (I don’t think they do), maybe there’s a reason for that and you shouldn’t do that. Do many have a battle royale mode? Maybe there’s a reason for that. It feels like upper ups are having the devs try all this random stuff and it just isn’t good! Let them focus on the game THEY know how to make. Stop trying to get them to make someone else’s game.
---
This is news to me, fantastic lmao.
---
Love the EA piece.
---
THANK YOU
---
I just want to start of by saying I never played this garbage and never will. I just came to see the reaction of people in the fuckall 76 sub reddit and I just want to say that I’m really glad that even people in the games own community are calling Bethesda out for there bullshit. It really warms my heart.
---
Ah yes, a very fair price for this flawless gem of a game.
---
Save your money and get Outer Worlds.
---
Hopefully not because now rare items wont be
---
We're just playing a videogame
---
Great advice. Personally I am happy Bethesda came clean and are more open about their goals with FO76. It is a MMO Lite with a sub and loads of MTX to get QoL items in game to make money first.
---
This is the most honest they have been in a while. This allows people to make a clear and informed choice.
---
You got a crippling meth addiction? You seriously want to sue a game company for 60 dollars? That you NEED???
---
Do the dealers have your kids as collateral?
---
you are the psychic dataminer of fallout 76 
---
this is the future
---
As long as people defend it, they will keep doing it. It's just a shame that they can't fix the core game before having the balls to ask for more money. I love Fallout games, but this one is going to go down as a stinker. Maybe more so than the xbox/ps2 brotherhood of steel game.
---
It's one thing companies locking core features behind paywalls, but the most embarrassing thing is how many players actually accept it and keep throwing money at those companies that milking them.
---
With every passing day, I get saddened more and more with how things are going with the Fallout series.
---
All we wanted was another Fallout game, some of us another TES game. Either way, a lot of us would have been happy.
---
But from what I'm seeing, Fallout might not see the light of day again.
---
Sound as bud! Sorry for bloody hijacking your post!
---
Looking good brother
---
in what game are private servers free lol
---
I think Bethesda need to stop existing but paid private servers are fine.
---
Even though its just a private session because fallout doesn't have persisting worlds,which totally kills the appeal for me.
---
What platform? I’ll link you
---
Maybe, but character data aren't bound to instances, since instances aren't persistent, so you'd end up just having a modded character and a vanilla character. What if someone wanted to run a modded server that actually makes the game *harder*? You could bring over your modded character from an easy mode server.
---
I don’t know.. I feel pretty bombarded today with this new patch announcement
---
How dare you use logic?!
---
I just dislike the whole idea of fallout 76, it just seemed like it should always be a single player game, at most a co-operative multiplayer game where there's no friendly fire and no working against eachother. It would have been awesome if it was just about working together in small lobbies rebuilding the wasteland and discovering it's mysteries.
---
100 dollars a year doesn't seem that bad considering most fucking subscription based games have it set to something like 14.99 a month.
---
Next TES will have no modding (or many many hurdles), Creation Club v2.0 (OFFICIAL BUG-FREE SUPPORTED MODS /s...), shitty DLC (worse than horse armor ofc...) while the engine will have some botched raytracing to go with the hype (years later). 
---
I mean, who needs 60fps? 3080ti or NOTHING!
---
It is different. You know the ohko guy, who stole your legendary? Thats him.
---
Don't worry, they'll charge us another 60-100 bucks for Wastelanders too, you know they will.
---
Bethesda is incapable or making jokes good. They make jokes buggy and let the modders take care of it.
---
Thank you for grabbing all this information. I think the rewards are pretty damn good this time around.
---
Why is this so fucking hard for some people to understand?
---
Likewise
---
Glorious
---
I like the game and I don’t take things like fallout 1st seriously
---
*stonks*
---
Is that a common thing through subreddits or is this Bugthesda's communist decision?
---
More space for other shit. Its an advantage. P2W isn't just for killing other people. Read the quote again, its a gameplay advantage.
---
Makes nooooo sense that after this long they put this out. This is fishing. I've already done a ton in the game, there isn't much left. Think I give a crap about unlimited storage? For what? A private world? Guess what, I log in and get a world with maybe 10 players and almost never see any of them. Their idea isn't horrible, price can be argued against, but this is 1 year too late.
---
Not even. They messed up so bad that public servers are going to be like private ones from now on.
---
I just don't understand why people who stopped or never player the game still frequent this Reddit sub, what's the point?
---
But ESO is an actual decent game with content.
---
Apparently it's worked for Gears 5 and Borderlands 3 downloads on Game pass for XBox console.
---
Funny quote from [u/EvanFromMars](https://www.reddit.com/user/EvanFromMars/) on another post:  
---
"funny how on the anniversary of the bombs dropping BGS bombed their studio metaphorically"
---
One of the best games I've played in past years. I'm a huge Elder Scrolls Oblivion fan and this totally reminds me that game. I recommend playing on hardcore mode right away. The fact that your position on map is not shown and you have to find your way around makes you much more involved in the game world. You also have to choose negative perks that you start with. I chose sleep walking...and I randomly wake up fuck knows where, map doesn't show my location so I gotta figure it out, talk to NPC's asking where am I etc. Fun stuff!
---
Me? Oh no, definitely not me.
---
Ooooh boy look at the time, I guess I'll be going now. 
---
Before I go, would you be interested in playing Skyrim on an alarm clock?
---
I doubt there will ever be any meaningful mods for this game. They changed the format of .nifs (game objects) and no editor can open them now. The creator of nifskope has not released a version that works with 76. Also, I'm sure the current .nif plugin for 3DS Max won't work anymore either. Highly doubt that will be updated. They also changed to upgraded textures so that .dds files can no longer be opened in GIMP. Gotta use Photoshop to open those files. Modding was largely successful in Bethsoft games because they themselves released tools both used to make mods (creation kit, havok collision export tools) as well as enable mod tool creation. If mods are to come, they will most likely be developed only in house.
---
Gtao
---
You will be given first access as a 1st member.
---
Much like the government.
---
Aaaaaaand.... We all just abandoned the game. See ya.
---
Salt and Sauce!!
---
I don't want it, don't cry... don't be sad :(
---
But there is no risk for this to happen. When bethesda doesn't change the next fallout will be garbage and you wont like it. No loss there. If they change or sell the IP then the next fallout will likely be good.
---
how do i get my money back from the mistake i made last year buying this garbage
---
It’s not a mandatory thing to play the game, you and your friends can play normally without it.
---
No see but the...
---
*Shakes the Bethesda Defenders' Magic 8-Ball*
---
...SERVER COSTS.
---
That actually made me laugh. Seeing how empty my friendlist is lately.
---
Ok well I’m enjoying the new Fallout 1st content so I can’t keep playing with you. Bye!
---
Also, there's this quote
---
&gt;All the content we ever put out for Fallout 76--all the DLC, all the post-launch stuff--is going to be free. That's important. And to say, the Atomic shop is cosmetic stuff. To make sure folks understand--look there's a line. There are people who have crossed it, but we're going to stay on the right side of it in terms of the things you can spend money on and how this stuff works and what you're getting for your $60," Hines said. "That you know, **when they put out new content or features or whatever, I'm getting that stuff for free.** That feels right.  
---
&gt;\-Pete Hines
---
This is exactly what I expected when they promised private servers with mod support down the road, because that's how private servers work in every other similar game.
---
If you exit the game then the session is gone..
---
Yeeeeaaa I’m good on all that. If this game was good,stable and still fun then maybe but all there is to do really is practice building your camp
---
How ORIGINAL 
---
I’m literally *dying* of laughter!
---
I mean, none of its really illegal. They promised private servers, but never explicitly said they'd be free or not. 
---
Is this whole thing a really shitty concept? Yes it is. But is it illegal? No it's not. Bethesda ain't the first to do this kind of thing post launch and they won't be the last.
---
The same people that buy mobile crap.
---
Ready the Harpoons
---
I have a large quantity of good 2\* weapons that I have gotten from the purveyor and some decent 3\* s from some enemies and some good vendor buys. I know for a fact that most of the weapons I have are not duped, as I have gotten most from the purveyor or drops. I do, however, understand your fear of being traded duped items, and I am willing to accommodate that.
---
Give it a year. Fallout 76 Tamriel Unlimited will come out
---
Hey! How's the grumpy monster doing ?
---
I like your point of view!! :) Probs for being objective and not rant like the rest :p
---
People in this sub love whining and really get amped up after watching fo76 youtubers feigning anger for clicks.
---
To spectate this dumpster fire and what low it will sink to next.
---
Lol sounds good, sport.
---
That is what you are getting. You didn’t bother to read the article? You can invite up to 7 friends to your world. And only the host needs the membership.
---
I lol'd.  Take my upvote.
---
&gt;Weapons, armor and thrown items cause server instability
---
So maybe they should address that and fix it? LOL.
---
No one tricked you. Chill
---
i dont get it, how can you have unlimited storage and use that in adventure mode 
---
if i have 99999999999 weight in private, what decides which item wont be there in adventure mode?
---
But will the loot respawn?
---
How about let's unite and not play the game. Their greed has no limits.
---
Yeah I'm sat here just thinking about the good times when they had a firm grasp of what they were doing and who they were. It's a damn shame.
---
I wish I got to experience morrowind and oblivion as the beauties that they were as you did. Cherish that memory forever and don't let this dissapointments ruin it.
---
I did. Two weeks after I bought it about 6 months ago. It's pure garbage.
---
If the person with the fast pass goes before you 10 times, Is that still not as bad?
---
Can you "server hop" to respawn enemies?
---
As per normal respawn rules
---
Yeah I had to decide if the timing was right for this one. It's probably already drowned out.
---
Are you the guy who eats 99% of the plate then wants a refund because you didn't like the food?
---
Uh, I think you are agreeing with me. I'm pointing out the price for fallout: greed 1st is nearly the cost of a real canvas tent, 15$ vs 25$. So you literally could buy the real tent for 2 months of fallout:greed 1st sub.
---
most likely.
---
Looking at how hyped the community is about it and Bethesda knowing what a sh\*tshow they're going to deliver again they probably went on the 'milk everything you can and dip out'-train to get as much shady money as possible before announcing the shutdown of the servers
---
I can't even wait to hear Angry Joe's review of this turd.
---
Now you understand how Bethesda truly is. I hope you carry this lesson forward for future Bethesda content.
---
I thought that you guys have this tent with scrap box. Why do you need another one in every red rockets when you can drop your tent everywhere.
---
Well I’d hope they’d not intentionally piss off... everyone...
---
Lmao nobody here will ever learn their lesson.
---
Its not.
---
Could be since you were kicked it crashed and the data was flushed which wouldn’t surprise me. Did you reconnect too fast maybe it was still in a shutdown process then the getting kicked maybe flagged it to delete because of a non clean exit. They could be using not clean exits as a possible issue and just resetting the instance. Or they are not persistent and that sucks balls.
---
I'll have it in my Watch Later as I'm on YT
---
Edit: wow 3 hours nearly, might watch it tomorrow then lol
---
What inspires such dedication to games you presumably know are so bad? I’m genuinely curious
---
*your    
---
   But yeah.
---
Thanks for that, actually quite funny :)
---
You're upset. I'm just asking for a genuine discussion
---
I mean, you can try to do a charge back through your CC company if it wasn't that long ago, but you'll have a hard time proving that an unlimited junk stash and a second camp tent counts as content.  You'd have had better luck back when the Fridge and Scrap Bot were released.  
---
I mean, you have a stash box.  This one is "just" a stashbox that holds unlimited junk.
---
You have a camp you can place near anywhere, the tent is just a secondary one you can place.
---
In the court of law (if you wanted to do a small claim against them) would be proving that is content.  
---
Then there's the whole question - is an interview of a product proof of advertisment?  If it's not on the box and not on any of their marketing material, it may not be considered advertising since at the time they said these things, the game wasn't out yet (or in beta) so things were subject to change.
---
If you wait for discounts, FO4 can be bought for under $10: 
---
https://steamdb.info/app/377160/
---
Sorry pal but the whole “you don’t have to buy it” excuse is dead. Stop trying to white knight for bugthesda.
---
Have you caught the bears laying on top of each-other and a box of loose screws?
---
Anybody besides me hoping we beat the EA 'prideful accomplishment' world record for downvotes?
---
Come on! Let's break that glass ceiling folks :D
---
Thank you mayor
---
Well shit if you buy the game and play it and don’t spend money on the atom shop you are not supporting Bethesda beyond what anyone else did buying a game they thought they may life.  In fact you’re actually costing them money by sticking around and not throwing extra cash at them.   If you leave. It’s less resources needed to maintain your presence so by not playing you’re actually helping Bethesda.  Why are you helping this giant corporation that doesn’t support your values?
---
Yea thats true. Is the scrapbox going to be limited to private servers only? Or will it transfer over to public as well. including increased build limits and everything else. They mentioned mods in the future as well. I'm sure thats only on private servers.
---
Truth
---
ok
---
Aud
---
License to run your own? Never, we gotta wait till files/code leak and p-servers open up. Like all other MMOs.
---
You have to be on Windows 10 but yes - Game Pass also gets you access to a few dozen other games.
---
Right, it is due to one being developed on a engine designed for multiplayer vs one designed as a single player game. It is why this game has had such weird bugs like the "speed hack" during launch by looking down and running lowest settings on high end PC's because your movement speed was tied to your framerate.
---
Yeah I’ve recently heard that Sony decided to allow cross-platform to come to PlayStation, but that the game developers are the ones responsible for making the functionality of cross-platform a working function, so I guess the ball is in Bethesda’s court or any other game studio actually willing to let us play with our friends on pc and PS4 at the same time...
---
Man I’m stupid idk what that means. I’m just gonna take my L and get outta here lol
---
The purchase of the original game, that was first of all bare bones and half baked, cane with the promise of “games as a service”, meaning that alone and the cosmetics pay for future content. Speaking of, what have we gotten besides wild Appalachia and a battle royal in over a year?
---
From other subscriptions, it's usually bound to that account. 
---
(With exception to GP/Gold)
---
Edit: you can cancel the moment you get your exclusive items and atoms, this will refund you immediatly.
---
Welp, it's not been a long time yet to really judge but so far me and the 3 people I'm with were solid. 0 lag issues to report, just asked em. They didn't even notice til I said, we've been BUSY! Just completed 2 hoard events, I still have to figure out how to do the tent thing...
---
If anyone still supports this then... I don't know what to say. Thanks for ruining fallout I guess?
---
Thanks, I hate it.
---
Does it matter how many times they go really tho? Your still stuck in your shitty line regardless of what they’re doing. That’s just ego getting the better of you.
---
Everyone’s freaking out about these servers and I’m just wondering when they’ll announce mods for them smh of course they couldnt just release it with the servers
---
They haven’t even detailed if mods will be available from the jump for consoles. PS4 has to wait like a year or more for mods AFTER Xbox had them as well as pc. They keep shit hidden because they know no one will like what they’re saying. Gives me a bad feeling about the mods
---
I enjoy this game, don’t care much about the p2w uproar. Might get the subscription, might not. Bought the fridge, bought the robot, bought a decent amount of atoms. If I gotta pay for wastelanders I may be done. I hope your wrong but with the recent update odds are you may be right.
---
#CanIHaveYourStuff?
---
Yeah I'll have what they're having. They must be high on some damn good shit if they managed to convince themselves this is a service worth buying for literally anybody.
---
So we get servers that are private, but only have 8 slots and don't stay online
---
And higher prices because of all of this other garbage that they're bundling as placebo value that doesn't actually have any value to the players. All it does is add another bullet point to the pitch.
---
I’m not gonna buy it
---
I really hope so too, since they keep talking about improvements they should consider everything.
---
I can pretty much guarantee you that they will do the same to TES6 as what they did to Fallout 4 - half ass a bunch of DLCs and a couple of expansions to start work on the next fallout 76-esque monstrosity.
---
I would sign up in a heartbeat! Kept hitting the max on FO4
---
Daaaaaayyyyyum.  Did you have that many saved up, or is there some trick to farming them that I don't know?  (I'm usually about the same luck before modifiers; more when drunk--drinking, unlike IRL, seems to help...with the right perk.)
---
That's the general feeling I'm getting from people, that followed by outrage. Can't blame em.
---
Yea I deleted
---
It was what they sold the game as up until the release, so I personally believe it is proof of advertisement. 
---
Though, the thing here is I'm not really talking about the camp system: I'm talking about the "private servers."
---
At this point I want Bethesda to go bankrupt within the next 3-5 years so that some other studio  (e.g. CD Project) snatches it and delivers an amazing new Fallout.
---
Yup. If the game wasn’t so broken still, after a year, then MAYBE. 
---
How hard is it to get the game into proper working order? 
---
Is ANY other AAA title game run this way?
---
I don't know why anybody's surprised tbh. Bethesda allowed the mask to slip as soon as they tried to implement paid mods. Short memories I guess.   
---
Let's not forget Bethesda was the figurehead for microtransactions in the first place with the almighty horse armor, which ironically would gain them praise today since they're only cosmetic. Makes me wonder what things will be like in 10 years.
---
If we're lucky, this will eventually tank and they'll just give us the f\_ing game already...
---
You can go into private and then switch to public servers with everything you got in the private one.. so back to 24 people
---
Yeah same here, about 3 months ago.
---
Clearly a development team with a lot more respect for their fans.
---
M-maybe its all april fools...
---
dont buy it either.
---
I expected private servers (or personal sessions) to cost $10 a month.  Something that is inline with other online subscriptions.
---
The patch notes said Oct 29th. Same as Mischief Night Event.
---
I agree with you.I am sure it will have a nice little story but I have no desire to play that game.I hate short games that you can run through in 15 to 30 hours then rinse repeat.Also looks way too cartoonish to me.Like they are trying to tap into the fortnite and overwatch crowd.
---
Also right now on pc its 1$ plus tax to sign up
---
Hey that's almost a positive! I rember on release my gf and I purely got enjoyment laughing at the game breaking bugs!
---
There's a Stash box in every Red Rocket on the map. I'm wondering if a Scrap Box will be available for Subscription users, next to the stash. Then, on the back of that answer, I was gonna ask, would it appear to normal players (scum) etc... and basically go downhill from there.
---
&gt;Bethesda purposely ignore New Vegas all the time
---
1) One mission where you find a grave with gold bars and Nick will walk up and say 'I guess some people have trouble letting go'.
---
2) That one robobrain in Far Harbor that mentions Vera Keyes.
---
3) Atomic Command has the New Vegas sign and I think you have to stop around 77 nukes from hitting Vegas
---
4) Deacon tries to override that Mister Handy in Covenant with Mr. House's password but since Mister Handy isn't a RobCo product, it doesn't work
---
5) In the Med-Tek building, Fixer is mentioned
---
6) Nuka Cola Quartz and Victory are seen in Nuka-World and Sunset Sarsaparilla is mentioned
---
That wasn't the problem.   
---
The problem was the authentication process.  
---
People were going on Steam and selling mods that weren't even theirs.   
---
Poor implementation, not poor concept.   
---
I'm a modder, most of us treat the CC as a god send.
---
Omg I SO am!! Thanks! My friends who play weren't sure but now they are all in too!
---
Oh please, EA is much better than this now
---
mod functionality will be coming out later on they have said this but id only do a one time fee not this monthly or yearly stuff
---
I do remember it back in Diablo 2. People would also cite the build or version # of the game. People get up in arms about e bay guys... Wooh boy you should of seen the prices legacy stuff im d2 went for.
---
Anyways not really sure where the term started or even if its a gamer term. Just a general term for things that are no longer in production. Sales term.
---
Do you think that the scrap box... gives you infinite scrap?
---
A private server that goes down when you log off. A private server with 8 players. You can't be serious right now.
---
I don't know how big of a company Bethesda is , how many employees they have , and how many employees they have working on this particular game...but I imagine they are not as big as Rockstar....and if them boys can't control the dupes , cheats and hacks that transpire on GTAO...then sorry to tell ya
---
Minecraft, dayZ mod, ARMA2, Star wars galaxies, etc.
---
I mean it's the same cost as WoW, for a tiny fraction of content. It's fucking laughable.
---
I don't even care lol they can bluster all they want, my little hoarding heart has it's chains off again!
---
I’m confused. That is exactly the service they are offering except you have to pay for it. Is that the only hang up for you? Doesn’t every game that offers a service like that charge for it? Even Minecraft servers have a monthly cost, no?
---
an F you would be shorter to type and encompass the same feeling.
---
It’s fitting it happened today. 
---
Nukes drop October 23, 2077
---
And now they nuked their reputation on October 23
---
They tried to pull this same stunt back when ESO was going to drop on Console
---
Nexus donation stats are pretty dismal for donations.
---
That argument is nonsense.  They dont LET YOU use the game as it was originally purchased.  There is no mode for me to pop it into my system and play it on my own the way it was originally purchased.  I am forced to play it ONLY online and ONLY on their servers, with their changes to the original game forced onto me.  Therefore, if an advantage is being programmed into the game and I am  required to pay a not-at-all agreed upon additional fee in order to access it, then I was baited and switched to a product I did not buy, and am less competitive unless I give in to their extorting additional funds.  That's unethical at best, and criminal at worst.  Again, they outright stated that the only pay to play content would be cosmetic, which is what pushed me over the hump to buy it at full price.    They LIED.
---
What’s up with all them dots on your map
---
Only 2 of these are actual lies, the other 2 are just marketing slogans.
---
I can't believe I just came back. Damn shock and poof I'm outta here.
---
All based on conjecture grasping at straws. Maybe if you played the game now you'll find that isn't the case.
---
Aye there's Stash boxes at every Red Rocket on the map. So, for example, you're level 20 in the Ash Heap, heavily loaded with Black Titanium, crawl to the local Red Rocket. Sorted.
---
Mainly for me and my family to play together. My wife will not deal with the trolls on here and my son has been griefed several times. This kinda solves this problem.
---
I genuinely like the game I have fun whenever I play it, and I don’t take something like Fallout 1st seriously
---
2 words: Outer Worlds
---
Someone should do an elegant fan fiction connecting the events of Fallout into the Outer Worlds. Definitely more Fallout DNA with Cain and Boyarksy, for sure.
---
If I was them I wouldn’t even know how to begin to cover this mess, I almost feel sorry for them when they’ll have to try.
---
Our situations are similar,I too store all ammo and aid on my char and  I have virtually nothing in my junk tab in stash. I bulk and sell it off daily to the bot vendors.  My stash is mostly taken by weapons and armor that I can't grind fast enough...almost all my repairs I do via advanced repair kits because I cant go through those faster than I get them from SBQ
---
I wish it was friend...
---
Thats why it is called first (class). Welcome to player segregation. Needs some uprising like 1955...
---
I am! Mags too.
---
\&gt; At this point I'm not sure if it's fair to compare it to EA. Bethesda is doing worse
---
EA literally shut down a few of its studios, and completely abandoned some of their games after they failed to perform and even cancelled some of their games before they were done being made simply because they can't monetize it. 
---
Bethesda only made a game that happens to be glitchy as fuck like the rest of their games, and charged us a fucking subscription for fucking private servers like a lot of other games do. i don't think bethesda is anywhere near as bad as EA, if they were this game would have been abandoned long ago and we wouldn't be getting another game until like...2025 or when the fuck ever.
---
like....goddamn, people chill the fuck out with the hyperbolic bullshit.
---
Say what you will about this update, but Angry Joe is about as big of a wanker as you'll find anywhere.
---
delusional af lmao
---
If you walk into a store to buy a coffeemachine &amp; it doesn't work you get your money back. F76 hasn't been working stable for months.
---
If a store cleric tells you the coffeemachine can do this and that, and it doesn't you go back. If Todd promises something and doesn't deliver, fuck me I'm the troll right?
---
It costs them 0 bucks to allow users to host their own servers. But it would also earn them 0 bucks. Doesn't mean a salesman can just come back on their word imo.
---
Apparently these internet heroes who call this trolling never bought shit with their own money irl Xd
---
I have a personal allowance of $600 a month so does my wife. This is no questions asked money to be spent how we please.  We also put $1500 a month away in savings or bonds depending on the market.  
---
This is what happens when you are young save up have a recession hit cash out buy houses for pennies on the dollar turning them into rentals and literally only have electric/water/trash and phone for bills while still working just to get out of the house two days a week. 
---
You should be less concerned with my budgeting and more concerned with yours. I feel if you think $15 means anything to me at the end of the day.
---
Well clearly they made a mistake and realized they can’t afford to develop the game model as is.  So they either no longer support the game, or make a decision that allows people to further support the game to continue develop.  People will quit, people will subscribe but the vast majority of people will do nothing and continue to log into the game the same as they did a month ago.  Life will go on without a hitch.
---
mh, that is quite pay2win and therefore cancer 
---
well done on delaying wastelanders
---
I mean, it's not game breaking, by any means, but it still makes a difference if you couple it with private servers being linked to regular adventure. Also, we're looking at a lot of potential for inflation if we also take exploiters and dupers into account.
---
Omg beat thing I've read yet thanks
---
Whatcha talking about?  The long scoped cowboy repeater is totally a better option than a radium rifle.
---
Haha, settle down sunshine, I stopped playing about 2 months after it came out when my storage was full of fucking scrap and Bethesda claimed it was impossible to increase the storage limits.
---
DOA for me.
---
Oh, that doesnt mean the normal definition for me. I mean Dead on Announcement.
---
Hol up, there is pvp?
---
I think your comment summarizes the divide in FO76. Some players see or hope FO76 is fallout but coop with friends. So single player RPG you can play with your friends. In that sense yes Outer Worlds is a rival.
---
Some players see FO76 as a MMO Lite in a Fallout universe. In that sense Outer Worlds is not a rival.
---
I am in group 2. FO76 is not Fallout 5, it isn't a single player RPG with friends, it is a full on MMO Lite like Warframe and Destiny 2, only in a fallout universe. It has the MTX and the premium currency and the QoL services associated with a MMO Lite games so it is one.
---
To me Bethesda did the best thing they could the last few days, they came clean on what FO76 is. No more lies about cosmetics and DLC and whatnot, just straight up money first MMO Lite. It makes the choice clear.
---
They should have been upfront from the start but I guess they made a choice on how much money they can make by duping Fallout fans expecting a Fallout with friends. That is on them honestly but the new message is good and clear. Players can now make an informed choice, do you want Fallout with friends? this isn't it. Do you want a MMO Lite in a fallout universe? this is for you.
---
its not active until the 29th
---
One of the reasons I originally bought it. It was also refreshing to hear it when bioware said it about anthem. With anthem, at the least, that holds true. Bad year for bio and beth though, 2 of my favorite developers just keep dropping the ball.
---
What outfit is it? I haven’t booted up the game at all in the past few weeks
---
You can bring your scrapbox (the thing with unlimited storage) to Adventure mode.
---
k bye
---
Oh... lol ok then
---
And if you dont know that your an idiot
---
...which is exactly why this is something they didn't need to charge for.
---
In fact, I strongly suspect that encouraging everybody to scrap and or "bulk" their junk before stashing it would decrease the number of record types, and lower database processing overhead.  So if they did this for free, they'd actually be lowering their costs (aka: maximizing profit) without risking ill will with the community.
---
Do you get to keep the Ranger outfit once the month is up is all I want to know.
---
Divide and Conquer. Make everyone question each other and fight among themselves. It's easier to Control the world that way. Xx
---
They're just regular instances that become inaccessible to the public when someone looking for a private instance joins. They're not private servers in the way people usually mean.
---
Do you really think it’s not greed? Lmao, all these decisions don’t come from game devs who say they don’t have enough to continue, it’s from executives that could careless about the game itself as long as it makes the most money
---
If they are following the industry they have multiple shards per server. "Private" is only giving you the ability to gate who gets into that shard.  I would hope they split them when mods are introduced, but wouldn't bet on it.
---
Still not a good decision. But I gues I shouldn’t care I don’t play this bullshit
---
If the people were as pissed at our lying politicians as they are as lying game companies we’d live in a completely different world.
---
Boy I would smoke you on this game.
---
Interesting, what platform? I am on xbox and mine is still churning away  just fine. It is getting to be a pain to defend all the time though seems like I get maybe 2 minutes in between so I am just letting some be taken over.
---
Nice.  Well you know what they say about Karma...
---
Ebay, we meet again.
---
Yeah true.. kinda want Fallout to happen so we can start over but that's just me
---
Well, you are literally part of the problem for defending it in the first place. It's literally what you get for being a shill.
---
You also get to use all the junk you saved up. Just can't add more when its over.
---
And they explained their decision to change that.
---
I mean you did kinda defend bethesda in you previous comment, so he is not really jumping to conclusions.
---
Buy Fallout 1st, you filthy peasant, and you won't have to hear him again!
---
Sorry, but that makes me happy to see even their paid shit is a failure like everything else in this game.
---
Sorry for your loss of scrap but damn does that make me happy to know the idiots who are funding this BS are getting fucked.
---
I mean, when your personal experience gets slowed down or lessened because of those that pay, yeah, it does matter. Consider the fact private servers offer in-game economy advantages.
---
Bye felicia 
---
I just happily paid for my first of many great months
---
Even worse considering you can farm legendaries alone, and with no junk taking up stash space, you can now stash a lot more weapons than others can
---
That's an awesome question. There's just no reason to right now lol the entire world is ours! I'll let you know if we feel like we need to, and see what happens.
---
If a CEO joins a company and makes all these greedy changes and short term profits go way up, and then they leave as the long terms effects hit, it makes it look like the CEO came in and did great things for the company and as soon as the CEO left it went into decline.  In a way it's a brilliant way for an executive to sell themselves, although it comes at the expense of the company.
---
Just in time.
---
Yeah it's pretty stupid but common the Todd guys just goofy. It's the only name they can target that and Pete Hines.
---
What's really unfortunate is when they do leave and the game is still shit, some people don't get the memo and perpetuate a dead idea.
---
Aye its a proper watch, pretty graphic too. All his films are factual based. Very very informative.
---
Bah, thanks for quick reply
---
Imo that's still not worth $100 per year per player
---
They all lost their minds. I legit laughed so much when I saw the list of premium shit. Everything community have been asking for just 13$, less than a PA skin. Go whales, go.
---
As I said, they went mad.
---
Yeah, I’d never heard of him and I just watched his video about this membership, wow what a crybaby. $100 is a lot of money, but I’ve also spent countless hours in this game enjoying it, so if this is how I can support a game I’ve loved then so be it. People love to bitch, but most video games have cost $60 for the last 20 years. If we were to adjust that for inflation it’d be about $100 a game and that’s for a game that you might play for a month or two. I’ve been playing this game for a year and look forward to another year or more with it. The only thing I don’t like is they put the stash box behind the paywall, that should be for everyone.
---
*giggles in sea to shining sea*
---
I thank you for the most delicious of arrows kind sir.
---
I'm with you on PC, but that doesn't solve the problem of a library on the wrong platform.
---
Congrats you pay for stuff instead of earning it
---
“I loved this game before I played it” really seems to sum up the 76 experience
---
This broke my ❤️
---
WHEEEEEEEEEEEE
---
Yes you do
---
The xbox store on console got some hiccups. 
---
You can find it on the official website of the xbox store if you can't wait.
---
As if it wasn't bad enough watching lv400+ people charging into events blasting mobs away with the best weapons in the game before anyone else gets a chance, this will just make everything worse for those of us who don't pay up
---
You could get it and pretend your internet bill went up
---
You dodged a bullet
---
Destroying their company almost looks intentional.
---
When does it start?
---
Ow.  You made my heart hurt, because he is most likely correct. 
---
My CAMP budget has been hurting forever.....and I just saw budget increases could be coming to Fallout 1st members.
---
been with the game since day 1...the way things are going I might have to uninstall...I can’t take this anymore
---
The best part is people saying now they're being forced to pay more. I love it. Stay classy.
---
This sucks... That is all
---
Same here.  Was leaving work drinking a fresh coffee and got this update.  Clicked it and dropped my coffee
---
Enjoy your pay to win. Get stuffed.
---
They are regular servers, but empty. Anyone can enter it randomly while you are away. It's not persistent.
---
I don't think you understand. Fallout 1st is like if they bundled a mouse and a keyboard, or a controller with the game, and programmed it so it'd only work with said controller. that controller is flimsy too, it barely works.
---
there's nothing stopping the game from being played with your regular controller from a technical standpoint, either. they're just doing that out of greed. this is Fallout 1st.
---
regardless, "games as a service" is the biggest sham ever. it keeps costs low and delivers a subpar product, sold on promises alone. Wastelanders was delayed? who cares! they don't have investors to answer to, anyway. the fans are the ones getting shafted so no biggie.
---
I see what you did there 👍
---
BUT THE EYES MAN LOOK AT THOSE EYES THEY'RE GORGEOUS 
---
*throws more money into vaporware firebox*
---
You weren't baited and switched. They never changed the premise of the game. 
---
It was always an always online game service with a possibility of private servers later on. No mention of how those private servers were offered. 
---
If you wanted to play it offline, expected to be able to do so and couldn't..... That's your fault not theirs. They never once stated you could play it offline.
---
Less competitive. Lolololol. Because of junk storage and a free fast travel spot? Hahahahahahaha.
---
I was actively buying up any I saw in vending machines , usually if they are less than 30 Caps or if I was near Max I'd spend up to 50 caps each. Never over though. I also traded a couple pieces of armor for maps so I picked up probably six or seven hundred like that.  So including this post and what ive done recently I'm definitely over 2000 Maps done.
---
Welcome to the real world kid.
---
Pro Tip: Life isnt fair, and people with money always have the advantage.
---
Pro Tip: If you cant afford nor want to pay, dont.  Go play something else.
---
Pro Tip: More people are paying for this than you realize, because we understand that 100 bucks a  year is cheap and devs need to get paid for all the stuff you guys claimed to want. 
---
Pro Tip: Freeloaders leaving makes more room for those of us who arnt.
---
120% actual employee
---
People are pissed at the lying politicians. It's just that 50% at pissed off at the 50% of politicians that you aren't pissed off at.
---
Damn dude. It’s crazy to see how everyone once defended the game, it’s like Bethesda saw how hardcore some fans are and then decided “We. An do anything, they will defend us” honestly I’m deleting this game, and I’m sorry everyone was so toxic towards your intuition.
---
What I was hoping for was a stand alone I could mod heavily to mess with the game for friends. Make challenges or drastic silly things later on. 
---
I wanted a stand alone that had no connection to a central Bethesda hub. Like how you can have a Minecraft realm through them, or host it from your own PC and you are the central hub for friends to join.
---
Ah hell yeah, ain't getting my money Bethesda but I'm getting that outfit. Thank yall for the quick answer
---
No I didn't. All I changed was putting quotations around Private World. That's what it's called... But okay. Way to make your point.
---
Feel free to go at them. I was trying to be nice and see what they did, but this... this is taking the piss. I would've understood if the servers were paid. But unlimited stash box and extra credits too... they can get all what they deserve.
---
Lol calm ur bits, it's less than $9, and just over $12 for month to month. But thanks!
---
Here in belgium € 15
---
Enclave bunker has it too.
---
No problem.
---
Buddy. Pickle smoocher. It's not just the paid servers. If you read the post it's about the camps that we can place, the infinite junk storage we were told was impossible among others.
---
It's not just paid servers they are pissed about. Take a moment or two to look at some of the hot topics in this sub and you will see exactly what I'm talking about.
---
Stupid Question, did they remove the subscription from Xbox store? I thought I would give it a peek ( not that I would spend money on it) but the page not found, I hope this was the result of the backlash, maybe make them rethink what they did.
---
Ha.  What they need to do is color code the bushes.  The true mvp of NW.
---
Where are you getting that from
---
And I could say the same about the psychology behind motivation in gaming. MTX isn't going away, because companies don't like any argument that includes making less money. Vote with your dollars, play indie games, whatever, but advertising is all hype and the idea that everything should be free forever just isn't rational.
---
I do think items like the infinite scrap stash and mini camp should be for everyone, or should only be available in your private world. Honestly I don't get it, going to a solo server in a multiplayer game?? It's starting to feel like I'm logging on and paying extra to play FO4 without mods or companions.
---
"F"
---
Can't get Outer World's either. Epic exclusive on PC. Nope
---
One step ahead of ya. I haven't played for a long while. I totally felt and still feel that massively-multiplayer was a bad decision for fallout.
---
Who cares what they said, they've proven they are unreliable. Learn from the experience and don't trust them next time.
---
Also I'm on PC username Ninerschnitzle
---
Thank God for Jim.
---
If we has I'm what?
---
Who wants to bet they pushed back Wastelanders in favor of this?
---
See you in a week
---
For someone that hates 76 you sure do hang around in its subreddit a lot.
---
&gt;It is such low quality it has a recommend score of 96, while fo76 has a score of 6. LMAO
---
Apparent game developer here taking a game reviewer's opinion as fact.
---
right
---
I can't believe so many people are buying it when it's obviously going to be broken, it's gonna take months before I'd consider this. There's nothing to gain by paying for it at the moment.
---
Or free premium forever for beta testers i mean we got nothing from it basically
---
It’s still happening, post-update. Xbox.
---
K. Edit: Yeah okay downvote all my posts. It's very pretty. 🙄🧂
---
Thanks! Never saw it before. Even if it doesn't go anywhere was still an interesting find. Thanks again!
---
It's actually 13.99 if you pay monthly.  Go back to school.
---
Thats not right, it doesnt fit the narrative! Private worlds are supposed to deliver all the legendaries directly at your feet, give you 4 rounds for every round you fire, instantly deposit all outfits into your infinite stash, and make you smell better too! You must have done something wrong.
---
Scrapbox is Fo76 itself
---
This game is going to lose allot of players to the outer world's I believe. I'll be playing it also but not giving up on 76.
---
When I stop enjoying the game.
---
Or if it becomes a PvP free for all
---
Sorry for the late reply well i personally feel that someone who is a premium member will have a advantage over somone who isn't as they will have an unlimited space for junk in which they can collect to their hearts desire without worrying if somone has gotten there before them. They have let's say a greater degree of freedom and like you said convenience than a non premium member. Like the whole shebang with the collectron was really petty. I think people were more angry at the principal rather than the actual robot like a few pieces of junk is not pay to win funnily enough i have that very same collectron in my camp as he really spices up the place. But the ability to store an unlimited amount of junk behind a pay wall i wouldn't say its pay to win but rather an unfair advantage in marketing although an argument can be made that they payed for that service but that's a different story. Like its not a drastic game changer but it will especially for us xbox users be felt by all of us on xbox. Interesting in a way i suppose aswell.
---
Bethesda has literally just given everyone a reason to play The Outer Worlds
---
Does everyone get invited?  I not played in a while.
---
Is this true?
---
Exactly.
---
politics*
---
Wait so how did you know about this? Is this some kind of campaign online to make these posts? Guess it's your cross to bear, kid. I'm gonna get a one month to check it out, but I was really tempted for a full year's but they have no extra incentive
---
If I was forced to play with a load of bitchy complainers all the time.
---
Lol I fucking feel you. A little bit after launch my friend was like "76 isn't even that bad, I swear! You should totally get it!". I spent $60 on this game and after like two hours of playing with him we were both like ".. wait this isn't even that fun". I later sold 76 to GameStop for about $5..
---
You say that as if that is only option.
---
Omg u guys... I've never been happier with a $12 purchase :D
---
Which is why the OP made this thread. They also said all DLC would be free. So if they decided to lock it behind Atomic Shop you would be ok with that as long as they give us an explanation?
---
I've been reading posts from supporters and it seems these people either have more money than they know what to do with or have grown accustomed to the mobile format.
---
I don't think there's anything Bethesda can do to turn these bugmen on them. they're essentially fine with being treated as the product instead of the other way around.
---
I'm hardly a "whale", I bought my copies for cheap and the only atoms I bought were the three special $10 bundles they did.
---
To answer your car question, yes. I've bought a few cars like that to restore and  paid too much for them just to get them and then had to spend more and more on them to get them restored to operating condition. I enjoy them, so I don't view it as wasted money. Sort of like how I paid half price for this game to start with because I knew it had issues and I didn't expect it to get any better for what I paid for it already.
---
I have no idea what you're talking about with validation and whatever. I was just illustrating that a normal person can find time to play a game a few hours a day and make use of an alt account without having to be unemployed.
---
I was also annoyed because you apparently know you were being rude and then proceed to do it anyway... for what? You care about his free time or his job status? Genuinely? OK.
---
Yeah, you feel like there has to be some immense pressure to turn profits with a plan this insane to just launch out of nowhere.
---
Been calling BS on that one for awhile too.
---
The neon letters and open sign is sold at whitespring for ca 9,8k caps, only place you can get them
---
General assumption from how Todd Howard was talking at e3 18 and just knowing how shity Zenimax can be.
---
Well, that's what I did after reading the IVT XDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD
---
lol removed
---
I dont know if not playing the game will change anything at this point, short of buying atoms or the sub Bethesda doesn't gain anything from us playing the game we have already paid for.
---
I hate, HATE this sub announcement. Unreal! I truly wish no one would pay for it or buy Atoms ever again, which I think would hurt Bethesda far more.
---
I will keep playing the game that I paid for though, until they announce that Wastelanders will only be available to those who pay monthly, which I feel may be coming 🤣
---
Can you get off your soapbox for a minute and realize that you're not going to convince people on how they are going to use *their* money. They've earned it after all, and they will use it on stuff they want to have.
---
Bethesda reminds me of this scene from Aqua Teen Hunger Force. When Frylock gets sick of Master Shake (Bethesda) and moves out. This is Shake trying to entice Frylock to come back:
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cVs4x7aWnAw
---
It's a paid service. But I figured I would try and find out how to cancel the service if anyone is going through buyers remorse.
---
Politicians and game companies ate the same.
---
Both take your hard earned and give not much back in return.
---
Both claim to value your feedback and dutifully ignore it.
---
Both create division in the community.
---
Both have their fans who won't hear a bad word about the objects of their affection. 
---
Both don't give a shit about you until the money dries up.
---
Hahahahahahahahahahahaahahahahahhaahahahhaa
---
Damn you could buy two full newly released games and lunch for that price
---
Take the hint.
---
I've been trying but EA has been flourishing, been boycotting since they ate Westwood!
---
Microsoft is saving you, you should thank them mate
---
Europe. Have you heard of it?
---
Free sounds better, though. *shrug*
---
Screw the outer worlds there's over 1000 games out there that are 100% better than FO76.
---
 Imagine this, in some games bugs are virtually nonexistent!!!! In other games the developers actually care about the community!!!! The world of video games is truly plentiful!!!!
---
I care a lot about private servers. In fact, when I bought the game, they were one of the biggest selling points, because I assumed they'd be implemented like virtually every other game in the genre where I'd be able to host a persistent server from my own hardware -- or at the very least, pay them to host a persistent server for me a la Realms. When the base game turned out to be a massive disappointment, I at least had private servers to look forward to, because playing on a persistent world with my friends could still be a lot of fun, even if the game is flawed. Unfortunately, they botched that too. It's basically the final nail in the coffin for me.
---
Sounds like life is doing them a favor :D
---
Or maybe they jus pretending to want to play this more, when you are the one thats fun, not the game :3
---
Me too!
---
It’s actually a Vault tec elevator. Only reason I knew it was vault 79 was because the button said “Vault 79” and proceeded to do nothing when I clicked it 😂
---
You said it.
---
You don't have to buy ANYTHING.
---
There's no content behind a paywall...
---
I didn't know Bethesda was a poor indie company
---
Nah I the store finally didn't crash buying it now, thanks tho
---
Probably when Outer Worlds comes out this week.
---
I already did.  The more I think about it the more upset I get , I been with them since beta  stood by them , gave them lots of money . But I feel like they just handed me a shit cookie and asked me to pay them so I can eat it . I never thought the servers would be free really , but I been here since the begging and I don’t get a thank you , I have to pay for unlimited storage and what ever else they are going to stick behind the pay wall and let’s be honest with our selfs it’s going to be some cool shit .   No thank you Bethesda !
---
Why would I be offended just because someone else is being stupid, I am amused, or amazed.
---
I'm SO happy with it!!
---
If you're looking for similar stuff gimme a shout bud. Or we'll talk on my server while we farm all the Workshops on the map. Yass.
---
Its a reward for making the excavator PA.  Pretty efficient.  Head to Garrahan headquarters in the Ash Heap and read the poster in the parking lot.  Head inside and finish the quest.  
---
Make sure to stock up on black titanium scrap.
---
The timing of this post is unfortunate because this is such a heartwarming fan creation. Amazing.
---
Bulk items in the new junk stash disappear?
---
Are they selling a recolor of the NCR Armor on the atomic shop for people who don't want 1st or something?
---
Edit: Nevermind, it might just be skins for it, which is even worse for something you're already paying for
---
It’s a mod that shows different resource nodes all over the map.
---
Yep you got it. Not that bad of a deal right?
---
Or maybe the people who don’t think it’s stupid just don’t post because the buttsore will attack them.
---
I didn't know that 20k+ steel/month let you craft infinite items.
---
Are we looking at the same sub? The entire front page is entirely rage posts.
---
Uhhh no. That's changing the goalposts to fit Bethesda. If Bethesda clearly wants to look out for their own interests without giving a flying fuck about my interests, then I'll act in kind. They said, clearly, that there would be no non-cosmetic charges in the game. That means all of this
---
* Fast Travel is now completely free for those with 1st membership.
---
* \+25% bonus in Ammo, Chems, Caps as well as an additional Weapon and/or Plan after the completion of an event.
---
* Access to a 5th special CAMP store. This camp store allows the sale of 50 items, an additional +20 from the others.
---
* Gain an +10% experience bonus from all sources when in a party with other players with 1st membership. (Each additional player stacks, allowing up to +30%)
---
* Items placed inside CAMP displays, no longer contribute to the CAMP's overall budget cost.
---
* Players with 1st membership gain an additional +100% in rewards from Daily and Weekly Challenges.
---
* Players with 1st membership who successfully launch a nuke onto Fissure site Prime, have a chance of spawning a Scorchbeast King to fight alongside the Queen. Prepare yourselves!
---
* Players with 1st membership gain access to an account-wide stash box, allowing players to share and pass items across characters.
---
* As a special thanks for your continued support, a mister gutsy will hand deliver you a variety of random loot once every 24 hours. They will however, be immune to damage, due to the discrimination against robot-kind and the need for humans to kill them simply for random lead and steel scrap.\]
---
Is nonsense. ALL of it is nonsense. I'm sick of them pushing the goalposts a little further every patch. Fuck 'em. I'm going back to their original promise. Until the day Bethesda removes all of the non-cosmetics from the atom store, make private servers free, and remove the subscription LIKE THEY SAID AT LAUNCH WHEN I BOUGHT THE GAME, I will be unsubbing from this subreddit, uninstalling the Bethesda game launcher, unfollowing all bethesda social media, and not buying literally anything that would give Bethesda or Zenimax even a bit of money. Nothing. I'm done. I'll check back a couple times a year to see if they've changed their minds, but I doubt it. Fuck it, I'm out.
---
Fill that bitch up as much as u can. Thats what i Would do
---
Bethesda has f*cked up and they know it.
---
Replace the library slowly either through sales or emulation.
---
The longer they go on console, the worse it feels to replace it all on PC.
---
The enemys themselves are not legendary and they are supposed to be I dont care if i get a drill
---
I can't believe that I paid 60 dollars for this
---
Bless you, for thinking Bethesda would use the money on that.
---
Are you though?
---
I wasn’t talking about the p2w I was talking about “it just works” and “16x the detail”
---
No you don't.  Once you log out it starts a timer to shut down the server.
---
Does it disappear when the month is up or something? Like do I lose all those items?
---
Store on console is down, use their website instead.
---
If you buy a game that never mentioned subscriptions, and had a huge up front price, the standard price for a AAA that many in the industry charge and have multiplayer with game with no subscription... and then later that game tries to charge you a subscription for substation advantages/game-mechanics... you would feel ripped off or jaded.
---
Exactly, which is why it's possible to do without affecting server stability.
---
Rofl point taken, forgive me for being American and assuming you meant USD for some reason
---
How much is a pack of smokes in Australia?
---
Sadly not.
---
The game is like 90% of PvE. There's no win. The monsters always die. And for the small PvP pocket of the game, which is why it's small to begin with, you have to be fully prepared with your perks and gears, or you always lose.
---
Your post was exceptionally good, only one so far Ive seen thats worth upping. All the others about this is just "waah", "waah waah" or "waah pay to win waah".
---
You had logic and reasoning, you can be disagreed with.
---
It's funny that you're trying to talk down to me, honestly.
---
 You're bringing class divisions into a conversation about paid subscriptions in videogames.  Those were your words, that's what's being talked about here. 
---
Maybe go outside some time, there's a whole world out there, outside of evil capitalist videogame companies. You don't have to sit behind your keyboard and cry.
---
From what i heard it only stops u from
---
Adding new junk
---
The “silent majority” aka the apathetic/ignorant masses are why we have lootboxes, pay to win, and all sorts of over-monetization in almost every game now.
---

---
lol.  No option to choose to cancel in the interface?  
---
I wonder if they’ll dox you too
---
No, the format fucked up on reddit is fun. It was showing that you replied to me. Until I refreshed the page.
---
You can ride on something far better in Fallout 4 and other FO games and for free. In fact, you can do a lot more in those games w/o being heavily inconvenienced for the sake of a buck, I mean to get more money outta you.
---
idk how you folks deal w/ not buying the convenience stuff.
---
They are definitely on the bugs so much so that they actually return more often then bugs do in other games.
---
This game sounds like a $60 exercise of yo patience.
---
Also heard enemies can take a while to load and maybe you maybe dead before they properly load in some cases.
---
And they expect you to pay for DLC too? Thats insane. So you have to pay for transactions, the game itself and the DLC. And only thing free is unofficial map? Even GUILD WARS 2 does it better w/ free DLC other than expansions
---
Have to pay for convenience too ontop of all this garbage and you guys are eating it up. You guys are getting the raw end of a deal w/ this buggy steaming pile of shit they call a Fallout game.
---
Ya know, Fallout VR is $17 now and I can get more out of that game for jus $17 than I ever could for this premium shitfest. Now they want $100 ontop of all other things you pay for.
---
Hey! You should share the amazing list to the Filthy Casuals sub too! :) good work captain, amazing.
---
Ok, I get it, you're just a dick.
---
Regardless, they have a point.  Bethesda IS trying to assfuck us into debt.  Not all of us.  The rich whales won't care.  But the majority of us are being setup for a wallet purge.
---
I would think ohh this must be Todd Howard. That mobile app was just as bad of a cash grab as one can get. The fact that people are still playing the game is a bigger  shocker to me. They were price gouging for the Atom shop, why would they not milk the community even more if people have proven to them that they will spend a ton of money. Same thing goes for Anthen. The cataclysm was fun but the game is basically hollow with them reusing the cata as spooky holiday event now. I'm not shocked by anything. Ohh and btw, I have the power armor version of FO76 so I was all aboard for this game and just had to walk away. They got me and it won't happen again.
---
But I love this garbage! 😄
---
How can you love this broken empty game. You do realise there are better games out there with far more content that are free?
---
I thought thats what the internet is for, pointing out the obvious.
---
Miss the old d2 days... good times
---
ELI5.  What the hell happened?
---
How do people defend this...?
---
No response from the Devs? 
---
Wastelanders delayed for P2W items
---
P2W items lead to F2P model...
---
Remember Wastelanders...steam release... F2P.
---
And no more Vendor is really annoying.
---
Absolutely correct.
---
At fallout, yes.
---
Other games let you use private servers for free, Bethesda is definitely not running out of money yet, so I really don't see why they'd do this other then to lose even more of their reputation because of this game (oh, probably to get their money back that they lost from the launch of the game)
---
Bethesda should be included in the list of the most shitty companies of the world.
---
Hahaha, ok kid.  Hundreds of thousands to millions a year for server costs?  Did you just make that up?
---
Oh you know we like it filthy nasty.  Just not quite this filthy nasty.
---
Right now. Just spreading my share of hate for this game before leaving this sub until they go back to their sales pitch: No non-cosmetics. If they do that (doubt it, but I'd be happy to be proven wrong) then I'll start giving Bethesda non-0 dollars.
---
Arent bulked items just meant to be sold?
---
Cant hear you. I have my NCR gear on.
---
This is what's happening (theory):
---
Shareholders weren't happy that F76 didn't meet the quota and Bethesda had to focus on making more cash or pull the plug so they've decided to move most of the wastelanders staff to monetization development (item shop, subscription etc) and other projects unrelated to 76. Sub is their last attempt to revive the game and pay the shareholders and maybe fund wastelanders if there will be anything left. If they'll fail to meet their goal, wastelanders will be canceled or delayed by another year. Basically Anthem.
---
I don’t think it’s greed bub. With all the free shit they’ve put into this game I think they want to make some money off this game.
---
Haha it wouldn’t surprise me honestly.
---
I can see why people are upset about the subscription service and if anything the private servers should not be included in it and available to everyone or the subscription should be cheaper but that is companies for you.
---
Then use the official reddit app. It runs perfectly fine most of the times. And if not then it's all of reddit. 
---
I thought RiF wasn't even worked on anymore?
---
You assumed... that's where you made your mistake.  You made a purchase and raised your expectations based on little more than the idea that at some point and in some form a "private" server would exist.
---
just had the same bug happening to me. wanted to make a post and searched for a similiar post and found this one.
---
Astroturf, that is hilarious man. 
---
This is a completely justified post. They have gone too far.
---
I usually have a few of the mounted plans in my machine. XB GT krazylikeafox
---
Wow, good one. Did you think of that yourself. I mean that is amazing. It is funny because obviously I can read, but, but what you did is take a statement and turned it on me so as to make it look like I am illiterate because I wrote what I did. That is... I mean.. wow, I can’t believe the high level of skill you have. Are there more things like this? Really. Like that is so cool. :)
---
Wow, go to Venezuela, asshole. See how life is there. Or go to North Korea. That works too
---
they heard your complaints about micro transactions and decided instead to make them macro transactions.
---
I hope people don't defend it. It is a watershed moment I feel. To me Bethesda is honest for the first time ever. They made the message clear on what FO76 is.
---
Defending it means you are in denial. Having said that, supporting the decision is another matter. I am ok with the decision since I am a MMO Lite player and FO76 is now a full on MMO Lite game with MTX and subscriptions and paid for QoL items.
---
It just means I can now make an informed choice and if I make my choice it is based on knowing exactly what FO76 is and how it works and how it makes money.
---
Same for people that don't like MMO Lite games. They can now uninstall the game and wait for Fallout 5 or Elder Scrolls 6 to come around later. In the meantime they can play Outer Worlds. Great outcome I think.
---
Thanks.
---
Looks like jumping between NW and Ad mode every hour 😂
---
$15 for a fake currency.
---
I did Campfire Tales alone, loved it
---
#pillowtalk
---
Have you tried clearing your cache and/or doing a hard reset on your PS4?
---
$12.99 definitely is not a good value for an 8 slot server, even counting the other junk you get with it. Its hard to argue even the original $60 price tag is worth it for a buggy early access game like this.
---
Why do you need bulk, it’s unlimited break it down!
---
Hardened mass isn’t a final product, it breaks down to ultracite.  Unless the box stores stingwing barbs etc
---
He's a total dick. Haha
---
K, last word.
---
I like how this sub has gone from despising 4 to looking back on it fondly after seeing this garbage lmao
---
911....I'd like to report a murder.
---
Wouldn't it lock the game when switching the region back?
---
Just grab you a Xbox at the end of next year. Play the exclusives on the PS4 and everything else on the Xbox.
---
ya it is unplayable without mods, which it has none
---
it is horribly empty for the vast majority of space between the areas, most of which are small
---
it has like 4 fun ones
---
no problem tho, you keep hating new vegas :)
---
WoW lured players into buying the game by lying about their post-launch cost structure? Weird. Never heard about that. From what I understood they were very upfront about the subscription and didn't hide it until a year after launch while delaying other more wanted content updates to work on the garbage they're trying to feed us.
---
I kinda don't even want to login and do the Halloween event, ya know? 😕
---
this is INSANELY funny. anyone who buys this is a MORON
---
The only one with a dick in their mouth here is you.
---
"...I realize the burden of proof is on me as I'm the one who asserted it costs that much..."  STOP
---
That's all you need.  Get proof to keep going with your argument or GTFO of here with that garbage.
---
if capitalism is paying £60 for a game and another £150 a year to play it, im a filthy commie
---
Well you're throwing insults out so I can't think of any other reason to do that other than some misguided anger or offense.
---
Are you OK with Bethesda continually breaking its word on a product yet you bought?  Are you OK with buying a product, and then finding out that when you open it up and start using it, that who made the product  did things to inconvenience you with "atmosphere" as the excuse, but then let people pay more to ignore that "feature" of the game?
---
Not too shabby! May do a month or two when wastelanders drops :)
---
If you keep supporting these giant corporations, they will keep fucking us. Exactly.
---
I'll reply to your post here
---
I got the subscription and have been on a private world for most of the evening. A handful of my friends showed up without me inviting them which was a surprise but not unwelcome. It's quiet. I could spend a whole damn day building at workshops in peace which sounds really great to me. No one trying to PvP me, so no headache explaining to them that I'm not really a pvper and just wanna build. Having 8 people is kinda cool but I'd love 16 or 24 slots or something. The atomic stuff is cool, I never really liked the ranger helmet in New Vegas but the duster is decent. Just like in New Vegas, it flares out at the knees and I feel like marylin monroe. Theres new emotes, ones a mothman dance which is weird and hilarious and the other one makes your character do the robot. To me, that's worth the £13 already. The scrap box has given me about 300 lbs of stash space which is cool. It doesn't accept bulk items or hardened mass but whatever to that, it's fine. The survival tent is pretty cool and fairly useful I suppose. 
---
Overall I don't regret paying, it's about as much as I spend on Netflix or something and I play 76 more than I use Netflix. I don't feel like I have any notable advantage over players who haven't paid the subscription. The only thing would be the infinite crafting stuff but at level 250+ that's not really an issue anymore anyways. 
---
Getting 1650 atoms per month is gonna be a big plus. 
---
It's fine and you can spend your money how you want. If you don't pay for this, youre in the same position as before which is fine.
---
yeah the fact that it isn’t 24 is absurd
---
I know and to think no bethesda wouldn't do this is absurd they have literally slowly introduced as much micro transactions as possible of course they were gonna do this im not shocked at all the tell signs were blatantly obvious.
---
You don't need to buy a subscription to play fallout 76.
---
And just like in the real world if you want something for free all you have to do is REALLY beg for it.
---
Agreed, but cursing, threatening boycotts and calling people names isn't going to do anything. If you don't like what they produce, don't buy it. That's what I do.
---
I have no plans to get a subscription either, but not because I feel it's an immoral cash grab. It's because the subscription doesn't offer anything I'm interested in for that price.  $5 / month - Yeah, I'd sign up for that. $17 / month. Nah, pass.
---
Don’t forget the fridge and collectron. But don’t you know the only people who complain about this are poor or entitled people? /s
---
Right? Give us one this week!
---
no.
---
Yeah. They didn't stay logged out for long enough for the timer to finish
---
You can't argue with stupid I guess. So, having more space than non-premium people isn't an advantage? I wonder why they marketed it then.
---
* Some bullshit scrapbox that will make dupers insanely happy.
---
* About $16 worth of Atoms each month to spend on dumb cosmetics.
---
* A second free spawn/fast travel point because clearly 76 and your camp aren't enough and making caps for fast travel is hard, apparently.
---
All of these are what I like to call "placebo value". Nobody actually wants them (or they should be free) but they just add more bullet points to the sales pitch.
---
They stay on only if they’re monthly subscribers as well. Which in all my years of server renting is unheard of.
---
Best comparison ever.
---
I don't disagree. The illusion of power still stands true in this form too.
---
I've played over 1000 hours of new vegas.
---
I'm more than qualified to talk about that game's shortcomings. Never said I hated it.
---
&gt;it is horribly empty for the vast majority of space between the areas, most of which are small
---
Not even true.
---
&gt;it has like 4 fun ones
---
"These 100+ events dont count because I personally dont like them, even though I just said fallout 76 and new vegas both ahd 8 random events in total and I got proven wrong so I'm moving the goalposts"
---
But it was/is utter trash. That doesn't mean you can't still play it and enjoy it. Also nothing wrong about telling people which parts of the game you like. But at no point was it a defendable product.
---
Slim to none
---
best post right here, really.
---
This is a trend with all fallout games, but 76 while fun with top notch exploration and lore is kinda below average right now
---
I've only checked Sunny Top and Whitesprings, but there's no scrap boxes as far as I can tell. That said, there's one in the survival tent, so you can drop it anywhere if you need to lighten your scrap load.
---
Nah ill stick to the app. I'm not going to ditch it because of  rarity format issue, when it's fixed so easily by a refresh. 
---
Yes it is still updated.
---
Not to defend the way it's packaged but you are buying more server resources with your $15/month so they would just be dedicating those resources to you in the public realm as well. I can see why but it feels sour in my mouth.
---
But what's it matter since you uninstalled in February before they started adding in content?
---
Well if you go by r/Fallout any game other than NV or the originals is trash.
---
The only thing that has fucked me this hard before is the Army .-.
---
Outer Worlds boiiiii so hyped. Bad time to release this update.
---
ES6 will absolutely have in app purchases (creation club)
---
As where I am concerned, yes. Every event os far had multiple possible explanations, there was a place for benefit of a doubt. Now with the subscription, I can't see any other explanation except for greed or desperation.
---
That being said, I can uderstand why some people still have goodwill left or simply don't care. The core of the game is nice and fun. It's just that some people don't mind being treated like second-class players. Or have the money to pay up without any dent in their bank account. I don't think it's fair to jump at their throats with "sunk cost fallacy" or "stockholm syndrome" bullcraps...
---
I would of payed for the servers only if they cost no more then 60 a year , I hate that they have items locked behind it sucks for people who don’t want the servers or maybe can’t afford the server
---
Good point thanks for reminding me my guy
---
I never do that for Bethesda's big failure.i have a nice games like outer worlds on my console
---
They’ll be back before wastelanders comes out if the time estimates I’m seeing in the reviews are to be believed.  Hopefully the side quest stuff adds quite a bit more to do.
---
And that is exactly the manipulation they are shooting for. Smoke and mirrors. "Oh hey, Timmy, look. The membership is less than the equal number of atoms." But who said we're buying atoms in the first place? Anyone that buys into this shit is a sucker with no self respect.
---
Hopefully the online Markets won't use 556 ammo as an alternative currency. We can basically print money, that way. This is a good thing. Hardcore mules and traders will fall. Honest sellers, helpers and crafters should flourish more.
---
can confirm that... we where on teamspeak as it happend.
---
I was wondering who would still shill for this game. Congrats man enjoy your $60 dollar game with a mobile game mindset.
---
This has to be the most accurate description I’ve seen yet, and I’ve seen quite a bit of outrage/defense today. 
---
You’ve hit the nail on the head. The real outrage is that the Fallout with friends category of people outnumbers the MMOs (at least in ferocity), and they’re just now finding out/Bethesda is just now coming clean on what it truly is.
---
Let's not get it twisted. Bethesda isn't providing a private server in the same sense a game server company would.
---
These are not dedicated servers. These are instances that are only available when the owner is online OR if someone who also has a sub is still online on that instance. I wouldn't be surprised if your own console/pc is really doing the hosting but that is total speculation.
---
To boot, you can't customize the server at all like you could a dedicated server. 
---
So take all that into account when comparing costs with game server companies.
---
I quit and rejoined my server earlier to see if the Hemlock Grafton monster would respawn. It didn’t. But I still had the munitions factory claimed.
---
We should get our money back for the game ! Change everyone’s mind !
---
Where were you the day Bethesda died?
---
I didn't realize the refrigerator only allowed 15 single stacked items total.  Not really worth the price.  I'm disappointed, but the 700 points are gone now.
---
Not steel,  Tungsten. 
---
They are much harder and heavier than steel.
---
yokes
---
You mean kind of like MANY other online games? I cant even play GTA online with friends unless we are in a private server because getting in random gunfights with every rand isn't any fun. But they have had it in their GTA and Red Dead online modes since GTA 4
---
Unlimited scrap stash for subscription players is bs
---
Fair enough
---
It's a good deal as far as comparing it to other server rental deals. 
---
The people who complain about are really trying to stretch out how much of an advantage unlimited junk storage is (lol. Junk.), and want things that were never part of their original purchase agreement.
---
Well it's less effort than foreplay and either way we're getting fucked.
---
The cost of the PSN is fair and well worth it. What Bethesda is trying to pull is fucking ridiculous and only morons are OK with it.
---
Yeah it’s not mandatory to pay the subscription and gameplay will still be the same as it’s always been for those who don’t. I don’t see the problem.
---
Just scrap them and store the scraps?
---
Correction *Bought* Wonder Woman
---
He made a lot of money from what he was banned for life from banking
---
Ha I already have it. Picked it up for the dollar. My step dad uses it too and I've been trying to convince him to get it since I pay for BOTH our Xbox live + game pass essentially. This is just a win all around.
---
Ahaha thanks
---
It works for Xbox Console Game Pass downloads only, I'm gonna be happy if it works tomorrow.
---
100$ a year and I don't get free light wood laminate? This game is going downhill fast.
---
Ha, 2/3 from my now online friends are on a privat server. The idiocrazy is real
---
Mine stopped too
---
I agree. This isn’t a bathesda issue as much as it is a “Fallout 76 flopped but we just don’t want to be in the negative” issue. I’m sure they’re fully aware that if ES:6 releases (assuming its quality is closer to Skyrim than FO76) and they pulled this shit, bathesda might as well close up shop.
---
I'm not being swindled, I see the value I'm getting. Sure I can get better deals in other games, but those aren't fallout 76. I enjoy fallout 76 enough to consider getting this subscription
---
Money is one hell of an  **Aphrodisiac.**
---
Man you just don't get it, and will not get it.
---
Oh it can bubble up later.
---
You’re right I can just attempt to launch my first nuke for the 18th time hoping the servers of this game don’t crash yet again as I make it halfway through a bunker. In the meantime we’re getting a subscription service!!! So cool!!!
---
Ok gotcha thanks for the heads up man
---
TELL ME LIES TELL ME SWEET LITTLE LIES
---
Imagine it being your intellectual property.
---
Thanks. Glad you thought it was funny.
---
Yea it's like they got us by the balls. Which is a terrible dilemma for us fans.
---
No cause it’s not the Fallout universe.
---
You get a huge contiguous world to explore with your friends.  As a fan of the franchise I get to do all the things, questing, looting, fighting, building, crafting, fooling around from all the precious games but with my gaming friends!  Then there are the social aspects that are all new to the franchise - player to player vending, PvP (such as it is), and large group events, both normal, and seasonal.
---
What did you expect from this game?
---
Don’t worry they will charge you for a 25% budget increase.
---
Yeah I’ve broken free of the “survival” aspect. That’s why I get bored.
---
Neither do I. I disagree with the scrap box but don’t see an issue with it affecting my gameplay
---
Imagine how smug Todd is gonna be at the *next* e3.
---
You're the first person I've heard say anything about actually using one. How is it they don't work properly? Are they as buggy as public servers? Or worse?
---
Thank you for making me choke my coffee.
---
How is supporting capitalism anti-consumer. 
---
Consumers pay money, fostering development and growth.  
---
If you do not pay, you are not a consumer, you are a freeloader.
---
How would any of us know how it works for bethesda specifically unless we worked for bethesda?
---
&gt;They didn't use any of Skyrim's sales to improve that game
---
But they did use it to PAY THEIR EMPLOYEES to make DLC for the fucking game.
---
It's like you have no fucking idea how companies work. Like you think programmers work for free.
---
I’m happy scotch East’s are legendary now
---
Awesome, thank you for the quick reply!
---
Wha... I just fucking bought it and I have game pass...
---
"You all wanted this". Seriously, Bethesda is like the Monkey's Paw of game developers.
---
A false argument to begin with.  You're not paying $12.99 for storage, you're paying for at least $15 worth of in game currency, access to the private servers, access to the second fast travel point, the NCR outfit, exclusive sales in the atom shop AND uncapped scrap storage.
---
rekt
---
Can you add any Camp items at all to the space? I'm gonna jump on, you Xbox by chance?
---
This is an incredibly inappropriate direction for the game and anyone who buys First is enabling a huge problem with Fallout 76.
---
low IQ circlejerk.
---
At this point I finally agree, this half thrown together game is still somehow charging more for QOL improvements
---
Never forget the horse armor in Oblivion
---
Im enjoying this tbh. The people on this subreddit blindly defending this game finally got what they deserve for mindlessly buying into clear malicious business practices.
---
Actions have consequences. Enjoy!
---
Define "Anti-consumer"?
---
good looking out.  I will keep this in mind when I get home from the office later.
---
Right. Next they will charge you for each 10% budget increase. Like a phone bill on data. Rolling charges if you go over 💁
---
Not to pay extra? Are you nuts? What about the MONETIZATIONSSSSSS?!
---
If it's during a break, then it's not "at work" (as I understood). But I see plenty of people using work time to do their personal things. What else is it than stealing? You can always do some other work, if there is no customers etc.
---
I've heard people complaing that they got fired for browsing Facebook etc. while at work. How can you complain? It is a breach of contract. You sold your time. But are using it to do something else.
---
I use breaks to eat, go to WC etc. I don't even have a smartphone. My phone is shut down when I am at work. Or left at home. Sometimes I don't even open my phone for weeks.
---
Idk, but the change is terribly obvious.
---
Anything cosmetic will stay. The ranger outfit, emotes, and player icons are yours to keep, as well as the atoms they issue you each month. You will lose access to the tent, scrap box, and private worlds.
---
I’m SO glad I switched over to World of Warcraft lol
---
&gt; You deserve better than being manipulated into spending money on a sub par game
---
Or, you know,perhaps the OP actually enjoys the game, like the silent majority of players, and doesn't run into the glitches that the min/max crowd does. How the OP spends his entertainment money isn't really up to you. Hell, the price is still cheaper than one ticket to yet another regurgitated "blockbuster " from Hollyweird
---
Imagine running your own intellectual property to the ground.
---
Yep, Fallout 76 is surely not the game where they could afford implementing this kind of a subscription. Hope this would affect the daily online of the game. We really should boycott this ripoff.
---
"Starting at 12:00 p.m. EDT on October 29 until 12:00 p.m. EST on November 5"

---
Tell me which one this fits under?  To me it doesn't seem like a season pass or a DLC.
---
There's no stuff to have.  I've been *waiting* for private servers.
---
But the all new Offline Mode Pack!
---
It includes:
---
-The ability to go offline!
---
-More emotes to show you’re logging off!
---
-A entire fucking collection of fallout 5-75!
---
Buy for only $299.99 annually!
---
Duping. More storage space for weapons.
---
So you don't play *any* games unless they're Fallout games?
---
I get that, Some of my friends have uninstalled it and are waiting for either servers to be free or the wastelander’s update to come out but me personally I love the game.
---
I didn’t really see much of a problem with the subscription aside from the scrap box and servers because I usually do spend roughly the same amount on atoms anyway so I might as well get a tent, outfit and emotes at the same time.
---
But as far as the scrap box goes I do think it gives an unfair advantage in some ways simply because I have cleared at least 300 weight out of the storage box.
---
I'll check out wastelanders but my expectations have been dramatically reduced when I inevitably discover it's awful I'll drop every item in my inventory at whitesprings and will most likely never play this game again, I agree it's sad it could've been great
---
For pubes to grow?
---
Can’t you read? See, I learned from you what you did. See, you tried something then I said the same as you. This guy here. What he did was go to my post where I answered a question with “I am not an expert...” then he asked if I could read, because I basically said I was not sure about the new boxes.Then... he comes to another post and asks a stupid question that he could have looked up but did not... and it is about the new boxes...
---
If it’s on the atomic shop it’s earnable in game, just do challenges and achievements until you have the atoms you need. I agree with a lot of stuff said about the game but that’s weak.
---
There is some mention about the vault it in the files they added in the patch. Its a main Quest in wastelanders (think its the fifth quest) by the name "Treasure Hunt" . You have to go around the world and pick up holotapes or notes from people before the war one of which is Sam Blackwell to get in the vault.
---
Congrats Bethesda. Long time Fallout fan. I am now uninstalling, unsubbing from here and will not be buying the next fallout as much as it hurts me to say. Good bye all.
---
Meh. The scrapbox falls pretty in line with the usefulness of the other convenience items. 
---
Junk isn't rare. Or hard to come by. Most players have more than they need. It will for some free up a small amount of stash space ... That's it.
---
I mean, I have more junk than I'll ever need. And free stash space so I could care less.
---
Falls under "all our content".
---
You're a whale and an enabler and you're ok with it. Go ahead.
---
"Amazing game" Right... :D
---
\*Applauses\* You stand up against tiranny.
---
Horse armor??
---
I pay $12.99 a month for Final Fantasy 14. An MMO. They did 3 unique events this month, have a major content patch coming at the end of the month. Just came out with a major expansion. I play on a server with thousands. 
---
Fo76 has what exactly compared to that? Insanity.
---
you are not paying for a server, you are paying for a instance.
---
Todd here everybody, no.
---
You lose the stash box once you quick the subscription
---
I think one thing that's devaluing for all players is this idea of paid private servers in a game that relies on public events, and having enough of a population to make it worthwhile for players to do them. This subscription service will only serve to further fragment the player-base, and, as we've already seen, has really triggered quite a few people who were holding out hope for Fallout 76 (myself included). 
---
I mean, the whole premise behind this game is enjoying a Fallout game in an online environment WITH your friends and others. It's truly baffling that they'd continue to dig this metaphorical hole of theirs with more microtransactions, adding pay-walls for content and certain updates, and injecting new features into an already un-polished online game that divides the community on not just a ethical level but a practical/gameplay-level as well.
---
Queens and nukes have always been things the game doesn't always like.
---
He might be better then our current president though. Todd knows how’s to bend people over.
---
Seriously do I need to actually explain why them saying non-cosmetics will be free then charging for this is wrong? Or do you actually sub to r/HailCorporate and cheer for the shills
---
Yes. This premium subsription mainly benefits very active PvE players who would stuggle to keep up all the junk you can amass. And there's little winning there because the enemies all die anyway. And there's no real advantages into PvP, unless you count some raiders who can now take all the junk they could ever see from their kills.
---
It's even much more subpar that most people who are complaining realize.
---
Bethesda could have brought a really major and important feature along with that unlimited scrap. Transfer box of about 80 lbs to allow easily and 100% safely transfer stuff between chars. 
---
It that would have been in, there's good chance I would have become "first".
---
That will be another $100 ty
---
hell yeah
---
I didn’t pay $100 but I did get the $13. Because the game makes me happy and I wanted to.
---
Lol.
---
Corporations are legally obligated to their share holders. Not consumers. 
---
For you to think that a corp would put consumers first is hilarious. Thanks America.
---
I'm entirely convinced they're doing private servers in this manner in order to try to bring back the paid mods idea.  Seems like the next logical step for them to take.
---
Too much stuff. Can't do it lol
---
I agree completely I hate what they have done I dont own the game but every time I nearly cave to buy it this shit happens sorry if my post seemed sarcastic I'm just shocked at how they are treating their player base
---
I don't think they'll charge extra for it tbh, I think it's more likely they will use it as bait to try to get people into the sub/back into the sub at a future date.
---
The outfit is amazing!
---
I might just buy it for the outfit and 1600 atoms
---
No! this game should NEVER have a subscription. NEVER. Subscription has no place in this game. Now they will design all the content to force you into subscription (new crafting ingredients to fill up your bank etc).
---
No but will be playing MW tomorrow
---
Same, seems like the perfect oil to throw on the hate fire but the subscription doesnt affect me. I dont really need, want, or feel like i automatically deserve all the things that are being provided on the subscription. Its not like theyre saying I cant play the base game without paying more.
---
It literally does.
---
Thats when the bar suggestion comes handy.
---
If Bethesda sold the rights to Fallout I would be ecstatic
---
Hell yeah that small percentage of people love dropping more money towards an unfinished bug-engulfed dumpster fire.
---
all the money they make of this sub is gonna make all the free content that much sweeter. You won't be whining in a few months or you will. either way I don't care- me and all the rest of the fan goons will be chilling in the wasteland with our miles of stash space haha
---
The subscribers will get their year of content (it’s so basic / minimum that’s a safe bet). But you’re right, they are cashing out on the players that are still there, who will buy this in anticipation of the “big update”. They aren’t going to finish it, they will announce its cancellation or drastic decrease in content once subscription sales stagnate.
---
Umm, how do you “de-bulk”?
---
I was killing 100 scorched a day so I'm sure the player average for a week was much higher than 100. Probably 3x that which would mean that the total amount not active players is only 100k-150k.
---
This game is in trouble.
---
Unobtainium!
---
Why do you think the industry is the way that it is? It will get worse, a lot worse.
---
spoken like a true snake oil salesman. games-as-a-service are not products, they're promises. they're selling you the promise that one day, eventually, maybe, the game won't suck. or maybe not, who knows. they could just drop it in favor of the new TES or SF. and then you're left with a broken mess and 60$ + 100$ short.
---
that's one. the other is selling a feature which already exists and is readily available, that being private servers, for cash, when they could just release the server files and let us hosts them ourselves. that's what people wanted from the beginning, not a premium subscription.
---
there's another- blatant PR speak. these are not private servers, they're premium subscriptions. they're not listening to feedback either, it all goes straight into the bin. "convenience items are the most popular category in the shop" yeah, right. because it takes 3 minutes to skin a box in photoshop and call it a repair kit but weeks to create a decent-looking PA skin.
---
you've been sucked so deep into the hole you assume these things to be perfectly normal. and like I said, more power to you. but facts are facts. you're being played for a sucker. proof is that entire countries are banding together to look into lootboxes, oh, sorry, "**surprise mechanics**".
---
When I clicked "scrap and stash" it didn't even put the bulk stuff I had into the box. It also doesn't let you deposit stuff like hardened mass and death claw hands.
---
I have had this issue. I think it's vsync related.  iPresentInterval=0 causes it for me
---
YouTube that gunplay. now that game is trash
---
I preordered the game. This was the first instance I’ve seen a game drop 50% in the first month. What does income have to do with it? The richest people in the world don’t like losing a penny. I don’t like losing 30 dollars for no reason lol.
---
And the private servers.
---
I bought it because everyone on this sub is going insane and trying to force other people to boycott or not buy it for some odd reason. When people try to force me into something and start calling me a dipshit and a moron because I like spending my money on things I like, I generally do exactly what they are trying to stop me from doing.
---
When you hit them in the pocket book, they do make decisions that are better for the community. It's happened time and time again. It's on record.
---
Stop blaming America for your ignorance.
---
I mean, it is not paid DLC and season pass...
---
It is just 100 DOLLARS of Subscription! 
---
Totally not breaking any promises!
---
Clearly. Which is why it's one of the most popular MMOs at the moment I suppose. Because they fucked it up.
---
Think your confused your not paying for a server... You paying to access a game mode called Private Worlds... Its just a private invite only instance not a server, so its only active when your online and click the mode and create the instance and its a new instance each time you start it with only some things like camp location persisting, it works the same way GTA V Online invite only mode does except you have to pay for it.
---
Put a little more English on it...
---
Or for five bucks a month including 100 other games like forza horizon 4, gears 5, outer worlds, Batman Arkham games, crackdown 3, ton of others.
---
Game pass is by far one of the best subscription services out there, especially since they combined it with Xbox live and Xbox game pass on the pc.. love it
---
I think you miss judge their greed. 
---
Example a:) Sub
---
I got a feeling that someone at Bethesda is gonna get fired real fast
---
Because player weight can be different to container weight because of perks
---
If you were gonna be buying atoms anyway you’d save some money with some added features for a month.
---
They’re getting the last of the money before cancelling Wastelanders
---
The deathblow was the game being released. Still bleeding players out though.
---
OMG. What is Pete Hines saying now?
---
I get the feeling that they want to can this whole game, but not outright. They need a way to dwindle the player base down to nothing
---
It's sad but you're right. They probably budgeted this thing to tank and more as R&amp;D for ES6
---
Kapow. Enough of this, you seem like a cool c*nt, can we get on rather than argue?
---
I'm glad you're still enjoying the game, I wish I was still hooked to the game as you are. I have no reason to waste my time on that game anymore, maybe I'll see what wastelanders can offer but I'm sceptical.
---
Just came to check if there would be any cool stuff for the 1 year anniversary that would get me back on this game and all I see is this crap. 
---
It’s a pity, have been hoping for months new stuff would get me excited again but let’s all just admit this isn’t worth fighting for anymore. Plenty of other games out there for all us to explore.
---
I heard you only lose access to depositing not withdrawing materials
---
Dude I was so pissed when I found the beta was only in windows. Half of the times I wasn’t even able to play, and when I could the game was so shitty I was wondering why I even paid for this. I didn’t like fo4 already so fo76 was my last chance before I gave up. I can’t believe they went from fo3 to this.
---
I bought 1 month so I can get the outfit and atoms. Gonna be able to scrap everything I find now and store it indefinitely for the future. This is nice.
---
What? I'm confused. Where did I lie?
---
Outer Worlds comes out Friday...
---
I’m paying for a private server, NOT a private “instance”
---
And Origin, and Bullfrog, and Pandemic, and Maxis and Visceral...
---
I'm going to undercut everyone and just sell everything for $5. I'm sure people will buy Leather Coat, Tattered field jacket, Mr Fuzzy costume, ect for 5$ a piece
---
I'm in various subreddits. Currently I'm taking to you tho. And I'm not painting anything, I replying to your shitty comment. I don't care what you do and what kind of person you are. I give a shit about gaming tho. And people who think like you are the reason companies get away with their bullshit.
---
Yeah, I am still kind of figuring out about this. I kind of like the idea of having a bunch of stuff to refill my supply for selling. Let me know if you figure that it new stuff.
---
When I first heard ''multiplayer'' and ''Always online'' bullshit, I KNEW the terrible possibilities it would bring. 
---
Well, I am glad I avoided this trainwreck.
---
Yikes my friend, yikes.
---
Dying light 2 is coming out in a few months, and the story is developed by one of the og fallout devs
---
Fallout is not really about shooting things, nor is the outer worlds
---
If you think Wastelanders is ever coming out you’re going to be disappointed. This is Bethesda cashing in on the audience before doing an action that will kill the game.
---
$100 subscription suggests 'not much'.
---
I wish ps4 had something like this lol
---
It's really sad.
---
You do realise they could just let the users download the server, let the people host LAN servers and there would be zero cost to them?
---
They've only made 'private instances' a thing to profit off them. Nothing else. They are literally doing this for profit.
---
Agreed. I wouldn't pay either. I'm quite frustrated w this company. They're obviously not listening now.
---
I’m convinced they’re desperately price gouging where they can to fund the developement of es6
---
What time is the unlock time based on the NZ time?
---
Same here
---
I really hope that not all of them purchased fallout 1st and just joined someone’s server. But still quite sad to see that this crap is getting purchased
---
Scrap
---
Bye, still playing
---
You're disconnected from the world as much as Bethesda is with the community.
---
My precious... tea?
---
Nah, let Bethesda see this tsunami of hatred and anger. A single thread will absolutely be ignored
---
You asked for it, Bethesda delivered in it's way.
---
They have no power over the consumers if they don’t offer them what they want.  This won’t help them or these shadowy share holders if it’s not what the players want!
---
Sounds like a company that wont work on issues it has or other content but wants you to pay for minor features we wanted. 
---
Fallout 4: collect and store whatever you wanted. Fallout 76, can only hold so much, no extra weapons. No other cool armor, no stockpile of meds. Or junk. Only a set total amount that is easily filled. But hey, pay 100 a year to have 1 of the 4 things I said above not count towards space....
---
Hey you like fallout stuff? Heres more skins. Ones ppl would want but only available at the same cost of tv subscriptions...
---
That is why we are upset. While things are still broke, this comes out. I still need to have mules for characters because I cant store all my things. Makes selling shit a pain in the ass.
---
i said this shit as soon as i started playing. the game needs too much work and that terrible item shop sure as hell wasnt going to do anything but keep the lights on. a game like this, needs subscription level income to pump out more content. personally, im in. ive never played a game like this and i would genuinely love it if they could afford ot hire some talent and rig up some new content. similar to how bungie created their last expansion for destiny 1.
---
I'm sorry that some people have disposable income, and also enjoy this game (but I don't so I won't be buying it)
---
Welcome to capitalism. Companies support people who give them money. You can't seriously be surprised that this is the case. The model they tried to promise at the beginning was not a sustainable model. Which they've discovered. I would have *far* rather they introduced a subscription like this earlier and even paid expansions than introducing utility items to the Atom shop. But here we are.
---
I'm waiting for Bethesda to respond with, "That's only a quarter a day! Can you really not afford to give up a Starbucks coffee every two weeks?!"
---
That's literally what I hear from every subscription based service that's way overpriced.
---
This sub has 200k subscribers. If only half of them bought a decent number of items that's good enough. Thenm think about how many people played the game but dont get on Reddit. A fucking ton. I guarantee Bethesda still somehow made money off this. A whole lot of it
---
You do know you can get improved repair kits from game content right?
---
The takeaway from this is that upvotes and downvotes are pretty meaningless. They say nothing as to the quality of the post or how factual or insightful it is.
---
I'll buy that $100 subscription, but only if they unpatch the dupe glitch so I can at least make my money back on eBay, Gameflip or whatever site the duppers use nowadays.
---
Unless Outter World sells so well.
---
I think its due to the investors, who asked for more money to Bethesda, and so Bethesda was forced to follow and to make some of the dumbest decisions they had ever made.
---
Open up the game for the modding community and we are going to fix all of your problems for you bugthesda :))
---
Where's the Bethesda/Fallout reps out?
---
I want to see if we can surpass the Battlefront II comment for most downvoted.
---
well, technically they only added a subscription, not a paid dlc or season pass... right?!? :P
---
For all the fanbois:  What if they started doing bugfix patches but they would be given to Premium Subscription players first for 6 months before all the "free" players got them.  All the same arguments apply:  "it's not that much money" / "how else do you expect them to pay the people that fix the bugs"
---
Think about this for a second.
---
Here’s an idea, stop sucking at being a consumer
---
Exactly because gamers (some) support this model.
---
No dude not at all! I can’t keep enough junk in my box to do all my crafting and repairing I end up dropping junk all the time. And fuck a junk mule
---
If you purchase Bethesda’s private server service for $13/month or $100/year you get the NCR Ranger armor from New Vegas.
---
Yeah... I was a stalwart defender of the game until this point. I spend a ton of my time balancing my stash inventory.  We were promised they'd never sell in game advantages, but here we are.  Honestly I'd get a refund if one were available.
---
The most popular fallout is definitely 4, judging by sales
---
Guys, we need to stop bashing on them and call an ambulance. The 76 team has clearly been suffering from severe and ongoing strokes if they thought announcing paying $100 a year for a game their most loyal fans already paid $60 for the same week the gaming press is being flooded with articles about "Fallout in space" was a good idea.
---
I'm really worried about them.
---
Would have sold better (on PC) without epic exclusivity
---
Ye
---
I haven't played this game since launch, but are the actually putting micro transactions behind a pay wall behind a subscription behind a full price (not that it goes for full price anymore) game?
---
The update actually has a lot of great stuff in it including legendary scorch beasts, which is very much welcome.
---
100/year U.S. 
---
Not everyone lives in the U.S.
---
And everyone is like it's a great deal yada yada.
---
It's not. You're effectively buying the same game every year. 
---
Imagine doing that. You'd have to be a fucking moron.
---
i NEED xbox gold for this game
---
&gt; This is a video game. 
---
This may be more true than we realize. I've spent the whole evening being angry and feeling betrayed. I went been to the gym, was still distracted and excercised a bit too much. Now I feel sore and don't know what will happen. It's just a game and the fun, engaging world hasn't gone away. I may come back. I may. On the other hand, I cannot forgive Bethesda for pulling this up.
---
I've always made distinction between company and their products. I love Borderlands, but I don't like Gearbox. I'm lukewarm towards Witcher 3, but I hate CDPR. I don't like EA, but I'm looking forward to C&amp;C Remaster. So it's possible for me to return to Fo76 despite how I feel now. I may even become a Fo76 fan again after Wastelanders, but it will need another great game for me to become Bethesda fan again...
---
Make support tickets also. Make a template and pass it around the for others
---
Lol yup although rather buy weapon armor if ya had it, still making few bucks
---
Yes, they go “people are buying this stuff, what else can we sell?”
---
Notice some of the highlighted perks are exclusive skins and emotes. They want it to appeal to everyone - the “I want to play with just my friends” crowd, the “storage is a pain in the fucking ass” crowd, and the “I buy cosmetics” crowd. It’s just the final dump they are taking on the people they’ve milked up til now.
---
The entire goal of these live service games is to siphon money. You realize this subscription is bullshit but they’ve already sank you for a lot of money for a broken Fallout game that doesn’t have NPCs.
---
A broken Fallout game that doesn’t have NPCs. How much money did you pay for a broken Fallout game that doesn’t have NPCs? That number is the whole point of the game, of releasing it with minimal development costs, of loading the shops, of promising the game will be finished one day. To get you to spend as much money as they can before they can the project.
---
What system are you on? That’s not normal (clearly as people lunch nukes all the time).
---
I'm on PSN cant figure it out
---
Not even a real server that's rented, just a virtual "instance" that disappears when you go offline.
---
My guy, my reddit shitposts don't show shit about the way I think. My comments might but only partly. And again, if I could do anything, i would, I've got ms and my medication costs about 5000€ a month and I'm fucking lucky to live in a country with a sensible healthcare system. If posting shit about it on reddit would change something about that, I'd fucking do it 24/7 but it won't. But as stated previously, we did change the decision making of a publisher, so we can do it again. This might actually be the only thing left we can directly influence without raging literal war against corporate.
---
I haven't kept up with FO76 lately...
---
Holy fuck so I got the white Xbox One X FO76 beta bundle awhile back and this is what the game's turned into? Bruh
---
Do you know what "content" is? Everything what game *contents —* counts as *content*.
---
&gt;Maybe they have fucked the game completely
---
But Fallout 1st is already official. It's not a maybe.
---
Gotcha. That's too much work
---
You mean the survival tent? No, you can't build or rearrange anything in it. You deploy it by opening the quick wheel and hitting Y (on xbox).  The footprint is only 2x2, so it's easy to find somewhere to put it. Since there's no competition for workshops you can just claim one and build any other workbenches or whatever you might need.
---
Also, I am on xbox, but I have to log off soon to go run some errands. My GT is the same as my reddit name. Shoot me your GT and I'll send you an invite if I can get on later tonight.
---
Hey, is it possible to play this game solo/offline?
---
and you're an idiot, but we still ended up here. It takes nothing for them to store junk and subs let them continue updating the game. It is in no way required to play as well.
---
At best it is pay for convenience. Also I was not the one that brought up budgets, my intent was to inform you of mine since you were concerned, if you came away feeling bad or the impression I was out to make others feel bad it was not.   
---
I will admit the collectron and the fridge was a miff for me, however atoms are quite easy to earn to pay for those. It is kind of the whole how do we keep people playing and involved. Yeah Hines is full of shit obviously on the atom shop only being cosmetic and for that he should be called out daily. And yeah the scrap box is a huge deal I cleared out 500-600 weight from my regular stash. On a positive though it does not allow junk or bulk junk in it. Still it is massively convenient and should have been brought to everyone as the fix all for stash.
---
You need Xbox gold to play any game online lol.
---
Another person had asked this, but I still haven't found the need to find out!! I'm sure I'll try it sometime but I've been so busy enjoying everything there's been no need! Once we've exhausted maybe all the plastic or lead I'll check. Right now I'm going to another event lol
---
You'll buy it
---
Yeah I don't think this affects the average casual player. I just came back from a six month break and I'm loving it again. This is a disappointing decision to see, but overall it doesn't affect how I play the game.
---
All that being said, it would be great to see them prioritize game and server stability instead of adding features. I'll take not crashing once an hour over new content any day.
---
MMO's have been doing it since the 90's. I don't understand what exactly is the problem here, I know it can be abused like everything in the marketplace, but there is nothing inherently wrong with microtransactions and "games as service" whatever that means. Then again when the first thing I see when I write Anti-Consumer is the smug mug of political hacktavist Steven Chowder, I get suspicious.
---
First time that a gaming company has offered a paid subscription to a game before the game was finished.
---
This is a total game changer in video game development if Bethesda is successful. Selling a subscription to a game with no content could only happen in the times we live in. Has the federal reserve printed so much money that we are now literally paying for nothing?
---
No, just evil.
---
It's amazing how many posts have been made with different mentions of positive things other companies do that Bethesda could have done, and yet they missed every single one of them.
---
“BuT tHiS fAlLoUt Is MeNt To Be PlAyEd WiTh FrIeNdS”
---
Which is like 40% cheaper and much more reliable with more people
---
I thought that, and definitely no. Everything is better thought than F076 even micro transactions. 3 bad things : camp spawning bug, animal spawning bug, pvp is broken for now due to tonics and new perks. But this frustration is strictly nothing compared to fo76 one. It is not perfect but they work on the game like professionals, Beth don't.
---
That's true I don't know what it's like to have that high a level. But I've played every other Fallout to completion and there's a definite difference between encountering a death claw at lower levels vs high it's legit fear.I like the creatures actually being a threat to me that's all. Other players is an entirely different story.
---
I deleted fo76 a couple weeks ago just because I hadn't played it in a while and more space is always nice. I figured I'd reinstall once wastelanders dropped. Then it was delayed, and then now this happens. Just seems like an odd twist of fate.
---
How many people do you think work both jobs? The outrage threads here are hilarious. You guys have no idea what you're talking about.
---
I stopped playing about 6 months ago.... I’m going to fully uninstall now.
---
Man the amount of Legendaries I got in the first 30 min is insane. I'm glad everyone is on their own private server lol. This public world is rocking.
---
And now it's time to slay the scortchedbeast
---
The tent, and the scrapbox storage, which are exclusive to the Fallout 1st Subscription, are content, locked behind a paid service that honestly isn't worth the value.  
---
I would rather spend $2USD extra a month on an MMO subscription, at least I would be playing a finished and polished game.
---
I have learned this is something that they are looking to add. Might hold off for now.
---
the way I see it there are 3 problems here. one is that they're lying about private servers. these aren't private servers. but what's worse is that it'd take them minutes to release actual, local private servers.
---
two and three are essentially the same, it's the p2w, or rather p2c. how far are they willing to take it? first it was just repair and scrap kits, ok, whatever. not very convenient and kinda useless. then it was the scrapbot and fridges. same, I can see their uses but it's hardly something worth getting upset about.
---
but now they're slowly increasing how "convenient" these items are. having infinite storage and a server just to yourself definitely gives you an edge and is a little more than just "convenient".
---
The mayor is up to something, mob? Maybe a Chinese infiltrater?
---
It's been a good run, but obsidian is going to prove why they've always been one step ahead of Bethesda with the outer worlds.
---
If you are trying to go "MMO" subscription I have some bad news bethesda. $100 for a year is a relatively modest price but... those MMO games with subscriptions have tons of content, support, new content added every 2-3 months, social features, etc. You are just adding convience for subscription, not content. Free-to-Play MMOs do this... and they aren't popular models many would say.
---
I'm reading few posts about the store being down, though I was able to purchase on my main, so I'm guessing his account actually needs to purchase the game to subscribe.
---
I'll give it a few days to see if the store allows me to purchase. Thanks again for the replies.
---
Sweet.
---
Dont forget if the first member isnt in the server everyone else gets kicked!
---
Lol okay this makes no sense to me now.  Should there be a free power armor helmet and nylon bag for you, too?  I just don't get how physical object = expect free digital item, though I do agree that there's more value there.  I thought you were saying it did come with a free digital map that you still had to pay for and I was wondering if I missed getting one too.
---
It's the same in Australia, we get charged more than the US.  I know FO76 uses AWS sites in UK, Germany, East &amp; West coast USA and Australia.  I assume the difference in cost is due to the difference in AWS pricing between sites - it's more expensive to host my private instance in AWS Australia than USA.
---
However that is one GIANT assumption on my part.  If I was running Bethesda I'd still not have priced them differently because it just seems like a big middle finger salute to their international players.  (On top of the entire-arm salute they're giving everyone with the pricing in the first place)
---
I have 3* Bos vanguard combat armor. Weapon reduction and food, drink, chem reduction.
---
Remember when Bethesda was mocked out of the room for daring to provide "cosmetic only" gear that actually had some minor benefits for five bucks?   Christ, those were the days.
---
No it’s not pay to win. What am I winning? People are sitting around bitching because they want it all for free. The fact is, if we want the next fallout game to be great or if this one is gonna get fixed they need to generate revenue. That’s what this is. I love the game and the experience it provides me so I have no issue spending some extra money to have access to the things they’re bringing to us. There is no “winning” in FO76.
---
There is nothing anti-consumer about an optional subscription service. Plus the product description lets you know what you’re getting.
---
What makes this defense more absurd is that games w/o this garbage are a helluva lot better than games w/ this garbage.
---
A game that does did not cost too much to make(Zelda, Witcher, Cyberpunk(most likely), Spiderman, God of war, Batman Arkham Knight) being better than games that do like any Ubisoft game or 76 or any EA or CoD game then what are you even paying for?
---
By logic, games w/ transactions in them should be masterpieces cause so much money put into them as opposed to games w/o transactions. But its vise versa. Shows how stupid these defenders are.
---
Thes games don't need your money to be good or to finish the game, they just need competent publishers/devs. Cyberpunk 2077 shall be the perfect example of a game that does not cost too much to make and does not need any more money and is waaay better than any game w/ microtransactions and they of the 76 bullshit.
---
I'm sure a representative will be in touch shortly
---
Its not a sub to the game, the game is exactly the same. Its pay for private servers with some extras thrown in. Gamers are seriously the most melodramatic, reactionary people, I swear. No wonder outrage youtubers make so much money off y'all. Zero to sixty over nothing, frothing like Alex-fucking-Jones.
---
The real question is why were you guys still playing this game and why are you all super shocked that Bethesda is doing exactly what Bethesda does
---
Got it PSN is favorites menu [Dpad up] then triangle
---
Commies everywhere! Even our municipal governments ain’t safe!
---
I'm glad we can agree on Pete Hines being full of shit haha. Sorry if I sounded annoyed by your last comment I'm just too used to older people lecturing me about finances.
---
It's the same value due to exchange rates... but it's still too much money
---
I wholeheartedly, unironically, believe that but that doesn't mean my antisocial ass doesn't want to play it by myself.
---
That's like, your opinion, man.
---
Xbox. Understandably it’s no where near as accessible compared to PC of course but still inexcusable by all means.
---
Cringe
---
Sorry your so dissapointed. We're having such a wonderful not at all dissapointing day, unlike you.
---
I was hoping you might shed some light on the subject and tell me something I didn't already know, but clearly you just want to be angry.
---
Efficiency has nothing to do with this. It's a simple matter of memory limitations. You don't need a genius to figure this out... Stacks of any material overflow at 65535 and revert back to 1, that's how it's always been in their engine. Try trading 65536 screws with someone, they'll get 1.
---
&gt;normalised properly or not
---
You mean normalized? I certainly hope they are, but knowing Bethesda, you're probably right, their game server databases are probably a mess. Regardless, there is no reason this would affect the size of one, single entry, such as the amount of a particular item, which we already know to be 16 bits whether we can see their code or not.
---
I'm gay and even I think you enjoy taking it in the butt more than me...
---
the game is essentially a modded Fo4, nothing more. the only server calls are whatever they want it to be.
---
in theory you don't even need a local server to run it at all. it's not such an herculean architectural feat that Bethesda can't pull off. it's just that they know it'd be end of their revenue stream.
---
Bethesda has proven that more money=\= fixing their shit, hence the game breaking bugs still present today
---
Since no other news has been released, and nothing should interfere with the release of NPC's in the game, it can only be assumed that a lot of R&amp;D time, that should have gone to the update, was spent working on the logistics behind this atrocious subscription service, instead of dedicating real working hours towards a meaningful update.
---
Then have Blizzard join, and let them introduce a chat function into 76 only to ban people for free speech
---
You can buy it microsoft store for 1$ or something.
---
Yeah, so you don't play the game and you come here every time there's a new outrage.
---
That's even more pathetic
---
Bethesda it's already top 9 downvoted comments.
---
Is it 4pm as I thought it was out at midnight over there?
---
Deffinelty don't listen to the silly people who can't handle a day or two of warranted outrage.
---
They are selling a product.
---
Monetary exchange for the use of Bethesda developed software.  Or is software not a product because its just 1s and 0s.   Tell this to Microsoft, or Google, or Apple.
---
Also, the features they are selling did not exist on this platform before, so they are well within their rights as a product creator to charge for the time, money and resources it took to develop the product.
---
You wanted Bethesda to release proprietary information so you can disect it and do your own thing, when they will receive no monetary incentive to do so.   Yeah, not going to happen, companies get paid for their resources, they dont just give them out for free.  This is an online game, not Fallout4.  Stop comparing the 2, they are different.
---
Countries cracking down on loot boxes.   Ok.   I will take financial advice from those countries when they reach 25% of all commerce performed on the entire planet.  Until then, I will live, breathe, and buy just like every other American.   Yeah, I'm an entitled American with money, go cry about it.
---
As far as money for promises.   What do you think insurance is, its paying for the promise you will be covered.  You buy it though, dont you.
---
I did my best to to defend this game to a lot of people. But now, I just give up.
---
I am also on Xbox.... honestly I got disconnected all the time at launch. It was frustrating. After a few patches though things slowly got more
---
Stable to the point where I could play all day tomorrow, run silos all day and not get disconnected once.
---
&gt;You mean normalized?
---
No, I mean normalised.
---
I did. If you can put aside how disgusting and pathetic Bethesda is for doing this, it’s worth it.
---
In retrospect, that was a clear indicator of how much they care about us. Hindsight is 20/20, huh?
---
Private solo play? That’ll be $10 more dollars sir.
---
Oh no call Mark Zuckerberg.......call @jack.......we need to censor free speech on FO76 Reddit. #save the snowflakes
---
It's very close to ESO+, craft bag and all. ESO does add content regularly though, and doesn't crash NEARLY as often, and is transparent about charging for DLC.
---
I was already paying that much for atoms win win for me
---
😆, Empty antisocial hermit servers, you are only paying for a monthly dose of Atoms, couple freebies here and there, not worth the dough at all.
---
If you want to continually pay a cost more than the game was at LAUNCH and not what it retails for NOW. That is on you. Essentially a feature free in other games, and other games that are not completely broken, which Fallout is. (400+ hour, lvl 162 character) I would know.
---
If you’re that desperate to defend these clearly predatory practices from, you’re not defending a point but just letting the community know you don’t care you’re clearly getting ripped off! 
---
😂🤣
---
I’m not sure if that was a dig at Rare as well as sea of thieves (which I agree is poo) but Rare is one of the best game studios of all time lol
---
Can we confirm the mold spores? I thought they were safe to use
---
Private servers are still multiplayer. They can have up to 8 people at once. Old school vats wouldn’t work.
---
Also lose the attitude and don’t be a cunt.
---
Yup, one time my son got stuck in an infinite wanted loop when he accidentally shot someone's camp trying to help. (Before the changed Adventure). Literally the whole server showed up and wrecked him and his camp.
---
I'm a precision gear machinist in the aerospace and defense industry I pay for stuff with hard earned money. Pretty simple concept you should look into it.
---
You dont, toss the disc in the fucking trash and play a better game, Like fallout 4.
---
Sunk cost fallacy
---
Private World's sound interesting, but with the high subscription cost id rather spend on other Worlds, perhaps one more Outer.
---
Sweet little lies
---
But as OP said; people are buying it. It's selling. It's making the shadowy shareholders money.
---
It's fucked man, the whole system, fuck it.
---
I'll buy your book when you write it, you have a creative writing style.
---
I to be a poor.
---
Except you know.... the cost to buy one

---
Exactly what I said.
---
This is privatized instancing on THEIR servers that we're still paying for. I have a bunch of people in a Fallout 76 Roleplaying community that want a dedicated server so we can finally build an RP server with factions and organic Fallout roleplay.
---
**It's been almost a year** since the game came out and within the 1st month we were fantasizing about private servers. Finally, finally Bethesda says those 2 magic words, but they are **not** what private servers actually are.
---
Something something"...This where things went from tardy to retardy"
---
I've had more fun reading this outrage than I've had with the game in the last 3 days.
---
Sell your dignity to Bethesda.
---
I found it to be better. Def worth the price.
---
Well I feel bad for u/ladydevann and all the new canned responses they have to put out in regards to this abomination.
---
Someone finally said it! They really do. And this is all starting to feel a bit rape-y.
---
I don't plan to pay a dime for cosmetic, even that nice like Ranger outfit. Not worth half the price I paid for the game.
---
Nice.
---
No offence but the fact that you subconsciously *wanted* to defend it but they've gone so low that you couldn't definitely tells you there is something wrong with this games fandom, Bethesda/Zenimax is a billion dollar corporation, their feelings haven't been hurt and they don't need defending, they're not some naive indie gamers who are "Just trying to make a good game for the fans" they're trying to make [loadsmoney](https://youtu.be/ULeDlxa3gyc?t=30) and when people leap to their defence they're just helping continue the exploitation.
---
Actually it's like 150 bucks a year ... but if u buy 12 months all at once its 100 . Month to month gets you . And if you're like me and forget all about the game like I did with eso, you'll pay for a year of it and never play it .
---
You're right, fuck that. I'm gonna play fallout 4 with Marty Robbins blaring in my modded playthrough
---
They also said the server customization is coming... for what that’s worth.
---
People like Fatal are the reason why we keep getting fucked over with micro transactions...
---
Use Scrap Kits. You're rich enough for it.
---
Lol, nice.
---
Quit the mental gymnastics.  it is NOT still extra server space.  You just said it yourself you fucking shill, "...There's only 33 types of scrap and then a value associated with how many you have of each... that's simple..."
---
You can't have it both ways!  Do you work for Bethesda or something?
---
Game will be a literal wasteland in those few months.
---
It is **significantly** better.  85% less lag on everything thus far.  No pausing and waiting in the silos, and events are as smooth as butter.
---
I can't wait to try out a vault raid on this.
---
$4 over the exchange rate? That's on Bethesda
---
I love his rants so much. This one was particularly good.
---
After 11 months and 253 levels at end of this month I am out.   Pathetic!!
---
Are you hardwired or WiFi?
---
You're more than welcome, must be much work to get your life changed over like that, good luck.
---
Absolutely right, they're just trying to take your money for nostalgia
---
I stopped a few weeks ago. I live in a rural area and get 5mb internet. It plays fine but these 20 gig updates every other week take literally overnight. 
---
So I come home from work, pop in the disc, "need new patch"
---
Got a little tired of this after about the fifteenth time.
---
That and I just found I was endlessly farming for legendary items, which were usually crap anyways, at the golf club.
---
I was going to revisit in the winter but after all this latest crap.....nah.
---
I bought Days Gone, gonna give that a whirl.
---
I was honestly thinking about buying it until I saw the price, oh well
---
Sheeeeeet that's too bad dude either way I invite you to join r/PKOA :D we have players from all 3 Platforms too
---
&gt;you are only paying for...freebies 
---
SHUT IT DOWN
---
https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/fallout1st is how I did it when it rolled out, ignore the whining people it's if you want to do it or not, no harm either way.
---
So stupid, the bots on this sub will gladly pay for this shit though.
---
Why is my room dark?
---
Why am I alone?
---
Well said.
---
That's too bad, can't say I ever came across a tower, sounded cool :(
---
Do you think this is Bethesda's attempt to buy favor from the Chinese?
---
Absolutely! I can't convince anyone it's necessary for science right now lol
---
Especially since the ammo factory needs defending just now :)
---
I knew they were gonna fuck this private server thing up super hardcore because that's what they have done with 100% of all major things about this game but holy Christ raping asshole this is some absolute top tier bullshit.
---
ALSO WHAT IF EVERYONE ON A PUBLIC SERVER HAS THIS SHIT AND HAS THOUSANDS OF POUNDS OF SHIT IN THE SCRAPBOX!?  
---
What about not being able to expand stash limits to compensate for server instability you disgusting lying fuckheads.
---
Exactly! This is the one thing, if this was after Wastelanders and that was good I'd consider it.
---
Hardwired. WiFi makes the game nearly unplayable.
---
Yeah my initial comment was a bit wide to be fair, sorry. There's so much misinformation going about though, people get so wound up about things they haven't even looked into.
---
If you don't like the sub don't look at it.
---
It’s 17 on the Xbox One and S, the X is 37 for the 4k assets.
---
I expect nothing at this point.
---
what has steven crowder to do with this? cant u please dont bring ur ideology shit into a subreddit for a game this is not r/politics if u wanna do that go there.
---
u pay full price for a triple AAA game , this is not a mmo its not massive, has little multiplayer and a lot of problems. this is a straight cashgrab at this point wouldnt be surprise if they copied chinese mobile strategy for this.
---
I can wear a scout armour mask with a combat armour helmet
---
1 free year of NCR ranger armour, unlimited stash (they originally said was impossible, because server issues) and private worlds (aka single player, that they have said they would do either for free or could not do)? Yeah, It should just be free. Full stop.
---
The same can be said of all other games ever created.
---
We are gamers.  By design we are hermits.
---
We sit in front of a TV and play fantasy with other people in worlds that dont exist.
---
as far as spending a pack of cigarettes worth a month on a game I enjoy, well, that is something I can do.
---
This subscription costs less than a half hour at the gun range, for a month of play.  Ill take it.
---
Oh wow, that means not taking all the workshops in a playthrough then. Lol that's a missed selling point.
---
Everything is literally beyond stable, very responsive it's crazy really, only got 1st so I can share a server with friends who don't exactly like public anymore.
---
I guess I look at it from the context of things like Ancestry (genealogy website), where certain tools are locked behind a pay wall. I don’t get mad that I can’t download documents from Ancestry without the premium subscription, if I want to have the documents to print out or upload onto another site I have to pay the subscription fee. In the same light, if I want to avoid griefers and get unlimited junk storage I can pay the fee or not; if I don’t pay it then I accept what I get from random players. I’m essentially paying for my own server space, which is why there is the unlimited storage space.
---
I bet you didn’t have to pay 100 dollars a year for that and it still looks better than the one in game.
---
You in USA or somewhere else?
---
Just trying to trouble shoot here. Some people hve terrible ISPs, especially in Europe and rural America
---
Ok
---
where does it state in bethesdas own material , that you are paying for a server?
---
After the news broke all over social media I uninstalled it. Annoyingly I was forced to look at an advertisement for their shit monthly service upon my sign in to their launcher.
---
Game's over, the Overseer left...
---
post was deleted under request from 3rd party 
---
(i'm sorry about this)
---
I bought the one month membership just for the ncr outfit and atoms.
---
Across 3 systems we only killed 36 million scorched in a week.
---
Unless the average player only killed 15 scorched in a week I'd say it's highly unlikely that this game has anywhere close to 2.5 million players. I think 200 scorched a week (15 a day) is more likely.....which means 150k to 200k players and that's being generous.
---
I highly doubt the server update ticks are anywhere near fast enough to for one player to pull that off, the scripts couldn't keep up and either wouldn't register what they where doing or would attempt to process everything it gets between ticks and at worst slow down the server by a few seconds, which is pretty much the norm.
---
A single weapon on the other hand can be made up of anywhere from 1 to around a dozen FormIDs depending on what "slots" it has for mods, paints, and legendary effects. IIRC, since each mod, paint, or legendary effect on a weapon, plus the weapon itself, is stored as set of 8 character hexadecimal FormIDs (plus whatever else) while a scrap component is stored as FormID and an integer, just a handful of weapons can require as much data as all the scrap component stacks.
---
I cant gather wood and build a bridge cause my free stash is full!! Jerk.
---
Same man. Spent today looking for a new home.
---
A lot of it comes down to social pressure, obfuscation of prices and, in extreme instances like loot boxes, abusing flat out gambling addictions. The consumers are in no condition to regulate themselves on this. They're being manipulated, plain and simple.
---
Ooh more Sam Blackwell? Hell yeah!
---
Where does it say I’m paying for an instance? It’s all over everything this is a private SERVER!
---
Bethesda: “Go to hell, shut up &amp; give us money that’s why”
---
Im getting 1 month just for the outfit, atoms and scrap box. Im gonna farm like crazy to build up my junk before the month ends. 
---
Its already freed up 300lbs of stash space and Im not through scrapping my bulk either.
---
I mean, I like the tent. Too bad you don't have a way to obtain it for free
---
TLDR;
---
Announcing Creation Club 2.0 bigger, greedier now with 50% more false promises.  Included with club membership false private servers.
---
Holiday Fluff
---
Flying drill boxes
---
We may or may not have fixed some unimportant things. (Probably not)
---
It’s not just Bethesda we need to make this clear to. It’s the entire industry. Bethesda, Rockstar, EA, and Ubisoft need to be taken to task. This isn’t even nickel and diming anymore. It’s just plain abuse.
---
I think the likely answer is:
---
3)  Bethesda has attempted market research and believes that $13 is what the most amount of interested subscribers will be willing to pay for a service like this, probably based on case studies from similar services, not the least of which is ESO.
---
That's just capitalism, for better or (often) worse.  We also shouldn't assume that the /r/fo76 shitstorm is indicative of what customers really think, because for as vocal as this place is, it's still very much a minority.
---
Warframe does this for free :D
---
The unlimited storage.
---
I'm torn between it and the NCR Ranger armor though :/
---
Would you like me to show you a copy of my CE?  Yes, I did buy it.  And we should have been given the canvas bag from the very beginning.
---
As for the 1000 atoms ... maybe you missed the part where I said I've been *waiting* for private servers.  That means I've been *waiting* before playing the game for the functionality that was promised.
---
Edit: funny how you downvoted me based on your asinine assumption.  Didn't even have the guts to reply.
---
If I could refund this pile of poo i would.
---
Its probably a p2p connection. Seems more like a paid session more than a paid server. I would have purchased a copy if they brought in private sessions for free. But no. Ill stay far away from this fallout. And that will be a first for me
---
Never understood the need for "clothes" in games.
---
If you ever saw me play, I was usually in a tattered dress with a clown hat. Very fat as well. I actually had players stop and I assume look at me.
---
WARFRAME
---
Not great but an idea to exploit this is to gather as much junk as you can, but the membership for 1 month and then stash it.  They mention that once your membership expires, you can only withdraw.
---
They decided to put a paywall, behind all the must have features that should of been released on launch. Absolute scumbags
---
It gives me an error and says service unavailable, did Bethesda pull the plug?
---
Yeah,  op
---
 Go outside get some wood,  build a bridge and get over it
---
Just remember, Fallout 76 is a 16+ game, people who are playing either already have a job or have a modest income, I'm no ass kisser but the poor excuse just doesn't work anymore.
---
...remember, we're paying so you don't have to.
---
8 people. That's cute.
---
"Also if you buy it digitally, say goodbye to the ability to refund, even if every other service ever is able to do it, we 'can't' hahahaha" -Hodd Toward
---
200 caps sounds amazing. I’ll look now.
---
I’ve sent you a msg. You don’t appear to be online
---
Are you talking about the new forward camp thing with the membership stuff?
---
Pennsylvania
---
i mean.. i played both, alot, even with the addition of the 3 new jobs both games really lack a thing to keep doing in the long time.
---
if your looking for a fun game to try together have you tried destiny 2? its amazing now and alot of the base game is F2P, theres no nasty pay to win and more things to do!
---
if you want to nitpick then you should mention electricity as well.
---
but I already own my computer.
---
Why tho? It would just break more lore
---
Ya wouldn't have this issue if you had stored your items on corpses like everyone else.
---
The corpses have names and theme so you can easily arrange items :D
---
In AUS I had to pay $100 for the normal fucking edition, pre-order for PC. HAH, they refused to refund me before the game even left BETA.
---
Ohh god... why would you poke an old wound? Have some dam Mercy dude. I’m still bitter.
---
Scrap Kits don't break down weapons and armor pieces.
---
My finances are my own business.  :P
---
This makes me think they need more funding to get more people to finish wastelanders.
---
Go to the filthy casual subreddit. Theyll  call you an idiot "who doesnt know how compute works"
---
I'm not a liberal.....I was making fun of the whiny little bitch who wants to censor Reddit.
---
Yep. A blue urban mask. But not a brown forest mask.
---
Servers are full of people with the new icons.  It is very popular. It looks to be an overwhelming success. Contrary to the subs opinion. Kinda like collectrons.
---
This seems to be a tough concept for many
---
Just realized I spent way too much time on this post, I need to get out more 😂
---
What don't you understand?
---
It’s the poors. They’re having a sad because Bethesda didn’t give them more free stuff.
---
You have to break them down manually first.
---
You can already buy legendaries on Ebay anyways lol
---
What group is this the flat earth bethesda society?
---
Well, if you think about, that it will ask you for scrapping all items before you put anything to it, then it should at least automatically scrap bulks ...
---
One does have a bottomless bag that can hold a infinate amount of junk....
---
Am I the only person who sees this as a shameless post-hoc cash grab?
---
We were all suspicious when the initial game was released w/o any monthly subscription fee. This is now creating 2 tiers of Fallout 76:
---
- One you pay for
---
- One you pay more for that has features promised before release
---
Bethesda, I'm not sure you're capable of fucking this up any worse.
---
It's time to leave not just this game behind but also Bethesda.
---
Realms is cheap and it allows people who aren’t familiar with setting up a server to quickly make a server for a few friends to connect. This is a scam that realizes that people want to play solo. Fuck Bethesda
---
I have no shame for paying for the subscription.  I don't care what anyone else does.
---
Idk man, you sound like a neckbeard
---
 Well, if you think about, that it will ask you for scrapping all items  before you put anything to it, then it should at least automatically  scrap bulks ...
---
Is it even just the servers? I'm not surprised an already buggy engine that was never made for multiplayer has trouble with more than 8 people doing different things.
---
I definitely agree that the outrage yet again overgrew the reason for the outrage. So many bullshit keep popping up just because people are angry at Bethesda. 
---
"DAE remember Horse Armor? Bethesda has always been bad." Yes, we remember. The issue was about the price/content ratio. And guess what? It's been confirmed that the price was forced by Microsoft so that their themes and wallpapers in shop wouldn't be more expensive than game DLC.
---
"Outer Worlds releases in two days." Tons of games are getting released in the near future. 76 and TOW are not even comparable.
---
"They said that they can't increase stash size because of stability". Yes, and they are not giving the subscribers unlimited stash space. They are giving them unlimited scrap stash. Any software engineer would instantly know why... (Same items as pieces of scrap can be tracked as a single record like 20 Wood. Then it doesn't matter when it's 2000 Wood, because it's still a record of the same size. But 200 Machettes have to be tracked piece by piece, because each can have different mods and durability).
---
"Private servers are always free". Here are people mistaking private local servers (hosted on the customer hardware) and private cloud/dedicated servers (hosted by Bethesda/AWS). Bethesda offers the latter and such servers tend to be monetised, like Minecraft Realms. If anyone expected to run 76 Server on his PC, then he hasn't been paying attention.
---
"In December I predicted this". Yeah, people were saying tons of doomsday scenarios about the game. Someone got to get a lucky guess eventually. 
---
Truth to be told, I'm disenchanted with Bethesda myself. But I know exactly my reasons - locking two important gameplay features behind a subscription paywall. I don't have to invent all kind of bullshit to validate my position. I feel betrayed by this announcement, but I also won't announce any kind of boycott of Bethesda. I won't stop playing Skyrim or Fallout 4. I may return to try out Wastelanders.
---
What really pisses me off, maybe even more than this announcement, are the people who keep turning on their fellow gamers, just because those gamers keep playing the game. I can fully understand why you keep playing the game. And I wish you good luck. I'll most possibly be taking a break, but I do it for myself. I don't need validation by other people doing the same. Seriously, if I see the words "sunk cost fallacy", "Stockholm Syndrome" or "shill" one more time on this subreddit, I swear to Todd that I'm gonna invent a way how to punch people in the face through internet...
---
Yeah I tried it already for the XB1 stuff, was really hoping the same thing .. would have been cool.
---
Not when they develop open world rpgs
---
Oh nice
---
Guess all I can say is you better get used to it because that's the way all MMO's are
---
Yeah, i just scrapped my bulks.  Lost 400lbs thanks to my scrap box
---
Yeah, I'm out.
---
Thanks I love any skin I can get, helps to avoid accidental dropping!
---
So to sum up what you said: private servers should run like private servers, not private matches or sharding.
---
Purchased my yearly subscription. 
---
It’s $8.25 a month. Vs $12.99 monthly
---
You get 1650 atoms a month, which is worth $10
---
You get a discount on prices in the atom store 
---
And you get a private server for you and 7 friends
---
Now, I wish the server held more, but seems like a decent deal to me. 
---
But I guess I hold an unpopular opinion.
---
Because people enjoy games that you don't? It's not rocket science that some of us like this game.
---
“You do however get an atom amount that's almost equal to the value of the subscription (at least for the Canadian pricing).”
---
Don’t fall for that - Atoms have no actual value. When it comes to digital goods, publishers don’t have to worry about storage, material costs, shipment etc. A dev makes the blue armor graphic then they have an infinite stock of the item. This is why it is so insulting that they want like $15 - $20 for some cosmetics.
---
They’ve built a store environment that makes 500 atoms seem to be worth $5. And blue armor worth $18. But none of this is actually worth anything, it’s all arbitrarily set by the publisher and you will lose it all when the next game comes out / these servers go. All of this shit is worth nothing. 
---
It costs them absolutely nothing to give you Monopoly money they set the value of, to buy digital items they set the value of, all of which costing them virtually nothing to produce. It’s an illusion of goods and an illusion of value. They give you $13 of atoms, then you add $5 of atoms from your own pocket to get $18 blue armor. “Oh that was a pretty good deal, with the subscription atoms for this month I only had to pay $5.” While Bethesda just made $5 on something that cost them a fraction of a cent to send over 1mb of data and $10 on the subscription.
---
lol people downvoting you, I get now that “fanboyism” is real, damn telling people to not buy something that it’s obviously ridiculous really hurts their feelings, I’ve changed my mind, those people deserves to be scammed by companies like Bethesda
---
Nice? There is no 69 in that sentence of mine.
---
They'll probably sell something soon enough in ghe shop for that.
---
there's more to p2w than just pvp. but my point is that they're slowly cranking it up. first it was just repair and scrap kits but not it's something that actually gives you an edge.
---
whether you agree is irrelevant. there are several pros of having infinite storage. infinite ammo comes to mind. the only reason why I have to constantly grind is because I have an 800 units limit to my storage and can't stockpile the components I'm constantly farming for, I need to exhaust my current supply first.
---
another is farming. being alone on a server means I get all the legendaries. no need to hop or hope someone already cleaned the golf house.
---
Agreed that it was absolute bs for everyone to down requests to uncap scrap storage and other stash issues. So many comments hidden and posts about stash limits being bs but hey at least people understand it now well at least till they leave and all thats left is hardcore fanboys.
---
Now this is how you do it. Just cut the free atoms and drop the price in half until stuff like this is implemented.
---
That's good because they refused to give me a refund, even before BETA ended.
---
they already have funding for wastelanders... see: 50 mill profit. Wastelanders is not a whole games worth of content, and all assets are already there, they just redecorate existing locations, pay voice actors, load in pre-existing npc models/pathings/etc. my thinking is initial cost is to fleece core members, then by the time wastelanders comes they'll reduce cost by 50% or so to claim 'we hear you' to the folks that leave...and try to get back to existing player base.
---
It's "world " not server, you are  delusional
---
Not going to lie, I’m one of the people that always says if you don’t like it, don’t buy it. I got pretty annoyed and immune to the constant complaining. A lot was valid, but most felt like nitpicking. 
---
This makes zero sense to me, though. Especially upon The Outer Worlds release. Are they trying to help obsidian? I’m thoroughly confused. This all coming from someone that would be totally willing to pay an extra $100 for private servers if the game was solid and actually had substance. I never thought I’d see the day I’d get bored so quickly with a fallout game. Haven’t played in months. Really excited for The Outer Worlds though!
---
You mean a liberal who plays video games for a living and drinks gamer soda?
---
Nah bro......I spend 2 hours a day in the gym with women in yoga pants. No neck beard here.
---
Shit a month after,  i bought a controller and they just gave it to me.  I expect betheny esda to do much smaller retail releases from now on.
---
Like throwing a sausage down an alley
---
Could have quit right after it came out when everybody knew it was shit back then lol.  
---
“Buy our game! It might be good in ten years.”
---
Hi Todd.
---
Where do they say they’re giving anyone a private server?  
---
8 player max on in a “private world” doesn’t sound like a private server, it sounds like peer to peer.  
---
Everyone who pays for this BS is going to share a server.  They’ll just be separated from each other and you’ll connect to the person that owns the world when you want to play together.
---
I love it
---
"All the content after launch will be free, Atom Shop will only have cosmetic items" - Pete Hyenas.
---
Lol if they didn't buy anything beyond the base game then how are they "bending over" by playing the product they bought? Y'all too much sometimes
---
that's just a cop-out. it doesn't tackle the issue or changes anything. it's a non-argument. congrats.
---
Thank you rich master for making this game better and possible for me to play. You're free to come to my camp. Milk my brahmin, take my crops and ill lie on my bed and you may do what you wish to me.
---
I'm sure someone else has commented this, but this is VERY similar to how ESO is setup.
---
Unlimited Junk = Unlimited crafting materials
---
1650 atoms = 1500 crowns
---
I quit ESO a while back when the "premium subscription" came out, too...
---
Judging by the amount of people defending Bethesda they have enough whales to keep it going, which means nothing will change. By the time E6 comes out I'll be too old to give a shit, and Bethesda has done a good job pushing me away over the last 2 years.
---
I can almost thank them.
---
Not to mention, even if you hate the idea of this service, you could compare it as a one time purchase to one of those convention sales they had for atom and it’s a steal
---
Those convention sale atom purchases were $10 and you got
---
- 1500 atom
---
- an exclusive outfit
---
A one time purchase of this service is $13 and you get 
---
- 1,650 atom 
---
- an exclusive outfit 
---
- exclusive emotes
---
- one month to fill a special stash with as much junk as you can possibly put in it (and you keep it all after the month and use it whenever, you just can’t put more in) 
---
- one month of having a second fast travel camp
---
- one month of private servers
---
#peasantprobs
---
You are complaining still about a nylon bag when you have the canvas bag now... at this point you gotta move on. Did you buy the PA edition because you wanted the bag? I wouldn’t have even noticed lol. It doesn’t matter though because you got the bag. 
---
Why don’t you just play the game you paid money for? You just sound grumpy at this point.
---
Hell, Anthem just came out with a new update with free armor and new missions, and a modified game mode.  Not only that, but they have 100% kept their promises about no passes, and no loot boxes.  Other than a lack of content, Anthems looking pretty alright atmcompared to this garbage.  Fallout 76 is worth less than dirt by comparison, which is something I never thought id say about any Bethesda game, let alone my favorite franchise.  A REAL shame when a game like Anthem is better than a Fallout game..
---
Finally got it to work. It seems the other account needs Xbox Live, so I used a trial and everything worked out fine.
---
Hopefully canceling FO1st is easier that trying to getting a subscription.
---
Oh great.... I thought it was going to be good with the addition of legendary SBs!!!
---
I think you underestimate the wilful obliviousness of Obsidian fanboys.
---
It's not just on a private server. It's in the base game too
---
So... does this seems good to you? I mean, should it be encouraged? I really think it should be discouraged, people blame companies, and they aren’t the one to blames. It’s you guys and “I Do whAtEvEr I WaNt WiTh My MoNeY”. But don’t ever complain “this game is incomplete fuck Bethesda, fuck epic, fuck EA EA BAD fortnite bad”
---
They said they couldn’t do it because of server issues, yet they’re making us pay for it
---
"Wastelanders isn't finished! How can we ensure no one finds the flaws?"
---
"I just got an idea."
---
A server is more than just a computer tower.
---
This whole game/situation is a dumpster fire. And if you open the flaming dumpster, inside is a shit show. I used to believe you guys were awesome and really gave a shit about the community. This just proves i was a fucking idiot.
---
I mean fo76's map IS flat...
---
Crowder has much better demenor and arguments than you ever will.  
---
Thats why he has his own talk show.
---
Minecraft!
---
Thanks captain, that's handy info, I'll give you a shout! Healthy.
---
Lol you are ridiculous. You are right tho- these posts are stupid.
---
The neighborhood kids keep murdering my Brahmin. When the hell are we gonna get horse armor??
---
Good luck with that.
---
Except they did with the NW rewards and Halloween event hah.
---
Time to uninstall and boycott Bethesda games in the future.  Thank you for ruining a franchise that I loved.
---
It's not really an MMO and they're charging you $100 for it. Other companies do think of it but it's a PR nightmare of what you pick and who suggested it.
---
Remember Boaty McBoatface? That will be your game if updates are chosen democratically.
---
I need that pink minigun
---
Who are you even talking about lol?
---
Instead we got "Fallout Online lite" and Elder Scrolls Online.
---
The dataminers say she doesn't scale, and the damage in the air doesn't effect her landing, so be careful about this. I'm not claiming I'm right, you're wrong, but back up your claim with data.
---
Can't put bulks in and can't mass-move all the junk on your character into the scrapbox. That much is inconvenient but I shed over 400 weight from my stash by getting the junk out so I'm dealing with it.
---
I suppose there's no reason to bulk anything anymore anyway.
---
I've spent 1200hrs playing the game. I think I've got my monies worth
---
Reading people's comments but people; the expansion was not anticipated to be in place for the upcoming expansion.  It is.  This required a lot of actors/actresses from coming in, bringing in the whole crew and making an element they did not think of.  Granted it was a mistake on their part as they should have brought in the elements in the first place, but they need money.  This is online, servers require money.  Bandwidth, Servers, Firewalls, Licenses from software is required which is pretty pricey.  I'm in a medium small business but our latest change-over for two switches....switches people....100k.  so that plus firewalls and blah blah blah, it stacks people.  They never blocked off the game itself and the content.  In fact, all my items I got I did not have to spend a dime.  In comparison with other places like LoL, CoD, and so on it takes freakin forever to get them.
---
their other option is shutting it down.  
---
So I welcome the change.
---
To be allowed to sue,you first have to go trough a paywall subscription so you can now pay your lawyer to make bethesda pay you back after your payments are complete in the cycle of subscription payments
---
OK. I already own my monitor, too. keyboard and mouse, check.
---
have you never hosted a local server in your machine?
---
So, how does that camp thing work? Does it cost caps to move and etc?
---
Yeah, I'm well into my music lol I only listen to songs that have an effect if that makes sense be it TheFatRat, Scandroid or Celldweller I listen to music as my mood changes
---
Hearthstone is free to play. FO76 cost 60 bucks when it came out. 
---
I prefer mtg arena but you can't deny that hs is a polished product.
---
Its called helping an old friend.
---
I have perfect performance now though.... I think the benefit fo private servers is once modding is allowed.
---
I will launch two nukes tonight in your honor from the public server I’m on. Maybe you’ll be there
---
This is easy: greed.
---
Lmao people defend this dumpster fire, I paid 200 bucks for the Power Armor edition, never got my canvas bag, watched 76 drop to bargain bin prices, and now they’re adding even more MTX to a broken premium game
---
Gotta pay $10 to see it
---
Thats just straight up not all that happened man.  Are you forgetting the canvas situation? What about the rum fakery?  What about that they promised private games would be a thing available to all in 76 before release, with mods allowed, no less?  What about the Atom Shop prices being "discounted" in a way that was blatantly illegal in 3 major countries?They are  just straight up lying now, not even trying to hide it.  Light wood laminate, light wood laminate....
---
And like I said I don't believe they have that many players. I was killing 100 scorched a day without even trying.
---
Wait, do what now??
---
World of Warcraft is cheaper.
---
Wtf Bethesda
---
if you check the files you'll see that, from a technical standpoint, this game works very similarly to Fo4. there's nothing stopping it from running locally.
---
It's a big announcement, after the update delay too. I think folk are just going mental over the junk stash thing. They don't understand it's not the same as individual items being stored vs server crashes vs "promises"
---
I think they’re just trolling us at this point.
---
I have a job and a modest income and I already paid. Thats the problem, im not getting what I paid for.
---
You're such a neckbeard man, it's hilarious. I loved the part where you had to validate your manhood by telling a stranger about your mad gains surrounded by women. Anyone who goes to the gym every day would know that those women aren't there for you, and no one who actually understands muscle growth would go two hours a day every day. But go ahead and keep flexing bud. It's pretty funny. Also, Bernie is a commie, and death is a preferable alternative to communism. Bitch.
---
I didn’t. I was logged out for just a couple minutes tho, maybe less
---
LOL You are right, mate!

---
I'll figure it out with the voodoo mon'
---
We played a few hundred hours of that! Unfortunately it's like nails down a chalkboard for me now.
---
You have a problem with people playing the game like they want to? What's next? Forcing them to wear a subscriber badge next to their profile pic and then publicly shame them? That is the most stupid thing I have heard in this sub reddit so far. And that is indeed saying something.
---
Or they could try fixing the problems that kept people from buying in the first place but that’s none of my business
---
 *sips tea*
---
Nah. You guys spent a full two years jerking this game off. This is exactly what everyone said would happen if you stayed along for the ride. They are greedy and evil. Still dont know how you can even be proud of still owning game.
---
The only thing to discover in this game are bugs and bad content.
---
Absolutely not true
---
Do us a favor and sell your rights to a corporation in Indonesia you cronie
---
I agree. They seem to be treating it like a F2P game without it actually being f2p. I'm not even all that pissed at the sub cost. I'm pissed at being told they can't expand the stash box because of technical limitations. Then turning around and telling us that they were just bullshiting.
---
Agree. I’m gonna but a month to see how it works. And get the outfit
---
That's a good point.  It's a cash grab pure and simple.  Any design decisions were approved by the marketing and accounting teams as best for their wallets.
---
What a bootlicker
---
The host doesn't have to be on but a subscribing member does.  So you're paying for sessions on a server.  Part of me feels like it is done that way as servers do need to reset at some point in order to refresh world spawn items and most likely for stability purposes but they could have implemented in a better way.
---
Objectively it does not look like it did in NV. You need to either take off those rose tinted glasses or get your eyes checked.
---
That doesn't mean it looks great or amazing.
---
Apparently.
---
Used to be 2k and then 4k. People farmed it a ton on PC.
---
Conan exiles? I haven't played it but just guessing based on what I know of it. Maybe ARK. Maybe eso. Similar pay structure but at least it has regular good content. I just don't know how they could fuck up this bad, for this long. I haven't played since August aaand was waiting for wastelanders.. idk.. maybe I'll come back for it if I hear it's good but it really breaks my heart to see how far bethesda game studios has fallen. What happened to the developer that rocked my gaming world when oblivion released and fallout 3? I still love the idea of an online fallout but 76 wasn't even close to the right approach. They should have just let zenimax online do it like eso.
---
I don’t agree with this decisions from a business perspective. I would’ve waited for wastelanders or a really solid DLC to introduce it given some of the other issues, but the entitlement is hilarious. 
---
You may be disappointed or expect more, but to call this fraud and unethical is fucking hilarious. Just don’t buy it kids.
---
No disrespect intended, just voicing my opinions. To each his own.
---
Players love helping to spread that cancer to other games.
---
$60 for a broken Fallout game without NPCs is a default state of bending over.
---
Quit the game, immediately, people.
---
That's 10-20 dollars less for your daughter to go to college
---
*manually*
---
Yeah, last week was basically them saying "Fine yeah, we don't actually give a fuck about the cosmetic only thing. Sorry, we just really love seeing how much money we can squeeze out of you."
---
That's a good way to do it! I've got a few things I could send you if your ever looking for something new.
---
I'm pretty sure no scrap decays.
---
And there are other players who have trouble taking out 10. Even if it’s 150k active daily users that’s a healthy number.
---
Apparently when it comes to this subreddit,  they cross the line when they breathe.
---
I blame ZeniMax.
---
RS style is the give you 10 options and you vote on those. Not bad
---
i dont have a radiation shower so i wouldnt know lol but yea it still works just a bit tricky still. the game was like yeah you can place items in your bungalow but the instant you put it in it would go on the roof.
---
They called you a madman.
---
Mine is on a regular floor, several stories above ground.
---
Did that for a bit but there's a bug where the enemies don't respawn and every time you blow up a car you get chased by the whole map.
---
You just spent $80+ to play the same game you already own
---
Atoms are worthless it's online currency it means nothing
---
Yay 25% off a lamp
---
You'll get bored playing on your own in a week
---
Your opinion is unpopular but unfortunately people share similar opinions.
---
*as I'll get down voted I'll try say enjoy your game* :))
---
I just bought the game and started playing with my friends a few weeks ago. Shame..well more room on my storage for other games. See ya!
---
Fuck them all sincerely right up the ass. 
---
They were making plenty of fucking money with the old model of "make complete game, sell game, make profit, use profit to make expansions, sell expansions, repeat until you see diminishing returns and move on to next game." 
---
There is no fucking excuse for this kind of garbage and to prove it look up sales figures for Fallout 4 and tell me they needed micro transaction filth to pay the dev team.
---
you can find videos like this for every game that came out this year. including rdr2 . So I know your really just salty cause you haven't been able to get a crack fix since WoW was lame ( always was IMHO) But you know what? Maybe hopefully all the people who share your but start a sub or a group chat and then have meet ups and you can move past this. It's not fallout 5 it's just a repackaged fallout 4 with the multiplayer they designed for it bolted onto a new environment with some PvP ( that gotten broken because of the complainers who thought it was fallout 5)  Beyond all the footage and marketing; This game never promised to be fallout 5. Really it was just a giant mod for 4 and an expanded far harbor tileset. I knew that going into this and so did a lot of people. We were the ones still playing 4 while everyone else went on to New games. Many people myself included were still playing long after the fanfare died. Those people so shared the idea that this would be cool if I could play with my friends and maybe fight and build stuff together. So they sold us a mini new story and lore just to give the whole bit glue and .. " it just worked!" It was just another fallout sandbox with new paint and some different mechanics and a bunch of random people. It's a great game, sure launch was rough but I've played worse . I've never taken a break and I'm having a blast. I Don't agree with the survival mode leaving but I hope something like that will return. until then I will pay for a private server because I want to hang out with buds or run around blowing things up without having to ruin  others experiences or with my friends.. It doesn't really change the game. Honestly, it will just make later content for free all the sweeter cause I was willing to pay. In the end- it's a game and Bethesda gotta keep the lights on. I get it so I pay and play and when I don't I won't.
---
not the end of the world. unless games are your life- then I can't help you. I'm certainly done trying to explain myself to people with your view. So shout your lungs out till the mods ban you so this sub can be about discussing information and sharing tips and builds . Game related stuff. not a place for people to deal with all their negative emotions and interpersonal whatever by taking it out on one of a million companies that will let you down I'm your life. no product will ever be perfect. Play or don't.  I am having a blast. good luck!
---
&gt;Free shit they put into the game
---
I paid $60 for the game, anything they add should be free especially if they have a microtransaction shop that has stuff like $5 for a staircase, $4 for a gun paint job, $14-18 for power armor paint.
---
Id pay for it if maybe they threw us a couple of legacy weapons, infinite weapon/armor storage as well, and maybe a BJ from Todd. But I don't see any of those happening.
---
Sooo over Bethesda.  I wish gamers would stop supporting this kind of bullshit so they quit doing it.  Doesnt matter how good the game is if they are screwing you to play it.  Thank you Obsidian making The Outer Worlds without a built in gamer screwing mechanism.
---
The Oregon Trail!
---
Thought I would come back  to the game when wastelanders comes out. I then see Angry Joe post a video that there was a 100$ year subscription for the game, I then check Reddit to learn wastelanders was delayed. Game was already deleted when my extended hard drive got corrupted and now it's never gonna be downloaded again.
---
&gt; just because the community suggested a feature doesn't mean the developers that worked on it don't need a paycheck 
---
I can get behind that.
---
But they added items that fix core design issues that lots of players hate and then charged for them. Do you want a quick access point without having to move your CAMP? It's time to pony up. Want to keep that extra scrap? You can now, for 9 bucks a month. It's a thing that I don't think I should have to pay for, when it's an issue that should've been solved by updates. This is especially worse when paired with the fact that they did promise MTX to stay cosmetic only. And the definition of pay 2 win is a little iffy on a game that you can't really "win", but it puts you at an advantage with having a quick access camp and unlimited scrap.
---
&gt;The community has been asking for the ability to play in private worlds
---
Exactly, literally only people excited to pay for single player are the whales who will nuke whitesprings again and again by themselves...great MMO Bethesda lol
---
But I can squat 2x my bodyweight and bench press 1.6x my bodyweight and some noodle arm kid on the internet thinks calling me a neck beard is going to hurt my pride?
---
I don't think so little fella.
---
Bruh I am on your side but I was just saying it’s justified. Personally I don’t agree with it but if you want the game to make it till wastelanders and not have to get shut down then we just have to except it and move on.
---
Everything was much better. Even the little things, like not getting transported back to the entrance when entering WS, or my gat not needing to be reloaded three times as soon as I loaded in. Every time I fast-travelled it...worked. None of that 5-6 tries to travel somewhere.
---
And guess who owns the ammo factory....
---
*features*
---
Seems viable considering you get 1650 atoms a month for $12 when 1000 atoms alone is $10... The weight reduction in junk is good but I don't farm much and even then it was roughly 500lbs. The cosmetic stuff is cool and the tent will be viable for me.
---
I don’t have it... but you get the atoms that alone make it worth the money (in contrast) everything else is just sorta extra lol
---
Is wow f2p?
---
So far what's the advantage of having a solo session?
---
based red shirt guy defaming a corrupt mega corp
---
I do not believe so, I think they come out with Mischief Night

fallout 76 has posted a profit of 50 million. that's after salaries. they're doing fine...despite this game being a massive failure in terms of aaa games.
---
Their game is $454.54!?!?!?! ( assuming the 22% means from the $100 "...for 22% of the cost of that entire game, you can get...") :'D
---
the only time I needed to I had no issues whatsoever because I read the fine print and was aware of just what my coverage entailed. not that it changes anything I said, it's still a product. you're buying a product.
---
but like I said, if you're ok with all that more power to you. you're the big D jones, american, born and raised, with millions to spend. it's really shortsighted in my opinion and does more harm than good, but hey. bugmen.
---
Surprised you missed it.

None of that came true still.
---
Yes yes why not inconvenience 2 people instead of 1.
---
Each item isn’t a line unless it’s unique in some way though. Like you wouldn’t have a line for each unit of iron: you’d just store an item ID and a count.
---
Alright, I'll bite.

I was buying caps every month since this is pretty much the only game I play at all these days, I can afford it, and the camp stuff is a big part of why I play. I figure I'll just sub instead of buying since I'll get the monthly caps on top of the other stuff.
---
Oh man FO76/minecraft Mashup is the only way I'll ever give Bethesda another $.
---
Is it ridiculous though? You pay for private servers on literally any game that doesn't require you to be the server host. You also get more Atoms than every month than you would with just a one time purchase of more than the monthly subscription cost. If you compare it to a game like Minecraft, where a monthly server subscription is $8 USD for bedrock editiion, it's a really good deal. It'd be like getting a server and a ton of *insert name of minecraft currency here" ever month.
---
Not saying that they shouldn't fix the game, but the subscription isn't bad.
---
Powt your gains then, "big guy". All I see are daily posts about fallout 76. Not very impressive. Talk is cheap man.
---
That's honestly the one thing I see about it that redeems it, it's basically more bang for your buck than paying $10 a month for the 1500 atom bundles.
---
This right here has convinced me. I WILL NOT be buying TES6. Bethesda has fucked around for too long. They are no longer for the consumer.
---
Also that sips tea thing made me want to shove a 44 into my skull a pull the trigger.
---
That stuff is optional? I paid $60 for destiny 2 and even more for dlcs. I don’t expect cosmetics In the ever verse shop to be free even after that. Same way in this game. You only paid $60. All the free content is a plus the way I see it.
---
Gonna buy one month and see how it works. Get some “free” atoms and the ranger outfit. Probably end it there though. I don’t generally join random players but doing events with other people is fun and since I have no friends that play this game I don’t want to lose that aspect of it. I’ll try it but can’t see it being long term unless they drop the price or throw in some other free stuff.
---
I've had a guy I recognized 3 times lately. Not a friend or anything (would have been, but bugs). I figure we play at the same times in a similar region. There still seems to be a growing number of low levels.
---
No doubt many high level players play less than say meat week. And there was a definite lack of shops today, probably people checking out the private worlds.  
---
That said I had a quality day on public servers, with nice people and no griefing. Many of them also with 1st tags. Seems the griefers are busy griefing the forums instead.
