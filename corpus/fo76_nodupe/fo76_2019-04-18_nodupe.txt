I have an lvl 50 anti armor sledgehammer with an armor peircing head. It does more damage than a super sledge with around 180 compared to 172 from a super sledge. But i have perks and mutations.

---
---
You are gonna have to start over the keycards and the code are a 1 time use for that server ONLY. Good luck:)
---
I've truly fallen in love with this song. 
---

---
Both the Fallout version and the original. 
---
I used to listen to old school hip hop when I played Rocket League, but because of 76 it's now John Denver, John Prine, Gordon Lightfoot, Stan Rogers, Neil Young and other folky tunes.
---
I mean I always loved those kinds of tunes, they just weren't my gaming playlist. Now I needs me some Country Roads to get my game on
---
I had this issue since the latest update. I deleted my Fallout 76 save file on Xbox and it fixed it. RIP my pictures though.
---
have u found a solution or a macro that is working?
---
NP
---
Nuke Vault 76, the bastards deserve it for kicking you out.
---
I...i need to draw this
---
Well I tracked down 5 outta 8, might aswell do them assuming they dont screw me on fast travel aha
---
i was carrying it. had it out during "the messenger" event near whitesprings.
---
i swapped to a mole miner gauntlet and went insid the whitesprings bunker.
---
after a couple minutes there i checked my inventory and the two shot lever action was gone :(((((
---
actually ruined my drive to play atm...i grinded 25k caps to buy it when the game first came out and it just..disappeared
---
In one of the earlier trailers, or maybe it was the noclip documentary, there was a clip of a player placing a protection guard
---
Give deleting your Fallout 76 save file a try and power cycle your console afterwards. Keep in mind it'll delete your personal settings and photos. I had this same issue plus crashing and this was the only fix for me.
---
What if they hatch and start following your pet Deathclaw like a momma
---
Yeah some of the quests make you run back and forth across the entire map, while other ones will be neatly contained in a walkable distance.  
---
I was just complaining about this the other night because I don't really care for fast travel and it feels like the game was designed around it sometimes.
---
Waste of time, but it's your choice.
---
Oooo I would love to have those
---
No.
---
Nice, haven't seen that
---
Oh yeah. This post? Real helpful for Bethesda.
---
[removed]
---
Why do you need this? Your last post also asked this question.
---
You can craft them into blast mines which do a crapload of explosive damage.
---
Xbox
---
I would but I can't modify the game where others could see it and I'm not knowledgeable about making mods. I just like coming up with ideas.
---
You wouldn’t trust your girlfriend to log on to a game and get a free item?
---
What the hell?
---
All I can say is enjoy it all. My brother and I were excited to play fallout together. We were very close our whole lives even when there were some miles of Earth separating us. Fallout was always a staple in our years growing up.  We we're so excited to play together. I lost my brother unexpectedly this past January due to an aortic aneurysm at the young age of 40, and miss him dearly. It took me quite some time to jump back into the game, as running around without him is intensely difficult to do at times. Enjoy your time together my friend. It's all we can do.
---
Definitely
---
Sometimes I just go and start up Posideon and log off for the karma ;)
---
I would be devastated.  I have a similar explosive rifle and it's my go to weapon. I dont really use any other gun. That would probably make me rage quit if that happened.
---
I got wasted by a Mirelurk Queen at lvl 140 simply beause I didn't know how to fight the damn thing.  They aren't all that common and I got jumped by one and was in a bad spot without stimpacks.  Her acid attack is surprisingly effetive and LONG RANGE. Melee attack was nearly suicidal and any ranged weapon needs to be able to reach further than she can spit acid.  If you can spam stimpacks during the fight, no big deal.
---
I like stealthing up to newbs and putting on an impromptu fireworks show.
---
Really? 95 percent of my stabilizing reagents (mass etc) comes from white springs.  Only thing you can't get there is violet, which you get from fissure prime.
---
To be fair, Enclave Scientists are at least smart enough to go in wearing hazmat suits.
---
The bootlegger's shack has a chance to spawn four. Might have to server hop, sometimes it's scorched or stingwings instead.
---
As far as I know they work fine. My Gauss is also a suppressor. Just don't use it much. And have never used a cryo
---
wait if this was just announced how did i already miss the first egg? im very confused. they gave no notice other than ok now?
---
This is yet another quality of life idea posted on this thread. 
---
Bethesda: "I know what the players want! Beverage crafting and repair kits!!!"
---
I have so many pictures of funny stuff. There is one reference to "we bare bears" in the game. Soooooo much hidden stuff that people never take the time to see. I'll find the pictures.
---
No, I do not have any mutations.
---
I have too many weapons as well but I have 3 armor pieces that reduce weapon weight by 20% as well as the melee perk which reduces melee weapons weights by, I think it's 60% if I remember correctly, so my melee weapons only weight 10% what they're supposed to and my guns weigh the 60% less.
---
Which boss is this again? GW2 has a lot of great stuff in general that bethesda austin should pick up on when it comes to living world and events and world bosses.
---
Lol hit the floor with my bat and blood came out, i was like...whelp
---
I fail to understand this sub sometimes, people are complaining so Bethesda can actually see the complaints and make changes, done lie that the game is good enough to not warrant this. The community team barely exists and is pretty garbage, yet people are showing up telling others to stop complaining? Huh? Where’s the logic in that? This sub can’t decide if it wants any change or not because you keep putting yourselves in a position where you’ll just repeat these dumb posts and nothing happens as a result. Sure I hate spam but if it gives Bethesda a reason to make changes and stop being idiots then I’m all for it, this is truly where the community fails for this game, it’s so divided on what it wants and how it wants it.
---
They are in game already, just not available for us
---
I want the children of atom lights
---
All gone now :)
---
You're a fucking tool. See how easy that is? 
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
And a rough time? Why do you just assume that it's not his fault? The courts don't just take your kids away, despite what deadbeat parents will tell you for sympathy. This piece of shit comes on here looking for praise for apparently being a miraculously shitty parent, seeing as he's playing Fallout all day to drown out his sorrows. Better than drinking I guess. 
---
So yes, I'll kick him when he's down because it's unlikely he's an innocent bystander to some bitch cunt wife with a vengeance made out of thin air. Don't be a grandstanding prick while supporting a shit father. Doesn't make any sense. Get your character together.
---
Epic level sarcasm is the best. Well done sir/ma'am
---
yes..to what?
---
On the shop right now.
---
I use carnivore and I love it. Most of the time I just eat the ionized meat I find if I'm running low on meat from my kills. No more need to plant veggies at my camp unless I want to make adhesive.
---
Sadly, I don't have weapon artisan or any mutations. I just logged back in and my super sledge is now at 118... I didn't change anything from the last time I was playing.
---
So very, very American
---
Hmm. I was wearing this and it's gone.
---
Wish there was a keypad both sides.
---
Or an armoured powered door that opens via spotlights instead of having to use pressure plates. (Think a real automatic door, the glass kind that slide sideways).
---
I wish I knew about Fireproof at lvl 50.... Essential perk for just about everyone.
---
That's a dick move, but actually pretty clever. 
---
Raiders gon be Raiders.
---
It isn't linked to the Weekly. if it was it would be listed as the reward and also players have already done it with no reward of the keg. It is either a reward from Biv or the reward for one of those new hidden Cryptid quests. Speaking of which, there are the four found in the Lowe bedroom. Two more can be found in the Mire, one at the motel northeast of Harper's Ferry on the corner patio table by Boomer (as a note), and at the Toxic something Meat'n'Go shack where the snallygasters show up. The one by Harper's Ferry gives the mounted Wendigo plan, the other gives a mystery meat pie recipe that uses intestines, toxic water, spoiled meat, and other items to make.
---
I need more stuff from Fallout 4. They had good items.
---
Sorry I got someone else to do it
---
Lvl 30 is the lowest I’ve found one
---
Since you find them all all the time how much would you sell one for
---
Why people asking why? :(
---
I mean, this is a basic control option that has been present on all FPS games in 20 years.
---
I want to click once and keep aiming down sight, that is basic, basic!
---
Don't want to be rude....but I might reinstall and play FO4 instead, used to play many FPS but can't handle this.....
---
 I wish there's an easy way to do this on PS4.
---
I mean it was kinda obvious, wasn't it? Only way they were getting closer than it already is was only by hiring Negan's actor to voice itn
---
I would take your offer but I'm on PS4 so it wouldn't work
---
Imagine if you could create a robot to hang out at your CAMP and act like an NPC to other players that pass by....
---
I'm just glad my house is where nobody ever nukes.
---
Hope so &amp; the last mission is the actual sheepsquatch
---
\[Wiki\]( [https://fallout.gamepedia.com/Plan:\_Machete\_Sacrificial\_Blade](https://fallout.gamepedia.com/Plan:_Machete_Sacrificial_Blade) ) says there's a plan, and it drops from some pretty low level events like Fertile Soil and Tea Time
---
That is very true I agree with you.
---
Check under effects u might have the disease that bleeds rads from your wounds.
---
Double the luck, bröther! The mothman has plans for you.
---
Yikes.
---
\&gt; I have Glowing Postules and Rad Worms.    
---
Well there's your problem. Disease cure - problem solved
---
No no I'm saying it's been down voted
---
I did it today and I was the conduit for all three pylons and I only used maybe ~15~20 stims until we beat it. I can get materials to craft those back in like 10 minutes.
---
Downvoted for supporting the game and allowing others to play for free
---
LUL
---
If noone pays, noone plays. Keep that in mind guys, servers and development staff cost money.
---
From reading the ESM, the part about TS shotguns only dealing +12% damage was probably wrong. The damage per pellet is never specified, only the total damage: TS increases both the projectile count and the damage, and so you'd still end up with +100% damage overall, or +25% since the nerf.
---
Unfortunately explosive legendaries do not appear to be fully defined in the ESM.
---
Upvote for sacrificing your marsupial for science, unfortunately I don't have any serums haha
---
The Fallout Store.
---
Had roughly twenty players test it for the weekly for last week for the "Craft Alcoholic beverages" challenge for the week, no keg reward. Also given the number of hidden quests being found now, we might both be wrong and it is in some hidden cryptid quest.
---
There are the four at the Lowe house, one at the motel with Boomer northeast of Harper's Ferry, one at the Monagnah (or however it is spelled) police station on the counter, and one at the Toxic something Meat'N'Go east of the Wendigo cave. Probably are others shown on the map in the Lowe house (where the circles are). One is apparently at Point Pleasant, they often appear as C.M. | [Month]. It is some Cryptid Monthly periodical.
---
Did you log out an in to reset the client?
---
This has been happening to me since the last patch. It doesn’t happen every time, but enough that it’s annoying. Looks like I’ll have to uninstall/reinstall 😤
---
Well said, complaining about complaints and stating the obvious just adds to the garbage dump and helps no one.
---
In case it helps someone else, I was playing when the egg timer expired at 0000 UTC and that egg disappeared but no new egg appeared even after waiting 15 minutes. The new egg only showed up after I quit the game and relaunched to get back into the Atomic store.
---
As I said in the rest of the post beyond that.. It has never hit that hard. I would have noticed in the 600+ runs that I've completed of West Tek.
---
Beyond that - I have used a disease cure as of now, and it is not fixed. 
---
Only now - today, have I run into this issue. You contract both of these pretty commonly, and it's never hit this hard.
---
A little preplanning goes a long way. Suit up when you anticipate a nasty fight, not once the projectiles are already flying.
---
I'm starting to realise that I could make an analogy about power armour being similar to a condom in that regard, but I'll resist.
---
I want Bethesda to add Scorchbeast related items in the atom shop like camp stuff, an icon, statue, or maybe a skin... I don’t know. There my favorite creature in the game.
---
r/BoneAppleTea
---
Would you like to rethink that anti-female statement you made? Judging from your post history, you're going to look real stupid to the next person that looks through it. You can't go parading around as a feminist sociopath and then immediately call women evil, spiteful beings who will keep their children from their father as an emotional play. No woman is going to let you into her pants that way, I think they're on to it by now. I smell a rapist in the making...and if you fail at that, you could always play Fallout all day. 
---
Also, courts don't just take people's kids away and bar them from visitation on a whim just because they feel like it. Just because your deadbeat parent friends spin you that story, doesn't make it so. Welcome to the real world.
---
Next week, patch 8.5
---
No I don't have a link but you can look for recent Bethesda replies
---
Damn, you literally just missed out. The 2nd egg just became available. They gave notice and it was on the atom shop. They just cleared up the confusion about the 2nd egg. I also made a post about the 1st egg the minute it was available. Sorry you missed it. Which is real fkd up because if you dont get all 6, you cant get the 7th day surprise. 
---
F
---
I’ll try to find it and link it here, I really hope the feature makes it into the game.
---
Super fun if you do it naked with a rolling pin 😆
---
Nice, ty
---
LOL, right? Mad because I support the game with a $15 here and there. But they want content as well smh
---
Had a full set of T-51 Armor I was collecting painted with the Woodland Warrior Paint. Disappeared from my stash in the last Update.
---
There seem to be some lighting issues going on right now, but I don't know of any solutions.  Mostly happens on terrain for me but there have been a few posts about it.  On PC.
---
Sometimes the event seems to glitch as we, and the assaultron’s shield will stay down even if all pylons aren’t activated. Happened to me a few days ago
---
Even better!! You psycho. Lol
---
Yeah same. Seems they either were a bit misleading with the day *or* they gave people extra time to get it after a bunch were unhappy they may miss it!
---
Yeah it kinda feels that way.  I like walking around but quests literally send you to the opposite side of the entire map. I don’t mind walking like a town or two over for an item but I really don’t like when I have to choose between spending caps and traveling areas I’ve already seen for an hours
---
And you are most welcome. Enjoy your eggs!
---
How many total unsolved are there? I did 4 the first day they came out. You're saying two more came out yesterday?
---
1. This is NOT a FPS.
---
2. Per the games EULA as posted by Bethesda
---
Fallout 76 does not support the use of any mods, add-ons, or other third-party programs. Please be aware that the use of such applications may result in Fallout 76 not functioning properly.
---
So for what you are asking for. You won't get support from Reddit or the community. Since most will look at it as a game changing mod. Aka a bannable offence.
---
This of course us my opinion and does not reflect anyway in any form in Bethesda, Reddit, or this community.
---
I would suggest looking to modders on their forums. And not the games forums
---
Wut
---
...
---
Oh, check this out:  https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/avg42o/rfo76_is_looking_to_add_more_moderators_to_our/
---
I feel like such an upgrade would require one hell of an upkeep, since it would potentially invalidate a whole bunch of perk cards / items.
---
Fuck man! F :(
---
Sorry to burst your bubble, but those spikes are closer to a porcupine's, probably also a mutated critter. Also the reason as to why the Sheepsquatch wasn't in game was due to its movement. It moved rather frantically and had a bad habit for falling through the ground. It was originally supposed to be at the pylon ambush site along side the imposter. From what the Devs had mentioned it seemed as though the imposter would help lure and fight the actual beast (part of the reason for the mating subroutine aside from the guy's obvious perversion). Given the last minute decision to remove it due to the broken nature, we instead were tasked with hunting down the imposter assaultron. We will be seeing them be implemented in an upcoming patch.
---
Its yours then. Im on a very long drive from Billings Mt to seattle Wa my gpa died in the middle of the night so ill get on n get it to ya when i get a chance
---
No worries it’s all good.  Cheers!
---
You are welcome. Glad it helped! Now display those eggs proudly &lt;3
---
Game over.
---
😁
---
Hey bro. Guess what? I got the leg plan. And even better still have the jet pack. U interested in the jet pack? Offer?
---
lol all good we all ramble. Although I feel you and I also have made posts in regards to the numerous crashes lately, it is easter and they gotta do something for the holidays. It's only a small something too and they probably had it planned ages ago, so doubt it has taken away from any of their other bug fixing and balancing work :)
---
Im kinda with ya on this one, afterward i was like, "thats it?" Then proceeded to scour the area for perhaps additional quest objectives...boo. Dissapointed.
---
——closed—-
---
Tasty :D
---
There is one at Belle hotel and if the one that is at toxic Larry’s meat n go by a camp site count that the two. Would need to confirm both of them.
---
mods are an issue for everyone atm, search before you post my dude
---
Yea I know, I’m gunna keep playing till I got 3 level 200 characters with all the quests in the game done though. U don’t have too play the game like that if u don’t want. You and ur friends can do whatever u want with the game I don’t really mind, just wish I could have some vault dwellers join me for some of my missions.
---
At least so my inspirational perk doesn’t go to waste 😜
---
As people said no. Atom items cannot be traded. Sorry to hear about your issue :(
---
And you are also welcome :)
---
No I wouldn't like to rethink it and I don't give a crap what others think looking at my pay history. This comes from what I've seen and what friends and family has experienced. Very rarely do I hear women complaining that the ex husband won't let them see the kids, unless there's a history of abuse. But you're free to prove me wrong. 
---
Dude notes: I'm to busy at work to play fallout all day. The only woman's pants I care about is my wife's. I can't think of any deadbeat friends (at least when it comes to their kids). Go get triggered /offended someplace else or with someone with less than 5 decades of life experience because you're tactics don't work on me.
---
I live for the thrills!
---
I didn't succeed either.
---
I don't k know if anyone has... seems that everyone is hyped about the mounted heads but the keg has gone silent.
---
Bummer.
---
Mine was in the low 30's too. One of the times I took over Lakeside Cabins and I put up turrets for the defend against waves of whatever. After the attack was done I was looting the cabins and heard the screeching. I spent most of my time in a cabin fighting the scorched while the turrets shot at the SB. Every once in a while I'd run out to the workbench to hit repair all for the turrets. Eventually it landed and I was able to whale on it with my super sledge. It took about a half dozen landings before I could finish it off.
---
Love the map, could you maybe change the colors or make the colors more different. Im partially color blind
---
Yeah delayed until the 26th or something I think it was - not 100% sure on the date!
---
And you are welcome 👊
---
Yea :( well thx for the post. Without it I wouldnt have known at all. Doing a week and saying 5/7eould have been better. Not everyone plays daily or has launcher running for ok ne game 24/7
---
My bad havent been on much lately.
---
When I was around level 50 I ran out of fusion cores in the middle of helping a new player get a leg up. I'm pretty sure by his voice chat he was around 12 years old. I happened to mention i needed to get out of my power armor due to a lack of cores, when he drops a paper bag at my feet containing 50 fusion cores. 
---
Like... He had a shotgun, a 10mm pistol, ammo for each, some meds, some weak armor..
---
And 50 fusion cores. 
---
I asked him why he had so many, and he said he found them when he came out of the vault. 
---
I modded the shit out of everything in his inventory for him. I think I might still have some of those original 50 fusion cores in my inventory now.
---
Huh. Are they posted at the train stations to start them, like the others? Guess I'll have to investigate next time I'm on. Thanks for the info.
---
I get that but the forgot one great holiday..... St. Pattys...lol.... No really tho i know but I wish they could pull it together and a green pa pait would be awesome.....
---
You can say that again
---
Fecking live it up! You winning anyway 🥳
---
I started at the start but got turned off by too many people and what felt like to much happening at the start, (which i really regret now because i see everyones concrete camps and other things theyve nerfed now) but when i cane back on start of this year it was hard to get going but i found a new interest in the game.. i woulsnt of kept playing though if it werent from the help and guidence of some high level players which used their time only to help me. And certain people with the powerplant letting me team up to use there power. A lot of people were worried at first but for the most part the community is awesome. I still dont understand how everyone formed groups and know their roles and play differently depending on if they are with enclave or rebels, but i only have a small history from FO4 and sadly never played fo3.
---
Anyway happy gaming and hope to see you on xbox
---
It's strange to me that you would have that specific combination of diseases for a statistically significant enough part of your 600 runs for you to say anything about it being bugged. Regardless, it is such a non problem in the first place because the game designed an easy to acquire aid item that solves this problem instantly.  
---
At this point this is anecdotal evidence at best, immediately labeling it a bug because you "noticed" something was different is exactly what fueled the "trade stealing bug" hysteria that made people stop trading for no reason. Can we not constantly point out fingers at anything that moves funky and rile people up over nothing in this sub? If you want to actually be helpful you can test it or send a bug report
---
There is a bulletin board at the taxidermy place with notes attached that start a series of unsolved quests where you get the mounted head plans as a reward.
---
Ahh that sucks yo. Next holiday/event, we'll see you there &lt;3
---
Is it just me, or is the second egg hidden?  I tried searching the entire Atomic Shop, and couldn't find it.
---
No you would of had to walk by one and find a note for the other. For all we know they could have more and no one found them yet.
---
Anyone know where they are in the C.A.M.P. menu? Found the bunny but no eggs.
---
Me too. I made sure to be on around 24hrs so I could get it. Then I was like tf bethesda. Then I saw Tweet and had to be a man of the people haha :P
---
This is the true endgame. Learning how to craft your own CS and Jetpacks.
---
Sorry for your confusion. The second egg is now available :)
---
He definitely gives off the same vibe/attitude.
---
Any evidence of this, whatsoever? Or just karma grabbing? Lemme guess...
---
So you simply shoot it repeatedly, and after 20 or 30 shots, it freeze ?
---
Crits have no special freezing effect ?
---
Not always, no
---
Yeah I guess my tip would be don't be afraid to put down a quest for a while.  You'll have so many unfinished quests before you know it, and most of them don't really need your full attention, plus the journal entry summaries are usually a good refresher even if you haven't thought about a quest in months.
---
Also the main quest line is probably the worst offender when it comes to sling-shotting you across the map.  It will also try to take you out of the forest before you're really ready.
---
On PC as well, after the previous update last Tuesday I was getting 0 hits in 3rd person. Updated the custom.ini and at least got that issue fixed. Still having the issue where first sometimes second hit won't register. Pretty annoying trying to get the first strike while running at an enemy and supposedly miss.
---
For carrying over 340lb of stuff
---
Repeatedly check Overseer's Camp.  A lot of people drop stuff off in the containers for people just starting out.  I do that if I'm in the neighborhood it allows me to dump junk/aid items I don't use and hopefully help someone fresh from the vault.
---
Glad it helped. I honestly dont care about the downvotes. I like to get sarcastic about it mainly. Bitter people on this anonymous bs sometimes. Also really awesome lovely cool people. So I try to focus on them. But I'm human and sometimes you gotta tell people where to go lol
---
I was so excited to get the armor that as soon as I clicked the entry that gave me the plans I exited the terminal and made a full set with all my hard earned scrap. Two terminal clicks later and I got the full free one that I had to sell because I didn't need two. I too feel your pain
---
Its because the burrows are not instanced for each team/player. So they don't respawns just cuz a new player joins the area.
---
And I appreciate you! Glad you got your egg! Second one is now available :)
---
Oh god. This bot won't leave me alone. I've 'won' so many times, I'm starting to think it's an elaborate scam.
---
Should be in floor decor in the same section as the death claw statue
---
Hey welcome! Who's winning with their eggs 🕺 second one available now!
---
I noticed last night at West-Tek I was getting rads from mutants. At the disposal site north of WS as well (which has never given rads by the barrels, at first I thought they "fixed" it). Doesn't make any sense.
---
No worries, you are offering information out of your own good-will, so good on you!!
---
Also, thank you for that update, I was definitely worried yesterday’s egg was egg 2, so now I’m relieved!!!
---
The more factual and reality based the one side is the more lies and hyperbole the other side can use and get away with as long as they keep touting the middle road bullshit. If everything equals out in the middle you can go as low as you want
---
Did u get the first one? Second is now out.
---
I'm saying that I've had those two diseases before, but have never had it effect me the way it is right now. It's almost as if it's stuck right now, and being blown out of proportion. Even with a disease cure, it is still happening. But even then - I've never noticed +20 RAD p/s before like that in there. I am taking the same amount of Radiation in my PA as I am when I'm in a Nuke site. 
---
I am assuming it's potentially a bug. I'm gathering information to maybe see if there is something I am not understanding. 
---
If I take a disease cure, and can replicate the issue in every server that I'm in - with nothing but my Mutations.. whether I'm in PA or not.. then yeah, I believe there is an issue. The fact that a level 1 Opossum in Flatwoods can give me 20 RADS p/s.. I think there is a cause for concern. Especially when I have 500~ Radiation Resistance. 
---
How about you stop getting angry, and trying to instigate? I'm not a child, and I understand not to point the finger at bugs just for no reason.
---
But the fact that I can bring my friend - and replicate the exact same setup between us.. and he does NOT receive the same results, yields a potential that there may be a bug with MY Character. The same way that we've seen people stuck being invisible, or invincible.
---
Rather than instigate, and ASSUME that I haven't tested these things - why don't you try and break down the situation? Analyze and maybe try to offer something of use? 
---
Also - why would you assume I have not submitted a bug report? Why would I submit a bug report, without first confirming with people if there was something I am not understanding. But considering I have over 450 hours in the game, I think I am warranted to question the issue at hand. 
---
Furthermore, I submit bugs that I encounter all of the time. 
---
Try not acting like a dog that's used to being beat. Not everyone is here to tear the game down.
---
Thanks this helps a lot
---
I do have iron clad and serendipity just not up fully, Ik iron clad is important to have up im just getting some other some other ones that make my life easier
---
Winning wat?

Happened to my alt on the first entry, server hopped one time and it fixed it though. Guessing you've already given that a whack though?

I bought the new "Friends Welcome" sign, thinking it was a new letter set :/

Read my reply above. I've taken a Disease cure. It has not went away. I am taking +20 RADS per second from being hit by a Opossum sitting in Flatwoods.

How you like those eggs?

Youre welcome. Second is out now!

Modders a have been fixing this in Bethesda games for years. it baffles me how they REFUSE to implement these kinds of changes in every game they release. I’m about to set up the fo76 inventory mod but I feel like I shouldn’t have to go to outside sources and make ini changes to improve what they should have don’t a long time ago. With as much inventory management these games require you’d think they would have done something since fallout 3.
---
No I haven't but I think I figured it out I hit one of the Mr gutsy on the inside a ticked everything off so Im gonna try again tommorow
---
There were a couple things that made me think of Neegan. It's the same idea. Conquest.
---
Yesterday I zoned out during loading and thought I missed the start of the mission when I got around to checking the dailies and saw the camera ones. I spent most of yesterday trying to figure out which of the 30 or so missions/quests/tasks I had active was for the camera.

How does get into alpha site? I found the Portojohn but the button isnt working?

Agreed. That and what's there's is his. But he will share

Did u make it, because 2nd one is out now!

If you have certain diseases, it will cause a reduction in damage of certain weapons. I got fever claw and took a hit to the amount of damage my melee weapons would do.
---
I wish lol. Looking for Gatling Gun (or any decent heavy gun) plans for my gun build, but the only luck I keep getting is hordes of ghouls spawning on my position or running into lv60 Charred Ghouls

"Claim all six to see where this rabbit hole leads." I dont trust these eggs either.

Thanks for this, man. Was curious about this myself and want that uncolored one.

Haha I really dont get down by downvotes. It's just more sarcastic wtf is with people. But i appreciate you and the upvote. Have a good one :)
---
Youre welcome. Second one is now available!

Thanks Friend!!

What about being unable to craft known power armor mods? Is that being addressed as well?

Ahh you're on vacation. You winning life right now. Enjoy it. Unless it's a working vacation. Then forget that haha

Talk about insecure, holy shit. The man was simply having a laugh about your spelling mistake. All you had to do was admit it and move on. Instead, you act like it was intentional then proceed to make a sarcastic remark.
---
That's really it. Just want as many people to get free stuff as possible. We all love free shit right

I want some fusion cores. It's like taking me forever to get 6. Blah.

Try restarting the application. Sometimes it doesnt update. Itll be the first thing on feature, just like the first egg was :)

This.  Run towards them, gives them something else to kill.  Works for me!

Thx
---
The potential is there. There are a couple of Robot Workbenches kicking around West Virginia and they were used in Fallout 4 to craft automatons. 
---
It'd be nice to think we could have robot companions in the future, but I am fairly doubtful it would happen. Might add too much stress to the servers if everyone was running round with an ai companion. 
---
More static robots tied to CAMPs could be a more likely possibility, something to hope for at least.
---
We needed a leprechaun outfit. Matches with the Luck perks yo!
---
Since you would have to be at camp to fix it, wouldn't invalidate imo. Would be nice as a separate buildable that costs like the rad shower so plague walkers can still de-rad at home.
---
fuuuuucccccckkkkk
---
made it 45 seconds in before I realized I don't care.
---
What in my comment gave you the impression that I'm angry? Instead of taking what I said seriously you instead assume I'm trying to instigate something, how about you read my comment again and try to understand what I'm saying instead of getting emotional yourself and downvoting me and calling me a dog. My whole point is that you are the person acting like a victim for basically nothing.  
---
I'm not going to reply to your dostojevsky novel (i did read it) because I'm just wasting my time arguing with someone who is emotional and stubborn and we're going to end up with 15 replies all longer than the first, I'm just going to link this topical thread and hope you understand what I mean.

You are a part of this problem is what I am saying. "What the hell?" "it must be a bug", it's just unnecessary. Talk about it like a normal person, not like you're trying to write a headline for the dailymail.

explosive vents don't work anyway, so you aren't missing anything.

Did you reload your game that refreshes the atom shop when the stuff updates
---
You have to much free time... Get a job
---
I couldn’t find the clip of them placing one(maybe I made that part up, but I’m gonna watch the noclip documentary and check cause now I wanna know if I imagined what I described prior), but here’s a [clip](https://youtu.be/Og3A5yIs3b8)  were 48 seconds in you can see a protectron charging station that is part of the camp.
---
I have seen an entire group who took on the scorch beast queen pause after killing her because some guy said that "Country Roads" just came on. Before I knew it, roughly 13 players were attempting to sing the lyrics in unison.
---
"Aww, they've imprinted on you!"
---
Frens!
---
Work 8-10 a days maybe you should have the right job
---
I think that if you come here and complain day in day out about this game then maybe you shouldn't be playing anymore.
---
At level 47 I doubt you have launched nukes solo. That is fun. I was nervous and stuff the first time but nuking whitesprings and the burrows still has a certain enjoyment level for me. 
---
I nuked the burrows twice today mainly for the other players on the server. At level 199 I don’t need the xp so I just launch at least one a day depending on where people are. The burrows seem to be overloading the servers but hopefully they will sort it out. 
---
A bunch of us drop plans and goodies for low level people and give away explosive legendaries we don’t need to help lower guys and gals. 
---
I dropped all the treasure maps yesterday at white springs just to watch people flip out. Lol.
---
I can't even find it in my build mode. Anyone know what section it's in?
---
It would be nice to see such an addition. They could be either placed on surfaces or maybe have an alternate style where it would hang from a ceiling or roof. Would also be cool if when "turned off" it would just be an empty jar or just the firefly but asleep or flickering rather than a near constant glow.

How about Mr handy farm bots that use fertilizer you assign to them from your stash and they make plants in camps grow faster while passively burning fuel. Also their sawblades could do enough damage to fight off the mole rats that eat my plants by diving under the wall.

I wonder if it's friends with this cosplaying mirelurk I found the other day?

I'm still subscribed to r/fallout just so I can rescue poor noobs that post about FO76 there and encourage them to come here or filthyCasuals, before they get downvoted to  oblivion
---
Idk if its just me. But i am so confused on how the letter helps me find the terminal clues in the quest " That sinking feeling". I feel nothing lines up
---
Ah gotcha, yeah bloodied is a whole different ballgame once you get sentinel or cavs armor that’s Bolstering or unyielding. Serendipity is perhaps the most important perk because at max rank you outright ignore 100% of damage 45% of the time.
---
Update: Okay so it sounds like it might be a matter of timing, luck.  Whitesprings wasn't packed with players and I did get a sizeable mob 20+ ghouls at the golf club netting zero legendary items.  Which is almost unheard of in my experience.  Servers were pretty laggy too so I'm thinking that the legendaries may have dropped much later than normal or would have dropped had the server not been horrifically laggy.
---
In a perfect world people would listen. Sadly this ain’t. I feel you. But it’s best to just take a sledge to their place. 
---
Hopefully when and if they grant pacifist mode to camps. they also REMOVE the build zone from the golf club.  Otherwise it’s just gonna keep happening and no one can break their stuffs.

They created this sub for everything FO76. It has multiple flairs for different posts. I am allowed to post here as I please because I am using it as intended, whether you like it or not.

I’ve only done full what do you lose out on if you don’t do it full?

Right, yeah.  It's just I'm hoping some people will listen.
---
What have the two eggs been so far?
---
Sure, if I'm hunting a Queen I'll go in ready. I agree. However, we don't always have that luxury; especially wandering around and hitting a pack of high level Super Mutants or a Mirelurk Queen (literally happened to me yesterday) means I need to react fast.
---
If memory serves me right, the road map and teasers for the upcoming major update seasons did seem to suggest buildable robots in one of badges. It also seemed that the icon for Wastelanders (a rather peculiar name) shows what seems to be either a settlement or raider camp in the background of the vault dwellers robbing a vault.

Er... it was up for sale XBone - it's sold

It's a much needed cap sink. No others exist in the game at the moment. Fast travel costs are avoidable and not it's not even too necessary. There are no resources exclusive to cap costs, player trading is pretty fucked so most people don't bother with it, and learning recipes only keeps you going for so long. It's just that it would be nice if we had, you know, better cap sinks than an event that's on server cooldown 99% of the time. The FOnline games did it very well. Crafting professions, crafting materials for higher tier weapons that required to either be purchased from NPCs or found in high tier coop dungeons, cars for traveling the wasteland faster, implants, and a decent player economy.
---
Wtf is krama 😂
---
You’ll get the wolf, yao guai, owlet, and radstag heads from those quests. Those and the wendigo head are the only known ones so far afaik
---
Nuka mine under the door mat.

It’s mostly jokey. I agree some content is lacking and some is really fun. 
---
I’m an old man. I remember heading to the store to buy a $50 Nintendo cartridge and getting it home and either beating it in 30 minutes or not being able to play it at all because it was so shoddy. That’s neither here nor there now though because of the expectations of the quality of games now but I’m just tickled pink that I paid for this game and had months of fun with it and the developers are still adding content to it and I haven’t paid anything else! 
---
I’m pretty casual. Few hours a night when I can so its been a fun ride. I just get a kick out of viewing the reddit and one week the game has been saved and is amazing and then the next the sky is falling. It reminds me of when we cheekily tell our family members the aforementioned motto. 
---
It is a great game though. I’ll stand by that. I’ve had moments in the last half year that I’ve never had video gaming before. Honestly, I think the ups and downs are going to be what makes this game a timeless memory for some when all is said and done. I’ve never really played any big multiplayer games or anything aside from the earlier call of duty’s so it’s possible that this game is a complete disaster compared to others. But then my ignorance is bliss because I still enjoy wandering the wasteland as often as I can get to it!
---
I post it on multiple subreddits of Fallout 76 to get the items to the right people. Is called marketing. I am using the features exactly as intended.

It was in the atom shop a couple of days ago, but I think they’ve just removed it :-(

My buddies and I are still searching while doing Biv's dailies. We are also trying to investigate any other hidden quests that were added with the Sheepsquatch update. If I get the plan, I will try to upload an image, a video of me receiving it, where I was, and will then proceed to go C.A.M.P. to C.A.M.P. distributing the kegs, but until then, I can only hope I find it.

What ways the last Easter egg about
---
Ok
---
Spelling doesn't work on you either, apparently. You'd think in 50 fucking years, you'd have some time to learn how to spell the most basic of words. Stunning really. I guess it's true what they say. 
---
Now, more important things. Stop pitying those who don't deserve it. Would you pity a rapist? A murderer? No. So don't pity some jackass who would rather play video games than keep his wife happy or father his child. This is one of those sentences you shouldn't even have to type. Maybe if more men fathered their kids, we wouldn't have your sociopathic glass feminist bullshit that spawned Reddit straight from Hell itself.
---
mods are all fucked up right now.
---
This happens to me every so often. Just a weird annoying bug. If you notice you're not connecting shots, exit VATS and reenter and it will work. It sucks when you need that first sneak shot, but it's life.
---
Do a search, lots of other posts about this.
---
Full gives more xp and I think a better chance of getting the fusion generator.
---
Ah, you're right. Well wish me the best of luck!
---
Same here. \*\*\* Handmade with horrible effects (bash damage, etc.) saving hoping reroll of effects instead of entire new weapon being issued.  At the same time I have \*\*\* Mr Handy arm thing and an assaultron head that I'm only holding onto in case a new weapon is issued. My inventory space will be great once the legendary vendor finally shows up!
---
Sheepsquatch is a better fight imo though. The queen is not hard; she's just a giant bullet sponge that almost certainly requires multiple people to get enough dps on her before the event ends. The sheepsquatch deals actual damage, involves a basic level of strategy, and yet can be soloed if you're good enough. Also takes much less time to set it up.
---
I haven't gotten any replies from buyers because I'm not selling god tier items. FO76 has the largest following so I post here. My past posts here have been successful and many items have sold. I would not use something I was not allowed to or did not use effectively.
---
Getting to be? It’s been this way from the start. So much ridiculous infighting and endless drama.
---
Theyre deathclaw eggs done in an easter fashion. Collect all 6 (one a day) then on day 7 we get a surprise collectible/cosmetic. No one  knows wtf it is for sure. Surprise as I said.
---
Restart client.
---
Good luck!  Keep us posted on any strange going-ons!
---
Do u need all 6 if so I’m very sad
---
I bought the excavator CS shocks plan last week. Good luck farming flux and ultracite.
---
have you tried crying about it?
---
You're not doing anything wrong. Sadly, that's what Survival is at the moment.
---
Yes all 6 to get day 7. Sorry. I can give you a hug for 0 atoms?
---
My general rule of thumb is just 'suit up for any exploration on the right side of the map' learnt that the hard way after walking into a cave and finding a level 70+ chameleon death claw that took offence at my existence.
---
Thanks;(
---
Yeah, I do this every time. It's hilarious and also makes it easy to find it's corpse after too.
---
I *think* I have all the mats required now. Just gotta wait for the plans to fall in my lap.
---
Theres plenty karma to go around.... oh wait
---
I would totally help you but im on XB1 and there is a sub for inspiration that i use let me find the name
---
Well... story and all map exploration is done in 4-5 days so not much content. You can play much slower and spend more time by taking selfies pictures, build useless camp etc, but it won't change the fact that there is no end game content after level 50. FO76 difficulty is also adjusted for 5-7 year old childrens so at least I don't find it any entertaining. Pretty much all the game mechanisms are also broken or dull. Economy is total flat, PvP is just a joke, there is not much story or exploration, PvE difficulty is joke, game is still full of bugs, servers lag, rewards are really bad etc.
---
Of course, after growing up in WV I sing along with it but I'm a big fan of "I Didn't Know the Gun was Loaded" and "Crazy He Calls Me".  Also like "Anything Goes" but Ella's version is better.

From what I hear, a player found one of those "Cryptid Monthly" notes at the Point Pleasant. Additionally, I could've sworn the two recent ones (One at Toxic something's Meat'n'Go, and one at the motel with Boomer) were shown on the map at Lowe's house. Perhaps if you investigate the locations shown you may find other side quests.
---
I'm beginning to think that some of the low number of legendary drops are a result of flaky servers.  If the servers get real laggy, I wonder if the RNG legendary mechanism won't have enough time to run it's course or takes forever to drop a legendary. Kind of like when the servers get crappy and you get the spinning arrows that usually result in an empty loot box or enemy because the RNG simply timed out.
---
The other players ARE the NPCs!!! Join up together to build a better Appalachia!

*Immediately gets shot in the face*
---
I do not see any diseases listed.. would it show under stat effects?
---
To be fair, what you send easily sounds like you're saying it with a negative connotation. I'm hardly assuming what you're saying...
---
That one pops up behind the whitespring pool too. One time it dropped on top of another random spawn and mannequin ended up holding a dead body under it's arm like a jacket.
---
So if this is true why is it past 9 p.m. eastern time and still not there?
---
That would be great.
---
&gt;Well, if you check the bodies it seems they sent 3 scribes, so... lets send in three scientists from the Enclave, three medics from the Responders and three technicians from the Free states and see who does better, shall we?
---
Definitely the technicials from the Free States.
---
I don’t understand how I’m not hitting Mole Miners with a giant ass gauntlet but they can hit me with their little fucking no range paws from the same distance, on top of getting stunned from melee hits, which just adds to the list of annoyances
---
And when they do that. Can they stop one shotting the legendaries in Uranium Fever too?
---
Thanks
---
i am trying to figure out why you would want to this fetcher do you only have 1 finger on your right hand or something.
---
Anytime!

People who are so eager to spend a real money to this train wreck here in Reddit must be fake accounts owned by Bethesda employee or just fanatic Bethesda lovers.
---
I've been shopping at Whitesprings Vendors for discarded legendaries since I couldn't get any legendaries to drop as of late.  Some neat stuff can be found once in a while in the midst of mediocre legendaries.  One way to ease the pain of having horrible legendary luck.
---
I didnt ;-;
---
Ugh Ella’s version is WAY better! I wish they had kept it instead of whatever artist they switched to.
---
Okie dokie
---
Goddamn work! 
---
It's not just you. I bought two explosive vent mods last month but they still don't work.
---
For now. I really hope they improve upon it in the future though. Great location I think it may be a good idea to add a event there aswell in the future to make it more interesting. 
---
But yes this is it for now. Aparantly its been in the base game and they just unlocked it at the date so who knows when they stopped working with it and said ok its good enough for release.
---
Like they said on the Pax stream anything you see in the game or that they release have the room for improvement. And they’re looking for out suggestions and apart from the repair kit disaster I think they’ve listeneed pretty good so far. With adding renaming and in future legendary vendor and player vending machines aswell as vaults.
---
Get hold of FO76Edit and then check under "Instance Naming Rules". I think one name is selected from each Ruleset, and the list order and YNAM values decide the priority. It's pretty messy.
---
It was a limited time atom shop item, it got removed like two or three days ago
---
I'll gladly take the wanted lvl and probable face kicking (these guys tend to be those running the op builds) that comes from nuking their camp over and over. Come to think of it. I need to get that new fat man from this weeks challenges to make the process more fun.
---
Well it's the Cole Porter version which is the original but yeah Ella's is awesome. Wish they had some more of her in the song list.
---
Man now you guys are all getting me hyped 🤣

last patch seems to have brought back some bugs again. 🤦🏻‍♂️

No prob bob :)

The sheepsquatch is also mentioned in a terminal inside a house at Welch, though nothing came out of it
---
I am 100% experiencing this as well OP

Yeah how much do you want for it?
---
Yes! Filthycasuals is the place to go to relearn how to put the play in playing  :-)
---
So build sentinel armor with a few bloodied weapons maybe instigating for black powder?
---
Or it could, you know, work as intended.
---
That's not even slang, dude. It's literally just using a completely different actual word rather than the correct word. That's not slang whatsoever.
---
I'm not acting like I know your entire personality. Just off this post alone, I can tell how insecure you are when it comes to spelling and such.
---
The guy wasn't even being a grammar nazi. He literally just said that your mistake made him laugh. If you think anyone correcting others in English is bad, you're just trying to live blissfully ignorant. People like you who can't take minor corrections maturely are fucking jokes. And no, it's not a worldwide feeling, because most people would simply acknowledge they made a mistake and move on.
---
Hi, the same people were not saying those things.
---
I usually just look at their profile to see what all achievements they've gotten. You can usually tell by that. If I feel like they're a legit low level I hop over to them with a kit of supplies and a thumbs up

shotguns still break after like 100 shells through them so i double up whenever i can.
---
(the pump specifically)
---
It just prolongs the life of the item. Still needed imo
---
Every low level I come across I leave 10 purified water and 2 stimpacks, it’s not a lot but I know I would’ve appreciated it

WAIT I JUST MY PSN MEMBERSHIP I GOT I THINK

I always try to help out the low levels either by gifting them things or by showing them stuff about the game.

I think having a solid community inside and outside the game helps promote Fallout 76. I really love the game and want to see it continue on it's upward path.

I’m glad I saw your post. I just used the PS4 remote play app on my phone to log in and claim the free eggs. I’m sure PC and Xbox have something similar.

I’d rather not comment.
---
Not really, the white wolf hat is common, mascot items are uncommon and imposter items are rare
---
Isn't fix it good for armor only?
---
Actually interestingly enough one of the recently found quests for the cryptids (can't recall which one it was) actually references a girl named Ray or something who just moved into a new house in Welch and that the guy who was writing it was sorry he never got the chance to go see it before the bombs dropped.
---
Okay 😂
---
when the game first came out there was a glitch where high level players couldnt kill low level ones. least the damage was almost none.
---
i remember i had this problem as a level 100. id lose any fight with a level 20-30 because i simply couldnt hurt them.
---
While i appreciate the post, please use the spoiler tag next time.
---
3 k.
---
That's pretty well it; gameplay-wise, it's not super engaging unless it's been nuked. I'm actually more intrigued by the mention of the Pioneer Scouts by one of the Burrows Boys; seemed to indicate the Burrows Boys were ex-Scouts (not sure if they were all kids who ended up in the Burrows, or if some were parents; I'd guess the former). The way I see the dungeon, it's a lead-up to the next big set of quests were getting in May, which made my run through feel more important.
---
Honestly, I hope they do. We need challenging content. Right now it does not exist in the game.
---
Second one came about just a little over an hour ago! (8PM EDT)
---
Totally do! @autoaxe.artworks  :)
---
Yep how much ?
---
Yea... Read the sub about burrows being easy, figured it was the level 120+ people with TSEs bitching.
---
Booted fo76 up half hour ago. Took less than 20 min to go through the burrows, one 3*, one 2*, but both dropped 1* junkie weapons for me. Cool to see multiple legendaries but damn, I'm not a top tier player, I avoid pvp because I get my ass handed to me, and this was EASY. And this "dungeon" was a cake walk solo.
---
For reference, my build is crap. +30% melee, 20% rifles and pretty much it. Most my perks are around non-combat and it still wasn't difficult.
---
Rather than 'upgrading' the shower I think having an additional CAMP item, may it be the autodoc (as suggested), something akin to the 'sulfur whatchamacallit' in The Whitesprings gazebo or another 'unique' item would be more... elegant?
---
The concept however - means of ridding oneself of disease via CAMP activator rather than chems - would be a nice QoL addition.
---
My time is 7:17
---
Dope I'll check it out!
---
Oh trust me, i'm hyped as well for anything we will be getting. I mean just look at Nuclear Winter, which is apparently going to winterize the map. Maybe if we're lucky a new throwable -cough- snowballs -cough- could be added.
---
again. do whatever you want to do. I'm not your mom, i was just trying to help you weirdo
---
It is quite blatantly channeling Negan.
---
Well put 8PM EDT to [whatever timezone youre in] into google and that'll tell you. 8PM EDT = 10am for me 😐
---
The-mad-bat-13
---
Then my apologies. I honestly didn't get that sense from what you wrote. But I can see how it can be taken that way. More so since that's what you said it was about.
---
It came across as me as an attack because it came across as you putting me on one side.
---
Unfortunately, I missed the first egg because I've been busy with work. Guess I'll be missing out on the exclusive item. :(
---
haha yes, definitely that one too
---
There's a VTU Jacket &amp; Jeans that looks like a varsity jacket. You can usually find one in the frat house on Fraternity Row, the one you went to for the Nukashine quest. Worked for me.
---
Perfect
---
You are correct.
---
You won’t be able to build sentinel armor, it’s a legendary modifier. If you’re playing bloodied you’ll want: 
---
Combat armor or marine armor with Bolstering(+35 damage resist while low health) cavalier(15% damage reduction while sprinting),
---
Bolstering sentinel(15% damage reduction while standing and not moving),
---
Unyielding (+3 to each special stat besides endurance) cavalier,
---
Or
---
Unyielding sentinel 
---
Keep in mind that these numbers are per piece, so with, for example, 5 pieces of Bolstering sentinel armor you’d have +175 damage resistance AND -75% damage while standing and not moving. It makes you really hard to damage.
---
Some of these sets go for 40 thousand to 70thousand caps if you buy them from other players
---
You can always farm for them though
---
Apparently some guy's datamine revealed that there will be some Easter bunny mask (with a missing left ear) and maybe an outfit (he didn't mention one, but who knows) on the seventh day.
---
There's the VTU Jacket and Jeans you can find on the Nukashine questline. That's my guess anyway.
---
I know😖
---
This is 100% entitlement on display.
---
Spoilers yo. I'd already figured it was something bunny related but I rather not know and be surprised. Each to their own, but I don't look at datamined anything. I wait to see it and enjoy it :)
---
Nukashine
---
Most anticipated: rerolling character. Hopefully will make it more fun to replay
---
1. Expanded Cryptid Stories (Released and TBA) 
---
2. Stash Expansion was needed. 
---
3. Dungeons
---
The durability of the weapons is a joke in this game, I’m all for derogation but I have to repair almost every weapon I carry pretty much hourly and I swear it’s getting worse.
---
That's the elevator *out* of the silo. The actual entrance to Site Alpha is located north of the National Isolated Radio Array and has its own map icon.
---
All Vats Weapons is suffering this issue. Gets worse as you use vats in each server.
---
thing about junkie's is that one addiction makes it better than 90% of legendary effects. And alchohol is everywhere. 
---
If you want to know where to get some good chems, In abandoned bog town there is a trailer park which spawns 10 or so drugs loose, and has a number of containers, the whole town is littered with drugs if you look around, Tons of buffout, and decent amounts of psycho and med ex. It also has several places Ex-cell can spawn.
---
Boos question... what is t used for now? I kill a lot of firefly
---
Right trigger shoots.  Again, make sure you have the right ammo!
---
Absolutely this! Desperate for more of the same though lol.
---
Which one is better, the answer is yes.
---
that's good to know thank you. I though maybe there was another bobble head glitch or something then I thought they could have just been spamming heals but o didn't see any animations and didnt see there health bar even move.
---
Lost my Assassin/Explosive Lazer gun, was my all time favorite gun. Would never drop it and it never left my inventory. One day I repaired it to full closed game and reopened to join party as another character. When I went back to my main my baby was gone.
---
That was on my grandads license plate
---
Eh for all I know I could be mistaken and the mask could just be a new item separate form it. Honestly I had been hoping we would get like a deathclaw plushie or be visited by a deathclaw with bunny ears and an egg basket.
---
My buddy even suggested a unique supermutant in a bunny costume prancing around with a basket of mini nukes painted like eggs "handing" out eggs. Honestly I like that idea.
---
Why are some people so hateful? Smh
---
Stripe!
---
Why?
---
I’ve noticed vats seems to have become less and less accurate as time goes on, I pretty much only use it as a recon tool to find enemies now.
---
That's it sadly
---
One could say the same about the shower and the relevant perks/chems.
---
If fact such an item already exists in The Whitesprings gazebo.
---
Is the Atomic shop working for you at the moment? All I can see are the items I’ve purchased and nothing else?
---
It's an event in Elon Riverlands. The boss is a large doppelganger of the targeted player and named Legendary 'player name'. Can be hilarious when a real random name is picked so you end up fighting a Legendary Key Farmer or Legendary Hmmmmmmmmmm.
---
Slightly less dangerous though.
---
Lol this sums it all up
---
If you're gonna nitpick, find something decent.
---
Idk but I would like to enjoy using for other things.
---
I run a grog axe and they took away weapons artisan for it (it willy only repair to 100%). Makeshift weapons is a must. Pump action is my other weapon of choice and it breaks quickly even with 200%. I agree with the vault dweller above.. The rate weapons break in this game is asinine
---
Yeah I know, I'm not that serious. That's why I added yo haha. Could definitely be a separate item or what we're getting. I am hoping for a full outfit though. But I did buy that easter bundle for my 2nd character which is a female. So she got some items. My main got the friends welcome sign haha
---
Yes now this is an awesome idea.
---
Too spicy for most with them there downvotes. Find better things to nitpick.
---
Same
---
Damn that sucks... I'm sorry that happened. I assume you already did this, but have you tried logging out and logging back in? 
---
If that doesn't work and you're on PS4, I have a level 45 2-shot lever action rifle you can have for 500 caps.
---
VTU Jacket and Jeans of the VTU Tracksuit. The jacket and jeans are in Frat Row like everyone's saying and inside the VTU proper
---
I'm not on rn. In bed trying to sleep some. Try close your app and reopen. Otherwise check later :)
---
Go back to Van Lowe's Taxidermy. There is a board on the wall somewhere up on the 2nd or 3rd floor. On that board are 4 notes you can read to start 4 of the Unsolved quests. I just did them all last night and got the Owlete, Wendigo, and Bear mounted heads. The one with the Meat Pie gave me some useless chems that I just ended up selling.
---
you cant stop me
---
Don’t remember where it sends you but fast travel to vault 76 before going further north. It will save caps too.
---
yeah I remember that I had that alot of the time In  the begging it was terrible and what made it worse is no one had tse weapons at that point or at least I didnt. i love the game even with all the backlash and other stupid stuff they was ment to add or fix months ago but I'm starting to get tired of it all now.
---
Explosive vents are supposed to amplify the landing impact damage from power armor. However in FO76 There is no landing impact damage, so explosive vents are multiplying by 0- even if they technically work, they work on nothing, so they do nothing.
---
&gt;Really? 95 percent of my stabilizing reagents (mass etc) comes from white springs.  
---
I get way  more of  if all from Morgantown when it's nuked.
---
I cleared it out with my level 30 fixer. And just face tanked the enemies. They are just normal ghouls, and they don't even swarm you in notable numbers.
---
The whitespring clubhouse is scarier. Than the dungeon. 
---
Ok, the room with 4 col gutsies' is scary when they all spawn with their armor piercing anti tank rifles and are standing in spots they can all shoot you. If they spawn with lasers, well.
---
I've had settlement defences where 10+ of the things spawn, and that is scary.
---
Oh there was an invisible assaultron, those can be a nuisance. 
---
The Imposter bot was an epic fight where you had to do different things, simple things, but it was slightly more challenging than standing there hitting the enemy with your fists.
---
Depends just how often you want to repair.
---
Restart your game.
---
Account is 7 days old and you’re talking shit
---
You can just switch dromedary out when you need to eat?
---
Nah
---
Maybe it’s all the hacked/duped weapons being removed from the game?
---
I think I've dropped maybe 3 of them in the last month or so.  You don't see them a lot, but they're not especially rare.
---
If you have the space, they do come in handy on occasion (freezing the SBQ or the imposter sheepsquatch).
---
Reddit does not make it possible to edit titles, so you will have to post again with a longer, more descriptive title. 
---
Thanks for the response I’ll probably sell it
---
How far down was the queens health
---
Oh, look at that. Instead of showing some proof of your rant you instead want to focus on my spelling. Boo Hoo. I'll wait an extra second or two before I close my eyes to sleep tonight so I can say that I lost sleep over this. 
---
Show me some proof of your rant or go back to your room. Adults are trying to have a conversation here.
---
Don't worry, the plushie bunnies will keep us safe. :3
---
Everyone’s Special And Delightful?
---
If you haven’t seen the birdwatchers spot up in the northwest corner of the map, do yourself a favor and go now, and then wait for night.  
---
It’s near the vault 51 that appeared, it has the “birdwatchers note” if you want to look for it on the ign fallout 76 map
---
Probably not. There’s no mods for under armor.
---
You learn plans to improve them, giving you minor protections and boosts to a few specials, depending on the type of under armor and what level you improve them
---
The levels, not in order are standard, treated, resistant and shielded, I think,
---
Not in game yet.
---
Ah, got it
---
I know. Some people are trying to point me to a sub that only trades. I get the gesture, I'm just standing my ground against the majority down voting my post and saying I shouldn't use this sub for this purpose. There's too much hostility towards trading here. Have a nice evening/day.
---
Understandable have a nice day
---
It was. But they said it needed more time to be tested
---
Hey, anyone is having this?..when consuming rad-x all my mutations stop working for the durations of the rad-x effects?...another annoying glitch from bugthesda.
---
I'd pay that.  With my current setup hers showed up at about 600... can't remember what my life was at.  But I'd gladly take a look at your setup, there's probably something I could do better
---
2500!
---
Why did the player in your party attack back? Confused sorry😢
---
Ok, and what's the Deathclaw egg under?
---
To be fair, deathclaw island is in the newb zone where everything else is level 10 or less, so running into a level 21 deathclaw is actually terrifying if you aren't ready for it.
---
I got there at the beginning, so it was full. If you think it was her healing cycle, I am aware of that, but I was killing her scorched creatures (zombies?) for a while until they magically stopped dying and started healing.
---
Full completion gives more xp and seems to increase your odds of getting a legendary item as a reward.
---
Tangentially, is FO76 good for someone who isnt much of a gamer? Also w/o having to add to many mods to get a fun, casual experience.
---
I ask because I'm trying to find a game for me and my partner to play. I've played a lot of FO3 and 4, but put 76 on the backburner because of how buggy it was when it released.
---
me and a buddy around launch had to jump more than a hundred times combined before we could kill evan, sure would have loved him being instanced back then
---
Floor decor I believe
---
It's there now. Thank you :)
---
Ok thank you!
---
I can't, actually. It's a disorder.
---
That is it, for now.
---
About as rare as a double rainbow.
---
Sorry. Got offer for 3k already.
---
This just proves my point, that the game is broken.  I have my own workarounds, but they shouldn't be necessary.
---
What I meant was, I use soups to eat and drink at the same time. What I’m really asking is, are soups affected by the Dromedary perk?
---
Sorry to hear of your loss. Whatever is convenient for you I'm sure I'll still be around.
---
Or people could leave messages in them too!
---
I read this too fast and was hoping for camps with turtles...
---
Ah ok. Th for letting me know
---
The 829 damage is not default, but close enough. 600 is about default too, but adrenaline perk in agility allows 60% more damage after 6 kills. It lasts for 30 seconds, and resets on kill adding damage. It's close enough to be being default when I can ninja vats and instant kill most enemies, definitely being scorched under a scorchbeast. Even better, Gun Fu is 10%, 20%, and 30% per kill in vats and switches targets on kill. Nerd rage is also a must in intelligence. I stopped using Bloody mess 3 in luck to use serendipity so I can survive way longer. It doesn't matter having super high damage if you can't hit them fast enough.
---
Nope! I really got to love that song. The Fallout 76 version by Spank is specially awesome!  
---
I'm writing a theme and variations with it
---
You are very welcome :)
---
3000 ! Ok what’s your psn?
---
I assumed it had to do with the amount of power that’s was outputted seems still worth to do fuck completion for the legendary chance
---
I was uninformed, thank you for clarifying. The version still "Stank." LOL
---
Flatwoods monster is the only alien at the moment,  I know that's not what u want but that's it
---
Yes they are affected by it
---
This is the first time I’ve heard of these rumours. I believe Ox here, don’t know why but I have a feeling he’s the victim here.
---
I want a pet turtle with bags and stuff to carry more junk now
---
Oh, I get it, sorry, not sure
---
I 16x corn soup up whenever I hit my base, lol
---
I'm seeing double! Four Krustys!
---
Yup.  Your point? 
---
 I grind these challenges every day/week for atoms &amp; the fact that there's challenges that require equipment not yet available, the players should be compensated. I'm not saying to throw us a ridiculous amount, but to simply compensate the amount of atoms not attainable due to development error. 
---
We payed money for this fucking game &amp; atoms challenges are a part of the game, so yes, we're entitled.
---
That is exactly what I was thinking.
---
I'm only L43 but if you ever need some extra assistance, feel free to hit me up :)
---
I'm fine with that just wanted to see if someone has seen one or not. I just like looking in the guide book and seeing what I find randomly
---
Yeah, it's still in. I reported it a while back and I feel like they're just ignoring it. I was able to replicate it semi-consistently with an automatic tesla gun. Got it twice in one day on Monday
---
/r/unexpectedBillandTed
---
If it's thirst stat it affects it.  But hunger/thirst stats get outscaled so easily due you being able to either farm the hell outta crops or monster's meat.  Carnivore is more aggressive play though in comparison to herbivore. So the perk/emotes related to hunger and thirst becomes irrelevant at that point.
---
Yes
---
Yeah I've been playing about a week now and up to lvl 25 and I havent changed my mind. Game is still top 3 for sure for me
---
What happened to the OP is shitty, but come on -- workshops are a PVP thing. Killing someone who has a workshop is not "abuse."  It's not "on par" with that. One is wrong, one is part of the game as it is intended.
---
Bro its 10-20 cents, chill and put a dime in a jar for every daily you miss.
---
I’m moving away from my vats build as it’s so unreliable with things like that
---
I scrap all I find except my main cryolator. I keep 1 of every weapon if it's worth keeping of course.
---
Dude you there?
---
Mods auto scrapped when a new one is added and old will for ever be gone
---
This one is less a random spawn and more a guaranteed spawn. But you have to be fast- the death claw will happily slaughter them all in short order.
---
Goes great with yao guai bacon!
---
Hornwright HQ in Charleston has an air purifier with a port for  an ignition core, a tinkers bench to make one and computer files mentioning the air purifiers.
---
There is supposed to be a quest to make an ignition core and put it in the protoype at Charleston hq, but i haven't figured out how to trigger it.
---
Still patching patches from patches being updated and patched.
---
Mods are 1 time use items. If you add a different chest mod, the jetpack is gone for good.
---
What I was referring to is where people would team up and have one person sit at a workshop and another would travel to where the workshop owner was. The person waiting at the workshop would contest the workshop and the other would immediately kill the workshop owner.
---
Since you’re such a smart lad, what’s the point of emotes at all then? 
---
Maybe just maybe it’s a matter of preference.
---
Besides, using the mic means you have to occasionally listen to dumbasses like you speak, and that’s just not worth it man. It’s hard enough reading what you type.
---
Artisan for 200% during repairing while combat wise is gunsmith. For best results
---
I really, really hope I get pastel-colored baby deathclaws on Easter.
---
Butcher’s bounty FTW, even if they are killed by the death claw you can still get meat
---
Plastic is easy. Hit Bolton Greens. Clear the pool table and the pool equipment. Run directly north to the cat house. Take all the bowls. Hit Morgantown HS then Watoga. There are other places you can go, but that's a really fast route.
---
Need to put the onyx one in fire and then you can become the Mother of Deathclaws.
---
It’ll save me from having to sign in lol. I never even play anymore. I open the shop to see if there’s anything good/new. Go back to the main menu and stare at it and then exit out when I start thinking about playing the game. (I won’t use money to buy anything, I have saved up atoms)
---
99% of YouTube "content creators" can go fuck themselves sideways with a super sledge.

---
Not meaning to imply anything about Bethesda, but I can't wait to see what modders do with this world. I'm replaying FO4 to build with some new mods and I have to admit that I frequently miss Appalachia's landscapes, atmospheres, and POIs. It sounds like Burrows is another example of a cool place that modders can do a lot with.
---
Not just weapons, it's PA and armor mods as well.
---
I don't recall which off-hand, but they can randomly drop off certain high-level enemies.  The base Cryolator isn't particularly rare.
---
Known issue, many posts.
---
actually I don’t mind this, I was pretty bummed out that I would miss the second egg today because my internet provider shut me off for a missed payment, should be back up tomorrow so hopefully I can get the second egg and not lose out on the surprise
---
Had this problem since beta. Alt-tabbing in and out of the game a few times usually fixes it for me.
---
I'd be happy with handprint readers on both sides, for me and teammates.  And just like I do now, I could use a terminal to lock the doors open if I'm feeling super friendly to strangers.
---
1. Stash space
---
2. Crafting whiskey
---
3. 1400 cap pool
---
They didn't take it away.  Grognak's Axe, for whatever reason, never received the benefits from Weapon Artisan.
---
That's what I'm using! I feel like it might only be that weapon since no one else is posting about it on here anymore. Unfortunately, that's my only weapon, besides my garbage two shot plasma rifle.
---
Still interested?
---
Yesss please!
---
But did u get the free egg
---
I am stuck at getting a max of 50FPS. I have way above the recommended specs. Is there any way to fix this? Any help is appreciated.
---
Don't play survival mode if someone has assassin gear on it will lower your damage to nonexistence. They should ban that type of enchantment in standard world not survival. Imo
---
I take it back. 
---
Totally bugged.
---
+karma
---
Sorry for the late reply
---
Well, less of a habit than a weird and unfunny joke, but I like to run up to other people with my binoculars and just stare at them. Freaks people out sometimes
---
Where is it in the atom shop? I don't see it
---
I agree, but I'm still gonna do it
---
So I just equip the perk card for no reason then run makeshift to make it work. Stoner moment....
---
Yeah, I thought it was the tesla. It also seems to be triggered especially often by super mutants - 2/3 of the time it was mutants, 1/3 was robots. Might just be very tanky enemies in general if it occurred to you during the SBQ event
---
Ha, agreed. In tact I have a checklist of shit to get done before I join now.
---
Should be the very first thing in featured. Have you closed your app and relaunched it since it dropped. Sometimes that helps :)
---
Haha that would be fun
---
Thank you
---
Black Powder Rifle, represent!
---
I literally just made a post about the damage bug still persisting. They fixed it back in December and brought it right back after the holidays. I've not seen it "addressed" since. Hopefully your issue is more temporary, but I literally just wasted 1000 rounds at the Scorchbeast queen when everything became invincible/insta healing.
---
 cant believe how long this bug has persisted since the last patch
---
That's really stupid that they only do these for 6 hours, I really want whatever that surprise is, I hope it just rotates throughout the days maybe.
---
I turn off radios everwhere too but for footsteps. Nothing more annoying than trying to hack a term and getting a pipe wrench to the back of the head. Also addicted to dish rags, idk why...
---
I agree, everyone does it though, it’s the only way to recoup what you’ve lost.
---
I’ve acquired both that have been made available so far
---
Yes, got my second just a bit ago. I do not know what time zone the game clock is based on but I believe the eggs change over at 8 p.m. EST.
---
They’re made in Virginia though
---
No they do it for 24hrs. The first was up for over 30 though!
---
I've never seen anything outright invulnerable. I'm used to the damage bug where enemies instantly heal the damage you drop on them, but if you swap to something heavier (like my gatling plasma) it out damages them.
---
But to have every single mob in a nuke zone be invulnerable...?
---
We were wondering why the nuke zone was completely empty a few minutes in, and that's because *nothing* would die after the initial spawns. This damage bugs are easily the most frustrating ones you can run into.
---
Xbox one has a built in lfg system, all you have to do is post "sheep" and your server will be as full as a tick on a deathclaws ass before you can count to 10.
---
Anytime thanks for the loot!
---
Start a new character. And support it.
---
It just drives me crazy that they fixed the issue back in December only to bring it back right after the holidays and have done nothing to fix it. I took off for the holidays and was extatic that I could just full auto and lay waste to anything with enough shots. Now... 😑
---
Im on the edge of a cliff
---
oh man bring it!!!
---
Yeah, I'm not falling for whatever click bait this is
---
Ring the service bells repeatedly. I need service damn it.
---
On vats I haven't really had that prob but normal melee swinging hits fail to register correctly sometimes. Not an overwhelming amount of the time but is noticeable. I think the mobs block but just don't have the animation so it seems like a miss
---
Lol
---
No you cant
---
I don't know why you're getting downvoted, this is hilarious
---
try using a water filter on toxic - it might make it dirty, and then a 2nd filter might purify it.
---
I have found that to be so with several different building products. However I've noticed I just go back into the build menu and put my item back out and that doesn't change the account so if I can build 5/10 I've only used five I want to cycle the sixth one it will stay at 6 / 10.
---
I've noticed xbox isnt having much problems but pc players are. But that's just from personal experience
---
I hear at work and have contain the urge to sing it aloud like the crow meme 😆

I have to shoot every car I see.

Can't thank me for much  ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

Yeah , it's dissapointing to see people on this sub try to defend the content. I found it dissapointing in every regard but god the excuses people will come up with for Bethesda.
---
 "Oh it's not meant for high level players"
---
 "You must have OP legendaries" 
---
"The good content is coming later"
---
My computer has been broken for a few weeks so it would be cool if this was a thing
---
I lost 2 lever action rifles this way. The first I found on my own, then after being mad, went on marketplace and bought a replacement. That one disappeared as well. I noticed a non legendary otherwise just like it showed up, didnt remember finding one, and looked my new gun was gone.
---
Yeah it's why I don't do the event anymore. Why should we drop a bag at a public event anyways? Only so people lose their stuff and have to play more.
---
Oh no! One extra button to push to get rid of the news.
---
Of all the things to complain about, this is the most fucking pathetic of them all.
---
The cost of traveling for the quests used to annoy me but I decided to just get over it and work my way around things in order to save some caps. Some of the quests will reward just about the travel cost of caps
---
 in caps at the end of the quest.
---
What a lovely person
---
Not inviting them to my parties smh
---
It’s fair game.  But I only take when others have taken mine.
---
Things dont always suit us. That's life unfortunately. Sorry you missed it though, I know how that feels. And yes it sucks.
---
I've used it to distract the scorchbeast from time to time doesn't always work so don't depend on it.
---
Same :)
---
I would say complaining on the interwebs about someone complaining on the intranet, would be considerably more pathetic.
---
;)
---
thanks man very helpful
---
I didn't log in until right before I posted (around 9 est).  Just restarted my xbox and logged back in and now its there.
---
Wondering how much other stuff I missed cuz it didn't restart the Xbox, not that I should have to.
---
This challenge is for the camera that was supposed to be released this week but was delayed by Bethesda. You can't currently complete the challenge.
---
Ah great to know, thanks for the answers!
---
I agree, I could easily just make and carry enough soups with me to be well off. I’ve had Dromedary perk on for so long it’s just been second nature just like Rejuvenated.
---
Yeah well people are dicks, just make sure to stash your junk beforehand
---
Maybe next Easter?
---
Proof of what? The guy's guilt? Pretty sure that's on him. But for me, the proof is in the fact that he's here claiming a video game is getting him through his divorce and future child support. 
---
Or the proof of your atrocious grasp on English? Because I really don't need any further proof for that.
---
Dog Easter egg
---
If I'm in pvp with someone, I'll jump in front of them 14 times (I make sure to count) then carnivore them, I've gotten very mean Xbox messages from doing it
---
I'm pretty sure the reward is either going to be a full set of Assassin's Sentinel armor or  Fadora hat.
---
Yeah you're screwed. I was so confused when i came from fallout 4. I fucking hate it.
---
How do you name it? I tried to name my power armour at a PA station but I couldn’t find out how.
---
I can help out new players in certain ways (I wish I could get up enough levels or start a new character for a pure Medic build)
---
As soon as we get player vendors though (depending on how many we're allowed). I can finally open, "Food and Stuff" so I can help lower level players without having the be there directly. I'd set up in the lower level sections to offer various goods that lower level players who do not have the means to get them early on for very reasonable prices when compared to the bot vendors.
---
Items will include Disease Cure, Purified Water, Healing Salves, some different early scrap, emergency fusion cores (for fast travel), and of course Food and Beverages that won't decay.
---
I could see about adding in crafted foods and teas but unless the vendors prevent decay then I don't think my vendors would get visited enough to warrant selling such items.
---
It’s been inconsistent since I started like two months ago.
---
I haven’t had too many crashes or insane bugs. Xbox must be doing something right.
---
I am sure he made mistakes, but the fact is people twisted those facts and amplified it
---
Absolutely. Unfortunately, my best weapon is my tesla rifle and it just doesn't cut it. I can watch there health go from full to nothing and right back very fast. It is even worse, because they addressed this issue in December. I took two weeks off for the holidays and never had to worry about the damage bug anymore, or so I thoughr. Then literally their first patch after the holidays it's back. I thought I was the only one experiencing it since it doesn't get posted on here as often as it used to.
---
They need all the lämp brøther
---
Rejuvenated makes you tanky/active through AP.
---
I've never once had issues with the keypad on both types of doors.
---
some things wont spawn if you already know them.  like how you get a prime reciever drop from queen until you know them all, then you only get ultracite and jetpack duplicates.
---
They did fix this a patch or two ago and rebroke with the last one.
---
Thanks. I will take a look. I'm glad they finally gave the unknown vault a number instead of that glowing rectangle.
---
Same here
---
Should only need to quit out of FO and restart, but I'm a PC person so it could be different on console.
---
Very well known bug at this point.
---
It's getting fixed in patch 8.5, which is next week.
---
Tesla user. Still there for sure. Firing the automatic non auto by tapping when hitting multiple enemies seems to prevent it from starting.
---
I bet there will be some means of getting them on the 23rd. A lot of people didn't read the full text, such as myself.
---
It should effect the rifle but not the shotgun.
---
I know it effects the rifle version but i dont think they effect the shotgun conversion
---
Im no expert but shotguns have their own perks in the strength category and I would assume a tesla rifle would be an energy weapon.
---
I was told it effects both. I was hoping for a definite answer.
---
I believe it does effect Tesla Rifle, but shotguns have their own perk cards
---
Congrats!  Haha I've been wanting to see that happen.  I had turned my back for a few seconds the one time that I beat that game.
---
Speaking of...
---
&gt;!I just lost the game.!&lt;
---
I don't have the stash space to just do that on the fly though. I'd have to sort it and such (like deposit screws and process some stuff). So I could but I'll be joining the event later so the people running it will have less assistance while I do so. It'd be better if during events our bags were just like "private" so that people can just go in and help from the start with no worry.
---
How can find this known issues thread?
---
glitch
---
I feel the game is only able to calculate so much damage at once, and eventually something server-side bugs out and the game just stops tracking damage altogether. You see damage visually on your end, but once the server syncs up it goes "Nah, he had full heath." and corrects it. I mean, every single mob in a Harper's nuke zone was invulnerable. I could see one enemy bugging out, but all of them?
---
And then during scorchbeast queen fights you'll be doing absolutely *massive* damage and then she just stops taking it altogether. And she instantly becomes invincible. But it seems to happen with any gun though. My blooded gatling plasma can ramp up to 250+ damage per shot, and it has an insane rate of fire. I can tear through everything in the game (especially when I'm pairing it with psycho). And then it just randomly stops damaging enemies. It's rare, but...
---
not really a small minority ... limiting stuff in the name of exclusivity turns me off from games hardcore. my children will always take priority so I guess I miss out. it's just a game but these things don't have to exclude people that have responsibilities. it really doesn't. I mean we bought the game too and paid the same price. it's being made exclusive and again it's a choice by the devs...
---
(kinda side note but related, I'm kinda annoyed at  the team events and content when I was sold a game that would have content that could all be done solo ...with limited play time no one is usually playing when I get online kid free time so I'm literally locked out of content completely).
---
Well, this is your life now.  You know, this is how the scorched turn into petrified corpses.  It starts with a holotape.
---
Right. There’s no inconsistency in a batter calling some pitches inside and some outside. In both cases the hitter is looking for a pitch right down the center of the plate.
---
Focus of defenses first then hit up farm (optional) purifier (optional but recommended) after those are done you can start with either a 2 story building costs more but has height advantage or go with a single story structure allows more freedom in your dream house. Try to get a natural neutral building to be your camp home to save camp budget significantly. After that point you can build your decorations to your hearts content.
---
would be incredibly nice to make a mobile app for those of us that may not get to a computer every day.
---
That would most certainly be nice...but also that's not gonna happen, they have so much other problems to deal with.
---
The worst of the worst people
---
Plus it costs a psycho amount of Core in power armor to use.
---
I love it
---
I try to grab Poseidon, fix the plant, and leave the core generator unlocked. It’s the only decent thing to do
---
Sorry but..what Damage bug. I use Auto Tesla all the time. am I missing something? because I love that damn thing
---
Or even if they just made it so stash has unlimited capacity for scrapped junk then that'd solve it too. Just hitting scrap all and putting it away would alleviate the need to sort it and go "well I can afford to throw away this much steel so I can store this much more ballistic fiber".
---
I will 100% take every bag that I see in this competitive pvp survival game, or at the very least cherry-pick scrap from them at my leisure, especially when half the people in the event are spamming power attacks on a cloaked enemy and neglecting pylons/lack basic reading skills. Don't bring junk with you to the event, period; you have more than enough time to access a stash beforehand. 
---
People will support this sort of complaining but then go on to downvote and shame anyone that is frustrated with actual bugs and issues. It's truly unreal on this sub.
---
The sledgehammer and quad revolver? How much for either of them?
---
You can find the VTU underarmour Jumpsuit (not AS Tracksuit) in the VTU campus.
---
Nuke homestead to get execavator violet fluxes.
---
Lol the price to move your camp increases as you level up as well
---
Put your camp on the golf course as close to the whitespring disease cure as possible. My camp is so close to the fountain that it's basically a camp object : )
---
I agree. I thought the whole purpose of Survival mode was to allow The Asshats to do what they wanted when they wanted to do it. I'm getting sick and tired of doing large events with loads of people and some dickhead deliberately stepping in front of my attacks so I'll get flagged and others can kill me so he can loot all my stuff. Its happened more times than I can count. Been trying to do this Burrows thing for days now but people keep nuking it, hordes of people rush the sewers to kill the spawning mobs and some dick constantly gets in my way so I get flagged and screwed over.
---
On XBX but had same issue a couple times. Are you on wireless by chance? I had to restart my wireless access point and afterwards the issues was cleared up. Even after turning off/restarting the system it would persist until a reboot. Try restarting your network equipment.
---
welp only a year then
---
Fair enough. However when we have farmed whitespring before we just moved from area to area constantly except the time we did and were the only ones there then they only spawned once.  It still seems inconsistent.
---
I have a large assortment of weapons. The tse shotgun is only something i use for splash damage and solo silo runs. Yes it does decent damage with the perks, but the nerf was harsh. The spread is wide on the combat  and range is limited. Its not exactly an ideal #1 spot weapon.
---
- Executioners Gatling Prime Plasma is special. Literally melts scorched, a landed level 80 has a life expectancy of less than 5 seconds from full health. 
---
I've farmed the hell out of the game and had some good luck and good trades... my tse shotty is a specialized tool, not a full time weapon.
---
No player found
---
Haha I believe!
---
anywhere between 500 caps and 10k per piece depending on the amount of stars, the other effects, and type of armor.
---
Not to say there still isn't a number of things to fix, but they are fixing a lot more things than most people notice, as well as nice QoL changes. 
---
I can hit you with some easy ones that I don't think many people think about/notice. A QoL change that I have seen iterated on across several patches is the Camden Park Daily, Dross Toss. The first change they made was to make the dross auto-equip to your grenade slot, and the second was a little 'ding' confirmation sound when you toss it through a tire. A few other bug fixes that have gone (as far as I am aware) unmentioned include things like fixing the 2 cliffs in the Mire, neon letters snapping properly, Silo scanners had their animations fixed, fixes to a roof and bus stop in Watoga, and many others. 
---
Again, still plenty to fix but more is getting fixed than you might be aware of.
---
Oh, and you pee acid, apparently ❤
---
I'll counter w Harper's Ferry. I joined w it nuked. A lot of violet flux and glowing ones.
---
How many eggs has there been?
---
sorry messed it up it's nicsparw
---
Alright thanks. I offered someone 8k caps for a full set buy they didn’t tell me how many stars it hard
---
Wouldn't a nuke still trash it though?
---
On plain vanguard 1500-2000 caps depending om type (combat, marine,etc). Vanguard sentinel stuff is worth way more.
---
Sorry to ask but can I get a bit more detail on the berkley springs location? I'm coming up empty after a door-to-door
---
In the Brotherhood's defense, the BoS faction in WV wasn't trained. Pretty sure Maxon didn't send people out east and the whole east faction at this point was only BoS in name.
---
And a counter point. Maybe the reason The Burrows is so easy is because the BoS killed all the big threats and ruined our challenge.
---
Okay let me make a picture for u
---
OMG yassss I love it so much. We need these implemented into the C.A.M.P. ❤️❤️❤️❤️
---
Yeah but why do all that work.
---
Is that for a set or per piece
---
Zerg is the key you missed. I am level 151 and this is all there is todo. You make it guaranteed it will be a gang of 20 players all running the guaranteed drops train of boringness.
---
1. Survival ( before they caved and ruined it)
---
2. Increased stash space
---
3. When they fixed vats
---
Yes and no, yes in that we need player hubs and no in that the whole point of survival is a more difficult experience where you're constantly making sure that you're safe. A good compromise in my eyes would be to make the White Spring, Enclave Bunker, and train stations function similarly to adventure mode where you can pick and choose your fights. (76 should be protected against all PvP in my opinion.)
---
Best bot service I've ever seeb
---
Yes you will get the buffs even if your opposite ovores.  Carnivore is aggressive due to killing needed it encourages gameplay through combat while herbivore is passive due to farm available it encourages emphasis on trading.
---
I mean a simple Vault Boy emote of him smiling, closing his eyes, pushing his hand forward with his hand in a "STOP" motion then shaking his head from left to right I would think could indicate a "Thanks but no thanks" motion like that. If needed, it could be followed up with a thumbs up.
---
I'm not sure anyone can solo it and it'd be nearly impossible to get a chance to. I've been in small groups that can melt her quick though.
---
Instead of nerfing myself, why not add more random level 90+ monsters out there as random encounters. Like a legendary level 95 glowing grafton monster.
---
The Tesla gets its buff based of the mod you use. Automatic: commando ,charged: heavy weapons , semi auto :rifleman, and shotgun/lobing:shotgun perk.
---
Scavengers..vultures
---
Why move it, free legendary drops yo
---
You miss the point but that ok.
---
some pieces might even sell for closer to 20k if you can buy them for caps at all. The whole cap market is kinda screwed.
---
I’m considering the implications of putting a heart emoji next to peeing acid...
---
You missed the point Like Drax.
---
You're trying to make lore reasons for not crafting in power armor in a world where all our stash boxes are basically unified points in space time that allow only us to see only our own loot?
---
Ok I get survival is functioned to be difficult but I personally thought that the much more upcoming harder mode known as nuclear winter should be a more, tougher experience and have no limitation where you should be scared. 
---
However, the idea where you can pick a fight and you both fire back and initiate pvp is not a bad idea as well
---
Get the Easter eggs? I'm also away from home but I haven't heard about this
---
I mean, I was looking forward to the announcement and opening of vault Purple.
---
Just you.
---
Yeah whitespring is instanced. Every time another player walks in, they will all spawn again. I played the burrows twice since we spoke though and once had nothing resapwn but had everything respawns the second time while I was way in the bottom. So they say they wont respawns, but sometimes they do? I personally have a mixed view now cuz I've seen it do both now.
---
You missed the point. My play style was just randomly meandering through the game, the only gear being what dropped for me. I don't even have a 3 star legendary. A natural, casual level 151 that I reached through 6 months and about 450 hours of play time.
---
Yes. When you take a workshop, you are accepting that you are open for PVP. There's a warning and everything. You have to agree to it. Nowhere does it say "only while on workshop grounds." When I take a workshop, I watch my back, always. Have caught quite a few people trying to kill me. It's fun.
---
Hope ya filed for custody. Mark down all your attempts you tried to see your kid. Judge will not like what she’s doing to you and your child.
---
No multiple characters, all my eggs are in 1 basket.
---
Don't overthink it too much 😉
---
Today is the 2nd one.
---
It’s sucks that 25k is the max amount of caps. I guess I’ll have to make another character to sell the rest of my legendaries. Thank you for your comments
---
Someone sold a vanguard sentinel 3*. 24k. . Few days ago.     Just one piece. Lol
---
I sure hope this works out for us. I’ll be super pissed if we scrap a bunk of legendaries to get another shitty legendary. Thanks for asking what everyone is wondering op.
---
One a day for 6 days and then you get a item if you collect all six. Deathclaw eggs that are decorated for display in your camp
---
😂 yeah and I saw that and was like, guess they couldn't think of a number yet. Here you all go, a new vault with a random rectangle.
---
SOL.
---
It isnt showing up in my atomic shop either??? Ive restarted the game and console 3 times. 
---
STILL NO EGG!
---
My friend said it went live at 5pm but i dont see anything after multiple restarts
---
HELP!!! I dont want to miss todays egg!!
---
Odd. A YouTube video I watched earlier said the place was amazing and just kept respawning when new people joined. That just didn't happen for us despite 4-5 new people turning up. Again it's just really inconsistent. Thanks for your feedback though.
---
I feel like a very angry mother Deathclaw might come knocking. After all, these eggs had to come from somewhere right?
---
Jeez. That’s a lot lol
---
Translation: Your opinion doesn't matter to me! Censor yourself and keep your opinion to yourself. (and I don't even have a dog in this hunt.)
---
So if I miss a day I miss the item 
---
Ok great
---
You’re right. I never really tried pvp so I don’t have much to say about it.
---
Only you. He gets blasted to scrap as soon as he's within sight.
---
Yup.
---
so to expand on this, every Biv quest has a milestone (i think, it could just be RNG) the way i found this out is because i've done a few Biv quests since he came out (about \~20). every few quests i get "Plan: Greek Letters Set" so my theory is that the plans for the beer keg are a major milestone (that or it's a REALLY REALLY rare item)
---
Not those plans.
---
Hey man, you're allowed to think what you want, I'm not preventing it.
---
ATOMIC SHOP EGG NOT SHOWING UP!!
---
Anyone know why the second egg isnt showing in the atomic shop?
---
Ive restarted multiple times
---
It was back for a while. I remember reporting it to ladydevann (and getting a reply back, so I know it was seen) a couple title updates ago. Before wild appalachia, I think it was the one back in early February
---
Ok well this is only like my 2nd if not my first post complaining about 76 soooooo
---
Let me know if you’re doing another! PSN: stollio
---
I live at one of the entrances to the Whitespring, so I got guardian robots for myself
---
Did you drink Nukashine before crafting the armor?
---
I get what your saying. It makes sense and all but it seems too *safe* if that makes sense. Like in my eyes it makes more sense to allow PvP but still be protected so that you feel safe, but cautious. To sum it up the "safezones" should be a place where you'll still look over your shoulder for trouble, but you can breathe easier knowing you won't be insta-dead from out of nowhere.
---
As far a nuclear winter goes, it should hopefully be like Rust, as survival was a step in the right direction but being tracked down and hunted by the whole server is something I hope to not see in the hardcore mode.
---
Yep, I'm just lucky my roommate is around as I'm gone for work
---
Floor decor I think. Same place you find the mini statues
---
TBH whitespring used to be my spot..but it has been a snooze-fest as of late..I force myself to enter a blast zone there
---
Degenerates like you belong on a cross.
---
It can be fun, it can be a nightmare. I'm usually fine when it's 1 on 1. Often 2 on 1. Sometimes 3 on 1. What's hilarious is when someone tries to jump you and dies, then calls in a friend then another friend and another friend after they all lose repeatedly :P
---
Difficulty/risk vs reward
---
You have to inspect the power armor chassis. While inspecting it, there is a button to rename it.
---
Just a quick tip. If you own a paint job or a skin for your gear, the other people can't see it when you trade. It's pretty rad. You also can't accidently scrap it
---
Nuke it
---
That's what I assumed but are you 100% about the Shotgun? Have you checked it yourself?
---
That sounds like a better claim now that it all makes sense, and yes, vault 76 should be No PvP at all. 
---
Nuclear winter should be the harshest and most extreme experience of all, a complete hellscape,
---
I like to kill low levels at workshops. Then based on how they react to it I either move on or give them 30k caps+ worth of stuff. Basically, if they're cool about it, they're set till 50 or later. If they send me a ragefest string of messages, I let them know what they lost by not being a good sport. It's a way for me to simultaneously be a huge ass and a nice person :P
---
no he always seems to bug me right in the middle of a battle so he dies too
---
I'm ready to get anal fisted by a level 300 melee build and lose **everything** for added challenge
---
Can u add as many as u want
---
and unfortunately it’s the thing they add the least of to the atom shop it seems
---
It 100% does not affect the shotgun. Looking at the ESM, the Tesla Rifle should use Rifleman perks unless you have the automatic barrel. The shotgun barrel should also use Rifleman.
---
I was curious as well, I have one with a charging shotgun barrel and makes no difference whether the perk card is on or off, per dmg.
---
Of the eggs, yes I believe so!
---
&gt;It's a much needed cap sink. No others exist in the game at the moment.
---
Are serum recipes a joke to you?
---
Dude... no :(. I want to cry for you.
---
Thx!
---
No problem!
---
Well it does seem like there are less players on most of the servers I've been on the last several days.
---
Yea sorry mate, probably stuffed up my verbiage but was referring to the nuke paint key.  You can definitely still pick up multiple paint copies.
---
The game is great during the initial leveling process. It's once you get to level 100+ and have explored the whole map, that you run out of things to do. The game needs reward loops for high level beyond just nuking the SBQ to collect rare plans.
---
No humans plox
---
Are you referring to previous games? Or the ‘vertibots’ from this game?
---
This has been my system as well LOL
---
Blame Bernie’s socialist influence on these millennials.
---
My main character has a ton of poison resistance gear just by coincidence. It was hilarious to see my friends get shredded by a 3star mirelurk king's spit. I had no idea they did poison damage until I saw their life bars vanish.
---
You’ve obviously not seen the haters awards show. They can be very original.
---
Thank you! I always had to drop all of my power armour sets when I was trying to work on one just to know which one I was dropping
---
Youd have just enough build space left for 1 corn and a broken toilet. Perfect.
---
This game is a GRR Martin novel...”if you think this has a happy ending, you haven’t been paying attention.” :)
---
Oh ok thx
---
What’s this about legendary panties?
---
Omfg, this new mod better have newer characters for a more fresh experience, they didn’t do it for survival which is a letdown so they should do it for this mode and by the time they’ve done a lot of patches, I expect a stable game and most problems learnt and fixed but one can dream
---
&gt;People wanted a harder alternative to the scorchbeast queen
---
No. What people want is a less buggy SBQ with more consistent and worthwhile rewards. This is a problem with 76's endgame itemization in general.
---
&gt;The got the sheepsquatch and said it was ToO hArD
---
No. The main complaint about Sheepsquatch is the 2,000 cap bullshit and the dumb event cooldown timer.
---
&gt;They added the burrows and people said it was ToO eAsy
---
Which is a reasonable complaint if you're being told that this is the game's first "dungeon" and it's tuned for "2 level 50+ players" and then you can basically roll on through with no problems solo and there's nothing new or interesting there.
---
Nice strawmen though.
---
So, about this "weapon"? I haven't seen a single posting about this. Care to point me in the right direction?
---
Anyone else feel like you’re thug-leanin’ the gatling when the sight’s on it?
---
I'm on PS4 and I've noticed it as well.
---
I can't get the hell past those pipe repairing shit :( sometimes it doesnt get checked, sometimes the timer gets crazy. anyone had this? I'm on my 104's and the 4 times I tried, the pipes stopped me lol
---
Use power armor and use the stimpack hotkey.
---
If I see someone die, and they haven't been participating by activating a pylon, and they drop junk upon death, THAT'S the junk I'm taking
---
Good ole shitty server lag.  On pc you stutter step constantly and mobs bum rush you from it - total shit show.
---
Yes, they are. You can get them from SBQ fights, you can get them from players for a couple thousand caps each. They're just like the other recipes, only a temporary distraction.
---
Being able to do this is literally something that was part of how the game was made.
---
Being upset about it seems pointless.
---
Some people will and some won’t.
---
Can confirm, happened to me with my All Rise. I couldn't use my favorite wheel to switch to it, when I opened the inventory there where two of them. One had no graphic, no weight, couldn't inspect it, couldn't drop it. The other one was normal and could select from the pip boy. About 10 minutes after this occurred the server crashed. Log back in to find the weapon gone.
---
There was a bag I took after the area cleared out with some random junk.
---
Got back to CAMP and dude had like 1000 steel and lead...
---
Crafted myself a ton of ammo and called it a win
---
The good news is the assets are definitely there, we just have to wait till they show up in the atom store 
---
I’m guessing “hot August nights”
---
You gotta log all the way out and log back in too if u don’t see new one after 8pm est
---
nope. this was one from the first week or 2 the game came out. before anyone was dupeing anything.
---
ive also had power armour disappear since this update so im gonna go out on a limb and say its something wonky with the latest patch
---
Im hoping they release content like this early.
---
I scrap and store my junk constantly. I only keep a certain amount of everything so that I can always store any junk I have. I got so sick of always running out of space. As for taking people’s bags,I know I’ve probably done it a couple of times when I’ve seen the event pop up and went right there, then died. So when I try to grab my bag upon respawning, I forget what I had and just grab a bag that was in the area I died only to realize after the event (and I’m at my camp) that I picked up the wrong bag. Nothing to do at that point. 🤷‍♀️
---
That is the post apocalyptic American dream my friend
---
hm...mine was favorited also. mabye it has something to do with that?
---
Or just have NPC’s at the CAMP as settlers. It’d make it feel more at home
---
Per piece. Usually that is what I've seen for combat armor and marine. The other versions are less. You should be able to get at least 5k-7k for a nice matching set of max level vanguard combat armor.
---
In case anyone wants proof:

---
thats extremely kind to offer. seriously, wayy too kind. but sadly im on pc or else id give you all the caps i own xD
---
Do perks like blocker &amp; bullet shield work while wearing PA?
---
Same. I just nuked harpers 1-2 hours ago and nothing changed. I wont be nuking harpers again :(
---
Well there’s vanguard metal chest pieces and I’m pretty sure you can make it the alloy or polished metal same with arms and legs
---
Lol you post this like I was trying to "Initiate PvP" The picture I get is you are out just trying to one punch people. Which really isnt PvP lol. I mean no judgment, but call it what it is lol.
---
Dude. You know they’ll fuck us over.  When have they yet to fail to?  Use logic man.
---
That a waste of stimpaks unless you're a conduit. Stash your junk and accept your inevitable death.
---
what platform are you on?
---
Anybody wake up from the blackout and was like nope passed back out and woke up again somewere else. Also would seem legit peeing acid and sheepsqawnch.
---
Did you guys have issues with most of the bots boxes being empty?  
---
I did it once and didn’t get hardly anything doing it solo.
---
That is an informed, well crafted question.
---
Dense torso mod (on non power armor) + fireproof perk = complete explosion immunity. Yeah. It shouldn’t, but it does.
---
I'm filled to the brim and having to roll the dice that i'm selling the right one anytime I accumulate another. Will more stars be key, or will it be more like turning in more of a certain armor/weapon allow you to roll into a better one of that particular.
---
Nope. I get your point. You're not getting mine. 
---
I don't care what level you are, and what your gear is. Most people don't have top tier gear, most people will _never_ have top tier gear. By that absolutely impossible to pin down metric, we should _never_ have end game dungeons.  You keep leveling seemingly forever in this game, I've seen level 350+ characters. 
---
But, at level 50, with that level 350 charicters perk points, card choices, and if they gave you their gear, and you had their mutations, you would _do the same damage_.
---
End game is when you stop developing _as a character_. 
---
Level 50 is that. After that, it's just the grind for more weapons, armor, and unlocking more perk cards you can't use at the same time.
---
Steel is a precious commodity. 5 caps per 2 steel isn't a fair tradeoff.
---
🤣
---
He was in what looked to be I think was T-60 power armor (The one the brotherhood corpses are wearing)
---
I don't think we need a cap sink. I think we need a higher cap budget and for player vending to come out...that's a cap sink I want.
---
This is just a waste.
---
Fuck hard.  How about decently done and not a two room shit stain they made in five seconds flat?
---
I'll never spend caps on this, because it's a waste. 2k caps for a 1 star legendary and a fucking hat? Fuck that.
---
Seems you need to stop fast travelling and actually run places. You noobs and your fast travel have no idea how it was  on the early games.
---
It would be more like 7 caps per with super duper seeing as there’s a 30% to get doable craft items
---
Not really but I think it would be cool to have the ability to play as a Younger vault dweller
---
I noticed last night that normal area spawns weren’t happening as well.
---
I came into a freshly cleared town with no mobs and no one around, took 15 min for first mobs to spawn right as I wS about to leave.  Not the first time either.  Very fd up.
---
Me for sure. We need those PRESS vests to make everyone sure we're just capturing the pvp lol
---
Honestly? Fuck this whoooole mindset. "Stop complaining" is not the mantra we should be parroting. This game /has issues/. I like it, you like it, we all recognize it's potential, but Bethesda is very clearly out of their depth with this, and getting REAL feedback from the community is basically their only yardstick for making the game better. 
---
Sheepsquatch was hard, but people by and large seemed to appreciate it in my experience. Sure, I bet some people complained, as they always will, but the general reaction has been positive IMO.
---
The Burrows were advertised as a bit hunk of meaningful content that represented the future of what we could expect from Bethesda "dungeons". We didn't hype it. Bethesda did. So it turns out to just be another fruitless location on the map, with literally nothing special about it. This is a real kick in the teeth for a fanbase that's searching desperately for reasons to keep playing. There's a good reason why people are upset, and you're not doing us or Bethesda any favors with this attitude. 
---
Seriously. This game is not above critique. FFS
---
No sorry, I wasn't saying you were complaining. 
---
I meant in general, that if all people do is complain about this game then maybe they shouldn't be playing it!
---
You answered it yourself, gotta disable mods and fix your ini files
---
I hope you enjoyed it, I like a little set dressing for questions, gives me time to think through the scenario I'm asking about.
---
Or hat that comes with rules about not looting. Lol
---
Or pve
---
Lode baring needs signs pointing to the exit, I can’t handle the stress of keeping up on where the exit is with such a short time on the clock.
---
My husband was watching me play when I found that, and he kept saying the same thing!  😂
---
Well, it’s good that you got this one in time, at least. Hope you get the rest.
---
Cap sinks are mandatory in a MMO like this. You can get all the player vending you want, but it will only be a matter of time before caps become completely worthless with nothing to spend them on. I repeat, FOnline did it perfectly. T4 gear like +ap/dt/luck advanced power armor sold for hundreds of thousands or even millions of caps, and the players who got lucky enough to find an implant in one of the dungeons they ran could pay a similar amount to get a massive permanent boost for their character. I remember movement speed, crit rolls, and something crazy like +100% boosts to passive skills like repair and science. Then there were bases and cars for those who wanted to blow the money on less important stuff.
---
Thanks for posting this. I really should keep up with their twitter.
---
Well the game is set to make you do less damage unless they fight back and if you have pacifist on you do no damage
---
It's not queens that scare me but the kings, those suckers really hit hard and will ruin your day.
---
Mhm, which is why I was so sadly disappointed at psudo level 151, no 3-star legendary weapons, I casually walked in with my level 45 power armor and my 1-star legendary vampiric switchblade then finished the Burrows in under 7 mins. Not even understanding what had happened when the quest just completed. Because even at level 151, I am still just a level 50, and I don't even have the "Meta Gear". Just what RNGesus provided me. 
---
I had the experience that I had. There is nothing that you can say or do to change that experience or the disappointment I experienced along with it. Is it game breaking? No. Will it stop me from continuing to play? No. Its not like I hate Bethesda or anything, not like I am leading a boycott. 
---
It was what it was. Disappointing. I didn't Hype anything at all. I read what Bethesda announced. It wasn't what they announced. What they announced compared to what they delivered was very different. Now, Had it been instanced, I went in my own full instance, my experience could have been much different, for better or worse. 
---
There are a lot of different ifs, then, and maybes. What counts is the actual experience and the fun it provided.
---
No expert, and I can’t explain it, looking forward for the pros to answer.
---
I noticed it heaps last night, in 1st person i was missing everything standing right in front of me every time i first swung on em, i assumed it was server lag im on pc 2
---
I have checked 100% and can tell you that the shotgun version does NOT get a boost from shotgun perks. I have to use Rifleman perk cards to get the DMG boost. Best way to check for your self is equip the Telsa and swap out your cards. This was tested 5 days ago.
---
Gotta use Rifleman perks
---
Bahahaha I love it. Good way to reward good showmanship too haha
---
As soon as it says “Hidden” you heal. I rarely use stims and have amassed close to 500. Thank goodness people are buying them. I was becoming a stim hoarder. 
---
I’ll give you a serum to try out if you want. If your on Xbox. I have some and can make more anyway.
---
I take it you have not actually tried the Burrows then. The enviroment is really well done. It has new music. The place is well built and interesting. Sure, it was too easy. But it was no half-assed build. It looks awesome. It sounds awesome. It is well constructed. If you can make that in five seconds flat, well... you must be the best damn developer on the planet.
---
I’ve been having this issue lately. I thought I just had bad aim but it happens in VATS too. Then there’s the whole thing where enemies that aren’t actively agro to you specifically don’t show up in vats at all.
---
Depends a lot on who is on the server and how well they understand the event.
---
Thank you for the offer, but I already have a serum of my own. I can't wait to try it out now. Thank you.
---
I'm still waiting for my prize from him
---
According to Bethesda this is one of the few vaults without a social experiment and it can be seen because we actually all survived to get out of the vault. Vault-tec doesn’t nuke places to create the SBs but is is odd that we can attack each other.
---
I'm talking about GW2 - Path of Fire Meta event in Elon Riverlands. 
---
"The path to ascension", it ends with event named "Shift beyond reality to confront the crazed doppelganger" where one participant of previous event (it's chain event with six parts) get's a doppelganger and that doppelganger is the big bad boss.
---
It's no bug.  They ran an anti-duping sweep on power armor on the 9th.
---
You spent exactly $0 on this latest content. You got your $60 worth already so you’re not entitled to jack. If you don’t like it, find something else to do with your time.
---
well apparently those of us that are angry and vocal about wanting bugs fixed to have the game working as well as it could and should are exaggerating and lying ...or something. (I'm not quoting specifically, I'm mobile, so limited options)
---
people that want this to be a smooth bug free (hell even less bugs with basic functionality intact is all I want; I expects minor bugs to be present) are valid. these are valid desires for a game we paid full price for that was supposed to be complete. especially all these months later. game companies have to be held accountable and the consumer has to challenge this or nothing changes.
---
I get the jist of what OP is saying and YES a clear amended post point by point of issues as a direct line to Bethesda is ideal but clearly but that isn't happening. it should though so valid concerns are heard for consideration.
---
As well I can make all serums except herd and empath so if you want specific ones I’m your guy.
---
That tent on the west side mountain of the highway going n from ws to top of the world towards end of the wrecked train. Not marked, has bloarflys and ants - two of each.
---
Keyboard crusaders on both sides are actually imo correct. No one is allowed to have an opinion unless it aligns with theirs.
---
Yeah, I just put tape and a dot in the middle of my screen. Still should've been fixed a long time ago.
---
It's a lot of fun. One dude lost probably everything he had because he didn't yet figure out the importance of muling. Asked for his stuff back. I told him "no." He said "well, I learned a lesson, thanks." I invited him to visit my mules and gave him 20 of every bulk, 200 of the non-bulk stuff, a TSE shotgun my alt was using, 2k ammo, 5k caps, and a good weapon for once he hit 50 and let him choose an outfit LOL
---
I’m here if you need more then lol
---
They have ridiculous armor except their face. Aim there because anywhere else will do nothing and gauss aren’t that effective against them. Pre-TSE need my TSE gauss was doing only a fraction of damage. Get AA weapons for the MQ
---
Any time it does a revolving camera with the button prompt to redrawn just reload the game both I my is gonna happen otherwise, if you're lucky you might make it back in time to tag the squatch and get a legendary with the event completion
---
Complaining never has been helpful. In any situation. Maybe you wanna use the word feedback, but a healthy feedback don't use the word "idiot". I just can't take seriously most complaints, it seems like sometimes they need a videogame to live. Of course, a healthy person doesn't play videogames in that way. A developer can't do a game for that minority.
---
Aqui! No tengo ningunas amistades que hablen español en FO76 :(
---
En que plataforma estas? Si andas en XB1 mandame un friend request - GT QuasarSilva
---
Most of the vaults had the experiments going on (supposedly to see how humans would handle long term space flight if the world was too fucked) There are however control vaults such as Vault 76, I think 111 and 13 were also control vaults.
---
Ya mirelurk kings are ridiculous, then queen you can run circles around and attack but takes a while. The king is just all hands on deck Furious lol
---
That’s good advice, but I often don’t have an anchor to rejoin in the server. I didn’t know the revolving camera bit was an indicator
---
You say 100% then you say "should." Which one is it???
---
It’s a joke. The whole “You gotta shoot ‘me in the head” quest relates to this, kinda.
---
I have 4 mules and two of them are full with three star weapons and armour lol the other one has junk and the fourth I’m actually trying to level
---
Fallout has been amazing for me, I have so many friends that I met and ones that care about me as well. My life has been pretty tough lately and fallout has kept me going. I hope your situation gets better man, good luck.
---
Nah, the enemies have Serendipity.
---
Oh I know. I was joking right along with you.
---
Just you bro lol
---
Damn dude! You're incredible. I wish I had the time to play enough for that kind of loot so I could help others more. Lately I just stockpile my lower level weapons of worth and heading to 76 to drop them off on lowbies to help out.
---
Ah. Gotcha.
---
He always gives me pre war money and a pipe pistol
---
The "shotgun barrel" is a mod for the Tesla. It's not a shotgun.
---
There's like 2 steps.
---
I went through using a pistol with rifle perks.  I was sad.  It's just too easy.
---
&gt; Drink some grain alcohol, strip down naked
---
Wait, irl or in game?
---
Yeah it always happens for me, also if you need an anchor most of the time the game will put you into the same server you left (this is how they nerfed server hopping )
---
Estoy en PC :( 
---
No creo que tengo amigos que hablan español tampoco
---
I didn't see any in my inventory, oh well
---
I think I found plans for the Tent and Big tent at the Firehouse in charleston. Where you start the Firebreathers quests.
---
Well, I'm stumped. If he was taking your workshop, PVP should be on. If he's in PA, he can't be explosive-immune. If you're able to hurt him with melee, you don't have Pacifist on. The best I can guess is he was using low health with Serendipity and got super lucky? It's a 45% chance to avoid all damage from an attack when below 30% health.
---
I work from home and hop on just to server hop and kill people at workshops for an hour when I need a break. Basically, I write or edit a couple things, kill people, then work again lol
---
You have the serum by whatever means, but couldn't be bothered to try it on yourself? Had enough time to hip online &amp; make this pointless post that you literally could have figured out the answer to by taking the serum, STFU &amp; play the game.
---
Personally I tolerated FO4, it’s pretty mediocre. FO76 took the worst parts of FO4 and made them worse. I got to level 85 because I expected it to get better but the was nothing good about it after level 55
---
I've never been able to hear anyone else-- I've checked, re-checked, and changed every single chat-related setting... more than a few times. I can see them talking but can't hear anything.  
---
Xbox One X... been playing since November.  
---
I'm open to trying anything new.
---
You never forget your first scorchbeast kill.  Mine was at the Whitespring near the maintenance area.  I tried to stay out of the fight.  I hid in the hills just to watch and it spotted me.  At that point I threw my lot in with the robots and we took the beast down.  I was only level 30 at the time.  I wouldn't have survived without the bots.
---
It’s not a scam! Just pay him in 10 *easy peasy* installments of 500 caps and then you’ll get your very own Bahamas cruise and that Nigerian prince will give you that money he promised
---
Check your voice settings maybe?
---
Cops
---
Everyone does not do it.
---
Okay thanks friend. Will check it out now!!!
---
Or is it a Man? these are the questions as i understand them.
---
I saw a screenshot of someone who did a pretty spot-on Paladin Danse, but that's it. I love the character creator in Fallout 4 and 76, but it's fucking impossible to perfectly recreate an existing character since none of the face parts have numerical values attached to them.
---
Shame, too. If I could be a plastic surgeon for other players in this game I'd make a fortune in caps.
---
Steel is easily farmable?
---
Also good to know. To leave the infinite load screen, I’ve had to fully close the game. I wonder if that affects it
---
Lol 
---
I guess everyone I’ve ever played the event with then
---
You can pick up 2 or 3 pieces of BOS combat armor on a corpwe at tye end of the glassed cavern and dump all your aid you don't need (and any excess stims, food, water, etc) I know they said the drops were needed but I played recent and lost 20-30 diluted stims on every death so just keep as much as you can inside your stash as physically possible
---
It is, and gets burned through even faster for repairs,  ammo production, and crafting for mods.
---
Idk, but it normally puts me right back in. Otherwise you could try teaming with a random for an anchor
---
Are you 100%? If not, your assumption is the same as mine.
---
Nos pos 'ta cabron jaja
---
Aver si salen mas en este thread - no me imagino que somos los unicos 😅
---
Can you actually play the games remotely?
---
In a few months time, you will be "One of us, one of us". A lot of those players people are calling endgame raiders, We are casual players who play a few hours a day. For 6 months now though. I have completed all the quests available and completable. I am working down the challenge list now. I still wander around looking for some odd spot I missed and rarely I find some location I never noticed or unlocked. Now its mostly wandering around trying to get better and better gear drops, and I rebuild my camp every few weeks for something to do.
---
Hahaha you are so right! I much rather fight a scorchbeast beast then a mirelurk queen. I get punk by her or the time. If I find a Lengedary queen that's a fight of my life 😂
---
There was a goddamn invincible one in the doorway as I was trying to escape from 2 wendigos and a mirulek king and it’s reminded me of dogmeat when he got in the door.

Good one mate.. tooo many asshats in this game..

I'd hear once in a great while but, now it's gone completely silent. I tried plugging directly into controller,Astro mix amp? Mod mic though a Y splitter. Everyone can hear me just fine. I guess my vault dweller is deaf?
---
There are public workshops all over the map with aluminium deposits. Taking one of those is your best option, and it only costs around 30 caps.
---
I'm in the same situation- Housebound due to illness, only "trips out" are to go for kidney dialysis treatments. FO 76 allows me to find like-minded people and talk about things OTHER than my assorted health problems, as well as letting me hop in power armor and be  a total hard ass...
---
Oh. I thought you were saying you wouldn't use it because you use power armor.
---
I give people time after the event, but if people start leaving there's no reason I shouldn't take their stuff
---
Super!  What specific fix (i.e. what lines do I need to add) to my ini file would you suggest?  This is what I'm actually asking for.  I've tried searching the sub and google in general but all I get are results for the fix from 4 months ago which I've already done.
---
I'm trying to see if anyone else had this issue and fixed it, and if so what they did, in detail.
---
I know. My expectations are very low with this.
---
Drop all your caps and aid items to another character
---
Dont say the F word please. I can't stand it anymore
---
I need to do that more (team up with a random to protect against that). Thanks for the chat, mate!
---
I will pick up literally every piece of junk I see and then complain that my stash is full (I then do a massive resource donation to whoever I'm partied up with at the moment)
---
I really miss the workshops. That was a lot of my time and fun. I just really don't want to PvP in this game in any way. The Workshop change devastated me for that fun. On my Alt, I tried at low level to build up workshops and make them really cool for travelers ect coming through, but at level 17 I kept having level 100+ coming to troll me and take them from me after hours of work. Not fun.
---
I met a few cool players though, some that would give me stuff to build on the workshops. It felt good when they would come through and give me mats because I had built something very massive and cool.
---
Nothing beats my Bloodied Explosive combat Shotgun. NOTHING. Lol but the Telsa is fun af. Mine is a BE Tesla 😍
---
Yeah no problem that glitch has made me really consider sending my controller throuth a wall thanks to missing out on the xp and rewards
---
*As I'm bleeding to death on the floor*

There's a spawn for CTU jacket and jeans in the frat house upstairs.

I just want to not need stable flux to repair the damn thing. It makes having it out for public use annoying as fuck when some super mutants decide "hey fuck this guy, let's smash his arch".
---
Thank you very much. :)
---
Tech N9ne, hell yeah!
---
No kidding! It’s happened to me at the very end of the fight too when I’ve been taking the brunt of the attacks haha
---
I logged in and all my junk (including my flux horde) was gone  
---
sooo many screws....gone
---
Ya bloodied weapons are op.
---
I'm curious though. Do you know if Tesla Shotgun with all of the rifleman perks can out dps a combat shotgun without any shotgun perks? I'm asking because I'm about to buy a AAE Tesla.
---
Hell I can imagine
---
I can pop them on - tell u stats on what each one does
---
I'm playing with a melee build for quite a while now and never had this problem.

What i do have is that the game stutters and freezes at the most inconvenient moments. This is a problem since last patch

I was JUST saying that to some buddies in-game; You can just barely peep over the rubble in the collapsed tunnels, so I hope we can get in there eventually...
---
I moved and rebuilt my place. Ran out of space, It felt like I had a lot less stuff in there. I scraped the 2 or 3 items I had and then the server crashed. I logged back in and a full 3rd of my build limit had emptied.

That would be a huge help. Actually could you just tell me the Tesla's stats? I have a shotgun to compare it to.
---
Problem with heavy guns too especially in vats mainly my quad harpoon gun
---
Thank you!
---
That's an interesting choice of works there dude
---
You mean like using pylons to make an enemy vunerable, only people dont reas that and complain its too hard?
---
So once you miss one your screwed??
---
You're getting mocked and downvoted, and rightly so... But I'll go ahead and let you in on the secret. This game, like any good RPG is about the joy building your character. At level  47 you're not even halfway there yet, and you're just being short sighted if you think your okayish hammer build is anywhere near where it can be.
---
I bought mine in Grafton. This was a while ago. 
---
Did you go to Whitesprings? They now have merchant bots from other factions.
---
You didn't answer their question though.  If you want PvP why arent you playing the mode put in the game specifically for people that want PvP?  "I have other characters for survival"...so play them in survival.
---
The in-game description for adventure mode calls it the mode "focused on cooperative play".  There is no objective benefit to wrecking someone CAMP and only doing small amounts of damage doesn't change this; "its only a few steel" which they shouldnt have to spend because you should be in survival mode.
---
Contesting a workshop is considered "fighting back" though.
---
 And he said he wasn't in pacifist, as he killed the other player in 3 shots with a different weapon.
---
Something like a a game as well
---
Mine will be diff cuz I run Bloodied
---
Instanced interiors is what we need for this.
---
Wow you hateful little bitch. Don't you get the fact that if you can't grind atoms because half the challenges are incompletable you and you want to buy something in the atomic shop your forced to spend cash. Then again your probably waiting on fix it kits and shit like that instead of collecting. And as far as cost of I only spent $51.99 on the tricentennial additional when it was on sale. I ain't asking for a miracle, I'm asking for a company to deliver on what has been promised to it's customers. So tell your boss next time you see him he you did the work you paid for and to hell with anything else you said you'd do. See how long the unemployment line is then. Twat.
---
Yeah, this has been a real pain in the ass for the last few days. Lol
---
Probably deleted it and made a some alts to post those "daily reminder innocent players are still banned" posts that happen once an hour or so.
---
Aw hell naw. Those facehuggers from the Alien movie were creepy af.
---
People do sell them, but shoot down the cargo bots that have 3 vertibots surrounding them
---
Lol thanks anyways
---
I saw a chameleon deathclaw. I've never seen that before.
---
True
---
If they let fast travel be a part of Survival Mode I wouldn't care if all servers changed to it tbh. Also, if they RANDOMIZED SPAWN LOCATIONS FFS... Lol. I get so irritated being farmed by people 50 levels higher than me as soon as I spawn. That's one of the reasons I don't choose those servers. And, if they got rid of the +20% xp and no fast traveling but to train stations, vault, and bases that'd be fine, I think.
---
Is there a laughing one available at all? I needed that for the asshat trying to kill me in a train station in adventure mode while I had pacifist enabled. Kept flashing pvp emote and shooting me with a grenade launcher. So I just started crouching up and down rapidly with the confused emote. I wouldn’t mind a mocking laugh for instances like this too.
---
They probably haven't decided yet. But, unless they count each re-roll (which is more effort for them to code) you should be able to do it multiple times. Otherwise, players could sell un-rollable weapons/armor to unsuspecting buyers.
---
Let's say you had a 3-star weapon, and another 3-star weapon/armor used as a token to re-roll your choice of "any" of those 3 effects. You could keep doing this until you had a god-roll weapon. It might take 100 tokens to do this though, as the re-rolls would be random choices (made by the rng). Think of it as a Slot Machine.
---
If you had another 2-star as a token, you could only choose 1 effect of the 3 "not" to re-roll, and the other 2 get re-rolled. Using a 1-star as a token, it would re-roll just 1 effect, "but" this could be any of those 3 effects on the weapon (not a good choice unless all 3 are trash to start with).
---
Honestly if they had both queens and kings spawn everyone would dread going against mirelurks just because the damage they can take and give
---
The workaround is to hit me up on ps4 with the materials and I’ll set you up :)
---
Damn, thanks anyway.
---
Based on the 'no one will ever know unless Bethesda releases their information' I would have thought he would have done an "I'm leaving" announcement.  
---
He was pretty verbose with things, so assuming if his appeal was rejected, they'd've justified it, and the numbers they provided meant he couldn't do a twelve paragraph thread on why they were wrong.
---
Lmao good, I dont believe it's what they actually intelled but good
---
No perks:

Badhesda give me my free shit that you worked tirelessly on. I paid $60 dollars to your shit game I’m entitled to everything you make and deserve it now you lazy fucks.
---
I have 11 Intelligence....
---
I have both Gunsmith and Makeshift cos I swap between them so much... But I would LOVE to knock it down to 6 and swap on the fly... Its just not feasible, even with the Loadout manager mod
---
24 players per server is too many when you only have 4 spots to farm.
---
What egg do you have ? the flower was the first one
---
See my other post - I gave u stats from all my guns
---
After looking everywhere in the shop in build menu with no success, I just restarted and it showed up. Just in case it happens to anyone else
---
My husband got his egg, and when I went to log in - I had nothing there. I did get yesterday’s (flowery) 
---
I’ll log in again in the morning and see if it appears.
---
You can go to the enclave bunker and summon a cargo bot with a nuke card it’ll even tell you where in the map it is
---
I just restarted the game and it updated with the second egg so I have both now
---
Have you tried restarting the Bethesda launcher ? It works for me.
---
It’s EST as Bethesda HQ is in Bethesda, Maryland :)
---
Basically if the dude is low health, run. They will 1 shot you. There's nothing you can do to scratch them unless you get lucky with an automatic weapon.
---
Usually he will curse and threaten violence upon them 😂
---
Fair warning this sub can be rather acidic, not reflective of people you meet in game
---
Yeah I ended up restarting the game, it showed up with a few sales. It makes me wonder if I've ever missed something because of that
---
He tied his own noose by posting the email Bethesda support sent him. Bethesda would never share it with anyone else or make any sort of public comment on it... He could have just stuck with his original story and kept the momentum in his favor. Once people that actually play this game got a look at those numbers it was pretty obvious he wasn't on the level.
---
I’m level 10 at the moment so it’s fine by me 😂
---
Thanks Akt 🙂
---
Cheers!
---
Alamejor si jaja :(
---
Ok, what do they do? If we miss one do we get nothing?
---
He posted a whine post  earlier today.
---
The new egg was up starting at 8pm eastern time . Guessing the same time change every day
---
Oh, have you got a link, his old account is showing as \[deleted\]
---
As soon as I die I see a hoard of people over my dead body. They instantly quit fighting to grab my loot. Usually it’s nothing but funny how they stop what they are doing to take your stuff. Not that I care whatever I had is gone. It’s mostly just stuff I recently picked up. I try not to pick stuff up during those events but old habits are hard to lose
---
Tesla rifle is a heavy weapon, and is subject to those perks
---
I spend like 100hours on witcher then when it forced me to make new char on dlcs i didn't play them and i was happy.
---
I played fallout 4 so many times without any dlc. And skyrim, crazy amound of play thru.
---
Comeon i spend 1000hours playing dota which have 1hour max of content.
---
Yeah i have 510+ hours on fallout76. Still i feel riped of, because bethesda is like - hey come! We have new contend, we made survival, you go there meet immortal guy, lose all your meds and caps. Another week - guys we have dungeon for you! In mmo game. Huray lets go. Rush thru solo. What the fuck?
---
If they want me to be happy with fallout, they should turn off servers, because they are just making disapointing shit.
---
Everyone has a hard on for westek, and I was told that is was nice easy place to farm. Well, these people failed to be specific, because it's only easy for a guy with a gun. For us melee builds, Nah, fam... it's a good place to go through 20 fucking stimpaks in one go around.
---
That's a good point. I think it did start happening since I renamed my parts. I added a TILDE (~) to the beginning to make all my stuff at the bottom and sometimes shortened the name, such as "~Excavator LA" (left arm).
---
Mine arent there either. Ive looked in the spot that has been suggested by other users on reddit but havent found it. Im leaning towards a bug.
---
Im not sure is it since last patch but mutants inflicts a lot of demage.
---
PC player, my dude. but i appreciate the offer!
---
I believe if you have the armor already you just need to upgrade it at the PA workbench..the highest level is 45 and you'll have to gather a bunch of materials of course..
---
guess he finally gave up making an ass of himself.
---
It's not going to give you what effect you want. That would be giving us all god tier weapons for free.
---
It might give out tokens by the number of stars on the scrapped weapon, that would make some sense.
---
But how many you need for a re-roll and how does that work? They will need to keep the RNG element in it and perhaps make a re-rolled weapon unusable with the vendor or make a counter to count how many times it has been re-rolled and increase the cost of each try (similar to what Warframe is using on it's "legendary" card mods).
---
Agreed! So many stims wasted! I didn’t care about the “farming”, I just wanted to explore the location and read the terminals and such, but if I found a legendary in the process, I also wouldn’t complain...well, unless it was a rolling pin or wood armor.
---
fuck it its only a cosmetic people wont be saying in 3 years hey remember the super rare and aweome easter eggs hahaha :).
---
i havent bothered with it either and im not losing my mind ;)
---
[Money Money Money](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xW0IR3q0EvE)
---
If I had to guess it would work like this:
---
\-Scrapping 1\* legendaries give X tokens, 2\* gives 2X, 3\* gives 3X, lower level legendaries will probably give a lesser amount.
---
\-You can choose to re-roll any of the 3 effects of your item separately for Y amount of tokens, but you are not allowed to choose what specific effect you want to get it replaced with. For example you can re-roll your Furious effect from your weapon, but it's RNG if it gets replaced with Instigating,Anti-Armor,Bloodied,etc.
---
\-Primary effect re-rolls will probably cost a higher amount of tokens compared to secondary or tertiary effects.
---
I found many caps so I hope they aren’t rare because I now feel stupid because I found 3 and dropped them:(
---
You can open a ticket at Bethesda.net for direct communication. Or PM one of the community managers (not mods) here. Their accounts are properly flared.
---
No one else love 'ghost riders the sky' ? Its badass like a new big iron xD
---
Thanks! Will they actually talk to me if I put in a ticket? Or just ignore me haha
---
SIR! MAY I HELP YOU SIR!?
---
I will do a go around like once or twice a week, but some people on here farm it and server hop on the same level people do for whitesprings. I can't imagine the amount of stimpaks involved in that shit. Fuck super mutants.
---
Awesome thanks. Does the Tesla SG have decent range?
---
If it's serious it will probably be the next patch.
---
I know a real bad dupe exploit when trading but it's yet to get patched since the beta and I've put in 3 tickets for it.
---
On a side note. The Burrows seems like a great place for survival mode. Set up a 1 v 1 or team v team on the server.. One team goes in the north entrance. The other through the south. Some server rules and moderators on the outside may be needed to enforce the player made event. But it seems like it could be a thing. Just a thought.  I don't personally do pvp but it sounds like an interesting idea in my head.
---
I give 8k caps for the gun tomorrow when I login.
---
What I'd like is not just private servers but community run servers, so people can find a server with a collection of mods they like and still play with others
---
Your name is literally "filthy_white_male"
---
If on XB, quit FO76 and restart. It appeared for me then.
---
Lemme see 120 vs 72, but accuracy is less.
---
Awesome thanks for the help!
---
Yeah, West Tek isn't for melee. Sniper or Commando is what you need to make West Tek worth it.
---
Awesome, thanks for the help!
---
Git gud.
---
They do need to fix that part. I've had it happen plenty of times to me. Now days I just spam invites.
---
I don't want refund or anything, bought it for full price days before beta and i am happy with it.
---
But if they don't stop fucking up, people will leave and never come back. You want death MMO?
---
I thought burrows will be hard so i could call my friends, that stoped playing, back. Gues what....
---
Every single patch fucked up something.
---
Imagine you are level 500. There is no repeatable enjoyable content for you.
---
 'pvp' = trying to kill immortal ppl in non-patched sentinel/assasin gear.
---
Sheepsquatch event = cost over 2k caps. Worth 200? And not fun at all.
---
Scorchbeast queen = i have killed her over 100times, she is still buggy. She can be entertaining, but mostly she is bullet sponge
---
Burrows - really?
---
Challenges - this keeps me playn only weekly and daily (other i done already) but again guess what
---
There was "kill something in radstorm" i saw 3radstorms in 500hours!!! Now those camera challenges........
---
This game will die soon with how it goes, that why i am angry. Keep your money bethesda i don't carry about them.

Uh...Ya I know, just pointed out to the OP that shotgun perks don't apply...
---
lol, Ah, he just deleted his 'helpful places to farm' thread in a huff. [https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/arineq/900\_hours\_played\_my\_favorite\_farming\_locations/](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/arineq/900_hours_played_my_favorite_farming_locations/)

Along with the content in the one you linked!
---
If you're on PS4 I'll gladly be your enforcer so you can learn it's lore. I can also show you how to farm it if you want.
---
Yeah six months in and the endgame content is still bugged. Over 700 hrs in for me and this is my first rant post. I had to take a deep breath on that one.
---
They said collect all 6 for the reward on the 7th day.
---
If you’re melee.....serrated combat knife changed my life!
---
Yeah few people said it didnt show up.
---
They may or may not engage with you, but don't expect any more than a thank you.
---
Aww, thank ya! But I’m on Xbox. Very nice of ya!
---
Youre welcome. It's what I'm here for &lt;3
---
No idea. That sucks. I had no issue.
---
Pretty sure its T-45
---
well we don't know what the reward for getting all 6 is yet
---
Hmm. Sniper for the midrange ones, and Commando to deal the ones that get within melee range?
---
I have noticed vats and non vats issues.
---
Outside of vats I notice that there is.a big difference between how poor a set of knuckles connects when compared to my mole miner gauntlet.
---
Sometimes it takes 3-4 hits before my knuckles connect. Not even noticed the issue with the gauntlet.
---
What mods are you using?
---
Get a power armor chasis frame to put unused armor pieces on that you want to save. A frankenstein armor chasis to store in your stash. Save your modded jetpack chest on the pa chasis and craft a new chest to apply a new mod to. The armor weighs less on a chasis in stash, well thats how it used to be anyway.
---
Hmm. When I finally get more batteries I’ll have to check it out? I’m guessing the faster attack rate means less blocks?
---
You should be able to craft it yourself if you started and then completed Quest: Minor Miracles, even if you didn't craft the set yourself. You learn to craft Excavator PA after reading the sign, and then the computer terminal. After that you can complete the quest by scanning your Excavator suit, even if you didn't craft it yourself. Check at a PA station and you should see the ability to craft all levels of Excavator PA.
---
Damn I have no idea whats going on. I had mo issue :(
---
Yes and the damage output is high enough that you’ll forget about the Blade of Bastet (I used that until I was like lvl 70 then the combat knife changed that)
---
I have 5× unyielding sentinel with ap refresh on most. There is nothing to use caps on that would make me sell for caps. Caps have so little value
---
I play with the sound off.  😃
---
Hmm. Now I’m really intrigued! I love the Blade because it has that armor piercing effect, but the damage on a combat knife is higher? Interesting!
---
Are you on now? Xbox? I will rebuild it for you immediately
---
I already did, but thank you for being a good community member!👍appreciate people like you
---
That is one cold hearted woman. All the best in the divorce.
---
But that doesn't change the dungeon it just increases the XP you get and difficulty a bit.
---
Awesome! Thanks for the info man
---
Care to elaborate? Considering the shit storm a dupe glitch caused last time, I'd like to help you get rid of this one
---
Yeah I take enemies down much quicker. It was pretty astonishing
---
Thank you but I already did, and thank you for being a kind community member!! I appreciate the thought👍
---
I lost an Assassin’s piece and it was at the top of my armor list.
---
One or the other for the entire run... They are both efficient. If you have max Sneak and Escape Artist you should be alright for both builds. It's more about learning the layout of the building to make the run efficient. Super Mutants are dumb, and their legendaries are cowards.. Kill their hounds and stay in the shadows and you can sneak attack critical your way through it.
---
I don't think so. There are complainers that wanna a game for playing 40+ hours weekly. Is not greatness, it's a obsession.
---
I hope the developer (yes, the developer), doesn't listen this people. They are a unhealthy minority.
---
Status quo in videogames? Who cares?! This people need spend more time IRL. The gaming industry (like all our market) it's about supply and demand
---
His health was at full, so not that either I'm afraid, I was thinking maybe there is some means of latency affecting it. From his side I mean I have a gigabit connection (Well 880mbps at peak times, but far more than fast enough)
---
I did notice another pvper I fought kind of flicker moving so it was hard to attack him in melee because he would just vanish. Once I got some distance my minigun tore him to shreds though.
---
Also a trapper keeper for the 30k notes I have in my pack.  Heh
---
Literally here, do pricecheck
---
Lol I literally just went down to the burrows and got the same lvl 1 eyebots. I just fast traveled back out!
---
This challenge isn't even working.
---
Yeah I went to springs. That one floor with all the other shops. How do I know if they are diff faction vendors
---
Oh ok. Thanks.
---
Be sure to include ur platform as prices vary
---
Melee.  They fall like anything else.  Takes a dozen or so swings but up close the queens don't really do a lot of damage.  Maybe it's the suppressor's effect, but they don't seem to spit the poison when you're up in their grills.
---
the emotes are ok i guess, but its so much easier to just click your mic on and say something
---
I'm not buying any Atom's ever.  Got it Bethesda ?
---
Well, the first egg disappeared from the store, but the second egg has not been put up yet... or Bethesda decided to put it on a short (i.e., 1 hour) timer and I've already missed it. Leave it to Bethesda to screw the eggs up, too.
---
Of course! Not always fun dealing with raiders/griefers, glad you were at least able to repair. Best of luck in the wasteland!
---
What’s a good way to convince low levels to stop running long enough and pay attention so you can give them stuff?? (Doesn’t help I’m dressed in a dirty white nurse’s dress/uniform-homage to the joker heath ledger walking from the hospital reference
---
) I’m still low level myself (26) and trying to figure things out in the half hour a day I have time to play. I have been fortunate to have people give stuff to me but stuff I can’t use yet. The best I can do is try and convince players back to my camp (literally due south of sunshine meadows factory on the dry creek bed) where I have an indoor farm (building is an open roof with concrete base in a big rectangle with open dirt center for water and adhesive farming) with everything a high level or low level player needs. 
---
I was grateful for a high level to gift a fusion generator when we teamed up but I lack plans for a lot of stuff.  By no means am I out for handouts as i love doing the Quests to gain stuff but it is next to impossible to get things if a high level player is near by creating high level creatures to spawn. I got a new asshole in white springs bc a high level came thru and spawned crap I couldn’t even run from. And yet it still doesn’t take away from the fun of the game.
---
I suppose they could make re-rolled items "soulbound" and thus unable to be traded with other players.
---
To you too!
---
Did you even play fallout 4. 111 was definitely not a control vault
---
Good find amigo :) 
---
I found a dead Brahmin with those mystery quills in it and a big chunk bitten out of it near the Overseer's camp in Flatwoods. It was the random encounter spot between the camp and Flatwoods proper. I posted a pic over on filthy casuals if you want to go have a look.
---
Nice, haven't used gun fu, I thought that was a pistol perk.. Nice, I just picked up a two star bloody for 800, can't wait to try it out
---
That was my first thought exactly. Beautiful place for PVP.
---
I meant the one forom fallout 3. Its been awhile since I played.
---
I did answer their question. I said I don't like the unarmed character in survival because you die before getting into melee range.
---
As things currently stand, Adventure mode is better for PVP and Survival mode is better for PVE.
---
Adventure mode let's you easily find other players to duel. The rewards are also greater. Survival only gives you 25% of the normal cap rewards. It is not worth the cost in fast travel to get into the fight. Why would I spend 25 caps to fight a level 100 when I only get 25 caps in return. It also marks me on the map, making it easy for others to pinpoint my location. On top of that, people can just give me a bounty which completely negates my chameleon mutation. You are actually punished for killing others in Survival. This is why I fight in Adventure mode.
---
Survival mode completely hides your location on the map. You only lose 25% of your caps when you die. You also get a 20% bonus to experience. PVPers do not want to gain experience. Levels equal cap rewards. We want our level low and our enemy's high. For this reason, I take my PVE characters into survival.
---
Your perception of what should be does not match up with the reality of what currently is. Survival is more rewarding for PVE players. Adventure is more rewarding for PVP players. Considering survival is a beta mode, that will likely change in the future.
---
How is it my fault that this  game has no end-game content and vertical progression?
---
All the best with that brother, good to hear you can find a way to enjoy your day
---
I've been having that same exact issue, actually. And I'm on PC. And yes, when it starts happening, I have to swing 4 times before it registers. Usually there's no lag when it's happening. I thought it was just me. Been happening for a few days now.
---
Are you using a "swings 40% faster" type weapon, and/or a perk that makes you swing faster? I'm wondering if maybe the swings are happening too fast for the game's thingy to register the hit.
---
Whats the best counter for a stealth bloodied melee with full cavalier armor?
---
Oh, you were actually asking about the Tesla shotgun barrel in the first place?
---
The shotgun barrel doesn't add the WeaponTypeShotgun keyword, and that's what the standard damage calculation uses to determine whether to use the rifleman or shotgun damage perks. I can't absolutely guarantee that there isn't some weird exception elsewhere in the ESM though, so more 99% than 100%.
---
Note that this could be a bug from Bethesda's perspective. They've changed plenty of weapon mod types since release.
---
I got the small letters plan and my camp has notes all over it telling low level what to do lmao it's worked great so far
---
I was just thinking they should add automatron DLC to this game
---
I missed the first one. Do you think we'll get a smaller prize if we have a few or is it all or nothing?
---
I know man its not fast enought though i need like 100 bulk
---
Will it fix the Friends list sorting that was broken in 8?
---
And the Plans sorting that was broken in 8?
---
And the Stash Transfer button being changed to be different from every other Transfer button in the game?
---
And the unnecessary double Rename implementation, needlessly making the Repair menu a real pain?
---
Ps4
---
There are still a hand full of dupe glitches out there that haven't been patched  yet some of which are from beta days. Only reason they haven't spiraled out of control yet is because YouTubers haven't found them yet.
---
If I can make a recommendation here... Captainoob on YouTube. He has a series where he experiments with various weapons for this game, and West Tek is on his list as a test of strength. He always shows his perk and mod loadout for each weapon he tests and it's a great resource for maximising your build.
---
They double check nothing. 
---
They gotta be the worst gaming company with the lowest standard ever. They even claim stuff is "fixed" in patches when it isn't. (favorites still not working with weapons of the same type to this day)
---
They lie and deserve all the crap they're getting.
---
This has been a thing since the beginning.
---
Since a few XBOX people have mentioned the problem was fixed by deleting the old saved file, I wonder if us PC players can fix it by renaming the old character file and letting the game download a new one. Maybe it's that simple to "fix".
---
Damn, those dudes suck. Good luck with the rest of your time in Appalachia! Don't let them ruin your perspective of online gaming, though, it's fun with the right people!
---
Come on won't be anything special.
---
Oh wow we got a bunny Head wooo not hahah gimme good armour or weapons
---
yeah... that’s not how it works in the quest. i have read the signs, i’ve read the terminal &amp; i have not been able to even see it on a crafting menu.
---
Also Lock And Load still doesn’t work for the Harpoon Gun 💔
---
Do this sh*t in survival not adventure. You people spoil the game for people that don’t like PvP
---
So me looking on map for low level when I’m in desperate need to dump extra stuff to save weight then fast travel near them, find them and jump around like an idiot to get their attention and hope they stop long enough to realize what I’m trying to do is help them isn’t the best strategy? Lmao
---
Lmao I drop my shit and then shoot at it until they finally look haha
---
Uh, I don't recall, must be nobody. Certainly irrelevant, wherever he is.
---
I wonder if you read the sign and skipped the terminal that teaches you to make the armor and went right to scanning your armor? If that's possible I guess you could have missed out on learning to craft the armor. I can craft a level 45 set at maximum INT / durability (3,000 caps: 500 caps per piece) with Targeting HUD (+1,000 caps), Motion-Assist Servos (+500 caps), Optimized Bracers (+500 caps each x2), and Calibrated Shocks (+1,000 caps each x2). If you want it all, 7,500 caps. IGN: jchamlin
---
That’s going to take about 200 cloth and leather, as well as 400 steel, just to clear out all of the vendors caps for the day. It’s much faster to go to harpers ferry, then kill all of the super mutants/scorched, and then sell all the weapons you get to the vendor. I clear out the vendors caps in about 15 minutes, and typically find a legendary enemy along the way.
---
I accidentally drew in a pack of wolves to a house a low level was at and the poor person got killed before I could even drop stuff!! Lol like I said, doesn’t help I’m wearing a nurses dress. Not many get the reference I was aiming for. (I’m a nurse real life too) lmao
---
well we literally dont know lol
---
I agree. So hard to aim, I kinda just guess the halfway point between the site and the gun and hop I hit something
---
Good news, you holier than thou prick: the repair kit thread got unpinned days ago. There's a free slot, so where's your pet thread? Maybe it's not as important as you like to think? Nah... That can't be it.
---
It seems so
---
BOS combat armor plans can be found very rarely in the toxic valley and savage divide, from events, containers, or treasure mounds. If you difnt get the plans before they were removed from the vendor plan pool, you are out of luck.
---
Okay, but only if the bottoms of each jar contain a special encoded message that actually amounts to jack shit.
---
I've had trouble landing kills in pvp with my mirv'd fatmans.. idk I switched back to regular mini nuke to see if it's different, haven't had a chance to look into it further yet
---
Nice, now I want to start server hopping other spawn points to see what else I can find.
---
I don’t believe it was supposed to be nukable per their twitch stream from today. Talked about it being inside so not affected by nukes.
---
Better off selling purified water, unused chems, and junk that is rarely used in addition to the assault rifles from super mutants.. that combo has made quick work of vendor bank for me
---
Just unequip helm on the PA while buddy uses his phantom camera to take pic
---
I lol'd at the title.
---
Violation of hotel policies might result in: detention, removal and/or **death.**
---
Good luck with it. Even if it isn't explosive it can do wonders.
---
It makes perfect sense, now. As a sheepsquatch, I attempted to travel to my mating ground.
---
Then I got captured by the Imperials and ended up on the wagon to Helgen.
---
Bro, I totally forgot about the Diver Suit. If that's not hidden somewhere in the burrows, I'll be super bummed.
---
I had the same problem.  I had to close out the whole game and go back in and then it was there.
---
Yep,but they complain it’s too hard because there’s literally no strategy to the rest of the game.Its a pretty simple mechanic but heh it’s a start
---
Camera content has been pushed back
---
I have checked the armors bench inside the prison about 10 times and nothing spawns for me :(
---
Dont worry about dropping your caps.. you only lose a fraction of your level (1/4) and as long as you don't go running all gung ho into the high traffic areas or top ranked folks, you won't get cap farmed.  But Do stash your aid all except a stimpack or two and maybe a rad away
---
I just do a search for a specific item on recent posts as a starting point.
---
To the best of my knowledge... Initiate, Knight, Knight CPT, Knight SGT, Officer, Paladin and Elder. At least as far as the paints are concerned.
---
Thanks for the tip.
---
It would be great
---
Bah. I traveled for the holidays and didn't take my Xbox.
---
dude keep your head up and move forward, focus on you and your kid, I hate ppl that do this, why should the kid pay for mom and pops problems. but anyways im glad you found you  scape goat, we all dop it. I do too
---
Yeah, pretty frustrating too when the enemy will then return-lunge and insta-kill me because I'm a bloodied build :(
---
I remember seeing tent plans at the Charleston train vendor, but haven’t looked there in awhile, so I’m not sure how current that is (ever since they pooled vendors)
---
Thanks that means all I have left to find is Paladin and Elder
---
More than likely it's just Bethesda fucking shit up again. I ran into a dude who was having the same issue and he didn't know how to fix it either
---
Have you given your PS4 a good cleaning lately? Also make some space if on the hard drive if you don't have a lot of room on it.
---
I got a whole bunch of plans from 2 guys. Ultracite arms and legs and full marine armor! I was like awesome! Then realized they probably had these collecting dust for awhile. Really cool they did that, was like 20 some plans i got from them. 
---
I plan to pay it forward when i get that high level.
---
This happens at whitesprings. The place was recently nuked probably or they copied the spawning codes from the golf club.
---
They've pushed back the release of cameras to work out bugs, but some of the daily quests regarding film and cameras got added by accident.  Community managers have said they will make devs aware.
---
This has bee happening since they added the sheepsquatch quest, your best bet is to wait for the update next week.
---
I predict mass disappointment when this "legendary reroll" system comes out..
---
They had it in Fallout 4
---
ill admit
---
i stole someones steel when they died
---
Well that blows
---
It would be nice.. But I can tell you right now it's your ammo and aid.
---
But you should randomly trip and also take damage for anything you run into.
---
Yeah, some people play 4/7 days per week, but every session longs for 2-3 hours. 
---
My friend plays 1-2 sessions per week, but every session is 4 hours minimum. I think it casual play style.
---
Hate it when that happens :(
---
wow i do not have any where near that many caps.
---
This is like the daggers in skyrim but not worth it.
---
Dude I have the same problem and I just started a new character and die when I’m trying to farm harpers ferry nuked w friends and can’t hit anything to get xp
---
Logging off.
---
Yep.
---
been playing for about 4 days currently at rank 20 I personally thought this game was going to be more hostile based on other open world multiplayer games I have played however I have encountered nothing but kindness also some rank 100 guy dropped me a lot of plans for things I can now build at my camp.
---
Juicehead is definitely a turd most of the time
---
If that's so we may be seeing another "feed the people" incident unfortunately.
---
If you died 2 times in there, while i run no PA rifle build, then you should probably quit the game. The real raids will be to hard for you.
---
Now i need imaginary camera and imaginary friend.
---
Yeah... come on Bethesda, that's an easy one
---
I have, even after I hopped onto a different server.
---
Huh, I tried with mine and it didn't seem to do anything. Guess I got really screwed on the freeze rng. Didn't even slow, let alone freeze, for me.
---
You've never had that happen? Shit sucks. Out ner the edge of the map, and there's Mirelurks razor claws, a Deepwater king or whatever the other variant is, and a queen. Fuck that shit
---
Be on the same team, have the rank of general and go down together
---
The camera is the easier part of that.
---
Xbox?
---
I’m 366 out of 408 GB how much do you recomend I clear ?
---
It seems some have this problem and others don't,  would love to know what is causing it, thanks
---
I check all those boxes.
---
Do they have to be a general too?
---
Yep
---
That's why I think the problem isn't at my end, it started right after the patch.
---
They do if you're high enough level.  When I hear a king I grab the biggest gun I have on me and focus all my firepower on the thing.  I've ignored the queen for 3-4 minutes while I deal with the king(s).  I've even ignored the sbq to deal with a king they are that much of a threat.
---
Why are you taking junk to Encryptid lol. That's like going in to Scorched Earth (or Encryptid even) with pacifist off and complaining that you got killed by a player
---
Agreed.  
---
You can fast travel out of there if you are not overencumbered but usually I am after collecting the nodes.
---
Im cursious if you can pay him with pre war money and get that years worth of cram?! 
---
That would be alot of Cramburgers!
---
Where did you find it?
---
Clean as a whistle mate, done all that yesterday before reinstalling
---
It has its moments. Just after posting this I was mini nuked by a level 145 haha I'm only 95 so I just laughed and left the server.
---
I'd like it if there was a way to sort by Weight (total) instead of just weight individually.  It's nice that sorting by weight brings unscrapped junk to the top, but sometimes I forget that I have 1000 wood scraps at the bottom so don't see that unless I scroll all the way down.  If there was another option that tallied up the weight of the entire stack, that would help in both junk and aid.  And ammo for that matter.
---
Obviously not a high priority fix, but it would be a nice little QoL change if it doesn't take too much effort.
---
Yes, to get into the silo everybody that wants to go in has to have the rank of general to get past the elevator
---
Than I don't know.. I am not experiencing this particular issue .
---
Same b4 the quest line I’d hitch but it was due to server crashes
---
I completely forgot about Bolton Greens. I’m going to hit that tomorrow! Can pick up golf balls there too I bet. 
---
I do hit Morgantown a lot thought. Ohio River Adventures has those life preservers, and Fort Defiance has a ton of plastic bowls, plates and spoons on the top floor.
---
Oh it's far more comical in survival mode, watching everyone die, try to go steal persons bag, get killed, lmao... This event is far more entertaining watching people run for the "doodoo bag" ppl drop when they die, only to get killed when looting it
---
Okay gotcha thanks a ton!! Feel dumb for not thinking of that lol but thanks for the info
---
I'm usually too lazy for ORA and FD lol
---
ouch
---
Oh cool i have a pistol with explosive and mutant on it
---
I am worried about my base too
---
Top tier enemies. Damn. Probably harder that Sheepsquatch.
---
"I wish the only punishment for dying in Adventure Mode wasn't a draw back of any kind"
---
This is what you're saying.
---
Yeh that's what's happening to me, when it freezes it still recognises the input from the controller, I'm going through far too many lock picks in the silo due to this. Also when using x button in power armour, if it freezes I end up exiting the power armour when game catches up. I can't carry on playing like this man lol
---
If FD didn’t have military bags and pouches, I’d stay out of it lol. Mole rats, ghouls and a friggin’ Wendigo? Damn that sweet, sweet ballistic fiber, trying to get me killed.
---
Going there after work. Thanks for the info!
---
This.
---
Even if you have no stash space, you can just drop it on the floor in your base and lock the doors.
---
You say that but it probably wouldn't target enemies then kill you or your teammates the moment you scratched its paint.
---
They are Delivering on their promise though. They are adding updates when they can and also this was the first dungeon that was put in of course its not perfect but its a start.
---
Btw the place is awesome.
---
Its not available yet. Will most like be from atomic shop
---
People still fight the queen?
---
I can’t wait for it to be fixed, but if you’re having trouble aiming use my trick. Works with any gun.
---
1)Start firing in hip fire, DONT AIM DOWN SIGHTS YET.
---
2A)Full autos - keep firing, don’t let up on the trigger, aim down sights after the first or second bullet is fired.
---
2B)Semi-Autos - hip fore as fast as possible, constantly, don’t stop. Aim down sights after first shots fired.
---
3) enjoy crosshairs on screen while aiming down sights. Keep firing and they’ll stay up until you stop firing. Best on high cap mags like Gatling.
---
No meat piles allowed.
---
Thunder Mountain workshop area has some ammo bags too if that's your thing. A little bit of plastic on a picnic table too
---
That would be cool!
---
Ah, misunderstanding.
---
I have Photo of said statue myself and no clue. May refer to Flatwood, but may as well be one of the many oddities of the world imho.
---
Yeh the guys I farm the queen with don't have this problem either but it seems a few others do. If it was only me I'd go so far as to try another PS4 which is what I'm probably going to have to do
---
If you're on Xbox, I can show you a good spot with a lead deposit, a stream for purifiers, and nice scenery: I Am Fake News
---
Does it??? I haven’t been in the mire that much because the anglers gave me tons of trouble. I’m finally specced to take reduced melee damage so I may dive in there and see what I can get. Thanks for the tip!
---
To the the lvl 145+ that mini nuked my camp... I know you got my gamertag from this post lmao. My camp went untouched for weeks until I posted my gamer tag here hahaha. 
---
Glad I'm a junk hoarder..
---
Get a life.
---
101 was also not a control Vault. Vault 8 was.
---
Easy vats her spouts, then run around her shooting... done and dusted, she stands on one spot to turn
---
What did lock and load do
---
Fair enough. Not up to date with my fallout lore these days.
---
There is something about post apocalyptic games that makes your mind to wonder off and relax, especially fallout series.
---
Only 4ish. But it's something lol  Check the tents. Camp McClintock too. 4ish.
---
I personally just go into 3rd person when using a heavy gun. You get the small red dot in the center that definitely helps aim. They do need to fix the sight though.
---
I’ll get a picture of her tomorrow. :)
---
Idk how in other countires but in europe is only 1survival server full. That 30people. Why waste timr on them?
---
yeah I been having the same issue for 2 or 3 weeks now, it makes sound the enime sometimes acts like I hit him but the hit never actually registers, its a pain.
---
I thought exiting the bench was just affecting me and I was an idiot not pressing the right thing. Thanks man. Lol
---
I always hit Camp McClintock. Loose springs galore. The clipboards refresh before the bags do though, so it’s hit or miss whether the two bags are there. Bulk springs sell much better and faster than ballistic fiber anyone, so I don’t mind if I miss it.
---
I agree. I just logged in today to see what changes were made and if there is more carry weight and more storage and nope. Played for 4 hours and said F this no way. I can not and will not play Fallout 76 if they do not increase the weight and storage options by A LOT! I'll stick to the survival games that have unlimited storage better carry weight and a hell of a lot larger build zones where I store all my storage containers as I can do this as long as I farm mats to make more as its unlimited.
---
When I come across another CAMP with a lvl3 locked door I need to get inside.  Either glitching through the window using a workbench or marsupial-ing my way in because they saved budget by not having a roof.  Picking the lock or breaking something to get in is "cheating".  I'm not malicious or anything but something about seeing a level 3 lock makes me need to slip in. 
---
Even if they go to their CAMP and open the door for me I still try to glitch through a window or something, personal quests are the most rewarding quests.
---
And makes all the ghouls glowing ones in the dungeon, and a lot of them become legendary
---
Oooooh. 4 horsemen skins. Coooool
---
Farm breach and clear event and u can get 250 lead from it, but u need acid so go to the toxic valley and kill cryptids there
---
What?
---
you have to remeber that all this is happening at the start of everything, the BoS were not as bad ass in fallout 4 for example. knowledge, experience and time all play a big factor something that they didnt have on fo76. but yeaj they should had sent someone more qualified for the job.
---
I spend so much time using WS workbenches now I've just stopped having a CAMP. I place my camp there with nothing built and hide the CAMP module, good for Fast Travel. Must drive people crazy when they try to make turret camps there and don't know why they can't.
---
Try and take on the SBQ solo unless you already have? I honestly don't know I'm slowly coming to my End game also
---
You were trying to cross the border, right?
---
For what?
---
You reeeeeeally wanna know what the reward is?
---
What about sentinel/assasin guys on console where it is hard to shot vats head crit before they killl you.
---
need an "(Owned)" tag for keys, like the tag for known plans..
---
Should be the same for workshops. As people in Adventure also spawn camp.
---
yeah some ppl are but they are just playing the game, you might see them as dick and the ppl that does that sees you as a dumb ass for not storing your stuff.  you just have to be smarter than them, store your shit before you go to the event and wait until the event is over to loot the boddies laying around. problem solved. 
---
with that said I dont pick them up when I see them but if you leave and dont pick it up is your lost not mines lol .
---
I do various armor/costume pieces but run out of either leather or cloth too fast.  I usually supplement with weapons.
---
Brotherhood recon rifle takes the same materials as a hunting rifle, but the additional mods beefs up the price.  Takes screws and such though so might be too expensive if you craft other things.
---
On the other end of the spectrum, knuckles and tire irons require only steel so are easy to spam produce.  Multi purpose axes only require wood, steel, and oil.
---
And as someone else pointed out, farming weapons directly off enemies works too.
---
Aid is the devil. It weighs too much in your stash so it's easy to be fooled and get the Travelling Pharmacy perk. I had it for so long and have only just got rid of it for those precious points in Strength. 
---
I then sold a whole heap of Stimpaks etc.
---
Raiding and griefing are not synonymous, this was also not griefing.
---
Eh, do try not to track blood on ze crapet! Aha, ha...
---
Alloy metal is incredibly rare to find, but it does drop
---
Next thing people will complain about and demand changed as soon as camps become indestructible is the dropping of junk upon death.
---
Avoid whitespring station sentinel/assasin people sits there, they are immortal, you know
---
Agreed, will add that in.
---
Is cram the reward for paying your debt?
---
Uncommon is more accurate
---
I've been pissed off about the nominal rad resistance for months now. With rad shield and a combination of other chems / edibles you can get it up around 1000 rad resist, but you'll still take lethal RADS in the Blast Zone.
---
So.. unfortunately I missed the first egg due to complete failure of internet. Ya thionk there will be any chance they will add some way to catch up ?
---
Test
---
Idk why are you downvoted, bethesda said people who will have all 7eggs will get adational reward.
---
Play on PC.
---
That isn’t what he was asking really
---
If springs are your thing, server hop at Dolly Sodd's. Bear at spawn, bear by workshop, then make sure to kill the ticks for their blood. About 6ish ticks per hop
---
I have it with guns in melee range both in VATS and outside VATS. Takes back peddling but i work with it.
---
It’s just horribly unbalanced and it really ruins it for me
---
(PvE speaking) It's easy to justify running around carrying those 100 stimpak... But when you realize you're getting 4 stimpaks per 1 you actually use the dynamic changes drastically.
---
Stagger chance?
---
Better yes harder no.
---
Exactly. It took me going into Survival to realise I shouldn't carry that many, and I actually don't use that many anyway. 
---
Trouble is when you die in Survival with 20 Stimpaks you pretty much lose all of them.
---
I have a G.A.S. ticket for a years worth of cram and than he said i owed said amount. And figured i have to pay claim and he didnt say caps so do you have to pay that with pre war money?
---
Collect all the wood!
---
Some of us are physically incapable of activating a conduit long enough for it to be viable to other players. What's the point if it just kills me within 10 seconds with my 76HP? I'd rather someone else take a conduit and let me make it regen after a few hits, that's much more productive. I don't bring junk, but using active pylon players as a metric on whose bag to take when they die is misleading and could cause you to pick up a bag belonging to someone who has dealt a massive amount of damage. A person who has contributed considerably to the fight.
---
There is challenge to kill alien and if you kill flatwood monster it will be checked in. So yeah flatwood monster is only alien ingame.
---
Ironic? It's only ironic in the Alanis Morissette sense of being ironic.
---
i.e. it's not ironic.
---
The Brotherhood of Steel is always looking for Aussie recruits. PM me if you're interested.
---
I just wanted to say your name is funny
---
That's what I thought because I had completed that. I guess The wait continues
---
Alternatively, a Radium Rifle is also good against these bloodied builds if you are Rifle-based build. Doesn't do as much Rads on-hit as a Gamma Gun but if you happen to have, let's say, Executioner's effect on it then you are an absolute nightmare to Bloodied everywhere.
---
Oh shiz it's been removed?! Luckily I got it!!!
---
I did bought full trapper armor, picked all radrezist perks, used stacked-radx. 
---
Found out you can clear silo with this, but in nuke zone you will die fast. Anoying.
---
Berry mentats, Quad tesla modded for automatic fire, tank killer, your own stealth boy, fire at the ground.
---
????????????????????¿????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????¿???????????????????????????????????????????????????????¿???????????????????????????????
---
Not again.
---
You better not sell it to my wife!
---
I don't really want to camp there because everyone else does too. I get tired of 'can't place camp' prompts.
---
It is ironic in the "why am i alive?" sense of being ironic.
---
There is a spot where u can have both lead &amp; acid or lead &amp; junkpile
---
- take no more than 10 Stimpaks and other aid items in.
---
- when you die you will lose these.
---
- transfer caps to another character. 
---
- I am part of a BoS guild and we can upgrade your armour. We can also help you in Survival. PM me if you're interested.
---
Sounds like a supermutant suicider to me. They have mini nukes in them. I came across one after I had killed them and my perception gave me a warning to not check him yet, I backed off and he went boom. Then I collected the loot.
---
find a post with pc flair, click it and it should search posts with that tag in that sub. that’s how i do it anyway
---
Furious is such a garbage effect. In practice the damage increase isn't even noticable. It should at least be noticable!
---
so what do you suggest we do as costumer to get our voices heard?
---
if we what something fix or change in a product we bought the only way is to "complaint about it" and have our voices heard, and the plattaforms we have are limited to reddit,twitter, emails. 
---
I do get we have a plage off ME ME ME ME post but some off us do bring legimited issues to light, 
---
your post  does nothing but add to the problem that IRONICALLY you are complaint about. so you should "grow the fuck up" as well, and instead of adding wood to the fire.
---
Wait a second there’s an auto walk???
---
If i thought about this as guy who was had 30hours played on beta:
---
1. Stability
---
2. Stability
---
3. Stability
---
Anyway they fucked up every feature in every patch so.....
---
Amen brother.  That was a hell of a fight.  We shouldn't be fighting the sb's we should be taming them to fight the damned mirelurks.
---
ONLY managed to obtain 5?!?!? I have been playing for ages now, always do tech data drops, and I've only got Initiate and Knight.
---
I’d like to buy it, I just dont have that kind of dough.
---
Fucking PA skins...need more outfits for us that hate those ugly ass tincan armors !
---
Are you seriously saying toggle ads is a bannable offense?... toggle ads?... maybe you don’t understand what he’s asking...
---
It is ballanced, with shotgun you must be super close. Also everyone using fire proof so explosive don't do damage.
---
Only fucking problem is sentinel/assasin bullshit.
---
Wait why is second egg already available?! Did the first egg get removed all ready?! I just got home for this update and it's already gone?!
---
yes way better than WS
---
Don’t worry about this guy I have no idea what he’s on about. Go to Bethesda’s support site and submit a support ticket with the suggestion. This is just a comfort thing so it will be lower priority but in no way would they ban someone because of an add toggle lmao
---
Lately I have been doing workshop circuits. In quick succession I travel to workshops with whatever resource I need, claim them, set up resource nodes, and go to the next workshop.
---
With this method you could have multiple lead extractors going at once to build up a nice reserve.
---
Haha nubs. Well i am gona kill myself if i miss one more shot with my gauss

^^I ^^am ^^a ^^bot.  ^^Feedback ^^appreciated.
---
I'd love this to work :(
---
Is it in the wild or a workbench
---
Wild
---
I love you.
---
Just wait until it's teenaged.
---
Buts it a challenge to place the camp module to reach both acid&amp; lead. But it can be done
---
I'll buy YOUR EnTirE sToCK!
---
Where is said location?
---
Here’s hoping they bump the server size to 32 in coming months.
---
I was mostly talking about sentinel/a couple other bullshit combos and bloodied builds. Not worried about underlying weapon balance when these fucks are nigh invincible
---
Going to my camp and rushing towards a workbench to scrap junk even though I scrapped it all already to be able to fast travel but who knows if I acquired random junk while fast traveling.
---
I blasted through in less than 15 minutes because there where 6 people already down there. And yeah i tried server swapping. Still tonnes of people
---
I’m pretty sure only armor gets bonuses for over repairing
---
That was two patches ago, now vats is again broken i can't hit anything mooving with 95% gauss shots.
---
Unfortunately it's a low risk and easy way to kill other players. 
---
Survival can take too long to track someone down.
---
I cleared it in like less than 10m. Everything was lvl 68 it was pretty easy.
---
My friend lordbaronstein had the same problem. He managed to sort it a bit by deleting like 300 friends from his psn.
---
my goal is chameleon bos armor
---
Thank you, gonna check this out right now.
---
I keep looking but it’s not showing up for me. 😔
---
I took a screenshot but i dont kmow how to get it to you lol
---
So let me get this straight - just so we are both clear i am understanding correctly.
---
Everyone's feedback about how the dungeon was pretty much crap and ways to improve upon it is simply complainers that wanna game for 40 hours a week?
---
So i assume every kiss arse here is what, casual gamer who spends the majority of their time with their families or off doing charity work and spends the 2 - 4 hours they can get away from it all on a game?
---
You also mention they are an unhealthy minority - do you have any stats to back that up or is that simply your own opinion - because if it is simply your opinion, then better to say that than state an absolute in an attempt to mislead a reader of your post.
---
Would it surprise you to know that the vast majority of people posting these negative posts about the Burrows are actually casual gamers that spend, at most, 7 hours a week on games, Fallout 76 being just one of a few titles they have to then divide this time between.  Don't ask me where i got that from though.
---
See how that works?
---
As for who cares about the status quo in video games - i would imagine anyone that spends their hard earned cash on it - such as yourself. 
---
If you don't care, then why is it you hope the developers do not listen to "them" - is it because you wish to maintain the status quo? Food for thought!
---
Ultimately, no harm can really come of this and the only consequences i can see is that content further down the pipeline might be reexamined, held back form announcement and reworked to ensure a more engaging plot, some character backgrounds, a lot more exploring and perhaps certain mechanics to proceed.
---
Hardly a bad thing .
---
I'll do that, if you ever find a way to kill off the other flair entirely, hollar.
---
I may even have a Chameleon piece or 2 for trade (not sure though I'll need to check).
---
Hmm interesting, I probably have 300+ friends on my list from adding them for trades. I will try this soon thanks
---
Post it on a forum like the f076 bazaar or somewhere that allows photos and tell me. I can go to your profile and find it from there
---
I've only ever got initiate. I got knight from as a random award. For claiming a workshop of all things.
---
everyone in the team or anyone wanting to go down a silo need to have the rack of general, that means you need to complete the Enclave questline, only way to get the general rank.
---
I hope it works for you. It worked for him, and some of his friends, that also had high numbers
---
Totally forgot about that. I just set it up. Done and done.
---
Let me know if it works
---
My strategy was to buy the plans, create two Handmades, stash one and keep using the other. It takes still like 70-100 drops (2-3 days of grinding at my drop rate), but I started getting them a bit more often as the game is now aware of my preference. Still it gets outpaces by the truckload of armors...
---
Unstable Isotope
---
it would have to be tomorrow exhausted from 3 scorchbeast queen fights and a sheepsquach tonight lol
---
So a super-wendigo suicider exists too?
---
Either the caps which change hands upon PvP death in survival are inconsequential and leveling up isn't a big deal or it's profitable to PvP in survival, same rules apply to both parties.
---
&gt; On top of that, people can just give me a bounty which completely negates my chameleon mutation.
---
Like the bounty you claim you give yourself to *attempt to start* the PvP encounter in adventure mode?  
---
You dont find people to duel in adventure mode, you find people to harass.  Yes, some of then fight back though I'm guessing at least a minority of those fighting back wouldnt if they fully understood the PvP mechanics of adventure mode.  Without the player you're harassing  fighting back you deal 0 damage to them, how exactly does not being able to freely PvP make PvP better? Dont you wind up wasting caps and time fast traveling around harassing people who server hop?  Time and caps you could be spending in survival mode actually doing the PvP you claim to want.
---
Oh didn't see the wendigo bit..... Maybe they do explode now?
---
Ok i'll do that
---
I was running a bloodied build with about 20% of my health, overencumbered and with zero stamina and unlike all of the whiny "there's only five ghouls in the entire dungeon" people I was actually in a fresh spawn getting jumped by at least half a dozen ghouls at a time.  So if I were you, I'd fuck right off.
---
I missed it, it took about 32 minutes to update and I had 30 minutes to do it
---
I have the perfect place for that rolling pin.... unsure if the devs can sit while pumping out their updates or they may need to stand.
---
Their choice.
---
Breach and clear has daily cooldown though. But still the most efficient way to get lead besides cheesing server hop.
---
There’s a theory that states that we may be smart people that must be the ones to re build America. But rather dumb of smart people.  
---
Like we are to be the best and brightest but we can’t figure out how to make simple machines and concepts. 
---
And vault 76 may have been a “control” vault but we may have been part of a subliminal experiment. Someone made a video on yt about. It’s something like if given the chance would we follow orders or revolt something. 
---
The overseer kinda hints at this in her tape you get when you nuke a non fissure site.
---
Uploaded to bazar
---
Yep, That's happening to me as well. Getting really annoying when it happens in gunfights. I think I'm aiming one way, it lags, then I'm way off and missing said shot/melee attack. I'm going to assume it's just a bethesda bug, and will be fixed in the next update. Hopefully.
---
I went Bastet Blade to Combat knife as well. I guess it's just inevitable. 
---
Ultimately though I ended up with a Mutation heavy, low hp, unyielding, stealth, unarmed, melee build. 
---
Sooo, my tip for super mutants is to go after melee mobs first, and then while hack'n away, position yourself so that the mute in front of you is blocking the line of sight of the ranged ones.
---
Also, buzz blade is a gimick and a joke.
---
Also also, the new Buroughs quest rewards a pretty decent 2 star unique assaultron blade. I would suggest picking it up.
---
farm cans and server hop. the hotel near the top of the world has a lot of those traps.
---
Nope would hurt the economy a lot.
---
I think it’s related to the 1hit kill prevention that got implemented and somehow it happens to in game enemies as well as pvp instances.
---
I agree but if we may both be honest it would destroy the RNG. Having it like it is makes for the trading of sturdy or heavy pieces more valuable. Even really good light rolls can still be super valuable.
---
Just got the paladin and there is ZERO difference from the officer one.   
---
That's low Beth :(
---
Cripple the legs and the spouts and she’s lunch.

I'm down

Outstanding Move

WE NEED ANSWERS.  
---
Prob PC. I'm over 300 hours on xbox and never saw this
---
No.  Its the part where you listen to the Novice Holotape and told to log into Crypto to research the 3 items.
---
The login screen is blank.   No logins at all.
---
Some guy just commented about his friend having same problem, deleted a lot of friends and it fixed it, guna try that soon
---
I'm hoping for a baby deathclaw
---
DO IT!! I need a xenomorph deathclaw in my life!!
---
On ps4. Im level 11. Im one of probably 3 people activating pylons and i died probably a handful of times. I went to the event for fun and maybe a plan from the event reward (got one!). I shot the dude a few times and helped where i could get people back up. 
---
Its cool seeing the high level players in their power armor or regular armor. Someone dropped a 2 star trapper leg too that i took only because it seemed no one cared to loot it. Im there for the event itself and have some fun. I always stash my junk before i go though. Rule 1, stash yer loot!
---
Mods for Excavator currently. I have Motion Assist, Optimised Bracers and Calibrated Shocks currently. Saving for Targeting HUD.
---
Oof
---
What's the deal with technical data? Does it spawn in set locations or is it random? I play several hours everyday and haven't found one in well over a month.
---
Yeah, I missed the first one too.  
---
Guess I’ll set up a notification on my phone for when Fallout tweets.
---
My brand new camp north of HF got nuked yesterday. Didn't log out beforehand cause i wanted to see the area with this but the server kicked me out. Logged in and got lucky - "your camp could not be placed" and moved my camp for free.
---
Or you can stop setting expectations that lead to your disappointment? Let a feature come out and then explain how it works. Everyone on here has this dream idea of how it’ll work and if it doesn’t work the way everyone assumes it’ll be “failure at launch” and “they fucked us over” all up and down this sub.
---
Huh, I just used my Troubleshooter's Minigun that I use for Silos. The thing tears the Sheepsquatch up when the pylons are actually activated for once, I can barely keep the one active and it seems like everyone else is too busy trying to kill the invisible sheepsquatch.
---
I played until 11pm (gmt+1) and the new egg hasn't been released for me so it might be possible that you can still get the old one if u are quick
---
Complaining has never been helpful? What planet are you living on?
---
Complaining is a form of feedback - something more valuable to a billion dollar company than posts such as "good job, keep up the good work - ignore the haters etc etc"
---
When one issue creates a mass amount of complaints for a company, be it on social media, email, over the phone or all of the above combined, internal files are opened categorizing the different aspects of each.
---
Once enough of a sample is gathered, reports are pulled and items can then be displayed in pure data form as to the biggest issues being raised.
---
This is how companies determine priority for improvements on an existing product as well as ensuring the same mistakes are not repeated in future products.
---
As for calling someone an idiot - while that's not something i would do personally, but i can certainly understand why someone would resort to that after once again being mislead on a product. 
---
This is the second time i have seen you state that a healthy person doesnt pay video games "that way" - again assuming complaints are only those spending an unhealthy amount of hours playing a video game, and in fact assuming most these people are in fact doing so.
---
Has every person that has complained stated how many hours per week they play and you have been taking note of this or are you just talking crap?
---
If you are not talking crap - then please by all means provide us with where this information is available. Otherwise, i would suggest when you are making assumptions and guesses to serve your own narrative that you clearly state so.
---
I'll buy it at a high price, stranger!
---
Damn stormcloaks.
---
It's great😍 how can you build that much🤔
---
Man you don’t need to buy the plan (unless you want to make a bunch and sell them), many vendors carry the Targeting HUD mod from time to time, it doesn’t say for Excavator, just ‘targeting HUD’. 
---
If you’re on PS4 I can mod yours for Reactive Plate, it’s very effective. It’s the only plan i bought for the excavator PA because I’ve never seen the mod at vendors. I was just in the burrow for the first time, the boss assaultron went transparent and came to dash-drill me and fell dead, because of my Reactive plate. I was like wth just happened lol.
---
I had the same problem. Turns out, across the water from the den is another pile of bones with the last journal page on them. Confusing.
---
Delete friends , I had like 500 n now I have 100 n it runs smooth no prob
---
I did get an egg tonight but it said it was available for 18 hours so i assume it is the second egg.  I logged in at 1am est.
---
It don't explain quills found in sheepsquatch victims.
---
I went to the burrows for the first time last night with a friend and I saw 4 eyebots, 1 gutsy and 1 assaultron. None of which were legendary. It's obvious I went there shortly after someone had cleared it but it is possible for there to be no enemies
---
Menu &gt; filter by
---
Although the menu option doesn't always show up for me
---
Actually, if you fast travel there's a huge chance the pack disappears.
---
Never mind the OP - Posting a complaint about people complaining is just comedy gold - just have a laugh and leave it at that. I am sure the irony will dawn on him someday.
---
Lol we know it won't be that good now come on. Lol
---
Some of us did the sheepsquatch in adventure tho.
---
And if you're taking your time to cherry pick my loot, you're not useful to the event either.
---
great help, Thanks
---
I posted about this a long time ago after the first and second patches. Since then I haven't had any trouble but I always do option 1 after a patch. I got my idea from FO4 forums, same issue with that when mods first released, and from contacting Bethesda and this is what they told me to do. 
---
Option 1:
---
Clear cache and rebuild database. Since the PS4 does not have a clear cache tool there is only one way:
---
Power system down and wait for all of the lights to go off. Unplug the system and wait 15 seconds (I'd wait about 10 minutes just to be sure all the capacitors discharge). Plug the system back in and hold the power button in for 15 seconds or until you hear the second beep. This starts a special service mode. Select option 4 to rebuild database. 
---
Option 2:
---
If the first option doesnt work then you have a bad file somewhere. The only way to rid the system of that data. 
---
You must delete the game data and the save files. This will NOT delete your character data, the character data is stored on Bethesda servers, it only delete controller preferences, options, and pictures. Once all FO76 data is deleted restart the system reinstall the game and all updates and then do Option 1. 
---
I had to do Option 2 myself and can say I was sweating bullets afraid I'd lose my characters but I didnt. Really sad there isn't an easier way but the PS4 just doesnt have the tools. Good luck!
---
Valid point.
---
Dracarys
---
Move your base to an acid deposit, go to lucky hole mine and refine all the lead ore you get from there with the acid you collect.
---
Have to admit I agree dude. Also I'm new to online gaming, used to play cod ages a go but only just got into as I'm a big fallout fan and 76 is online lol. What does RNG?
---
That and more clutter - the very thing he said he wanted everyone to stop doing.....
---
I run bloodied as well, so whats the issue? And come pvp me, i dont mind killing another whiny bitch.
---
Sure!
---
If you have to repair guns hourly, especially ballistic guns, you have a serious l2p issue. Sorry to be that guy but even my laser gun lasts way longer than that.
---
Ricky, it’s that god damn Sheepsqamch again!
---
Found that near the Overseer's and thought maybe Deathclaw. Cool to hear it's the Squatch!
---
Looking to sell any of these?
---

---
A TSE heavy gun or a Two Shot Fatman will solve this problem in a matter of seconds, always has for me.
---
My misses is a casual - has put a few hours in here and there since December - is level 67 i believe as of last night. 
---
It didn't take her much longer than it took me - So before i go back to her to explain this can you just clarify, what are these "plenty of things" she could be doing?
---
And im the guy who nuked facshnaught and did it with the mask on and Marched along no PA! Does no one have FUN ANYMORE!
---
When I go to the menu, it just shows a button for Discord.
---
I find melee combat frustrating and unresponsive. Sometimes my mouse left click doesn’t register and swing my weapon as well as registered swings nor hitting. Equally annoying is that the game often freezes for a second or two when using any weapon
---
My theory is I will not take from a paper bag during the event. And once the event wraps, you got maybe 60 seconds to pick that junk back up. If you decide not to, someone’s gonna get that bag. 
---
I’m not rushing over to any bag, but if the event wrapped a couple minutes ago and the owner can’t be bothered to pick up the bag, I’ll help them out :)
---
(Also, I’ve fast traveled into this event twice after crafting several stable flux. Oops. I ran back to my bag super fast.  Health drain from those pylons is no joke)
---
maybe if someone drop the first egg in your camps it still yould count just a suggestion though ?
---
No, it is not "well done" anything, and BGS is in NO position to be "trolling" anybody. They promised us a high level dungeon that would be balanced for multiple high level characters, and we got an extremely short and extremely easy basement that went against what they told us. After all the stuff that's been going on with the game, BGS shouldn't be lying to the community, so they shouldn't be congrulated.
---
Too bad no one knows what you play on.
---
lmao, I was waiting for a drill but that would do too !!!!
---
Ha ha came to say something similar to why I want a mobile app too..
---
What the??? Where's the fun in that? 
---
I occasionally enjoy a spot of PvP but it's usually people who own workshops (and therefore agree to open themselves up to PvP), I try to stick to players my level or above, never anyone under level 50 and never destroy other players camps.
---
Completely close game, and restart. New egg will be in shop.
---
Just take your helmet off? 
---
....Pretending we have cameras anyway.
---
How about when VATS melee hits just dont activate (swing) at all even though you're close enough to be able to shove your forearm down that ghoul's throat? That bugs me more than the non-registering of hits.
---
sounds like you're just being pessimistic.
---
commenting because I would also like to know
---
Android or iPhone? Works for me on android
---
I hosted karaoke for a few months at my local bar, and every week, without fail, a group of drunk college boys would sing country roads.
---
So no... It no longer brings a smile to my face.
---
this started to happend to me only after the lastest patch, and I have been playing from the beta.
---
So cool.
---
Some people farm for it at VT university, the military wing of the WS bunker or end of dungeon crates in exchange for ammo and a few stims/water/rad away with a chance of a brotherhood outfit or paint (power armor or combat armor)
---
i have the same gun, is very powerful when it works, but haven’t played for s while. i left it in my stash because the gun was broken? the projectiles clipped through AI and players alike
---
Is it one star
---
it would look good with the assaultron helmet too.
---
ya'll are lucky. I have over 600 hours in and havent even gotten initiate yet. :(
---
no no lo eres
---
&gt; Man you don’t need to buy the plan
---
I'm aware, but my main is a Crafter, so I collect plans.
---
&gt;it doesn’t say for Excavator, just ‘targeting HUD’. 
---
Another way you can tell because it will scrap in to Black Titanium.
---
&gt;I was just in the burrow for the first time, the boss assaultron went transparent and came to dash-drill me and fell dead
---
Welded Rebar is better for that I understand - (Another Mod I'll be looking to get) - But only works for Melee
---
When I first crafted my x-01 was back when the game first launched. It vanished after the recent update.
---
I haven't attempted to craft anymore since then because I now only have the option to craft level 40.
---
My turrets vanish from my base and re-appear all the time. Eventually, however, the turrets randomly will return. One day you'll log in, and they'll all be back.
---
[https://i.imgur.com/Mi1PKoh.png](https://i.imgur.com/Mi1PKoh.png)
---
This is how I have four turrets all within the same area. Two are too close to one another for legal placement and the two others next to it are literally on the exact same space (looks like the turret has two cannons).
---
Again, I've had every last turret at my base vanish like this multiple times now.
---
Hmmmm 🤔I can dig it .
---
Android note 9
---
 Damn, rng is an ass
---
None of the camera challenges are completable as we do not have the camera yet. Crafting film is also not possible, as again, no camera. Because why would Bethesda fix the weekly/daily challenges when they can just not instead.
---
Perfect thank you.  Firecracker whisky hunt needed then, never seen anyone with this.
---
i think you can craft one on the thinkers bench if im not mistaken.
---
I just want to know what the reward is.
---
I really want that mounted deathclaw head, or some kind of deathclaw mask
---
Yes it is
---
Odd. Don't know what the deal is then.
---
Xbone and yep same
---
Ah well, ty anyway
---
Except you did, I don’t follow this subreddit because I hate people that play games? Just *ask* man, I’m right here
---
Ha! I like it
---
Not without a broken uplink. And that’s my issue.
---
I hear that a lot and it's great in theory but a lot of the ones I've seen are rocking a TSE automatic weapon of some kind themselves so they end up lighting you up first before you get the chance to stagger. It works better vs the melee builds as long as you can either vats them down before they try to marsupial hop into a vats hit but everyone else is just not worth losing  the caps to.
---
Same, took all of my junk out of my stash earlier to sort it, found out that I had almost 600lbs of junk, most of which I didn't even need. And here I thought it was all of my outfits that were taking up my stash.
---
After the first level 200 repeatedly spawned killed me at my camp  when I was level 12(i respawned there to see how many times they would do it) I stopped keeping any drops/caps on me. At least 5 other high levels chose to kill me over 5 times in a row. 
---
Its worst at events when everyone respawns at the same spot and you don't get to choose a station or vault or camp. Those are instant camped deaths, even when you don't have rewards for them. Too many TSE or 1punchmen leftover from the Dupacalypse. 
---
It really needs fresh characters that can't swap servers. Turrets or defender bots to aggro whoever shoots. Always a bounty and map ping without needing 200 caps to put the bounty. Lore-wise we all have computers on our wrists that should be able to ping a killer of a fellow vault dweller, instead of a dead person putting a bounty on their killer after their killer took some caps and junk already.
---
That seems totally safe and not at all a trap. Do you have tea?
---
This plus no hits in vats even if I'm standing on top of them. And getting controller feedback, blood splatter, a "you hit" noise and no damage.
---
And it is super helpful when you kill something before it even registers your existence and boom, bone worms. Gank it from behind? Rad worms. Look in its general direction? Sludge lunge.
---
I was wondering how you could stock up on fusion cores! I've been going around just looking for power armor sitting around to take it from  lol
---
I use a two shot gatling plasma for whenever I run through robots and there are barrels and mods for it, the ammo is heavy but my character build is all about making ammo junk and armor weigh less so i can horde as much as possible when i adventure, but only downside to the gun for me is its meant for robots but the accuracy is awful close and far just about 5-15 feet is best accurate and it melts ghouls and robots so depends if you're around those a lot and have enough weight or ammo to handle the gun
---
What console?
---
Pc
---
The higher your level, the more you can build
---
Sry I'm pretty new here, what's wrong with power attacking sheepsquatch? Are you saying it's better to just do regular attacks?
---
No worries. Have a nice weekend!
---
They don’t know yet lol
---
Yep I agree with this. Been trying to figure out how it'll work and this feels like one of the stronger candidates. Though I'm kinda hesitant to believe they'll not just have complete rerolls of all stars or just create new weapons from scratch.
---
Uranium fever makes me crash at the moment.
---
Ehh ok, so I guess there’s that. I could just save a screen shot if I really wanted to. But you’re probably on point with that.
---
I actually made a Paladin Danse imposter in the game purely cos my friend did an Elder Maxson one and figured why not. 😅 It has been fun. 
---

It'd definitely be an incredible convenience to be able to do this.
---
\+karma
---
Can't say I've experienced that when I've had to do this, personally.
---
I don't necessarily doubt it can happen though, lol. Luv u todd
---
We're looking into this is the "response now". A week will pass, this will be completely irrelevant and you'll "still be looking into this".
---
How about you compensate us with free atoms every time you screw challenges up ?
---
They get the bonus from demolition expert
---
I'm on Xbox and have only had the issues the past week.
---
The  legendary effect is compatible with demolition expert but sadly not with grenadier :)
---
And I thought losing my Excavator leg with Calibrated Shocks was bad, but this bug isn't new, I think it's just become more common, I remember hearing about this bug a couple months ago. It's a nightmare bug for sure though, I'd be royally pissed off if one of my legendary weapons disappeared.
---
Tell me about it haha
---
Not a bad idea. You can be sure that this team would not be able to incorporate something that complicated.
---
Moved my camp to a new location and for the past few days it has been super mutants, molerats, or scorched. The day I put one of eggs in my camp I start having low level deathclaws attack. Today I put a second and a higher level deathclaw attacks. Probably not related but just weird.
---
It's a perk for reload speed on heavies
---
Thanks for the info. I guess I will keep it for now, beef it up a little and see what it does. I mostly use all rise or my level 50 3*** mutant ax. My best weapon is a level 50  mutant ( does 10% more damage if mutated) two shot explosive lever action.
---
‘Selling an idea’ doesn’t necessary mean for cash. Selling like actually wanting it.
---
They get the bonus from their weapon type and Demo Expert, which can make them very powerful.
---
Yes they should
---
I just don't use it. I've used the gatling gun for forever on my current character, so I've just gotten a feel for where abouts it should hit when I'm downsights.
---
It can definitely be frustrating for people new to the gun or if it's not your main gun though.
---
“Clever girl”
---
I got the first one, the 2nd (Patterned Deathclaw Easter Egg) should be available "Apr 17 - Apr 18" I just checked about an hour ago, it's not there.
---
We are between 8pm EST April 17th and 8pm April 18th, the next egg (Paint Splotch Deathclaw Easter Egg) should be available tonight starting at 8pm 
---
I did note the "find" it in the store, I looked through the whole store and did not "find" it.
---
Dude- that would be a cool little addition. Of course they haven’t mentioned it or will ever do that. They’re giving us a camera in a game we already take pictures in and Easter eggs instead of raider decor like a crucified skeleton.
---
Oh cool thanks
---
Do missile launchers and the M79 benefit from grenadier? It feels like they do but it’s pretty hard for me to measure as I shoot them.
---
The moment when the queen turns into a scorched makes me dead inside
---
i went to the burrows once to do the so called quest [ coughjokecough]  went back once again because it was nuked..not much to talk about..wont be going back there because if you die you have to respawn outside. also the bug where you can only respawn at vault 76 is very offputting..im in the burrows..i may die then have to spawn at v76 then fast travel back.to harpers ferry then another load screen to get back into the burrows..no thnx..
---
Thanks for the tip. Seems like I require the PC version of FO76 but only got the PS4 one. Anyone know what's the minimum requirement of files /registry entries to successfully run FO76Edit? Would it be enough to just copy the SeventySix.esm from a friend, do I need some other files to or do I actually have to install the game completely?
---
[https://i.imgur.com/3RT2MBE.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/3RT2MBE.jpg)
---
Thanks, next time I'll try it. And I hope they fix this asap, is very annoying.
---
Yep. Like the BBC giving far right groups and climate change deniers a platform on debates. Because it's 'balanced'.
---
Can you eat and report the video, that hunger bat is bother me way more than it should be.
---
I was so bored today that I crafted mini nukes and began blowing up a players C.A.M.P. Next to Morgantown Station.
---
Nice lever action! Most people are using melee in this current meta but I'm still trying out all different types of weapons to see what is most versatile, currently my main weapons are a anti armor boxing glove very easy to repair just cant use in power armor, I have an instigating dragon and I carry an explosive gatling gun and the ammo for that is very easy to make and keep around. I think any light melee with decent damage and one or two ranges weapons is enough to walk around with but that's my preference
---
Got caught lying, lost legitimacy, slunk off into the shadows.
---
yeah, I've lost so many pets to the game just not working :(
---
Ooohoo I need this, too! And google failed me, as well. Boooooogle.
---
Nope. Just the prime receiver. I made a post with this very idea and more. 
---
Crossbows need luv.
---
Unfinished buggy games. I also put too much time into this. @_@. Also, they aren’t delivering what they promised.
---
I can Alloy all metal pieces if you are on xbox
---
Also I think maybe they'll have more tiers of pricing, so maybe you can choose to customise one star, but it will cost a shitload of tokens compared to just doing a complete reroll or minting of a new item.
---
So I noticed this from the like 2 patches ago.   But I had traded 3 of my agility points to intelligence, so I thought not being max in agility might of been making me miss.
---
But I didn't see anyone else really complain about it so I thought it was a non issue, but it does seem like they changed something.
---
Doesn't seem right that I am running full steam into a mob and hit it with my 2hdr just to have it stand there and smile.
---
Tesla coils
---
Yeah I did those ones but they opened up the meat pie and wendigo yesterday so I'm thinking each week we will get a few more to complete
---
It needs insanced, though. Too many people camping in the tunnels after a nuke trying to steal as many Legendary kills as possible.
---
Not all volunteers are useful. Look at the responders, they’re all dead. :)
---
Uranium has a pretty long half-life (depending on the isotope.)....Try a different element ;)
---
Omg, that’s pretty clever- my easy going teammate will drop his jaw when I use this idea to destroy something at his camp.
---
If you wait a min or so and back out then go back in to the vendor you can buy it back. For about 3-4x what you sold it for.
---
Hah, bamboozled! Don't carry that much shit.
---
It doesn't ever drop, currently. Needs a patch.
---
I'm not sure if this perk is only for Grenades, but btw I never saw that the explosion is 100% bigger then without the perk. But I haven't play for 2 month so I'm not sure if this was a bug that the explosion looks normal. Have to check it out when I came from work
---
I think we should all receive complimentary atoms for the undoable camera challenges. But that's just me.
---
Awesome thank you, would explain why ive never seen it. Many thanks for letting me know
---
You got bamboozled!
---
Now that I think about it, I didn't get the Meat Pie quest from Van Lowes, I got it from a shack northwest of Berkley which gave me the two chems as a reward. I honestly can't remember what I got as a reward from the Unsolved quests I got at Van Lowes. All I know is I have the Wolf, Wendigo, Radstag, Bear, and Owlete heads, and Wolf is the reward for the main part of that questline. So, unless I'm mistaken again,  I must have gotten the other 4 heads from the Unsolved.
---
Anyone else recognize BIV's voice actor in the new Burrows questline?
---
Yup good ole vendors resell it at 2x3 times what they bought it for.
---
Side note where is the Death Claw eggs in the C.A.M.P menu? Didnt want to make sub for a little thing as that.
---
&gt;...and I guarantee that the same folks will chew it down in 16 hour days and Red Bull fueled weekends, and take to the internet in droves to bitch about how easy it was and how it was too short.
---
what a shit argument,literally no one complained about the witcher 3s length and the game currently sits at 50 hours average on hltb or 32 hours rushed ,if you finish a 32 hour game in 3 days yeah you have issues but when  the new content is not even a hour long you have a legitimate complaint,you can make the content easy but still decently long like normal dungeons in world of warcraft casual friendly but still not 5 minutes
---
PSA: dis mine now
---
Damn, well sorry dude.
---
Luckily I change mine back before they broke MODs.
---
It was not quite what I expected either, wasted a few hundred caps.
---
Is there more than one picture, or is my internet being weird?
---
Where do we find said eggs in our camp menu?
---
Keep it for queens
---
You see, I thought the same thing too cause I recall seeing weapons/armor I'd sold to vendors being in their inventory, but lately when I check, they just aren't there, and there's been nobody else around to go in and immediately buy them right behind me. Either my system is on crack (and it's brand freaking new), or that's just how much this game hates me.
---
If it’s about the dupe glitch while trading I submitted a report about it. You should too
---
Damn imperials
---
That’s a bummer. I just sold some stuff and the vendor had everything and I can buy it back if I want.
---
My base cat be destroyed and it’s a couple hundred feet in the air so
---
To be fair, I now have 2 1\* Tesla's a Quad and a Nocturnal.
---
Floor decorations.
---
If you’re going to have heavy guns in your inventory the bear arms perk is a must.
---
I like to nuke.
---
Thank you.
---
I'll have to keep an eye on it in the future and see if it's just me or my game being stupid. Probably me, LoL. However, I still think a buy back option would save players a whole lot of hassle.
---
So you're saying it's proving rather dangerous to go into the immediate aftermath of a nuclear explosion?  I am shocked.
---
They did nothing to warent being reported by the sound if it.   Don't stress over digital materials.
---
I never have junk on me tbh as soon as I've got stuff I scrap it and store it as soon as I can. But if I didn't I'd deffo store it before the event as you're 100‰ going to die. A random higher level who wanted to team up died and someone was picking all the bags up. So I was like not today Satan and got it all for him so I could give it back to him as he has a shit tonne of ballistic on him. If people see an opportunity the chances are they're going to take it, its unfair but it is what it is.
---
I wish there was a longer countdown to the event like the SBQ, I'm normally grabbing the pylons to make it easier on people but I'm not always kitted to be stiming myself like that in normal adventure.
---
So when I see the even pop up, i have to travel to my base, which is at the foot of sheepsquatch hill, dump my junk, swap out my perks for my power armor, heavy guns, and quack surgeon, swap out my melee for my cryolater pop into my PA and run up the hill.
---
As fast as I am doing this, some people have nearly beaten the 'squatch before I get up there.
---
Another way to make caps is to go through fort defiance and sell all the straight jackets in there. Or go through a nuke zone and pick all the flora to sell
---
Yep. For the Harpoon gun it let you reload faster but doesn’t allow you to shoot, it’s just totally broken.
---
Not true. Furious works great on automatic weapons and melee weapons with continuous damage such as the ripper.
---
&gt;In case you haven’t humbled your ego yet, no one is responsible for catering to you because you jammed 600 hours in less than half a year and got bored. You account for about 5% of the entire player base. You’ll get your high level raids, nuclear winter, new main quest, legendary perks and plenty more to do over the next quarter.
---
and a lack of endgame is a genuine concern,how many mmos got shit on for their lack of end game destiny/anthem ring a bell? you don't have to be a super hardcore mythic raider to enjoy harder content ,sure there are 2 hour a week casuals but what about the core and hardcore gamers that want to play your game are you gonna shit on them for wanting to play more a game they enjoy ? a game that is heavily starved of content i might add ,how many people do you know that played since launch or in the past months that still play and log in anymore do you know? my friend list is a ghost town and barely anyone plays anymore because there is NOTHING to do
---
&gt;while also respecting the humans that design your games for 8-10 hours a day then return home to their families, and occasionally donate some of that time to address your concerns here.
---
oh ffs,they had the audacity to give us a half finished game which was unstable buggy and with poor optimization for months not to mention those people get paid they don't work pro bono its literally their job to give us quality content
---
I don't think anyone really knows anything about him other than location right now
---
Same. I loot the boss,grab the lead and scrap off the robots and if there's any bags still around after all that, finders keepers.
---
Awesome! That's a super creative build, and I like the various decorations! That's a very lovely view! 
---
The lack of wall in the bathroom would take some getting used to though. 
---
I like the lamps on your bedside tables! Do you happen remember what the plans for those were? The various posters, plants, and bearskin rug and fireplace were all nice touches.
---
I’m hoping it lets us add legendary perks onto those two and other existing names legndaries
---
It takes a few minutes - Last night I made and sold about 20 hats to the Grafton Vendor, went nad did Grafton day, went back with the Supermutant weapons to sell and my hats were there.
---
Do you mean that outfit the guy with the .50 Cal has equipped? Looks like a full set of Robot Armor. Maybe with another skin, but the backpack looks really Robot Armor-ish. Helm could be the Eyebot helmet.
---
Then the trading community will have some really wicked stuff
---
Ya that too
---
Oh man, I thought you were joking.
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/beadhp/daily_reminder_innocent_players_are_still/
---
Nice!
---
What platform are you on?
---
Liveeeee serrrrvicccceeee uuuuserrrr engagemennttttt
---
My figuring was that you trade in legendaries for tokens then use those tokens to buy/spin the wheel on new items more tokens higher star rating spat out not upgrades for current items
---
But I could be 100% wrong
---
I got that exact same thing the last time I played the Sheepsquatch event!
---
I wish they would fix the pitiful ghoul count.  Make it truly dangerous down there.
---
RNG technically stands for random number generator, but in a looter it is how the loot drops are random. For instance there isn't a set enemy or boss to get x weapon from unless it's a quest reward item. 
---
If you want to really get into how RNG got adopted to a looter game term I can tell you but it gets into the "nerdier" part of it.
---
Either way I’d be happy tbh.
---
i havent played the game in a while. but the game is up to date on one of my computers. however i got a new apartment and i spend half my time there so i dont have access to that pc at all times. 
---
that being said, id be happy to help out by looking something up for you when i have the time.
---
Pacifist mode and a Tesla rifle tag everything in the room with a couple of shots
---
But seriously just play the game don't worry about nuke zones do the quests have fun
---
Clearing your friend list works mate
---
Unfortunately, that is the curse of the online game. Best work around I know of is server hop until one of your group finds a server with a lot of low levels, and nuke that server. They won't be fighting to take your ghouls.
---
THIS
---
Worked a treat mate thank you so much 👍🏻
---
Clearing friend list works
---
Update w/ Spoilers:
---
There are 2 notes/tapes, both of which mention survivors heading to Mosstown. I went to Mosstown, but only one thing stood out there. A sonic generator, identical to the one at Fort Defiance. I haven't seen that there before, nor have I seen one outside of Defiance. Definitely Brotherhood tech, but kinda suggests someone survived the Burrows and then built a sonic generator next to a fissure site. Pretty sure you don't need to attract a Scorchbeast with tech, nor do you want to do so without better defenses.
---
Anyway, there's one part of the Burrows that is closed off, but seems like it leads somewhere. On the northeast side of the Pier, there's a gated tunnel below the water with seemingly no way to enter. However, there is a pale blue light around the bend of the tunnel, and it does extend quite some distance before going out of sight. All of the other similar tunnels abruptly end, but this one is different. I can't see any way to get in, unfortunately.
---
The dungeon is fun. Even more fun if nuked and you run around for a while. Everything respawns more often than white spring. Especially if you have a friend leave and come back it’ll kick the respawns even faster
---
It fixed it ?
---
"Son are you a mirror?
---
"Or are you just that god damn good looking?"
---
I believe it may have been the end of a nuke I was in, was all robots, no ghouls, 12 or so legendary total, nothing I kept, but still!, decent.
---
according the fallout  discord it will be a full reroll for all 3 stats
---
Yes, I went from 300+ friends to around 75, totally fixed and running smooth as you could want, it's like having a new game
---
oh, i thought it was supposed to have no aim, as an old gatling would have very little of. good to know, would like a dot cause the gun feels good
---
Crafting, scrapping, trading, everything is so smooth now lol
---
I can, but I don't recommend any reaction sensitive games. There is a video processing / lag delay. Claiming login bonuses though... easy.
---
I feel your pain. The moment the update that changed the vendors caps pool to all be added in one giant pool I immediately went to west tek and grabbed all of the super mutants assault rifles so I could sell em.
---
After spamming a for 5 seconds my game decided to have a stroke freeze for a sec and then after it was done having its fit reset my highlighted option back to the top 0f the kits in which my tse gauss rifle was.
---
Never had the biggest heart attack in my life had to go and spend 2k to get back the item that I only for 105 caps...
---
Does it not work for energy weapons?
---
Time to spend 30 mins clearing the friends list and listening to Spotify
---
All ears, also thank you. Makes sense.
---
Try the Wendigo cave. Don't know if they are tameable but a few always spawn there.
---
STATION!
---
10/10 would bash yer head in, when you come home late and drunk.
---
OMEGALUL
---
Glad to hear it :)
---
A point emote would be good, level 5's keep walking past the extortionate amounts of .38 ammo I keep dropping for them in flatwoods, 
---
Pointing with a gun while flashing my pip boy light and tbagging at it usually works ok tho 🤣
---
I can imagine it now.
---
You walk up to west tek prepared to storm the castle.
---
The super mutants, and for once in their life...
---
They know what fear is...
---
You raise your mighty excalibur and scream at the top of your lungs(probably the Amazon warcry)
---
The super mutants hear your cries and it shakes them down to the bone.
---
As you're enjoying yourself on the bloodlust making the mutants scream for they're life a fresh faced vault dweller shows up and asks a simple question...(with the worlds shittiest mic)
---
"WhAtDuHfUcKArEuDoInG?"
---
No matter what comes out.
---
Loot is a binary string (1s and 0s) to a computer system, so in essence each item is it's own binary strand. Since the items are random the numbers generated in the pool are random which generates the item we grab. So since the coding generates a random number the term RNG was used to describe it. RNG systems are used in many other places as well.
---
I’m sorta surprised by my list, but honestly I’d go 
---
1) cap pool
---
2) stash increase
---
3) lying Lowe boss fight
---
Did you know when you die as a conduit, you can just not respawn until the timer forces you to and you will remain as the conduit for the whole time you are dead.
---
Happened to me once now i jump to my base first, drop junk and then head for the event. I die a lot as my .50cal expl works only well if me and our impostor friend talk face to face.
---
I just checked again, still not there.
---
Exited the game (X-box quit) restarted game, NOW it's there, so if you don't see it quit the game and restart.
---
Amen🙏
---
Mate it's fixed all sorts of shit, loading times, crafting,  scrapping, guna run a silo now and see if my lag issues at prime are fixed.
---
I'm with you. I like the interiors and change of setting but it's to easy. It was different in terms of location, I liked the fact it was quiet and no enemies in sight on entry but then it's a horde of ghouls, then a few more, another horde, then robots, then an Assaultron Dominator, who yeh in numbers can be a challenge but on its own, its the equivalent to someone in PA and let's face it, Power Armor is weak against most weapons with the Anti-armor prefix.
---
My issues aren't even with the events, it's that some bugs are taking too long to fix. Quests will be bugged and sometimes not show, mods STILL cannot be attached and we have to wait yet another week for it to get fixed,  the Gatling gun sights, just to name a few. I just don't like that these things aren't addressed in a timely manner. Especially that mod attachment issue.
---
Shocked I tell you! Shocked!
---
Xbox player?  ....yup
---
The area above ground if fantastic if you are looking for flux.
---
Good attempt brother, but I think you mean "have to go outside". Haha, what on earth is haft?
---
Those are not tameable. It must be a random spawn and on its own to be tamed.
---
Any updates available?
---
Thanks for this, I can stop going to Biv now
---
Thanks😀 what level are u?
---
biv tells you his best friend is one of the red bricks in the wall
---
Word in the wasteland is that you take your legendaries and trade them for tokens, then use those tokens to purchase other legendaries. I've heard this a few times from reliable sources.
---
I thought you could trade your weapons, pick prefixes from them and add them to your own weapon, for example from a BE, AAE and a vats weapon, you could trade and keep the Bloodied, Anti-armor and vats prefix and add them to a weapon of your choice etc.
---
I hear though you trade for tokens then purchase more sought after legendaries. The people who have told me this seem to be correct 90% of the time.
---
Although who really knows with Bethesda...
---
You can find the codes online, throwing a nuke takes less than half an hour if you do enough damage. Just returned at some point, you'll still have the card
---
Kill him. The Institute is behind this. You're being replaced.
---
If hope it’s like the diablo 3 blacksmith / mystic system... breaking for “forgotten souls” and using the mystic to alter a stat.
---
Except maybe you can reroll more than one trait.
---
Wait...is that a sy-
---
I've seen them around the map sometimes, you sure there's not already a schematic for them? I was looking forward to using them
---
My build is a heavy weapons build and I  have  bear arms perk maxed which reduces most heavy weapons to one or two pounds. Could imagine running heavy guns any other way.  I love my two shot gatling plasma, but I've invested a lot in heavy weapons perks.
---
perks are different, Blocker, fireproof, and bullet shield do work
---
In Fallout 4, the Wasteland is a lost cause, better to clean the slate, so to speak, and start over, well as much as you can when a location/region is going to be radioactive for a long time, so It would be better for the Institute or their equivalent to stay underground, until they can find a way to negate the radiation above ground, if that's even possible.
---
Or to quote Ultron, "I think a lot about meteors. The purity of them. Boom! The end. Start again. The world made clean for the new man to rebuild."
---
Hahahah that's so silly of course there is no "Institute" they got destroyed in the war right?
---
See, not everyone is at a high level with top tier equipment already. He said it was his first nuke, I remember my first run. It took what felt like forever.
---
Be careful about coming back atm. There are a couple glitched where power armour or random weapons will disappear from your inventory.
---
May want to wait til theres a fix for that. I lost my favorite weapon yesterday because of it :(
---
Scavenge gyms for weights. You'll find one at the Green Country Lodge, Charleston Fire Dept, two in the Morgantown University, Morgantown High School. There are others.
---
A little late reply but you can fast travel to Slocum's Joe jocation in the Forest area and in the east direction. There are plenty of them up the hill.
---
Hey thanks for that, I didnt want to reply immediately so I went to check Google, to find out more, so that I could come up with an interlectual reply but I just can't. That said, thank you, I think I understand, well a little but more than before.
---
What seems to trigger it? 
---
Or is it random?
---
That's a low act.
---
 I had some high level come in the silo at the end stage when I was in the launch room when I did my first nuke solo. I thought what's going on here - it was pretty chaotic with all the gunfire going on.
---
Luckily they me defend the launch dudes. Also helped cause I was not exactly sure of the procedure at the end bit.
---
I was in the silo for ages and they probably thought I needed some help.
---
I'd keep going for it.
---
Lord Fishsticks lol 😂😂😂😂😂 good one
---
Got two, four to go, at least now I know when the next one is going to appear in the store.  
---
Curious as to what the bonus will be.  
---
[Egg Timetable](https://photos.google.com/photo/AF1QipMytSpEZU4i2XZGVjE_L7a_umsAmVCSl0QzXuDI)
---
Good points well made :)
---
Much appreciated
---
did we all servive though? in there was a listing for vault 76 in one of the earlier games saying that the vault housed 500 people but there is only 20+ people running around in the world so where are the other 400+ people or maybe we didn't come out of vault 76 but another testing vault?
---
To my knowledge, no
---
Yup, totally 100%.
---
No need to look into this any further.
---
This. So much. Tesla coils are the best aoe damage. Use that and let the other people kill them. Turn on pacifist mode to prevent you from doing damage to other players and you can use them as conduits too!
---
Thanks! Building is about my favorite thing to do after you're done with quests. 
---
The bathroom wall gives a nice view while relaxing in the bath, though! ;)
---
I sorta have a joking thing about how the wall bits that aren't there are like automatic windows, otherwise it'd be way too windy. :p
---
I don't, but will check when I log in next and see what they say.
---
Some downvote for the hell of it, because gaming is representative of humanity, the best, the worst, the lame and the keyboard warriors, who just need a good slap, with a brick.
---
Does the gauss rifle count as energy? Cause as j started getting tank killer and noticed it took less round to put down a mutant when aiming for their head.  Unless it's the energy damage that doesnt get effected by tank killer.
---
That's right - I have done that a few times. Expensive lesson.
---
The item shows up basically immediately once you back out then hit trade again.
---
im playing everyday on xbox and that bug never occured to me. but to be honest if you didnt play till november the game has actually evolved quit a bit , new crafting table, new quest, new grinding area ( the burrow when nuke is AWESOME)
---
still got a couple of bug though but way better then at launch
---
That's really uncool and I am sorry you had such a n encounter.
---
It hast happened to me andy team, too. Seems certain people get something out of it ( whatever it may be). It ist rude to enter a Silo where somebody ist clearly at work.
---
One time my Buddy and me had a lvl 200ish and His lv l80ish Buddy Join while in the Launch room. So....we just sat  back and watched the show. Die to the respawn rate with all the people, they were Not able to complete 😈
---
We eventually got tired of it, laughed and let tgem Finish.
---
Lvl200ish seemed to have taken that personally and when I encountered him while fast travelling at vault 76, he got really pissed and tried to Shooting me.
---
Laughed so hard.
---
Don't spoil the Silo Runs, do them yourself, people  :)
---
Yes, this would be awesome. Have an upvote.
---
Ah yeah, shame. Sorry. Buy another PS4...?
---
Easy tip, learn to scrap and store your junk, regularly, and especially so when going into an event or hard fight. Hint scrap at a Station and drop it into the Stash. Can't drop and lose anything if you don't carry anything, no paper bag no worries.
---
There is no bonus damage in pvp with sneak jazzy in case your didn't know.
---
Hahaha this is hilarious
---
Really? No 2.5x? Damn.. didn’t know that.
---
Im only lvl 30, but still have a decent amount of budget. Also btw if you store something that’s wired to something else the wires count towards your budget until you move your camp.
---
I sometimes have to stab an enemy once or twice before they decide that it hurts.
---
Heavy barrel for .50 cal. none for LMG
---
yes its real and model and quest for this monster already in game
---
but turned off
---
so we don’t actually need to physically have all the codes, as long as someone else decodes it?
---
Really? How do you know?
---
Kinky. Good thing even with 15 strength I still can't afford to run it 98% of the time
---
there are some new quests/areas, game seems to run better on my 970 (my imagination perhaps), and QoL improvements. Some more bugs are fixed, but gotten a new one there you cant install/modify your power armor. Haven't been noticing any items dissapearing as some say. Item renaming is a big welcome change, but to inspect to repair/rename is a weird choice imo. Also its 800 stash now
---
I've noticed you do get 3 star weapon from that event but they are bottom shelf ones.
---
Like knuckles and boxing gloves etc. Oh well -people wanted 3 star and Bethseda gives it to them.
---
For a weapon storage? Not normal storage?
---
It's in the game files
---
I was too late. Too late...
---
Yes! We have the best armor, the best power armor, the best quest-giver (MODUS is awesome, albeit slightly creepy sometimes, but that simply makes him more awesome), and the best uniform, and I'd love to see more Enclave stuff, especially uniforms, CAMP items, maybe a unique weapon? (I suppose one could argue that the Handmade is the Free States one, given that their weaponsmiths made them, lasers could be considered Brotherhood, and Plasma would be Enclave, but I'm talking about new weapons altogether. I'm sure MODUS has had to do SOMETHING to keep himself busy/not insane during the period between the bunker conflict and Vault 76 opening).
---
Ok thanks, do u know if I have to move the camp to get the budget increase because I'm camping at the same spot since level 25 and now I'm level 100
---
Don't die, don't leave valuable junk in your pockets.
---
Me too I still only got initiate. Thats really bad as I have 500+ hrs and hundreds of TDs dropped. 
---
I still cant understand which is the best way to drop them. collect n TDs and drop them all at once, or collect one, drop, fast travel back to the spawn location,collect another one, drop, etc.
---
SOmetimes in WS bunker  military wing I found 4-5, used to collect them all and drop them. Now It's 3 days im collecting and dropping one by one. Honestly I dont see much difference between the two methods, as I got another bomber yesterday dropping only 1 TD.
---
Im so confused. I'm so sad.
---
Ive been camping at one place since lvl 5 and the budget has still increased for me, but maybe it’s being offset by having too much stored stuff for you?
---
Best thing in the game is the radio. I love the music on it
---
Look up the codes on nukacrypt.  They are the same for every one each week. You don’t need the code pieces in your inventory.
---
I'm crashing to desktop about every 20 minutes on 2 different machines, myself. It's less stable than the stress test for me.
---
All the way this! Pipes need more love!
---
MODUS:
---
"General? You're quite...mistaken, on that front. They are still very much...intact, and conducting some most....interesting.....research. At least, that is what I assume. The Kovac detected very odd energy readings coming from underneath the Commonwealth Institute of Technology. Would you interested in trip up the coast General?"
---
It could use some brightening up too, it's hard to read on metal walls
---
It's someone's job at Bethesda to come up with assholes challenges to make sure we really got to work for a tiny amount of premium currency. It's vaguely amusing when you think about it.
---
I only grab bags after the event when its clear no one is coming for them.
---
I'm up for it too 👍
---
Still happening
---
I hear you. There’s a strong base game (minus the bugs), but as far as whatever they brand as new content... well I would severally temper my expectations. And that’s including the upcoming legendary and player vending.
---
My god someone with a brain on Reddit color my nuts stupefied
---
is that a miremothman?
---
OK thank you guys, yall kept my hopes up much love to the Fo76 community
---
I hope they just leave it. Yes, it was unintended.. but is it fun? You betcha! Are we playing to have fun? We are! Hurrah!
---
That's Bethesda for you. They can't release a game without glaring bugs, that usually the modders end up fixing.
---
As much as I enjoyed older Bethesda games, FO76 was the wake up call that they are just trying to grab as much cash as they can and don't care about releasing a finished product if they can slap a cosmetic store on there.
---
Legendary effect is compatible with grenadier. You especially see how effective it is when you’re going through a nuke silo and you’re in the room destroying mainframe cores.
---
No problem. I've had many years of schooling in such things so that is why I know about it.
---
your probably not the only one, but for me, i never liked the song, having it on the radio here makes me turn it off
---
You pee acid and shit quills!
---
Tesla coils, Tesla gun or pain train are all great for tagging. I use pain train because it knocks most enemies over and let's everyone tag it without it smacking the life out of me
---
Oxhorn's interesting replay:  
---
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qg4npBloVZw](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qg4npBloVZw)
---
I actually am really new to this game—a friend gifted it to me for an early birthday present, and coming from the online mode in Red Dead and The Elder Scrolls, it surprises me how friendly this community is. I had heard a lot of bad things about the game and so when I started playing I was surprised at how every now and then, I’ll get a message from another player about trading goods for free or simply telling me to help myself to whatever water they have. When I got out of the vault, I actually stumbled on a player settlement literally feet from the vault and the guy who owns it goes, hey, I see you’re a new player, feel free to take food and water, let me know if you need a weapon and good luck!
---
So from a very low level, thank you. It means a lot to this person here.
---
The power attack/ normal attack thing is irrelevant. What they're getting at is that she takes -no- damage when cloaked. So any kind of attack at that point is pretty stupid.
---
I dont know for sure, but when you craft a gauss rifle it is listed under Enegry weapons.
---
Those things kill me in about 20 seconds. I avoid if I can.
---
listen for the radio
---
A lazy and ultimately pointless addition, those protections.
---
I’ve never finished an event because the server crashed every time
---
Sorting by weight is currently pretty useless. A single Super Stimpak will be listed first, while 50 Rad-X will be somewhere at the bottom - even though they are heavier. Thus, it is somewhat difficult to get a clear picture of what is actually taking up the most space.
---
The Pip-Boy should show both the combined weight aswell as the weight of a single unit and use the combined weight for sorting purposes.
---
Sorting by value has the same problem: it uses the value of the individual item instead of the entire stack.
---
Implementing this change would take mere 10 minutes, but would be huge QoL improvement.
---
Does Rad resist in non PA/non Hazmat works different? Cuz 1000 Rad Resist would be around double what i have in PA and match Hazmat and in neither i would say im pissed about how low it is.
---
First of all, awesome map! I've been trying to login with my account for weeks, though, and it doesn't seem to work. Password reset doesn't send me any mail (checked spam, nothing there). Also tried the app, same issue. Would love to unlock the premium features but the app / map doesn't let me and I can't find a contact form on the website. 😢
---
damn thalmor
---
You clearly see a picture thats inside of f76 where a sheepsquatch is standing right in the middle of it. They are opening up more quests until the event for the squatch is open \^\^
---
Damn elves
---
All Armours can be "Deep Pocketed"
---
However the change to learn from scrapping is VERY low, so if you've learn all/ most of the mods for that armour, it would be better to go looking for the plans.
---
FYI I can Deep Pocket Leather Limbs, Metal Torso and Marine Limbs, was there something specific you were looking for? (I might have Marine Limb plans... Might)
---
Scorch beasts is completely unrelated
---
Deep pocketed is only learned from plans. 2 plans per armor type torso and limbs
---
The sheepsquatch isn't in the game yet but feel free to try again...
---
Good fucking god, really? Is that what they want us to do with the camera? God what is wrong with the people running this game. Christ I wish there was real content.
---
Look at the damage it does when you look at the damage number.
---
If it's a lightning bolt, then it is Energy. If it is a crosshair, then it is Ballistic. If it's a Rad sign then...well...Radiation. If it's a droplet, then it is poison.
---
Damn grey skins
---
Tamed ones don’t attack players unless you attack the C.A.M.P.
---
I know but gauss rifles are considered energy weapons.  What I'm trying to do to see if it only applies to things that does ballistic damage. I currently dont have an energy weapon to test this on but I think tank killer is just meant for ballistic and if so that really sucks since it is an actually good card
---
I got Paladin two days ago, so only Elder left. You must remember to learn those plans - you won't get higher rank if you didn't learned the previous (i.e. sold it to someone). There are 7 ranks: Innitiate, Knight, Knight CPT, Knight SGT, Knight Officer, Paladin and Elder.
---
While that was clearly a set up and just a new variation of teams exploiting such cheap tricks like the workshops, I certainly have to admit I enjoy the good ole mercy kill when someone’s accidentally breathed near the mined car at Poseidon or a piece of owned wood and gotten the unwanted wanted tag.  
---
Everyone’s got a bit of raider in them. It is set after the apocalypse...what fun would it be if every encounter is safe always.  We are fulfilling our VaultTech mandate of rebuilding aren’t we?...oh that’s right nothing we do changes anything...  At the very least if players across most servers are camping in the same areas or walking the same mountain shortcuts there should start to grow trails and trailer parks in those parts...SOME ANY sign of impact.
---
They totally screwed up my game play I really dislike this game because of the watoga patch that they didn't mention. Stop messing with legendaries Bethesda.
---
It’s actually infinite exp, because you get back from scrapping the same as you used. Very crappy, tedious infinite exp. But at least you can learn all the mod plans.
---
My first nuke, I soloed Silo B. I got to the final room where you have to defend the chiefs, and I was getting my ass handed to me over and over. I was about to give up, but I respawned at my camp next to Silo B and decided to give it one more go. Some dude twice my level appears, and we run through the silo back into the launch room, and he lays waste to everything in sight. 
---
"if you punch in the code wrong don't worry man, you can have my backup launch card."
---
:o
---
I figured it all out, and we nuked Whitespring. I fast-travelled to the watchtower nextdoor just in time to watch it burn. 
---
Then my kid woke up and I had to log off for the night. Either way, fun was had.
---
I agree.
---
do the mayor for a day quest. if your not to low a level you get "allrise",if you low level then you'll get the low level allrise which is not upgradable.
---
better to earn it,than buy it , in my book.
---
If i remember correctly, it is ballistic. 
---
Tank Killer is a good card no matter what, it just kinda blows that a niche weapon type is made even more so because it can't gain benefits from perks like this. Thank God it is affected by Gunsmith and Rifleman.
---
You don't even need a single code piece just google the launch code.
---
He grew up and changed his opinion on homosexuality. How about you? Have you grown up?
---
&gt; Today, the outrage on the sub is the dungeon is too easy. Last week: the sheepsquatch is too hard. The week before: not enough hard end game content, not enough ways to farm legendaries. 
---
Wow wanting the game to be properly balanced is a problem now? I love visiting this sub every once in awhile to see this dumb shit that gets people upvoted and gilded .
---
Not exactly - you can equip all PA pieces except helm. Instead of helm you equip sunglasses, take radshield and you're good;)
---
sorry but no, i like having to fight off parasites while looking for disease cures or the more elusive antibiotics.
---
Good luck getting elder
---
okey thanks, with all the other mods for guns it seems odd there are none for the heavys yet
---
I know when i was server hopping at the crashed vertibird above abby's bunker for a snallyghaster pet i ran into around 10 kings by the time i found 1 snallyghaster. Found 1 around every 10 minutes of hopping.
---
Key to the Past is bugged. Happened to ne too. But the Scorchbeasts was just bad luck.
---
Pumpkin grenade.
---
Xbox here....auto-freeze for me.  I laughed when i read this since walking and opening my pip-boy at the same time is instant permanent screen freeze while the audio still plays.  Have to shut down the game manually and restart...every time. At least it doesn't rollback and have items disappearing though. Level 93
---
The institute is just a myth that some tinfoil-hatted bean-eaters thought up. Don't worry about that.
---
I was parked outside the crafting room at Whitespring, and thought "oh hey, I'm safe here. I'll go take a leak."
---
I had my wireless headphones on, and I laid my controller down on the arm of my chair. As I'm leaving my livingroom, I hear my controller bounce off the chair and hit the floor. 
---
Then I hear a grenade primed in my headset. Oh well, probably no big.. Wait, I have nuka grenades selected. 
---
It managed to sail down the hallway far enough to avoid killing me, but it did in fact hit a couple bots. Predictable outcome.
---
It drops, but it’s easier to mod a piece for the color (I assume you like the color? Polished is better def). But learning the plans from scrapping took me forever, much longer than most armor mods.
---
I've traded 2 days ago with a nice guy and got my hands on a 3\* Bloodied Explosive + 50dr aiming Pipe Rifle (not a Pipe bolt -action)
---
I've already a collection of 20+ 2\*-3\* legendary pipe weapon few with explosive.
---
So if you've question go ahead.
---
I've converted the BE Pipe to a Rifle. Used sting magazine and have tank destroyer so it should be've 76% anti armor.
---
I had about 30-40% live and the weapon damage was indicated as 122!
---
With the hardened mod so .38
---
Demolishen expert +60%; 45% from rifle man; 15% from bloody mess;
---
And 2,5 stealth damage 3,75 at night but didn't test it.
---
I can almost one shot 62 level ghouls 42 are one shots, with 2,5 stealth.
---
With 3,75 I should be able to one shot every ghoul out there.
---
I'd just like a robot companion that be retrofitted to be a pack mule.
---
It's equally rare as previous ones, so probably a week and I'll get it.
---
Accelerate it's firing rate too, cool weapon just doesn't put out enough.
---
Assaultron..? It uses the deathclaw skeleton.
---
Man sometimes i got to aim way down and left because my shits go to the top right corner of my screen
---
Disabling voice chat in the audio settings will prevent you from hearing others (aswell as being heard).
---
Switching to Push-To-Talk might be your best option.
---
I feel like there’s a lot pf gated off areas. In the room with the PA chassis there are tunnels submerged that go deep down, only to be blocked by a gate.
---
Also something new in mosstown? I remember reading the notes and meant to check the town, but just seeing a scorchbeast made turn right back XD Did not feel like fightinh a scorchbeast
---
I’ve had this
---
Got some rare things on sale, Stranger!
---
DarkRepulserXB1 feel free to add me, I’m occasionally online
---
well some people were speculating it's a mod for Fallout 4 so I was unsure until someone gave me pointers...
---
Worth a good chunk of caps.
---
Yeah man thats it. Time is helpful haha
---
Lol.  Just by Bunker gate a white spring robot spawned in right between my bullet and the horde of ghouls that camp out there who I’d been drawing out. Once the ghouls were done I kept for a good minute looking around for another because all these laser flashes were popping off and the robot not only had not shown in vats, the ghoul he popped up in front of was high percentage as if unblocked so the guards had to be helping me right?  Well jumped down behind rock. The flashes stopped. Scope and VATS showed them green. Walked up and two assaultrons one sentry and a couple protectrons just poured it into me. Barely got my rear up into the hills. They’ve really got to fix this Whitesprings hostility setting.
---
I put it in the last edit of the post ;).
---
Floor decor&gt;same line as the deathclaw statue :)
---
I hope so, as I just found out about this a few hours ago
---
i dont care what it costs me, i will always destroy your camp if it's placed there
---
Legendary monster spawn went up like x10 Kiaoken had some legendary hounds lengendary potectrons with tracks (not feet) and even getting legendarys from normal mobs. So havent needed a nuke yet really.
---
Sorry for you loss - I got nice base that I've build for 3 hours and would be very upset if someone destroy it. I wonder why we usually hear that information from console players? I play on PC and only once met a moron who destroyed my decontamination shower, but I quit server as fast as I could when he started. Why you didn't do that? Same when occasionally scorchbeasts starting to aggro my turrets - I quit as fast as possible.
---
Hey mate I'm up for this I'll send you an add but I won't be on till later UK time.
---
Ok cool I’ll be on for another 3 hours or so
---
Pretty sure itll be more easter related hehe
---
Sounds like a personal problem . I never freeze anymore
---
Honestly it makes the most sense because it’s the simplest. A handful of tokens per legendary. Hundreds of tokens for whatever kind of list they put together. 
---
It’s going to be like Camden park and mr Fuzzy tokens. Only the list will be updated ever mon- no ever two months.
---
At work right now but I’ll add you. Level 53 and still need to launch my first nuke, hah, could use some help.
---
Damn thats shit
---
First egg was up for over 30 hours. Sorry you missed it :(
---
Sheepsquatch's quest.
---
I know someone who missed "contextual reading" classes.
---
Someone's been watching too much Wallace &amp; Gromit: The Curse of the Were-Rabbit
---
Hey - that's super weird! I suspect there might have been a typo in the original email address you signed up with.  
---
Can you PM me the email you signed up with and the username you chose?  I should be able to dig up your account and sort it out for you!
---
They should have a server dedicated to us who love building and we can all make massive insane architecture builds
---
Plans are quite difficult to obtain, especially for CA. If your're on PC I can sell you some:
---
\- Deep Pocketed Marine Armor Limbs - 1000 caps
---
\- Deep Pocketed Robot Armor Chest - 300 caps
---
\- Deep Pocketed Robot Armor Limbs - 300 caps
---
and I can do Deep Pocketed for other armor types (Combat Armor, Marine, raider, leather, robot, etc.) for a small fee.
---
Yeah all good  happy to help whenever I can :)
---
Maybe you just have overly high expectations . When has anything in a Beth game ever been hard/challenging?
---
Yeah I remember data miners a while back finding an unmarked perk attached to hazmat suits, basically giving them and PA an invisible buff in nuke zones.
---
Survival of the fitness!
---
At first sight of this I was like...ok maybe following someone around and taking photos...but then uhhh no. Why? There are no citizens to consume the news. So it’d be just for your scrap book....but then I thought ‘still a press vest ...and following around someone in power armor while in that vest dodging incoming enemies just “to get that perfect shot” might have some potential. If and only if Bethesda knew how to make it matter on the server. Then such a thing could be a repeatable quest to be a server radioman for an hour or some such. Where you upload or connect to one of the radio towers AFTER you’ve completed the boosting of them quests which at least even though each of our boosting the signals disappeared we can role play it stayed boosted..and “broadcast to everyone’s pip boy who is on the server”. 
---
But, it’d have to be scripted content since I’m sure an open mike broadcast to everyone in the sever would be funny but violate every FCC law there is and ever will be. 
---
Maybe you have to choose the top 20 photos and they get pushed to all pip boys with a scripted voice broadcast overlay and introduction. 
---
It would make it seem more alive of a world.
---
No it isn't. It falls into same category as killing legendary monsters before everyone gets to tag it. First comes, first serves- this is only way to make sure, everyone is playing with equal rules.
---
this is one complaint i can support.
---
I miss those crows in fallout 4, watching your every move.
---
Well they say collect one a day for six days, so by that, I don't think so. But maybe cause so many people werent aware they might. But I wouldn't hold my breath :(
---
Thanks, I’ll give it a go there.
---
F.Y.I Snallygasters spawn fairly frequently at the spot to the right of Cranberry Glade, if you ever need another.
---
If sh#t smells less, sh#t, doesn't mean it aint sh#t. Burrows is still bad dungeon experience. Even on nuked, its nothing more than WS on steroids.
---
Damn that bit sucks! Enjoy your holiday though :D
---
Well you still need them to mod and craft. There’s better combat perks if you’re well stocked on junk.
---
hahah since the last patch the game is a stable as [Uuq](https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/fallout/images/d/d6/FO4FH_Visions_in_the_Fog5.png/revision/latest?cb=20160703181255)!
---
After enough gameplay the enemies just start instant healing. It happens more often when you are firing too quickly and the enemies are taking too much damage too fast. Their health goes down and just spikes back up.
---
Thanks for letting me know. I actually had someone chuck a few Mirv nades into my base while i was away doing some events and it killed my buddy. I'll give it a check.
---
Well assuming it's a cosmetic prize and they said collect all 6, I think not. But only Bethesda knows. We'll see I guess :)
---
I expect that legendary tokens can be used to buy pre-made named legendaries (like the survival legendaries).
---
I don't think they want risk giving everyone god-tier weapons.
---
well it makes non duped items disappear also apperently.
---
the power armour that disappeared was crafted 24 hours beforehand.
---
it also made a piece of t51b armour disappear i collected from a world spawn 2 days ago (it was crappy generic stuff you pick up so i didnt care). so unless the world spawn armour is "duped" then bethesda has some weird spaghetti code going on atm xD
---
I've mentioned this to a bunch of people, to close the app. However for a few that sadly still isn't bringing it up!
---
Cheers man. Will do. PirateNation52
---
I wanted to deep pocket some unyielding armor ( and other types also I suppose ).
---
Cheers.
---
An offline mode where you invite your friends would be nice...
---
Youre trying so hard to roast me but you just dont have the range lmao.
---
That wasnt the sheepsquatch quest, this was the IMPOSTER sheepsquatch quest, two very different things. Maybe call it what it is and don't be so lazy? Or maybe spelling the word "imposter" is hard 4 u???
---
But anyways, why would I be running around grabbing junk DURING the event, if I'm just going to die when grabbing all the pylons? Of course I mean AFTER the event, Mr. Contextual Reading! Just stop, when you die irresponsibly, you drop a bag with your loot in it as an incentive to be more careful, it is absolutely intended. Get over it and play smarter instead of trying to poke holes in my logic.
---
Sorry to hear that, but remember not all high levels are jerks.
---
As a "high" level player (only 135) my fun is going along with lower level players and remove heavy resistance or protect them when they need cover.
---
It gives a greater satisfaction for me to see the player a accompanied succeed in the launch.
---
XB1, Level 93- was there last night when someone nuked Harper's Ferry. I still have not activated the Burrows yet but I was literally the only player there the entire time. Some maxed scorched, zero glowing ones, 3 diseased feral ghouls,  glowing ants and a S-TON of diseased sting-wing chasers, 6 of which were the only legendary enemies I faced. Got only some common duplicate plans and 2 Junkie legendary weapons unfortunately.  It was fun being the only person there anyway because you are correct...the violet flux totals with my green thumb perk card activated was INSANE.  The hardened mass drops were crazy too with every kill the LEAST I came up with was 2 and the most I saw was 5 for a single kill of a non-legendary.  Looking forward to going underground once I get my damn carry weight under control.  Can't figure out why my carry weight is so damn high when i have every perk possible except the maxed batteries included perk.
---
Well not that shocked
---
A line of power armored wastelanders queuing up and slowly shuffling lol
---
I guess it's not top priority, which is ridiculous. I can't even play the game. It happens every time I play.
---
THX for the quick reply, I'll send you a PM! 👍
---
wtf are you talking about. Everyday front page topics are either suggestion how someone wants something very little, like keychain, fridge, renaming etc. Among them are topics-"Hey, look my camp","Did this, how cool","met this","To the guys who I met" and rarely you find topic about complaints. Today first complain is 8th- "Daily Challenge: "Take picture of player wearing sunglasses in nuked region." Am i joke to you?". Basically its 1 to 10 ratio, when it comes to complains. For every 10 none complain topic there is only 1 topic that is actually complaint.
---
My poor poor camp
---
Y a fatman?????? Lose it bro..biggest /heaviest waste of space!!!
---
" Yes! We have the best armor" - can you elaborate this a little? You talking about forest/urban combat armors? Even if it has higher resistances (don't know, just guessing) it can't drop as legendary (apart from chest as guaranteed reward for questline), so it's only useful for medium-level game.
---
That is cheating breaking the games immersion. Why not just blackmail a GM for infinite HP. The devs do not respect the challenge of their own game.
---
We need a way to contact players in silo's to ask if they need help. Players like us that want to help can then go in to assist them.
---
A really big jar that can fit two live ones and a succulent, a standing one and a hanging one, I'd pay atoms for that.
---
I’m going to try this out; thanks for the tip!
---
Just identify as a ghoul and you wont be hurt by rads, is that too hard to do?
---
I definitely don’t understand the frigging tedious direction we’re headed with more cameras and the boring crap their tacking on in dribs and drabs.
---
Yellowcake flux is best at Whitesprings and voilet looks to be Harpers Ferry.
---
This worked for me, ty.
---
I don't love that it is missing bulbs. Usually the atom shop stuff is 'clean'.
---
Hey, I went to submit a ticket with Bethesda and it said they are aware of the issue. If you go look it up on their Bethesda support you can click to be alerted when they’ve addressed it. (Hope this helps)
---
https://help.bethesda.net/app/answers/detail/a_id/45563/~/wasted-on-nukashine-quest---fallout-76
---
I think it's real and thought that maybe after recalling the imposter.. Using the robot hack/pacify perk you can somehow deactivate it, and utilize it to summon the real one somehow with the mating subroutine on the computer while it's pacified
---
THESE instances are why I want that middle finger.
---
Its like raaaa-aaaads, on your nuking day!
---
https://giphy.com/gifs/editingandlayout-NEvPzZ8bd1V4Y
---
Yeah or even just a team up or help subreddit for 76z
---
honestly, i nuked Harpers Ferry today and I still think Whitesprings is better
---
Seriously? That sucks. That just opens a can of worms. Makes you wonder which perks aren’t working for other weapons...
---
I had it on PC after the last patch - I could only shoot.  I basically blew away my My Games\Fallout76 folder and let it recreated.  Then added my mods one by one.  Turns out, it wasn't a specific mod, but I guess they changed the Fallout76Custom.ini enough that recreating it from scratch sorted things right up.
---
How do you get more radshield? Do you have to wait for someone else to trigger the event or can you still get the ingredients for the megafertilizer without it?
---
At least I 3 shot the wendigo with a bloodied black powder rifle
---
My only gripe is the weapon balance. 1 shotting is still unfun at all levels. Other than that, It was fun leveling up my new guy on that mode by at least 30 levels. And the good fights I did have that lasted more than 2 seconds were great. Once they finally add some kind of faction system or PvP based events I could see myself spending way more time with survival besides just getting the weekly legendary. I only didn't get the 1st legendary because I didn't want to lose all my aid and caps with my older 2 guys and my new guy was too low of a level to find any legendaries.
---
What?!? I don’t use power armor here near as much as F04 so I hadn’t noticed yet, but seriously? Why even include them? For the cosmetic effect!? 🤦🏻‍♂️
---
Those Enclave mission drops have been terrible for me lately.  Ran through 2 last night and received 5 purified waters, food, some ammo and a single weapon, a plasma gun.
---
Damn N’wah
---
You'll learn the plan during quest Organic Solution and then just have to farm for that rare glowing flowers (Strangled Bloom) - it doesn't require any other rare ingredients.
---
I would rather have spam complaint posts over ignoring the issues with this game and trying to be nice all the time, because at least then we have a higher chance to get actual change.
---
I clicked on the first egg and it said i got it but I couldn't build it and now I am locked out. Yay bugs?
---
It works great for semi autos with scopes in close quarters. Also, recon scopes still tag, but your not staring at the targets nose hairs
---
then you have the wrong filter active, you can change it from value to wieght and it will show correctly.
---
Don’t hold your breath! Mother’s Day is coming up! All resources diverted to crappy Mother’s Day Atom Shop garbage, and they’re still working on giving us a camera when we can already take pictures!
---
Missed the first one. Guess I’ll die. *shrug*
---
What are you doing here? you're damning peoples races eh?
---
WELL! There's no time for that! I got word of a CAMP that needs your help!
---
here i'll take you to the general area.
---
Where is that exactly? I’ve been meaning to check that out.
---
Outlander,  how can I help?
---
*No. You will live, John Constantine. You will live.*
---
:(
---
If nobody else is in your cell, it will absolutely disappear.
---
... It doesn't ping for me unless it is lootable.
---
I loot. It stops pinging.
---
Are you on XB1?  If you are up for it, I'll come with you this evening.  Nobody is going to get to that terminal before you do.  I'll make sure.  :)
---
Huge letdown on how RR scales on 76. I can see no reason to stack consumables if they do little difference. "bUt nUcLeAr ZoNeS sHoUlD wOrK lIkE tHaT" According to who? Compared to what, real life?
---
Read it again...
---
My first build was melee. Hell, get an X-01 and all rise and you're ready to go!
---
It's easy already at that point. I do go even faster now. I think it's close to 15 minutes, I do play with my girlfriend though.
---
It would be nice if this app also displayed the daily and weekly challenges. That would encourage people to log in &amp; play.
---
Yep, a bit of a pity though, I would like it if it was that hard, but then it should also be more rewarding, nuke zones are only good for do and trash legendaries, I never found anything useful there yet.
---
I thought that wasn't true
---
you either have a bug or something is wrong in your build, or just shooting the hole hour becuase i have never had a weapon break in an hour.
---
Well this looks to me like it might just be real. 
---
Is one hell of a good job if it is fake.
---
im a melle build and I use a grog as well, and by no means I have to fix it every hour. it sucks the took the 200% from it, dont even understand why they did it.
---
&gt; the invisible sheepsquatch.
---
Sounds like someone hasn't realized the importance of going into that fight with a power armor helmet modded with the targeting HUD. There's no such thing as "invisible" with that thing on!
---
Hmm, what's weird for me, is that everything I've *heard* is that when you pick plans up in a specific location, that you will not see plans there again for roughly 22 hours, call it a day. What I've *observed*, specifically at the crashed train near Watoga, and now the Prison armor bench, is that it's significantly longer before those plans begin spawning again. 
---
As of 2019/04/16 the plans in the prison still haven't begun spawning again for me, and I gave up on the Watoga crashed train plans because it was over 5 days since those last spawned for me when I picked them up for the BoS Officer Underarmor. I've since started farming the plans in the locker next to the armor bench at Grafton Steel. For reference, it's the far right building from the fast travel location. I've seen both the Pocketed Combat Armor mod and BoS Combat Armor Legs mod (which I already got from the prison) spawn at this location, so the arms should spawn here as well, I just haven't seen them yet. I haven't picked up any of the plans from this location yet because I have no idea how long it'll actually take for plans to start spawning again after I do. It's definitely taking longer than 24 hours in other locations so I am just not risking it. 
---
Just sharing my observations. Hope it helps.
---
Which vendor?  As of a couple of patches ago, the vendors were marked as "ghosts", which means hits of any kind to them do absolutely nothing.
---
An assaultron that has double stealth sword, Gorgon Laser, And lastly warmongerer plates
---
Now we got a deal
---
It was the Brotherhood vendor
---
Bruh that’s probably part of the problem. I bought what must have been a duped weapon a player sold in a shop. With it in my inventory, I suddenly got the Overweight/destroy items to continue picking up gear warning. 
---
So I tried dropping it. No bag, it just disappeared. 
---
Not saying you dropped it but maybe if it was a duped them some variable finally forced its removal.
---
rename items
---
vendos in WS
---
camp budget
---
It's not robot armor. It exactly resembles a unique armor set obtained as a quest reward in fallout 4's farharbor dlc.
---
Im pretty sure its true
---
2 shot with an ordinary level 20 Super Sledge. Don't even have Master Slugger yet. Just PA with strength 15.
---
I rarely have the radio on.
---
I'll try to collect the others if I can anyway. It can't hurt.
---
Just put ur stuff back first but yeah that is a dick move
---
Ah, should have said legendaries notwithstanding. I think the Scout (Urban/Forest) have the highest base resistances in the game, though I could be wrong.
---
Lol, yeah. Unyielding will be the legendary prefix.
---
Come back anytime!
---
If u think about it, you wanna build bigger as you get more plans, so why shouldn’t you get a bigger build limit as you level up
---
Had the opposite, I’m level 29 and had a party of 3 come stomping through with TSE’s and the lowest was 128. Easy pickings for him, but don’t understand why they don’t go to Survival to make it worth their while.
---
Also not entirely sure pacifist does anything apart from prevent my from fighting back.
---
Old bugs from Beta. Bethesda summer employees failing again to use version control.
---
My first nuke launch experience lasted damn near 3 hours. My friends and I had NO IDEA what we were gonna face inside. We all died at least 5 times apiece, if not more. We burned through all our ammo, water, food, you name it we lost it. Those who died had to make more ammo and supplies just to come back, and back then if you died in the silo you lost your Biometric ID card that got you through the laser grid and had to redo that, and those robots in the beginning are relentless. At one point 2 of my friends were so low on ammo and other items they weren't able to make it back. It came down to me and another friend. We could only work with one chief. I remained up om the high rise with the chief up there while he ran arpund below distracting the robots from him. Every now and then I had to fight some bots off the chief, who was taking forever to do his thing all by itself from well below half the bar. It was the stuff of nightmares. Nearly 3 hours later, imagine our relief when the chief finally finished and all the remaining bots just killed over. Thankfully we had the rifht code I'd founs online cause we only had the lne keycard. I woukd not have done it again, LoL.
---
Now it takes us anywhere from 10-20 minutes together to launch a nuke and aside from one of us, we can solo them them in about 20-25 minutes or less. I'm the second weakest of my group, so it takes me a tad bit longer, but I can still solo it nonetheless with my trusty Bloodied 2* Gatling.
---
Anywho, sorry you had to experience that wirh the high level. Usually when a high level comes in with me I just leave. Though there was one time a low level came in and started running behind me. Everything started coming back at higher levels cause now there were two of us instead of just one. Before he came in I was only hitting max level 55's, but afterwards they were coming back at 60's and above and in greater numbers. Pissed me off so I left his ass in there alone. Needless to say, he didn't launch a nuke.
---
Right! Except if you're in Hazmat/Power Armor. Then again a level A Hazmat suit on real life wouldn't do shit on a highly irradiated zone. Then again we are making real life comparisons right!
---
This is actually quite similar to what I initially thought the game would be like...
---
That 76 would have different stages of rebuilding, requiring the *combined long-term effort of players* (e.g. by killing large amounts of enemies, donating building materials, continuously defending an area for an entire week, repairing and recruiting construction bots, participating in huge events, claiming workshops, etc). 
---
Basically, these would be like server-wide Challenges, shared between players. 
---
And once one of these requirements has been met, *the map would permanently change* and advance to the next stage.
---
So that, after a year or so, the new map would be quite different from what it has been at launch.
---
There could have also been a mobile companion app that lets you check the progress and even actively participate.
---
The changes could have included: repairing railroads, removing debris, rebuilding towns, replanting forests, getting the mines up and running, removing toxic waste, building big farms and a stable water supply, establishing trade routes, ... 
---
No game that I know of has ever attempted to provide a dynamic and changing world like that...
---
A hello there to be sure, but a general Kenobi one.
---
I agree, but I feel like compensation is only handed out in p2w games, and this game isn’t quite there yet.
---
Sure, doesn't sound ominous at all.  Mind putting a way point on my pipboy?
---
I had one of those people 3 days or so ago.  I was at the Whitesprings Station vendor at the time.  I took a video of me throwing up on him, which subsequently made him leave:
---
https://youtu.be/zhPiYrdgIOU
---
Idk. I just heard it wasn't true like 4 months ago.  Could be wrong.
---
nah     listen FOR the radio. thats how I found it.there is an active radio that can be heard from the road.follow the sound.
---
the radios throught the wasteland point you to something of interest.
---
thanks i need yellowcake for my 308. LMG
---
It weighs 2 pounds and does 400 damage. Really good for clearing out mobs.
---
It is great running round bashing the hell out of things in power Armour and it’s even better with marsupial I get to jump on building what’s not to love 😂
---
Easter costume? Bunny ears would be cool
---
Accidentally dropped my troubleshooter ES in the last event... And then died..
---
It was still there!
---
For some things you still need to find plans in-game to unlock them. I couldn't build my red stove until I first found the plans to make the regular one.
---
and who would’ve thought, it splattered?!
---
Regular muties... carrying high radiation fluids, hardened mass, etc.  This is expected, as super mutants don't change in a nuke zone - just ghouls and flora.
---
I once had a fight with a mega sloth, deathclaw and mythic flatwoods monster. I drank nukashine and appeared at the top of the world, half a mile from my base. Coincidence, I think not
---
Assholes challenge sounds like a NSFW sub
---
Maybe it is a sheep- hedgehog cross
---
The only issue is if you live far from the spot, then the Snallygaster might not make it to your home, since they are quite frail.  I tamed one of the ones I ran into while hunting for my first King just to get rid of the Megasloth that was taking up a ton of space in my house, and the poor thing never showed up.
---
SERVE AND PROTECT
---
they work now. I  survived a nuke on top of it.
---
We know it will be useless garbage. Bethesda never fails to deliver garbage.
---
Not that I think this will ever get added but if it did I can just imagine the top 25 posts from that day "wait you can get hurt while looking at your pip boy", "dear Bethesda, you NEED to nerf the tripping rate", "running into objects while looking at your pip boy causes way to much damage than getting shot by *bullet type*, Bethesda this is not ok", etc.
---
Us
---
It would be even cooler to have it in game too
---
Just send them a group invite or message them if they’re on console (I don’t know if you can message them on the Bethesda launcher)
---
Someone stole a lot of junk from me the other day, so I followed him back to his camp and took 100 steel from his extractor.
---
Yeah, encountered that a couple times getting my snallygaster. Took around 2 hours for the one that did survive to make it to my base. Ran from the top of the mire to the middle of the ash heap. I kinda felt bad for the little guy. Then not even a few hours later i get a notification saying my camp is under attack and when i get there hes dead.
---
Be glad there's a dead zone and as long as you're outside the zone you're safe from death cause looking at a nuclear explosion from that distance (just outside the dead zone) would just blind you at the very best or still kill you anyway at worst.
---
You just found the spawning ground
---
I'm not really high enough level to launch nukes either, but you don't need to pick up those code pieces. The code changes once a week and is the same for everybody in the game. It's regularly posted online. You do need a keycard though, which you get as a quest thing (I think) from joining the Enclave faction. Generally, but not always, it's an over level 50 thing but people sometimes rush it and do it well before that.
---
What if it's the opposite?
---
Get all seven and you get seven baby Deathclaws you have to raise. 
---
This is endgame content I can get behind. Their names shall be Johnny, Cass, Etta, Inky, Andy, Cole, and Billie
---
Thats odd. The boxes are def NOT instanced though. Possible stealth char coulda jacked them maybe.
---
Nawt enuff caps!!
---
Baby deathclaw woo!
---
I shall pacify them and use them as my army
---
I still liked that daily challenge they had last week, where one day one of the challenges was simply "Drink a Nuka-Cola Quantum for 20 Atoms)
---
*5 seconds later*
---
Drink a Nuka-Cola Quantum - **COMPLETED** (firework explosion) +20 Atoms
---
I just used sneaking and it did 127 each shot
---
Did it mention when you bought the stove that the scavenger hunt for the plans was required?
---
Right there with you. I've had a super rough time feeling lonely, unwanted (sometimes), like I'm not good enough, and being totally burnt out from it all. This game gives me a rest from it all, an escape.
---
I normally never grab anyone else's junk - even after I kill them - but during an event like this, where I accept that my own junk will 100% get looted by someone else if and when I die, I'm not going to make a stink about it nor hesitate to take someone else's. It's like a gruesome corpse-strewn swap-meet, as far as I'm concerned.
---
Although I'd like full compensation, due to not actually putting effort into completing them, I'd say 75% of the total is quite fair. It could be around 200 atoms with full comp, and 150 with partial comp.
---
Also, a really easy way to award these atoms would be a weekly challenge to simply build an object at your camp or something.
---
If you think about it, your legendary weapons have particular perks.
---
Say you scrap 5 legendary weapons, their perks go into a kind of "loot pool", where your next weapon will be a 5 star weapon with selected perks from that pool.
---
Might not be the best place but the exterior of lucky hole mine has some, and there’s usually a few inside.
---
Not at all. I was similarly confused.
---
You die at the burrows because it's too hard for you, and somehow the new content still is a joke?
---
Mine has been ok so far, other than I lost my sloth
---
1. I completed the main story at level 60 (level 50 legendarys are better than a level 30). After the main quest you can still level up, but after level 50 you can't level up your special stats (you can only move them after each level up. Killing stuff and doing some events net you some good xp
---
2. The "black boxes" are the numbers for a certain silo (Charlie, Alpha and bravo) these codes have to be decrypted using the enclave terminal (correct me if mistaken) or by using nukacrypt.com (website that has all the codes for every silo
---
3. After a week passes, the codes will self destruct, because of the code reset. When this happens you need to find new codes (which you can find from scorched officers or feral ghoul officers.
---
Fair enough. You're totally right. It just annoys me whenever I see things like "Am I the only one who wants new songs on the radio?." Yeah buddy, you are the only one and a simple search would confirm that, . . . oh, wait.
---
"In case you haven’t humbled your ego yet, no one is responsible for catering to you because you jammed 600 hours in less than half a year and got bored."
---
I approve this message.
---
Haha gg Bethesda, you sure showed you most dedicated players that they are the laughingstock of the game for being nerds.
---
go play something else amirite!
---
Fuck anyone who enjoys the game and wants to keep playing, Bethesda doesn't want you!!
---
And everyone was complaining about how terrible the place was lol. Boy do they sound stupid now.
---
Damn it. I've been playing FO4 here lately, and it's my very first time playing. I had a bad feeling there were just way too many crows in the game to just be convenient. Thanks for the spoiler, LoL. J/K, spoiler or not, I'm still enjoying it, but there really are a crap ton of them damn birds.
---
Yh I could b wrong as well, but I *think* it’s correct
---
The worst part is in the camp menu, it shows all the atomic items with the locked icon that obviously haven't been purchased and the items before and after the column are there, but no column...
---
I’m a huge fan of the highest difficulty game possible but my experience with survival was pretty lame. I rolled up a new character and jumped in super excited. Ran down to the overseers camp, grabbed her crap and crafted a chest and weapon then turned to run towards the next town and had a level 200 something jumping down the road towards me. 
---
Pretty lame. Not mad but there’s no point. No point to try and honestly don’t see the point in a 200 coming all the way to the vault just to knock off a level 2. 
---
I didn’t come her to complain however, but I did just want to say I’d much rather see a permadeath server. That would be a solid challenge to get behind.
---
Well said
---
Really? Where did he say this? I'm all for forgiving others but they need to actually prove they're worth it.
---
Also, don't use that "grown up" excuse...
---
You had eyebots? I was swarmed by so many ghouls I could barely move.
---
They didn't add it, i posted about this yesterday asking and got shit on by the apologists for being stupid nerd and caring about some random suit.
---
They said its marketing and they are supposed to lie.
---
Came across a lvl5 at Pharma last night. I was there looking for crafting materials and hadn't been there in a while. I had a bunch of extra plans and that on me and was going to dump them at the Overseer's camp. Well I watched this L5 for a while, unlocked computers and locks for him when he couldn't, and kept him from getting swarmed with Scorched. BUT not taking them all out around him. I dropped off like 12 plans for him ranging from camp to armor, and armor mods, health items, water and food. Then another player lvl28, came around.
---
Then I hear in a faint voice "LOOK at what he gave he... " sounded like a little kid. I think they were together because on the map their dots were overlapping for a while after I left to go crap hoarding.
---
cool
---
Yh, hope it doesn’t get treated as an exploit and get nerfed
---
And that weirdass sound they make. Like, dude, you're mad at me for existing. You don't have to yell it at me, scream it to the world.
---
lol..not hard at all..jus cos i died when a goul.snuck up behind me when i was in my bloodied build..yes its a joke and no challenge
---
Guessing so but we'll see ❤️
---
I’m glad I can kill both the Mirelurk Kings and Queens in a few shots long range, cause yes the King can be a problem when detected and it gets close to u with its stagger attack, but Queen not so much tbh.. The queen is just a giant bullet sponge with a big health bar.. But with the right guns, and proper card placement giving you the best damage output you can get for your guns you’ll drain it’s health like its nothing. Last encounter with 2 Mirelurk Queens in the Bog I used a semi-auto Bloodied Explosive Handmade on them, killed them within a few seconds, barely wasting any ammo mind you. It all depends what build you’re running in the end I guess.
---
That sounds weird. I accidentally bought the clean green water purifier, but can't build it yet. When I log in later I'll check if it's the same on mine.
---
Know the first responders bot is able to take dmg and die as well
---
I’ve been using this since day one but unfortunately, one of the recent patches messed it up so the crosshairs disappears completely after a few seconds of firing like this and doesn’t reappear until you look at a player, for me anyway. Very annoying.
---
Ignore what I said about the other redditor in my earlier comment, I completed the quest last night, and have no idea what he was talking about. It only took my Lvl 63 character with a Lvl 45 silenced .45 lever action with maxed rifleman perks, 45 mins (I like to take my time) to complete it solo. got 6 legendaries all 1 star. killed about 30 ghouls, 3 mr gutsy and an Assaultron. I did enjoy it but I had more fun farming the north burrows enclave for super mutants.
---
Yep and that's how games die, people get bored of complaining and those complaints going to deaf ears.
---
They stop playing.
---
a game doesn't survive if people stop playing
---
Well people kill my deathclaw for no reason in my camp, so i not only loot your bag but i also eat you before you die.
---
in my opinion the burrows is a lot better because it’s lag-free (whitespring is the complete opposite), rad-free, has almost as many ghouls as whitespring and the legendaries tend to be better quality. last night i got a three star explosive smg on the first two rounds in the burrows, when in whitespring i would’ve had to do 10 rounds around the whole area to get even a trash two star while almost dying from rads all the time (bloodied build made that even harder)
---
I have the mod, too wrapping it in barbed wire...
---
And the pip boy. The fallout 4 pip boy app was a floppy flop. For 76 though people would use the shit out of it.
---
I did it solo last night with a lvl63 stealth sniper build (Max rifleman perks), using a silenced Lvl45 hardened lever action. took 45mins
---
Sure thing, I'll hang onto it for you!
---
Cool as it would be, it’s gonna be impossible to have cool stuff like that the way things are going. Maybe in two years? Hold your breath. And keep holding your breath for what they already teased you with- a camera! In a game you already take pictures in. Once they get it working.
---
It'd be the first CAMP 'pet'. You feed it and pet it and it grows up and protects your CAMP. It's not just tamed. It's a member of the family
---
That's the spirit. Least you'll have some cool eggs to get in the spirit :)
---
ok  i get your point, now how are you going to defend them for the more than a week that the workbenchs dont work right, or the other bugs the last update brought back? 
---
im not even going to mention the other bugs or even the daily quests been wrong.
---
Yeah, I think it was bugged as Harper's ferry had eyebots above ground as well but I'm also certain it had been cleared shortly before I got there. There was a dead assaultron at the end but another one spawned in for us. No ghouls unfortunately but I'm gona server hop it a few times when I'm home from work and see what's what
---
Happened to me a few hours ago and lost about 600 steel. Forgot I had it on me. I let it go because I looted bags in the past when I was a low level, I don’t anymore though because I can find everything I need on my own. When I see a dead players bag now, I stand over it to stop others from stealing the loot and keep myself from looking at what’s inside so I’m not tempted to steal anything myself.
---
What the fuck why did you get downvotes so much
---
Have to get those perks soon and get miself a cool pet too.
---
Same. From the complaints I was expecting a dank cave with perhaps a half-dead molerat to fight. I really enjoyed it. Even after dying four times. Loads of tough nasties.
---
On pc right when you posted this comment?
---
The Austin team is incompetent.
---
Damn dude. I hope you're okay. Being so angry about a game is unhealthy.
---
Take your time, breath deeply, and realize this doesn't matter. 
---
OP's post was about looting DURING the event. So if you meant 'AFTER' the event, you were out of context. But don't choke on this. It doesn't matter. You can keep my three clothes and two steels if that makes you feel better.
---
That has drastically improved my understanding thankyou so much ! Can't wait to finish work to play on my 4day weekend !!!
---
I concur. Though the name is quite long and might not display in the inventory properly.
---
Why was the first one in the shop for 48hrs though? I'm already confused
---
Try immodium maybe?
---
I had to do a restart on my Xbox and then it showed up. It wasn't there beforehand even though my Xbox was turned off. I think when you just shut down the Xbox it suspends the game which is why when you turn it back on it doesn't go through the little bethesta loading screen. Yet if you actually reboot your counsel it does.
---
Based on this I'm wondering how many other items I missed because the atomic shop didn't update. Looks like I will be doing an actual restart of my Xbox everyday to make sure I get all six or seven.
---
Are you temp/perma banned?
---
Then bgs probably should have marketed the burrows as "You should be maximum level 50" and not "recommended for minimum two lvl50+ players"
---
Would be nice, but doubt it.  It will either be trading for preset decent weapons or slot machine style.  Don't expect to get you best stuff here.  
---
Do wish they would clarify.
---
Melee has always been a bit dodgy when it comes to registering, but I haven’t noticed it being any shittier than it is normally.
---
You joke but I guarantee that "news" will regress to just atom shit given a few months
---
He started a 900 hour masturbation challenge.
---
He died of carpel tunnel syndrome and dehydration on day 2.
---
We appreciate your help, it can be intimidating being a PvP world being level 11 and having a level 130 just walk strait up to you.
---
That's awesome! Thankyou for your help ! Let's hope we get there soon ! I can't wait until I feel I know everything that's going on I look at the higher level dudes in awe at the moment haha , love it when they help me kill a giant radscorpion for example, good community :) love this game
---
You can buy plans and craft to your level or kill higher level enemies and hope they drop some gear. Weapons and armor also frequently drop from non workshop events.
---
Yes its still there, every time i have tried to post about it i get called a liar and an idiot.
---
So i just don't go to nuke zones anymore because i get the glitch in about 5 minutes after using a ts Tesla rifle.
---
Where are the dataminer guys to find this stuff?
---
Anyway, it's real cool. We know the sheepsquatch does have quills of some sort down its arms.
---
Weird. The inside of buildings, dungeons etc have been affected by nukes from day one. Nuke Morgantown, go inside the University and the ghouls will all be glowing. Interesting that the developers know less about their game than me lol.
---
I had a pop at her with my .50 Machine Gun and put around 500 rounds into her, and when she landed hit her with my Grognaks Axe and did absolutely 0 damage.  This has been the same the last two times I have tried this event.
---
I just go there for all the other creatures now and completely ignore the SBQ.
---
Like, not actually shocked.
---
Yeah great for PVE you said nothing about PVP. And demo is good for rocket launchers and grenade launchers not for the legendary effect.
---
Because panic-releasing further updates is actually the \#1 way to fuck up much harder than this.
---
But then I lose 500-odd caps 😞
---
Maybe there is a reason why it is called *challenge* and not *daily whatever activities*.
---
If they made it challenging for groups of players with tse weapons and full sentinel/cavalier armor then no regular player would have a chance.
---
If I enter a location that has lots of piles of fly-blown meat in it, I normally back out and come back some other time. I was lucky and had great fun in the Burrows.
---
I bet they will "fix" this before they will fix the modding problem, because clearly this is more important to be fixed.
---
Well, HF was already known to be the place to nuke for cobalt and violet flux.
---
Lies. Those hats are different.
---
He probably thought he was helping by using his card instead of you having to use yours. Personally I help people through the silos but let them launch because I don’t know where they want to launch it. This guy probably just didn’t think of that.
---
Unbelievable dude, YOU are the one who's butthurt about a built in game mechanic lmao but have fun deflecting and projecting YOUR frustration and anger when no one asked you to respond to my totally calm and reasonable input. Like, talk right and learn how to follow the flow of conversation lmao, youre not owning or schooling anyone. I really dont even need to explain to you why taking a bag of junk at ANY point before, during or immediately after the event is acceptable. Stop trying to act all high and mighty when youre just... wrong haha.
---
And in case it wasnt obvious, dont take downvotes to mean ANYTHING on this sub; most of you are clearly mindless shills and will accept anything that is spoonfed to you. Its pathetic, thank u next!
---
Go to bed it's way past your bed time. The devs said it themselves, the game is about rebuilding Appalachia. I will never hesitate to help a fellow wastlander. The game already has a problem with not having enough npc's and now you're telling me helping people ruins the immersion haha. Person to person interaction is what the entire game is about. That's literally why there are no NPCs. 
---
Did someone nuke your camp? You sound a little upset. Blackmailing a GM is a large stretch from giving some kid a few fusion cores for his bday... lemme know if you need some purified waters because it seems as though you're pretty thirsty for attention.
---
Lucky hole mine and breach and clear for lead ore. Nuke silos weight rooms for scrap lead, as all the weights you can pick up are made of lead.
---
I think people are just tired of the complaining because it is really just attention seeking in disguise. The vast majority of the posts offer no constructive criticism that could be helpful to Bethesda. So in return people tell the OP to shutup.......
---
Yea these are the players that are getting rocked in survival. They finally got bored of dying I guess.
---
*laughs in -370 comment*
---
The hilt or handle of a tool or weapon, example *I affixed milady's undergarments to the haft of my weapon before the joust, and henceforth I was her little knickerbocker glory.*
---
Bow to our true overlords, the Crab People!
---
A pair of cool minutemen?  OR A COUPLE OF SYNTHS?!
---
I have two accounts. I found a key for real cheap so I figured I’d buy it and use that account as storage. So far I have like 10k in weight spread between characters on that alt account. I have so many three star legendaries to retool or sell (sentinel/cavalier + app refresh, explosives, two shots, bloodied+40%power attack damage etc all the good stuff) that I think I’ll get bored of the game before I make a dent in them. I can’t imagine being limited to the 800 we have in the stash. Ick.
---
When the cryptid patch went live, I saw "IamGlorf" on a level 100+ character in the basement of the quest building. Could be an imposter since his name blew up.   
---
 He replied to my comment in a thread about speeding up cooking, and he admitted to using macros to spam E to auto craft or auto loot rooms. I blocked him or something because I can't see his account now, it might be in his history. Once you get a taste of automation you don't stop. You could easily macro the moves necessary to auto hop server and run a loot path. After knowing he liked the simple and harmless macros, even if 900 hours online was visible on the account at the time, it was not 900 hours of being at the computer or playing the game.
---
Yeah i use my tse minigun with heavy weapon build, havent seen anyone use a cryolator against it yet and we havent failed any yet either, so wahts this guy tooting his own horn for at using a cryolator
---
Yeah me too, other than the dead assaultron there were no other bodies
---
I think its correct aswell, never been able to build much at lv40, without using turrets aswell.. Now at 130 i can do 2 floors building with a garage on the side put a few missile turrets, decorate the inside and still have budget.. They should decrease the cost for some stuff imo, like the brahamin post, that thing takes like 15% of the budget wtf
---
It would be nice to have some kind of lock that guarantees you N minutes to complete the silo and launch the bomb before anyone else can do the same. When I do a silo I am spending more time checking the map for people trying to steal it then checking if there is a dominator around.
---
Just a suggestion: Go find the 2 new quests that were just turned on in the game for the sheepsquatch. Then compare the QUILLS at those quest sites with the quills on the sheepsquatch in that pic.
---
PSA: Using a cryolator doesnt make you some sort of god against the sheepsquatch so step doen off that pedestal you put yourself on there and collect your junk
---
And you should check out mantis's response to it. He basically just doubled down on his lies.
---
I THOUGHT THAT WAS LIKE AN ARMOR MECHANIC OR SOMETHING. Use a furious Handmade. Wondered why that happened sometimes.
---
Check out mantis's reply, shown that he is straight up lying.
---
You on PC bud? If so i can take you to the end of the silo and let you launch a few
---
I could never get into the game.  Which is bizzare, because I love everything about the concept.  The characters, the world, the prepping for battles, all of it.  I played it for two days and loved it, but for some reason I never felt motivated to pick it up again.
---
I have seen at least 20 reply's/posts that bgs didn't over hype the burrows and it was the high level players fault.
---
A lot of people said its the marketing departments job to exaggerate and lie and that it should be expected that they do so.
---
I really don't see how a complaint about the low difficulty of a "dungeon for seasoned players" offers nothing helpful to Bethesda for future balancing of content.
---
And all i'm thinking is that do these people actually want all future content to be extremely easy and low effort with no challenge whatsoever.
---
You really cant expand the longevity of your game by producing new content to draw in new customers to try out the game.
---
Literally no one does this, think of the backslash if destiny released a new "hard for seasoned players" expansion and it turns out its for the players who have just started the game.
---
Someone pointed out it may be that extra purifiers just add to the cap. So 2 purifiers will be able to hold 2 containers worth, but still generate as a single purifier.
---
So if you're at youre camp regularly a sigle purifer would probably be just as effective as 2. Since youre grabbing the water before you hit its internal cap. This would explain why it is so speratic on which ones have water or not, as it does a random roll to decide which purufier to put the bottle that its generated into.
---
Its out, if it doesn't show turn off the game &amp; start again, worked for my son
---
Git gud
---
Yes. But is 5 ranks worth the 40% of 20% of weapon damage? That is a 8% boost in damage on explosive legendary weapons for 5 ranks.
---
I shall pay my tribute of 10 cans of Pork n'Beans to this cosplay. Just don't beat the everliving crap out of me please. I swear I am a good person! :)
---
Or just give me liberty prime lol
---
Fucking annoyed enough to necro this thread that this is once again happening, often, to everyone I know that uses power armor.
---
Four fucking months.
---
No, we are not entitled to any compensation due the challenge error.
---
They are like giving away about a dollars worth of potential income every single day if you add up weekly challenges. So no
---
Yeah it carried over from 4. Was not expecting it to happen since we'd have discrepancies on the radiation resistance system, but here we are.
---
I enjoy kneecapping them. They fall just like a forest tree ahah
---
So you're saying you can do the event solo?
---
Me and my bud yes. Easy.
---
Lucky hole mine in excavator armor is usually over 400 ore for me. Provided you can handle lvl 40 mole miners, its far faster. Still has the issue of mining acid though. (I take hemlock holes as soon as i log the server. 60acid/hour. Coulped with Yao Guai and Grafton monster farming, its a decent way to stay well leaded.)
---
Next thing you'll find out he's living across the street irl.
---
If you are on PS4, I would like to see you do that without using a stimpack
---
Would they attack/be attacked by neutral things? I live near a entrance to the Whitespring and I have a robot security detail around my house, and I really don’t want to go through the trouble of taming a creature just to have it be obliterated by a double sentry bot triple assultotron combo
---
Makes it more challenging and fun, seems necessary to me.
---
Yeah they also had a picture of someone using a skull as a punching weapon. Where’s that weapon? Don’t get your hopes up.
---
I actually am on PS4 ;) psn manny_0317
---
Me and bud will be on tonight
---
Do you have that fever boy?
---
I’ve never been one hitted by anything on this game.
---
I like how you moved the goalposts.
---
You won't get initiate at this point. It's been removed from the loot pool. Consider it a legacy collector item now. New BoS paints start at "knight"
---
and by build he means the most OP of the OP items
---
“I dont know about you guys but I have no problems”
---
Its like those childhood friends who would cheat through the Age of Empires campaign and tell you that it was so hard and l2play
---
I am not saying that people are wrong about the Burrows. It was oversold as something more than it was. 
---
I am saying that shit posts are shit posts and we should just move on rather than complaining about how people respond to shitposts.
---
&gt;Armchair devs on reddit telling actual developers that they don't know what they're doing lol.
---
If you're talking about me at least get it right, modder who is helping create private servers for fo76. Not an armchair dev.
---
&gt;They are implementing instancing. But they never said they'd have instancing on the burrows. They literally said they're building the instancing now for the vault raids.
---
When did I say anything about instancing? My main issue is they used an engine that is designed for single player and tried to make it work as a multiplayer engine. 
---
&gt;Consider the fact that they took an engine designed and build strictly for single player games and re-wrote it to work with multiple players
---
They didn't rewrite it that is the issue, it is literally just fallout 4 and Skyrim with a different skin, help the scorch beasts are STILL referred to as "dragons" because they use the exact same AI as the dragons from Skyrim. It is also why fallout 4 mods still work on fo76.
---
It's hard to read on brick and barn walls too, personally I think it needs to be bigger, I'm a little saddened that I spent atoms on it tbh, but I loved it in theory
---
A vats crit on right between the eyes will do trick most for the time. Seems to get around the sentinel stuff.
---
Yeah challenges like that are so stupid, they are just there to give you a big finger in the face cause you'll never do them.
---
The left arm is the difference. Same as the knight variations. It's only the left arm rank insignia.
---
Exactly
---
Everybody who uses an explosive gun with the legendary effect needs to take a look with the card on and off. For 5 points in demo expert it is not worth the tiny bit of damage it gives you. And explosive gun will probably get you 10% extra damage that's it.
---
I think that would be too drastic a departure from current mechanics.
---
If you take a look at how it 'works' now there are several layers of RNG that determine the item you get.
---
I would think that the 'vendor' allowing you to 'skip' a couple of layers (for instance choosing weapon or armor, then perhaps category) and 'rolling' for the rest (prefixes/affixes, type, number of 'stars'...) giving you better odds of more 'valuable' results the higher the 'investment' is a more... reasonable expectation.
---
Said that as far I know no one has dug into the code looking for clues and the devs have not given us much to work with so I could be wildly off in my educated guess. I just don't want to set myself for disappointment so I am keeping the expectations... conservative.
---
Where did i say the burrow weren't in? I clearly stated that the burrows was added last patch.
---
There is. Take it from someone who actually does pvp.
---
That'd be at least a couple hundred more Atoms
---
yuo = dum mong
---
People would abuse the shit out of it though. When the carry weight glitch was about it was normal for people to walk around with 30,000lb of junk, weapons and chems, server stability keeping track of the number of item types was terrible.  
---
Stash limits are there for a reason.
---
Yes. There is an electrified blade that adds energy damage.
---
Reminds me of Terraria.
---
There are 2 stars unfilled at the moment, so you can only get 3 star weapons, but eventually they will be planning on adding 5 star weapons
---
I just do the pvp emote and teabag them. It either confuses them or makes them angry.
---
Just because the dude misunderstood what "oh sweet summer child" means doesn't make it a douche reply. The dude kept claiming that hotfixes could be applied to the servers on the fly without bringing them offline, EVEN after showing him Bethesda has already stated that they can't issue hotfixes without taking the servers offline.
---
Proving someone wrong isn't being a douche.
---
I’m a solo player. Level 88
---
I hit white springs all the time. Do a run in the building with tennis courts. Also Watoga, lvl 50 bots. If ur looking to level up those are my suggestions. Also make sure u have lone adventurerer perk card
---
Or get cranberry relish recipe. Easy to make and 10% xp bonus for 1 hour 
---
Good luck
---
I don't know, but if he accomplished anything, he made some excellent fodder for the trolls.  I still see those, "ThEy BaNnEd ThE oNe GuY wHo StIlL pLaYeD tHe GaMe!" comments on a regular basis.
---
It looses damage from the grounded mutation, but the damage is balistic
---
Is there a location for this mod?
---
You're implying that it cant be done without stimpacks
---
doppelgänger and the cooler doppelgänger
---
I'd love to make some Legendary Cookies with that bad boy
---
But what happens if people just don't say anything about the burrows?
---
Do you really think the raids coming later would be any different.
---
This game is not something you can't criticize
---
That’s awful :(
---
The nice thing about the Mirelurk Kings is that they are pretty tough, possibly the toughest of the tameable creatures, so they are likely to survive the trip home.
---
I wish they would just change it so the animals instantly teleport when tamed. Hopefully when camps become invulnerable the pets do too.
---
240v 1amp fully shocked.
---
Basically max out enforcer and run a shotgun with added limb damage, aim for the legs and then step backwards. All enemies are crippled on the ground unable to do anything.
---
And so what. Let those regular player first go and get them TSE. Wtf, no one in online games expect to be god as soon as they spawn into game. Climbing up the letter, getting better gear, that is what online game is about. If player in regular gear in same strong as player in good gear, makes no point getting good gear.
---
If you on PS4 add me man. Me and buds always launching nukes killing shit lol
---
I do exactly this. Not everyone knows that you can teleport through anything if you can get a seat, bed, workbench, or whatever else you can get a prompt off that'll move your character to it. Some people make balconies that are easy to get onto via other objects or the environment around the camp. I'm the guy that'll unlock every locked door throughout the world at least once because I hate not knowing what's behind it. Getting into player camps without lockpicking is a fun minigame.
---
Ultracite .308 does not use yellowcake it uses fluorescent. Whitesprings is the best to gather.
---
We all know that burrows is too easy. People just don't want to hear grown up men and women yapping and make a big fuss about it. About 80% of posts in this sub are about people complaining or asking Bethesda for some ridiculous changes to the games or calling someone out for griefing. People are getting tired of these negativity
---
We were Pepe Silvia all along!
---
While I can't suggest any locations, I'd recommend always being well rested. Grab as many cranberries and diseased cranberries as you can to make exp boosting food and drink.
---
Also feed the people gives exp boosting food and the path of enlightenment give an exp boosting buff.
---
Every little helps.
---
In power armour no. I have been one hit killed by a deathclaw in power armour as I landed on the corner of a rock.
---
i play.  downvoted just for the helluvit.  i feel good about myself only because i got a few beers in me.   
---
thththththththththththth
---
I’m surprised it doesn’t. Looked like it should to me as well.
---
I'll keep that in mind
---
Challenging, yes. Fun, not so much. I mean, it's hilarious watching everyone die, but frustamtraing cause you want the suffering to end XD
---
Will you feel the same after sobering up? Or will you be thinking about the mistakes you made in your life?
---
Would you feel better if I gave you a participation trophy.
---
I mean if there's different servers for different parts of the world that would make  easier, if you use that server you get your stuff updated closer to your time zone
---
That sucks!  But don’t let that deter you. I’ve had a few lower levels 40-50 (I’m 121) randomly message me to help them launch a nuke. As long as it’s late during the week where I have to go to bed for work, I’ll help them out. I’ll kill everything while they do what they need to do. Not all of us are jerks. I had a level 20 last night ask me to help him get the All Rise. I explained he’d want to wait until level 50 and why. He was a little bummed so I gave him some supplies and advice on good places to level up. I always try to help where I can.
---
REBEL SCUM!!!!
---
Nah, I’m simply remarking how you asked them if they could do it and when they said yes you changed the parameters.
---
That’s called “moving the goalposts”
---
🤙🏻🤙🏻
---
Yes.
---
Can you elaborate on that?
---
Almost the same thing as saving 2-3 times before you quite a game.
---
I just want some pet liberators.
---
Yeah I'm a tad disappointed too. Justneeds to be bigger and brighter and it'll be ok
---
Managing the mobs is a pivotal part of the event. I wouldn't call it unnecessary. Its half the challenge.
---
😏🔫
---
I had the same problem also vats keeps freezing leaving me open to attacks I’m a melee build and vats is great especially when enemies run round like their on speed, but  so annoy when underneath a scorch queen and u freeze 🥶
---
100% this. I could tell from the pictures some were broken, but they really affect how easy/hard it is to read.
---
Already out
---
Nope. It's a perk card.
---
I enjoyed it too. Was clearing out Harpers Ferry, oblivious to the Burrows quest line, wondering why other players were on my map when I couldn't see them. Another player beckoned me to follow him to the Burrows entrance and it all made sense. Cleared it out together and got a few legendaries on the way.
---
This. I pretty much have to do this almost every day now to get the shop to update.
---
Thats not true and its way more complicated than it initially seems. Long story short, your awareness of the enemy is based on looking, but your character awareness is based on math. If your character is unable to discover the presence of my character, my first shot at you will be 2.5x.
---
Do the pylons electrocute you too? I seem to lose health quite quickly
---
Gimmie another minute bro. I'm pushing as hard as I can
---
maybe but the point being you cannot complete I am become death unless you are the one who initiates the nuke, he lost out on the quest completion and trophy/achievement
---
I too enjoy making up my own definitions to words, it's awesome! In the "I'm a bit dumb" sense of being awesome of course.
---
You have to own the eggs yourself via purchasing them from the store. This would do nothing.
---
Rebuilding Appalachia or building more nukes and fusion cores, not the same thing. Devs could just randomly give out nukes to individual players and it would be far more interesting than this bullshit meta we have now. Its as boring as playing golf, oh look scrubdude69 just nuked another nuke into the nuke hole congrats.
---
I see an awful lot of hand holding and no anarchy anywhere. And I am okay with that, kill Fallout fine by me more Elder Scrolls VI. I just hope the developers for that game are real dungeon masters and not soft moba cuckboys.
---
Yeah. When you're the conduit you are shocked continuously. The more plyons you conduit, the faster you die. Hence you want 3 people minimum.
---
We lock the item you wanna trade before confirm trade.
---
He can add me to, and watch me do it solo as well, wmcg204 I got a few buds who can pylon and I will crush this stupid sheep bot solo lol it’s all in the build, the armour and the gun.
---
I’ve seen the Flatwoods one twice. Once it spawned deep in the wasteland hills near the array and it was a high level.  Tough fight kicking my rear left and right. Finally got it down and it dropped....zip.   
---
Second time it was in the Dark hills to the south south east of Morgan town just north of the trailer treasure spot and east of the radio tower there. It was night. It’s very dark in that area.  It appeared pinkish purple glowing. Got that one down in health then a hostile scorchbeast spawned out of place and promptly took my attention then a second. It was near scheduled maintenance a couple months ago so idk if thats their way of getting players to log off or not...just spawn a few scorchbeasts. But ran east then back to chase down flatwoods. It was still around but health was all the way up. It actually retreated went up a hill and down behind it with me trailing and when I got to top of hill it was gone.
---
Exactly. With them proper stuff it’s easy as hell and he dies hella quick. The robots are breakfast
---
Take over workshops easy xp when you defend it. You can walk around white springs, watoga Harper's ferry, the burrow and of course fight the queen and sheepsquash. Plus any events that pop up. My favorites are uranium fever ,one violet night, fly swatter, heart of the swamp and any enclave event good luck!!
---
Had a good chuckle at the visual
---
Do they give you Atoms for the challenges that involve discovering places like Grafton dam, Harpers Ferry and Valley Galleria? 
---
These challenges have been in the game since day 1 and cannot be completed.
---
You'll find the answer to both questions is "no"
---
Civil War Suit 5 cloth 1 gold = 20 caps
---
Civil war dress 5 cloth 1 crystal =19 caps
---
What if people said something but in a a constructive way?
---
 For example an op could talk about instancing, the size and scale of a dungeon, the lack of enemy diversity, the lack of a theme other than being underground, the lack of anything BOS besides one scribe at the start, the lack of any true story line with multiple parts, the linearity of the dungeon, the amount of time it takes vs what it should take, the lack of any lead up to the dungeon besides a random sewer lid, the lack of anything differentiating a dungeon vs any other heavy enemy location (whitesprings, west tek, etc), the lack of a difficulty scaling for higher level players beyond lvl 50.
---
I can go on and on about issues and could talk in more detail about each. I could discuss why what Bethesda did was half assed compared to what they should have done. What I won't do is complain about the difficulty. Bethesda was up front about that. The dungeon is for 1-2 lvl 50 players.
---
Not an especially good reason though if you ask me.  First thing I do in single-player Beth games is hit up the console and give myself more carry weight than I could ever possibly need, and never look back.  It's vastly more fun.
---
Don’t forget guys we have the Arktos Pharma dungeon that the developers talked about so that might be more difficult
---
Hi I'm on xbox 1....could you make me a lvl 50 fixer..... I could give you caps or a legendary weapon or armour
---
In eve online you can look and see what star systems have lots of people in them, how many ships were destroyed in a given time period, etc.  The map will outright show you where the hotspots are, and yet people still waltz right into ambushes.
---
I'd be willing to craft one, but sadly I won't be home for a while :/
---
I doubt it, unless you aggro the bots. Mine wouldn’t even attack hostile creatures unless they actually went inside my house (for some reason pets spawn inside the house at my current camp).
---
Agree with you on that. He didn't say anything about 'soloing' sheepsquatch. He didn't say he could do it without using stimpacks. This goalpost here is getting narrower and narrower while constantly moving around lol
---
 [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlCPkmb6cuY](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlCPkmb6cuY)
---
Seems to me everyone is perma-crouched these days, never see 1,2 or 3 on the map anymore. 
---
Think Beth should make them visible crouched or not..
---
shit posts are something you can’t criticize though?
---
It’s become another “don’t log out without power armor” spots. 👀
---
I didn’t have a choice, as my game crashed while in the burrows.  
---
Then when I reload, I’m taking rads and panicking lol. Thank goodness my power armor is easier to equip now. 😅
---
Now it makes sense. My auto stim perk wastes so many stimpacks on that alone it's ridiculous how powerful it really is.
---
As mentioned there is electrified, however, just an FYI, the Blade of Bassett is pretty much flat out better.
---
All indications are that it does more base damage.
---
As standard it's Anti-Armour
---
and if you go whole hog Misstress of Mystery then it becomes 100% Armour ignoring.
---
&gt; two very different things
---
You mis-spelled "pedantically, trivially, technically" as "very" there.
---
Have you tried turning it off and on again? Is it plugged in at the wall?
---
The only situation in which I have encountered the keypad doing nothing and the switch not working is when the door isn't wired up
---
Lol!
---
Haters gonna hate lol
---
Looks like the super dooper perks had an upgrade 😂
---
I've spent way over $200 on the Collector's Edition for PS4 and another $40 on a regular edition for PC. That's four times as much as the average player has paid. 
---
According to your logic, I should be entitled to four times as much content as the average player.
---
Wait... I'm not? How come?
---
8pm each night, per multiple posts here..  
---
(Egg 2 became available at 8.01 last night.)
---
there are those who rip the arse out this game.generally they will be the dupers,griefers and general arseholes. "apparently,there is a lot of them"
---
unfortunatly, everyone now gets tarred with the same brush. so unless the powers that be,make it impossible to cheat your way thru the game,then all will be treated as 
---
"suspect". blame the arseholes that came before you.
---
maybe something relevent. type in to google "fallout 76" and you will get a utube "this game is bad".How long has this game been out ? the first scream out his gob is "where the fucks the npc's"....... DON'T take this personaly,but i'm in agreement with the others. those that don't like this game,could you please close the door 'quietly' on the way out.
---
previous comment is correct, 'constructive critisism' (for or against)
---
A saw someone on here mention that with 2 points in cola nut and a small crates worth of nuka cherry on your favourite wheel, you can out heal the pylons for pretty much the whole fight.
---
Seriously, cola nut turns cherry and quantum into ridiculous god tier healing items.
---
It's brand new, so not surprising. Someone had just been through when I went, judging by all the ash and goo piles. Give it a few days and it'll probably quiet down.
---
If this is a lag where you still have your items after trading them, or that your friend now has 3 after you sold one to them, then its just a visual error and these bugged items are unusable and will disappear on relog.
---
sorry, wrong sub .... my bad =/
---
Overrepaired weapons loose it's "bonus" damage from 200% to 100% condition and then it has it's base damage. I don't tell you the exact number but my instigating+SS Sledgehammer that has around 3xx base damage (with all perks) repaired to 200% have 4xx, so it's below 50% bonus.
---
99 little bugs in the code.
---
Take one down. Patch it around.
---
127 little bugs in the code...
---
No, but presumably an update will. A lot of the pictures for various updates show unreleased content (case in point, the Arktos lab coat in the pictures).
---
With this logic, no wonder F76 is failing. If ESO, Destiny 2, WoW or Division did also "Ohh we can't add better dungeons, because regulars wouldn't be able to beat it", they would be failing too.
---
Well the thing is that most interior locations are affected so this would be an exception if it remained unaffected
---
Ikr
---
I know right
---
Yeah, who would've thought...
---
Not going to lie, game was a bit of mess when it was released 6 months ago.
---
Now, its a game I will recomend to a fallout fan. (Except those Elitist New Vegas fans, nothing ever pleases them )
---
I can see what you mean there
---
👌
---
Ahh so the ghoul sneaked up on ya and was able to hit you over 10 times due to your controller's battery running out? Why didn't you say so bro
---
It's the fastest fire rate gun in the game I am pretty sure. 500 can't be beat.
---
No, because people are seeing stuff like that and then clogging up this subreddit with topics like "omg where is the sheepsquatch I cannot find him!" 
---
He is not the sheepsquatch, he is the imposter sheepsquatch and theres a really big difference there but you can keep pretending if you like!
---
I'm not following. ???
---
Radiation works great if they're too low. Pretty sure that burns thru sentinel as well.
---
Good tip. I'll consider that. I was considering using my healing factor serum but it would render my stims useless
---
I found some dead CoA lights at one of the watch towers... but I haven't seen any live ones yet.
---
The laser heaveys have quite a few mods
---
As an outfit hoarder, I can say it is def not your outfits.
---
Yeah, steady on with that. I think healing factor only works out of combat. If would cripple you in that event.
---
This is exactly what I do. I wait until everyone leaves the area. My thoughts are if you leave the event area and your bag is still on the ground, you forfeit the contents. I did find a bag with a TON of bulk items and I was like hell yea. The next day my friend was telling me how he dropped his bag of bulked junk at the event, forgot about it and left only to remember and travel back in hopes of finding it. Of course I fessed up and we all had a laugh. He got really lucky it was me who picked it up and not some random. Finders keepers 😈
---
I always keep a modded lvl 5 hunting rifle on me. I drop them for low level players along with 200-300 ammo some stims rad-x and rad away. For a level 5 player a rifle which does 50+ damage is a great weapon.
---
I drop the stuff make sure they pick it up and then leave. Though ocasionally they will try to attack me IDK why it's quite annoying.
---
Where would you like the war zone to be? Because there will be one.  It will be somewhere where you get caught up in it too.  Right now they occur at train stations because that is where people spawn in. When that gets worked around it will happen right outside of them where people want to walk to get to quests, the club house, etc. What I’m saying is the war will happen in a high traffic area.
---
Took me some time trading and grinding since beta to manage to acquire sets of bloodied explosive 50% crit weapons &amp; unyielding/bolstering, AP Refresh, Chameleon, Harder to Detect, Sentinel pieces for my stealth crit sniper. But man, now that the build is somewhat almost complete, you can def say “the most op of op items”😂 
---
People still say melee is 1st though.. I’ll take mid range vats stealth sniping over melee any day though.
---
That could be a giant chandelier. Why not have a few jars with one in each one (pickle jar sized) with it all connected by a metal system.
---
I am 77 and never launched a nuke yet on this account. Levelling up was super fast in survival and before I knew it was up 30 levels. 
---
I need to do that soon.
---
Items that don't weigh anything are still taking up a slot in your inventory kiddo. This post is about clutter not weight.
---
He was probably aping Twitch streamers.
---
Ohh I hadn't thought of that, good tip
---
do we know what the reward is?
---
Not if they release NCR ranger armor on atomic shop. Oh wait it's lore breaking so they still gon be pissed
---
The AA is better because the 2 shot is less accurate and does less damage
---
They hardly ever fix anything, I wouldn't worry too much...
---
Do not support these devs with any more money until they decide to return to making games based on passion and NOT monetization.
---
There was a statue set for 500 atoms. I bought it as it was the first item I saw in a while which was awesome.
---
I have someone who offered 2000 caps for it. I bought it for 300, so I'll take that instead
---
Uh huh.  THATS the reason you made the distinction, I'm sure.
---
Also where is cola nut in special?
---
This concept would be awesome but I doubt it they Wil ever add it :(
---
Yes, for that price.
---
Endurance
---
Nevermind that you might get stuck in situations where you simply CAN'T login. I missed the first one due to a total loss of internetconnection because some constructionworkers did a whoopsie on the line.
---
It’s trendy to say it’s awful. Everyone who never played or only played at the beginning will say it’s awful.  The current players like most people you will find here enjoy the crap out of it. It’s came along way and with constant updates and add ons it’s only on the up and up. I suggest get it. Even if you just play solo and fo4 style it’s still fun.  I can spend hours looting and building my camp.
---
Why do you have 15 downvotes. Your reasoning makes sense especially when the event is rarely completed from my experience. (I can't even be a conduit because the event already drained all my meds and ammo)
---
I'm naming him Rufus ♡
---
This is weird to see in reply to a post that basically says he expects it to be terrible.
---
Uh, thats exactly why I made the distinction, are you okay? Qhy are you speaking when no one asked u? Lmaooo
---
Awesome. I've got an instigating lever I use for trash clearing, ima use that for boss fights. I'll be on around 1130-4 central time. I'll message you then.
---
your not making sense..the green ghoul one tapped me cos i was at 20% health  main reason not going back to burrows is because there is no point..quicker and easier to farm whitesprings and more chance of a legendary.
---
Oh God please do.
---
That or just switch to third person mode when you are using the gatling gun and you get a perfect aimpoint.
---
Marine Tactical Helmet is the way forward! 1 Glass, 1 Plastic, 3 Rubber. Sells for around 30c. Yass!! Slap on Super Duper and you're laughing all the way to the ~~bank~~ vendor!
---
Oh my god!
---
You told someone to "talk right" while essentially telling someone they arnt smart enough to read. 
---
Get off you rage horse partner. You arn't even close to being more intelligent than anyone around here.
---
I didn't think crouched players were actually hidden on the map. I do believe though, if there's a tie requiring the map to show more than three players, none of them show up. I've seen plenty of instances where only #1 is visible, and 2-5 are tied for 2nd, with none of them visible.
---
There’s a lot of bugs, oversights, and poor design choices that haven’t been cleaned up even since BETA. I can’t tell you which this particular one is.
---
Ok, sounds good. Thanks for the clarification!
---
Not watching a 30 minute vlog. Where is it?
---
Especially when the beginning starts with the poor little victim crying about people "making up lies about him". Literally quoting him is lying now?
---
It’s out. Came out at about 8pm est last night. Or atleast that’s when I got it.
---
" **Favorites:** When Favoriting  multiple weapons of the same type, the radial favorites wheel now  correctly saves players’ selections across play sessions "

Lie, incompetence or both ?

The two shot fat man is h*ckin awesome!! You're using a mini nuke, you aren't worried about quality... You're worried about making papa Torgue proud and two explosion for the price of one is AWESOME!!!

Good try, partner. Anybody else got any two cents? Just take your upvotes and leave at this point lmao
---
It was part of the update last week .. 2gb on PC?
---
Someone sounds a bit salty
---
As a low health build, all I do is manage adds. I consecutively 1-shot drop the wave of gutsys, then start popping eyebombs before they can get near the action. At 52 health, it's not like I can really survive as a conduit.
---
Although I am considering just using PA and a vampiric auto handmade next time.
---
I do a lot of solo, Saturday morning I was 72, I'm now 92, I probably get the most xp from events - literally just fast travel from event to event to event without stopping until you need to empty your inventory. The only xp buff I use is the well rested buff, but the cranberry recipe sounds good too. 
---
I'm not sure if event grinding or mob grinding is better XP, but I did get an entire level in half an hour at an event that was bugged and just kept spawning super mutants, but it's definitely way less boring to do events
---
RNGsus hates me. \~ lvl 200 . Have seen one mothman, and it was during the mothman event...  
---
I have the statue, the poster, and have been wearing the ritual mask/bindings since \~october 23rd 2077.  
---
ugh.
---
From what I have read, a terminal in the Enclave bunker gives you the location of the cargobots carrying the cards.
---
You may find the cargobots by accident/without having the quest.  
---
One got my attention b/c it sounded different than the cargobot that drops supply containers....it was red, I managed to shoot it down.  
---
Codes from the ghoul officers self destruct every...Tuesday, I think.  
---
The launch card from the bot does not expire/does not self desctruct.
---
It's real and it's coming. Datamined atom shop items also show that there will likely be a week with quest release and items relating to the theme
---
http://imgur.com/gallery/byR00dz
---
Sorry but if you're stupid enough to bring junk to the event then I'll be taking it.
---
Westek is best as it always spawns a ton of high level super mutants which give great exp and you will often find 2-3 legendary enemies with multiple stars
---
Ah bummer, I get home 4:30 central! No worries, we can figure something out!
---
Saying that's a safe bet is an understatement. There would be mass disappointment even if it turns out to be the best thing in the history of video games.
---
It does. Reminds me that im still on the hunt for an explosive radium rifle. Need that good automatic reciever too. The grind is real
---
Nah. It's a super efficient use of 5mm ammo.
---
No, you just need to be aiming, as per this post

FO 76 is the first video game I have ever spent more than 200 hours on.  I grew bored with FO4 before 200 hrs.  If you are PVP, go find another game.  But if you want to play with others in the same world you can solo, I recommend the game.   I love having the choice without having to build a different character for each style of play. 
---
Not everything is perfect, but if your goal is fun, the game is worth it
---
Picking one thing working on it for a day straight testing it for another is not panic releasing.
---
Do the bots ever accidentally hit your base? That might aggro the pet.
---
Jordan Peele's: Fallout 76 "US"
---
Good shout actually. I have a vampires combat rifle and shishkebab so I'll probs use those
---
If they do anything they should quarter the experience gain drop ghouls down there and quadruple the ghoul count. Same overall experience to keep people from leveling too fast but a fuck tonne of ghouls to handle and more loot.
---
Do you understand the concept of a public forum like this?  "lmaooooo"
---
last night 8pm EST
---
They put one of each faction vendor in the white spring in one of the last updates. I’m not sure why though.
---
Hit me up on PC, I'm Lionneserra. I'm swimming in junk and while I don't have my precise inventory memorized, I bet I can build a full set or nearly-full set with what I've got on hand.
---
No charge, tips or karma appreciated.
---
Yeah, I was hoping by asking them point blank would hopefully force them to fix it out of shame.
---
They ignore all reports stating that it's not being fixed. 
---
They would pass as liars, incompetents or both it they did.
---
also the heavy barrel on the auto grenade launcher just increases weight and not damage is stated in the description
---
Thanks for pointing that out. It's time to start saving my colas
---
You need a neon sign
---
I laughed out load to this. Thanks eljne.
---
So it's easier for people to deplete each factions vendors cash pool 😓
---
That would be horrible, I server hopped a shameful amount of times to get my X-01 calibrated shocks and jetpack. In hind sight, I would have just got all T51b armor and focused on getting the plans to build what I wanted.
---
Was the armor just sitting loose in your stash or on a frame? and are you certain you didn't scrap it by mistake?
---
As far as I can tell I've never lost anything from my stash, but I have accidentally scrapped stuff, and back when mods would autoscrap I lost a few of those.
---
I'm not sure what you lost, but if you are on PC I have spare x-01 jetpacks I can trade. Calibrated shocks though, those are hard to come by, especially 2.
---
Gamma gun fills some of that void. Gives those aoe rads tho the full auto mod kills the range.
---
Well you can go back to single player games then. The limits are what force us to need to make choices about what to keep and what to sell. Inventory management is a part of the game for a reason. You are the aberration here.
---
There*
---
They said it was balanced for two normal level 50+ players.
---
 Not two level 50+ twinks who have Min/maxed every single stat, perk, weapon and armor.
---
 If you currently have one of the God builds or a God weapon you will never find anything challenging.
---
Bethesda will never make content for OP God builds.
---
 This is a fall out game after all which means at some point you will be completely over geared to where there is no challenge left to be had.
---
Because he's whining about not having enough stash space, which is absolute bullshit.

 Because he's whining about not having enough stash space, which is absolute bullshit.

I had a situation such like this - two leaders on the V76. We went there and kicked them out. After twenty minutes of regular two-sided asaault between two gangs, I realised I must be looking as a spawn-camper for rest of the map. What you describe could as well be me, but we were there to hunt the hunters, not to camp the spawn.
---
Damnnnn! You two are looking good!
---
The part about homosexuality start less than a minute in. From 1:50 he says that he has realized that it isn't a choice and that changed his opinion. He admitted to being wrong and that realization also meant that he could be wrong in other aspects too, and now try to avoid political discussions.
---
I don’t, actually, I don’t want to risk losing it when I’m just messing around. I had just pulled it out to show my “customer.”
---
I completed the main questline last weekend - Level 84 and 230 hours in!  I have a very casual approach to these sort of games ... lots of exploring, CAMP building, getting side-tracked, gathering materials etc.
---
The last few stages will guide you through the keycard and codes.
---
Because enough people whined about spending caps to fast travel to the various vendors
---
If you don't wanna spend the caps, then spend the time walking, get over it.
---
I'm always up for giving out a hand.  Hit me up too glenn4moose on the xbone.
---
I am not working on much currently beyond finishing up the map so I will be in the forest at some point too.
---
You can nuke the area for some legendary farming, the nuking even spreads into the burrows.
---
I get that a lot too - like the gun just decided on its own to take aim at a Cargobot that’s not actually there, right?
---
Someone nuked harpers ferry just an hour ago and it was really... Disappointing? There were a few glowing ones, but only one of them legendary. I spent quite some time down there. And all i got was one piece of crappy legendary armor. But when i'm in nuked whitesprings i usually have so much legendary weapons i have to drop them on the floor.
---
Wait you have to find the egg!!! I thought you just purchased it and you owned it
---
My science project
---
Writing negative critic and getting the feel of being mocked by others as a result?  Subjective observation. Dont take everything personal, man up. BUT afterwards complaining about complains, because you complained about something completelty trivial? Thats double standards and should be mocked into the infinite universe.
---
I guess your username should've clued me in on that LMAO. But that's too bad... I would've gave it to you for cheap because it's just been taking up room in my stash for a couple months now and I feel for your situation. I hope you find another one soon.
---
It’s a common sighting to see people dropping stuff to give away every time someone drops somethings it’s “to drop” not to use as temporary storage or inventory organising so I don’t blame him and every person on this toxic and pessimistic subreddit should just calm down and take some deep breaths everybody.
---
Glowing paper bags
---
Why exactly is that bullshit?  You obviously don’t agree with him, which you’re more than entitled to, but does that automatically make it bullshit?
---
I want nukashine Syringe for the Syringer. Would totally start tagging players, deathclaws, and scorch beast in the hopes that they get drunk and randomly teleport
---
No, not that I’ve seen. The area where the enemies attack is facing away from my base, so I think I should be good. I’ll just remove my turret so that it won’t Agrro the bots
---
My friend and I got bored for a little while and build a brahmin launcher carnival game.
---
In regards to rerolling, they could also make it so rerolling all the perks on your item of choice is cheaper than individually rerolling each effect. Like, 5 tokens to reroll everything, but costs 15 to reroll just one effect.
---
I agree this needs addressing, I was teamed up with my team-mates ready to launch a nuke at the burrows yesterday. Everything was going fine and we launched the nuke  and BAM, we were all chucked out of the team and unable to friend one another again.
---
This has not only happened this time either it's happened on multiple times in the last week alone.... it's infuriating as we each have to tag an enemy to get any loot
---
They just flicked a switch to make it available this week. 
---
It could have been available all along, but they like to stretch whatever thin content they provide us as much as they can...
---
It may be that the column is underneath the stairs section as a new variant as there are several posts you can build there, if not i am unsure
---
Now that's a thought. We should get that too.
---
I'm not denying it is part of the game.  It's a tedious, uninteresting, un-fun part of the game that doesn't need to be there, but it is.
---
Same, couldnt get them to respawn
---
The eggs are suppose to release at 8p EST each night.
---
Last night, the new one was available to me at 8.01.
---
[PS4] It seems melee is "laggy" usually my first hit makes the sound like it hit but does no damage it's quite annoying.
---
Having to build around one build is dodobutter. I use sneak/autorifle build w/ mutations in the future but I don’t have the vats crits nor explosive type. This character is only lv 41 that being said I do alright been killing high levels by just listening to gun shots - getting set up in chameleon and unloading on them in vats. I’m using a plain Jane auto combat rifle non lego. Why vats? Because normal shots don’t do near as much damage and after three or four vats I’m hitting for 95%. Btw vats doesn’t seem to work if the other player is also sneaking. I’m kindle dissappointed that sneak attacks from sneak don’t apply a multiplier... now I understand they normalized damage and it’s a step in the right direction but it should be normalized to the weapons RoF and the type. I would also like to see sneak attacks work... with reduced damage but nudges it over the cap a little. Just my two sense - I wanna see more viability in all builds not just one or two that work well and are meta in survival/pvp.
---
Killing assaultrons can drop you the plan for the mod.
---
Ok thanks
---
I’ve been playing since November and like I said I’m only level 27. So I doubt I’ll be there in a few months.
---
I find the current setup just right for my needs, I have a good balance between defence, decoration and production.
---
I gotta agree. While the game has been a bit of a mess it's become kinda therapeutic for me even as a solo player(I spend most of my time alone anyway so it's not that different from my life)
---
Sometimes life gets the better of me with school and trying to figure out what I'm gonna do with my life for the next 40-50 years only for your job not to give a shit about you or the student loans and failed relationships and lack support. It all takes a toll on my mind. And even it's hard to feel some sense of worth in anything when nihilism and existentialism plague your mind uncontrollably. If you couldnt tell depression has kinda rooted itself in me for awhile now, on its 7th year lol 
---
I guess what I'm trying to say is I get where you're coming from. Sometimes I think I really do wish I could inhabit the fallout universe cause all you gotta do is survive, no student loans, no pressure to figure my life out, no need for deep thinking, no nothing.Fucked up I know and maybe a hell of reach but just wanted to say me too man
---
Me too
---
This happened to me so many times when  I was low level I even got threatened by a guy telling me to move my base as I was in his spot since when was that a thing😠 as I was new to game I just left, I was so nervous about playing again but then I bumped into someone who helped me out which gave me hope and I’m happy to say I’m over level 100 now and I help as many low levels as I can it’s fun especially helping with quests I done way back when I first started it seems like years since I done them I love it .lastly Not all of the fallout community likes PVP   So please leave us alone if we don’t shoot back.
---
Haha sadly no! It’s just a nickname for our first husky that makes me laugh so I use it 😝
---
I'm a wired connection on PC.
---
I have seem people mentioned reinstalling helped, so I'm thinking of trying that. Although I'll probably give scan and repair a go first.
---
me too.
---
PSA: Stop crying and leave your junk at Camp if you're worried about losing anything.
---
I thought about this last night with my team, it would be perfect for a PvP capture the flag type event
---
You got the mystery meat from Toxic Larry's  ( a great place to farm snallygasters btw).  I think those are the only ones released so far unless others have been found around the world.   It looks like these particular quests are tied to finding the monthly newsletters on cryptid.  So far we have October and January.   I'm thinking we will maybe find all the other months to get the other plans.
---
Fun fact - The strangler blooms are open during the day but really hard to see.  But they glow at night making them easy to pick out from the closed variant.  Visit the river next to Dyer chemical at night and you should be able to pick up 4 - 5 easy.  Equip Green Thumb to double that.  Watch out for the gulpers.
---
needs the razor blade mod...
---
He obviously doesn’t get lovin’ from a biggun’
---
I basically played my first 50 levels with a serrated machette and super sledges it took me forever to find good weapons.
---
If there’s an auto walk for console please let me know!
---
I'm you, but stronger
---
...Skyrim?
---
Yeah I even tried with the normal photo mode, didn't work. ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯
---
This challenge doesn't work even if you meet the requirements.
---
Well, if you knew anything about server database handling and information requests you would not say it does not need to be there. It needs to be there. A lot. In fact, it is one of the most important parts of the game, because with unlimited stash space no one would be playing the game. At all. We would be stuck at infinite loading screens, spinning wheels and enemies that do not load client side but still kills us server side.
---
No amount of dev skills or bandwidth could solve that. 
---
That is just how servers work.
---
My name is Neil Armstrong, and I approve this message.
---
Pick up every piece of junk you see. Scrap it bulk it and sell the bulked junk I used to rely on bulked glass and ceramic to get caps early in the game
---
I don't take paper bags unless they drop them at my CAMP or at a station. Then again I do ask if it's someone's stuff before I pick it up.
---
If I find a bag after a player dies, I guard it until they return so that they have their fear still.
---
Respect is the best way to go.
---
It is in development timelines.
---
Going from bug report &gt; analysis &gt; making time on dev available &gt; thorough build ensuring you don't break more stuff &gt; peer review &gt; getting test team to drop all their stuff to just test this one patch. All that is practically impossible. Nevermind fucking up your current sprint schedule, going against planned releases AND getting the patch signed off from Microsoft and Sony.
---
Just not gonna happen. Bethesda don't just sit on their hands all day, breaking schedule for one relatively small fix is extremely risky and creates much more room for error.
---
They oughta at least add the Enclave scientist uniform, bring back that weird orange bubble head suit
---
Daily not dsily lol
---
About 20 percent of my melee hits have not been registering since the last patch.
---
Est?
---
I'm sorry mate but this is without a doubt, the corniest shit I have ever read on reddit.
---
That’s why I’ve got a Deathclaw skin rug in my house. That way they know what happened to Mama and they think twice.
---
If it's the Sheepsquatch event many might not have enough time to do so. We all immediately respond to events and head there without thinking.
---
Thanks, didn't know that.
---
okay this is good to know, thank you :)
---
and yeah, Bethesda tends to do that a lot I was just worried I were going to miss out on the Easter surprise because of slow internet download speeds and lack there of. thanks again!
---
I really hope they will reset for me - need to farm Queen of the hunt for mothman and accidentally finished that quest yesterday :/
---
I already have the patch downloaded then, thank you for letting me know :)
---
White springs for leveling up. 
---
Blueprints do events
---
Unless it's something the players enjoy doing.
---
You called it sir hahaha. Was here looking for info on the vendor. Saw your prediction which came true.
---
How do you get mods and where can you find the cryolator at? I have a cryolator but don't know where I got it from.
---
I still do not agree with you calling it easy, when a glowing ghoul can take 20% of your health with a single hit. I do agree with whitesprings being a better farming spot :)
---
I was thinking that might be possible, but I don't see the healthbar scale back up like the invincible mob bug a while back so I think this is something different.
---
It seems less like the server ignoring damage it doesn't like and more that it just doesn't get through properly at all.
---
it should be hard to do, but requiring a TSE is a bit high. I've put alot of hours into it and have yet to get a TSE. Someone dropped me one back in the dupe days but I refused to pick it up. It should still require good weapons and armor and even more so tactics. I wouldn't be upset if it would require a team to do it. 
---
Thats the bad part with an online (multiplayer) game, you can't just provide content for one group of players. At least in the single player mode we could select the difficulty.
---
I have a feeling the other vaults will be your high end "raid" difficulty dungeons or at least I hope that will be the case.
---
yes
---
I have been wanting people to push for this for ages. Crappy free mobile games show enough care to their customers to do this when they mess up, pretty upsetting that it happens quite often with this game and no remorse is shown and continues to happen.
---
Thanks for letting me know, seems a bit useless especially when you use vats
---
I always pick up a roll of toilet paper if there.
---
Are you under the impression that every one of my 50k+ ammunition count as a separate item that needs to be communicated to the server on a regular basis?
---
Just so you know you can find the silo codes online they reset every week all you need is the key card
---
"Steal"?
---
Oh now I remember. I saw that before and I guess it didn't mean anything. Just a wild goose chase.
---
people are just shitty. realistically you should be storing your junk prior to the event for this reason.
---
Do devs really read her? I have the most minor complaint. The fonts are so tiny even on a large TV. If there was an option to change its size that would be so great. Lot of us gamers are getting older and our eyes aren't what they used to be :)
---
well maybe got 2 hits lol..i was in a cramped space.
---
I don't think the people living in the Wasteland would agree with you about this lost cause sort of thing...
---
I am sure the sub exists by another name.
---
This is the correct answer. Working since 90s as intended.
---
Is there anyway we can get the first one? I missed oyt the first one as well 😔
---
You need the camera for it to work.
---
Who gives a shit about votes? I care about pompous asshats who think they are smarter than everyone despite barely being able to scratch the surface of normal.
---
There is difficulty in this game?
---
There is end game content in this game?
---
This game still exists after 2 years?
---
I know it sucks but it's not really that big of a deal, now you know the process the next time will be a lot easier to go through the silo and launch it. I mean the point of the game is to launch nukes around so you will definitely do it again and again in the future.
---
It was apparently a part of a quest at one point. People did some crazy crap trying to find some secret meaning behind it.
---
I think Camelworks contacted some employees and got to the bottom of it.
---
He's not whining about stash space, he is stating that he doesn't drop off loot because there is nowhere he can drop it off at and still get to the event in a decent amount of time. Most lobbies I am in never seem to actually do conduits so the commenter needs to get there 2-3 minutes early. Just read the shit before calling it bullshit.
---
I found leveling in the toxic valley good for 20-30. And events and safes are good for plans in general. Events are good for leveling as well
---
Not my concern, they are fictional, so it matters not.
---
Yeah, but she was mistaken abut it not being nukable and corrected herself here:  
---
 [https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/be58tf/i\_nuked\_harpers\_ferry\_to\_see\_what\_all\_the\_fuss/el4o0kl/?context=1000](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/be58tf/i_nuked_harpers_ferry_to_see_what_all_the_fuss/el4o0kl/?context=1000)
---
At this point I'm just waiting for Star Dew Valley to get nukes.
---
Love this game I'm a massive fallout fan by far my favourite universe yes 76 was broken when it first came out but it getting better if your a big fan you'll love it .
---
I think this is a real thing but I've been having trouble landing well aimed hits or shots of any kind here recently. It's like it doesn't register or sometimes it will register a few seconds later, but either way it's really annoying.
---
They said in their twitch stream that it was not supposed to be nukable, but that was wrong and they corrected themselves here:
---
Get rekt noob
---
So this is the end game content? Help low level players to farm junk? Sounds interesting!
---
Uh, I want to make one too.
---
(Warning, highly toxic) *It is going to be the simplest feature it could be:*
---
1. Trading in gives the same amount of tokens (I.e. 1 token for a level 1, 1-star pipe pistol or 1 token for a level 45, 3-star handmade)  
---
1. Rerolls costs a static amount of tokens (e.g. 10 tokens)
---
1. Rerolls are completely random (I.e. a 3-star could become a 1-star weapon)
---
1. Optional: it is going to introduce a bug that messes with mods on a rerolled weapon.
---
I thought it might have timed up with some build changes I've been making, so I have attributed it to that. I have noticed that, in any case.
---
lol, so tru
---
realized this too late. went from 50 stimpacks to 3 after two runs
---
It was actually my steel and bulk steel
---
yeah there are some real asshats in this game! Dont let it run you off, there are many of us nice players too :)
---
Message me on xb

"Fallout 76 - Keep waiting updates"
---
Nothing new. The game is to win. 
---
By any means  necessary.
---
that's seriously the most annoying.
---
its already fucked up that they're stealing your shit,
---
but on top of it, they stop participating to do so. really irks me
---
now i do!
---
Never mind. I was just being dumb again.
---
You meant East, not West.
---
I don't even see deathclaw statue in build mode. What am I missing here?
---
My sides
---
Friggin’ ticks. The worst drop rate, ugh.
---
Any secret locations for screws? I hit Point Pleasant, Astronomy place, and Charleston Herald as my main locations.
---
I would love it if they randomly hatch a Deathclaw. Be all like, like "Suprise Mother Plucker!"
---
I think you should be fine then.
---
I agree. PA builds are presented as one possible skill tree branch to go down.
---
But a lot of the endgame makes them a necessity.
---
I mean, if you're camping out and blowing everything away before anybody else can get hitsies it's essentially stealing, yeah. Like, socially, you know? You can do it, it's allowed in the game (obviously) but that doesn't make it not the knowing action of a human who decides it's fun to make it so other people can't enjoy the game in the same way that they themselves are enjoying (getting chances at legendary loot).
---
Nuked burrows doesn’t seem to give you rads, but still swaps the enemies to glowing ones ... handy if you are non PA for farming.
---
I'm lucky if I get one daily when I log in. Have only ever had the vox syringer "daily" once. Per toon.
---
No, not under any impression at all. I know exactly down to the lines of code how these things work.
---
yeah I figured it might be so.
---
Yeah one of my characters has her camp there ...
---
I did indeed. My bad.
---
Well, the more you know, . . . Thanks for clarification on the cargobot. TIL.
---
Ah, nice, can you copy paste those exact lines of code that are used in the game then so we can see why the logic that applies to ammo cannot possibly be applied to junk?
---
if you have caps this one dude was (and probably still is) charging to go through a silo with you, for me he did basically all the work, but I still had fun they are [r/SolsticeVII](https://www.reddit.com/user/SolsticeVII)
---
It’s frustrating when you die and people take your shit.  Been there done that.  But it’s part of the game.  If I am going into an area I think may be hostile I always dump my stuff first.  
---
I think the bigger issue is people that participate in events that really aren’t there to help but instead looking to make some easy XP or gain loot off the backs of others.  Nothing annoys me more than a low level at the SBQ fight that isn’t doing anything other than sponging off of kills that are coming from others.  That’s weak.  Either participate and do your part or GTFO
---
Am anxious to try this. Will not have time to until this weekend unfortunately.
---
Good writing. Bethesda will gift you +50 Atoms for your loyalty. You can spend those Atoms and buy a new emote when it is in discount.
---
There is some asshat, I forget his name over level 100 that likes to do this at WS all the time. He will hit you to break your control over the vendor bot so he can jump in front of you. What a douche move....
---
Its true im the strong
---
Had to be there on the first day. Only way is if they decide to release it again, and doesn't look like that's gonna happen. Sorry. I'll keep my eyes out though it this changes!
---
I would be worried :)
---
How do you manage to have 7rad/sec without Hazmat or PA? I'm running trapper armor fully upgraded with two +25 rad resist legendary effect, as well as the lead lined mod on everything but torso (as I can't find the plan), marine undarmor tier 3, Pararad (+300), Nuka Orange with Cola Nut card (+75), Glowing Blood Pack (+75), Rad Resist card maxed out and I got 12rad/sec. I'm looking for Lead Champagne atm but that's a pain in the ass to get the plan.
---
Btw, I still manage to survive heavily relying on RadAway so 7rad/s shouldn't be an issue.
---
I'm just jelly
---
Admittedly I can only come to conclusions with that. I've never had a chance to talk to someone hunting me when I was visible. And now that player kills are the basis for visibility on the map, I probably won't have the opportunity.
---
😂😂 all good. Happens to us all!
---
The DEVs should make any camp setup in that area open game to be attacked without any penalty. I have plenty of artillery and orbital strike grenades ready.....
---
NCR Ranger Armor is modified pre-war Riot Gear.
---
They could implement an "A.P.D" (Appalachian Police Department) version of the Riot Gear, with the background lore being that riot/military police were equipped with it in their effort to combat civil unrest from automation.
---
I got it up to 600. I added the speedy barrel and have a two star vampire that has increased firing rate, plus I found something else I used one to get to 700. - that was pretty awesome. Between that and my vampire combat shotgun, I do pretty ok.
---
No idea. Floor decorations. And it should be there!
---
Same exact thing happened to me on my first attempt. Some other dude waltzed in, refused my party invite, and then launched the nuke while I was trying to look up the codes on my phone. Thanks for nothing, idiot.
---
I mean seriously, why do this? Just accept the damn party invite and then I get credit for it. It's not that hard not to be a dick.
---
I've since launched dozens of nukes so I'm not salty - certainly didn't make me want to stop playing. But this post is funny - apparently it happens a lot.
---
People are speculating. I'll assume that won't happen, but would be hilarious if one hatches per egg. I've seen people with so many down in their bases 😂
---
Who cares, so over that whole thing... Time to move on....
---
I think the % is closer to 50-50 on good suggestions and ideas, general concerns and questions. With the other being negative. It feels like 80% because people either downvote anything positive or gets removed due to reasons.
---
thanks for the offer, I'm just gonna chill off it for a bit, inlaws are coming soon too :) might try solo again tomorrow who knows!
---
Fri rather
---
Same. I can take anything the wasteland throws at me and multiples at same time. 
---
Best was lvl86 SB, lvl 60+ SB and and another level 60+ SB at same time. Cost me ton of ammo and stimpaks, but I won and got three pieces of SB meat for my troubles.
---
But two Mirelurk Kings at one time, no thanks. I try to avoid even one King at all times. Just today found five Kings at same location roaming. Luckily was sneaking and did quick 180 and got the heck out of there.

thanks man but im on pc. ill try again when im in the mood :)

They've not been working right for months. I had idle explosives come up on one char on tuesday and got excited that they were finally fixed but jumped on a different char to redo and got nothing.
---
I have the same exact mug ... How the hell do you drink hot stuff out of it?! Can't hold it unless you have at least 65% fire resistance

We? As in a royal we, your highness? Everyone else understands this. The devs have explained this in detail several times when stash space have been discussed. They have gone into detail here on why they have had to increase the stash space little by little. There is no we. This is widely understood.
---
Thanks for all the stories guys. Now I know to prepare the nuke code first. I'll give it another shot when I'm ready!
---
I am a little, now.
---
You should not play videogames.
---
Old Gatling guns did have sights, but they were mounted on tripods.
---
But if you run into the university before the nuke drops, they won’t be glowing ones even if you exit and come back.
---
This is where I found mine too
---
Weelllll fudge, fair enough thank you ☺ much appreciated.
---
I did notice that a lot of people are confusing the video of new underground areas with the burrows I saw at leas 4 underground areas in that video and only one was of burrows other 3 were vaults and I think the confusion lead to some hype 
---
also was playing last night and me and friends saw 2 rubble areas that we could see a area behind it with loot and enemies means really they plan to expand it or there is a way around them - which personally I would love the burrows to keep getting upgraded every few months add a new section to explore and some lore till it really becomes a massive underground maze
---
Im really glad to see these reports.  Really hoping it was just running a bit off at first.   
---
My friend and i were the first into the burrows on our server (we had like 10 people on our discord actively combing Harpers for the Manhole covers. Unless were totally oblivious they weren't there one pass through but were on the next. Which is pretty interesting to me in terms of capabilities of their engine to handle a live change like this) came back a bit later, and found similar mobs spawning. Gonna see if i can talk my group into nuking it. Ill record my run and the data on legendaries vs normal mobs and their drops.  
---
We ran into \~30 total ghouls between my friend and I.  Was sorely disappointing. The squishiest person in our group (level 40 PA rifleman build) smashed through it solo while naked and melee. Cost her about a dozen stimpaks and radaway. but she cleared it pretty quickly (about 20 min, though she did have directions from the rest of the discord.)
---
That's...actually not a bad idea tbh
---
But then cue *some* people (YOU KNOW WHO YOU ARE) screaming that Bethesda is once again retconning lore
---
If you want an accelerated fire rate, just use the Minigun.
---
same cloths.  
---
same glasses  
---
same wife.  
---
except the hat, only difference is the hat irl.
---
It's not me in the video, and also I know I was going to get some typical response from a bunch of beta a-class males that doesn't think there's any wrong with being a griefer/asshole online.
---
So its part of the game being an asshole? There's survival for that y'know, and we aint in survival.
---
Or find useful, like resource extractors in workshops.
---
Which one of you is the filthy Synth?
---
Something needs to be done. I get it it’s probably like that for reasons. But it’s not cool.  
---
Either the launch room needs to be put on lockdown when prepping the launch crew as it would be in real life? (Someone can confirm or deny that for me, not my field of expertise) 
---
Or make it so “teams” get priority on the launch.
---
Dont die with stuff and you wont lose anything. Pro Tip: Don't do Sheepsquatch in Survival Mode. \*pretty obvious smile\*
---
Shit I don't either. Must have really made people mad by implying they don't read
---
Yw. Sorry tho :(
---
Thats a possibility. This guy was the king of inane comments. I forget his username but im sure he's still out there narrating the wasteland. Probably still in his tighty whities and still waaaaay undergunned.
---
Things that are allowed are not classified as stealing, it is the stuff that is not allowed that are classified as stealing in society. So, it is obviously not stealing. Is it a dick move? Possibly. But the kill belongs to whoever kills. Sad but true. Sure, it is nice if everyone gets a chance, but there is tons of reason why people not wait for everyone, including not having the staying power to wait (glass cannon build), the time (have to rush through, need to pick up the kids soon) or maybe just didn't know anyone else was in the same area.
---
Thanks!
---
you said it, camps will SOON be invulnerable, when will they? when they add the camera? when they fix the bugs? when they fix the mods? The queen? etc, Bethesda's SOON takes us several months.
---
Also if you kept being targeted EVERYDAY by the same griefers, would you keep on hopping the server even though they can find you by doing the same? Exactly.
---
stupid logic there buddy.
---
Screen-filling ad? What on the start menu, the news page? You do know you can dismiss it with a single button press?
---
One has “more” penetration.
---
Which one?
---
Piercing (improved reaload speed, armor penetration)
---
 Stinging (improved armor penetration, ammo capacity)
---
Don’t nuke swarm of suitors event then because instead of spawning at the manageable 20-30 range they’ll all be 58+
---
its real a guy found it in the files and had it overite the default deathclaw model (because they use the same animation bones) you can find its back quils on dead brahmin in a random encounter and the new side mission
---
I am having same issue ... in theory I have 2 eggs now but don't see them in the build menu and don't even see the dearhclaw statue. Surely we don't need to buy the statue first in order to see the other things. That is fine as I want it but would be an odd strategy.
---
Do you know how much Ammo Stinging has?
---
Clothing- Traveling Leather Coat / Assault Gas Mask
---
I agree, lockdown sounds good, makes it a gauntlet type event too
---
Hi
---
Pros:
---
\-wonderfull, big map
---
\-Crafting and Building system an enhancement over FO4
---
\-still bugs, but nothing game-breaking like in FO4 (I'd say it is almost less buggy and FO4)
---
\-exploring, looting, shooting and building is very fun
---
\-very friendly players (in adventure mode)
---
\-surival elements are easier than in FO4, i personally like it very much
---
Cons:
---
\-story is boring and not very priority
---
\-less story content than in FO4
---
\-bethesda will most probably implement pay-to-win things very soon, and it is not sure how that will impact the game balance in the long run
---
\-You have no decissions and our doing will not change an ounce to game world. Therefore this is more sandbox and less of a campaign. 
---
Conclusion: If you liked exploring, crafting, building and shooting in FO4 you will probably have a lot of fun. If the story, descisions, NPC where important for you, than you will find this game boring very soon. 
---
But anyway, for 25 bucks you could threat this as a standalone Add-on for FO4. Or you just wait, i guess this game will be free-to-play anyway by the end of the year....
---
The inability to use or apply mods is mind boggling to me.  It’s almost as bad as the glitch that had people auto scrapping bulk items. 
---
Not to mention the update to the benches and repairs. I mean, it worked fine.  Now it’s confusing and annoying.
---
It's OK ☺
---
Use makeshift warrior / gunsmith
---
Guys...I was there in the Vault with all of you! You guys know me right? I'm not a synth!
---
guess that's my first mission
---
im 99% sure that the underground area being nukable is intended. it's how you convert it into an end game area.
---
hes refering to the imposter sheepsquatch the image is the real ones model rigged to override the default deathclaw model because they use the same skeleton
---
Gunslinger and all pistol based perks. And bloody mess for that oomph. 
---
Single action revolver, or western. And either the cowboy outfit. Or the western outfit from the atomic shot with the assault gas mask.
---
You are approached by a frenzied scientist, who yells, "I'm going to put my quantum harmonizer in your photonic resonation chamber!" What's your response? 
---
1. I'd say "Up yours, too, buddy." 
---
2. I'd grab a pipe and knock him out. 
---
3. I'd slip away before he finishes. 
---
4. I wouldn't worry, if he did that it'd cause a parabolic destabilization of the fission singularity.
---
Can you retrieve this post please?
---
that's the 2nd mission
---
I really hope so, I put them all over the place in Fo4
---
Getting TSE aint hard. In online gaming world getting TSE is on very entry level difficulty to dungeons. Its a basically on level of gear what you get from normal dungeons, before you head to veteran dungeons. 
---
If you have the caps, it takes 2-3 days to find seller. And getting caps aint that hard, specially now that you have 1 pool of 1400 instead of 7 pools of 200. That is basically what, 10 days of getting caps only selling items to vendor and 2-3 days finding the seller, 13 days to get TSE. That is nothing.
---
I just rebooted and it appeared along with the deathclaw statue
---
I'm only lvl 59 now I believe, just now starting to use other PA that isn't excavator, because weight. also heavy guns with weight perks. but I've always tried to throw whatever helping hands I can to any lower levels I see. I don't generally accept team invites from strangers from all I've heard of griefers, but I'm guessing that isn't as big of an issue as it once was. my water purifiers always stay unlocked, and I keep some crops... I've really just now started having an easier time with the game, had plenty of help from random high levels, and always try to do whatever I can with ppl starting out. I think it's a great game, always loved fallout, there's things I think are dumb, but in all I don't think it's a bad way to spend my time
---
I see your point about complaints calling attention to issues that either need to be addressed(bugs/glitches) or at least should be looked into(heavy weapons feeling underpowered). There is a point where repeating the same thing accomplishes nothing.  
---
Obviously the time has passed now so I cant prove this:  upon getting out of work at 7am the Friday morning after the repair kits were mentioned I sorted this sub by top posts in the past day and by my count 48 of the top 50 and  91 or 92 of the top 100 posts were about repair kits.  All we as the playerbase knew were the 3 paragraphs in the ItV post.  I agree with the negative sentiment the posts were conveying and dont like repair kits being in the atom shop but dont think there are 48 unique takes to be made on the topic.
---
Ya that’s understandable I’m trying to be conservative with my expectations as well and I’m trying to keep them low Bc I don’t have a lot of faith in Beth.
---
I don’t know how it is in real life but Hollywood seems to think that’s how it goes.  But yeah a lockdown on the launch room is needed. If you aren’t there or part of the team. Sorry.
---
Keep in mind the single action has only two mods for it the ivory grip and the prime receiver
---
I drop all my junk in a Stash or just drop it where I am if not near one.  I'd rather lose it to a random player out in the world than those looting bags at the event.
---
I’d love to have all the eggs combine into a boss spawn egg for an Easter event.
---
I have no idea why Mistiq is getting downvoted.  I mean, I enjoy the game but there are some serious misses and glitches that are happening today. 
---
The rate loss for food and water is ridiculous.  Something changed and they either won’t admit it or it was a stealth nerf or both. 
---
Not being able to apply mods -with no hotfix on the way- it’s an absolute joke. 
---
Rolling out Survival with spawn killing glitches and then fixing it but with overnerfs on cap loss.   Why?
---
Thing is different mods can increase or decrease a weapons durability, legendary or normal. It would make sense that melee weapons being the type of weapon they are, will breakdown faster. If that applies in game I have not investigated. Weapons like the gatling plasma and laser breakdown fast, to me to reflect the nature of the weapons as they'd require regular servicing to jepo operational if they were real. Explosive weapons just by the sheer explosive nature break down fast too. 
---
So you have the perk card that reduces the weapon wear damage? I have that and it helps a lot coupled with the repair to 200%.
---
My wife has a Furious Mr Handy Buzz Blade and it shreds things
---
If this offer is for anyone Id love to meet up and buy one of those spares from you. I wont be online for about 10-11 hours though.
---
Is hitting him in the face with my trusty Super Sledge, Faceflattener 2.0, an option?
---
THIS! I don't, but I did it on destiny 1 with sniper rifles
---
Just to the West if the cabin there’s a nice patch of black titanium that you can park an extractor over.
---
That'd be awesome like a Deathclaw Voltron
---
Nah, it’s not really said that the crows are spying on you, people just speculated that based on stuff I don’t really want to tell you in case of spoilers
---
what do you think is the max damage possible from it?
---
We already have one annoying robot.
---
More likely a porcupine. The things on hedgehogs are called spines and they don't generally detach like a porcupine's quills.
---
Honestly I couldn’t tell you. Head over to nukes and dragons and plot or a build and see what all the pistol perks add together for damage and look up the single action and see what it deals for the total.
---
Don’t feel bad, I left on vacation Monday so I don’t even know what the eggs are all about yet. Oh well.
---
More free atoms?
---
I wonder what a MIRV mod would do to a two-shot Fat Man Launcher... *PogChamp*
---
If you’ve seen a post I had made earlier, then you’d already know that I’m terrified.
---
when I have the time, i'll math it out, thanks 👍
---
Shut up
---
Not bad but I'm good. My Camp is near Vault 76 and the wood mill for new and long time players when player vending comes out.
---
Lmao
---
Yes Ive also been having this issue
---
you can hear the sound of you hitting the enemy, but no damage registers, usually its the 2nd or 3rd hit that finally hits
---
very frustrating!
---
Np. I just don’t want give to completely off info.
---
Who can say no to free crap? 
---
If someone gets butthurt over virtual JUNK then that's even better.
---
Comedic relief, n all that.
---
Kinda reminds me of the event where everyone tried to nuke at every fissure site to end the scorch for good
---
People that have logged in not everybody
---
If you put a pressure plate and a Tesla coil down before the chair you can slide it on top just enough to trigger the pressure plate when you sit, aka working electric chair :)
---
Vacation ??? Why wasn't i invited?  Where did you go?
---
You're a fucking modder dude. Not a game developer.
---
Armchair dev.
---
I have yet to play star dew valley. Sounds wild.
---
I was going to say that but I couldn't think of the name, so I just went with hedgehog, but I can see it having quills on its back
---
Honestly the overreach in Survival on correcting cap loss basically ensured that there’s no incentive for a new or lower level player to enter and play.  Since there no real penalty for dying it will just enhance more of the one shot crew and cheese techniques.  I see less and less people in Survival Mode now as compared to a few weeks ago. 
---
Not to say the cap correction wasn’t needed, but they went from one extreme to the other. I would have been fine with losing 100% of my caps upon death.  But now only 25%?   As a higher level player, what’s my incentive to hunt and collect?  Not as much, and it could have been solved with a reasonable adjustment.
---
Lol I missed that one. I'm usually only on here at work because this reddit is awesome and work sucks
---
ahh, point being, the combat shotgun this replaced,would break eventually,as they do.
---
but the legend hase lost110% after max,40 rounds and i've got all 5 in gunsmith.
---
so. my  question is - do *ALL* legendarys have a faster rate of deteriation**.** if their all as bad as this....well she-ite.
---
I got something similar from The Burrows today. 3* Furious Lead Pipe, same secondary effect but something else I can't remember for the 3rd.
---
Same children
---
Same Parents
---
Same siblings
---
Tomorrow (Friday) I have a day off from work, I’m planning to launch a nuke on the Burrows.
---
I’m a level 136 (I think?). So anyone who’s up for it, contact me (airceu)
---
Note: I’m in the CET (Central European Time) timezone
---
I can agree, only I’m in high school.
---
I stopped going in nuke zones over two months ago and am having more fun than ever doing anything I can think of, my friends and I have been messing around with flying and built and “airport” yesterday haha
---
I have lost so many hand mades this way it is not even funny. This has to be fixed ASAP! This is ridiculous and so unfair!
---
I don’t feel to bad about missing them for a fun trip to New Orleans. I do feel bad after my 3rd night ending on bourbon st.
---
i only noticed this int he last month after playing my melee character for over 4 months now
---
What!  You mean they've nerfed stealth *again*!  Fire up the youtube outrage engine!  /s
---
The OP is a synth confirmed. Now bring him to the sewers where he will be electrocuted
---
So is that mutation worth it?
---
I did it for the first time last night. There were maybe 10 ghouls in the whole place and a few Gutsy’s...not one a legendary. I was disappointed with that. Other than that I thought it was a nice little dungeon. I’ll go back again and hopefully there will be some legendaries.
---
but wheres the plans? OwO
---
It's clear you don't have a use for any further legendaries since you've said you already have 8 TSE.  
---
What more could you possibly want at that point.
---
Thanks friend. I've been recording everything. Hopefully I'll get a judge that sees 50/50 as the default. Supposedly there's quite a big movement towards that, which is great. A child deserves both parents.
---
A lot of commenters have already talked about how to get the most lead using mining and such. But regarding CAMP vs workshop, it depends.
---
1. Are your lead needs long term?
---
2. How constant are they?
---
3. Are you planning on farming lead over an extended period of time? 
---
4. Will your length play sessions over that period provide enough lead to justify the cost of taking and holding a worshop for that session? Or the cost of building up a workshop for every new play session?
---
5. Are there other resource nodules that would provide more value over an extended period and multiple play sessions without your intervention?
---
Answering these questions should provide you with a pretty good idea.
---
did it help once you deleted the save file?
---
I’m lvl 15 and I’m leveling alt too
---
Can I add U? I’m playing for now, so maybe I can leech some of ur xp ;)
---
I went down alone 2 days ago when nobody else was nearby and probably killed at least 4 dozen ghouls in swarms of 5 or 6. I've experienced it with other players around and it's underwhelming I agree. It would be cool if number of ghouls spawned was based on players present in the cell.
---
&gt;''Nobody said it would be instanced'' is also not an excuse for such a frankly stupid mistake on their part
---
  
---
that's where OP totally lost me and went full fanboy
---
Love that it is nukable.  I got so much flux and mats to make it stable as everyone went running for the Burrows and left the enemies and flux alone. Keep it up guys
---
yes EST
---
after the jumpscare in the new sidequest i wouldn't put it past them...
---
Yeah note to a lot of high levels.
---
Please be curtious in general, you don't always need to show off and kill the enemies for the low levels. They can do that themselfs with some effort and actually gain XP.
---
You know nothing Shadow Moon.
---
Why you guys getting thumbs down ? I got you guys with karma plus plus plus
---
That has nothing to do with the serum. It's a bug with Class Freak itself and also affects Empath.
---
No ETA on a fix. It's been mentioned here numerous times, but there has never been any comment on it from the Bethesda staff that visit this sub. Really odd thing is that they've fixed other bugs associated with Class Freak, but have left this one untouched.
---
I agree with 90% of what you wrote here. I didn't want to just repeat what you said, so I'm adding my 2 cents here, not to argue, but to add the 10% where I differ.
---
\- While it has a less story elements, I do actually like most of the stories it does have, even if they're just told through holotapes and terminals. But I definitely understand that this is incredibly subjective.
---
\- The one odd thing for me is how many places there are that appear free of almost any content whatsoever, yet they're discoverable locations on the map. Examples of this are some of the testing sites down in the Ash Heap. No enemies, nothing notable to loot, just nothing. Maybe they're places for future content, but it seems unlikely.
---
It almost seems that these types of places are simply waypoints.
---
this is starting to turn into a synth plot or a bad porn plot
---
I live in a van down by the river
---
I actually thought mama deathclaw is going to come and take revenge
---
We should hang out and throw rocks at things
---
Kill everything
---
Yeah, I accidentally grabbed the wrong bag because someone evidently died in about the same place I was and it was pretty chaotic, but I thought it was weird when there wasn't much in it. I think it was all good, though, because they got mine and I had screws and adhesive I'd forgotten to ditch before coming to the event. Wasn't too worried about them, I've got more than I should have in my stash already but I can't help but pick them up.   
---
Anyone else feel like this game is turning them into a hoarder?
---
chill winston! you are getting WAY to upset over a video game
---
Dope I'll try and be there
---
Yup all these things should had been available at release
---
Was the queen scorched as I can kill the normal one no problem but the scorched one is a pain and seemed to take little or no damage when shot at.
---
4 to 5 days seems a bit excessive if you are talking about anything beyond the main quest.  I do think Bethesda underestimated the time it takes to go 0 to nuke.  I think they were surprised someone pulled it off in the BETA.  However, there is a whole lot of story in this game to discover.  And it's good story! The Personal Matters quest is pure West Virginia, almost like it was written by a native. 
---
But this goes back to what I said earlier:  just because it isn't fun for you doesn't mean it isn't fun.  The camp is useless unless you like building.  Judging by the YouTube videos a lot of people enjoy that. Some people like the social features of the game.  Some people like getting lost in a virtual WV. And some people like killing players.
---

---
I get it, you don't like 76.  76 does have issues, especially with end game content and bugs.  And the looming specter of atom purchasable repair kits might sour me on this game yet. However, many of us find it to be a worthwhile fun game, because people all like different things.

---
Probably another bug that has yet to be fixed.
---
Pretty much.  I’m hoping for the best but expecting the worst.  I think the concept is fantastic but will hold off my optimism until I see it.
---
Right here! I'm selling a plan for 2k.
---
Yeah attaching mods to your gear is kinda a big thing to be missing for this long, I’ve had 2 Cali shocks ready to go for my x-01 but Beth seem happy enough sitting around with their cocks in their hands.
---
I think it’s painfully simple too, it must be tied to the changed UI of the benches, where 2 menus are required now for repairs instead of 1, I think fudging with the UI has borked attaching mods, I don’t think anything worse has happened.
---
I hope.
---
This doesn't have near enough upvotes.
---
Hey I could use another maybe 1000 plasma guns, gotta learn those mods.
---
Another mindless white springs nuke grind? This is fun to you huh? Guess that's all Bethesda can realistically do in fallout76 anything else would take actual effort to create. I can't wait to see vault "raids" Not getting hyped up for that like I did for burrows that's for sure.
---
I feel your pain, I can't even imagine why this wasn't fixed on the Thursday "maintenance"  following the broken patch on Tuesday, wtf Bugthesda!
---
My second nuke around LVL 48 I think, had some guy, 200+, show up during the final room fight. Thought he was there to do the same, but he died and J was out of stimpacks. Oops.
---
Ran into him yesterday east of the South Mountain Lookout.  I took a couple shots at him and he got behind some rocks and disappeared (as he is wont to do).  And he never reappeared.
---
Oddly, I was using a recon scope, so I had the marker for him, and the marker was still there, but even when I walked right up to the location where the marker was, he wasn't there.  I've seen that with a couple other mobs, they either go completely incorporeal or phase down into the terrain, not sure which.
---
Under Armour.  
---
The upgrades for the Enclave Under Armour are the best in the game.
---
thats awesome lol  i ran into mine once too, kinda weird both farming for Miner gauntlets, we both had the greaser outfits, camps both along the same stretch of river, both 2 stories with very similar layout.  I am pretty sure he is the synth.
---
I can run FO76 by using my phone as a wifi hotspot and connecting the xbox. Not ideal but good enough to hit up the atom shop for the easter eggs. 😁
---
this ones nowt special , 50% damage if target less than 40%. otherwise exactly the same as the non legend.
---
kind of worried as also picked up a quad capacity gauss,and cost a ton of resources to mod up,so if thats going to break after a couple of clips....... well,I did alright without any legendarys up to now.
---
Genius
---
I got the bundle for my character (who honestly looks like Kellogg). It is just funny to see this battle-hardened looking individual just sitting around a rustic themed brick cottage with a bunny plushie, painted deathclaw eggs, and little potted plants. But like all things it can just be written into the character, like it was their old toy from the vault, a last keepsake of their childhood or something like that.
---
Too bad Last Laugh probably wouldn't work.  Die, someone grabs your bag and blows up.
---
I’m level 121 and I hit Westec, Watoga, Top of The World, Blackwater Mine, Glassed Cavern, Harper’s Ferry, then I go to the fissure sites. Also hit as many events as you can and take over workshops. I play in a group about half the time. The rest I’m running around by myself just leveling up.
---
I thought you knew the exact details though.  Why don't you want to share them with me?
---
I was cruising along until a mob of ten crispy ghouls came running in and attacked me.  As I was firing away, some dude in a skeleton costume came running in along with the last two ghouls and took a couple of rounds of friendly fire.   Not being pleased, he attacked me with some kind of modded sword while I was finishing off the last of the ghouls . . . I'm dead and respawning back at the manhole.
---
On Monday I received a team invite from a random, and as always I look to see where they are, and saw a lvl 53 and 37 at Site Charlie, so in previous cases of such requests it means an impending Nuke Launch at Prime, so I was thinking that they wanted help from a lvl 85 that will help them take down the queen (Which I'm not spec'd to do at all, but I can "help") so I head off back to CAMP to get geared up.
---
10 minutes later, they are still at Charlie, no Nuke launched. At this point I realise that they need help getting through the Silo, thinking "How hard can it be?" (I've never launched a nuke yet) I FT down to help them. I get in, work out how to get through the first gird, and meet up with the Inviter, only to find that this a 2 people trying to do this solo..... Both of whom it seemed, thought I knew how to get through the Silo, so I march around killing things and solving problems (The pipes took two attempts, missed the last one by 3 secs), and get them to the control room.
---
We wait around for the Chiefs to get in to position, with a Single Eyebot making an appearance.
---
Mr 53, goes to the Launch panel - Gets told he needs to swipe the key card, key card gets swiped
---
goes to the Launch Panel - Gets told to enter the code - Enters code
---
Gets the Code wrong.
---
I send message - You only get one attempt per key card.
---
Reply - \*Crying\* oh no
---
Me - Wasted Journey, All good though, Better luck next time
---
Reply - Thanks for your help ... Im sad lol
---
And thats how I failed someone elses 1st nuke run. 
---
Not sure if 37 managed to launch but he swiped his card while 53 was doing his thing, becuase I headed back to CAMP and logged off,
---
for the past couple of weeks, the Enclave bunker has been picked clean in every server ):
---
well if you have Xbox and you do get another (so long as its not initiate) Ill definitely trade or buy it from you for a really good price

Not that I'm aware of. I have a 3 star Gauss rifle which is my main weapon. It has pretty astonishing durability but even then after a long battle with no change in weapon, it will be in need if repair even with the repair and durability perk cards maxed out. It is much improved from when I first got it but while it does have some less than ideal mods, I have a reflex scope instead of a long scope, no shielding, I opted for what gives me a balance of useful aids and durability. It breaks down but I keep mine in good condition at every opportunity so I don't get drastically caught out.
---
It does correctly save though. It never didn’t, at least not for me. Ever since day one I’ve had my weapons organised from weakest to strongest, then Rafael and diluted radaway, then Chen’s from best to worst. Never changed.
---
Nice, I'm hoping she does. I love fighting them I'm hoping it's an OP one I like a challange.
---
I was responding to the idea of camping the spawns as being "stealing" and I'll stand by that. If you're camping and blasting everything away, repeatedly, you're going to have some idea that your play style is impacting other players in the area.
---
FOUND THE DUPER!
---
Different hats, doesn't count
---
The four poster bed needs to be bigger too. Bought it thinking itd be a queen sized bed, and it ended up being a double. Lol.  It looks so tiny and out of place.
---
Player vending is why I’m over that titanium patch. My only problem now is I’m out of acid
---
you on pc? If so I have a team that takes 1st-time nukers through and lets them launch it, we supply decrypted codes and nuclear keycards if needed.
---
I figured as much (this isn't Elder Scrolls after all), but there really are a lot of them crows. They're literly everywhere in the game. Can't turn your head in any direction outside without seeing one, and they like to get in the way too, like when you're trynna snipe and they fly right in front of your bullet. I'm just glad VATS doesn't target them or I'd never get a hit in, LoL.
---
Have you tried running around the south of the savage divide? West of insane asylum but east of missile silo Charlie.
---
Or the reservoir in toxic valley, you’ll have to be very high level because normally only normal mirelurker spawn but if your level 100+ the game might spawn a king instead. 
---
Remember to kill every encounter that isn’t what you need because it a) reset the area for another random encounter and b) doesn’t grief other no so high level players with high level mobs.
---
Had the same thing happen with 2 friends.   We spent 2 hours cleaning out the place, some guy waits to the end and "boop" launches.
---
No reward.  Whatsoever.
---
He bombed the bog and we followed him there after and he just tosses a thumbs up emote.
---
That was the last game they wanted to play before moving into Red Dead online, they were done with it.
---
Really needs fixed...
---
What platform
---
Same thing happened to me this morning.
---
Someone explained why this is a while back. It's something like PA and radiation suits have the rad resist numbers you see _after_ ignoring some percent of radiation. Or something like that.  You could probably dig it up with Google.
---
Cats are the mass murderers of the animal world. If a house cat survived the apocalypse, you better believe that that thing would kill you in a heartbeat
---
Rename them and it fixes it or least it did for me.
---
*waves at you in blackbird painted Power armor*
---
maybe well get a tamed widdle baby deathclaw to hang at our CAMPS
---
I had a bunch of strange happenings in my last session. this was one of them.
---
XB1?
---
I launched nukes there twice last night, both times when I arrived after repairing gear, the place was full of players spawn camping . Kept hearing shots around every corner , never got any ghouls. So I went back top side to harpers ferry. Omg the violet flux , everywhere. I made 5000 ultracite ammo for my Gatling gun in just a few minutes. I will be nuking it regularly now just for the flux.
---
Then that needs to be shown on the stats page or somewhere.
---
Or course :) psn manny_0317
---
Happens to me a bit...I just leave it a min or two, leave and go back in. This seems to fix it for me
---
Yeah I think you have to pay him with pre war money
---
Wow !!
---
That's super long haha but awesome glad you're still having fun !!!  I don't think there is a way to check how many hours on ps4 ? :(
---
What I've found is that it's gone from never working to inconsistently working.  Some have suggested using the rename feature to rename the item so you don't have two of the same thing, but again, it doesn't always stick.
---
Eventually, I just got to the point where I found a better item than one of the two and swapped it out.
---
I've been telling players that whenever the event pops-up. We also have the conduits hide on the roof between the roof and the ceiling with a guy ready to heal them should they go down. Only backfired once when they got sniped by the laser through the floor.
---
lol kinda happened to my friend once
---
So running PA and a combo of the Blade of Bastet with incisor and the melee bonuses should do it?
---
I think it would a funnier name as "the Furry Beaver" kinda NSFW heheeh
---
Same here they say theirs one everyday but it only shows me the 1st one i got
---
But, close down the game &amp; try again - worked for my son when he couldn't see it
---
Well in the lore of before fallout 4 all cats were eaten to extinction. Bethesda changed it though.
---
It's in the little gazebo next to the tennis courts.  There's a drinking water fountain connected to the circular wall.  Drink from that to cure yourself.  You can even drink inside your power armor.  I'll see if I can find a pic.
---
Sounds like you kneed some money.
---
Did you stop the game running or just exit and re-enter?
---
ALSO i think many people forget, alot of the "low levels" you see running around could be high level players alt characters, i have 5 total characters i play with
---
It’s under the power armor/deathclaw statue in floor decor
---
I have a lot of duplicate plans. If you’re on Xbox, I get on during the week between 8-8:30 pm EST. I’m BadWolfSat5.  I’d be happy to pass on any of my plans you don’t have.
---
Trying that now! Thank you!
---
Thank you so much for kind offer but I’m on playstion really appreciate it though
---
Worked! Hero!
---
The animal friend perk gives you a nice little square sight
---
I think when I did it first time, I died about 4 times and had to run through again and again.
---
Took about 1.5 hours to figure out everything and fight everything with all the respawning Gutsy,
---
I mean, i see plenty of tse or bloodied get one smacked by her.. the Cryolator probably just makes it safer for the group as a whole. It would be super easy if she couldn't hit back.
---
You can't watch a video by they should watch yours?
---
A friend I play with has his wired up with Tesla arcs..it’s awesome!!
---
Pretty much the story of my first launch, high level charged in and took it. Worst part was we did all the work getting to the final room and he marathon-runner/speed-demons his way into the final room as we are defending the robots and hops on the terminal as it ends.
---
Us (2018)
---
I agree it is very confusing.
---
I want to say I got one from defending a workshop but can’t say for 100% that’s true.
---
It’s nice to hear somebody knows the pain of hunting the rare mods. 
---
To be honest I’ve no idea whether it was scrapped, dropped or missing due to a bug. All parts were on the chassis in my inventory and have been since I first crafted it. I don’t know why favourited items aren’t blocked entirely from dropping or scrapping. 
---
I’m partly in the mindset to take a break until the game is in better shape at this point as I’m still salty about it.
---
Got mine claming workshops and defending them ...
---
&gt; a bunch of butt-hurt, entitled bullshit. It’s not productive and no one is going to implement a two sentence idea buried in an 8 page disposition on why instanced loot is good in your favorite MMO from ten years ago. 
---
that's you btw.
---
ill buy em all for about tree fiddy
---
Not just you.  I've noticed this too and it's really frustrating.  I use VATS to target erratic enemies like mole rats and bugs, and often I'll hit them 2+ times with 0 damage before they explode on the 3rd or 4th hit.
---
I've found them in that menu. I mean there's no new egg for me to claim in the Atomic Shop. Sorry for the confusion!
---
I doubt it. As I mentioned in another reply, my Gauss rifles are my main weapons because they have been so reliable. Sure they aren't the TSE weapons everybody seems to worship but they have proved to me to be reliable, durable and do decent damage with the right mix of mods and perks to optimise it. I have never used it so much that it broke down in quite some time.
---
Well that's a bummer... Guess I'll focus on other games until they fix this issue.
---
I nuked it a few times on different servers last night . The results are not consistent. The first time it was full of players as I went through the silo and dropped it. When I arrived it was me and a few players wandering looking for ghouls for about an hour. It seemed to have bugged . Maybe because it had people there when they were supposed to change to glowing ones. The next runs where better. At least some glowing ones spawned , although I wasn't fast enough to keep up with the ghoul hunting group.
---
Yeah I was thinking the same thing, haha. Thanks though!
---
I mean, it's not your fault.  Grognak's Axe is one of those things that fell through the cracks, much like the Railway Rifle.
---
You can easily last half a minute when you skilled right.
---
Oh yeah? Awesome. I guess I know what I'm doing tonight then :P Thanks, man!
---
Had the same problem yesterday. Had to do a full reset of the x box and it updated.  Try unplugging yours for 30 sec and it should reset
---
Lmao you're hilarious. You realize this is exactly why the introduced the survival mode. Smh.
---
Bear Arms reduces it down to two pounds though
---
As far as the moderate to low level enemies go they are probably the biggest threats. Wendiges make me less worried than those kings.
---
It is what you make of it.
---
Your entire defense is "gamers are nerdz, they need to get out more"
---
Well done.
---
Both. I just tried again and it seemed to have worked. I was trying right at the rollover last night, so maybe that's why nothing was populating for me.
---
Actually already suggested this in my farming overhaul thoughts lol, including a firefly pond to spawn them at your camp to float around
---
You'll get a mothy old Rabbit head mascot.
---
I just tried again and it worked! I think I was trying too close to the rollover last night. Gotta learn some patience, I guess.
---
Yeah I don’t think they tested all perks and weapons combinations.
---
On my first run of the event I got a bloodied, faster swing speed, +1 agility lvl 50 bowie knife.
---
A two shot shotgun or dragon only fires one extra pellet rather than double the pellets, ie the dragon fires four rounds at a time so the two shot legendary effect makes it 5, not 8. But the mirv mod on a fat man doesn’t fire the 6 smaller bombs straight away, it fires a regular nuke that splits off. So a two shot mirv fires two nukes which split into... 12 smaller bombs. Hellfire.
---
If you can't actually help by getting a pylon at some point, then don't do the event. Also, I literally said if I WATCHED them die, and knew it was someone who hadn't been actually helping. Or, hell, just standing on the roof the whole damn time.
---
If memory serves me right during the PAX east conference they mentioned there will be the return of the bobble head display cases, mannequins, weapon display boards, heavy weapon display stands, and power armor displays. But I also think they are bundled in with the player vending so if anything estimate for May 7, if not, probably by the time the Purveyor shows up.
---
And yeah, I know how you feel. Honestly it would be nice to get a fireplace so I can hang my favorite hunting rifle and a painting over it.
---
Got shotgun shells?
---
Sounds like your the real cuckboy tbh complaining about others helping others haha you need a hug my dude.
---
YES. I posted a similar thread a few days back.  I can only assume there is some significant hurdle to rotating the gun to align the sight... Like maybe the crank animation will no longer work or maybe the gun's clip will block your view.
---
Either way, I'm tired of whiffing headshots when those damn scorched peek out from cover.
---
I think they only come in double, i had a double .50 cal machine gun, was pretty nice for awhile.
---
Yeah that's what I did when it hit 8:00 last night, got the second egg!
---
Not totally true. It is said at least twice. 
---
Not really a spoiler though. It's more like side info that is easily overlooked. Especially since you cant really do both of those mentions in a single playthrough.
---
Aww man, it's LJT all over again...
---
huh, I have a relatively low level bloodied baseball bat, but I'm not available for trade until this weekend, sorry
---
I would rather fight three Scorchbeasts than three Yao Guai.
---
i do the same,every weapon in 200% before setting out,regardless of the resource cost.
---
I have only had these 2 for a few hrs game time,so i'll soldier on and test this out.
---
cheers.............thanks for input
---
Noticed as well
---
Lore wise, i thought the institute was ahead.
---
squirrels and beavers and possums are also "enemies" even though they don't aggro
---
Old saying...don’t run before you can walk.
---
Perhaps they need to get the walking bit sorted first?
---
Ya as of 2 or 3 updates ago it does, but I have faith in Bethesda bringing back old bugs. I’m not asking you to sell it I wanna join your world sometime and see it in your inventory
---
no, they're not - all depends of the build - I use melee, so BoS is better for me - not only has higher DR for face-to-face combat, but also adds 3 endurance (more HP), while Enclave gives 1STR more, but comes with useless (for my build) Perception.
---
This is how it felt to me.
---
Beth:  "tonight we have a pureed nut spread with a grape relish reduction, served on a brioche bun"
---
Us:  "omg, that sounds so exciting"
---
Beth:  "here you are"
---
US:   "um....this is a PB&amp;J"
---
Why do you think I have one tamed to guard my camp &gt;:3
---
The thing that turned me off is the 'repair mainframe cores' part glitching. I soloed my way to that point.
---
Haven't been back since.
---
Found a brick wall plan in a safe before, but it was some time ago.
---
I thought everyone stashed their stuff beforehand. If you don't you have to accept some responsibility for not doing so.
---
It's a new "feature" lol. Thay will fix it I'm shure. It's the first time that thay tried to do a once a day thing for multiple items, and it uncovered this bug. In the meantime we have a work around. Spread the word everyone!
---
I’ve had two or three encounters where mothman teamed up with a flatwoods monster.
---
Or just make it so there is only 1 biometric card to be found in the entire place.  
---
It repawns when the nuke respawns.      The person with biometric can walk through and push a button that disables the field for 10 seconds to allow party through.  
---
That right there will lock out everyone else.
---
Renaming doesn't work. Already tried.
---
They don't have any proof just regurgitating the same few videos and old blogs over and over. If they actually watched Ox they'd he doesn't promote hate.
---
Especially that pack that hangs out in Toxic Valley.  Five or six had me pinned down inside a turned over bus.
---
 [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7vFGKHzY\_38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7vFGKHzY_38)
---
I build signs for a living, yes you are right those kinds of channel letters ( that's what we call them) do normally flash, although it can be turned off. I was wondering if the power counter could be rig to power it in intervals. I haven't taken the time to figure out all of the advanced power connections yet.
---
They failed everywhere else.  Why would they break their string?
---
There's certain mutations whose negative effects just aren't affected by class freak, which I suspect is by design, otherwise they'd be too powerful.
---
Happened to me too, after logging out and back in it sorted itself out.
---
🤘🏻
---
Your brother by another mother.
---
The song is ironic because none of the examples given are ironic.
---
Did he say "Greetings, Sir."?
---
Possibly an Institute Synth.
---
Even thugs got a softer side haha
---
Nuke the whitespring. Well, now you can nuke the burrows also.
---
Don't be mad, he probably saw you in there for ages and wondered what you were up to. Think of it this way, you saved a nuke card and still got to play in a nuke zone. You'll launch many more nukes in the future, I know it's shitty but think if this as practice. If you're on ps4 I can help you, I'm level 340 but I won't dmsteal your launch :)
---
Well,  more like microwaved but okay.
---
If you are on Xbox I will buy the anti armor fat man from you
---
If you're on PC I can sell you:
---
\- Marine Legs
---
\- Marine Wetsuit
---
and make you Marine Armor Helmet (it's like a plan - you scrap it and learn the plan for it 100%).
---
You’ll piss off more than help.
---
My God... They're multiplying!
---
Na ps4
---
to TRULY power level I'd recommend obtaining/using an instigating weapon and put a few points into the sneak skill
---
then you can go to whitesprings even as a level 20 and 1 shot enemies
---
if you get mobbed, run back to the resort robots and they will help you kill the ghouls, just be sure to tag them once before the sentry bot shreds them
---
but yeah, sneaky sneak and instagating weapons are how i got my new character to lvl 30 in 3 days
---
I have a few bloodied weapons I don't want PM for PSN
---
Not sure I will be able to collect them all as I have been away from home :(
---
You missed the technical data on that.
---
Awesome, thanks. Just wanted to confirm it was possible before asking on the bazaar subreddit, haha. Thanks mate.
---
oh sry! I thought you would go direct for a offer. But like you I love pipe weapon! Haha I see, I could see that too.
---
Whatever bethesda will do it's still a nice weapon with many modification. In future maybe even more mods
---
The sheepsquatch is pretty difficult even for god builds. 
---
I think Bethesda needs to continue to make content for high and low level players. Eventually the low levels will be higher and need tests to challenge themselves and their team.
---
I get it - if all the stars align, then it is easy.
---
Brotherhood here.
---
Can confirm, Institute is gone.
---
Wasnt even a Fight, 10/10 would crush communism again.
---
It’ll be a deathclaw spring striped mask and lvl 30 legendary death Tambo that jingles extra loud when you attack
---
Well we're already on day 2?
---
Yeah its called the deep diver suit im sure
---
You're a smart woman with two kids and your own business. You should form your own opinion instead of taking whatever is given to you at face value.
---
Or how rummaged it has potentially already been. it would be so awesome to sign on one day and know that I was actually experiencing what was intended and not what requires server hopping
---
I did get close the first time with a sneak attack and it still done nothing. i might give the vats a try later see if it makes a difference I feel like it wont change much because of my build but the vats crit shout do it with luck.
---
Yeah I’m flat out of caps.
---
When do the eggs reset? I was on last night after Bivs reset and the egg still wasn't showing.
---
So true, even my buddy who has a raider-inspired chick is collecting teddy bears and those Mr. Fuzzy plushies for when we can decorate with items from our inventory.
---
Yeah that's a dick move. I can easily one shot those Mole Miners in that event but once someone else shows up I switch to a lower tier weapon out of common consideration. No idea why people feel the need to be so greedy.
---
Nah i get downvoted just for having an opinion
---
this happened to me last night on Ps4, my teammate could see the new egg but i couldnt, i got scared but a reboot fixed it, i hope you can get it to show up!!!
---
It’s all RNG, no guarantee of anything. Ran the burrows a couple of times so far, only encountered one three star (dropped a one star item) and one no-star that dropped a one star item. Yes they all glow that’s true, but whether legendary or not it’s the same gamble like WS.
---
Bethesda had him wacked.
---
I'm on PC, I can help you tonight if you'd like.
---
I had two glowing Kings waiting for me at the sunken church. They killed me twice before I managed to pacify one, and gattling plasma the other in the face for a solid 10 seconds before it went down. I was in PA and they still take huge chunks of health, and you can barely outrun them
---
I was going to be a sheepsquatch until i took an arrow to the knee
---
Imagine Being the Guy who Dropped like 300 of each material and just didn't come back For it lol
---
all you have to do to finish that quest is be in the bunker when a nuke is launched. it doesn't matter who launched it.
---
The issue is that the text at least does say it's affected.
---
Starts at -50% energy weapon damage.  When you equip Class Freak 3, it drops to -12% in the effects.  But it doesn't change in reality.
---
So one or the other is broken.  Either text is wrong, or effect is wrong.  Needs to be fixed either way.  But I wouldn't hold my breath on it happening any time soon.
---
How do you get them to go back to your camp? Mine just sits there for a few minutes and then becomes hostile again.
---
😂 I'm more like...
---
*my precious antique cans.*
---
Piss off the people who are actively trying to launch the nuke or piss of the new comers who try and steal the nuke?
---
Noice.
---
No one is immortal, there will be a nerf to sentinel coming soon, and cav. I know it’s coming
---
Stop the cat abuse! Cats must be protected! 
---
How dare your Power Armor gain sentience just to kill a poor little kitty cat. What did that cat ever do to you, Power Armor?? (•╭╮•)
---
Honestly you are just asking for trouble in survival if you troll or loot bag drops.  It’s such an easy way to get distracted and killed.  If it’s not the owner that issues payback it’s me (or others) that will snipe you.
---
My name is Fadoosh Badaboosh and i Kat-tinka-binka this hoo-ha.
---
If you are spawn camping 76, you are a bottom dick feeder.  Nothing more, nothing less.
---
I did eventually! I had to do another reboot this morning but it finally appeared.
---
And the lines in the song Ironic not being ironic makes it ironic.
---
Little is known but they did say that the number of stars on the item you’re scrapping would matter:
---
“For every star rating on a legendary item you scrap, increase your chances to get the legendary weapon or armor of your dreams.”
---
It worked before the emergency maintenance they rolled out 2 days after the patch.
---
I work in the court system. It’s not at all how it used to be. The courts look at all factors when it comes to custody. Who makes more money, stable household, who can provide health care, who has a better working schedule, which parent does the child prefer, how either parent done anything spiteful and used the child as a weapon against the other parent (your case),  are there any siblings involved, what school is the kid going to vs where do the parents live. 
---
A lot of factors but it’s not just a ‘kid goes to mom anymore’. I went through what you’re going through with my ex and she thought that’s how it was. I laughed. Now I have the kids everyday and every night.
---
Tomorrow's daily challenge: 
---
"Write a sign at your C.A.M.P. using proper spelling and grammar"
---
Uhhhh my dude, they read your posts lol.
---
You are correct. When I went through it, I was the first one there in survival mode. Those 2 poor randoms never saw me emerge from the water only to cut them down. It's a beautiful place full of lanes to set up (lanes meaning points of weapon fire).
---
Honestly a little of both. 
---
The people like me that go and aide the one that’s trying to launch but needs the firepower. And the people that RP stealing stuff. 
---
Just simply engaging a lockdown of the launch room would do many justice.
---
Oh you mean the damage indicated on your weapon doesn't change? Hm, that does sound broken. I don't use energy weapons (I'm only just now leveling up a vats/stealth/rifle alt where that would even be viable).
---
oh good!!! glad to hear it!
---
I wish I was near my PS4 because you guys are my doppelgängers as well
---
Sounds like a pretty cool idea. The only thing that would suck about this is possibly the fast travel times if you were away from your camp by the time it loaded up the person could be gone with your stuff.
---
**"This street ain't big enough for the two of us..."**
---
I have been away from home due to a family emergency and have missed 3 weeks of atoms...come back to find I can't even get the atoms available that day....FFS lol
---
No vendor sells them.  But a couple other spots to check:
---
Train car west of Watoga Station.
---
Shelf next to Fridge in Camp Venture barracks.
---
Those spots have the Marine Armor (chest, legs, arms) and Marine Tactical helmet and wetsuit underarmor plans in their list of possible spawns.
---
Added mate
---
Does he leave the lid off the toothpaste? If so, he's a synth.
---
Now that's a thought. Sounds awesome. Why not make floating candle systems in water.
---
No data mining is lame, let’s just discover it the way it’s meant to be.
---
Ya.  I don't use Energy weapons at all (Stealth Semi Auto Rifle build.  Handmade and Lever Action only).  So I use Grounded Mutation, and the bug doesn't bother my damage.
---
Huh, so going into nuke zones with regular armor is a no go eh? I had avoided doing my usual nuking routines in survival because I assumed all the properly pvp geared ass/sent players would descend upon me, look at the nuke, pop a radshield, and laugh that the stupid power armor guy thought he was safe as they proceeded to 2 shot me.
---
So you're saying they would probably avoid it? I might reconsider nuking and playing in survival.
---
Completely agree with you, surprise they don't turn off the mechanic of dropping a paper bag on death to save server horsepower during intense server events like that one.
---
not just you. i find it irritating that i am swinging a huge, rocket-propelled sledgehammer at point blank, and im still either hitting air, or if there is some kind of contact/visual effect, it takes a couple hits for damage to register
---
I think you will get tokens for each star. 3* gives you three tokens, etc. Then you will need like 25 tokens to re-roll one of the legendary abilities on the item. I think it will be randomized with whst you get. I'm thinking you may have to re-roll many times to get "lucky" and aquire the legendary stat you want.
---
Definitely not ideal but it will be a chance to roll a better prefix. Definitely think it will anger the masses because of the rng factor.
---
Oof hope you find some snallygasters in the Cranberry bog
---
I see.  Well thanks for the explanation.
---
I like this a lot. It opens up base raiding, even if it was survival only.
---
Well, they are not real deathclaw eggs, just decorative facsimiles you know. 
---
How do I know? 
---
They are made out of concrete...
---
Dumb question time .. if I leave an item on the floor or on a table in my camp, can another player pick it up? Will it disappear on it's own over time?
---
sharpie challenge... i heard
---
It would help everyone to play a little on survival mode. It really reinforces the need to stash your junk before encountering other players.
---
I'm pretty sure they are level 40 and 50 only.
---
one person argued that and he was downvoted to Oblivion
---
"literally no one"
---
See. here's the problem with saying shit like "nobody"... it's so fuckin' easy to prove it wrong.
---
Tons of people bitched about it... the same crew that bitch about everything. The same crew that have to prove to the world that they're somehow above the plebs that, ya know... enjoy things... 
---
sure, it wasn't everywhere… but it was absolutely there. "it's SO easy', "the combat is shit" and on and on. The exact same things you hear in every forum about every game.
---
… and they almost always come from the same type of player.
---
I love these scenarios. I spawn in close by and come up behind them. If they are at 76, simply travel to Grafton station, walk a little south west and shoot them in their asses. If they are crouched, it simply means they will die in 1 shot.
---
Cultist blade work on them, perhaps slightly better than bastet.
---
IIRC, takes me about 5 hits with L45 bastet to take out most higher level mutants.  As you noted, the problem is when they swarm you.
---
The executioners combat rifle performs well for rapid hip shots, and the 308 sniper works from the hillside opposite westek :)

Np. I do like the single card idea though. Maybe for a more later down the line event it would be cool. Maybe to launch a high yield ICBM
---
So maybe it's RNG-based?
---
I see nothing wrong with that especially in a game that should of been PVE focused for Adventure Mode which is meant for casual players.
---
and wabbits
---
nice!!! i like it
---
Also, keep in mind that unique items you get as quest rewards are usually scaled to your level. So, in order to get the best possible rewards, you shouldn't complete these quests until you've reached level 50.
---
Check the Fallout Wiki for a list of quests and complete only those which do not reward an item.
---
and they start eating pizzas
---
Its not "the only weapon that made it possible"
---
If you drop item on the floor (into paper bag) anyone can pick it up. It'll dissapear when you quit server.
---
I dont know then good luck
---
Exactly. Cause my Strength stat is so contested by weight perks and raw damage perks, I can hardly ever afford to run L&amp;L unless I just muled recently.
---
In my opinion, the Enclave scout armor is the riot armor of this game, needs a buff though. 
---
I plan to mix and match with combat armor.
---
I've never seen a quad gatling laser / plasma, and I've seen them of every other type. My guess is no, they can't spawn as quad. That would be neat - ridiculous ammo efficiency. Imagine, take the double fusion core perk and you'd have 4,000 shots per core on a gatling laser. Your DPS would still suck, but you could shoot that thing forever!
---
It's hard to read on anything imo :/  I even threw some candle lights then some brighter lights to make it easier to see. Didn't work so great.
---
Use it to farm acid 😁
---
Yikes! Apologies if that was us. ;-)
---
i just did
---
 Not a dumb question at all - I may be wrong but I thought I read that items dropped in bags will disappear after a set amount of time. I think items in containers stay until you leave the server, or maybe a server reset. I can’t confirm this though.
---
Upvote. I just would like them to aknowledge this officially.
---
Take notes guys.
---
This person is the only person on this subreddit with plenty commonsense that I have seen in a long time!
---
I don’t even think I can call it “common” here.
---
I'd be keen to team up, even though I'm away on holidays at the moment. I play most days my ign is  Harlequin5
---
Because it would be an exercise of futility. 
---
Either you understad the code, in which case you are only trolling and know fully well why what you ask wont work and why nobody else is asking for it. If this is the case taking the time to explaining advanced database coding and information retrieval would be a waste of my time.
---
...or you don't understand, and then the code would mean nothing to you and you actually think you are some genius that understand this better than all the other players, the devs and every server technician in the world. If this is the case taking the time to explaining advanced database coding and information retrieval would be a waste of my time.
---
Play on survival. Kill anyone that gets in your way. You have the numbers for this =).
---
it would also be nice if your perks or armor didn't reflect the weight as if it was in your inventory.
---
Is that how it is? cause none of my buddies completed it whenever I initiated the nuke sequence, unless they changed how it worked
---
I'll be on after that
---
Things I’m confident of: 
---
1. It’s over a month away (May 23 or later). 
---
2. It cannot be worse than having useless legendary items filling my stash. 
---
I don’t mean to stop you from having fun speculating, but that’s all we’ve got for now. I would make plans based on what’s discussed.
---
Get some troubleshooters armour if you have any, makes going through the silo a breeze, also levek 3 hacker and lockpick so you can bypass the reactor stage
---
sounds like a bhramin to me.get the vox syringer thingy. "ahw shit, a human,am deed"
---
I noticed this challenge and the 'make camera film' one, but couldn't find any plans for cameras or film so promptly dismissed them as ridiculous challenges that I can't complete.
---
It’s seems that some of the negative side effects of mutations are not suppressed by Class Freak. I don’t know if it’s by design or bugged.
---
I have Speed Demon and the 50% increase in food/drink consumption is not suppressed by Class Freak.
---
If I check in my Pipboy the +50% drain on Food/Drink consumption doesn’t change whilst using Class Freak. There’s also no discernible difference using it or not with Speed Demon
---
That's awesome brother. Yeah, I have no idea what's going through her head but I imagine she's being fed bad advice. My wife has severe epilepsy. She can't drive and doesn't work. She's staying with her parents, and that won't likely change any time soon. I guess she's thinking because she can be with our child full time, that it will guarantee her full physical custody. I hope that isn't the case. I want both of us equally in our child's life, but I'm not going to be walked on. If she isn't willing to work out custody through mediation, I'm not going to stop at 50/50. If she doesn't start thinking differently in the near future, I'm going for physical custody so that I can facilitate a fair arrangement for our daughter.
---
 Luckily she blundered in filing the initial suit paperwork, so I was able to file first and secure the jurisdiction in my County. I hold an elected position here and have the church and community behind me. Who knows, maybe that will give me a fair chance. 
---
I'm sure you didn't care to know all of this, but man it feels get some of it out.
---
I had a quad laser Gatling once It was base level 25? And had really low base durability. This was back like weeks after launch. So no idea if they can still drop.
---
&gt;I feel like I have no desire to lock pick at someone’s camp due to it makes me wanted instantly
---
Then the reason for being able to lock a CAMP item has succeeded.  Deter people from stealing your shit.  If you want to steal, then make sure it's worth the penalty.
---
Nah. It didn't. Tested it extensively on patch launch.
---
It "worked" 1 time out of 10 upon relogging.
---
Why do you have to be the screen door on my submarine?
---
I always carry around about 3 Nuclear Keycards, just in case I get it wrong, or to pass them out if someone else does.  I know I've saved at least one player from failure.  But it's why I argue that the keypad needs an actual Confirm key on it.  I don't think first-timers realize that the code is accepted/rejected when the last number goes in.  You don't get a chance to double-check it, so you need to review your code before punching in that last number.
---
Incidentally, they invited you, but having a Lv. 87 show up to help a Lv. 37 and 53 is kind of a tricky proposition because the silo scales itself.  They would be less likely to face things like Colonel Gutsy, but your presence would change that.  Ever since I was shoo'ed away by a lower level (and maybe they thought I was going to steal the silo or something too), I became more cognizant of that.  The silo (or maybe the Missile Site Holotape) really needs some kind of display that shows how far along the other players are.  Because, like you, I'll see a player camped out at a silo for an hour and ask myself what's going on.  Do they need help?  And sometimes they're just running around that initial area leveling.
---
Id also welcome the hotrod power armor station also.
---
&gt; Above: Soooooo many legendary mutants!
---
How fast did they run?
---
Alright buddy, I will remember to keep an eye out for you in the future so I don't "steal" your fun by mistake when I play. Now, please, do keep an eye out for me too. Remember, if you kill a mob when I am close by without me getting a hit in, you stole that mob from me. So please, keep your eyes open.
---
I saw him post last week I think.
---
I am sorry...
---
:-(
---
I actually would like this. I'd wear it with the sheepsquatch outfit and just sit in a chair in Whitespring waiting for players to sit on my lap for pictures.
---
Everything in the game save Fertile Soil has been deleted.
---
(Strong Liked That)
---
Wait, that's the same outfit I used to wear!
---
It looked barely legible in the atom shop picture. No wonder why it's cheap than the other lit signs
---
But I don't think people playing games are nerds. And I really like introverted hobbies. But life is too short to only play games. Read feedback is fun, and I hope the developers consider that. But the complaining and whining is tiresome, it's not useful. I think Gaming "with capital G" is IMO a toxic culture. Of course, not all the Gamers are like this. But many YouTubers (the main reference) really have ludicrous claims, and (again IMO) seems like care about fictional problems what only teenagers could consider relevant.
---
Ive also had impatient turds do this at whitesprings, there are now like 7 OTheR vendors there but of course the asshats want to be at the one vendor we are at
---
so, this is what i did last night, I could tell the player obviosuly wanted to use the vendor i was at, as they kept hitting me over and over
---
so i finally waited until they ran away a bit to look in there stash, then i got out of the vendor and i wave emoted at the player that had been hitting me.
---
the player realizxed i was done with the vendor and ran over, but right before he could access the vendor, I started trading again iwth the vendor, locking him out.
---
he got more pissed.
---
I waited for him to stop hitting me and walk a away a bit again, then i id the same thing, wave at him, then access the vendor again right before he could get to it.
---
HE GOT REALLY PISSED
---
I repeated this over and over about 3 times until he got on are chat and started swearing over and over, hitting me over and over.  Finally, as he stopped hitting me, I exited the vendor quickly, and I could see the message he was attacking me and I could pvp with him, so since he started the hist, I quickly snuck up behind him and one shotted his dumb ass and looted his bag full of flux.   it was glorious.
---
His verbal barrage of profanities was like a wall of fucks.
---
I finally got on area chat and told him, "This is what you get when you cant wait your turn" and promptly hopped servers.
---
2 so far
---
Yes, it's absolutely silly that this isn't a thing. The funny thing is, you actually CAN blueprint a workshop, but being able to actually snap the blueprint into place is just about impossible.
---
They are disappointing u because ur twisting what they claim too be working on for u into something that u may want but really isn’t! Most of this community has been doing that. As much as they’ve said this is just gunna be a use for the massive amounts of useless legendaries we have cropped up not a “hey u have spent ridiculous hours in this game and beat the main story. Let me give u the ability too make all ur legendaries stupidly OP!” Learn too use some better logic man jeez :/
---
But there’s nothing to steal? There’s no reward for me to sneak into a camp, no stash box that’s available to all players on a server to loot, just your home with things I can destroy but not loot
---
Kinda of hard to enforce that if your weaker then the player(s) that are doing it through, for example when getting Sole Survivor from weekly pvp mode I went to do Uranium Fever with 13 players and 4 of them decided to boot everyone out of the main room making us sit outside the event and all 9 of us were too weak to do anything about it.
---
Time limited "Free" items are better than the Time Limited items that cost.  But they just do it to make sure more people are forced to buy Atom points.  Reducing the time available to gather the Free atom points, while making the Free atom points harder (either by requiring much more to do them, or making them impossible via bugs...) to gather up.
---
Plans and costumes you can get no where else?
---
Thanks! Is there some kind of reward for having them all?
---
&gt;But there’s nothing to steal?
---
Extractor resources.
---
Yeah. That's one of the reasons why I prefer solo games to multiplayer ones. Assholes.  
---
Built up an awesome base in ARK, asshole on a cheated eagle with a cheated rocket launcher flies onto the server and liquidates my base and everyone else before the admin can be called in to help. Killed the game for me to be honest.  
---
Ran into one a few days ago. Was in the mining area on the southern edge, and was getting jumped by ghouls (not in a bad way). In the room I was in was an unclaimed suit of power armor I was going for. Really the only reason to be in this room. Suddenly this high level asshole runs into the room, skips the ghouls, jumps in the suit claiming it, then runs out of the room (not helping me) and punches some ghouls outside to death. THEN JUMPS OUT OF THE PA AND RUNS OFF. He abandoned it, didn't even want it, and since it's claimed I can't get it now.
---
If there is a work bench near a window you can activate it and get inside.
---
Sheepsquatch is the perfect time to farm for caps.
---
I don't know about *this* guy, but I've definitely seen that happen by accident.  I've had people go over and swipe the keycard, thumbs up and gesture to the keypad as if I can do something with it.  I can't.  They realize this, enter the code, and do the same thing with the targeting computer.  No, really, I can't.  It's locked to whoever first swipes the card unless they flub the code entry.
---
*\*seethes\**
---
Not really. It’s criticism. When I make a comment I usually don’t even come back to reply to anyone who replied to me. I don’t give a shit about the attention, I want a better game.
---
I'm pretty sure that's *not* the case.  You'll complete "Mission Countdown" for that silo, but not I Am Become Death.
---
I am level 100+ and I use a hazmat suit all the time. But I am. A stealth build so I don't get hit often. If you don't do stealth I would recommend PA
---
anyone anyone
---
Yes, we've been asking for Overseerers stash boxes for a while hopefully they give us them soon. I'd love to share my excess loot and plans without them disapearing if they are not claimed.
---
But, but my C.A.M.P is just south of Harpers Ferry, I'm guessing I'm going to either need allot of mats to repair all the time or someone to build me a new one.
---
Come visit on your way to the Burrows, all are welcome.
---
This is exactly why my bottom floor has no windows
---
There are plush rabbit dolls in the atom shop to buy
---
That’s weird. I’ve never had this happen. I’m on Xbox and I can fire my double Gatling gun for 500 bullets straight and my crosshairs stay the whole time.
---
Are you on PC?
---
I had a map last night which was fucking wierd. There were legendary spawns galore, but all the enemies were immune to range damage. They would get to 1 HP then heal to full no matter how hard I hit them BUT.... They were susceptible to melee. Forced me to use my melee weapons which I rarely normally do, and playing as a bloodied build it was interesting to say the least.
---
I had many deaths but found multiple good 3 star legendary weapons including a 3 star pipe bolt action weapon bloodied, explosive, aim speed and a two star plasma gun (instigating, fire rate).
---
Someone even activated sheepsquatch before I logged off, but it was literally impossible with the bugginess and melee restriction.
---
I felt like it was a dev testing a new game mode.
---
Ok, after all the responses I decided to give it a go before going to bed... and [I was able to launch it solo](https://i.imgur.com/P39G0nc.png)! I never left the launch controls this time lol 
---
Thanks for motivating me guys!!
---
That’s rough. I’ve been lucky enough to finish it a couple of times, but it’s tough to miss out bc of a server crash
---
You’ve got to let your cap count rise.
---
Well, I'm collecting them and hiding each one around my CAMP.  It'll be an interesting Easter Sunday then.
---
Yep! Well said Good sir! XD
---
Lol, yes it's heavily exploited. I just leave my camp unlocked water purifiers and all. I don't mind if players stop to rest and refresh themselves.
---
yes but nobody knows what it is yet afaik.  it says on the little easter flier in the atom shop
---
Last time I checked, the Whitesprings Station vendor has all the building sets
---
I legit just stood there for like 10 minutes smashing E on them. TOok a few mins but it eventually worked
---
I have a Double Explosive Gatling Laser, but not sure if they come in Quad. I'd assume if they have the Double in the loot pool that Quad would be in there as well.
---
Get hazmat suit, make sure you do enough damage and spot enemys first, easy
---
I have the 130% perk and I am constantly repairing my legendaries...
---
&gt; Incidentally, they invited you, but having a Lv. 87 show up to help a Lv. 37 and 53 is kind of a tricky proposition because the silo scales itself.
---
Wouldn't surprise one bit if I caused the Assaultron Dominator to show, but, by all accounts, they hadn't resolved the 2nd task (1st being laser grid) by the time I got to them.
---
thanks man, but I was able to do it! posted a pic in the comments somewhere
---
&gt;sure, it wasn't everywhere… but it was absolutely there. "it's SO easy', "the combat is shit" and on and on. The exact same things you hear in every forum about every game.
---
????
---
how is that relevant to the argument at hand? i was talking about length and in terms of length the witcher 3 is a pretty long game
---
Overlay crosshairs on a game? There's an app for that:
---
https://github.com/topics/crosshair-overlay
---
it's happened in the silos too. turrets and assaultron explodes before i shoot it. its as if god itself smited them.
---
deeeeecent
---
They only allow like 24 players/server are you trying to find less populated servers or more populated?
---
I did the same until some asshat decided to grief the players at my camp while i wasnt there. Completely leveled it and didnt get a single warning. Id rather people just stay out now.
---
It's also time to finally fix the missing sights on the Pump-Action Shotgun.
---
https://i.imgur.com/8P5lCS8.png
---
I’m with you 100% on this. I’ve bought so much in the atom shop, I can’t place all of it down in my current camp anymore. We need more build budget! Even if each purchased item gave like 2-3% more budget to place the item without removing anything, that would be great. But right now, I don’t see a reason to purchase anymore camp stuff in the atom store if I can’t place it
---
Is there anything new?
---
I discovered the entry yesterday and another states that it is east-north-east of Harpers Ferry.
---
If radioactivity has anything to do with it, then it could be the railway tunnel, because it radiates quite nicely
---
If you punch them they bleed apparently, so there's that.
---
What throws most people off is that when first using the Gatling the inaccuracy, though very slight, can skew where people think it is aiming. Also, many people like myself can’t stand 3rd person view in this game.
---
If they have teammates with the right perks shared they can hangout in the Blast Zone in regular armor
---
Get a non-damaged hazmat suit in the federal deposit site. Does 1000 resistance and i get like &lt;1 Rad/Sec. without chems
---
Some people are just assholes. I've had this happen I just rebuild I'm not going to stop being helpful because some jerkwad blew up my camp. Though I can understand why you'd feel that way.
---
The holy Trinity can be fun for some games but not for fallout.... Keep it classless.
---
Lemme know how that goes for you 👍
---
No, the hit detection was definitely modified with the patch that came out about a month ago (I think it was the brewing patch). Here’s a link from when it first was most noticeable.
---

---
At least he wasn’t wearing a red jumpsuit and holding a pair of golden scissors.
---
I bought mine from vendors.
---
Or you are bullshitting.
---
I tried to do one once, went and got all the codes and everything, took hours, go to the silo and lit up so bad by the gutsies in there. I couldn't get through at all so I finally just gave up, and actually, I sort of stopped playing the game at that point. I screwed that build up royally. I wish there was a way to just reset it
---
What does the mutation do exactly?,because I forgo
---
Ah true, good old rad sponge. Welp, guess it's adventure for me then!
---
You should watch oxhorn's response video. He addresses that. And an aside, someone's opinion is not fact. Don't let anyone's personal beliefs ruin your day. They don't apply to you. That's just them limiting their own world.
---
Which is why I used to be his fan until I found out what a shitty person he is that can't take critism and tries to censor others.
---
I just think it's weird that the actual decryption process is "beyond" the game.  Like, you actually need to jot down some notes, unscramble a word, etc.  And the game never explains this process except in vague terms.
---
On ps4 and I am having the same issue. Hope it isn't counting for durability.
---
Melee weapons do but not ranged cuz bethsdurh balance.
---
I quite literally heard players talking about how the main mission was "too short" (pissing in the wind, IMO) but it existed. It always exists. 
---
If I say a game is awesome... a player will come along and say it's pure shit, and that I'm shit for thinking it.
---
If I say a game was a good length, someone else will bitch that it's too short, and I should "git gud".
---
If I say that, playing a couple hours a day, I got moths of enjoyment out of something... another will say that they finished it in 3 days.
---
The issue at hand is that it's ALWAYS the second type of player that think the industry should meet their demands. It's ALWAYS the 2nd type of player that takes to the net to bitch, and ALWAYS the 2nd type of player to spend their time drowning out those players that say "ya know, I like this, I enjoy this". Because, to the 2nd type of player... that's not good enough.
---
your mission if you choose to accept it: destroy all turret bases behind whitesprings golf house
---
reward: 200 invisible chickens
---
Yeah, but that's not the point.  It appears the suits have a magical buff against rads that isn't listed like PA has.  Which makes regular armor almost impossible for end game content.
---
oh i thought they did fix this recently?
---
Not my video, is a video by a self admitted Osborn fan.
---
Or just ask me I’ll do it for free.
---
let me get this straight. you want to steal from another player,and your bitching that you get caught................................................................JESUS.
---
I think Class Freak is broken. I have speed demon. I maxed Class Freak and Stimpacks still barely heal me.
---
Oh i still help low level players but not at my place lol. Id rather gift new players with deep pocket heavy leather armor and a bos sniper and ammo. My camp is now heavily guarded as its next to a side mission. Im getting all kinds of fun things attacking my camp now lol.
---
What's the point of doing dailies and weeklies to get "free" atoms, if I am already missing "free" time limited things by missing them by less then 24 hours? If I can't even by the thing because it's time limited and I am too late, then I have no point of trying to get those "free" atoms or even buying atoms.  
---
And here I am a guy who logs in to League of Legends from time to time. Most of the times buy some new skin. Play for a couple of hours and I am done with it for month, a two or more.  
---
But here I have no reason to spend my money on atoms if I can't get anything decent with it.
---
You two should stage the "Art" synth encounter from Fallout 4 for other players on the map
---
Furious refers to the users reaction to the scaling damage.
---
I think it will just be cosmetic
---
You don't think ive not made my own games too? Rofl
---
They made it possible to inspect with vendors but not other players unfortunately 😒
---
Troll then, thanks for clarifying.
---
When I first played “Breach and Clear” I had a flashback to me seeing that event active so many times but not knowing how insane it is. I do the event all the time now
---
Find me a seller with a TSE that accepts caps and you might be right.  But caps are nearly worthless at this point.  If you don't have a heavy marine left leg with unyielding, sentinels, and reduced aid weight EXACTLY then you ain't getting what you're looking for
---
sure just use a hazmat suit at 1000 resistance, maybe jump up on a high surface so mobs cant overwhelm you
---
Doing that already
---
I hear you.  Mines at 10 and I carry 5 for Makeshift warrior and 4 for Demolition Expert and one for Power Patcher since I run PA.  I have all those at various levels and I have to think about what I'm fixing to do and swap things around.  I would love to be able to drop Makeshift Warrior down to 2, that would give me alot more options.  Like I said, it has become a quality of life thing at this point.  Maybe someday. Over the rainbow.  Or something like that.
---
Whats your IGN? Need to eliminate competitors
---
People constantly saying 'just fix it' have no understanding of how these things work.  It's not like there's a button that someone accidentally pushed that says 'disable mods'.
---
I think it's probably related to item renaming (just a guess though).  When you mod an item, at least some of the time the name of the item changes.  When they added the ability to rename things, it's possible that that interfered somehow with how mods work on items, breaking their ability to be applied.
---
Simple fix, turn renaming back off (how well would that go over?).  Harder fix, figure out what the underlying link is that broke with renaming, and find a workaround.  Easy enough,  as long as you don't break one of the 320934 other things related to items and names (and item effects and legendary affixes, and state/weight changes, and...)
---
People bitch when something doesn't work, but they also bitch when the devs take the time to fix things correctly.  It used to be that people would calmly detail bugs and things and post them for the devs to look at, now they just complain and resort to name-calling.  It's no wonder you don't see the CMs around here much any more.
---
Won’t be on until later (7PM EST) but willing to trade them 2 for 1 cap?
---
aha......... more so than the non legends ? (significantly)
---
I agree all these places should be small safe zone bubbles to cut down on down camping.
---
Bio-luminescent Fluid to craft those glowing bottles from the Children of Atom in Fallout 4 but be able to change the colors to something like Quantum Blue &lt;3
---
Nice, I keep a modded lvl 5 hunting rifle to give to newbies 50+ damage at a low level is a life saver.
---
I need to find the BOS sniper plans I'd love to be able to gift that to newbies.
---
Sounds good
---
any idea how much more rad gets added to your deep dish mod on a gamma gun its a f----k ton and it still sits in my stash unbolt-able :(
---
Yay I have hope
---
Sorry but their goal is to get you logging in a lot  and spending money.
---
That’s the trade off of a game-as-a-service giving “free” content
---
The current speculation is that it's a bunny mascot head.  I've heard another one too, but can't remember it.
---
Radshield &gt;&gt; Rad X. But you really cannot get around using one of either PA or a hazmat suit in a nuke zone unless you are willing to spec around rad resistance, build a rad resist armor set and run in a group with someone using rad sponge. But those are a lot of factors that go into trying to avoid slapping on a hazmat suit for 45 minutes.
---
For someone who only gets to play about 2hrs a night if that launching a nuke takes too long to enjoy the benefits.
---
I agree, to be honest I spend sometimes quite a lot of time to look for quest marker on map. Maybe im just getting old and blind but they seem to be very small.
---
Said outfit’s effects: You are easier to spot, but aiming directly at you causes your attacker to suffer from the concussed effect.
---
yep my stash box has been full for a while now because I am also waiting....
---
Nice. This wasn't really meant as a looting for post but would you ever consider selling it?
---
I like that. Reminds me of the air displacement sensors from *Aliens*. 
---
"5 meters man, WTH?" "No way, that's inside my build zone." "I'm reading it right, look!"
---
technically, it was already a feature to inspect with vendors, until a previous patch broke it, then they re-added it in lol. Yea, we NEED this for player trades.
---
We are going all GTA 5 peyote/bigfoot lol
---
Absolutely!
---
&gt; Thanks for motivating me guys!!
---
No problem! I wasn't one of the ones motivating you, I just like to walk in after all the work is done and take credit.
---
I dont think that’ll work, I am wearing a lot of unyeasting armor you see.
---
I just want to be able to keep hate off my dudes from bosses. Theyre usually already squishy due to bloodied builds, so when we get bosses that are like sheepsquatch or the likes, itd be best for them to actually live than be dead most of the time from being chased.
---
Ugh this whole thing about requiring a login during Easter weekend when a lot of people travel is annoying. Make them free the first day and 250 atoms after that until the end of the event or make an atom store on the web that we can access.  At least make the first one available and I'll try to install the client on my crappy laptop and I'll bring it with me.
---
Bullshitter then, thanks for clarifying.
---
IMHO, 
---
sure, it @#%@ to "miss out" but....
---
If this is successful, I''m sure there will be other seasonal/holiday centric events to come, and likely, they will be limited time.   
---
I'm also sure its a method of getting people to poke around in the atom shop, and possibly make additional acquisitions from same.
---
===
---
College graduation season is coming - think there might be a short run event  at VTU?  If so, I'll miss out on that one, b/c I have to take a couple days to attend a graduation IRL.
---
Memorial day?  Short duration (faction) event to honor those that have been lost fighting (faction)....but I'll miss that to, as I'll be away from console for a few day @ a relatives wedding...
---
Anyhow, the possibilities for other short term events - from our 10 national holidays to any number of "Hallmark Card" holidays to silly stuff like national hot dog day.... - are almost endless.  Relax.
---
I don’t give my IGN out,. :) I’m sure you can ask around
---
That would make the problem worse.
---
Same issue here. Really want to try out the Tesla coil chest mod for X-01 just for fun but i can not mod anything. attach mods that i have the plan for works fine though, tried it on my Excavator.
---
Hope Beth fixes this soon....
---
I was once a sheepsquatch like you until I took an arrow (silver?) to the knee.
---
Nah, they know they are going to loose a lot of players. Also there is like a bazillion ways to counter both
---
If you like using mutations use rad x dilutee and radaway that's my way of doing it because if you use normal rad x it suppresses your mutations for a few minutes.
---
Hazmat suit.
---
The only other option I've heard is to run with a team and share Rad Sponge.  I'm not sure how well this works in practice.  When I've had Rad Sponge 3 with a team, I didn't notice their rads decreasing very often.
---
Reason #30924 we need *many* outfit styles in the Atomic Shop all in the same vein and not FO4 re-textures.
---
There should be 6-10 variants on this Western Duster set alone, same with the cowboy hat.
---
They don't have to be dramatic, but differences.
---
Well, maybe we've already met before who knows
---
Would be so wrong if Bethesda started to spawn sheep and one of the places you can end up after a blackout is in a pen of sheep.
---
Yup. I generally just sacrifice the first shot to get my bearings, and nail the rest. Not like 5mm ammo is expensive.
---
PSA put your junk away before you do an event where its common to die. DURR
---
Is it true you will be able to buy tokens in the Atom store?
---
(I'm making this up, just something the business development guys would do)
---
There are lots of interior areas that are nukable if you nuke the area on top, so I doubt this is a bug or needs "fixed". Should be fine. They might remove the lack of global cooldown on respawns though.
---
You can block them. Just like how I'm blocking you for being a cunt. Byeeeeeee.
---
There just isn't an incentive to actually not shoot on sight. Because if you don't the other guy will and not care.  I have tried to avoid conflict a lot of times when running across a random in survival. It's just better you kill them on sight get a bounty and then get shot from a random location or while in an event like 40 minutes later.
---
Games like breaking point had  faction/class system that atleast makes you think about who or why to kill. Survival consists of hermits and people trying to grow their E-peen.
---
I wish there was a strategy that made TSE weapons worthless, at the cost of armor slots, perk cards, and increased vulnerability to other weapons.
---
Crackle crackle respawn is absolutely not fun. And those jerks always fire as soon as they see someone.
---
This is actually a pretty dope RP idea. Find low-level players, copy their outfit, copy their base, follow them around creepily.
---
Hazmat Suits add an invisible perk to the player, `HazmatSuitRadResistancePerk`, which multiplies incoming radiation by .02. This means that before the Radiation Resistance of the suit itself can be applied, the nukezone rads are reduced to 1.2/sec.
---
The endurance perk should offer like 2-3 times the rad protection so a non PA build would be possible.
---
I wonder how long this will remain active. Prima has shut down, and essentially only keeps their online guides. They said they’d be available through this month but I haven’t seen anything since. I hope they find a way to keep them going, maybe provide an offline version.
---
I feel the same , a Mr Messenger led me to what I think may be the same farm (there were some notes in there saying basically I'm out of here, if you read this farm is yours haha) , along the way a SB had attacked and when we arrived Mirelurk Queen was there and just laid waste to that poor thing 😵 at least sometimes you can get them stuck in those trenches out there
---
Same here. Really annoyed I can't access the Atomic Shop through the web or my phone. Lots of people travel during Easter. I have no problem paying atoms for missed eggs.
---
Wait, maybe I'm not crazy!!!!  Me and my buddy were fighting glowing ghouls in harpers ferry nuke zone. After killing a few, one blew up like a mini nuke went off and crippled my limbs to shit. Only disease I was suffering was the blight, it was so weird.
---
Yea it’s always a compromise, I have to keep changing perks base on what I’m doing, like when I’m too overencumbered I have to change damage perks to 1 point each and put on Strong Back for the extra pounds I just picked up lol
---
Tell your bud to go to edge when you have photomode out and ready and snap the shot quickly before you watch your friend tragically die in front of you
---
I've read a post like this before, it was probably yours.  This subject keeps coming around every couple of weeks when newer players first see one.  I think its pretty cool.  They are very rare to see for most, but I'm sure there are places where they spawn fairly regularly.  I have seen or killed 5 different versions and need the Albino, the Dreaded and the Scorched to complete my list.  Came up on a level 1 Wise the other day and didn't want to fire on it.  I was setting up for a picture and it flew/teleported away.
---
I agree...this isn't a dissertation...why so formal. Please dont correct when the meaning is clear it's just annoying/distracting. Thx!
---
Lol I want a sense of award, I have no issue getting caught if I’m caught. But if I successfully break and enter, why do I still get wanted? No one caught me, there’s no trip wire for an alarm? I successfully picked your locked
---
just did a quick research. going to add you lmao
---
I just got a bloodied multipurpose axe last night if you are interested. PSN: stollio
---
Like a decon shower, after you use Rad Awayyyyyy.
---
My two handmades were always on their assigned slots, from the patch day to the emergency maintenance. Despite the crashes, server drops or relogging bonanza I had. However after the said maintenance they were on different slots from the first login until today.
---
Oh no!! Not the diseased basename!
---
I think you came to the conclusion there was no point to try prematurely. You can easily kill a level 200 as a level 2, oddly enough it's EASIER to kill them as a level 2 than as you increase in level (unless of course you progressively find better legendary gear as you level). This is because of the PvP damage balancing Bethesda has implemented. 
---
A perfect example of this is on a Survival exclusive alt I made I got a level 5 assassin's auto 10mm pistol from the Leader of the Pack event. At level 5 I was shredding other higher level players with it, but now at level 20 it is taking more hits in order to down them. Also of note is that this is with a pistol without armor piercing and no pistol perks.
---
I've seen mine go as high as 600 DR, 550 ER while using my Bolstering armor at or below 20% Health. This is with Nerd Rage activated, along with another 1 or 2 perks I'm not able to remember. Basically the lower my health goes, the harder I am to kill. Couple that with the 3 Sentinel pieces I currently have, it makes it that much more difficult. All that being said. . . I still die too often lol.
---
Yep I'm screwed too. Irritated that we can't pay for the ones we missed.
---
They should make it so you walk down a long hallway and all music stops and then epic boss music initiates and then you fight a boss that’s insane only to realize it’s *sans*
---
been like that forever, thought it might just console, got 76 to play with my bro on PC and nope, same issue on pc.  sucks.  I should be able to 1 hit most enemies on console, level 93 melee build = awesomeness but it wont register and still have to swing 2-3 times sometimes.
---
I've seen multiple 1, 2, and 3's on the map at the same time. One time there were 7 markers at once, 2 1's, 3 2's, and 2 3's. Crouching definitely hides your marker. Just my anecdote, though, no screenshots to prove it.
---
Many overlook lead champagne and its mixed drinks. These also offer rad resist and im pretty sure they stack with radshield. 
---
Id recommend taking 10 or so drinks with you though, as they only last 5 minutes.
---
How would adding 8 more players to the world be worse?
---
You know what, that's a real douchey thing for someone to do. I'm level 307 and I'd never do that, but I'd help someone launch. Jesus christ people. It's as bad as farming loot bags at the sheepscrotch event
---
I wont accept random invites anymore for this reason among others. Just not worth it with all the jerks in game....
---
I was on a server with 8 people yesterday
---
What part of the endgame makes it feel like a necessity? You can even fight the queen outside of the nuke zone. At launch it was perceived like this. After a crazy amount of playing this game and the majority not in PA I don't feel this to be true.
---
Did this last night for the first time to farm for two deathclaw hands. Was surprised it took like 15 server hops. Finally fashioned a deathclaw gauntlet and had so damn much junk and black titanium
---
i understand your stance, but you have to remember it is Bethesda who broke them in the first place, and they have announced they will release a fix next week
---
Hay is for horses
---
Maybe OP is the synth and doesn't know it.
---
The hats are different, but yeah, if those fall off we’ll have a classic movie conundrum.
---
I do the opposite. I have everything unlocked to deter the fools that would grief because of locks. They need to increase the bounty though for base destruction. 50 caps does not equal 9 water purifiers, a junk extractor, 7 rocket turrets and a fusion generator. Or just add the pacifist thing already. Not looking for griefers at my vending machines.
---
I don’t think it’s a huge deal. It’s probably something stupid, but I still want it :)
---
I’m going out of town Saturday/Sunday for the holiday, so I have to bring my Xbox with me to the hotel so I can make sure to get it. 
---
My husband thinks I’m an idiot, but I want to collect them all!
---
Turns out bricky was drunk and kidnapped himself
---
You're missing my point. You told someone to watch a specific video so they could see your side of things and when they asked you to do the same to understand their view, you refused.
---
I use unyeilding bos armor and around 280ish in both. I'm stealth so I rarely have to worry about being hit
---
Silos really need to be instanced so this can't happen. I'm not sure why Bethesda seems to have such an aversion to instanced areas.
---
A total player count would be great to have.
---
If you're on a Survival server an easy way to check if there's at least 10 players is looking at the different leader boards. If there's less than 10 players the rankings will stop at however many players there are.
---
why do they put people in prison for breaking and entering. there is a place in the middle east in the news recently,go for a holiday there.
---
Oh yeah, that's the classic invincible enemies bug. That kicks in whenever you do too much damage and it causes all of your ranged weapons to have their damage ignored.
---
The worst part is you definitely see the damage register, but it's like the game has decided that it doesn't like how much you're doing so it resets it. So annoying...
---
Although I thought they had patched that one out, honestly, unless it just keeps rearing itself which is likely.
---
Yep. Fuck mirelurks, scaring the hell out of me because I thought the marsh was empty. At least you can tell where sb's are from a mile away
---
Oh really? Huh, must've at least been exacerbated recently then.
---
That will still be at the expense of having to eat Radaway the entire time you are in the zone. I have done it that way, and its totally manageable with a quick selector, but its still resource intensive. 
---
You need to hit about 500 rad resist before you will have some breathing room.
---
thanks man! i will be adding you tonight, after work!
---
quick question: can anyone tell me or link me what materials it costs to make the serums once you buy the recipe?
---
I have currently :
---
**Lvl 40** Bloodied Harpoon Gun 
---
*LVL 35 Bloodied Assaultron Blade*  
---
*Bloodied Cultist Blade*
---
200 caps a piece and there all yours. Not online until after 4pm Eastern though. Oh, and you didn't say which system lol, I'm on PS4.
---
We're on PC though.
---
&gt;I quite literally heard players talking about how the main mission was "too short" (pissing in the wind, IMO) but it existed. It always exists.
---
well no lifers exist since the original doom but a healthy debate can be had between what is really short content like the burrows or really long like witcher 3s main quest 
---
&gt;The issue at hand is that it's ALWAYS the second type of player that think the industry should meet their demands
---
well if you started it i might as well add on it there are multiple types of gamers casuals that play a couple of hours a week the core gamer that plays video games as his main hobby and plays a couple of hours a day and the hardcore gamer that plays 8-10 hours a day 
---
people being happy with the burrows aren't the hardcore gamer types they are more than likely core gamers that play 3-4 hours a day and wanted something they could play with their buddies on a friday night and have fun (after all the dungeon was advertised for 2 geared lvl 50 players ) you don't have to be a no lifer or a hardcore gamer to realize that the burrows is really really short
---
I have killed her dozens of times. No one has ever been able to cripple her. what is your magic trick?
---
Nice. That's good news. Bye bye 1-star weapons!
---
It would make the problem OP is talking about worse. The issue in the post is that farming locations are cleared by the time you get to them. More people == more clearing == more of the same problem.
---
8 legendaries as well. I was expecting zero after all the bellyaching here.
---
No I understand what he asking for. How he's going about it by asking for a mod is the issue.
---
Ad victoriam, Brother. Is your name Danse by any chance?
---
I remember Hazmat but not PA having a similar (probably same) buff in Fo4.
---
Maybe he means real ones. That would be cool to have chickens and chicks.
---
Didn't say anything. Not a sound.
---
Ad Victoriam!
---
Apparently they fixed Watoga legendary bots completely so people can’t get any legendary from them. 
---
Also spawn rate of all supplies has been fixed repeatedly so people can’t farm for supplies without hopping dozens of servers. 
---
Even fusion cores have been fixed so you only get 25% charged ones most of the time. Maybe quick chargers will show up in atom store soon. 
---
As soon as some youtubers brag about their farming locations and techniques BGS has to come out and ‘fix’ it immediately. 
---
There’s nothing to fix in HF though, the legendary spawn rate is no different than WS so why bother.
---
I was told if you gathered them up and walked into your dead spouses funeral fire you will become Mother of deathclaws. Should probably equip fireproof first.
---
I'm something like DR: 260, ER: 230, Rad: 50, and Poison: 25.
---
It's mainly BoS Combat Armor with one Trapper and one Metal piece.  4/5 Unyielding.  2 are Sentinel.  One is Vanguard (because it has Sentinel).  I used to run all Vanguard and had DR up in the 400s, but you eventually realize DR doesn't matter as much as you'd think it does.
---
I did recently find a 3\* Bolstering Trapper Chest with Cavalier, which gets my Rad resist clear up to 90.  At that point, I can stand next to the Scorchbeast Queen and only take 1 rad/sec, which is great.  But in the one test I did with it, I died quite a lot.  Obviously, Trapper is weaker than BoS Combat, but this was like "Dying while being Super Stimpacked" dying.  I'm not sure what was going on.  I appeared to die out-of-the-blue.
---
Same. I logged in two days ago to do the amusement park and shots weren’t hitting with VATs or just old fashioned aiming.
---
This actually happens too often lol
---
Bugs or no bugs, Bethesda games are awesome “third places” to get away from it all.
---
I am relax but it's frustrating to see it like this. Sure there will be more event and stuff. But it's just more things to miss.
---
If you told me I can pay in advance and I won't have to log in on that one specific day not to miss it. Then I say "Here is my credit card. Pleasure doing business with you". And just like that everyone is happy.
---
To hell with it. give me a season pass. I don't need to know right away what's in it. I am buying it. It's a live service so how about a subscription?
---
Even those pay2play mobiles a games give you a chance to pay for content.
---
I almost wish people wouldn’t talk about it as much so Bethesda wouldn’t look at it. I feel like all the talk about it will make them go in and change it.
---
Aw. That's my cats name. She was a stray kitten.
---
If you're cool with cheating, that is.  I find it much more fun (and better XP) to do it as intended.
---
I've got 600 hours and five characters at 100+. The gap between the best weapon I've found (FE .50) and the second best (variety of decent stuff) is totally absurd. The .50 cal character deliberately stops by that mirelurk farm to kill the queen and kings any time they are traveling in and out of the bog, because it takes about 30 seconds to clear the whole spawn, and the queen can drop interesting loot.  The rest of my characters would need about 3-7 minutes to clear it and don't bother.
---
Also, I’m not sure under which sub this post belongs. Pretty new here to Reddit :)
---
Lol I don't even care about dropped loot anymore if I'm not out farming!
---
I cant actually check since the wikia doesnt think the champagne has rad resist :/
---
Pretty sure its +200 though, that with radshield should be up to +500 rr. And making 10 of these is easy if you have the recipe that makes 1 vintage into 3 mixed drinks. 
---
Could easily just make 30 of the mixed drinks from a single fermenter of champagne.
---
The worst part is HEARING it collide, and seeing blood, but not having any damage occur on the enemy for several hits
---
Dunno we didn't spend the night together.
---
Game's stable for me (oceanic if it makes a difference), but sweet bugger all mobs are spawning.  Spent last 4hrs trying to find 5 Anglers in the bog marsh areas, found 1.  Sometimes they'd spawn and die moments later, like I have an aura of death or something.  Especially weird those robot-making machines in robo-town, all building dead robots.
---
Yes I am having this issue it seems to be when use vats melee never does any damage
---
Its a video game, and there is nothing to steal. If I get inside your base I can either use your benches or access MY stash. You sound like a trash animal right now haha.
---
A few days ago I saw a protectron called "feral ghoul". This game is a bit weird sometimes.
---
Easier to drop it in a secluded spot outside of the event area.
---
We launched last night to check out the burrows. There was tons of glowies, but the rng was crap for legendaries. 
---
I was shocked by the amount of hardened and glowing mass being dropped there though. Everything street level dropped 2-4 of one or the other.  Unfortunately the high radiation fluid wasn't dropping as consistently.
---
If you are a rifle stealth build hazmat will still pack a punch and help. When farming flow you don't need to be combat focused anyway. As for farming glowing ones etc.. What a lot of people don't know is that enemies will still be affected by the nuke for a few hours after the rad zone (red circle on map) has gone. So a nice chance for normal armor farming.
---
Not everyone wants PVP interaction. This could almost force that with the kickoff of pvp once they enter your camp. Just a thought.
---
Well recipes sell for crazy amount at the vendor or are a free drop from the queen so after acquiring it the main cost is in the flux.  The farming of the mats. Not so much the unstable but the hardened mass and other things required to make the stable flux. These items are generally looted from bodies as soon as they are down so it is a fight to get them.  Not mention the time put in to launch the nuke in the first place.  The other items required to make them are generally inconsequential until you run out of them and coal is a pain to get enough of it seems.  So, assuming no duping was done you have kicked the queens butt hundreds of times and got the recipes, you launch nukes at various places on the map to farm the flux, fight to get the mats required.  I know I didn’t put a single number out, but what would all of that be worth to you?
---
To be fair this game was made poorly especially during first few months, I still believe in this game but hope they change Adventure Mode to a mode that only incentivizes players to cooperate instead of abuse poorly made pvp system or stealing from other players.
---
thanks for making this post so i know to block you so ill never have to read a post from you again
---
Bro join my sub reddit  r/PKOA i especially like to help new players an break down a few things the game doesnt tell you. What platform you on?
---
Collecting the fauna in nuke zones is a big part of end game...
---
Found the quill-riddled brahmin at a random encounter location south of Harper's ferry (under the railroad trestle up the road from the Red Rocket). Saved the quills; they're scrappable for two bone but I'm thinking like composite skis, deathclaw hands, or scrappable assaultron heads, they may have future crafting use.
---
Wait how were they trolling me? I say in my video it was nukable and most of my original criticisms remain the same. Not sure where you are coming from with this?
---
Why do you say that?
---
Ad Victoriam! Brother may your Steel never break!
---
But my memories...they're all so real...exiting the Vault, finding the Overseer's Camp, meeting Rose, killing my first Scorchbeast Queen...
---
And before I left the Vault...wait.
---
I remember waking up late on Reclamation Day. Why? I don't remember anything before that... Why?
---
Couldn't you just enter someones camp and farm them for caps if your in pvp the moment you enter their property?
---
In a team with someone sharing rad sponge
---
I never got a shipping notice. Just a notice after they accepted my claim that they would take 6-9 months to be made.
---
It's too hard for your lvl and you should now do the event till your probably around 60+. Go do some side missions or the main quest lane dude. You will get to it once you finish.
---
speak with the "gourmands" faction
---
Kk thanks
---
Not*
---
&gt; Same wife
---
I wish.
---
PC
---
Normal. Will a SB attack a scorched creature?
---
Lvl up to 50 that’s where life get easier. Find a build that suits you such as a melee build or rifleman build. Since your like 20 only go to the ash heap and the place north of the forest I forgot the name. Until you feel like you can deal with large groups of enemies by yourself. Like that’s just a few things there is so many more.
---
Thanks for that image, Uncle Touchy
---
Im willing to bet you have said that more than once on this sub
---
Kk thx
---
I will be completely ecstatic if it's just a set of bunny ears I can wear
---
God I wouldn't mind a nice deathmatch mode instead of that abomination called Survival mode with one based on gear gained and once based on plans your acquired.
---
Who are these boring players always nuking the same places?  Unless I'm farming Queens, I always pick a new spot.  Charleston is fun because of all the glowers in the capital.
---
Not...us...!
---
Maybe someone killed them?  You can kill the bots and they won't respawn.  They might respawn eventually, but I looked off and on for an hour after I killed the BoS bot.
---
PSA: All of the Whitesprings robots will attack if you kill one of the new vendors.  The existing vendors are still invincible.  Also when your teammate asks if the bots can be killed, don't try to find out.
---
&gt; I know it sucks but it's not really that big of a deal
---
I know it sucks but that's not English.
---
"It's not that big a deal" works.
---
That works for any interior area.
---
This happens with me too.
---
Next time get a video recorder out while you on mic &amp; teach them a lesson. Sexual harassment is a serious case and the law works even people are hiding behind their PC or consoles. Bethesda has their billing info that your lawyers can charge &amp; collect :P
---
We have a member named eddiele18 i believe but they woild be able to assist you if youd like
---
Unfortunately not at this time. just so you know though, the Double prefix must be bugged on the Gatling Laser (maybe the Plasma also) as it still only gives 500 per full core, as of right now only Power User seems to increase ammo capacity.
---
Remember this is hundreds of years before fallout 4 and any of the other fallout games this is 25 maybe 28 years after the bombs drop
---
“Give a man a power core he’ll kill for a day, teach a man to harvest power cores he’ll kill for life”
---
I mean it’s sucks when it happens but its the whole point of the game mechanic. You’re not guaranteed junk just because you picked it up. If you don’t store it before entering the event it’s on you. Don’t get upset with people playing the game.
---
sorry that happened to you, it is very annoying, i also think the priority should be fixing server stability and game crashes
---
I play 2 other online all the time games and they never crash, never freeze
---
Could there be a better place maybe but it’s alright it takes time getting used too
---
But that’s only if you get caught? My suggestion is if I can successfully pick your lock without breaking it or back at (avoid a loophole to breaking the pick) I should not be wanted.   Make my stealth build feel more stealthy
---
You know what's especially deadly?  When you lose Well Fed.  If you're in that 20% area for Nerd Rage, losing Well Fed will knock you down to almost 10%.
---
A confirmed workaround is completely shutting down your platform unplugging it for 30 seconds and then restarting. Annoying however you won't miss any of the eggs this way
---
Doesn’t matter, it’s still true.
---
Yeah I know that you can get 'em from Vendors, I was just really seeing if anyone had it as a reward/drop. Thanks though!
---
As I recall, my stats are something on the order of 360 Physical, 320 Energy.  This is with 3 pieces of Vanguard Marine at +150% repair and high health (not my preferred legendary, just what I’ve happened to pick up with 2 pieces being Sentinel). An Assassin’s robot arm and a Chameleon leather leg. Also, 3 levels of Ironclad (whenever I’m PvE, otherwise I’m Fireproofed) and 2 levels of Evasive (swapping with Mr Sandman at night).
---
There's a nice junk point NW of Harper's Ferry that has access to water as well, I have my base there and it's just outside the blast zone.  Look for the electric towers
---
i think he was a character on that tv show Seinfeld
---
Sorry to hear this.  It happened to my buddy and I when we went through our first silo too, and it's something that I actively try to prevent, now that I'm at a higher level.  Its fun to launch a nuke.
---
On another note, [this](https://www.enclavedb.net/nuke-codes) is useful for the codes :D
---
Scorched Mirelurk Queen, deadliest creature in the game IMO
---
I love him. Sometimes I get lead scrap from his broken and destroyed body.
---
pudding! shhhhhhhhh...be silent
---
A lot of people use Excavator with calibrated shocks in nuke zones because it provides the best carry weight and has very good radiation resistance.
---
Why does everyone complain about this gun?? Its my most used weapon. I aim it just fine in 1ST person. It also fires at an adequate rate, its hand cranked.
---
OCRCustoms of the House Customs,First of His Name, the Unburnt, King of the Virginians West and the First Men, TheGresser of the Great Green Forest, Breaker of Chains, and Mother of Deathclaws.
---
True I always forget about those lol but like I said I just want to feel like my stealth build can stay stealthy. If I pick your lock without it breaking I think we should be rewarded by not being wanted, but if I fail we should still be wanted
---
Yeah, some people really are just toxic. Thats not your issue though. If you dont enjoy their company, simply leave.
---
I would advise against going without headset just because people are toxic, because imo the games more enjoyable with audio. Really the choice is yours though. 
---
Good luck adventuring.
---
I get all my flux from the queen. Every now and then I run low on violet for ammo but collect it once the rad zone has gone or if a radstorm just passed. Have been playing the game for a while now and found flux to be quite easy to get and not a real thing to farm.
---
It's painfully obvious I don't have the right legendary weapons for big game. Have yet to get a TSE. Furious, instigating are pretty much it. Oh and A Vampire handmade which I find pretty helpful in drawn out battles. It's just bullet hungry.
---
nope juste a safe walk outside the building or maybe in pvp to fall out of no where
---
Someone data mined an image of a creepy Easter Bunny Head, so that’s the current assumption. 
---
There’s a few of us who will be out of town/AFK for The Easter Holiday that are hoping we can log each other in etc. :)
---
All underground areas in the game are nukable.  I figured that out like a week in.  Charleston is fun to nuke for that reason (think capital building).
---
Deathclaws reproduce sexual not by that asexual bs, in fallout 4 you can see a male and female together or more like infer they where together since you had to kill the mother
---
Buddy and I ran into two queens last night, one was a 3\* So my awesome plan was stay way up on these cliffs and rain down on them because there is no way they can acid shoot this far up...I was very wrong. My 105 level self and 53 level buddy in full PA got smoked hard. We eventually killed them but it took an orbital strike, several nuke grenades, all my 40mm and a lot of 5mm
---
Will set a reminder for this!
---
Oh my notice was on December 4, 2018 and said 4-6 months.
---
Sneak attacks do work in PvP now, after the last patch they started working again.
---
It's a game - play as you see fit. Leechers or not, these elitist are just dudes and they play a video game. Nothing to boast or be proud about in Real Life. It's a frickin game &amp; super easy one too.
---
Completely RNG. No better or worse than WS.
---
That's a great point - didn't think about it from the camp owner perspective.
---
I'd just like to get a server list with a bit of info. FFS, I've been booted so many times halfway through a nuke zone and unable to find another before my flux expires.... it's absurd.
---
I heard it too in my play, but i decided it should be some mutant hound from under textures, lol.
---
That's what I tend to do.
---
There’s a few of us who are sharing logins to get the eggs while we are out on Holiday.
---
If he abandons (drops) it then it's unclaimed and you can take it.  If he places it then it will snap back to his inventory, whether or not he runs off.
---
There is, dense mod and fireproof for most of the heavy explosive damage ones. Tse is low tier now anyway, the people annihilating you super fast are likely using something much better than a TSE.
---
They delivered it to me by mistake, sorry :(
---
The best is what you make it. I have one of each and I mainly use my T45.
---
people dont like low levels joining the queen fight because it’s an end game boss and every extra player adds to her health so it’ll be harder to take her down. stick to the main quests and level up a little until you’re level ~50 and it’ll all get easier
---
I'm sure they mean to, but that's beside the point.  If they already know what to do to fix it, and just need to push out that fix, I'm sure it will be just like they said.  If not, they *need* to figure out what to do before it can be fixed.
---
Sometimes these things are simple, sometimes it takes a lot of digging to figure out what's going wrong.  If it were always easy, we'd have a *lot* less bugs in the game.  Plus, the devs working on this inherited a hot mess that was FO4, and were tasked with turning it into an online game when they had no experience with Fallout to begin with.  Debugging someone else's code, especially one as complicated as this, can be especially frustrating.
---
If you have a hot minute (well, more like 20), [give this old article a read](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/rick_schaut/2004/05/19/anatomy-of-a-software-bug/), it goes into the complexities of working on a difficult bug fix on a big software package. (seriously, it's a *long* story)
---
Pretty sure theyre in floor decor. The stuttering is annoying, I generally get it when there are things being loaded into the world.
---
Khaaaan!
---
I also like to live dangerously...
---
Where is this spot you speak of? What part of the map?
---
I want to torture myself with some sort of FO76 challenge tonight.
---
T-60 is the cheapest to repair, and that's all that matter to me really, the difference between the high tier armors is minute.
---
The first four were good but this one was terrible.
---
There are plenty of toxic people out there, thankfully there are decent people out there too.
---
Do you know the average amount of td per plan and do you drop them one by one or more together?
---
It's really hard if you're solo and no one else is around to keep mobs down.  The problem is some people have minmaxed the shit out of the game and thus think everything is too easy, whereas normal players die to everything, lol...
---
And for people that want to suck and get killed. Terrible PA
---
I don't hate them. In the long run, you won't really be missing anything. 
---
&gt;!.!&lt;
---
&gt;!Other than your SOUL! Mwhahahahahahahahahah!&lt;
---
I've got 3 ranks of fireproof but no dense. 
---
So what are they using? I can hold my own pretty well against anything that isn't crackle crackle respawn.
---
I though they were a male and female, so it doesn't make sense for you to find only one in the nest on the island and there still be eggs around. 
---
There should be at least two, and maybe a rare chance at finding baby Deathclaws? 
---
Sorry if my post wasn't clear on the matter, I though they were sexual (like male/female) but there is only one on the island and it always has eggs around it.
---
i caught the tail end of an HP nuke. Literally tons of flora, but the blast zone faded before i could get any HRF. :(
---
Yeah we do but the rest of the team won’t be on until later
---
Is that good game design though? 
---
PA isn’t necessary as long as you don’t fight the queen in a nuke zone. As long as you never go in a nuke zone to kill glowing enemies for loot. As long as you never try to collect endgame crafting supplies any other way than the queen.
---
I have been there twice and the Violet Flux is great.  My only issue is that when you clear out all the enemies, they do not respawn unless someone new comes over.  I should not have to rely on that to manipulate the spawns.
---
And maybe it is just me but both times I decided to go into The Burrows to see if the Ghouls mutated.  Half of them did but none of them dropped the materials to stabilize Flux.  I had to rely on enemies up top and it was pretty sparse.
---
Fellow girl on PS4 as well! I keep my mic off for this exact reason. I've had two positive encounters where the guys were pretty cool but all the others have been pretty bad. If you're looking for a team mate I'm usually on during the weekend or after uni/work!
---
If you come across enemies that have a misty pink, glowing aura on them, then they are under the control of a Flatwoods Monster.  It reportedly can even take over a Scorchedbeast and make it an ally.  The levitation/propulsion system of its' suit gives off a soft puttering noise that is very distinct and I have usually heard that before I actually saw them.  I have killed four and saw five in 200 levels.  Funny thing is I have never come across one in Flatwoods.
---
Yep. Creating more problems than they fix is Bethesda's specialty.
---
Only the 2
---
I'm not sure how they are getting you to spend money by giving you something for free. Cause, I will either buy something or not buy it based on the item, regardless of what they are giving for free.
---
It doesn't need to be instanced any more than West Tek or the asylum or literally any other dungeon does. It's just a normal interior cell and that's fine.
---
2 so far, 1 released each day at 8PM eastern time.
---
Guess that's the downfall part.
---
I thank you for your contribution to the good fight.
---
Lemme roll over to you so I can buy it
---
Nice to know. Never really paid any attention to that. Or maybe I'm usually "well fed".
---
In my mind, you basically get a token for each star of a Legendary you scrap, and you spend those tokens on upgrades for other weapons.
---
But I'd *really* like to see a formal explanation, because I've got these useless 3\* Legendaries hogging up precious space and I'm really on the verge of selling them all because in the course of the next month (at least, if they don't delay this too), I'm naturally going to find more.
---
Tell me about it I'll
---
I honestly don't expect to actually receive one. They are fairly incompetent.
---
I know they're on floor decor, I watched a video of a guy placing them and I went into floor decor where he went I didn't see them. I know other people are having this issue
---
Cry me a river. That quest was broken and getting all that free food made my survival experience that much easier... not everyone likes having their difficulty impacted by bugs.
---
Dad gaming. Nothing quite like watching the nuke land, pumping yourself full of chems, grabbing your "extra loot capacity" set of excavator, charging into the red fog and hearing "dad, I've done a poo!", which in turn wakes up the baby...  
---
This may be why I've only just hit lv90 and I've been playing since beta!
---
A player that logs in more, especially if they log in and get something from the atom shop(even if it is free) is more likely to buy more in the future.
---
Do you know how decrypting the launch code works? It's not something someone would (or I would suggest) do casually just to launch a nuke that might give you a mutants wood leg piece. The reason we actually can launch nukes is because of the collective "cheating". The launch code decrypting puzzle was so absurdly thrown at you that I actually believe it was done to stretch out playtime. How can people notice broken and unfinished content (at launch this is not the current state) when they cannot access it.
---
I had a similar idea, however I realized that a "safe zone" could (and would) be exploited.  You would get players that would use the zone boundary as a shield to keep from getting killed while attacking others.  Step out of the zone, attack, run back in.  You'd also have the same spawn campers sitting just inside the zone waiting for someone that fast-traveled to run out, they'd then step out, attack, and return waiting for the next victim.
---
It's sad to have to think that way, but you know there would be those that would abuse the zone mechanic just because they could (and they'd tell you to blame it on said mechanic and not them for taking advantage of it).
---
The only way I could see something like this working is instead of a static "safe zone" boundary that toggles pacifist mode, **keep using the personal-invulnerability buff but have that tied to a boundary radius instead of a timer.**  This would ensure that there isn't a mechanic to take advantage of and it would also help those with slower-loading devices as well.  The same "you attack and you lose your invulnerability" would apply as it does now.  This would also allow for trading within those areas without fear of external interference.
---
I don't, however area on with your mic off so you can just listen is a good way to scope people out provided they are on area chat too.
---
I do use the mic but I would say never be afraid to use the ignore, block or report functions if you are getting grief.
---
To add on that I have a great bunch of women gamers on Fallout 76 and all on PS4 so if you'd like to join us, and the guys in our wider group, ping me a message. We're Europe, USA and Canada based, mix of levels, play styles and backgrounds.
---
I agree. Who put the bounty on you if you werent caught?
---
This. It's the stagger that just makes me go 'Ah sheeet'
---
How do people not notice this stuff? Lol.
---
I gave no idea what you're referencing
---
&gt;100% on this.
---
Thanks man! You made me days.
---
Well, unless it's changed, it should be like directly north of abbies  bunker I think. It's not marked, but it's in a marsh.
---
Can't get home for like 30 hours to log in for 30 seconds? Lol
---
Outstanding Soldier!
---
hmmm, I disagree. You log in once, you get your free egg. Once you have your free egg, you don't need to log in again for 24 hours. 
---
I think more likely they are trying to get players to login, and once in, they will likely play for a little while, driving the number of people playing up. 
---
Which seems like something they would want.
---
Great idea
---
Its all Gatling energy weapons
---
&gt;... I screwed that build up royally. I wish there was a way to just reset it
---
You pick so many useless card early on, my guy could be another 15-20% more effective if I'd "roughed it" with my first few upgrades.
---
Oh, that's why I saw the flowery one again last night, I checked two early. Thanks man.
---
For my build, luck of the draw is not an option as that would be a reduction in crit damage/frequency. But prior to switching to a crit build, gun smith rank 5 was vastly superior to luck of the draw rank three. The added bonus is that with a rank 5 of gun smith you can do all your own mods.
---
He didn't drop it, he just hopped out of it after he punched 3 ghouls to death and then ran off. 
---
Isn't it still claimed as his at that point? Otherwise users could easily steal power armor from each other.
---
Did we just become friends? :D
---
Well, it's not really being fair to say something like that. But I get your point. 
---
But that has nothing to really do with what the subject of this thread. Unless you are saying that people looting other people's stuff shouldn't be part of the game.
---
Yay
---
I assumed as much, thanks for the confirmation 👍
---
Favorite spot to CAMP.
---
My soul is already missing. That's why I try to fill that whole by buying stupid things like limited time Easter eggs in a video game.  Easter eggs that I can use only my "house" build in a video game. Easter eggs that I probably will never use.  
---
And it still makes me sad because here I am with my wallet asking to take my money. But they don't take it. It's like I am so repulsive that they won't even take my money.
---
The regular MLQs are ok, the scorched ones are real bullet sponges. Encountered one yesterday, a three star legendary took me lots of minigun time and bunch of stimpaks to take her down and got a piece of one-star armor junk. Definitely more HP than level 80 SBs.
---
That you know of.
---
I can kill them if I catch them out of stealth boy. But once they know I’m around it’s just a bunny hop fest or chameleon wait/hide... I don’t use explosive so I can’t kill them as easy as they can me not only that it has longer reach then a rifle with out explosive because of the spread of the shotgun and the AoE of the explosive.  I don’t mind explosive it’s just not the playstyle I want. Remove explosive from shotties and autos. It’s still overpowered on these weapons. A shotgun should be close quarters w/ anti armor and shit unless it has a “slug mod” even then it doesn’t go to far.
---
Overall x-01 has best stats for nuke running
---
Excavator best carry weight with shocks 
---
T-51b highest balistic and energy resistance.
---
10 000 spoons and all you need is knife??
---
thats not ironic that is piss poor planning bud,
---
having said that still love you Alanis
---
I'm a girl who plays a guy.  I don't use the mic.  I just go around helping where I can. Giving away things I craft.  If someone bothers me I block and server hop.  Don't have time for negativity.
---
That’s what I said? I said they are trying to get people to log in more.
---
I don't, but variety is the spice of life as they say.
---
Atom card paint would be cool
---
So, are there different benefits to certain PAs? Like I recently got the ability to build X-01 PA. Is there something special about it!? Or the Ultracite?
---
I mean, I'm fine with that.  Keep those types out of Adventure.  I'm just here to have fun and work together like the Overseer wanted.
---
Yea dude good call. I’m working on fireproof now - does dense negate all explosive damage? Is fireproof and dense overlap?
---
Make a group and share Rad Sponge 3.  You'll be fine.
---
Hey I'm on ps4 and play with some guys and another female very weird but respectful bunch you ever need some girl time hit me up. I'm married with kids and some times it's hard to find people to play with. My psn is gofukyurslf326 lol I know very lady like but people tend to think twice than to send me inv's lol
---
That's how it should be. But it's the age of Youtube said game-Youtube/reddit content--&gt; apply said tips guides to first playthrough---&gt; Proceed to feel like a god because "you" did it all and tell others what they should do.
---
I feel that trying to do something yourself is more rewarding but will put you behind a lot of other people that follow up on content creator tips. In rare cases, you might actually find out a new thing or hidden item/solution. But that's rare.
---
As a man who trusts not the evil humor of Bethesda I have put up a small cell where I shall place these eggs. That way, just in case they do hatch, the surrounding turrets will keep them in line.
---
That sucks you missed out on completing the quest. Not sure if there was any communication, but that player did save you a launch key card by launching it himself. (which is actually a good thing) But of course, he got to pick the spot which isn't fair.    
---
In a different situation, his launching the nuke would actually be sorta helpful. Still rude.
---
To the best of my knowledge, there was never a damage buff to crafted weapons (100+CND) over looted (&lt;100% CND). Assuming the lvl and mods are identical.
---
If you dont want full investment in heavies, find a weightless one. But if you are like me though and the plasma Gatling is a staple for you, stockpiling plasma cores with Batteries Included is a must. I'm sitting on 300 cores, which is 75,000 rounds which weights 30 lbs. Not bad for me.
---
There is no individual pool any more, it’s all shared. 1400 caps.
---
Do you know how many Death Tambos I’ve picked up and as soon as you said jingles, it registered that this is made out of a tambourine 😱🤦‍♀️  I had a huge OH!! moment!  😂  🥴
---
I just carry an extra gun
---
What level is the cultist blade?
---
Gee I wonder why you have so many downvotes.
---
I use gunsmith 2 and luck of the draw 3. I can not remember ever having to fix a gun.
---
No, thank you though
---
I'm WAY more afraid of those Mr. Gutsys that use the single shot rifle that deals like five times as much damage as a scorchbeast blast.
---
Record them, even if on your phone, and then you can report them to both Sony and Bethesda.
---
They don't deserve to be online.
---
*Lvl 10,000 Legendary Deathclaw has entered the chat*
---
*Your Camp disconnects*
---
Thanks for your input. I don't use VATS so I don't have your crit problem! Also I have a full Gunsmith card for modding, and others with fewer points I use in my fighting builds.  
---
&gt; gun smith rank five was vastly superior to luck of the draw rank three  
---
I have the same feeling, but I'm sure someone made scientific tests about that!
---
Why do we hate Juicehead? He puts out videos on the game, gives them a fair shake and that’s it. He’s pretty damn positive about the game and when he criticizes it he’s pretty fucking fair. He doesn’t clickbait or anything, he’s not Yongyea, he just puts out some nice content. (IMO of course)
---
Fireproof and dense do work together and negate most if not all explosive damage. I can shoot a mini nuke at my foot and take zero damage, I can shoot a bloodied explosive shotgun with 600 dmg at my feet and take zero dmg also.
---
I loot any bag I find. Sorry guys, but it's not like you put your name on it.
---
My friend plays and to hear some of her stories of jaskassery is kinda funny...she finds them funny and she's got really fast with the block button for the annoying ones
---
Max lvl.
---
Is the one out now the one that was supposed to be out yesterday? Because it was the same one as the day before all the times I checked...
---
Delete some friends I was stuttering cause I had too many irk why but it works
---
I will wait till ur team full! If u will have space in party - msg me! Appreciate
---
Well In nature you have one parent go get food and another watch the nest and assuming deathclaws do this too the other deathclaw is always out getting food. There’s probably just one because lower lvl’s are  terrified to go against one let alone two. But I do agree with you that there should be two deathclaws their occasionally 
---
     Well the baby deathclaws do exist but in like FNV and maybe 1 and 2. And to have baby deathclaws you would need a few deathclaws protecting them. But just one baby would work for that area
---
No, I don't stay off mic.  I'm almost 40 and still get stupid little boys who think it's cute to be disgusting.  So I kill them.  Repeatedly.  While telling them how their mother would be ashamed of their behavior and that they can do better than this.
---
Ignoring it doesn't make it go away.  Ignoring a problem removes you from the situation but they'll keep doing what they thought was acceptable.  Call them out.  "Your comments are unwarranted and disgusting.  If you want to keep friends or teammates, stop running your mouth."
---
Ok thanks! I'll try it
---
Asshole, you can get it up to 1000 and still lethal take rads, that's what I'm talking about. But no mind go ahead and ignore substantive discourse in favor of winning cheap insults. You're not clever.
---
Ok I’ll take it. I won’t be on until 5pm est but give me ur psn and I’ll add u through the app.
---
Thats all it showed on the list
---
&gt; Half of them did but none of them dropped the materials to stabilize Flux.
---
HRF and Mass only drops if enemies die in the irradiated nuke zone.  For example at WS if you kite enemies outsize the zone and kill them they don't drop the stuff you need to stabilize flux.
---
Because the truth hurts.
---
The whole point of it is to get people to log on every day. So maybe try that?
---
That would be fun. I have a two shot primed crossbow that I use for fun but it isn’t practical, even with all the relevant perks maxed and equipped. You could get a crossbow with the explosive prefix on it but that’s about it.
---
My psn is ak56thethird add me if you’d like
---
Fuck em, don't stay off the mic. If dudes on here cant control themselves because they realized they are in the presence of the opposite sex that says significantly more about them than you haha. 
---
Personally, I cant think of a time that it made a bit of difference if I found out the person I was playing with or encountered was male, female or anything else they wanted to be, but I have seen and heard plenty of players for whom the same couldn't be said. I would advise against ostracizing yourself on account of the actions of others, if only because I think it kind of reinforces some divide that shouldn't exist in the first place.
---
I once looted some paper bags by accident during the Fastnacht Event. People started fast traveling when someone opened fire on the group but there were bags everywhere (all the high level players would usually drop stuff before leaving) so I made a dash to see what they left and took some stuff but then realized that someone had been downed. As soon as I realized my mistake I wanted to give it all back but didn't see anyone on the ground and didn't know what I had taken in the commotion. 
---
My point: it might not have been completely intentional, but if it was, that is a dick move...
---
It's random - from knight to knight SGT got within 3 days (5-8 quest a day), then Officer took me more than weekend and similar amount of time from Officer to paladin.
---

---
They're definitely not everywhere. Just... Pay attention to them as you move through the game.
---
(I documented every instance of crows I found in a couple playthroughs. I won't say anything else unless you ask, but there's a very clear lore behind them.)
---
You have done gods work sir
---
I cant do this either. Have 3 unyielding pieces and it will allow 5* perk cards for like hardly any time then they timeout.
---
Itd be nice to have a workaround available.
---
My gf plays with a woman avatar, but keeps her mic off unless she's on a team. One of my best friends is another woman who is extremely good at Fallout 76, she's almost level 300. She also uses her mic mainly on team chat. I have had experiences where my women friends are harassed by male gamers and they're completely fine and normal to me when I fast travel in to have their back. It's just regular old sexism, and it's gross.
---
Find some fun team mates and stay in team chat, you'll have a great time.
---
Really, BGS should just hire me to fix all their code issues. Just sayin'.  That's my main point when I post here.  Lol
---
I'm aware that's what you said.  My counter argument, if it wasn't clear due to phrasing it as a sarcastic comment, is that if they make the game mechanics work in such a way that the aftereffects mere moments after a nuclear blast will cause lethal amounts of radiation that is somewhat difficult to mitigate, then I don't actually think that is wholly a bad gameplay mechanic.
---
Ok. Just the Cultist blade? PSN str8upnobs
---
Happened to me during my first nuke, I was looking up the code and a guy I had met in my camp earlier said that he would nuke my camp if I didn’t let him launch it. Joke was on him though, I played dumb and let him launch it, then joined a team with him and found where his camp was, went there and left the team, then dropped 3 orbital strikes on his camp. Worth the bounty.
---
If you are on Survival, you can get a pretty good idea of how many there are by looking through the leader lists.  Whatever your position is in each category means there's at least that many other players there.
---
This, it's coming. It seems like this suggestion is reaching the front page every day now. That stuff has been datamined, and the 100 days roadmap even confirms that we will be able to decorate our camp with stash items. 
---
Some streamers are under the impression that we can display EVERYTHING from the game world, so they have collected teddybears, toys and stuff, but personally, i think they are hyping something up way too far. But we'll see..
---
&gt;33 minutes ago, player offered TSE minigun for 8k

&gt;  
---
&gt;10 minute ago, player offered 3 TSE guns  
---
&gt;48 minutes ago, double barrel TSE for 11k  
---
&gt;3 hours ago, player asked TSE Gatling for Caps, hour later already had reply.  
---
&gt;7 hours ago, TSE was sold for caps, max bid was 7k

&gt;14 hours ago, TSE lever sold for 11k  
---
&gt;15 Hours ago, TSE Gauss went for 20k
---
You see, TSE aint that hard to get.
---
That isn't the problem, the problem is that this kind of just dropped out of nowhere, a little preemptive post in the changelog would've been nice
---
I would like other options for nukezones too. Mods for hazmats, 1 star drops of hazmat suits? At the moment it's just way more convenient to farm glowing mass etc slightly after the rad zone has gone. Plus after a few nuke zones flux loses it's value quickly.
---
I would love to see more reasons or options to fight in a nukezone yeah. There just isn't a need for it. When I go in there I can farm glowing ones with escape artist, hazmat suit and silencer. 
---
If there was more to do in zone I would argue we need more than PA yes. At the same time I would feel silly strolling in a zone with normal armor hehe. Also the collecting can be done for a few hours after the nuke zone has gone from the map.
---
Bloodied builds should have a downside, you want to remove that.
---
Thankyou so much for that heads up that's really useful :)
---
I've been lucky, I haven't had any issues in the game because of being female. I have a group of people I've been playing with on and off since release that are all guys, it's never been an issue. We've had other guys and other girls pass through our extended group of FO76 buddies, and any issue anyone has ever had with another player was never because of their gender. Which, quite frankly, is how it should be. Even just random interactions with other players, no one's ever bothered me. I'd tell you to come pal around with us, but we're all xbox users.
---
That's a solution I consider too, but for now, I have one great weapon, the rest is shit. I tried using my sidearm and melee more, but it feels like I'm forcing myself to use them.
---
Awesome awsome awsome! Thanks for this!
---
They should let gas masks act as hazmat suits for nuke zones so people can still use armor
---
I just use the mic with other friends in party / private chat.
---
I play solo and I usually stay off mic unless I have to say something which is rare
---
The problem with a scientific test is that they do two different things. For me, carrying two guns (at least), gun smith rank 5 and the minuscule cost of weapons repair (especially when the time between is extended by GS) is the winning combo. 
---
The problem for me with luck of the draw is that its proc rate was not all that consistent and the amount it repairs pales in comparison to that sweet 200% I can get at a bench with a little perk card dancing.
---
People are dicks sometimes. My gf and I found that if you just straight up ignore someone (I know, sounds cliche), then it doesn't give them a platform to stand on. All they want is your attention, and they go away if you don't give them that.
---
We had some guy attacking the camp we were making and saying stupid crap to us while we were building. My gf said to ignore him, so after some angry emotes we did just that. He said "I'm not going anywhere," then promptly left three minutes later.
---
I never got hassled in fo76 because I don't mic, my Bethesda name isn't gendered, and female toons are common, so it's no concern, I look like anyone else.
---
I get grief and crazy threats here on reddit, but never in fo76.
---
Evil twin attack :O
---
Well if it means that much to you and it's just some cosmetic item, if you're on Xbox you can have mine
---
Ahh...reduced weight FM..see!!
---
Sure thx!
---
All the skinned atom shop beds are too small.. The normal ones are kid sized, so i guess i will always use my vault-tec double bed. I don't get why they don't re-skin that one instead.
---
Yeah I ran out of buns.
---
That's easy you're op
---
so if it reads only 500 maybe it has the same effect as power user where it reduces the drain rate.  have you tried testing it to see how many shots you actually get off per ammo counter?
---
I’m a fellow female gamer, but on Xbox. I’ve been lucky with the people I’ve met. I mainly play with 2 guys and another girl. Another group I play with are just guys. And they’re all really great!  I’ve yet to across your situation, but if I did I’d just block them and switch worlds. I go on there to relax and have fun, not deal with that bs.  It it’s amazing how many times I’ve had guys say Wow it’s a girl!!!  Like we are a unicorn or something!
---
Honestly, I’ve never actually had a problem? I switched over to Xbox a few years ago and I just think the community is a bit better. (Or I’m lucky?) I used to get nonstop harassed in lobbies on the ps4 :/
---
You said the more they log in the more likely they are to spend atoms and even money on Aron’s, did you not?
---
Ok.
---
I don't really have the same issues with my laser gatling, it works fine, but the gatling plasma.... Blegh. Gatling plasma was my main weapon until recently when it started dumping entire cores for no reason, and the stalling after reload is horrible. I'll be having to find new weapons or change builds if they don't fix this
---
So im curious, did you use a preset face? If not that's wild.
---
I didn't say that. Im wanting a means of keeping the strong bosses off of my guys that can one shot most people even bloodied.
---
I think my camp is right next to where you put yours!
---
Same but I lose interest when there is nothing to lose and everyone just fast travels out of sight all the time. Was hoping for survival to give me the same feeling that games like dayz mod and other survival games did. Survival mode does a great job at making you travel by foot. So much of the map has no use in adventure for me.
---
Using bear arms. Heavy weapons are.. Well.. Heavy.
---
So its about as useless as Stalkers on a melee weapon.
---
I have to many other people’s souls to ever really feel sad again.
---
But I am an artist who sells stuff with my artwork on it if your looking for other ways to spend money on filling your soul hole.
---
Not a girl, but one I play with often avoids using her mic exactly for that reason
---
I have to admit, I love 76, but the bugs are really hard to ignore, because they're in EVERYTHING.  And then BGS fails with its version control (regularly) so old fixes come undone.  I often wonder how much their coders are getting paid based on how much broken stuff makes it to the final product.  It's not that we don't appreciate it.  It's that we expect more from BGS than shoddy product.  And if they want to hire me to fox out and fix their code issues, I'm not opposed.  Lol
---
&gt; are Deathclaws A-sexual?
---
The Followers of the Apocalypse dispatched researchers to study the mating habits and reproduction of Deathclaws but they have not been heard from of since.
---
But the cosmetic isn't transferable if it's in the atomic shop, it's fine though, I'm just a little salty
---
hahaha damn. i like this story
---
It would be nice if the Rad Resistant perk was altered to work as a percentage reduction similar to how Fireproof was changed. Doing that would also add another useful perk to the Endurance cards, which they're sorely lacking.
---
If you are on Xbox I can build one in your camp for you.
---
Well done!
---
Pretty sure vintage champagne is 100 rr
---
PSA: Empty your junk before running off to certain death.
---
I'm not disagreeing that loot grabbing is a dick move but it's totally avoidable.
---
Three of us did it post patch 7, teamed up, all had nuke cards, but only one launched. We all completed the quest.
---
I still haven’t gotten the second one 🤷‍♀️
---
Not all of them! Some evac'd!
---
&gt;They screwed up that risk when they failed to properly QA and let dupers roam free for months.
---
Also a woman here. I am playing with the mic on (except when there is too much ambient noise in the room, so i turn it off in order not to annoy the players around me). I am almost 190, on PC, and i until now i didnt have a negative experience. :)
---
I really hop they do soon. I just picked up my dream gatling plasma (furious explosive gatling plasma with 90% weight reduction) and its frustrating to use lol. Soooooo stoked for this gun and right when I get it something like this happens 😒
---
Crafted weapons don't have more damage, they do have more durability if you have the right perks/enough intelligence.
---
I struggled with carry weight for a long time. In fact, I kind of still do, but I have figured out a way to manage it, though it does add a couple rather tedious steps to my game. 
---
Every time I want to fast travel, I switch out my 3 slugger perks in Strength for Bear Arms, Strong Back, and Armor #2. Then I switch out Born Survivor #3 with Thru Hiker. After that, I can fast travel. Once I get to where I will be in combat, I switch them all back. I play overencombered, but I use Action Girl to regen my AP more quickly. 
---
I wear X01 Power Armor only. I sold my Excavator Armor a long time ago as I didn’t like the way it looked. But my X01 has Cal Shocks, which gives me an extra 100 in carry weight anyway. 
---
But that’s just me. Your mileage may vary.
---
Definitely needs to be a thing now that we can rename items in our inventory.
---
There's also a bug that's existed since release where if you die just after having gotten a mutation, the mutation can disappear from your list and be completely inaccessible until you cure it (even though it doesn't show in your Effects), and I lost 2000 caps buying a serum that didn't work to try to fix it.  BGS gave me the standard "we can't do shit" response.  How long will that be an acceptable excuse?
---
But that’s true. Whether or not you personally feel that way. Someone that logs on more IS more likely to buy real money items. That is literally the whole theory behind games as a service. 
---
Their first goal is to get people to log in. We are both in agreement there. The only difference is that I was then talking about their secondary goal; to get those players logging in to spend money.

---
Lol! I imagine you let him rant and rave abit before you confessed? I personally don't think there's anything wrong with picking up loot bags after an event and no one else is around.  The spawn point is right there and it's not like they have to trek from across the map. All loot bags are fair game by design, it's just proper etiquette to allow the original owner to reclaim if possible, but alot of players don't understand anything about fair play or courtesy anyway.  I think the main gripe here is about the lazy scumbags that don't help with the event, who skulk around on the fringes like jackals and hyenas, hoping for a big score.
---
Agree. I have that card maxed out but I'm about to take it out of my build and use those four points somewhere else. Currently they are a waste.
---
Bravo, my dude! 🤘🏻
---
Yes. Thats exactly why im sitting on 8 atm.. Or id certainly have more 😂😂
---
Dumbass, the issue is the displayed Resist number - in the pip boy, 1000 from Chems/Armor protects you less than 500 from a damaged hazmat suit. I didn't say anything about difficulty.
---
Good points!
---
However, how is it possible that a multi-billion dollar AAA developer with hundreds of employees, working on nothing but this game, makes an "error" like this? Did noone care to test this before it went live?! Or did noone care that it did go live like this? It's not like this bug is totally weird and obscure... as OP stated, it affects one of the most essential parts of the game and anyone playing 76 even in the most casual way is bound to notice this rather sooner than later.
---
Taking one's time to fix complicated bugs is one thing. Not causing complicated bugs in the first place is another!
---
Calm down Preston
---
The community is very mixed on this one, but that's kind of good news for you. Less people to compete against when you nuke, but fewer to scale things up for more legendary.
---
Mother of god
---
Now that's what I call a KNiFE!
---
They said the higher star ratings your gear has, the more likely you will get your desired effect when rerolling. That doesn’t make sense if we can reroll any of the effects. If I have a 1-star junkies tire iron, I only need to try a few rollings until I get my stalkers. There are only very limited tier 1 effects. The chance is actually higher than a 2 star one where I want to change the 2nd effect from +1 luck to +1 perception. 
---
If they don’t allow us to choose any of the effects, and completely go RNG, they will need to sell tokens at the atom shop, because completely RNG is just like farming at WS after all, the chance to get the ideal combo is extremely low. Only difference is you only stare at one mole miner while doing it, instead of ghouls of all shapes and sizes.
---
I have gunsmith 3 and luck of the draw 2. It's a mixed bag. Luck of the draw procs for me fairly often, but I still repair my handmade at least once every 3-4 hours (I generally do it when condition looks like it's around 85 percent). I'd probably be better off with more in gunsmith, but I don't want to take more points in intelligence.
---
how can they answer these questions when they themselves don't even know?
---
I love how gamers need the obvious stated for them these days. If they don't see it on YouTube, it's inconceivable.  
---
Nuking it was the first thought I had when I heard it was going to be added.  Catch up, people.
---
Well, you sure as shit never said anything about comparing it to a 500 resist hazmat suit, that's for damn certain.
---
system?
---
I didn't use PA in FO4, but I sure as hell collected it and had a huge display room with every type of PA in the game.  Same with weapons.  I'm not sure what that would do to the build budget and stash limits, but it would be awesome.
---
Good point. They could more easily just make it so there was MORE viable spots to farm.
---
what platform?  Apologies if this is obvious to everyone but me.
---
downvoting out of frustration? &lt;3 lu
---
Never understood the mentality of harassing female gamers. Let them do their thing, same as you'd let any male gamer.
---
Two actually if you include Prizebot.
---
Didn't think I had to break it down for you, do you not know what the term nominal means?
---
Yea meant along the lines remove paper bags but just from Adventure mode, love me some casual playing.
---
I also use the mic only when playing with friends and family.  I’ve never had a problem with anyone other than griefers in FO76.  Almost everyone is friendly, though I have had a few people be surprised that I was female and 50 hrs old.
---
I’m curious, PM me?
---
I don't think I've seen "500 resist hazmat suit" in a definition of the word, no.
---
Had not seen that, so thank you for linking that together!
---
I would be happy just to hear people talk tbh
---
Ever since losing most of my junk in survival, I just play the suicide high DPS dealer whenever Encryptid comes up fully expecting to die 10-12 times in the event, but I can usually single handedly deal with 1 HP bar atleast
---
Which is fine. That's what the PvP server is for. Not sure why anyone at 100+ level would want to team up with another such player so that they could target a level 11 player, destroy her camp, and try to provoke her to fight back, so they could kill her. It's asinine.
---
Thanks man !!!!!
---
Maybe? It would have to be a glowing animal though. And even then, I doubt it.
---
I’ll kill your chickens and chicks and eat them.
---
Game runes at 30 fps with an I7 8700k and 1060 6gb on windowed...
---
That seriously sucks. As a male gamer with lots of female friends who are true gamers (and not attention seeking twitch streamers) I get pretty frustrated when I hear/see stuff like this.  The gaming community as a whole can be toxic - especially the kids and those who act like kids - but it’s especially bad for women. I’m very sorry you’ve got to deal with bullshit like that. Thankfully it’s pretty easy to block and mute toxic players. 
---
You shouldn’t have to do that, but at least you have that option. Whatever you do, don’t let toxic players dictate the way you choose to enjoy the game. I hope your experiences are better from here on out
---
Trust man it's less about making massive buildings and more about the interiors, giving them a more lived in effect.
---
I would have tried, but as of right now there seems to be a bug plaguing heavy energy (maybe Ballistics too?) weapons! Ammo from the core is not being calculated properly and ammo is being lost.
---
Basically what's happening is from a core with say 342 shots left, on the 341 shot the core is drained and all remaining ammo is lost. Seems to be random when the core will lose the remaining shots also.
---
People have also stated something similar with the 50.Cal, Minigun, &amp; Gatling gun, but I have not witnessed that at first hand. I have noticed the energy weapons bugging out though, right after they made the usefully too :(
---
If you're on PS4 I'd love to challenge you to a duel. I don't believe 99.5% of players die to you.
---
Heck, I'd just like to be able to rejoin the same server when DCd, even if not day to day (which might be hard with the cap). On PC, we don't have proper chat or text chat embedded, but when playing most online games it was important to be able to stay on the same server if one wanted.
---
Have the 2MM electromagnetic cartridges?
---
How many?
---
How many per cap?
---
Ok, not bad, but there's more to it than that... we're those xbox pc or ps4? Were they the gun you need?  Sure you can find "a tse" for sale but I know I don't consider a pump shotgun on ps4 "available" when I need a handmade on PC.  so they're a little harder to get than your comment would imply.  But it looks like they are available for some people in some situations for sure.
---
They can't do that. People would see the truth how low player population is. Fanatic Bethesda fans are still in faith that this game has millions of players and more are coming every day. Real numbers are more like few thousands and that number decreases day by day. Population is going to be so low soon that it isn't even worth to update game, because there is not enough paying customers. Few fanatic fans and their wallets can't save this train wreck.
---
I guess I don't understand the stigma of women playing. We're all playing to have fun. I am usually just on party chat so I don't have to listen to that crap. Always looking for friends to play with if you want someone to have your back just PM.
---
We just barely crossed the 4 month mark...no way anyone sees on until summer
---
Now that's a good though. Also I wish we could change colors for neon lights.
---
You have Survival mode, Adventure mode is all about cooperating not being jerks to one another, I love my fellow vault dwellers who I lived with for the last 50 years in the vault and just because Im outside doesn't mean I'm going to steal all you gained for the last few hours or stab you in the back.
---
Fair point, but in my defense, there easily could have been the situation where the nuke wouldn’t effect the Burrows since it’s an interior cel that requires a load screen. Going through the launching nuke motions just to see if it’s viable would have been a waste of time. Because Rifle did it on YT first, with video evidence, we now know it’s worth it. 
---
Though I may have 650 some odd hours in thus infernal game, it doesn’t mean I want to waste time experimenting to see if something is worth doing. That time can be spent doing more important things like farming Whitesprings and throwing the vast majority of the crap legendary stuff I get into the river. ;)
---
Wouldn't it be grand if you could place any explosive in your bag when you die that goes off when someone tries to loot it
---
Dude I've been modding bethesda games for over 10 years. You're using tools made to give you an easier time creating something on an engine that already exists with assets you already have. 
---
It's not uncommon to see mod creators be so full of themselves like you seem to be. But you're not making anything more complex than the vanilla game that you're using as a base.
---
And creating a game with RPG maker or free unity from humble bundle does not make you a game developer.
---
Give it a rest.

i wasnt sure of what materials it takes to make them, so a type of

probably different types of flux depending on what type of serum it is..

thanks for your reply!
---
This really goes double for any of us non-female gamers too. Don’t let others’ offhanded comments slide. Ever. 
---
In addition, nearly every single younger gamer I have met in FO76 has told me that I am an amazing and holy individual simply because I didn’t embarrass them, ignore them, or shout expletives at them. That is not the FO76 world (or any other world for that matter) that I want. We all play our parts in policing the bs.
---
Yeah, there are 3 (that I am aware of) that have been added with the latest live update. There is the Burrows and 2 new cryptid quests. Both have their own rewards.
---
Lol!  That would be a great thing I think.  Imagine the posts it would generate the next day.
---
That’s really a fundamental change in the game. I like the idea of competing for resources.
---
Oh I know the importance of it, I just can't afford it, I'm always broke in this game
---
Then you shouldn't have an issue when I theoretically downvote your shitpost and reply with a shitpost of my own. I love having discussions on this sub but am not going to put in the effort if I don't think someone will reply in kind.
---
Yall realize your about 180 years off right?
---
My wife plays and so far she plays 50/50 with the mic off ... and rarely in world chat ... usually with in chat with me or her brother.
---
There are a lot of immature young men and unfortunately old men who should know better out there but don’t rule us all out , some of us have honor
---
The studio that worked on the game is *small* compared to what you'd think a AAA game had.  Bethesda Game Studios Austin was formerly an indy developer (Battlecry Studios) who had laid off a substantial part of their staff prior to being brought in to Bethesda.  AND they had no prior experience with Fallout before starting work on FO76.
---
Having worked in a multi-division company in a prior life, I can tell you that it's common for groups in the same company working on different projects to have little to do with each other in any way.  I doubt seriously that the larger Bethesda organization gave much in the way of support to Bethesda Austin in developing FO76 (as they have bigger projects currently going on that they're more focused on).
---
It's a small, very likely understaffed developer who got FO76 as a side project to put out something quickly while bigger projects got most of the focus from the greater Bethesda execs.
---
I've heard (rumors mostly) that they did have a sizeable QA team at one point, but I've personally found no evidence of it, and the current situation leads me to believe that this may in fact not be the case (or isn't any more).
---
It only rerolls edibles I believe. You can only search animals too I believe. So depending what you're farming, you want be able to use it.
---
I thought it was a glitch in PVP but I suppose that makes more sense!
---
I used to sort of feel like you should just mute them and move on. Don’t even give them the time of day. After all, that’s what I do when I get grief in an online game. There are some people just like that. 
---
But then as I think about it, I realize that it’s not the same. It’s not just a kid griefer being a griefer.  You are getting targeting and harassed simply for being who you are as a person. And that’s not cool. I’ve made some comments in the past that showed me that I really didn’t get it before. But I get it now.
---
As far as I can tell, the places you are talking about are all set spawn points, which cannot produce tameable creatures. It absolutely must be a random spawn point and the creature must be completely solo. If Mirelurks always spawn there, then it is not a random spawn.
---
I found the bunny head in the armor bench under unlockable items. When you click on it, it takes you to the eggs in the atomic shop. Big ol goofy bunny head missing an ear I believe.
---
"Asks"🤣🤣🤣🤣
---
When are we going to see these type of posts die out? It's just annoying seeing 50 different variations of "thank you bethesda" or "best community EVER" on the front page every single day.
---
i'm on pc andyeah they do, if not to my twink then to my main. i believe bloodied/heavy weapons/crit build is the best there is. 
---
Close range is cal .50 time (bloodied/explosive/-25%vats costs), medium and long bloodied/explosive gatling and long range bloodied/explosive harpoon gun (flechette mod).
---
There is nothing you can do about getting constantly critted or been shot with a harpoon gun which does 1500 damage over a long distance.
---
they only players i really die often to are the ones spamming stealthboys.
---
I feel like xbox has a more varied player base, so it makes for a more accepting environment. 
---
I'm on PC and it's a neckbeard and 12 year old wasteland. I'm probably going to switch to xbox for the next online game I play.
---
Fuuuuuuuck I dropped 150 the other day. I'll keep an eye out. I feel bad for just ditching them now.
---
I have a lv30 pet mirelurk king at my camp that consistently wins 3-4v1 fights against lv 60+ super mutants LOL
---
But worth every penny. A friend tells me *ahem*
---
If an area spawns less than 6 enemies it's really not worth the effort and caps to travel to that location. I don't know what the legendary spawn probability is, but spots like the Generals Steakhouse rarely spawn any legendaries and there is a guaranteed 8 enemies that spawn there. The spawn rate either needs to be increased to make this lesser populated areas more appealing or they need to increase the amount of enemies.
---
After that last update I haven't been able to find 3* legendary loot and it's infuriating. I can't believe they took Fallout 4 and took it this route. Grinding for legendaries should be fun......not a tedious task.
---
boy... how do I say it to you....
---
Remember Dr. Braun and his work in the Vault? ... yeah... Fallout 76 is just a simulation... all of this stuff happend a long time ago and was just stored in here all the time. Wonder why people in the Dev Room didnt find the Chinsese Invasion Programm....
---
It also wouldn't be a problem if they had access to the atom shop, or a supporting app to go with it.
---
Seems like yet another missed oppourtunity for BGS.
---
God bless you
---
I suspect they will make the token type-specific. They KNOW their existing legendary pool is largely garbage melee and wood armor junk, if they all of a sudden allow people do exchange their three star rolling pins for good tokens and use that tokens to get their explosive handmade, their higher end weapons will be watered down by their massive amount of low ends and become worthless. 
---
Currently people grind hard to try to get top tier stuff, if they allow exchanging garbage for tokens and use the same token to buy (reroll) higher end stuff, the game becomes very easy. I’ve got way more rolling pins  but only a couple of explosive handmades. If I could exchange my rolling pins for tokens and use those tokens to get my handmades, I would have gotten those handmades long before I picked up from ghouls’ corpses in real grinding, plus a shit load of other god tier stuff, from my rolling pins.
---
Do i want to know why you have 100 super stims?
---
Well the stuff in the Atomic Shop doesn’t change that much. Usually during Atomic Shop offers everything else stays the same. So if there’s nothing there you want, I doubt people are going to get something.
---
What you are saying is basically true regardless of if they are giving away free stuff or not.
---
It’s really more dependent on how frequently they add stuff. And I’ll back that up by how many people post about wanting to know if the Atomic Shop has new items.
---
It’s what’s in the shop that matters over how frequently someone logs in,
---
Because I can login over and over and never go to the Atomic Shop.
---
I don’t understand why some guys are like that im sorry tho
---
There is something wrong with hunting rifles numbers.
---
Here are the perks i'm using. https://i.imgur.com/k50owa2.jpg

If i set the Weapon-specific boost to 60%, bloody mess to rank 1 and tank killer to tank 3 the calculator it will say my damage is 137.76.

The in-game inventory tells me i have 146 damage.

Adrenal reaction shouldn't be triggered on since i made sure to be at 100% HP. Adrenaline perk is at 0 kills so no boost from there either.
---
I don't know where i'm getting that extra 10 points of damage. If i'm missing something really obvious i'm really sorry for wasting everyones time.
---
This is correct.  They are unaffected.  You don’t have the option to search more.
---
True. I think that’s why they are putting free items in there. To at least get people to click on it and have a look.
---
Same as us?
---
I feel like there's a copy pasta somewhere that these people are pulling from and then it's just a fill in the blanks.
---
This is true. I'm on PC and pretty much no one has their mic on. I know the wasteland is lonely but not like this.
---
 Full BoS Heavy Combat runs around 325 325 5 or so. That's just the armor, no Legendary effects, although a lot of mine is now.
---
This was pretty much my experience last night. 
---
I dropped the nuke and stopped to pick some violet flux. Got down there about 10 minutes after the bomb dropped and there was almost nothing. The respawn rate was abysmal. Of the maybe 25 glowing ones I did get to kill, 0 were legendary. I'm not wasting my time on this again when I can get better spawns on average in non-nuked Whitesprings.

You can only tame animals found through random event spawns throughout the map! Otherwise you can only pacify the animal, but if they are ~half your level and a random event spawn it will give you the option to tame them straight up as opposed to pacifying
---
All I'm waiting for
---
Same here I use melee a lot so its a problem.
---
I have plans for Marine legs, the wetsuit, and the marine tactical helmet if you're on XB.
---
You can only find them in game by server hopping and hoping.
---
The recon one? I learned it from reading the terminal outside of fort definance if I recall
---
Sometimes the vendors will have it too
---
Still a better plot than twilight
---
Hence it's easier now 😓
---
It's bethesda so nothing of any fun or excitement will come of it other than the waste of time it took to gather them.
---
So the game drops per what you have in your stash box?  Had another 3 star ghoul disappear on me last night after killing it.  So pissed.
---
But my point is unless they ALSO add new stuff everyday then people aren’t going to buy something they don’t want. 
---
And it doesn’t seem like they are, I logged in got my egg and then went right to play so I can put it in my camp.
---
Incisor is key for any armored enemies, makes it so most of your damage goes right through, I use a deathclaw gauntlet to fight queens for that reason hahaha
---
My bar is right next door to that. It’s called “The Moose Knuckle”
---
Pa and hazmat have hidden rad protection
---
I would like to know too.
---
I am also curious to know if this is how we get 5 Star Legendaries.
---
Also, what effects would be used in the two slots?  Major or minor effects?  Just imagine a Two Shot Furious Ant-Armor gun for a moment...
---
Nah do the marine helmets. I made a thousand of them over a few hours by farming a few different places for the glass, rubber and plastic. Easy peasy. Every now and then I hit those places up still to keep my stock up.
---
Not sure. It only opens Fallout76.exe and SeventySix.esm, but I think it found them automatically so it may need a registry entry. I couldn't find one though, so maybe it just checks common locations.
---
Placing them at running distance is fine. Having them pointing into the windows is not. I have only ever leveled one camp in 700 hours of play. A level 19 out back of the golf club. I warned him but nah. I knew those orbital strikes would come in handy. 450 caps bounty but I see it as money invested in someone's education. Sorry.
---
I love playing fallout 76 but it isn't hard to see that 76 is taking a simplified approach where possible. It is a fact actually. Just take a look at the perk system, so lenient and easily swapped out changed on the fly. When bethesda was asked if a player could specialize or would just be a generalist the answer was a generalist, the skill system and crafting reflect this. Hold the special system against any of the other fallout systems and it is easy to see.
---
When developing fallout 4 todd himself explained that when developing a game they try to remove/replace systems that felt cumbersome or hard. This is a philosophy that lives in their game making decisions it seems. Now, this isn't to take a dump on beth. Like I said I like playing 76 and try to avoid the hateful circlejerk. The game is aimed at casual players. I'm fine with that and enjoy the peeps that I would otherwise not play with. But this means that a lot of stuff will be simplified or scratched from the final product.
---
I agree with you that the high-level players are the ones supporting it through tough times. But it will always be trying to keep the entry level low to attract new players or make on and off players come back. Resulting in most of the content perceived to be easy or too hard. I was surprised they added a new server wide "boss" fight honestly.
---
btw for anyone thinking burrows would be a mmo style dungeon I laugh. Bethesda "dungeons" were always locations with a "dungeon chest" those green ones. In 76 those are literally in any PoI. You only fooled yourselves, admittedly the marketing for it was pretty misleading if you were the gullible type.
---
I'm in excavator armor most the time for the massive carry weight increase and I frequently hit up ore veins. I switch to X-01 for nuke zones.
---
Given a power armor frame only weighs 10lbs and the actually armor pieces are weightless when on a frame, there isn't any reason to have a couple different PAs on you if you're dependent on PA for your build.
---
I have a quad assaultron head. Sadly it’s bugged so that when you fully charge it, it deals no damage. So it’s feasible
---
Queens are tough at low level.  If you can cripple their legs or acid launcher tube (best), then it's basically game over, they just sit there and die.  Kings are much more deadly in my opinion, especially in groups.  There are a couple of places in the map that spawn both at the same time.  It can get pretty exciting.
---
Well that was lazy and fucking useless.
---
Damn😂 it’s ok
---
It sounds like you are losing strength. Check your effects page for anything that subtracts strength from you character as strength increases melee weapon damage.
---
Damn, that legendary gatling might actually get me into survival.
---
This hasn't been a problem for me at all in 76, and very rarely in other online games I play. 
---
But when I do run into a guy that wants to act a fool I give it right back to them... it's funny when they stumble cause they weren't expecting me to toss it back. 
---
I find that confident men don't tend to do this kind of thing, but insecure boys do it a lot. :)
---
I'll have to check I don't remember if I finished the BOS questline. I turned off my active quest so I could reclaim the right side of my tv.
---
No clearly what we need is 50 variations on "I don't like this aspect of the game"
---
HOLY CRAP UNSTOPPABLE MONSTER
---
maybe I should try this survival thing
---
Then people will sell legendaries with their uncles’ every mule and then server hop all day long to look for the god tier weapon they want to buy. A shooting game becomes a shopping game lol
---
Ive played with like 4 or so females so far on 76. They all have mics and are pretty chill for the most part. Something i noticed about the ladies who play 76, i cant even scratch their CAMP decor skills. Like i thought i had imagination.... i was wrong.
---
Sounds cool, Picture?
---
If you have a maxed incisor plus the BoB you cut through 125% of the armor.
---
Are they going to fix the fact that aiming a gatling gun actually makes it harder to hit things?
---
PS4 sorry
---
I’ll try to make it GT bassbyblaine
---
You adjust to that pretty fast.
---
Todd Howard would approve
---
That’s very possible but then you don’t need tokens at all, just go to the mole miner and hand over your junkie’s and get a stalkers back.
---
I need to get the chameleon mutation so I can claim a workshop
---
Hey, op here, for someone else with a stealth boy that is melee and has cavalier, i usually pop my own stealth boy to avoid the vats teleportation, they are completely useless if they cant see you, because the melee hit boxes in this game are not generous whatsoever. Spraying and praying is an option, but tesla rifles are going to be your best option
---
I'm also from WV, and I definitely believe it, you start that song up and people *will* join in.
---
How long before we can apply mods to weapons/armor/power armor again though!
---
Yup.  My old anthro professor always said, "if you're not part of the solution, you're part of the problem."
---
I'm not saying everyone feels comfortable enough to stick up for themselves all the time.  I know what it's like to be a young woman.  It took tremendous courage for OP to stand up for herself, even if nothing came of it.  But to ignore and walk away every time isn't an answer anymore.
---
This should Kill bloodied DCG prices on the market which is pretttttty sweet
---
This happened to me once a few months ago! Only it wasn’t just his spine, it was most of his skeleton. Me and my buddy thought I had the remnants of an enemy stuck to my character’s clothes but even that seemed strange. It took us a while to figure it out. I’m away from my PS4 but I’ll post some pics later!
---
Just curious is there only one server for Survival Mode?  I know you can server hop in Adventure (multiple servers). 
---
Been in Survival mode several times this week and am surprised how few people are there with me.
---
There are billions of players out there in Appalachia
---
do you have any WORKING link...
---
Every time i try to reach the server, i had a error 500 ... (bethesda XD )
---
Oh thanks! That’s good to know, I dot. Want to waste my time trying to take something that’s only going to rip my face off
---
"free content", oh that's cool, where did you get this game for free?
---
I see we have the same issues, and you don't really help me here:)  
---
&gt; got kind of a complex about keeping it at max damage
---
I don't think range weapons have a bonus like melee and armors when repaired to 200%.
---
Never mind, I found it.
---
Some interesting legendaries at least. A TS shotgun, and a bloodied DCG...
---
I haven't used my mic. How chatty do things get? I normally have the sound off. (xbox)
---
Well technically pretty much any location in a beth game can be called a dungeon since they have a "Dungeon chest" at the end. Dungeon=location to me when I play a Bethesda game. I don't know where people got the idea of this being a "MMO dungeon". Also it is at the edge of the map and the enemies that spawn there are not locked to lower levels like in the forest etc. So it is actually the "hardest" kind of enemies you can encounter there (they are max level).
---
honestly think it's just marketing screwing up and people hearing what they want to hear. Once it did not line up in the slightest with their "reality" it was easy to default to "Oh beth shiet game, typical, thx todd, it just works"
---
I want the special edition Nuka Cola lamp that you see in the Wasted on Nukashine quest. The model is in the game so surely they could implement it? It shines the word nukacola around the room, looks cool.
---
Honestly, if you have a weapon with max durability and use weapon artisan 3 when you repair, you're kind of crippling yourself using Luck of the Draw. Unless your weapon is close to breaking, having it self repair could prevent you from getting back to 200% durability. But that's just me.
---
Awesome! This gives me an easy answer to a lingering question: Anti-Armor melee weapon + rank 3 Incisor is still better than Anti-Armor melee with the straight damage perks, unless the damage resistance is 30 or less. 
---
It's incomplete as you said - you're missing the Chinese Officer's Sword completely for example - but this is a solid tool and I'm definitely bookmarking it.
---
I remember receiving premium currency compensation in Star Wars battlefront 2 for something they messed up with daily challenges completing but not awarding the currency. I certainly wouldn’t complain if they did something similar or just blanket gave everyone 250 atoms if you logged in during the days affected but it’s probably a long shot

There’s a link to a pic (I just posted it on my profile)
---
...so i don't PvP much, but i accidentally got wanted last night breaking a barrier at a friends CAMP.  I decided to have fun with it and see how long i survived... first guy comes at me and i am able to dodge attacks, but I was not able to VATS target him even though he had already attacked me and was clearly in range... so my counterattack was messed up... he eventually left after he couldn't kill me ...
---
2nd guy comes to me at a train station in melee, hits me - I go to VATS and AGAIN I can't target him... 
---
Does anyone know why this would be?  have people figured out a way to avoid vats somehow?
---
ehh I have a hard time believing an adult with a real non-gaming related job and outside social obligations can find 4 hours to play video games every day
---
… posting this directly to you also in case you know the answer - ty :-) 
---
No,no haven’t you heard? “Inside the vault” called burrows a dungeon ,that was an “unforced error” that the devs knew absolutely nothing about.
---
LOL
---
Btw, if you can also be a little LOGICAL with every quest you give (unlike you did with the alcohol : craft an impossible alcohol nobody have yet) and give HINT(s) on where to find it, and give information on your page when it's not available !! (instead of letting users find it on reddit !)
---
&gt; So I kill them. Repeatedly. While telling them how their mother would be ashamed of their behavior and that they can do better than this. 
---
Sounds like an awesome setup for some kickass one liners.  "Your mother would be so ashamed."  **\*gunshot\***
---
I personally like the Burrows.  It is full of random junk and got a pretty good haul of chems off the ghouls and containers (using Pharma Farma perk) and I too had a great time exploring with a couple lower levels . They would get their shots in and I would axe them down, rinse and repeat.  Going to run it a few more times to get the layout locked in and then nuke it.
---
I know this may sound silly, but could you add the Ripper and Mr Handy Blade to your table? I love them although I know they arnt the best. At 200% repair they do some hefty damage..
---
Kewl
---
Gunsmith is great because it is always active.  Luck of the Draw is very random and sometimes does not proc.  I use Heavy Weapons and there have been times it did not proc.  It is up to you but I personally use Gunsmith Rank 5.
---
It is also worth noting that if you over-repair a weapon and Luck of the Draw procs, it won’t actually repair the weapon.  Gunsmith does work with over-repaired weapons.
---
Lol it’s the the terminal connected to
---
The SAM turret, but when you look at the Fort front door there should be another terminal to the right, that’s where I learned mine
---
Thank You! I'll be getting these plans tonight
---
It's also really popular in Japan because it was featured in a Studio Ghibli movie, kind of like how songs like "All Star" and "You've Got a Friend in Me" we know from seeing them in a movie when we were kids.
---
. 
---
Well, I went on vacation in Japan a few years ago and had a similar moment.
---
Was at a very small one-room bar, about ten people or so, and I mention to a guy that I'm from West Virginia - he immediately breaks out into the chorus of Country Roads, soon as the rest of the bar realized what was going on, they joined in too.
---
Didn't finish the whole song, but I guarantee they knew it.
---
I have also experienced this last night in vats - I could not target the other player - does anyone know why?  This happened to me twice, where the person had attacked me, and was not crouched or in stealth (I could clearly see them), yet I could not target them in VATS - anyone know why that would be?
---
I’ve noticed if someone is crouching - not entirely sure but I can’t vats them. Generally instead of paying attention to this I’m worried about killing them lol.
---
Wow rewards for pvp are lame except for that Deathclaw Gauntlet, marked my calendar for it.
---
Monster mash event at watoga high school is a good event to farm. Make sure you get the well rested bonus and focus on killing mobs of charred feral ghouls and most times you’ll find 1-3 3* legendaries and occasionally be rewarded with legendary combat armor pieces. Loot the building, Sell what you don’t need, go off on crafting with all the loot, rinse, repeat
---
I stay off mic mostly because I don't want to have people bugging me and doing crap like this. I like to play solo for the most part so I don't really need it but I keep it handy just in case.   I also tend to sing along with the songs and don't want to annoy other people playing in case I forget to mute my mic.
---
I've had one interaction with a guy who was on mic and asking me if I wanted to trade and he was a higher level than me so I decided to plug in my mic to make things goes quicker.  I play as a girl and when he heard my voice he said "Oh, so you are actually a girl instead of a guy playing a girl character." I thought I was going to regret my decision to turn on my mic but that was all he said about that and moved on to asking me what stuff I needed weapons and armor wise.  Overall it was a great interaction that would have been harder without a mic and I think I lucked out.
---
The chameleon character is different from the unarmed one. I do not want wanted status on that one. You're invisible, but here is a big fat red arrow pointing to your exact location. Considering anyone killed can pay to give me one, Survival is not very attractive.
---
I already outlined why I feel Adventure mode is better for PVP. Let me reiterate. Adventure mode gives you 100% of the cap rewards verses only 25% in Survival. Fast travel cost is the same between modes. If I spend 25 caps to fast travel into a fight in Survival, and my target is level 100, I merely break even for a victory. If I do the same in Adventure mode, I come out 75 caps richer. If I have to travel twice to find a duel, I come out 50 caps richer. You see where this is going. Only on the 5th failed challenge do I end up spending more than I am making. I like to work my way down from the highest level player until I get around my own level.
---
Also, melee/unarmed is extremely difficult to use in Survival. Unless you have full cavaliers/assassins set, you die before you get close enough to attack. And with one shot protection, you need at least two hits to kill. How many shots do you think you can get in on a guy running straight at you. Many people like to use stealth boys. It is effective, but it has a high cost. A cost which 25% cap rewards fails to cover.
---
You should also give more credit to the average high level player. They are not as ignorant as you claim they are. Have some faith. I've had people ignore me, walk away, hop servers, or simply verbally tell me they will not fight. No one is being forced into anything. People always have a choice to make.
---
Thanks evryone for advices!
---
Yeah I just meant so I could share a screenshot
---
&gt; It is also worth noting that if you over-repair a weapon and Luck of the Draw procs, it won’t actually repair the weapon. 
---
I read otherwise in this subreddit, but it was perhaps outdated information. Are you sure?
---
What source do you have to indicate these "real numbers" and how they are decreasing every day?
---
Well, that's not what Todd Howard said on multiple occasions... he was talking about how 76 is their biggest project so far and that they have more people working on it than on any of their previous titles.
---
And quite recently, he stated: "We **grew** the studio, we're four different studios now in North America... and this was a game that really took **a ton of people** across four studios coming together to make it work."
---
That doesn't sound particularly *small* to me...
---
So, is Mr. Howard deliberately lying about how many people were/are working on 76 or is he speaking the truth and they simply went into this project waaay over their head? We're running out of possibilities here...
---
Sweet.  Might be able to get that gatling gun in one go by taking a workshop, and then it's back to care bear mode until that
---
youre on ps4 if ya want i can send you a message for some suggestions, or you can add me PSN: Silune may have a few other girls i can introduce ya too that you can run with. to lessen your chance to runnin into this type of behavior, also more than welcome to join me and the friends i hang out with usually most of us are over 30, with wives and families, so other than normal crude guy humor or cussin when we kill ourselves, ya not gonna get sexually harassed or asked what ya wearing from us. i have a pretty foul mouth and F\*\*K is my seemingly favorite term which i do try to limit myself on but f this, f that, wtf come out quite often.. couple drink from time to time, but most youd get outta them in those states is the normal "i love you guys" moment.
---
I think paper bags should be unlootable by folks who are not grouped with you, if you are in pacifist mode. If you are in PvP, the paper bag is the reward so kudos to them, but otherwise it should be unlootable to non-teammates.
---
The plans for it are in the game, they just haven't been implemented yet. Just give it some time.
---
I do apologise, as that does do the big ol' suck, but I laughed at this one
---
Have you ever wondered why, no matter what you do in Appalachia, no matter how large the impact, the effects of your work never seem to last?  Things keep happening again and again, like a deja vu moment that everyone seems to expect?
---
Well said. Ive been playing for about 3 months now, i just hit level 26. I am lucky that I play casually enough that i haven't come close to getting bored plus I missed a lot of the egregious bugs and issues that everyone had to struggle with from launch. With that said, playing last night I noticed the Mod's issue plus there seemed to be missing info when I tried to repair some weapons at a bench, I couldn't see the bar that shows how damaged a weapon was. I had to back out and use my Pip-Boy then go back into the workbench. Hopefully they fix that soon but yeah, what you said lol
---
TS shotguns are a lie.
---
I'm pretty sure you get one extra pellet not a full shell from the 2 shot effect.
---
hmmm.... well vats was working fine for me in PvE, but was not working in PvP...  i could target another wanted player wo was low lv, but higher lv players approaching me when I was wanted I could not target...
---
You're probably not getting your stimpacks back unfortunately.
---
im level 19 and haven't seen any of the sneak perks show up yet. Did I miss something?
---
Wow. Firstly, gross that's NSFL material right there and secondly does that mean all of our PCs have a skeleton inside them that we never get to see in regular gameplay? (since there's no player dismemberment here)
---
I really hope you are trolling. You dropped 1,500 stims and are upset that you lost them.
---
didnt you know? there are no gamer gurlz. theres no girls on the interwebs, its all 300lb guys in their mommas basement named chuck.
---
Cheers for that...👍
---
Oh, shit... does that actually work? How far does it stack with group members?
---
Except it's not, just to play devil's advocate. We paid for a game including much needed patches and minimal new content.
---
So with the camp protection coming. Does that mean the golf club camps can’t be smashed into scraps now?
---
The Unstoppable Monster doesn't have +Swing Speed though, so it's still not the best possible version. Still really damn good though.
---
Dont think so, it sucks. All you can do is mark it up as a hard lesson and move on.
---
Dont drop things you wish to keep, its really just asking for trouble. You couldve been the reason it crashed tbh, used to be a duping method but I had thought was patched. Maybe not.
---
Like many easter eggs.... Looka the ones in the Battlefield series and the hours people spend to solve a good puzzle.
---
&gt; social obligations
---
Believe it or not, not everyone cares about such "obligations", or their social life is with friends online. Plenty of people could care less about going out to eat or going to bar, and etc. Feeling obligated to go out with people probably means you aren't at all close to them in any way, and the whole experience is going to be insufferable or just plain boring. It's like you can't comprehend at all that different people have different life styles.
---
No worries, sorry bout the rant. Yes different types for different serums and different misc junk for each. So there might be three that take the same flux but they won’t share the random junk.  Things like bone, antiseptic, gold, coal, etc.
---
[Can I offer you a nice egg in this trying time?](https://youtu.be/NXfC16rv_fs)
---
In reality, every star gives you 1 extra coin that can be used to roll reroll a stats on a weapon. Just joking of course but reading in between the lines this could actually be a thing.
---
Regular armors can have three magical legendary effects such as standing still and take little damage while PA are nearly defenseless in PVP. And you have to farm or make fusion cores to keep them working. You can tell they prefer regular armor but still attempt to balance the game and allow PA a little advantage under specific circumstances.
---
Most likely. That’s pretty interesting if they do. It’s not something I would have thought of before.
---
I love it! As a request tho, can you add the "Mutant's" prefix that adds a flat 10% damage increase.
---
Great change to the CAMP building. No more having to build floating islands. Interesting mechanics for the challenges too, just wish they weren’t strong arming people into survival.
---
More like considers it. For example, instead of getting 1:100, you can get it 1:50-1:75, depending on what else you have.
---
Should page the CMs on these threads as there are a few of them now. I also bought the sign and am disappointed with the look of it.
---
So write your corrected code, email it to them and indicate where they messed up by using the data that they established their original UI
---
I’m a dude and I generally stay off the mic no matter what. I’ve grown accustomed to the shoot first mentality on survival so I don’t want anyone knowing I’m around haha. If anyone trolls you with hate or flame on a game guy or gal they are immature and as you realize this you just move on.
---
Start working your way through the ash heap (you’ll need a gas mask first). At level 25 you’ll be able to do the miner miracles quest to build the excavator power armor which gives +125 carry weight and makes junk/loot runs much more viable. Completing events will net you good plans, mostly for CAMP plans. Poseidon energy plant has the powering up Poseidon event plus a workshop you can claim and they have a chance of dropping fusion generator plans. 
---
I wouldn’t worry too much about crafting weapons and armor atm because you will constantly be finding better/higher level weapons and armor in the wild, and scrapping unneeded weapons and armor is the best way to learn plans to modify the better versions later on. Buying a weapon plan from a vendor is ultimately unhelpful because once you’re level 50 you’ll want to farm events that drop legendary guns/armor that you cannot craft but can modify with the mods you’ve learned from scrapping the non-legendary versions.
---
Thanks. I'll investigate how to get my hands on those files and try it out
---
Because the servers crashed and they didn’t fit in my stash. I shouldn’t really have to story about listing them. I dropped behind 3 locked doors and after dropping one to make sure they stayed.
---
Dude I'm right there with you, but watch out cause the haters of people who call out this type of bs will be here soon. Posted about all this last night and got hit with negative krama. Thought this was a place to discuss the games problems found out alot of people, probably employees will come at you crossways for voicing your opinion.
---
You just became my hero
---
This is wonderful, though some of the weapon damage is not up to date. for example the LMG is no longer 16 damage, i think it is 42 or something, and the .50 cal is 46 iirc
---
Saw them say a small patch is coming out Tuesday to fix this.
---
If you can add someone from the server you were in do that very fast
---
Then go back and pick it up
---
Otherwise idunno man
---
It’s all good I’d probably laugh too lol.
---
Welp, guess I'm jumping into Survival Mode to grab Commander's Charge. I'll have to team up, too!
---
Holy shit those new Legendaries are actually pretty good, especially that Gatling Gun and Deathclaw Gauntlet
---
Also inb4 we all start making jokes about the Salt of the Earth's name
---
I've dropped stuff too out of the same curiosity, so I can't really blame you. Once you pick it up it should be in your inventory
---
Isn't Long Shot an accuracy card?
---
Double.... gatling gun?
---
Aye. I used to be way more careful but lately the servers have been very stable so I figured why not. Guess now I know why not. I still have 600 and another 200 super stims but it still sucks ass.
---
I guess it depends on your playing style... Have a serious hurting issue like me than you need excavator. Like to jet pack around I have found the t60 is easiest to come by. Fighting the SBQ ultracite or x01 best stats. You get ultracite mods thru the queen. And xo1 mods thru enclave vendor. As far as raider t45 t51 I haven't tested those in a real fight simply because I don't have the calibrated shocks for any of them or any mods I need. So at the end of the day your most reliable will probably be the excavator because you have the carry weight and then you can buy the mod plans to customize it to your liking.
---
I'm a female ps4 player and I have a mic but, most of the time I don't use the mic.  I haven't seen a reason sometimes to let other players know that I'm a female, they see my game tag and automatically think that I'm a Male playing as a female.  It does blow their minds when I speak up. My husband and I play FO76 together, we've come across one dweeb that was rude and terrible but, all of the others have been kind and helpful.
---
  I have had issues in other games that some guys are just dweebish to begin with.  I'll either ignore them or destroy their characters which is fun to do.  Then they rant throw their tantrums and it gets others in the game to aggravate them till they leave or quit.
---
   I like FO76 it's a good game that I enjoy.
---
Yasss they need to use products for making light fixtures. Lava lamp would be another idea to have for nuka cola.

Did you know the lights for hanging from Christmas time has the lights showing nuka cola around.

As far as I know, it's still an assumption that the damage formula is exactly the same as Fallout 4's. The scaling certainly seems similar, but the anti-armor cutoff is unproven.
---
If the fallout 4 formula does apply, the rule of thumb is that if your damage is 6x higher than the DR, further armor penetration will have no effect. Hence your Incisor + AA answer only applies to a weapon + perks with a total damage of 180.
---
The default face. Lol.
---
Done. Note though that they are more of a speed weapon, so you may do .5 effective damage but 100 times a second. Weapon speed is currently not considered by the calculator.
---
It's the highest duty in fallout to destroy every turret-whitespringsbase on sight!
---
Done.
---
That is a hilarious phrase, one I shall endeavor to use at least once today.
---
I use a meathook, but absolutely!
---
Nope, not yet.
---
I'm not female, but when someone tries griefing or sending hatemail to me or something like that I either just send a thumbs up or I follow them blasting something like Ram Ranch or something else that can get annoying fast.
---
Yes.  
---
I used to use Luck of the Draw over Gunsmith because I thought it would would still repair despite being over-repaired until I noticed otherwise.
---
I'd also like to know where you got this information, I'm not a "fanatic" in any way but I dont believe the game is going down like you think.
---
The amount of people on this reddit does not equal the people who play the game. Aswell as it doesnt tell you the total online players like other mmo's. It could be more or less, but I bought fo76 at launch, took a small break for things to get fixed, and have been playing alot in the last 2 weeks.
---
Thank you for your service! 👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻
---
Since no one else seems curious, *why* do you have 1400 stimpacks?
---
Yeah. I was transfering legendaries to a second bank account last night. Was sweating bullets the whole time. 
---
Fyi, if you pick up 300+ pounds of legendaries at once. It is the most ear rapey sound I have ever heard.
---
TL;DR - It was late and I had been drinking. Your name popped in my head when I was making the post. Didn't mean to offend you buddy. I like your vids man. But, Yeah, well, you know, that's just, like, my opinion, man.
---
Let me explain. I wasn't directing it at you personally Juice. That was for the people (juiceheads) that come to the forums defending you (or any other YTber for that matter) and your opinions of the game and then proceed to bash it to hell adding to the Fallout 76 bonfire that , IMO, has been burning for way too long. You have to admit that you guys (YTbers) have a big impact on peoples opinions of games good or bad. There seems to be more bad than good. Just search "juicehead" in the forum and see for yourself. I'm doing it right now. Yes, I could have picked any number of youtubers that have this same effect on the community. But for whatever reason yours stuck out. Again I wasn't aiming at you. I like your videos my man. I'm a subscriber. I know why you have such strong opinions of the game. It's literally your job. Hell, you should be thanking me. You can now make a video about this post. Your welcome. All kidding aside. Nothing but love for you man. Peace. 
---
PS - I spent way more time on this response than I'm comfortable with. I'm really bored at work.
---
That is what they want you to think
---
No problem mate!
---
That TS shotgun has but one extra pellet, though. TS is one of the worst perks for shotties.
---
The Bloodied DCG is the only one I'll go out of my way to get, the others would go straight to my vending machine (if it were available).
---
The weight number that appears when you open your pipboy is the weight of the object on your person, all you had to do was multiply shown weight by total number.  To see the actual weight or what they weight in your stash just unequip the related weight reduction perk.
---
With 3* traveling pharmacy  stimpacks weigh .1 so you would have had 140lbs of stimpacks.

They're underground.

When someone sends me hatemail after I clap them on For Honor I either shoot with a "Nay Thee" (no u) or just a thumbs up.

40 year old female gamer here. I guess I didn’t realize that this was a problem. I come from a gaming family started by my awesome 80 year old grandma who still plays games in the nursing home. I’ve never experienced harassment or a stigma because of this. Growing up, none of my female friends really played any games but it wasn’t a big deal.
---
However, I am new to online gaming so maybe this is where the issue has come up. I also have social anxiety so I stay off the mic unless I’m on a team with my dad and my son. They both play as female avatars which I find funny, because we look like a team of chicks rolling through the wasteland. I would avoid online gaming altogether but I love the Fallout series a lot and it has been a great bonding experience for my dad and son.
---
It really sucks that some people are being toxic to you for being female. They’re most likely immature or just complete assholes. Best thing to do like others said is to block them and move on. I believe the majority of the gaming community doesn’t care whether or not you’re female. Over the years, I’ve gotten nothing but positive energy and experiences from others in the real world from it.
---
When you have the anonymity of the internet and online gaming, it can turn the minor douchebag into a major one. My son and dad have experienced more pvp and camp destruction than I have. It’s just asshole RNG. My camp has only been attacked once and it was by a guy with a gamertag similar to the name of our president so I fast traveled home and thought if I started building a tremendous  wall that that would appease him, but he was breaking walls instead so I logged out.
---
TL;DR I take Adderall for a sleep disorder and I ramble too much sometimes. Don’t let it get you down. Most people are good and don’t care about your gender.
---
I got mine from picking up a magazine.  I have never read one of my magazines...now to fix the bug where my trophy didn't pop for reaching lvl 50.......
---
Unfortunately, there was barely anything in here worth reading about. Some new Legendary weapons are cool but not really new content or a significant change to the game. The best thing by far is the C.A.M.P. improvement that removes the restrictions of building on terrain (besides the first piece), and I don't even build that much. It will be great to see what players will build without that restriction.
---
Correct, it's butts.
---
Sorry, for some reason I read 'damage' in your title. My bad.
---
That happens all the time tho. Most mirelurk queen spawns have a couple kings. I know the farm below watoga has 2-3 kings, a queen, and glowing mirelurks as 100% spawns. I remember finding a swamp in the north-northeast mire that also seems to 100% spawn queens with kings.
---
Ma'am, this belongs in all subs.  Harrassment is not only useless and horrible, but it is also a violation of TOS and possibly has legal implications depending on your location.
---
Ooh. I'm excited for Night Light. I know tesla rifles aren't that great but I love them anyway.
---
Also, that CAMP foundation change will be very nice.
---
It's an awesome ''heavy shotgun sniper'' despite the displayed range of 80 or something. I usually use it to kill long range stealth snipers in one hit
---
I’m not referring to the invincible mob glitch. This is the no 1 hit kill implementation that some how also got applied to mobs. So when you hit it just goes thud, once or twice until it finally applies damage and kills them
---
Who the heck are you?
---
I personally don’t think you did anything wrong doing what you did, but some people get butt hurt about doing stuff like that. Regardless, you have no business being anywhere near a nuke zone or even the cranberry bog region until you’re close to level 50. For now, focus on working your way to the southwest region the Ash Heap and do the miner miracles quest at level 25, which nets you the excavator power armor set, making you considerably more powerful and gives +125 carry weight - great for loot runs into whatever locations you come across
---
I have finally found a use for my Super Stimpak's. i take all 3 conduit's and sit on top of the building and keep using them and shooting from up there so everyone can hurt the sheepsquatch.
---
it's works quite well, i go though about 10 to 15 supers.
---
and a hand full of regular ones.
---
Might have been shooting the shell. Queens are manageable if you're going for the face. Explosives work really well too, a MIRV frag grenade under her feet will take out 1/4-1/2 of her health
---
I think you have to pick them up =\
---
lol I was already on high alert because I was doing the quest at night and the ambiance was fantastic, especially after walking past the neighboring church with the organ that plays by itself. So when the jump scare happened, I ended blowing off my own kneecaps with my explosive rifle lol.
---
I'm so fucking happy about this given where my camp is built is on juuust enough of an incline that the back edge has to be placed very carefully to avoid it 'floating'. Hoping this will make placing fences easier, too!
---
To be honest, I only ever noticed it because I think heavy weapons in 3rd person look more epic. I started doing that back in fallout 4 when you get your first set of power armor.
---
I play solo and stay off the mic. I finally spoke up when a nice gentleman kept offering me items and my emotes and actions weren’t getting through to him that I didn’t need anything. It was actually a nice short pleasant exchange. 
---
I do have area chat on if anyone does what to talk - most people don’t. I play in the living room, so while I know no one would mind if I talked, I feel rude doing so if they are in the same space but not on a headset (most of the time they aren’t).
---
My daughter needed a glass of water last night when I was just hitting The Burrows for the first time after far too much prepping. I nearly told her to help herself- there's 5 in the purifier.
---
well I uh ..don't have much else to do the rest of this evening :P so truth be told I'd love to have a chat with them and ask if they would have a way for me to complete these challenges so I could stop making a post like this the next time :) I'm a little confused as of how else one could defend that they haven't changed this yet, I just think it's really really too bad.
---
Did you trade for them or pick them up as natural spawns? Mine only counted those I found in the world and picked uo
---
I'll level up once or twice more to max out super duper, grab some more steel, then I can probably churn out a few hundred 40mm grenades.
---
I use 50 cal rounds, so if you have any cluttering up your stash, I'd happily take them off your hands.
---
Same here, straight melee build.  Only reason I got it since I don't use energy weapons.
---
It does not matter unless it's melee.
---
 There is a lot going on. My Combat Knives are just devastating. Repaired to 200% they gain a lot and my vanilla, non legendary Serrated Combat Knife hits at around 150 when its just repaired. That's maybe 3 times a second and I can do that till the mouse breaks.
---
 Hard to quantify and my Legendary ones even more so.
---
Well, that's part of the reason I found it *interesting*...
---
I may pick it up just for the collectibility.
---
A Fallout 76 family, awesome.
---
ah ok dang... 
---
i guess you can for sure server hop events, or workshops--- if you have a friend, you can team up, take the workshop so you both get rewards, then leave the team, let your friend leave server, then you can claim the workshop again,a nd get more experience
---
then join your friend in the new server, and repeat, but this time you leave first so he can get the 2nd rewards...keep doing that over and over!
---
the only issue with this ism each time you claim the workshop, you have to pay some caps to do it
---
You can’t buy them. Gotta get them from their spawns
---
What does a conduit mean?
---
Its the same result.
---
I often hear this debate go around and IMO, power armour should be as necessary as it is. It should be more powerful, from the lore and a common sense perspective. You not only have an enhancing exo skeleton frame that is powered by miniaturized nuclear cores, You have top of the line lead lined Rad resistant armour, the best created ever. Why should slapping on a few metal plates or armour pieces come close to power armour, especially at ground zero of a nuclear bomb? To me it just doesn't make sense. Normal armour does have its place in the speed and stealth of the open world but power armour is, as it says in the name, powerful armour, and theres nothing wrong with that in my opinion.
---
Source?
---
I've had the same issue and it got posted in the bug roundup for the patch from the 9th. I tried everything to bring it back, but no dice. I assume something Bethesda did broke it completely, so I imagine they'll have to release a fix. It sucks because we can't get the brewing station without it.
---
Next patch coming tuesday
---
Expects it to be terrible in relation to his expectations. Expectationception.
---
How?
---
Took this from an article:
---
unfortunately the functional camera that was supposed to arrive today has now been delayed until April 23rd.
---
Paging u/Valseek: any update on why we're getting camera challenges for the third day straight, now? The challenges are not hard-coded into the server code, or are they? ;-) Please have one single dev fix the challenges from their home office if everyone is on holiday leave, mmkay? And give us 'Drink 1 beer' for 80 atoms as compensation for the lost rewards. Deal?
---
It ain’t rocket appliances
---
When you activate a pylon, you are a 'conduit' for the energy needed to deactivate the assaultron's shielding.
---
Can you take all your perks off and check the hunting rifle damage values with the hardened receiver and base receiver? Should be able to check the latter at a workbench without changing it.
---
Wiki may be wrong there because it's quoting a flat number (+12) for the damage boost, but I think it's actually +25% or something like that.
---
Or let us wear rad suits over our armor. If this plus lead-lined gear becomes a problem, don't allow them to stack.
---
Yeah huge disappointment was hoping for something nicer. Does look a bit better at distance though.
---
Seriously - it ain’t rocket appliances, people.
---
Shouldn’t you add an option for armor piercing mags on Piper rifles?
---
I feel like they make a huge difference.
---
Yes, need I say more?
---
What sidequest?
---
Son... you got a condition
---
Exactly, it’s like the Dragon on steroids, most people don’t realize how effective it is
---
Also the hair
---
It's all fun and games until the scorchbeast turns the queen into one of its minions with it's spore cloud.
---
This would be nice.  I have severe social anxiety, and after a long day of work I often find talking to people a bit overwhelming and intimidating.  Emotes are just barely on the comfortable side of the line as there's less perceived commitment to prolonged interaction.
---
I get it's a social game, and I love running into people and helping where I can...and I don't want to be rude...but I also really don't want to commit to prolonged interaction, I'm fine just being ships passing in the night, as it were.
---
I mean, its not against the rules to hoard aid items. Server hopping for bloodpacks would probably be the hardest part. Then just super duper it up with chemist and numbers get pretty high fast.
---
Yup, it's great. We look after each other, trade, take pictures, just a shame we can't get together as often.
---
If you look closely, specifically at the hats, there's a difference.
---
I play Rimworld, I have a particular affinity towards hats.
---
They aren’t going to lose anyone, only the people that suck
---
Very true.
---
Perhaps they need to change the sound when you pick up legendaries now?  Maybe change it to:
---
https://youtu.be/yJxCdh1Ps48
---
true!
---
They won’t talk to me after the Deathclaw-Jockstrap incident...
---
Yeah, but the Legendary vendor is going to be out before then though (unless they move it back like they have done with most of the other updates), so you will be able to re-roll one of the effects on it. Replace that DMG resist with swing speed and it would be niiiicccceeee.
---
Don't forget to report him after all the foul, abusive language.
---
well, do you suck?
---
This sounds like an example of Bethesda laziness, hopefully they fix them before it gets out of hand like last time.
---
My dude!
---
I don’t even really care about that, it’s that they can destroy things while still in pacifist mode. It’s not the loss of materials, I can get those back, it’s the fact that they can do it to anyone and someone could maybe be deterred from this game
---
That sounds like something a Synth would say.
---
If it helps, I'm a 27 year old man who ends up dealing with kids who think it's cute to be disgusting, who also mows them down whilst telling them their mothers would be ashamed of their behavior and that they can do better.
---
Vile little creatures.
---
No its not. In your head, you think that adding this will automatically make bloodied characters invincible. It does not. If you set a timer or a damage enmity multiplier on for the tank, youll only have enough time to tank key enemies that can one shot most people. Ive seen people full health get one shotted by sheepsquatch. If we have bosses like this in the instanced dungeons then we will need a means to keep hate off our squishy friends whether they are bloodied or not.
---
It is really just limited to survival mode?  I’d be far less likely to steal someone’s shit in survival because you’d have a big target on your back.  In adventure, there’s much more of an incentive to do it because of the potential consequences.  Plus, people have this belief you can’t get ganked or griefed in adventure for your loot so people let their guard down and take more chances (carrying more stuff).   
---
Special note - I don’t typically take someone’s loot but if they fake trade and gank me to get my stuff and I work them over I will gladly take their shit. If someone dies in normal situations I leave it alone.
---
I stay on the mic, I’m not about to let all the others have the fun of a open world without me. Yeah I get some weirdos that make lewd comments because I run around in the nuka girl outfit. But if they get too creepy I just engage in PvP and that usually shuts them up lol
---
But  honestly without being on the mic I wouldn’t have met my super awesome friends!
---
This has been my experience, but I'm a guy (I do have a female friend though for several years now, and apparently she hasn't had the greatest experience in the past). I've played several games with random female players that end up in the lobby, and are on mic. Sure they're a bit rare, but I've personally not experienced any form of toxicity surrounding them. If anything, it's almost like nobody acknowledges that they're female. Hardly anyone cares that they're female (in a non-negative way). It's genuinely surprising how many women I've encountered in this game though and actively talk via mic. At least for them, they clearly feel perfectly comfortable talking and aren't really expecting anything to happen. I'm always skeptical whenever a female player goes on about how they've had their fair share of unpleasant experiences in this game, as I haven't seen any of it over 600 hours of playtime (playing since release).
---
I'm delving a bit off topic here, but one of the things I miss from other games I've played online is guilds.  I only have my kids as friends, and only 1 plays 76 and I play his account more than he does.
---
Only if they have turrets.
---
Okay, but the first skin for it is a chocolate fondue fountain. ⛲️ 😲
---
Female here that plays on xbox. My character is female and my xbox name is female-mine (I'm not good with coming up with names and didn't like the xbox generated one). Been playing since end of November, I barely ever hear anyone talking. I talk only when someone else is trying to talk on mic to me, don't just run around with mic on. I have talked 3 times, can remember each. First time guy found my camp and was saying it looked cool-I was sick at the time losing my voice so didn't talk much. Second time someone teamed me and wanted help with nuking, told him I'm not the best player but I'd try, he was cool with it. Last time was another random team invite and he just wanted someone to roam around with, he joked how I would run into places killing everything instead of knocking and being invited in. But no bad experiences. Females can be just as bad, during Faschnacht there was a female mouthing off to everyone in area chat while we were waiting for the parade to start, nothing to do but wait and she's pissed bc no one was doing anything then during the parade she's in the houses doing nothing while rest of us are fighting off creatures..
---
That's what I was supposed to be, but it's kinda an inside joke with my old lady whok misread the drug Fury in game as Furry.
---
to-do list that's probably about 5 miles long now.
---
Excellent, thx, bro!
---
Long Shot only applies when the weapon is sighted, so it won't affect the range or accuracy in the pip-boy. "More accuracy" in this case means that the bullet spread is reduced by 15% per rank. I don't know whether VATS counts as sighted.
---
Tank Killer does work with both automatic and non-automatic rifles, but the stagger chance is lower for automatic rifles (1% per rank).
---
I like this!  Alot!
---
[I think it's this one.](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/That_Sinking_Feeling)
---
It had a jump scare at the end
---
Yeah. I was gonna buy em the other night but I needed me the metal building set first.
---
The game did you a solid. Stimpaks are a dime a dozen.
---
[Anti-vegan] I'll kill your chickens and chicks and eat them.
---
This!  If I am running to fight the SBQ or enter Survival mode you damn right I’m slimming down just in case.  Doing anything else just isn’t smart gameplay.
---
They actually did have new items on sale when they released the second egg. So, more things to potentially purchase each day.
---
I agree with you completely. I’ve also been playing since Beta and still continue to play on a regular basis because I love this game and every Fallout game!
---
I read it like this  
---
 "**If the Bethesda failed in the Burrows, they really are the worst faction"**
---
This is really awesome but any plans to factor in Magazine sizes and what not for DPS.  
---
I'm wondering which is a better primary effect on my Harpoon Shotgun. [2S, Double, or Quad]  
---
Ammo is not a factor as Shotgunpoon generates more ammo than used.
---
How do I even get that quest? Do I have to solve the unsolved mysteries first?
---
I see you didn't meet the Bethesda fun police yet.
---
Thanks, no problem. It seems odd indeed.
---
The lvl 50 Hunting Rifle has a base damage of 70 in the wiki. Hardened adds a flat 12 damage supposedly:
---
(70 + 12) \* 1.05 \* 1.6 = 137,76
---
Now if hardened instead adds 25% to the base damage:
---
70 \* 1.25 \* 1.05 \* 1.6 = 147
---
The game tends to round the fractions, so 145.5 - 146.5 listed as 146 damage would be 16.6 (23.7% base) -  17.2 (24.5% base) damage for the hardened.
---
A lvl 35 Lever Rifle has a base damage of 70. Hardened adds a flat 18 damage supposedly:
---
(70 + 18) \* 1.05 \* 1.6 = 147.84
---
Let me check my rifles in-game (I have both types) and see how modding changes numbers.
---
What was the weapon drop?
---
Me too. Constantly complaining about the game, but yet I am still coming back. Multiple times a day.
---
Broke down my per hour investment a few days ago. Best 15cents ive every spent.
---
New idea. Find someones camp and wait for them to walk in so you can see what they look like (staying hidden of course) then moving camp next to them and making your character look like them
---
Yes you get hit so your bloodied buddies don't, that removes the risk.  You should be able to understand that, it's what your asking for.  This is pretty pointless, it's just a difference of opinion, you want to see tanking, I don't.
---
Man, now I have to remember to log in to survivor in the beginning of June.
---
I'm not saying the way it works currently is great, but you can learn to aim without a reticle with a little practice (just like in real life). Also third person mode gives you a dot when you "aim down the sight"...
---
Not yet, that complicates things a bit as getting the proper reload time and cycle time is not easy.
---
Exactly, especially if they are going to do the timed exclusives and sales.
---
Bethesda likes money; this will help people give them money. However, they seem to have a vendetta against convenient design so it might be awhile before something like this gets implemented.
---
Not disparaging it in any way, just genuinely curious as to the why.
---
&gt; I've got kind of a complex about keeping it at max damage
---
I'm you, until just a little bit ago.
---
I an a sneaky sniper build, I have all the max damage perks for it (more or less).  I was happy after a while, as with my instigating sniper I could pretty much one shot any normal mobs.  I built up from having to kite level 62 zombies in WS to the guards, to a guaranteed kill even with a torso shot.
---
After a *long* time farming, I finally got an AAE shotty to drop for me, and spent a bunch of unused perk cards to get cards for that, and buffed the heck out of myself in that area to see how it went.  It was...OK.  Not hugely impressed.  But I found out that, even with the shotty perks instead of the rifleman ones, I was *still* one shotting things with that same sniper rifle.
---
Play around with your build some, you may be surprised.
---
The camp § is good news.
---
Just tell me if you spot one ! ;)
---
Before that they need to make pacifist camps indestructible. You don’t want to put on a glorious PA display and come home only to repair them repeatedly because some low-lives damaged them.
---
Thanks! I need Long Shot for using the VATS. Do you have any idea who to know if it works with VATS?
---
huh... I was able to harvest strangler pods, but not the blooms...
---
Yeah I started a week ago and I'm at lvl 25 and I still have absolutely no complaints
---
Steps to getting cheap FO76 Karma.

6. Reap Karma.
---
Hunting rifle/Level 35 lever action rifle:
---
No perks equipped Standard Receiver: 70
---
No perks equipped Hardened Receiver: 87
---
I think you found the problem. It seems to be a 25% increase in damage not just 12. 
---
70+0.25*70= 87.5; It seems the value is rounded down to 87 in my inventory.
---
Yeah, I hardly even use stimpacks nowadays with a regen piece and healing factor. 
---
1400 would probably last me a few months of gameplay. Probably.
---
Did you mean "Please add magazine mods for Pipe Rifles"?
---
The roadmap does confirm that a update will happen next Tuesday, but nothing indicates that it will patch this bug.
---
It's a hedgehog because he moves so damn fast #sonic
---
"Yes of course Mr Poopy Butthole, everybody remembers all the times you've been there for us."
---
When I built my first X01 power armor, I dropped it instead of placing it, the server crashed, and it was gone forever.  Never even wore it.  But:  I never made that mistake again!
---
I wish I was exxagerating that I'm a new player, level 30 with an unmodded super sledge and I cleared this dungeon in under 10 minutes without reading any dialogue or knowing what to do.
---
Good for you, certainly not my experience though as an unarmed sneakyboi.
---
Country Roads I agree with but please no more beach boys
---
I tried that with resource collectors and yea was happy id be happy with the option to use last build.
---
Did the quest, learned the plan, but when I go back all I get are Strangler Pods.  No blooms.  Maybe just not looking hard enough?  Are they mixed with mostly pods and a few blooms?
---
Nice! Suitably Lovecraftian in style.
---
You guys should’ve recreated the Spider-Man meme with the pointing emote

My kid calls the Mirelurk Queen Crabzilla.  I think I would rather fight a giant, mutated godzilla than the damn mirelurk queen again.

Fiberglass Sturdy Chest 2*
---
Heavy Leather RA***/LA
---
Heavy Leather RL***/LL***
---
The LL is Vanguard (I think) and is the only legendary armor DR buf. Most is AutoStim, Cloaking, Chameleon, weight saving buffs.
---
Heavy Leather is surprisingly good. My *** leather peices are better than most *** combat armor drops I find.
---
Much of the DR I have comes from Evasive and a maxed Agility.
---
The only thing I hate about this build is the Rad resistance. 
---
Nuke zones require a hazmat which makes you super vulnerable with glowing ones
---
(will correct as needed)
---
We don't know how exactly the legendary vendor will work yet though. It might not be customizing existing legendaries, and I'm kind of expecting there will still be an RNG factor to it.
---
I was only Level 27 with a Bagger PA &amp; my teammate a level 58 with the X01 PA. I was so damn curious about the new Dungeons that I wanted to do the new quest. Then we saw that Harpers Ferry was nuked every time we want to went there... 😅 I just said "F*** off, we go there anyway!" And it was one of the best decisions we've made so far! I leveled up and up and up.... And up. Ok, died a few times more than my mate, but anyway! It was a lot of fun, a lot of very good and nice loot (thx to the glowing ones in the underground! 😉) and a really nice quest! One time my armor was broken and there was a bench and I decided to jump out fast of my PA... But exactly at this moment a Level 303 spawned right behind us and with him all the high level glowing ones!! I tried to jump in my PA as fast as I could, but no chance! 😂😂 Respaaaaaawn! 🙈 He definitely hat the worst timing ever to show up... Or I jumping out of my PA... 😁 But he recognized it, waited for me to respawn and just gave me a few good things! Really nice buddy! (Not all high levels are jerks! 😉 I met just a few so far... 2... All the rest were very kind and helpful all the time time!)
---
So I hope this afternoon Harpers Ferry will be nuked again! Cause it also can be lots of fun for a low level and it's a great way to level up and the loot is great... You just need a few Stimpaks, RadAways and so on... 😉 But hey! Let's party! 😉 🎉👍 💉💊💣💥😄🙌Whoop, whoop! 🤘 🙌
---
That outfit combo is pretty common, looks really good
---
Exactly the same here. I started ~2 weeks ago and just made level 25. So far I've thoroughly enjoyed this game. It's great to be back in the Fallout world again, and the minor PVP doesn't bother me at all.
---
I honestly don’t believe it.

You built a tomb? I am quite interested now.
---
They should let us craft a rickety, rusty old Mr. Handy. You activate him, the screen fades to black, there's a whirring of the saw, and a scream. When the screen fades back in, you are cured whatever ails you but you're missing some health.

Just because i want to get hit by the STRONG bosses doesnt mean i want to get hit by everything. Youre misunderstanding the whole point of the post. You think I'm going to be tanking everything and nobody has a care in the world about getting hit. Thats not the case. The point is that i only want the means to take the hit of strong bosses that pose a one shot threat to anyone not built on being able to take said hit. This goes for anyone. Not just bloodied. Anytime we have strong bosses, its usually not just bosses, there are also usually adds coming in as well. Thats where team play and self sustaining comes in. If nobody takes out adds, guess what? The party wipes the floor.
---
Oh I see what you mean now. I'll be honest I thought they implemented that by just using damage scaling so that each hit does a consistent amount of DMG? Then again it could still be related where it just doesn't display damage until you kill them.
---
Oh shit I didn't know that, any guesses if it'll be in the atomic shop?
---
Then you'll be happy to know about my cannibalistic habits.
---
it's because there aren't that many multilingual vault dwellers out there apparently 🤔
---
or maybe it's because "habitante de la caja fuerte" doesn't have the same ring to "vault dweller" 😅
---
either way you rock bruh
---
Sure. Until then, just increase the Other buffs percentage at the bottom of the table.
---
This makes me happy,

If water is going to be used as a material, I think a water cooler makes more sense.
---
Although it would be nice if we could have a plumbing system like we have witg electricity.  An outside pump that doesn't generate bottled water but connects to pipes that can go to a sink, fountain, toilet, bathtub, etc.  It's mostly just cosmetic stuff, but it annoys me that we build toilets and things without water in them.
---
It works on ticks to get tick blood which you need for making stimpacks though
---
What if this was a really really weird bug? That'd be great
---
Is the explosive Gauss rifle considered an legacy item?
---
Hell yeah I did, the entrance is hidden in my bedroom and every time I worship my mothman statue, I become invisible to at least one of my friends, it's an odd glitch coincidence
---
Can't let perfectly good supplies go to waste. Gotta feed the Thrumbowolves something.
---
Not a friend. Legit random person I found. I got enough karma out of the first Repair Kit post.
---
Also, bold of you to assume I have friends.
---
Yes, I agree about the skepticism. 
---
Mainly because I'm a female... not shy about talking on mic in any game... online games were my go-to for a long long time... starting in 1997 with UO... then into WoW... you get the idea. Does flirting happen? Absolutely. Do rude comments happen? Sure. 
---
Is it intentionally toxic? Usually not, but I'm not easily offended, and like I said in my original reply, I can sling that shite right back at them.
---
I usually can and have always handled my own troubles with the asshats, but I know who to call if I ever get in over my head.  I just can appreciate your confident style.
---
God's be praised.
---
Yes, certainly, I'll try to get up-to-date values. If you have one or two on hand, just post the values; not sure when I can get/craft those myself.
---
Hell ya man, a few issues but not enough to turn me away lol
---
Dont run in circles like nascar do somthing different. Go on an adventure instead of bombing Apalacia allthe time.
---
It's probably meant for an indoor setting. But it should be readable from a close distance at least
---
No idea. A good while back, someone datamined all the plans in the game. Among them were all the magazine paint jobs from FO4. Seeing how no one has posted about finding one of these plans, Beth probably has it locked away for some future content (or to sell in the Atom shop).
---
This is confusing. Adrenaline isn't a Charisma perk, it's Agility and it the effect is of it is on a timer. Also you can't equip more perks then what's in your base stats. If you have say 6 points in Charisma and boost it to 10 with Unyielding you can still only equip 6 points work of perk cards in that stat. The additional 4 points is only a passive gain.
---
Oh yea I let him gripe for about a good 15min before I was like oh so I actually too your bag 🤣 Yea I hate the event stalkers.
---
How about you stop complaining about explosive weapons and just use flame proof and dense?
---
you need to go to the southern belle motel ( where the explosives police robot daily is) the far table left of him when looking at the hotel has a note on it to start it
---
they're just blooody rare:)
---
Yeah tbh I've only been attacked once and that was an accident
---
yup thats the one
---
I also checked the increase in damage on a double barrel shotgun. 
---
Standard receiver 138 damage.
---
Hardened receiver 172.
---
It's another ~25% increase (well 172.5 but the rounding down bit applies again)
---
Pump action shotgun. 
---
Standard: 95
---
Hardened: 118.
---
Standard+25%: 118.75
---
Careful, I just may assume your gender next...
---
I'm usually in team chat or party chat with the many guys and one woman I've met on reddit or in-game. If I'm alone, I have my mic on mute, mainly because I hate to see that mic indicator when I'm breathing. I will speak to people but usually they don't. I'm fortunate to not have had the experience you've had when I've had conversations with guys or teamed up with them.
---
How is this hard to believe though? Melee is broken for PVE. I have extractors armor and max points in str. I two shot level 62's. I fight three star legendaries twice my level at whitesprings all day, and whitesprings has more difficult pulls than this place (I fight two or three at a time there). I'm actually considering using Burrows to level since the non-questline areas have a good amount of ghouls.   
---
You're gonna have to accept that the game just isn't balanced. If I can do "end game" solo when I'm half the level of the mobs in the "dungeon" there is a problem.
---
Thank you very much!
---
You trade in legendary weapons for tokens to spend on that new random weapon with random effects. It is also implied by data miners that you could possibly edge it to something you want but it will still be mostly RNG.
---
You’re going to have to accept I don’t believe you.
---
...and will never happen. 
---
Ok, it could, but would likely cost more than you’d be willling to pay.
---
From everything i've seen, a re-roll mechanic is being introduced and you will scrap your legendaries for coins to go towards this. I've also seen where you will be able to add abilities to existing legendaries. Something like adding a star to your 3 stars. Probably the reason why they have 5 slots on each weapon with a max of 3 stars as a base legendary. I'm sure there will be a RNG factor to keep you farming for those coins. I just hope its along the lines of the first Division game. You could re-roll stats on armor and weapons but you could only re-roll one stat. The up-side was you got 5-6 choices each time you re-rolled, you just couldn't do it on every ability the weapon or armor provided. On a side note I made my first 4 star last night by adding a sacrificial blade to my 3 star machete, but I think it's the only weapon you can do that to right now.
---
What is the easiest workshop to take over in Survival? Or are they all equally difficult?
---
Can do it with a VNC, bit choppy based on internet speeds but I've started up 76 at home from work via VPN.
---
I do think this is another good reason for a companion app.

Maybe he got out of his mom's basement and went for a drive, then realized there's a helluva lot more to do than play games all his life while living on welfare in his mom's basement.  NAHHHH, who am I kidding... he's still posting.
---
Pay to win
---
Shooting as a whole is shit in this game, melee wipes the floor with it.
---
The entire scenario is fictional, so... not sure where you're going with that.
---
I think the plumbing system would be ideal, however, I can see Bethesda saying plumbing taking up too many server resources.
---
It would be cosmetic, or drink only (no collection) on this new purified water system we are hypothesizing.
---
With the plumbing it makes sense though, as it could feed the water cooler from a water purification source.
---
I could never hit with my knives so fast, all my melee weapons swing just lock up and lag out. Never been able to fix this, the worst is fighting a mob where I may as well just stand and let them kill me then re-spawn back at my camp, pretty frustrating.
---
All you need now is a terrifying superhero vigilante name.
---
I play the game cus I enjoy it - could care less how many people play it. I don’t spend a lot of money in the atomic shop, sometimes I’ll throw up some bones if I see something cool that’s limited and my free atoms from the game are low. Friend of mine just grinds the dailies and weeklies and gets a pretty good amount. As far as server hop on survival I’ve noticed really just two servers as I check the leader boards that I can hop between.
---
I feel Bethesda should have a line of tshirts with a  few pictures of legendary farming hotspots and the catchline ".... All I got was a some crappy one star legendary armor". I'd buy that before buying more atomic shop credits.
---
Yeah got my first gattling plasma yesterday and used it to take down my first mirelurk queen, but I panicked when my gun seemed to be jamming and not aiming, I’m glad to see it wasn’t just me being terrible with it. 
---
I’m stoked for that Deathclaw gauntlet, basically bloodied with extra power attack damage and defense.
---
Yea.
---
I hope so, Deathclaws are one of the only mobs with reliably useful loot.
---
Have you seen the servers go down?  Have you seen any patches announced?
---
Video games don't run on magic and wishes.  If they have to change something it has to be patched in, if something has to be patched in it has to be patched across ALL platforms or people will start a favoritism riot, if they want to patch across all platforms that means submitting the patch to Microsoft/Sony for certification, if they submit a patch to Microsoft/Sony that means paying cert fees and waiting their turn in line and THEN when they're finally ready to patch in a fix it's going to be two days before they were going to add in the fucking cameras anyway.
---
Having camera challenges in right now IS ridiculous.  ALSO ridiculous is still seeing these fucking threads three days later STILL crying about it.
---
Paranoid much?
---
It's been posted about ad nauseum since the patch, if you were getting downvoted it was probably because any of the 283749 posts about it before yours answered the question already.  Plus calling people names like 'bitch' and 'twat' here *generally* isn't going to go over well.
---
It's a bug, they admitted that it was a bug, and they're working on it (may have said it will be fixed next patch, can't remember for sure).
---
I am always on my mic, but have gotten no weird interactions.
---
What shotgun do u use?  Dont stand too far from your enemy aswell.
---
is this a troll post? 
---
legendary shotguns when specced out are one of the top burst weapons for PvE. on top of that they have the best cripple/stagger in the game thanks to how the pellets work with effects.
---
if your serious try getting closer or spec in the tighter groupings card into the build, if you mean non legendary weapons they are at an ok place imo
---
You can launch nukes at level 1.  50 is when you stop getting SPECIAL points but 90-150 is when you actually finished your build.
---
Let me tell you about my best friend
---
shhh people don't like criticism
---
That's what I thought, cheers! :)
---
I did consider the possibility but he has the Cowboy hat from the shop, an obvious choice to go with the Western Duster, while I have never purchased that hat. Also, my face is actually the first default face in the character creator, and I guess others could have been just as lazy as me and left it like that.
---
Now that is frakkin' awesome!!!
---
Thanks for sharing!
---
Sure, added it but not sure how the charging works in relation to the base damage. You can boost the damage by 100% to get double damage for example.
---
We don't know how the vendor will work yet. I doubt they'll let us re-roll legendary effects on current weapons.
---
That’s the plan. I want more versatility in builds. Can only have so many perks and mods.
---
680+ hrs in and I totally agree. It’s had its issues but what a fun experience it’s been. 
---
Getting together with some friends this weekend for a couch coop gathering and I’ve purchased the tricentennial edition for all three of them just for the hell of it. Just to see if I can get them into it as well.
---
I guess. That and that it's the first default face in the character creator. At least that's what I chose.
---
When the rename option was released, the first thing I did was add **DNS** before everything I want to keep. It moves them to the top of the list so I do t accidentally sell them. Or if I want to scrap them I’ll just a * which does the same thing.  Won’t help if it bugs out, but it’s saved me a few times 😁
---
Sweet! I love having neighbors.
---
On xbox and female, I don't generally use the mic unless the other person has a mic. But not every time as I listen to them for a bit to decide if I wanna mic up or not. Only "Girl!" moment I had was on new years eve. Me and my dad got online and headed the the Whitesprings bar. There  were 3 other players hanging around, none had mics. I was the only one with a female character. I had mine dressed for the occasion cause I thought I'd be fancy, red dress. Two of the other players, power armor and creepy mask(mask with the really long nose), noticed my character and hopped around me. Power armor guy kept throwing up hearts while creepy mask guy threw up the money emote. I was amused and so was my dad, he  was laughing in the other room. He was on mic and told the two, "You don't even know if that's a guy with a girl character." (He's seen a lot of guy players do that) I was very entertained by this whole interaction that I put on my mic and said "Hello everyone, Happy New Year's!" They two guys continued more and when it came time for pictures, posed next to me. The 3rd other player was just chilling and trying to get the best pose.
---
Yeah. Double ammo capacity. 500 rounds with the small magazine. It also has 30% increased fire rate, or however much extra it gets.
---
Possibly but this guy wasn't very cooperative. I barely managed a snap ehile he was trading with the Charlestob Vendorbot Mack.
---
I hate other women
---
Yea i like people being able to visit my camp and not be a dick so i vote no on that shit. I leave my doors open so passers by can get some water and food take a nap and fix their shit. Anyone who wants to be a dick should play survival
---
I don't know what you're talking about. I'm balls deep specced as a rifleman but i do keep some shotguns around. 
---
Instigating combat shotgun, this things wrecks any lightly armored target. It 's a monster close range. Indeed if i try to snipe with it it will barely deal any damage, but close-range it's insane. Everything goes down in one-shot
---
I also have an explosive one but that's another story.
---
And did i mention that i don't have any shotgun perks at all? If the thing is so brutal with 0 perks i find it hard to believe that a shotgun build is worse than rifles. I think you just need to be a close-range kind of build if you want to use shotguns efficiently.
---
Wow, 23 hours ago and using the same gamertag in his username, is this guy for real? Does he think we don't remember?
---
I'd use that up in about 30 Encryptid events as a conduit. Lol. I wish I had that many stimpaks!
---
overpromising and under delivering
---
I was decimating some non queen ScorchBeasts once landed with my zealots dagger in the Fissure Prime Nuked area, no stats but seemed very effective.
---
It’s coming.
---
Yeah, Equip the 3 shotgunner perk cards and enforcer perk, and scattershot aswell, to be honest i think the bloodied or TSE pump shotgun is one of the best weapons there is.. It has a strong durability and its cripples every enemy i encounter...
---
I do like the idea of the box for leaving presents for visitors though
---
No mods are working. Hopefully one of the Bethesda mods sees this and advises on whats going on.
---
yep camps always seem to be right down the road from me in the forest
---
I can probably sell you bulk
---
I had a guy at a workshop smacking me with a Commie Whacker. XD I think maybe he though I was going to contest his workshop, but I was only like level 15 and didn't even know how Workshops work. Or maybe he was just messing around. I just gave him a &lt;3 emote and went on with my day.
---
&gt; I hope you got a 1\* legendary wood arm from the event. 
---
Jesus dude chill out. Taking it a bit far don't you think?
---
Not really, as it can repair over 100% so long as it procs over 100%. Lets you keep that increased damage for longer, which can be worth it for some weapons.
---
This ^ is true, face to face with ScorchBeasts my Combat Shotgun with hardened receiver melt them but if I back off damage drops rapidly.
---
I agree!  I have almost 800 hours in and I love the game!  I have the Tricentennial edition...love the T60 skin.
---
Not even 25 years after the world ends and the Institute is already replacing people.
---
I'm not whining, I'm saying that to do what he said takes a bit of time. When I see the event notifaction that it's started I can go right away and risk people stealing stuff if I die or I can let them solo it for a few minutes while I sort inventory to prevent it which decreases chance of completing it.
---
It's just this community has a fascination with hating on people who want better stash functionality.
---
Data mined info, so it hasn't been announced yet, afaik. But so far it hasn't been off, so chances are as close to 100% as you're likely to get.
---
Is it just me or anyone saving a broken camera on junk itens just in case this new camera content requires this item to craft?
---
The Prize Bot isn't useless I won a Corvega
---
Because I mention SOME problem relating to stash space. This community just hates people who want to actually hold on to junk they earned.
---
The inherent problem with all two shots is that they are inaccurate at long range - the additional shot rarely hits.  I still use my 2 shots but I don’t expect to nail headshots from across the map😂
---
https://reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/be8zap/_/el4ozm9/?context=1
---
I got 67
---
I use a TSE gatling gun for scorchbeasts,  and when they land i just use a deathclaw hand
---
One extra pellet AND it's where all the extra damage from the effect is, so if you're at a range where not all your pellets are hitting your target and that one pellet misses then you're essentially using a regular shotgun.
---
Wow man that's fantastic!
---
It's going to pop my microtransactions cherry and it's going to be painful for my wallet. That's all i know.

 I have all the perks for them including faster swing speed. 
---
 They are absolutely OP. My Nocturnal 40% Speed knife hits around 180 and melts Ghoul Hordes at The Whitespring so well, I get accused of kill theft. ;)
---
Yes, it could be. I'll check as many guns ingame as I can.
---
Why do all that crazy complicated math when you can just drop them in a paper bag on the floor without any worries?
---
Xbox Gamertag?
---
What if they hatch into cute duck-sized baby deathclaws?  
---
That would be awesome!
---
So uh
---
Any updates
---
Anyone know if the exploding Gauss rifle is considered legacy or did it squeeze by as a rifle and not an energy weapon?
---
It's just you
---
They are dirt cheap on amazon right now. Got three tricentennial editions for $45 after tax, I paid more than that for the base game
---
Same thing happened to me when I fast traveled to whitespring, some guy shot me down to 1hp but I guess the new spawn protection saved me cus i didn't take any more damage until about 10 seconds later.ö  
---
Watch this guy's second gif, he does no damage up until the point where the other player brings out his weapon in which case he starts doing damage but by that time the dude had hid behidn the roof and stimmed.  
---
1st gif is just him getting killed plain and simple, probably a lucky ground pounder procc on an auto rifle, second clip is just the first guy using spawn protection (which he obviously needed sicne this guy was right on top of him, lol).
---
That's the other thing. Since I can't fully store my stuff I'm going to play way more conservatively to lower chance of dropping it. Let someone else be a conduit so I don't take damage, etc. I can't stash everything I have so I am carrying easy to reacquire materials (steel/wood/and such). It's not imperative I don't lose this stuff, but I'd rather not.
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/be8zap/still_cant_attach_mods/el4ozes/?context=1000

I jumped on here to see if this was happening to anyone else. I was in game and the server stopped responding. No surprise there. Took me back to the main screen, went to rejoin, and an error popped up. Can't do anything at the moment; not join a new server, nor open the Atom Shop.
---
I was on the other night and only saw #1. Couldn't find 2 or 3 the entire session.

They were datamined 5 months ago and outlined [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/9u1lz9/some_atom_shop_items_data_mined/).  Haven't been released in the game yet, but still in the resources so some day we'll see em I assume.
---
Can anyone confirm just HOW MUCH aid you drop now?  Is it still percentage based?  I'm carrying several hundred pounds of non-perishables, chems and meds WITH Walking Pharmacy so I've avoided the mode like the plague.
---
The legendary ability that gives +10% damage when aiming down sights uses the same flag. That's a little easier to test than accuracy &amp; range.
---
I want that Whitesprings sulfur fountain...
---
Magic, thanks for that! That's a relief haha.
---
I think this idea though I am a bit on the fence about PvP. I would like it as a goodie box for any thirsty travelers or those in need of ammo. they can put their unwanted things in the box.
---
1st gif you probably got staggered by something like ground pounder, second clip is 100% spawn protection.
---
I got it from the Venture Brothers you should check it out it's a great show.
---
Rofl ya me too and I just pre ordered the standard edition
---
GT knucklessyrup i will join

I got spare if you're on PC. Ign Wellibootz

Man you have no idea how true this is lol. Just started recently and am around level 40 and always have my mic in saying Hi to everyone i see. I've only ever heard back from like 3 people lol. On the PS4.
---
Something something Pickman's mother...
---
I’m also full melee build but the lag and swing stuttering often leaves me clicking my mouse frantically while my character gets destroyed my the mob. Ho hum ☹️
---
Facts.
---
Erm, what do I think? Im probably in the minority, but it's ok to have weapons that aren't all the same regarding how effective they are.  Some types should be worse than others.
---
Regarding shotguns themselves, they do their purpose at close range.  Don't use them for sniping.
---
How is being able to like store 1000+ steel abusing it? If they handled stash properly there's no technical reason to limit it. ItemID = Steel, Quantity = 100 is no functional difference from ItemID = Steel, Quantity = 10000.
---
Cheers! :)
---
good work, I sadly however can't compare what I wanted to as the furious prefix for LMG hasn't been added yet. but I shall keep an eye on the page. thanks for sharing.
---
Sadly im on PS4 thanks tho
---
Well yeah I had wondered if they'll ever implement factions along the lines of those that we have all heard about through the main quest. I'm not sure how that would be done, but it's something you would expect to arise in the world after Vault 76 opened. Bit I appreciate that may be some time yet, but it's something I'd like to see.
---
Yeah becouse the community is so greatfull
---
Most of them are pretty weak.
---
* The Gatling gun has a nice damage reduction effect on your target, but the aiming mechanic for those guns *sucks*, making the other two effects difficult to utilize
---
* The sword really **is** good
---
* The Tesla rifle's damage output fluctuates based on time of day, making it really only useful half the time
---
* Harpoon guns are fun, but slow &amp; inaccurate; the VATS boosts are nice, but the Mirelurk damage boost is really too specific to be useful
---
* Deathclaw Gauntlet is pretty good, yes
---
* Double-barrel shotguns get *one* extra pellet from the Two-Shot effect, which is weak
---
It feels super lonely out there. Ps4.
---
Or find an Overseer stash and drop them in that if you can't use your own. Note names of other players on the server before you do it, just in case. IIRC you can "join" them.
---
I have noticed this as well on PC and figured it was just lag issues.  Now I suspect otherwise...
---
That is nice. I suppose I spoke too soon.
---
Do... what? We don't even know what the actual problem is yet. Maybe he was just using assassin/cavaliers?
---
Same man. Same.
---
Can I play it offline?
---
I'm glad you remember our great fondling err I mean fond childhood memories
---
My daughter also games, though she's too young for fo76.  I'm not naive enough to think encounters like this will never happen to her, but I tell her to always speak out when she's in a situation she doesn't feel comfortable with!
---
This doesnt makes sense. Become wanted because you fail picking a lock?  Thats like being punished for being a shitty thief lmao
---
Would be most viable if player camps persisted somehow after logout. But that’s like a big gameplay knot they’d have to untangle.
---
Idk, is there any skill in this game?
---
Would love this too. The tower defense aspect is the most exciting for me, at least it used to be.
---
Personally loving the new update on how foundations work!
---
Already watched it. He legit just dismissed most of the criticism and credited it to trolls and drama channels. Whilst partly true, not everyone that criticised him was a troll or drama channel. He even glossed over the worse accusations against him, the issue with him copyright striking channels and shadow banning people. I don’t see why he would lie. I mean sure, it’s bad for business, but his true fans wouldn’t give a shit what he does.
---
I don’t want to buy anything 
---
It's tricky to tell which is your bag or if someone else already took your bag after you died amidst the mayhem. Why not call it a dropped junk free for all event- if you've lost a 1up.
---
Mom-based shaming club!  Yeah they are.  Most of them do it to get a rise out of people, and it's just stupid.
---
If u don’t need that I’d like to take it
---
Wow - that's kind of hinky. Sure you're not turning into a Scorched Ghoul or something?
---
That'll be $1.95 per part
---
Thank you for being the voice of common sense and sanity. I still think it is a joke that legendary armor can be better than PA.
---
All the time
---
I have no idea what that is, but good on you!  I was thinking some Aqua would be appropriate.
---
Hey girl hey! I play on PS4 also. I will say everyone I’ve met on FO76 has been great, so I’m sorry you’re having so many negative experiences. I mute my mic unless someone speaks to me first and I’ve been able to team up with some really cool guys. I’ve only had one experience where a guy was like “OMG A GIRL” and the rest of the guys I was playing with stuck up for me. 
---
Shoot me an add if you want to play with another girl, same user as Reddit. 😊
---
Sure nice of you and I know most players would do that same and leave someone elses junk alone if they die randomly, just shows how people are naturally good.
---
Mine is in the Ash Heap.
---
It is a lot less, you also less caps, making it less punishing and more rewarding overall.
---
It was my understanding that they deleted duped weapons (and other mass made stuff) from dup accts less one of each. So if you had 100 items you ended with one in your inventory. I don't think Bethesda was tracking weapons beyond that initial adjustment.
---
I have a quad explosive double barrel, and that thing is a monster. I specced it with bloody mess, shotgunner, demolition expert, skeet shooter, and some others. Sure, I can kill an enemy with one-two headshots from my hunting rife, but still.. the shotgun does the same at close range. I can even kill lower-leveled mobs from a long distance
---
What are your favourite places to nuke? I'm completing the final quest today and I'd rather not nuke WS or HF
---
No
---
Can confirm because I have it but there is enclave fatigues
---
Duper’s that had huge stacks of duped weapons had all but one copy removed. I don’t think Bethesda ever targeted single weapons so I’m pretty sure they didn’t take your gun from you. 
---
Tbh I don’t think Bethesda can or will do anything about your lost gun though.
---
Yeah I don’t care wether or not your male or female I just chill on the game you just another player to me
---
Indeed, praise the Almighty Atom!
---
A fountain yes, but one you can get purified water at will? no
---
If you want water put down a water purifier. Since i'm doing more nuke zones and the sheepsquatch events i'm downing radaway, rad shield and stimpacks like crazy. I went from having too much water to almost no water with  5 large purifies at my camp.
---
I'll throw in a few base damage lists from the curve tables:
---
MG42: lvl30 - 29, lvl40 - 34, lvl50 - 42
---
50cal: lvl25 - 29, lvl35 - 36, lvl45 - 43
---
Gatling: lvl20 - 43, lvl30 - 57, lvl40 - 72, lvl50 - 86
---
Gat laser: lvl25 - 18, lvl35 - 21, lvl45 - 25
---
Gat plasma: lvl30 - 43, lvl40 - 50, lvl50 - 58
---
Tell me if you need any others. I forget what's changed.
---
Idm that, for me that event is the only thing thats is a challenge in the game..
---
a nice info/website!
---
Ring a ding ding
---
To be honest I reckon they should remove dropping loot from Adventure mode. YES it adds an extra element of concern to make you want to avoid dying, but it's mostly just a frustrating extra bit of stress when partaking in events and other players are near.
---
You can gladly have it
---
I don't know why you get downvotes when everything you said is true.
---
My daughter is almost 18. Living with her Aunt. She always calls or texts during an extremely tough fight. I can tell it is her. She will text 'mom' until I answer. Lol.
---
My oldest thinks Fallout is for nerds, and enjoys Fortnite and minecraft, the little one is happy to sit in my lap with my old 360 controller, and help me 'pick up after the zombies.' Because they're tired and cranky, and after to put them down for naps, we have clean up their mess.
---
:D
---
Both female and PS4 gamer and I've stuck with mic off after launch when I ran in to some sexiest pig. 
---
Ironic when I play my male vault dweller I've always had a greater experience and invited on to numerous teams.
---
Mean while my beta Female VD was targeted by a few griefers once I was past level 5 at the start, sadly I've stuck to the male VD a lot more for more chill times.
---
I've had a lot of positive hours playing through the wastelands from other great vault dwellers in the end!
---
My wife and I play FO76 and other games together. Started with CoD 8 years ago. Let’s just say that we’ve been strictly in party chats (on Xbox this auto muted anyone not in the party chat) for those 8 years. Between the disgusting comments and normal amount of racial slurs, we have a better time not talking to other players. It’s also very rare for us to talk to anyone that isn’t a IRL friend in games. There have been times where we invite people who seem cool, they get pissed or something cuz they are playing bad, and then BOOM racial slurs, or they start targeting my wife with sexist comments. 
---
The few times male gamers have harassed my wife for having a black female avatar in-game... let’s just say they had to leave the server because we hunted them down. The first time it happened we both had shotguns at a low level and we chased a guy around for no joke an hour killing him a few times. Ever since I mow people down with my heavy weapons and she blows them up with explosives. It’s a glorious sight.
---
i didnt manage to die, but i did waste so much ammo, like you it was dark and i was alone at home that night, thanks to F.E.A.R. i ended up mag dumping my 85 round handmade drum into it
---
You don't play anymore, so that's an improvement.
---
They are gonna have to accept it, because the only way a game can improve is from the devs listening to criticism, especially when it can be used constructivly.
---
At the same time though I never asked for just unlimited stash space. I basically asked for a specific list of like 15 or so items that stack (with a quantity variable) to be unlimited (effectively, like even if it was to 10k, that's extremely plenty).
---
I made a new character just for survival weekly challenges. and once i am about to complete it, I switch over to my main character and finish it to get the weapon
---
Could you share a pic?
---
Sounds like you are in sissy mode
---
I just stayed top side right around the vendor bot. The groups of super mutants would spawn about ever 2 minutes by the train and by the chem station. I didn't get any good legendary items, but raked in around 10 legendary items. 
---
I hope they don't catch on and nerf the legendary spawns in this area.
---
I'll be honest I have overhyped the burrows and was disappointed. But in hindsight i see it was my fault
---
They never did what you are thinking.
---
People with 1 duped gun never had them taken away by Bethesda.
---
Those pics are something
---
Finger crossed! Having RP-light'ed as the Mysterious Savior/Stranger for a couple of months now, I feel like my paparazzi-game is starting to improve now and I'm hyped for sitting in the bushes somewhere, snapping a shot of another team going to do the challenge together or something (not too many friends of my own to do them with heh).
---
Quits playing cause company sells jacket
---
Asks if games good how since jacket release 
---
Correlations 0%
---
I'll leave this link here. Its another reddit user saying the same thing I am. I cant find the original PAX East video anymore, but thats where Todd Howard talked about the system. If anyone else can find the story it would be a huge help.
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/b715dw/legendary_vendor_tokens_confirmed/
---
&gt; I have speed demon. I maxed Class Freak and Stimpacks still barely heal me.
---
Speed Demon doesn't have any relation to Stimpacks...
---
It’s definitely a super mutant hound
---
Girl her. I only mic with my other girl friend. Otherwise I have chat off, mostly due to social anxiety though.
---
I was thinking the same. Ive been tied to one place since they patched out some of the foundation glitches. Hopefully this will allow for making adjustments without erroring it out.
---
50 hrs old... You are way too young to play this game, it's rated M for Mature. While I understand that exclude most of it's male player base, not even being 3-days old is just too young. :)
---
I didn't quit because of the jacket. I don't care about the jacket. It was just a point of reference for when I stopped playing.
---
Agreed! Thought it would look better at night... nope...
---
On the webpage op linked
---
You get 2 x the ammount of in your face explosions
---
Just about everyone on PC is either a high level or a high level playing and leveling up an alt.  There are no more non high levels at this point.  But this sub is laced with Bethesda apologists and blind fanbois so I'm not surprised they're just making up lame excuses to defend the game.
---
The bugs from the last patch just stuck another fork into an already dying game...  without high levels, the servers would be almost empty.
---
I logged in today to grab the second egg and it said I already grabbed it. And it is for sure in my build menu (and now hidden behind a mutfruit tree)
---
And I wasn't even talking about the game but the article itself.
---
Just started a week or so ago. There's glitches but it's still a fun game. Never played a Bethesda game that wasn't buggy, or a new MMO that didn't have issues for that matter.
---
If playing a video game was the biggest mistake you've ever made, you've led a sheltered life.
---
My thought was to only drink from it, not collect. 
---
With 5 water purifiers, you should be able to restock your water in no time.
---
I think by having this theoretical fountain a collection point, it would over inundate the already readily available purified water supply.
---
*butthurt alert*
---
Not all of us just complain for the sake of it.
---
I do I have 50 but I can make more, and I will sell them for 3 caps.
---
Pretty sure it's cosmetic but that would be like nawwww
---
A bit. If two people with the same equipment fight, the one using better strategics,aim etc. always wins. But yeah for skill we all should go to CSGO
---
Ouch. Got any purified water I could use for this sick burn?
---
What is ur psn?
---
 My PC, about to be replaced, runs the game smooth and fast. Its 8 years old but I have a GTX 1070 to push the pixels.
---
 My new machine should be substantially better. ;)
---
 I run a balanced build myself, very rare indeed. ;) My knives are very good. My Instigating Lever Action is outstanding, my Handmade as well is very effective and I have an Auto Grenade Launcher for general hilarity, with my Explosion Proof armor equipped.
---
Umm.. that doesn't sound like it's BETHESDA'S fault. You took a risk, you knew you were taking a risk, did it anyway... Got burned.
---
So solly.
---
Two words; The Beast, that is what i have called my tse minigun that i used the other day to vaporise this persons turrets on the camp behind the club house, then they repaired, and i did it again
---
I literally helped create fallout 4 multiplayer. Which didn't have any tools already made for the game to do that. None of the tools out for nodding Beth games could have been used to make the multiplayer mod.
---
I didn't make any games in dog maker, I made a couple from scratch in c# made a couple in the unreal engine, and am now working on games in an oen source engine you've probably never heard of called godot.
---
Want to make more incorrect assumptions?
---
CONGRATULATIONS!
---
Alright!
---
Any positives? If not, you should stay away. That way you won’t have to worry about posting out of disappointment anymore. As for me, I’m enjoying the game despite its flaws. Best wishes on the next game.
---
They're the ones that suck. You shouldn't have to censor yourself cause pigs roam free without consequences. Record &amp; Report. And if you feel really chipper, you can ask them how they would like it if somebody talk to their mothers. sisters or girlfriends like that.
---
If you haven't already, try relogging a few times. I've had weird visual bugs where equipment doesn't show in the inventory screen, and sometimes where it shows multiple copies of the same equipment. Subsequent relogs usually return the inventory to proper functionality.
---
Lmao you didn't join an empty world. You can't see other players in survival modes except for the top 3 kills.
---
Stimpacks are 55% less effective with it
---
get a broom
---
I agree, it doesn't reflect weight in a world container. 🤷‍♂️
---
Can someone post a pic?
---
I ate 2 footling subs in my 20s... I know regret.
---
No starting this game again was the biggest mistake ever cant even play anymore cause performance went down the drain. And not its not my PC i played at launch 60 FPS at al times.
---
Only a GTX 750 ti the Game runs okay with settings turn down to medium but perhaps this is my problem just to old a card 😕
---
Good luck with your new rig 👍
---
I don’t know about PS4 but everyone on PC is either very respectful to girls or surprised and I know about 4 personally (I’m not one of them) that all have different play styles (raider, traders etc.) and all of them are treated no different.
---
Expert Picklock is available from level 19. If you can't see it under Perception when selecting perks then you're missing the scroll controls. You can scroll through both SPECIALs and perk cards.
---
You can't do that much damage by level 25 but you'll want to start choosing your perks properly from now.
---
Thanks. Updated the ballistic numbers. 
---
I haven't included energy weapons yet as I'm not sure about energy damage yet, as it may depend on range coefficient: https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Damage_Resistance#For_Energy_Damage
---
What are you talling about?  If anything, the Enforcer perk for shotguns is OP!
---
Try to tonight. Light gray fatigues with I think purple, dark gray camo blotches.  Never really worn them. At work or I'd get on that
---
No i did i was third place on the world didnt even get a kill or stay more than 5 minutes
---
just replace it.  Cheaper.
---
I missed the first one. :(
---
That is a LONG standing bug that can happen just about anywhere and kill pretty much anything instantly.  Just shit luck that it happened to you during that particular quest.
---
When I did motherload, I thought I should be something that you can repeat. When I finally did this months later, it was an aha! moment.
---
was there new side quests lilke these with the nukashire and parade?
---
F :(
---
The rank takes a while to adjust when you just join. Also, there may have been other players with zero kills as well.
---
Two shot are best used with shotguns and automatic attacks that have a spread.
---
\&gt;  I went from having too much water to almost no water  
---
Inert flux takes care of that :)
---
I just played through The Burrows last night!!! And I was pleasantly surprised. I took my time and enjoyed it very much. Going to go back through today when I get home from work. Everything looked awesome and the music/scenery was quite impressive. I also loved the fact that I had the pleasure of fighting a 3 Star Legendary Ghoul that dropped a 3 Star Legendary unyielding marine armor leg!!! That was a real treat. I was lucky enough that I had the whole place to myself for half the play through. Only downside? I had some low level players shooting everything with a missile launcher ?! Other than that, good stuff!!
---
Using 2 perk cards (if you want to go the cost effective route) + dense doesnt inhibit your build its literally 1 perk point and you have 2 endurance
---
Furious depends on successive hits. Afaik, each hit increases the damage by 15% up to 150% total. Just use the Other/Buffs percentage to add as much buff as you'd like.
---
It’s all about those perks.
---
Well, more accurately, dont FAST travel there :P  
---
hoof it the old fashioned way so you can get the drop on them while they are focusing on spawn camping :)
---
Where did i refuse to watch his video? I didn't, I checked the "repsonse" from oxhorn that is just a "nuh uh they are lying" response with no substance or evidence. 
---
He wants to stop losing subs and get views back he is gonna have to release his report history. He won't though because we all know it's full of report abuse.
---
Yo, what if the eggs belong to the Easter Deathclaw? Maybe she’ll visit us!
---
I stopped locking doors, if someone wants water go for it
---
What was the plan??
---
Ok so #1 you are mad because your computer can't handle the game?  #2 you jumped into survival without any knowledge of the mode and got your ass handed to you. This game is def unplayable, going to uninstall right now lol. You should just delete this before you get shit on by the entire forum.
---
Doesn't exist sadly
---
I tried that, now it’s just screaming at me. What a strange bird.
---
Lol yeah a Deathclaw wearing bunny ears. I'd love to see that.
---
You add them as a friend...
---
Baaa
---
Hmm, alright. Thanks!
---
no it does not
---
I'm playing on Xbox one and a buddy is playing on console. We don't get graphic stutter unless we're in the middle of a big show somewhere.
---
Sorry you're not having fun, but I'm glad you blogged about it.
---
Also just wanted to add you weren't on an empty world in survival; you can't see other players except for the top few on the leaderboard, this is by design and is literally explained in the FAQ about survival mode.
---
Good luck with whatever you do though.
---
Using 2 perk cards (if you want to go the cost effective route) + dense doesnt inhibit your build its literally 1 perk point and you have 2 endurance you have the other 48/9 points to build whatever you want
---
How lol
---
Thank you good sure, this will be a great help.
---
My Computer could handle the game during launch no problems and now i get FPS drops constantly so this is definetly because the games performance went down the drain
---
Eat it. Free roast beast is not a gift to take lightly lol
---
Yeah, i understand you.  People on here can be very salty or reacting hysterical on some things in the game. For example the burrows: yeah bethesda overhyped it and yes it wasnt challenging and yeah the quest wasn't special..  I  didnt expect much of it when they announced it. I have to admit that i  was hoping it would be content to  give a high level player something else to do, something more challenging. But i knew it would be too good to be true.. So i explored the burrows, finished it in less than 10 min.  But i wasnt dissapointed. I am glad to have a new location to explore finding junk or legendaries.  I didnt had any urge to get on reddit  and start ranting like a kid that lost his bag of candy..   Game companies are just like other companies.  They will announce new products/new content , making you believe its the best thing u need... Untill u get it and notice its nothing special.

What platform are you on? That may help people advise you. If you are on Xbox just press the Xbox button got to the friends menu and then find people. Type in their gamer tag and there you go
---
Dang that sucks, because imo the armor is the most aesthetically pleasing to look at
---
How cute. Such lovable, majestic creatures. I hear if you feed them, they bring you trinkets.
---
I was Number 3 on the leaderbord instantly while joining so was probably empty
---
Personal spawn... Loot time limit - for example fill it with 100 waters and anyone can grab say 2 per 24 per their character so they don’t take all of them.
---
social menu where it says "add a friend" you type in the name.
---
There's really not a lot of positive things to talk about though.  The negativity reflects the lack of meaningful progress in positive ways for the game overall.
---
well it'll 100% be a cosmetic, but here's hoping it'll at least be a cool one.
---
Identity theft is not a joke, Jim! Millions of families suffer every year!
---
...but on an already existing camp, does it know which piece was first?
---
What a joke. So.. You have a shitty PC, didn't try adjusting anything, didn't read how Survival works and are butthurt. Get outta here.
---
Sounds easy, but it won't work as you said. Laws do not work so simply in different countries. If you have enough evidence about insults or sexual harassment only penalty that can happen is banned account and even that is really hard to prove.
---
Thanks for the help
---
Well bye
---
As far as I am aware, no. All we got with those two updates that could be considered somewhat similar is the daily quest that is given by Biv.
---
Got a furious 3* knuckle 2-3 nights ago, it's actually pretty damned good &amp; I'm not sure spec'd for unarmed (yet)
---
No one has the right to tell you or others how to play or enjoy a game you own.
---
You have every right to tell folks to, STFU if they cross personal boundaries and  push their opinions or agenda on you.
---
I do understand your apprehension about using a mic, but i suggest if it makes more sense OR convenience to verbally tell them rather then type, STFU, then use the mic. 👍
---
Happy hunting/gaming.
---
Lol.  Actually it's more like CONGRATULATIONS!  KA-BOOM!
---
less of these circlejerk posts please.
---
Yes but you see I'm the Assistant Regional Manager whike he is the Assistant *to* the Regional Manager so...

You weren't. Leaderboard takes several minutes to recognize a change in longevity or even recognize your existence.
---
Cool story tho
---
CHECKING YOUR COMMENT HISTORY, you complain about OTHER PC GAMES dropping frames too? Face it, it's a YOU problem.
---
You should send a petition to the FAA. That pilot is *obviously* not flying at the minimum safe altitude.
---
MICHAEL!!!
---
yes i have a bloodied swingspeed knuckles
---
It's... Us
---
Mama Deathclaw Will come with bunny ears on the 7th
---
If you don't know what's going on recently in a game, why would you start in the PVP server?
---
MICHAEL!!!!
---
The Unstoppable Monster is basically my Furious Mole Miner Gauntlet, except Bloodied.  I'd say the name checks out.
---
Not a very exciting Inside the Vault though.  I thought they would have taken some time to address the things that have been delayed and when we might expect them now.
---
Great, now there’s poop everywhere.
---
Hahaha, cranky zombies!
---
&gt; fallout 4 multiplayer.
---
That huge mod that *everyone* talks about? holy fuck, can I get your autograph?
---
You're a modder that thinks his college-level games made in unreal engine make you qualified to tell real game developers what to do.
---
You're like a college freshman taking advanced programming that thinks they're now an elite hacker.
---
I'm hoping it's maybe future addition type stuff. Seems odd to ignore it.
---
We are on the edge now. Free fall soon. I am really excited as well. There is very stable ground after free fall.
---
It seems like it glitches too far into the wall when it's placed.
---
Yeah, I thought that was you tooling around The Whitesprings the other day.  I wondered where you got that.
---
Yes it is unfortunate it seems like we a raising a batch of keyboard warriors that for what ever reason love to shit talk any females.  I for one would mic up and take to anyone defense if I witnessed this type of bad behavior we have to send the message to these little trolls that this will not stand and they need to grow up.  Don't stop the mom shaming  yall this game is for everyone not just 14 year old living in their mom's basement  Stop being jerks to the ones that gave us life I for one don't want to play with only asshat male adolescents .....
---
thanks for the reply, i will take another look.
---
Bonehammer
---
There are often frame drops as you're loading in, because the world is loading. After the first few seconds it should be stable.
---
The plot thickens!
---
Tap it several times in the head with a hammer.
---
3 for fireproof under endurance. DENSE is a armor mod.
---
Its pretty much up to gear, surroundings and what not. Its still fun but a lot of people are outmatched but Sent/Ass
---
I'll make a few and see what happens.  Thanks.
---
There is currently about one million "Bethesda please" -request in a queue so please be patient.
---
Your report is still useless, griefing is legal.
---
Can you check the tables for the Hardened mod. Does it add a percentage bonus or a flat number?
---
Actually, there are plenty of valid reasons for the bodies to not have decomposed.  The low-level background radiation probably kills a lot of the airborne bacteria that would normally accelerate decomposition.  The temperature has an effect as well, and dry conditions could result in partial mummification instead.  Body Decomposition is a complicated process, and the factors affecting it are numerous.  Under normal conditions, you'd expect most of those bodies to be pretty badly decayed, but this post-apocalyptic radiated wasteland isn't "normal" conditions.....
---
I bet you scrolled down and just read about fps Drops without knowing the context. I got FPS Drops on that game because another programm interfered with it.
---
I had to craft 24 camera films yesterday, I was really confuaed tryna find a usuable camera
---
 its your PC. My 8 year old one, about to be replaced runs the game fast and smooth.
---
I didn’t! I just want more camp stuff haha. It’s what I spend most of my time doing now.
---
Try a new server?
---
Too funny!
---
Don’t have Internet?
---
Nothing will kill you faster than a few gutsies with AP bullets.  The mirelurk queen is tame by comparison.
---
Fixing things is not in high priority on Bethesda so don't worry.
---
I can offer you the following (guns for 500 ea, melee weapons for 200 ea, all are 1* and max lvl except where stated):
---
Bloodied .44 Pistol
---
Bloodied 10mm Submachine Gun
---
Bloodied Submachine Gun (.45)
---
Bloodied Pickaxe
---
Bloodied Machete, 2* (+1* sacrificial blade), 40% faster swing speed, 800 caps
---
Oh yeah buddy, I'm sure it did.
---
I have a 3* Executioner's knuckles. Limb damage and can't remember the third atm.
---
Lack of direction simply leads to more choices being fixed later on. Every level after 50 you can choose any perk card, or move one special point. You still get packs every 5 levels.
---
I had lack of direction until around 35ish, but then locked down my stealth sniper build. It took me around 10-15 levels to fix my choices, but I'm still glad i have the perks I chose so I can swap when needed.
---
Tldr It's not super detrimental, it'll just add a little time to fix, honestly no biggy.
---
Should just stop complaining and play survival mode. Seems to have been mentioned somewhere else.
---
What? My shotgun is the best. You have to be close, because it's, you know, a shotgun. It's not a sniper rifle.
---
ok, the two shot will let you have a chance at recovering more of your spikes, the biggest downfall of it imo is the ammo weight.  even with bandoleer it still is very hefty on top of a medium weight weapon
---
Speed Demon?  You mean Healing Factor?
---
Negative of Speed Demon is you have higher thirst/hunger while moving.
---
Er., and preventing camp damage?
---
As a dude, it pisses me off that people would treat a girl like that. I'm not a violent person, but if I saw a guy harassing a woman in person I'd punch them in the face.
---
What are u talking about, there are no bugs in FO76 XD
---
Vampire is awesome on a shotty, I can be right there and don't even need stims.
---
Female player here as well. I have a feminine gamer tag and I play a woman in game. I've only come across a couple of weirdos. Otherwise I use the mic when I'm in teams and I have a group of guys i play with who are super awesome. Top notch. I've had good luck in that regard. Otherwise I tend to keep the mic off in a stranger situation unless absolutely necessary. I never use the mic for area chat. (Ok I did once to tell one guy to piss off when he was harassing everyone in the taxidermy shop) Props to the guys I play with as well for looking out for me if someone is strange.
---
Commenting from base Xbox One compared to my decent PC: Xbox performs better *marginally*. Loading is longer on my Xbox, but gameplay more stable. I don't have a monster rig, however.
---
Brotherhood of Gallium....
---
The moment the heat hits, they melt....
---
The PA edition comes with a nylon bag instead of the promised Canvas bag. May want to check that.
---
The pilot cannot take the charge because of a bullet right between his eyes ;)
---
What do you want instead? Maybe I can work out a deal, I've been looking for an excuse to try Bloodied...
---
I agree, it should bring top dollar prices  from a number of people
---
I have a set of 3* knuckles
---
So the problem with this is it took a data miner looking through game files to find this instead of it being listed as part of the item, which IMHO is where it should be.  If that's how its going to work at least let us know that.
---
Or instead of saying it has a 500 rad resist say it has a 98% rad resist.
---
But it doesn't affect anything. You're complaining about nothing.
---
So my PC suddenly got worse after i stopped playing a few Months???
---
If you want the Marine Armor Helmet go PC want the Tactical one go for Xbox
---
I've got some and i' ll hold on to any more i get for you
---
I do, but pretty shitty land line. I'm living in a kind of secluded area
---
Anyone have anywhere besides north of abbies bunker? Ive gone there 20-30 times and only thing that spawns is the scorch beast
---
Probably whichever one is attached to a stair.
---
Lever Action always outclasses hunting rifles
---
You need a Legendary Fly Swatter
---
Depends on PC specs and which Xbox.
---
Huh, never thought of that, not a bad idea honestly.  Makes it easier to handle perk loadouts and weight.
---
Go tame a cat, it will take care of your bird problem.
---
There's some serious turbulence out in the wastelands.....
---
Bummer
---
I was wandering away from the area near the sunken church and found a safe in the back of a pickup truck near a dug up grave yard type area that needs a key? Anyone else found this safe and know where the key is? The key has no name, just says needs a key??
---
I have a bloodied heavy gunner I pvp with and do ok, if you're not going bloodied you'll want armor piercing because of losing the effects from stabilized (without pa)  But bloodied does enough damage to kill most anyone
---
I use my mic all the time.  I have never had anyone in FO76 openly acknowledge the fact that I am a woman other than one person who, ironically, was another woman.  This has actually been a very pleasant surprise because male toxicity was a large part of why I stopped playing PvP games years ago.
---
I'm really sorry that people were being shitty to you.  If you're on PS4 and aren't turned off by stupid humor and crass language, come hang out anytime.  My PSN is Neojinnx.  I'm on most evenings, EST time zone.

Fallout 76 has been pretty chill, but when people are skeptical about the harassment female gamers get online, I send them to this series:   [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jL0aVqVslSE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jL0aVqVslSE) 
---
Rainbow Six is more toxic in general, but girl gamers go through this every day.
---
I like the sight just the way it is thank you very much.
---
I've heard and seen it's best during /just after a nuke, far more going on.
---
I was gonna post this..never mind now
---
Now you will die.
---
Because i thought the premise was fun and doing pure PVE si boring for me since i mostly oneshot everything.
---
Oh definitely! The Prydwin was pretty easy too, I didn't even have to shoot Maxon I just found him passed out on the bridge!

This game isnt about common sense. If it was then explain the legendary effects of Vampires, Bloodied, Nocturnal, etc. Its a game that also takes place in the future. Maybe raiders are super smart when making rad resistant armor?
---
Seriously though I wish a hazmat suit was a piece of clothing instead or a modifiable piece of armor so we can improve on its defense from ballistic and energy damage as well.
---
I’d probably never use either, but I heard all about the outrage. Thanks for the heads up.
---
Only benefit for a hunting rifle is the recon scope. Other then that lever always wins.
---
They need to make the golf course a no build zone before introducing indestructible camps. I'd prefer camps only being indestructible in the forest region or something like that.
---
In the low-mid 400s DR/ER with 60-80 RR...  its not all armor though.  Scaly Skin, Barbarian and Evasive have become a staple of what I factor into builds to make them tanky.  On my non heavy gunner, I have Grounded too.  Also Bird Bones and some +1 AGL pieces help the Agility on my non bloodied heavy gunner, the bloodied build is easily way above 15 AGL needed for maximum Evasive from unyielding pieces.
---
Guess wich one is the synth
---
Maybe speed demon is bugged I just googled it and some other players have had the same issue
---
PC doesn’t require a game service subscription right? I’m leaning more towards it because I don’t feel like paying Microsoft to use my own internet. I don’t play enough to warrant a constant subscription.

Not me hahahah. Right? Right...? Hah...hah.
---
I have Speed Demon.   Faster Reload, Faster Movement, -50% hunger/thirst while moving.
---
Healing Factor is the one that reduces Chems by 55%.
---
I have a version saved. Not sure how much better it is compared to what you've found
---
grandmas basement, dialup?
---
Same here and I love making it in so many styles. I can't wait to decorate with all my stuff from my stash box soon.
---
Will be a lot harder to get a wanted level with no slap damage and indestructible camps.
---
That might be the case since i couldnt led it get stable because i got killed immediatly while spawning.
---
How about TSE weapon fountain? Oh I forgot it was just removed from the game, but it would still work because they are so common in the game anyway.
---
The Tactical one you can get(sort of bug eye looking one), but not the armour one. It only exists in some peoples inventory from when people got into the Dev room and nicked a bunch, scrapped them giving the plan, or just dropped it and someone else picked it up and so forth.
---
I have some female friends and we just use discord for everything. Plus it helps with groups larger than 4
---
Great utility.  Bookmarked!
---
I was just wondering about my two guns earlier, when using an AA/E lever gun and an AA/E handmade against a mirelurk queen.  There was a clear discrepancy in how fast it's health bar was depleting, the handmade tearing the queen up with much more efficiency despite having significantly lower base damage.  Both have hardened receivers and the only damage related difference is the AP on the magazine mod of the handmade.
---
Without going into too much detail about perks etc (unless you want that kind of info) the stinging mag on the handmade makes a **huge** difference against bugs, bots, deathclaws and other armored targets.
---
Despite being a bit slower with more recoil, I think I'm going to look into acquiring a hunting rifle again for "very large game".
---
That was my assumption as well, I had a feeling dev room was involved.
---
Yeah I love running and super punching mobs. Even jumping and on the descendant down adds damage!
---
Mmm, it's actually hard to compare base weapons because while some might have better base stats, some might have better mods
---
I'm not a fan of bloodied builds, I was thinking about using something with AAE, about the stabilized it's a nice perk but I wouldn't have the bonus from my assassins/sentinel, that's why I thought about not using PA. I don't know if it worth the trade off.
---
ak56thethird
---
Thats a good roll!
---
the real question is  "Why are you on lvl 175 and don't know the answer to your own question?"
---
O this couldn’t be further from the truth. The key to shotguns is the explosive effect. It forces the pellets into a tighter spread so they don’t loose drop off damage from close range to mid range. I run a full power armor low health bloody build (normal armor doesn’t buff shotguns and it’s not a crit build).  I have Emergency Protocol on the armor for defense.
---
I use a mix of Instigating/anti armor/bloody but all their secondary effects are explosive.  The IE Double Barrel I have will one shot a mirelurk Queen from full health with my full adrenaline proc.
---
Here is my build

---
With the defense perks and managing my health with radiation.  I don’t ever die.  I’m just hoping they don’t need shotgun damage again. It’s that OP IMO.
---
I am not a girl, but here's what I do. I hardly play alone but when I do, I keep my mic muted and use emotes with other players. I will occasionally unmute if they aren't saying some crazy stuff.  So if they talk and dont seem like a jerk i might unmute and actually talk to them.
---
Nice sword legendary, too bad all my friends are scared of the game. 😢
---
Hey I'm just reporting what I saw! His coat makes a pretty good toilet cosy back at Sanctuarry doe :^ )
---
I put my PC together back when FALLOUT 4 came out (with decent specs for the time, nothing outrageous), and it runs 76 just fine. There's occasional stuttering, but I think that's just inherent in the game/servers. Stability is fine, I've crashed maybe once or twice.
---
wait where’d you find this?
---
Cheers to that MS
---
mine works...
---
The zealot effect works on any enemy that has the title "Scorched", so practically all enemies in the Scorched Earth event, though I wouldn't recommend walking into a nuke zone in only just armour! XD
---
Usas PC?
---
Be cool to see a video tour
---
Is the wise ass comment really called for??
---
I think I've seen your PSN on my server before and pretty recently, too.  I tend to scan the names and yours is one that stands out.
---
I'll take my Bloodied lever to any fight. Got a VATS build that can 1/2 shot a room of lvl 68 mutants.
---
looking for a BE/IE/QE lever...nobody will give them up.
---
Yes, confirmed Patch 9, early may.

Are either of yall on PC?? :D
---
Ah man I’m glad that worked out in the end with the messages, but I’m so sorry people were being gross to you. I’ll never understand what the fuck is wrong with dudes. I’m glad you’re looking on the positive side of it though, hope people leave you the fuck alone from now on. :/
---
Nah, think about lighthouses
---
This is awesome, but it’s a little inaccurate on bloodied builds.
---
Maybe adding nerd rage and adrenal reaction would help
---
Can’t wait to see how this turns out website bookmarked !
---
Who did?
---
 Watta you got? Mine is ancient with an i5 750 but I do have a GTX 1070 and the game has always run fast and smooth. Not quite maxxed but up there.
---
Looks awesome, are you on pc? Id love to check it out ingame
---
Hell YEAH dude. It’s what they deserve.
---
Woaaah nice, I awlays sayw that location while walking dwon the tracks from station to station, but never knew (or tried to) you could get up there! Nice place OP!
---
Its good to have a general direction of where you want to go. Cards like weapon smith (or melee makeshift warrior), weapon artisan, pick lock (3 separate cards) are cards that you will want regardless of build. You will have to move some points when you hit 50+, but for now I would recommend deciding what type of weapon suits your play style, and mildly focus on that. You want to get the 3 level 1 versions of the card rather than maxing 1 of them as you will end up with 10% more damage, then max them later. I say mildly invest because its less levels to fix a more utilitarian build if you suddenly decide to go rifles over melee than it is to swap 15 str to 15 per and pick all the new cards. (if you do go full melee its not hard to swap to heavy though).
---
I may be missing some, but off the top of my head:
---
STR: melee/heavy
---
PER: rifle/auto rifle (smg are auto rifles)
---
AGI: pistol/auto pistol/sneak (not great end game imo)
---
There are cards that support in other SPECIALs, so if you find yourself with a balanced stat distribution it isn't the end of the world, just may take you a few extra levels to perfect.
---
Loot scales to the enemies level, a level 40 ghoul won’t drop level 50 loot.
---
eBay 👀
---
They should have a mode where you play as chameleon deathclaw vs hunters.
---
you could have gave me 50 guesses and I'd have never said lighthouses, what ever your job is I want it.
---
The hardened receivers have a multiplier, but it's zero for some reason. Not sure where it's getting the real data from.
---
The hunting rifle 50cal receivers do add +12.5% and +25%, for what that's worth. Oddly enough, the hardened receiver does come out with a one-point damage difference from the refined 50cal receiver, IIRC.
---
I agree... As long as they expand the no build zone around white springs. I'm tired of turret farms.
---
Right. Bethesda Launcher - no fees.
---
Note to Bethesda: Remove survival aspect of the game.
---
Must say so myself from the minute I first logged in on release, to this very day. I'm obsessed, got to 7th prestige in the new call of duty. Got sick of it and needed something new (not so fast paced) glad I decided on fo76 because its exactly what I was looking for. I feel as though fo76 has so much potential to be even greater with the addition of end game content, keeping fingers crossed. Looks like they are headed in the right direction. Keep the content coming
---
Go pick a lock on a world container in a claimed workshop. This has made me accidentally wanted more times than I care to admit. Or steal a supply drop.
---
very nice and if you want to be extra protect just remove a section of the ladder before going away
---
Yeah I've personally avoided the helmet, even though I like it, just in case my account gets flagged because they can track the helmets ID I believe and see who has it.
---
The song is ironic because you are listening to music for enjoyment, and instead you got this.
---
True but it does know it currently, certain situations you can only put a foundation if it can be next to existing one. I know this since had a major problem building my base on a lake where it wouldn't let me delete it till I deleted the one it was supporting but Im hoping they don't keep track.

All the better to grow your Tato's my friend.

these damn wastelanders. They are good for nothing.
---
Super Sledge and Grognak Axe are equal.
---
The sledge has 1 mod and the Grog weighs half as much.
---
Im not sure if my game is glitching? Ive collected two eggs so far and they are not there for me to put in my camp... is anyone else having this problem? Its not in my floor decor section.. im so confused!😩
---
I love it, too. It's so fun. 
---
It's got issues, but it's gotten so much better, and I can't wait to see everything they do with it.
---
Always check the blue suitcases at trainstations. I drop all my unwanted ammo and plans in there. Have also found a few plans I was missing. Great little secret of the wasteland.
---
I’ll take it
---
No subscription!
---
Damn i met a few girls while playing this game and they were great one that seemed so innocent and sweet that i will share in this sub in a bit, maybe
---
Yeah, try not being on the PVP server?
---
I see where you’re coming from and I’m genuinely curious - do you see a lot of people coming through your camp to rest, drink and fix stuff?
---
Yes ppl have been saying they dnt see them. Shud b in floor decor. Line wit the deathclaw statue PA statue and vaultboy lawn gnome :)
---
Thanks for this. As a. ADDITION, it is great.
---
On xbox and can't mod a single thing. Not one...
---
This guy knows his stuff.
---
As night stalker said, the bone hammer has higher base damage, but it takes no mods so it cant be double repaired, and cant currently be legendary so overall super sledge is the best
---
Don't think I'm able to post images on here. Could I do it in a chat? Currently on phone as I'm out
---
Yea
---
Yeah but it's always good idea to get a feel for the land before tossing yourself into PVP. Coming to reddit before and reading people's experiences would probably have been helpful, too.
---
There's one quest reward chest piece called Last Bastion.
---
How about better stairs?
---
That’s cool - like a pay it forward kinda thing. I’ll take out some .308 and leave some shotgun shells...
---
After I found out that Silo code pieces disappear after 48 hours after looting them, i gave up on trying to launch any nukes. I want to explore in peace, and not be pressured by a hidden timer. I had like 5 for alpha and bravo and 2 for charlie. Fuck that shit
---
I recently completed a challenge called "make a friend" thats ALOT for a fallout player ya know (jk lol)
---
The Fire Axe also causes bleed damage with the spikes mod.
---
You can claim it no problem, but defend event is suicide.
---
Um OP for the guy killing you, everyone can see who is in the Top 3 of the leader board, it's encouraged that other people try and hunt them down. There are other people, but they're hidden so it isn't a full out murder fest half the time.
---
And in survival you do lose aid and stuff in great quantities, it should be mentioned on the pop up before you join survival.
---
Would love that! A mode where a player or players play as monsters to outsmart the humans or could just be an overpowered Chameleon Deathclaw being controlled by one player.
---
Theres always a chance with the legendary vendor that itll allow you to put effects onto non legendary weapons and armour. Obv this is just some speculation though
---
Nah. Steal without guilt.
---
Nice! I guess the hunt continues.
---
That would be nice.  Trying to join friends on discord and having them wait up to 30 minutes for everyone to join in on an Encryptid or SBQ is kinda tedious.
---
Hmm, seems like a pretty compelling piece of evidence, doesn't it?
---
I think this is a good idea and I'd like to expand upon it a bit. Survival mode currently has leader boards which can be used to try and figure out how many people you might be up against whereas Adventure mode doesn't really have anything similar. 
---
This new player count should be separate from the leader boards and include a tally of all players, including those that are currently sneaking, in stealth, etc., which would permit both Adventure and Survival mode players to know how many people are sharing the server with them at all times. This would be particularly useful to large groups of players working as a team that needs to hop servers, who currently end up waiting in queue without any idea of how long they'll have to wait before getting into the new server. If, say, you have a 12-person team and there are only 2 spots available on the new server, with this new player count, that team would know to try and find another one ASAP instead of waiting around for 10 spots to become free. As it is, such teams have to join new servers and hope for the best.
---
Sadly, it is more readable turned off.
---
Really Nice!!
---
Consider it a blessing, easiest weight you ever lost
---
That’s what I thought

Executioners is nice too because with the sneak boost your target is already below 50% hp
---
people still bitch about tse? its fucking garbage now lmao
---
Yeah I understand that thank you
---
I have not tried yet but I might now.
---
See I have the opposite problem with me being a man and whenever a woman enters our parties they get super aggressive and can't take jokes like they were before. It at this point is a challenge to me to see how far I can push them over while not being too mean
---
-As a game play mechanic and a way to introduce challenge, sure it works.
---
-As realism for a post nuclear blast...  would any of this help?  Doubt it.
---
-Also in terms of realism... could I wear my armor that I apparently wear inside of my clothes ALSO inside of a radiation suit?  Sure, why not.  For that matter... are we really arguing that the magically RadX and RadAway have specific limits that prove someone right and someone wrong?
---
The two things that irk me are:
---
1- Rad suits and Power Armor have hidden stats that you can try and fail to match with other methods... so just be upfront in the label.  Rad protection is X and also bonus rad protection in nuke blast zone (so don't even try to match with armor and buffs).
---
2- Not a big fan of power armor.  It's mostly the visibility thing, the same thing I hated in Bioshock.  So I would love to cruise around in my armor even if I had to chem-out for it.  
---
Still trying to make that work...
---
Thanks! Reply back and I’ll get you that karma

Bye Felicia
---
I hate the bloodbugs and their attack animation where they latch onto you with their legs and spear you with their proboscis.  If a bloodbug and a deathclaw were attacking me simultaneously, I'd kill the damn bloodbug first /shudder.
---
I like the area itself, it's neat. I was disappointed with the quest that goes with it, because it's literally like 3 steps, and the end "boss" wasn't a legendary. 
---
I can't understand how anyone can get lost in there, but I'm really good at mazes, so maybe it's just me. 
---
I LOVE that it's nukeable.
---
Ah makes sense. Sounds cool
---
Thank you very much for this hard work you're putting in. One thing I'd like to note with the Mr handy buzz blade is it doesnt have ability to put the electrified mod on it in the calculations. Cheers!
---
You mean 6-9 months for it to fall off everyone's radar so they can walk away from their commitments with little to no community backlash?
---
I assumed they would do that from the start. I assume every time I spawn in people are waiting to shoot. I was surprised when I wasnt.
---
yea when i do 2 handed i use an instigating swingspeed fire axe and that thing does some work
---
To respond to both /u/Shockwave_IIC and /u/Vissarionn :  
---
I see where I've gone wrong it would seem... I hadn't considered that my main char has Rank 2 of "Bloody Mess" Perk \\\*facepalm\\\*
---
Removing that perk brings his Gauss damage down to 210, same as my second character's.
---
*However*, that doesn't explain the curious instance I had experienced on my second character with it showing 231 if I were to have crafted it. \\\*scratches head\\\*  
---
Given that a legendary Fire Axe I have causes my damage to tank after equipping it, I guess I'll chalk both up to just being a bug... but it's seriously strange that the damage happened to display the exact same as the damage on my main character's Gauss. Wasn't a case of having Bloody Mess on the other character either, as she lacks the card completely *(has Ammo Scrounger Rank 1 and Pharma Farma Rank 2, only ever getting swapped out for Super Duper Rank 3)*.
---
Anyways, thanks! Your (well founded) doubt made me dig deeper and uncover my error! :)
---
Good idea, I'll upload one later today :)
---
I got sexually assaulted and stalked by a female player the other day in-game though. &gt;.&gt; She kept calling me daddy and saying other odd things on voice chat and trying to peek under my loincloth. :o Was kinda funny at first but got really awkward and she eventually left when I tried to give her a "Prayer" note and said she needed Jesus...
---
Yup
---
Given your history with both this game and Reddit as a whole:
---
You have no idea how PvP works, or even care to make a good build for it
---
Your computer is getting old and slow
---
You don’t do any background research on anything
---
And you can’t make good meme edits.
---
I do. I also advertise my club on the front of my house
---
There's a modding problem?
---
I got to experience this last night too! Had so much fun. Then Whitesprings got nuked after. It was great.
---
You was joint 3rd. With god knows how many other players that had zero kills.
---
We seldom come across stability issues that affect one platform and not the others.  The PC version is fine.
---
I'd say, if you can, nuke the burrows.
---
Feed the People event, gave 5 canned stews to everyone in the server. Gives a nice 5% boost and being 5 it kept your hunger and thirst at bay. 
---
I actually liked it, it was original and like me a lot of people thought it was working as intended. I found offensive that they fixed that but NOT the Heart of the Swamp giving corpse stamen to the whole server. They fixed the bug that a lot of people enjoyed but left the bug nobody cared about and was just annoying.
---
My only 'complaints' about the burrows is that it level scales, and one time it was filled with eyebots. As a dungeon for "2 level 50+ players" I dislike going down there and seeing level 22 ghouls.
---
(1) Kudos for you for participating in this trash respec method. It sucks that Badthesda is still not solving this issue.  
---
(2) I would go with the Whitespring method. It seems to be the fastest, imo from what I've leveled so far. Also, the Penitentiary is full of Mutants, so that could also be an option hopping there.  
---
(3) Good luck!
---
As far as I know, they don't respawn inside? I ran a nuked one - and it's more efficient to run West Tek it seems
---
That's a real bummer.  There's three girls on the discord channel that I'm a member of, and they're great, talented players.  Maybe they hang around with us losers because we're not creeps.
---
They have said once or twice in the past that they've been berated or verbally abused when getting on their mic, or having a feminine name or picture.
---
That being said, I'm a straight male and I've been harassed at times just by idiots asking if I can shankwell, can I also fuckwell, suckwell or take dickwell?  I either just ignore or give them a snarky reply, like only for men that don't live with their parents and survive on Hot Pockets.  I guess it's just a part of online gaming.
---
Thank you!! Ive found them☺️☺️
---
Also a male friend of mine played with a female avatar (he has a generic gamertag) and he was amazed at the difference in the way he was treated by alot of other players.
---
It ranged from being followed around having hearts made at him, to a dude basically stalking him and killing him everyone he respawned in...
---
He reckons it was an eye-opening experience!
---
To me this means you could place a single foundation on the edge of a lake and then just build out from there over the water without any issues?
---
Although it will make it easier to build stuff it will also lead to more immersion breaking CAMPS.  My OCD hates that to the point that I have the metal beams holding up my roof in the center because I can't imagine it not needing support...
---
I heard a rumor that Bethesda is going to add reading glasses to atomic shop so people can use them and read those small texts.
---
Whitesprings: You’re fired
---
This is such an ongoing and serious issue and I make no light of the matter at hand, but ma'm, I am literally blowing Dr. Pepper through my nose from laughing so hard after reading the first paragraph of your reply.  I know your reply was not intended for my amusement, but the mental image I get from this falls somewhere between Ron Weasley" Mom chewing him out via the Howler message and The Hulk smashing Loki repeatedly to the floor like a ragdoll.   
---
As for the rest, I really think it's about time the Adults in the room took a more active response towards this sort of harassment.  I appreciate you for doing your part your way.  I have a 10 year old granddaughter who plays online games and I don't ever want her to have to get "used" to this kind of crap or be quiet just because she feels like she has to in order to play some game.  It's bad enough in real life.
---
Yea. It won't be impossible to get a bounty, just harder.
---
Is it? I did not know. Sorry then. Normally when I nuke SBQ and get a group together, the ads and the sbq normally get me a lvl or two.
---
r/iamverysmart
---
Anti-armor effects don't affect the pip-boy damage numbers. For example, a hunting rifle with a perforating magazine does more damage per hit than a lever rifle in practice, but not in the pip-boy.
---
Real damage results are +29% for the anti-armor legendary effect and +17% for the perforating magazine.
---
LOL. Yeah... deciding to go from Melee to VATS Crit/Sniper build is rough. I've been grinding from 107 to 166 to get all the points necessary to move over to the new build. My brain is going to explode from West Tek.
---
So for Whitesprings, server hopping and going inside to kill? Or lead them outside and blow up the car?
---
Good thinking on the Penitentiary too - forgot about the location.
---
How about "Bethesda please" -uniforms?
---
Yeah its way too fun! haha
---
I remember pre-Lv. 50 that the Fire Axe and one of the sledgehammers alternated every 5 levels in terms of upgrades. I always preferred the Fire Axe.  It's cheap to maintain and *seems* to hit a bit faster than the hammers (though I doubt it actually does).
---
I didn't know the gun was loaded and I'm so so sorry my friend.
---
I met up with another player and they had the exact same outfit, face and hairstyle (different color though). Took a pic and now it's a loading screen. It's really cool when something like this happens.
---
I’ll have to keep an eye out...thank you 😁
---
Vats does not work with long shot, from my usage of it.
---
Explosive shotguns sure, go nuts with those, but two-shot ones aren't such a great deal. You only get 1 extra pellet on a two-shot shotgun.
---
So if a regular shotgun fires 5 pellets, a TS one fires 6. That damage boost from TS only applies to that 1 extra pellet. Since it's a shotgun that 1 extra pellet can easily miss, basically turning your Two shot shotgun into a regular one.
---
I don't have any TSE shotguns for sale, just wanted to tell you this bit of info. There are more threads about it made by smarter people than me. My advice would be to avoid spending too much cash on two-shot shotguns. Don't let people scam you. :)
---
There is a difference between your complaint and mine. Mine is legitimate, you actually have a net loss in caps for playing in survival mode - this game is an endless loop of using supplies to kill things then obtaining more gear and supplies to kill things. If i use more resources to kill someone that than I obtain on a consistent basis that is a design flaw in a pvp server. It was advertised as high risk high reward, but now its literally earn an occasional 10 caps it wont pay for the matts repair to your gun or the bullets but meh.
---
You are whining about explosive weapons being op when there is a counter so you are literally just clueless... there is no design flaw here just you having no knowledge of game mechanics. No shame in that just learn and move on, stop hunting and harassing me simply because I told you you were wrong its weird...
---
The extra damage all goes in that pellet
---
There's something really nice about how you can just take 3 points of Iron Fist and be done with Unarmed (unless you're using the Meat Hook).
---
On PS4 the last 15 minutes of Gameplay should be saved. The mic blinks when they talk so they'd be pretty easily identified. Just hit the share button and save the videos when it happens to be able to send with reports.
---
It’s because he’s still white and passive to you, once you’ve both flagged and turn red you will be able to vats him. It even works like this in survival mode stupidly enough.
---
Damn ok Dw
---
Someone sold one for 12k the other day. Ridiculous
---
So it works on Scorchbeasts and the Queen?
---
Democracy is non-negotiable
---
You can still earn atoms in game, there are challenges you can complete...
---
Also: no bloody rocket noise in your ear the whole time you have it out.
---
Absolutely! I have been away from home for a couple of weeks with a family emergency. I would have loved to have picked up some of the atom shop stuff while I was away, before I losty chance forever!
---
I didn't have to unplug but I did have to do a actual "Restart" to get the egg to pop up.
---
Wait, the literal Marine Armor helmet isn't obtainable?
---
If you wanted data mined directly from the files shoot me a private message with what you need. I'll support your work by data mining some values if you need them.
---
What in the Incel hell is this?
---
Maybe it was a 7 year old boy.
---
This has held back my random trades a shit ton!  This is one of the most important and simple fixes imo
---
There are different survival servers for sure
---
This is kinda wholesome.
---
I got an Anti-Armor knuckles
---
I run a high health build, all Vanguard Marine pieces.   That armor combined with the perks and mutations mentioned in this thread get me to 618/560/99 when at full health and all armor repaired to 200%.
---
FRIENDLY BABY PASTEL COLORED DEATHCLAWS!!
---
Hey, I'm glad you admit it is entitlement at least. I don't recall anywhere in any TOS that we were guaranteed a specific amount of atoms per week or we would be subject to compensation. There are other ways to get Atoms in the game, and not all of the challenges are impossible this week...
---
My lifes dream is to be able to wear my actual armor in nuked zone and not be forced into PA or Hazmat suit. Radshield is garbage and does nothing, I still take rapid 14+ rads.
---
How much for the 10mm sub machine gun?
---
It's obtainable through trade on PC since that was the only platform to access the dev rooms
---
WTAF!
---
Please explain....
---
Probably because you're not nearly as funny or clever as you think you are.
---
Absofuckinglutely
---
Ehhh... just let the cat deal with it.
---
Judging from your post history and your horrible, huge titty OC characters, you need some human interaction.
---
You should be fine. Bethesda said it was alright since the plan is learnable and they removed it's damage resistance in the last update like all other headwear.
---
He would probably like that tbh
---
Great idea but change on requirement, instead of 50 purified water its 50 water filters that we normally use to clean water. But we all would love a fountain especially a working one!
---
I'm on PS4!
---
Two ferals share an adventure. Nice
---
So hyped!
---
Synths confirmed.
---
Ye survival is only one server with 5lowbies xping around and 6 sent/assasin guys at whitesprings.
---
Atleast on adventure there is more than 30 players haha
---
Depends on your level, the weapon level, mods, and your perks.
---
I've noticed as I've leveled up, damage seems to increase a bit.
---
Overall effectiveness also depends on the type and number of enemies you are dealing with.
---
I'm L63, 1h melee build, 15 Str, 3 incisor, 3 marital art, 1 gladiator, 1 anti-tank.  
---
For the 2h weapons I've toyed with:
---
IDK damage on the sledge - too heavy (and slow) for my liking, especially fighing a mob/horde.
---
A plain L40ish Fireaxe does 114.  Dont have the mod for the spiked version.
---
L10 instigating fire axe does 70, with 2x damage on 100% health enemies   
---
and increases above base with each sucessive hit.  Dont have the mod for the spiked version.
---
L50 Grognak axe with 50% AP does 180 and change.
---
...I remember the baseball bat with spikes and a jetpack is quite respectable, but I don't have the build perk for the mod.
---
Seems stupid that Bethesda added the challenges without adding the camera. It just takes away from our daily and weekly challenges.
---
I wouldn't spend 12k on any weapon... Especially now when the legendary vendor comes in 1 month...
---
If you want to use shotguns try to make a build for them. I'm a rifle user, i rarely use shotguns, can't help that much but i did notice they're only efficient if you're basically hugging the enemy while shooting it. Doing this with an explosive shotgun isn't very fun either... I only like an instigating combat shotgun. Close range one-shots pretty much anything that's lightly armored.

I've been writing games for probably longer than you've been alive. Keep making those assumptions though. First it was I didn't know how the game works, then it was "oh you only made skins or meshes with creation kit." Then it was "you've only made games in rpg maker."
---
Face it, you've been wrong every time you've opened your mouth. Just go sit down and stop making yourself look like an idiot.
---
that just adds to the “weird” factor of this post.
---
good grief...
---
Im in the same boat too since they patched it I haven't moved from my location.
---
It even looks like absolute shit in the atom shop. Especially against the wood background. It’s terrible.
---
yeah, and kick some cans and poke dead things with sticks!
---
I've used shotguns predominantly in Fallout 76 and I find them to be very effective. If you are looking to take out enemies from a safe distance, shotguns are not your weapon for that and you need to be investing in rifle weapons and perks. I do recommend the long barrel on shotguns because the extra range is really fun, however you lose total damage the farther away you are from the enemy you're shooting. In order to get the full effect from your shotguns you have to devote a lot of perk points to it: 12 for strength, 6 perception, and 3 Agility. This will get you 9 shotgunner perk points for max damage, the scattershot perk for faster reload and reduced carry weight, skeet shooter for better spread and accuracy, and the enforcer card for stagger, 30% chance to cripple and limb damage. My team has told me that when I am not around during a Scorchbeast Queen fight, my enforcer perk is sorely missed because it cripples the Queen and keeps her landed on the ground. With all of my perks, my bloodied double barrel shotgun does over 500 damage per shot, and the 2nd shot is usually a split second after the first.
---
Not gunna bother reading. Trigger acquired.
---
I don't recommend looking.
---
The event blrub just says you have to collect all 6, nothing about placing them. Assume something will be made clear/secret event after all 6 out.
---
Throw them like grenades.  Yeah, I could get behind that. XD
---
It'll probably just give the Easter Bunny suit sitting in the data files.

They are ironic; Alanis just doesn't give enough context. 😗

I miss the old days of fallout where you could steal from people.. like oh shit sorry, I can't believe you felt me pull that shotgun out of your pocket sir, now everything is hostile..  Also miss the karma aspect, so if you were generally a dick you would have negative karma and impacted accordingly
---
Funny, my old chemistry professor always said "if you're not part of the solution, you're part of the precipitate."
---
The fact you can walk 20feet and not find ammo in any direction America is what ruins the immersion for me. I walk into any spot down here in Texas I expect multiple guns and tons of ammo.
---
I like "All Rise" for 2H melee. With 15 Str and max 2H perks I'm hitting right at 315 dmg per swing. Best part is it only weighs 4.
---
Including myself. Countless times I've killed myself with my own weapon
---
This is what me and my crew does. If we see somebody in a silo for a long time we'll go in and help them out to get the nuke launched.
---
Still a better love story that Twilight?
---
Entirely new meaning to the term 'hail mary'
---
as a fellow girl who plays 76 (on pc tho) i get disgusting comments all the time too, but you just have to ignore them. i only go on mic when i know i can trust someone to not be a jerk n stuff lol
---
Coastal guard in a pretty remote place with almost no usable Internet. Text stuff is fine though
---
Because you know you are wrong
---
Report them to Beth or just use Squad Audio
---
1. New quests including a new endgame boss.
---
2. Lots of small bug fixes.
---
3. New crafting in the form of brewing.
---
4. Lots of new gear/weapon skins and new furniture / accessories for your CAMP.
---
5. Weapon balancing of two shot / explosive weapons.
---
Basically the game has a bit more content with some decent balancing of weapons / PERKS.
---
I want Unstoppable Monster... I'm terrified to even try claiming a workshop to get it.the other requirements are easy as Sunday morning but that one...
---
I see it going like:
---
&gt;Be me
---
&gt;Be awful at PvP
---
&gt;Travel to Charleston Station
---
&gt;Get mowed down
---
&gt;Finally escape
---
&gt;Only to get mowed as I try to claim Poseidon
---
Oof to the oofth degree
---
But I will prevail
---
Amen to that.
---
Fortunately, that wasn't always the case for me.  I'm not sure if it's PC-specific, but there are some rocket sledgehammer mods that don't make noise (or animate, for that matter).
---
But the Super Sledge? Yeah, that's annoying.
---
Hope so. While great for those of us with minor foundational issues … there are those that will clearly build concrete foundations out over space … not unlike those huge CAMPS with 1 foundation piece and floating save a since staircase. It's dumb.
---
Im solo but dont mind carry someone if asking...
---
Pc tho
---
Silence is consent. No one should accept it from any players even if they're not the target.
---
I use excavator because as soon i put on a hazmat suit im over encumbered. Excavator at least still increases my carry weight. I take off unarmed perk and put on 2h, take off nerd rage put on power user or first aid.
---
Don't miss your own gatekeeping, though, that's not helpful. People play games the way they want to, there's no qualifications, exams or certifications involved.  
---
"  true gamers (and not attention seeking twitch streamers) "

Mr. Handy Buzz Blade
---
Try a different game again but leave the controller alone for a bit. There may be junk inside the housing or it may be time for a new one. How old is it?
---
Heh, that's why i get on same server every time i server hop on survival? Yeah there can be 100 - 1k players on adventure, but survival is only one server death. Atleast on PS4. And don't get me wrong i love this game. Maybe i am kinda disapointed how bethesda fucked up every patch, but still this is my favorite RPG game.
---
It is out for 6months even old GTA V got so much new content in time bethesda needed to add 5minute dungeon. Of course people are leaving, there is nothing to do when you finish 500hours. Which is huge number, so yeah this game is blast, but it will die.
---
Yeah, that seems like the hardest criteria but at the same time the rewards makes it worth it. Others are a bot of a gimmie
---
worst part for me was the racist sexist shit he posted in r/offensivememes (or r/offensivejokes? I don’t wanna go back and see.) i get that the whole point is 2009 4chan humour but it really just grossed me out when compared to the rest of his stuff
---
hehe this is how I envision that scene going down https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcXIZFNAElg
---
Agree I want more camp budget, personally I hope they toss out current plans for stash box and make it so you can only hold 30 unique items but those 30 items can be as many as you want like 200k steel and such.
---
If you make a "god" build in fallout and expect a challenge, you're gonna have a bad time.  Becoming stupidly OP is not intended to be the goal for most people. If you're rocking full sentinel gear and a TSE, you're just ruining the challenge for yourself. 
---
Imagine if the first dungeon raid were impossible for the average player. Nobody would want to play the next one.
---
I regret buying it honestly, and would refund it if I could. The color blends into a lot of things (especially brick walls), it's missing bulbs which wouldn't really show the letters well either way since the outline still stays barely visible. Far away it's impossible to read, close up it's barely readable.
---
Not terribly. Some people would voice during fasnacht, but not enough, sometimes.
---
That’s amazing
---
I don’t have any problem with people who seek attention through twitch streaming. Never said I did. I simply qualified my statement about my female gaming friends, as all of them seem to not want to be lumped in with the twitch streaming crowd.
---
Salt of the Earth is actually interesting, aside from having to be in melee range to utilize effectively.  Accuracy 0 is NOT GOOD.  That's going to be a PvE only piece that need blocker perk and a few sentinel armor pieces to go along with it.  Commander's Charge looks decent, if one handed melee was better.  I guess Resolute Veteran would be cool for the guy in T-51b that wants to tank bosses with a heavy gun.  Does the suppressors effect "recharge" to allow an automatic weapon to keep a boss at a consistent -20% damage rate?
---
Burrows was disappointing when I went there in a nuked zone. Almost nothing spawned. There were no other players there, either, and we could find *maybe* one or two glowing ones by themselves at most. Go back up top, almost no spawns anywhere, and then (randomly) they all ended up invulnerable.
---
Or, more appropriately:
---
**#What in the goddam!?**
---
That doesn't sound like much
---
Well mods are broken. That’s new 🤷‍♂️
---
So far, yes, just two. Seems to change around 8-9, CST (my time zone)
---
Maybe make it a PvP event near the super bowl?!? Make up team names like ‘Morgantown Marauders’, ‘Watoga Warriors’and ‘Grafton Ghouls’
---
Skeet shooter helps with if you can afford to slit it
---
Tesla rifles are interesting stuff and are good against horde events
---
I have 8 so far.
---
Shop resets at 5pm pst. Thats when #3 will be available.
---
I was running past the Steakhouse at the Bog/Mire transition one time when I started rapidly losing health. After what seemed like an eternity of waiting, trying to escape and popping stims, I finally get to see the group of five Mirelurk Kings that were wailing on me. Then they chased me into a super mutant spawn. Bad times.
---
Right
---
Two. They come our each night around 8 pm eastern
---
Can you PM me this?
---
Yep. OP is a typical cheeto-finger incel neckbeard type. There's a huge difference in being a geek and this.
---
Or, I dunno, no all broken glass walls? We can build a Tesla from scratch but can't manage walls or doors without broken windows?
---
Don't mean to burst your bubble but armor that adds endurance doesn't actually increase your HP.
---
It's a brand new Xbox One Controller from Microsoft, bought over the December holiday. I've unplugged it and restarted, played a different game -- Devil May Cry 5 -- and no problems at all.
---
The ones no one has discovered with their lvl 50-70 twink PvP characters.
---
Aaahhh, Benny. Badabing, Chandler Bing!
---
yes. I really need another white wolf cap, you're right! -tosses it on stack of others-
---
Hmm. I'll definitely have to start paying attention now. You've got me curious. Only thing I'll ask is do you actually learn something about the crows in the game? Is there like a quest related to them, and if so do you remember where to start it?
---
Well I tried. Unfortunately you're one of those modders that give nexus a bad name in that you're so full of yourself you think you're better at game development than actual game developers.
---
Did you mean to put this in your diary?
---
Justice upvote for ya
---
Same. I've had my camp there for months, and now I have to move it. The repair costs, especially with the decontamination shower, were huge.
---
1. Never claimed and i do and wanted too
---
2. Yes but still doesnt excuse why this game is running like shit now when i could play it without problems at launch
---
3. I just jumped into survival not expecting to die before my loading screen finished and what is wrong with asking questions?
---
4. That doesnt even matter
---
If the gun is scoped it does not work also. Iron sight Reflex sights or glow sights only.
---
/u/wateverr4ever
---
That with the aid is my fault but i couldnt even fight off that guys cause i died befor loading in properly
---
My point is that level 50 dungeons should be end-game. This wasn't a "end game" experience.  It should have been. 
---
I'm honestly 100% sure you just don't have a clue what I'm actually saying, because you seem to be pointing out the exact same shit I am.
---
Uh oh someone got a crush, just take it slow bro.
---
I started a new character in survival, all worried that the big meanies would make me their toy. Exited the vault, scurried down to the Overseer's camp doing my best not to be seen...then I noticed a "6" next to my name. As in, I had the 6th highest kill count on the server. WTF? Then the number 1 killed 2 and 3 in short succession and they ragequit. My number turned to a 4.
---
Relaxed a bit at that point secure that I could see every damned player on the server.
---
Guess your right
---
Perks allow you to walk around nuke zones without PA or hazmat suits. If your party shares the following perks with each other, you'll constantly heal each other's rads and immediately gain HP while taking more rads. Throwing team medic if you have fewer team mates for emergency heals, if needed. 
---
**Ghoulish**: Radiation now regenerates even more of your lost Health! 
---
**Rad Sponge**: When affected by rads, you periodically heal 200 rads on nearby teammates.
---
Hoping they give us a new currency that we can use buy legendary mods.
---
Rufuses bring people together!
---
Because you weren't heaping nothing but praise on this "wonderful well polished and not at all buggy game."
---
You don't like the 20 pound launcher that can only launch your nuclear warhead across the street?
---
I can't upvote this enough for visibility.  It is by far the most disappointing atomic shop purchase I have made to date.  Hopefully they increase the lighting on it or refunds will be asked for!
---
Scorch killer receiver on guns does it too but they aren't better than hardened
---
So buy some fucking ammo. That's a cap sink. Buy mats. Buy repair shit. Those standard MMO cap sinks are already in the game, we just don't use them because most people don't _need_ them. 
---
I don't have a _clue_ what Fonline is, and I don't give a shit about what _random fucking MMOs_ do?  
---
I could be praising neverwinters system every time I come in here, but I don't.  Because...this isn't that. 
---
This _isn't a fucking MMO_.
---
Honestly it’s irrelevant how much, because regardless, you just shouldn’t ever take that much aid in survival. It is not needed, the only thing you truly need is water and a couple stimpacks. I would also recommend having the carnivore mutation for easier food.
---
At the very minimum, take off traveling pharmacy and thru/hiker and stash all your aid until you are underencumbered, then you will be close to having the amount of aid you should carry, but the less you carry the better, because then they get less.
---
I carry around typically 5 purified water, 2-3 stims, 2-3 rad x diluted and rad away diluted, and a bunch of meat I get off npcs, and that’s it.
---
Yes, as if the base damage is not a whole number, or if at some point, there is a truncation happening in the game and thus one gets a lower number than rounding would suggest.
---
Also it seems the explosive modifier adds 20% to the modded damage, not the unmodded damage as I've led to believe recently.
---
For example. Gatling Gun: 86 base, Prime: 107.5, Explosive ingame: 128, Explosive prime my: 124.7. 107.5 * 1.2 = 129 but 107 * 1.2 = 128.4
---
Not in pacifist mode.
---
If that's your biggest mistake ever, you're doing pretty well at life.  Congrats!
---
  I played the same way as you - casual player, came into the game with no preconceptions (or knowledge) of specialty builds - I selected cards that   
---
 benefited me at the time.
---
  That led me to be a 1h melee build, with a couple extra perk points given to  sniper and auotmatics.  Usually play solo, so didnt worry too much about charisma, either.  
---
I'm L63 now, and have not felt the need to move points to a different category.  Its only been within the last 10 levels I've started swapping out   
---
cards when I'm crafting.
---
There was bug, when you spam crouch in nuke zone you stoped geting rads with it glitching. Idk if they fixed it.
---
To be fair, if you're THIS FAR in the game, and you don't know about how loot changes levels to accommodate to lower levels as well as high levels,
---
It was called for
---
Its a glorified slingshot. Just let me tom brady this bitch
---
lawl
---
I'm with you on this, it won't go away if not confronted. I'm old school, literally and figuratively,  (53), and I just dont understand where/why these folks get their disrespect.  Not only would my mother have washed my mouth out with soap but my father would have decked me. Between that upbringing and my time in the military, I just dont have much tolerance for bullying or plain, crude behavior.
---
I refuse to believe that it's a "gamer" thing, I've been a gamer for as long as there have been gaming. Rather it seems to be a general malaise associated with the anonymity of the internet and a general lack of character.  Sorry, dont mean to ramble,  but this kind of thing really pisses me off! 
---
Bottom line, stand your ground! Running from it won't help in the long run...nor will it help the next person to have to deal with this scum.
---
Hahahhahahahahahhaahah
---
Yes, I included only the ballistic damage mods as I don't know yet how to include electric damage, or energy damage as a matter of fact.
---
It does have a pejorative connotation that is sexist and is a stereotype generally associated with women who game, that's all I'm trying to remind you about here. That's a large part of why there are so very women in esports, right? 45% of gamers are women. The number in the professional leagues don't reflect that \*at all\*.
---
The new content isn’t that bad, albeit less time consuming to reach the given goal(s). As long as you’re open minded to the still present game freezes / server crashes / and latest glitches introduced by the most recent patch. Modding and repair of items still effected, which is rather inconvenient. No impressive loot drops, which hasn’t changed.  The market to obtain items to make the game enjoyable is a rolling sea of inflation, where the masses do not possess the caps to purchase better armor / weapons. This along with little hope of obtaining competitive pieces to venture into PCP land makes the play mundane. Grind for a week and get 1* wood. Other than that, yeah, same old same old. If it not for the ransom positive online interaction with players, I’d have made room on the hard drive.
---
Your right stick may be slightly sticky. Some games have a dead zone system for gamepads, which is why you don't see in in DMC5 but Fallout 76 does not, so a bery small input may cause your camera to drift slowly. Happens on my old XBOX360 controller as well (although it's almost 4 years old now). Try flicking the RS upwards slightly and see if the drifting stops. Also, update your gamepad drivers.
---
Any more patterns like using a certain gun or doing something in particular?
---
I really really like the pink paint.  Nothing says badass like stomping around in hot pink, no one takes you seriously, and then you absolutely destroy everything.  It's the best hot rod paint, because only the guys that know they're got the stuff would be seen behind the wheel of a bright pink hot rod with a serious power plant under the hood.
---
I don't know why but i think you need help
---
Wait. That's illegal.
---
Even it costs flux to craft it, I really want it.
---
You are a Disney princess now
---
I don't know the bloodied factors exactly so currently it calculates as 1% health is 59% damage boost. I'll try to find a bloodied weapon and measure it.
---
i have to commend you playing that long at 30fps
---
Hm, seems to work just fine for me...do you have a screenshot? Maybe it's glitching through a wall where you placed it.
---
I think you might be thinking of the Brotherhood fatigues. There's nothing in the game with the name Enclave fatigues but maybe they have a different name. Your description matches the BoS ones pretty well though.
---
http://fallout.wikia.com/wiki/Brotherhood_fatigues_(Fallout_76)
---
Do you love exploring the open world of fallout 4? Do you enjoy the art design for the art design? Then  you'll probably get a kick out of exploring 76.
---
I wonder if players could trade these tokens with each other, for caps or other items
---
Make a new character do all but the "kill a humanoid" then switch over to main character kill a scorched with your main in survival and then go back to normal. Then you get it without having to do PvP with your main. Can make a naked level 1 run up to Tyler county fairground and claim it. Boom done without having to be on survival for more than 15 minutes.
---
Ha! That’s my line, too. We have to put them to sleep. Good night, zombies!
---
Or maybe I’m not a young punk like you and you should respect your elders you don’t know who you’re talking to
---
Mods aren’t even inherently bannable
---
Dude, I already told you I’m not discriminating against anyone. I can understand how you would think that after initially reading my first comment, but after I clarified why I said what I said, there really isn’t a need for further discussion here. People can game how they want to game. I don’t care.
---
What a casual, didn't even adjust for program interference
---
Are Disney Princesses supposed to have these weird crystals growing out of their skin?
---
only found out about them today and missed the first egg :(
---
Ohhh okay, well maybe I won't totally shy away from it next time, thanks!
---
Am I the only person who reads this and is thankful I don't have a vagina, because of creeps like you?
---
Sayings like this made conversations with my dad difficult LOL. “Hey If i...” Hay is for horses son.” Ok.. well I might...” “mites live on a chickens ass son””...”
---
Who the hell goes out of their way to pick at female gamers? I am a man and maybe I just haven't been around the ass hats that do this, but what is the point of being mean to someone because of their gender? If a girl is playing this game on your team or in the same area as me why would go out of your way to make her or anyone for that matter feel unwelcome. It makes absolutely no sense to me why people do rude shit in video games.
---
O usas XB1?
---
 Love this idea, would actually give me a reason to pick up those 3lb nukes
---
Bird nested outside my front door on a beam in RL.  I walked out fast one day and I swear it felt like being attacked by one of these.  Had to run for my truck to avoid using too many stims.
---
Thats alot of pre war money to save it it 1-1 ration or is a stack 10, 50, 100?.....i want my cram.
---
I’m a dude that plays on ps4 with many different people of different genders and orientations, I’ve never seen anyone act inappropriate or in a harassing manner, but I would imagine that blocking people from the ps4 profile, then in game would do the trick. 
---
Also I recommend using the ps4 party chat to keep your team chat from spilling into the game
---
Be the bigger person man and just walk it off
---
Best advice: pay attention. If you pay attention to play styles, demeanor, the way the people talk, etc. and use your mic, you’ll come to be able to tell who is going to be a douche and who is not, before you ever even open your mouth.
---
In general, the more generous a player is, how much they are willing to help weaker players, how opposed to cheating the player is, etc. are pretty good indicators that the person won’t be a douche.
---
It's a new reboot, it's all fine.
---
Source? I have a furious lmg and an anti armor lmg and need some damn information lol
---
...oh. A arm mod which allows them to be used like grenades.
---
Yes. I have learned 4 of them
---
Yeah that's one problem that needs to be tackled, its said there a "invulnerability time" but I think it's too short or ineffective. Plus also people camp at train stations and take advantage of that and as they're one of the only places you can fast travel, so watch out for that!
---
Talos be praised
---
Honestly, I have to keep my Mic off on any game I play, im a gay, male, that kinda sounds like Bentley, I wanna play this, siege, even overwatch, but everyone on the Mic seems to be homophobic, or just naturally is a cunt, I only ACTUALLY 1 person I play with that is my friend, alast, playstaion games hate me.
---
Crazy idea here I know, why don't you try it out for yourself? Odds are people on a subreddit devoted to a certain game will say to play it.
---
I would love it! I know its going to be exploited where they either hide the box for 100lbs or delete it after storing items in it but I know most players would use it to help other players.
---
Fallout 76 and Overwatch are the two games I play the crap out of and I’ve experienced really gross harrassment and such on both games. They both have in-game chat and indicate when people are speaking. I don’t always want to hear the bullshit they spew though, so as soon as I get on, I make myself a private party. If I really wanna know what they’re saying, I’ll switch to in-game for a hot second and then switch back to party chat. Its almost never worth giving them the attention they desperately want. If they don’t let it up though, I’ll go AFK with my character doing the radiation/throwing up emote and then get some water or snacks. Then I’ll just server hop. I’ve also changed my psn settings such that only friends can send me messages. I think I responded to your post on the bazaar, but I just wanted to show more support. Play away with your sis and to hell with nasty people!
---
Thanks for your reply uncle Rick. After being forced to sign into the game again, i.e. having to put in your credentials manually at the menu screen, (not sure what would cause that?), the game seems to be fine now.   
---
I suppose if someone else experiences the issue, it'll sort itself out eventually @\_@
---
Hail sithis
---
Trust in Brady's balls.
---
6lb with no weight redux...
---
Whitespring hasn't been re-stocking for me at all lately. If I show up and run the nuke zone, 99% of the time there's flat out _nothing alive_ at all.
---
In glasses a few months back and some dude in PA comes sprinting back by me with two kings on his 6.  I was lower level but dove in to help...we survived...just.
---
Now they are no problem...but ya...pretty scary
---
Lol why on carry it to enemy like a sucider super mutant.
---
I just got a furious gatlin' gun last night and can't wait to try it out. Can someone explain the problem with the sight?
---
Ok this is downright inexplicable shit even by Bethesda standards.
---
Also please don't call me uncle I'm just 23.
---
Yeah, the game play is a lot better than when it first launched. It still has some weird bugs, but for the most part it's fun game.
---
 I'm 72, talk to me puppy. ;) 
---
 Really if you have not figured out level scaling by now you are not paying attention.
---
I would love a auto doc for my camp.
---
Exactly, like you can cook a grenade.
---
1) That explains why you died
---
2) Yea, it really does buddy. Old hardware and old systems slow down, and they run heavy things like a video game worse.
---
3) You can ask questions, but you’re asking stupid questions as you were being ignorant by not checking facts before jumping in. You’re creating angry posts about problems you caused
---
4) Your memes show a lot about your personality and tendencies, and that meme edit was rushed, and reveals a lack of care, and a tendency to be ignorant, which this post, and your comments reek of as well.
---
The issue isn't "hey, the burrows sucks" it doesn't, it's neat. The issue is \_how it was hyped\_. We were promised something we didn't get.   
---
We got something that should have been a casual aside. "Oh, you might want to check out man-hole covers in HF, we've added a little side bonus".   
---
We were promised a fucking end-game raid dungeon.
---
I love turning on the cannibal perk if I’m repeatedly farming them as well haha &gt;:) The ultimate BM
---
Yeah about 1200 atoms seems fair
---
I’m a woman and I just don’t ever play with anyone, and if I do I don’t use a mic. Those have been my best experiences, honestly, just communicating through emotes. I don’t use a mic because I am easily annoyed and prefer to be a lone wanderer most of the time. Also, I scavenge, wander, and build and I suck at fighting so no one ever wants to play with me anyway. I’m a loner, Dottie. A rebel.
---
My comment karma is higher, so I'm winning daaaawg!
---
Capture and defend workshops. It's not a huge amount of xp,but it's steady and you get free plans.
---
It would give the reward to the alt right?
---
I personally cannot ever recommend a bethesda game on console.
---
It does by a few points, I forgot how many points you get per endurance.
---
That is exactly how i died at a train station
---
I'm fine with around the same stash space. But I want the option to send stuff to other characters of mine. Then I can just make a bank alt. Give us a mailbox that stores a small amount of stuff that can be withdrwn from on all characters.
---
Sharks With frickin lasers attached to their frickin heads! But seriously laser turrets.
---
Oof, it took a me a while to figure out what was taking up all my stash and inventory, when I found out you couldn’t sell them I just dumped them in the river
---
That’s pretty much their value
---
I agree that, even though it makes sense that a freshly nuked spot require external protection, that the Fallout Universe should have extra radiation protection. But it's not as hard to deal with nuked zones as people make it out to be. There's only 2 common scenarios that you would wander into a nuke zone (save for when people nuke random spots). Ghoul Grinding (WS or Harpers) or SBQ. Both are pretty easy to manage without a rad suit or power armor. Unless you're in a place with things like Super Mutants you can perk up and survive pretty easily.
---
For Whitespring, the ghouls do mostly Radiation damage, so having a rad suit on and popping a diluted rad-x drops the damage they do a ton. Adding blocker on top of that makes them a very low threat. If you have a few extra points in endurance to spare adding Ghoulish helps a ton as well. The only thing to watch out for is the Level 91 Deathclaw that sometimes spawns.
---
For the SQB, Blocker and Fireproof make the battle a ton easier. Blocker help mitigate damage from adds and max Fireproof makes the sonic scream do no damage. If the group fighting the SQB hasn't kited her just out of the radiation zone, they're doing it wrong anyway, most SQB fights now days take place at the bunker just outside of the rad zone, at least is my experience.
---
I know it sounds crappy to have to use perks to survive, but that's how non-PA builds work. You can end up more defensible than a lot of PA builds but it's a bit more difficult to manage. The trade off is it's more versatile, has extra perks/mutations, and costs less to maintain in the long run.
---
On a side note, having Ghoulish and Fireproof lets you refill your health by standing on cars and blowing them up, so it's a good combo in and of itself.
---
Someone like you would be lucky to get maybe 4-500 hours out of the game, hardly worth it for free ^^/s
---
I'm not a big Skyrim fan (need to get that going again some time), but I loved me the hell out of Fallout 4 and even the older ones.  If you love just exploring and catching all the sights, you'll be in for a treat.  I'm in a little over 300 hours (and I started late!), and it's still my go-to game currently.
---
The story isn't as deep as 4, and it's told differently (though recordings and notes), but it's good.  I don't know that it will have the replayability of 4 either, but honsetly I'm not even at the point of wanting to start fresh yet.
---
It IS a Bethesda game, with all the quirks and bugs one would expect.  That can either be a plus or a minus, depending on how much you like to see super mutants getting launched into orbit from a pipe gun hit.
---
You just answered your own point. It matters not what I say about a fictional humanity, help them or kill them, "they" won't care because "they" don't exist. But, if they were real living people in a nuclear wasteland, and I was underground, with everything I needed to survive comfortably, screwv them, let them die, not my concern.
---
Its decidely different than FO4, but its still fallout.
---
Yes, it has its quirks, but so did every other version of fallout.
---
Ultimately, the only way to know if you are going to like it is play it and judge for yourself.
---
I saw all the negative, hesitated.  Almost returned it.  
---
Decided to installed and play.  
---
I'm glad I did - 300 hours so far, and stil having a good time.
---
Oh yeah, or find a trading subreddit and one guy was offering 15 caps, each (not bad but better than nothing)
---
Back when i was student and PC player i had to play WOW on pc with 433mhz procesor. I was used to play with 15fps haha. Playstation for the win!
---
Love how you're getting downvoted for calling out using nukacrypt as cheating. Oh the irony.
---
I think part of the problem is nerd rage additional 20% (which I compensated for with damage boost) and adrenal reaction which I’m not sure what the boost is but my be combat shotgun does 800+ irl and it said like 336. 
---
But again it’s a great tool! I’m just trying to give feedback not criticize
---
No, everything is fine on my end, its fallout, not me
---
i tested the lever and the hunting rifle with anti armor + perforating magazine. The lever did 20% more damage than my hunting rifle. hunting rifle had 211 dmg, lever 240-260 dmg.
---
I have the ame problem. Got the first 2 eggs from the shop, but I can't find them. I took a look under the deathclaw statue, and there is the bunny, but no eggs...
---
I got one like that. Someone gave me two and when I scrapped it I got the plan for it. So...I can make it now. I won't, but I can.
---
Could easily be done if they make it equip able like grenades are, if they do then we would have some actual use for them.
---
What fucking meme edit
---
I dunno on that (scorch killer receivers don't work on on them for sure, so it may be the same case here just a legendary effect or not), but definitely on "Scorched" or enemies that are titled "Scorched \[type of enemy\]", so like a Scorched Deathclaw or Scorched Fog Crawler.
---
I mean there's no harm trying them on Scorchbeasts and SBQ, they may or may not do more damage.
---
Radshield and photomode.
---
My setup when I do hit level 50 to use it should be Death Tambo, Lever Action, and the Railway Rifle I got.
---
Also, if someone is genuinely harassing you, one phrase works better than anything else: “you’re pathetic.” Doesn’t matter what they say back, just keep reiterating it. Hits too close to home for internet bullies. Like taking away their anonymity.
---
Well, I would've gone with 'Grandpa Rick' but that would've been too inappropriate, even if by the show, Rick and Morty, it would've been the correct terminology :)
---
That’s great! PC version it is.
---
So would multiple players be able to buy the same weapon/armor on a single server? They would then become duplicates. Otherwise, if they operate on a first come first serve basis, the really good ones would be bought in a heartbeat, and deny other players a chance.
---
mines right under vault 76 near the lake/lumber mill
---
No SB has attacked my camp but whenever I am in camp, I usually get attacked by radrats who goes for my cow that I have named MooMoo. My fertilizer cart 100% of time after I get back to camp is destroyed but easily repaired.
---
Thank you for this. It eases my mind a little. I didn't know about the continuing 5 card packs or moving SPECIAL points. That's really good to know.
---
I must sound like a dude bc I've never been harassed by anyone and I stay on mic the whole time.
---
How about as a mid-close range weapon, like a backup plan?
---
The sights don't line up at all. https://i.imgur.com/6rD3gDR.jpg
---
Plans for PA probably the best I've gotten.
---
I was most stoked to finally get a dragon via treasure maps though.
---
My first thought was that if anything it should’ve run better... But anecdotal evidence made me post the question. Thank you though!
---
What is this jump on the bandwagon? You boys 
---
 don’t have a life
---
Test it. In pacifist your turrets will still shoot wanted players and deal damage.
---
Depends on your play style and internet connection. Depends on what you get in the way of legendary affects.   
---
My best weapon I've had to date was a bloody 1\* sledge hammer (non super sledge) with the top tier mod on it. Thing was a godamn beast. And then it got eaten by a game bug.   
---
I have a 1\* grognak bloodied. And it, base damage, does crazy damage. But my 2\* pick axe with the sharp mod and bloodied+power attack damage knocks it out of the water for max damage.   
---
I have a vampires mr-handy buzz blade which fucking OWNS everything else I have, when I'm playing on a decent internet connection with low latency.  On a high latency connection, the thing is \_garbage\_.
---
I don't usually see people near my camp, except for this guy. I couldn't have my camp placed only 3 times since launch. Although with Encryptid going on, people may become more interested in settling in that area now. At least I can hop onto the Encryptid event whenever there is one and leech off some rewards!
---
I use an anti armor deathclaw gauntlet for close encounters
---
Read the new in the vault article they posted.
---
Next month, if you and your turrets are not hostile to the other players, that player will not be able to damage anything in your camp.
---
Already on its way.
---
This may be a dumb question, so please forgive me, but why list pre-nerf? 
---
I still run a TSE shotgun build that I put together before the TSE nerf and was under the impression the TSE nerf was retroactive, is that not the case or are you trying to make me cry at the huge damage decrease between pre and post TSE nerf? Ha-ha! 
---
Thanks for putting this together; very useful.
---
This eases my mind a lot, thank you. My weapon usage is fairly general, mostly pistol for now since I found a really good one that punches through armor, but i know that probably won't last at higher levels. I'm thinking of going more into rifles, as I'm starting to get outclassed with higher level mobs.
---
I play solo as well for the most part, pretty much playing it as a single player game with other people around, although I'm not opposed to grouping at times. It's just not my regular play style.
---
It sounds like the choices I make will be recoverable later if they turn out to be "wrong" for my build choice.
---
The server was downloading Windows XP updates.
---
I have a Death Tambo right now, are guantlet weapons good or should I try to swap to a 1 handed?
---
on some servers near the lumber mill, every fifty feet there is a settlement
---
Fantastic...finally! Ty sorry for sharing article.
---
Anyone that targets and disrespects women in a game is probably overcompensating for their lack of appeal in the real world. Put them in their place and squish them like a bug under your heels.
---
Anyway I must be doing something right 175 compared to 72??? Ha ha. And I guarantee you I’m twice your age
---
Nope. Most builds want high+str, which you got for those melee cards .Also melee builds are still pretty much the most powerful thing going in the game, with the right legendary weapons.   
---
You want a minimum of 5 int to manufacture mods for your weapons.   
---
Stackable picklock isn't a thing, sadly....  
---
In general, I would say you're in decent shape, but you might have to swap some perks around later.
---
Well it’s just like looting from ghouls anyways, the first guy who saw a three star glowing one won’t sit there all day long so everyone’s grandma can come and ‘tag’ it to get a share. It’s all RNG so it’s fair.
---
"  Once this is implemented, only the first foundation piece you place will need to be built on terrain, all subsequent foundations you snap to that original piece will then ignore this rule. "  
---
And thus began the era of the one foundation on terrain cliff house epidemic
---
Ah, ok. Thank you.
---
I got a lv 50 anti armor dcg with 40% faster swing which does 300dmg.
---
Also got a lv 45 anti armor tambo which does 227dmg
---
I guess the increased speed perk for dcg gives it the edge on the tambo
---
Perhaps I am. Just an old maintenance dude. Not surprised I dont know hehe
---
Found an Anti Armor Tesla earlier, it pays to poke things with sticks
---
 That you would ask that question speaks to a deep confusion. 
---
 I have friends who use consoles, and the various games that run on both consoles and PC I have been able to compare in game-play quite well. Fallout 4 for instance. 
---
 My play is nothing like theirs. They are cripples lurching about the place and I wonder how they stand it. I am agility and precision and my fights are just so much fun. Headshots ... I pick an eye.
---
 Now they are pretty good at consoles but recognize their limitations and mostly have switched to PC for fighting games anyway.
---
 My PC is very stable, runs the game very well and its 8 years old and soon to be replaced. ;)
---
Fine with the stash and camp space.
---
Until three scorchbeast come to raid ya. The camp should not too big.
---
Do you have multiple weapons of the same type? Because that’s what broke, and still sometimes breaks after the patch.
---
So basically the foundations will all snap together without ever getting the "floating piece" message. Because it is assumed that the first foundation is placed on terrain in order to have one to snap to initially.
---
Two shots, explosive, and faster fire rate weapons do break faster than normal from my experience.  Combine any of those and it's even faster.  I have a tse laser weapon with a beam splitter and that thing breaks at around 60 shots when it's 200%
---
In general though, are fist weapons better than one-handed?
---
In the roadmap, the most vague part of the map is the final column, which looks to arrive sometime in tall. There's an emblem on it that has a vault boy, standing next to a sentry bot.
---
Along with "that machine" we see in the sheepsquatch quests, the hint is stronger than ever.
---
Yeah, I’m the same way with mic off I rarely wear a headset unless I’m with a team. For some of us, those kinds of comments and behavior dig deeper. Some of us were abused, neglected, or assaulted as children. Those things never leave you, regardless of how hard you work at them. These comments can trigger what we’ve been fighting for years to get past. It’s a lot safer to keep the headset off.
---
Thank you for this. I'm pretty balanced across my SPECIAL points right now due to various choices I've made along the way, although my Luck is a little low.
---
I'm still figuring out what type of weapon to focus on. I've been using a one star legendary pistol that ignores 50% armor as my main weapon, but it's starting to get outclassed once i fight level 20+ super mutants. I also have a silenced hunting rifle for sniping, but the bolt-action is too slow between shots for close combat. I have a combat shotgun for close quarters, and a bladed ski sword for trash like molerats and mongrels. Each basically has a specific use, but I feel like I'll need to chose one as my main weapon soon. I'm just not sure which yet. I'm really starting to struggle on the higher end (for my level) mobs.
---
You can add the scorched mod to most guns
---
Yep. I was in the two busses; loved that spot. Time to find another funky spot.
---
I do too. Time to start saving pre war money. Lol I can see the looking to buy post now : *Looking for 72,000 pre war money*
---
 I'm 72 years old my friend, I doubt you are 144. 
---
 My present char is at level 88 right now. I have several others.
---
saved, thank you
---
I just hope she doesn't ask why the zombies explode when they go to sleep.
---
At the moment I think fisty ones not only benefit from the punchy perks but also the gladiator ones.
---
Shotgun is str also. If you like the sniper, you can get a combat, assault, or handmade off of same perks as long as its not auto.
---
It'd be actually very nice to have staircases that can be lowered or raised to do exactly that!
---
&gt; Stackable picklock isn't a thing, sadly.... 
---
Wait, you can't combine picklock cards? I guess that would explain why I never found a second 1st tier card before I found an Expect card.
---
Really? I gotta try this when I get home.
---
And it is a PITA to place
---
Lots of the time there isn't more than one person with a kill. Other than that it's people crouching I'm pretty certain.
---
Or why I eat them once in a while.
---
Ahhh yeah, well Train stations and Vault 76 are just deadly zones(also watoga, Whitesprings and potentially flatwoods), I know its a pain to just have to walk everywhere, but sometimes it's better than getting your ass blown across the map while dropping all your junk and aids.
---
Another thing to look out for is people who seem to have like practically no health, they're doing a bloodied build and the best way I've fought them is by using a Gamma gun and irradiating them, since much of their lost health is radiation already(due to the Radicool perk card, more rads, more strength)
---
Rest under is just waffle on how you could re-cooperate your lost stimpaks and aid:
---
Since you said you lost a lot of aid, I could recommend a way to get all that back is go to places such as the Watoga emergency centres and grab all the Aid items in there, and also use the perk card in luck that allows a chance to find more aid after pressing "Search". With blood packs use steel and antiseptic along with super duper and you'll get a lot more stimpaks, and sell chems/aid you don't want and with the caps buy more stimmys, it hopefully helps replenish your stock again, did sure for me, in like a week I got a good 200 stimpaks and a bunch of super and diluted stimpaks.
---
I hope that helps!
---
Also I wouldn't be so harsh, the game is improving at a good pace. I normally play just in adventure mode because I'm not so big on PvP, but I find adventure mode really nice, most people are nice and with the weekly updates, there's a good amount of things to do. In adventure mode slap damage was removed I think, so only ways for PvP is if you or the other person fights back after being notified you hit them, or someone contesting your Workshop (died earlier, \*sigh\* lotsa good junk and a good +300 caps gone...(bastard had some TSE gun, actual pussy be a man and fight me with a commie wacker god damn it!))

I've had picklock cards drop in card packs and not show up in the inventory. They cannot be combined. This is a frustrating mechanic,  for sure.
---
Awesome!
---
It's annoying, but I've learned to stop bringing junk when doing the event.  I store ultracite scrap and ballistic fiber, then fast travel.  Even if I'm in the middle of nowhere, getting more isn't much of an issue.  Glassed Caverns, SBQ and fissures for ultracite and military locations for ballistic fiber.  Problem solved.  If someone wants to grab my bag full of fiber, lead, steel, etc I don't care.  I can go to dozens of locations and get more.  The three star boss is more important by far.  Weigh priorities and decide if you'd rather miss out on a three star drop and event loot at the cost of a bunch of scrap that you can regain much more easily.  I'll always opt for the former.
---
The other option is just to not stand in front of the Impostor and let her annihilate you if you're worried about losing your junk.  Grab a conduit or two, jump on the roof of the shack and pluck away at the boss from safety while eating a med-x, mainlining dog food, water and stims.  (hotkeys 8,9,0 and = for me on PC)  You're helping the event much more by not dying and forcing someone else to regain conduits.  Refractor, Good Doggy and First Aid perks make it pretty easy to stay healthy.
---
If you're running a Bloodied build, you have no business taking a conduit.  Your build is shit for that unless you plan on spamming 100 stims nonstop through the whole event and avoid the boss like the plague.
---
Liberty prime is the patron saint of heavy guns builds

&gt; Ignoring a problem removes you from the situation but they'll keep doing what they thought was acceptable.

just make it like fermentizer. Stash some purified water and it will consume 1 can for drink
---
Yeah I bought the bundle (first atoms I bought, by the way), and I'm not quite happy with that sign. I get that it is trying to look old and worn out, but half of the lights not being on makes it look like a mess.
---
Power armour plans, armour plans etc.
---
Incorrect. The hunting rifle is capable of having the perforating magazine which’s adds 40% armor penetration, equating to 20% dmg. The lever has no armor penetration mods. Hunting rifle hits harder, lever action shoots faster.
---
I usually play a sneaky sniper in Bethesda games, but wasn't sure if it was feasible in Fallout 76. I'd love to go sniper with a little close combat skills for support. I don't use auto as I prefer to choose my targets carefully, at least until I get to SHTF moments. XD
---
If you go on to nuka crypt on the internet, they have the completed launch codes for all three silos, but they are found by players so if no one found silo Bravo' s code it isn't there, it is what I used to launch my first because I didn't need to farm to get the codes 
---
Not trying to be rude or mean just something that could save you the hassle of running around the map
---
Shhh don’t talk about this gem. It’s more evil than you can imagine.  Just make sure to run “onegun army and stabilized” with beam splitter.

you have to kill kitty every time you want to drink

Had some 3 star vamps knuckles drop a couple weeks ago. Swing speed, +1 strength... And by drop I mean I dropped them at a queen fight and lost em.
---
Long shot does not work in VATS because it only increases sighted accuracy. VATS uses hip fire accuracy so anything that increases sighted accuracy will not effect vats at all.
---
I dont see a gatling plasma on there or a furious section in the normal gatling tab

Craft a radio. They play it.

To each their own. But I have both. And prefer my lever. 😉

Cause its a jukebox and not a radio
---
You should be able to talk just like us guys, but a lot of guys who play video games are just straight up awful when they encounter girls in game. It's frankly disgusting and I hate that I'm associated with it all.
---
Thank you all! And especially for that list for the dates! Happy to know I love gotten all available can’t wait to see what the special surprise is!
---
I had the eyebots happen in whitespring after a nuke zone despawned, had nothing but lvl 1 eye bots. Or you get the level 26 player with it's camp set up outside, causing the golf course houses to spawn level 20 ghouls. I usually server hop when I come across that, it is the only solution I can come up with. Out of my control with some of the rules of the game.
---
Lol ty for the tip
---
Not my experience. Usually subreddits for games are where you find the most negative criticism of the game
---
The quest was underwhelming, I felt like there should be a step or two more to the quest, or more tape stories about what really went on down there. For example; I learned a lot about the glass caverns, west tek and it's link to huntersville, watoga AMS, not much on burrows or any links to harper's ferry in my runs. Maybe a 2-3 step prologue or attunement quest with some lore would have done it more justice, on top of a few more notes/holo tapes that lead to outside short step quests and what not. I know they had a doctor in the burrows, and shopping plaza, pretty neat city underneath a city.
---
The assaultron wasen't legendary for me either, would have been nice. At least we have opportunities with the ghouls. I treat location bosses as a "oh I hit the end all clear, thanks for the stimpack", it's rare I see a legendary "crown boss" of an area. Like in the general tso's steak house or west tek there is always that crown super mutant but he is hardly legendary half the time. I guess it's more exciting to see a random glowing 3 star super mutant lacky next the boss of an area lol.
---
 I am clumsy as a player, and will back track to make sure I didn't miss anything, or I will check a room twice. Usually takes me about 10 minutes to get to the assaultron boss, then a few more to get out while I do a last police call for nooks and crannies or ghouls I missed. When I found out it was nukeable through this subreddit, it made it all the better. Maybe I haven't figured out an efficient route yet.
---
Not much information needed for those two. The furious has a higher damage potential since it can stack up to 50% more dmg on consecutive hits. The anti armor will have more dmg regularly, but not as much top end dmg potential as the furious.
---
I like it, but as I have stated, I am very disappointed on the difficulty level, and how it wasn't instanced (yes I know it they never said it would be instanced, I just thought it would be logical), but I'm not going to trash it. I have gotten my money's worth out of the game, so whatever. Disappointing, but hey, more free content.
---
This is why players killed must be the only stat that reveals your location. It acts as kind of bounty system and a warning system it works really well as is.
---
Then perception is your friend. Rifleman (3 cards, can level to 3 each), Tank Killer (armor pen). Theres an agility card that increases sneak attack damage (not a huge bump, but it helps), and you can also become harder to detect (more sneak attacks). All the sniper rifle perks will also add damage and armor pen to your non scoped rifles as well. If you want to melee or shotgun close range, can probably fit a few cards in for more damage out of str tree.
---
I mean, the super mutant suiciders try to tackle you while carrying them like footballs.
---
Eugh... All the bugs are so gross that I refuse to eat them. It's the only thing that I refuse to even consume hypothetically in a video game.
---
Except for the Red Ant Lager, but not because of the +50 carry weight buff. It's because the alcohol sterilizes the gross bug meat. Definitely because of the "science." Not because of the weight buff.
---
At all.
---
Why on Earth are you placing it on the doorframe like that?  The frame is raised above the plane the sign is placed on, of course it's going to be unreadable if almost the entire sign is being clipped.
---
Lately, I've been able to make about 1-1/2 levels per WS nuke run, but I've alos noticed the respawn rate has been higher/faster than usual.
---
If they restock/replace a weapon just after it's sold it would be fairer, unless someone with a shed-load of tokens turns up and keeps buying the good ones. Maybe they could restrict selling too much to each player .. but then their uncle's mule comes back to swipe them.
---
Could have used this awhile ago as I already figured a work around.
---
I honestly don't get this viewpoint. How petty do you have to be to think that people who are willing to put _any_ energy into this game at all at this point _don't play the game_?
---
I bitch about this game all the time, because I _play_ the game _all the time_, and I run into bugs, bad decisions, and frustrating situations with other players _frequently_.
---
So I can still see a way for camp smashers/griefers to continue to get their jollies, but they can only pick on camps that have turrets.
---
No Tesla rifle on there
---
You can’t test using the pip boy dmg numbers as the person you are replying to already told you. And you should listen to him because he is correct. The hunting rifle can be modded with the perforating magazine, giving it 40% more armor penetration which equates to roughly around 20% more dmg, but again, and this is the important part you need to remember, armor penetration won’t be factored into your pip-boy damage numbers, but when you shoot something it sure as hell will be factored in.
---
The lever action cannot be modded with a perforating magazine, making it inferior when it comes to damage per shot, but the lever action also fires quite a bit faster than the hunting rifle. So the trade off is basically a little harder hitting, or a little faster firing, other than that he guns are pretty close to the same.
---
Prepare for the end of days.
---
The damage difference between max-level hunting and lever rifles is only 7%, so you missed another difference somewhere.
---
**SCOREBOARD** \- Doesn't work most of the time. Even on maps with clear frontrunners, the numbered circles only show up for me infrequently (on some maps not at all). It's frustratingly hard to find other people who want to engage in PvP and this makes it worse. Would recommend fixing that bug and creating some other indicators of where fighting is taking place (those little pink skulls marking death bags help, but are hard to scour the map for). 
---
**ADVENTURE MODE C.A.M.P. DAMAGE PROTECTIONS** \- this is going to be a frustrating feature as people will be able to built turret camps at WhiteSpring and other common farming spots with no way for anyone to push them back.  Recommend at least expanding the no-build areas around the golf club if implemented.
---
...wait,  how is what I asked "not your experience"? You've played this game for 10 minutes, you said. You have no "experience".
---
I have no interest in Survival whatsoever, but I do think fast travel areas should be safe zones.
---
I have it on XBox and on PC.
---
My PC is about six years old.  I'd say it runs slightly worse than on XBox, but it's not a big difference.  No monthly fee is a plus.  I haven't modded it yet, but that's also a plus.
---
Honestly the thing that keeps me from playing it on PC often is the fact that I work from home so I'm already at that same PC for 40 hours a week to work.  I don't want to spend more time here to play video games.  When I'm not working I like to be far away from this room.  But that's me.
---
Wiiiiierd that was not a reply to you.. idk how reddit messed that up
---
On PC you can change your settings to "push to talk" so ambient noise isn't blaring out at all times, only when you are actually talking. I find this to be pretty effective.
---
I think PVP restriction before level 5 is still in. It's not possible to get kills on new players as they spawn in. Why can't a low level spawn at camp? That is always the most reliable spawn point.
---
Apologies that reply was ment for a different comment. I’m not sure how it ended up as a reply to yours
---
Awesome. That sounds like a lot of fun. Thank you.  Fortunately, I have quite a bit in perception already.
---
In the pip-boy numbers that's what explosive does, yes. What it does in practice is largely unknown. As far as I can tell, the only difference in the ESM is that it changes the projectile type.
---
Also, be forewarned. The Jukeboxes can take a little time to "tune in" so to speak.
---
Thanks for the unasked for and useless advice.  If I'm carrying several hundred pounds of aid WITH Traveling Pharmacy how much do you exactly think it all weighs without it that I would ever be able to stash it?  I'm not trashing thousands of chems just to try out a mode that's eventually going to go new-character-only eventually.
---
I often do the same but sometimes I have a workshop claimed I don't want to lose.
---
Reddit does that sometimes.
---
Calm down there Liberty Prime.
---
Hello, Kitty.
---
Saw this and thought the same thing. Hate those things. Was walking back to Watoga, overencumbered, after a scorchbeast queen victory. Was ambushed right before the bridge by about 6 of them. Took way too long and way too much ammo to finally get them off me. Would have rather fought a SB. It seems nearly impossible to cripple them with enforcer too.
---
Wow! lol!
---
The rewards are always max level of you don't mind transferring it somehow.
---
Hey man, this sounds pretty interesting. Are you guys on PC?
---
I would prefer to have boiled water, since that's what needed for all the recipes anyway.
---
Damn I missed the first one...it’s fucked.
---
I personally would prefer if all work arounds were removed, as I hate camp destruction. Unfortunately there are some camps that warrant it, and I look the other way when they are destroyed. Turret camps at whitesprings, and excessive siren houses. So I guess, overall, I am on the fence.
---
Yeah. The gatling plasma ammo dumps are annoying. I fire maybe 20-30 shots before it randomly decides to eject the clip.
---
Just out of curiosity - if you are already inside of the burrows when the nuke hits, will you die?
---
Bloodied is a direct health inverse in 5% bands. It maxes at +95% damage below 5% hp.
---
Adrenal Reaction maxes at +50% damage at 20% hp. I can dig up the other bands if you need it.
---
Well said.
---
As people have been saying, the helmet is available on PC. I can sell you one, if you're interested and on PC
---
Don't know about that one, but sometimes when I take nuke codes off of the backpack guy it crashes.
---
I was a bit worried what they were running away from. :P
---
I say just an AutoDoc that's craftable for the CAMP.  Would make the most sense.  Also heals, removes limb damage, etc.
---
Well done my friend..good report soldier. But as per a previous post I stuck on here..there's very little reward for killing the sbq, just the feeling of satisfaction that you did it
---
Can anyone tell the the math behind the damage difference between scorch killer receiver and hardended?
---
 (In terms of dealing damge to scorched)
---
They are.  Next update changes Adventure mode to Trail Hiking mode
---
What’s the mascot outfit? The one you buy in the store?
---
When I came home and saw my mirelurk king “Pinky” dead was one of my worst fallout days. 😭
---
Now we just need some foundations that are effectively just floor, with no struts underneath.
---
The list you *know* of
---
Yup. Ive had decent drops in the past (T-51/T-60 Jetpack Plans), but usually its 1* armor/weapons.
---
Fighting an SBQ is like going to Vegas-- enjoy the ride, know you'll lose all your money, and expect nothing.
---
Well, I'm going to be old **you** for a lot longer.
---
Only level 38, and only get in about 6 hours play time a week. No legendaries as I don't farm for them at this point. I can take out level 60s, but not even close to one shot. Still need bloody mess, more levels for top tier regular weapons, etc. It's going to be awhile.
---
That’s some the of best advice your scrub ass is gonna get, and a dumbass like yourself should be begging me for advice to be honest, because you’re clearly too stupid and incapable of finding information like this for yourself which is easily obtainable.
---
And no one ever said trashing all your aid, let me guess you’re one of those guys that plays the game with no friends, so you have no one to help you transfer all your extra stuff to a mule? What a sad fallout experience, honestly you should quit the game because you’re gonna be dropping so much shit, why bother in the first place?
---
And to answer your moronic question, if you’re using travel pharmacy and thru hiker both at rank 3 and carrying 100 pounds of aid, then that aid will weigh 1000 pounds without the perks, sorry you can’t do basic math but there’s another ‘useless’ answer for your dumbass.
---
Well said...I'm ashamed to say I've not once fought the sbq and I'm level 194
---
I try to blow up as many cars as possible en lieu of tossing nukes like footballs.
---
Yes. But the time it takes for you to run from the respawn point back to the pylon is time when the pylon is not activated, unless another player activated it. That rarely happens. I think conduits dying extends the event and it's better to keep conduits alive without interruption.
---
I used to hit the cap stash in the Stump behind Flatwood church every day.  There were constantly free roaming cats there.  And they were "enemies" even though they were non aggressive so they made it impossible to fast travel until you killed them.
---
Well thats the beauty of this game, you arent forced down any particular path. #noshame
---
I foresee complains about people picking locks to become wanted and then leveling the entire base.
---
Your extractors and purifiers just became community resources.
---
I feel like if I’m not aimed perfectly at them and right up in their grill (like kissing close) I miss them.
---
Absolutely to all.
---
close in looks but more damaged and different colors, its the derpy looking one from the trailer
---
‘Glitch’. Sure. Accept some responsibility... did you bring him friends to play with? Toys to occupy his time?  Maybe if you were a more responsible pet owner your deathclaw wouldn’t have ‘run away from home’
---
Yup..hence my question, it's not addressing the issue is it...best not to lock anything or have turrets at all...base location is clearly key here
---
I accidentally got a 10 cap bounty helping to clear a workshop. So I popped into a Survival server so I’d only lose 1/4 my level in caps and I knew I’d easily find pvp death. I joined the server at Whitesprings station. Dead before I could move. 
---
Thanks?
---
It isn't though. You're meant to work together with people to decode the nukes. If BGS wanted to, they could just require you to find 8 code pieces or w/e and they get consumed every time you want to nuke, and then you have to find / buy 8 more. They didn't.
---
Sexism in gaming is very real :(
---
Yup, got my mouth washed out with soap a few times too.  I'm not saying the practices of parenting by the generation before us were acceptable, but I think there's a huge focus on kids being raised as the most precious of the special instead of part of a community of respect.
---
had a deathclaw for 2 weeks then after the update last week i got attacked by 6 lvl 60 cave crickets (first time ever, in months at this camp) and one was a 3 star legendary (that dropped a 1 star wood peice.. screw you bethesda for that insult), killed my poor lvl 20 deathclaw trying to defend my camp..  
---
looked for two days only thing i have found i was able to tame was a level 14 snallygaster.. 2 nights ago it was alive when i logged off. when i looged back in last night it was dead, not sure how it got killed while i was off game (no one has access to my account and my wife and only other one in the house i doubt would even know how to log into the game). be another night of me looking for a pet..  
---
im 248 i think, you would think i could tame that lvl 60 albino i see. or hell i would love to be able to tame that lvl 95 glowing one at the thundermountain substation by watoga, i mean if they gonna start sending lvl 60 squads at my camp with a 3 star legendary in the mix raise the level of what we can tame, and what creatures we can tame.  
---
but i feel ya. good luck in your search.
---
Definitely no bonus, but it's my understanding that weapon condition is tied to damage output in any event, meaning if a rifle's under 100% condition, then you're not doing 100% damage. I've seen this in posts, wikis, etc., but I've never fully tested it. It certainly feels like it though.
---
How many list are there? Damn
---
Hahaha
---
I think the taming system needs a rework. In my opinion:
---
* Tameable animals shouldn't require a random encounter. You should be able to tame them anywhere as long as you're twice their level or higher (2 hour cooldown period before you can tame another animal to prevent abuse)
---
* An animal should teleport to your camp once tamed (I've given up on trying to have a tamed animal at my camp because 80% of the time they never show up). 
---
* Option to have your tamed animal follow you around and act as a companion. 
---
* A structure (maybe a pen) you can place in your camp that your tamed animal will hang around. If it dies, you can use meat/plants as bait at the structure to lure in a new one (my version of a respawn mechanic for them. 30 minute cooldown between lurings)
---
G'damn synths are everywhere.
---
i think forcing players to either use an op build or have a high skill level is much better for the game than forcing players to create entirely new characters frequently
---
I think it might go by weekly if no one has kills I end up 3rd a lot with 0 kills hopefully they hotfix it
---
It is better for PVE oriented players now. Less penalties for death, 20% exp boost, nobody can find you on the map, and anyone with a kill gets a target painted on them.
---
I level my characters on Survival and PVP on Adventure.
---
I'm a "high" level. I have been playing since BETA and am level 131. Lately I love farming the burrows. Finding weapons for me and my friends and giving some to people I meet because I wont use them. All of the hate toward Bethesda and high levels and anyone for anything makes me hate the community sometimes.
---
However at least I can live in my camp and not have it destroyed by grade a asswipes
---
NP.
---
In previous fallouts (NV, 3, and 4) , I was always an automatic gunner, so melee was a big departure for me.  But I have discovered I really like melee.
---
As you level up, you'll get better weapons.  
---
I had a 1\* L20 machete that was my primary from L20 to about L48.  Worked well in mobs, even in the WS nuke zone.  I have something thats faster now, but I still carry that machete as a backup, although I will end up giving it to another player at some point.
---
&gt; Honestly the overreach in Survival on correcting cap loss basically ensured that there’s no incentive for a new or lower level player to enter and play. 
---
A new and lower level player would likely enter the game having no knowledge of any of that.   So your claim is very unlikely.
---
Yes! You stated it a wee bit more eloquently then I'm able to, right on target. 
---
There is just no place for this crap...I have a fairly stressful job so my game time is important to me and I assume for everyone else. I don't like these entitled, sheltered little pricks ruining it for anyone!
---
Perfectly reasonable response  and pretty much what I had assumed.
---
I don't like your idea. If you are in a nuked zone you gottaaaa be in somekind of high tech suit. Maybe if you had like a full set of some kind of new legendary effect that reduces radiation damage? Maybe a mutation that allows you to become a ghoul or Super Mutant?
---
Can you add the Grognacks axe, thank you!
---
Does this include bleed damage for the items that do that, like sharp pickaxe?
---
 I chose to walk a few feet instead. ;)
---
i couldnt help but laugh at the back up and pull out the 10mm.. cat phobia?
---
Ohh, okay, that's simple enough. I'm running with Enforcer at rank 2 right now, using a TSE combat shotty. Been pretty effective in crippling, noticed it a ton while running the Burrows. Thanks for the info, I'll look into the play through video later!
---
Works for me. I mean I can go make disease cures, but I'd be cool with having something at home to do the trick.
---
This doesn't really change the survival aspect of the game, if you don't already have free water in your base your doing something wrong
---
I haven’t hear or seen anything about this have you tried disease cure? Or maybe just wait about 30 min?
---
As I wrote, 500 caps.
---
I'm level 121 and I have completed the main quest line, and most of the side quests.  I get on everyday, do the challenges, level up atleast once, play around with my perk cards to see where I can improve my character (there's always room for improvement), do my rounds to gather weapons and such to sell, get my caps, join some events...there are always things to do.  And at level 47, your character still has a lot of room for improvement.  You may not fear anything...neither do I...but I get joy out of completing the content.  And having your stash box full of fusion cores and scrap is great...but you have to run around and use it...then after you've been fighting for a couple for a couple of hours and your weapons and armor are in need of repair and you realize your 2 short of steel to fix that last thing...go farm.  Your down to your last couple of fusion cores...take over a power plant workshop, or two, or three...that's a lot of fun!!  You may be at a place where you feel safe right now, but you can't just fill up your box and say you're done...you've just become a hoarder, not a gamer.
---
What time do these refresh in EU?
---
check the chat slider...I think its the 3rd one down the list?
---
  For some reason, mine always reverts to the far left.
---
Reset it to far right, and chat usually works again.
---
Ok what’s ur psn?
---
That happened to me when I had plague walker. Try using another. It basically keeps your sicknesses after the timer runs out. Try using another radaway.
---
FO76 has been rock-solid on my PC (mid-range home-build in May 2015: Win 10, i5-4690K, SSD, GTX 970, 32GB RAM) -- zero CTD or stutters since B.E.T.A. [YMMV]
---
My point is, based on the status page, I should be taking less radiation than in the Hazmat suit. What's the point of having stats if they don't actually mean anything?
---
I was thinking to go Vegas, but if it feels like a SBQ I will skip it.
---
Or get one of those nifty doors with the keypad on it.
---
I did several sprints across the map to get a bounty, I make sure I put a bounty on every one who kills me so I can hunt them down.. I wish more people would do it.
---
I quite like to stalk wanted players , find them then hold back and take down the players who come for them .. then finally take them out.
---
UPDATE:
---
It’s fine the timer came back after a while when it reached 30mins but I did panic a little
---
miskhak
---
Dying to put a hot pink “GET OUT ME SWAMP” sign somewhere in my camp.
---
Ouch. It was the first time I've seen them roaming free. :P
---
Haha. No. At first I thought it was a radrat actually. I was ready to go rock and roll after having survived Sutton. :P
---
If you can do continuous SBQ runs/Scorched Earth with a group that's launching 3 per server and hopping, that might be fastest.  Just don't ignore the adds.
---
I don't know, mini nukes are awfully firm, and you can't just let the air out of em...
---
I keep seeing people saying there were hoards of ghouls and I died, or almost died so many times, there were quite a few legendaries.  I just didn't see any of that.  I had, at the most, 10 ghouls, then some gutsy's and the assaultron at the end.  I spent about a half hour in there just looking around.  I went in solo and didn't even use 1 stim.  I enjoyed it, don't get me wrong, but I want the hordes or ghouls and to almost die!  Someone mentioned to me to try it while nuked, which I'll definitely do!
---
They have those? You just make your own pin?
---
Yeah, that struck me right away, and I'm glad you posted about it. If that's the case then down come my turrets. Which is kind of annoying as low level enemies are always attacking my camp (it's up the hill, at an angle, to  the overseer's camp). Sure, no problem taking out level 1s and 5s, but they are constantly destroying my crops in seconds if there's no turrets to hit back. Yeah, I can just spend the 20 seconds it takes to do it myself, but it always seems to happen when I'm trying to sort my stash, crafting ammo, etc. Not a complaint at all, but it seems like they should just make a turrets pacifist if we are.
---
im in the same boat.. Ive never once heard another players voice chat.. 
---
Ive tried checking the sliders and making sure its on area.. all the stuff people typically suggest whenever these threads come up.. all to no avail...
---
What are we considering "high level" to be here?
---
It's turning into a premier legendary farm, for sure.  I had a "bad luck" run and still came away with a weightless 3 star cultist blade that I stored for legendary vending &gt;!(3star green gutsy in the boss area)!&lt;, along with a couple single star armors and a troubleshooters/+10 aim damage tommygun that I'll swap in commando perks and try out for the next Encryptid I see.  Not bad for 30-40 minutes.
---
I've been having issues with Auto setting as well (PS4)
---
Well I definitely got a kick out of reading your reply.  I think Molly Weasley is pretty damn accurate!  
---
I said it in a previous reply, but I just want all of our young women to know how to respond.  It's going to happen, we can't control everything, but when people stand up for themselves, change happens.
---
Fun game! Cant seem to put it down. So much to do/explore/CAMPS/PVP/groups
---
Nope, mines all the way to the right and nothing :/
---
No, it doesn't. It's either a bug or intended by Bethesda because that's how it's worked since FO4.
---
Oh hey, you gotta reply to my comment or else it doesn't notify me. 
---
I have. 
---
Bird bones, empath, herd mentality, scaly skin, electric discharge, twisted muscles and eagle eyes,
---
This sub is toxic, I'm toxic, just play the game.
---
I used to be able to hear people, took a month long break and now can't hear anyone
---
Just tried it with a buddy of mine, doesn't do that on the PC.
---
Me too!  I have OCD and the exploration/collecting/building aspect of fallout is IMMENSELY helpful.  I'm level 299 though, and I ain't got time to mess around with some disrespecting little dude.  Cut into my me-time and I'm not happy.
---
I use it to and I love it, took about 5 kills to get the aiming down.
---
Also the 500 round clip is handy.
---
I would not die to you. I have assassin sentinel and im invincible with my gauss rifle and now you told me your weakness, stealthboys. I think we'd have a good battle. Also, I agree Bloodied is best, but I use bloody explosive gauss and snipe people in one shot. I can tell instantly if it's a sentinel and I always have a crit ready for their heads.
---
That's sounds very intriguing. Where did you get that idea from?
---
Now you say that jokingly, but I seem to recall soldiers in WW2 doing just that with their mortar shells in a pinch.
---
No, it will give it to whatever character completes the last part of it. So do most of it with the level 1 alt, then swap to your main for 30 seconds and kill a level 5 scorched on survival with them, then log back into normal servers. You'll get the weapon on your main and you won't have to do any pvp or worry about your main being killed in pvp on survival that way.
---
Well in that case, it would only matter who sees who first lol
---
Give us an example of a joke, mister oppressed guy.
---
My 1* pistol is lvl 5, which is becoming an issue. I haven't found anything that does more damage yet though, and the 50% armor ignore is very useful for things like super mutants, but it seems to be near the end of its usefulness. I really hope I can find something better soon, particularly if it's a legendary rifle. I'm starting to think that's the route I'm going.
---
5 hours since this was posted and no love for the Atom Cats?  So many meshes they already made for FO4 that I'd love to see in this game...
---
\&gt; or a proper flat base 
---
[https://imgur.com/v7TlQIP](https://imgur.com/v7TlQIP)
---
I have the plan for it and for the life of me cannot remember where I got it from after having logged over 400 hours into the game.  I play on PS4 and have never even seen the dev room.
---
Maybe its an xbox thing. Watched it happen 2 days ago at my gf camp. She couldn't finish him off when he was downed because of pacifist.
---
Wow, looks nice and is original. Nice job.
---
Was going to say that, the Raider torso has the highest Radiation Resistance power armor torso on 76. How did a Raider high on ~~jet~~ cow fumes did that? Doesn't sound very common sense to me.
---
Agreed. Too many babies whining who can't defend themselves in a wasteland, crying to daddy Bethesda that little Timmy stomped their sand castles. Pathetic.
---
Reminds me of my days at AMERICAN HIGH and that stinking Richard 'BALL LOVER' Marcus
---
Super disappointed in this item. Caveat emptor
---
Damn. I actually like the Commanders Charge, except I prefer playing alone and seeking out randoms to play with in survival is asking to be griefed. I'm pretty sad they still try to force teaming that much, let me be a lone wanderer :(
---
Okay, I'll bite:
---
\- What did you get out of destroying camps?
---
\- Is that all you do? Because . . . (see next question)
---
\- Your whole clan is going to quit the game because of this?
---
\- I'm not a kid, I'm middle aged, and I don't want my camp destroyed. 
---
\-What does having a "sack" have to do with this?
---
So I haven’t been playing long and heard camping there that the WS robots would help protect your camp. I don’t have any turrets set up, and just like the central location for fast travel and free protection. Is this frowned upon?
---
I’ve heard only 30%
---
Every encounter I’ve had with people on the mic has been a good one. I’ve never met someone to give me crap because I’m a female but I don’t doubt there’s people that do. Sorry you’ve had some bad encounters though.
---
The only “love” letters I’ve gotten is because I beat them in PVP and for whatever reason they feel the need to trash talk me after.
---
Here have a bag of salt .. .it's hilarious how pvp douche bag players like yourself are more salty than us pve players ... I said I would laugh and personally been looking for this update .. go play on survival servers and leave us PVE players alone, this is a welcome change, now I can build in peace ...

Go to the deathclaw statue and arrow to the right...it's in there but hidden pretty good.
---
1 man team? Oh that's why you are confused. It isn't just me, it was a group of us that created the falllout 4 mod that allowed multiplayer on it, not to mention it isn't just I working on the reverse engineering of the servers for fo76.
---
You also seem to think I've never done game development, I'm nearly 50 years old and I worked in game dev when you were still in diapers. 
---
Did you ever hear of Midway? Rush 64? Yeah, I worked on that and many other games. But I'm not saying anything else because being a woman makes it very easy if I give more info than that to doxx me. 
---
Want to keep talking out your ass now?
---
That is pretty clever. I did a similar thing when low levels were marked on the map for being alive too long during the 200% cap rewards days.
---
Sure, although none of the wikis mention a reasonable damage. What level, strength do you have and what number you see ingame?
---
Literally all of these things would make taming and having a pet so much better. I hope someone from Bethesda sees your list and takes it into consideration.
---
I've actually got an auto anti armor combat rifle I can give away I just got today.  I also have a vampires auto combat shotgun I'd sell for like 2k or a buttload of .45 or 5.56 if you are on ps4
---
Will do. If you don't enjoy the game, there really isn't a reason to play it. 
---
See you and your faction in a few weeks when you guys stop with the temper tantrums.
---
I'm fine with the current logic of needing Power Armor or a Hazmat Suit to enter nuke zones. They're *nuke zones* after all.
---
I'm just gonna wait for the endgame content that isn't nuke zones. The Encryptid event is a start, and I doubt all of the vaults opening up for raids this summer will be heavily irradiated.
---
I get it. Guys are guys... but what I don't get is why so many guys treat girls like this in game?
---
Would we like it if this was happening to our, mother, girlfriend, wife, sister, daughter, female friends?
---
What the fuck. Seriously.
---
Must be, because pacifist makes it to where you, your turrets, and your pet won't attack.
---
Set bird feeders outside
---
Sneak/Crit/VATS build - 2 Strength, HazMat suit, +250 encumbered when in HazMat
---
i use 3-5x as more diluted radaways vs. stimpacks in Nuke Zones.
---
Nah, its fun... if you have no issues parting from your money.
---
This is grade A story telling, can't wait for the next installment if there is one. Role-playing really is a lot of fun and has many choices of what to roleplay in F76 and I see you decided to go and be a story teller and it is an amazing story so far
---
When I first started playing I had issues shooting the guns in the game...I was always missing.  This is only the second game I've played on Xbox.  I've always been a Nintendo girl.  Anyways, it just takes practice.  I would do Back to Basics at Camp McClintock.  You have to complete 3 tasks, one of them being marksmanship.  You can practice there with different rifles/pistols.  And try different ones until you find one you like.  I'm mainly a melee build with some big guns.  I do keep a \*\*\*Berserker's Handmade for when I need a rifle.  I'm still not the greatest with guns, but a lot better than when I started out.  If you're on xbox, look me up...BadWolfSat5.  I'd be happy to help you out in any way I can!
---
Could you make one for me?
---
They're definitely going to be cautious with whatever they do, otherwise as you say too many players will have these god-roll weapons and that will unbalance the game (the same as it did with the mass duping of TSE weapons). They could time-lock the re-rolls (eg. to 1 per day) on any weapon, so that it could take you weeks or months to get there, depending on how the re-rolls actually work.
---
It's slow but more will come, I'm not sure the best way to let anyone know another part is out but I edit a link into the next parts when I throw them up.
---
So maybe tomorrow maybe later but if you check back here there will be links to part 4
---
As long as your turrets aren't stealing kills I think people don't mind.  It's people setting up their CAMP right behind the club house with the turrets looking into the windows that people dislike.
---
I'm not a kid either, and like many others, I put a lot of time into my camp as a place for me to relax, or for friends to hang out. 
---
I don't want my camp destroyed constantly by someone who plays just for that purpose, and especially by people who have used various methods to get the absolute best gear, so that if I choose to fight back as someone who is playing normally, I stand no chance.
---
Sorry but not sorry, take your antics elsewhere.
---
I lol'd at "My wHOLe FActIOn (TwenTY PLuS...)"
---
I had a very nice encounter with a lady gamer.  It happened when I needed someone to kill me off because of a bounty.  
---
It occurred because I was attacked by a monster in someone's yard.  So it needed to happen at a good time, not while I was trying to finish a quest.  At first she didn't want to kill me.  Eventually she did but apologized the whole time.  It was pretty funny.  
---
Thanks mystery lady!
---
Well said .. talk about salty camp destroyers ...
---
Would help when scouting treasure map locations for sure.
---
If you like raiding and want destructible camps sack up and go play survival.
---
pretty much this. the base damage difference is nothing compared to being able to fire twice as fast.
---
Go back to Arc and play with your over-sized sack.
---
You won't be missed.
---
Take butcher’s bounty for these spawns people are calling out. You can search the body for even more meat, so you don’t have to hop around as much.
---
I can hear that
---
You can set it to 60 mins, and change your audio settings to record all. Just remember, it's illegal in most of the USA to record someone without they're knowledge, lol. Not like you'd ever get prosecuted..
---
If he wants to destroy camps he can sack up and go play Survival with people that want to participate in that content
---
I like my internet points, so I'm not going to take yours. But there still is no gain to deatroying any camp structure.
---
 No dropped junk, no dropped aid, nothing. How would you not see the removal of a feature that quite honestly does, nothing.
---
No, he's just been stalking you and studying you so that he can become you.
---
Next thing you know he'll be cutting locks if your hair while you're sleeping so he can eat it.
---
I moved it around to various locations - metal wall, brick wall, corrugated metal wall. It looked the same. It's not glitching into wall. I'll post pics of mine when I get on later tonight, but since you're in the minority here that thinks it looks fine, it might be helpful if you post pics of yours. I'm wondering if it's in a brightly lit area all the time.
---
Well isn’t the premise that you are drunk and stumble away? In the game it seems like teleporting but I think it’s supposed to be blackout drunk.  I would pay to see deathclaws wandering away drunk though, SB trying to fly would be awesome!
---
Does this calculate DPS?
---
I've always been curious how a FAST melee weapon compares to a SLOW melee weapon with much higher dmg output.
---
20+ faction. That supposed to impress anyone?
---
Mini Nuke Grenades.
---
Yeah I can imagine it would be pretty bad for you girls, there's alot of pretty messed up people out there, and then the people who will say stuff over a Mic or over the internet that they wouldn't say in real life. I would say the same thing you already said keep ypur head up and keep playing a game you enjoy, block and report people who are doing or saying inappropriate things and stay off mic as much as you can. And it's a shame that you would have to do that.
---
&gt;If you can't actually help by getting a pylon at some point, then don't do the event.
---
That's fucking bullshit. Not everyone is specced to sustain that heavy DoT, but they can contribute other ways like damaging the squatch or keeping the robots off the conduit's back.
---
I have 500 friends on xbox, does that make me popular?
---
Ok, I’m on a putting green maybe 100 clicks from the outside pool. I just don’t want someone destroying my camp just for being there. Thanks for the input.
---
The game needs more radstorms. I cannot remember the last time I was in one.
---
I wanted the sign above door ideally and that was most visible spot for the picture. [Brick](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/330511405264535552/568518706058231831/unknown.png) walls in general are the worst for it. I ended up leaving it on the cement wall because it was the lightest surface for it outside but it wouldn't let me place it lower. I find it to be [crummy](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/330511405264535552/568521236607533076/unknown.png) everywhere.
---
I have same issue. Always reverts to right no matter what i do
---
Architect here, Depending on the size of your building, the walls are probably sufficient enough to bear on.
---
Scorchkiller adds a -20% debuff to the damage, but when you target a scorched, you buff up 50% relative to the debuff.
---
For example, handmade has 45 damage. Hardened handmade has 56.25 damage because of 25% damage boost from hardened. A scorch-killer's handmade is -20%, 36 damage, but when you hit a scorched, +50% damage kicks in on top of 36, so 54 damage.
---
If you prime, you get +25% damage by default: 56.25, just like hardened, but if you hit a scorched, +30% additional buff kicks in so you deal 73.13 damage. If you have Zealot legendary, that's another +30% against scorched: 95.06%.
---
(I fixed some calculation errors on the page so you should now correctly see these numbers.)
---
My question is... when did Bethesda promise that camps would always be easily destroyed? I never read or heard this.
---
You and your group can go get your jollies on PVP servers. 
---
Yeah, not a kid, and I'm a woman, so I dont need a sack.  
---
Nothing is won by destroying what someone built in adventure mode, except you looking like shit person.
---
If this is what makes you quit the game, then by all means, quit. I'm sure no one will miss you.
---
Go long
---
Take as much time as you need because something late and finished is a hole lot better than something rushed and unfinished, something Bethesda doesnt understand
---
No, it's not "fucking bullshit" if you can't activate a pylon, then don't do the fucking event. Simple as fucking that. I'm not "specced" to take a pylon, but I do it anyways cause no one else except my teammates will. If you go in without stimpaks, and you know damn well that you can't activate a pylon, you have no business being there.
---
😂
---
Burn the house down. As the bird is escaping the flames, throw a melon at it, miss, and watch it fly away as your shelter crumples to dust.
---
"Most" state recording laws only require 1 party to know the recording is going on....for telephone calls anyway. I'm not sure how that translates to video games though.
---
Yep... that’s the downside :(
---
Well is quite simple, this is a necessary improvement to player vending update, some people like to play a different role than you perhaps, so, feel free to go to Survival server and mess with people who like to engage PVP, then you and your Faction can destroy everything, is simple...
---
High risk, high rewards right? 20% more XP, AID Items etc...
---
Also, dont tell me you play a "Raider" role because i never saw a Raider wearing BOS, Marine, Combat, X01, T60 etc...
---
r/fallout jerks off obisidan and hates 76 while this sub is the opposite. it’s hard to get an unbiased opinion here.
---
Had a small discussion on an ITV thread about this, and I am lazy, so just gonna link in case you want to read.

1. Destroying camps is one of very few ways to get another faction's attention for trade, war, pissing off, etc. Slap damage removal already made this a headache
---
2. 2. It is not all we do but it is a HUGE part of faction warfare which I understand a lot of people don't participate in but it's one of the most requested features on here.
---
3. Not all, but the vast majority. We also have very skilled hitmen who collect for our loan business which will now cease to exist. 
---
4. I understand you don't want your camp destroyed. But the reality is there are dicks who are gunna do it. There are MULTIPLE other ways to fix this. They could punish the GRIEFERS rather than EVERYBODY. Apply a debuff to them if they destroy too much stuff or something, ANYTHING else.
---
5. The lack of a "sack" is a metaphor for not being a whiny little baby who can't handle playing a game when everybody isn't your friend. There are already no NPCs in the game. Sometime ENEMIES can be a good and entertaining thing in a game. I'd be willing to bet you wish there were more NPCs in the game and more enemies to fight that were more of a challenge.
---
Considered getting it for my Jim Nance playthrough but then I realized it said Friends Welcome instead of Welcome Friends, so nah.
---
I've dropped bags of spoiled meat and crap on the floor of my house, fast traveled to Whitesprings to visit the vendors, and come back an hour later to find the bag still sitting there, so they definitely persist for a while.
---
It generates a random 4-digit pin when you place the door in your camp. If you don't like the pin, you can always store the door, the re-place it till you get one you like or is easy to remember.
---
Furious, bloodied, and junkies can all potentially get up to a 50% damage boost.
---
Worse then that, they haven't developed that future tech yet but the will!
---
Hey, man, let the six people who actually like this game have their hugbox plz.
---
Agreed. I came within seconds of buying this last night, and then hesitated, and then stopped because I realized I had not actually seen this sign in the wild, and wasn't sure how it would look when actually applied.
---
Thanks for saving me some atom thingies.
---
I don't know how to compare energy and ballistic weapons yet as they have different resistances, so the 100 ballistic DR and 25 Energy DR would not match up.
---
Thanks man, I did originally read this but it has more replies/content now. It's cool. Camp placement is key now.
---
We are not griefers. We participate in clan warfare which yes involves smashing camps. We aren't coming out to destroy your little innocent camps!
---
Possibly.  But not a roof just hanging in space so I thought they needed some support:  [https://imgur.com/5JIw7Fb](https://imgur.com/5JIw7Fb)
---
More than likely we won’t get to pick what we get, a gamble just like killing a ghoul. So it’s gonna be fair game just like when you’re playing and looting from dead ghouls.
---
Say if they set the drop rate of ‘good stuff’ at 1/1000, a token-rich guy can spend all his and his uncle’s tokens on the first 999 garbage items, then when he left overencumbered with four-star stalkers tire irons you walk in and get a god tier bazooka with your few tokens. Fair to him and his uncle? lol
---
I’ll take the assassins handmade plz. Ign raybear1105, can u give me 45min?
---
If i'm out of your vats range i'm just gonna shred you to pieces with my gatling gun :)
---
nah.  but when i AM sober, YOU will still be crazy.
---
thththththththththththt
---
Okay - where is this faction warfare? Only on the servers the 20+ of you frequent? The only ones I've seen are the flairs here.
---
I don't know if it's sexist of me to do this, but I always prefer to give any useful junk that I have to girl players.
---
I gave a level 3 girl about 5k worth of extra plans I had the other day. She was nice and friendly (threw up the heart emoji) so I doubled back and gave her 20 stims, some rad away and some ammo.
---
It's hard in the gaming world for girls, so I always appreciate when I see one.
---
Don't let the door hit ya where the good lord split ya
---
The original post the replies are off of is buried because no one likes the whitesprings turret camps.
---
Ashamed mother is the next name of my handmade rifle.
---
In poster's defense, anyplace on that brick wall would clip like that. To your argument, this is a pretty good reason they are unusable on brick walls.
---
&gt;...it might be helpful if you post pics of yours.
---
I will try to remember to do that when I get home.
---
It’s even better because they are hoping for some system that will rain TSE and Bloodied legendaries down on them tossing the current balance and economy right out the window. 
---
They don’t want “crap” legendaries... well there’s tons of combinations of legendaries and weapons, even if Two Shot, Explosive, Instant Win or whatever legendary they want had a favorable chance over all the others, and they will have even chances at best, there’s still tons of legendaries so the odds are still against them. 
---
We are getting another way to roll for legendaries, and that’s it. It’s a second chance at something good. We don’t know how the system will work, maybe a slot machine, maybe it will be like Serums and be a guaranteed  effect but need hundreds of turned in legendary equipment, we don’t know. Just expect a new way to earn legendaries at about the same  rate as we where before, because they don’t want to make the old way obsolete,  and they certainly don’t want to end the gameplay loop by handing you and Instant win, Sextuple Mag, Quad-Shot The Dragon
---
Wouldn't you think there is some sort of compromise? Like punishing griefers with a debuff or something to discourage it. Quadruple the bounty for smashing camps and don't let friends/teamates take your bounty. One of the most requested features is faction warfare and smashing camps is a part of it. Not out here smashing your nice bases because I have no friends and want to be a dick
---
For PS4, I had to force close the application
---
Yeah having a bank to share between characters is deff in my top 3 QoL improvements needed, one of the many things I think they should carry over from ESO.
---
I love 76 but I do wonder what ZOS could have done with it if it was their project...
---
2 years ago.
---
Maybe.
---
Thanks.
---
youre not very smart are you
---
What is your or some of your friends' SN? I will be on tonight.
---
I play survival daily. Remember it's still in BETA and absolutely SUCKS atm
---
I want my other hand to point a V like a crosshairs before I Brady that bad boy.
---
None of these points even make sense, especially since no one is stopping you from moving to survival. Why arent you already tbh, no need to worry about slap damage or anything. 
---
Maybe its because someones "sack" is so small they dont want to lose aid.
---
Or use double enter between points to make things more clear.
---
Or having a 2.2 without a 2?
---
Yeah you'd be correct.
---
yeah there is like a 10-15 min respawn timer on em
---
This is rude
---
Thanks. I included the banding. I'll consider a separate Adrenal Reaction option later on; the other buff percentage can be used until then.
---
I don't fully understand what this means
---
Maybe with nuclear winter there will be more.
---
Thanks. I don't know how to compare energy and ballistic weapons yet so I haven't added such weapons to the mix.
---
Just remembered I'd actually posted a pic of it a while back (in an album of my old CAMP):
---
https://i.imgur.com/r3LvaLj.jpg
---
This was back at the beginning of February, so I'm not sure if anything's changed. I'll get a current pic later.
---
Wasn't trying to. I was simply stating the scale since most people's "factions" are 2 15 year olds with 56 caps between em
---
I tried to catch one of MODUS' KOVACS-MULDOON drops once in Watoga.  "I got it!  I got it!  I GOT IT!!"
---
I'd say somewhat
---
It's a great game if you never pvp
---
Oh shoot, I feel stupid. I was thinking of the "Welcome Home" sign, not the "Friends Welcome" sign.
---
Then do it on survival.  Easy solution!
---
Ah ok. I'll save the post n keep an eye out to see if u get it
---
It was a silly thing from a video. Some guys likening Hannah Baker’s dad to Shrek, IIRC. (The channel is Pretty Much It)
---
I have a friend whose nickname is Shrek and I used it as a joke with him. Even had another friend sneak the words onto his camp while he was away. So it’s just a silly thing to have.
---
You don't need a specific build to use power armor though. I have several PA perks, mostly from packs, but I equip exactly zero of them when I need to head into a nuke zone. I still manage just fine.
---
Thanks, incomplete Wiki about these weapons. Added.
---
Your a moron , please do quit
---
Laser weapons should be there as well.. I am most interested in those.
---
Laser rifle in particular is what I'm looking forward to compare with other mainstream weapons.
---
The roadmap has been updated whenever they have to move things. Cameras are coming out on the 23rd, and player vending comes on March 7th.
---
Just don't Gronk spike it!
---
I’m having this issue too. I’ve just restarted it so fingers crossed!
---
That build is awesome! How well does it fair against the sheepsquatch impostor?
---
K bye, we won't miss you, or your clan of trolls.
---
Oh, I like that sign. It's nice.
---
I'm at level 170ish, on PC. I've got a bunch of cards for nukes and I'm going to try to do a trifecta this weekend. If you're on PC and feel like doing a few silo runs add me, I'd be happy to have you! Same IGN as here
---
I was here for that. I actually pissed off the whitesprings once while that bug was in play. HORDES of robots after me all through the lobby and I raced for the secret enclave entrance.   
---
I have a video of it somewhere I think, I was streaming at the time.
---
You want some cheese to go with that?
---
They’ve never said they scrapped plans to do this. It’s been mentioned several times as something that was coming. If you and your group thought otherwise, you were misinformed.
---
whitesprings golf club or west tek is your best options..
---
login, kill golf club/west tek, server jump and repeat. dont wait around for respawns.   
---
although it seems bethesda is doing their best to kill any and all farming, respawn timers on mobs in dense areas. turning off legendaries in watoga. seems they keep trying to turn this into some kinda slow walk slog.
---
BGS just buffed turrets to make defending camps easier. That combined with not properly notifying you that your camp was under attack was a big part of the frustration. All I'm saying is there were alternative ways to handle this. They could make the bounty higher for destroying camps and not let your teamates or friends claim it. They could not let you destroy camps with 0 caps. They could have done something else to resolve the situation. I'm not out griefing people for sport. We are a faction that competes regularly with others and can't be bound to survival where we can't see anyone on the map. It's removing a whole element of the game and honestly one of the last few that I enjoy. In my opinion this is a change for the worse. In the opinion of innocent players who get their camps smashed by dickheads I understand where you're coming from. It's the way they went about it and how they are implementing it that are the issues for me.
---
Yup, no problem.  I've only laid waste to CAMPs that are literally right behind the club house lined with turrets.
---
At about L27, w/ power armor and a few radaways, you should be able to attempt a WS run.   There potential for legendaries is a lot better, but the groups of 5 L50+ ghouls are going to be difficult.  Not impossible, just difficult.  
---
If you dont want to do that, FT to WS, and immedialy go inside, downstairs and to the right.  lots of vendors.  Ckeck them for low level legendaries.
---
Check the vendors at train stations, as well as the green and blue suitcases, and the overseers cache.  Higher level players will often put their lower level stuff in them.
---
I have sold a lot of lower level legendary armor and weapons to vendors in the forest.
---
I bought one of my legendary rifles from a forest vendorbot for all of 240 caps.
---
First let me say, I'm not a lawyer. 
---
I \*think\* the recorded parties have to have a reasonable expectation of privacy for those "wiretapping" laws to be in effect. It could (and should, IMHO) be argued in a situation like this that no one transmitting their voices in a multi-player online game would have this protection.
---
1-3: Sincere thanks for this info. I better understand your issue with this now. Still, "faction warfare" seems pretty niche to me.
---
4: The griefer gets punished but so do I with time, resources, peace of mind, etc. Still, again, I see your point.
---
5: You lost me at "whiny little baby." I definitely wouldn't whine if somebody destroyed my camp, but it would piss me off, and I don't play games to be pissed off. Yes, it is a mechanic built into the game, but I'm glad they're getting rid of it.
---
None of this is personal. Thanks for answering me.
---
I stockpiled a boatload of three star rolling pins boxing gloves and walking canes on my mules just in case they don’t differentiate weapon types and treat all 3-star items the same. People dump three star garbage left and right, dirt cheap at vendors too. 
---
‘Here’s my my three star rolling pin could you hand me that three star explosive 50 cals please’ next month lol
---
Sorry. Just saw this. A two star Instigating Gatling Gun with explosive. May not seem like much, but it beats the hell out of the Bloodied Rolling Pin and Trapper's Wooden Legs I've been getting since Beta. ;-)
---
Outside was no better

Until you learn that the whole "Doomsday Clock" is only a scare tactic that has no other meaning.
---
That would edfinitely suck, if you were the uncle. But I'm still betting on him with his 999 tokens vs. mine with 1 just token.
---
It's the Mr. Cuddlesworth origin story.
---
Why it sucks? is the same as Adventure with less restrictions and more XP.
---
What sucks about it that makes you NEED to destroy camps in Adventure?
---
A super stim, I was almost dead and had no aid items and could not fast travel because some enemy some where was mad at me.
---
For comparison of course. It's just entries in the legendary table with modifiers and the page just calculates with them.
---
It’s permanently in the game. So you have time
---
This was a great FO4 mod. Didn't require power armor though.
---
Will you be home at 5:00 ET? That would work for me
---
Remember that miniature deathclaw in Old World Blues? He was ferocious!
---
Those enemies were spawned by a higher level character. You simply drew the short a raw, and I'm sorry that happened to you. 
---
The stuttering is an issue. With pc many find solutions in tweaking graphics settings to be handled more optimally. Though someone else would have to help you there as I am on console.
---
No, not yet. Maybe in the future once speed data can be obtained for the mods/effects/perks.
---
its Nick Valentine, pre-degradation. and apparently his memory was ctrl+c/ctrl+p. this kinda stuff doesnt happen when Liberty Prime is around! because sharing memories is like sharing *anything*: a red menance!
---
Did maps yesterday. They worked like normal with up to five (that's all I was willing to chance).
---
I'm looking for the answer now, as I have a 3* Vampiric Gatling Laser, and I'd like to know. Although to my knowledge there are NO Ultracite Gatling Legendaries, only regular Ultracite Laser Rifle Legendaries. So, for sure your Ultracite Gatling did more base damage?
---
*185 years
---
Woman here. First of all, I’m sorry you went through that. I’m glad you had support and that it didn’t deter you from continue to play. 
---
I don’t play with a mic but keep area chat on so I can hear. Then one day this lvl 222 guy (at the time I was lvl 150 I think) came running up to me and another player at white spring where I was helping this lower level player gain some xp. Asshat 222 (that’s not a tag, that’s just what I referred to him as) was on area mic screaming a nonstop barrage of obscenities and honestly just gross insults directed at me specifically. I had never seen this person in game, and had no idea why he was yelling. The other player and I were doing the “confused” emote while he continued to scream. For the first time in Fo76 I felt like I was being abused - not attacked, abused. That was one day before they implemented the in game report feature. 
---
I’m not easily rattled. But it upset me enough to turn off my area mic after that. Then I realized that I was letting this asshole control my gaming experience. So I turned it back on. Because if I ever encounter someone like that again, I want to know so I can report them and hopefully save other players from experiencing the same thing.  There’s game-related trash talk in every game. But there is a line where it becomes abuse and no one, regardless of gender, should ever feel like they have to endure that kind of behavior in game or otherwise. 
---
Also, thank you for posting about this!! I think people are afraid to speak up about this kind of thing. But this needs to be talked about more. It’s just going to continue if people don’t speak up. So thank you for sharing and staring this conversation!
---
Been playing for a month now. Adventure mode pretty much ignore other players and Im having a blast. Stash management is a bitch tho...
---
I'm not a raider. I don't destroy innocent ppl's camps. I actually help random players all the time. Faction warfare needs to take place in adventure unfortunately because we can't see anybody on the map in survival. If survival mode was decent enough to play we would be in there 100% of the time. But as of now that's not the reality. I am a trader as well and have been since launch. I built many trading posts but could always defend it because I was good at the game. Eventually the faction warfare confined me to my giant concrete temple and I'm happy with it. There were better ways to implement safety for camps but this wasn't it in my opinion. 
---
After giving it some thought I'm starting to thing this is Bethesda's response to an overwhelming number or reports of camp smashing.
---
I’ll play with you! I’m about level 80 and I usually give handouts.
---
Since I (like the madman above me) have hair that the entirety of Motley Crue would envy... it's fabulous.  That's why I'm slightly worried about the (don't run as admin) thing going on... Is this just for Fallout?  I'm modding Skyrim, and the ONLY way I can run my CK is if I do so as Admin.  I started getting that horrible error code, and after validating a couple dozen times but yielding \*\*\*\* results, I did some digging around and was told to try running it this way, and it worked.  I guess I'm just a little worried that the Phantom of the BethNet Launcher is gonna come back for my soul....  
---
AND MY HAIR  :-(

:headbangs:

TWO
---
MINUTES
---
TO MIIIIIIIIIIIIDNIIIIIIIIIIGHT
---
THE HANDS THAT THREATEN DOOM
---
TWO! MINUTES! TO MIIIIIIDNIIIIIIGHT!
---
TO KILL THE UNBORN IN THE WOOOOOOOOOOOMB!!!
---
Thanks man, appreciate it
---
The sledgehammer with an armor piercing head seems to do more damage than a super sledge, but it could just be for me because of my perks and mutations
---
I have only 5 points in charisma right now and I can share 3* nerd rage just fine. Adrenaline is the card I’m trying to share with (+)15 charisma stats.
---
I haven't seen it yet, but I already feel you on that.
---
In another, more cynical part if my heart, I want to know what's taking so long. A race of sentient beings willing to create, and use, something with that kind of destructive power, deserves to be eratticated. Cleanse the world in fire and let it start anew.
---
We're on the brink of the next mass extinction anyways.
---
Amazing tool. Can you add in crit calculators in the future? I would like to see what crits from a .44/western revolver with the crit perks look like compared to a AAE revolver.
---
During the weekend I noticed a few times non robotic legendaries were exploding when killed. Confused me but I simply laughed and said bethesda as I shook my head and continued playing.
---
I do this too because then they just assume you are a guy. I dont use mic either cause its annoying when i hear “ooooo a girl!”, followed by other comments
---
It's forever but I anticipate as time goes on less people may do it so it may become harder. People still do scorchbeast queen but you have much more time knocking her out of the sky. I'm grinding sheepsquatch in case the events become harder due to less interest in it later.
---
We play on survival daily, but since you can't see anyone on the map it makes it damn near impossible to make it work. Makes it super unrealistic and almost impossible to engage in warfare
---
I have my chat set to Team only, unfortunately, because I just don’t want to be bothered with this crap. I am sorry to all those peeps I ignore unintentionally who are being perfectly nice!
---
Personally I feel like they're both fine.
---
Read Watchmen by Alan Moore.
---
You realize that the Doomsday clock is just a bunch of people that vote on what time it should be set to and in know way reflects the actual tension or potential of conflict IRL?
---
Shhhhhh, i'm there too.
---
Bone hammer is as good, just doesn’t have legendary variants and has huge loading issues.
---
I have more than enough caps to afford any aid I could need for the next 10 years. You can't make faction warfare work in survival because nobody shows up on the damn map. Reminder that it's still in BETA and on the whole SUCKS. So it's not really a viable option
---
Im around 130 and i just started to respec my character to run full auto weapons and a 2 shot handmade auto sniper with mutations
---
Another [redacted] needs your help...
---
I'll mark it on your map
---
You use a mic when playing the game? In all my hundreds of hours playing this game I have encountered maybe 10 people ever using a mic, not one of them were females
---
/s ?
---
I love this response. It shouldn't have to happen, but this must feel nice to kill them over and over XD
---
Good point, I should get grinding, but I have like 50 of all 5 main fasnacht masks and I don't think I can give them away, I originally wanted them as bargaining chips and I just wonder if the rare sheepsquatch stuff is going to be the same after time...
---
As an avid mini nuke user I am against this idea, because all the free mini nukes I find in the watoga train station will be gone.
---
I like to wear an army helmet with the normal gas mask and wear the drifter outfit. It looks similar enough until bethesda gets the hint and adds actual riot looking armor so they can take my money...
---
I use it for a bathrobe after a nice decontamination shower...
---
It's not uncommon for us to take up a whole server. Fun fact - if you join a team of 4 from the main menu, then load into a world, it will load all 4 of you into an empty server you can fill up as you please with faction members and enemies
---
They perform ok generally.
---
You will have one terrible weakness, Snipers. 
---
Snipers can laser you quickly if you uncrouch or are visible in any way.
---
You’ll need the staggering if you want to fight sentinel cheese.
---
Usually I do but it wears down on me because it's pretty frequent and friends I've had for a while just turn into apes and get defensive and abrasive for no reason
---
Freezing/crashing/framerate drops have been an issue with all Fallout games. 76 still and will continue to have the same issues. If the teams from previous games never figured it out, there's not much hope this team will either.
---
The game is way more stable than the first 3 months but still issues. 2 freezes and a server not responding crash already today
---
I dont see the problem if he used his keycard and not yours
---
I'm a guy but sometimes play a female character (no role playing or anything it's just a habit for me to make a character of each sex because dialog used to vary between them in previous games). I've had a few people make unsolicited comments thinking I was a female and I always enjoy their reaction when they find out they're hitting on a guy. "Hey sexy". (In my deep unmistakably male voice)"Thanks man I do feel sexy I just trimmed my nose hair and took a huge dump." I like to think next time maybe they just won't say anything because they'd rather avoid being made an ass of on area chat.
---
I'm not selling mine either and have bought cheap 3-stars at vendors whenever I visit them. I don't have that many though as I'm not expecting this re-roll business to be stellar.
---
Here's the solution, if your camp is destroyed by a player you can repair it for free. Anything destroyed by NPCs costs materials. Not sure if you've ever heard the saying "griefers gon' grief" but I'm sure they'll find new ways to ruin people's days.
---
You on ye olde PS4?
---
I’m a girl and I always use mic. I’ve only ran into one other woman and she had a really loud baby in the background. Really bland personality and close to no communication. It was a let down. All my friends are dudes on here. It would be nice to run into another chick as into the game as I am.
---
When some dude is shitty to another player just cause they are a woman you really have to wonder what makes that dude tick. Obviously some huge self esteem issues. 
---
Rest easy knowing guys like that are not going to get far in life and their life  beyond Fallout is basically nonexistent.
---
I will say that I had a birthday bash at Whitesprings station the other day and of the 30 or so people that stopped by the ones who gave me stuff were 75 percent women. Or at least guys with female characters. 
---
One guy came by and saw the party and started hurting my base but he got wanted and was quickly put down. I'd assume he was the type to say something horrible to a  woman just trying to enjoy her damn hobbies.
---
Humm yeah that could be a problem.
---
About the staggering that's the reason I'm thinking about heavy guns. But it's one 3% more than my rifles. Don't know if worth it. I may stick with my stealth sniper
---
I dont think you should be able to throw them, but instead spike them. Throwing them makes the Fat Man obsolete beyond obsolete, but spiking them is a fair balance, while also being a hilarious gag.
---
Yup psn: Arczikens
---
I created a thread discussing my challenge in taming animals and sending them to my camp. 
---
I successfully have sent a total of 9 different animals to my camp. Of those 9, 5 never made it to my camp and the other 4 were killed by either other players or by enemy attacks on my camp. 
---
The two that bothered me the most were the Hulking Mega Sloth, who was killed by a player walking by and the other was my Glowing Mirelurk King who was also killed by two players. 
---
I also had a glowing rabid wolf that was killed by scorched. 
---
It took me about 30-40 server jumps to get those animals and for now, I have given up on the challenge as it is simply a waste of time unless the pets can be deemed “essential” and this non-killable by players or the environment. 
---
The Brahmin that is part of our Fertilizer extractor is how camp dedicated pets should work. They are respawnable and do not cost the player time or caps to replace or maintain.
---
Thanks again for the details. I've updated the page and it should now calculate more accurately (still there is the 146 - 147 difference issue I can't pinpoint).
---
It was never an issue with fallout 1 and 2, 3 was pretty stable, not on newer systems.
---
76 has become worse on my end than on release.
---
Lets say you use 1 stimpack a day, there are 365 days in a year, and 10 years.
---
Thats 3680 days, assuming each stimpack is 8 caps. Thats more that 25000caps, meaning its more than cap. So maybe you dont have enough caps for aid for 10 years, but I get your point.
---
 You will still be able to destroy camps in Adventure if the pacifist mode of the attacked player is OFF, if the pacifist mode is ON you need to respect and move on to another Camp...
---
Wait tamed? What how
---
I have to manually reload too. Once I empty clip it doesn't auto reload. Really annoying
---
ok thanks - that makes sense with how you can't vats friendlies anymore... but you would think that once the guys shoots me like 5 times he would turn red hahah - sounds like I have to get a shot back on them first maybe?  I think that may be how it works - thank you this is very helpful...
---
Ironically I turn on every radio I see
---
Stay in the Forest and Toxic Valley areas until 15-20. Ash, Savage Divide, the Mire, then Cranberry Bog in order of difficulty.
---
The Main Quest is not a run until done right at the start. Do some, level up, do some more, level up, etc.....
---
I want to be like a Super Mutant Suicider. That would literally be my entire PvP tactic.
---
Because you can't see people on the map and the restrictions are brutal. Warfare becomes who can hang out at a train station the longest or "move your camp on top of a mountain and shoot down". Constant trips to the stash box for aid. Everybody stashes their caps before heading into survival. It's a bloody mess. (pun intended)
---
You are right. it will be abused. Seriously. They are people. They spend a great amount of time combing reddit for good posts, feedback, bug reports and more. 
---
They don't need a bot that tags them, as we can already tag them ourselves.
---
They do a way better job than the mods of this thread in knowing what is going on. 
---
The real thing would to get people to be better posters, but that's never going to happen.
---
Go drunk bro, you are home
---
Read above comments regarding faction warfare. Not out here smashing random camps for sport
---
that would be sweet.
---
if you mean passive mode lol I definitely wasn't in passive mode... I had just killed another wanted player...
---
My theory is it I'd actually an already depleted core you ejected before you finished the full run. So when you loaded it the next time it said it was full but was really just 50 shots left....I think.
---
I was clarifying that this wasn't just me and some 15 year old calling ourselves cool
---
Girl here: Yeah I stay off mic until I end up in a group. It just avoids problems. Most guys are normal decent folks.. But it only takes one *child* to hear you and cause an issue. 
---
I am curious what platform you're on, since it sounds like you've been getting it pretty bad.
---
A lot of things are commonplace without having value -- ranting and raving on subreddits is one of them.  
---
I do believe valuable items come out of reddit feedback posts, but I think they are heavily offset by the sheer volume of toxic, inflammatory and nonconstructive posts that flood the front page by the same 1000 people every day.  
---
I said suggestions and feedback are valuable, but when there's too much noise its just as hard to hear as when there is too little.
---
I saw a guy in my camp with hotrod xo1
---
No, there are definitely plans for all the different mod variants for all the different PA suits. I dont buy mods outright, I only buy plans because I'm the blacksmith of my group of friends. I've had the same problem for weeks now, I have the components and plan for headlamps, they just dont equip when I try to craft them. Same with optimized servos, calibrated shocks, rusty knuckles, optimized bracers, etc. I've attempted to find new PA suits and see if my suit was bugged, it's not. I've not been able to build anything for any PA since the Fasnacht patch, excluding atomic shop skins. At least I'm camo so I can spend the next year hiding and waiting to finally build the mods I need...
---
I saw that part, I am curious what part of that is Adventure exclusive. Why can you not do all of that in Survival. What about 'survival sucks' is hampering you?
---
Pay me 500 and I'll take it off your hands
---
I understand that. But wouldn't you agree there is possibly another solution? Possibly punishing the griefers or making PvP camp damage free to repair? It's a part of the game that we have adapted into our gameplay style. It's hard to stick with a game when they keep changing the way you play it in a major way.
---
I thought that too, but if you look in your inventory you'll see partially depleted plasma cores. I have some that have around a 90% charge, and that corresponds to when I'm firing the gun and all of a sudden the ammo dumps and I reload. 
---
If you look on the ammo meter, you'll see it go from X number of shots to 0 when this happens (acting like you used it all up) but you'll still seem to have partially used cores in your inventory.
---
Behold, the thread of the white knights.
---
Mostly stoked for the CAMP foundation changes!
---
That's the point. I've been hanging on by a thread. But now logging in to see weekly challenges for a camera that doesn't exist yet, completing a quest to drink a beer from an alcoholic robot, and having effects, perks, mutations, and more broken and rebroken over and over again I think I'm honestly finally done.
---
This is wild!! Lol
---
Cant wait!
---
Coming from someone who doesn't know the difference between your and you're I don't take much offense from this.
---
Yes that would be awesome
---
May, friend.
---
GT?
---
Troof
---
If you want someone to tell you a joke then saying they are oppressed doesn't win them over for future reference.
---
Ya I hope they fix this soon
---
Speaking from personal experience, this stuff will haunt you.
---
If you don’t have your build planned out at level 5+, careless choices are made in terms to stats and perks.
---
The respec system is pretty bad right now, as it takes 2 levels to move one stat and get one perk after level 50.
---
I had an unplanned rifle build that I attempted to change to melee.
---
Levels 40-97 were spent on trying to fix that, and the mistakes stemmed from the first couple of levels.
---
Kinda changing your focus. But that would be expected when your opinion is recieved so negatively. 
---
If you quit, good luck. If you don't, then ill see you around.
---
Well just redownloded the entire game and it is still doing the same thing
---
There already is a solution called survival mode.
---
I love ppl who make their reddit name the same as their gamertag ;)
---
yeah the update to friends list is really annoying.. i would rather see whos online than to have to dig through people offline to find the party invite someone sent me..
---
I have 7-8 levers and they all stay there and work
---
QcMastakilla88
---
Super unrealistic? How .... last I checked our military does not have a pipboy with a map showing everyone’s location
---
ALMOST AS IF DIFFERENT PEOPLE HAVE DIFFERENT OPINIONS
---
Did it sit on your pillow?
---
Ahhh ok ive been playing like i usually do fallout and focus on the main quest but i guess that makes a lot more sense.
---
Thank you :D
---
Pm..? I’m interested as well lol
---
Yeah, it's super misleading too, because rad resist legendary prefixes are essentially useless then as well. Unless they make each legendary item per slot have 1/5 of the invisible perk, everyone is going to reroll those as soon as the legendary vendor comes out.
---
You are the reason we get rads when crossing a stream.
---
I have a auto pipe rifle sniper build with wood armor, and those people with the heavy guns never get close to me.
---
The only thing I can be killed by are the legacy laser shotgun rifles.
---
No, because pip boys don't exist. They do however have radar and sonar and drones and a ton of other tech to spot enemies and their locations. So you're kinda wrong..
---
Joining now
---
Wow way to turn a civil discussion into "git gud n00b". You're the kind of person that makes people hate PVP in any game. You don't get to tell someone else how to enjoy the game their way.
---
I'd like to be able to attach a floor piece directly to a foundation, is that possible?  currently I had to run stairs up, to a floor, and then back down to another, and then that one I could build to connect to the original foundation.
---
I have to say as a woman, I've been lucky tbh I've not met anyone on f/o who has said anything mean because I'm a woman. But don't let them get to you. Some people are idiots but if you ever want to roam the waste land with a lass who's got your back feel free to add me beejay1308
---
 Go to those specific subs and search crash/frame rate drop and you will see it was an issue. Im a fan and have played every game. Not hating, just have to except that the series has some issues and 76 was built with that same engine
---
There are no X-01 Calibrated Shocks Plans.  Only the Mod exists.
---
Yeah hah, they want us to be a community in the game but if you fall prey to the naming gods, and your account doesn't start with one of the earlier letters of the alphabet you're lost in a sea of names. 
---
Feel bad for xX_Pussy_Slayer_Xx really.
---
Shoot them or something!
---
And not being able to see ppl on the map. Can't have a camp cus someone needs to be moving theirs constantly. The cap reward for killing was way too high and is now way too low. The aid dropping is still a mess. Constantly running to the stash when you die for more stuff. It's just headache after headache
---
You’re telling me all of those holotapes in the jukebox don’t have any songs from Appalachia radio? We should be able to choose whichever songs we want played from it, it’s a jukebox.
---
From what they've said it applies to everyone unless they shoot back at you which means nobody will EVER shoot back.
---
are you in the game? what's ur gt
---
I play on PS4. I will gladly team up and help you make these players days miserable, any way I can. There is no room for this. I want nothing more than to see this community stay pure, responsible, and compassionate to one another. My gamertag is Hownny. Feel free to add me. 
---
P.S. please dont drop your mic. Some of us are respectful and enjoy hearing about your perspective on this game.
---
What is you platform
---
This needs to happen.
---
Nah that’s great dude nice drop for sure
---
My wife and I used to play this game a lot, and people would always follow her around and harass her, it was pretty obnoxious and I feel bad for people that it happens to.
---
1 cap to 1000 if you find the right person. People only want 3 star explosive gear. Regular 2 shots arent very exciting.
---
I don't know why "Nay thee" cracks me up so much but it's way more hilarious than no u
---
Checked it out last night with a friend... We both really liked the environment itself.  Very Metro-like.  Only problem was that aside from the one assaultron, the only enemies were lvl.1 Eyebots.  Didn't see a single ghoul.  On the upside, many of those eyebots were legendary and it was hilarious collecting loads of lvl.1 legendary gear.  Made me wish I had a new character to use it.   If that happens again, I'll drop it at the overseer camp instead of vendoring it to Wallace.
---
You can tell that just by looking at at in the store, nowhere close to how the welcome home sign looks.
---
Put "8PM EDT to [your timezone]"
---
in google.
---
Before I never crashed. Now I crash and freeze more often. The game still shutters with the pip boy light on.
---
I bet you I could throw this fat boy right over them mountains.
---
A lot of that going round. Sorry fam :(
---
Just saying when I play survival I don’t have much issue finding players... I don’t have an issue with camps being able to be destroyed but don’t destroy my camp for no reason. If I did something to the other player then fine find me and it is what it is.
---
Arc Survival Evolved - has dinosaurs and what-not. Brutal game to start out in and try to live for any amount of time. In all seriousness, you and your friends might get a kick out of it.
---
Haha anytime, you're welcome 😊
---
It’s a pain the ass though, I’m at about 50% success rate with it.
---
Exactly. Every game has a few problems.
---
Bunny ears...
---
Have had the same problem as you in Lewiston and the excavator quest - a high level had been through, and I got my butt whipped by high mutants.  Came back a lot of levels later, L6 scorched....
---
Still havent finished roses quest or all of the mysteries quest.
---
And I just cleared the buring mine locker quest Tuesday night...and I'm L63.
---
No problem. 
---
Remember to  talk to that guy that offered to data mine values. I'm sure it'll prove useful. 
---
Keep up the good work.
---
Some builds are severely hampered or just unworkable in Power Armor, though. Fist-type weapons don't work in PA and the arm mods for unarmed in PA are extremely poor and were just copied directly from Fallout 4 with no rebalancing, and any build that makes heavy use of VATS will run down Fusion Cores REALLY fast.
---
Lol, not sure what your point is, but you are wrong, too many trolls like you on reddit for that shit. Anyways I thought you were leaving? Done with your temper tantrum so soon?
---
Well, now that’s stuck in my head.
---
I buy stims for 8, turn each into 5 diluted with chemist and super duper. I use about 10 diluted per day as a bloodied build since dying is easier and PvP cap drain is about the same cost as a damn stimpack anyway now in survival. So call it 2 stims per day which is 16 caps per day budget. That's 5,840 per year and 58,400 caps over 10 years. I made 75k profit last week alone trading maybe 6 items. This is very sustainable even if you double the amount of stims I use. If I never traded again and just bought stims I could actually last about 30 years. So you were correct that I was wrong.
---
Poor oversight but the team.
---
Lol. I knew it, you just sounded like a Molly type of girl.  I'm fifty-nine, so i guess you can forgive me for calling you a girl!  Imo, yours is the best, most practical advise for O.P. and all women gamers to deal with this problem in this whole thread. I know my granddaughter doesn't take any crap from boys or grown men when she has those headphones on. Very vocal, just like her papaw. (and her mom)
---
I realized earlier R3 or L3 on ps will hold the object in place and you can move around it
---
Neon has itself is red colored. The other optional colors are from blending different gasses. I think argon is the one that's blue. I don't recall exactly. I work in the sign industry, but I'm not a glass blower. I've installed and wired it, plenty , and from conversing with my older peers over the years I learned that neon burns red. But all glass tube lighting done in that method is referred to as "neon"
---
So that is what happened to my playground stash.
---
As someone who has been dabbling in unarmed, I would be happy to get anything with extra attack speed or double damage on first hit.
---
1 hand this would give them more of a use on the other this is a terrible idea
---
We're farther away from global Armageddon right now than we have been at almost any time since the 60's (China may be inching us a bit closer, though that is rather debatable).  The doomsday clock has been a meme (and an inaccurate one) since it's inception.
---
Probably ANti armour, swing speed, and power attack damage
---
That depresso espresso's me since I have the rest of the armor and wanted the helmet. I'm on PS4
---
This is actually correct in several states. Only one party needs to be aware that the recording is taking place, from a legal standpoint. Otherwise, if the offending party knew they were being recorded, would they repeat the offense? It's like people who believe the police can't lie about being law enforcement. It's a myth.
---
Does it still break with max weapon protect cards on after 1 core is used? Haven't been on a while to test.
---
My wife doesn’t ever use her mic, she feels the same way.
---
I'm a lady with a deep voice. I don't play with a mic because I don't see the need to (though I do keep one handy for trades, just in case.) I almost always play alone and rarely interact with other players.
---
In other games, though, I just stopped using a mic altogether because it wasn't worth it. Mics are exhausting and while I haven't gotten harassed in a while, I did get more than enough "omg a gurl" or "is that a dude?" (though sometimes it can be funny if they do it in an ironic, but creative way--ie. "Girls don't go on the internet".)
---
You just keep doing you, my man. People will be dumb. Don't feel like you have to be on mic if you don't want to, but don't feel like you have to be off mic either
---
Shit, yeah.
---
Moreso just adding more details to explain the frustration building. I didn't expect my opinion to be well-received. This sub is the reason for pacifist camps in the first place so I knew nobody would agree with me. Kinda like being a republican in today's society. You're not allowed to have an opinion unless you have 100 trolls screaming behind you.
---
Hey same, if you could, PSN is Swatguy123456
---
I have a mic that has a physical mute button. If i'm playing by myself I dont really use the mic at all, but when i'm out with friends I tap the mute if I feel its needed.
---
But yeah, the best thing to do with guys like that is to walk away. Or, if it gets bad, change servers. I've only had a couple of guys decide they then want to PM me on my xbox account but they just get blocked. Ignoring/not replying is the best way to handle that kind of attention. Showing them any kind of attention is just adding fuel.
---
I need to jump on and claim today’s egg then.
---
Oh so if you can't spy on people on the map it's too hard for you? Get the fuck outta here with that crap. You sir need to sack up and deal with real consequences in survival.
---
They were the only ones dumb enough to make it out of pure lead? LOL
---
There's actually a specific permission for not allowing your voice to be shared via recording, so having that disabled implies consent. Legally.
---
There actually is a wendigo they just released too
---
That's a bat
---
Ironically enough I have the game but never played it because everybody said you could work really hard building a base and then random dicks would come destroy it.
---
Doesn't seem to work in firefox for me. I can choose ranged, but it does not show the dropdowns. Works fine in chrome for me. I tried making sure noscript is off on the page and adblock was off, but no change.
---
How do you know??
---
Right over them mountains!
---
The oldest thinks fallout is for nerds, but plays Fortnite and Minecraft 😂😂 oh the irony.
---
Amazing
---
Cuz it's a jukebox. And jukeboxes play installed music. Not radio stations.
---
When did they say they would never make camps unattackable? Do have a link?
---
ColonelBiggles
---
No it dosen't break fast anymore lol
---
Seems like someone needs to transfer to Rust
---
We are looking for specific players. In survival it turns into "Hey enemy faction leader, where are your camps so we can have a war?" "Oh it's here. You're gunna have to fast travel to this station and then walk 20 mins to find us, move you camp here so you can respawn close, and then we will war!"
---
It fucking blows
---
A couple options:
---
Don't use your mic
---
Get a voice changer
---
Stop caring so much
---
Or, I guess you could post on reddit and draw even more attention to the matter
---
Well, this prove my point above, if they dont shoot back they dont want to engage PVP, so there´s no reason to destroy the camp.
---
That's definitely debatable, they've fixed like 98% of the major bugs with this game and fix alot with each update
---
&gt; We are looking for specific players. In survival it turns into "Hey enemy faction leader, where are your camps so we can have a war?" "Oh it's here. You're gunna have to fast travel to this station and then walk 20 mins to find us, move you camp here so you can respawn close, and then we will war!"
---
&gt; 
---
&gt; It fucking blows
---
Don't you use different chemicals inside to give it's own color?
---
People are what they are and the way you came about it is respectful but to be told I ain't entitled to shit when I never said anything about entitlement caused the asshole to rise up. Whatever you pay money for should work the way it is described to work and if something doesn't the customer has a right to complain. So thank you for explaining the situation. Me personally, I be happy if they took the game offline for a week and just fixed the core issues. Then add all the bonus content. This is my first fallout game and have been told not to judge the series on it. The storyline is great, let's make the game play live up to that.
---
The devs said it in a post after the last update. Said it was scrapped.
---
The folks over at vault-tec could cram a radio receiver into the pip boy, but theres nowhere for it to fit inside those enormous jukeboxes
---

---
Is this "Rust" a better version of fo76? If so please inform
---
Yeah I'll do that. Thanks for all the info man
---
Nah man, slap on some Levi's and Hail Mary that fucker like Favre.
---
Ok, understand that now. Next question on why you hate this. Are you doing faction wars against people who have pacifist on? Because if they have it off, then their camp can still be destroyed.
---
I'm a gay male and I've had a repeated troll create several new accounts now harassing me on the communities when I try to sell something, in a very aggressive, vulgar manner. I rarely have a chance to respond before several of the other members climb down their throat, before they get banned (if the mod is actually paying attention that day). So, while I know that the vulgarity is a frequent occurrence, it's just the vocal minority. The silent majority is kind of like a sleeping Yao Guai. Fun to admire, and a vicious animal when you wake them up.
---
I try and stay very much up todate and I never saw that. Seems your familiar with it, can you link and support your claim with facts?
---
Or it could be another faction leader being a troll and wasting our time. For people who want more engaging and exciting content, this is the fast track in the opposite direction
---
Serious question:  When did Bethesda say that they weren't going to make Pacifist camps a thing?  I spend way too much time on this subreddit and I don't recall that being said.  All I recall was them saying that they were going to do it, but not until a later update.  
---
Do you have a cite for them saying the idea was scrapped?
---
Look it up. I trust you can figure it out.
---
Aye, there's multiple Survival server instances.  My friends and I had to server hop last night because there was a level 15 literally cheating (invulnerable, couldn't target in VATS at all, was instantly teleporting to various locations on the map, including disabled fast-travel points), took a few tries but we found one.
---
You’ve placed 8??
---
Why do you have to make this a party thing? Like there wasnt a reason. And your opinion may be more well recieved if you didnt insult my sack(imho my sack is fairly well sized, not that its any of your business you perv)
---
Opinions are okay, being obnoxious and starting drama where you are sharing it. Is not.
---
No one here is trying to take your opinion away from you.
---
Maybe just blame it on party differences again, im sure that'll work.
---
I just don't own a mic and most the time every body calls me "he" Or "him" I don't really mind tho because I like to avoid being harrased.
---
Not if they don't shoot back. So the leader can just sit there not on a team and watch a war unfold around them and take no camp damage. How are you supposed to send a message to someone with that restriction?
---
Probably a bad architect based on your username /s
---
The robot helmets look pretty good with it
---
Sorry for the jerks. I hope you’re able to stay on mic as you want. I’d have your back, but am on PC. Recoding and reporting does the world a favor, but it’s not your job to clean up the world. Good luck.
---
I don't mean radio, I mean rock tracks and big band music tracks.
---
Mine already are.  Not going to deny a thirsty wastelander a glass of water😁
---
I started off melee, played with different guns, I favor the 50 cal now even not in power armor.. the only things I really like pa for are heavily armored.. scorch queen and robo squatch really.  The only time I have trouble really is pvp at long range.  Just a little too much muzzle jump to stay on them
---
A general lack of discipline. When I was growing up, lord help my rest end if my mom ever even THOUGHT I had behaved inappropriately towards anyone, especially a female. Even as a gay male now, I still have a reverence for females over males. That's just the way things used to be, not sure when this polarization occured.
---
No worries. just add me I'm online
---
Thank you, you know what I'm saying.
---
I stay off for this reason. Plus, I am usually in a party with my brother, but I don't need someone harassing me so I just wave and pass by.
---
Noice. I might study up on that a bit.

---
Bethesda isn't fun enough to implement that...or are they. Accept the challenge!!!!
---
5% upvoted and 74 comments means literally EVERYBODY is trying to take my opinion away from me.

I found an apt description of that, "Recreational Outrage"

If you are on PC, I can craft you one for free. People selling them for 500 caps when it's a glorified gas mask is criminal.

No  Shishkebab? I was tryng to figure if is better than the bastet sword if it have AA

Thanks for the offer, but I'm on PS4!
---
Was it a brand new copy?
---
Anti-armor with incisor and fire axe spikes should be max armor pen I think. Pick it up with swing speed and +1 str for the best rolls
---
Thumbs up for menu location sir. We we're looking everywhere lol
---
AA would be good, but I love my instigating. It one-hits a lot, and especially if you also get a sneak attack in. For super tanky enemies, my AA melee works a bit better typically
---
With my copper lined suit!
---
Ye. It’s real good on sniper types if you can stay hidden. Tesla’s are good as well.
---
pretty sure its unarmed weapons only, punches, powerfists, deathclaw gauntlets, and so on
---
No. I wasn't sure if it mattered or not. Is there a way I can purchase it separately?
---
ok thank
---
You mad kat it's right there! 🙊
---
Glad to help
---
Didn't know that. I'll test it today. Thanks man
---
Imagine if people could also snipe the nuke like you could with a Super Mutant Suicider. The PvP battles if this was a thing...
---
Lewisburg Legendaries
---
if there was a timer that restricted you from doing anything but having a black screen for like 2 to 3 minutes while blacked out, I would actually consider this plausible.
---
Yeah if it wasn’t new the code is void. If not mistaken you can buy the tricentennial pack in the Microsoft store. Looks like it’s just the base content.
---
Off of the xbox store yes.
---
That's exactly what was causing it for me. It stopped once I burned through all my partial cores.
---
I’ll block for you
---
I think what you are trying to say is that your  shop talk, picking on your male friends, is received more poorly when in the presence of a female, most likely because your male friends feel the need to impress a female that they have never met and likely never will. It's just a case of ego, and it's hilarious that others have taken this to mean that you are harassing the females and feel the need to berate you.
---
I wish I was a civilian again. I'm stuck in the army still for a little bit longer.
---
Yeah another guy just told me about that. I'll stay if my rifles. Thanks. Anyway man
---
This would be so great!!

You shared your opinion in a public domain. Just because its not well recieved doesnt mean that we are taking it away. 
---
Feel free to stand with your opinion. Im not going to stop you, in fact. I support opposing opinion, tends to keep things more fair than if there wasnt one.
---
Not sure on Xbox but you can buy it separately for $20 on PS4. I assume it would be similar on Xbox though.
---
Lol yeah I love it! Hit me up whenever
---
I have an 3* Executioners +40% power swing damage and reflects 50% of damage when blocking it gets the job done nicely. 
---
Though I will say I personally like Instigating effects better. 
---
Extra swing speed is awesome Bloodied is also nice but the health trade off can lead to a lot of deaths if you don't run the right perks 
---
Adrenal Reaction mutation + Bloodied = max damage.
---
Yea if anything it gives people a second chance before selling garbage for cheap, so at least we have an option soon. People will complain no matter what lol.
---
This guy raids lol
---
No, it was failed humorous sarcasm because of the number of these posts I have seen.
---
I love the survival challenges but we really need more stash space to keep these. That is all.
---
Most of my buddies that served got good jobs when they made it out , good job training. Thanks for your service.
---
But a good architect
---
Same.
---
That's kinda sad tbh, there's barely any people on vc in the first place, so I really hope you meet some people in game that aren't assholes. As in my experience, the friends you meet in game are always more fun to play with than your real friends (since they're already more invested).
---
As for annoying kids, I too have lots of fun messing with them when they refuse to stop attacking me :)
---
Absolutely, PSN is ColonelBiggles
---
For the rare items you mean? If that's the case that should still keep them rare enough to make them desirable
---
Pre-nerf? Why?
---
Look for tf1439 drinkinbuddy mine is gofukyurslf326 I'll be back on sat

I agree. I just picked it up 2 days ago. I had been interested in DayZ for quite a while, but my PC could never run it. I heard it was on Xbox but I never really looked into it. I finally bought it, put a few hours into it, and was quite disappointed. There is literally nothing to do in the game besides look for your next food source. 
---
I was excited when I heard about fo76 but then quickly got discouraged when I started hearing of bugs and glitches. I finally took the plunge after reading some positive things in this sub.  
---
I'm happy with the game and wish I got it before DayZ. I'm only at level 10 but I really have no complaints. Sure, there's no NPCs but I don't miss them and the phrases they repeat ad nauseum. I'm enjoying the quests and exploring, and finding the perfect spot for my camp. I even ran back to camp once to see another player using my weapons bench. We waved at each other and he scampered off. Very cool.
---
We have a crew of Aussies who use the Discord channel Fallout 76 AU. Feel free to jump in.

You can add me on your friends' list too. IGN = Mirelurk
---
I have the opposite issue, usually there are so many people trying to talk it gets hard to listen quickly lol. Also on PS4. OnlineID is Seminandis, we usually have a party up, if the silence gets too intense for you.
---
Maybe I read it wrong, but I thought it said 'Pacifist mode will extend to camps' so if you don't have pacifist mode on, it will still be like it is now.
---
just: mimimi
---
I know! Felt silly after. We scrolled right but not left on the deathclaw 🤣
---
Once again as a young person. I speak my mind on suggestive shit. ONLY IN PERSON. I respect females. It's just the shit they wear. I rarely see females cause of the sad sick fuckers who get off on bullying the other gender. Stop seeing females as a sex object n shit. We're all human girls deserve respect too. I never disrespect a female or use the word bitch unless she really pisses me off. I respect females.
---
That's the solution! Capture an entire survival server and play search and destroy.
---
As a faction, you can certainly arrange with your opponents and define some rules.
---
Isn´t it more fun when campsites are not obvious? Isn´t it more fun when you actually have to search for your opponents and do not find them right away?
---
Make yourself "scenarios". Fight for camp venture. Conquer a workshop. and much more.
---
The way you describe your faction warfare sounds very boring to me.
---
Look at the map and see where players are, port in the nearby area, wait until he leaves and then destroy his camp. Great faction fight
---
Just defeating that 🐑 imposter...
---
Shouldn't matter , no matter how high of a level, good people are good people, bad people are bad people .
---
Haha it is a bit confusing. I went through everything myself when it wasn't where I thought it'd be...Process of elimination 1 Bethesda 0. 😂😂
---
It does not deserve all the bad hype it had. I'm glad to see ppl are coming around because it's a fantastic game
---
Sorry that has happened to you, I have a few female friends and I'm just not sure where this behavior focuses, if PS4 groups people of a certain age and mindset together somehow. If you want any friends, make or female, that don't tolerate stuff like that and are on PS4 add me. I'll introduce you to some decent people.
---
Online ID Seminandis
---
I heard about that. I'm just going to stream games, draw art, work on my series, and build computers from home.
---
No problem.
---
Edit: thanks for the gold kind stranger!
---
Me and my friend RRIOT launched our first nuke. Was disappointed cause my caps stash alert went off and I couldn't find the stash. RRIOT wanted to launch but I had it prepped and ready. So in honor. I had him mark a spot on the map and nuke it. (It was Whitesprings before the patches) And we farmed and got XP and Loot
---
What’s ur ign I’ll add soon
---
Maybe it's a doomsday clock representing how long in game to the appacalypse? Perhaps a grim foreshadowing of events to come in game.
---
Great post BTW
---
Just check the DATA tab on Pip-Boy.
---

Thank you 😊
---
Most of the toxic people are hormonal preteens and teenagers, from what I've seen. Ran into one or two older ones, but most are just full of testosterone and angst. The super young ones, like 8-14, are actually really nice and just want people to play with that won't pick on them for having high pitched voices.
---
Eeeee I found you!!  Thank you for the compliments!  You are a super solid teammate to have all the time, not just when things get dicey.  I feel like most men could take an example out of your book as to how to just exist and be a good person in a team, regardless of gender. 
---
PS, let's go play!
---
That was me if you were on PC.
---
You mean the imposter outfit?
---
It’s shite move. But it’s a dog eat dog world.
---
Bottom left corner of your pip boy, I believe either on the Stat or Data screen.
---
It as adds another dynamic to the game that you can't get by being attacked by AI. In PvP, which does still happen on adventure, CAMPS are tactical decisions with defenses. The turrets shooting at me because I'm wanted certainly isn't "nothing."
---
*thumbs up*
---
Can any xboxxers here craft it? I need it to complete a look
---
If you want to run with our group let me know, I’m on Xbox here, there’s a few women in our group.
---
Concrete foundation?
---
I think the whitesprings thing is far, but burrows and the like should be instanced
---
I personally think whoever launches the nuke should get the experience for every ghoul killed in the zone and be able to loot all bodies as if they tagged them.
---
This would be highly abusable of course.  But right now there's not much incentive to run through a silo just for everyone else to reap the benefits and yoink kills.
---
You should be able to catch them if you are in power armor as well.
---
Bad mouthing is bad, the paper bag stealing is fine. Your fault.
---
Seriously the DATA tab? Well shit. I looked all over that thing. Thank you for the information!
---
I've been very lucky, it seems. I mostly stay off mic but have talked to a few guys i've traded with and have never received any abuse. I'm so sorry this happened to you. I know how it would make me feel and could ruin the game for some of us. I have a huge appreciation for men who can meet a woman in a game and treat her like a human being.
---
I totally agree with this too.  I stated in a reply above that some people aren't comfortable with this and that's ok.  It just really sucks that the small few that blow are keeping you from meeting so many wonderful people.
---
It can take a few server hops but Lucky hole is definitely the best I've found.  It can alternatively be radroaches, rad rats or mole rats but if ants are spawning outside then they will spawn inside as well.  Plenty of ant meat if using butcher's bounty and the best location for doing the "kill radants while drunk on radant lager" challenge since you don't have to race a deathclaw to the kill or drink multiple bottles to kill enough.
---
Hey there, another married guy in his 30s here. Most of my friends don't play fallout, mind if I jump in on this?
---
Thanks. So 1am for UK.  Cheers Bethesda!
---
The paper bag was just the final insult.
---
Awesome, still want the time on my PA HUD though, thank you.
---
Lmao OP may be a weirdo but that 4th bullet point was probably one of the cringiest things Ive ever read oof
---
I am on Xbox as well, we seem to have gotten the short end of the stick it seems.
---
Np. I had the same problem. Now I just look at the sky for indication.
---
I got X-01 with T-60 legs and calibrated shocks, crazy carry weight and good in nuke zones. Use excavator or the mining perks.
---
Hmmm interesting. I'd assume they would let players damage structures as a use for repair kits.  If a player broke my decon station, I'd rather use a repair kit than having to go farm the mats needed to repair. Can someone answer this: are you able to still break players structures in survival?
---
But it is up for 24hrs, so there is plenty of time in the day :)
---
Because they made a mistake and forgot about the daily challenges when they pushed back the camera release.
---
I wish they would show the current time on the map.
---
Play survival, avoid others.  The 25% boost makes a big difference.  That is the only thing I would add to your strategy.  Oh be sure to leave your junk &amp; aid stuff behind.
---
Is her real or just myth?
---
No game is perfect, so all games need criticism. How else would the industry move forward (or get better) without it. Fallout 76 needs it and it should keep getting it, as long as it pushes it in the right direction.
---
You have to get into vats range to shred me. My armor ensures it as I will be hopping to counter stagger, I will also be spamming nuka quantum for ap. My perception is also the highest the game will allow, so I'll see you first
---
I didn't suggest instancing Whitesprings, I suggested the Burrows, which already needed it, imo. Instancing Whitesprings would be impossible.
---
If it was hsed then it was probably the same price as a used standard edition. All you got was a different case.
---
Bit of advice for the future: used games almost NEVER come with the deluxe edition bonuses.
---
Favre wears Wrangler jeans like a real man.
---
No specific quests. Mid-to-late game 3 of the 4 factions have mentions or direct evidence. Outside of the game, the official art book has them titled pretty obviously too. 
---
Not sure how far into the game you are, but pay attention to quantities and locations while you're on quests specifically.  Look back at sightings after finishing certain quests too.
---
Wonder if they are invincible to nukes ?
---
Tbh. I’m all for first come first serve. And if people are going be scum. Sadly that’s their choice. Quite a few times I’ve seen people deploy their PA ago block the door ways to the club. So for a whole 60 you just get to sit there and listen to legendary ghouls die that you will never see.
---
Yes make it a legendary power armor piece.... call it the QP power armor arm piece

---
Dunno. But I do know this: Daisycutter blows goats. You vats it and it has no percentage of a hit unless you get close enough to blow yourself up. Maybe I'm using it wrong, but....
---
Just saying some people are try to state that. If any thing. The club it’s self should be instanced.
---
"only the first foundation piece you place will need to be built on  terrain, all subsequent foundations you snap to that original piece will  then ignore this rule."   Oh please let this be as good as it sounds!! no more "floating foundations" yes! please!
---
Rest in peace Fo3 liberty prime democracy just ain’t the same without you
---
Yup. That's why I think they should instance the Burrows. More nuking incentive, less Whitesprings abuse and frustration. No who-launched-it incentive needed.
---
Off topic but, I think I stumbled upon your camp the other day, on the road next to the pylon station??? It was like, the stairway to heaven house, and your name in neon? Quality Gt
---
No, I'm looking for something that won't have stuff sticking out the bottom, which winds up floating in midair. I'd rather effectively just have a "floor" hanging off the other foundation bits, than a concrete foundation that doesn't touch the ground.
---
As a trans donkey who plays fallout, thank you
---
try sticking to the world the game takes place in, not the real world. The real world has radar, sonar and drones, but doesn't have a pip boy. know what else it doesn't have? a post apocalypse and the ability to respawn. not everyone plays games for the same reason you do. also you call the people that don't want to PVP soft but you don't want to do the work of hunting for people in Survival mode. so they may be soft, but you and your friends are lazy.
---
If you're not doing a Bloodied build then I suggest using Instigating with 40% Increased Swing Speed. Swing Speed is always good.
---
Lol no, that's not my point.
---
I like the game. And if you're on this subreddit just to act like 6 people enjoy it you're a moron. Considering this subreddit alone has more active users than /r/Fallout, it's pretty objectively clear that a lot of people like this game.
---
My point was that these posts offer nothing. They're not discussions. They're not screenshots showing the game or whatever. It's just circlejerking. And circlejerking of any kind is fucking terrible and lazy.
---
I 100% completely agree, unfortunately the vast majority of this subreddit views any critisism no matter how constructive and meant to be helpful to the game as just "jumping on the hate train."
---
The only person I've seen be able to not heap nothing but praise on this game in this subreddit is Matn and even when he did a lot of people in this sub even tried to claim he was jumping on the hate train.
---
On the bright side, you've learned an important lesson.
---
You still have a place to PvP if you feel though. So its not removal of features, just movement.
---
You're asking for greifing without the downside. Which is specifically what they are trying to avoid.
---
Awesome!!
---
Well I wish they could at least mention that it's by design so I can go ahead and get rid of empath.
---
It wouldn't work unless they made it a load-screen interior cell.
---
Strike the fuse on a metal plate then throw that bitch. Saving Matt Damon style.
---
HEAVY SPOILERS: This is the original post where I documented everything: https://www.reddit.com/r/fo4/comments/4hdprc/but_who_watches_the_watchers_spoilers/
---
My thoughts exactly.
---
Like ya thinking lol
---
Also. When you throw baseball grenades at the baseball player statue, it should hit it back at you.
---
That is all.
---
I agree with expanding the no build zone for Whitesprings. Everyone needs to farm eventually so it would be a bit unfair to players who need to tag them ghouls.
---
I look at my rads since I run Sun Kissed. If I'm accumulating them, it's night (or I'm killing ghouls). If I have none, it's day. 🙂 I do check the clock to see if it's getting close to day time if I'm needing to clear some rads without Radaway or a shower.
---
Ok.  If you had read the whole thing it's clear that the camps are protected IF the player and their turrets aren't hostile towards another player.  If your fighting another player then their camp can be attacked.  
---
Those of us who don't want to deal with PvP and don't want to be forced to spend valuable materials are free to play in peace, those who want to fight others and break other people's hard work are free to do so.  
---
This is how it should be, you can decide to make your camp vulnerable to other players and you may have to pay the price of it or you can just not engage and have your hard work be safe.  In the end this is the result of people griefing other players and this is the solution that the community wanted.
---
Power attack?
---
For fuck sake dude just admit it. You're not a big shot game developer and you have no place telling these devs what to do.
---
You have to be fucking moronic to think you're some world class developer for working on games over 15 years old and then coming here acting like you know what's best for a modern video game.
---
&gt;But I'm not saying anything else because being a woman makes it very easy if I give more info than that to doxx me.
---
You're insecure as fuck.
---
there was a debuff for killing without caps. it didn't stop them.
---
So make them. I don't think they are that expensive to make.
---
Please send gamertag so I can invite :)
---
i have the same problem with the "kill laugh love" neon, honestly. it's impossible to read the "laugh" because the light completely washes it out.
---
I was in whitesprings. Then  the siren came. I thought no biggy just keep farming. 
---
Timer was at zero. I looked up. The nuke absolutely lawn darted me. 
---
Got a spiffy achievement. But i could not stifle my laughter and my wife had to come see what was so funny. The retelling wasnt as glorious. But damn.
---
One of my top 10 moments
---
[Liberty Prime liked that]
---
Ok, found the place. its in the east of  tanagra town. its the largest building near the busstop. but - its completly worthless. Nothing relevant inside
---
The whitesprings plans vendor sells it as vault bed 2
---
Sure why not. One screen isn’t going to kill us. If you can’t deal with that. Well then maybe fallout isn’t the game for you. Tbh
---
Prototype xo1
---
Depends on what you want from your PA. Some want more rad resist, some more dmg resist, I use excavator so I can loot more.
---
SAME.  One less radaway.
---
Positive note - I've met some awesome players making sure everyone around is getting a shot in! Happens a lot more than not and often goes unmentioned.
---
Upvote for atom thingies
---
Ah yea I see what you mean then. I mean I think I definitely think the game has been turning around and I think the people that watch me have recognized that for sure. I personally feel the burrows was a mistep and could've be marketed better, but overall Wild Appalachia has been pretty good. 
---
I think one thing that stands out to me from this sub is youtubers are always credited with the bad, but never the good. Over the past 2 months I have been mostly positive around this game but that largely gets ignored, the second I mention something bad though and suddenly I am back on the hate train for views. Its genuinely just my opinions though. The sheepsquatch update was without a doubt the best  this game has seen so far and I hope people saw my video saying that and redownloaded it as a result. There is still a pretty long road ahead for improvement but I definitely think things are looking positive, outside of a few missteps here and there
---
I also recognize a lot of this sentiment is a result of my coverage of the game following release and the couple months following. I get why people are quick to call me a Fallout 76 hater, etc and don't particularly blame them for that
---
probably rad resist
---
I'll take take it for 500 caps if on Xbox
---
private servers, dude. you can get privately hosted servers for pretty cheap and control who gets in. only allow your faction and all your opposing factions that you know will follow rules of engagement.
---
Anything hot rod or atom cats related I am all about!

I’m seeing alot of females here complaining about encounters with males after revealin their voice. And im so sad there are so many unpolite people out there.
---
Age, race, gender and sexual orientation shouldnt have anything to say. Be kind to whoever you encounter and you will have the posibility  for many good moments and maybe even friendship.
---
People that behave like this are probably missing some social skills or just feel allmigthy behind an avatar.
---
Just brush it off and feel sorry for them cause its them that are missing out interactions when they cant act as decent humanbeings.
---
Very cool, see you soon. ID: Aonaran!
---
Same on Xbox ...maybe the last update killed voice chat?
---
It should become available with 3/3 ordinance express.
---
The new egg I got still appeared as locked in my inventory until I got enough concrete to make it. Maybe you didn't have the materials?
---
I mean that’s all of Reddit. Circle jerking. Brigading other subreddits, flinging Shit.
---
I mostly come on here to trade stuff.
---
So does that mean since I used "stacking foundations" glitch (and the angled wall glitch) I can now move my camp?
---
He’s real, just very underwhelming
---
Had the same thing happen over 700 hours ago. Find a Suppressor's Flamer, maybe with even more stars, and rename it the Pyrolyzer. Easy fix
---
Then the X-01, but I'm with the looter - excavator forever.
---
Huh. I just realized that every time somebody says Matt Damon, I hear the voice of Matt Damon from Team America in my head.
---
Definitely check out Prickett's Fort its up northeast past Grafton and dont forget to go to the cemetery. Some cool items there
---
I hear ya. I have two daughter and neither of them would give the time of day to someone who wasn't a gentleman and at least somewhat chivalrous.  Hard to find in this day and age,  but they're out there still, both have been very lucky in that regard. 
---
Dont get me wrong, neither are shrinking violets, they're both strong and assertive. They have certain expectations based upon what they saw growing up and won't settle.👍😁
---
On PS4, I've had a problem like that with melee VATS, but not the problem you had without VATS. Did you submit the video along with a ticket?
---
I wasn't aware that all we had to do to find Osama bin Laden was highlight his blip on a map.
---
What station are u on?
---
ok thanks another quick querie what's the best mod for x-01
---
I can't remember the exact source, but the devs DID say they were planning to remove damage to CAMPS without PVP approval a few weeks ago.
---
Awesome thank you!!
---
Heck in a handbasket
---
Np pc xb1 or ps? I
---
Well I do, but I like free things.
---
PS4 :)
---
r/okbuddyretard. Is a great place to find cringe if you’re into cringe.
---
LOL, I've had people attempt to dox me plenty of times on reddit. Had people threaten to get /b/ after me, etc. You are an idiot if you think that shit doesn't happen. Go ask plenty of other people on reddit that have been doxxed for letting too much info slip.
---
&gt;You have to be fucking moronic to think you're some world class developer for working on games over 15 years old and then coming here acting like you know what's best for a modern video game.
---
I didn't work on them when they were 15 years old. I worked at midways san francisco office and helped develop the game from the ground up.
---
&gt;For fuck sake dude just admit it. You're not a big shot game developer and you have no place telling these devs what to do.
---
Where did I say I was a big shot game developer? All I said is I am a game dev. You are the one that kept making assumptions that I wasn't. So pointing out your ignorance and how wrong you are isn't being some kind of "game developer big shot." Just that you are easily proven wrong. LOL
---
Oh well
---
If you are on pc i can offer some caps for it
---
Is anybody else having issues getting the eggs to work? I was able to find the first one in the Atom shop yesterday, but I haven't seen any sense. I checked last night, and twice today.
---
Yes. The effect makes power attacks do 40% more. 
---
There’s also one that makes you take less when power attacks. 
---
It’s the button you hold for grenades. Just tap.
---
Daww man I have xb1 unfortunately
---
bought it just today and yes, some light are broken. imo its readable and fits into the wastland
---
That's why I call the movie Saving Matt Damon in the Team America voice. Fuck yeah!
---
I like this idea! Thanks.
---
Forgive my ignorance but why would latency affect dps?
---
Hey cancer bat, go long!
---
Not droped but we will get mods that add stars such as the scorched killer recivers and sacrificial blade mod for machete
---
I'm only a bit over a day into the game. I'm currently level 26 running The Dig with Bobbi No Nose. I have the option to meet Valentine, but am trynna do a few side quests before talkint to him. So if that tells ya anything as to where I'm at, LoL. I'll keep an eye out for the crows. Thanks 👍☺
---
That's really funny. Now I know why. 😂
---
Clean water that u pay for
---
I want the vim paint to come out at some point
---
Your axe has 40% swing speed and 40% more power attack damage?
---
Yessss
---
Not saying I don't think it's a good idea, I just don't think the devs will do it. But a man can dream.
---
Thank you for being able to express your enjoyment with a thing without subtley putting down anyone that expresses their disdain or frustration with it! It may not be the most optimized game, but there is definitely fun and entertainment to be salvaged!
---
If you haven't looked into it yet, check out the Mistress of Mystery questline, it had me truly gagged and shook by the ending!!!
---
Nice! It’s definitely not boring, just a bit short. I absolutely love the creepy atmosphere of the sewers! If you ever see it nuked, go straight to the Burrows. Each of the three times I’ve gone, there’s been at least 3-5 legendary ghouls down there. Worth it for sure!
---
I find junk runs and base building to be fun end game, but that could be just me
---
I’d noticed this, I have 2 reward named weapons with 2 legendary effects each. But neither have legendary stars. It was probably in a release I’ve missed sometime.
---
In the resort?
---
It's not rated the best, but I've had no problem using my lvl 25 excavator. It's even better if I'm able to share radsponge, but with two bloodied teammates, radsponge is out. I do like it for the carry weight too.
---
it doesn't affect DPS, but if you're operating at several hundred MS of ping, I frequently die because of how the game calculates damage...often, I've been dead for most of a second before a mob I killed registers I've done damage and drops dead. 
---
Vampire healing isn't, apparently, instant, so that is added in on top as a time delay.
---
Free is over rated. Once you start getting stuff for nothing, you start always expecting stuff for nothing. Then when the free stuff runs out, you are left expecting all this stuff and all you get is your hand to play with. 
---
I just make it all, then I bitch at killing the QSB and other SBs for the bullet sponges that they are.
---
Not at home so can't supply full details but I have a 2* bloodied war drum I use as my main now instead of all rise.
---
My secondary is a bloodied all-star spiked rocketed wiffle bat - just a little less than all rise I think.
---
The Liberty Prime power armor mod for FO4 had something like this, it was glorious!!
---
As someone who hates cheating in online games. I dont think this counts
---
My camp is open for anyone to use the benches, get free water, cook food, hell I help more people even if they don't have the junk to fix stuff, why? Because that's what makes even the wasteland a better place. Do I ask for anything back? Nope!   
---
PvP servers... go for it! Destroy everything, kill everybody and have at it. You can literally do all you want and more there and won't have to worry about the PvE side at all.  
---
Based on what you've said PvP Survival mode should sound perfect for you! Too easy!
---
That’s a good idea!!! I wish someone would nuke over there instead of the same old areas like white springs and the fissure sight. That might give me a reason to do another silo run!!
---
I don't even know how to make my base any better lol, I guess make it bigger?
---
If everyone did that it wouldn't be a problem. Which is why Communism doesn't work. (Liberty Prime Voice) You aren't a dirty commie, are you??? lol
---
Yeah, the vendor is in the store at the end of the hall
---
Literally jump into all the fissure sites
---
Same here. I always lead ghouls to other players so they can get shots in if at all possible. One player I’ve become friends with cripples all the ghouls and lets people come in and get their shots. It’s great.
---
That sucks that happened to you, OP. Hope your next run is better.
---
I honestly love this game &amp; it’s games before this one. They make me feel relaxed &amp; I love it. &amp; I would never put anyone down , yeah sure the game isn’t perfect but to some ppl it’s just about having fun and enjoying it. To be it is! 
---
And yes I have it was awesome!! Still shook about it !
---
why?
---
Some of the flames paints were in the store for a bit. Didn't see the shark ones though.
---
I think this is an awesome idea gameplay wise, but lore wise it really depends on whether the mini nukes are timed detonations or impact detonations. If impact, this works perfectly, but if timed, the launcher most likely primes the nuke. Maybe a mod on the arms of the power armor?
---
Dont bring shit with u
---
&gt;Had people threaten to get /b/ after me, etc.
---
You keep saying you know so much because you're way older than I am (an assumption on your end too) yet you unironically say people "threaten" to be /b/ on you...
---
That's like admitting you get scared when you get a browser pop-up saying you've got a virus. How stupid can you be?
---
&gt;Just that you are easily proven wrong. LOL
---
Haha yeah except the overall point about you thinking you know better than these developers still hasn't been proven wrong and you continue to enforce that point anyway.
---
PS4
---
It actually is cheating and all of your illogical attempts to find an excuse are laughable.  
---
The game obviously wasn't intended to have ANY nukes on Monday or Tuesday.  There are zero letters of the code word revealed at that time, meaning it's IMPOSSIBLE without millions of attempts, which I assure you Nukacrypt does not represent.  You're not "working together to find a code", you're "using an exploit to access things which should be inaccessible on that day of the week."  Let me ask you:  How many times have you submitted correct codes to Nukacrypt?  Zero, because it's an algorithm.  No "community effort" required.
---
It was obviously intentional design to have it this way.  Calling it unfinished content when it's actually the intended behavior is just stupid and very indicative of that entitled gamer mentality everyone has lately.
---
Stop beating around the bush with nonsense comments, people.  There are 8 code pieces you must find to nuke.  If you're nuking without finding them (or speaking to someone who actually found them), you're cheating.  If you're nuking on Monday or Tuesday, there's a 99.9999999% chance you're cheating.
---
Few people have said the same. Should be the first item in featured. You have less than 3hours, so I hope you get it :(
---
C O M P R E S S I O N
---
A-well-a don't you know, about the bird?
---
Well, everybody knows that the bird is the word!
---
Yeah you can send me a request.
---
Happens to me all the time.  Didn't care much before, but now that the flux components are instanced, it's not worth my time to launch a nuke.
---
No. Just saying.
---
Thanks, I don't even really care about the eggs but I want to know what we get for collecting them all
---
TIL you can milk brahmin.
---
Oh I see thanks for explaining.
---
It actually is cheating.
---

---
And yes, I decrypt the code the FUN way every week. Because I'm not cool with cheating. I ran servers in the past and people are ALWAYS looking for a way to sneak past the rules.
---
Same as us all haha! I want what's coming to me 😂
---
I don’t typically trade with people but I was last night and noticed you can’t tell what’s on a 2 or 3 star item. Wasn’t going to drop big caps on a unknown weapon.
---
That’s why we have to poke the bear that is the devs. Otherwise they just read the next thing to do off of a script and damned be all.
---
Oh ok
---
I'm on xb1 and this happens to me all the time. I can't tell if it's my connection or not either :(
---
That's awesome. Would you consider adding me on ps4 so I could check it out in person? (It can even wait until after the camp update in may if you're hesitant)
---
Yea i was thinking we could prime the bomb similar to pulling the pin on a grenade
---
Yeah Id say this falls solidly into not cheating. Plus the process for decrypting nuke keys is boring and time consuming.
---
I agree so much..
---
Start a speakeasy on Friday nights. Live music, booze and food.
---
Yup. Just one more reason to instance the Burrows.
---
This seems like your fault. You were asking for that if you were stupid enough to bring ur shit with you
---
I may or may not have had a tear in my eye....
---
&gt;...they will need to sell tokens at the atom shop...
---
delete this
---
No, seriously. If they do this, it'll be on your head. There'll be riots in the streets, and everyone will blame ***you*** for giving them the idea!
---
I'm not asking for griefing. Nobody here seems to understand what the word means. Nobody who destroys camps us exploiting to do so, or using mechanics that were unintended. There is even a perk card for camp destruction! 
---
I could play the devil's advocate here and say that my build is totally built around camp destruction, with explosive perks and fire axes specifically to role play a mad bomber/arson. Bethesda will be forcing me into Survival, because my build is gutted in adventure.
---
did you quit your job to play fallout
---
lol, no just your everyday retired military vet... I'm getting stuff regardless so why not let people get a few hits in and use less ammo... ha!
---
Ummm.. honestly I kinda feel like this will be *more* floating foundations though... build straight off a cliff if you want?  Guess we'll see!
---
If only it was out now to collaborate with the weekly and daily challenges so we could actually complete them
---
Crowd mentality, mooooooooo.  You're wrong for the reasons stated above.
---
Consider the facts above.
---
 You can get carry weight with Calibrated Shocks for each leg, but I like the Jet Pack torso mod best myself. ;)
---
That's what I try doing to prevent them from running a million miles per hour now...lol
---
Yes. I want.
---
Then what do you care of camps you aren’t going to attack anyway happen to be indestructible?
---
Might wanna try r/Market76, it’s entirely dedicated to buying and selling items for 76.
---
Yea so?
---
Look up designs for houses and the likes. 
---
I’m going through a tiny house fad. So my goal is to make a tiny house with all the needs and wants I can squeeze in there. 
---
 Currently living in a 1x2 L with a 2x3 upstairs. And drawing out to make it even smaller.
---
Honestly, the second sentence of your comment reads to me as "I'm too dumb to understand the process."  I don't think that's a valid excuse for cheating.
---
*careful he's a hero*
---
Check your ammo bench, I think I know what happened.
---
As long as no one Parkeys it...
---
How would this make placing fences easier?
---
Because I am so down for that, but it just says foundations?
---
Best. Idea. Ever. 
---
And also, the mini nukes need more...BOOM. Seriously, how can we have rifles that do comparable damage to a fucking NUKE launcher?!
---
in the end honestly i'd use whatever PA you like using most.  with the 200% armor durability perks any max level PA can carry you through nuke zones, with adequate chems (radshield).
---
i used x01, while it does have good rad resist, but i only used it cause it was the only jetpack i had.  i did a few runs with 200% repair t60 and i'd say thats good enough.  cheaper to repair.  just remember radshield chem for extra rad resist.
---
I'm thinking it is better to rely on preventative measures that entirely mitigate the problem instead of playing asshole roulette every time you want to gather flux materials or hunt legendaries.
---
We have 2 confirmed woman in our community , when they were first playing with me they didn’t have mic’s or just weren’t using them , over time they realized we weren’t that bad &amp; haven’t stopped talking since lol . I don’t even use in game chat anymore &amp; I’m a guy lol . I do ps4 party chats with friends &amp; my fallout community. Your always gonna find S-heads when your online but we’re not all bad .Don’t let the few ruin your games
---
Remember if they're not dockers they're just pants!
---
Awww! Hopefully happy tears!!
---
Hey never said it was hard. He said its tedious, which it is
---
It would be pretty damn badass. Perhaps even an arm cannon of sorts? That's probably a stretch but I think there are a lot of options for Bethesda if they would LISTEN to the COMMUNITY. *nudge* *nudge* Bethesda
---
The fusion core shows up but not the receiver
---
When Bethesda said its a team effort to decrypt the codes they didnt say this wasnt aloud and the sites still up not alot of people complain since decrypting sucks to much time i dont normally enjoy looking stuff up but this is nice when the time comes to nuke
---
Nah. Got to toss is over the mountain. Like Uncle Rico.
---
It looks unreadable in the Atom Shop pictures.
---
No wonder it only costs 300...
---
Its definitely cheating, albeit on a smaller scale. You shouldnt feel bad because the voting system on this reddit is heavily flawed and NOT indicative of anything worth stressing over; most people here dont understand what makes a good game, whether thats a triple-A video game, or a simple word/letter puzzle or cipher.
---
Agreed.
---
Wow i’ve looked there hundreds of times I don’t know how I missed it. Thanks!
---
No, im not gonna "google" the problems. All im asking is how the server stability update is on other peoples end.
---
https://m.imgur.com/a/3ZhkLJl
---
The fight is tough. I'm at about 30% success rate. The sheep outfit itself seems to be quite rare.
---
thanks will defo look into it
---
Who needs hands and arms and legs and skin and organs!
---
4.	⁠I understand you don't want your camp destroyed. But the reality is there are dicks who are gunna do it. 
---
Not after they implement pacifist mode for camps. That’s the point.
---
Yea I bought that too and don’t think it looks good either.
---
Just diferent play styles i guess. I dont mind survival for PvP.
---
Actually there are plenty....Protect and serve
---
Same with me, was thinking asking here before investigating on my end.
---
Hope we get back to the same old o/
---
wow lol
---
LOVE this idea, especially if it comes with an option to pick your server so I could find the one with the least amount of people on it if I wanted to.
---
Honestly it makes sense that unless you have full protection in a nuke zone through a sealed armor you are screwed. I wish you could at least equip armor on the limbs over a hazmat suit
---
thanks I'll try that
---
Take the receiver out of your inventory and see if the Fusion core shows up again. I have this same problem I think. You may have the ultracite  ammo for it but not the receiver itself.
---
Ah thanks for the offer, but I don’t think I’m in desperate need of it, wuite happy just running around with the new white fedora with the new years special Black and White tuxedo
---
Thanks for that comment.  The comments were actually starting to bother me, but you're right.  I'm realizing now (due to this) that Reddit is only a place to trumpet crowd mentality, not actual intelligent conversation.
---
Np
---
The sheepsquatch is somehwat a challenge for god tier builds. I have a bloodied build and find that event "harder" than the SB queen. They can easily make a challenging event. 
---
Looting, exploration and crafting is the main loop of the newer Fallout games. This game requires you have a VERY good build to be able to "finish" the game. In large groups, you simply cannot defeat the queen without having a god-tier build. Even TSE weapons aren't that effective against the queen (you need bloodied).
---
Then you say that having good legendary gear is basically ruining the experience, which doesn't really make sense as it is a big part of the game and is the main allure. The most valuable (and rare) rewards are legendary weapons. It is part of the design.
---
If the first dungeon raid was hard for high-level players, then everyone would be more than excited to team-up and improve their builds. I'm not saying they should make a dungeon very hard for fully kitted legendary characters but they should at least make it very difficult to be completed without legendary gear (which clearly isn't the case with the burrows). Considering that there is at least a month between dungeon releases, this is ample time for everyone to come up with strategies and everyone would be more than glad to face the next dungeon.
---
What Firefox version? FF version 40 before may not work, nor does Internet Explorer due to lack of proper JavaScript support. Works for me in Firefox 66.
---
But why does people figuring out the process through which 76 constructs its codes constitute cheating?
---
Hey I don’t think they go lower than level 30.
---
I can make you one.
---
Happens on PC as well, been irking me since it started my melee alt
---
Eh, still doesn't negate the fact that it's cheating to use an algorithm to figure out word puzzles intended to be done by humans.
---
But I guess.
---
I have the mascot outfit, and mask. And the Wolf’s hat
---
Firefox Quantum 66.0.3(64-bit)
---
Well the mine bottom right of map in cranberry is filled with ultracite just that hell is there
---
At the end of Mistress of Mystery... :-)
---
You’ve seen Baseball Grenade
---
Now get ready for Football... Bigger Grenade
---
30 is fine. Can you get on now? I am on
---
As far as I know, criticals are just flat damage boosts, but I don't know the exact formula for them. You can add extra damage via the other/boost percentage as a workaround for now.
---
Oh yeah no that was sad! Lol
---
&gt;You keep saying you know so much because you're way older than I am (an assumption on your end too) yet you unironically say people "threaten" to be /b/ on you...
---
Correct, they got salty I trolled Drumpf supporters, and /b/ is a pretty big supporter of that orange idiot. So yes, it wouldn't be the first time they doxxed someone for daring to not love that orange racist shitbag.
---
&gt;That's like admitting you get scared when you get a browser pop-up saying you've got a virus. How stupid can you be?
---
Seems the only stupid one here is you, if you think /b/ is harmless if you piss them off.
---
&gt;Haha yeah except the overall point about you thinking you know better than these developers still hasn't been proven wrong and you continue to enforce that point anyway.
---
I've not released this buggy mess that is fo76, so yeah I'm a better developer than bethesda already. I've never released a game with a sub 30 review. All the games I helped develop were extremely popular and well reviewed. Go look up the scores san francisco rush, received for the n64, now compare it to the reviews of fo76, or fo4, or fo3, or skyrim. Even their best game stills scores lower than the games I helped create.
---
Lemme guess you believe you got a 180 iq and refuse to talk to peers like humans unless they agree with you or match your intellect
---
Lol people have been suspecting this for quite a while, especially after the repair kit thing. It’s their idea not players’. 
---
The thing is, if it’s completely RNG, the number of possible combinations is huge, no amount of tokens from selling garbage legendary items will be sufficient. We are the gamblers, where do we source our chips?
---
I know this post is old but this happened to me for the first time today. God i wanted to stab my ear drums till there was nothing left...so much for "being your only warning" it's crazy after a month, we still have to deal with this
---
Your good in my book Juice 👍
---
Sure that’ll be 1400 atoms per weapon
---
It must have been a glitch, after switching worlds I found it under floor decor. The &lt;&gt; scroll option worked.
---
Added. The shiskebab has half the base damage so it would lose on a one-hit case. Speed-vise, I don't know.
---
The website isn't working for me, could you put it on imgur instead?
---
Yes, i understand what he means but i mean to a scorch beast the damage was far less than a lever action. like for example lever action scorch beast healthbar \[llllllllllllllllllllll.....\], hunting rifle damage \[lllllllllllllllllll...\]. Even on glowing ghouls damage per shot lever action bested my anti armor hunting rifle. I guess scorchbeasts don't have armor ? but other videos i watched says anti armor is the best against it.
---
mods don't work on weapons armour and power amour till the next update
---
Dude did you get your ribs removed so you could suck your own dick that hard? You're not having an intelligent conversation, no one has been overtly hostile to you but you're acting like your some intellectual that's being persecuted by the Vatican.
---
Personally think marsupial &gt; jet pack so I run reactive plates since so many enemies in nuke zones melee. RP gives +50% melee damage reflected on attacker
---
Psn is maxpowers_69
---
I havent crafted the ultracite fusion core ammo yet i dont have flux but the mod dosent show up at all so i cant craft the Ultracite receiver at all
---
What would be cooler would be a quest that would give you the schematic to build a cleaning bench where you could use materials to clean clothing, weapons and armor.
---
I have never understood the thought process (or lack there of) of people being assholes to a woman in any context just because she is a woman. It sucks that fuckwits have to ruin your experience like this. If you are looking for someone who isn't a dipshit to game with feel free to message me, though I am still fairly new at the game.
---
By region I wonder if it means like cranberry hot, Savage divide, etc... Not actual nuke zone
---
Is this on purpose?
---
No one buys/sells plans they give them away.
---
I got the egg to work, I don't know if this is what did it but what I did was go to the Atom shop through the Easter egg image/link on the news screen
---
My hunter could use a battle buddy.
---
My personal fave is Carhartt. They are indestructible. I have a hoodie and veat that I purchased in 1998 and I still wear them almost every day in the winter months.
---
Horrible deal.
---
So they’re “cheating” by your rules. 
---
In the past, you’d slap them to death, right?
---
Dude, that’s the definition of griefing. If they have pacifist on, then THEY DON’T WANT TO PLAY THAT WAY WITH YOU.
---
This football cant miss so long as it lands on their side of the 50yd line
---
What if they don't wear socks
---
Are you on discord?
---
Exactly the reason for this post, sketchy as hell lol
---
Could you reply to this comment when you drop the first nuke?
---
Ultracite = scorchbeast fissures
---
Dude sorry I deleted your request can you send another?
---
Your faction warriors shouldn’t be playing with pacifist on.
---
And freedom
---
It definitely cheapens the original intention of obtaining nuclear codes.
---
that's a good idea !
---
Well, enjoy this wave of downvotes.
---
What is the other effect? All depends on that.  If AP refresh then maybe sure 3k is reasonable
---
Meh I’d like it more if we could punt them 1/10 chance you fumble the punt
---
The institute isn't even in the franchise at this time and the institute is located in Boston
---
 You mean they fixed that? It has been broken for ages and useless. 
---
 I like a Jet Pack myself, but then I don't like mutations a great deal in general.
---
Two shot is not very good on shotguns due to the "second shot" being just an additional pellet in the spread and that additional pellet has all the bonus damage on it. So if you are shooting at a distance then that shotgun is like using a normal double barrel with no legendary effects.
---
Same, reply to me when first drops if possible. I will try to join, Rifleman build.
---
The golf club is a very popular place, that would be nice to have them their. It’s flat and has buildings. Seems harpers ferry atm has also a good area for that as well, more specifically the burrows.
---
power move tbh
---
I got lucky with the featherweight launcher :)
---
The stats of it is, grants +35 DR and ER AND +1 Luck (No ap refresh)

Loads.

I'm also a xbox consol pleb and experience this also. It's not your connection, seems like some server lag or something. If I run fast I've also noticed render lag in buildings and landscape.
---
Sorry about that. Let me edit the post real quick to change url’s.
---
I'd really like that
---
We should be able to detonate them by shooting them with an energy weapon.
---
I have two of them. If you happen to have an executioners auto weapon I’ll be happy to trade it.
---
Now that right there... That's a reference
---
That will take u straight to the section so could be!
---
The strange in numbers perk card has been glitched for a while now. If you or anyone on the team is running it it will display weird shit in the mutations and reduces dmg for some reason on melee. I'm not sure about any others.
---
the biggest thing i want an answer for: 
---
since when did nukacrypt hack the game code? do you have proof? thats a pretty bold fucking claim with no evidence. you will probably be downvoted every time until proof is provided
---
last time i checked they listed all possibilities until one of the discord crews brute forces the silo with enough keycards to feed all the pc players for a month. then moves it to confirmed. (this was about a month ago)
---
then you have the fact that fun is subjective, another probable reason you got downvoted. i personally HATE solving cyphers, i have to problem solve enough crap at work. id rather have a straightforward approach that i can get a code i can use than to dick around for hours on my 1 day off to figure out a code.
---
then there is also people with limited playtimes.  these people who maybe get on 1-2 hours would never launch a nuke if they had to drop an hour to grind the codepeices, then spend time to decode  it early or wait for the weekend to fill out the keyword.  then decode it for x amount of time, then they have to run the silo.  its much easier for them to use a source to get the code in the limited time they have and then get to enjoy the game their own way.
---
I think this is how it's going to be. He can still do faction wars. Surprised he doesn't know when you crouch in adventure to hide yourself on the map. Survival might be a little too real for them.
---
Myself not a fan of vanguard, again tho come to what you yourself looking for and want.
---
The extra luck not a big thing either. I’d say 1k no more myself if that helps. But again if the piece fits what you want and u got caps to burn go for it
---
Working now?
---
Same. I tried to be social for about 30 levels, and then put away the headset.
---
Xbox bud
---
It works now, I think you may be onto something!
---
You can do the quest for it and get a power armor station for free after. It’s not cheap to make but it’s a free way.
---
I've had this problem the entire time I've had the game, until hearing someone for the first time today. I tried everything anyone has suggested. Not sure what the deal is.
---
That's impressive, not shameful. Well done.
---
Agreed! They really do seem identical imo.
---
Your min max melee build can suck on this you level 85 scrub.
---
GT is CrioUnknown711, see you there
---
Indeed you are right and exploiting has been a problem with this game, another guy I was talking too suggested that it becomes this safe zone but PvP can still occur if the player decides to engage in it, they both fire back at each other and wait 2 seconds and then they deal full damage so that theirs no one way fight
---
That would be really cool! You could also say it was meant to become a weapon, kinda like the deathclaw, but more discreet and would take out commies. Instead, it viewed everyone as an enemy and killed the scientists and trainers working with it, then fled to the forest, killing hikers in the woods
---
I just stay off mic for sure
---
In my somewhat recent experience in PvP it did work against Bloodied builds causing both of us to die. I believe I may check again just in case, but I’m 80% sure all the issues with it were patched 1-2 months ago, including the slap damage exploit
---
Hope that helps you in your decisions 👍🏼
---
The thing I don't understand is...how does this effect you like at all? 
---
More nukes the merrier I say. 
---
It also feels like an arbitrary difficulty added cause the silo isn't really that tough, especially if you have lock pick/hacking cards maxed out.
---
Rifleman gang
---
It was available during the B.E.T.A., but was “removed” for the final release of the game. However, it’s still in the game files. That’s why people were able to access it again through the developer room. Can’t remember the post, but Bethesda said they wouldn’t ban accounts if you have the plans or the helmet itself, since people could obtain it legitimately during the B.E.T.A..
---
You learn the plans by scrapping a helmet.
---
By the way, can you craft me a helmet I’ll pay you caps for it?
---
You dropping it so she spawns on the edge of the zone?
---
I say ditch that and just get a card deck build slot. So we don’t have switch out every single card in every single special. And then maybe you can name the deck build. For example, A heavy weapon build, a home construction build, a scrapper/crafter build, or even a pack mule build with all the different weight cards in the specials, instead of having to swap each individual one out.
---
No silencer gives up stealth I noticed. Try using ninja with a mr handy or ripper and you'll see my point.
---
Hopefully they have the legendary vendor by the point these are released so I can actually have room in my stash for them.
---
 genius
---
Thank you! I appreciate the advice, I'll wait it out instead since this isn't the exact piece I want. I was hesistant but thanks again.
---
I’m level 132 and still have not launched my own nuke...I want to work out the code before using the nukacrypt system of code sharing.
---
Sure thing! Just sent you my GT. I'll be online around 10PM tonight
---
LOL we wish
---
is this one punch man season 2
---
Is it the 2nd egg or third egg now?
---
This is so dumb....AND I WANT IT NOW!!!!   
---
Then we can have a game of nuclear football. I don't know how it would work. I just know it would be awesome.
---
How do you do the +karma thingy lol?
---
On the other hand, that means we can build bridges now.
---
That DCG is the best of the bunch
---
Most people are decent. It's.. just an unfortunate reality that we remember the six people who were fiery asshats better than the ninety-four that were fine and dandy.
---
It's sad that even in this modern day and age people think it's 'cool' to say disgusting, abhorrent shit just because they hear a female voice over the mic. If the platform allows it, report them for offensive comms. If they make a habit of this and everyone reports them when they do it, they'll get temp-banned repeatedly until their behavior improves.
---
It's not much compared to some of the awful things I've heard people say, but at least it's something.
---
Box mods are broken
---
MUTATED SASQUATCH
---
Yeet
---
I find that helping new players is fun. Even if it’s an alt, it’s great to make a new friend and help them on their journey. Other than that, I made a mission for myself to have all the workshops claimed by me, so you could try that
---
to be fair, it is the apocalypse.
---
that's happening during a nuclear apocalypse.
---
that happened in a area with a good hunting indu- *Oh shit, you're right.*
---
The roleplay on this thread, lol.
---
I will admit I am a bit sad when the mini nuke suit case is empty.
---
“The Whitesprings is under our protection.”
---
- Random Assaultron Probably
---
Hmmm does west tek then bump the mutants to more legendaries?
---
My hope is that player vendors will have the option to show on the map. Otherwise it’s very hit and miss that anyone will stumble across a player camp to use a vendor. Plus with no map option, the area around the vault is going to become very clogged.
---
I never use the mic. Too much drama/unwanted attention.
---
\----------------
---
Though there are something I'm glad aren't real...
---
Somethings are better left... ***forgotten.***
---
I’m throwing grenade u think it’s gonna break stealth?
---
I'm so glad to see it's not just me! It's been driving me nuts, I thought something was broken..
---
Hopefully Bethesda fixes this soon :/
---
All Bethesda need to do is make it that you physically need the keycards to launch a nuke.....but, in doing that, it makes it difficult for the only thing that keeps the high level players here.....so unfortunately I think that Bethesda cannot change anything currently or they will risk losing a large player base.
---
when’s the next patch coming?
---
I don't get why they don't create stickied idea mega thread so it cuts down on the "dear bethesda" posts. 
---
Now people are dropping the dear bethesda posts and just posting ideas. Imagine if ever other game thread out there was like this one. Not even in the WoW sub is it this bad.
---
Let the people bitch for fucks sake, cause you know it's coming with every patch. Why not a stickied mega thread for the most recent patch, and a stickied technical issues mega thread.
---
Maybe stickied mega threads are too logical? 
---
This way we can see more camp designs, pics and stories hit the front page.
---
Hear me out:
---
I would love to see an SBQ battle part 2, but this time theres like evidence of multiple queens and seismic activity from all the scorchbeasts that have gathered below fissure site prime. The server is warned 1 in game day before their "ascent", a final assault from the beasts, at which time a new workshop area opens near the watoga station, claimed by all on the server where people can spend resources to build new heavy artillery weapons and maybe some newer endgame anti-scorched badassery, along with large defensive structures much like those scattered across the bog.
---
The assault begins and a thick blanket of ultracite vapor emerges from all nearby fissures, essentially turning the whole bog into a less intense nuke zone and turning all mobs scorched instead of glowing. As an added affect, players who do not meet a certain condition (idk, no PA? Not enough INT??) have a chance to become scorched themselves, causing their character to go into an AI frenzy on all nearby players until they are killed and respawned. This would put an interesting spin on having lower leveled, unprepared people around.
---
10 waves, 4-5 beasts and hordes of scorched, a queen every third wave with a special surprise on the 10th, maybe the big titty scorched goddess or something. The thing in the lucky hole mine maybe? Sentient Ultracite?!?!?
---
I never wanted something I just heard about this bad beforw in my life.
---
I have one better, we should be able to play catch with mini-nukes while in power armor.
---
Nuclear Hot Potato
---
The recent update broke mod attachments. They might fix it in the next update, though.
---
Nope
---
That’s why I’m hoping that if we do get FT Mats that our Camp will appear on the map for players to travel to at no cost.
---
Well that explains where I got it then!  I sunk many hours into the B.E.T.A.  And sure I'll craft you one, PSN ColonelBiggles
---
Are you for hire to drop 3 more on the queen after 8pm? I can give you the 3 nuke cards and 250 caps per drop? Let me know
---
Yeah I want that too, but I’m saying that when you level up you can search for the card you want instead of scrolling for it
---
You might be onto something. The fucker interrupted me right as I got to the good part of Galgun’s true ending route 😤
---
If I see low levels, I always give them food, water, and help them out for a bit. I think that helping others is what I need to make my day. Fallout may be a cruel and unforgiving wasteland, but people are way too kind. Let's keep it that way.
---
I think a werewolf would be cool. Have an FEV created by a wolf and Aman
---
Add me, same name on ps4
---
Not added yet. Was delayed
---
I’ll be nuking harpers tonight. Gotta check it out for myself.
---
I had the same thing with an assault rifle, so perhaps it’s all of the heavy weapons?
---
Thank you! I’ll add you as soon as I get home. I’m at work atm. My PSN is the same as my reddit name.
---
There's this holiday cabins area in the forest, in which there's moving paintings, self closing doors and the screams you mentioned. The screams come from a speaker and the doors and paintings are controlled by a hidden terminal.
---
Damn birds. They just come right on in and act like they pay rent.
---
There is a set of cabins, can't remember the location name, but its got a bit of a back story and it will definitely scream at you from the woods.
---
If someone throws a grenade at you, you can see an indicator and direction. The legendary effect works but I'm not sure the stealth bonus. If it works, you'll see the sneak damage multi in the upper left.
---
I haven't had too many bad interactions, but there have been a handful of people who treat me like shit because I sound girly. Mostly, I stay off the mic and let everyone else talk in area to see what they are like. If they seem like decent people (offering each other help, giving away aid, calling out legendaries), then I'll turn my mic on and start talking.
---
I'm also in a few Discords for people who play almost every night, so I rarely play solo anymore. Usually we have too many people to fit into a group (or together on a single server).
---
I agree with this whole post and all comments. The animal tame mechanic is very rough around the edges. For how tough it is to get a pet, it should be more rewarding.
---
I want a cryptid that digs into the ground like a molerat, does the heavy claw swipe and yao guai sound effect, has the mothman and flatwood monstie particle/aura effects and looks like a ragdolling scorchbeast clipping to and fro
---
I would love to see the data for laser rifles.
---
Link the update please it sounds too good to be true. :D
---
I don't even understand what happened, its just always wrong now?
---
At least before it was predictable, fire off shots equal to the number of cores you have, and then it reloads and acts correctly.
---
All workshops are easy to take. Nothing about survial mode makes them any harder. Just take it and leave. You don't even need to do the defend event. Nobody will even know you are there.
---
Upvoting cause this improved this same performance issue on my xbone.
---
🤷‍♂️
---
If I could yeet a mini nuke at a gaggle of pvp-ers, I would be sooooo happy
---
It's been datamined, but no real confirmation as far as I know.
---
Better than what you could probably do if that's all the launcher can do.
---
Grammar nazi as well , why am I not surprised ;)
---
Rad worms isn't that bad at least if you get one disease you have lesser chance to getting other diseases.
---
r/Market76
---
Oh, damn. Thanks a ton.
---
I'll be at work out of town for the next few days, but I'll add you anyway.
---
Looks like a normal Brahmin skull to me unless
---
Very good, but perhaps it have pre-requisite plans, so that early-game players can't get their hands on it - requires all purifiers and such. 
---
Also, we should able to collect purified from it, like a water source. And maybe also a version like the disease-curing one in the Whitespring?
---
Could you please add strange in numbers, class freak, mutations, and revenant!
---
But the burrows was too much?
---
Delete some friends fr your list.  This helps the ‘stutter’ issue since the last patch.  Might work for hit detection..
---
Then again FLW cantilevered Fallingwater...
---
I must admit, that sucks. We should put a bounty on that man. (Or woman.)
---
Damn man, feel bad for you, I’ve had my camp attacked partially leveled to the ground because I collected somebodies bounty, or bested someone when they tried to take one of my workshops.
---
I hope that doesn’t happen again for you, and I never accept invites from random people just incase they try it (I’ve had people that I killed send me a invite afterwards, it’s pretty obvious its bait to see where my CAMP was).
---
I think it’s in next weeks patch that CAMPs will become immune to damage from other players in Adventure mode though, so thats something to look forward to!
---
Good info my man.
---
It's not that the sheep is tough, it's the fact people are too selfish to claim a pylon.
---
I thought it could be something scripted! I looked at a map and I think it could have been near twin pine cabins.
---
Grammar Nazi as well,... why am I not surprised ;),..
---
I have a totally sexy 3 ⭐️ ghoul slayers fire axe, it's on a par with my bloodied grognak..why? Well ghouls easily account for 50% of the bad guys on f7 and the perks? Well ....they have the king of cool..Forty percent swing speed
---
one bullet for 1k caps?
---
Oh my god that would be great and ***ABSOLUTELY TERRIFYING.***
---
3rd one tonight
---
Yeah i guess it could lead to some stupid builds. I was just thinking from my own perspective - hopefully no more trouble placing foundations on relatively flat ground. i'm ever hopeful :)
---
There's a bird in the attic!
---
Nah it's for surprise attacks vs players or (use pacifist first) large enemies.
---
Yeah man im level 26 I had to grind for 10 days straight to get it
---
Just exploring or going on with your own business when you start to hear the familiar sound of a stomping power armor suit and for some reason the yell out:
---
"Hot potato"
---
If I notice lower lever players trying to level up I will give them a chance for hits. Tesla rifles are nice for farming ghouls in WS.
---
Yeah I kind of discovered this when I started a new character its a very hard game because lots of the mobs spawn at a real high level because of the rest of the player base.
---
Even worse is when you have finished clearing an area and a new high level wonders in and they respawn and you right in the middle of it now
---
I hate you and love you so much. This should reach Bethesda.
---
They don’t hack. It’s a brute force solution. Our group solved Alpha and Charlie last week. You quickly collect the code pieces, generate the number of possible words and start entering numbers. It takes several hundred nuke keycards to solve unless you get lucky early.
---
I thought those were teeth on the bottom, making the elongated part the nose bones.
---
I am picky with caps and yeah I help newbies lol
---
Happened to me a couple times the other day. After a minute or so it let me out.
---
Welcome to the Internet.
---
But to carry around 50lbs of stuff for that? Even the daisy cutter still has a few lbs plus at least 3lbs per Nuke. I think it’s fun to pull it out and randomly blow stuff up but doesn’t appear to have a lot of actual combat use. 
---
At least I’ve never seen anyone use one, I could be wrong some people might love it.
---
I thought the ultracite Gatling laser and Gatling laser were two different guns....
---
You need a card to launch.  Hundreds of cards are burned on Monday night to solve the codes from the 1000s of possible solutions.
---
Lol don’t think it works in this subreddit but no wrys 👍🏼
---
If we do get this, it would be excellent. I can just imagine that guy who makes the trap C.A.M.P.s doing this...
---
I just found that out i didnt know
---
Lawless wasteland of "im always right" and "dont tell me im wrong cause that makes you wrong" it sucks
---
I think you bought the Prime Receiver for the Ultracite Gatling Laser.  Which won't show up unless you've already learned the plan for the Ultracite Gatling Laser.
---
The building in the middle of Watoga the mining company one has about 10 scrap in it but fissures are the best place
---
I did my research and now I feel silly. Should have explored the place better!
---
Running behind. Someone nuked White springs so I had to do a loop.
---
I have a executioner enchantment on mine and have 45 minis on it. Using express perk with bear arms I'm currently the man with every heavy weapons or at least most of them.
---
Yea i didnt know they were two diffrent guns i though putting a prime makes it a ultracite weapon but it actually uses ultracite ammo?
---
&gt;Correct, they got salty I trolled Drumpf supporters, and /b/ is a pretty big supporter of that orange idiot. So yes, it wouldn't be the first time they doxxed someone for daring to not love that orange racist shitbag.
---
I cannot take you seriously after saying all that.
---
&gt;I've not released this buggy mess that is fo76, so yeah I'm a better developer than bethesda already.
---
Hahahahahahahahahahah holy fuck
---
Might being the primary word here.
---
Restart the app
---
That name sounds right. I think Oxhorn did a Youtube video about the area but its very spoiler heavy
---

---
thank you for confirming it is still player ran. thats also why i asked OP for proof, he throws out all those accusations with absolutely no proof. 
---
is it still the same crews as last months or did they swap some members again? just personal curiosity since i know the legendary vendor week will be a madhouse on discord.
---
but that's not what the title says, it says why can't I play Appalachia Radio on my jukebox, and as others have pointed out jukeboxes don't play radio stations
---
Thanks for the advice though! I was hesitant at first but not the piece I was looking for.
---
You couldn’t be more wrong in how you think they solve the code. There is no hack, no exploit. It is a brute force solution with multiple teams spread out on multiple servers entering codes. The code pieces are collected quickly and the number of possible words determined from those pieces. Each number entry requires a nuke keycard and entering the number. Hundreds of nuke keycards are burned solving each silo.
---
COOL STORY BRO
---
go to the trading stations and look into the bags. many players are droping  "waste" there. be kind and leave something you dont need.
---
[Fatman](https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/article/QtVQlF3lmGXkLAZ8GV4VJ/inside-the-vault-survival-mode-beta-overview)
---
Ok, arguments aside, sounds like we need a system to both facilitate factions and faction wars for survival. Sounds pretty cool actually. 
---
As a sincere suggestion, perhaps make a post with this suggestion along with your reasons for wanting it. To attack adventure mode players like this is not only counterproductive, it accomplishes nothing.
---
Favre?    Run the fucker like Russel Wilson.   Dodge left, right, out of the grasp of that ghoul, and run the nuke up SBQ's ass.
---
Link ?
---
I believe this is the 2nd. 3rd should rotate in tonight.
---
It's a disappointing discovery. Could have been something cool.
---
And Democracy
---
I know right? I’ve commented on this sub before that Bethesda really needs to get their act together and speed up the release of bug fixes. They always break something whenever they release a new update, and take weeks to fix it. Depending on the severity of the bug. But people on this sub take that as an attack on Bethesda and the game itself. Lol
---
I made a new character for survival and it's super fun. I don't bring my other characters in there, just my little level 27 gunslinger. So far it's a blast. I live the tension that comes from having to outwit bros a hundred levels higher than you who are armed to the gills with end game gear, while I'm sneakinf atound with a pipe revolver.
---
A chaotic, down-to-the-wire SBQ fight is one of the most intense experiences in games right now.
---
You might of gotten the plans for the ammo. I have the same problem with the mod I have. Also it might be fun locked.  ultracite Gatling laser and regular Gatling laser are two different guns from what I have seen
---
There are multiple discord groups that are running codes. It’s sort of turned into a race to see who is first. We happened to get lucky last week, but this week alpha and Charlie were solved in a half hour. Bravo is typically the hardest and wasn’t solved until Tuesday.
---
Yes! I'd love this so much more than the nuke - grenades. And it can still be balanced by having the Mininuke weigh the same, but maybe do like 15-25% less damage, and you have to craft it. Like rigging it to explode without a Launcher.
---
Run a long little boy, you think I care what you think? I've already proven you wrong a dozen times already.
---
I mean that would just be a minor inconvenience I’m sure since you can fast travel anywhere.
---
But there's no problem with you lifting a 16 ton nuke with one arm when you want to reload that bad boy
---
You wait for bethesda to update and fix the bug. everyone already knows about it on reddit by now
---
Yeah, I live watching the electricity hop through a whole month of of them. Not sure, but I think it has a multiplier effect when it does that. If I melt down three or four, tho, someone is always sure to jump in and scarf the loot.
---
They delayed the content without changing anything else, because that would have taken effort.
---
Not this one, you probably mean Vault raids, that will come the summer.
---
I think this is one of the things they had in mind when they sat down to make this game.
---
Are you high or is this a joke
---
Pvp is not balanced
---
&gt;RFxcGinnie
---
perfect gave me time to hop in your world
---
il have to jump onto discord then and watch the madness since its turning into a race, best wishes to your crew on the legendary vendor updates "race"
---
I’ve run it several times and love it. Legendary ghoul spawn rate is pure RNG and not much different from WS, but the attention to details and atmosphere made it a very nice addition to an already massive and beautiful game. It just feels more polished and alive than most other areas, you can almost touch and smell it when you explore it from one space to another. Great job Bethesda artists 👍🏻👍🏻
---
MAAA'AM
---
Level 50 perk card? Also reduces mini nuke weight. Is there a card for that already? Call it *democracy is non negotiable*
---
No direct experience, but I've heard that power armor is bupkis for pvp.
---
i know. got it since 89 but still not dulled anough
---
oh, i thought that it was relatively new since I searched on why mods weren’t working and the only post that showed up was from 2018
---
Monday is crazy night. Teams standing in silos, teams hunting code officers. The rest of the week is mellow just shooting cargobots
---
I am the Fat Man
---
This sub is usually so negative that an entirely other sub was created for people who actually enjoy the game.   It's nice to see a ray of sunshine in here every now and then.
---
The suppressor legendary effect recharges on each successful hit. Basically you can reduce the damage output as long as you are attacking them. Someone said it stacks with the suppressor perk cards as well effectively reducing enemy damage by 50 pct. I haven't tested that yet though.
---
Let me see, I will get back with you
---
I think it would be a bit weird to add in a chupacabra into Appalachia only because all the cryptids found in the game were from around the West Virginia region. This is an awesome idea though and I hope it can implemented in a future fallout, maybe where the chupacabra tale originated.
---
Yeah it sure seems that way, my normal combat rifles dont seem to need repair nearly as much and I shoot it just as much
---
laughs in sandals as I steal your bagged lunch
---
Awesome! Thanks! I'm currently working on my finals but I should be good to play sometime this weekend
---
The boss became invisible, got behind me, stabbed me in the back, and died, thanks to my reactive plates lol
---
From my experience, this is very true. Still doesn't stop me though.
---
Hoarding is a mental illness.
---
Weird flex, but ok. 
---
Who wants fewer launches?
---
Yeah yeah, we know how much you hate Richie Richie Marcus and Betsy Bright, Borous
---
Your saying if you mess up a password you lose the keycard?
---
Honestly, unless you're building a vats crit build...that's a 1\*.  That's about all luck does.    
---
Here's what I would recommend, personally. Figure out what you \_need\_ then figure out what you \_want\_.   
---
So you're doing a max health build. Vanguards is great for that, because you get to rock a bit of extra DR/ER. Fantastic.   
---
But what's your actual build, what are you doing for damage?  What's your goal here?
---
Right, but the point is that what appears to be a basic Combat Rifle or 10mm should not be able to 1-Shot with over 600 Damage Resistance, damage intake reduced by 20% and every other perk that reduces damage.
---
This man has to be doing like 1000 Damage with a single shot to have killed me. Using what's not a TSE, which is still broken.
---
I didn't notice much dropping from dying when I was on this weekend getting the survival challenge completed.
---
I just want caps for my hard grinding to get this amazing item
---
When they patched survival mode in and made damage adjustments to make weapons more effective, they basically made the damage from everything super hard hitting. Disregard their comment that weapons won’t one shot.
---
You fast travel to your camp for free, autoscrap at any workbench, autodump all junk, and fast travel to the event. It would take thirty seconds...  maybe a minute if you were really trying hard to be slow.
---
That’s great man. I have a small son as well and when’s old enough I hope he wants to play games with me. Ur a lucky guy 👍
---
I'm positive. But even still, your Vampire Gatling laser sounds like a better all around weapon   than an Ultracite Gatling.  But yes the Ultracite Gatling does more base  damage but not enough to matter  when compared to   the Vampiric and other effects of your weapon.
---
Each person gets their own gear loot if they hit a body so you shouldn't worry about stuff getting stolen with the last patch. You should also get more glowing mass and hi res fluids then ever before.
---
I only use it briefly for guns like the gatling, the plasma gatling, and the crossbow.
---
But my stash is at capacity is what I'm saying because why waste stuff. So I'd have figure out what I've got too much of to deposit stuff I need more of.
---
So weird, they just keep popping up- why?!
---
Sounds fun. People on this sub are too obsessed with maxing out their damage output and they're missing that the whole idea of a video game is to max out their fun output.
---
the problem witht this is that maybe 5% of fallout players are running those types of builds.  they dont represent the majority of the playerbase, but are the most vocal.  
---
there are many different builds you can have in this game.  to force players to use the most OP build in order to finish the game isnt the right way to go, especially when this game is centered around personalizing and customizing your own character.
---
also based on your logic, why dont you just change your build for more of a challenege? thats more of what im getting at.
---
Now why did my weapons hit them like wet napkins? They approached me before attacking, they had on leather armor, and not full armor.
---
I don’t get the “it’s too hard ” shit. Nothing other than some pvp and the SBQ solo or imposter sheepsquach maybe are kinda hard. If u play the game a decent amount of time u get everything u need and most of the stuff u want. I love the game and I agree, you can’t make everyone happy so please just do what’s best for the community devs.
---
I would like if they essentially added automatron into 76. Make robots super expensive to make and require a lot of plans and capable of dying, but in turn make them really strong.
---
OP said took 0 damage that pretty much means immune. I've tried all those things and you dont take 0 damage. I have a full set of sentinel/ assassin armor I've tried most everything. I understand the game.
---
Must've missed you. I'll be hopping on again here in a few.
---
They change over at 8pm est time I heard. You gotta log out and back in and should be there.
---
Maybe they all had assassins sentinel or cavalier armor? You can get those pieces for any level though super rare.
---
Funny enough I sold this exact thing today. It was for helping someone build their camp, but that’s how the transaction went down. A 1000 cap bullet
---
If you only think about the base, yeah. But with the energy damage + the mood who boost it, i thought it was alike! Ty anyway
---
Total fucking asshole then, thanks for clarifying.
---
OP is using hyperbole. 
---
Do you really think there are all these cheaters around? How do they go about these ends?
---
The Snallygaster is from Maine and the Wendigo is from the great lakes area. So it wouldn't be to much of a stretch to have the chupacabra in WV
---
Could look on this subreddit for the replies on the thousands of other posts like this ;;)
---
So do that instead of rushing around the world like a chicken with your head cut off.
---
Translation: waaaaa waaaaa waaaaaa my computer is shite waaaaaa waaaaaa I suck at pvp and have 15 points in intelligence and have all the reduced carry weight perks waaaaaa waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
---
I am also on Xbox one and is has been a problem for a while now. So I've taken the time to learn how to line up my curiouser and then I just give it a whack. Works great.
---
Kind of sad video games are still so tribal. We all enjoy the same shit. Doesn't matter what you have between your legs.
---
Where did you find any plans for the X-01?
---
As a woman I was reeeeeally nervous about the voice-only chat in this game. I've played a lot of MMOs and other online games and had some very bad experiences in the past, sometimes just from playing a female avatar and even moreso once my gender was revealed to people. Just gross and uncomfortable and sometimes extremely mean shit. I don't really try to change how I react or what words I use to communicate via text in games like these ("cute" being a staple of my vocab is almost always a giveaway I imagine), but I generally avoid ANY voice chat as things can get very ugly VERY FAST and it is generally a just more visceral experience to deal with.
---
I imagine it is worse on the consoles, but for me (on PC)....I have actually been ***extremely*** pleasantly surprised by this community. I basically never initiate voice chat myself, generally defaulting to emotes until I have to express something complex. Since I'm very into CAMP building, I really want to communicate beyond "hi" and "&lt;3" when the creator of an impressive CAMP fast travels back to see what I'm doing loitering around there...and I want to show them mine and get their thoughts! That's hard to do with emotes.
---
So despite past problems and my general anxiety about opening myself up to that toxic shit....I ***have*** been using the mic and it's really shocked me at how many positive interactions I've had. Granted, some of them have been at little weird, but nothing has been straight up ***bad*** and for that I am thankful. I'm hoping this holds true for the rest of my experience with the game, but I'm probably pushing my luck at this point haha.
---
Booooohoooo
---
they will release the next one at 8pm est all of them will reset like that
---
That's K, I have over a thousand already and on Xbox.....
---
I wish I can quit my job
---
So I missed the 2nd one?
---
I mean, that’s a max level intended zone
---
"The quest can only be completed once, but after it’s finished you can repeat the dungeon as many times as you’d like for even more loot and XP."
---
New Dungeon – The Burrows (Coming April 16)
---
    A new dungeon experience will become available one week following today’s patch, on April 16.
---
    This challenging venture will take you beneath Harper’s Ferry as you follow in the footsteps of the Brotherhood of Steel, who sent their forces underground for unknown reasons.
---
    Even the heartiest of Appalachian adventurers will have difficulty exploring The Burrows alone. Assemble a squad and make sure your gear is up to snuff before taking on this subterranean battleground.
---
I'll grant "end-game raid" are my words, But what they wrote implies it pretty fucking heavily.
---
I just think that while those could be an other places and relocated to WV. A chupacabra is just iconically found in Latin America. But it could be possible, like a West Virginian Chupacabra that’s a unique variation of it.
---
How much you want to make a bet I can throw a mini nuke over them mountains??......yeah..
---
Though I understand where you are coming from (as I was a low level not long ago myself, as we all were), but the door does swing both ways. Though the frustration may be for different reasons, but I need to often server hop when I’m farming because I’ll spawn into Whitesprings or WestTek and it’ll be Level 9 Ghouls or at WestTek, Level 5-15 Super Mutants instead of the usual Level 42 or 68. 
---
But on the other hand, it is quite easy to level up in this game, and perhaps this frustration can incentivize you to work toward leveling up, and getting better equipped to handle the mobs. 
---
All weapons and armor top out at Level 50, so as long as you hit the 50 mark, you can officially utilize every weapon and armor that the game provides. 
---
Teaming up with a high level player is one way to progress quicker also. 
---
I have a handful of newbies that commonly ask to team up with me and I help them out by doing things like draining the health bar on 2 and 3*** Legendary enemies and letting them finish them off or letting them get some shots in first before I take them down. They get the XP and the legendary drops. 
---
I generally don’t trade with newbies anymore because the weapons are simply not affordable to them, but I’m happy to mod their weapons or even drop them the Legendaries I don’t want (1* and some 2** pieces and ammo I don’t need). 
---
Just some food for thought. I’m on XB1. Feel free to look me up if you are too and we can team up sometime.
---
Easy fix. Hazmat suit is just a 'clothing' item with a perk. done and done
---
I just want to spike them like the super mutant do
---
The ultimate yeet
---
If u can toss that gets rid of the fat man witch is sooo easy to get its not funny
---
Launching in 5
---
Would you like a nukashine for your troubles? You'll have to drink it right away.
---
If you are taking damage, you can't fast travel.
---
Do you play rocket league? I swear I've seen your name recently.
---
Maybe later. For now, just use the Other/buffs percentage to increase damage further similar to how those effects would do it.
---
You would to dance with the deathclaws.
---
Already traded for an IE lever and some caps. Thanks for checking in though
---
TOUCHDOWN *BOOM*
---
The worst is whiffing a power attack- lose all the ap and the ghouls claw at you instead of dropping.
---
I believe you mean 10mm.....
---
I’m sorry to hear you’re having that problem. I can Create from the plans I’ve bought, But not the mods I’ve bought.
---
Oh yeah. In my history class we watched Saving Private Ryan and when they started chucking mortar shells I was wondering if they actually did that
---
The state of the game is still West Virginia.
---
I'd just like to know if I'm the last person on a server is all.
---
That's not a very good joke.
---
Nuked.
---
Fair. But PA armor needs to have it's own nerfs then …
---
- slower movement
---
- slower with melee
---
- agility penalty
---
I'd admit though it could have higher damage resistance. It should not be possible to equal DR with regular armor … but it has to have it's measurable tradeoffs
---
You forgot to the put the 'suggestion' tab on your title... ;)
---
Sometimes this sub can reflect that but it’s mostly because we see what the game could be and want it to evolve in a healthy and amazing way. 
---
Still, r/Fallout has its moments. It’s definitely better than that cesspool of “gamers” that can’t form their own opinion of anything over at r/gaming..
---
So... you want to be able to shoot more bullets... but you also complain about not having enough bullets... huh.
---
Bright side. It weights half a pound but will add 5 carry weight in a pinch.
---
I keep a switchblade on my toon when i am just a pound or 2 heavy for fast travel
---
voice chat is crazy bugged
---
if you are lvl 20 do the higher level player a favor and dont joint this event. you do not have the weapons to hurt the beast but you make it harder for them  to kill the beast. level up, bring a lot of ammu with a good weapon and you are welcome to fight the beast.
---
No offense, just a explanation why other players act the way you expirienced them
---
does this affect you ?
---
What platform? I can help if on Xbox.
---
It is almost completely invisible on wood
---
That's awesome. It's a new family bonding experience.
---
For $20 dollars play one radio song on jukeboxes in your camp from the Atomic shop. Or you could pick up the bundle of 2 songs for $100. These items are time limited for 2 minutes so get them now!
---
So you want a handheld, grenade like mini nuke? What should we call it? Mini Grenade? Nuke Grenade? OH I GOT IT! A Nuka-Grenade!
---
IMO, id love to have that as a fatman skin
---
Yeah I could do with one at the moment ;)
---
On it, boss
---
Better but it’s still not in its renaissance era if that’s what you’re looking for... maybe after a few more major updates... check out the roadmap if you want to see what’s planned
---
I know it for metal, marine, trapper, and raider armors. Dunno beyond that; I do have a robot piece that already has brawling on it but I can’t craft it.
---
Nope. Benny shot the courier in New Vegas with a 9mm pistol named Maria.
---
Ok, so I plugged "fallout 76 finding screws" into this thing called "google". And the first four results are all valid.  The third, for me, was actually from reddit, so... yes.   
---
it doesn't hurt to plug shit into google before you ask questions that are this common.
---
Dear Bethesda, 
---
Glad to see someone still has there nose so far up your ass they cant see the sun shine anymore.
---
Report the little shits. Harassment on that level should be a ban. Im stoked to hear females play the game. Those incels wont stop unless ya do something... Walking away is good but standing up for yourself is better in the long run.
---
I’m sure someone can get creative but isn’t PvP off in normal?
---
The fallout Reddit is terrible. I won’t read it.
---
A lot of the first mods for this forum where also mods there. And it was pretty clear they were being selective about how they moderated this forum. 
---
Now they basically just do nothing.
---
Whatever this games faults or issues are. It’s still way better than living your life hating a game so much it makes you into a bitter person.
---
Yeah like liberty prime!
---
Player Vending is essentially the vendorbot you want, it's just a vending machine you fill with stuff from your stash that you set the prices for.
---
It's also, according to the description it has in the files, going to mark your camp on the map when you have the machine turned on.
---
Whoosh good thing I didn't use a password if I'm unsure about the keycard. How do you decode them?
---
There’s s lot of people that come over here from that forum just to troll.
---
I second that!
---
I have rocket league but its been ages since ive played it
---
I haven't had the issue. Have you done the basic troubleshooting steps? (Restarting ect)
---
I have never even seen it once
---
Your turn....deal with it.
---
Im on ps4 but thanks for offering
---
I got a notification that my workshop had been overrun be sheepsquatches. But when I went to the workshop it was just molerats -\_-
---
Let’s start a petition
---
It does more damage than a normal Assaultron blade and weighs like 1/3 a normal one too.
---
Kind of like 3 built in effects at once. So not a terrible reward
---
You have to generate a list of possible words with the letters and then enter each possible number until one works
---
They may be doing this around Christmas to have a 'holiday themed' item. I'd hope so, at least.
---
They did a chrome paint for the mini-gun... not sure if it's still available though.
---
I'll buy it for 1000 caps :D I have 45 nukes waiting to be used.
---
Are you an Indian tech support?
---
Dont worry I thought I got a spider on me. Wont happen again.
---
More powerful than a normal one and weighs less than a normal one too. Not half bad honestly
---
Lol if you did that to me, (like someone else has) I'd just leave the server immediately.
---
I play fallout with with my son every weekend &amp; during holidays, he's a little too young so sticks mainly to the Forrest &amp; potters around building his camp or just watches me play sometimes.
---
He has a really good memory &amp; reminds me what to do next :)
---
Its awesome he can't be griefed now, was ruining it for him.
---
Bought it to put in my bar and cant read it either. Looks like lighted braile. Hope they fix it.
---
this
---
I've logged out and shut down the game and restarted my playstation.  Maybe it will pop up eventually. If not, maybe I'll be spared when all the face-hugging deathclaws come out of their eggs.
---
First one was a success. Here comes round two.
---
Thank you! I’ll PM you my PSN :)
---
heads up and keep on trucking. you are one of a million. kick ass, i would applaud!
---
Cool, yeah, it's vampiric and 25% faster fire rate. I just need to maybe reroll the last * when the Leg Vendor comes out; it's bonus VATS Accuracy for first shot, and that's useless for a gun like this, right?
---
Egg not showing up in the store is generally solved by quitting completely out of the app (or whatever, as you didn't even mention what you're playing on) and restarting it again.
---
Don't let people trying to help you keep you from being a jerk though, you just keep being you.
---
So you bought a used game, previous owner used the code for the extra goodies already, and you are surprised/upset that you don’t get to redeem that code?  
---
Bethesda, Xbox, and rational minds might be able to help- they’d tell you to buy a new copy if you want all the goodies to be included. If there’s some sort of digital code included in any used purchase, assume that it’s been redeemed a long time ago.
---
R/woooosh
---
Had this same experience with some other player. imo... Just disable assassin enchantments on standard world due to how one sided attacks vs pve players.
---
I think if both players have pacifist off they can damage eachother camp. But if you are a pacifist you should be allowed to be that. Wanna destroy camps and not even get a bounty? Go survival.
---
Restart *after* 8pm (an hour from now).
---
This just happened to me. 
---
Quite disappointing
---
The mini nukes are 6lbs
---
Greg Focker : Oh, you can milk just about anything with nipples.
---
Well if it makes you feel any better I kill a shitload of ghoul officers, take the codes but do not use them.....
---
Kinda balances out.
---
/r/AmItheAsshole
---
Wait when did the Institute start making synths?
---
Never seen someone so triggered before
---
Great points. It would be great to have more build budget. FO4 really spoiled us in enabling almost unlimited camp building. Perhaps we should have expected that camps would regress as they transitioned the game engine into online/multiplayer, but for those of us who love building, BGS didn't do enough to reset building expectations for 76. After half a dozen builds, I've finally figured out how to do a massive FO4-like five-floor structure, but 10-20% more budget would go a long way in allowing more lights, pictures, etc., and encourage more Atom Shop purchases for camp items.
---
Thank you, certainly any suggestions welcome!
---
You also get the regular reticle if you shoot one shot and then aim down
---
i'm lvl 154 and still got no tse but i dont care :)
---
Sounds like 700-2000 (if modded and sold to the right person also).
---
Damage/Energy Resistances don't matter in PvP anymore, all weapons do a fixed % of target HP as damage depending on the weapon you are using, and only certain perk cards which give percentage based mitigation like fireproof,dodgy,serendipity work to reduce/evade it.
---
Sentinel,Cavalier(?) and Assassin(?) legendary effects also work to reduce the damage you take and VATS critical hits apparently ignore every single mitigation listed above. 
---
 [https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/b5zo2o/survival\_damage\_testing\_results\_and\_personal/](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/b5zo2o/survival_damage_testing_results_and_personal/) 
---
So if you don't want to use assassin/sentinel armor, auto/semi-auto rifles and a VATS/crit build you are going to have a rough time.
---
Probably Bethesda employees farming legendaries to sell online for cash.
---
That’s sad to hear, I’m a girl and have been playing fallout 76 since it’s launch (on Xbox one) and I’ve never had to deal with anything like this. That’s why I have loved the multiplayer community around fallout 76- there’s a lot less negativity and misogyny than many other gaming platforms, at least in my experience. I always play with a mic (although it’s usually muted until I run into someone else) and have met many men and women through playing 76 and made a few friends along the way. :)
---
The arm mod could be called the "liberty primer"
---
Where exactly do u nuke in Morgan town?
---
Then... Some jerk comes in and kills off your pets for lolz. Unless they put in a "knock out" thing in the game where they are immobilized till after combat or they could be walking perk sticks where they don't fight and can't be attacked.
---
I'm sorry for the way most guys act. I assure you, there's some good guys out here. If you're on ps4, please, add me. I'll back you up in any situation when I'm available. 
---
My psn is Dienowwww1
---
I hope you have a better time
---
What about the enclave command center if you complete that does it decode it for you in the big screen?
---
as a guy i have to apoligize, a lot of guys are jerks and idiots at times. not all of us are like that though and it is a shame you feel you have to play differently because of the meatheads
---
You should see my camp, it’s the cosiest and most homely place in the wasteland :P
---
I think they should be set as essential or just respawn. Or better yet not able to be engaged unless combat is engaged with the player.
---
Really? I'll have to try that out. Sounds dumb as hell, but hey, what can you expect with this game lol.
---
Nice to learn something new though, thanks!
---
*America, Fuck yeah*
---
Ask Polly it wants a scorcher? Then lead out by dangling outside....
---
*WARNING, POTENTIAL SPOILERS*
---
The video URL is;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w41PLINczBU and the timestamp is 18:50
---
That went pretty smooth even tho I kept dying lol
---
My assumption is that they can always tell you that this is avoidable with the trade function (even though it's sometimes annoying) and avoid needing to give items back because of server crashes.
---
Eventually when they release the code letters
---
That would be fun! The space station is looming just waiting to be explored.
---
Me want
---
Beta player as well here. If a game has this many issues and I’m still playing daily no matter how bad it gets it’s because the good parts of the game outweigh the bad
---
I want the eyes to be yellow without the lights being on...
---
Also be untouchable unless the player presses the "attack" command that's also a good way to prevent collateral damage.
---
Or at least set them on the ground and shoot them. Maybe make bombs out of them with trip wires.
---
#YOU LOAD 16 TONS. WHAT DO YOU GET?
---
#NUCLEAR BLASTS AND TONS OF DEATH
---
I have nipples. Can you milk me?
---
i think one of them found me on a FO76 discord server.
---
But that will be the answer 100% in the command center after all the codes?
---
It’s why my friend carries explosives. Excessive amounts of explosives
---
VATS thing doesn't sound like the best effect for this kind of gun but I'd at least try it and so what happens.
---
Game haters tend to stalk people that like the game
---
Box mods are bugged since last patch. Wait for fix.
---
They need to release the single color power armor paints from Fallout 4. Either individually for cheap or just sell them as a bundle
---
If your on ps4 ill hold you to that!
---
I haven’t played in a while. Gonna start again and try out some if that Nuka-Shine I keep hearing about
---
These challenges are much easier to complete than the first few. Especially the first one.
---
Ah damn I’m on Xbox!
---
Now all I need is a pen/paper.
---
Cool but no one cares, just play the game
---
I've only done it one, but I think the town has its own icon that looks like building. That is where I pointed the nuke.  I've seen others nuke morgantown too but can't remember how they did it.
---
This makes it possible to make floating structures again aslong as the first foundation is touching the ground. I like this.
---
If your that hungry eat some mole rat
---
I'd pay 5k for it unmodded.
---
Actually, if you are interested on sellling it, and are on PC let me know hehe
---
It's pretty solid and not too difficult to get. The mirelurks were a pain, just because I had to wait for swarm of suitors to start. Otherwise pretty easy.
---
yeah.  people been losing power armor pieces a lot recently.  i made a post about this.  got a reply from a MOD saying that duped items were removed, again, on april 9th.  well, my loses happened after that fact.  MOD had no idea what they were talking about.  some times got to wonder about these so called MODS.  beginning to think some of them are "tweeners"  HA HA HA!!
---
It’s quick.
---
That removal wouldn't do what he's talking about. They deleted all but 1 on each person who had it. If he only had the 1 piece it would still be there, duped or not.
---
thanx!!!
---
A classic sasquatch would be awesome!
---
lazy OP.  -1
---
Been saying that for 2 years. Now look at me crush these video games.
---
Do you not know what a gun is sir?
---
If you were able to catch them and throw them back and forth, that would be the makings of an amazing world event
---
NUKABALL! :D
---
I'm in now, hopped servers a few times, haven't had any lag or crash issues (PC).
---
I’m on PS4, a girl, and I have my mic available if I want or need to use it. If someone decides to try and mess with me, I usually just walk away. People who have issues with lady gamers are idiots, and that is their problem to fix, not mine :) 
---
Keep your head up and keep playing! Don’t let idiots keep you from enjoying yourself :)
---
should i call the Kolchak the Night Stalker?
---
The quest was terrible but I like looting it. Needs to be a hot legendary drop spot.
---
Well, on paper the hunting rifle should hit harder, but there could be something up with it. I’ve been trying to get a bloodied explosive hunting rifle and compare it to my bloodied explosive lever, hopefully I will and can test it for myself and found out for sure.
---
I'm fairly convinced they didn't expect people to get so attached to their builds, yet honestly besides learning the lore building a wicked camp is probs my favourite thing to do. Now that randoms can stumble across it having cool aesthetics feel much more meaningful.
---
" I don't like that people have found a way to access the only true end game content two extra days a week" shouts asshole on the internet?   
---
Who is HARMED by extra nuke zones? What harm does this "Cheat" do?
---
BTW, I've seen what people think of Oxhorn, I still like him, don't judge pls...
---
If you're looking to sell, I would be more than willing to buy or trade it off of you
---
They did it when the mortar tubes got too hot and/or the enemy was too close to use the tubes.
---
How many eggs have been released so far? I have two but I'm worried I missed one
---
Yeah that'd be great.
---
I am pretty sure they upped the damage armour takes too... I've repaired my armour more times in the last few days than I have in the last few months!
---
My partner and I play together often and rarely run into any issues. Though we often just use a private party and don't use the area chat. Sometimes we do, but generally find it to be more pleasurable that way.
---
For now, there's a cool liitle mod called Workbench Repair Fix that you can use in the meantime ;)
---
Indeed.
---
Good for low level characters. Not very good for end game because you will need stimpacks. Mutation only works while not in combat.
---
The atomic shop should sell Jay Cutler skins that cause your mini nukes to go wildly off course. Charge 1800 atoms and it will be more value than Jay Cutler ever provided.
---
Ive said it a million times but here we go again
---
MICHIGAN DOG MAN.
---
there's been "sightings" in west virginia. Boom. Done. Give me my harry potter and the prisoner of azkaban style werewolf/dog man and ill be happy.
---
I am sad when any container is empty.
---
I second this. It would be a great way to track how active a server is before you start certain events like Encryptid, so you know beforehand whether you'd be wasting your time or not
---
It's actually a fairly old saying for something that is useless, or worthless.  "that's about as useless as a screen door on a submarine" or "that's about as useless as a helicopter with an ejection seat" etc.
---
If I stayed off the mic, I wouldn’t have met my huge group of guy friends on Fallout 76.
---
This sounds like a cool idea!
---
We need another event for the Nuke Football League. PA vs Super Mutants.
---
I just wish they would make it a no build zone
---
Where did you buy plans for the X-01?
---
I'll let the op speak for themselves. If they want to clarify it as hyperbole then I'll accept it.
---
There are a lot of cheaters in online PC games. There was an article on one still active in a game as dead as titanfall 1. I'm not going to search out hacks because everyone knows they exist in every PC game.
---
Yup. Twisted muscles works for 1h and 2h (and I think ALSO applies to unarmed)
---
Thanks. I made the original idea a while back but it pulled a Houdini. So here hoping it can grow.
---
I second that I want this guys stuff for free.
---
I lost all of my mutations one evening. Totally my fault. When I bought serums the next day, I opted for it. It's great. I only eat and drink to maintain those requirements. Stimpacks in battle.
---
Its a non cosmetic item. Those should never be added to the atom shop.
---
Hit em with that Tony Bomb-o
---
Good work though. About 7 min. Thanks.
---
This. Anti armor is a massive waste if you already have Incisor and Spikes mod. Instigating Swing Speed means you’re one hitting lots of enemies, faster than otherwise.
---
This sounds like an epic game of hot potatoe
---
Yanno, I JUST hit level 53 today and I have only seen one suicider. I feel kind of sad about it and idk why. I just like to blow shit up I guess. 
---
But when my boyfriend was playing he saw them a bunch! Wtf?!?!
---
[](/kcelestiacute)Is there any dog food in there?
---
Any of you dudes ever watch Mountain Monsters? The show itself is dumb as hell, but it takes place in West Virginia and features a slew of potential cryptids.
---
Personally, I’d love to see Hogzilla make an appearance in Fo76.
---
2*? SS is a good role. On xb1, expect 2-3k.
---
I don't think it's too far fetched to believe some alien action is coming eventually..perhaps in the form of a limited time event..?
---
You can already milk Brahmin, and have them in your camp via a Brahmin feeder. Not sure where I got the schematics to build one, but they're out there.
---
Yes sir! Stormy Stephen is my GT
---
I'm in the flame paint x01, I do pretty heavy damage when I can get right up to her. Staying alive is tough lol
---
maybe... Did you happen to find anyone named Giles?
---
I've been running around everywhere with a dual bar flaming chainsaw trying to see what enemy I can't take down with it. The novelty of it hasn't worn off for me yet, ymmv.
---
Reduces your Chems by 50%
---
I'd like to to daisy chain them together with a trip mine at my base.
---
Yea I am not sure what they were thinking dropping a limited time event out of the blue, I didn't even know this existed before hopping on reddit today.  Announce a daily 24 hour limited item the day it goes live....yea....smart.
---
Hopefully there will be a way for us to get the first egg again.  I am not holding my breath though.
---
My camp is on a mountain just behind Whitesprings with a hell of a view. Now I don't use turrets because I want to maximize my camp budget but even if I did, they would be no where near in range. I for one would not like this decision. I am happy with where my camp is.
---
Short version: fix the core features before you dare release another Atomic Shop update, becazse your game is a complete meme.
---
Or take it as the poison you've made us swallow pours out:
---
I used to play 76 like a maniac, love the world, the lore, the design, but the quality of the content and technical management in this game is completely messed up beyond comprehension: base core gameplay features are being mutilated patch after patch! Look it up devs: patches should be fixing things, not breaking them! Right now each brings perhaps 1 fix and 2+ new broken core game functions... Plus it's sickening how strong the Atomic Shop is being pushed while the Challenge system is both broken for dailies, weeklies, and account-bound.
---
Dear Bethesda, seriously, this is becoming a fiasco on the scale of Gearbox' Aliens Colonial Marines or I don't even know: a completely new low!  
---
We are adding subreddit after subreddit, opening Discord server after server to keep up with holding together the community and figure substitute features to add chat and trading as a 3rd party solution to this lacking mess, as is, but really, core features gone just like that...?
---
Modding - broken.
---
Repairing - broken.
---
Challenges - broken.
---
Takes 2 minutes to load fully within the gameworld Checkpointed Checkpointed etc just so we can deploy a Power Armor and/or Fast Travel to our CAMPs (meanwhile this lagfiesta we can be shot at and killed)....
---
Crashing out on consumables.
---
Crashing out of the game on exit.
---
Massive render-bugs with unrendered textures or I don't even know what I see ingame anymore.
---
UI and general item/stash management is getting worse with every update, the amount of trash we gotta shovel through just shows that the designated test-group never got beyond Level 10 or something and only had a single hour to play.
---
70% of the necessary features for this type of game: missing.
---
Logic behind items being instanced in the world, whether its client- or server-side: a total mess, even worse with "dungeons" such as the Burrows.
---
Do I have to quote "a riot is the language of the unheard" for this pitiful videogame, for real?
---
Congratulations on becoming EA. Anthem, Mass Effect Andromeda, and this, would make a lovely trio. Everytime I'll need salt I'd just take a look at the cover.
---
I really was one of the people who could just avoid getting my enthusiasm broken by leveling alt after alt with new builds but this is effecting everything now.
---
Rolling back to Patch 6 would be the best damn idea at this point, but of course you can't, because you care way too much about your precious Atomic Shop content - the kinda stuff that we can't even mostly preview after purchase, it just shows up as blank in the list of items. Or how those items in preview show up as different skins.
---
I'd flip my table and scream but the wall is behind it for a reason.
---
Anything that makes my house more magnificent is welcome in my book
---
Pets need to be refined. I pacified one but it still turned red bar when i tamed it. If pacified after taming they stay passive and can be killed even by a rat. But with red bar they can be vats-ed by assholes players.  
---
My concern are the player that kill pets. They obviously see the tag beside the name,but it doesn't stop them from killing them. revenge is good but doesn't bring pets back.
---
Finally i want to tame a fog crawler. I love that creature since far harbor,but they can't even be pacified by either perk. What are they? Animals?wastland creature?Mangos?
---
It might be an echo chamber but thinking this game doesn't have any major flaws is foolish
---
not yet :)  but will definitely keep my eyes open for that name now..
---
I'm wondering about vault tec University maybe..?
---
Lol, I didn't think of those. I have 5 ot those stashes at different buildings for the homeless shelter I help run.
---
I would like to throw anything. Fuck the arcade and the basketball hoops for taunting me. We should be playing horse
---
I don't think I'll be using it, as nice as it is. I'm set up more for heavy weapons with a side of melee.
---
Would take 50 levels to move my build over to something more crit oriented. XD
---
What do you reckon this puppy is worth. As I said, new to trading on here.
---
They should have just been in the game at launch. Being sold by vendors as mods. Im not paying 8 dollars for a re color
---
Touch football at Grafton school!!!
---
I have a BE Minigun, but I don't need caps. Would exchange it for something else, if you have anything equally good to offer.
---
Aren't they more related to cats?
---
I can. Add me: theaimpolice4. I can give you some items as well
---
Go to WestTec, theres always a suicide there, only one tho. Theres a bunch of Legendary super mutants there too, at least 2 or 3 everytime I go there.
---
Would 50 stimpaks and 500 caps do it for you?
---
Nothing to do with the terminal but.. While I was server hopping a random spawn location I found a Brahmin with the ‘mysterious quills’ like on the random quests. We’re getting closer
---
I have the mods, like ones you can attatch. But it says, "Do you want to attatch this mod?" I click yes but nothing happens.
---
&gt; As much as I enjoyed older Bethesda games
---
Which games were those if I may ask?
---
I had a server earlier throw up a maintenance message after being on for about an hour.  No disconnects for me yet tonight though.
---
8 slots and i'll take it
---
Run it if you have class freak 3.
---
Dibs on the monster as my linebacker
---
No, yes.
---
Do you think it's more reasonable to ask for a way to cure a specific mutation, or for them to actually fix this? Honestly I'd be happy to give up grounded if I didn't already buy 12k caps in mutation serums.
---
So far I've been very lucky.  Granted, I had a couple of dudes who were jerks.  One started destroying my camp so I killed him.  The other just started saying "n-word" at me.  And yes, just "n-word" not the actual n-word.  It wasn't gendered although I don't know what the motivation was.  However, most of the time I meet players with or without a mic and they were generally incredibly helpful.
---
One player invited me on a team to help with a difficult area in which I kicked butt.  Another guy was helping his brother level up and asked if I wanted to join which I did.  Fallout 76 is the ONLY game I've ever used a mic with and my first multi-player as I generally avoid it but so far, I've been insanely lucky.  Although I may have jinxed myself.
---
Haven’t failed one yet, I’ve been through like 8.... I just built a tank loadout for my lowhealth HW/PA build and I’m amazed at how well it worked. 64 health but I only died once and I held aggro from the imposter for a lot of the fight. Usually I die like 3-6 times. Blocker, dodgy, serendipity, suppressor, 2 pts of life giver, health buff from food, emergency protocols torso, and Empath from a second account (although those last two are always a thing for me). Vampire LMG for regen, bloody 50cal when full health. I may bring a suppressor 50cal next time and try that, massive damage output loss, but cumulatively like 40% damage nerf to the target.
---
Man, they keep doing so much wrong with this game that it's like they're purposely trying to drive away their player base. I can't even talk about other titles of the series because this game has given it such a bad name.
---
I'm usually on a team with my husband or a couple of guys I know personally- very rarely do I go on mic while solo. People can be downright disgusting! I feel ya. But don't let the assholes turn you away. I'm starting to go mic more and more as I run into better players.
---
Hope is one hand, shit in the other. See which one fills up faster.
---
I've not had any issues, maybe it's on your end? Check background downloads?? Connection speed?
---
What achievement?
---
That's hyenas
---
Pretty sure they're using the scrub definition of 'hacked' to mean 'did something on the computer I don't understand and I don't like.'
---
Ok I can play soon.
---
What platform? I’m on PC, I might have an extra, I’ve finished all quests on 2 characters and am about to do it on a 3rd now that I just got him to 50.
---
I would say over all it's in good shape.  There are still issues and bugs but it keeps getting better over all.  Plenty of content is on the way and I'm confident that the game will keep getting better.
---
8?
---
No problem. I'll be on in the next 20 minutes or so
---
Liberty prime as my QB.
---
Damn dude who just sells one of those to the vendor?? My buddy literally bought that same one for 7k the other day
---
I’ve seen quite a few camps dotted around the golf course which are nowhere near the back of the clubhouse.  I would imagine they are placed there to be central to the map.  
---
The owners would be a bit annoyed in having to move cos of some moron(s) parked right at the back.  Perhaps the “safe zone” could the extended a little bit but still leave areas that can be built?
---
Now? PA plans. I’ve gotten some other mod plans that are otherwise nearly impossible to find, but they aren’t all that interesting. Medium NV scope for a combat rifle, anyone? Yeah.
---
Yep camps in Whitesprings call for orbital strikes
---
Please. I love giving my useless (to me) legendarys to random lower level players.
---
Who gives a shit about upvotes? Solid post, btw
---
It only shows wanted players or those with the top 3 player kills on the map. 
---
If you don’t kill anybody, you shouldn’t show up at all. Just avoid the hotspots—train stations, Vault 76–and you should be ok. Stash your junk regularly and only carry the aid you need just in case.
---
I’ve used Daisy one time and that’s it. Stocked up on fusion cores a few weeks ago at Poseidon. Someone came along just as I was getting ready to sign off and one shot (because to Bethesda we are all wearing paper machete armor) me as I was inviting him to team so he could have the workshop. He messaged me back sorry and watched my stuff.  I came back got my stuff. He invited me to team I whipped out Daisy and BOOM. He started dying laughing. 
---
Just felt frisky. It was a light hearted little murder both sides.
---
Omfg I’m glad I’m not the only one! I fucking LOVE BLOWING UP CARS IT MAKES ME SO HAPPY! And fuel tanks AND oxygen tanks! Those ones are the best because like a couple seconds after they explode, the gas inside them ignited into one big orange cloud and then clears right up it’s so cool!!! Lol
---
yes. Perk loadout manager has 12, but i think 12 is enough
---
I have traveling pharmacy what do I do? I'm over my stash limit also
---
As a product of a single father, change it up sometimes. Go up on the wrung, not everyone's got a mom or a dad but they all got grandparents(dead or alive) that would be distraught. Little bastards.
---
What is this manager?
---
Omg wouldn’t that be awesome!!!!
---
Launching 2nd one.
---
Excellent tool for trading, you can see what is better before you buy.
---
Totally need to add the Sledgehammer in the list.
---
Ha!
---
mod that allows you to swap perk loadouts
---
If it’s for free, then it’s for me!
---
Or that’s what my dad always used to say, God rest his soul
---
Foxes, coyotes, jackles, dingos, wolves all belong to the canidae family.
---
whats your twitch
---
#COMMUNISM IS THE VERY DEFINITION OF FAILURE
---
I want an automatic Brahmin milker, because milking it by hand doesn't guarantee it. I didn't know about the Brahmin feeder but that can be used with the milker instead of feeding them with the machine.
---
Deftestbred45 i am streaming rn
---
Ha! hello pyro friend
---
Well, actually its there to keep the server from crashing. Too many items per stash would make the game crash, they stated that themselves before the first storage update even came out.
---
lol
---
Ah. Tbh 3 feels fine. One for combat, one for crafting and one for utility. They aren’t locked for hose roles but just a default name. Plus 3 would fit better on all platforms.
---
I can see this actually being put in the game. Just make them a type of grenade, give a custom throwing animation, and touchdown!
---
Instigating power fist with puncturing mod on my new level 50 unarmed dude is listed for 300+ damage. Or 600 on first hit.
---
The only way would be to buy him PS or Xbox gift cards
---
Foxes are part of famile Canidae, which also includes dogs, wolves, coyotes, dingos, and jackals.
---
Treazul is correct in that hyenas are a branch off of suborder Feliforma, having their own family Hyaenadae, and are most likely what you are recalling.
---
Yes it seemsike the right side of the sign is "sunken" or something and the lighting isn't that visible (although I haven't seen it at night)
---
You need concrete
---
This has been my experience too :) I started playing this game with major social anxiety and now I always play with a mic and love coming across someone else that is happy to talk.. I’ve made a few new friends of both genders and it’s been really nice!
---
I’m on tonight if you jump on anytime
---
Huh...TIL
---
I remember in fallout 4 i stored so many items it lagged the game lol.
---
800 pounds is all I can have of equipment. That’s just not enough when most weapons weigh 10+ pounds plus I really don’t think that the type of storage implemented would crash the game if there’s only a few people. I stored thousands of items in fallout 4 and it didn’t lag
---
idk, i use 7 on my main now, and have one more build in mind
---
I completely agree.
---
The things I want to see most are the tall junk walls, spike barricades, and those really tall windmills.  I tend to see those things in almost every Raider camp.
---
They seem more scrappy and thrown together which I really like.
---
Yeah, fallout 4 is saving everything to YOUR system. All the stuff you save in 76 is stored on a server.
---
Would I be able to wear the outfit and eye in power armor with the buff?
---
Not sure it's possible to mod it at the moment, given that bug.
---
I'd like to go ahead and apologize in advance in case your child ends up seeing all the giant neon swear words plastered onto my camp walls
---
Oh. That’s a fair point. I still think though that 800 pound is definitely not enough. I’ll delete the post
---
It can't be done currently, holotapes are tied into another setting, sfx I think, they should have their own bar, but Bethesda doesn't believe in such things
---
There are ways to add a 4th star.
---
Best spammer gets power armor?
---
Do you want to use mics or no. Its fine by me either way.
---
