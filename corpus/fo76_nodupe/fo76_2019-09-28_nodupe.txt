No it's not I haven't played adventure mode in weeks because i'm trying to get to overseerer rank 100.

[removed]
---
Yes. That’s the point. Tool chest, stone benches, disco ball, radiation emmitter and a few others. You can sell them 1k+ in your vendor and they will absolutely fly out of there. Should get enough until the event ends to be set on caps for a long time.
---
My TSE usually can get 3 or 4 SBQs before it breaks.
---

---
Are you neglecting Gunsmith and Luck of the Draw?
---
I remember something about the disease burning people from the inside and either they petrify or become ghouls. Who got infected and didn't turn? That's the reason everyone is dead.
---
Anyone who didn't have the infection got killed by the scorched afaik.
---
Is it really a problem building your camp on the event? I’ve been solo on 3 primal events and it gets pricey for us noobs - lvl 36 - against multiple level 38 rad scorpions (still haven’t finished wave 3 at ash heap). It’s a bummer to be doing these alone.
---
Dunno, once saw him not more than a year ago with Fess Parker who was wearing a coon skin cap at the time.  Was down around KY I think...
---
Yeah, I recently lost an AAE galing laser after trading two good BE heavies so it's nice to be able to help when someone else suffers the same problem.
---
I live way out in the sticks(mire) so that I can avoid everyone forever, and hunt radstags in peace.
---
Ps4, standard. It seems like everyone is just like "oh nothing EVER happens to me, so its not happening to you, must be your playstation and network connection!" and its not, trust me, its not. No other game gives me this problem, just Fallout 76.
---
It wouldnt be the first time ive had a problem that seems unique to me, check my post history-- ive reported issues that had to be picked up before.
---
You mean the 3k people that barely play this game? lol
---
Im telling you its not my network connection, or the playstation. No other game gives me this issue, and i play online only games quite extensively with no problems.
---
Ps4, doesnt give me problems playing any other games. Just this one.
---
No horde events except the forest one.
---
New Atom Cats boilers!
---
i've had issues that pop up that are not widespread, but ARE issues I've had to report to bethesda before and they've addressed. Just because its not happening to you...
---
I don’t even look at plans anymore because all I see I don’t have is s’mores an 45 jet packs. A guy got crazy with me saying that my prices were to low and I was killing the economy of the game. I only charge 250 for stable violet flux and lower on all the others. He told me my prices were to low on my weapons and armor. “ you can get 15k for that 2* exploding pipe rifle, I was selling it for 1000. I can’t make this stuff up lol.
---
Yeah, you really have no idea how big Bridge Day really is. People come from all over the world to base jump off one of the premiere arch bridges on Earth. It's a very cool event and is only around 1 day a year.
---
Lmfao you know how easily you could shoot a wall down. I've been killed hundreds of times while I was in a teammates fortress.
---
It must be working if their doing it.
---
I'm entitled? I would figure i would be if i paid money to play this POS. and i did. Full price.
---
It was that dickhead in the mire wasn't it? That shit pissed me off. I went to the silo to drop a Nuke on him and he left while I was mid way through...
---
Not sure how people are finding it normal that level 62 enemies are spawning to attack a level 17.
---
Just to be clear, these are relatively low-level quests in normal zones I had already explored.  Outside the building I entered I was taking on level 5, level 10 and \*maybe\* level 15 enemies.  Then I go inside and still there are level 5s and 10s.  There is NO indication whatsoever that I am somehow doing a quest "out of my league".  I'm just following the very natural flow of the main quest, going where it tells me etc. and all the enemies up to this point are at a manageable level.
---
But while I'm progressing inside the building gleefully blowing away mutants and ghouls, BANG out of nowhere a level 62 jumps out of nowhere and 1-shots me.  I respawn, wait for him to pass and advance, then to my dismay I realize the entire room is full of level 62 enemies that can all kill me in like 2 hits.
---
NO, this is NOT my fault for "not being ready" or being "undergeared" or something.  This is absolutely atrocious game design.  HORRIBLE design.  You can't just coddle a player with level 5s and 10s and then pull the rug out from under them instantaneously and hit them with level 62s.  
---
There was absolutely no indication WHATSOEVER anywhere in the quest dialogue or quest interface which would suggest that I'm not supposed to do this quest yet...  I've played these kinds of games my entire life.  I'm not a moron.  I don't bite off more than I can chew, and I don't run into high level zones unprepared.  
---
There is literally nothing that could have prepared me for this.  AT ALL.
---
I find it bizarre that people here are putting the onus on ME for not knowing (using my magical powers of reading the future?) that all my quest mobs would instantly transform into skull-level enemies and kill me instantly, IN THE MIDDLE OF THE FREAKING QUEST ZONE, WHILE I AM QUESTING.
---
Awful.
---
Setting up camp in the bog and going on patrol taking down "Bravos" really does feel like picking up their mantle.   I just think that the whole BoS aesthetic  feels a bit stale to me. I would have really loved some more Thunder themed gear. BoS t-60 just makes me feel like some other generic brotherhood dude.
---
Prime events happen more often so they are a better source. 15 free every hr plus what ever tge dangerous beast drops.
---
The hoard events can take you all over so it's just a way to reduce clutter. They come back when it's over.
---
Yea that should be happening if your still that low of a level
---
It's not that it isn't. Those are just areas where it's easy for low-level players to stumble into those areas.
---
Taking damage stops the healing over time.
---
So far 3 or 4 legendary mobs have attacked my place. 1 time a 3* bloodbug flew in the front door while i was building. Worth the hassle. Every time I'm thinking I'm tired of replacing the walls anotger comes and so i stay.
---
Yeah when they 'll remove survival ,standard runs will be harder and expert only limited to groups from the same continent ,in the perfect server,and saturn aligned 36 degree from the sun.
---
It seems the prime events rarely actually spawn a legendary. The horde events are pretty easy once you know what spawns where. And a lot of the times you get lucky and go directly to the boss. They really need to fix the issue of the boss dying by other creatures though. I'd much rather have that chance at a three star every ten minutes than the slog that is meat week.
---
What level do you suggest for the quest where you go into a mine and get that anti-scorch pistol? Cause I remember that place spawning lvl 50+ mobs after I touched an ultracite vein I had noticed in the area.
---
Hey, I'm very interested in buying any extra meat week plans you have available... Especially the tenderizer, if you have it.
---
To prevent players from hanging outside of the ring for ages with a bunch of stims.
---
(Shakes tip jar)
---
that’s supposed to be how the Purveyor got into the station
---
I've been wanting this for so long, I was so dissapointed when I found out they just inexplicably played classical music
---
xbox pc or ps4?
---
I prefer Showerthesda but actually like Thalenia explained, taking damage stops the healing, it helps prevent people hoarding all the stims from surviving a nonstop barrage.
---
Once you Prime it it should be a great weapon against the SQB given how cheap it is to make large quantities of Ultracite .308.
---
Guys..if ya wannabe really make a difference..get some chally feed..put out fires and scoop the poop and clean rotten leftovers  oh yeah add some wood too lol
---
You don't have to ruin your adventure mode camp. Just take over a workshop, and build whatever you want there, and blueprint it. No need to move or change your camp at all. You even get free-budget from the workshop, so it costs less.
---
I'm pretty sure the reduced weight applys even when modded.  I have a modded Super sledge as well as a heavily modded minigun and the weight hardly changes due to the 90% reduction. Whatever he's dealing with is either a glitch or another alternative reason is cause when you put it into a storage container, it'll often read the full normal weight of it, even if there's a legendary effect to it or a perk that reduces weight
---
Nah, there are some places that have what look very much like bomb craters and also radioactive, theres one fairly close to the monorail elevator for a start. 
---
As for the random encounter bomb, it gives radioactive material / mininukes, only seen a couple since like beta so I forget, but if you cut the wrong wire it goes nuclear, tiny mushroom cloud and all.
---
I am not sold on Graham being in charge of the Appalachia Radio, he kind of serves his purpose, . Mind you it would be nice to include him with others, on some kind of talk radio program.  
---
The radio station needs a new radio personality, kind of like Wolf Man Jack.  Could call him Scorched Man Jack. Lol. He could have interviews, and or, announcements, podcasts, with Graham, and other key NPC's with in the game, once every couple hours for 15min, and then it switches back to music content for the the other 1/45min.
---
 I would also like to see  at least 4 hrs of mixed music content, to give you a better variety of music, the current music play list is kind of repetitive, and needs a announcer, at the least! To break up the monotony. Nothing says blow your brains out, after hearing praise the lord and pass the ammunition out, every 10min....... It is kind of like the Grafton Mayor, over, and over again. Just my thoughts, from one musician, to another. 
---
I wish you, and everyone the best.
---
I'll definitely do that when I have the prime receiver plan. Thanks for the idea.
---
The prize bot that give you 10 billion pounds of useless paper.
---
Okay. But for the record, I offered.
---
The comment I came here for
---
anything New vegas would be a major plus
---
Well keep in mind I didnt state this as a permanent thing either he could still travel around and broadcast
---
This happened to me to me for the first time yesterday (in the savage divide) and I’ve been at the same location for 50 levels, before that I was in the forest and it happened regularly. I’m kinda pissed because I feel like someone visited my vending machines and decided to place their camp there, as well. It *is* a pretty sweet spot but I don’t want to play the server hop game. 
---
Considering scrapping my machines for more budget space since I price my stuff pretty low and don’t make much anyway.
---
Do that while there's four other people shooting you.
---
What about behind cover not taking damage and when you take a stim it just give you a slice of health?
---
House keeper bot coming to atom store it only cost 5000 atom!
---
Not everyone does that. The map gets smaller and if everyone lives you will eventually fight together.
---
Ill have to take another look then thanks mate.
---
Let me guess, it was in the courthouse in Charleston and you did not read what it said when you clicked to enter?
---
I’d rather they just require Purified Water than Boiled Water for all these recipes.
---
Just replace Boiled Water with Purified everywhere in the game, or require it only for low level (e.g. The Forest) food/drink recipes as Purified Water isn’t as easy to get at low levels whereas you can’t get rid of it fast enough at high levels.
---
Xbox
---
As far as I know you can do it whenever you have Technical Data in your inventory
---
And? I still try to shoot a wall down even if there's tons of people by me, if it means being able to clear a way for my teammates to kill them then I do it. 
---
Also sometimes you can simply run away.
---
He murdered my pet megasloth. He deserves only death.
---
Never had any problem at that one, unless you count lots of xp as a problem. Just chose one of the easier locations if you can't handle it there. Problem solved.
---
Welcome to the Wasteland
---
Haha yep. Guess so
---
Or a mother effing plastic utensil.
---
ATOM BOMB BABY YOU'RE AN ATOM BOMB
---
I sincerely hope you filed a support ticket with Beth.
---
What they need to do is figure out a way to link out our Spotify or Prime accounts into our pip boys!
---
depends on your other options and if it' has other effects in addition to furious.
---
I hang onto one. Mostly because it’s the only legendary LMG I’ve found and it’s better than a vanilla one. It’s fire rate lets the hit bonuses stack quickly.
---
Indeed! Any encouragement to move (often) is a good idea
---
Nope
---
Oof.
---
I go through forced changes monthly.
---
But I'm stubborn and just change it to a variation of the original (morningwood0917)
---
I had it for 7 years before I started this game and Microsoft is making hella money off of it. Oh well.
---
I’ve always thought of my operation as like being a bit like graham. I’m all over the place!  Great idea. 👌
---
‘Bout tree fiddy.
---
Show us the facts to back up this 3k people claim. Until then, quit pulling numbers out of your ass trying to be a cool edge lord.
---
This is going to have a net positive effect on the game in the long run. CAMP locations will become more diverse and fewer people will experience issues placing CAMPs when logging in.
---
That would be awesome. Stop people from requesting everyone's most used weapons in trade screens. Haha
---
Thats cool, was the low level camp in Cranberry Bog set up in one of the train cars?
---
Same, I much prefer wandering, exploring, seeing the sights rather than just sitting at my CAMP waiting for people to come to me, this would add a way for people to find me, and know that I want to sell them stuff, or buy some of their stuff!
---
Int seems to effect the learning curve for scrapping, sitting next to someone with half the int, both starting from the same point I learned 30% more than he did..
---
HalaluYaH
---
thanks, last question, partial cores or full ones?
---
exactly, it'd be great to have the ability to say: these items are for sale for this price at all times. And they could implement the CAMP vendor style hover over menu so people could know ahead of time the types of things for sale
---
The recipe / COBJ is indicated in each example, pulled from the '76 ESM.  
---
Mirelurk Jerky does? I'll check into that!
---
How can you tell it's not an alt? 
---
I always drop a bunch of food and purified water but can never tell if it's just to some guy with his own fully furnished camp on his main.
---
I'm not again of it. Only because it's crazy hard to aim. The shots go everywhere
---
Take an upvote.
---
Yoo joe?
---
Yes run away from the gaint wooden fortress when the only way out is the storm.....
---
Try not to hid on the meat hanging or the stairs. The radscorpions will sit and wait under ground the whole time and travel out the 90+ units. 
---
Also given that’s the hardest one by more the extra is worth it.
---
Bobbleheads and magazines sell pretty well because of the display cases
---
I was legit unaware that you could pick your camp up without placing it down somewhere else ....
---
This. I love mine. Named it “Head Cannon” 😋
---
Yes. This.
---
I could care less what other people are saying, Im reporting a problem that I'm having. If they arent having it, good for them and you.
---
It's the blueprint function, make a blueprint of what parts you want and you can quickly place it down.
---
I ran into a travling vendor. Excavator armor and stocked with all weight reduction perks. He would walk the train lines and road to buy and sell stuff to players. Bought a bunch of bulk lead from him. Too funny and pretty cool.
---
Bring a tesla
---
I wouldn't mind if they replaced all molerats with deathclaws.
---
Mine is east of the top of the world at one of the lakes. At first I rebuild it as I followed the main quest, but I got a really nice house there now that I didn't want to tear down. The location is also rather good, as it's a convenient fast travel location, I have the train station vendor close by and now there's a prime cuts event just a few meters away, so more people check out my vending machines when they're already there.
---
Nope, you got to scrap the lot and start fresh for the extra room, done this quite a few times
---
I refer you to my farewell. 
---
So long and thanks for all the fish 👍
---
😱 you're a monster !
---
Literally scrap not even store/move camp? I thought it was based on the camp metal machine thing being slapped down? Does it give you much more? Or noticeably more from 5-50? Cheers for replying by the way and not overlooking this post it’s been racking my brain
---
That is a thing, like you can't target certain brahmin and other event players. But cats are considered hostile ...
---
NOTHING BLOCKS THEM... just wait for the timer. So what you’re doing is a douche bag move over something stupid.
---
Damn dude just try like the rest of us. If you die then next match, but you may win. Better to try and fail then not at all.
---
It would be. But a censor would need to be in place and filter out some bad words/names.
---
Mines on it in the forest. You don’t need the drum to do it. All it does is just start it faster... can’t be patient? Then go to another server
---
Plot twist: Chally's been doing the talking the entire time, and is just a really skilled ventriloquist.
---
As soon as I see a machine with high overpriced items I usually stop looking and take off...
---
I get it on some items maybe... but that’s a very small number...
---
Does it count if I wear my power armour ?
---
This is getting so ridiculous. The other day I logged in and it couldn’t place my camp and I chose to stay bc I didn’t need it for what I was doing. I was in my camp when I logged out so I was in the area. Checked the map and there were no other camps around? Anybody else seen this?
---
Still what might be really nice is a way to hide weapons in my inventory that are currently in use and definitely not for sale. Out of sight out of mind. 😊
---
Ok? So it’s an easy survival game. I agree they need to up the difficulty somehow.
---
I'd say leave the Appalachia radio without a host, then create two new stations for each faction. Same music, but with DJs.
---
Yeah I feel like OP is just a shit drums player ;)
---
Dunno what to tell you. I rarely get disconnected.
---
Even cazadores
---
https://youtu.be/HB5Zfj5Q2U4 - That's my Bloodied Melee Build
---
https://youtu.be/bibpUKW6cgU - That's my Heavy Gunner Alternative Build.
---
I do tons of damage, and I have lots of fun. I probably die a little more than most, but it's awesome one-shotting everything.
---
There is a vide variety of character archetypes that can be played, and an additional smaller variety within how given archetype can be realised, but the truth is that some choices simply suck while others don't, and if you haven't tested this game with friends for a lengthy period or have found access to information from someone who does, you are fucked :(
---
Send me your special and how you want to play and I'll guide you how to eat cheesy builds.
---
Anything is better than DJ Murmrgh.
---
Yes?
---
👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
---
you cant.. just link it
---
The game engine can't Handle that many nukes !
---
I like this
---
"Completely ignore it in 4..." Huh? Travis comments frequently on the Sole Survivor's feats. There's even a questline that allows you to change how he sounds while DJing. I don't think they ignored the station at all.
---
Why don't YOU go to a different server?
---
I personally want a Wolfman Jack expy.
---
Orrrr the caz will get scorched-infected then join forces with them all. Game over.
---
Because I have plenty of patience for the timer.
---
Wanna bet?
---
Right! I’m on PS4 and have been server hopping for 3 hours and haven’t come across any players higher then lvl 100. Very few. I can’t figure out why either.
---
Im still to scared to go in even for the first time.
---
The eggs come real chickens, the milk from real cows and the sausage..... well, that’s Jimmy Dean.
---
I love the wendigos first combat attack with their aoe blast and a scream. First encounter in wendigo cave I'll never forget ...
---
Incredibly thoughtful and smart I like it!
---
My camp is just outside of Watoga, between the northern edge of the city and the power station that spawns the deathclaw. I like being here because of all the resources I can loot from the city, also most of the time I’m over encumbered, so if I’m at my camp doing stuff and someone nukes fissure prime, I can just slowly make my way over there, usually before the nuke even hits.
---
Even with all the burrowing ?
---
Thanks! I'm glad you like it!
---
Cabin at the very bottom of the map, kinda close to watoga, forgot it’s location name. It contains a holotape confirming that parts of Appalachia were nuked, mainly watoga. Whether the strikes were direct or just outside the city, I’m still unsure of.
---
I do though but the upload always fails no matter how many times I do it
---
Uranium Fever has been nerfed and n
---
No longer guarantees a 3 Star enemy. Also, the items that drop will be level 35-40. 
---
Good for steel but that's probably about it.
---
Yup,been setting nukes off on dipshits who pull this for two days now. Act like a jerkoff,that's how I'm gonna treat you!
---
energy weapons do not use silencers, stealth setups are less useful
---
Gunpowder is always in a little jar clearly labelled responsibly. Unless *you* are the exception.
---
They could use ‘favorites’ this way
---
Imagine if the radio location was a workshop and people could host the radio station themselves. And if you hear something you don’t like you get some friends together and take that shit down
---
It's just the furious effect
---
Ugh was this the rare plan? I just saw for 25 caps in someone’s camp and didn’t buy
---
When you have the wall highlighted there is now a new tab up top to add the wall paper, took me for ever to figure it out.
---
Because I have a shameful cooking addiction
---
Lol. Mine are all some variation of illicit wording in all caps. Makes them stand out so I gong accidentally scrap them.
---
While true this seems very edge case. At worst you should be losing a day's progress.
---
Yeah once Epic Games year exclusive licensed is up .. oh no wait that's just every other game on the internet these days ...
---
https://youtu.be/bibpUKW6cgU
---
That's my heavy build. I'm only putting it here for a comparison to what I'm going to tell you. 
---
I think for strength you need Lock &amp; Load.
---
I could be wrong here, but I'm pretty sure Automatic Rifle perks don't work with heavy guns. If this is the case, you need to drop points in Perception down to 1 point, as you won't need to pick locks. 
---
For endurance, you could consider adding points fron Perception and investing in Ironclad. If you consider a Bloodied build, add one point into Radicool.
---
I like this idea but I’m also worried about the people who like to ruin nice things.
---
Same!
---
Nevermind it just worked but when i go to the post it doesn’t show the picture over it unlike all the other picture posts
---
You can only have one technical data on you at a time, if you pick up a second it disappears. However you can hand in as many as you can find.
---
This I know. Hence why I said what needs to change out.
---
Is this what the effect of an "expired Stimpack", by any chance?
---
yes it is! Unless it’s drop rate has changed recently. Hence the reason for my post. That really sucks though, i hate narrowly missing something bc I didn’t realize how rare it was.
---
Yup.
---
Trade-io!
---
Thank you so much!
---
I'd rather have less than a full 51. More room to roam and rare weapons to pick up.
---
Some unique recipes would be cool too. I’d like to use the toad eye that’s been sitting in my misc inventory forever
---
That’s annoying lol. I was thinking “I never use grenades” and passed over it haha.
---
Yikes 😬 I just read a comment on someone else’s post where this dude supposedly had 2 in his vending machine for 1k and no one was buying them so he dropped them at a train station 😫
---
I often have to look up at the sky to be able to tell whether it's day or night, I hate the way it is rn it doesn't have that classic nightime mood
---
I’d hope the deathclaws don’t burrow.
---
Does rifle perks help with heavy guns?
---
Ouch
---
Known bug with many posts on this very sub discussing it.
---
Pilbots
---
I can’t believe no one bought them...or maybe he didn’t actually have what he thought he did
---
How the hell is this a PSA
---
That’s how they got in and it’s the  mysterious seismic reading that leads you to the station (from the computer in your camp) 
---
Her digging=seismic activity.
---
I used to do that, till some raiders started putting bounties on my head through various communities.
---
Not sure to be truly honest but I had many on me could have been tho is that why? Expired dont always heal?
---
Wasn’t that a Christmas emote? I don’t think I have it?
---
Ive also noticed a lot of traders with them. I dont ask where they got them from but I suspect people duping them and trading them off because the value and need for them.
---
This is what the guy with the invetory wipe story said. 
---
"It took some time but finally, we got  our characters restored. It was done in form of 'older save' added to  our characters. Now i have Turtle and Turtle\_2 that has old stuff and is  20 levels lower."
---
Should and is are very different.

&amp;#x200B;
---
here is what i could do with the setup of semi auto laser rifles. hope it helps
---
For Endurance, you could consider adding points fron Perception and investing in Ironclad. If you consider a Bloodied build, add one point into Radicool
---
For Charisma, I think your points are better used with lone wanderer (solo) or Strange in Numbers/Squad Maneuvers. 
---
Intelligence is fine if you're not doing Bloodied. If you are, see my video. 
---
For Agility, having that many punts in Adrenaline is a waste. Only use 1 point. You can consider some other great perks, like Action Boy, Dodgy, or Gun Fu.
---
For Luck (again assuming rifle perks don't work with heavy) lose Tormentor and Luck of the Draw, and gain Class Freak and Starched Genes, then go get some mutations!!!
---
If you are looking for a secondary weapon to go with heavy, get a melee weapon.
---
That's kind of sad that no one could come up with something more exciting than crossing a bridge. Hard to believe WV gets tourists, there's nothing there.
---
I don't think they do.
---
It’s good. Do you think long shot is worth it? It’s one thing if I was designated sniper or something. But sniping with lasers is meh imo.
---
The two other factions were raiders, the operators were pussies.
---
Yep, all 4 of my characters are in the mire, it's easily the most beautiful place in the game.
---
And he could Terence landmarks near him so that it’s easier to find him
---
Public service so you all can go check it out!
---
more accuracy is always nice, its why many people love stabilized for Big gun builds. however you could replace it with glow sight if those glowy bois are a problem
---
If you're failing you probably aren't high enough level for the bog. That shit is easy af, I solo it.
---
You passed over a plan that could net you a legacy rifle... Not to rub it in... Im sorry.
---
I did but they can't replace items apparently 😑
---
On pc it has been duped.
---
Give us professions
---
I realized it's been stacking the extras but only proccing the quest if I've turned one in already. Thank you.
---
...tag team champs right there
---
Got pics? Otherwise this will be taken with a grain of salt by the community.
---
Hmm guess I should going around to the vending more often.
---
 explosive legacy weapons are bugged and only deal energy damage, not explosive damage. use asbestos lining, not dense or padded
---
They’re all over the place on Xbox... most doing meat week...
---
They do have prime capacitors (know both normal and Ultracite one). You are right in saying that the capacitor doesn't change the base dmg tho, that's solely dependant on short/long or sniper barrel and if it's a pistol or a rifle
---
I don't but most of my stuff goes unnoticed anyway but after 1200 + hours it just disappears out of nowhere is just a bit odd i can prove i do have 1200 hours tho
---
Just wondering why op has them in for the heavy gun build
---
I've only managed to reach level 4 in NW. But I've always wondered how much healing an expired stim would grant. I assumed not much at all, due to it being expired. I wouldn't put money on it, but I'm thinking this is the issue.
---
I mean of the support ticket exchange.
---
Only glowing that I can’t kill are Yao
---
I run a stealth build and it's really good. Escape artist and high agility let you go back to caution thus giving the huge stealth numbers.
---
AP usage is great on lasers and full auto helps that. Rof is good for semi auto but really shines im comando and guerilla. Crit savvy is prob the best perk here keeping your crit bar at 40% or better.
---
No i didn't think it take pictures of it at the time..
---
I think the term you're looking for is *radioactive fallout*...
---
I don’t know what’s up but I do know I’m done for now since nobody has armor for sale unless it’s starless or crap lol

give us the option to be an actual raider
---
Oh btw, this is worth mentioning in a separate comment. Sniper barrels are awful. Each shot takes about a second to charge (represented by the lights and ticking sounds) and if it's not fully charged it does way reduced damage. Awful DPS for an unworthy base damage boost.
---
A mountain bike would be great at the least for exploring at early levels. 😬
---
&gt;Because I have have plenty of time to water and don't give a shit about others
---
New Vegas music. I dont remember the link to a mod on the nexus, but it had a bunch of music and all of the songs were hitters. pretty much all 1940's music are hitters
---
They get it done fast enough, they can joina  friends world that wasn't so fast and get rewards twice in one event.
---
bruh this character only has rocket launchers and grenades, let me beat the drums
---
And while we are at it why not Nightstalkers or Cazadores or the Nightstalkers with Cazadores in their mouths so when they bark the Cazadores shoot out... you sadist...
---
the insect that the cazadore is based on is a desert dwelling bug. would not thrive in the appalachias
---
Whelp you just gave them another item to add to the item shop
---
2 mins would be pushing it imo. Mostly because spawns have been slow for me(at least today).
---
I can 1 hit most of the enemies, but at least in the bog there is a fairly large distance between their spawns.
---
You've gone 45 levels without changing your base at all? You're actually  a better base study than most people are. 
---
I also thought turrets had been capped at 10 or something, so if you're seeing castles with 50 turrets I'm thinking they must have a glitch or something. I'm sure it's hyperbole, but still even if it's more than the cap it must be some kind of cheat. 
---
I personally have a "large" CAMP, but I have zero turrets, and most of my walls are only half walls. Most of my budget went to stuffies, plants and lights lol
---
Well then you should know that the operators were all about making caps. 
---
And to add to that, the operators were still Raiders through and through, though I preferred the Disciples and their more intimate approach.
---
It’s Weapons Artisan level 3 with 3 cards you can double the life of the weapon. Also with I believe a Science Master level 2 and Gunsmith you can make mods that increase the durability of the gun.
---
I didn't know anything. I needed a stash box.   I'm near flatwoods, not close to water. I'm thinking of moving it
---
Yep that is why carry two repair kits for it.
---
They are full plasma cores. Thank you for your help.
---
The only way I've found to over come this is the instigating legendary effect, makes them quite effective sniper rifles. 
---
However the sniper barrel on a laser drops the clip to 9 shots and an Ultracite sniper is 15. Definitely agreeing with the 11 base dmg isn't worth losing 20+ shots
---
tldr the title
---
fuck it nuke em anyway :P
---
I have one if you're on pc? Message me
---
I regularly build C.A.M.P.s that are 7-9 stories tall and fully furnished. I have a few tricks that help me build huge C.A.M.P.s
---
Use the environment - Build signs a cliff, or wall, or bridge, etc. You cab stack foundations to make your walls connect. This is my how-to video https://youtu.be/aq3gnXg3SVA
---
Avoid items that take up a tin of budget. Like roofs, or neon.
---
Build in places where there are no enemies, which still eliminate your need for turrets.
---
Use less flooring between levels to craft a more open space feel, yet area that you don't need to furnish. 
---
This is my most recent C.A.M.P. which exemplifies everything I just mentioned. https://youtu.be/SxXAJILV-mM
---
Hope this helps
---
“The engine the game runs on can’t handle moving things like that”
---
They were wannabe gangsters wearing suits that only care about money.
---
Raiders are drug addict punks who rape and murder for fun.
---
They are nothing alike.
---
eh, I usually have the radio turned off because desolate wasteland with only raiders, potential raiders, and various Appalachia dwelling creatures
---
Survival maybe?  I just know that it’s NW that’s doing it to me
---
I am glad you asked that because you are right that can be exploited. I knew about those exploits so I do not use isotope or charged or mod any armor that can cause damage. Thanks for adding this !
---
&gt;So is it wrong to report someone for blocking access to an event?
---
Do you really think it might possibly be 'wrong' to report someone for griefing?  
---
Or are you here humble-bragging/looking for attention?
---
The map is big, but not that big.
---
**title should say near
---
No, I am talking about the Craft Chems (5) daily challenge today.  [https://i.imgur.com/lHzjhJe.png](https://i.imgur.com/lHzjhJe.png)
---
Did away with mine, too many bones collected. I haven’t moved my camp for months and have plenty of water but yes it was a great idea.my squad and I have wondered though if location is relevant to what it collects.
---
Try nuking Grahm. Never disappoints
---
Because it's actually surprisingly easy to fail Prime Cuts due to time running out.  The delays between waves are excessive and inconsistent, and so you'd be pretty lucky to finish the event in 2 minutes.
---
From the Fallout Wiki itself: 
---
“The Operators can be easily classified as an organized crime group or can also be referred to as a gang, or crime syndicate, with their main motivation being profit. They appear less savage and bloodthirsty than The Disciples and Pack, with more functional outfits compared to the outlandish garb of their counterparts, resembling more of a paramilitary organization. Additionally, they have a more approachable and reasonable demeanor compared the other factions.”
---
[a brief overview of the Operators](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Operators) 
---
[a definition of Raiders since your head is so far up your ass](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Raiders) 
---
I’ll leave this here for ya. Lol you just have a huge generalization, here are some links to help you realize it ain’t so black and white.
---
Thanks so much man I really appreciate it I’ll definitely check out your videos, my main problem is I can’t bear to part with any of my placements now and my budget is maxed, all I’ve got left to do is place the rest of my magazines so I need the last little squeeze of space, just wondering if I literally smash my base to dust and rebuild it to the EXACT placement the same if I’ll have extra room now I’m 50
---
you don't make sense but ok anyway...
---
if they would check before trying to spawn you in would also take a lot of stress off the servers because now the server has to load all character data every time you connect to a server but if you could just 'skip' the camp-spawn-blocked server you wouldn't load in, have the server load your character files only for you to disconnect again as you want your camp with you
---
??? I thought you couldn’t nuke that close to the vault?
---
Mole miners being miners that got trapped in their suits is actually mentioned in-game, but only in a loading screen tip. There’s not a whole lot on them beyond that.
---
Was this in adventure or survial? Electrically charged nutation is probably getting you killed
---
Sometimes the YouTube videos kill us. Got my idea for my location months ago thanks to the resource map, far away from anything. Now it’s every third time in someone’s there and I have to bounce servers. I got far away so it wouldn’t happen but I guess taking a pot for extractors your gonna get that anywhere.
---
Yes.
---
No. Come back in a year. It should be better by then.
---
These patient people also tend to wait till everyone can tag all the spawns and that's a guaranteed fail.
---
Don't know of a fix, someone said there's a windows 10 sound bug, but I haven't seen anything about it.  I definitely have that (or very similar) problem.
---
Is someone just supposed to  just relocate a camp they worked hard on be because its in a meat week location? the camp was there long before meat week.
---
Just you. Save them
---
You just proved my point about them being gangsters not raiders.
---
By that definition any criminal is a raider, hell most settlers would qualify.
---
Everything about them goes against the raider life.
---
Aspiring to be rich, wearing fancy clothes, using guns... all signs of weakness.
---
those numbers came outta your ass lol
---
Yes vampires stuff is awesome. I used a VFFR handmade on my commando toon for a long time and really enjoyed not having to use stimpaks :)
---
Graham’s caravan.  Care for a round?
---
Change your account password and email password. Someone probably got in.
---
the jumping is equivalent of the prone spam people do in CoD, where folks learn to do it by instinct everytime they encounter a gunfight. Why? Because it's by far one of the fastest animation motions that put people's aim off, since there's a delay in the human brain and aim to fire. Add to the fact that jumping players can move in the air makes it much harder to predict movements. TL;DR, it's advantageous in every scenario, and firing from the hip doesn't actually hamper your aim with it on most weapons.
---
Awesome. I'll have to find out what they are worth. No need to be greedy - I have several.
---
I agree, camps have been around since way before meat week, I think its wrong to displace them. Some nicer camps take a lot of effort and
---
 planning.
---
Will be worth more after this week
---
Don’t buy them from vending machines. They’re bugged, unless the last patch fixed it.
---
Now that sounds like a great time tbh. I’m playing on PS4 unfortunately though so not much in terms of mods :/
---
and when a camp is built in that spot, how do you know if it was built pre meat week or post meat week? seems like a guessing game at best
---
Too many trees.
---
I like this concept but I think it should be a separate channel with a different super mutant. Make it really weird too like Best Friend Tabitha's station. I agree that Rose's station is weak at best, so I'm hoping it's merely a place holder for something better. And, since this is a constantly updated and live game, I don't see why the devs can't add more content to these stations. They did a pretty good job with Raider Radio in FO4 with Redeye, but there just wasn't enough content. It would be cool to hear updates of what's happening across the wasteland as well as the odd bs threatening notes from other NPCs, etc. Hell, I just might have to strum my guitar and howl "Gimme what you got" just to get the ball rolling on this, lol!
---
What the have at their camp such as higher lvl earned stuff. Some may say lvl 15 but they have 15k in ammo and several things outta the shop. Location also is a sign, higher lvls won’t set up in the forest usually but that’s starting to chance since lower lvls think the white springs train depot is the spot where it used to be more higher lvls. We’re (my squad) tend to stay south of the map. It’s not exact but close.
---
why should people who have had a camp in the same spot for almost a year now be forced to relocate for a week long event, one that starts regardless just a few moments later?
---
I came back recently and it’s fixed well enough now. Just restart a new character. Plus, wastelanders is coming soon and you’ll want to be leveled up for it.
---
Darn :/ 
---
It's definitely an unfortunate issue to run into after a long break. Kinda puts a sour taste in my mouth. 
---
Regardless, thank you for your hasty response.
---
You can finish fast enough to hit the other primal cuts that showed up at the same time.
---
What if you put on an outfit and it summoned a pack brahmin that followed you around and you could sell thing from it like you do your vendors.
---
While I love the music that came with FO76, now that I am over 700 hours in... I would much rather be blasting to AC/DC and other music now.....
---
Will do thanks 👍🏻
---
Would totally pay a monthly atom subscription for this.
---
btw, you gurus out there, is there a way to scrip a startup of Fallout76.exe so those cores are the only one being used ? a bit of work having to use task manger every time you start the program from scratch....
---
^
---
It would take about .0004th of a second for someone to be offended and report it and a 1.9GB hot fix to reset it which will effect the PA and ability to fire something...lol
---
You Xbox? If so the West Virginia Brotherhood of Steel can help you in your travels. Raiders won't mess with you if you have one or two soldiers escorting you during your Traveling Merchant expeditions.
---
I never seen a cat in 76
---
Wow time for a change up then, thanks for that. Even though I’m a lvl 250 on my BG build I’m still working out my cards. Do you have something I could go by to get them straightened out?
---
Alright, ill admit that while typing that, i thought “totally ignored” was a little overkill also but they definitely moved away from radio focused  quests when they should have expanded on it in 4. Not rehash 3 or anything but made it more interactive. I thought it was gonna be way more involved because of the fallout shelter app. That radio room got me super excited prerelease.
---
Well if graham runs the radio he will be easyer to track down when we wanna trade
---
Off topic but do the wall papers work for all walls? I want to put them on metal ones but I don’t know if it will work.
---
I want on so bad. I’ve said I would drop big caps on a weapon but I’d give 20k or more for one.
---
Functional tip jars would be INCREDIBLE.
---
Unless he still wanders while he broadcasts on it
---
If thats so then how did i buy that plan from whitesprings over a month ago
---
FFR makes a HUGE difference.  His is basically a 1 Star.
---
Second that! I will supply some nuke key cards.
---
Thanks, I'll give this a shot.  I've been using process lasso to automatically set which cores are active for programs without having to use task manager.  You can give that a shot, and I'll give your method a shot.
---
The Operators are listed under the category of Raiders.  The Operators were one of three RAIDER gangs occupying Nuka World. That’s that. No need to say anything else. Sorry, but The Operators are Raiders. Lol
---
I’d say 2K max, that 2nd star isn’t good for anything.
---
I'm still selling them for about 5k caps each. Only see them about once or twice every second or third day. There still rare unless you are farming spesificly for them.
---
Back in the days when you had to move your camp when someone was in your spot, some lame ass streamer took my spot near the covered bridge by the overseers camp. So I went to the edge of the map up north and I haven't moved since.
---
I actually sold it earlier today for 12K.
---
Do you still have any?? I’m in Xbox
---
That would ld be cool. Wouldn’t even have to be super complicated. Take over a workshop/ get on a computer with like 4 different playlists of classic fallout music and feel gratification about having controls over the radio waves. Add a few friendly trolling features and boom. Massive hit with the community.
---
I got the plans from last meat week and still collecting so appalacha wont run out anytime soon
---
I'm at level 95 and have plenty of SPECIAL allocation backed up to completely change my build, i've been trying to go heavy guns/explosives.  
---
[Here's the only "guide" I could find on this specific build.](https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=f338c59&amp;d=sq2s32sr2s22sx0pe2c72cu2ic4ip2ih2s10a04l22ls2lt2es2sb1cm0&amp;w=&amp;n=Swiss%20cheese&amp;m=&amp;nw=)  Although It's not exact to my current SPECIAL, it's pretty close
---
Green hood goes for like 1k, people really like it
---
Good to know, what about green rag hats? I have like 5 of those but only one green hood
---
https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=f337e59&amp;d=sq2s32sr2id2ip2ic4l22ls2lt2a04cm2cu2s12sb2sg2pe2e00ep1cr0&amp;w=&amp;n=Test&amp;m=&amp;nw=
---
The hats are worthless
---
They started the pay to win model long ago. Not sure why you think this is the beginning of the end? Maybe it's delusion.
---
I have WinAmp in the background with either A-Bomb Radio or Megaton Cafe Radio going. The only problem is it doesn't fade out when i try to listen to holotapes.
---
Also good to know, thank you.
---
Cranberry Bog is slightly better since you can clip both the Bog's workshop and the Cuts events area for more masses/HRF.
---
They haven’t I’m setting on a bunch waiting for that patch.
---
I agree, I have been working on a DJ version of Appalachia radio for spotofy and threw together pieces of his audio in one of the skits. In it, Chally goes nuts and wrecks the studio where the DJ transmits from and he just lets out a defeated "We will be back after someone cleans up this mess" while Grahm is just petting Chally saying "Poor Chally, did not mean to do anything wrong, you get extra greens tonight" Hopefully something like that will happen on the radio
---
im down. MAKE FALLOUT 76 MORE HUMAN!
---
Thanks, and i am expecting a report in the morning (5.09 in the nighte here, lol)
---
The report better say that everything is now 100%, lol  :)
---
I have 1. Furious allows u to concentrate fire to 1 enemy and brings it down fast. Just need more .308 in hand for close range
---
How about Rick Grimes, Carl, Dwight, Michonne and Carol?
---
Ooh I like this idea, I like this a lot
---
Especially that many.
---
For 5000 atoms only.
---
Ignore them.
---
Yes you have to move because some rando is upset about it
---
Lol starting to think you haven’t even played the game, it’s heavily implied even if it’s not blatantly shown. You got nothin else, shits straight off the official wiki. This is shit you would KNOW if you’ve played the game thoroughly. 
---
The Operators would rather negotiate yes, but if you even ran past the Disciples in game you’d know that’s not their style. You don’t even need to opt to talk to them, they’ll straight up talk out loud passing by. That’s straight up in the game.
---
While that is true in most situations, full health heavy gun builds can benefit from demo expert, there arent as many damage boosting perk options for heavy guns because sneak and vats is useless. 
---
So they usually end up having alot of points spent on weight reduction and such, running 5 points to make grenades, missile launchers, and explosive legendary effects better isnt really a waste. It does push your damage a little higher with explosive guns. 
---
It would be a waste on a rifle or melee build where you need a lot of luck and agility perks to really push your damage very high, those builds generally have less left over perk points to put into utility stuff.
---
If you run low health that completely changes though, those points are much better spent on nerd rage and survivability perks like dodgy and lone wanderer.
---
 Or if you value carry weight and fusion core use more than completely maxing your damage. 
---
Demo expert is probably the last thing you should do to get more damage though, only after youve got all your bases covered and your trying to squeeze a little more.
---
They cannot be traded iirc
---
Fuck that! I would just never play again. Hell I'm still stuck in NV bc of the Cazadores.
---
go run raids and stop abusing bugs if you want it
---
Well since they are doing rosies quest there in the center devide were no low lvl belongs.
---
I wouldnt drop plans.. Especially limmited plans. Sell them in your vendor.
---
I thumbs downed meat week event earlyer as gram was hovering in a seated positon with a wooden spoon in his hand.. i have come across glichy gram 10 times since the start of the event.
---
If there is a ps4 faction I would like to sign up. Body guard, bounty hunt, I am always ready to rassle a varment
---
Hi always ready to rassle a varment, I'm dad.
---
I am daddy
---
I've been playing fallout since the demo for 1. You're the one who doesn't understand what raiders are or even the point that I'm making.
---
They don't look, act or talk like raiders. Bethesda just couldn't think of a good third faction so they made some lazy crap that doesn't fit.
---
Adventure only for me
---
Now I have the desire to see glowing squirrels, 3 headed opossum and chickens the size of Yao Guais.
---
Probably isn't possible with how the game handles outfits.
---
they really mist the opportunity
---
I would like that too. I went with Raiders because I just got that Raider pack.
---
Raider Radio. 👍
---
The Imposters?
---
Great idea!
---
Ok, I take it that you're not that well versed in backups. 
---
I was referring to a day from the date of the incident i.e. you may not have anything restored on the day you lost your stuff but you should get back what you had at the end of yesterday, for example. 
---
If it takes longer and you kept playing, of course you could potentially lose anything inbetween if your character is directly overwritten. 
---
However, as stated in the very example you've provided, nothing was lost. He has both the present-day character and the old one with his old gear.
---
I'm not even sure why we're discussing irrelevant minutia to the OP's post.
---
I have a couple of the stuffed tie cats you can have. They will never die, as long as you don't break them down.
---
It's seriously just the first letter of the legendary prefix, not too hard to figure out. Only confusing one can be bloodied or berserkers but lets be honest who wants berserkers....
---
You think being a patriot means something different if you don't agree with the president?
---
You can still be patriotic regardless of  which idiot is supposedly in charge
---
I’m tired of the standard stars and stripes variations. I would love some new outfits, and also some new hairstyles
---
I wonder if it was just in the code that was copied over from 4
---
Nah, I’m just tired of this design.
---
Ho Lee fuk keep the stupid politics out of the game
---
Can we get a radio of just the Grafton Mayor letting us know that a body was found at Fort Prickett?
---
It comes with buying an American game, they slap that flag on anything.
---
Easy mode for content design.
---
I would like custom flairs, tbh
---
This is satire, right?
---
Lmao no not at all. Wrecking months of work for people who're being nice because of a few bad eggs at a 5 day long event is unfair.
---
Pay no attention to the griefer. He’s pulling your strings. Even us high lvls have problems with dicks like him.
---
Idk think it could work with military and army fatigues, and that police uniform, since the space on them are adequate enough to fit 5 on the fatigues and just 3 on the police uniform, speaking about the Ribbons though, medals are only ever 1 row unless you have so much, so I think it Could work out with some outfits.
---
Something similar happened to me recently. I (lvl 50) was sneaking around Harpers Ferry picking off bad guys about 20 levels higher than me. I've got every stealth perk possible activated along with a stealthy legendary rifle. After about 30 minutes I've almost cleared the town when all of a sudden every remaining super mutant starts rushing right towards me! I turn around to run and there is a level 250 guy and a level 20 guy just standing right behind me not hiding themselves at all. Before I can pass them I'm shot dead by the super mutants, the level 250 guy steps up and kills them all, while the level 20 guy takes my stuff. Then they fast travel away. I was not a happy c.a.m.p.er!
---
Thanks for the link.
---
XB1? I have a FE Gatling for sale. (Only 2 stars though)
---
Now we can, yes.  Before the impeachment process? No
---
Congratulations on finding a bug then 😁
---
Adrenaline is a good boost with heavy weapons, thats a +60% boost. Your build uses a broadsider with no power armor so you can get away with covert operative, an adrenaline would be hard to stack. Almost all heavy guns are useless for sneak attacks because they're high rate of fire, and they all have such high AP consumption in vats that gun-fu would be useless as well.
---
Also squad maneuvers doesnt stack with speed demon, and lock &amp; load might not stack either. Id assume it doesnt because speed demon doesnt stack with any other perks. 
---
Your build is kinda unique in that you dont use power armor and you have a high damage one shot weapon, your the bloodied dragon of heavy builds. Most heavy builds are about laying down continuous fire and high dps with large magazines.
---
PS4! Damn!
---
:(  happy hunting, though!
---
Wouldn't it be nice ?
---
When I see Jkkh I have an idea it’s a Junkies but some of the rest don’t add up. That was an example not what I’ve seen.
---
Thanks it may take a while but I’ll find one lol
---
I mean would it be too hard to make him an really buff ghoul or something. Maybe leave notes or holotapes of his story but made with the song lyrics
---
Purr-fect *FTFY
---
It said nothing when I clicked to enter.  Not sure if it was the courthouse or not.  I just entered the cell and went in.  No messages or anything.
---
Grahm and Rose AM
---
lol
---
I’ll be there! Starting to stitch my parachute onto my marine armor as we speak
---
Also, keep in mind it takes place in West Virginia, pretty patriotic state , in a post apocalyptic country folk state that happen at a time of war . 
---
I’m not political by any means , just observant.
---
Who you callin' a hoe?
---
I wanna draw concept are or some shit of a suit of t-45 or t-51 power armor that is Taggerdy's Thunder, US Army Ranger 75 themed.
---
Too bad I can't draw. I can picture it tho.
---
Let me check when I get home, on ps4 and have a few explosive gatlings/minis...you said 20k or more? I'll get back with you if you are a serious buyer. Got tons of god rolls, not duped either, found them myself.
---
The Fonz secretly hoped it'd play Beethoven's 7th Symphony every time he slapped it :(
---
You been doing the meat cook? Its the mild meat sweats. Look at your effects tab in the pipboy. It gives +40 health, +5% xp gain, and makes you fart alot or something.
---
 It overdrives your health bar like psychobuff. 
---
Annoyed me too when I was trying to get my full unyielding bonus for selling meat to vendors.
---
It’s a bunch of classical music because much of it is copyright free or very very cheap to license, lol. It’s nice that it’s there but half the game’s music selection is simply there cause it was very easy and affordable to put in.
---
After the great war, came the great blackout. A huge wave of EMP struck the entire nation, stopping planes and cars abruptly. I feel like people driving fast enough who's cars just locked up and stopped cause people to hit heads on steering wheels, or getting trapped waiting for help if they were far from home when the radiation came.
---
I really don't get people like that. I'd ask what kind of fucked up mind you have to have to get off on doing shit like blocking an event like that but I suspect if I ever truly understood I'd go insane.
---
Looks good, however I would try to fit in lone wanderer and just one star for suppressor and tenderizer. I’m assuming you use power armor often, if so take out power user and replace it with batteries included. Trust me, this allows you to have more fusion cores and don’t worry about the drain, it is way slower than fallout 4. One more thing I would just take radicool or rejuvenated in endurance
---
This still happening? Would love to join
---
It wouldn't destroy anything. You would get "camp can't be placed" a week with no camp.
---
Only 800 atoms.
---
It would be kinda cool if they expanded on the current pet system. Definitely wish it was easier to get a pet deathclaw again
---
I actually prefer the classical music from the jukebox in this game. I like going into a ruined dark building and turning 1 on, watching it flicker on and play a calming classical tune while I dig through a bunch of debris for anything useful and carefully watch for enemies in the dark. It sets a really good tone for the whole thing that'd be lost with something upbeat and happy.
---
Well we have a punch bowl I dutifully leave full of vintage shine why not have a dish for donations.
---
Strongly agree with the prime receiver. You can buy cheap plasma cores (condition doesn't matter) and turn 2 into 3 ultracite with ammosmith. I've got a Vamp Prime gp, and its melting everything this week.
---
If you end up with another one I’ll buy one from you for 5k
---
Ahhh thanks that's excellent at least I know what it is now.
---
I'd get "camp can't be placed here" so a week with no play, missing out on the full event, and if I chose to actually play I'd have my camp stored in the unreliable spastic blueprints bgs premakes when that happens, meaning I now need to place, disassemble, and reassemble months of tedious work. I've prolly spent about 32 hours on this camp alone.
---
Their isn't any law forbidding kids from playing Rated M games. So what they should and shouldn't be doing depends on the kid.
---
I do get the "forced eviction" aspect of it. Especially if it's a nice camp. But let's be real. A lot of these people put their camps right there in order to force people to wait. On the one hand thanks for having your camps there so that way I have 1.5 min to finish whatever I was doing at that moment to get there and actually be apart of the event. On the other hand, c'mon.
---
I think with 3 on the drums or spit it pretty much negates the progress bar decay, which makes it much easier to actually get 100%.
---
Especially when there's only a few players, it can be frustrating to watch them make no headway when you're the only one on the drums.
---
Welllllllllll it would probably be a fairly decent sized meticulously decorated home. It would have, dare I say, character? A lot of these camps are quickly made boxes. Or semi built places  like, you can tell they maybe moved there when they saw "MEAT WEEK RETURNS" about 2ish weeks ago.
---
This game has so much potential and what’s crazy is so much of it literally lies in “metadata” type  user options like this. Shit like this probably wouldn’t even be difficult to put in
---
Don't go giving them any ideas
---
no if you didn't use radaway or anything like that then they shouldnt go away
---
just out of curiosity what was your old gt
---
all my camps are meticulously built thats why its so annoying one of my camps, I have one in each region except the cbog and my camp in ashheap is directly where the event spawns, and people are acting like its my fault lol, i dont even play that character this week cuz its such a fkin hassle
---
People still do uranium fever?
---
Right but they already have the other... they could just switch it
---
It falls under greeting report him
---
What are achievements?
---
No you would not needed do anything. Once the event was over and your camp could be placed, it would appear there just like when you join a world now where your camp can't be placed.
---
First PA is power armory, the others you commonly see are;
---
SBQ - Scorch Beast Queen
---
VMP - Vampire, applies healing is a trait on weapons
---
TSE - Two Shot Explosive, weapon trait
---
AA - Anti Armor , weapon trait reduces enemies armor rating by 50%
---
If not sure you can always ask most folks are happy to explain.
---
When your camp can be placed as long as you dont move it its fine. Its not blueprints. You don't have to re lay it later on.
---
IT IS Absolutely 100% ridiculous  that people can set up enough fire power to level the queen in a timed event. meat week goes on for exactly one week. Your reply is extremely self centered. Not everyone has 24 hours a day to play video games.some of us only get a limited time to play.  When those turrets and rockets lay waste to everything not only do we miss out on the xp and the valuable supplies but it kills the fun of meat week. Anyone that can play an online MULTIPLAYER game and knowingly screw over other players is a huge asshole. No one wants to stand around and just watch someones weapons melt then enemy before then can land a hit. Just because no one complains does not mean they enjoy it. many people wont complain because it does no good most the time. Honestly the event should have been pushed back until the new loot system is in. hopefully next meet week camps are disabled within a certain mile of the event start point or at the very least make the weapons do horribly bad damage.
---
Thanks. Where are melees in this ierarchy?
---
Pretty sure the literal only way to get it is by grinding just ftr
---
Pray tell, where did thou find this armor of poets?
---
Both went away without radaway and starched genes was off temporarily
---
Dude, they go for thousands of caps on the market. 500 caps won't even get you someone to let you see their plan.
---
Wear a headset and BE a traveling merchant. 
---
Do a little acting if you gotta.
---
yea thats odd
---
I would love aids
---
get on mic and tell them your gonna shove your dick down there throat, if the camp was there before meat week existed then its tough shit, they were there first. i wouldnt take my time moving my camp if it was there first come first serve. and ill wait til they nuke by camp then quickly log off before it hits lol, then they have to do meat week in a nuke zone.
---
Ha! Youre lucky if you find someone selling for 15-20k caps. But good luck to you. Cant tell if youre trolling or just have kno idea of its value.
---
what if said persons camp was there before meat week??? your expecting someone to delete their hardwork when you could easily switch servers?
---
Aids would love you.
---
I'm bummed because that marsupial mutation is a bitch to get.
---
not really, show me in the rule book where it says that you cant build there??? how do you know his camp wasnt already there? i wouldnt move my camp just because some people i dont know or dont give a shit about cant access an event. first come first serve.
---
Personally id say no. You need 2 just for startched genes and you should be using serendipity3 and bloody mess2-3.
---
because if they pick an event area and someone already had there camp there theyd be fucking with a players rights to build anywhere, and theyve got wnough hate already for how bad they've handled the game over the past year
---
are you selfish, he can play the game any way he wants, if you dont like it go find a another game or another server.
---
With Grahm there 24/7 for meat week, these "rare plans" aren't gonna be very rare anymore, because that's the first thing most people do, before the event starts, is see what Grahm has for them and naturally everyone is gonna buy plans they don't know from him for a few hundred caps. Which is great in my books.
---
I'm also the same kinda person that made 30 Marine helmets and sold them all for 10c each,  just so everyone could have one.
---
So I guess the trick now is to stash your junk at every opportunity, except for a single Raw Fertilizer.
---
dumbass that does nothing 🤣
---
then stop bitching like a baby
---
This seems to be happening more this round of Meat Week vs. the last. Also, almost no one drums or turns the spits. I'm all alone banging away. It makes a difference.
---
THAT'S RIGHT BEST FRIEND TABITHA!
---
Shit yes, that way I can reclaim my throne as ruler of the tunnelsnakes
---
It totally does. The spits and drums buffer the bar from lowering quickly, while the greens and critter chunks fill it. All the roles are important and need to be done.
---
Chaotic Good player over here.
---
I live just above the town of Grafton. Picked it for the acid node. Has a stream for purifiers, too. Even a phosphate deposit.
---
Lol i hear ya there one hit wonders to my rifles and meelee
---
I was doing one today where some idiot was trading with Grahm the whole event. I put 10 Prime Meat into that event and it failed!
---
Bugs all still there and they grow with every patch but the quality of life is better and with meat week going on this week then kill 8mill scorch going on next week it be prime time to return
---
So while it's not exactly the same, there is a radio stream on YouTube of Appalachia Radio, with a voiced dj.  
---
 [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZZ-y\_z6zLQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZZ-y_z6zLQ)
---
No one is going to nuke you just because your camp is there, people only get mad when people BLOCK the drum. BGS isn't going to do shit.
---
Ya it is a bitch to get i do agree i got every blasted mutation at black mountain ordnance.
---
But the ultra light mods tho
---
You must not know what punctuation or good game mechanics are then, either way this reads like the opinion of a stroke victim.
---
I havent had any issues at all but im on xbox one
---
And bunnies! And squirrels! And doggies! And moo moos! And no guns or weapons allowed. Just cooking and outfits and house decorating! 😝
---
In terms of just weapons melee does the most damage
---
I'm missing that one as well as the Legendary Deathclaw.
---
I mean it's cool but isnt the same as something that is in game
---
Is a sorry excuse of a raider as it doesnt play music and the same thing over and over
---
Def agree i chuckled at the power armor typo
---
Also another thing is they had custom songs in fallout 4 like goodneighbor. Would have been nice to see some more of that
---
I love it
---
We only nuke thoes will turrets that kill everything before we can touch anything
---
No, those people are projecting their failures and have no idea how to play mmo style games.  Tell them to go shoot at Scorchbeasts until Grahm rewards them since that's the style they most likely play
---
Why does this link to my private Youtube playlist?? lmao
---
Its been spawning more in the divide then anywere else on xbox one
---
Yea, thats was a really cool discovery moment for me.
---
When we drop items, do they disappear when we log off.  If they do seems such a waste.  Better if they persist a while
---
Chose mine on the bluffs about 500 yds down the tracks south of sunnytop station. The view off my cafe deck speaks for itself.
---
It will work i got the wood wallpaper on my metal walls
---
Did you get a chance to record it? 👀
---
If I see that happening I’m going to wreck their  camp . Don’t care about being wanted I have caps to spare. Not going to lie, it may be a dick move but definitely fun way to initiate pvp
---
Bethesda: \*makes scorched cats\*
---
Everything is RnG just like the pervayer
---
I believe so, but I've only been playing since the free week so don't take that as gospel. Also anyone visiting the C.A.M.P can take it before the owner even sees it.
---
I’m on ps4 and can say I’ve never had that, I’ve had people white in a workshop I’m trying to claim that stop the bar and have also been inside and outside of passive. Basically i have never been red or turned someone red from an unowned workshop claim.
---
True, not quite the same. Until something better comes along, though.. suppose we make do.
---
No it was over that side of the map but not in a train carriage. That sounds brilliant though
---
As was pointed out there was no vending machine.
---
I've been in the same place since April. It was chosen because of the view and an abundance of nearby wood and water. It really does have a great view.
---
That's sweet, :) often times they aren't home sadly
---
On PC. Me and my team have been playing all night so far. Only ran into and glitched out because I did something stupid logging in while trying to join them from the main menu. Other than that we have been running dailies and farming materials and generally having a great time. There are still bugs, but they have been greatly reduced as far as I am concerned. Waaaaay less disconnects which is a big one. 
---
Basically we run dailies, farm legendaries from events, scrip what we don’t need, farm mats and kill the fuck out of the Scorch Beast Queen whenever someone launches a nuke. If we aren’t doing that we play around with our CAMPS. I’d say give a try. Especially now because meat week is going.
---
Oh yeah, absolutely. There are obviously a lot of a**holes, as with any online game, but I think good people definitely outweigh the bad by a long shot. If it wasn't for everyone trying to be more positive and helpful like you, (my husband and myself included) I don't think it would be going too well...for anyone, considering all of the current/reoccurring "features" in game. 😉 
---
HOPEFULLY everything is fixed by the time Wastelanders comes out. I haven't even attempted the vault raids, because I'm terrified its features could possibly wipe my entire character. 😱 Right now, they're just a hard *nope* for me lol.
---
I’m still getting legendaries on the regular. I don’t really notice a difference. Probably just bad server.
---
Has to do with handling the data.
---
10000 plushies is just 10000 xyz world coordinate entries, and would be a single item with 10000 coords to process. O(n) time to process. One entry with n=10000 things in it. For a computer it doesn't matter if n is 1 or 10000, still the same thing to do.
---
In contrast a magazine rack is more complicated. It has its own xyz coords which is easy.  But since you can have multiple racks as well and it can hold other items, each rack made has to have a unique ID.  Then each magazine put into the rack has to be tagged as belonging to that ID. Racks are even more fiddly than display cases as well since they are both sequentially and alphabetically organized.  One rack is fine, multiple filled ones becomes an issue. Most likely an array of linked lists. So One item with n sub-items, each with their own m sub-items. So O(nm) which is pretty much O(n^2) time (this improves though to O(n) if all magazines are the same type).  So each rack in worst case is O(n^2) so multiply that by the number of racks.  
---
Eats up tomes of storage and processing when the server has to load it.  Now add it on top of everything else in your camp and do it again for each person on the server.  Then remembering the locations and status of each lootable item on the server as well.  World coords and lists upon lists galore. It's amazing how stable it all actually is with tracking all of that.  It could be better though is true.

My personal playlist 👍🏻
---
I played it little day before. I didn't see any such camps, neither on first meat weak.
---
Is that really a thing now?  
---
Some camps are near to the event area and actually hurt it a bit because they drag the enemies towards the camp, costing time. I think the players AFK there.
---
Damn looks like imma have to see how different servers treat me.
---
All he would play is Butcher Pete, LMAO.
---
Sell stuff for cheap to make a quick cap or 2. I’ve noticed that if you’ve got good prices, once one person buys, more will follow.
---
Ammo sells really well too. Make 5.56 and sell at a cap each.
---
&gt;, then they have to do meat week in a nuke zone.
---
Which is like better.
---
I play two characters and haven’t had a problem getting scrip for the day. Sometimes I don’t max it but it’s always close
---
You passed it up? Aw shucks man. That plan is worth like 30k + or I one saw someone give like an Assassin Sent set for it :(
---
They changed that couple updates ago. Each region will only have a certain lv of enemies, Charleston capital was changed to have 3 separate areas inside all of which have different levels of enemies. Cranberry bog, the mire and savage divide will have more higher level enemies but won't directly scale to the player. Whitesprings was also changed so low lvl players can do the quests there without facing lv 68 ghouls from high level players being there.
---
Pr allow us to boil purified water. You can heat it up. It's just water bri.
---
Yeah you gota go hunt around more rather than depend on event. Meat weeks cool but weel have to go back on the hunt next wek
---
My camp is built directly on top of the Prime Cuts spot near Whotesprings. I moved my housing around the barrel and set up extra turrets to make it easier for everyone. Sometimes I'll just be hanging out at my house and get rewarded with prime meat. It's nice
---
I look at their stuff, their outfits, where they are on the map and watch to see how they act you can tell if the player is new for the most part.
---
Might get it wrong might not but I think its the gesture that counts.
---
Sometimes I might ask them but I usually see what theyre doing and if it is all low level stuff theb its a good factor that shows you theyre new.
---
Role playing is dumb.  Nothing wrong with killing people in a multiplayer game.
---
Thank you for taking the time to explain it like that. I don't think more stash or camp size will solve anything, give it a few months and people will still be calling for another increase.
---
I honestly dont know Im new to the game myself been playing over a month now.  Still lots to learn.  I never thought it was an xmas emote though but now that you mention it it makes sense lol.
---
Ill check out what Wastelanders is.
---
Yeah I have my CAMP in the train car so people can hike the stairs and store their meats etc
---
Thats exactly how I felt.
---
I’ll have to build a Spotify playlist with these! Holy smokes thank you so much for sharing that!!
---
Ive joined the meat week event a few times until i actually completed the cookout and havent wasted my time since. Foods not to much of a problem since the cannibal perk keeps that under control.
---
Best place atm on legendaries is the capital since it gives 2 3* legendaries then just rinse and repeat
---
not sure if it's taking a hit on lower end precessors..
---
Are they still only available for atoms?
---
They’re all very Fallout world friendly
---
I disgree, regardless of the age if you ave some humor **anything** goes.
---
Are you also running high strength? If so can move a few points out of there &amp; offset it with radicool or Unyielding armour. You’ll need 8 luck minimum for starched genes, serendipity &amp; bloody mess. 
---
 Hope that helps 👍
---
I had 1 weird glitch while hopping out of my power armor yesterday it had me streight up but had my power armor sidewase half in the ground was like wtf.
---
First you need the initial backpack to be able to get the mod for high capacity. I’ve seen them for sale at 15000-20000 caps.
---
She should have her own advertisment slot, though.
---
PS4L
---
Been on for about 3 hours -
---
2x near top of the world, about 15 min apart
---
2x near sutton
---
1x in the Ash heap
---
At least 1 other time I didn’t check to see where...
---
And Graham 2x @ 76
---
What do T.D.'s even do?
---
As I said in my post, I try, but many players do not play with voice chat enabled or seem not to understand, this feature would make it so much easier
---
Incoming nukes are a good reason,no?
---
Okay satan
---
Exactly, they have already coded the vendor system for the CAMP icon, it shouldn't be too difficult to apply that effect or border, resize it for the smaller player icons and set the information to instead display items marked for sale in inventory rather than for sale in vendor.
---
nah, just wait out the griefers for a week lol
---
Poison/acid DoT has gotten out of hand. It was out of hand at release, then it was rebalanced, then it got out of hand again.
---
Given the recurrent version control issues I would not discount it being unintentional.
---
Said that the scenario you describe, sans the enemies stuck underground of course, sounds like fun to me.
---
Mob density and a bit of excitement? Yes please.
---
God like... Server stability?
---
&gt; Blocking the drum or spawn points or building turrets should be reported, though. After a day or two it's clearly just griefing if they don't move their CAMP
---
How is building turrets griefing?
---
See you in 6 months
---
I'd just scip it. Instigating isn't great on a low dmg high RoF weapon like that
---
This.
---
Just for you I may continue to nuke that spot for weeks. Btw we're not the griefers ,the camp owners are.
---
yeah I see the nukes and leave
---
whatever logic brings you there I wont even try to decipher. I was there first plain and simple, if you cant wait an extra 3mins for the event to start on its own while others show up, tough shit for you.
---
I know they're part of the Responders, but I'd love a Fire Breathers flair.
---
Country roads on an endless loop k thanks
---
Thanks
---
Grillmaster's Outfit was only available in the Atomic Shop.
---
then i kick their ass 🤷🏻‍♂️
---
Encryptid is rediculous. I started it yesterday and got about 10 high level players to show up and *none* of them were willing to be conduits. We still finished it, but only because I was all 3 conduits and hid on the shack roof spamming stimpaks the whole event. 
---
I think people know what to do by now, they're just selfish. Don't wanna use their own Stimpaks but if course they still wanna farm the bots and get a legendary.
---
I can definitely get behind this. Hell yeah!
---
I posted the same reply and got downvoted too... people expect you to move even if you are there first, all so they can start the events 2mins earlier this week...  Im not moving my camp tough shit, if u wanna go through the time to try and nuke me ill just hop server before it hits, or maybe just nuke your camp in return
---
You do nothing wrong.
---
Maybe for some it's ask too much understand objectives and given instructions.
---
Like Encrypted - some (even high level) still shooting the cloaked sheepsquatsh and are mad when you run around to get the pylons.
---
Same here.
---
I’m chuffed you agree, Your my kinda guy!! 🤟🏼
---
Imma definitely hit that spot then thanks for the tip man
---
If you missed it, they are adding human NPC's back into the game with a big update later this year, hopefully November. So definitely come back and check that out.
---
Ditto
---
Three Dog added much to the atmosphere of Fallout 3. The voice actor is excellent and I'd love to see him make a return in some way.
---
same here, they downvote if they dont agree lol, i own the game ill put my camp wherever the fuck i wanna put it.
---
All the music is bad in this game.
---
I mean, for a lot of people that one is GREAT cause exp. I don't really care about prime meat so much. In an hour I always get more than I can turn in anyway. Just don't go to the Bog event if you don't like it.
---
This guy that did this is my hero.
---
aye aye, I ain’t moving either
---
Tag for later, I'll try to find this for you
---
Maybe add east coast, west coast, and mid west, etc...
---
Ok, Mr. Run On Sentence.
---
Bugs aplenty still exist however we seem to have some of that pre-patch 10 stability back.
---
Lately playing for a couple of hours without CTD using consumables, spontaneous CTD or indeed 'disconnected from the server' is the norm, not the exception.
---
Moreover they made it so you no longer lose your dailies if you d/c, this QoL improvement I found pleasing.
---
Furthermore if like myself you were one of the people for whom dailies in The Mire would not 'trigger' you will find yourself able to do them again.
---
Balancing has not occurred. The only thing they did post TSE was skullfuck explosive shotguns
---
However there was a 'balancing pass' listed in the roadmap regarding Wastelanders so that might be coming in a couple of months.
---
Duping is still going strong and as long as there is demand for it it will carry on, which is to say it will carry on forever, forever carry on.
---
Hacking is apparently still an issue in NW. I don't play that mode so I have no first hand experience on the matter, only the posts that crop up in this sub showing players flying, clipping through the collisions etc.
---
I don't even take the junk, honestly. Now and I then I will, but mostly I just got it cause I like having a robot around the house lol.
---
I usually keep my camp at the junk extractor below whitesprings, ive litteraly had higher level people tell me i needed to move my camp because their a higher level and can kick my ass 😂
---
If you're struggling, then you're not exploring the areas you have already been through. Bethesda games aren't "only do main mission" style games, they're "explore every inch and see what's there while loosely paying attention to quests" games.
---
Holup
---
Cat meat tho...
---
Power User is to make gatling laser have 1000+ clips per core. Definitely not as important if you are using a gatling plasma or ballistic heavy gun, though.
---
I still don’t understand why the f*** we get 3 meat cleavers as a reward. Why 3? Wtf difference does it make.
---
Serendipity doesn't currently work with Power Armor. I'd remove Luck of the Draw entirely, or get some mutation perks like Starched Genes / Class Freak for Speed Demon and Adrenal Reaction though.
---
It was actually Mr. Jingles. He was notorious for going around and killing people and leaving corpses in humorous and disturbing poses. The victims would hear the jingling of keys that he’d keep attached to his waist before they were brutally killed.
---
Sometimes...when you’re roaming around the woods and find a skeleton in a pose or walk into a diner in the middle of nowhere and you see a skeleton propped up against the booth...you can hear a faint sound of keys jingling. 
---
It’s Mr. Jingles.
---
Turning them in gives you a massively RNG drop at BoS PA paint jobs
---
Np we all here to help eachother out
---
I’ve only ever met one person who sounded like a child instead of an adult, and that one kid was easily the most annoying person I’ve interacted with yet in f76. Literally wouldn’t shut up the whole time and kept begging for explosive weapons.
---
Read the description of the thing. Pretty sure it mentions it comes with the door...
---
If you want to experience Meat Week for the time it's up currently, sure. If you're waiting for more actual content then wait until Wastelanders gets released in November.
---
Aides for everyone
---
Just Mute em :)
---
I was thinking on the whole shielded area how we cant nuke in the forest near gram and the valt then it hit me Use a Air Strike Becon
---
Easy work around would be add a distinct symbol next to the item to ID it as a player named item and not a named exotic weapon.
---
he got dem missle turrets and my explosive handmade lol
---
Is there an easy way to mute specific people? My social tab only works on launch
---
The peace and quiet. Secluded out in the middle of nowhere in the woods on a pond.
---
Thanks a lot! Newt already gave me his, for which I am really grateful! Thank you both
---
How about Cliffracers?
---
If you go to the social tab you can go to recent players and it will show everyone in the lobby and you just click the person and theres a drop down to add friend block or mute.
---
The plans are tradable
---
Either your spot is bugged or my spot is bugged, because I can max out my camp budget, leave my camp for a while to level up a few times, come back, and discover more space in my camp budget (yes, after making sure nothing is busted first). It's not a ton more space, but it's definitely there.
---
True. You did see that this mod let's you use the game from within Steam, gets rid of the requirement to type in your credentials and even launches and kills the bethesda launcher automatically so you don't have to deal with it?
---
"Double" is not being given out anymore? I took a break so didn't catch up with everything. What do you mean with something "good"?
---
None of the social menu stuff works while I’m playing, it seems to be a PC problem. I have to relaunch the program to use it, so I wouldn’t be able to mute people in game unless I mute all mics
---
Thank you so much! I appreciate that!
---
That'd be GREAT.
---
Yeah, but once I noticed it, I never stopped..
---
&gt;Yeah, 3 guaranteed legendary weapons, 
---
Not.
---
Sniper bloody build should have serendipity and bloody mess, maybe even tormentor. And of course class freak since you will have adrenal reaction and probably other mutations
---
People pay that much for them? I found a TSE gatling gun for 1.5k
---
Hmm that sounds weird. Whats even weirder to me is encountering a kid on pc fallout. Best of luck xD
---
I don't know if their camp location is bugged or my camp location is bugged, but I haven't had to scrap or move anything to see more space available in my budget when I max out my camp, leave, level up a few times, and come back. I'm in the level 70s now, for the record. I noticed a nice increase in camp budget for every level up after 50. I was told budget doesn't increase at all until you reach level 50, but I have no idea if this is true, since other than moving my camp a few times before level 50, I didn't add much of anything to my camp until after level 50 so I didn't pay attention to the budget when I was moving my camp. Plus my camp was nowhere near max budget when I was still moving its location around a few times. Now that I am where I am, I don't have plans to move my camp any time soon. Just adding more to it for the time being.
---
Some Sanford Clark and dick dale perhaps
---
We should give them ideas, better this then bad skins at bad prices...
---
We should tho, better these then bad skins at bad prices lol
---
After about 12 meat cook events I finally received the tenderizer. Then received a second one the very next meat cook. Mostly just getting flag and salty tenderizer mods and a mix of bloody / grillmaster hats and bloody outfits now.
---
Lead, adhesive and screws usually sell well.
---
seems like your the loser in that scenario, time and resources to launch a nuke and all that person has to do is server hop before it hits...
---
Neat idea, but I'd bet that radio stations and hosts require a good amount of budget and time to be properly implemented, and I'd also bet that Wastelanders is gonna have one - thus if that host isn't already Graham (which can be since if the goal of this DLC is to create a faction war scenario, a third party host would be the way to go) it is not likely that we'd get him for a long time.
---
Most double resource locations are popular
---
Am I still waiting for them to make the collection available via a quest and then put skins in the shop for atoms like they did with backpacks? The answer to both these questions is yes. Also, on the highly unlikely chance that they ever go that route, I would love a Codsworth skin. Coding it might be a pain in the ass since Codsworth isn't a protectron, but, to make up for it, I'd gladly spend actual money on atoms to get a Codsworth skin that costs more atoms than protectron skins.
---
Thanks. Big strength yes. Just tell me please, is 1star Unyielding worth it? Or i need 2-3stars? I just dont have enougth money/staff for that
---
Circuits
---
Price points?
---
No sorry. Scrap down after to get some material backs
---
Lead and screws is the only junk I purchase.
---
&gt;, but scrip turned it into a turkey shoot for players that should be hunting much more dangerous game.
---
Yes and we would if they would offer better rewards.
---
&gt;At least the risk of people one hitting them would largely be eliminated. It’s easy to step off the gas even if you have a bloody prime LMG.
---
People one shot stuff mostly because they don't care.
---
&gt;A bloody gauntlet build just needs to stop sneaking to not kill it in one hit.
---
But it's harder to do, since sneaking is involved in avoiding taking damage.
---
Well that’s what I want to ask you. Obviously it would have to be more than I could get selling to a robot, but I also want to give a fair price.
---
Plastic as no one can ever have enough of it
---
How much per bulk item do you think is fair?
---
Ok, thanks for telling me :)
---
Why are people so full of themselves about their camps lol? It's beautiful to **you**, and only **you**. People just want to find your vending machines and gtfo asap
---
1 Star is absolutely worth it, even 1 piece will give you +3 to all your stats at 20% health. Of course everyone wants the god rolls but for PvE it’s not absolutely essential.
---
*It's me again, Mr. New Vegas, reminding you that you're nobody 'til somebody loves you. And that somebody is me. I love you.*
---
If anything it would be an imprisoned npc like the mannequins in Skyrim.. Which creep tf out me knowing that lol
---
Wait you can change your pip boy colour on fallout 76?!
---
So realistic?
---
I'm not sure about 76 but on others you can
---
Troll.
---
100% its location dependant
---
Unfortunately, you can't. :(
---
"At least not yet" I hope :P
---
I spent my in game earnings (atoms) on this.
---
Three words
---
Nope, creation engine..
---
I just take them as free steel...
---
Let's hope we can lol
---
Lol people want cats to be immortal, but made fun of kids being immortal in skyrim 😅 guess that is the priorities of the internet.
---
I sell Lead at 20 or 25 depending on how much I need it, and I'm always cleared out.
---
I'm hurt, I knew it was rare, but I didn't think 500 caps was worth it for a plan I already knew when I saw it the other day.. TIL
---
I've seen some totally noobish stuff in uranium fever, even over level 100 players, when the bosses glitch and stay out of the small area.
---
I tried to emote them to come tag and kill them and...no reaction. I don't really get it. The game announces each boss, so most players familiar with the event then try to rush and find the said boss before any asshole can one shot it.
---
Instead, no boss shows up, one player is little bit away using "come here" emote, but everyone is happy doing nothing.
---
Not at all what you are after but if you just want it changing for the 'torch' color then your can wear a miners helmet and change the lamp.
---
Ah so you can't just return your camp to your inventory. Just have everything snapped to a foundation and store it when you're done. Camp stays where it is tho.
---
Slight bummer now.
---
SO MUCH THIS.
---
I'm done waiting while doing the 'come here' emote. I am melee, you have a gun. Your bullets are faster than I am, so once I reach an enemy I will kill it.
---
If you are on PS4, I have a marsupial serum in my vending machine.  
---
Camp is In a power line tower, just S of Monahgah.  
---
ANother player is in the same spot - I have a bronze lion at the top of the stairs.
---
Aj-98
---
If its any consolation, I lost it once by getting too close to a decontamination shower....
---
You need starched genes 2 to ensure not losing mutations by radaway or a decon shower,  if you have SG1, you can still lose mutations, SJ1 just lowers the risk...
---
My camp is at Primal Cuts savage divide near the water pond (on my alt character at least)
---
All I did was putting a weapon workbench, a cooking station, a bed for exp and a stash
---
Then I put a row of turrets rank 1 for my own pleasure so they can tag the mobs I might miss a hit
---
Doesn't bother anyone so far.
---
Hey, that plastic is super valuable for bulking junk to sell to train station vendors when the nuclear apocalypse happens. Dude's just planning ahead.
---
Thanks! Maybe now you guys can get rid of the trash ruining the game
---
Personally, I'm mainly attracted to Lead, Screws, Plastic, Ballistic Fiber, Steel, Cloth, Acid, Flux, Adhesive, and sometimes Ultracite.
---
I do all bulks at 30 caps on average then the more sought after junk i add 10-15 caps, lead, screws etc. Most pricey piece of junk i sell is ballistic fiber, 7-10 caps per oiece and it always sells.
---
Stims still work outside the circle last time I checked. Taking damage from enemies stops the healing.
---
Idk. My tse lever is a troubleshooter's explosive.
---
Well, but im playing survival mode
---
Expired stimpaks give like 5-10% health. And they're prioritized if you use the Stimpak hotkey! Avoid picking them up, and drop them if you have any.
---
Hopefully after this wastelanders drops they get back to work on making improvements to certain systems in the game like CAMPS etc.
---
They probably didn't have (powered up) vending machines
---
I'd be happy with a novelty vehicle, like a raider hover board.
---
No, i meant some didn't get infected, like the raiders  who peaced out, or just died from the scorched themselves.
---
I haven’t played in three weeks, was away for work.  I came back and did the update today...I went from having a ton of camp budget to none.  Did the update screw something up?  My camp is so small compared to some of the ones I see that are really nice.  I’m confused what happened.
---
Yeah I got that encounter recently, it didnt kill me tho.
---
About the craters I guess I have to open my eyes and go look o.o
---
Agreed, I just rebuilt my CAMP after getting bored leveling up and doing quests on repeat day in and day out, it’s definetly enjoyable but would love to be able to break free of that budget. I’m happy with it but I mean you can only have 1 smoke machine...wow and yes i didn’t even bother with displays for guns, bobble heads or magazines because it just consumes to much budget. Oh well back to the grind.....
---
Go away Satan! :P
---
Well I for one hadn't worked out that the crtter bits go in the shopping cart full of entrails and opossum and the greens in the stashbox next to it until today. 
---
I just didn't get it. I figured greens were for chalky, but could never figure out how. 
---
I also just started making chalky greens in my camp between meat cooks because I just learned how that works. 
---
The directions are awful. And ghrams description is easy to miss as just more color commentary by him.
---
It uses normal cores. You can put a Prime Receiever to use Ultracite Fusion Cores. 
---
The only difference with the normal Gatling laser and Ultracite variant is that the latter has more base damage and more damage to scorch (by default without prime receiver)
---
&gt; Bethesda has demonstrated time and again that they can restore items from backups.
---
Learn to read:
---
&gt; "Please be aware that due to tool limitations Customer Support is unable to restore lost items."
---
*Customer Support* are not allowed to load random backups.
---
Yeah, tbh every time I saw this mod I always thought it was just an overlay helper, like the steam overlay had issues popping up, I'll definitely be using this though.
---
I’ve been selling mine at 100, so far zero takers.  Sold a tenderizer for 2K. But not the pepper tenderizer plan, that’s also at 100
---
I believe so
---
Id be stoked to run into that. Would prolly make for a fun fight.
---
So ur 100% safe doing queen kills?
---
The budget is here, the plans are not. Learning camp plans increases the budget, but majority of the plans are in the wall decor under wall mounted heads
---
every little bit count, so keep it up the good work. (y)
---
You're loved bro
---
I want. To host my own radio

PvP outside of workshops should be just disabled, now it just scares people away from joining team and playing together

How about allowing us to gift atom shop items? My GF and I have two camps. Hers is our actual camp and mine is our FBO. Currently I have mine placed so I can extract black titanium caused I needed it for the armor.
---
I want to buy her the glow in the dark map. I have the atoms. I can’t buy it then gift it. I can’t gift her the atoms. I have zero way to use my atoms for camp stuff as my own camp is strictly utilitarian. I don’t even have benches at my camp.
---
I know they don’t want one person buying and making for everyone else but at least let me gift the actual atoms.
---
Yeah... I am over a lv 100, and no amount of new plans over the last few weeks has added ANYTHING to my budget.
---
Yeah I'm 100% safe. With unyielding boosting agility and sneak rank 2 I'm like a ghost. I can also always hit sneak attacks on the queen.
---
I did it for the first time this time around myself and I was also confused and i'm lvl 234. I didn't know what to do until I wtched a youtube video about it.
---
Camp plans? I saw someone on here post about plans increases the budget an made a video of it so I tested it out myself. One of the last plans I need was a siren and electric chair so I hunted down the siren an bought and used it. It increased my budget by 1% so now I can build 1 extra plant instead of being at max budget.
---
Would be dope if it did something like instruments and beds
---
-music suddenly turns off, player hears muffled shuffling in the background and the sound of a cow bell-
---
"CHALLY! MOVE OUT OF WAY!"
---
-annoyed mooing followed by a decrescendoing cow bell-
---
"Silly moomoo. Oh, what this?" 
---
-sounds of a microphone being picked up-
---
"Hello? Is this a talky thingy? Name Graham, dont know if people hear Graham, dont know if talky thingy work, but Graham find music place. Graham think he play another song!" 
---
-soft grunting and grumbling in background-
---
"Ah! Here is one, song called...umm, Country...Road, Take me...uh, Home! Yeah!"
---
-radio cuts to Country Roads-
---
Honestly, probably a bit extra, but whatever, i would love the fuck out of this idea
---
You can build nuclear fusion generators from a thin instruction manual, or water purifiers, but a large pot to collect and boil water in? That sort of advanced space-age technology just isn’t realistic..
---
I want them to add a quest to take over a radio station so I can add my own music.
---
…and please, don’t trade with Grahm during the event either.
---
Well then I guess I take that back. My apologies didnt realize this. So my bad
---
Lead
---
If they implement this, i feel like they'd also need to make it to where you're passive when in this mode. No damage dealt to or taken from other players as it opens up WAY too many griefing opportunities lol
---
Yup my 2 shot explod gat is my main and ur right there pure gold.
---
I think this is a great idea as I've been the no1 ps4 fallout trader for some time now
---
Lol yeah right everyone is doing something to get the bar up and someone is trading. I guess u just have to show up and get the prizes. I would like to know if anyone knows how the prize system works for this event. That is the one thing I dont know. Thanks for the laugh
---
Phoenix the bot should announce where he is too, seeing how he patrols watoga instead of staying in his damn store...

I mean I have never been in that much of a hurry that camp load times have bugged me. I am more sick of people charging MSRP or higher on items. No ones got time for that.
---
Awesome post! I love how both sides of this issue feels like the other side is the troll, made for a fascinating read. Both sides feel valid to me, it's quite an interesting dilemma.
---
Idk what to tell you people who feel strongly one way or the other, but as far as a solution goes, Bethesda should at least make it a no build zone during the event. If a player already has a camp there, Bethesda could just store it for the time being, and restore it when the event is over, as long as they don't move it during that time frame. It would be a bummer to some, I'm sure, but I think that's about the best compromise there could be. I'm pretty sure they've done this before with a previous event, though I may be mistaken on that.
---
Furious exploding? Dude thats worth a nice amount of caps too :)
---
I viewed that as well, and spent 1000's of caps around all kind of camps. Not matter what no change. :/
---
Get the hell out of here im offered 15k alot for my tse gat lv 50 even had a 30k offer before
---
I’ve heard it sucks. Haven’t tried it yet because I never see anyone up there. Seems like that event died faster that the imposter sheepsquach.
---
No more CAMP budget = no more Atom Shop items.
---
Agree i don't think the brotherhood should have been in this game in the first place they aren't even really the BOS we know from other games just a stranded military group who decided to join maxon for random reasons, if they made their story about what happened with the army units stranded without chain of command after the war losing control it would have made a better story than they just joined the BOS.
---
Ty i need 2 get in on that build

Okay, my friends and I just started playin about a week ago and are still findin some of the issues. I appreciate the info, hopefully the Wastelanders dlc fixes it a bit.

Oddly there are a few items I have been able to build for my brother, and GF camp. The Biodome being one of the biggest.

We dont want pets like Dogmeat, we want Dogmeat
---
I have a crew that run it every day. I rather enjoy it. We can easily do novice and standerd on all 3, and expert on dead in the water.
---
They are not that hard, just takes team work and some trial and error to figure things out
---
shouldnt be to hard to just swwitch the models/animations out.
---
its not like it does anything big.
---
LMFAO okay
---
My whole account is bugged. Bloodied for instance has no effect, had a full set of unyelding, all the perks, and a bloodied handmade and at 5% health it did 187 damage per shot, std handmade with full health did the same. Ended up just running my pa heavy gunner toon all the time. My wife's pa heavy gunner has identical stats and gear and her .50 cal does 1/3 more damage on the queen standing side by side, we swap weapons and it doesn't change.
---
Great idea! i would like him to be more of a talkshow host then a dj. He could even co-host with a deathclaw, i would really like it if they brought back talking deathclaws. they could talk about FEV virus or how its like to be singled out for being diffrent. Some brotherhood jerk can call in an threaten them with exticintion. we all know how racist the brotherhood can be.
---
Yeah, God forbid you spend 2 extra minutes farming something else. Come on dude stop acting like it affects you so much.
---
Yeah we get in get out and hit the second event before they all end that way I'm hitting 2 events every 15 minutes
---
It takes 15 -20 minutes to launch. Don't be crummy.
---
It ain't about hurrying or something. I'm just sick of my character loading in first and then the camp slowly loading in directly above me resulting in me getting stuck. Or even worse, some idiot decides to build a giant hideous camp near whitesprings station and it takes forever to load. Can't even interact with anything if I'm on a bad server
---
Seriously. This sub is the worst with that in comparison to every sub I've ever subbed to. People are absolutely ridiculous and just can't accept others' opinions
---
You on the box?
---
Stupid question incoming but how do we craft it? I got mine from a quest, if I remember correctly, and it's something like level 35 so I checked to see if I could level it up like the Mistress of Mysteries weapons, and didn't see anything indicating I could level it up or craft a whole new one.
---
Steel. Please.
---
You can’t build next to ghram camp
---
When vending launched I found a TSE minigun for 200 caps. Nearly pooped my pants.
---
Beware people inviting you to teams that you don't know. If they have PvP on and engage someone, you become hostile too even in pacifist, and can be killed. People are using this shitty tactic in the market subreddit to bait players into junk shops and offering free travel in a team as the hook.
---
ultracite ammo is craftable, go under ultracite at a tinkerers workbench, you’d need prime plans, stable flux, and ultracite though.
---
If you played fallout 4, I want a deathclaw the size of red death
---
Aww yeah I can see that. My place is a pain for me to load into, but not others. Game drops them right by my door, but me? Just down the cliff, but now that I have the jetpack is fine. What I hate more are the bad camps though... like here is a box, and no time put into it. Just meh do something cool with it.
---
People who farm Whitesprings in hazmat suits..:)

Not sure how to show you

Thank you very much. It took me forever to realize AAE was anti armor explosive lol. Thanks again. Now I know how to let ppl know what god roll I’m looking for.
---
Best of luck! Coincidentally, rolled an AAE move speed 50 cal yesterday from purveyor. Used up my luck for the next two years but it's a beautiful weapon.

Fuck cats. Make dogs inmortal

This is just ridiculous  tbh

I'm on PS4 and I'm on about the older Fallouts

I'm on about older Fallouts

Nah when people fast travel to your camp, it's likely they spawn down the cliff just like you. They fast travel again and then they spawn at yo doorstep.
---
I used to use white or blue and switch between them periodically to keep the screen from going bland if that makes sense kept it fresh
---
Makes sense to me, but I'm not a coder, so I do try to give Bethesda the benefit of the doubt when things that, to me, seem super easy to do in the game are things that they put off for the longest time or completely refuse to do. Hence why I said it *might* be a pain in the ass. If it's a pain in the ass, I'll gladly pay for extra atoms to make up for it being a pain in the ass. If it's super simple and they still make it cost way more atoms than protectron skins, then I'll have a problem.

Or any of the classic playlist really .

I stuck the little triangle flag on my fridge as a magnet. I had it on my cooler before that.

I don't think your supposed to be calling for vote manipulation on posts you make, unless your trump I guess.
---
Bruh ngl like. It ain't just a box or some shit. People stick around at this one.
---
Also i call bullshit on that because a trending post yesterday was asking BGS to allow us to leave caps at nice camps. So clearly enough people want that to get it hot.
---
You’re doing one of the required tasks to complete Meat week - There are a significant amount of players that think all you need to do is hunt critters - I’ve competed the event in a team of three in no time and been in a group of eight that failed.
---
It all comes down to shuffling shit and turning spits and music makes doing that all the better - drum on my dude
---
Yea already went over this with someone else we had the same idea is all I never even saw it till now. Besides the more people making posts on it the more attention the idea will get
---
This, you need the plan to craft the "receiver" for the weapon and with it you get the option to craft the ammo.
---
So getting awarded an ultracite weapon drop is pretty useless
---
I am absolutely in love with this idea! But I'd like for him to smash up the Grafton mayor. And start his own campaign to run for mayor of Grafton. ( with new quests of course ) I wouldn't mind hearing his voice every time I played.
---
True but I'm pretty sure it is more about time not cost for them considering who they are. Most likely if anything this would be way later on as they would have to dedicate small increments of time to record it all and then to work on smoothly inplementing it
---
I've had to leave a meat cook 3 times (I've played it 6) because of nukes.
---
I have 2 basic turrets aimed at level 90 yaoguai. You cant even see it effect their health.
---
1. Play new vegas tabitha a super mutant hosted one
---
2. The super mutants in Appalachia are much smarter than average super mutants so I figure he would make it work
---
3. Eyebot would be a great way to broadcast as he moves as their function is litterally for broadcasting signals and relaying information.
---
No thanks.
---
Brother, Gf, 6 other work buds I have been playing with dont get why I complain about the FT because they all too poof right by my door everytime. But there are a few that do get trapped down with me because the moles get angry. Once again something that be nice a Welcome/Homeplate you pick the FT point.
---
Lol I grind pretty hard since I can play at work to and haven’t gotten 1 good thing from her, not one. Good to me anyways. Thanks again.
---
It would only be rated by the Vendors, and not by how aesthetically pleasing it is. So not a great idea IMO. I'd love to come across more amazing, and original camps.
---
Ultracite infused concrete and steel. Allows unparalleled structural support.
---
On console I have no idea, sorry :(
---
Don’t like it don’t visit it
---
Maybe it's because they are traveling to you rather than your camp? I fast travel to camps all the time since I do vendor runs and it happens all the time
---
I know the feeling, I'm literally useless without my Mining PA cus I'll be overencumbered 24/7 and my stash is at max capacity 24/7 as well.
---
Just try to drop or sell anything you don't use a lot. And check your aid items, those are the ones that screw me over for me character inventory wise, junk is my stash's problem..
---
I don't listen to any of the music accept the in game music you hear when you turn off all the radio stations it's relaxing to listen to while hunting and looking for scrap. I just wish it was updated sometimes.

Make a donation jar camp item, I'd love to donate caps or have caps be donated.  I'd place it next to the pile of free stuff I always leave by my vendors.

Oh lord, out of all the post and comments they gonna see this one and make it happen for ya.
---
You're gunna have a bad time if you think they will fix anything when they add something new. Every time they fix or add one thing, 10 other things break.
---
I did something like this a while back and got so much space freed up. 
---
Replaced all my generators with one fusion generator. That freed up a nice amount of space and also made my camp look so much more efficient and clean. 
---
Always make sure my turrets are up on a roof where most of the nearby enemy spawns can't reach them (have two turrets, at present). 
---
Biggest sacrifice my camp had to make was all my plants because even though I didn't have an entire farms worth, plants take up a ridiculous amount of space. Every level up seems to unlock a little more space each time, so I do plan on bringing my plants back gradually. 
---
A ton of my camp space would be freed up if they gave us the ability to craft interior walls instead of forcing me to place doubled walls in order to properly use wallpapers. That's one sacrifice I'm not willing to make is to have my wallpapers looking ridiculous in my camp.
---
Make tamed pets immortal if they are below level 20 (I think 20 is the lowest level yao guai, deathclaw, and mirelirk level?)  If not 20, then level 5.

I feel your pain I was like this all the time but then I had a spring clean took down my camp back to nothing sold or dumped everything I didn't actually need (except some cool shit for my display cases) and started from scratch only picking up what I needed. Its hard but it has to be done at some point
---
I am the opposite, I have embraced the over encumbered life n walk everywhere. No fast travel kinda sucks but you discover so many hidden spots, mountain passes, n Easter eggs. Currently have my main character at like 1400lbs of weight. You can accept your post apocalyptic hoarding lifestyle it just comes with some minor burdens like armor with +1 to strength as well as throes sweet legendary effects n perk cards for weight reductions on certain groups of items. However, if you want to be thin just start selling all your stuff to the robot vendors. Food n chems can weigh a lot, do you really need 1000 scraps of rubber probably be fine with 10 or none cuz most scrap is everywhere n easily gathered. So have a fire sale all weekend n see if you can make some caps off all that junk in your trunk!
---
What would I have reported this guy for? Look I personally hate reporting people for anything and I'll be the last person to do it. Hence why I asked here. 
---
I also wouldnt consider this griefing. Majority of the things people here call griefing I dont consider griefing. 
---
Also how would this be humble bragging, when I didnt do anything?
---
I have (i think) every perk for weight loss. Makes me crap at guns but like a donkey for weight.
---
I'm not bitching? Jesus it's like just because something doesnt affect me personally, I'm not allowed to speak out about it in this sub.
---
I don't understand why people think having a comic collection is cool. Half of the camps I visit have a completed set on display. Besides it takes a couple days to buy all comics off Reddit for like 5k caps.
---
Also, isn't the challenge of building a beautiful camp with the limited budget a good thing? I mean, popping down hundreds of atom store items doesn't really improve a camp in any way. It's the cleverly designed/placed camps that are, in my opinion, most amazing. 
---
Also server stability. Fo4 had more building options and no limit, so why bother building in Fo76 in the first place :\. More budget will only stress the servers further, and I'm pretty sure the majority of players don't agree with your stance on the camp budget.
---
That's nothing, I'm so over encumbered that I can't even wear power armor anymore.
---
I can carry more without it because of the str/ammo/junk reduction my armor gives and perks 
---
My current weight is 1553 and I have tried losing some weight but fail miserably as I can't stop picking s#$t up lol 😂

Yep, hate them too, when I build a camp I try to make it as authentic as possible ie not breaking the laws of gravity and physics lol

Great idea, but people would Mark themselves and then when someone comes up to trade...just blow their heads off.

Or the opposite, traders targeted by grieffers.

Time to start crafting with all that scrap! Also get rid of any extra armor you have lying around, and take a look at your ammoto make sure you don’t have a bunch of mini nukes and missiles.

This is 25%+ damage more.
---
Explain this?
---
I love coming across well built CAMPs because they seem to be a rarity among the endless "box on a staircase" camps
---
It’s a camp not a house
---
It's why I have two pieces of 50% fall reduction....voila 100% reduction=No death
---
Well since D.C. got the everloving shit nuked out of it, it probably had an intense amount of fallout. So maybe in the fallout universe it traveled all the way to WV and people did to radiation sickness?
---
I don’t think anyone would pay anywhere near that
---
noice
---
Did you see the ”IT” movie easter egg in the frig in the whitespring golf shop kitchen?
---
Nuka cherry seems to come up alot. I always keep one bulked of each material just so I can scrap it for the daily. Skulls can be found at the raider camps closer to Seneca rocks.
---
What do you do in other games after 4-500 hours? (Guessing based on my own play count)  What did you do in fallout 4 after reaching a similar level? Prob time to play something else.
---
hey now, Mr New Vegas was the best radio host in any Fallout, also it was literally Wayne Newton!  Mr Las Vegas himself!
---
why same music?  some can overlap but it would be cool to get new music as well, and bring back some of the classics from 3, NV, and 4
---
how though?  I don't think you know what a radio host does...  they sit in a box, literally all day, that's about as opposite as you can get from a traveling merchant...
---
Lol I realized how stupid i was. Now I am lvl 44 and have better weapons, but mostly, I just farm tons of cap stashes in Morgantown.
---
only if we can have a pack brahmin follow us
---
This is the best suggestion that I've seen in ages
---
Neat
---
How would they blow their heads off, you can’t damage people unless they attack you first. The same applies to the grieffers, they can’t damage the trader unless the trader attacks them
---
Thank you :)
---
Yeah and getting a strangler heart PA set for PvP
---
This guy on Xbox built one there called the Boom Boom Box, somehow he got it at the perfect spot every thing spawns inside is structure, which reminds me of the raptor pin from Jurassic Park. Ggezpz
---
Takes about 5 seconds to back out 😂
---
I think a radio station playing the tales from the west Virginia hills, and adding a few new ones, could be cool.
---
Fallout 4 mine is purple. Xbox. PC prolly can do that in 76 already..
---
Every time these parents use the XBox, PS4, PC or whatever as a babysitter for their kids, the rest of us adults playing the same games as their kids are the ones that end up actually babysitting the kid. I don't know if they somehow don't realize this or if they just plain don't care who else has to raise their kid for them. 
---
How do I know this? The hard way. Myself and two other people on XBox are currently going through that with a kid who is taking forever to learn gaming etiquette. The kid is learning, but slowly. The idealist in me would love to ignore the kid completely. The realist in me knows that if myself and other non-griefer adults don't teach this kid gaming manners, they won't learn any gaming manners at all from their clueless parents and/or they'll learn bad gaming manners from troll adults taking that kid under their wing instead.
---
It pisses me off. As someone who, along with her husband, is determined to teach her kids proper gaming etiquette by gaming along side them or at least being in the same room as them when they're gaming at home, I shouldn't have to parent the kids of random strangers online as well because their own parents see no problem with giving games like Fallout 76 (or typically Grand Theft Auto, from what I've seen) to literal twelve year olds and then walking out of the room. 
---
Thing is that this kid also has Fortnite, Minecraft, and Roblox on their XBox. If their parents can't be bothered to supervise their kid while the kid is gaming, they need to limit their kids gaming to kid friendly games so us adults can game in peace. I game because I want to relax, not because I want to babysit a random strangers kid for free while they nearly get my base destroyed.
---
Anyways, I'll get off my soapbox now before this rant turns into even more of a "too long; didn't read," whole ass novel.
---
Not sure why we can't lol
---
I know!
---
Fair enough I always used white or blue
---
To answer your actual question about what to do with caps just buy 5.56 ammo keep it as a separate currency if you need caps cash it in or some ppl prefere ammo to caps when buying off them any way
---
Most people don't give a rat's ass about their or your camp. It's just a scrapping/storing/crafting/sleeping station that happens to be a free fasttravel
---
How is playing SIMS 2 simulator on a post-nuclear Sandbox/Survival game endgame? Come on man
---
Welcome
---
I feel the same way
---
Pen, it's spelled just like the writing utensil. Cuz you gotta fill out all this paperwork to become raptor captors gzzuzzlebuzzledizzlnizzlefuzzaw
---
&gt;process lasso
---
Found process lasso, looks like a very nice utility, thanks for the tip :)
---
*Pennsylvania I meant
---
Thumbs down you too dipshit
---
I think it depends. I've been in teams where I die, my loot drops, the server disconnects me, and my bag is still there for me to pick up when I rejoin my team in the game. Not sure how it would be if I'm not on a team, I'm on a team but no one on my team is near my bag when I die, or I'm on (or not on) a team and someone else is near my bag when I die. I did also have to abandon a bag of junk yesterday and then discovered it was still sitting around for me to pick up around a half an hour later. Of course when I was walking to it and almost got there, the server disconnected me and I didn't end up back on that server when I rejoined the game, so I losty bag that way.
---
I submitted a ticket to Beth and they said they are aware and working on it. So instead of a refund I opted to give them and chance to fix it, they always do.Hope this helps.
---
Grahm be like the three dog of Appalachia.
---
Sounds like you got mugged.
---
With green glowing bubbling goo!!
---
Fast travel away if it’s that bad, or don’t complain if you’re visiting vendors. Quite simple actually
---
Polished
---
Haha thanks &lt;3 it’s a very unaggressive trap, 90% of ppl never see what the building can do :)
---
Where did it list that? Or is it a bug
---
I'd say make them not count towards budget and indestructible like foundations to encourage people to quit building physically impossible skyforts, but people would just start using them as fences.
---
I agree. Stealing from bags should make you wanted or hostile to the bag owner. Could make it even more fun trying to grab and run lol
---
This setup with one stairs is a well known community tip because if u create a new camp but want your old set up you can just throw that on stair set down in a tiny flat area
---
Thanks. Do you know how i get it? Do i just have to pray for it to unlock when im scrapping armor?
---
Camp items that access the stash like the venders and display cases have really caused the servers to take a hit to the frames and stability!
---
He literally had a room built around the fucking barrel.
---
I wish I could see mine. When I try and pin it on a wall it just looks blurry and reflective. That's pretty cool though, OP. 
---
I do love the little attention to detail Bethesda do put in to their props. Like I said, I just wish I could see mine.
---
Very nice :)
---
Can i ask you, what outfit are you wearing in that video ? dosent look like the Forest camo jumpsuit ?
---
I have been looking for that outfit, but cant find the correct name for it ? seems to be a 2 pieces suit ?
---
I’ve got a question why nobody shows up to Primal Cuts?
---
I had to stop using them as they're always the first to get destroyed!
---
Making them hostile would backfire. It would allow the other player a chance to kill them even if they didn't want to fight over it. 
---
Making it a slap gives the dead player the option to let it go or try and fight for their loot.
---
I dont think they are gonna touch the stash limit for a while, we recently have it update it from 400 to 800 so...
---
Put insult bot on.
---
My camp is on top of the giant mast outside of Whitesprings. Just try and make me come down earth-plebs!
---
The game doesn’t exactly go about telling you HOW to do the event. Not even browses Reddit, gaming forums, or watches 76 videos on YT. If they haven’t gone out of their way to look it up, chances are they won’t figure it out right away.
---
What about when people drop gift bags for friends and strangers?  You want them to add changes to the game mechanics because you’re offended over who picked up your deathbag. Think about how silly that sounds.
---
Save your coin until you see something you don't need to ask questions about, don't get sucked in by the Atom store psychological mind games.
---
hell yeah, we need this ASAP
---
okay, so he did it on purpose, some people are assholes, just fucking leave the server and definitely don't whine on reddit about it.
---
Yes, because that is where several indoor locations are (but under the map, far far under). It is also where the Developer Room is where several player used camps and other techniques to get in and grab stuff and plans that were not intended to be available in-game.. 
---
Because of these shenanigans the area is now off-limits.
---
It’s the Camo Suit from the Atom shop, it came with a full suit and a shorts version, but I think it may be gone now
---
Why would you presume this has do with offense taken?...
---
This is quite obviously about the lost loot...
---
There can also be implemented a difference between death bags and dropped bags....
---
ahh... so that's why i haven't seen it drop in the game, thanks...
---
So that’s how they did it.
---
Don’t get me wrong, I totally agree with you, just pointing out it’s unfortunately unlikely
---
The novel Starship Troopers would be more like a single player in power armor with a MIRV Fat Man. The movie took the mechanized exoskeleton the soldiers used that was the central point of the novel out.
---
Oh wow, that just sucks.
---
I had one with a suspicious player sitting there watching it. When I went in the camp vanished and he took my junk. Hope he enjoyed those 8 pieces of wood. I figure the guy who owned the camp waited to hear from his friend and logged off.
---
I think that's what he was talking about when saying making you hostile. Seems like he was just being a bit more blunt about it
---
Mine just shows a reflection of the Museum of Freedom for some reason
---
They actually are adding in Floaters with Wastelanders. And they look like how they did in Fallout 1/2!
---
I've had the same problem. The "fix" for this is to place the diploma, but do not exit your build menu until you first place another object (you can scrap that new object later if you wish to). And if you want to move the diploma later, again, do the same thing.
---
New item in the Atom Shop. Pack Brahmins, 1000 atoms per brahmin
---
Idk, I felt like commenting.
---
Come on dude stop acting like my comment affected you so much.
---
That'd be awesome, would honestly love that as an encounter. 
---
Although: remember there's going to be other factions too. I can see some Brotherhood of Steel soldiers in the mix along with any Free States/Responders members that escaped the Scorched epidemic too.
---
Thats... weird? Thanks buddy I'll check that out later. Appreciated!
---
I craft 5.56 ammo by the thousands, why would anyone buy it just as a cap sink, I probably don't understand.
---
Absolutely. It's ridiculous that there's a challenge to play for an insane 7600 hours but they have about 2 hours of music between 2 stations.
---
And suddenly everyone would be selling their berserkers laser rifle tagged as Bloodied Explosive
---
Pretty sure it’s all the same I get the same rewards by doing drums. Hell I got the flamer from doing drums lol
---
Mines not now but there are advantages such ppl coming to buy and then want to grief. So I would wait and lure them to the back over the edge and take out the floor piece they were standing on (camp edit) letting them fall to their deaths. But now I’m flat land 1 story and away from everybody and everything. Love it now.
---
Dont be scared, me and 2 friends did all raids from novice to expert since they launched. Never had bugs when we found a "terminal lag free instant server". Its rare but good servers exist.
---
How many different prizes are given I wanna make sure I get them all
---
Of course it’s about the loot, but you made it sound as if you were offended because  that person didn’t kill you for the loot, they just picked up your bag. 
---
It’s been this way since day one. You don’t get to choose who picks up your bag and there’s no reason you should.
---
This, generally. I like being between the whitespring and watoga.
---
All my characters are in different spots, and all chosen for location themes. I like to build in the environment.
---
The new raider power armor skin is pretty cool looking, however, the arms take up half (maybe more) of my tv screen when I aim my heavy weapons. I did not wear it because of this.
---
If you use atoms yes
---
You can with atoms in the shop
---
Building a camp is one of the few things I feel there is to do in this game
---
I got to level 50, beat the main "Quest" and every time I log in thinking "What should I do now?" It almost Always ends up with "Let's do up / move my Camp"
---
I put as much effort as I can to make something that feels like it Belongs, only to turn around and see someone's got a Box above some Stairs on the Mountain Behind me...
---
People who give the "thumbs down" usually don't do much to contribute themselves, so they do this to publicly try and exonerate themselves of any  blame.
---
run dodgy as lone wounderer if solo. in survival. that should be fine for tanking.
---
Yeah, this is one of the reasons some people make floating camps with a single Foundation piece. This way they can blueprint the entire thing and then when they move they know they can just pop down the one foundation and magically they have stairs and entire floating camp in the air and it will fit pretty much everywhere. I can't stand those camps but I understand the reason behind them.
---
Mister Handies move faster than Protections!
---
Do you mean the color of the pip boy or the flashlight? If you mean the pip boy itself you can with atoms
---
Yes. They don’t spoil. The raw flux is the only part that spoils.
---
A full set of unyielding gear is better than Excevator armor, it'll carry more and you can run faster!
---
I've been to a few with high level players who take charge a let people know what to do, the cook out is not a all for one event, I'm sure u know that and players who want to take advantage of the prizes to turn in for script kinda get boned if the bar isn't filled. It's not that difficult to look it up. Just hate to see prizes lost, which for most of us is time wasted. Most of the time I go there and play the drum because no one else will and it needs to be done. Thanks for the comment
---
Stop giving them good ideas that they will steal and sell as MTX
---
I sold a few at that price. Im on ps4 but i dont think it matters.
---
I’m on the cliffs back above Blackwater mine. I sell weapons and still enjoy grinding White Spring and Uranium Fever.
---
No matter how fat-assed with loot I get I can waddle home or to the train station to sell and scrip stuff or home to recharge in a minute or two,
---
Bonus is a I get a lot of visitors to my shop as well being near such an active hub as WS.
---
I have a routine I do which has never failed  Graham's event.
---
 Does matter how many people are there. I even did it solo a couple times during the previous meet week.
---
 Just make sure you have wood and some challys feed.
---
It also helps to know exactly where all the plants are.
---
Start off by adding wood to the wood pile and give chaly some feed.  Next run around gathering as many of the grassy greens you can all the while cleaning up any debris piles and fires.
---
 Go drop more wood and chally's feed off then start killing the rodents.
---
 Run around killing as many rodents and looting their corpses as you can also keep an eye out for more debris piles and fires.  Periodically checking to see if you can add more wood or give chally more feed since they are both on timers.
---
 Doing the firewood pile and feeding chally periodically should keep the bar fairly stable until you're ready to hand in all of your greens and all of the critter meat once you think you have a sufficient enough.
---
 Very important to wait as long as you can before adding meat or grass since you get a bonus for handing in bulk amounts.
---
 There you have it. You should have the event either completed or right at the end where you only need a couple more critters.
---
Anyone else hate when people can’t let others build camp the way they wish?
---
Zero fucks given because I broke you immersions
---
So far I have only been scoring armor, so far nothing I would keep it all gets scripted...lol
---
There isn't a bit of junk in this entire game that you desperately need at any point in the game
---
Yes yes yes yes. 
---
IT costume
---
So when I get the “kill a wendigo in a clown outfit” I can do it right.
---
Definitely. I think they should do a free carved pumpkin that can light up. I want to make my own pumpkin house! :D
---
Yesss, i have both of these in ESO and these are what i was thinking of to begin with.
---
Thanks for this
---
That is a great question, so far I have gotten plans, chems, resources, food, and a legendary so far nothing I would keep or dont already know, normally I drop everything and just keep the legendary to turn in for script. I hope others will share what they have gotten
---
You are saying people who buy from the atom shop should have a larger budget than those who don’t? That doesn’t feel right.
---
Agree
---
I’m sitting on a haunted house build just waiting to see what we get! I’d like blood splattered wall paper and things that make noise, like the laughing snowman from Christmas:)
---
Totally agree. I had to switch to third person mode just to see where my crosshairs are.
---
I know about the pipboy design in Atoms store this is on the PS3 Fallout 3, New Vegas and PS4 Fallout 4
---
Actually, the comment has been downvoted to the point where you have to click on it to even see it so you can easily pass right on by
---
All I get is meat cleaver and chef's hat. Yes the enemies take too long to show up.
---
&gt;pray for it to unlock when im scrapping armor?
---
This
---
WOW!! Great job I need to be on ur server, no kidding. U on ps4 (please be on ps4)
---
I can’t imagine why considering how useless instigating is on Gatling lasers
---
There has to be risk involved when you die. And compared to a true Survival game, this is VERY light. You only lose junk. You keep all your hard earned gear
---
That and teleportation injection-cheats once they knew the locations.
---
You can take your lead, steel and gunpowder and craft some 5.56 ammo. I will always buy as much as you have for 1 cap each.
---
You can store them for later use at same workshop. I belive it lasts for a week.
---
Say you build fusion generator for posidion then someone turns it on. You can store that generator (or any turrets) but they will only be available there and only for 1 week. Probably server re set day if i had to guess.
---
Thanks :D
---
You can change the color of the Pip-Boy UI on PC by editing a configuration file. Not sure if this affects the color of the light, but even if it did, other players would still see the default green color. But if you wear a mining helmet, the lamp on those can be modified to a handful of colors, and it can be made bright white as well (which is perhaps the most useful, except it might be too bright at close range).
---
Don’t think we had anything added last Halloween sooooo (maybe this year though 🤞🏻
---
No one laughs in bethesdas wasteland. Only crying.
---
It's everyone's right to make their CAMP just the way they want it. Whether it fits your standard or not. 
---
And not everyone has the desire or design eye/skill to make anything else. Are they not allowed to play the game?
---
Also, this exact post comes up 3 times a day. Is that really necessary?
---
yeah they show up to attack your camp on purpose I have had a super mutant and a schorched spawn in the floor of my locked generator room on separate occasions
---
Become a philanthropist like Tony Stark in Fallout 76. Give away a lot of stuffs for free with your caps.
---
Two of my alts have camps near the Overseer's camp so newbies can grab a couple waters and some crops, plus access all the workbenches my critters have unlocked, play tunes to get buffed, and have a nap in a nice clean bed.
---
My main has her camp on a cliff way out east, mostly due to playing content that direction; her camp actually creates a handy shortcut for getting up the cliff as well. Sadly it's near a resource node I don't even use, so occasionally the spot will be taken by someone actually using the node.
---
Double doorway trick?
---
You're not just wrong, you're stupid.
---
I am on PS4 with same gamer tag.
---
It could also be another player is just passing through the area, without actually placing a camp there themselves; you can't place a camp down right on top of someone's head.
---
Just wondering where you’re “cashing in” your 5.56 ammo.
---
Oh yeah?
---
What piece of garbage is there that you can't just go get another piece of that same trash within minuets?
---
Most people just store hundreds of them until it jams up their stash anyway
---
Bigger than ole king kong!
---
Wait... it stacks?
---
How about we start with flux. If you don't have an active nuke zone in the right location to get the amount of the color you need, and the right mats to stabilize it, then you aren't getting any flux for those calibrated shocks you've been wanting for months.
---
Thankyou kind stranger, I even said I wasn't trying to be an asshole I just think it's funny and if people have issues I stop, I didn't think all that was necessary
---
How many times does it need to be driven home that the budget exists for performance reasons? There’s simply nothing they can do to just instantly triple our cap
---
I don't like it when it happens, but that does not mean the game should change. It Is part of the game, and maybe the only reason for not dying, since penalties are soooooft. So, man up. You pick up grenades and gunpowder from dead raiders across the map, don't you?
---
I like the idea, but I would say give everyone the ability to make a small ad with a few words. With Atoms you unlock the ability to do "Premium" Advertisements that can show more. It would definitely be nice if people could put something like:
---
Have lots of Flux for Sale 
---
or
---
Selling all Serums!
---
That way you know which camps have the specific items you want
---
Ok chump
---
Peepole r  dhum das y
---
yeah, we should be able to get dogs that follow us around and attack what we attack, even players, they could be like Dogmeat, they go down until you stim them
---
...realeased in November
---
Dump ALL of your junk and chems, then start again and only pick up what you actually need for a current activity.
---
Lettin the other guy feed that jukebox saturday night!
---
I agree :)
---
Ok
---
Why are you walking around with flux?
---
Raw flux isn't even a material which means that if you die with it then it stays in your pocket. 
---
And if you stabilize it you are 95% chance somewhere with a stash box. 
---
Besides, Calibrated shocks so you can walk around with even more unnecessary garbage is hardly anything that can be described as desperate.
---
How about stop having so much junk!
---
some, like the dogs and molerats, could be useful in combat, they would be immortal but would go down until you stim them
---
Ummm...you realize that Perk Cards don't work on your stash right? They only lower the weight of Junk you carry on you
---
That's weird that you haven't had any legendaries spawn at the prime events you've been at. I seriously have seen a legendary at every one I've been too. What platform do you play on?
---
That’s is just a dick move.
---
Well, there's Ballistic Fiber for armor repairs. Without the perks for 200% condition and 60% reduces repair cost (or the self repair one but that one has to be equipped)
---
it's a really big amount of Fiber to repair your 5 pieces of level 40 or higher armor.
---
Ballistic Fiber is not something that you just find everywhere, you need to look on specific locations, and chances are a lot of players didn't have those perks at level 40 or didn't know where to farm Ballistic Fiber. Bethesda even nerfed White Knight because they didn't like that it was a "must have".
---
Oooh, I dunno. I can think of a couple of theoretical times when I would not have been happy to have my junk shouting to me from an unreachable ledge... That bag of hard won stable flux when I was lowish level and saving up for a decontamination arch definitely would have been a controller-throwing moment. Or, low on ammo, that bunch of lead that I'd just slowly and painfully wrung out of the Wasteland for the past two hours.
---
the point of my comment is the event area needs to be a no build zone. Plain and simple If someone wants to build a fortress of turrets they can do it away from the event. Even though people play it solo fallout 76 is a multiplayer game. As in cooperative aka working together. Maybe you should go play fortnite because this is clear a concept you don’t understand. I have every right to enjoy the event without someone being a dick and hogging all the xp and loot from the event. So By your logic if i wanted to follow you around and drop a nuke on your camp every time you spawn into a server then i would not be in the right because i am playing the game how i want. if people want to play a fallout game where they get to hog everything that is what fallout 4 is available for. I should not have to find another game to play or jump servers in the hopes i find one that has an area without this shit. Especially when server crashes are still a major issue.
---
The first 5k are quite easy. Gets a lot slower after that.
---
Yep it does, i get no fall damage so it's just like if you were wearing PA and jump off a cliff
---
Its great if you cba getting goat legs or bird bones mutation
---
&gt; Why are you walking around with flux? 
---
So I can loot their bag, they are helping the community.
---
That’s the problem... my junk isn’t stuff like gas cans or wood scraps.. it’s like a shit load of screws and bolts and gears
---
When the hell will you learn that all this shit you want affects servers stability? 
---
It’s more likely that you do understand but don’t give a fuck. You don’t care about FPS drops and players freezing up and loot not loading for kills. 
---
All you care about is sitting and staring at your stupid camp while the rest of us are trying desperately to just play the game without it falling apart.
---
Really no excuse for that level ignorance that consistently lol. In gears 5 you’ll see it all the time like the sheep squatch event where people are just unloading every bullet they have at enemies that are completely immune. In gears it’s very clear there is a flying enemy projecting a shield around them but they simply never figure it out. Just never connect the dots. I’m certain these people drive around on autopilot like that. I refuse to bring kids into this world lmao
---
Because we were talking about noobs losing their junk, and noobs are the only ones that would be walking around with flux.
---
Therw are at least 3 places I can think of where ballistic fiber is pretty common.
---
And if you need it that bad than why didnt you use it to fix your armor. 
---
At levels high enough to require ballistic fiber you should know that already
---
There is actually a way to get up there without marsupial, I had my camp there during the beta, if you go to the south edge there's a few rocks to jump on but beyond the initial rocks theres essentially a path that leads all the way to the top no marsupial required!
---
For 2 hours you never once rolled passed a stash box? Or was it full of even more unused garbage
---
could just slow it down with the excuse of all the bulk bags and containerrs it needs to have bolted on to it to put the junk into
---
I usually just kill the people who make those stupid flying boxes
---
Yeah I kinda figured since half the stuff he was saying was pretty obvious stuff and refused to acknowledge that it doesn't always work like he thinks it does.
---
That's true. 
---
But if you are to the point where you are even able to enter a nuke zone to pick flowers (much less kill enemies for the other mats required to make the flux) than you arn't really a noob and you should know better than to travel to random camps without storing that shit first.
---
Agreed but I found for the pipboy problem you can change the display to just show up on the left side of your screen and not do the animation of looking at your wrist. I did this because it’s easier to read but it takes out the invisibility aspect of the pipboy with chameleon armor which I was always kind of OCD about.
---
They just gave up fighting game mechanics and throwing their hands up in the air joined the floating camp club.
---
Thank you. I finally found them. I swear I looked there before, but knowing me I just overlooked it. I appreciate your help.
---
I suppose that's true from a raider kinda angle
---
I'm on PS4
---
so I can't log into a server because there is an event going on?  what if I want to partake in that event?
---
I think you're the only person offended here tbh...
---
This is a mechanic that can obviously be improved, even if it's been that way from the beginning. Please stop trying to distract from that with irrelevant arguments...
---
Or you got lucky and got a few hits on a ghoul at white spring while wearing that level 10 hazmat suit you found 8 levels ago and haven't taken off since.
---
Never assume the level of stupidity of a noob, they will always be dumber than you assume.

Man I don't know who did what to hurt your feelings , but calm the fuck down guy, nobody was personally attacking you, I stated I have turrets I use, if anyone says HEY DONT or emotes thumbs down ,I remove them immediately , I'm not stopping anyone from xp or loot bc the turrets don't have enough man power to take down a lvl 65 fog crawler and if they did I WOULD TAKE THEM DOWN, it's not a big problem like I'm hogging kills in low level areas or some shit ? And no, I think I'll stick to fallout bud, I'm 110% positive if this issue you have was a big enough problem it wouldn't be an INTENDED FEATURE IN THE GAME, I'm not a griefer , I'm not an asshole and if anyone has a problem they can say something, I'll remove my towers and go on about my day , but good lord you vagine it's no reason to fuss on about it
---
And yes feel free to follow me around and nuke me, bc ya know, IT WAS AN INTENDED FEATURE IN THE GANE
---
I'm guessing Atom store sales are doing just fine without any increase in build budgets, until their bottom line starts to shake they won't do anything.
---
Lol or new, I'm not trying to be harsh but funny
---
I changed the Pip Boy light, which also changes the screen color.  I changed them all to 1.0000, bright white, and I use the holo menu instead of the wrist menu
---
Perfectly honest, I don't mind destroying some stuff in those camps.
---
you can, in the .ini
---
yeah, on PC, in the .ini
---
Where the hell can you change it? I looked in settings and couldn’t find anything, I’m on Xbox if that makes a difference
---
You’ve gotta start dumping excess junk that you don’t need. You don’t need hundreds of cloth, asbestos, glass etc in your stash, just keep lots of the junk you use often and cut down on junk you barely use. 
---
You’ll easily lose 100+ pounds of stash weight if you cut down on the more common junk
---
Please, oh mighty edgelord, could you please enlighten us with how you go about doing that when it is near impossible to even damage anyone anymore?
---
Nope only you. Just ignore the 20 other posts a day about it, its totally only you that has this problem.
---
if you're on PC the screen color and light are both the same setting in the .ini, 1.0000 is bright white
---
If their camp is built to lock up the barrel then yes they should make changes to their camp.  At the very least they should remove the locks and turrets
---
I don’t hate them, that seems unnecessary. I just look through their vending machines and move on. Maybe they’re not as into camp building as I am. That’s okay. It doesn’t diminish my appreciation for the ones whose owner put a lot of effort into if I don’t seethe with rage at the ones that weren’t built with as much care.
---
yeah I changed the option in the .ini, 1.0000 is bright, it changes both the color of the screen on the wrist unit and the light, but the holo menu is still the color of the UI, which I like
---
Most the ones ive seen they never even tried to build a camp in any other way, they just dont have much creativity so wanted to have a camp they could place anywhere and forget about
---
Do you build your camp to prevent people from starting the event?  Do you line it with turrets to prevent people from getting credit for the event?  Those are the camps people are complaining about.
---
If you are intentionally taking steps to harm other players why should you expect support from the community?
---
Until u run into a baller who takes ur prized possession just for spite
---
Maybe, but my camp is on a junk deposit and a lead deposit and there wasn’t anything set up there either.
---
What risk did these guys face for stealing my dropped loot? Seems like there should be risk there too, no?
---
If I travel to a CAMP like this, I turn away immediately. I refuse to buy anything if you can't build a CAMP right.
---
Definitely not a fan.
---
On PS4
---
that would be too OP, you could just tag ballistic fiber and what not, I believe they are as rare or plentiful as their spawn rates
---
The event can fail if you don’t play the drum.  If a player is locking off access to the drum and/or lining their camp with turrets that prevent other players involvement in the event then they are being an asshole.  Everyone else shouldn’t gave to leave the server because a single player is being shitty.
---
On about older Fallouts mate and I'm on PS4 so
---
Is your camp preventing people from playing the drum or taking kills from players?
---
What just return all your cards into points?
---
By good, I mean something with damage improving effects. For your gauss, double (yes, no longer drops) just increases the shots it can hold, faster firing is mostly meaningless since by far the biggest factor is the charge time, and though the faster reload would help damage over time a little bit, gauss reloads pretty fast anyway, so you aren't really gaining too much there either.
---
Makes me want to nuke it
---
in the junk section click sort by component and tag the components you want
---
Dude, its "immortal" with to m's.
---
Usually I wouldn't correct that kinda thing but you made the mistake like 4 times in your comments
---
My stash hovers between 490 and 520 and I have everything I need.  Probably could even get rid of a lot I don't need but that becomes a why question.
---
Orbital strikes don’t work on players with pacifist mode.
---
Oh so I should let them grief me in my own camp? Get real, I hate griefers and we won’t deal with them any longer!
---
The only reason most of them do that is because of crappy ingame physics in terms of building.  Smaller base of the base = less of a chance an empty bottle of nuka cola prevents you from placing down a concrete foundation.
---
Definitely a Dragon Age fan! Our group is mostly made up of old BioWare fans - we make sure to put a little N7 symbol somewhere on our camps.
---
500 atoms for someone that's played from the start is WAAAY more than a few hours, also the materials go by the spawn rate, so yeah, some junk spawns more, just keep clearing it, I get useful stuff out of mine, but it's def not pay to win, pay to convenience, that's what the repair and scrap kits and fridge are as well
---
Probably so they wouldn't have to change the color of the light
---
I have never seen it failed. I’ve seen a guy do it last meat week and built a pit around the spawn...never failed the event and we couldn’t get the drums because of a concrete slab. As for mine. I have never failed doing the one my house sits on. You can’t get the drums and yet the creatures still came. Every single time. So unless you got proof of it failing because of that reason.... I don’t believe it.
---
Typically those camps aren’t blocking the drum or lined with turrets to take kills.  This isn’t about all CAMPS just those that are made to mess with meat week
---
Or just unlock your doors and take down the turrets stealing kills.
---
I'm lvl 75ish, completed the story...i don't have a mic but I can help you out where I can...depending on what you need.
---
Are you on Xbox one? Because I’d love to hand out my junk.
---
Trolls are everywhere like cancer. Griefers and scammers time are short. A group of vigilantes is starting to grow and handle griefers and scammers when their caught. Sounds stupid I know but ppl are tired of it, that’s why they made NW.
---
They can’t Grier your camp unless you both hit each other. So if you hit them back, that’s your own fault.
---
Used to have a camp like that with afew metal pillars until they released the bungalow. Now I have a cliffside trailer park with 3 bungalows surrounded by barricades.
---
On PS4 unfortunately! When I’m offloading junk I tend to sell any that I can sell to vendors (stuff like gold and I think oil) then any stuff with 0 value I’ll find some low levels on the server and drop it near them!
---
yeah, sorry, I didn't scroll all the way down and see your edit at first
---
You can only put wallpaper on one side of a wall and can't put normal walls back-to-back, but you can place doorways back-to-back and then change them into normal walls for double sided wallpaper.
---
They survived in an area that was able to kill you. While I am far enough in the game that losing a scrap run to a paper bag is only a minor inconvenience, it still burns.
---
I made sure my camp up there had secure spawns. Its still aweful without changeable spawn locations tho.
---
English is not my first lang.
---
You keep all the cards you earned so far, you just get all your special points back to spend. Kinda how its currently for 50+
---
that sucks, they should totally have an option for it, we can change the miner light so what would be so hard about other players seeing your different Pip Boy light?
---
Make them a easy atom granting chalenges and we are all on board.
---
Ballistic fiber and screws.
---
Cool. I really wasn't trying to be a dick.
---
Yup.  It's so easy to get mass quantities of florescent flux from whitespring that the lmg is one of the best for melting the queen now.
---
By that time anti-gravity technology is probably a common thing, not only floating camps is ok, they should also enable unlimited jetpak flight time 👌
---
This happens to me almost every day. Things to watch for ... Thru-hiker (Agility) perk maxxed to reduce food and drink weight, Travelling Pharmacist (Strength) perk to reduce chem weight, maybe a weapon reducing perk or armour piece ... Then carry ALL your Aid items (Travelling pharmacist doesn't affect Bobble Heads though sadly). Also make sure any plans you want are "read". Then you can get your stash weight down by carrying more. Oh and deep pockets on non PA armour add 50 carry weight if all pieces done. Backpack from pioneer scouts adds 50 carry weight.
---
I change mine to white in FO4 because the flashlight color is pipboy color dependent
---
I would just like to be able to place the ratty "souvenir teddy bear* in a display case without it always appearing face down. 🙁
---
Oh wow, I've been looking foward to test my weapons damage for a while and I never thought about using a Camp Brahmin.
---
Thanks for the tip, I hope it can survive a Pumpkin Grenade lol
---
I personally think it should be more like OCDecorator, where you put the item in and it comes out as a static object.
---
Happened to me ... Needed the Prime Receiver plan for the LMG and vendors were selling for silly amounts. Then found it for 500 caps and many others too. End result is I have the ability to craft Ultracite ammo of many types. Anyone need an ammo crafting service? (Xbox)
---
Np!!!
---
You’re welcome to team up with me. I’ll be on in a while.  PSN is dixiemomma1577
---
The risk for you dying was you losing loot.  And if they die they would drop it and risk losing it too
---
Sounds fair.... on top of that you should be able to “cash in” duplicates from perk packs...
---
I was melee so long I forgot to equip luck of the draw when I went back to guns chasing atom challenges. Thanks!
---
Server what now?
---
I was shooting at some random roaming creatures and I was VATSing around to see if any were hiding in the bushes and I accidentally locked on a cat and blasted the poor dear before noticing it wasn’t a scorched :(
---
If they don’t make them immortal, at least give us some decent recipes for cat meat.
---
I only get annoyed when it is near a random event spawn point thus messing with the timing and spawns.
---
Sounds good to me. A fallout based on post apocaliptic  house decorating.
---
Fallout  Architects. Rebuilding from the Nukes
---
A long time ago I was doing the event at the Morgantown airport and one of the scorched ran off to attack a nearby camp. I ran after him, and exited the event area. It turned out ok, but was annoying.
---
This is my first meat week.
---
NV had such a great soundtrack.
---
I vomit laughter
---
RW shovel means you save a chunk of weight for the daily at least.
---
No you can't have both.
---
By fighting them... pretty simple
---
Is it odd that mine isn't a diploma but a looking glass into an unknown dimension? When ib place mine down, it looks like a strange room usually. Like a place that I've never seen. It's strange.
---
I like camps that incorporate in game locations and buildings that already have junk items. Found a really clever one that had a sign “Don’t touch my junk”.
---
If you have a friend to hold transfer of materials for you, saving all materials for ammo can be a low effort power level. It’s kinda boring, but I went lv 15-50 with about 30k steel and lead. I ended up with maybe 50k caps from selling ammo.
---
Fatman, lots of grenades, a flame thrower, and probably some kind of machine gun.
---
I'm not sure where you pulled the humans struck first, closest thing I remember the book mentioning prior to BA being attacked was there was some police action.
---
I camp pretty close to one of the prime meat events. Not right at the centre but enough to automatically join event if I'm there. Thought it would be fine - players could use my camp if required, not to mention extra passers by for vendors.
---
All it took was one event to make me move. I did one event, no problems. Second started but I decided to sit it out as I had meat cook, weapons to fix etc. Not good. Since i was automatically in event the creatures came to me. Not all of them, but enough to cause hassle.
---
So i upped sticks to a quieter spot till the meat week ends.
---
Is it now? What if they don't fight back? 
---
Does your edgelord card allow unwarranted assaults to actually do damage?
---
There's definitely something going on with power armor at this event... I tried it for the first time today, except I was entering my power armor, not exiting it. Whenever I entered into it, it glitched out and froze me in place on the server. I stood there getting attacked and trying to regain control, but ended up having to shut down my system.
---
Ps4 here.  I thought maybe somehow I just missed it but I checked my inventory and didn't see anything that would be from it.  Idk,  guess I'll try again tonight!
---
Some people say it's the explosive effect specifically that causes this, but what I've found is that the game just can't handle all the pellets simultaneously hitting an enemy under the best of times, and then when you have explosive damage on top of that, you stand a very high chance of getting the damage rubberbanding bug where it takes 5-6 shots to kill a basic enemy because their health bar just refuses to stay down.
---
In other words, more likely than not, it's not your build or anything you're doing.  It's the game.
---
That's awesome, I hope u get a lot out of it. It's not just about prizes but xp also so make sure u get well rested, eat cranberry relish or cobbler to increase ur xp earning. If ur low level stay in the forest prime meat event. But always join the cook out almost every 40min or so. Try not to miss the prizes just for showing up. If u dont know what to do, drum or turn spit. You can can gather wood, kill critters, gather greens, put out fires, pick up poop or feed chally. The one thing u dont want to do is nothing so pick one it's a team effort and everyone wins in end. Good luck and good hunting
---
More damage is more damage is more damage. 
---
I prefer B25 personally, but there's a reason BE is more expensive on the trade networks.
---
Does your combat shotgun have +250 dr while reloading perk?
---
Do you know that for a fact, or is that your assumption?  You can effectively have both when one or the other is in the ‘serum’ state, but as I mentioned, even before I had herbivore, carnivore never move from serum effect to permanent mutation.
---
I had a game freeze but checked my inventory after and had a reward. Check your inventory. There does seem to be some glitch during the reward but it is still rewarding.
---
But they fight back, so you can now be quiet
---
and that right there is just a d\*ck move
---
Blocking a event to spite others just tells me how sad and unhappy that person has to be in his or her life to feel better about ruining other peoples fun
---
Damn I thought it could be something like that, having experienced half of my melee attacks not damaging the enemy. It explains why the bloodied one works fine. Thanks!
---
Wander around and explore. Kill stuff, build stuff, do events. Most important..have fun
---
My camp has been in the same place long before meat weeks. But its still just yards outside the event zone. People are trying to build in the zone so they can get the rewards for doing nothing.
---
As long as they work. I have a few challenges that haven’t worked. I’ve done Ground Zero a few times and never had the achievement trigger.
---
Its showing you the inside of the building where you first meet the Minutemen in Fallout 4
---
Anyone feeling left out, I did my first silo and launch at 240, after 10 months of playing. It’s a good experience, but you’re not missing a ton.
---
Cool.  Ok,  I'll be giving it another shot !
---
I dont understand why people are mad at the camps near prime cuts, you can use the workbenches and stuff. Someone literally complained about the turrets killing everything. Just spam vats and let the turrets finish them off and then after the event use the workbenches/stash your stuff.
---
It's true though, no one can explain how Eyebots work. 👀
---
Yeah which is weird. It's like a look into the future. Its a scrying mirror!
---
You can buy a nuke card, but I don’t know if that will count for the quest.
---
We all do
---
15% faster reload if I'm correct!
---
You don't know shit about me, my guy.
---
Ha!
---
You are so fucking edgy. Let me guess, your character is a loner that wears all black and hides in corners pouting? Too bad their arn't any katana  in the game- though to be fair I guess I'm mixing played out stereotypes there.
---
Explosive weapon aimed at their feet, point blank.  You damage both of you in one shot, and activate retaliatory pvp.  It's the oldest pvp exploit in the game.
---
Yeah
---
i know right? they waste 10-20minutes, ammo, stims, and a nuke code just to nuke someone's camp just for them to spend 3 seconds to check the map and leave the server to join another.
---
Yeah, this is a really good point.  If you got rid of floating bases, you'd also deny a lot of creative builds that are built to be part of the world, like CAMPs in the monorail cars, treehouses, covered bridges, etc.
---
No clue, gotta be a reason
---
No worries so didn't a lot of others lol
---
I tried doing this for a while, but those things can be finicky as hell to place. You either need to put a foundation under them first, or they're likely to clip somewhere and stay red.
---
I didn’t hit back, he kept shooting me in my camp so I dropped the floor. No excuse attacking someone in the when their in passive. It’s just being a dick. After they seen I wasn’t going to fight back they should have stopped but they never would. You can’t be a bigger dick then a griefer.
---
True
---
I'm not at all sure that works but sure man, you do you.
---
Goat Legs help, too!
---
Yeah I used to live in the small house nearby the cola plant, the one that had the rad roach on the toilet. Had a nice lived in feel.
---
Would be nice if we could make our camps look like that don't you think? I meant there aren't many of these locations that we can actually build in, and even if somebody were to give me a big list of them it wouldn't matter. I want to build my own!
---
could also be used to set up an ambush. one person markes themselves as a merchant, has a few friends hiding nearby.
---
You can find everything in specific places of the map. Don't have crops at your camp.the only way to have efficient crops is to have a ton of them and waste your budget. I do them all everyday and only have the outfits because they weight nothing, and i keep almost all outfits of the game.
---
This is def gonna cost 8-12 dollars.
---
I *wish* people would get on the damn drums. I've seen the event fail because you have no one turning the spits, playing the drums, or cleaning up messes/fires, and instead just run around shooting critters.
---
Patch notes.
---
Well if you didn’t hit them back they they can’t do anything. They’re just wasting ammo. Unless it’s survival mode which I know nothing about
---
Protip for that situation:  If you immediately fast travel a second time to thay camp, (even though you are technically already there) you will be placed in a different, and probably better spot in relation to the camp. 
---
Since you are already there, there is no charge for the second fast travel and the load time is instant.
---
Put them in your vendor for 1 cap a piece and they'll sell.
---
If you broke your son's Xbox, how come he gets your old one and you get a new one? Shouldn't he get the new one?
---
Fact. You can't have both.
---
Are the patch notes going to tell me why my primary power armor pieces are also duplicated in name only in my inventory?
---
IMO, they really need to change Goat Legs to be a 50% reduction instead of a 40%, because it doesn't sync with the fall reduction armor at all.  It can never negate fall damage on its own, and you'll always need Rank 2 even if you own one piece of fall reduction armor.
---
I believed that for a long time. But it is just not quite right. Ran into it a lot as a Tesla user.  I happen across a legacy explosive Tesla. The game has absolutely no problem keeping up with the damage that puts out. As well as an instigating explosive lmg, I'm outputting damage numbers for hits and explosions that way exceed anything from a normal tesla or tse shotgun, by far. There is definitely something going on, but it is definitely  not the games "inability to keep up with the damage output."
---
Your entire conversation in this whole thread is down right weird. Why does it matter if you where there first by building outside of the projected zone your implicitly accepting your camp may get nuked. 
---
Then again this thread is weird because instead of just stating the matter of fact that if something annoys you, you can always nuke your problems away. It gone in spiral of people needing to justify their actions as if it was like a war crime.
---
Yea that little thing is the biggest mystery. All the gutsys are still using rocket engines lol
---
Go read them and find out
---
Because I dont have a new one, but I have my old one to give him til I do?
---
they should fix this....I want to put it in my camp
---
That isn't a risk for stealing my dropped loot
---
If they die isn't a direct risk. Then it's a risk if they die. There's no risk for them stealing the bag
---
I think it's cool, although it's a bug. Easier to see than the diploma imo since the diploma has scorch marks. But it's interesting to see.
---
No it was adventure and I was on passive mode. I don’t play NW or survival either, it was the point. It happen more then once. I realize they’re wasting their time and ammo but I didn’t want to deal with it. Play stupid games get dropped off a cliff.  Don’t happen now, not to many want to grief a lvl 400+.
---
You can scrap the extra chassis at a workbench to get rid of them.
---
I disagree. They were engaging in an area that was able to kill you. They were not at risk from you, but at risk from the area.  Taking ammo of a fallen soldier carries no blame.
---
I heard you can test damage numbers on the frog jar?
---
Why not ask for Bethesda to add in support beams that work 100% of the time.  Personally in my builds I attempt to make my camps easy to move, functional,  and aesthetically pleasing. I have a "floating" camp but I've made it seem like the stairs are support beams, kinda got a landing gear type thing going on, also resembles the Hornwrite Estate if it was shorter.
---
Thanks for being useful!
---
I run with pacifist enabled, so I couldn’t  retaliate even if I wanted to, but I get dragged into noncon pvp at least once a week by random teenybopper psychopaths who thinks it’s amazing fun to gank people who just want to be left alone.
---
Don't do it with barn walls, tho. When you add the wallpaper, and then try to hang any poster or picture, the poster will clip behind the wallpaper.
---
I haven't seen anything in the most recent patch notes that concerns my specific problem. Comments like yours are useless. I'm not looking for upvotes, I asked a question that someone else kindly answered. Try contributing something to a conversation next time.
---
Stop acting as if nuking someone base is a major warcrime. You’ve had long enough to know if you build outside the safe zone your base can become toast!
---
Any images of it? i like the sounds of it
---
Just give me Dogmeat best companion in every FO game.
---
Bulk steel and bulk lead for cheap
---
Aluminum,adhesive,lead,flux,screws,springs,gears, need i say more.
---
I mean, I can often hit things with Bloodied melee and have them take no actual damage, despite seeing "4000" floating over them.  The damage numbers are disconnected from reality.  Either they are handled on the client, without acknowledgement from the server, or something about the server is second-guessing whether or not the hit counts, maybe due to the relative positions of player and enemy not being what they appear to be on the client's side.
---
It’s actually a lot of fun, but glad you expressed your opinion when you haven’t done it lol
---
The event goes faster by putting out fires, picking up trash, poop scooping, killing critters, etc. Someone obviously has big important things to do if they’re giving you a thumbs down.
---
Picking up greens and depositing them into the container bumps up the bar significantly. Grabbing those helps the most.
---
The event is possible to solo just by running around and doing all the tasks, so I don’t see what the problem is with a drum circle.
---
I've said we needed a bank for ages  now, and with the npcs coming  now it the perfect time to open a bank.
---
When did you last log in before your power armor issue? The patch notes for an update recently addressed an issue with duplicate frames of power armor: players would log in with extra frames and all of their PA pieces equipped and in Their inventory, and your issue sounds very similar to what happened to them
---
If you were not offended you have never made your original post asking Aunt Beth save your death bag from the evil scavengers. 
---
Maybe I do get offended when I see posts day after day from players who want to nerf basic survival mechanics until there’s no risk at all. 
---
The death penalties are already pretty weak but you can’t even handle them as they are. 
---
As the top commenter said, go play FO4 instead of trying change our game to suit your whims.
---
Yeah but that's my point, outside specific places it's not at all common for something every one needs for basic repairs. Unlike most resources that can easily be found  kinda everywhere if you just tag them and look around.
---
There are not many uses to Ballistic Fiber outside fixing your armor, but only repairing your armor requires lots of it as there are 5 pieces to repair. 
---
I might be wrong but I don't think most level 40 players know about Ballistic Fiber farm spots because you don't have much need for it before lvl 40. That's just my opinion, I imagine everyone has a different experience, like a stealth player that barely gets hit compared to a melee player.
---
If it bothers you, just nuke his camp
---
Why is it a waste of time?
---
You can also just drop them like anything else they just don't go in a paper bag. On PC it's the R button. It should say whatever button it is to 'drop' on you platform at the bottom of your pipboy. If you 'place' it like you're gonna get in it, it will just recall to your inv. If you drop them they just stay there till someone takes them or you log off.
---
Happened to me (XBox) couple of times last evening. I  got the event completed notice but no rewards and no item.
---
I saw that when i died from falling. It was the only way i could reach my junk. I just couldn't tell if it was the same area as they were talking about.
---
To be fair, it would be nice if Bethesda did introduce some new recipes and plans, even if that meant just making rarer plans purchasable without having to deal with aggressive RNG on top of that.  Or gave the Purveyor some kind of cap sink related to Legendaries.
---
Yeah I think they are really uncreative
---
Use whatever you have to raide.your int, and luck, then scrap as many pieces as you can get, and hope for the unlock.
---
I don't enjoy the grind of gathering lead and steel rather just sink caps into it.
---
You either vendor it when you need caps or use it for trading.
---
You disagree? So how it a risk of them taking my dropped loot? Please fill me in, because you didn't address that point at all
---
Also, I'll point out that I revived one of these guys, because it was a cooperative event; and they waited for me to bleed out specifically to steal this loot. managing to survive has little to do with it. The only reason I died is because I got too close to the radiation zone while running bloodied.
---
No, but this is why we need a flipping the bird emote as the correct tactical response to thumbs down :)
---
A motion assist servo mod to chest adds +2 strength
---
What's with you and offense man? Calm down please
---
I have an issue with the game mechanic... Jesus Christ...
---
I know that, but i’m using a jetpack since i enjoy its extra mobility.
---
Yes, I changed the color on PC [https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/c7etzn/quick\_reminder\_that\_you\_can\_change\_the\_color\_of/](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/c7etzn/quick_reminder_that_you_can_change_the_color_of/)
---
A few patches ago they did a major overhaul to power armor. That resulted in most PA pieces being removed from chassis’ and either landing on your character or in your stash. It also resulted in some extra pieces and chassis’ for some players. Most players were relocated to a train station to ensure that they were near a stash box. 
---
I don’t know the mechanics of all of it, or what exactly was changed, but I don’t recall any reports of anyone losing anything, just some confusion. At the time it was publicized on the main menu of the game and in patch notes—but if it’s been a while you would’ve missed all that. 
---
You just need to put your PA sets back on their chassis’ and scrap or drop any duplicate pieces. Then you’ll be back to normal.
---
Why should they have to have a risk?
---
Calm down guy lol yes hi is about as edgy as razor but boi I tell ya, reading all your comments on this post your working on being a sweater switchblade bud
---
I've got a kind of "in the air" camp, except I built it inside one of the electricity pylons near Harpers Ferry, so it's like I built up and used the pylon as a support.
---
Bethesda does a terrible job of explaining how things work in FO76
---
Definitely gonna need to put lots of creepy pumpkin men next to my laughing snowman &amp; waving santa. 
---
Let's hope there'll be some Halloween events at that time !
---
Maybe the way the game handles client latency. But I don't understand how this is the only game (that I know of) in which it happens.
---
I would like to see big patch fix in October.
---
Oh lord, I would love to hear what that means
---
[Server not responding...]
---
Lmao it was supposed to say serrated,  forget I said anything apperantly I can't even fucking write
---
Unequipping the high capacity backpack fixed this for me.
---
I think that last part sounds pretty reasonable, I still don't know how the cannot come up with a solution.
---
I have the armored, but I'll give it a shot, thanks
---
Honestly mate, you're genuinely offended. You're just projecting this on me. You don't even understand that I'm not even upset. I lost borderline nothing with that; I have an incredibly successful shop, I can just buy anything I need. 
---
I just think the game could be improved I there wasn't this vulture mechanic. Simple as. Please stop.
---
Place the diploma, but do not exit the build menu _before you first place another object_ (you can scrap that new object later if you wish to). If you want to move the diploma later, again, repeat.
---
Efficiency. I'd switch to SIMS2 or Minecraft if I wanted to build stuff. Some people prefer efficiency over decoration and repairs.
---
The worst kind of camps are those where the workbenches and vending machines are spread all over the place, to essentially force you to 'admire' the whole camp. If I come across one of these camps, I will lure a scorchbeast to it and I won't leave until the place is leveled.
---
You died because you’re weak and stupid. Darwin established this concept about 150 years ago. The other players survived their rewards are the direct result of your stupidity. Suck it up and move on
---
I suspect the reason is they just didn't do it.
---
 Place the diploma, but do not exit the build menu _before you first place another object_ (you can scrap that new object later if you wish to). And if you want to move the diploma later, repeat the procedure.
---
OK. That makes sense. 
---
But how am I being edgy? 
---
By saying (all be it not directly) that you don't need to constantly worry about losing materials that you can find literally laying around everywhere? 
---
That you don't desperately  need anything in this game?
---
I think it’s under display settings. It turns the screen into a pop up menu and gets rid of everything else.  It also helps you see your surroundings.
---
Or couldn't due to reasons
---
I like this. The fo4 special videos and maybe some of the other videos from NV and 3.
---
I want those halloween skins from creation club
---
I can confirm this, I use the same method
---
Is everyone duplicating posts now? This was just addressed in another thread.
---
The "fix" for this is to place the diploma, but do not exit your build menu _before you first place another object_ (you can scrap that new object later if you wish to). And if you want to move the diploma later, again, do the same thing.
---
On PS4 and I'm referencing the old style Fallouts before 76
---
Not sure. I don't think so. I'm fairly sure heart of the swamp is the one you wanna be doing
---
mate early game aluminum is like gold
---
You just list it on here for 1-1 I sold 35k last week
---
Which is annoying because I have only gotten that quest to start and work properly once, and I have played since the beta. Fuck my ass.
---
Theres also multiple nukes landing in the trailor for the game
---
What is your Strength in your Special?
---
It's funny that you say this, cuz on two or three different occasions I've had an extra set of power armor. I usually just drop both sets, pick mine up and leave. So far they haven't auto recalled
---
As far as I know, Power Armor brings your STR to 10 if you have it lower, but it doesn't negate the STR malus of some mutations.
---
I for example have 12 STR of my own, but several -STR mutations. With Class Freak and Power Armor, my "base" strenght in 9.
---
Personally I think it's ridiculous for people to be able to have naturally higher Strenght than a walking tank, even without counting the magic Unyelding bonuses. Power Armor should bring your STR to 15 since this is the new maximum value of the SPECIAL stats. In fact, I planned my build to keep my Strenght at 12, I was so disappointed when I discovered PA doesn't work like that.
---
its only happened to me once in the cranberry bog aria, i killed all four jets, and it went below the ground, seemed stuck there,another player and i tried ways of getting to it, he finally did destroy it mele just hitting the ground, but the stash was totally unreachable, nothing worked to get at it ... we both just gave up after a while
---
Well this is my official thread on the matter as opposed to the small comment i made in someone else's thread. There's a picture showing it off here xD. But yeah I'll give this fix a try. I just thought it's cool you can see the museum of freedom for some reason.
---
How? Empty cans are laying everywhere. 
---
You're walking around with so much material you arn't using but you don't pick up cans?
---
Niether, just calling out Mr.Edgy Edgerson for being the edgiest nigga to ever walk edge, he was just placing an opinion, to many folks fight on here over dumb shit, apologies for my first comment so it seems to be that I'm doing the same
---
I think they could get around this by not having pictures of the actual developers and just putting them on first name basis.
---
Glorious Bethesda Event design. I had to read it up too in order to understand what I need to do. Lvl 155
---
I’ll be honest I have a mountain side cliff CAMP in the Savage divide. But I also adjusted where my CAMP unit is and found that it changed the spawning a bit. So I don’t have anyone falling to their death anymore including myself. I chose the spot because I got tired of having to server hop constantly just to be able to have my CAMP. Now I have to do it once in a blue moon and I have the perfect set up for resources and placement of everything. Plus I have done my best to keep it immersive in structure and functionality
---
I just enjoy the natural sound track and sound of nature
---
Because theres no limit on the amount you can hold and 5.56 sells at 1 cap per so it's a way of holding more caps than max caps
---
After wastelanders drops they’ll be busy fixing its bugs
---
I think it would actually be a good opportunity for them to get closer to us if they did it right and honestly, I think some simple "stuff's hard ya'll" interviews would go a long way to ease some of the tension and give them a little slack on the time frame.
---
If I know Bob's out there working hard on fixing my weapons bugs but just having a hard time figuring out whats wonky, Id cut Bob some more slack, but if all I get is "here's some words from our corporate sponsors!" Id just get more frustrated.
---
Same. I have two haunted treehouses just waiting for the right decorations to finish them out.
---
This. It is so sad.
---
This is so sad, alexa play despacito
---
It's the internet. That's just what you do sometimes. 
---
Most of the time I try to be helpful or funny or whatever but sometimes I just wake up and feel like ignoring that voice in your head that tells you that it isn't worth your effort to bother. 
---
And edgy edgelords that just try to be badass has to be pretty close to the top of my least favorite cliches
---
I am perfectly calm. I just cant get my head that far up my own ass to see your point of view. My comment was not meant to personally attack anyone in particular. Not really my concern if you took it that way. If your nice enough to remove your turrets then good for you. However 99% of the people that are asked will either ignore it or start to troll. A lot of people only get limited time to play, myself included and should not have to constantly server hop especially with the buggy unstable servers in the hope they find one of the events turret free.not to mention when we play with friends and the whole team now has to hopefully find a server that works.  When the simple solution is Bethesda should make those zones building free until the event is over.not just on the basis of fairness but because i have personal seen prime meat get ruined when one of the enemy's gets stuck under a unreachable part of a building.causing the event to fail. I came here looking for a lively discussion and found someone clearly incapable of having one so i am done discussing this with you.
---
it should be this fall,take a look on the website
---
Well I couldn't agree more lol
---
Exactly. I think the game is “placing” your camp by building it - and when it hits a conflict FOR WHATEVER REASON, you get the message - not just another camp.
---
Wow - you’re a total piece of shit
---
I know right? Are we playing the same game?!
---
Whats your PSN? I'm a pretty good builder (practical and nice) and I can help build you a camp if you provide some of the basic amenities. I don't have any major turrets or the decon arch tho.
---
BUT I know someone who does.
---
Join our faction at r/PKOA . We all help eachother out, and nothing is for a price. It has "600" people but it's really a smaller number than that they're active. Maybe 50. There are people there who'll build you decon arches, turrets, weapons, armor, etc.
---
I can build you a fully modded hunting rifle or fully mod a pump action shotgun on top of your camp if you want.
---
Well apologies for being "incapable" of having an discussion, didn't mean to make you piss your panties bud , you came at me first anyway lol but yea have a good one man , sorry for absolutely just wasting your time with this unintelligible conversation mr.internet guy
---
I just started building floating camps to provide easy access to stash, beds, benches, etc to anyone who needed them at events. Never done it before and I've only experienced friendly players who seem appreciative. Unlike before.
---
It seems they attract the kind of players I want to play with and according to these comments, makes the ones I don't wanna play with walk away, so I'm a convert despite how it effects immersion boners. I'll make it look better later if it doesn't effect portability. But this is the fucking apocalypse in a universe where crazy shit exists everywhere. 
---
You have a problem with floating camps breaking your version of reality? There's a fucking space alien fighting a Sheepsquatch in front of my camp when I spawn in this morning. I'm gonna go ahead and say things work a little differently in here than in actual reality.
---
Yes I really do not like the floating sky box houses but I think they are just a result of the lack of foundational building tools.  The game had better options for laying the foundation of your house I think you would see way way less of them.
---
Are you already at 15S?
---
Yup people with those kinds of camps are
---
Use the frog in a jar, it shows damage numbers without actually taking any damage. 
---
If you need to find frogs, go look in the Whitesprings pool. They always spawn there. :)
---
No, currently at 10 (9 by mutations)
---
New max value? Been away a minute, did they lower the cap on how high SPECIAL stats can go?
---
With the current system they are trying to stop all the leaks and serious problems of the game ... but I BELIEVE, that from next year they will be more involved with the community with the issue of test servers (they have no other ...) .
---
Right now it is that with the lack of current transparency ... we can only complain and suggest things ... I continue to collect errors ... but they do not report correctly when they fix them: / ... or worse, when they return to break XD.
---
That’s more clear. The poster made it sound like a player could instantly convert the ammo to caps when you may have to wait hours or even days for other players to buy enough to satisfy your cap needs.
---
Lol cya hick
---
**Just Curious**, *Hellvent*: I'm not clear on the Eyebot's motivation (this **is** FO-76). Was it leading rad-rat babies "over" the bridge or "off" an edge somewhere to their death?   ...but now that i think about it, even a *blind* rad-rat baby could likely fall off a ten-story church and not die!    lol    
---
Thanks. Would love to have been there!  Next time grab your video camera and call FOX News.
---
I just double checked, the message is there.
---
How do you know the Queen has explosive resistance? My explosive lever and railways hit her harder than my non-explosive.
---
Buying an online game used? Does he test if the stove is hot with his wang?
---
I really don’t want to see the result of Bethesda adding in another form of limitations to CAMP layouts by making them structurally sound too
---
I don’t mind floating camps, but I despise floating shops.
---
Make chally's feed beforehand and drop it for other players.  Best thing you can do imo.  That, and hop servers until you get one not full of idiots.
---
And if you are on drums or spits, you can periodically take a break to add more prime meat and chally feed then go right back to the instruments.  If everyone is on point, the event takes just a few minutes to pull off.

---
As for "not available"... then this port is mapped to something else and you've found the problem. Correct it and you should be good to go.
---
I admit to zero musical talent :P
---
“If you list them I will buy them.” 
---
You sound like field of dreams
---
“If you build it, they will come.”
---
the hardhat, not the regular hat, at the armor workbench, no need for plans or to scrap any beforehand
---
it is annoying
---
Why do you need crystal?
---
Yep that was the reference I was making
---
Even a 2 star? I figured it was barely better than scrip level.
---
I use several different energy weapons, including heavy ones. Plus making film for the camera takes a lot of crystal as well.
---
Is that quest public now? Seen quite a few players at it since last patch.
---
Yeah and camp budget is a literal joke too
---
Oh okay gotcha, was like damned that's a severe nerf if they did reduce the cap in 76.
---
Lol probably pure lack of parents in their life. Try submitting a ticket for the  microsoft team and they might let you change it
---
Nw is a mini match not a full game mode and survival is dead. What about those in between people who are playing the game as intended? Those who pve and pvp ethically so to speak. I enjoy when I am attacked and get to test out new gear. That's the fun of earning new gear to me. What else in the game poses the same challenge as another player? I do agree on some of the points here, such as a timer to defend. My fear going forward though is that with such posts beth will water down pvp to the point of irrelevancy.
---
I thought it was the inside of VTU. Just trying to imitate a reflection.
---
Just hover over it in the build menu. You should see + and - for stats that will change in the stats card.
---
This is karma for planting flamingos. &lt;snicker&gt;...sorry, just kidding.
---
I used to have a camp like that
---
I mean a lot of it is portability. It's hard to build a nice camp that you can place anywhere you are. If i come into my friends server and my spot is taken up all i need to do is place my one camp on one foundation.
---
Ok but breaks wouldn't lock up you'd simply have your car turn off. And that doesn't explain people dead in what looks like stopped traffic going into the white springs.
---
Are energy weapons good? I see people calling them trash all the time.
---
Thanks for all your helpful feedback :) and my first gold. Never imagined this would reach so much notice. I like Fallout a lot and it's nice to see other people being so supportive.
---
You’ll probably find it in player’s vending machine before having it drop from Heart of the Swamp. 
---
I paid 10k caps for mine and considered myself very lucky. I would have paid up to 20k
---
You know, I didn’t even know there was a cap limit. I’m so poor lol
---
I LOATHE these things. I think a good solution however would be to REMOVE THE REQUIREMENT FOR A FOUNDATION PIECE. It prevents a lot of placements against other objects like rocks and trees. It can be really irritating. (Although I do know that it may screw up Stored options)
---
But, they’re so immersion breaking. Just stop making them, people. They’re hideous.
---
All the copper you have.  All of it.  
---
Flux if it's 100 caps, sometimes 150.  
---
Cheap acid and fiber optics too.
---
Funny how often they don't though......
---
I think you meant 😢😢😢😢👶👶👶👶. All I can say is that you're welcomeeeeee. Yes i tied moana in that.
---
Nope I meant 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
---
I was talking about this with my friends the other day, the e3 footage looked slightly gloomier and way more unique. The atmosphere looks better in those early screenshots of the game that are still used to promote it as well, like in the GeForce experience app. They were probably just color graded and edited individually for the e3 videos and photos but man I wish the game still looked like that.
---
Already posted this to another thread:
---
This will probably get downvoted but I'm really happy they didn't do it this time too. I play since the official release and *never* moved my camp out of the forest since I placed it there for the first time. It since became my second (virtual) home and if they had done this it would all be gone because it's build right by the forest prime meat location. My outer fence is nearly touching the barrel that starts the event.
---
It sucks I know but I wouldn't move my beloved camp even if it would prevent starting the event. I put so many hours of work and fine tuning into it that would be lost. But I would get rid of my turrets if they would steal the other players kills. Luckily there is just one and the enemies usually just run past it.
---
EDIT: People that do this on purpose to annoy other player are assholes tho
---
Ok you win I'm not posting that many. Lol
---
I've visited camps where you had to trek through the entire structure to find all 4 vending machines. Once you got to a machine, it contained 1* legendary gear priced at 10k+. Those players had no interest in selling anything, they just wanted people to see their sad life-work. 
---
Upon leaving one, I took one last glance at the foundations that still stood and though: "Yep, this was worth the 50 caps fast travel fee."
---
One of my characters uses a simple instigating pump shotgun. Sometimes, it causes weird regenerating damage: it hurts and then health pops back a bit. I think it Is because of server issues. It Is not fun.
---
"hate" is a strong word. 
---
Not strong enough I'm afraid
---
Instead of adding another currency Beth should finally implement an ammo-exchange like we've been asking for, for ages.
---
Soon we will find out why they kept the harpoon's gun ability to be shot underwater in the game
---
Well best i can tell while meat week does give a few rewards for finishing the events i don't think the rewards are very good. Yeah you get a LOT of different types of meat but if you have the cannibal perk you dont really need it. I usually sell it. The weapon you get from completing the cookout event is blueprints for a throwable meat cleaver. Some other typical stuff stimpaks and such but nothing you couldnt get in another event. (Besides the meat cleaver)
---
Amazing idea, finally an opportunity to sell some ammo
---
I started selling bulk plastic for 20 when I got 700 units... Lol. Sells decently.
---
Well this should be fun! Honestly it would be cool for underwater fallout fights and more danger added to the lakes in fallout.
---
Dude, you're giving away info about the 'secret' path! 😉
---
Not prestige / legendary players, they said delayed until Q1 2020 and you KNOW they'll take till the end of it
---
I got one from Queen of the hunt last week. I have been doing the mire dailies since the beta.
---
Yes you can.
---
You can save yourself from hauling around bags of recyclables by simply contacting the owner of the camp that has them listed. Almost everyone who has thousands of 5mm rounds would be happy to entertain an offer on them.
---
It's been a while since I read it, I probably forgot the particulars.
---
i am picking up cans but repairing everything i have eats up a ton of aluminum
---
Go check mine out haha. I spent waaaaaay too much time on mine. Ill see if I can't post a pic later when I get home
---
I got one from Queen of the hunt last week. I have been doing the mire dailies since the beta.  The only reliable way is to grind the events.
---
No percentages in the game stack like that it, it goes priority perk then armor perk then chem, so it would be 50% of 100 then another 50% of that 50% so you would be taking around 25% of the fall damage which is barely nothing so gg man
---
You can place a floor in mid air, but many times cannot place it in the ground.  It's not the best system.
---
Wait, whats voice text? Is there a setting so mic output will appear as text? Because that would be extremely helpful for me
---
I never move mine lol. But apparently I'm in a non desirable location haha.
---
Also if you just bring up your pipboy, I believe what would be the “back” button on an Xbox controller is what does it. At the bottom of the pipboy where it tells you to level up will have an option and it says “Change Display” or something. I’m not on right now so can’t say for certain but yea it’s super easy you can do it in like 3 seconds.
---
Give us the option to kill raiders on sight 😀
---
Where I am has many mag spawns, bobble spawns, and more rare junk than you could ever need. Also near an event that grants 3 legendaries to either scrip or sell to nübs.
---
I suspect you already know the answer. Yes, other people hate them, too. This C.A.M.P. configuration is not for you, it's for the people who build them. For their use, their convenience. There's no obligation for anyone to create a C.A.M.P. to the frankly unknowable specifications/expectations of every single other player of Fallout 76.
---
It applies when modded. but it doesn't effect the weight that is gained from the mod.
---
Minigun weights 20lb, weightless is 2lbs. add tri barrel mod and you're back up to 18lbs
---
Gottem
---
Holy Rule 6 violation batman
---
That stinks. What about the build connected to the stair case. Not the foundation but the thinner floors
---
You see the numbers, you hear the 'hit', but no real damage. I find myself running behind molerats like it's a cartoon, whacking and whacking.

Floating camps serve a purpose but  I 100 percent agree their hideous.

You can’t cry either

I liked a pale mint green for mine.
---
After 1500 hours in WV, it would probably look really weird.
---
The end of the Tenderizer is part of an old water mine or at least resembles it's very heavily.
---
Oh that’s the magic sauce. I couldn’t figure out how to replicate placing it ok the first time
---
I just shoot atom shop things in other players camps.
---
I spend wayyyy too much time on my home in Appalachia for you to just plop a set of stairs and go foundation crazy.
---
I really enjoy when someone takes the time to make their base a real home. I've got a few friends who don't have walls but built into a cave, which ps looks cool AF, or they build up into an electrical tower.... All of which makes sense and they took the time to make it look and feel right. 
---
If my friend in the tower ever re-logs I want to grab a few shots of it, I tried to replicate it but couldn't get the floor positions right. 
---
But thank you to all of you that take your time with your base. I do it. And I appreciate it when I see it.
---
Yeah I use CAMP objects. Atom shop ones tend to show damage if your in someone else’s camp
---
Destroyed.
---
Can't you read?
---
He doesn't care what bullshit reason you came up with to make a stupid camp.
---
Well that's fair enough, vendors shouldn't be deep in the building anyways, and that's for sure some overpriced stuff. Guess some people will do anything for the aesthetic
---
Really I didn't know that. Think I'm gonna set up a little range of frog jars.
---
Very good, way to plan ahead. I hope player are reading this and getting pointers.  Thank u the feed thing is a great idea
---
100% it ruins my immersion. But I have to say, it makes coming across well built and immersive camps that much better, and it takes me back to a previous post on here about tip jars. I think people need to be rewarded for their realism and dedication
---
I hate them, but not because they break physics... I hate them because I always walk in as the person logs off. Leaving me to fall to my death and begin the trek back to collect all my shit Haha.
---
By the sounds of this post, it sounds like they are worth more to you than that. Way more...
---
Sounds important to keep that little baby of yours fed and healthy. My, my... We have ourselves a predicament.
---
You have a need and people seem to be supplying your need with time and craftsmanship. Let's face it, the ammo you are buying isn't always found just laying on the ground, people make it. They take their time to search and horde materials to feed all your hungry miniguns and you want to take their hard work and flush it away with some non backed currency. A crypto currency.
---
I fell for someone selling a credit card once, I won't fall for it again!
---
Hard working people should be paid a fair wage for their trouble and hospitality.
---
I too dislike these camps. My wife and I LOVE going around to peoples camps and we have a little rating system.
---
Floating is minus points.
---
Nah. Xbox
---
on novice they eventually stop spawning, on standard and expert it is endless spawns
---
Sorry if I'm harsh dont mean to be.
---
I don't move mine for 2 reasons. One, the layout is wicked complicated and won't replace easily or as one unit. And two .. I have a pet Deathclaw that won't follow the camp, I'd have to go re-tame and walk it back to my camp... Which taming those things is a real bitch sometimes.
---
I want..... to decorate my house.... with JUNK... Sooooo mother Hubbard flippin’ bad!!!!!
---
What I hate is finishing my structure of my camp, then going to decorate it... finding out that i have met my limit. Annoying as hell
---
You aren't angry??
---
I got mine from the event always vigilant. Maybe give those a go as well?
---
Pumpkin spice nuka shine here we come...  🎃
---
I actually removed I because people like you were crying over it lol...
---
Both ideas would have the same outcome. But there's no way to drop an item at the moment so that wouldn't work. Never used the OCDecorator app myself so sorry if I've misunderstood.
---
It is definitely a team raid. Also the enemy's are there to be a pain. Not to be the main thing, it's about finishing the puzzles and moving on. You shouldn't be try to wipe out all the enemy's
---
Having a beautiful house IS my endgame!!
---
I had some issues while attempting to rework a 2nd floor balcony that made removing the interior floors a problem. Constant restricted access warnings. I'm on a hillside, you can just jump onto the balcony. 
---
Don't know if the floor would be wrecked if the CAMP was a nuke target, tho  🤔
---
You have major issues dude... You really shouldn't get so upset over something like this
---
BE gatling plasmas get around the explosive resistance with sheer DPS. There is a mod for Gatling Plasmas that is broken currently on the normal, non-legacy gatling plasmas called a "Splitter". The Splitter gives the already fast-firing weapon 2 projectiles per-shot. Then people stack another mod on the thing that does burning damage. So in effect you get DPS so massive that even though each shot doesn't do much individual damage, the little that gets through the Queen's armor per shot happens so fast that it amounts to hundreds of points of damage per second. Armor in 76' is capped at around ~90-95% (I think. I know it's around there somewhere) so a tiny percentage of damage always gets through, even if the target has more armor than the attacking weapon does damage. That's why you can even HIT the Queen with a Gatling Plasma to begin with, even though she has 300DR, 300ER, and something like 6-800 Explosive resistance (It's a LOT, but I'm not sure how much. Rest assured it is a silly amount, though.). It's the same mechanic that allows you to still slightly damage anything that has more armor than the damage you can deal. 
---
So yeah, they might only be doing 20 damage, but they are hitting the damn Queen 10 times per second, and setting her on fire. The Explosive effect is just one of only 2 ways to add extra damage on the second Legendary Star slot (Along with Aim Damage), so it slightly increases the over-all damage and hence the small percentage that gets through to hit the Queen and that translates to a pretty substantial DPS boost. It might only be an extra 5 damage per hit, but hit something 5x per second like I said, and that 5 damage stacks up pretty quick. And on things that AREN'T the Queen and don't have massive explosive damage, Explosive is the best secondary effect to have on the Gatling Plasma for general use. So people want Explosive. And don't forget the splash damage is useful too if you miss.
---
Sorry, understanding that takes some explaining. I know it seems counter-intuitive. A final note on Legacy Explosive Gatling Plasmas: Your kind-of an asshole if you use one. The massive amount of calculations the game has to make to keep up with all the hits and damage numbers during an already server-straining Queen fight can cause the server to crash, ruining everyone else's time. And when the plasma goo-ifying death kicks in on an enemy the goo-ified enemies won't respawn again till the server re-sets. So if you are trying to, say, farm super mutants at West Tech and find half of them just aren't there and goo piles are laying all over the place, you can bet some dick with a legacy GP was there before you. And to top it off, they kill shit so fast they tend to stop anyone else being able to tag legendary enemies, and make you a nearly-invincible PVP troll. So yeah, fuck legacy weapons. Especially Explosive Gatling Plasmas. IMO, they need removed from the game for balance and stability reasons.
---
My PS4 can barely run as is. Wish this game was more efficient. Needs a new engine.
---
I hear ya, I've got some two shot missile launchers and MIRV fatmans and they break so easily, I'm always running out of aluminum to fix them.
---
Right?!
---
Sad that this game is far uglier than Red Dead, Fornite, and Apex, yet runs far worse.
---
My high level guy made a modified version on a gas station idea I saw. I made a gas station. I love my gas station - but it needs garbage on its shelves, dernit.
---
+karma ty!
---
I see the down voters are already at it, nice going kids :)
---
It's funny because there are all these restrictions on camp building, can't place down objects that intersect anything, can't  attach floors to foundations, "removing this would make part of the camp inaccessible," etc. And presumably these are in place to prevent this sort of thing. But what they actually do is make building a *good* camp a major headache, and actually encourage just plopping down a single foundation or a floating platform or whatever.
---
And hey, at least they'll be able to move their camp without rebuilding it from scratch...
---
I want to romance an assaultron, just for the little baby assaultrons destroying my camp with their lasers. But that's just me.
---
I’d love more emotes - and they should be removed from the Atomic shop and given freely. Most MMOs have dozens to hundreds of these for little to no cost.
---
This. Me and a friend ran the first raid, on novice, just the two of us. We managed to make it to the strangler heart fight at the end, but that was after a lot of deaths stimpacks, ammo, radaway. We definitely should have had atleast one more person if not a full team. We wiped on the strangler, and a full wipe kicks you all the way out of the vault to the beginning.
---
if you're talking about the tooltip damage specifically, a DB is about twice as powerful as a combat shotgun.
---
You should be able to toggle both on permanently so you get to choose.
---
they are lazy and ugly.
---
200 years early ...
---
Just set some up at the Forts.
---
Those are not the only rewards... There are unique clothing, unique weapons (tenderizer + several mods for it, firework mines, cleavers), and camp plans as rewards. Plus tons of scrip. Meat is not really a major part of meat week oddly enough...
---
Ooh, nice one! If an assaultron can dress up like a Sheepsquatch, theres no reason it couldn’t also dress up like your wife!
---
And the other side of the continent...
---
No... I hate pennies in real life...lol
---
The game has trouble registering the damage caused by my shotgun and you want it to be able to make room for joy and laughter?
---
Shame, yeah though post an album and ill have a look
---
Like the HUD and pipboy colour in F3 inwards before 76 lol but either way that sounds like your a fan of doughnuts lol
---
+karma.  Glad to help out
---
Hey, you choose to be invisible. Compromise. That's why I don't wear Chameleon with half my characters.
---
Yes. Yes, i do.

The only companion you will get is Preston Garvey The First, Great great great great Grandfather of Preston Garvey of the Minutemen. And all he will say is, “A settlement will need your help, very soon.”

---
Wow wasn't it yet?
---
Check your geography, bro
---
Even fuzz would be nice. Fuzz, and a VCR that we can plug in our games to view or have some have B roll videos (stuff that are either fake movies or public domain or something). 
---
Truthfully, these are the things that make or break Fallout games. I love the old 50s style, but Bethesda needs to remember that it is a different dimension where nuclear tech is ever present. Why can’t we lean to more modern stuff that feels old school? Have TV have holotape support! It’d be awesome.
---
10. Surprise! Due to FEV exposure now YOU’RE pregnant! Repeat steps 2.-9.
---
I did. Not my problem that you don't bother to rewad patch notes.
---
Just do it as you level up past 50.
---
You get to pick either a card or special change. It's not that difficult... They have it in the game already you have to work and play for it.
---
Hey! I still can’t find DRAM power phase control. Any idea on how to find it? When using the search function there’s no ‘DRAM phase control’, not an expert so idk what I should do.
---
Do you have any strength bonuses on your regular armor that gets removed when you put on the PA? If so, may be that they are equivalent...
---
Or at least be able to scrap it for gunpowder &amp; metal.
---
I mean an airship like prydwen
---
Mine works but you have to place it without touching anything. Store it an place it on an empty wall without touching anything. If you place it an hover over it or select it again it will do that. Hopefully it works for you. Took me a while to get it to work too.
---
I see ppl in ad mode who never show up and thought it was a setting adjustment. Been trying to figure it out.
---
Ya it’s a different backpack. Morgantown is the Small Backpack &amp; the Tadpole quest gives you the ability to make the full size one.
---
Definitely. But I’d love to add my own. It’s not like anyone else can hear them.
---
I really want to build a nice looking camp, but every time I've tried to do that it is Impossible to move it because of some error. Then last time I moved my camp, saw that the area wouldn't fit it, then moved it to a different area where it worked. Problem is the game deleted everything that wasn't in the main building. As a lower level player, I went to the floating camp out of necessity, not because of some meta or because I don't want to build a nice looking camp. The real issue is fixing the mechanics and bugs associated with building so it is easy to build a nice camp that is reasonably mobile (camp in question here was 2x5 tiles and should be easy to move).
---
Stop hoarding.
---
It's clear people have a hoarding problem when stuff like this comes up in conversation in the game.
---
There is no reason to hold onto all the junk you have and items you have. Get rid of them and you will feel much better.
---
I was so stoked when I found the red barn prints for 150 caps, so I built a 2-story place with a patio.  I've got a workshop on the ground floor and a showcase and patio on the top floor.
---
My absolute pet hate of this game and such an eye sore🤢🤮
---
Here’s mine: https://imgur.com/ZSXqUPW &amp; https://imgur.com/OyYZIGF
---
And by fev exposure, I assume you mean having relations with a super mutant. Lol. Be careful out there female vault dwellers!
---
It looks like shit and ia ugly and terrible. Your camp is an abomination and you should feel ashamed. You are not clever. You are not cool.
---
Like WAYYYYYY more
---
Those plans a relatively new. They're for a smaller variant so that newbie players have an easier time managing their carry weight. In order to get the standard backpack recipe (which will unlock the ability to use the Atomic Shops packs.) you have to do the Pioneer Scouts mission and rank up from Tadpole to Possum. Go to any train station in the game and you'll find a Pioneer Scout poster that'll start the quest chain. There's plenty of tutorials on YouTube on how to earn Tadpole badges as well.
---
I'd be happy if I could put most instruments in a display case. I've got banjos, steel guitars and an accordion sitting in my stash. My violin works, but my trumpet goes out the side of the case.
---
I just want the option to put my character name above my person instead of my username. That’s all I ask. PLEASE!
---
Honestly, because I find 5mm pretty easy to come across and craft in large amounts, I’d say it’s an easy 2 to 1 ratio, or if you’re stretching it, 3 to 1.
---
Do you have the stimpak diffuser plan?
---
I'm sure you'll find naming your weapons quite satisfying!

I have my own solution for super-mutants who rush in on a girl, so close all I see is their eye-level personal junk.  I use a black-powder pistol I call n*uder-duder*.

For *scorch*, I have a double-barrel called *Tongue Depressor*. &lt;snicker&gt;

Yeah. We’re in West Virginia. Is there a secret ocean in West Virgini——-ahhh!! We need a DLC with a secret ocean!!!!
---
2 friends of mine just got that nice ban email from Bethesda saying that running a mule is exploiting the game. They never dup, scam or grief so it sounds like Beth maybe cracking down on exploits. I’ll see if I can get one to shoot me a pic of the message.
---
Don't worry about it mate.
---
This lol. Same here, in all honesty id love a massive bug sweep before anything else is added. 👍👍👍
---
The airship was made by the BOS. It wasn't prewar.
---
I know Bethesda doesn't totally care about their lore meaning anything all the time but... It would make no sense.
---
Damn ive only ever done the cookout once. I tried once before that and got dropped from the server so i wasnt to jazzed when the time i did finish it i only got what i did but i guess ill give it another go.
---
You know that train by the meatweek local in the cranberry bog? Thats my home
---
Yea, sure. I'll just drop all my legacy gat plasmas and armor sets at wss...
---
Fallout has always been a hoarding game for me and 76 is a trading game for me. And as a trader, there is every reason to hoard stuff.
---
I've gone out and bought an extra copy to transfer the stuff that I wouldn't even trust the highest karma user with. 
---
So nah, I'm not just gonna drop it.
---
Yes, I believe there were but I don't recall which side threw the first punch.  Both the humans and the arachnids are highly intelligent species that desire the same galactic real estate, it was inevitable that conflict would break out.
---
How about bringing down a Vertibird? Oh wait that’s already in the game.
---
Hey, I'm just saying, if I'm in a group that's getting absolutely slaughtered because the game is bugging out to shit, I wanna laugh about it.
---
I just want the Chameleon perk to be lore worth using. Maybe complete lack of motion (or minor movement) means complete Hidden from enemies. They won’t even attack where you used to be. It’d be great for Pacifists.
---
Yeah I understand. You are right. i delete the comment
---
10-15% Increase in budget would go along way.  I agree the build system in fallout 4 was great. Being online  and visiting random camps that are amazing is my 76 end game . Giving the player base that are camp builders a small increase in budget won’t break the game.  I can also argue that the camp builders are the reason the game is profitable . We buy atoms to build our post apocalyptic Barbie dream homes. Without our purchases , fixing the game and updating it as often as it does wouldn’t be a priority for the company. Maybe giving the player base that continues to finance the games development is wise .
---
there's a few wikis, none of them are complete, between them and this sub I find all the info I need, just Google what you want to know
---
Mine is up high but, I threw supports on the four corners that (almost) reach the ground... Three of the four will not let me put one more column.
---
Nope, I just bought them a couple minutes ago for a ludicrous amount but yea idc
---
Jangles is undisplayable. There you go.
---
I see you commenting on anyone who doesn’t like floating camps... are you chairman of the floating camp society bro? 😂
---
only read the title, did you?
---
You have been killed by "F***face".
---
And yet still when you're trying to build a regular house on a nice spot, "the item is floating"
---
Hehhehee. Possible. And I’m not complaining. But I love my character names and I have being called by my username in teams.
---
There's a trick with stairs and half wooden floors to put the metal poles down on a corner to look great. But sadly they take a lot of budget...
---
Also you may have better luck posting this as it's own topic be it this is a thread about flair.
---
honestly they should make event areas no camp zones, it isn't the best solution but it's better than how it is now
---
You vent, I vent. Simple as that.
---
I just hate seeing a post-apocalyptic survival game change into SIMS2 with pretty camps and colorful plushies. At the hands of a few crybabies on Reddit. That's all :)
---
Could you put the trumpet in either of the middle slots? Oh and I'm gonna have to get a violin now! Where did you get it?
---
Quit gatekeeping and play the game the way you wanna play, and let everyone else play the way they wanna play. 
---
Seriously wtf are you like 12? Grow up
---
Likely we will see it in the atomic shop then!
---
no but that doesn’t stop the flood of unreasonably aggravated messages I get lol
---
My camp is on the cliff directly above that spot. I was always extremely curious as to why players were spawning there so on a whim I investigated yesterday as well. 
---
There’s nothing special about that spot save directly in the center of that location, there’s a toolkit sitting in the dirt, very randomly in the middle of nowhere. I suspect it was placed there by Bethesda to visually mark the location.
---
the craft is called an airship, the Prydwen was the name of one used by the east coast BOS
---
Post apocalyptic survival game, but yet you defend those stupid floating camp eyesores? Not sure I follow your logic, if you think having a pretty camp and coloured plushies is immersion breaking and floaty camps aren’t I think that’s pretty stupid.
---
You dont need to put them on top of anything. They will clip to the floating structure by themselves, and if you can place a half floor down, you can get the steel beam to clip onto the corner properly.
---
Yeah and shame it’s such a shit weapon too, considering the effort required.
---
Is this the latest bios for the board ?
---
Have a look under Advanced, maybe it's moved there on your board / bios ?
---
But, anyway, the most important one of those 2 Phase settings is the CPU one, so you should be good :)
---
What's the atomic shop standee? I see it everywhere here.
---
Ik why isn’t green like the rest of fallout games. I mean it’s not game braking or really a bother at all, but it’s one the first things I noticed in the beta.
---
This was posted.... some time ago on here. But this is what I listen to while playing. It’s got a good mix in of commercials and radio plays. I feel like it gives a good depth besides just music. [spotify link here](https://open.spotify.com/user/k-mizer/playlist/0aNguvibqd3uMEb1AJzf4g?si=Ion75atEQ_auWN9TG1xoxg)
---
I don't shop at these camps. Super high or over a cliff? Not getting my caps.
---
They're pretty gross.
---
I would love this. Even though my camp is fully furnished, it feels empty without having stuff on tables, bookshelves, etc. And I like the plushies and all that, but I'm not going to decorate the whole place strictly with that stuff.
---
It's mostly because people want to move their camp frequently and that's the only type that will easily place down anywhere.
---
Secondarily it's because some people are too lazy to build proper defenses and keep up with materials to fix routine damage so if it's floating it's less prone to mob damage.
---
sorry if you found it weird, I looked it over its pretty straight forward. I shouldn’t be receiving a constant flow of hate messages just because they dropped meat weak on my camp location. My camp was there long before the concept of meat weak was conceived, and it will be there long after. Like I said nuke away its your right ill just hop servers. I ain’t relocating.
---
This is a great suggestion. I usually have at least as much for sale on me as is in my vendor.
---
It especially bothers me in NW. Don't know how many times I've missed, because I can't see the tiny beige dot.
---
Ive had legendaries on every event i have done since the last update. Maybe im just lucky
---
Lol I usually do third person in NW. it helps a lot
---
Why wouldn’t they though? They’re a commercial company and have to make money. It’s a product in a free marketplace that we choose to buy so idk why everyone feels so entitled?
---
So do I, it's why I can't see it, lol
---
Oh seriously I feel dumb now
---
I was aware of the splitter but wasn't sure whether or not the damage was visible. I was seeing constant 3-4s, I assumed the 3s were from the exlosive damage but maybe they were hits from the splitter. Even with the burn, explosive and splitter damage it doesn't seem very impressive when the base damage is 4. I don't know how much damage extra damage any of those three do but I doubt it's more than the base damage of the gun. Hypothetically, let's say they all add another 3 per shot. That would put you at 13 per shot at 910 RPM- 197 DPS
---
Then let's compare to semi auto Prime JE Railway that does 230 per hit(without crits) at 100 RPM- 383 DPS
---
And then compare to the automatic QE Railway. 87 per hit 750 DPS- 1087 DPS
---
I'm sure after you factor in the damage per mag and reload speed the BE Gatling would probably gain a bunch of long term DPS but it still seems rather weak for "the best gun."
---
There was a cardboard standee outside of Train Stations that you could interact with in game to take you to the Atom Store. They weren't around for too long though as players complained it was immersion breaking, which I can kinda agree with.
---
To you they are stupid, to effient players they are convenient and practical.
---
Besides I'm not defending anything. I'm attacking crybaby circlejerking in this godforsaken subreddit.
---
I try to make mine look luke a rugged cabin with a decent workshop. And make the vendors easy to find and accessible
---
it seems we dont
---
It would probably be easier to implement bulk ammo. A pack of 100 5mm would be much better for selling.
---
You do it just doesn't actually show that you gained any like before. When the little icon with the vault boy blowong on the meat shoes up, that's the notification that your deposit was successful.
---
Have my name as flair - oh, you mean Reddit flair. (I was thinking in-game flair. Gotcha.)
---
That seems incredibly unnecessary.
---
Let's just let the guy have his post, ok?
---
I would finally have a use for all my communist propaganda flyers
---
Yeah, you put the item in a "container" and it spits out a static object you can move in workshop mode. Also I meant OCDispenser. Guess my brain isn't working today.
---
And you're the judge, right?
---
Use pip boy. Before and after. Works evey time.
---
The pre beta was October 23rd. Xbox had it first but yeah it came out in November. I ended up getting the Vampire Costume that was for halloween.
---
&gt;The massive amount of calculations the game has to make to keep up with all the hits and damage numbers during an already server-straining Queen fight can cause the server to crash, ruining everyone else's time.
---
I've had this happen way too much. The Minigun always seems to be the culprit for me but I'm sure the Gatling plasma is worse. If I stand anywhere near the minigun for the fight I'll have "sound lag" for 5+ minutes. I'll hear all of the noises from the fight 5 minutes later while I'm just sitting at my camp lol.
---
There was the Vampire costume that was released near the very beginning as well as the nuka girl costume, both of which i have xD
---
Just a thought, play the drums or turn spit and u still get the prizes dont need prime meat to join meat cook just show up and play the drums. Good luck
---
heeeyy, keep away from the  assaultrons, they are all mine, already proposed to them, we are just waiting for the update, so we can have Bethesdas blessing :D
---
8k for 3k... Thats what i put on the sign. Just have to find me and I'll happily come back home and trade.
---
Hahaha, this made me lough, very good, i want this :D
---
Well, that's debatable on many fronts. Heinlein was pro-military and the government of Earth in the novel was a militaristic democracy that arose after the collapse of earlier democratic models that required military service for the right to vote. Under a society like that, yeah, war was probably inevitable. A less militaristic society may have investigated diplomacy more thoroughly or even considered mutually beneficial cohabitation.
---
That opens up a whole different can of worms about basic human nature, though.
---
"I'm sure after you factor in the damage per mag and reload speed the BE Gatling would probably gain a bunch of long term DPS but it still seems rather weak for "the best gun.""
---
Pretty sure we are on the same page, here. I don't think it's the "Best" either. I have a Prime Bloodied Vats Crit Reload Speed Gauss Rifle that absolutely slays Queens. Myself and 2 other friends took her down just the 3 of us on an empty server, and I did all the damage. They just killed all the trash enemies and teased her into landing. I do around 1k per shot, over 2k on a crit. The Queen has 32k health, so with my VATS set-up and build I can kill her in about 25 shots, which is 5 clips from the Gauss (This isn't counting her regen. It's probably closer to 33 shots, total).
---
Single foundation camps can be moved practically anywhere
---
I thought I was misrembering
---
I'm sure with wastelanders it would make sense to have a human DJ along with more radio content
---
Read and listen, I try to talk to them through game chat, but they don't listen.
---
shoot the bulletproof graham in the face?
---
More like lazy and uncreative😂You sound like an angry guy...
---
You can't hurt Grahm though, is it a symbolic bullet?
---
Love Amber color and works better for an actual flashlight / area illumination. 
---
Believe you can mess with the values on PC but would only modify locally
---
If you know you can home share games with other xbox users, meaning 2 people can use 1 copy of any game simultaniously.
---
I for one hate pvp. There's no fun with it if you are just going to gang up 4 people with Bloody Explosive gatling plasmas vs one guy with a bloody Explosive Gatling gun. Where's the fun in that?
---
This is truly the stupidest reason for PvP I've ever seen.
---
burp that baby honey.... booooom.
---
16 tons and what do you get?
---
On older Fallouts yeah not in console obviously lol don't get why they haven't added it into F76 yet though maybe lore wise the pipboys were 1st gen?
---
As far as I know you can’t move the boundaries of the camp without starting all over again. I hope somebody tells me I’m wrong because that’d be great.
---
I lost my camp and haven't played since, it's stuck in my stored section and it wasn't my first time spending hours on a camp and this happened to me and yeah floating camp's suck.
---
If CAMP building was more like settlement building, which was by far a better system, then it would be easier for floating camps to exist... but it would also deter this since we could build some cool sh!t since we’d have less limitations. Not being able to place stairs on a single square floor as opposed to ONLY the middle of a 2x2 irks the p!ss out of me.
---
Another thing to consider is it being viewed as an unfair advantage if you choose a bring color that illuminates better than the default green. But yeah being an initial gen model is a good lore excuse
---
I got thru or to the residential area twice now and get killed by a gang of crickets. On novice they do stop but there is a lot. I sugest going to each place and finding a spot to hold up. Then you chill for like 10 mins picking off mobs till they stop.
---
Yeah fair point and I'd agree with that lol
---
My advice: Search the sub for "returning."
---
Wow that's awesome. I've been trying to get my hands on a JE Gauss for a while now. I was lucky enough to get a JFFR drop but I don't think that's very useful because I've been told the Gauss isn't very effective if you don't charge the shots. So, I have another question... 
---
I've been told the damage shown in the pip-boy for the Gauss is only for charged shots, is that true? How much damage do uncharged shots do?
---
The prime event in ash heap is guaranteed sheepsquach. Got quite a few there.
---
We don’t have anti gravity technology in Fallout. Do we?
---
What's the weaponm
---
Sorry emote is the also one of the most needed one
---
Bethesda could have done a referential twofer and had it be three radrats wearing radrat-sized bottlecap sunglasses.
---
It's an M79 Gernade Launcher that's basically Instigating with +50% limb damage
---
Nope not angry. Efficient.
---
That's true, it's showing damage for charged shots only. And bad news about your FFR gauss: A friend and I tested one, and because they take the same exact amount of time to charge, FFR or no FFR, you can't fire charged shots any faster. Just normal, un-charged shots. So FFR is essentially useless on a Gauss.
---
i thought of that song as well. i made a playlist for songs i think could or should be in the next fallout games. here is the link: [https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLpC-i6WyjONFoUelayqX-xwu7qCPfoAAk](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLpC-i6WyjONFoUelayqX-xwu7qCPfoAAk)
---
I was on the steel drum for the duration of the cook out after I dropped off some prime meat at the spitter and some idiot got angry and decided to keep shooting me with their explosive weapon because they thought I wasn’t contributing....
---
Military service is not the only way to gain the right to vote, there were also labor battalions for those that had no aptitude for military service, and for those that couldn't swing a pick you could be the guy that tests experimental equipment.  The only way you could be denied the chance to earn your right to vote was by being mentally incompetent, any other impairment would be assigned a job.  The point was to make you cherish your right to vote, to make you use the political power you've earned wisely.  Heinlein's greatest criticism of democracy was it would inevitably sink into decadence and then decline.  As a buddy of mine puts it, you gotta have skin in the game.
---
I do agree that he was probably pro-military since he was a serviceman before being discharged because of tuberculosis, and served in a civilian capacity during WWII.
---
The diplomatic corp managed to swing the skinnies to our side from the arachnids.  We smashed a city, but that may be a tit for tat since they gave the arachnids the location of Terra that let them grease BA.
---
Yeah the public event thing fucked it up. Now it's free BUT only has a 1 in 15 chance of spawning every 45 minutes. Either they make the drop rate way lower or lower the time between events.
---
Good news is they're doing just that. It'll spawn more often and more frequently coming next month.
---
Or, you realize Graham is cool, then encounter your next super mutant...... hey there bud- OW!
---
Lol
---
Alpha and Omega
---
TIL a new abbreviation for when I cba to spell out “can’t be arsed”.
---
I burned through a lot of ammo doing a bunch of meat runs.  I ended up gathering greens, wood, picking up crap, and beating drums a lot.  Every little bit helps!
---
Yep. That's how real life works. You're now invisible! Hooray!...So are the things you're carrying. Have fun aiming with invisible sights!
---
Yeah they are idiots, dont put prime meat in til the end, but drum my friend drum til ur hearts content...lol
---
This would help, because I've been trying to give low levels stimpacks, food, water, and radaway but they get scared since I'm a high level.
---
What I don't get is that 'One Violent Night' gets so many questmarkers but the 'Cook Out' doesn't get any?
---
I want speedruns from other Fallout games. I know it Is not possible.
---
It does ur right, it helps to have enough players there so u dont have to try and do everything...thanks for the comment
---
Wow you're an infinite source of Fallout knowledge. If you don't mind I have an infinite amount of Fallout questions.
---
First of all, my vault suit didn't offer enough protection from the unfriendly world that you are about to explore. You've been warned...
---
Secondly, you'll find many more strange things than a super-mutant...  I won't spoil the surprise, but most of them are deadly...   You've been warned...

Finally, not all of your fellow vault members are the friendly bunch that they seem to be at the cookout.  What you are seeing, a lot of team work, is an anomaly.  Just try accidentally shooting one.   Having a pacifist outlook with your fellow vault members is the best way to start out...   You've been warned...
---
Oh, and here are some extra stimpacks....   enjoy...   (grin)
---
Omg 1000x no
---
I want some competition left, puzzles, frustration, achievements! This could even show you 'hidden places' that you wouldn't find without closer investigation of the places.
---
Sooo many hoarders in this thread.....
---
Real life. Ok.
---
Maybe if Bethesda fixed the god damn blueprint system and made the workshop less strict about placements, people probably wouldn't have to use just stairs
---
I'd have to do this to make sure I could move my camp or blueprint it without having to rebuild it.
---
They usually have good aesthetic. Lets not complain this one off of the shelf, just a reminder to people with floating camps: you can def put 3 or 4 posts together and have at least one support column, as for bethesda, capitalize on this shit and design us some 200 atoms or less ‘base holders’ that can snap to the underside of upper floor tiles. Giant stone pillars and shit!
---
I have yet to do one violent night, right now going to work on mayor for a day want the all rise...
---
I stopped using it for exactly that reason a bloodied buikd it super powerful but.. sneakey, sneakey, aim / guess, fire.... miss &amp; dead
---
Always one Legendary Supermutant in Huntersville. Lots of cover for sneaky commando types.
---
I got harassed for having a rectangle house going into the sky with one part of the house jutting out. Thing is, I was on the top of the mountains so I couldn’t build how I wanted. Imo, people get too upset about houses not being “normal”, but maybe that’s just me
---
I had the same thing happen when I was the only person turning the spit. There were 10 people running around killing critters already so I hopped on the spit.
---
Oh prime meat after? That makes sense, thanks got it!
---
You do. It just doesn't show a pop up anymore. Have to check before and after to see
---
Drop one item, then pick it up. It will be fixed then.
---
Same thing happened, people were just killing critters lol
---
Right.  In melee, it seems to happen the most when you're chasing something while trying to attack it.  It's like, from the server's perspective, you are actually farther apart than you are on your screen, so it registers your swing as a miss instead of a hit.  The same thing tends to happen in reverse.  If you start backing up when Ghouls come flailing at you, they have a surprising tendency not to hit, even though it looks like they should.
---
For all I know, maybe the shotgun problem is similar to this.  We know that the falloff on shotgun damage is quite extreme.  The difference between a one-hit kill and a hit where you see nothing but 1s is quite small.  Coupled with the spread effect of shotgun pellets creating more points of potential inaccuracy.
---
No
---
Been playing a while, but I by no means know it all. I don't mind sharing what I DO, though.
---
Heinlein was definitely pro-military, that's why he doesn't get remembered as the originator of cyberpunk with novels like The Moon Is a Harsh Mistress and I Will Fear No Evil because of the anti-military ethos frequently found alongside anti-corporatism in cyberpunk science fiction.
---
Oddly enough, however, Stranger in a Strange Land was a huge influence on free love and the hippie movement. He wasn't an easily pigeonholed writer by any means.
---
A new collectable: vaul tec special videos along with a sorta display of the game holotapes
---
Oh no not after sorry if I said that my bad....do the drums and before the end put ur prime meat in, will kick the bar up a lot from what I'm told, sorry not after my apologies
---
this is correct, however, if you move the camp without blueprinting, it will allow you to replace the structure that was in existence.. but if its built into anything, like on a bidge or around a pylon, you will have a difficult6 if not impossible time putting it back..
---
I’m pretty proud of mine if anyone wants to check it out. Nothing fancy but i like it, at a least not a box or floating. Constantly changing it too. 
---
Not on now but will be later. Pc.

ign is mariekenna
---
I usually play really late at night, so there just wasn't that many people on the server I was on. But, I went to several of these, and the events were failed - even when there were enough people there to win it. The event I mentioned in this post in the Ash Heap, the group didn't manage to kill the sheepsquatch, plus...after the event, on the way up to Welch Station, there was a Primal Cricket from the event hanging around the station, far away from the event.  I imagine that cricket was another part of why the event failed, since no one could find it to kill it.

I spent probably 20 hours building and rebuilding my camp on top of Seneca Rocks to get the spawns in good spots. Huge bitch to align the spawns and also get things oriented just right to clip through the ground in the right places, but it was worth it.
---
Well you are encouraging this train of hate with the replies. This is what I find is weird.
---
I wasn't thinking of new types of stash specific cards though that would be fine too. 
---
I switch out cards regularly so the idea of the game having to recalculate weights whenever I change things out would be a bad proposition. That's why I figured I could just use some of my existing perk cards with the stash itself. Then the weights are only calculated/recalculated for stash card changes, not toon card changes.
---
Grinding all the mire events/dailies is the way to go, but it is only a 0,02% chance unless there is a perk that increases the chance of getting rare drops/rewards
---
This is why I started a new character for NW
---
You’d die if you did.
---
When we did it on novice they never fully stopped. They slowed down a bit, but they still kept coming every so often. You have to thin the wave down, and just push to each objective. It designed so that 2 people can work on objectives and 2 people can do crowd control.
---
This is like terminator. I approve
---
My camp is actually floating with no supports
---
How much for the serum? What's ur psn?
---
No one is going to buy it from you for more than they would pay at a robot. So it would depend on perks and charisma for each person.
---
Thanks for all of the down votes for my simple question.  This community is the worst.
---
I was very careful with switching my Perks and made sure starched genes was on when using the arch
---
As others have said. You still get scrip. I got about 200 yesterday. It was sweet.
---
OMG that is great, should have looked myself, anything to help is great. Thank you I hope players read this
---
Well you asked a question got a the correct response but you didn't accept it.
---
Ya but not hoarding for the sake of hoarding. He'd chat up people and ask questions about survival weapons. Seeing if players wanted to sell them cause obviously he's not going in. Pretty cool.
---
I didnt know that... luckily it was pre owned, so didnt exactly break the bank.
---
And his xbox is reading discs again, so I'm in a much better mood ha
---
Are you using Starched Genes 2, or just 1?
---
And did you use a Rad-X?
---
Sounds like you want to play the sims
---
You can be close enough to be practical and far enough to avoid the event. If you are too close, you will make some people angry and Yao guai Will destroy your camp going after frightened low level players who look shelter.
---
I found you can build outside the boundary a bit using blueprints. Blueprint the floor and anything that's going to be in the red, then place the blueprint as far out as you can. It works to get wiring and things like setup in the red.
---
They already said we will get no companion that will follow us around.
---
He barely sounds better, even then, compared to Three Dog and Mr New Vegas. I kill him asap in every playthrough
---
I also hate when people make massive camps and can’t decorate because they ran out of budget. What’s all the empty rooms for?
---
Endless, which is why xp is low
---
Flux is a bitch. I just collect them to stay hydrated.
---
Also, the standard stock for the handmade is literally just a shovel handle
---
Demolition isn’t worth it these days for an explosive gun.  It’s better to get more useful damage perks.
---
Yeah. Crushes the immersion and takes me out of the game. They're hardly ever clever too so it's not really a thing where I can say "oh cool their camp floats but its x and y." 
---
Nah. Just always hideous to look at. And I get why they do it, I still hate it.
---
Another day older and deeper in debt..
---
Lol at getting mad because raids are hard. They are not designed to do solo.
---
With 25K he can have any of my weapons; I could buy another better one twice. My favourites and most powerful are 1 or 2 star Bloodied Heavy Weapons. They do much more damage than these explosive shotguns I see others using
---
This doesn't seem to be mentioned often here but.. some people also just want to get as high up as possible for the view. I've made one such camp before because it's just way cheaper and I don't have to worry about other types of materials. Little wood and steal and you can go nice and high.
---
Like someone else did mention, not everyone else is hugely into the camp building and just want a simple home base. Adding to that, not everyone builds their camp for others. And IMO it mattered a lot less before the player camp vendor was added.
---
I understand your dislike for these camps. The physics defying stuff seems a bit silly. For me, I want to build a proper camp sometime but I'm still figuring other stuff (like carry weight issues) and I'm hesitant to start building something I can't finish with what I have in materials at the moment.
---
But small mansions may be in my future. Soon enough though, I'm planning on building a tower camp (not the open, naked, unsupported looking type) and having a visitor center at the bottom of it.
---
Yes! I've done some stupid shit especially in early game. No way to say "Whoops, I fucked up."
---
Starched 2. I may have had a rad x on by mistake. Could that be why?
---
&gt;\[Director Paul\] Verhoeven had never read the book, and attempted to read it for the  film, but it made him "bored and depressed", so he read only a few  chapters and instead decided to do his own thing:   
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;*"I stopped after two chapters because it was so boring … It is really quite a bad book."* 
---
I agree with the film maker here. Since the movie ended up being way more popular than the book, this is one of the many cases where the director knows better than the author, e.g. The Shining, Forrest Gump [https://screenrant.com/movie-adaptations-completely-different-from-books-big-changes/](https://screenrant.com/movie-adaptations-completely-different-from-books-big-changes/)
---
Rad-X will suppress mutations for 30 minutes I believe.
---
Lol. No thanks. But I do enjoy spending time at my camp. Might be nice to have a reason to spend a bit more time there. I was thinking more like how you could have a family in skyrim, but with the addition of related random quests. 
---
But now that you mention the sims, im pretty sure Murmrgh the purveyor speaks the same language as they do! She would make a pretty good wife, maybe offer a discount on legendaries!
---
Fuck thanks for telling me as i was getting ready to use one on 2 lvl 25's assholes who poped down a small structure with turrets everywere in the forest on top of prime cutts and are useing the turrets to take all down on xbox one
---
PC is filled with floating boxes. I love spending time on my CAMP to make a decent quality one. Check out my post history if you wana see some I've made.
---
LMG is probably the most powerful (non-legacy) gun in the game.  Any version of it is awesome.
---
She’s a babe
---
nah its more good than bad on the replies in general
---

Here's a chill pill, buddy.
---
the big pve updates were Biv (check out frat row next to VTU), sheepsquatch (van lowe taxidermy in lewisburg), and possum scouts quests (camp lewis)  all these u can read the posters for at any train station and will also start u off on ur quests
---
the quests are pretty self-explanatory, but i use wickady chickady (sp?) for possum guides.  other than that, there are a ton of qol fixes (eg telling u how many mods u have unlocked in weapons/armor benches) and some locations have been updated (charleston statehouse, the burrows)
---
ITT: Fallout 76: Sims Expansion
---
Haha.
---
That’s the small backpack. Read the pioneer scout poster in a train station to get started
---
Doesn’t seem to work unfortunately, I still freeze constantly while using my BEGP on the queen with strangler on. Do you know if I could modify something else to fix this issue?
---
There are literal map markers for other players to find your camp.
---
Just said “I heard it sucked” wasn’t my opinion, this is more of an observation . I’ve played every day since that event started and more recently I’ve never seen anyone on the map around that spot. If it really was that fun wouldn’t you see more people on the map around that area. Yeah... absolutely zero people on any map I’ve played have been around that area.
---
Yeah that's my problem, I'm shoehorned into a narrow canyon and butted right up against several bits of the terrain.  Sounds like I'm out of luck.
---
I'll experiment with things on a lowbie alt, but if nothing else works, I'll strip the camp down as much as possible before I try to move things.  I can eliminate a lot of the intersections without spoiling the overall build too much.
---
Didn’t read the whole post did you?  He asked for any random advice too
---
You don’t need a video
---
Wait a bit. Someone told me that and the 2 times I waited since it eventually pops up places to spawn. (Both times were deaths after queen)
---
You should see the Minuteman fortress Outpost I'm building out of black marble on Fallout 4
---
cool, ty
---
You leave the map when you enter the vault
---
Didn’t do that when it first started. I used to see all kinds of activity up there.
---
I see you found it :p
---
Go to the trading sub. I would link it but comments with the trading sub get silently removed.
---
LMFAO, thanks for that
---
kajit has wares
---
I do it because if someone is in my space when I join friends or I decide to move it, I won't have to rebuild the whole thing since the game gives me problems when moving a fully built base.
---
If they removed serendipity bloodied builds would be like they intended. A glass cannon. Max serendipity give you a 45% chance to avoid all damage. So that perk alone is what makes them a pain in the ass.(pvp anyways)
---
Oh fo76 marketplace? It's getting locked
---
Probably people meeting up to start. I encourage you to try it if you want a challenge. It’s a lot of fun in my opinion. Keeps you on your toes. Better than a lot of stuff where you just clear a room and move on. Also if you die, you lose and have to start the whole thing over.
---
I prefer form over function, but I understand some people don't. In fact, I use pre-existent structures because red brick mansions also look weird in the middle of the wasteland.
---
It's amusing that you're saying the movie was more popular than the book on a subreddit for a game which features powered armor as a signature aspect. Starship Troopers the novel was one of the most enduring and influential sci-fi novels of all time and has even found its way into academic discussions about the role of the military in society.
---
Power Armor is 10lbs instead of 1,000lbs, so it goes both ways.
---
Oh the fo76 marketplace? It's getting locked
---
Lol they changed that months ago
---
Also, Monday is last day to do survival.
---
I’ve visited the spot many times but I’m always solo. Again, I've never seen anyone up there.
---
Players don’t show up on maps in survival
---
I think an arcade machine that can charge players a cap to play some of the game... be neat to build an arcade
---
“at least until bethesda makes the necessary changes”. well thats a whole lot of assumption, just because you want something to happen does not make it necessary
---
The respawn bug has been addressed numerous times, every other patch they end up breaking it again. It's been there since the early days.
---
They look horrible but the early camp problems really drove them - (ITS GREEN WHY CANT I PLACE IT) - so yes I do build them as habit. But I think they look awful, it’s soul destroying putting something nice together and not being able to place it again
---
are you following the format? the good one has a specific format you need to use
---
Your comment is one of the strangest. 
---
Also one of the least constructive - Very odd that you mention “boners” too.
---
Ok? Well find people somewhere else and head over there to try out the raids. What level are you?
---
I have what u call a floating base but i have steel beams at all the points atleast so will be semi realistic
---
I would try out the raid with you. What level are you?
---
You need to post a post Like \[PC\] H:\_\_\_\_\_ W:\_\_\_\_\_\_
---
No I mean the whole subreddit
---
thats not the good trading sub if your going to bazaar.  most people use the mark. et. 76
---
I have every speed buff available so you stick to the drums and let me fetch the meat n veggies and we all win
---
You should submit a bug report to Beth if you haven't
---
What’s sad is no new rewards, and we’ve all killed like 670k scorchbeasts... good job Bethesda.
---
Exactly I don’t think that “floating” bases are inherently bad its just that many people are bad at designing bases. You can make a floating base look good if you try a little bit.
---
My favorite thing is to have one attached to another structure like a rail car post.
---
Should be, check camden parks vendor. [https://fallout76.wiki.fextralife.com/Excavator+Power+Armor](https://fallout76.wiki.fextralife.com/Excavator+Power+Armor)
---
Can you still destroy other peoples bases in this game?
---
Oh no I got what you meant after I thought about it, no worries! Lol
---
Which is why this is getting so damn ridiculous.
---
I got all 3 types the 21mil the 3mil and i craft the 1mil
---
Someone needs to play the drums and turn the meat. 
---
The thumbs down I have are the players setting up their camps right on top of the prime events.  You best believe I will PvP you and destroy your camp if you are turret farming the critters and not allowing others to participate.
---
I asked if there was anything to back up that statements. Just a random ‘nope’ is not a very thorough answer.  “How do you know you can’t?  Are you guessing or is there a source for your answer” being down voted just shows that this group is full is a bunch of petty childish dicks.
---
I don't think there is, that list also has the jet pack listed but excavator jetpacks don't exist yet. Maybe in the future! I just need it to chug Nukas
---
I can jump off the top of seneka rock and get NO damage, not reduced as I can see no damage come off the bar 
---
I don't have bird bones Or goat legs, i have no armor fall dmg reducing effects other than two 50% fall dmg reduction pieces.
---
So how am I taking no damage then if it isn't those two pieces I have?
---
We aren't going to get new music, so I'm being realistic. Not unless they introduce original "songs" like in the Nuka World DLC for F4. I'd rather they didn't, those were fucking awful.
---
That is one of the patch 11 bugs that enemies dont take damage when struck all us meelee been suffering from it too.
---
Hi being realistic. not unless they introduce original "songs" like in the nuka world dlc for f4. i'd rather they didn't, those were fucking awful., I'm dad.
---
If there are level 62 enemies, you should probably be level 50+ with good gear.
---
Should do bonus explosive damage!
---
Reporting him or her is a waste of time 
---
It’s much easier to initiate PvP and destroy their camp.  If I see this (like people used to do at Whitesprings golf club) I will do everything in my power to kill the player and level their camp. 
---
The events are for everyone not just your selfish ass
---
I agree with that, but I'm getting easy script in between grinding out other script
---
Actually i call my guy friends and  colleagues girl all the time and not even a eye isbatted.
---
So yes. 100% yes it is a man is a neutral tterm for for Human. Especially in gaming. In raids its called 10 man or 40 man raid for 10 humans vs ai and 40 humans vs ai
---
 . Really kinda shocked u dont know this
---
I think the issue would be that it would annoy high levels when lower / newbies advertised things they considered menial. Newbies would be frustrated by high prices for things they want but couldn’t afford of use...
---
I like the idea but i’m not sure if it would work..
---
Exactly. I've got a grounded "variety store", but sometimes it's really hard to place without starting over if I relocate. I did the stairs method when I moved around more frequently.
---
And crying
---
The solution is easy.  Just PvP and wreck their camp.
---
You can have both effects active if you have one as a mutation and one as an active serum, possibly both of they are both serum. If they stacked then it is conceivable that you may get a slightly diminished version of both.  Sort of like meat gives you 2x bonus instead of 3x
---
The game has been out for 9 months, both mutations contradicts each other so obviously you can't have both
---
why do i care whether or not i get support from the coumminity?
---
I’m with u there...
---
Soo..
---
You did the phase thing, and C-State, and also only allowed fallout to use core 0-7 ? 
---
If so, it would be very strange that it didn't work, i could not use the strangler, a Laser with beta wave / beam spliter by them self at all for more than a few seconds, no i can use them all together without any hiccups :/
---
You def can peeps have been on xbox one. And just a few min ago i was cussing at some lvl 25's who have there 1/2 homes next to prime cutts that have turrets everywere and are useing them to take down the enemies in the forest like wtf
---
At least let excavator highlight ore
---
I like floating houses, i don't have any limitations besides the sky box. The ground sucks when it comes to building a c.a.m.p.
---
YES
---
I'm going to take a wild guess and say that weapon you can't sell has a skin on it from the atom store? If that's the case you can modify it in the weapon at the weapons bench, remove the skin, and it should be tradable / sellable.
---
Oh just like the good old days when some tool would set up their turret camp behind WS golf club.   I made good use of grenades and orbital strikes and my TSE shotgun.
---
That would be awesome as fuck
---
Yeah, but you need to repair the original to be able to craft them. Which I never got to do because I scrapped all when I got it off the tourist.....which is how you get pretty much every other plan in the game.
---
Sometimes when I go to her il keep getting the same perk on every piece that she gives me too
---
Railway and harpoon can shoot or at least travel thru water.
---
If your item has atom shop skin cant sell it.
---
my camp as by the fishing dock at the pond behind to help everyone craft and scrap.  I don't get insta evented that far back
---
I’ve got a Forest Asylum Dress and matching hat for sale/trade on the PC.
---
Mine is kind of like this. I made it when the CAMP builds were much smaller and never changed it. That said, I think I made it in a way that seems believable. I didn't build outward too much up top. 
---
What I dislike are the CAMPs that are largely barren on the inside. Get some decorations and rugs in there, folks!
---
Yeah, I make the whites prints run constantly as there's a couple toolboxes and that's where everyone says they find em.
---
Absolutely. Every time I come across them, I die a teensy bit inside.
---
It's even worse when they've locked their crafting benches inside.
---
oh yeah no turrents
---
The game has been out for 9 months and it’s full of bugs and the effects of many things are poorly documented, don’t work as described, or have weird stacking effects.  Guessing that you can’t have two things because they would seem to contradict each other isn’t an answer.  I wasn’t asking anybody to make a reasonable determination if they thought you could have both.  I was sharing my experience of trying to get both to see if anybody else has a different experience than me.
---
330ish on my main and 115 on my other.
---
I think it has to be the Forest Asylum Outfit.  The camo jumpsuit isn’t a dress.
---
Honestly, blame the design of the CAMP system for most of this. Especially early in the game your camp is going to be mobile, but it's ridiculously hard to place even a 2x2 building down in any place other than where it was originally designed. The system is way to picky in restrictions on blueprinted structures in where they can be placed. Even in places where you could build one piece at a time, it won't let you replace the same building there as a whole.
---
This in the end is what gives rise to those floating structures. 1x1 or 2x1 foundations are a lot easier to place, but harder to fit everything in. So until you are settled in one place as a permanent home, a structure with a small footprint works best.
---
"Oh my immersion is hurting.  Stop hurting my immersion."
---
The fact is, walls cost budget.  Foundation costs budget.  People who maximize the utility of their camps while not giving two collective shits about the realism definitely have a focus on what is more important in a wasteland where the use of limited resources (budget is a limited resource) matter.   If we had unlimited budget within a confined space, then making things that look better would take a much higher ranking of importance in my book.  
---
You know what is breaking immersion for me?  Walking around with a .50 cal gun that can't rip something in half from as far away as I can see it.  If I can see it, it ought to be torn in half with a well placed shot from a .50 cal.  The ranges of the guns are immersion breaking.  The damage levels of the various guns are immersion breaking.  The whole weapons system needs a complete gut and overhaul instead of micronerfs here, macronerfs there...and here's a nerf and there's a nerf....everyone gets nerfs!   Screw that.
---
I know that I’m talking about Adventure mode. They’ll be right next to me and when I go to the map, nothing, come out and their still moving around.
---
It’s not a matter of being funny or not funny.  It’s selfish gameplay but what comes around goes around.  If I see that shit you bet I’ll be gunning and will destroy the camp.  Quite honestly that might be more fun than the events.  Better bring your popcorn
---
The donation jar would have to put caps into your “pocket” immediately or a logoff without realising someone had done that might be problematic.
---
Also the cap limit should be able to be exceeded in this case otherwise it would be a waste.
---
I know the cynic in me thinks that would get abused for trading purposes...
---
I don't, sorry I sold it awhile back and I'm on xbox
---
Did try it yourself.
---
Tried twice and got disconnected when entering.
---
Should have been Nazeem. Then no one would have been offended.
---
I hate it so much!
---
If the foundations stick out jus a little when making mine, i redo it 
---
Usually now when I build and the ground is slanted, i work at the slant first instead of at the top
---
That would explain that, but that’s a minor gripe compared to the others!
---
strip the flesh, salt the wound.
---
Ill trade you a tenderizer for a salty plan?
---
Yeah. So you realize you're comparing a delay in one feature....... To the delay of a major DLC.... Which has significantly more impact on attracting new player and player retention?
---
Not assuming Wastelanders is priority number 1, a year in, is a bit absurd.
---
Good for you, and I'll continue to play how I fucking want, thanks bye
---
I only know this cuz I had the same thing happen to me. Thought I was going crazy LOL
---
Better yet:  Let me push a button that draws enemies to my camp.  They wouldn't necessarily be the highest levels ... but just some "mid level" weapon fodder.  That would be pretty cool to optionally summon an attack on my camp if I wanted to do some playing around.
---
You forgot: fast travel to an event (or a random location) and have a level 76 Yao Guai (or other high level enemy) kill you (I'm level 47) before you can do anything or before it even renders.
---
Nuke their camp if it bothers you that much. Just server hop. Some people just want to grief....
---
I'm not, because I won't buy it. Now if they actually give us items you can earn in game, I'll be happy for that.
---
Doesn’t bother me one bit.  But remember, what goes up usually comes down.  Meaning, if your camping on top of an event don’t be surprised if I PvP and remove your camp from the premises.
---
Aw that is a fuckin' *beaut* camp.
---
Found out what is is, it's a Atom shop Suit, you get it with a short and long legs bundel, but not in the shop anymore, look at 1.00 min mark in this video:
---
 [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QoyCZCDF5L4&amp;feature=youtu.be](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QoyCZCDF5L4&amp;feature=youtu.be)
---
if its floating its ugly, aint nobody gawking, just repulsed
---
Did you read any of the thread?
---
You are correct. For some reason I was thinking it came from BOS on the west coast not DC area.
---
No, a raider would instigate PvP with those camp builders and destroy them. 
---
Guess that makes me a raider?
---
That was a really long winded way of letting us know you are a massive twat.
---
yes but once you seen its too late, leaving wont change it
---
&gt;Slap up a wall when you dont want to sell.
---
Also put them all behind an electrical switch, so your camp doesn't show up on the map as having active vendors.
---
Well I think that they are made to relocate them. But it's not immersive at all.
---
I wouldn’t say so considering the amount of upvotes I’ve had getting it from -5 or whatever it was at, I don’t really care. There’s bigger issues than fucking floating camp buildings
---
But it doesnt show that gap on the normal t60...
---
Im not getting food for my family! Only the strong survive in Appalachia!
---
Yes plz
---
Happened to me loads of times. Only seems to be when I’m buying plans.
---
Yeah seems the only logical way. the mechanics seem to give you cards based on the lowest stat u have. my high perception character took 50 levels to get all the rifle sniper cards. this 1 perception melee toon, gets nothing but perception cards from lvl 3-12
---
the scales are 550+ in favour of the good guys on this thread, and thats a constant theme everyday...  but I can agree there are bigger issues
---
I really want to make a chameleon build.. its most likely my next build as I have done Most the other good ones.. these few problems are the only thing putting me off using the build! These would be great QOL improvements not just for the armour.. but for the mutation itself!
---
But it was about me. So much as other new players
---
Do you get anything else beside the hook, beer and food? I've done the event a couple of times.
---
It's basically an archive/compilation for persons to refer to with regards Fallout 76 news.
---
I think they're pretty cool until I try to place a fully logical, grounded set of stairs at my own camp and still get "object is floating".  
---
.. but I still enter my PA before I shop at one so I can't be dropped to my death.  😁
---
I've never gotten a hook or beer?
---
Does pacifist also keep you from collecting bounties? Because if so, mine is busted. (Something busted in a Bethesda game? Shocker!) I have always had it enabled, some guy was wandering around the map for a while with a five cap bounty, and I offered to take it off of him, since he was definitely alone, and at a much lower level than me, so he couldn't throw it back in my face. Got the bounty and I think I also got two achievements for it. Stood guard while he came back for his bag.
---
Suppress from getting them but recover from them???? I dunno I think it was a bug.
---
I also wonder if OP looted a hard hat prior to posting this. Still, why tho?
---
then I’m probably not outnumbered am I? And at least you can agree on something
---
Bitching about what someone’s camp they spent time building looks like is childish and deserving of someone to be called 12. Does it affect you how they build it? Seriously grow up.
---
not sure how being out-scaled by 550 isn’t being outnumbered lol
---
Oh yeah, that’s a common one: fast travel somewhere and the game decides that your character is already ‘there’ even before you can fully load in.
---
When I spawn at my camp underwater after fast traveling to it, about half the time I spawn with parasites (when I previously didn’t have any) because the game loaded mu character underwater before I could even move
---
Oh yeah I remember those thanks
---
then why haven’t all 550 downvoted my comment too then if they don’t agree with it
---
do you even read what people write? they are upset because when camps defy the laws of physics and look ugly and immersion breaking. if your gonna try and win an argument by calling people 12yo your in the wrong place dude
---
It once gave me a hook, beer and food. The second time y played it it gave me some of those... meat knifes, beer and food, and once even the hook recipe.
---
I remember now thanks
---
It has been giving me that error too but if you just go to the dashboard, hover over fallout 76, hit the start button on your controller (3 lines next to the x button), and then go down to quit it should be fine the next time you start the game up.
---
I know there’s a few haters on here but I’d say the majority of people really love the game. So not sure why you’d want to post it here. It’s like pointing out to someone all their flaws and faults. No one wants to hear, that we know.
---
Fallout 76 is not the journey to an epic house for *everyone*. That may be your personal journey, and that's cool! Truly. However, building an epic house is not "all" that the game is here for. There are many, many players, with many, many opinions on what to do in the end game. Players also enjoy trading, open-world PvP, Nuclear Winter, PvE Content like Vault 94 and SBQ/Nukes, collecting gear, exploration, build tweaking and sure, C.A.M.P. building, too. Not everyone enjoys all the offerings for whatever reasons: bugs, PvP anxiety, preference for solitude, etc. It's just that each C.A.M.P. is *one* cool aspect of the game, not the *only* aspect. The "first item from purchased items don't count" isn't a bad suggestion at all, but the "this is the only thing that matters to everyone" argument needs some work.
---
I can help out. Psn is Rellik-066
---
most probably haven’t read this far into the thread for starters lol, out of everyone who read the main thread, the upvotes show the majority dislike the physics defying floating camps
---
I'm saving my atoms until I reach 10k, then I might buy something
---
Decent for VATS builds, but even the Mutant's legendary effect deals more damage than AA. AA is overrated.
---
Combat Shotgun level 40: Base Damage 80. Double Barrel level 45: Base Damage 115. Explosive damage scales off of base damage. So, your experience is to be expected.
---
Sentinel is 5 pieces of trades or luck to make a super good defence. I'm just pointing out that serendipity is broken and takes away from intended game play of a bloodied build.
---
Update:
---
We couldn't find MSI's equalent to phase control, but found the C-state and changed that, installed process lasso, set it to core 0-7, he can now do all enemies in west tek and even burnt the building down with his BE laster rifle (beta wave and beam splitter mod) without any hiccup, this was not possible before the fix...
---
I can see it now.. Bethesda's Atomic Shop exclusive Television Pack for the low price of 1800 atoms. Hurry and get it now, available for 6 more days only...
---
God yes rhey have it on clifs and log out as soon as i get there and fall to my death.
---
You know this subreddit has gone off the deep end when you're looking forward to new overpriced bundles to buy instead of being looking forward to **ACTUAL CONTENT WITH REWARDS THROUGH GAMEPLAY**.
---
I do not use it because it Is overpowered. Really strong.
---
Mule characters are life savers.
---
Don't like the part about it being a atx item
---
Exactly the main reason I imagine people do it.
---
Hmmm it simply told me I recovered..
---
I don't know; if someone's a twat I like them to be really upfront about it
---
Well if it gave you that message, then it’s likely gone.  Find a serum for 300-ish, and try again. 🤷‍♂️
---
I believe I bought one from one of the vendors in the Whitespring.
---
I have mine flechette as well. I am looking forward to the chance to one shot something big!
---
The only one I run is Lifegiver
---
Nope I didnt play for a long time. Logged on and got a quest. As I was dicking around my camp it just popped up all the completions
---
I bought one from enclave
---
All the time, I usually had mine white. Especially in FO4 where it changed the color of the flashlight.
---
Anyone on ps4 has the game crashing every time you try to load the menu? I have the game installed on a new external hard drive and it's not working. So I'm trying to figure out if it's an isolated issue or not.
---
I think it has something to do with the hidden presidential quest that awards the presidential gauss rifle.
---
Kinda what I was thinking
---
I've heard that she is linked to the server. So hopping servers can switch up what you get.
---
Yeah, I just got excited because it’s the first legendary fixer I’ve gotten, and I got the plans like a week ago, and been grinding for scrip each day
---
That makes a lot of sense too.
---
The bundle is actually cheaper and the singles are for people who already own one of the plushies.
---
Aqua boy/girl and rank 2 in sun kissed.
---
Most of the time I'm out of my power so I've got both of them and there n ice to have.
---
Violin I found in the shops at whitespring near the golf course. Might have been the Christmas tree one. 
---
I tried but it kept moving to the ends somehow. It's a bummer.
---
Fireproof give immunity to scorchbeasts. And I like radicol for carry weight. I run bloodied heavy though
---
I try to keep mine physics based. I once got told by someone they thought my home was a building in the game, probably the best compliment I could ask for.
---
Fireproof and Radicool are what I run on my bloodied build using exploding weapons.
---
Hell yes.  Upvote
---
Wow, pretty impressive how you've managed to build all that with the limited build space. The wooden foundation bridge is pretty clever.
---
The system that requires you to coordinate place/time on a third party software that then forces you to trust the other person will not steal your item because you can only trade for caps? 
---
That system? 
---
Server full btw.
---
I know. I was talking about how they sold all of them individually over the last few weeks on sale and now they have them all on sale and in a bundle all together at once. So people who bought them on sale one at a time pretty much got screwed for no reason since they have them all on sale as singles and a bundle at once. Its not a big deal but it is in fact shady.
---
Happened to me after patch 11 while trying to buy plans from gram
---
U literally stated the obvious.
---
My camp happened to be in a spot that's right next to a Primal Cuts location too, I would like to think it's probably not that annoying. It's a small camp with only one heavy laser turret (set back a ways so it only shoots things that get right up on the camp), plus once all the fighting is over it provides a convenient location to scrap things and cook food. Plus there's an elevated platform that's handy for people to get a good shot at the Prime beasts when they show up.
---
I just say "anyone who dosent want tenderizer hook me up." Got 2 takers so far. Throw them in my vendor and collect.
---
I want the jukebox music from Biv’s playlists at the Nukashine - that stuff sounds amazing! I was so excited when I finally got the jukebox but so disappointed that I couldn’t change the music style
---
Awesome! Thanks I can work with that.
---
You wrote it in a confusing manor.
---
No can steal from you if you're trading for caps. 
---
In this case if you're worrued about it the sell the items. I'll buy plan for 3k and you buy the tenderizer for 3k.
---
Armor fall damage reduction and perk fall damage reduction do not stack together.
---
Interesting how everyone has their own way of solving problems.
---
What have you been trying to take pictures of? I had/have problems with a glowing Mirelurk King and glowing/scorched cave crickets. I reported it to Bethesda but I don't know if anything will come of it.
---
Once upon a time we only had 200 stash space so we're definitely in a bit of a better place these days, but it would be great to get more anyway.
---
My first 3* was a furious walking cane with reduced weight. It was a level 50 that dropped when I was level 16 somehow. I've still never used it by level 116 but I will literally never part with it. It'll be too perfect if I ever need to tell some kids to get off my lawn.
---
That's what I planned on doing before I realized that my quest to unlock Marine armor mods has left me completely out of plastic. The struggle is real.
---
I use them all the time. My camp is like a homestead with my main house, a workshop, and an outhouse. I hate the floating camps.
---
If you've got crimson flux I can craft it for you. No charge. I'm not sure if I'll be on today but I'll be on a good chunk of tomorrow
---
Thank you! Took a lot of building and replacing items to fit stuff within the budget.
---
Not a hint yet.
---
Are you on PS4? Now that sounds a great deal.
---
I've wondered this forever. I don't get some of their weird building rules.
---
PC
---
“sooner than you think”
---
I built a three story brick walled place with decontamination shower glitched onto the second floor built onto a cliff edge, with a farm and lead extractor on the property.  Whole place unlocked and open to anyone, except the bedroom, that’s mine.  Hell I leave the extractor unlocked.  You need lead scraps go ahead, i got tons.  Course I haven’t hopped on in ages, so yeah....
---
They are saying you can't mix perk fall damage reduction with the armor. Two pieces of armor will stack to 100% and completely remove damage from falls. 
---
You can't mix and match perks and legendary effects.  Even with 80% reduced fall from goat legs, and one piece of armor that has 50% reduced fall damage you would still have fall damage.
---
I kind of wish there was a "no build zone" for camps before Flatwoods. You get the game, you make it out of the vault, and there's Noobmaster6969420's camp with lights all over it.
---
I'm a fan of rejuvenated
---
Marsupial still works in PA - I haven’t bothered with jet packs since I mutated
---
I came across a camp by harpers ferry the other day that was floating, however there wasnt a staircase in sight. Instead, the entire camp which was hovering above the cliff at the end of the railway bridge, was a collection of floating platforms consisting of only conduit pieces and rugs. To get to the vendors, you had to leap frog across to each stepping stone, with a high risk of impending doom at every hop. Luckily I made it in one go, however whilst admiring the camp after browsing the vendors goods on offer, I watched in sadistic amusement as 2 other players attempted the death defying assault course and inevitably fell to their demise.
---
Eh to each their own
---
Foundations as good as I can get them is usually the longest single phase of a renovation (roughly once every 5 levels, or if something is released I can't function without).
---
Also why, since my probably permanent location has a bit of a slope, I spent so much time linking things up to effectively have a split level.
---
I want proper "connecting" stairs so badly sometimes - mind you, plenty of fixes and perhaps a boost to budget size first - but I hope they're on the list.
---
I'm happy with [my CAMP](https://i.imgur.com/JA8sYMq.jpg?1) as it seems to fit with the FO76 world. But I know by doing this, I will never be able to move it.
---
Dang
---
I don't have a problem making my own ammo, but when I do buy it, I don't mind that it's a cap each. Normally all I buy is shotgun shells. Or if I like a camp and they don't have anything I want/need I'll give'em a thousand caps for bullets.
---
You see, perks are accessible to everyone, but equipment has to be farmed, that's why I think it's actually fair to have perks outperform equipments. 
---
Serendipity broke nothing, because everyone can use it, when full health build people use it they might save quite a few more stims than bloodied builds do, even without the perk, stimpacks can do the job for bloodied build users pretty much most of the time. The problem is the game doesn't really offer distinct builds with different useful functions, so all playstyles are damage oriented and that makes bloodied build so good.
---
As for PvP, there is this damage cap thingy, which I believe is aimed at bloodied one shotters. With or with out serendipity, you can kill someone as long as you hit them with high fire rate weapons long enough.
---
&gt;Fireproof and Radicool
---
yup, same,  Fireproof and Radicool  :)
---
Or for the $1000's and $1000's of dollars people dump into this game you dont think they could add a few more rows of racks at one of the many data centers all over the country? Holy shit you can add more compute power? Noooo way!
---
I would love a mentat for corpses and meat/metal piles.
---
Decontamination shower in the doorway?  Not exactly a good idea.  I set mine on my second floor so people have to consciously use it.
---
Why’s that?
---
White springs, all the golf balls!
---
Also scrapper perk.
---
INTERESTING
---
next year... i think
---
I wont be on for another hour or 2 but i got it for 400 caps.
---
Second the salute
---
You get what you pay for just like every other aspect of life. You pay more you get more... that dont sound so weird to me. Hell it almost sounds like stealing if someone pays for something, but does not get to use it. Then again this games legendary gear game is gambling so it sounds in par anyway.
---
No more so than the OP.
---
Also Beth needs to either let people set the FT location or have your own location be the same as others. I had a house on a hill with a gap underneath that i closed off and i spawned outside but everyone else spawned underneath my house so i had to open it up and make pointing arrows
---
it is possible, there is a video of DitW expert solo, you just need to be very good at the puzzles and be able to have a decent strategy. killing things is not the correct strategy in any of the raids outside of very specific points.
---
What's your PSN? I'll be on in the next couple hours. My psn is anticlockclock
---
There’s one in my vending machine.  S of Monongah on a power transmission tower. 
---
Someone else has a camp there - mine is the one with the bronze lion aj-98 in game name.
---
Best I can say right now is I’ll be back on sometime before 3p EST.
---
Hmm....noted. Thank you
---
There's only 24 players per server. What's ur psn
---
It's only a few more days. I'd say don't repair it until the event is over?
---
A few examples include cat, albino deathclaw, and the rides at the water park. It's even for different missions so there's something that's not connecting between the camera and the missions. I'll try to report it, too. Hopefully they fix it.
---
I appreciate that you took the time to be helpful to visitors. Its a wonderful spot but if your fast travel is terrible then its horrid lol
---
I added you
---
thanks! =)
---
Bear arms FTW.  No such reducer for rifles.
---
Same issue.  Tried taking several of the needed pictures at Grahams BBQ.  
---
It recognized the critter, took the picture, but didn’t credit it in the world challenge list.
---
OTOH, all the others I’ve taken were in the wild, not at an event.  That might make a difference?
---
I didn't play much either, only got one or two of them, none of them are really all that good
---
Four walls, multi levels, a roof, eating/sleeping accommodation, place to work on stuff... man that does sounds a house.
---
I love exploring other players CAMPS, and I love having others come and see mine, building my CAMP and continuing to improve and tweak it here and there is something I really enjoy. I do agree that floating CAMPS are a little disappointing, and somewhat spoils the immersion, although I'm more of a "you do you" kinda gal.
---
Yeah. I mean. They help when you need to move cuz they can be place just about anywhere. But they look absolutely horrid. I love to build camps that add to the lore in a way and make the game immersive and fun. It's always a cool experience stumbling along a camp that just makes sense and looks dope. I built one that looked like a trailer in the ash heap beside of a mobile home that made it look like an actual place survivors would hole up like straight out of the walking dead or something. And one time I built a bunker out from one of the mountain sides and currently I'm living in a boat camp I built off the shore. Immersion breaking camps suck. Building ones that fit into place and look sick. Well. It just works.
---
it has a switch.  other than your criticism were there any other thoughts on the manor?
---
So quit your complaining.
---
It's not a collecting/hording game, you are making it one. You bitch about a non issue nobody but like 5% of players have.
---
Make your own issues and want people to solve them. Must be a millennial thing.
---
I got 4 different toons with there own stuff
---
I wish Bethesda would be more transparent regarding what the "ideal" stash size would be if there weren't the tech/server stability barriers.
---
Are they crouched?
---
But people running around with Sheepsquatch heads on them, that's what the Post-Apocalypse  is meant to be?
---
There's always going to be SOMETHING that breaks "immersion" for someone else in a multi-player game. Me, I'll just keep building my floating steel cage and just ignore the people running around wearing stuff that should only be in Fortnite.
---
The best way to play, I believe, Is to create completely dif. Characters and builds. My main Is 85, commando, but I have a 55 shotgunner, a 53 unarmed, a 77 2h melee gunslinger and a pure sniper rifleman, level 70. It keeps the game fresh and you can explore possibilities.
---
You're mentality with the three star legendary is ideal. Keep that going for sure
---
Get more fucking servers. There are data centers all over you can double the power for your stability, but they are not putting money in to their own infrastructure. Man would that be fucking cool?
---
It does tell you now, which mod is for which body part, at least on xbox. I just want to know if a Scout Chest Piece with a polymer mod will be better than my BOS Heavy Combat Chest. I know it'll be lighter, so potentially not, but my Scout Chest also has a decent perk already. Will it be worth it in caps?
---
Motion assist servos and (optimized and hydraulic) bracers are stated to add (at least) 2 Str points each.
---
It’s possible just EXTREMELY hard. It is designed for teams. This is a multiplayer spinoff. Team up with people if you think it’s too hard solo.
---
I do not move special points. I want all of those builds to be available anytime.
---
Invest in hacker perks, helps bypass a bunch of stuff
---
When i built my camp it is a 3 story camp but i literally took 3 hours to put posts in to look like it is supporting the building
---
1) You have no idea what my camp looks like
---
2) You clearly lack even basic argumentation skills and perhaps a bit joy and love in your life
---
3) You have been blocked and reported for offensive content
---
Have a nice day.
---
You do get to use it. You just have more camp options than someone who doesn’t buy from the shop. You shouldn’t get to build a higher house just because you spent more money on furniture.
---
Lol millennial? I'm 30, you madman...
---
And I guarantee lack of stash space is a huge issue for the majority of players.
---
And are you part of the market subreddit? Because if you were, you would know the game totally is a collecting game.
---
i dont lol, just pointing out how ignorant this community is.
---
Yes. 500 atoms please
---
I'm only advocating nuking that second group: people who intentionally block the drum.  Personally I don't care if there's a camp there so long as the drum is accessible ;)
---
You prob have a lot in your stored items
---
It's all over but they crying and nobodies crying but me
---
People are wanting the area a no build zone, no fucking camps at all and every time I suggest Bethesda could implement several alternative measures, I get fucking downvoted and argued with as if the only way to handle this is to wipe all the camps in these areas. It's like you didn't even read my comment at all, I was responding to folks wanting camps removed from the area or nuking them, both would require a rebuild.
---
people only dislike it when a camp intentionally blocks the drum.
---
I was thinking about this the other day, i still remember the first day I played and it didn't work when I tried to move a dead body out the way so I could loot the one underneath. Didn't work so I went to check the settings and see what button it was. It didn't exist ☹
---
....When a bug is so weird the devs could play it off as a Bioshock Infinite Easter egg
---
Last time I looked I paid my money like everyone else.
---
I build my CAMP my way for me. Don't like it, just walk away or server hop.
---
If youre starting right now, take advantage of the meat week event to get some seriously easy power leveling in.
---
Np! Glad you found it :)
---
Or post here and hope Bethesda hears it. I don’t think you are grasping the fact that walking away or hopping servers doesn’t solve the issue, some things you can’t unsee.
---
I only have got 2 duplicate cards so far.
---
The same way that any camp item stays still.
---
i like the times minutes idea. maybe 60 minutes? then it becomes a PvP zone... could work
---
Dude the use amazon web services. That’s not how this works.
---
Avoid the main quest until you are a higher level.
---
take your time with the quest and dont try to rush it focus on exploring the forest reagion and maybe push into the toxic valley/ash heap at around lvl 15 
---
find out what weapons are the most fun too you and focus on these except weapons
---
trying to utilize 3-4 weapon times is a bad idea id say choose 2 at max
---
also get a looting habit :)
---
They don’t own the servers...
---
That might help, although many of the pictures I've taken weren't at events (at least, not that I noticed).
---
Nobody cares about getting your attention, kiddo.
---
You might not have read or understood my op, I'm only talking about people who completely block the drum. It's usually behind a locked door or even just inside a structure with no entry at all.
---
a) the odds of accidentally encasing the drum inside a locked room with no way to get inside is close to 0.
---
b) if so, problem solved!
---
c) nuke runs are trivially easy and you can easily net tons of lead to replace your ammo.  Melee characters can easily blow through without incurring much "expense".
---
I think a better question is, wtf is wrong with people who try to grief the entire server by encasing the drum?  Why are you defending those people?
---
First what platform second don't let people give you stuff it ruins your experience
---
I am not sure about this, but it's as good a theory as any tbh.
---
Those locked cottages at white springs drive me nuts lol
---
this would be fun
---
Drop one item on the ground and pick it up and it will be fixed.
---
I get that it's annoying but did you know that the event will still start after the timer runs out?
---
you are correct! If you check the Bot stop station terminals they have updated to say something about " Their Grand re- opening in 2078" . Before they use display error messages. The election season is next year in November so I'm betting presidential contest  opens next November or New year's to theme around election year. This fall is gonna be Halloween and wastelanders. My big wonder is what's in the tunnel near Harper's ferry that they through radiation around to keep you from building into. It used to be textured so you could walk behind it but now it's totally blocked. I'm guessing it's either Capital Wasteland, or Commonwealth. I want it to be The Pitt or Far harbor ( far harbor uses a lot of the same assets) but I don't think they would include a DLC area I'm a main game like that. Either way- I know for certain we are going to one or the other.
---
most people don’t do that lol
---
They're not going to make the stash heavier, that's silly
---
260 PVP Commando/Bloody Commando, 170 Heavy hitter queen build (up to almost 40k damage per swing now), 75 Sneak Rifleman build, and two level 2 mules.
---
You can test weapon damage on sandbag barriers. 
---
Huntersville has tons of them.
---
At least he didn't write it in an asylum, that would have been worse.
---
I've gotten a legendary every time I'd what I want to write but my very last one the group only got to the first tier that sucked wasnt even worth showing up, same with the prime event I went to just a second ago, some idiot was the only one there in the savage divide and didnt wait for anyone to show up and banged the drums, I show up in a shit storm while they ran up into the camp they had on the edge of the water all safe and snug, I got my ass handed to me by 4 bears and a Wolfpack,  wow that was insane after killing 4 bears by myself I left no sense in wasting ammo just so some one could sit snug in their tower and collect the prize I won them. Some people
---
Stay off Reddit.
---
First 10-20 levels use a melee weapon.
---
Try to explore. Take everything in and read/listen to stuff.
---
Think of a play style you want to go for. Use an online builder if you want perfection.
---
Make sure you realize you can pick a special stat and you are not forced to pick a card of the same special. (Look at the bottom of the screen to swap to different special cards)
---
Don't go crazy at people's shops till later. Enjoy being below 50, save your caps.
---
I recommend getting ammosmith (Agi card) if you use any type of fun and make ammo. And be sure you also get super super (luck card) too for even more crafted things (ammo/stims/etc). You don't have to keep them in the build, but have them on hand to swap out.
---
Take over places on the map, then just leave and only show up to do defend quests. Lots of exp.
---
Sleep in a bed to get the well rested buff. +5% Exp
---
Do the event at Mama Dolces when it pops up. Eat the food for another 5% exp.
---
Turn on passive mode after lvl 5 in the options if you don't want to be bothered with people shooting you outside of the designated places.
---
And finally, look for a community on discord if you want friends to play with. I finally did that and have had way more fun in the game.
---
Just have fun with it. All that I said above is a good idea, and stuff to keep in mind, but really just have fun and try to enjoy the game.
---
I don't mind them. There's going to be those "high-end efficiency" camps that make use of all the best stuff in the game for the "hardcore endgame" players... lol. 
---
And there's going to be the "themed" and decorated/well-thought-out camps that can look very appealing. 
---
Either way, Beth needs to unrestrict the CAMP building system to where it doesn't take me an hour to put a lamp on a desk, because it keeps going on top of whatever is above me.
---
Thats why u keep passive on
---
I got 3 different ones. Different playstyle each time.
---
this reply is golden
---
You don't seem to understand that some don't see it as a problem to be solved.
---
I build floating CAMPS because they work FOR me. As for your immersion, don't care. All the Fortnite refugee costumes break mine. But I don't want to stop people from wearing them.
---
Because they are playing their game their way, just like me.
---
I think that's what we are getting at. They have guides to follow to let u know how the event works. But dont worry ur not the only one
---
In process lasso the cores 0-7 are already checked for me. I’ll try and redo all the steps, but I still get 10/15 seconds freezes especially when fighting the SBQ. Looks like I’ll have to wait until Bethesda fixes it xD
---
10 minutes with zero resources for my melee or a trivial amount of ammo for my ranged characters that takes 5 minutes to replace.    
---
And as a reminder all nukes create a nuke zone that will spawn glowing enemies yielding fucktons of XP, increased odds of legendaries, and stabilizers and flux aplenty?  I don't see any problem at all.  
---
If someone who intentionally blocked the drum sees it an leaves - problem solved!  You will still get the same benefits of nuking somewhere else especially if you go to every meat week event in the red zone while it lasts.  
---
By your rationale, no nukes are "worth it".
---
You see them all the time because otherwise the bases aren't portable at all. Any foundation larger than 2x2 is basically impossible to place anywhere. At lest in my experice.
---
Like the mod that allowed this in 4, it was a really cool mod.
---
Sorry, *mansion
---
Thats fine, thats what the system is in place for. If enough people post here enough times Bethesda might make floating camps impossible, if it gets enough attention. If not, or until then you can do things how you like. 
---
I don’t play fornight so i’m not sure about that... there are the same costumes in fallout and in fortnight?
---
That was changed a while ago, yes. Since it seems like you've been out of the loop for a little bit you should know that Survival's going away after this week anyway. I think one of the more recent "Inside the Vault" articles went into detail on the "why".
---
Usual with this sub, just downvotes constantly. I've stopped posting all together
---
Right?! I really like it especially for new players AND the ract that we have a brand new wave if content coming in about two months!!!!
---
Because not everyone herms the game like you
---
Mr. Gage?
---
I did one full bloody and the other vanguard.
---
The event needs to be cleared quickly. It is timed. The only reason for the event is to complete it and get the meat at the end.
---
I can't help if I kill level 30 things too quickly. Sorry, not sorry, I want the quest done and all that meat.
---
Damn it, I won't be on for another 2 hours!
---
System, also, are you covering flux.
---
The rest is cheap, but the 60 different flux (10 per mod) needed is very costly, and worth many times more than the rest combined. I'm talking more than 25k caps value.
---
I mean its fine that you don’t care about others, I cant make you change, all we can do is hope that Bethesda makes the changes. I never played fortnight but that seems lame if fallout copied a costume from them.
---
i just world hopped for my sets bit building them would be a pain
---
Unless I get hit with a disconnect, I’ll still be on!
---
I made mine a proper raised camp. It has stilts, don't worry.
---
ya i have my camp on a deposit so i always got some
---
PS4
---
Want to play together I can help I just made a new character
---
Just keep an eye on what’s coming and land a shot on everything you see, and let the one-shotters kill them for you, sounds like a pretty good deal if you want to save ammo right?
---
I often play drums but have to break off to shoot squirrels. There's usually around 3 ppl just stood afk in the middle of the camp that could easily stop me multitasking
---
Have to, since basic needs like an effective respec option do not exist.
---
Excellent 😬
---
If some assclown can't be bothered to take 5 seconds out of their life to make their camp built directly on top of the drum grant access to it, I can't be bothered to wait 2 minutes with my thumb up my ass for the event to start.  
---
Just unlock your door or remove 1 wall until the event is over so you are no longer trolling an entire server of players ;)
---
No there doesn't. There will just be another op build. 
---
Just get a tesla rifle and spam it to get your tag.
---
Just because you can work around the shitty RNG doesn't mean that we should have to do this or that its the best way to encourage people to play the game.
---
There's not even a good way to communicate with people in game.  
---
In order to facilitate trades you have to go outside the game, that in itself is a bad design and could be improved.
---
You want Beth to change the game for your selfish reason, that you don't like floating CAMPs. I don't want the Beth to change the game to get rid of stupid costumes even though I don't like them.
---
Seems to me, you're the one that doesn't care about others, just what you want.
---
Because that's all this game is. Hell I think they even ripped the sound track for the atom shop from the Sims. Dont play stupid. The only reason for playing squirrel and going to get stuff all over for then? Oh right building/displaying stuff. If you are not doing this then you are just going around doing the same events over, and over for? Awww PvP gear? Neat shooting each other! The simple dwellers umm... "fun".
---
Actually it's a team event, I wrote that in the post? If done right everyone wins that's all I'm saying. It doesn't take much to look up and see the requirements to the event, very little effort is required. Just grab a drum and play not difficult to do right. You dont even have to physically do it, place ur character on the drum sit back til event is done and u did ur part. See not hard. It's a lot more fun when player have some idea of what to do.
---
300 atoms please fella
---
How is 60 flux worth 25k?? Flux sells 100-150c. By what you said you’re paying 416c each.
---
I like my camp mobile and unfortunately placing limitations and blue print capacity makes single foundation the way to go.
---
No I mean to people who don't play events often and have no voice chat you can't really expect everyone to just know how to play. Yeah it's easy to us because we play all the time but new players or randomers may not know
---
No I care about what the majority wants, I believe in democracy and the floating camps have long been a topic of concern on here, I’m not the first and I wont be the last.
---
It was probably just a two star not three. Some people asked this before. The first line in the description is the feature of the weapon or armor, not one of the stars. Wood armor for instance can have four features listed for a three star, the first line was just about the feature of wood armors in general.
---
Haha I expect the worst, then if I get something better, my expectations have are surpassed
---
I don't have the answer for that specific question, sorry.  the one way I've seen is people putting the no scrap items in a separate vending machine and have them all set to 25k caps
---
I got a stalker’s, and scripped it immediately 👌
---
Can't wait until we get Sling Tv on the Tv in our CAMPs
---
Nope, nothing
---
yeah there needs to be a way for new players and players disinterested in PvP to use workshops with no risk, but that option can’t be open to everybody.
---
I got a melee character and a rifle character and a mule
---
If you are 30, you are a millennial, you madman.
---
Lack of stash space? Does nobody remember when it was 400? 
---
Yeah I check the market subreddit, still 5% of the players of the game this would effect. I would rather them fix shit than try to pretend that they could make a real bank system.
---
They can't even make it so your magazines and bobbleheads don't take space in your camp when displayed or that I have to relog to add a friend to my list every time...
---
This is pointless and for a small minority of complainers.
---
Be leery of this though.... if it's advertised people will look, and you may be bought out of a favorite item (like a specific Mr. Fuzzy); best idea I've come up with is have one vending machine separate from the rest behind a wall that must be removed to get to it, and it's not powered up so it doesn't skew my display numbers.
---
Cool ill give that a try if it happens...
---
I’m using a jetpack, so the torso mod is a no-go. The bracers only reduce AP cost of power attacks?
---
Really because that's how life is. You work harder, make more money (simple $20 a check if anything cool shows up, although I am sure there are those with no as good self controle), and you get more. I mean you dont have to play "keep up with the Jones", but if you buy something more you better be able to use it. That seems rather basic. I have a second character that I have been forced to use because my other one is "done", and I dont want to change much about it.
---
They are random spawns, i think there are 4 or 5 games...
---
Oh I agree and I have said sorry if I sound angry I'm not been grinding all night and so far it has gone well, only once did I not get a legendary which is not bad. But I agree with u. But if a newbie or randomer is reading just play drums or turn a spit that's it prize is basically the same. But that u for the comment, and again ur right
---
Probably because of the work needed to actually get the different types of flux. If there's no nuke zone in the server, you have to make one or hop until you find one. And both of those options take time and effort.
---
bulk flux takes a long as heck time to gather, you don't just fire one nuke and walk away with 60.
---
I may have massively overestimated the cost of flux, I am not really into the market side of the game, still at 100 caps / flux you are looking at just covering the cost of flux on the offered amount, which is fine I suppose.
---
I got mine in a player vendor cheap :)
---
Search Trelmari on YouTube 😊
---
Advice, enemies that don't die don't respawn. So if you can take a cheap and cheery combat shotgun and use the enforcer perk to cripple the enemies, they become only a minor nuisance, and don't get replaced, though there are a few enemies in the game who recover their limbs over time, mirelurk kings, super mutants, legendry's who regen, most will stay crippled forever.
---
Other potential weapons are a 50 call with one gun if you want the cheaper in bulk ammo, limb damage legendry weapons, but shotguns are the best bet to do it fast.
---
Its more convenient as you don't gotta worry about shitty terrain
---
I have all of them, it's one of the atom challenges.
---
Plans for each 3 tenderizer. mod. The weapon itself(not a plan). Plan for meat cleavers(same stats as throwing knifes, so useless). Tato salad recipe(gives +30 healt, fairly easy to make). Grillmasters hat. Bloody chef hat and apron.
---
Might be missing few on the list but that covers most.
---
Then you get little bit of meat cleavers and possibly stims/other generic consumable.
---
Lifegiver, Chem fiend, fireproof, radicool, revenant. Amazing perks for endurance (that’s usually underrated)
---
I've been looking for that one! Goodness knows how many times I've found Grognak &amp; the Ruby Ruins and Zeta Invaders...
---
Are you asking because you want to be the flavor of the month?
---
Still not worth 400c+ each flux? If you guys are paying that much for flux add me and I’ll sell you tons at 400c each
---
I feel the exact same way! I’m level 97 and have been playing since the beta. Almost every time I log on, I’ll spend 1-2 hours just working on tweaking my camp to make it look as perfect as possible
---
There’s a bunch of different powerful classes. Depends on your play style.
---
You on ps4, xbox or pc? I would like to look at it if your on ps4
---
Can you hold Amazingly Awesome Tales #6 for me? I’ll be on in an hour or so.
---
Play style doesn’t matter. Just looking for what currently is the most powerful amongst all classes.
---
I’m not sure what you mean, sorry.
---
I hate it when people complain about fallout 76 in a fallout 76 group.
---
Saved for you
---
So i'm guessing you're one of those people that think bloodied isn't worth more than 5k...
---
Thanks :)
---
Well get a TV station up and running 😉
---
Yes! I always play the drums cause no one else will
---
Why are you asking? Are you just gonna build it because "LUL STRONG!"
---
PA users can't use Serendipity, which quite sucks.
---
It's a timed event. If we "wait" so everyone can get their shot then we would fail the event. Most of y'all just perch up above the drum barrel and wait. Some of these enemies we have to run down to clear the wave.
---
I am familiar with the item as I have over 700 hours on my main.  It was three stars at first
---
Millenialls arent born in the 80s...
---
Done with you, anyway. You're obvs not a trader or just dont have that impressive of an inventory, so you dont get it.
---
What I find annoying is you can't use vats through the chain link fence, and your vats accuracy falls down drastically if your vision is impaired by grass
---
They nuked us that's why they aren't playing with us.
---
My psn will be jafar_quenton_7.
---
We can hope. I've had several times where I had to play telephone with people because one of us couldn't hear. If you lower your master volume it effects voice chat volume as well which caused issues for me. Everything else was still loud but voice chat became really quiet. Good luck and I hope you all enjoy the game.
---
I can't converse with someone who doesn't understand what a millennial is anyways.
---
Good luck with your hording problem/addiction.
---
thats why they never have room in their stash
---
They are all powerful. It depends on how you play...
---

If you have a question about something, please put the question **in the title**. **Avoid the use of trailing ellipsis.** Posts with ellipsis are generally clickbait and non descriptive. Reddit does not make it possible to edit titles, so you will have to post again with a more descriptive title without a trailing elipsis. If you have questions you can feel free to message the moderators.
---
Physically sure they don't own that, but whoever's service they are using to house their servers? If what they are using right now is a 100 devices, well double it. Poof that should give you enough power to give a 25-30% jump in budget, and worlds better world stability. Like whatever they are running on now they can toss more money at.
---
Awesome, do you want to add us when you're online?
---
Ooof
---
I dont really bother with workshops anymore last one i did was to get crystals to do the photography possum badge. Needless to say I think I pissed off the guy that kept trying to take it over. All the resources were available and was being friendly but nope it just had to be owned by him.  Swear some people are just jerks.
---
In life if I buy new furniture my house gets bigger automatically so I have room for my new furniture? Weird... hasn’t been my experience. I just bought a new couch and had to get rid of my old one to make room. My house didn’t expand.
---
Why don't you just start another character and try building with it?
---
Sure you won't have all the plans your main has or blueprints won't carry over but you'll have all your shop purchases. 
---
Maybe even just concentrate on this new character as a builder only.
---
LOL. It's a game. And Beth isn't passing out voting booths. Crap loads of things here have been "topic(s) of concern". Frankly, Beth probably won't want to do the extra coding (and not just on this) to fix your immersion problem. It's not a bug or a game breaking problem. It just irritates you. But you just keep banging your head against that wall and keep imagining you are fighting the fight for everyone. When really you are just bitchin' for what you want.
---
prime receivers no longer give stars
---
weapon effects like the fixer has do not count as a star as well
---
unfortunately the above wont give you 5 stars
---
Sure. I just wanted you to know from whom the request will come. I don’t have a mic. :)
---
It doesn't actually show up as five-stars in the weapon info, but yeah that's five distinct effects on one gun.
---
Used to be, the Sacrificial Blade mod for the Machete added a star, so you could have a four star Machete. I think the Scorched-Killer Receiver used to work the same way, too? But those have both since been patched out.
---
I wonder when we'll finally get five-star items. Now *that's* going to be a grind.
---
I've got a pet deathclaw and I moved just for him and he followed to it just fine. I had to server hop and wait a few mins though
---
How many Ruby Ruins do you have?
---
I'm deaf as a post, and the fiance is kinda shy because of his autism so all good on the mic
---
yeah griefing sucks.  also a nuke run uses hella stims and aid, so...  also also nuking someone for annoying you is petty as shit
---
Unfortunately I am on PC sorry! The best I can do for you is the video tour is linked in the post!

Well i’m sure its not the first time you’ve been wrong. I cant make you care about others immersions, and I can’t change anything myself. All I can do is post here and hope for the best. Now at least your aware of how people feel, act as you please man. There is a post about this every other day it isn’t exactly a new concern.
---
I’d say the cost for the build u are after is 10-12k based on flux and cost effort of collecting...
---
Plus you need a weapon legendary effect to come with it something like +70% dmg at full hp(100% 0rads) dropping to -30% dmg at 0% hp. 70% seems high by maintaining your hp at 100% or even above 90% is much harder then at 20% and you don’t have nerd rage bonus
---
Yeah some of the higher levels just stand there knowing that they can't die anyways.
---
The game is not designed for 12 year olds. 
---
So if it upsets you so much then instead of a child it makes you an asshole, is that better? 
---
It’s a pretty asshole thing to do to go online to complain about the time people spent trying to be creative in role playing game. 
---
You mentioned Bethesda but it’s not even a Bethesda thing. It’s a player thing, and they are enjoying the game in he way they see fit. They aren’t griefing you or following you around begging you to compliment their camp. They are just building them for themselves. 
---
Don’t be an asshole and just enjoy the game.
---
If by power you mean damage then obviously its Bloodied. But the comment below is right, it depends on play style. If you're looking for balance, look at Junkies / Vanguard or something in that region. Otherwise Bloodied outclasses everything in terms of raw damage.
---
Well i’m sure its not the first time you’ve been wrong. I cant make you care about others immersions, and I can’t change anything myself. All I can do is post here and hope for the best. Now at least your aware of how people feel, act as you please man. There is a post about this every other day it isn’t exactly a new concern.   
---
Call it “bitching” all you want to give it a negative connotation, but this is the place to voice concerns, like it or not.
---
It's a reference to the guy that built an AK using a shovel for the receiver a few years back.
---
AWS scale to you. They are massive. It isn’t a set number of servers it expands as users expand.
---
no one doesn't use stims or aid, those are resources as well
---
&gt;By your rationale, no nukes are "worth it".
---
how the fuck does nuking someone for annoying you equal no nuke runs are worth it?  so it's a nuked zone, most random places aren't worth it, so yeah, nuking an asshole just because he pissed you off is petty as fuck.
---
So is what you are telling me is Amazon if given money would not double their service output to give them more. As I said in another post if they are "stable" with a 100 devices right now, but double their stamp with 200 devices... you dont think that would help
---
Cheers missed I that thread and its better than mine, I'll delete this one.
---
No changing the name calling to another term doesn’t change a thing, call me any name you like. This is where people voice concerns for Bethesda to hear and this has been an issue long before today. You don’t care about others experiences thats fine,  but others do. sheesh .
---
I would like to see them allow you to invest caps in your own vending machines. As a cap sink. Then for every x amount spent, you get a discount on the weight of items in your vending machine against your stash. So you'd not get a ton of freed up stash space, but a bit. And it'd be a cap sink.
---
Yes, please. Upvote and make this trend!!
---
I think they can have ALL the bears and Mr. Fuzzys for 25K a piece, I could really use the money!  I'm too early in the game to be worrying about this, money would be helpful.  I also still have to get out of the packrat mentality from F4, and if I really want a certain thing I could eventually find it again, since it'd respawn... unless it was guarded by something ridiculous.
---
That’s not how it works... it isn’t a set number of servers.
---
Jesus Christ you just can’t let it go? What is wrong with you dude? Yes you are bitching. The one who is making it negative is you, by bitching.
---
You realize that in bitching about people’s camps you are literally saying you don’t care about those people’s experiences. What an incredibly selfish person you are.
---
It’s a non issue, chill the Ef out.
---
No, probing for change is not being  a 12yo or bitching or whatever spin you wanna put on it. these posts obviously aren’t gonna stop,  no matter how hard you try and manipulate it. most people dislike the floating camps, plain and simple.
---
How about instead of bitching about people at the event and not knowing what to do, you put on your mic and help someone out.
---
I only have time for one 🙄
---
Not really, but I also think having a shower in the front door is a real odd choice for aesthetic
---
what a fucking drag
---
your like a broken record, its not gonna win you an argument just cuz you call it bitchin or childish, majority of people dislike the floating bs, plain and simple are you daft or just trollin lol
---
There I did
---
It has, I have the new armor on both Excavator and my Stangler Heart armor so it works on all of them.
---
Done it. They dont listen. What's your next solution
---
I said nothing about square footage. But if I buy a poster I better be able to hang it. If I buy a light I better be able to plug it in. If I get a new rug I better be able to toss it on the floor.
---
I think a fairer estimate for flux cost, based on a ton of fast-travel shopping (which includes buying HRFs to make my own stable flux) is 150 caps/unit. I see usual prices from 100-250 caps/unit, but 150 is about usual.
---
Floating camps kill the game's sense of immersion for me. It's not the end of the world, but they just feel cheap and poorly designed. The only floating camp I liked was the guy who made the lil' mini Prydwen.
---
Im alwase eather on drums or rotisery
---
Have fun!  Explore and kill and laugh and meet people.  Hours of fun await you!
---
If our walls are full you need to get rid of some old ones to make room... you need to remove your old light to make room for something new. If your budget is full you need to make room lol
---
I'd rather be stabbed in the face than have to have children in this game. Or irl, tbh.
---
I'm only 114 and I do my best to kill everything for xp, if there are a bunch of low levels then I will use a lower damage weapon and take the beasts health down and let the low levels finish it off or just finish it if they cant. I dont think I have seen a high level just stand there yet but I'm sure it happens.
---
I do wish there was a simple reroll feature. Even if you have to spend Caps on it. But you CAN reroll now. Once you hit level 50 you can reroll one point every level. It's a slog, but most people over level like 75 have some built up, so if they decide they want to tweak it they can. I currently have 15 levels saved up, and have pretty much finalized my build in a way that I enjoy playing. I've got over 1000 hours in game, and play pretty slowly compared to a lot of the other 1000 hour gang. I'm only level 193. I only have 15 because I've spent a few on random cards I don't "need" but wanted to play with. Also occasionally I'll take a point from something I'm not using, like Charisma, and put it somewhere I need more. I had Max Charisma for a bit because I was trying to tame creatures. But once I realized that no matter what I did, they were going to die, I gave up on that.
---
I’ll be on tonight if you’re still looking for it.  It’ll probably be 4 to 6 hours from now though till I’m off work and done with night school if you’re alright with that.  GT is BenevolentDM
---
Well, the idea could be tweaked. Say, it lets you select \_one\_ material to look for. Or, the mod requires a lot of difficult parts, like flux.   
---
But, given how much info's on the Web about finding stuff...
---
yeah you came into this convo negative from the start, all the thread is pointing out is the same thing that gets pointed out everyday about floating camps, they ruin the immersion. You came in negative since your first response so dont try and pull that “bitchin” shit, your schoolyard tactics aint gonna work here

It just might.  I farmed Bivs final recipe for months before I finally got it. And when I did, I did something I never tried, which was taking a daytripper

I don't mind them. I think the rules Bethesda has set forth when it comes to building is utter bullshit, and if people have an easier time making floating camps than camps that look "real", more power to them.
---
Actually, they do. Most people stash less than that, the ideal number is around 50 or so per scrap item except the handful of items you use on the regular for crafting or fixing things in your load out. I personally sell mine in my vending machine, not at the station vendors, but same difference.
---
I commented on the wrong post, sorry.
---
Agreed, I desperately want cosmetic, nameable pets. I’d kill for a vanity pet a la ESO where it literally does nothing except follow you around. I dont care if it can defend your CAMP like the ones we have now, frankly I’d prefer it didnt.
---
You do realize that bitchin about other people’s concerns is literally saying you dont care about those peoples experiences? how incredibly selfish of you. 
---
chill out and stop trying to deny facts, like it or not it does ruin things for alot of people, numbers dont lie im sorry but your not gonna win this one bud
---
My house is up there, and you spawn under the floor. Literally the safest place ever lol.

Don’t forget, this is a 50% slow on spoilage that they already increased the rate of in game 6 months ago- likely by 50% knowing them.

With the backpack adding 60lb carry weight, I have more carrying capacity in my non pa build than any p.a. except for the excavator.  I'll use my T-45 for nuke events.  Other than that, I just carry my excavator to get an extra 100 or 200 l bs (if you join server wearing the armor you get 500 lbs carry weight until you exit the p.a.).
---
Also this, I take zero fall damage no matter what I jump off of. I LOVE it. I regularly throw myself off things and people are "confused" emoting all around me lol.
---
My camp is technically a two foundation floating base on sloping terrain, but you can't tell because I hung walls under my floors to glitch into the ground so it looks like a fully walled in supported structure with an enclosed resource collector, crops and nuclear generator all inside and safe from attack. Having only 2 foundations saved me a boat load of build budget which allowed me to decorate more ornately, so I frequently get messages from other players asking how I was able to build so much and that I have a nice camp.
---
I hate floating Camps so much - I built my Camp underground. And it's only like 5% immersion breaking (having to play an instrument to get under ground) But it's enclosed to it looks pretty nice
---
Just increasing it’s damage to something actual significant would be nice too.
---
Considering Cranbery Bog's event seems to fail by time out a lot, killing everything there as fast as possible actually IS the right idea.
---
Why ya gotta go and be a groundsist?
---
I suppose your in favor of the underground ones then?
---
I smell another war brewing...
---
What’s your normal strength at with no boosts? If you are able to maintain that strength you could easily grab a deathclaw gauntlet or mole miner and do great melee dmg with your commando. When that happens do you check diseases and boosts? Also joining a team and having someone share perk cards could be where the random boosts come from maybe?
---
It's so ugly and disastrous.
---
I love lake camps and tree houses, those always seem to fit just right.
---
Me, I'm a dry lake bed 20 steel/hr kinda guy.
---
All i ask is for safe spawns and not hurdling into spiky rocks
---
cool, it's within a gatehouse and creates an aesthetic arch, I think it's a great idea, especially with the switch, plus where tf else should a decon shower go if not before the entrance?
---
Ah, that makes sense. I was trying to figure out what you said had to do with what he said and I couldn't get it lol
---
The building needs a rework bad tbh.
---
That sounds really close to my commando build, I need to look at my stats and see how I match up. If it’s random I would think it could be from stranger in numbers or that luck perk that helps with mutation negatives. If not those let’s find out!
---
I've had that happen a few times. Exiting and reloading the game has always fixed it so far.
---
I edited my original. Reply with more info. And Nope no team stuff, I'm 99% solo. Its a long time since Ive had a Death claw gauntlet on me. But I believe I'm somewhere around 800 dmg with one without a single melee per card 😂.
---
But my handmade is at 290+ dmg in auto so to me.... Its much more lethal.
---
Also no diseases did this, or other chems etc. Its definitely a doubling of Unyielding stats.
---
Yeah, I have a first floor you get stuck in, then stairs up to the main part of the house, and I always have to FT, FT again to get out of the damned floor. But you don't fall to your death, AND nothing can attack you there, so I mean at least it's safe.
---
It's not shady; it's common retailing.  You get the eager beavers up front, then as interest wanes, you sweeten the offer to get the value shoppers.  If you think you paid too much, learn from it and develop some patience.  The best day to buy Christmas wrapping paper is December 26th.
---
I just want to fill my bathtub with prewar money.
---
We are at our camp now, and we have ot on us ready to drop for you
---
Last time it happened and I actually noticed. Was when I logged back in after a disconnect. I only noticed because I was getting 300+ xp from 68 mutant warlords and I normally get around 250.
---
Maybe open tables instead of display cases, that would look nice.
---
Don’t suggest this or it’ll just end up being a looped atom store commercial
---
Agreed
---
What's that? people in an online game just show up and let others do the game for them.    
---
shocking.
---
I have mine on a second floor.  It’s the public barracks area.
---
I'd love some actual good emotes for a change.
---
Yeah, kept failing the cranberry bog one last night. Ash heap mobs spawned so far away, took us a few min just to run over and kill them, failed that too
---
Very interesting! If you grab a unstoppable monster you could save ammo and smash the queen without having to change anything. I know a few commandos that do this when we farm sbq. If you figure out where those boosts come from please let me know! That 41 Luck though!
---
They don't?  That's even worse because there's absolutely nothing that indicates that.
---
Thank you!!!
---
I'm hyped for it I need better guns best one I have is my exploding railway rifle
---
Now that you mention that there are times when I load to the queen and my damage just dumps to doing 150 per hit when I average 5300. I wonder if that’s related.
---
The only issue I have found with floating camps is when your inside and the person leaves the world. I don't see what the big issue is if you've ever built a camp before you know how long it can take and some people change camp locations often the single base makes it much easier and allows for more game time play instead of constantly having to re-build the camp and re-do your vending machines, every time you move your camp. By far single 2x2 foundations with stairs are much easier to place. The BETTER option would be for Bathesda to make it easier to place and blueprint a single level camp. Haven't we had enough nerfs!!!
---
Little Lamplight flashbacks.
---
###
---
... so why am I supposed to be disappointed?
---
What gun(s) are you hoping for?
---
Next update: 'New' (direct port from fo4) stairs in the atom shop! 1500 atoms! (And they don't line up with or match anything else in your camp)
---
I would add a /s here but honestly this wouldn't surprise me one bit after the last stairs we got
---
Ooooo....I have an unstoppable monster. Never thought to actually use it 😂
---
I have a Bloodied FFR handmade primed that I use on the Queen. And plenty of ammo.
---
I'll try make myself disconnect and see if when I log back in I have the boosts, I suspect changing any armor might remove them though. I know respawning definitely does.
---
Stay far away from center divide and stay far away from cramberry bog
---
Common retailing = shady. And in the same post i said im only gonna get bundles on sale now. Idk what ur point is.
---
I was talking about myself personally in the third person..you may be very happy..at the end if the day sone people will do well but it's a craps hoot.. the 3 star mystery pick will be popular though..
---
Lol I was trying to replay to a few different subs and somehow it ended up here. It’s best to not reddit and play 76 at the same time.
---
Sleep sleep sleep
---
5%xp bulb is significant
---
Most welcome! The fiance does magazine runs every day - the autism likes routine lol!
---
Right on! Lol
---
I'm hoping for a minigun or Gatling laser that's not terrible.... I love playing heavy but my "heavy" guns are all pretty bad I just started playing again about 3 weeks ago though so all in good time
---
What kind of communist grab assness is that? Lol when I am a lv 200 I should not be limited the same as a lv 100.
---
It seems like it's more of a timing thing.  If I join a random server in the early morning PST (like, 7-8 am), I seem more likely to get what I assume are Asian servers judging by the usernames.
---
Just makes them tastier really. They taste too stringy as is.
---
Good luck brother. For me if I get 2 pieces of sentinel Unyielding armour I will be happy lol
---
What's your gamer tag? I want ro check out your base. 👍
---
Tactical Armageddon
---
I don't like them but I'm glad the mechanics that allow them to exist are there. I use the floating to go around and integrate with existing buildings, and things like a light setup for a stage would be impossible or really tricky to make otherwise.
---
Sooner than you think.
---
Yeah just some glowing meat, whisky, RadShield and whip out the unstoppable monster when she lands and you should be putting out over 2k per sneak attack hit to her head. If you want to conserve ammo and don’t want to change anything to your build. Let me know if you get it to work. I need to go check my commando stats now lol!
---
there are some datamined objectives near whitesprings that may be for a halloween event.  thats about all we know so far
---
Murphy5486. On Xbox. Shoot me a message and I’ll let you know when I’m on.
---
they fit nice in the tall display cases.  I have 9 different bears on display so far. lol
---
I want Grahm's Late Show: Featuring the Responder Bot.
---
...then immediately on sale for 50% off. Or in the "Media bundle" where 400 more atoms gets you an emote.
---
And insult bot
---
dont you have the perk that allows you to consume rad x and still keep the mutation?
---
THIS
---
Happens randomly to me, all I have to do is retry the transaction, orbackbout of trade menu and restart.
---
MVP!
---
No, just like drops from legendaries and other event reward drops. The game doesnt check for player stats when rolling the drop chances they set for each reward.
---
But that doesn't get more money
---
Yes, since the most recent update, the description does tell you which armor part the mod fits. Thanks for updating this thread.
---
I have the Zealot's Urban Scout Armor Chest Piece, a three-star legendary. With the polymer mod, the damage resistances are: 85 ballistic and 55 energy. Those numbers might be a bit higher on a different armor piece, because this one is END +1. (The trade-off for an endurance buff seems to be lower DR.) Anyway, that might give you some idea whether it is worth it to you to make the change.
---
Incidentally, my Scout Armor Chest Piece weighs 9.45 lbs with polymer and deep pocketed.
---
That happens when you try to register again with the same email that has already been registered. 
---
Use "login" instead .)
---
How recent was this? 
---
 Because I definitely lost a deathclaw moving from South of 76 to top of the world.
---
Optimized bracers are + Str + reduced AP.  
---
Hydraulic bracers add bonus damage to unarmed, and deliver an electric charge to the enemy.
---
IDK if those also reduce AP cost - I’d have to look it up again.
---
I have one of each arm on my PA, so I get the best of both :)
---
Bonus - applying the mod to excavator does not remove its extra ore capability.
---
Not when the rush up to the front and one shot spray everything without checking to see if everyone has got a shot in. You can wait a few seconds before killing everything
---
Or the Hawaiian music at the meat cook out!
---
I thought everyone loved a floater 🤔
---
ah ok I get it now
---
Bloodied unarmed followed by. Bloodied commando. Sneak bonuses+ 80% more then regular gum damage. More with stacking foods mutations perks.
---
Nope. Some people are using the events to level up, we need XP and don’t get any if we don’t get a shot in on anything
---
I mean. I try not to.
---
that's why Todd invented vampiric weapons, though stims are a dime a dozen in any event ;)
---
The events are supercharged while nuked.  Seems just as rational to me as nuking Whitesprings for the 5000th time.  I'll nuke them even if there's no camp blocking the drum, so you do you my bro and enjoy your day :)
---
Ah I am glad..I was getting my passport ready lmao
---
So what? I take every chance to get my BE25 handmade :)
---
If you're in one that's failing, and only has a couple minutes left, server hop.
---
I vastly prefer CAMPs that are on the ground. Firstly, it's easier to access and look around to see how they've decorated. Second, floating CAMPs don't have nearly as many design options as ones on the ground. I built a nice little raider base in the mountains overlooking New Gad and Summersville that would've been impossible to do if I just built up.
---
ok tryhard, stims are not a dime a dozen, and vampire only does so much
---
Those flat earthers are hard to please
---
I'm still looking for a bloodied\+power attack-PowerFist, in a sea of 1hnd and 2hnd weps.  good hunting to you
---
And so you should brother..so you should. I got my ome from purveyor...God roll so anything is possible. So take your so what? And good luck l!
---
Good luck brother.
---
Would love to know as well. My crew and I have not been able to complete expert on wash out, we complete standerd with ease.
---
We got into the reactor room on one expert attempt, with about 1:30 left, but failed there. We had gooten 3 pump codes and hacked all the terminals
---
Alrighty, then i’ll definitely be trying that out. Thanks.
---
Yes! I want my CAMP to look like a post-apocalyptic garbage dump. Brakes my immersion to look at my CAMP when it looks so clean and tidy (more like empty and not lived in).
---
I must say this complaint about floating camps is super petty
---
Undead Paladin with a full set of Orichalcium Crusted Thongs and pair of Mighty Orbs of Swamp Gases.
---
Yeah, not sure if they were meant to be stars but then were patch to not, so people couldn't "make" scip for the purvayor.
---
Mobile is the way to go, I have blue printed sections that snap together nicely. I'm always resource/event hopping.
---
Yeah but you're seizing it from another player, not like, the government or ruling class.
---
I mean for FO76
---
I have failed three in a row now due to only 2-3 of us showing up
---
Did the loot distribution change? Last time I did that with a low level the low level didn't receive any loot from the SBQ, so only shooting the adds is a bad idea.
---
I mean FO76
---
It's true. But arguably in a post-apocalyptic wasteland, owning the means of production makes you part of the de facto ruling class.
---
Overall, me and my 3 friends go for all 4 pumpcodes.
---
We basically structure it up like this after the dual robot escort room:
---
Person A hacking
---
Person B defending hacker/doing pipes/looking for Alpha pump code
---
Person C in pumproom for pipes + 2 pump codes
---
Person D in the agriculture room looking for 2 codes + pipes
---
Once the 30s countdown starts after the robot room, Person A + B bolts it to the hacking room with Person A ignoring everything but the hacking terminals(Keep an eye out for the pump code, though!) Person B does the pipes while defending Person A.
---
Person C stays in the exit room and does pipes 
---
Person D heads to the agriculture room for pipes + codes
---
People call out when they found their pump codes and which one they find, then go and input them.
---
If the codes arent found when the hacking is done, The hacker moves on ahead and does pipes + finds out what way is open
---
We average 3:50 - 4+ minutes when we enter the engineering room, Below 2 is pretty much a fail.
---
We have 2 people at the error code terminals(A + C), 1 person defending (B) (temporarily) while also doing pipes + Gathering objectives
---
1 person (D) calls out the error codes, A + C does 2 codes and call out which breakers needs to be up/down while B and D does the breakers/gathers objectives, once A + C has the codes written down and what they need to do they do the mechanics on their own (swipe cards, in/outflow valves, etc) and calls out what needs to be gathered and done if they arent able to. We always do the breaker codes first to make it easier for everyone except the "All up/down one" that one needs to be done last.
---
if you have 45 seconds when the final room door opens its usually a cakewalk, kill mobs + pipes and have someone ready to rush up to swipe the card once the room is clear.
---
The Fog Crawlers and Anglers brought a few of those mines with them when they migrated into the mountains for FO76.
---
Totally agree. Floaters are the only CAMP design that can be blueprinted and moved. I've never found a foundation bigger than 2 x1 that I can recycle. I've even had trouble with a one unit shack design blueprint with little more than a bed, chairs, and TV.
---
I'd say the ruling class is people level 300+ lol, not some level 5 trying to get lead.
---
Finished Scorched Earth, got killed by a scorched mirelurk king 5 seconds later, "no flux for you, mate" D:
---
Don't hate the player, hate the game. Floating camps are simply a response to in-game mechanics.  
---
For instance having enemies spawn every time you fast travel back home.  I can't even tell you how many times I've had to run all around my camp to find the one remaining dog chewing on some random wall.  And now the wall is at 5% health and can't be repaired unless I delete and recreate, but when I try to delete it, I get that "cannot remove part as *something something* inaccessable" ... and you know what, F it, I'll just put the whole thing in the air and solve that problem.
---
Also, the map is insanely lumpy.  Like, I know the region is geographically supposed to be hilly, but what we got is absolutely ridiculous.  There are very few spots where you can build even a medium-sized foundation without the ground (and plants and rocks) clipping up into your camp.  The bulldozer feature is hit and miss at best.
---
And this lumpy geography leads into the 3rd point, easy to move.  If you **do** manage to find a flat enough spot to build a camp, or you **do** manage to work something out with the lumpy terrain ... well, eventually you're going to move that camp, and all that hard work is down the train.  If your whole camp is floating on a single stair-case, it's super-easy to move anywhere and find a spot to plop it down.  This is extra handy if you need to use your crafting benches.  If you need to cook, or repair, or get some water... you could spend 45 minutes fiddling with the geography and trying to rebuild your camp from the ground up, or you could just slap down your physics defying monstrosity, use the stuff, and get back to playing the game.
---
Yeah, floating houses suck.  But they are simply a response to the conditions provided.  If your camp wasn't constantly under attack, or if we had flatter terrain, or if the bulldozer feature worked properly and could remove/level the actual ground (like, you know, a bulldozer), and/or if you could repair slightly damaged structures... then you'd probably see more people getting attached to their well crafted and physics-accurate camps.  But that's not the West Virginia we live in.
---
Buying cool events, like a special camp party with minigames or something. Renting space in whitesprings. Hotel room, or Enclave bunker for short time. Buy your own train pushcart( one of those things with the see-saw you pump to move it. Paying into faction funds to earn special titles...
---
One of best camps I've seen! Fits perfectly into post apocalyptic world.
---
I feel like in the beta you could snap the small upper floor pieces over the mesh on the stairs
---
Then they don't get any rewards from the queen. It's not like it used to be when you just have to get a few shots on her to get the rewards.
---
Great, thanks! Yes, I'll send you a note and you can message me when you're on. Thanks again!
---
I just bang the drums or rotate the grills, no idea what else to do, lvl 216 here..
---
Not a fix, but if you have a friend on server, you can respawn on them.
---
again that's a playstyle choice.  unarmed-melee-rifle-pistol-etc it's what you want to play.  close or far, you choose that one
---
Last time I was off work and ran it to death only to get it on the last go round. This time I’ve gotten 5. There not that great, heavy and even with mods and melee build. More for your wall then anything. I’ve seen them for sale under 5000 now. I gave the 5 I got away and if I get anymore I’ll give them away as well.
---
It’s a crap shoot even when you have charisma and luck super high... I don’t mind either way I spend it as I max it and recycle what I don’t want but drop percentage aren’t great.
---
I had my camp beneath the tunnel. there is a dead survivor in a boat there. they had a chem table and a few scraps, meds and a brewing station.
---
To bad, no ider why i dosent work for you, just did a queen now together with my son, no lockups on any of us :/
---
And those ARE affected by the Zealot’s effect? Or no?
---
Now see, that actually sounds like fun and a nice change of pace.  Those are the type of camps that make things interesting.
---
Amen brother..I still haven't worked it out yet but something has to change..just think of all the players with mega scrip who will be maxing the purveyor out...something just dont feel right
---
Right. You wont visibly see the stars but in effect it would be. I have a 3* Instigating machete with the sacrificial blade mod which adds bleeding and poison damage. I consider it a 5*. My buddy in game calls it a 3*. Its all gravy.
---
Maybe, it could work.
---
With the Fallout 4 Pip-Boy app, once you unlocked a Pip-Boy game, you could play it on your phone.
---
I would certainly love to see it!
---
happens to me now on PC, even after repairing.  also still can't add friends but they're working on it I guess.
---
I doubt we'll see more damage-boosting receivers other than Hardened, the intent seems to be having most of the damage scaling tied to the weapon's level.
---
I do think at some point we'll see an expansion of mods for weapons currently lacking them. On top of the guns you mentioned, more mods for the Single-Action revolver and more sights and muzzles (like a suppressor!)  for the 10mm SMG.
---
Idk now that you mention it, but I remember being in someone’s camp once and I repaired all their stuff 🤷🏽‍♀️
---
This is disappointing how?
---
Thanks!
---
I belive so, i have a Zealot's explosive lmg with both Zealot's effect and prime effect pluss explosive, lets put it this way, i destroy them in 1sec 😂
---
yeah i would love that but it gives me an idea. let us build the vault tech projectors and be able to develop out photos and show them on the projector
---
Bloodied followed by bloodied followed by bloodied followed probably by junkie. So basically play the game super dead or addicted. Cause you know that makes sense lol
---
greifers are assholes, but nuking someone for annoying you is petty as fuck
---
You telling me your opinion doesn't mean I'm wrong. It just means you don't understand what an opinion is. FYI "immersion" is your opinion of what you want in the game. Get over yourself.
---
Hi wrong. it just means you don't understand what an opinion is. fyi "immersion" is your opinion of what you want in the game. get over yourself., I'm dad.
---
Damn really, is it easy to die when you run low health like that? I've seen people with tons of rads and no health and always wondered why they don't use radaway
---
That’s nice isn’t it, Just showing up will get you legendary loot from the queen. I bet even the queen will want to join the pacifist fight and loot other queens.
---
Yes. Their fix wasnt much because 6 out 10 melee drops for me will have limb damage, +1agility, or reduced weight.
---
It's so tiring getting these cause I immediately scrip them cause majority of them are just pure trash. And it seems like majority of legendaries I pick up are melee. I think all they did was slightly lower the chance rather than actually bothering to make it where the drops are balanced in some way.
---
Or a emote that’s an x with an ear for if you don’t have a mic
---
There was a mod for Fallout 4 that did what you’re asking for. I installed it and played for about three days before uninstalling it and being forced to roll myself back to a save made before using it. My game would lag, slow down to 2 frames a second and crash nonstop anytime I got near Sanctuary Hills. I didn’t even place all that many decorations. I think there were just too many assets present for the game to handle. 
---
My PC was very high end for the game requirements, so memory was not the issue. The mod could have been conflicting with existing official DLC. Who knows. It didn’t work even with all other mods disabled and rolling back to an older save.
---
I just don’t think the game is capable of loading the amount of assets you want. It seems to be straining to keep up with elaborate camps as it is. That’s probably why display cases take up so much budget and were implemented in such a limited fashion. Maybe we’ll get more later on, like wall shelves or tables. Who knows.
---
Maybe camp aficionados need a Fallout: Build-A-Vault spin-off that’s just building and decorating, without all the other game features like combat and monsters gumming up the interior design extravaganza. It was fun creating a very limited vault in Fallout:Shelter.
---
I want to be able to play by myself or with just my friends
---
You'll love mine! It's the tallest staircase I could build on top of Seneca rocks and the base itself is a giant wood circle
---
Well to start X-01 is not the best power armor for pvp, I could only imagine now what perk cards you have equipped. Despite this being a Fallout game pvp can be extremely fast paced like other shooters and you can drop in a second when up against somebody who knows what they are doing, there is a surprising amount of stuff to learn for pvp.
---
I do agree though armor especially power armor could do with a buff in general, but it doesn't mean you should be able to hop into a suit of X-01 and call it a day.
---
They did. Now I wish that I could manage those cards somewhere other than in the 1 minute I'm waiting in the lobby to join a match. Its stressful! I always feel pressures to pick a card really fast
---
&gt;Just Curious, Hellvent: I'm not clear on the Eyebot's motivation (this is FO-76). Was it leading rad-rat babies "over" the bridge or "off" an edge somewhere to their death? 
---
It spawns elsewhere too, without any water nearby. So it's just leading them "forward", whatever currently forward is.
---
If you can’t contribute to my question and write a proper meaningful message, either pull that thumb out of your arse and do post something with meaning or don’t post at all.
---
Added you, message me on here when you wanna play :)
---
thnx 4 this
---
Wait till wastelanders
---
I love my floating platform with a garden growing out of firepits.  ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯
---
Same. I built a little Nukashine shack/homestead complete with a little shop near the front gate. It's been a little difficult getting it built, not having all of the 'plans' to build all of the workshop stuff, but I'm pleased with how it's looking so far.
---
That does make sense. Being dead or addicted don’t make you feel a thing.
---
That's painting it quite black, I don't put it past Beth to initial implement it like that, but I think the outcry will make them backpedal.
---
yeah my mirror shows a weird place also
---
But if you’re on Pacifist, nobody can bother you anyways right? If you’re on your private server, how can you shop at others’ vendings other than your buddies’?
---
I’m very much in doubt. I like the LMG. It feels the most amazing in hands. Not much else.
---
“What does that mean for Adventure Mode or Nuclear Winter? Everything you know and love about these modes will not be affected by this adjustment”
---
It’s all about numbers and $$$... I don’t think anything will change unless it’s about workshops or possibly new events that would open up for PvP so people could join them if they wanted.
---
You get it from a robco magazine, like all the other games, right?
---
but but... why can't we just all own the means of production together? Then maybe Bethesda could decide when and for how long each player gets to use a workshop so it's fair. Maybe they could make every player the same level too. Then we would all be equal. Hey, we should all have the same weapons and armor too, and the same SPECIALS, and...
---
Appalachia could be a paradise!
---
But there must be things having an advantage? I read out on bloodied. High risk high reward. What’s a close second to bloodied?
---
Finally got a good server!
---
So far, 3/5 shishkebab plan, one bloody outfit
---
I would use the marine and sell the other in a vending machine.
---
rowers keep on rowing
---
You have nicer stuff but the same available space. Relax.
---
Send me an invite if you’re on X box and I’ll come see
---
I know, I mean I can have a weapon either in my stash, or on me instead of permanently keeping one item in my stash using stash limit, plus the laser on me would then be using my carry weight if that makes sense
---
That’s a good perspective and you’ve convinced me.
---
Sorry, I'm on pc
---
Nuclear winter is fun if you like battle royal.
---
There are perks like serendipity and dodgy to help with survivability. You don't have to run super low. I usually run around 30% or so unless I want to do a lot of damage for the Scorchbeast Queen or something. There are also other cards that increase your damage resistance in certain special trees.
---
Stability has nothing to do with number of servers. What I said is true. Read up on AWS.
---
I’ve showed up late twice and got a few shots in but still got the max prime cuts... I’m not worried about the random legendary kill at all.
---
wow thank you for the details.  I thought I was just lagging hard again.
---
Yeah a half arsed mod might cause problems, but if the game developers designed it in a way that they were just like any other camp object then it would work fine.
---
And it's not like you would be able to build 20+ camp decorations on top of the existing budget either, so if you maxed out on decorations you would have less room for lamps and turrets etc.
---
Kinda but kinda not. Let me break it down for you.
---
First, your stats are pretty good. You’ll have AP for days and sneak like a beast with all that agility, massive Strength meaning you’ll hit like a truck and plenty of things like luck and perception to make it all better.
---
Second, there are a host of perks and equipment you can use to minimize that. First, you’re probably running some of the straight damage reducers like Blocker, maybe Fireproof - everyone can run those. But, specifically for low health builds, you’ll have Nerd Rage in Intelligence that gives more damage and a flat % reduction on incoming damage that only kick in at low health. You’ll also run Serendipity which only works at low health as well, but has a decent chance to let you flat out ignore some hits. 
---
You can run things like Dodgy as well in Agility, to lose AP and reduce incoming hits a bit - I don’t on mine since I want all that AP for offense.
---
Finally, Unyielding is the primary legendary ability - and you’ll want others on there too to reduce damage. No reason you can’t use Sentinel or Cavalier like everyone else and 5 of those would give you (for instance) a 5 separate 75% chances to reduce the damage by 15%. I only have 3 on my bloody rifleman, but it’s still far more survivable than you’d think.
---
But...those are chances. So they don’t always work, and sometimes when a big hit comes in the RNG doesn’t love you and yes - you’ll die in one shot. More likely you’ll get slowly worn down if mobbed esp. by ghouls who may irradiate you like crazy.
---
So what you do is lean on stealth and straight up offense. Amp those other perks. Most things in most of PVE are dead before they can get close - only big mobs may cause problems (One Violent Night can get tricky). If they stand and shoot (like robots @ AWOL armaments) you may have to watch the slow death, and all the shots will eat your AP fast if you’re running dodgy - so you position, shoot, use cover, etc. Thankfully you only have to generally hit most things once for it to melt.
---
Gotcha, thanks man, I may grab myself a set of unyielding and try this out
---
Going off of observed trends we will get new things added to the atomic shop this coming tuesday. The only case I can see them not adding anything new is if they do a massive vaulting sale since there really isn't much in the files we haven't gotten already.
---
I've tried it and no I couldn't
---
I have a camp that sort of floats but the concept is its built INTO a Transmission tower outside of Point Pleasant, so it looks sort of floaty but its the only way I can justify a floating camp.
---
Thank you for your confirmation.
---
Damage wise the 50cal is but ammo is much easier to get for the gatling laser.
---
What is wrong with current system? I’m not really familiar with “scammers”
---
Don't even need a legacy - FFR UGL + Strangler melts her.  Takes less than 2 ultracite cores.  A faster fire rate Ultracite Gatling is one of the fastest firing weapons in game.  Can do this with a beam splitter gatling plasma as well, but on a non legacy you have to wait till she lands and get in her face since its basically a glorified plasma thrower.  Under 2 plasma cores will do it too I think.
---
Always had more people around when I tried the plasma, the only time I got to a less populated fight was 4 people with the UGL, and the other 3 didn't even seem to be using heavy guns.  I think I took her down too quickly that time, now I just pause some, switch to my VE 50 Cal to clear some mobs and give others more time to get enough damage to register for the queen kill.
---
The Ultracite Gatling Laser is my favorite heavy gun - great accuracy, tons of dakka, but I don't use it much, only really need it for a fight like Scorched Earth and not much else.  Even before Patch 13 and the Stranger PA, its already a very nice weapon, but just incredible now.  And until they change how energy ash piles behave, they should be used sparingly.  No worries about killing yourself too - unlike a legacy.
---
Thank you this is very detailed and gives me a lot to work with. I'm going to switch some things around and give this a go. Always wondered how I wasn't doing as much as other guys my level, now I know
---
How did you do the free floating walls around the camp?
---
It depends on what you’re doing in game. Bloodied sucks for pvp but is good in pve. There are lots of different builds that can come close to bloodied.  Junkies, furious, aa, just play the game and find out what works for you instead of expecting reddit to play it for you
---
If you can get a half decent bloody weapon for 12.5k caps, I need to shop where you’re shopping. 50k is a bargain, if they’re willing to take caps at all. 99% of the time you need a different legacy or bloody weapon to trade for it. Maybe a perfect uny/ap/sent armor piece, but armor doesn’t generally command the same astronomical premium as a weapon does.
---
Shotguns have literally fallen off the trading map since the last nerf. No one accepts them anymore for good reason, even a BE version.
---
Actual PA radiation resistances don't matter much. PA and enviroment suits have secret radiation near-immunity that does most of it. Conventional armor can have much higher radiation resistance together with drugs, and you would still suck up several times as much rads, because they lack the unlisted effect.
---
That bug sounds like with that paint, the suit would be considered imcomplete, as if missing the arms completely.
---
Don't really know why people use bracers, though. With PA you can't use unarmed melee/punching attacks, and at least excavator bracers just reduce the durability of arms a bit.
---
Does anybody else love circle jerks?
---
I will watch the skies for glowing beams when they come.
---
&gt;ok tryhard, stims are not a dime a dozen,
---
Well, if you have the Chemist perk, they pretty much are . . . 🙄
---
The main thing is the best items in the game are worth cap amounts that can not be transferred in 1 trade thus you have to swap characters thus making it extremely easy to scam. The mid to low tier weapons of course can be bought for under 30k caps but the higher tier weapons/armor can't
---
Endurance is bugged on all gear and doesn’t work although it shows in your special, only your base endurance and buffs from food/drugs works
---
It will be just like dropping a nuke during meat week, servers will crash due to the concentration of players hitting the purveyor in a mile long line out the door and down the street. I’ll just keep spending mine until then.
---
Yes. Zealot's, Prime receivers and Scorch-killer's receivers give damage boosts versus Scorched humanoid, Scorched creatures, Scorchbeasts and the Scorchbeast Queen.
---
Reporting
---
Really? Figured I'd be met with a deluge of negative commentary. Haha thanks
---
I'd like to visit your town :) is your name same as here?
---
Zeleot effects the queen and scorched beasts I use a shredding zeliots mini gun on both as a heavy gunners build and it works well. Stick it in its face and drill it.
---
Don't get how everyone is so incredulous, the games poor performance and instability is still leagues above other titles. It's past alone is reason to at least give op the benifit of the doubt surely.
---
50 cal but neither are that good
---
So far I have two toons:
---
main(Andrew) is level 266 full health melee/heavy gunner, 
---
alt(Betty) is level 200 low health rifleman/commando
---
This one is different than the rest - it looks like it was chewed on by a yao guai..
---
no doubt.  It takes 5 seconds to unlock a door or remove a wall so people can access the drum yet I just called a petty tryhard griefer by some random in this thread, lol.
---
They need to do some amount of damage but after that targeting the adds is good
---
I’ll keep trying at Whitespring. Got myself an Extra Claw Deathclaw gauntlet which is doing me really well so far
---
still gotta farm the mats, that's the point, a nuke run is a resource drain, and this troll is trying to tell me otherwise
---
This. I like that perk.

Is bugged, is Bethesda
---
Pretty much every thread gets down voted immediately. There's an autodownvote bot, I think.
---
I want my damn David S. Pumpkins matching suit.
---
“Worth” is a funny word. I won’t charge more than 10K for anything personally. Those 100k items are extremely overpriced and refuse to support that lol
---
Edit: for example I sold a bloodied explosive revolver (yes I know it’s only a revolver but still..) for 4k
---
Interesting, because just had 12 on me.
---
I’d be into a kitchen table that could hold a moldy food, plastic spoon and nuke cola, for sure.
---
A better option would be furniture sets that come prestocked with items, but are static pieces that behave like standard tables and shelves. A cupboard full of boxed food, a wooden crate of beer, etc. Even tables cluttered with dishes and glassware on top of a stained gingham tablecloth would be great.
---
Well if you got a explosive gatling plasma for 10k I would gladly take that off your hands, or any legacy weapons for that matter
---
That’s so dumb. Do you happen to know if they ever acknowledged it or said they will fix it soon?
---
(I know there are many other bugs that need fixing)
---
Thanks for your info!
---
oh, I totally misunderstood. you're right!
---
I don’t think so it’s probably too small bug
---
I knew that - was just trying to lighten the mood, gotta grab comedy wherever you find it  😀
---
i had no idea that was a thing I got to remember that
---
I have a hard time parting with my explosive laser pistol but the idea of selling for more caps than I can hold is absurd. I don’t need to max out each character I have with one trade. That’s dumb.
---
Would be cool if berry tats highlighted corpses for  some time with different color
---
Man you are dumb
---
He's griefing.  That's what blocking people from access to parts of the game is.
---
No, need scrap ultracite gatling laser.
---
Plans is drop for events for example.
---
we tried  expert for the first time today,since we complete standard with 3-4 minutes left now.
---
Our roles are exactly the same as yours but we hardly ever find more than 2 codes and we understood that 4 codes are mandatory.
---
Pipes in expert are just placebo. It takes just as much time to reach them as the time they give you,but they still must be done.  
---
i think finding all codes would be a win for us.
---
At the reactor we also have 1 that calls the errors and 2 dedicated to them. Do you think the caller should also do a error or it's best if one of the 2 does 2 errors by himself?
---
It's like we know it's coming...we can avoid it  but like lemmings we walk to the cliff and then step off lol
---
you don’t want a veil between an imaginary world and the real one, dad? or do you just not like my opinion papa? .. lol pleb
---
It sounds like you need two things.
---
-You need to move your camp.
---
-You need to start paying for a proper connection speed.
---
How so? You believe in supporting hyper inflation?
---
Budget.
---
oh shit I had no idea you get script for the prime meat
---
Ultracite Gatling plan is a drop from cranberry bog events, you have to scrap to learn , Watoga Station has 3 barrel mod plans
---
Alright, thanks. Do you know which events have the best drop rate for the plan?
---
Mee too.
---
But, you can build radio's that play Fallout radio in your camp (Unfairness it only seems to work half the time.)  So, they have the rights and ability.
---
Request still open for anyone playing now. I have 2 left
---
How is it not working for you? I crafted 3k Ultracite .50 today on PC without issues. Maybe you hit the button to show only craftable ammo and you don't have ingredients for ultracite ammo?
---
I've always said during events, enemies loot should follow the team system. Which is that so long as you are nearby the enemy when it dies, you can loot the corpse the same as if you killed it, minus the xp of course.
---
So what is better dps wise? Up to now the 50 cal was daddy...
---
This a little cool bug that happens with unyielding armor.  I think i read before that it has to do with dying while unyielding and over encumbered.  It also happened to me once or twice when i used unyielding.
---
Thanks dude! I checked the vendor but only got 1 barrel mod
---
Who sits down and THEN closes a portable toilet door?
---
Or you listen to what everyone has already said and stop asking the same question over and over.
---
One more thing to add "F***face" is a name Codsworth can actually say in Fallout4.
---
Well by nature humans are lazy and selfish. If the system promises free stuff, nobody will move a finger unless they enjoy doing that
---
Wrong. I've personally nuked the forest. Arktos and Helvetia to be precise. Have YOU ever launched a nuke??
---
I've launched hundreds.
---
Nuking really does not suck up a lot of aid or resources if you are geared for it. A decent (and easy to achieve) launch time is less than 15 minutes. I have a set of troubleshooters armor just for the silo.  I barely have to use stims, and dont use many even when I am in my regular armor. I also use sneak melee, so no ammo. It's really about your build style. If someone doesnt have a high dps build, isnt familiar with the silo, and/or doesnt have good armor...it could definitely be a resource sink.
---
I think I read somewhere that FEV really does a number on stair strength. 😉
---
...that's considered a play style choice.
---
Yes
---
Guys..you should check my post on this last week, I took some flak for it but I stand by my thoughts..I rocked up and low levels were doing Jack shit but hiding in v9 lol. When I last checked only scorched can get in there and some insects so there was me and a few others dying upstairs fighting sbq and nasties and those cowards just turned up to the fight with no intention to battle..just get a tag and run and let us do the work.
---
Think you can only use .45 and .38 ammo on it could be wrong on that though
---
Fuckem. And may I humbly suggest Oribal Strike Beacons.
---
Nooo! I don't want cookie cutter, flat packed boring pre fabricated kitchens! 
---
Let me build! Let me design my own home! Let me be free to build a wall out of toilet paper! Even of it does take up 20% of my budget.
---
I maybe use 2 stimpaks [if that] in an entire silo run. I think you're doing it wrong,lol.
---
You definitely see a lot of success stories come out of glass half empty personalities.
---
This is a thing in Elder Scrolls Online.
---
Bloodied or Junkie's with explosive or 25% faster fire (they're about equal - if you're commando, the 25FFR wins, plus it saves perks. The explosive gives you AoE). 
---
The AA is wonderful here, and the 50% crit makes it incredible for a VATS build.
---
Maybe you're right.....it might be god tier :)
---
Right? You just shit there, door open, telling the line "wait your turn" over and over.
---
Monsters are much weaker in f76. I don't think casadors will be as much scary as they are in nv
---
There were only 3 of us doing it earlier and about the only way to beat it was everyone horde the meats and greens until the last 45 seconds
---
You have heard of mutations,RIGHT? Like healing factor for instance??
---
Add the adrenal reaction mutation if you go for low health, then go find some sweet Bloodied weapons. My Bloodied commando build can solo almost any event, and I rarely die.
---
I think you need to satisfy that urge with a different game, friend. 
---
Or, hear me out.......go outside and pick up woodworking as a hobby.  I know it’s nuts, but some people actually make their own furniture.
---
Sculpture, painting, interior decorating and textile arts are also options.
---
Late post, but I've been playing a little bit today. I normally just hide as long as I can and I'm at about 1500 after about 6 or so matches. Not too hard to get the VTU prizes, but I'm also only Overseer rank 3 so
---
I'm glad I could help!
---
If they weren't there you would be in the same situation, so how are they hurting you?
---
now I just need to figure out how to make them last long as I do not have the salt perk lol
---
Pretty sure i have one in my vendor
---
How is it hyper inflation? A legacy rifle should be worth more than a tse pipe rifle
---
Bitch to Bethesda about it.  If we could move our camps with more than a single anchor point we would but till they fix it, fuck immersion.  Is it immersive for this game to crash every fucking time I try to launch a nuke?    3 times in a god damn row now.  Less that 5 minutes from the end.   I keep saying I'll quit but I'm so pissed that it won't let me finish the game. I refuse to quit till I do this god damn it.  I want to play it, but it makes it so hard!  If our real nuclear arsonal (in the United States of America) was as shitty as Bethesdas, we would all be speaking Chinese today.  (In keeping with the great war lore)
---
Perhaps you’ve scrapped a few and learned them already 🙃🤞
---
Yeah sometimes u load in and its even less then a minute before deploy. Like they should make it so u can organize ur cards and pick new ones with points during the stale period after you die and before the match ends.
---
Just here to be comment 666
---
50cal is still better
---
Because noob..the more players there, the harder the event and how are they hurting me? Jesus they aint keeping nasties off our backs lol
---
Already got them that day I posted it :p
---
Thank you for your input tho
---
It's kinda hard to explain but you have to do it in this order
---
\-Defensive stair / snap wall to it / add 2 flat roofs / attach wall to other end / remove first roof attached to stair and first wall / remove first wall / remove stair / replace roof/ replace first wall / remove roofs and second wall.
---
The current system is a breeding ground for distrust and toxic behavior , in a game which is trying to get people to group its kind of baffling it has not been addressed already
---
I pray to the Old God's and the New every day in hope.  
---
I also hope they have some new apparel and camp items for fall/Halloween.
---
Its easy to take and run
---
It’s RNG. Sometimes you get lucky, sometimes you don’t. The other day I had nothing but swing speed drop on melee weapons.
---
I'll UPvote this though. Made me laugh.
---
I have an instagaiting fire axe that you could use (i am on ps4 btw) but it is lvl 50 1*
---
Worth more yes. Worth more than 3 characters can even hold? No
---
Saga update. Ban upheld after requesting review.  24 hour ban on any changes to picture and name. Avatar of Rick and Morty removed lol. I guess it's time to give up on this one. I'll look for a new name here in the forum, lots of good suggestions ;)
---
&gt; you won't have all the plans your main has or blueprints won't carry over
---
That's one reason, right there. Plus, I've had a couple of instances where I put something down, like a staircase for instance, then I can't freaking remove it without taking apart the entire build! A sandbox area, would be good for people to learn to build from other people, without having to worry about getting shot at.
---
Not if you use trade window
---
They saw it differently, but it was worth trying. Thanks
---
Interesting. I know that I've tackled the event with only four people a few times now, and we succeeded each with time left to spare. My advice is  remember to bring chally feed and to communicate (if possible) and you can actually get it done pretty quick.
---
You get two thumbs up from me. All great ideas. 
---
Surprised Bethesda never implemented an easier way to find the bodies of enemies you have killed.
---
They don't bother me, but I don't use them.  
---
I have one of the "open doll house" camps.
---
I can shoot underwater enemies just fine with a ffr handmade. I think explosive ammo negates the ability for the projectile to pass through water, as it explodes as soon as it hits the surface. Normal bullets don’t do this. My handmade works fine, but my explosive hunting rifle doesn’t.
---
Agree and disagree...  example. My charisma allows me to share a 2* card all the time and a 3* with right cards played by others. 
---
So running solo I can have a 3* but if teamed I can only share a 2*
---
I’m not a fan of duplicates after maxing but it has worked out a few times. 
---
Maybe we could trade cards in like a card exchange purveyor?
---
That’s why I’m agreeing, it’s easy in the current system to run
---
BTW, I don't think I complemented your build, but great job! And thanks for the tips - I went looking on Youtube for this technique aand I think this is what you might be describing?  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zD-dkVIElXI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zD-dkVIElXI)
---
Thanks, appreciate the rare positivity
---
No, if only because that will end up devaluing things due to new players not knowing the real worth of something and aiming to undercut people.
---
Would love to be able to sell things from my inventory while I'm offline.
---
You can get a 38 receiver for it and most people give that away...lol
---
I’ve accepted my CAMP’s fate and just use disease cure when I get parasites or I fast travel to a place near by.  But like I said to someone else responding to a different issue of mine, I shouldn’t have to use a work around or move my camp for something that seems like should be a feature in the game.  There’s a CAMP building system in which you can fast travel to your camp. Doesn’t it seem logical to simply NOT allow players to spawn in hazardous locations?  Or maybe have a reproducible fast travel spot based on proximity from the CAMP robot, so you can just set it up to not cause you or your guests disease.
---
I highly doubt improving my internet speed will do anything, as every other game that I play runs perfectly fine without issue.  I honestly can’t tell if you’re serious about this one, though.  Fallout 76 is KNOWN for being an extremely buggy game even for people who play on top end PCs and with good connection.
---
Move your camp if you’re having frequent problems with nearby water and enemies. It’s an easy fix.
---
I said "most of the forest" you fucking moron.
---
I mean the capitalist in me cringed when typing this. However, it would make grinding a lot more fun.
---
I disagree. I like the random element, plus it can be useful as you evolve. For instance, one of my characters was concentrated fire 3 and had to drop to concentrated fire 2 when he decided to be able to open locks. Since I had the cards, I could do it. Gives you some welcome flexibility. I felt your way when I started, but now I like things the way they are.
---
Well I put a ticket in. Prob nothing will happen but maybe if enough people put in tickets they’ll fix it? Seems like a base feature like a special stat should work properly
---
Student loans are the most expensive baby I need!
---
For what?
---
But say, if you have no weapons for sale, but you have some in your "storage" (for whatever reason) - as long as that specific machine isn't powered up, its numbers won't effect display numbers, so you'll still display 0 weapons.
---
Right!?? That's why I love their system. Log on after a 12hr shift to have like 5k caps.
---
Shit like this is why people get burned out on this game after a while. Fun game until you just can't take the bugs anymore.
---
Oh yeah, just thought I'd pipe in for anyone else doing the grind right now. I'm doing a match or two in between meat-cooks.
---
Ya would love that too it would work like Trade venders on ESO
---
Y'all are reading my mind rn.
---
I bought a bloodied western for 1000. My gunslinger collects them. Price is what you decide to pay for things.
---
System?
---
You know something, this game has actually made me interested in things I otherwise would never have thought about. Interior design, cooking, alcohol brewing, lock picking, I've actually bought a lock pick set and my girlfriend bought me the vault dwellers cookbook! Just need a home brew kit now!
---
I still want to be able to express myself in the game though, and I wouldn't suggest this if I didn't think it was possible.
---
You ever get the ghouls sliding across the ground at whitesprings? Or blue screens every now and then? Black screens sometimes when fast traveling that can only be fixed by closing the application? Swapping weapons quickly to secondary and then back to have the clip empty? Sharing a card while on a team then have it automatically stop sharing 3-5 times in a row? The xp bar never goes away, it will stay visible even when not killing anything until you restart the game? Those are just a few things I’ve encountered but I still love the game lol. Very annoying though idk if it’s just me
---
Which food has endurance? Never tried with a food that has that stat. Just HP buffs such as bufftats
---
That kind of shit (not getting a reward for a completed event for whatever reason)  happens all the time lmaoo
---
The tall grass thing can be annoying, but it makes sense. Fencing makes less sense, but we’re operating with vacuum tube, wrist mounted targeting technology. I don’t expect much. Just shoot at it without vats.
---
Honestly most helpful thing I’ve been told about it since hearing it existed, thanks &lt;3
---
I reckon by the time I’ve hit 50 I will have found something similar or better tbh (I’m doing a LOT of grinding at Whitesprings) but thanks for the offer!
---
I am sending a request now, PSN is same as on here minus the underscores
---
Level only means they arent doing the most damage using the same weapon at max. Any damage is still useful damage.
---
Because again the queen doesnt scale with players.
---
Yeah, I think the OP was just making a playful reference to the game encouraging good and decent patriots to engage in some Marxist activity.
---
Good idea. I’ll have to try it out later. I did notice today that the spawns were slower, to the point of failing an event with three players over level 100, just because nothing was showing up. We could put down whatever showed up in seconds, but the waiting killed the event.
---
I found a Instigating Lever action rifle today on a player vending machine. Tweaked up a bit and with my perks, indeed now all the head shots are &gt;2K. Not bad!
---
Oh same, msg me @CallMeCamer0n if you wanna play sometime. But my mic currently broken though
---
I love Decoy. He does it a bit differently then me but similar concept. I like mine because you can place the walls exactly how you want them by positioning the stair where you want it. It's a few more steps but once you have the pattern down it's actually very easy. I found it in a YouTube video like 10 months ago that I haven't been able to find again. I think the guy took it down or privated it.
---
Also thank you very much.
---
It  is an acquired taste. I tried it, but it does not suit my idea of apocalypse. The game stops being fun when you are invisible and hit strong enough to one-shoot the level 80 scorchbeast which lives in the cave where Taggerdy died. No challenge at all. Something stops working when you become God Punch.
---
should see mine :P
---
Exactly.  There are many aspects of the game that I enjoy, but I feel like there’s so many small things wrong with that hinder an otherwise pretty good game.

Depends on how much time for earning 10 cents worth of atoms is to you.  If I see anything that requires more than one step or I don’t have the materials or circumstances to make the challenge happen, I just log back off.  Time is a precious commodity in my reality.  
---
Now with that being said, I’m more willing to invest in a 30 atom challenge than a 10 atom challenge because they are typically on the weekly list, and if I’m short on time, I know I can start the challenge and finish it later in the week.
---
It's not, my name on PC is Enzth in game.
---
Oh, how about you FT to grahms cookout, hop out of your fully modded power armor and it disappears.  Gone forever. Didn’t even get the chassis.
---
Indeed! Maybe we'll get something like that in the Wastelanders update. But I'm not holding my breath.
---
Are any non-subscription service games set up this way though? I'd be surprised if they did this since it seems like it would incentive people to spend less time in-game.
---
That’s the literal definition of insanity - doing the same thing repeatedly and expecting different results. 
---
Please stop
---
Well it has to do with how much service they buy in the cloud. If what they have purchased is not able to keep up then you need to buy more space in the cloud to run more.   More is more. You want more power and capability buy more space in the cloud. You buy more computing power from AWS, AWS allocates more physical servers in racks in a building for Bethesda. That is how it works.
---
Just having a little fun, pointing out the superficial irony that a game full of (tongue in cheek) anti-Communist commentary is also having you act out a literal interpretation of the most famous Communist dictum. Crack a Pickaxe and chill, my good comrade.
---
healing factor only works when every other enemy is dead, everyone uses at least some stims on that run, other aid as well to boost dmg and hp, silo runs are a drain on resources

When I was low level, I would do that, but after crippling her wings, to make sure I had fucked her a bit. It is More fun, also.

Now I've finished it with 2 random partners, it was pretty intense and fun, but the reward was a joke, one legendary enemey which had nothing worth writing home about...
---
Does it fire two full rounds of flechette?  Or just one extra, like the shotgun?
---
Fantastic job on this. Needs to be more creative people out there in the wastes.
---
I have a 100mbs connection speed. I’ve never had the spawn/lag issues you mention. My computer is good, but not incredible. I’m playing the exact same game as you. I don’t have some super secret version where all the bugs are fixed. With the game being identical, that only leaves connectivity in question.
---
Np thx for the chat m8 😁 👍
---
Well... some don't want to dish out the $20 to get their rejudices killed :)
---
I don't think it matters.
---
Again... that’s not how it works..
---
I hate it too but it's born from issues with the game itself. Were it not so hard to place down blueprints in the first place, we'd probably only see single staircase homes as just memes, not the norm.
---
YES, YES, YES, YES, YES, YES, YES, YES, YES, YES, YES, YES, YES, YES, PLEASE
---
wait for wastelanders
---
If you have a question about something, please put the question **in the title**. Reddit does not make it possible to edit titles, so you will have to post again with a LONGER, MORE DESCRIPTIVE TITLE. Once again, MAKE A TITLE WHICH IS LONGER AND MORE DESCRIPTIVE.
---
So, you want a troll emote?
---
Yea I’m on a high end pc with probably one of the best internet services in the country and had similar issues when I played, which is why I’ve completely lost interest and stopped.
---
Alot of thoes on YT eather never played ever and just go off word of mouth from other Youtubers or they havent played since beta and enjoy shitting on 76 and other titles betheda puts out
---
And yet this is the only game that gives me trouble, the amount of bugs in the game is a well-known issue in the community, and many of my complaints can’t be explained by connection issues (Example: scorched earth not giving rewards to me and the 8 other people doing the even with me despite killing the queen with 10 seconds left [guess all 8 of their connections were also shit].  Or the CAMP issues are not connection, just oversights that could have been prevented with a little thinking from the devs)
---
Sounds good, you got any pics?
---
The whole shitting on Bethesda part is what amuses me the most because I guarantee those fuckers will be buying TES6 the second its available.
---
What part is not how it works then? That they buy space on cloud and what they buy is limited to the amount of money they spend? Because it is, and if they spend more they get more.
---
Yeah man this game is amazing
---
Not from me dude. I’m here for honest, good faith conversations. I appreciate your views.
---
That’s really cool to hear. They keep adding more functionality to camps, so who knows what we’ll have next year.
---
No worries 👍
---
It dont matter i tested it earlyer it actualy depends how fast a server is running as in the more lag a sever has the slower things will spawn
---
Even just a throwback to how it was in FO4, it wasnt perfect by far there but so much more freedom than what we have now
---
Enemies don’t spawn every time you fast travel to camp though.
---
And for everyone who likes their build it's pretty annoying to have to sort through 20 extra card that weel never use. If they arent guna do anything about duplicates then we could at least be able to organize all the clutter. Or even better just give us perk loadouts like we've been begging for
---
What does DAE mean?
---
More less but with bethesda going micro transaction happy since FO4 and skyrim what makes them think elder scrolls 6 will be any diffrent
---
Dunno
---
Why is every new bit of content they add to the game severely underwhelming? Why were endgame raids dead after a week because they sucked so bad? Why is there nothing to do at endgame?
---
Why are 90% of new outfits and decorations added to the atom store instead of the actual game? Why is everything in a bundle that costs more than an actual full game?
---
Agreed. I thought this was a Fallout game not a building Sim. Lack of content/over abundance of cosmetics.
---
Only thing I agree with is hit detection/health regenerating bug. Other things I prefer them the way they are now.
---
I doubt that after the overall reaction to the CC for F4 and Skyrim I doubt that they’d want to repeat history, with F76 that’s an exception seeing as it’s a online game and the revenue made from the atom shop funds the updates.
---
No.... it’s not. Read up on how AWS works. It scales up and down based on what you need. 
---
There problem isn’t capacity. Anyway this conversation is going nowhere. Do some reading. “Buying more servers” isn’t the problem here.
---
I’m not complaining about the game dude - I love the game. Been in since Beta. 
---
Read the post again.
---
I must say, your comment is super petty
---
Maybe wendigo cave. Of course the times I've been in there is for the quest but I usually got to get past 2 kings.
---
I know i cant be the only Whale paying into 76 js.
---
No the problem is that im looking to tame one and it can only be random spawn
---
I didn’t say server performance. Good try though
---
I don’t have either of these issues (at least not persistently). The legendary text thing occasionally.
---
I've tried this trick and it did not work for us. Progress bar jumped only past the chicken leg sadly.
---
Theyre always at the trainyard down by the bog.  Usually three of them there.
---
Scrip it out. Level 5 legendary is trash.
---
They’re a business plain and simple that’s why a large chunk of the cosmetics are ATX exclusive, now I don’t like it but at least there’s a free way to earn atoms, many people I know haven’t spent a dime past their initial investment. 
---
As for the quality of the content that’s another issue entirely, my main point is that while the game isn’t perfect it’s nowhere near the levels of bad that the vast majority of the internet perceive it to be.
---
Well since you burn the meat (progress bar) up over time it's best for one or 2 people to hoard a bunch to turn in and just finish the event in 2 clicks while everyone else does little incraments. I know I sorta just hold the event in my hands when I grab all the greens.
---
i dont think they get it either
---
I know but im tryng to tame one and only can be by random spawn
---
Dunno. 
---
I brought this for player content and some sort purpose other than camp building and getting that “pretty hat” in the atomic store. 300 hours was more than enough time for me to realize welp that’s it, I’ll be back when there’s something else worth doing that’s added and not bugged to Hell.
---
Wait - in what way am I a twat?
---
Can't scrap legendarys ....choices scrip it, sell it  or donate to low level
---
They’ve literally said it every time some one asks. What is wrong with this player base?
---
Oh whenever Ive been there they always spawn in never random there.
---
At the cranberry bog event the enemies spawn pretty far away and end up attacking other spawns in the area. Bloodied melee build , I kill the prime fog crawlers in one hit. My time is spent running towards them to beat the clock not actually kill them. It’s do able solo but it’s definitely harder then last mest week. Also I found there were more three star legendary spawns at events then this time.
---
Scrip it, or put it in your vending machine for cheap so that some other low level can make use of it
---
At this point the only quasi-legendary things that you can level up are some special quest items, like the Mistress of Mysteries items
---
Also the thing is that they need to be one only alone to be tamed but thanks for the help tho
---
I guess it depends from player to player really, personally the raids don’t interest me yet I massively enjoy the camp building and open world exploration. Got roughly 400 hours and I’m still enjoying the game although that may be because I enjoy grindy games in general.
---
Bruuuh that reminds me (i know this is slightly different) of when the game first came out and I (and many others) basically couldn’t use power armor for like a month because you couldn’t get out of it due to a glitch
---
I did mean scrapped junk it's just that I also got so attached to my collection it started causing anxiety and was preventing me from even playing, so I just said damn it! and dropped and sold everything and started again.
---
It really was quite refreshing, now if there is something specific I want to do I go out and scavenge for it.
---
There are of course certain mats that are harder to collect like screws, some pure flux I have, ballistic fibre for my armor, but everything else can be found so quickly.
---
Super constructive - thanks for the input - your time was used wisely.
---
Cant you just kill the other two then tame the last one standing?  Coukd be a deathmatch tame session!
---
Best way to get ultracite plans is scorched earth i helped in killing the queen 3 times last night and got alot of Ultracite plans
---
Mirelurk kings have a very low spawn rate at random encounters you will find 10 deathclaw and 10 sloths before you find one king unless rngesus is on your side
---
It’s not an attack - you just have a shit camp dude. Pretty sure you can do better.
---
Its called a feature report.
---
No that would me funny but it doesn’t work like that. Taming has a lot of rules and the alone-spawn is one of em
---
What's worse is when you are chilling in a camp like that and they log out so you just end up falling to your death.
---
After reading the angry, negative and abusive responses for the “floating camp builders” I’ve changed my stance - Nuke away my dude....nuke away.
---
*stock not receiver.
---
Of course I’ve had a server crap out on me, but it’s not a regular occurrence like you seem to be having. If I’m on a server that’s clearly old or having trouble, I switch to a good one. I’m not going to dive into a bad situation and get mad when things don’t go my way. Sometimes the server boots me when my nuke hits, even though it seemed fine. I move on and launch another one on a new server. It takes 15-20 minutes, and time is clearly not at a premium if I’m playing a video game. It just doesn’t annoy me enough to write up a rant list and argue with every constructive response I get. 
---
Look at every response you’ve made to every comment in this thread.
---
Yeah i have found really a LOT of those and they kind of became even annoying
---
*spends 14 hours on a camp* 
---
*Camp gets called shit cuz it's high up*
---
i would say keep the QOL stuff from FO76 but just remove the restriction from floating objects/
---
Oh ok I wasnt aware of that.  I have yet to go tame something.  Hopefully someone else will help.  Ive been at two camps whom had the purple king as their friend so far.
---
You can still do that now but its only one type
---
I’ve been a MMORPH player for most of my life so I’m used to the grinding (WoW was the first and I’ve been on ESO since beta)but what am I really grinding for? Games of the that nature had you grinding for a purpose like endgame gear for raids and such. What’s the endgame here? Also, got real tired of server crashes, especially while silo clearing.
---
Because people are people, and controversy is more click-bait interesting than "Gee, I had fun"
---
That and folks can easily get off on stroking their digital Id by creating drama around a non-dramatic context.
---
Here's the stupidest issue if you think about it, get the most super uber weapon possible that can 1 shot everything in existence and then when there are events you have to downgrade to a lvl 5 slingshot so other people don't get pissed at missing out on loot.
---
Thanks for trying to help tho
---
Plus a random hammer strapped to it.
---
holy \*\*\*\* how did you manage this?
---
Anytime friend.
---
When u have your pip  open and it fades , on Xbox u push the select button to ‘change the view’ /. It gives u the power armour type view with solid graphics
---
Give it to a low level 5... tell them once they get a better to pay it forward and give it to someone else...
---
I got the plan last night x2 from 3 SBQ battles
---
I've memorized where all the greens are and swoop them all up in the first minute. Then I do the other random stuff like fires and trash and poop scooping. I also kill tons of critters. I don't wait until the "end" based on the clock. I wait until the progress starts to look good and then I dump everything at once, and it finishes the event almost every time. Sometimes there are 2 or 3 minutes left. Waiting is important because if you dump all the greens and it doesn't finish, it might not finish at all then you only get meat cleavers. :/
---
Be careful about switching to 38 receiver as that  removes the benefit of commando I believe, it only applies to automatic rifles and the and you must mod it to benefit from the commando perks. ie powerful automatic, tweaked etc. As for other perks, tank killer, first level adrenaline, Im sure there are more.
---
Lol. Did you not realize they fixed it?
---
Seen to usually be in the south where the Queen spawns all the time along with uncanny caverns...
---
So you proceed to not prove your statement and then make a generalized attack on “the player base” when your issue is just with an individual or a few individuals (me and OP). I don’t know where to go from here tbh.
---
Thank you too kind! :)
---
Are you on PC on a minimum spec system? Cause a lot of what you're describing can be caused by that. Try turning your graphics settings down all the way and see if it doesn't fix most of that. If you're on console try getting an external SSD to install the game on if you don't already have one. It makes a huge difference on Xbox.
---
Anyone else getting frustrated with the fucking Yao Guais? I'm level 180+, and I get torn to shreds by a level 60 Yoa Guai.
---
No, I tried it.
---
That makes perfect sense. Thank you.
---
*Yao Guai
---
Got one on Xbox if you want it for free
---
It’s not with just you and him and I wasn’t trying to provide proof. I’m not gonna provide proof when you can practically look left and find the answer.
---
Rose is the best example of what a good NPC should be and act like. Hopefully they craft the coming npcs like her.
---
I’ve played both pretty extensively so I understand where you’re coming from, ideally I think that they need to expand on the nuke system more to give each region its own unique boss battle similar to the SBQ with their own respective rewards and maybe some unique cosmetics added to the loot table. I’m very active on the trading sub so that’s my main focus when playing this game as well as the other two, grinding for stuff that I can then sell, plus the social aspect makes it a lot more engaging than doing a vault raid with four mute randoms.
---
100% agree
---
I think it’s the timer. Honestly I’ve been in so many where the timer runs out and nobody gets their prime meat. If people wait around so everyone can tag normal mobs we would fail constantly. Now- I DO thing people should make sure to let everyone tag legendary at the end and also give it time to mutate as sometimes it will “turn legendary”.
---
Legend! You sure you want to just give it though?
---
Haters are like ex’s complaining daily on how bad their ex is and will never amount to anything good... yet they can’t stop talking about them...haha! 
---
I’ve e been playing since the beta and no plans on leaving the game! It’s improved drastically since it’s release and continues to improve. 
---
Are there issues? Yes... if it upsets someone so greatly that much maybe they should try and find another game...  pretty easy solution...
---
I use the arms that improve the AP expenditure of power attacks. Kinetic bracers I think. There’s not a lot of good options, but the arms at least contribute to a high overall suit dr. If you wear power armor for defense, excavator is pretty low down the list. T-51b is great for PvE. Excavator is great for mining and hoarding, but not much else IMO.
---
Yea the, the faster you compelled it the more prime meat when really it’s “the harder the area the more prime meat regardless of how much item you have remaining”
---
Twice while playing last night i chucked a grenade and it exploded the second it left my hands. A little frustrating.
---
So basically a more well thought out  version of an auction house? With out the hard bidding.
---
The coolest camp I ever found was floating
---
They somehow managed to build it on the top of the highest rocks in that rocky craggy area of the Savage divide, it was pretty legit. Took me like a half hour to get up there, too, since I got rid of my mutations a while back and couldn't jump high enough, lol.
---
It was a pretty standard setup, but the view was phenomenal. Better than Top of the World IMO.
---
I love my easy drop base. Check it out on PS4. crimbotXX HMU.
---
Sometimes it be like that.
---
Yes, I’m arguing my points because some people are invalidating my complaints by giving feedback that boils down to “hue hue just do this and it won’t happen” when I already know how to mitigate the damages myself. 
---
I clearly prefaced in my post that I still enjoy the game and i’d just like to rant a bit about it. I’m not looking for solutions, and I didn’t even say anything like “Plz fix this Bethesda”.
---
You get 1 scrip for 1 prime meat in batches of 5 and a max of 15 per cookout event. 
---
So if you have 15 meats, drop them on the grill 3 times during the event for a total of 15 scrip. But if you only have 9 meat, you can only drop 5 and get 5 scrip. And if you have 4 or less meat, no scrip for you.
---
Delay main quest (after flatwoods) as long as you can. Explore a lot- sticking to western side of the map for awhile. Take time leveling up. If enemies are too tough, need to level up/ upgrade perks.
---
Well they mentioned in a recent inside the vault that they’re changing it so you no longer have to tag legendaries event enemies in order to be able to loot to get a drop which is going to be really convenient as personally it bugs me whenever someone just one shots an event boss in stealth as soon as it spawns.
---
Yeah no problem, if you want just throw me any 5mm or mininukes, most people don’t use them.  I’m 90% sure I’ve got the plan I’ll let you know within an hour.
---
Unless you are level 5-10
---
Yeah for people who hate the game so much and don’t care about it they surely like to talk about it a lot.
---
I akways had the amber color. Brings me back to New Vegas. When I saw that you could do it in 4, I smiled. Wish it was possible in 76.
---
I’ve been saying this for awhile about adding more ammo conversions to the combat rifle and even assault rifles. 
---
Combat rifle: .38, .45, 5.56, 5mm, .308, .50
---
Assault rifle: 5.56, 5mm, .50
---
Adds on new options and shakes up the meta on rifles.
---
There's nothing in the game that makes it worth playing. That hasn't changed since beta.
---
Maybe wastelanders will turn things around but the odds are against it.
---
Every single major addition has been underwhelming or just broken. They had ample time to turn things around and chose not to invest in the game.
---
B3 has completely killed my friends list, the hardest challenges now involve being in a group.
---
All finished, thanks! Feel free to leave team if you would like, otherwise I will be getting off in just over an hour. Thanks again!
---
I think I must not be understanding what you mean, because items in your stashes don't count on your vendor at all. Only IN vending machines count, and you only need to have one powered up to show up on the map.
---
Yeah same not sure why it's not possible though
---
At least your criticism is informed, the op is stating most are regurgitating talking points from 2018.
---
And for the most part, I’m getting exactly what I wanted out of the post: other people bitching about their problems that they’ve experienced.
---
I work in the tech industry brother. You buy a service  from Amazon, Microsoft, Dell it dont matter its all the same floor plan housed in a big gray buiding with a bunch of servers in it. Rows after row of racks with blades and LEDs. Depending how much money you dump in will determine how much of those server service you. That IS the business. You spend more you get to use more of them. So yes if they say the servers can not handle the load then is time to buy more space to distribute the load over more devices. Yes it scales up and down as need calls right now, but guess what? It can only scale up as much as they have purchased. Think of it like a phone data plan. There's unlimited data in the company, but you purchase 10g of it. Bethesda purchased X amount of data, but they could get the Y or Z plan with more on it too. I can not put it more simpler.
---
Drop it on the ground
---
So I read somewhere here on reddit that in order to get loot from the sbq you need to do a combined total of 300 damage to her during the event. So it would totally be possible to focus on the queen for a short time and then focus on the trash and still get loot.
---
I've not yet met a troll at level 50 so far. Everyone has been sound. If I only head to deal with one asshole every now and then using it that way, I'd still take it.
---
I agree with rework, not with fo4 building. I haaaaated building in fo4. 76 seems much more user friendly.
---
Lol. Reporting as using lone wanderer flair. Not reporting your post for any rule breaking.
---
Have you tried going to the freakshow?
---
I don’t even know how to respond anymore. Just keep doing things the same way because it’s clearly working out great. We’re all plotting against you in a global scheme to deflate your ego. We would have gotten away with it if it weren’t for your pesky meddling.
---
I hope we get content ingame to get uwu
---
Throw it in the overseers stash at the overseers camp. Some low level will probably grab it.
---
I'm not a fan of them most of the time.  When I see most of them all I can think is "great, another floating monstrosity".  There have been one or two I liked, one was built like an airship of some kind, and I think there was another one that looked really cool.
---
I’ll stop spoiling the pity party. Sorry.
---
Ive played 1000 hours. Beth tends to patch all the fun away in my opinion.
---
I won't be on my PS4 for a while, but I'd love some! Trying to fill up my magazine rack and organize it" and I'm also trying to get the trophy for using them, so having some to put in place for the one's I've already used would be awesome!
---
Getting 300 hours from a game is not bad.
---
Absolutely. It sucks she's a robot but it's the closest to a sentient npc the game has to offer.
---
If you let us know which, we can save them for you. The fiance will be on most of the night.
---
Excellent idea. It would be cool to roll up on someone wearing a merchants backpack or a slow pack brahmin loaded with gear.  
---
Maybe even having some sort of questline that's helps you prepare to be a merchant in the wasteland.
---
Lol just had a fun time at prime meat event me and one other high lvl in the forest fighting the enemies during rad storm.
---
I have 3 characters. One of them is rifle/melee, other is stealth commando. Both ~level 120. Third character is for nuclear winter so only around level 20 and has no real build at all lol
---
I know .38 is a reciever, and maybe .308 too?
---
So no one would ever visit people’s camps?
---
You'd hate mine then, it's about three levels of floating floors with stuff on them. Because I can't afford walls AND display cases.
---
Exactly so they down vote my comment since it hurts their feelings because it’s true...lol
---
This is the right move. You can go to thier general discussion pages and see what bugs they are working on. I run a super low endurance and I never knew that. Could be why 1 otherwise great armor isn't selling. Putting in tickets is the only way they know. If i had to guess it's cause unyealding armor and the way they codded it to not boost endurance. Prob
---
I don’t understand the offense you’re taking to me wanting to bitch about the issues of the game.  People rant sometimes, idk what the big deal is.  Am I missing something? Have I offended someone? I’m starting to get confused.
---
How is 40k damage even possible? I can’t get above 2k
---
Sound nice!
---
LOL. Your poor cow.
---
I just find a lvl 68 Scorched to shoot. They all have the same stats, so they act as my test dummies.
---
It's my understanding that an unpowered vendor doesn't effect the display of the advertised numbers on your camp. One powered on *will* make you show up on the map, but the contents of any that *aren't* powered will not display in your numbers when someone scrolls over your camp... I definitely should have used a vending machine instead "storage" - that's my bad.
---
It's been an issue since Fallout 4 so don't hold your breath. Least professional company in the industry.
---
But you're happy that a monster can be pounded by 13,000 explosive rounds, hit with a plethora of melee weapons and orbital strike missiles and still fly of without any sign of damage....yeah, physics 🤦🏻‍♂️🤣
---
That’s my main issue, if you’re going to criticise the game then at least be informed as to what the game is like at this point in time not 11 months ago.
---
Stunning! I love making huge elaborate builds. Mine usually end up as bars or garden manors. 
---
Can I ask where this location is? I love heights because the scenery is so darn good but after running all around the mountain areas of the map twice the only place I like is Seneca rocks. But tbh I'm getting pretty sick of the unreliable spawn points that refuse to change so I'm looking elsewhere.
---
Ok? Do you use AWS “brother”? Again... the server problems are not from being throttled or not having enough bandwidth, storage, etc. Saying you work in the tech industry isn’t exactly a heavy credential if you actually think more servers is the answer lol.
---
Were they in power armor? If so they had the emergency protocols mod.
---
I've got some 5mm spare for ya. Alright bud
---
I just read that legendary enemy loot will be changing for events. Check inside the vault for details though.. I dont remember specifics..
---
I always use the steel beams to create "supports"
---
Fuck alot of us who love decorating need a unlimited budget
---
Not sue why the building mechanics from FO4 aren't introduced in FO76  Apart from foundation stacking (impregnable walls), not sure why there are so many restrictions.
---
I know. I was just making a joke.
---
You're not high level enough.
---
"Budget exists for performance reasons"... weird sounds like you said something about the performance of server not being able to keep up to me. But if you distribute this over more the load could be carried.
---
All their bullshit is shady.
---
Sold us a raider set, came out with a slightly cooler version right after.
---
Same thing with the fridge and scavenger bot.
---
Cooler versions coming later that you'll have to buy again.
---
Are we playing the same game?
---
Because its still feels, looks and plays as a low budget early access game after 10 months. I still cant recommend for any of my friends even when its discounted.
---
Its years from a polished game.
---
I'd be thrilled to get some half walls, but I guess that doesn't make sense since we have half floors and they shouldn't have walls to go with them.
---
SBQ, just got the plans 30 min ago
---
Always say hi to someone you find. A lot of the higher levels are friendly, and know what it was like being a lower level. Whenever I stumble across a lower level, I try to drop something useful for them. If we get along, I'll accompany them to keep them safe, give some spare food when they're in the red, or fix their things when they're too low on materials.
---
You can still have a pet deathclaw? I thought that want possible any more?
---
That happened to me once, after spending like 5k caps on junk and flux's he was selling. It killed me and I landed in an inaccessible spot so I couldnt get them back
---
I was super salty and spent like a week rejoining his game to ruin his west-tek runs, or kill him the second he took a workshop.
---
I dunno.. it's a two shot..?..
---
Seems they've done a few adjustments to the camp pet system. I know awhile ago, deathclaws in particular would attack other players. Mine completely ignores them, even when they try to attack him.
---

---
Prime usually up's the damage and gives a bonus to scorched. Some cases it's not so much so check before you prime.
---
The lmg is the only one i know is good. Damage boost is there and more importantly its much better for ammo crafting. If you've shot that thing you will know why.
---
Oh Lord haha like "reporting for duty". I felt attacked for a moment.
---
For a game that's 'bugged to hell' it didn't seem to stop him from hitting 300 hours.
---
I get what your saying. But that last line about making things easier for bloodied builds is really praising them. It’s borderline entitlement on saying that. And that’s not cool or anything. 
---
Last I looked the event was/is public and requires the help of everyone to fill a role. Saying that bloodied users should receive more cover from other players is worded far too strong. 
---
I’m a non bloodied stealth sniper. And I’ll never be able to output the damage a bloodied user can. But my damage on her Majesty is just as good as theirs and saying I shouldn’t be hitting her is selfish. 
---
I may see those adds come in and with my instigating lever I can and have ohk them or left them alive for others while building vats crits. 
---
You also don’t know know exactly what gear that level 45 or 35 has. 
---
If anything should be done. Scorched Earth should start with a player specific progress bar that fills up as you hit the queen. Once you’ve dealt enough and the bar fills you qualify for looting the queen. If you don’t you can’t. Simple as that. It acts as a goal marker and way to test whether you are ready and able to be down there. If you don’t make the mark you still receive Lott from the event completed and the loot from all the adds but the queen is off limits.

But saying low levels or even low damage players should defend bloodied isn’t the way. Hell my Big Iron Gunslinger was down there at level 40 with naught but a single action revolver (furious, aim damage, was doing fairly  good damage to her and easily doing the lowest damage there still was valid.

Agreed.

I paid $$ for the game aswell and contine to put $$ into it via atom store
---
Mine was like this because its easy to move around. Once I got close to level 100 I was like “ok so we are going to build a good base” and I did. Because I didnt want to move it anymore. Its in.....Im trying to remember.....The mire by Harpers I think its the mire anyway but I can get to prime in two mins if I wanted to fight the sbq so 🤷🏾‍♂️

I completely agree and want this, too. I love playing Sims just for building and decorating a house. I had to change my whole layout just to fit display cases for all the cute items I'm finding, especially all of the bears and Mr Fuzzys.
---
I use to balloons but I think they changed so we cant break our own balloons
---
Your wording... client has zero performance cost? What are you trying to ask here?
---
Its more user friendly in the way that you can only do a handful of things, but even then, I wouldnt say its more user friendly, but at the same time, I have loads of hours of build experience in FO4 and was used to that system and how it worked, like I know a lot of people had troubles with the vault pieces but i found them easy enough to snap together

Stop thinking about servers. It’s not a problem with the servers. Have a goodnight.

Oh I absolutely agree I got fell to my death countless times and got stuck in the structure as it was loading in just as much. It’s actually because of this that I toyed around with the idea of what was controlling the spawn point for fast travels. I feel like the fact that the placement of your actual C.A.M.P. unit controlling the spawn should become more common knowledge so there isn’t as much grief. Still better than the guy who made a CAMP that had a 50% chance to drop you to your death intentionally

With full contractor you need 2 cobalt 1 crimson 3 fluor 1 violet 3 yellow - I have all colours if you need any
---
Or an R.Lee Ermey companion day r camp guard in place of turrets
---
oh, i thought it was a 3 blind mice easter egg
---
Mmm kebabs
---
Is there a counter type of how much damage we did on the SBQ? I always get aimed by her minions. Probably i was always the first one to have impact hit on her n all her minions will tag me from far
---
I’m previous games, I never used power armor. I wanted to do it differently this time. Out of my friends that play, in the only one who uses power armor so I can relate but on the other end of the spectrum. It’s not weird, just a preference and your style of gameplay.

I have a Prime(non-Legendary) LMG that I have used.  Question is, should I buy the Furious LMG and Prime it Too?
---
Oh damn ok so I’m not sure if this still works but if you find him again (either with a friend who hasn’t done it or doing what I did and reloading the quest) you can pickup another one and repair that one instead. I know it worked before the recent patch but not sure if it does now.

And then use a half floor to fill up the other side, was thinking about this to

The best chances are from Census violence. It is normally a 0.2% chance to drop from any bog event, but for some reason its 0.5 from CV.
---
A 15 second invincibility timer actually sounds like a really good and simple idea.
---
No it didn’t. That way I can actually entail what the game offered. Not just give an opinion based on off the cuff bullshit like the YT’s.
---
That weapon you have that you can't see in menus.. is it thee Vox syringer? Cause I have that (and many of the other issues)
---
I use PA 90% of the time out east because I'm no longer a ranger build and the things out east try to kill me.
---
I always make them look more realistic by using metal posts as reinforcement, if i do that, people can’t complain
---
Instead of moaning about your problems, assess what’s wrong, stop being a fucking child and do what you can to fix them. Whining shows weakness and lack of character. There are options to solve at least 80% of your issues, but you seem to be more interested in complaining and listening to yes men as a form of catharsis.

What about MODUS?

You do know how stairs work right? Even if you put them tot he side they still take up the same amount of space.
