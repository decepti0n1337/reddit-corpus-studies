That I can defiantly understand but at least test it. The work around is in your face obvious. Work around videos were up within 1hour of the servers going back up. Heck I think the easiest way to fix it is to make weapons non stackable like they did with the armor. That is unless it works with chems too.
---
---
---
I guarantee people would collect them like crazy
---
Oh this wasn't for pvp, I guess just in general. Seeing as level 91 creatures are being killed in one shot, it can really bring down the challenge that I guess is supposed to be there from the start.
---
I'll forward this to the lab, thank you citizen. üòÄüëç
---
Sorry 15 karma for almost a year, feels like an alt. And yes I'll be accusing mostly because there isn't a full story here. It's very dramatic and definitely could rustle people up. But... I've yet to see multiple accounts of Amazon people having problems. It seems that I have to agree they either bought it from a "key" seller, or used a stolen card, maybe tried to get a refund. There's so many things that could be the case. Posting 2 screen shots of replies doesn't mean anything. There's nothing we can can tell naked any claims legit.
---
Low on stims? Canned dog food, blood packs, and any nuka cola product works great for restoring health, I used to throw them away because the weight, but nuka cola saved me more times than I can remember
---
At first it was melee way is to op, one shot scorched beasts ect, now explosive weapons
---
Those guys are known as the Brotherhood of Steel.
---
I for one would love a tiny mirelurk or feral following me around!
---
One of mine got fucking boonk ganged because I had to place all of them
---
Would be cool, until everyone brings their pets to farm Whitesprings. Goodbye FPS, hello DC.
---
Full auto weapons has one buff that most people don't really look into and that is the anti armor magazine mods you can make. Its really a powerful addition to the wepaon output it does.
---
Shouldn‚Äôt need to be a perk
---
Rip
---
I give it a day or two before duper‚Äôs find another method to dupe items, assumeing one isn‚Äôt already known and kept hidden from the public. If Ark has taught me anything it‚Äôs that you can‚Äôt beat these people.
---
Does your friend play with pacifist enabled? If he doesn't, chances are he may have splash damaged someone accidentally which then flags both of you for PvP.
---
I never investigated it yet, but I'm assuming player vending means you can set up an automated shop?
---
100 caps and 20 plastic and you have a deal.
---
I just wanted to know if you heard anything is all... Thanks man fingers crossed
---
Where did you buy the game from?
---
No you are right this is a good spot near the river with the junk extractor my 2nd toon is on this spot
---
Considering melee can still easily outclass expmpsive weapons, I think they are already balanced. 
---
nukacrypt.com/solved
---

---
Here is a link
---
Melee becomes OP due to build creations, seeing as you have to put yourself in danger to do said damage. Explosive you can fire from a distance and reap the benefits of instantly killing most things.
---
Groovy. Looking forward the new bug it introduces which makes the entire map a nuke zone. ;)
---
Is this just a PC thing? Or are they going to port it onto Xbox/PlayStation? I mean the left stick could be the mouse, the left and right triggers/l&amp;r 2 could me left and right click. Pause is pause(escape key) the left and right bumpers/l&amp;r 1 could be quick safe/load. A, X, B, Y/ Square, Circle, X, Triangle could be player selectable skills along with the road for a total of 8programed hot keys. Atleast this is how I play fallout 1 &amp; 2 there's something about a controller and being able to sit lounge and relax that has always made a game more comfortable for me. 
---
I know that fallout 1 &amp; 2 were originally designed to use KB/M but that's because it was created in an era where controllers were not even invented or were severely over priced. 
---
And fallout 1, 2 and tactics BOS were not even close to be high paced enough to have to be sitting up and actually have full attention on the game because if you even do engage in combat the game waits for you to take a turn and roll your dice so to speak.
---
Even if they do port it over to Xbox and it still requires the player to use KB/M I'll gladly buy a wireless one for my xbox
---
Shoot at the Cyberdemon until it dies.

[removed]
---
Not sure, perhaps I was bugged. Wouldn't be outside of the realm of possibilities with this game.
---
Honestly as long as when i hit inspect on a frame i'd get to see the armour on it, kinda like how you can see the mods on a gun when you inspect it.
---
The data is already attached to the frame just give us the option to see it.
---
GARY 
---
I‚Äôll help ya
---
What‚Äôs your gt?
---
They are gonna release more details about what they have in store for that soon, but for now all I can assume is that is probably what its gonna be.
---
And we know how much battleragers HATE baths. XD
---
Well, you could only have one out at a time - like a equitable item. And that is a good counter I must say... I guess:
---
"Your pet is too scared to enter this blast zone"
---
[Mini-scorchbeast has be un-equipted]
---
Yeah... Doesn't make much sense at all. Well, here's to hoping someone at Bethesda can make it happen. 
---
Exactly what everyone who likes this wants. Let‚Äôs just hope it gets implemented 
---
Your crying about something that they didn't even try to fix. Delete your post.
---
My build is working really well granted I have a TSE handmade and only level 46 so my build is not complete 
---
Here is mine it‚Äôs a stealth rifle build don‚Äôt need mutations unless you have an explosive gun you will want marsupial so you can jump up if they get to close. You also need chemelion armor

Except Rockstar made an award winning game that will likely be remembered forever. Where Bethesda made a piss poor optimized Fallout game with half the charm of previous installments, and a clusterfuck of idead not properly melded into one horrible game.
---
Same GT as my reddit user :)
---
Isn't the meaning of a hot fix to deploy a patch/fix while the servers are live? 
---
Well ghouls always drop lots of chems for me everywhere, but you're still right. There is a dude in a bedroom on the second floor of one of the houses, laid out on a bed full of chems with his head hanging over the edge, puking into a trash can. 
---
Stop right there criminal scum!
---
You are correct. All the sites do is suck Rockstar‚Äôs dick. 
---
Has anyone seen any high powered silenced 9mm? I'm slumming it with a silenced pipe .308 over here...
---
There's the bear faced follow every step way and the use terminals way. You can start by running in and going straight for the biometric scanner&gt; find a card&gt; erase card and synch bio data&gt; scan new card&gt; done with first area
---
Run through the hallway to the rad repair zone. In the room on the right of the hallway is a terminal, use it to turn off the turrets. Don't go through the decontamination arches, turn around and go into the opposite room&gt; hack&gt; security override to open first bulkheads (skips the repair part)
---
Navigate to the break the mainframe cores part, explosives help keep an eye out for terminals and keep deactivating turrets.
---
This normally turns a 25 minute solo run into a 15 minute run.
---
Side note- no matter where you might fail in the nuke silos, they are unfailable. Kinda sucks but as long as you kill stuff, you'll make it through had solid take me over an hour when I first started them. Ran out the timer on repairs. Lost all my launch chiefs etc. Never not laumched
---
It's Godd Howard, Supreme Jarl of West Virginia.

:(
---
only because in those games duping is virtually (haha) impossible.  WoW is the other big one with 'farmers' and it's gold farmers in there, as soon as they made it so 'trial' accounts couldn't send items/money in the mail, this almost completely stopped.
---
Honestly if legendaries had a digit string on the end of them, unique to a given legendary that might help the issue, as it could do a 'if more than one with this string exists, delete all of them' kinda thing, hell, a 16 digit 'tag', with alpha/numeric symbols only has.... 7,958,661,109,946,400,884,391,936 possible combinations 7 septillion, let that sink in, that's an ASTRONOMICALLY huge number, just using 0-9 and a-z, not including capitals leters, which if those were included....comes upto 47,672,401,706,823,533,450,263,330,816 which is 47+ octillion....if that many legendaries are looted.....that'd be insane
---
loading screen says they are champion boss level. will drop a little more than the usual mob. but are below legendary. 
---
Had to or did that because it was faster?
---
I‚Äôll help to 
---
It's broken right now, the new codes didn't work.
---
I‚Äôve run into a few.
---
I spent 10 minutes running around a tree with one slowly whittling it‚Äôs health down with my level 10 hunting rifle (At the time)...thanks level 157 dude chilling outside harpers ferry lol
---
At the printers in the room before the armory in Enclave Bunner
---
This right here, my thoughts exactly
---
Todd is 5ft 6in, which is actually one inch taller than Napoleon supposedly was.
---
lol so you played for only 5 mins?
---
Not gonna lie, I can't stand the look of the pipe weapons lol. I know the pipe weapons can outperform the hunting rifle with good perks but they are so ugly lol
---
Random question. Do you need the key bits? Or you just need the complete solved code thingy?
---
Try entering and exiting power armour.
---
That can randomly reset weird glitches like this
---
With explosive damage
---
lol! Nice
---
doesnt make sense tho i waited for a while and it was happening to my friend aswell
---
&amp;#x200B;

This would require Bethesda obtaining more music for the game. They couldn't even handle a canvas bag without trying to maximize profits, I doubt they would drop the cash on more music to add variety to the game. While I've thought about this idea all the way back in Fallout 3, modding with PC seems the only way to go to get what you really want out of a radio station. Given this is online only, it's highly unlikely. 
---
Nerf demolitionist perk so max is 60-80% and make is so explosive and two shot are the same Star so you can‚Äôt get both
---
2hnd with power armor makes you feel like an unstoppable killing machine. Right perks and legendary effects mean you can OHKO things. Without them, you still do alot of damage. Charging into enemies and smashing their heads in is so satisfying, especially when super mutants cry about limbs being crippled. Overall, power armor is not required, but it does give that added defense for when you're in the middle  a shitstorm of damage. It does give that iron man/thor hybrid feel though (added flair with Tesla mod and the electric damage mutation). While I don't like the fact the "endgame" heavily favors or encourages power armor, and to an extent melee, it has been an enjoyable 100+ levels of skull bashing.
---
That‚Äôs the main thing I noticed. I recommend swap out super duper in battle and use a bloody mess rank 3 (gives +15% dmg overall and enemies explode so looks awesome)
---

The printers were blank and said in-progress. That's what I figured but bravo was already solved and I don't know how lol
---
this is exactly what happened to me
---
The crafting materials that always quietly soak up a lot of my stash are the ones that can‚Äôt be bulked ‚Äî gold, silver, circuits, antiseptic, etc.  
---
if you‚Äôre over about 100 of those you can safely drop them.
---
On PS4 here. I‚Äôm set up at the woodpile that‚Äôs North of the junkpile. 
---
Sorry if I ever took your stuff. I only took some purified water, adhesive, and screws. I hope I left enough AMMO and healing chems. 
---
I wish we had drop boxes in our camps. I feel guilt when I sell things for the caps. 
---
Literally had to. You can‚Äôt do it any other way without keywords. You can get the codes but again, useless without keywords
---
They fixed it, I launched bravo like an hour ago. 
---
Only problem I have with it, is people who desperately try to mow down everything before anyone has a chance to tag, but that's the tagging system it's self not the weapon. In my eyes melee is just as effective as ranged if not better is some situations   
---
I don‚Äôt understand that in a game where you can fast travel away from somewhere... or simply server hop. 
---
There has not been a single 1* or better legendary hunting rifle. Not 1

There is 1600 combinations for alpha silo. No point in trying. Also if you don't have a keyword when you want to decrypt on nukacrypt. Use a question mark "?"
---
I know of every possible way to reduce damage in PvP, and the only reason I can't use all of them is because of extremely rare gear. Even using all of them in just the right setting, I've seen damage on guns that even with all of that reduction does more damage than a player's health can be. I would say every time I login I PvP at least 5 times, and have killed maybe 200 players. People using TSE's with high ground that can't be reached immediately with marsupial will at most have to hit me twice to kill me, it's overpowered. I'm not saying melee isn't OP also, btw.
---
Already tried that, it gives me back my pip boy but all my items are still invisible. I know they're not gone because if I pick up 1 stimpak, it'll show in my inventory the previous amount I had + 1 (21). Same goes for all other things. But then I get disconnected after some time. My character is technically in power armor but doesn't show it because I cannot activate crafting benches.. GG.
---
A lot of times if you plug in a headset after starting the Xbox and especially the game the headset just wont register and you need to reset.  Otherwise its any number of other settings you need to configure and check.  
---
It's so strange that it actually works the way you expect it to with this weird hack when it doesn't if you try the obvious way. Makes me think it's actually some kind of bug with the item and not actually what they intended. Or they wanted them to stack but couldn't make it work right and just totally punted by turning that off.
---
The letters will pop up over time in the bunker above the printers. 
---
Okay well 1) I don't use reddit a whole lot, specifically usually only to make a character for a shadowrun game or to read so I don't have a whole lot of karma.  I honestly didn't even know what that was.  
---
I'll take your message as questions instead of accusations and provide what answers I have to them.  He did not use a stolen credit card but his own which is still active, the same way he bought the atom points which Bethesda has listed as valid.  He bought the game from Bethesda via Amazon through Amazon's store just like the one I am providing a link for [here](https://www.amazon.com/Bethesda-US-E3-PC-2018-060518-003-Fallout-Digital-Code/dp/B07DK49CCN)  
---
I find it strange that people are fine to jump on a hate bandwagon when people are getting banned or having some trivial problem but when somebody is just trying to get some traction so that either Bethesda or Amazon will give an answer other than "talk to the other guy" most people are trying to say it's his fault.
---
* Fixed silo timer bug that prevented nuke launches
---
* Fixed bug that allowed players to use a stimpack more often than every 20 minutes
---
Yes like those, what on earth :|
---
Maybe I missed it, but we definately need a way to see what plans we already know so we don't accidentally purchase them beggars we aren't sure if wr already know them. 
---
Nah I don‚Äôt scam. I can understand if you can‚Äôt trust someone you just met or a stranger 
---
It‚Äôs only an issue because so many people have explosive legendaries thanks to duping (I wish I did).
---
They nerfed the grenade launcher (it used multiple perk lines before) so I guess if they HAD to nerf explosive legendary weapons they could make it so that explosive perks don‚Äôt amplify the damage
---
White Knight Perk ftw on armor durability, max rank = best.  Fix it, highlight something else then re-highlight and check stats for amazement factor.  Building with it gives you the ranked benefit immediately.
---
this, especially with sentinel armor 
---
Every GOT DANG time!
---
Yeah indeed. And maybe people participating in a trading post can invest in it by having their own assaultrons and other defence at some point. 
---
And wouldn't it be nice if we could place more than 2 mines at the same time?
---
I don't know what this means, but I appreciate it none the less. 
---
I have 5 overseers holotapes and I don't know what to do next.
---
The current tatts cant be moved around right? Theyre fixed onto a specific spot? I havent tried them out yet
---
Well, there would be areas where everyone died. Even if a lot survived the bombs. It just fits my head Canon.
---
I love having 5 sets of armor just randomly standing around for people to ransack while I try to figure which set is which. *Hint It‚Äôs ALWAYS THE FUCKING LAST ARMOR CHASSIS I CHECK!!!
---
I've killed dozens of queens and have never seen loot NOT instanced 
---
You need a nuclear key card from the game and the launch codes aren't needed. I can't remember the last time I had a code piece haha as long as you get the launch codes online and a key card in game, you're good
---
Dumb question but are there other types of mound becides dirt? I feel dumb but I never noticed if the mounds were made of different material
---
Yes always, but people just igjore disclaimers
---
Have you managed to find a solution here yet?
---
Hahaha 
---
Did he buy the game from Bethesda? 
---
No.
---
He bought it from Amazon ..... That's who they need to deal with. 
---
If I bought a game from EB games and the disc was cracked in half or the download code didn't work, I go through them.... Not the developer 
---
Not wrong 
---
That because it is high ground and better strategy. It‚Äôs not only TSE. If it was Assassin Legendary with good perks they would have won that gun fight.
---
Can confirm Anglers by the truckload.  
---
Seems quite a few of us have hit this spot....and moved.
---
If you're on the Bethesda launcher, there's an option to repair files. I don't know if that would work, but I would try it.
---
Ah, my bad, sorry
---
Implying that they don't have marsupial
---
They have fixed locations
---
Thanks.
---
&gt;Takes very little effort, and makes a huge difference.
---
Pretty much sums up the game.
---
I used underscores, do they work the same? And when I used underscores there were tons of solutions lol
---
I miss my favorite ‚Äûthat machine‚Äú rifle (M1 Garand) 
---
I heard they fixed all that but I haven‚Äôt confirmed myself since the updates 
---
Crap.
---
List of random things to try:
---
- die and Respawn
---
- get downed then revived by a friend
---
- trigger trade interface 
---
- move to an interior.
---
Basically anything that changes player state 
---
Folks, there are resource deposits around the whitesprings area thats only a max 9 caps travel or a few minures walk. Junk, Lead, Steel, acid, and I'm sure theres others. If you're farming the Whitesprings, then farm smart folks.
---
While spending the umpteenth time trying to kill unruly golfers, I saw a level 100something camped on top of the clubhouse. He then flew down and was jumping over buildings. 
---
I want irradiated thistle for... medicinal reasons.
---
I see this as the only option. But then you have the issue with shotguns that are already multishot already. 
---
Might work the same. I don't know. I didn't make the website. 
---
You can only repair it with toilet paper
---
I picked up on the many other games part over the last few weeks. Out of curiosity I started going back a few months on some youtube channels and they frequently go for some negative thing on some game. 
---
I see the tide turning towards Anthem next. I think towards the end of January you will see more Anthem posts than Fallout 76 and February will be open season on Anthem.
---
One thing is clear to me now and that is I will never subscribe to overly negative youtube channels ever again, not even if my bias is towards the channel (think iPhone vs Android). That nagativity is toxic is should be starved so it can die off.
---
This is the only thing I need to make me happy in this game. I'm completely perked out at lvl 47 for no Power armor. I'm now said I can play end game content without leveling a ton more times and re-speccing into Power Armor build, which I don't want to do since I despise the look and feel of PA.
---
Were the updates recent? Because this happened on New Years, maybe the day before. 
---
what do you mean by double dip? are you saying a pipe weapon can scale off rifleman and pistol perks simultaneously?
---
I personally wish they wouldnt let people build anywhere on whitesprings, but I disagree with a ton of design choices in 76 so meh...
---
I did grab a lot of shit they thought they were duping, went to flatwoods and dropped off little goodie bags for lowbies. I don‚Äôt want duped shit, but you do you
---
Yeah it‚Äôs the one weapon it doesn‚Äôt work on, could be something to do with it being a name legendary that has its own unique model.
---
Pistols, energy weapons, most heavy weapons are all obsolete and inferior in every way to rifles.
---
There's also very little balance in melee as well. 2 hander trounce everything else.
---
Ah. So theres this compaint about lack of end game content and players are essentially skipping a portion of it to get to the end result? 
---
No idea, but came here to share my frustrations, too. It‚Äôs a minor one, but prevents me and my SO from enjoying the game to the full potential. 
---
Tried this too, it seems my character is corrupted and not my game files. Not sure what may have caused it to corrupt because everything was fine until I crashed after fighting SBQ. Log back in and RIP.
---
They will never be fixed.  The code is so leaky and the servers so choppy they will be discovering new dupe exploits for years.  My only hope is that it is so easy that the folks who find these bugs get bored and move on to other games that give them a better challenge.
---
That is a big problem.  For the most part, I keep the valuable junk I can't live without in my stash, weight be damned.  Shit like wood, steel, oil, rubber, and a few others is all kept on me.
---
So you can find plans out in the world or buy them from vendors. I found flannel and jeans plan from the shelf in harpers ferry (marine wetsuit location as well) I also found raider leathers in a vendors inventory and bought it so I can now craft that too. You just gotta look around, no set location for them.
---
Introduce the damage bug back in ^^/s
---
It should be a percentage of total overall damage (as opposed to per pellet) and either not stack or stack far less with demolition expert. Many weapons with explosive by itself are reasonably balanced, but shotguns blow everything else out of the water, no pun intended. The handmade too, but that's just because it's such a powerful weapon from the start. "Fixing" that would require nerfing the gun itself, not explosive specifically
---
They can‚Äôt touch your armor. No ransacking. 
---
Or this is another alt of the alt who was "posting for a friend" in that thread 
---
Exactly, are numbers being published somewhere?
---
What I can tell you is that there are always players on the servers I'm on and I'm always running into and interacting with other players.
---
I've server hopped for hours and never noticed landing on the same server.
---
I‚Äôll pass on living near deathclaw Island thanks...it could actually be a peninsula

was 2 or 3 weeks for the PA bugs... We are never going to see all of this in the game...
---
But great list.
---
100% agree, as a guy who does the same thing in every Fallout game (supressor, scope, stealth), lugging my primary and secondary rifle is a 30-40lb ordeal at the moment. 
---
Can u only build team in menu on pc?
---
They like to randomly sort items for some strange reason. Sort your items by weight, then grab an item out that has neighbors weighing the same amount. Good ole Beth will shuffle the remaining items for some odd reason. 
---
¬∑No vendor should shared caps with any other vendors, this will hlp duper economy as well, now the market economy going down becuz of rare weapon can get it like a normal weapon, if change this , yes market economy will rise and duper is the winning. I rmb play in NOVEMBER, i just wanna buy a small thing also can overprice by someone and saying, u can go n farm ur cap at whitespring n mothman egg, after this changes, i will see so many ppl overprice and say u can get caps from vendors. This list is good but not the best
---
They are all freaking diseased too.  Drug taking, std having freaks 
---
So the only placeable items are from the shop? Go figure..
---
Pharma Farma maxed out. 
---
I was talking about the rare ones, like witch costume, civil war era dress, haven't seen those anywhere.
---
Thanks for the responses people 
---
That's the trade-off.
---
Pistols would be relevent if they had an anti armor perk (every other type does) yet here we are.
---
Rifles aren't gimped because they are heavy

Terminal Bug!
---
HUD and compass on bottom are about 20 degrees off on PS4. 
---
They craft a chunk of them and drop them then craft more, this causes the servers to crash, therefore duplicating the items they‚Äôre putting in the barrel 
---
How do you go about farming them?
---
He has a mutation. My friend was also able to get up on the whitesprings roof with it. He got so mad when he accidentally cured himself with radaway!
---
I've seen people find those out in the wastes, random loot or random plans. Like I stated it's kind of luck if you find them or not. 
---
Blackwater mine entrance has toxic water with barrels next to and in it.
---
My camp is very close by so it‚Äôs convenient for me 
---
Have you done the responders quest line in Morgantown? One of the quests has you open a safe with like 30-50 stimpaks 
---
It's toooo hhaaaarrrddd
---
Be in PA. Store your fusion cores in your stash. Store all armor pieces. 
---
Now you need to run your current fusion core empty. 
---
Now have enemy kill you. 
---
Hope this helps 
---
What you saw was just marsupial and bird bones mutations.
---
Take over workshops you find, defend them, and finish events/dailies you find. They drop you a stupid amount of purified water, stimpaks, radaway, and ammo/resources just for the quest rewards

The biggest problem is deciding which of you 200 mini-pers to have out lol

Is there a sight attachment for this yet? I‚Äôve scrapped like 50+ and not gotten anything but the receivers and stocks

Well that sounds like a useful one, thanks!

Idk if things have changed but if you have the Marsupial mutation and the perk for increase positive effects if team is mutated and you have 4 people in the team all mutated you could jump higher then the scorch beasts flying around. 
---
Yup i like what u say, like everything too ez, and i also suggest level system now, why saying tht lv 50 n lv 200 is the same, if reach higher lv than 50, will nvr say tht repair cost too high or even hunger thrist üòÇüòÇ
---
I bulk everything...except plastic, and it saves me tonnes of stash space so I feel the weights reported in game are slightly off
---
Yup thats me. I dont even know how to dupe but now Im a higher lvl, players have accused me cos of evrything Ive accumulated legit. Back to goodie bags.
---
So I usually server hop at flatwoods. Kill the 3 Brahmin near the trailer house and you can get Brahmin hide (I got 12 leather from 3 hides I think I may be wrong) but then server hop and repeat. Also at treetops next to camp venture if you search around while climbing up treetops, you can find hide and leather bundles galore.

Isn't that how things are in real life in terms of pistols &lt; rifles. Also if you want to make any of these weapons not inferior all you have to do is spec into the correct perks and make a stealth crit build with whatever weapon type. For example, my current side arm is a 2 shot ultracite laser pistol. Even at 29 dmg, because of my perks, it is very effective at dispatching higher level enemies. Also you seem to forget that black powder pistols are extremely powerful yet fall under the pistols category. Some of my bp pistols do x10 more damage than some of my rifles and thats without perks to boost dmg output

Honestly duping is the problem with the market currently, as why trade/buy things from honest players when you could get a 'god teir' weapon for half that price at most from a scoundrel
---
I think the civil war fort has a handful of hide bundles, if i remember rightly. might be a good place to run through and nab some.

careful though I had a deathclaw sshow up in the parking lot on my way out.

A few spots with the cows , as well as teddy bears all produce leather. Not hard to find

What mods are applied play a massive role.
---
Hence why everyone wants item plans so they can craft and scrap and get mod plans so they can upgrade legendaries when they get them

As of new years eve, my camp is unable to be placed anytime I log in. Even if there is in actuality no other camp or discernable reason why my camp can't be placed. I camp rebuild the camp, but once I log out and back in the same issue come up. On top of that, it doesn't properly store/blueprint items that were placed initially, including wall decorations, creating benches, and free standing crops. 
---
While I'm at it, since the last patch there's been a unplaceable large water purifier in my stored section, that can‚Äôt be deconstructed. 
---
Look for the house with the car bowls around Flatwoods. Got almost 200 hundred plastic from that. Or Morgantown high.

That‚Äôs insanity.  Not stupidity.

Someone is just duping people, it‚Äôll be fine once they patch it üòâ

Looks like you got a good gun.

Its good, not the best but definitely good. Nice find.

Western duster is atom shop I believe? I don't mind but I'd like to find something that has a long coat or duster out in the wastes. If worse comes to worse I'll buy the western duster lol

Just to add, on console it's the select button or context (I think, the left center button, since they renamed it) on xbox then right stick up or down.
---
&gt; Both of them talk at length about how players can't nuke each other and must now cooperate... 
---
The article is all of 300 words, nobody was speaking at at length. As for the nuke silo issue, they do reference a BGS tweet as their source. I can't attest because I haven't played in the last couple days but, hey, just because I haven't played it in the past 24 hours doesn't mean I don't play this game. The same logic should be applied to the article if you're really looking for objectivity. 
---
Honestly, I agree with the article's analysis. BGS has a lot of work to do, how they handled the release was complete shit, and I do have my fingers crossed that they'll pull off a No Man's Sky-style redemption. If *you* really play this game, I think you could agree to those statements as well. I don't get why you're so up-in-arms.
---
A tip jar would be a nice build item.
---
I would like to have the following weapons:
---
* Anti-materiel rifle (NV) 
---
* Assault carbine (NV) 
---
* Automatic rifle (NV) 
---
* Battle rifle (NV) 
---
* Trail carbine (NV) 
---
* Laser Musket (FO4)

So you haven't even played the patched game.

Cool.

abandoned mine at start of Enclave quest line, always has 2 deathclaws, even with server hoping.

The rating contains the online interaction warning so it probably isn't a legal matter. They may just not want the variable in the equation. You can voice chat something but it doesn't have the lasting effect of dumping a heap of screws renamed to cunt or something into the economy.  Like I said earlier, physical memory seems to be a  big issue for 76, (ie stash size) so maybe they just worry that people will leg the system somehow when millions of item names are being tracked on a single server. My guess is as time goes on we will see things start to get changed and/or introduced as they learn what all the limitations are and how to work within them.
---
Deathclaws always drop gears. I believe mole miners drop them as well. You could go to Charleston landfill collect from the 3 junk piles server hop and repeat.
---
Exactly  right. When we do a hotfix at my comoany it isn't something done without multiple sign-offs from multiple senior managers / executives.
---
A hotfix by nature is an emergency patch that is disruptive to the client base and isn't something you do without proper senior management level consultation.
---
Make it not do x6 sheet damage is a start.
---
Its explosive so only demo expert should effect the damage.
---
The problem with the affix is exponential. 
---
I have a pump with sheet damage at 250.  It shoots 8 pellets or so. That's 4k.  It hits 6 parts if i hit center mass for 24k.
---
I run zero shotgun perks and zero demo expert.
---
It's nearly impossible to see any nearby or relatively close markers on the PA HUD.
---
Quest markers and placed waypoints are all you can easily see, unless you're basically standing in front of the location.
---
Not sure if it still works as I have ample resources through just scavenging and not using power armour but try storing the work bench in build mode then re-placing it 
---
Damn fr? ill check that out, thanks

I'm just wondering how/why/when they programmed her with Rosalyn's personality and voice.
---
It is! I am hoping to get it sometime. Just googled the name of it: Marsupial. Perks are: 
---
Carry weight+20, +jump height. Downside is you lose -4 intelligence. Sounds like a good trade to me!
---
Yeah, think so, then I would need to figure out what armors to wear
---
Hey now, that lead node is mine! don't tell people about that one :p
---
I had to serve hop for a good few hours at the junction near 
---
Some people don't notice the extra perks on some legendaries. I found where someone sold 2 instigating grognak axes to the watoga vendor with 40% increase swing speed and 1 str. So had to pick them up of course.
---
Theres a mod on PC that stops that
---
Here's my 3 Step Plan:
---
* Nerf the damage increase from the explosive legendary effect by 40%-75%. (Devs can play around with it. Find what works best)
---
* introduce the other effects from F4 like burning, bleeding, etc. and balance them to be roughly equivalent in DPS potential. (Perfect Storm already has the burn effect so they're clearly still programmed in)
---
* Introduce either a legendary effect for armor or a perk card in endurance that reduces damage taken by these secondary damage types like explosive, fire, bleed, etc.
---
This is all I think they'd have to do to resolve the issue. Explosive, as it is, is too powerful of an effect to make balancing against it alone a viable option. In PVE It would undermine the viability of every weapon that doesn't have it on its roll. Balancing for PVE needs to be their first concern when addressing this and no factor, including the effect's impact on PVP, should override this.
---
TLDR: Follow the list, balance for PVE, get a cookie.
---
SHooting the ground gives even crazier results. Seems like the ground goes all over the place multiple times per shot.

So I can‚Äôt place anything in my camp! Basically I have a industrial  water purifier stored in my camp(or a lot since it takes up the whole budget for some reason). But I can‚Äôt scrap it! Even tho it‚Äôs in my stored tab, it acts like it wants to place, because a material list pops up(like to make and place it) so I can‚Äôt build anything else in my camp. Plz help!
---
I havent seen the plans but the civil war era dress/suit is in the little museam next to the cemetery south of the fort.
---
Oof, that'll be a bit of a grind cause I don't wanna have to pay over 2k caps for a coat on the 76 bazaar reddit lol
---
I don't think they should be banned.  I dont condone cheating but honestly they are actually helping way more people than they hurt and it is Bethesdas fault this shit exists and has persisted in the first place.  I think an account reset would be justifiable punishment which may cause them to quit but then it's on the duper to make that decision.
---
He reminds me of the Gman in a lot of ways. He has an interesting, cold speech pattern, often insists that you do things for questionable reasons, and is probably a bad guy that shouldn't be trusted at all.
---
I am not aware of that perk. Does it give bonus damage to suppressed weapons?
---
I got mine from the queen (Pump shot with anti armor and explosive) but is definitely a beast weapon overall.
---
It's an elevator to escape the nuclear silo. It's sadly one way i belive. 
---
I got something to work on, now, :) getting out of reach would be useful
---
exit from a missile silo
---
Killed one at the NAR Repair Yard.
---
I don't believe so, I really hope they update it soon. After scrapping that many SMGs were you able to get a suppressor for it?
---
I have the same problem! Plz help Bethesda!!!!!!!
---
That's a exit not a entrance lol. That's the secret way out from inside the silos 
---
Has happened once or twice to me but not this week.  Killed one that landed just now at the Pumpkin house.  Then another came immediately so I just legged it into the woods to save ammo.
---
Nope. I don‚Äôt think there is one 
---
Meh, I'd just end up throwing stones in mine
---
Keep Wouldn't  it Be Nice tbh i enjoy the song in it.
---
Yup exit from the silos. Nothing else special unfortunately
---
That kinda makes sense.  Rifles are the most well rounded category in the game, so having them all high weight sort of balances that versatility.
---
...same but shrieking like a little girl..........
---
But if it's exit only why the button?
---
I wish someone with less of a life than me would compile all this shit and show how much bullshit has been spread about this game.
---
I wouldn't mind a documentary that goes into the (real) failings of the game, but you could also spend half it talking about the bullshit.
---
Yea, ive done a few of those and ive gotten at most one or two diluted stims. Probably just unlucky tho lmao
---
One can have a life and build a gaming PC if they aren't a lazy bastard.
---
Pretty sweet find. 
---
There is a staircase
---
It's like a foundation set with a stair case built in it, 1x2 squares it takes up
---
Hmm another person in the post said they were able to get one by scrapping but im seeing a lot of mixed information
---
So no then
---
Also no recon scope on lever gun.
---
I did all of my maps (9 or 10 or them) the other day. Definitely not the same experience as you. I will most likely not do any additional maps. The very first map I did, the one plan I received was the ivory grip plan....
---
Treasure maps were very disappointing. 
---
No idea. I think people could've gone down to the silo through there lore wise I guess you could say, but us vault dwellers have to do it the hard way and fight our way through.
---
I hope they have enough money from fo76 (and confidence for its future) to do any of these. 
---
Obviously the one you pay 3000 atoms for;) ahaha
---
Where do you get these numbers from?
---
Yes, we all will be.
---
Conned. 
---
YOU‚ÄôRE OLD.

Me too! I keep getting speed demon....I wanna hop around like a superhero! 
---
Were u by chance digging up a lot of treasure maps at the time it happened?
---
&gt; pc gamer has another article about this
---
Can you please link it? The one article you did link to says nothing about dead servers orthe player base. In fact the article you did link to is unbiased and only mentions a ‚Äúbotched launch‚Äù in the final paragraph.
---
&gt; ...the rest of the outfit ruins the look.
---
Well, that's a matter of opinion and taste, is it not? I like it because it is better than the other choice and I won't snub it simply because I don't think it is perfect.
---
XD. I have got to get the rest of those books, kinda stopped reading them after The Ghost King.
---
Yeah...
---
One thing that's overlooked in the game that's been bugging me, salt gives 1% food with a 0% change to thirst. Has nobody at Bethesda taken a little bit of salt and put it on their tongues? That shit makes you thirsty so why doesn't a whole damn salt shaker? Is our character swallowing the bottle also? I think we should get back glass and metal from salt/pepper shakers and get back glass from nukacolas, we already get caps why not some free glass also? Is recycling not a thing in the fallout universe???
---
How many chassis do you need?
---
ESO subs have a fantastic crafting bank. 
---
I do not have any walls or steel beam supports under the upper floors and still couldn't place a fence. I was trying to make a fenced off stairwell down and around a hill, I found that the steel stairs with handguards snapped to the gate fence was a great combo so nobody could accidentally fall off. Unfortunately after a lot of fiddling I couldn't get the fences on and I wasn't able to use foundation pieces without the legs floating in midair. So that project is still on standby. I will try again after reading your post but I am 99% sure I was trying to do it how you described.
---
Watoga Mayor for a Quest day gives you access to at least 8 Stimpacks per server. 
---
Does the 40% swing speed show up in the listed dmg or does it increase dps 40%?  
---
You want to spec based on the unlikely probability of finding cryptids? I love it. 
---
You'd want to go crossbow and Bowie knife exclusively, with related perks. The food you eat needs to boost stats and probably only use combo drugs (psychobuff, mostly) but use them sparingly. Carry like five disease cures for aesthetic. All food/water perks should boost longevity. 
---
Other than that Van Helsing was a pretty normal dude. Realistically if you've played The Witcher just pretend to be Geralt: be prepared for anything and kill monsters according to their weaknesses. This would require remoddding weapons a lot and I'm sure a lot of repair. 
---
This sounds super edgy in a fun way and I hope I get to see some updates. 
---
If you're on Xbox one, I can sell you some decently cheap.
---
Good luck, you'll probably have write an essay explaining why naming objects in your inventory is good for the playerbase. XD
---
Lmao
---
My SO and I are also having this issue as of today except neither of us can get our camps up at the same time anymore. It's incredibly frustrating. 
---
Oh yeah I dug like 40 maps at the bog while waiting for the nuke to drop. Is there a bug with treasure maps ??
---
Oh I have. I mean for one nothing has even changed in two weeks lol so your point is moot off the bat. But it's kind of sad the only arguments you can muster are pedantic quips trying to find fault out of the smallest thing taken way to literally. I guess since everything needs to be laid out completely for you I have not played seriously/long sessions in two weeks. I have been on for a couple hours here and there.
---
Did not help. Thanks though.
---
I know this is an old post but anyone find a work around. Twice while scrapping combat armor it showed I unlocked polymer but o don't see it anywhere on any of the armor pieces. This was a few days ago still no luck...
---
I binged them all on audible. The narrator for them is fantastic. Whenever I think of them I can clearly hear their voices lol. 
---
Of course, thanks a ton
---
Well, most of the music in the game seems to be free public domain stuff from the 1930s that may or may not obliquely reference West Virginia and or guns, so there's probably a junk pile of the stuff they could stick an intern extractor on.  But given that players can't even hear each other's radios even though the songs seem to be server based suggests we're all just going to have to get our racist rants and domestic abuse background noise straight from player hot mics the way Todd always intended.
---
Would love to play but your level is way higher than mine 7. If you restart let me know? :)
---
I‚Äôm gonna name my John 
---
I haven't tried excavator in nuke zones, I just thought the x01 gives a lot more radiation protection.  If you're not mutated, this could probably be remedied with radx +diluted radx and rad shield if you are mutated.
---
Yeah, the extra is from strong back.
---
Does anyone know if this was fixed yet?
---
Oh definitely, I plan on playing normally like grinding and nukes but when I get pumped and prepared I'll be hunting some cryptids lol I wanted to do some type of longcoat, crossbow obviously and bowie knife. I'm trying to figure out what perks and special load out would be best fitting and also hard hitting when it comes to damage. 
---
Really wish they did this. The single color hud and pip menus is really annoying.
---
It's an agility perk available starting at level 27: 2.15x, 2.3x, or 2.5x to your sneak attack damage with ranged weapons. Basically the ranged version of ninja. Doesn't matter if the weapon is suppressed or not though.
---
Also....the past 6 servers I've been on have only had lvl 20 and below camps there.....so my lvl 92 ass only slaughters lvl 10ish ghouls......I feel like I may just start wrecking camps placed there from now on....#rebel
---
Someone sold a blackpowder rifle with mutant slayer on it to a vendor. The second perk was explosive bullets. Bought it instantly, does 870 damage now.
---
Make your way to any hospital or clinic with Pharma farm maxed out.    Get the Chemist Perk in INT to double your crafted or diluted stims. 
---
Do events.  They are quick and usually give a few stimpacks.  
---
Thank you for the heads up. Is it legal to apply?
---
I'm talking about identical base items, but one is legendary and rolls worse stats. I have picked up so many legendaries with good rolls, but they have shitty base defense compared to the regular versions I find, so they get trashed. I had to trash some weightless, +1 STR robot legs and it pissed me off so much because I was wearing regular robot legs, but they had much better base defense. 30/30/22 compared to 26/26/18 fully modded.
---
Yea its legal

---
It's rumoured they fixed the dupe loophole with this hot fix.
---
You can get a receipt to craft them from the white springs bunker
---
Because Bethesda does not - ever - make good PC interfaces. And they never fix them either. You need a third-party mod to make the UI functional on a PC whose monitor is 1m away from your eyes. Key bindings are even worse. ESC for the nap? Scroll wheel for favourites? (Once you figure out how zooming in/out works, try to avoid punching your monitor in rage)
---
PvP is hot garbage in this game currently with low levels being able to 2 shot high levels due to scaling wonkiness and melee in general being stupidly overpowered and unsatisfying to fight.
---
Vats melee builds are the most obnoxious thing to deal with wince its like fighting the "its nothing personal kid" teleporting ninja meme in the digital flesh.
---
Bethesda needs to massively overhaul the pvp in 76 for it not to be a joke and I also find it silly that you called them assholes for playing the game as intended but that is another rant for another day.
---
PS I really dislike how cheese melee is in pve and pvp not just one.

Wow, you have room in your stash for more than one complete PA set?  8o

I'm a damn vegetarian because I'm not risking my marsupial lol.

Marine armor plans also spawn in Harper's ferry. It's in the second and third floor of the building to the left of the game where you spawn in. You have to jump up on top of the car and then the train car to get up to it once inside the gate.
---
Best solution i've found is to restart the game and group up from the main menu before entering a server.
---
Im mot sure what you mean!? Im not looking for a duped weapon im just wanting to buy an explosive weapon
---
I think you are wasting a perk point in how you allocated your Rifleman Perks: The first rank of each gives 10%, but the second and third only give 5% each (total of 20% for level 3 of each card = 40%). So if you take Rifleman to level 3, but then take level 1 of both Expert Rifleman and Master Rifleman, you'll get the same 40% bonus, but for one less point spent. (or spend that point and get an extra 5% more for level 2 in Expert or Master).   
---
Personally, I'd skip the points for Gunslinger, as you can get a Combat Rifle or Assault rifle that does that close in job better, that uses your rifleman perks (i.e. way more damage). Early on, use the Pipe rifle for Rate of Fire (better than 10mm pistol with correct (and massively available) mods.   
---
Remember, "non-automatic" isn't just bolt actions, it's all the non-FULL Auto rifles too (Assault, Combat, Handmade, Gauss, Laser, Plasma). ;)   
---
Also, take a good critical look at your "roadmap". The availability of perks at low level means you would be hitting a lot of those "nice" luck perks very late game.  I built a spreadsheet to plan better based on when perks were available.  Notice that Nukes and Dragons shows you having a bunch of "no card this level" spots... ;)   
---
Good luck and see you out there.

Was going to look for it later today, just heard about the plan. I bought the costume off the Responder Bot the other day.

I'm constructing a Watchtower for Sierra Bravos and this really, REALLY HELPS

Why is there no perk for reduced rifle weight? As a sniper I think this is one of the most frustrating things for me. I carry a lever action and handmade, which add up to nearly 50 lbs combined. I don't want to keep putting points into strength just for increased carry weight.

Collect typewriters and fans from any office building and scrap for gears.

It took me about 5 hours of farming the location from the wiki, then found another by the Church in the Mire shortly thereafter.

Damn people out there fucking it up for everyone. Smh

Yeah this is a problem. Personally I hate wearing the stuff, I kind of which is wasn't such a necessity. I almost never used it FO4.

The HUD is horrible to read and slightly fishbowled, like you said nothing shows up on the compass unless you're right on top of it, and somehow flashlight strapped to your arm provides a nice broad wash but one strapped to your head can only spot a small area in the centre of your viewpoint.
---
Essentially. But the issue is people refer to the end game fighting. We have 2 things to do. Kill whitesprings or kill the scorch beast queen. It's the test of combat skills late game that most of us care about
---
bruh u dont know how many times i server hopped there i think it will never appear

It appears you're promoting a discord server or community. This is not allowed under Rule 5 and your post has been removed.

---
Bethesda has screwed up twice in a short period of time.  Both due to patches.  Patches which should fix things. Not break more of them.
---
I like some aspects of FO76. Other aspects are annoying or not well thought out. Some problems look as if they will be addressed. 
---
Had my first real PVP yesterday. My buddy and I are around level 60 (melee builds) and these 4 guys run into his base while he‚Äôs working on it(doors unlocked). They surround us and one of them attacks him and I kill the guy in one swing. This goes on for about 10 minutes with none of them ever killing me. That was the quickest 200 caps I‚Äôve ever made lol
---
Number of pellets has been tested on here. Pump is 8, double is 11.
---
As for hitting every body part that's a carry over from fo4 where these same guns were one shot cannons.
---
And shotguns normally do the sheet damage if all pellets hit but explosive doesn't follow that rule.
---
250 is just what my unperked shotgun does and its incredibly low. I've seen 500 pushing the damage up to 48k.
---
True but things take time
---
Also the plethora of gifs from rockstar games showing off literal gamebreaking bugs, and everyone is just like "LOL, classic rockstar, never change!", but Bethesda, who is known for buggy games manages to pull off a multiplayer game with their engine that was never remotely designed for multiplayer, and had net code shoved in there and it actually works, nah, nothing but hate.
---
Its a Deathcllaw being attacked by scorched. seen it once and I shot the deathclaw before i noticed its name
---
go to the charleston capitol building there is a bunch of typewriters
---
I used to make the healing salves, not the best but definitely helped lower levels until I got the recipies
---
That's awesome! How many of each type of chem do you normally hold on to?
---
You need to go to the abandoned waste dump in the mire and find the holotapes in there. There's one in a deathclaw nest and 1 on a body, both inside the cave.
---
Beware the 2 deathclaws that call that cave home.
---
And in advance: welcome to the enclave
---
The should make the area right in front of the back doors into a non-buildable zone, problem solved, lol 
---
Theres a dead deathclaw and 2 dead yao guai at fissure prime.
---
lol. How many times are we going to see this? They know, they just don't care. We'll get this QOL stuff right around the time the game is officially dead.
---
You could do what i do and just dump stuff into random containers at the train stations, some low level is bound to pick them up
---
From my own testing, you do next to no damage unless the person is flagged for PvP. After reading these exchanges I once again tested it, on a lvl 30 something and a level 40 something, both times sneak attack critical with a TSE black dragon (2200 dmg). Did about 1-2% of health.
---
I have them all. I‚Äôm not sure exactly what they should do as far as the skin goes but it would be cool if you had them all that you could tell. 
---
Your current build is only useful due to that gun.
---
If you got a two shot rifle it would be better in every single way.
---
Anti armor is why melee is crazy due to incisor.  Its why rifles are strong too with tank killer. Same with the int one for heavy guns.
---
Pistol cannot compete. 
---
Pipe Rifles are your friend.  :-)
---
My TSE Prime Bolt-Action weighs 6 lbs.  :-D
---
It probably isn't super hard either considering you can change the colours in fo4
---
Some cool ideas here. Especially the voice recording part, that'd be brilliant! You'd need a timeline in the pip boy or something to put together a solid 10 minutes of broadcast complete with links and intro. Build a tower at your camp and pick your favourite Fallout classics to play for everyone on the server.

What, are you saying a male can't wear them? LOOK AT THAT BUTT!
---
Why are you selling something for twice the price that people can easily get for free?
---
Are you on PS4? I'm trying to collect magazines and bobbleheads.  I have items to trade. Please PM me
---
Right?! Sorry to hear it's happening to you too but I'm glad someone else understands our frustration
---
I mean. Should you be storing a suit of armor? Like iron Man pulls out his friggin wrist watch? Idk if I have it, I'm using it. I put away others, or just drop em. (I also hope they'd never add weight to the chassis that have armor on in storage, very heavy)
---
Where did you get the spacesuit? I have the helmet, I think I got it from the shopping mall.
---
I think agi and per are a must, followed by end and lck. Your layout would have to depend on what perks you find/have. Seeing as I run one gun + Bowie knife to keep weight down, I would definitely advise using a one hand damage perk as you can never underestimate the usefulness of your knife. And are crossbows classed as rifles? I don't have any rifle perks due to running a survivalist character, so I'm rather ignorant there. But anything that boosts the effectiveness of chems and food would be a good call, as you'd likely be using a lot for wendigos and such. 
---
Some people can't or dont feel like doing these things
---
I did about 20 maps yesterday, 3x ivory grip after I was done lol. (And nothing dropped that was worth it. Level 57).
---
My existence is the bug?
---
You do realise that the total damage including the 2 shot is only 29 damage yet I still kill high level enemies very quickly. Pistols aren't underpowered. They're as powerful as a pistol should be. Pistols are sidearm meaning although they don't pack alot of power, they do not weigh as much as a rifle
---
Definitely. I just don't know what to do in the meantime aside from hoping they fix it. I'm new to the game so it's a big bummer. 
---
If you close the game and reload you can farm away. That‚Äôs how I got about 12? In one night. 
---
What a businessman
---
Yale uoir upvote! 
---
So is it safe to assume the mods on nexus mods are ok to use?  Like the ones for UI changes I mean.
---
Sounds like something a synth would say
---
They can if they‚Äôre in your team. Yes, confirmed. Go try it. Getting tired of people either denying this or not being aware of it.
---
It makes teaming up with ransoms a little iffy.
---
I dont know about learning or cradting legendary mods, but i do like the idea of a passive ability for lvl15 int. That will let you strip an effect as a mod, then attach it to something else.  That way you need to invest and maintain 15 points in intelligence, and obtaining new legendaries is still relevant.  Otherwise eveyone will find that guy with two shot and funnel him caps over killing legends.  
---
Not sure how to do multi-star legends, being able to custom build full 3 stars seems extra broke, so im thinking you can move and replace 1 effect, making 3 stars still matter, but if you know someone, you can replace 1 crap effect (looking at you +3 stats when almost dead in a game where shit can kill you instantly from half or whole).
---
Thank you for your reply. So far, this is the only official statement I've found. It seems to neither confirm or contradict your statement.
---
https://help.bethesda.net/app/answers/detail/a_id/44429/kw/mod
---
Crossbows are considered rifles so they boost from rifleman perks, and would you say van helsing is a stealth type dude? Cause a lot of agi perks are stealth based and I'd hate to have a lot of agi points and not a lot of cards to use. And I'll definitely be using the 1 hand perks. Also I'm using the Chem fiend and alcohol related perks. 
---
Broken armor shouldnt be forced off the chassis. I shouldnt have 15 extra pounds because the leg broke. Also shouldnt have extra weight because I put the power armor on. 
---
There is one shot Melee builds also so your point is invalid. A gun has Range.
---
I'm level 46, But I'm on xbone. Higupon
---
That's because he's scorched!
---
The mole miners scrap has tons of gears in it.  Just go from Welsh East to the tunnel and stock up.  Good way to farm steel and shotgun shells too :)
---
My other personal favourite is people.who build camps right next to the golf club, and then lock them so the rest of us have to run to the train station to unload extra weight. I've started making it a point to fuck these kind of camps up a little when I've finished.
---
Yup, they would need to do the whole ASCAP, Sony and BMI thing and it ain't cheap. Local bars that seemingly are killing it in my town go under over this. 
---
It's such a cool perk! My fear is that I am gonna get it, end up overly radiated, and be forced to cure myself.
---
Thanks for that. I decided to move the CAMP anyway. Haven't encountered the problem again. Now I know for next time.
---
Hey dude, got some real back news but also a grain of hope for you. I had the exact same issue and now have the issue resolved.
---
So i went to log in and only had the "Buy now" option on the launcher. I checked my tansaction logs and it did not show i had ever purchased the game. 
---
Bethesda was 100% useless. I contacted their customer service team and after a few days of waiting they asked me to reset my router and all the standard useless things. In the end they said that as i did not buy through them, i used Green Man Gaming, they could not help. Aka, take it up with them.
---
So I did. I contacted GMG and their team responded within the hour. They checked my previous purchases and saw I had bought the game. They contacted Bethesda and the next day responded to me with the following:
---
"Okay, so Bethesda have been less than helpful in trying to get information out of them, they stated they do not know why the code is appearing as disabled but did not confirm if it was actually disabled.¬†  
---
Here is a replacement code to get you up and running again, whilst we deal with Bethesda seperately."¬† 
---
In short if you purchased the game through another party contact them and hope they are as helpful and profesional as GMG.
---
Hope it helps.
---
...and I‚Äôm so sorry my friend..
---
I think now it's cooking for the crafting part, based on dupe hunter stories. 
---
Wow damn! I just pulled a two-shot black powder rifle last night. I wish we could somehow combine the two, haha.
---
The weights in the yard at the Penitentiary. They mock me with the lure/lie of sweet, sweet lead. 
---
I'm down. One sec. Maybe we can get some more.
---
Isn't everything related to nukes glitched right now? Or did I miss a hot fix?
---
There's a perk you can get that prevents it from falling off like that. It's called starched genes I believe. You mutate yourself until you get what you want and then put the perk on. It's in luck.
---
Does stuff you put in public container actually persist though? I thought it went poof the moment you fast traveled, same as paper bags. If not, then that's great news.
---
I actually think food and water are in a good place right now.  Happy Camper baseline would be nice, but right now I DO have to think about my food and water supply and a disease that makes it worse is sorta a priority to get rid of.
---
 I have a container at my camp site that I mark with a "loot" sign and put a vault boy cutout pointing towards it. I put extra things for wandering players in there. I also tend to put goodies for new players in the Overseer's stash at Flatwoods or at the Overseer's camp.
---
Yeah, I've forgone most stocks and only have 1 scoped to try to keep weights down, plus have a low defense leg piece just cuz it reduces all weapon weight by 20%, but only when not in Power Armor.
---
Yes My point exactly IS that gun has range. 1shot with range&gt; 1 melee. Its as valid as IT gets
---
I like to leave all my extra plans / recipes in containers.
---
Also leave all my explosives
---
I was watching him try and solve it and there are something like a thousand different possibilities so I think it‚Äôll be awhile bravo and Charlie are solved tho
---
Im not sure that people dont like playing the game and would rather pay someone to play it for them.
---
And make sure to report them!
---
I see you edited your response. "Pay me for endgame content" sounds like a stretch, but if you would rather be farming stimpacks or defending your workshops, I offer a service. What do you mean that I'm selling something for twice the price? The in game value has nothing to do with true value, see the in game value of a TSE handmade (less than 200 caps). The keycard offer is for the person who wants 5 keycards now and doesnt have time to farm them
---
&gt; Murgle the cat's place
---
Which Desk?
---
Item level maybe?
---
Level 50 stuff has better stats than level 40
---
Which desk?
---
I'm working right now lol. I'll be done a bit after 9 est
---
Patch notes :
---
&gt;Flare guns can now have legendary effects
---
You got any acid? 
---
do u have the healing salve recipe yet? i rarely ever use stims since i craft healing salves all the time
---
As you are my friend, for getting the reference üòÇ
---
Me and my team are sitting in front of the launch terminal right now awaiting a code so it‚Äôs late for that 
---
Is this all anecdotal about hitting it to low health with a bad weapon then using a good one? This seems like a myth.
---
I DIDNT KNOW THE GUN WAS LOADED!!!! AND I‚ÄôLL NEVER EVER DO IT AGAIN
---
He's just asking if someone wants to run the nuke with him..
---
Its supposed to shoot all 4 rounds at once with one trigger pull
---
I've not seen the pistol perks work for my pipe rifles. 
---
Nice! One for each hand? I've only ever pulled one legendary Grognak Axe...mutant was the only perk, but i still love it! :D
---
Once you level way past the legendary it is no longer useful. Might as well get some caps for it.
---
Fair point, just annoying that literally everything else has a perk card to reduce it's weight by 75-90%. In a game where weight is a huge factor, that 20lb sniper takes up quite a bit of available space.
---
Funny how these epic stories occur when I'm not around.... ;)
---
That‚Äôs the point of a gun range... so your argument is null and void. What guns shouldn‚Äôt be allowed to be use in PVP. Have 2 people in power armor just have a slug feast like it‚Äôs battle bots?
---
Gun will always have range. Even it‚Äôs not a TSE the right guns will still own you at range. There is no excuse for Melee builds to be upset by being killed at range. Melee  is close Quarter Combat.
---
That like a mma fighter getting mad he lost a fight to somebody with a Gun at range. No logic there. Just Victim mentality.
---
I have found things other players have left in public containers, so I am pretty sure it does. 
---
They sure took their money long before telling them.  I explicitly said it was nowhere mentioned when they took peoples money.  So yeah, no problems with my time line.  It is one of the most defining features, and something one would expect, so of course completely reasonable to assume it was glass because it was never brought up.
---
Definitely good input.  RNG is almost never with me, but perhaps I did just get extremely lucky.  I had around 30 maps total across all zones.
---
That‚Äôs how it was until about Wrath if I remember right.  You had to have the item in your bags to summon and dismiss the pet or mount.  I think they could easily do something like this.  Maybe a dog whistle for pups and a bell or cats?
---
Hmu. Sent you a message on xbox
---
  I have found stuff in random containers and also found bags at vendors.  So they must persist for a while.
---
I haven't seen that.....
---
So it'll still only say 1 capacity upon reload, correct?
---
I‚Äôd save the caps. At the current rate we are going, it‚Äôs gonn aget nerfed into the ground. 
---
I only recall dirt mounds, though I wasn't paying close attention to the naming of the mounds as I looted.
---
Point was. Its over powered and on PVP melee stands no chance. I dont mind ofcourse, but it is a fact.
---
Releasing a working game takes time. But hey BGS decided to throw that one under the bus and now it's super duper awesome because the community is now going to cut them the slack they didn't have the courtesy to give the game themselves.
---
The Boardroom Sketch:
---
'Hey guys lets just release it early to get in before Christmas, the players will defend it for us'
---
&gt; dense armor mods
---
Anybody who knows which vendor has the dense (Explosion2) mod for combat armor? You can only get padded (Explosion1) from scrapping.
---
"Change **vendor cap reset** from 24 to 18 hours."
---
I may be wrong, I haven't measured it myself, but I'm fairly certain it's already below 24 hours. It feels about 20 hours currently.
---
A serious amount of work needs to be done with weapon balancing. Just as most level 100+ players are in power armour they are almost all going to be using one of a few weapons. I would bet a lot of those are using the stupidly powerful two shot explosive weapons. I can almost guarantee you that very few, if any, are using pistols, pipe weapons or non-legendary weapons.
---
The problem there is that we're basically being shoved down a small path with the options being, "play the same as almost everyone else" or "play as you want and never be as strong as others". While it might not matter a lot currently it will always be a problem. Just ask anyone trying to get loot from a Whitesprings nuke when some ~~tool~~ obnoxious people roam around, leaping about like a kangaroo on steroids and spamming their two shot explosive guns. You get nothing.
---
Last point but most important for the game perhaps. Perk points. There are some things that just scream "padding" to me with very little if any thought put into them. Why do we have to have two separate perk cards to reduce thirst and hunger from chems? That's 4 perk points alone to remove those negatives. Then there's another for reducing thirst and hunger rate as well as others to remove radiation from food &amp; drink plus another to remove disease chance. That's 5 separate perk cards just for food and drink, 6 if you count the weight reduction perk card too.
---
Managing hunger and thirst is already a pointless micromanaging step but with this essentially being a hardcore mode experience I can accept that. However, I can't accept that it has so many additional requirements that take up the limited perk points while also requiring micromanaging to this degree. This isn't just about food and drink btw. I'm just making the point based on this as no matter your play style you have to eat and drink whereas with weapons you can argue that being specialised in one or two weapon types is a choice. Eating and drinking is not.
---
This should have been in since day 1
---
I‚Äôm going to start paying tribute to the todd 
---
Lol same, just cleaned out alpha and can‚Äôt find codes on the interwebs 
---
Never even heard of the enclave armory.... but after googling it appears that I need to do the enclave quests... can one advise where to start?
---
It is possible these people losing thier accounts were caught duping, it would be very easy to tell by the inventory who is and isnt involved, the banhammer will be coming down people, repent and bask in the glow of the Atom.
---
Specifically pipe bolt action 
---
I actually ended up enjoying how power armor actually feels powerful in this game. In fallout 4 I never used it.
---
Here in survival fallout online I have felt the need and it is pretty cool. I can still do most things out of it but I want to walk into a nuke I can do it best in PA. That is just so badass and thematically/immersively accurate haha
---
I mean yeah it released too early but they are a company after all what are you gonna do. Still enjoying the game though.
---
Yes any mods are ok to use, Bethesda doesn't disclose anywhere that you can't use mods
---
Yes its one of the few I do whenever it pops up on the map
---
&gt;People who play the game know nukes cause high level enemies to spawn or a queen on fissures. If someone kills a player with a nuke it is either by accident or sadism, not the actual purpose of the nuke launch.
---
You're right. First they just destroy everything in Whitesprings by hand and THEN drop the nuke.
---
I was dragging my broken and overloaded ass through the hills high up on the east side of the map. Came across somebody‚Äôs largish steel house. Completely locked up right. Everything. Pointlessly. Pure spite.
---
I was so pissed I almost nuked the crap out of it. I could have, easily. His fusion generator, turrets and all. My better nature prevailed and I just limped away.
---
Fucking selfish assholes.
---
Yes absolutely haha
---
That makes sense. Thanks.
---
I'm level 81 but happy to help for a bit. KuteKuddleyKiwi
---
You state that. But I have seen other posts with Melee build claiming the don‚Äôt have any issues. Is it harder yes. But it can be done consistently. I have a friend all he does is PvP. He is a melee build that hits around 2k dps. He has no issues with PvP.
---
He have to get smarter and use better tactics and builds. That is all there is to it.
---
Life is a swamp, drink it. üí¶
---
It was more like a 3 hour server maintenance than a hot fix, but ya its suppose to be fixed. 
---
NukaCrypt team is working on Alpha right now
---
This sub is cancerously against PvP and want it to fail to the point tons of them down vote any mention of it. People can‚Äôt even make suggestion threads/requests for PvP features that they enjoy because some non PvPers feel like everyone should be forced to play their way. So instead of trying to find a constructive community wide solution, there‚Äôs just two extremes forming.
---
When really both sides would probably be satisfied with instanced death match queues and a couple competitive modes that would all be opt in. As anyone can see by now the server split isn‚Äôt coming anytime soon. And things like CTF and King of the Hill would are additions with endless potential and yet, here we are.
---
Just shows how much some like to ruin shit for everyone if it doesn‚Äôt cater directly to them.
---
Most people just wave at me. 
---
&gt; The author of the article has definitely not played this game for any reasonable extent of time to be writing articles about it.
---
Time for the daily FO76 bingo. Canned response to choose from:
---
* Don't review the game if you haven't played it
---
* If you've played it for more than 40 hours you got your money's worth
---
* Who would play a game they hate for 200 hours?
---
Get the Thru Hiker agility perk to reduce food weight. I pick 200 razorgrain 7 times (1400) and then go on trip to all the vendors. Then you dont have to waste caps on going back to billings several times.
---
Question: if I notice suspected dupers, would me craft spamming to intentionally crash the server faster possibly screw them out of their duped items if the crash is ill-timed for them? I‚Äôm not actually gonna do this, just curious as I dunno the specifics of how duping works.
---
Thank you! I will hunt that down! Didn't even know it existed, but I think I have like one point in luck, so my knowledge on it is underwhelming, lol.
---
They don't want to pay the media everyone knows they are Bethesda most news sources hate them because they no longer send out review copies of their games so ign and all this game studios have to buy the game like us peasants and Bethesda has mainly focused on youtubers which news outlets hate
---
 It is level 50, that is the highest level weapons go.
---
Good to know, thank you :)
---
From what I've personally tried you most likely get either 1 * loot or nothing from one hitting 2 * -3 * enemies, that being said there's a chance you will get the appropriate loot on one hitting. My theory is that the game doesn't have time to register the right weapon spawn when they are insta gibbed immediately after spawning and letting the health regen effect (some people are saying mutate) happens it triggers it in some way, weither or not that's just the games code being able to register the enemy type or if it's intentional. Seeing as someone said this happened on fo4 and it's the same engine its very possible. I'm going to upload a side by side comparison either later tonight or tomorrow for everyone to see what I'm talking about. Haven't had any time today to do this. There's people in the comments saying they've tried and can confirm this as well. 
---
Just reduced the brightness a bit!
---
I have no idea what‚Äôs that is
---
It's a "quest holder only" item, but the box often glitches so I check it everytime im in the area, I have well over 100 stims atm. 
---
&gt; but they are a company after all what are you gonna do
---
Oh, well that's fine then. Guys it's just a company trying to make money by shitting on the consumer and their employees. What could we possibly do about it.
---
Commenting to find this later
---
someday you find big thing you know when you see it
---
They also could have changed it, or I could have just been at the time limit when I swapped servers and it dropped off naturally.
---
Power armor makes you weild it with one hand I think
---
Put a ? Where the letters are and you can solve. There‚Äôs a ton of possibilities for alpha though. Good luck
---
Haha, that is why I always make "Evacuation Stairs" that look ridiculous and hang off the side of my house when I am reconstructing.  It prevents the second floor access errors and I just remove them later like scaffolding
---
Like everyone has said, the connectors and pylons need direct power with wires. There is actually a green light that shows up on the connectors and pylons when they have power to them to show they are working.
---
I've literally done this with teammates.  They can only access the power armor if you drop it not deploy it.
---
I might. 
---
From other post, people are sayong its a problem of the game's core engine and thus is unfixable with half measures
---
People would probably pay $3 venmo for these services, I can see someone paying $5 for a bunch of keycards. 
---
Fallout fan since interplay was in charge... been a life long fan you could say... dunno what people expected ... seriously I got exactly what I paid for and I'm super excited for future developments and releases, games crashing? Fallout 4 was the same it's a hardcore game client it pushed my ps4 console to its limits and now fo76 is doing the same to my ps4 pro... not surprised it's a BIG game guys BIG world... expect crashes. 
---
We're all from the same vault.. pvp isn't gonna get better it's been added for sport enjoy what it is and learn to fight back it's a roleplaying game and most of us don't wanna play physcotic player killer roles... just saying.. the game doesn't need an open challenge pvp it would be fine with an arena style pvp like borderlands had where a little bubble closes around you and opponent and no one can interfere till it's over. 
---
In my opinion not many true fans are disappointed at all... I mean we cruising round at levels 150-200+ now and well I can guarantee excepting the weight exploit for a week or so my entire experience has been legit and all my levels and gear were earned or achieved through legit events and battles and the hours I've put into looting and scrapping and crafting etc ... In short I'm not at all disappointed in my fo76 experience and I'm sure many feel the same or opposed but I've heard enough smack I like this game and it gets my defense.
---
Alpha confirmed! 
---
I put my camp right there but I have 0 turrets.  I put down lots of plants, signs, and a scarecrow to attract the mobs of ghouls.  It's a great spot to find a team and having benches, beds, instruments and such is great.  I spent all last night there farming with others.  Just don't build turrets.
---
Wait, in FO76 even if you have pacifist on other people will attack you?
---
Hmm this could be a who knows scenario, because as you said the rules are so strange.  But I know I was frustrated and hated the look of halfwalls outlining my second floor balconies - as soon as I temporarily removed the first floor walls I was able to install the fencing around the second floor
---
Who knows
---
If I recall all 2HE are 1HE animations when in PA which makes sense to me. 
---
I'm on PC, it's level 50. I don't need anything right now though. If you're on PC just come grab it anytime
---
Nice idea. There‚Äôs no hover on consoles, though. 
---
Do you sell any weapons?
---
War never changes.
---
or a 3 star legendary feral ghoul that for some unknown reason dropps no legendary items for you or your 3 friends
---
do not repair armor..just buy it..unless it is something like regenerating HP..anytime my armor is broken i just drop it
---
So did they come up with a dupe patch? 
---
Wait, so i bought a game and have to play it to your liking? 
---
Nice downvote.
---
You‚Äôre literally wrong. My husband and I regularly get in and out of each other‚Äôs armor right after the other has exited it. Along with a team mate. Along with another married couple.
---
Get butthurt and keep down voting. It doesn‚Äôt alter reality.
---
It‚Äôs not his line of work.
---
I‚Äôll be around as well GT Leaky Buffer
---
I don't currently have any weapons to sell , unless you wanted one I could craft. I am not super high level , just looking to offload excess supplies I have. 
---
I note your wife doesn‚Äôt call you tripod however :(
---
I can build a computer but I can‚Äôt build a rug so not really

Also it‚Äôs a lot for the servers to keep track of item names.

He definitely utilises stealth when he's hunting a lone monster. His preparedness and the element of surprise are his greatest weapons, followed by his badass crossbow. 
---
The alcohol perks are good because later in his life he became an alcoholic. 
---
Yeah, it was sort of joke, because basically everyone has their camp in whitesprings, but also depending on how vendors implemented, whitesprings could very well be the trading hub of the game.

People in the vault are supposed to be the "best and brightest" and are supposed to be the ones to "rebuild" so I think they're capable of making a rug 
---
Didn't downvote you, but okay.  I'm really not wrong.  I've gotten out and *asked* friends to try to get in because people like you state demonstrably false things on Reddit all the time.  But good try.
---
that kinda made me smile actually. 
---
Can you make a rug? 
---
I was thinking that. beefy PA.
---
The holidays are only JUST over. Be a week or two till things pick up pace again.
---
Not a problem just make them Power Armor Frame 1 and 2 etc. And make sure if I whip out power armor frame 3 it's always got the same pieces on it (like excavator for example)
---
That do well enough for me. 
---
On ps4 
---
players often appear as invisible or in no clothing.

I dont know if this is intended or not but ive have multiple legendary enemies not drop legendary items.

Nope.

Yes, I can throw my shirt on the ground

Build a barn then.

Are you on PS? If so, could we come to an arrangement?

Holy shit. This "Dear Bethesda" stuff has got to stop because you're all being conditioned to think they give a shit when they don't. Not to mention that most of this shit should be in the game in the first place. 
---
Should rename the list "Things that would have made 76 a AAA game if they were included at launch"
---
Found one of these but at level 35. Nice find.
---
Only if killing other poeples animals took away ammo just like stealing other poeple plants.
---
I think you should take off the ballistic fiber part.  It‚Äôs only hard early in the game, with white knight you take in more than you can use.
---
Seems like a loading error.
---
Cola but perk makes them just as good as stims. 
---
Not a rug that‚Äôs a shirt on the ground.
---
Which is basically a rug
---
Lol let's get wasted and hunt monsters!
---
Cola nut perk makes it an amazing drink
---
Nukem lol
---
That's been a thing since release

Even just showing what pieces that are on the chassis would be nice.
---
..... the damaged ones are all* located in the panels on the console that require the cores . You remove them all and place the good ones that you have on you and repair the damaged ones that you removed to fill the remainder . The repair can only be done at a tinkerers workbench and are found under quest items . The repair recipe requires the damaged cores that you Removed from the console ...

the easiest way to do this is just I remove all 15 cores and repair then at the tinkerers workbench found 50-75 m from the console then replace them all with the repaired cores . 
---
It‚Äôs not glitched , I keep seeing posts from people launching on all platforms .
---
I'll do all the above for half price 
---
I can build a house and not build a rug just like my character.
---
Yes that's what happened if u do more than like 15 without switching servers it seems to break yur char ...there is no know fix for this
---
Pretty junk rug then. 
---
What sort of rug?
---
I can build plenty of mechanical and electrical stuff yet if you ask me to crochet or nit I‚Äôm going to look at you like you‚Äôre speaking mandarin.
---
Morgantown High as well 
---
TP for my pool cue
---
I'm on xbox or I'd do it for free.
---
Thanks for sharing. I have yet to try any treasure hunting and always drop these. Sounds like a fun and possibly worth while adventure!
---
Kneel before Todd!
---
For munted 
---
It's west, close to top fo the world I think. I was very sad when I saw it :(
---
Indeed.  If they wanted to know, they'd, you know, contact Bethesda and ask.
---
You had to be Vault Hall Monitor on Rug day, so you couldn‚Äôt attend the class
---
No, he‚Äôs not. It‚Äôs glitchy. I‚Äôm completely clean from rads during a bomb event, while he keeps having to use Radaway to keep from dying.
---
When he unequips it and re-equips it several times, it starts working again.
---
K
---
And when you assume things, you'll just end up with disappointment. There was ample enough time from when the company emailed everyone regarding that it's plastic and when they received it. 
---
Off I was the exact same as you haha
---
Then go to flatwood save yourself the trouble of a firebreather with an axe coming home like John wick 
---
Well if you saw how many takers another guy got for this service in one of the market subs you'd know it's quite a few.
---
That's really awesome and thanks for the info, if you have any links to those threads off hand that would be great it sounds really interesting.
---
Or a scorchbeast queen that drops a 3 star rolling pin or weightless wooden left arm? 
---
Vendor bot at Harper's ferry.
---
I would for sure get a tse blackpowder rifle,  very high damage. My tse Dragon is at 2283 damage.
---
you can get a lot of plastic cat bowls (20-30ish) if you need plastic.
---
I see them at the watoga station vendor more often than sometimes
---
Yeah, that‚Äôs it. I‚Äôm trying to pull a ‚Äúfast one‚Äù for...reasons? And five of us have collectively hallucinated multiple instances.
---
Sure, ok.
---
What is TSE mean? Two shot explosives? Or is the S for some other legendary
---
I put mine inside to prevent that. She still gets killed :(
---
Pretty much bro. I'm an entitled asshole, cant you tell?
---
&gt;24 people per server
---
Childs play to a p2p or home dedicated server system, and what does 24 people all together even offer it seems to me you don't need more than a single small team to get all 76's multiplayer has to offer. 8 people tops.
---
&gt;If they want to ensure the game's longevity, they need that cost covered.
---
They already know how to make enduring games, and that's easily moddable single player games. Taking that to multiplayer is as simple as useing a p2p or player made sever system so far nothing the game offered has necessitated an expensive architecture. Server/client just doesn't add value over it's alternatives.
---
&gt;Bethesda Austin needs funding, and MTX is the best option for them.
---
Gearbox's borderlands model (also Austin based) would have been an adequate and consumer friendly fit
---
&gt;Yeah, THEY did, but so far THIS game hasn't. They said they won't and I will believe them till proven otherwise.
---
Bethesda has twisted words before like the word games they played over "totally not paid mods" creation club or shafting fo4's season pass. Broadening to zenimax we have the case of them reneging on their ESO free dlc promises with "chapters". So there you've been proven otherwise.
---
&gt;No
---
Come'on in the name of friendly spirited community?
---
&gt;Which isn't the case here, so it is not really relevant at this time. Maybe in the future, Bethesda could turn down that path, but thus far that is not the case. So comparing this game to all the others here is not a fair argument to make.
---
It totally is the case here most quest rewards lack unique appearances or effects compared to random drops and even fewer are leveled for the endgame they basically expect you to farm a procedural legendary and add your own custom appearance using a skin you bought or grinded. Deny it all you want but these systems do have a real influence on gameplay to bring you back to the cash shop 
---
As in when you have it highlighted in your pip-boy.
---
Traveling Pharmacy (Chem reduced weight)
---
Thru Hiker (Food/Water reduced weight)
---
These two for me are essential. When i log in, it takes a sec for the game to recognize my perks. I noticed today that i had 600 something weight, but when those two perks kicked in i had 130 weight or something like that. It makes a huge difference. Dont get Pack Rat (Junk reduced weight) though. You should be storing your junk in your stash so people cant steal all your stuff.
---
what did they even do to prevent it? add another cap to the amount of crafteable boards?
---
I like your style.
---
Worked great for me until recently, maybe worse at higher levels?
---
Had to get rid of my Level 5 Somerset at Level 30 when I ran out of stash space. Black Diamond, Bunker Buster (which was broken and did no extra damage), and a host of others. Took the fun out of the whole reward system pretty quickly.
---
Things like this are why I‚Äôve logged maybe two hours in the last 3 weeks to be honest.
---
It does take away ammo, if your using a gun to shoot it, then you lose ammo
---
Regarding your camp getting nuked; where was it? If it was on the Whitesprings grounds it'll get nuked all the damn time. Don't build there. 
---
It's like an Oregon Trail minigame.
---
YOU HAVE DIED OF DYSENTARY.
---
But do you have a permit for post apocalyptic nuclear launching services?
---
It means Two Shot Explosive just like you said.
---
More than likely you've been dropping it.  From our brief conversation you seem like the type to not get the difference between dropping power armor and maintaining ownership of it.
---
Try, if you havent starting your ps4 in safe mode and reconstructing the database. Its like a defrag on the ps4. This could fix your problem. Fair warning it will reset your homescreen and any game that needs an update the ps4 will try downloading the updates.
---
I like this tip the most!
---
I'll give it a shot. Thanks for replying!
---
Near the generals bit, there are lots of desks.  Almost always find one or two in there.  If you get unlucky which isn't often, check the cell area desk which usually has one too.
---
I have no clue as to why there are no legendary hunting rifles other than an oversight, or extremely rare.  I wish they would let us put .308 receivers on the combat rifles like we could in 4.  That‚Äôd be a great ammo dump.
---
I mean the first and third ones have a point. The second is a subjective value judgement.
---
Not sure if you still need it but it should be 47572867
---
That doesn't sound like a friend! Haha
---
Knitting isnt really self taught, mechanically inclined people can build some crazy stuff when they put there mind to it.
---
And/or add anti-materiel rifles and let those be legendary
---
Grab some legendary armor that reduces weapon weight
---
Same as .50 cal snipers, I think they will be too OP with a combination of Two Shot + Explosive, would love to see them in the game tho. Just not in PvP lol. "There! A enem..." *dead*
---
Get lit, boiiii
---
Now get cannibal.  No more stimpacks needed.
---
1 point into the radiation goes away during day hours is good enough for radiation removal. 
---
What system
---
With 500,000HP!!  And deals 1000DPS!
---
1h in 3rd person but 2h in 1st person
---
Dude, there is so much here..... Just move on. This game is never going to be what we all want, what we all hoped it'd be. There is no way even 25% of these happen. 
---
How is a shirt on the ground a rug? Rugs are usually woven. 
---
I beat my first one at 32, no legendaries at all, just a lever action with some upgrades and a super sledge, wearing full set of lvl 30 T-51b power armor,  for me it was a matter of patience and persistence and about 15 stims
---
It's a bug most likely.  Capacity should just be 1 but you found a way to make the game think the capacity loaded is higher.  Recently I managed to load all of my shotgun shells into my explosive shotgun somehow and it didn't revert, haven't been able to replicate it since.
---
I am lvl102 but no particularly OP Weapons
---
Sea and sand is my GT feel free to invite 
---
Everyone said this was a bug when I tried to tell people about it before.  I loaded up FO4 and they do the exact same thing.
---
Well I believe that the Deathclaw that was getting attacked was a different one, since I remembered it being Albino. It was the first time I'd encountered this hot-spot before though, I love that there's so many!
---
I have something much worse than that. Imagine spending days irl looking for a random encounter animal to tame. Then imagine doing that and then with a low chance finding a tamable deathclaw. Then, imagine someone one shotting it with a tse weapon. You live in fear constantly. 
---
I have the torso on ps4
---
With 7 charisma and herd mentality mutation you can share a level three perk.
---
Female character: Casual outfit, fashionable glasses, prospectors hat and full sleeves. Yes, please. 
---
Send {CraZy Marty 695} a message on xbox
---
Pharma Farma and hit up any hospital. Get tons.
---
I haven't got any PA plans from them but I got a gatling laser gun from one.  I finally have an use for the 80 power cores I've been hauling around.
---
I only heard him say subscribe once at end of video am I missing something? Haha. 
---
No. If you had passive on you couldn't even damage npcs. The game was designed to allow trolling and greifing. 
---
They made it to where you can‚Äôt pick up the 250 you dropped. Now you have to drop the 250 then drop the next 50 to combine it into one bag. Then pick up the 300 to activate the glitch.
---
grab a syringer with an endangerol barrel. reduces her damage def by 25% for 2 min, uses normal syringer ammo
---
Oh god, what'd they try to do this time to fix it?
---
Thanks for this. I needed a new route after they nerfed whitesprings. 
---
Yeah, my play style  is more about the greater good or some may call it min/max.  In my opinion nothing in endurance is necessary and every point spent there would be better off spent somewhere else.  
---
Really bethesda..... that ain‚Äôt gonna fix shittttt
---
Yeah, it's the struggle to escape pipe rifle/ hunting rifle city and finally move on to 30 where you can start to use some cool weapons.
---
As silly as this guys proposal is... I have to say, its WAY WAY WAY more creative than some of these wannabe trader imposters that think they are gonna be rolling in caps trying to sell their Enamel Buckets and fucking Tato plants to anyone.
---
Upvoted for creativity.
---
&gt; As you can see, I've never encountered either Calibrated Shocks, Targeting HUD or Reactive Plates (making them below 1% chance).
---
Not necessarily. Server hopping 100 times and never finding a mod doesn't mean the chance is below 1% just as flipping a coin 100 times resulting in 53 heads and 47 tails doesn't mean tails has less than a 50% chance to come up.
---
&gt; My only guess is that the vendor items available at a time are "shared" with the entire server population. Where a calibrated shocks mod could've been purchased before I accessed the vendor (two accounts are required to test that idea).
---
Negative. I was server hopping by rejoining a friend's world and the mod inventory was different each time. The only things I've noticed that are shared between players are *some* things that players sell to vendors like legendaries.
---
More likely it's just low probability and RNG. FWIW, I server hopped around 40 - 50 times finding 2 Targeting HUD mods and no Core Assembly mods (you found no Targeting HUD and found Core Assembly 6% of the time). 
---
Ps4 :)
---
How about if you don't like the song playing, you change the station? Like in real life? Flip to classical for a couple minutes and come back. That way no songs are removed and makes nobody upset.
---
Ahhhh the humble sewing machine.
---
Seriously though sewing is an artform. Theres a reason why persian rugs command top dollars. Better than your shirt on the floor thats for sure.
---
They are quite rare, I have seen only two outside a nuke zone. One near Top of the World and the other east of Sugar Grove.
---
This is my biggest issue with bases right on the golf club. Turrets stealing my kills for no good reason.
---
Drifters coat. Cheaper. And easier to find. Brown tho. Not black :/
---
Can't really say it's been getting worse for me. it's only happened to me a hand full of times, most of witch were early game when we would do it more to help the group progress.
---
Anybody find it mildly infuriating that regular ballistic ammo and grenades set oily pools alight, put explosive ammo does *not*?
---
Ha! Even haters don't give a shit about Fallout anymore so even people like you are getting upvoted here now it seems.
---
First, Red Dead Redemption 2 is a single player first game, you can't compare it to Fallout 76. Especially about the quality of those two games. Just go watch few gameplay videos of both games, if you are not fucking blind you will think like "holy Fallout is trash". Just don't to be honest.
---
Second, you may be a Guy who likes fishing in multiplayer games but guess what, you don't get fucking "friendly mode" in every Multiplayer game. "Oh these guys are bullying me, please include a friendly mode to EVE Online". That's sad. I understand you are a casual player just don't expect every game to be casual friendly.
---
BUT I SAW A DATAMINED THING THAT SAID LUNCH BOX, SO THEY'RE PUTTING IN MICROTRANSACTIONS FOR THINGS, I'M VERY MAD.
---
- My friend who stopped playing when the pocketed bug got fixed
---
Someone at Bethesda won't rest until all weapons have ivory grips!
---
Here you are :) [https://nukacrypt.com/solved](https://nukacrypt.com/solved)
---
No prob! Yeah I never had luck with Whitesprings. The stashes were never there for me... either they weren't spawning or it was over farmed.
---
Dreams were dreams haha it would've been nice. 
---
And kill you.
---
You can't hurt them, however.
---
Cigarettes.  Horde cigarettes, packs and packs of them.
---
It's a great place for photos. I was at Top of the World for the first nuke I saw launched, and I got a pretty great picture from the windows up there!
---
If something can be exploited, it will be. Most dupers don't think about "Oh how will this effect that economy that I never even thought about before", they just see an easier way to get weapons and caps. Sure, its a shitty practice and they for sure deserve some kind of punishment, but straight up bans are rediculous. Bethesda should have cracked down and fixed this glitch soon after it became apparent, but they've been dragging their feet to the point its starting to become just as much their fault as the dupers.
---
And when it comes to people who pay real world money for duped items, they're just as bloody bad, it's a market based on stupidity, and frankly a very literal attempt at pay to win. 
---
I hear there is a .308 receiver but I have yet to actually see it. I too am wanting it for that purpose though. I'd love to differentiate my 2shot combat and 2shot lever with different ammo types to conserve it. 
---
Wow that was pretty damned K\*nty, get a proverbial life mate.
---
What do you do about the bounty?
---
I forget RADs are a problem till I hit a nuke zone with sunkissed rank 1. Loooooove it. Always wonder why I have so much weight stacked up and its RadAway.
---
Dear subreddit, nothing you suggest to Bethesda is getting added. 
---
Don't know about actual containers, but I've seen them take out of players paper bags.
---
Must be. I do them whenever I pass by and before I know it I have 500 stims and 400 diluted. I have so damn many that people I pass by aren't even willing to take them for free
---
I had this problem too.  I dropped the plans into a bag and picked them up again and the quest triggered.  Just drop something worthless first, in case a brown bag doesn‚Äôt appear.
---
And this is why i have a legendary fatman with maxed out demolitions expert and wrecking crew or whatever the perk is that lets you wipe out camps. 
---
because when people do this dumb shit, I take them down a fucking peg. Rose don't take kindly to people getting too big for themselves. 
---
i love this idea! personally, i would love to have a little radrat following me around, but really any little critter would make my freakin' day!
---
Hahaha so true! However, if they make PVP servers where pacifist doesnt work then I guess toy enter at your own risk! Let the guys that dont want PVP have their 2shot .50 cal for the hoards!
---
Korean double amputee dwarven porn is weird.
---
You can tame animals, and then keep them around at your camp. Animals includes pretty much anything that's not a scorched or robot btw
---
Or, and stay with me cause this is gonna get complex....you could just play the game?
---
There is literally nothing on the map you can't solo at level 50 with a mediocre build, except the queen. Why wouldn't I perk for fun and convenience instead of min/max?
---
Which hopefully isn't a standard that follows into an online game like this. Hopefully there'll be a team working on more frequent, smaller DLC and a larger team working on far harbour style DLC. 
---
Me and a mate spent over an hour today running the map, me north and him South, never found him. Cheers me right up knowing he's the only way to get powered door plans.
---
Also I wanna be able to put Power Armor Chassis in my favorites wheel
---
Technically yes but it also means its a patch outside of regular testing. They are meant for game breaking things and major issues. Sometimes you're forced to take servers down.
---
I get that people say stuff like this but that‚Äôs not really my point here. If you read the article the guy really doesn‚Äôt understand the game. 
---
‚ÄúIt's anyone's guess as to what "Player Vending" actually entails, but it's hopefully something to do with Fallout 76 traders. ‚Äú
---
What is this sentence? Player venders isn‚Äôt very ambiguous and it certainly doesn‚Äôt have anything to do with in game traders. It‚Äôs like he read updates and posts and tried to piece together an article without firsthand experience in the game and it comes across as ignorant.
---
You can review a game with only a few hours played, it won‚Äôt be as accurate but it‚Äôll be a good impression of what that amount of time in the game can be like.
---
That‚Äôs not what this article is tho. It‚Äôs a short update type article written for clicks (which is their job as journalists so no hate there). But the author should have more understanding of the game than this guy has.
---
Silos are working again?
---
yes you can 
---
How did you get a bramin?!
---
Yeah, he tamed it using the relative perks... animal whisperer etc.
---
You can tame animal/creatures that are lower level than you, and they will travel to your CAMP and chill out there.
---
  
---
He obviously likes his pet so logged out so you couldnt kill it
---
real tears shed while reading this
---
Dear Bethesda, please add a bunch of little fixes that should have already existed to make this game way more playable then slap yourself for not originally including them.
---
I actually have not heard of that one yet.  Be awesome to get your hands on.  I‚Äôm sure it drops from some obscure quest or vendor.
---
RIP. Thanks for the help.
---
And then smoke em all!
---
Do you have a power armor chassis at the station?
---
Anglers drop a fuck ton, I think 6+ each. You can find them in the mire. I generally find two of them in the power station directly west of berkley springs
---
The plans bramin pin
---
I mean, i want to know where i can get a bunch of those
---
Oh wow.. Just wow.. How could a game ever have bugs, despicable. 
---
Did you found it?
---
I'm at watoga. Launch when ready
---
A fairly common location for the plans is just west of the red rocket near harpers ferry. You'll come across a small metal shack infested with ticks, it'll be on the TV next to the bed. If you don't find it and you're on PS4, I can give you one tomorrow. 
---
I've got a guy on my friends list that claims he can do the mod. I need to hit him up for it one of these days. 
---
Little by little we can do it
---
That's awesome ... totally getting a 91 glowing DC now I was aware you could pacify.. had no idea you could actually keep them from one server to the next..
---
Yep, need to place down your power armor at or near to a Power Armor Station.
---
NOTE - it doesnt need to be in the actual mine itself, can be any station
---
Dear Community,
---
Buy more atom items and MAYBE we're implement some things the community wants.
---
Sincerely, Bethesda
---
/maybe
---
There just aren‚Äôt that many there any more. Its down to 3. 
---
You may have had a mutation, legendary effect, or a chem increasing your CHA when that happened
---
Maybe not because what if you hit it by accident
---
Reminds me of when I played on a minecraft server, crafted a wooden pick, named it "Dragon Egg" sold it for a fortune.
---
But pipe bolt action sniper rifles already exist and are almost identical. Hell, they're even better because they are supposedly affected by both the pistol and rifle damage perks. Not to mention a two shot explosive handmade deals 70% of that damage per hit, except it's a semi or full auto assault rifle instead of a bolt action
---
Definitely.  I‚Äôm amazed how many things are out there that are still rare.  Like all the T60 paints.  I never knew there were military or winterized until recently.
---
Using a relay switch and terminal was how I fixed it in FO4, haven‚Äôt come across it yet I‚Äôm FO76. Thinking something like that may work
---
Yea like the other guy said you are building the pieces for the power armor not the frame u need to have a chasis there with u
---
No wonder it's not fun anymore. Why not try playing the game? Surviving Appalachia?
---
I‚Äôm curious too, particularly about how all y‚Äôall manage to deal with nuke zones, particularly whether you still find you can use a maximize-damage-by-staying-at-20%-health build and what armor combinations you use (all unyielding?  all zealot‚Äôs and ghoul slayer‚Äôs?  All chameleon?  Something else?)
---
I do not.
---
I do, however, feel real dumb.  
---
If you are on PS4 I have extra now, they are called powered gates 
---
Bought it from the super mutant traveling merchant (cant remember how to spell his name)
---
We want positive attitude. 
---
Well I just learned that from you. Any idea how they are obtained? It isn't by scrapping 100 pieces of t60 is it? 
---
lvl 65 joining in 10
---
I would like Appalachia Radio available, but something else too. I probably won't get it, especially since there are lots of other things to fix that are more important, but here it is.
---
In the Farming Simulator game (don't judge me), you do have the ability to tune several radio stations (streams) plus one that you make yourself by loading mp3s into a folder on your PC. I'm certain Bethesda doesn't want to allow streams for fear of people streaming nothing but objectionable shit 24x7 - plus the logistics of streaming from one player to the game to another player. But I'd like the ability to listen to music on my own from my own playlist, like the custom "radio station" on FS.
---
Meh, he‚Äôs a kitten after you hit 30.
---
Ahh, I‚Äôm on Xbox 
---
Definitely one my biggest gripe with the game's "Story" is they say that A LOT in the beginning but you leave the vault all as idiots. Yet, terminal entries inside of that vault show that there were people trying to hack 76 from inside of it. So there were intelligent people. Which then begs the  question of why our character isn't skilled in anything but was admitted. Maybe born in the vault, I guess? But then why did our character learn absolutely nothing while there? 
---
Chassis in other room, also the register station is there, so may as well do it there:-)
---
But I have an Xbox, no mods for me üò≠
---
You mean like their two-week "beta" that led to the product launching as is?
---
Creation club. 
---
Yeah but I‚Äôm a hurry both would be great. Seeing the pieces in a stash at least would be good
---
PC, and sentinel is the rarest of them all 
---
I ... wut?
---
Any tamed animal you get to your camp, if it is killed or attacked, does it then give the player a Wanted status?
---
This is why everyone nukes the place.
---
Could the distance be tied to Perception?
---
I'd rather have some sort of faction currency I need to buy the mods earned through doing repeatable tasks. Give me a reason to play the game rather than server hop. 
---
If you or a loved one suffers from mesothelioma you may be entitled to compensation. 
---
440 for me with perks. Hopped for about 2 hours straight. 
---
Ahh - when the chassis is selected.  Cool. 
---
I don't think they touched that in this hotfix.  That extra step you mentioned was from after the previous update.  
---
Excavator (carry weight) , combat (X-01), and exploring (T-60)
---
‚ÄúDarn maybe next time I‚Äôll get ‚Äòem.‚Äù
---
Alot of people asked about that and Bethesda said no on account of questionable shit and also taking what's already having to be stored server-side + console users won't have access to it and will probably complain 
---
&gt; Do these publications know how obvious it is to actual players that they have no fucking idea what they are talking about?
---
Have you read what they say about any other games? About youtubers? You can show half their articles to a random person and say it came from the onion
---
The spacesuit is found at the crashed space station in Toxic Valley. There is a keypad door that you find a code for at the crash site and inside there is the space suit.
---
Does this work: 28775839? Just found it on a site. Stopped playing for the evening so I didn‚Äôt test it.
---
I am right there with you on that. Make it like a Creation Club 2.0 and I would throw my money at it.
---
Wait, really? Visibly? 
---
The T60 also has a lot of the BOS paints for it in game.  There is a guy over in the brotherhood subreddit who has Paladin painted T60
---
Wait what theres an unlimited xp glitch?
---
With Rose I feel like they got Borderlands in my Fallout.
---
Embrace it, go to my camp and try to defend. It's fun when you have a 500+ cap bounty. Tons of people try to come but I lay down a shit of nuke mines. Someone always gets me in the end which is totally cool. It's a game and I don't really care about caps at the end of the day.
---
Sugar grove. In the main room there is a 3 shelf rack. 1 shelf is all pencils (lead) 1 shelf is all clipboards (springs) 1 shelf is all packs and cartons of cigarettes (loads of asbestos)
---
You have a breathless gift for articulating insults. Unfortunately that speaks nothing for intelligence.
---
Exiting and entering power armor are very different than dropping it for someone, or no one. I‚Äôm sorry that you‚Äôre confused by that.
---
Bring back ["That Gun."](http://fallout.wikia.com/wiki/That_Gun)
---
The true vault tec experiment. Enclave is watching the footage of us trying the pick it up and are laughing their asses off. 
---
We had a few discussions about our favorite fallout game, nobody said Fallout76. At same time, we where playing it.
---
My opinion: it's in alpha state or should have taken longer to create. The only reason why this game isn't dead is because of the community who tries to do something. 
---
Grahm
---
Thank you for that 
---
Nope. Before you just dropped 250 boards craft 50 more then pick up the 250 to trigger the glitch. 
---
After the patch today, you have to drop 250, craft 50, then drop the 50 to combine into one bag, then pick up all 300 to trigger the glitch.
---
Good tip. Thanks!
---
Hard work? Lol, 99.99% of those camps are wood and anywhere from 8 to 30 turrets if they exploited.
---
you need to max your luck out.
---
use unyielding armor thats +luck, low health for the +3 across all armor, chems, bobbleheads, magazines, etc
---
when I turn in TD im around 50 luck
---
On Reddit, those that aren't 'idiots', as you put it, use /s at the end of a sarcastic statement.
---
But pipe weapons look like uncle eddy made it while filling his *hitter. 
---
It's a common plan, vendors sell it often and I'm sure it drops lots of places. You may actually already have it, in the build menu it's the thing that produces fertilizer. Counterintuitively it's not called Brahmin pen in the build menu. I think it costs less than 200c?
---
Crazy...

Yeah I've changed it a bit; haven't updated the link though. I have rank 3 on all rifleman perks, got rid of the pistols. At that time I hadn't had a change to use a handmade weapon yet. So currently I have a 308, a handmade, and a combat shottie plus 1 or 2 melee weapons. 
---
Not having test dummies really sucks. 
---
Not sure if having max rank for all rifleman perks is the best, but hey first character. worst case I'll level another. 
---
Use the search function, theres plenty of information here about this already. You cant just tame any creature, also, so a level 91 deathclaw prob wont work out.
---
There's a plan for witch costumes?
---
Nice I wonder if there are other paints for the X01 as well. 
---
And than? 
---
Joining
---
Well that explains it.  I didn‚Äôt get the initiate to drop until after I respected and had more luck.  I thought it was a fluke and didn‚Äôt think too much of it.  Is the TD turn ins also what drop the military and winterized?
---
There's a basket with several at the western base of the monorail elevator, too.
---
I'm very clearly not confused as I've spelled out the differences between the two methods.  If you want to provide any proof against something that has been confirmed before feel free, but until then your baseless claims are just that.
---
Just google them dude 
---
Yep, this bugs me too. I'd really like to have a 2H view from 3rd person too.
---
I leave mine up the hill. It's right on a lead deposit, just out of blast range, and about 2 mins from the blast zone when you walk...
---
I‚Äôd be too scared regardless to drop one, someone could come along and jump in it and run away
---
yes, and I have all of that, I am looking for ultracite calibrated shocks if anyone wants to trade out

Cigarette machines

do you need help in the silo cuz i have to finish i am become death
---
Oops... I didn't know at was loaded.
---
LMG and .50 Cal are Heavy Weapons
---
Automatic Combat Rifle is bugged and still benefits from Rifleman instead of Commando
---
Pipe, Assault, Handmade, and Laser rifles all switch perk cards correctly. No Plasma Rifle to test yet.
---
Submachine Gun and 10mm SMG also correctly use Commando for me

I just noticed today that I don't have to wait half a second for the hit percentage in V.A.T.S to be anything but zero when locking on.
---
Also loading seems to be a bit faster and spam crafting seems much smoother. Actually anything that requires waiting for the server to respond just feels snappier if that makes sense. Whether these were changes from today's hotfix I cant say for sure though. 
---
In all other fallout games I would grab a bolt gun and think im some kind of sniper. at least 76 forced me to play a different build. Same goes for Skyrim, even with best intentions of switching it up, I went sneak build every play through 
---
I would just remove explosive affix from all weapons
---
Any resolution to this yet?  Same thing happened to me, no response to my inquiry on what else was needed for weeks.  I saw the comment from /u/LoneVaultWanderer and updated the invoices with handwritten information, updated my ticket, and absolute silence, not even a confirmation that the ticket has been updated.  
---
We're pretty quickly approaching the arbitrarily-imposed deadline and it seems like that's the intent.
---
A "guy" swimsuit might be nice. I've only seen the stripey one. Speaking of which, my female's bra straps need not show when wearing bare-shoulder styles.

Cut her open. If you find a duping component, your worst fears are confirmed. If all you find are blood and guts, better get back to the dating game asap!
---
I have no clue.  Only ones I know are the prototype, the shiny standard one and then all the atomic shop ones.  I had read somewhere there was a legit Enclave paint in the files but for all my searching never could find it.
---
I agree that drives me crazy!! 
---
I know those 2 are heavies.. but figured i would try them.. cause i couldnt get anything else to work with commando.. 
---
So.. use riflemen for the combat rifle and commando for the SMG.. ill try those out real quick and see what they do.. 
---
Ah ok.. i don't have it, thanks
---
Yeah there was a post a while back about how scorchbeast track and that they'll track towards you even if your hidden with max stealth. Tested it a few times myself, furthest I brought one was from near the pumpkin house to just east of the top of the world just walking in power armor while it sonic blasted the whole time, the tricky part is not letting other enemies or players agro it. 
---
hmmmmm i kno a few of them have mutfruit plants lying nearby but i havent seen one with carrots yet....
---
That's not Bethesda's fault or problem then.  
---
I loved my prototype paint. But then I bought a paintless jetpack torso from someone that looked terrible with the painted pieces. Why can't you reapply the paint? 
---
No and then.
---
Yep I did this too with a dash in front of every item I wanted to keep so that it would put them at the top of the list

There is a quest behind valley Galleria that has to do with some non feral ghouls.

Dupers are people who are overly nice to you. Do not trust them. If someone approaches you with words &amp; emotes instead of a hail of bullets, they're dupers.

They also duplicate items in game using an exploit, but that's not really important.

What do you mean by ‚Äúexploring‚Äù
---
Yes
---
Has Bethesda actualyl given any indication of what 'Player Vending' is? Or is everything just speculation from this subreddit? This is the subreddit that was saying the atom shop datamined lunchboxes were just going to be an Xmas freebie and that the nuke/fissure site bug was a teaser for new content.
---
Ok 
---
I dont remember where they were
---
It should be 4-5 for processing and then more time for shipping, thats usually how it goes 
---
Glad to help. I need farm a ton of asbestos for crafting serums so this is where I go. 
---
Nvm your wold is full
---
Updooted for visibility. 
---
If you've paid via credit card, check how long the chargeback period is. You may have to use that as a last resort. 
---
Likewise for other payment options, check if there's any time limits before you can't dispute any purchases.
---
Oh my God I never thought of that. That is golden.
---
See but then there stuff like melee weapons which have stuff that increases swing rate, reduces weight, increases armor penetration,  increases damage, and they are so much cheaper to repair. I could see that the trade off with melee is the range, but then you have sprint perks and mutations and essentially melee is broken so why can we just have a rifle weight reduced. It‚Äôd make it so you can‚Äôt only carry three rifles back to camp so you can scrap them. 
---
This little exchange is for the benefit of others reading, so that they are aware. If you bothered reading other threads, you would know that several threads exist where people are trying to determine exactly what causes it to happen. We‚Äôre well past ‚Äúis it true‚Äù.
---
I have no more interest in convincing you that it‚Äôs true than I do taking time to convince someone the world is round. Have a nice day.
---
Ditto but with canvas bag replacement.
---
Going to just update my support ticket every 6 hours and hope for the best, if worst comes to worst I have more evidence for small claims if I even cared enough about it.
---
I was in that group for awhile now but I‚Äôve recently seen them on people in game.  Although I was less grouchy about it.
---
This is exactly why I hate the common glowing enemies at high level, it reduces the stealth users ability to sneak up on me. That and they look terrible. 
---
Psn?
---
They should be op as fuck, that's not the problem, the problem is that they should be also incredibly rare but they aren't.
---
Im not sure if for deathclaws its the wasteland whisperer rather than the animal one, so thats one thing to keep in mind, theres two diff perks, and youll need it at 3 stars for that option to appear, but its possible!
---
The third one would have the same point as 'If cigarettes are bad for you why do you buy a pack a week'.
---
Spoiler. They all got killed by bigoted zealots. Go explore more for actual details.

Based on the storyline, I pretty much presumed the Scorch Plague infected EVERYBODY, ghouls included.

" **Dead servers? No steady player base?** "
---
yesterday farmed whitespring for few hours an did not seen any other player... before xmas i always met 2-3 ppl at every run.... the i just counted the players on map after each serverhop and the maximum was 5 player including me.
---
Aw dang, im on PS4 :c You should post to the brotherhood sub though, there are a lot of players there desperate for the higher tier paints that could really use your service on PC.
---
Right. Thanks! So kill on sight! üòÇ
---
Take this up directly with Bethesda‚Äôs legal department. If it has been over 5 weeks since they have you that timeline, threaten to sue. Legally, you can sue for breach of contract.
---
I second, third, and fourth a **"LFG"** tool of some kind. Something in the Social Tab that will let other players know you are looking to team up. In an online multiplier game were the focus is working together, this is a shocking omission. This should have been there day one.
---
That players have to go outside of the game itself, using message boards and other resources, just to find people to play with, is completely ridiculous.
---
But then it becomes this entire catch 22 circlejerk where a few pacifists are being asshats. Then you create a system where you can force pacifists out of their mode because you want to grief.
---
Your proposed fix puts more people at risk than the few wanks stains in pacifist mode griefing non-pacifist mode people.
---
Are you possibly confusing Automatic with Semi-Automatic? I do not think Commando is really bugged in general, at least going by displayed damage.

 *I don't even mind waiting for as long as it takes to be delivered as this is all being done for free. But not even a processing update is kind of worrying. I feel like they're ignoring my request. I don't know what to do.* 
---
Put down a power armor chassis.
---
:( no idea
---
Correct
---
Train stations, red rocket gas stations, every building has at least one outside. 
---
It's always a different guy, they don't have any voice lines, and they teleport. Plus everyone's dead in Appalachia. I guess it could be a Men in Black situation
---
I had a camp I would move there when I wanted to farm. But I'd move it away once I was done. I'd also invite people to team up and profit with me. 
---
at least in GTA Online you can play by yourself on a server using port blocking. Hopefully the future PC version of RDR2 will be the same.
---
All I want is some kind of update telling me that the processing stage had been successful and are now preparing for shipping. If it comes to it I will definitely be requesting a full refund. 
---
If you're gonna do a money grabbing asset flip, flip in some of the better assets. 
---
I noticed something. For all that they seem to hate the game, certain publications (Forbes and Kotaku, to name a few) simply cannot pass even the slightest nugget of news about 76. Like, at all. In Kotaku's case, they also do bloody overviews of their previous coverage presented as new info.
---
I realize some folks can't believe it, but hating on 76 is a social trend strong enough to make memes about. It drives clicks, which is hilarious, because if teabagging it is not a thing, why do the clickbaiters keep returning to it long past the point where they would leave it to the ignoble death they obviously feel it deserves?
---
Not negating that there are problems, mind you. But there is criticism, and then there's this shit.
---
Solid choice
---
It absolutely should. Lore dictates that PA is the end all be all of military technological achievement. It is supposed to be the best thing to use, period. If you want to not use it that‚Äôs fine but there should be a gap between PA and the next step down, the marine armor set, and there is. 
---
I like the compromise with the hazmat suit though, and the penalty makes sense. 
---
i haven't even gotten an email yet saying my ticket has been accepted. the status under all tickets still says waiting on agent. :/ 
---
Yeh I know want part of either of those suspicions because they were obviously wack. The data minded lootboxes were something they were considering in the development process that got scrapped before release once the controversy around them made them more of a detriment to a game than the income they offered countered.
---
Specifics on player venders aren‚Äôt out but it‚Äôs safe to assume that it‚Äôs a player to player experience, either through vendor boxes that you set up at your CAMP (like the one shown off in the E3 trailer), or a tradehouse (very unlikely).

It is actually listed at fertilizer in your camp. The wheel burrow thing spawns a cow after some time.
---
This sounds like a legal issue. You should take it up with their legal dept, not marketing and sales.
---
Oh boy don't even get me started on that. They sent me TWO emails: One saying my canvas bag is on the way and one saying there was an error with processing my canvas bag. Not sure which one to believe 
---
How are you using it? There's no stagger when you use it to reach a place too high to jump up to like the top of a building or cliff.
---
I did like 20 of these treasure maps the other day and didn't get a single power armor plan :/
---
I'm on Pc. Sorry.
---
The problem with that is that armor perks only work out of power armor, so if you want to play with rifles and power armor, then the those legendary armor perks are useless.
---
Enclave uniform + enclave hat works as formal on both sexes. Red dress is also formal for ladies.
---
It gets really sad when people get legitimate fixes for issues but it's never good enough for some...
---
The current system works perfectly. Try picking a less popular camp spot if it's really that bad for you.
---
Also to add to the list, optimized bracers don't seem to be working atleast on X-01 armor. 
---
You say that as though every other gun that can roll Two Shot and Explosive isn't already massively overpowered with that combination. Even super high rate of fire weapons with that combo will kill you in a handful of hits, any half decent semi-auto is definitely a oneshot.
---
95% sure you don't. 
---
So
---
&gt;It's anyone's guess as to what "Player Vending" actually entails
---
is actually a fair and accurate statement.
---
u dont need nuke just a hamer and \~5min do destroy any base..
---
Was going to suggest this on this sub a week ago, but thought someone would have already
---
Or just keep it in quoted with legendary effects listed under it. That was someone can see my cockblaster69
---
They said a new pvp mode. Not servers. OP is jumping the gun 
---
Didn‚Äôt see your original message 
---
It's honestly really disappointing. I may have to unfortunately go down this route.
---
They're just a small indie company. Please stop the Bethesda abuse
---
If you want some structure to build from, another player has created a skeleton build that allows any playstyle to be created from. They also rank every perk, offer advice for choices, and update the thread regularly. 
---
https://www.falloutbuilds.com/builds/thebuildguide/

Unfortunately this seems like the only option left.

But they might have gotten a tse version and no longer needed this one.

I know its not a 'John Wick' gun, but killing things with the single action revolver is hella satisfying.

Thank you very much, this is likely the issue I'm running into :)
---
Well which is it? Your post was complaining about how it's too easy to accidentally shoot someone's camp if it's there and get a bounty, but in later comments, you and others seem to be way more concerned that the turrets people put up are just taking all of your kills, which is frankly kind of whiny.
---
I guess there's no rule though against being a total baby about it and laying waste too the camp because you "accidentally" shot it. 
---
Oh screw that eye. Dumbass jewel, sitting ever so slightly off center, taunting me. It's maddening. 
---
now the only thing i need to locate is a handmade rifle bp and i'm golden, from what i'm aware it's bugged atm so i need to try and snag one from the prison event so i can make my dragonov build 
---
The bags can just randomly glitch into the ground and be unreachable. That glitch has been around since launch. You're better off trading with someone if you want to give them something, or at least drop some item you don't care about (like a .38 bullet or something) to make sure a bag shows up first then transfer the items you want to drop into the bag.
---
I know next to nothing about legal shit in terms of breach of contract and such but, in this event I think it's straight illegal. However, before you bring any lawyers into it I'd say you oughta just contact they're legal team outright. If anything you might get consolidated that it's being processed. If it goes for too long, you can start looking at a BoC case.
---
That's a dope loadscreen
---
Key point is with friends.  Nearly everything in this game is really fun when done with friends, which is of course why they're your friends in the first place.  Hell I've had a hilarious time with my bros doing nothing but jumping off monorail towers in PA, because we're goofy idiots.  But solo Hunted/Hunter is just a queue simulator that, like most other PvP aspects of the game, will "work" maybe 1 out of 20 times and even then just subject you to being one shot by a guy with a TSE weapon and chameleon.  It feels like something Bethesda spent maybe 10 minutes on after realizing PvP was actually going to happen and they had no endgame content for it, kinda like endgame "dailies" that only give you a handful of tokens to pointlessly extend the amount of time it takes to grind up a mascot costume.
---
There's a reliable Yaoi Gui spawn on the outskirts of Whitesprings golf course which seems to drop springs every time I go kill it so might want to go check that out.

Temperious

But serums from people, they‚Äôre dirt cheap 
---
Nitpicking over words has no worth in games. They said no nps at all, shortly after they said no humans. Pay attention.
---
Does the bounty that gets put on you end up coming out of your own cap stash when you get killed or do you only lose caps when you engage in PVP? 
---
Walking around. Something that increases movement speed or damage resistance
---
Unless they edited the article after this post you are just making shit up to be mad. Not once did it say players launch nukes as part of PvP and otherwise this game is in fact selling like shit and being abandoned by those who bought it. 
---
Brahim pin is useless
---
Sure man. I‚Äôm not here to argue for arguments sake so u win. If u read the article and didn‚Äôt feel like it was lazy, uneducated, and purely informed through Reddit posts and minimal research then I guess we just have different views on what journalism should be.
---
The only thing I disagree with on this list is mostly is this.
---
 "‚Ä¢ End Game should not force you into power armor, make the hazmat suit fit OVER or UNDER everything so you can wear it on top (or under) literally everything else. Some of us don't want to be in power armor and have designed our perks as such."
---
Though its annoying having zero defensive with the hazmat suits going in to nuke zone should require Power armor or a hazmat suit as a trade off. But with perks like ghoulish and mutations there should definitely be a option for playing a ghoulish like playstyle.
---
I had 40-some tech docs.

Revenant is the one non-melee damage-affecting thing you can do with a point or two in END :)

I've been trying to organize that with level 5 workshop PVP now but you're all too obsessed with hoarding and grinding!

Yes, we should all deal with RNG hell just to avoid giving a glitch exploiter a few caps.

---
Is in the opening post. What would you like to buy , if I have it I will likely part with it.
---
I thought of this after trading some power armor and since I‚Äôm under lvl 50, I had to time the despawn times of each one to get the PA I wanted in my inventory to drop
---
How cheap?
---
Scraping the bottle should also give plastic, Oof
---
Not my style to steal credit from someone else's work. 
---
Go on to the trading sub reddits people sell it there cheap. Don‚Äôt buy caps be legit. 
---
 Sure, but the previous poster talked about the level.  
---
500 caps per

I was so frightened by those things the first time I ran into one on the road in the mire.  But now I just wack them a few times and viola - yummy crab meat

I‚Äôve seen 250 each. I sell for 500

For crafting: If you have a mod, you shouldn;t require the same perks to apply it as to build it from scratch. For example, installing a hard-drive and building a hard-drive from scratch require entirely different levels of technical knowledge.
---
If I find a scope or mod for a gun I shouldn't need science or gunsmith to apply it, I should need some screws and some gumption. If I want to craft said mod from scratch then yes science and gunsmith should absolutely be required. 
---
Don't think discussion of RMT is allowed here. It is definitely against Bethesda TOS, being caught will most likely result in a ban. 
---
Nope.. i was using a fully auto 45 combat rifle.. does 45 damage with mods.. i took commando on and off and there was no change.. i tried it with the fully auto 38 also and there was no change.. tried it on the 45 machine gun.. and the assault rifle 5.56.. no change at all.. i just made a 10mm smg.. and it changed the damage from 31 to 46 with the single star 3 commando cards.. 
---
I'm just taking the specific part you felt was necessary to bring to the table and wondering why you wouldn't have picked something more suitably lazy and uneducated than something that is demonstrably accurate.
---
haha i recommend u this thread [click](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/abn255/after_ignoring_the_stigma_surrounding_this_game_i/ed380d3/?context=3)

The one time my camp has come under attack I fast travel back to find the only thing destroyed was the port-a-john. Not sure what about it triggered that guy. 
---
Yeah I wear the red dress.  Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't.  And let's be clear:  a sequined red dress should always work.
---
What do the mining maps give? (the ones you can buy) 
---
Are you using a card that randomly gives your crit meter a boost?
---
Lever action rifle is better for mid range and close combat just outside shotgun effectiveness. I have been using the lever action extensively and have found that it has awkward bullet drop when shooting targets at long range that the hunting rifle would cover, which ruins it has a long range sniper weapon. On the flip side it has outstanding hip fire accuracy in stock form. I recommend the reflex sight or short scope. 
---
Try cleaning your cache it helps me sometimes

Play the game and sell loot to vendors, it‚Äôs not that hard, if you want to buy caps with caps to avoid having to play the game to get caps, how about you just save yourself all the money and not play the game at all.
---
*screech*
---
Hi, pizza for a wagenejm? Lucky I found the place, I found a shortcut by driving my truck through that plot hole back there.
---
Yes, I lose the caps. I'm at the cap limit though with nothing to spend them on.
---
Id rather use the 10mm as i can made 43 rds of ammo compared to the 21 of 45 
---
Lmao, its literally so easy to get caps and this mutation
---
I almost tossed my explosive shot gun cause I thought it was just a quad..then at the vendor noticed it had another effect yay explosive sure it‚Äôs not a two shot but hell 32 shots and explosive..I accept this.
---
Not like i have not wasted many hours for it, but i feel lucky having like 10 which are good. And no empath or egghed :D 
---
With strange in numbers its a different game. :D
---
That's a terrible idea, because let's face it people are dicks, it'd be abused. Though I'd be all for having the f76 promotional cartoons playing on the TV, kinda like the Nuka world ones. 
---
Huh, interesting.  I must've been playing each instrument in equal measure over time.
---
Annd thaaaan...
---
Not only that.i had my camp in the mire and my pet deathclaw lvl 21( can we even spawn it higher?) died at the first  attack of lvls 54.
---
Now i'm a spot where i get attacked by mob max lvl 22 but my yao guai still died,he was as stupid as geralt horse tho,i even found him on the roof of my barn.
---
I managed to revive them a couple of times by server hopping but it doesn't always work.
---
Bit late, found the thread through Google. Are you still able to craft a speed demon for 1k? I'm interested in buying! 
---
You're actually better off picking everything up and bulking the excess for sale to vendors. I stopped picking everything up and only picked up select things for a while, but then I started running out of the more common things and it was just as annoying mostly looking for those.
---
Picking up everything and selling the excess also helps you meet the 1400 vendor caps if you don't have enough time to play and pick up more valuable things.
---
It is balanced... TSE comes with the risk of suicide by explosion. The closer the enemy the worse it gets, just like melee.
---
Office buildings, type writers are the easiest way for gears
---
Sounds like you are pessimistically grinding that axe bro. Nah the event is kinda pretty fun regardless of what ya think. (Played some more today).
---
You are welcome to fear the next negative play experience but ill look forward to improvements and the current mode available. 
---
Difference in priorities though. I want my money to give me enjoyable experiences :p
---
Oh so T60 has improved movement speed?
---
I agree 100%! 
---
There's another one in the antique shop outside Watoga. 
---
They'll never release actual numbers but personally I feel less people are playing. There isn't a single person on my friends list who plays anymore. I dont know if that's a reflection of the game as a whole but I cant be the only one who's friends list of players who use to play this has shrunk. 
---
Nukes aren't working right now afaik
---
Sorry my bad, how much are stimpacks?
---
Sorry, let me give you some context. I got a Google news alert about the nuke bug this morning. Clicked an article, read some bullshit, then clicked through on another article about it, read some bullshit, then clicked through another article.
---
My rage built until I made this post and singled out the last article I read.
---
I do recall there was some talk at one point about non-protected containers. Where you could store items but any player could take them out. Since every container you can build is a stash I guess it was removed.
---
I finally found modern-age Napoleon.
---
Im in and waiting

I've seen him near West Tek as well.  I used the wrong gun to start shooting and he ran away before I could get a second shot in.

What happens if you  don‚Äôt have a ton of caps but keep destroying someone‚Äôs camp?

Yes I still craft. And I still sell them but dupers killed the market so now I sell them for 500. I also have a few other serums if ur interested I'll bundle them.

You need to tame it, not pacify. It's only possible on creature that 1. Spawn alone 2. Are a random spawn 3. Are at most half your level and 4. You have both AF and WW, with charisma above 6. Not only that, but once you tame it, it has to actually run to your camp on real time, and seeing as the highest level I've ever seen is a 21 DC, the chance it will die increases as the distance of your base does. I lost 3 sloths to harpers ferry, and made to move my base closer to the spawn location. 
---
Which shop did you go to?
---
That's called pushing a narrative and attacking it.
---
Bethesda isn't going to balance guns based on melee weapons.
---
Finally, my comeuppance has arrived!
---
You lose even more imaginary caps. Literally.
---
Sorry, but it‚Äôs up to you if what you say is any half truthful. You did post about the trade steal glitch and they asked you for some proof and let me guess they didn‚Äôt get back to you because it didn‚Äôt happen.
---
Servers full 
---
Four hours... you young pup....  
---
I gave up and just took all the mutations except for empath. Getting rid of just empath was the hard part.
---
Xbox?
---
Honestly doesnt sound too bad tbh.
---
Joining rn bro 
---
So you want everyone in fallout 76 to stop placing camps in  certain spot because you're too lazy to do one simple thing? Talk about being an entitled little crybaby
---
I know. I checked to see how much my missiles weigh since I questioned dropping them and it‚Äôd be worth it considering rocket launchers have been so weakened and I‚Äôm not focusing a build on them. I just can‚Äôt do it, it hurts to think about it
---
Yeah why is the PA flashlight so shitty? It makes me not want to use it and just wear regular armor.
---
ROFL
---
Also if they could not 1% target a level 60 scorched ant way over to my right when the scorchbeast queen is hovering directly in front of me that would be fab.
---
I've figured out floors and ceilings but how do you connect thru walls? I have the advanced connectors but can't go thru just around with curved pieces
---
Make me a reasonable offer , I can comfortably part with up to 50 stimpacks right now. I also have a few super stims
---
Federal Disposal Field HZ-21 3x Nuclear waste extractor sites + Grafton steel mill 2x double capacity steel extractor plus lead.. it's a time consuming process but just getting it all setup loaded me up on looted valuables and scrap and chems went through 6 events and various moderate value loot sites establishing both workshops Grafton has a lot of value as a workshop it has a frequently spawning low level horde of mutants that are great for scrapped steel and plastic depending if they drop a rifle or a laser and you can get 20+ frag nades from the battle if you're a grenadier I'm only just taking HZ-21 for the second time don't know it's true value yet.. getting both powerplants up for each site sucks on time but both offer nuclear waste extraction and Poseidon has lead.. all combined it's a pretty steady flow and a great spread of free jump sites to reduce travel cost around the map...
---
Voice acting is expensive and time consuming.
---
"Hnom" or "Hnom Sorry" or "Hnom Sorry on" 
---
I wish they'd just nerf the Tattered Dress so I wouldn't feel compelled to use it and I could feel free to dress up in other clothes.
---
... that's what I said to myself for a long time before realizing, the hell with it, I can just play as if Bethesda had already made that nerf. There's no reason for them to actually do so. 
---
And now I dress resplendently in all sorts of fabulous outfits. 
---
Gotta get that juicy tick blood to make stimpaks
---
I hope they reconsider or make that work sometime in the future. It would be nice to have the extra space for some of the non essentials.
---
No it's not safe. Its a bannable offense.
---
and craft 78 combat rifles 
---
Hnom
---
Yeah saw some other folks saying similar. Dunno. I only know one person irl that got PA edition but she just says it'll show up some day as a surprise cause she'll forget about. Don't think she really cares cause she just wanted her helm. Good luck.
---
Which one?
---
in one of the recent Bethesda email newsletters, they mentioned player vendors coming sometime this year, and there was also some pre-release footage of someone in build mode and there being a tab named Vendor 
---
So it‚Äôs pretty much like GARY
---
Only as a horse 
---
It might just be me.. but it seems like the whole online aspect backfired real bad as far as story telling goes. Any of you guys ever tell your friends to shut up so you can read a terminal? üòÇ
---
Rockstar games suck and are boring. Clunkiest piece of shit to control since Bubsy 3d.
---
You have to use the long vertical pipe with a piece that just out from the middle
---
The piece that extends away from the pipe is permitted to pass through a wall
---
I can make another short video if you need one
---
I farmed till i got 4 them bought the rest. 
---
Was speed demon, marsupial, egghead, twisted muscles.
---
I only kept going as egghead wasn't ideal so i was willing to wipe.
---
Are you on PC? Xbone controller drives me nuts in rocket league
---
I watch a lot of Big Bang Theory. I guess I am qualified to write an essay on string theory.   Fucking idiot.  
---
I guess, normally cheating is more of an issue for developers as it means player retention goes down due to having done "everything". Only in PVP does it matter for other players.
---
But duping in this game actually affects everyone, the dupers probably don't want to admit there's consequences for their actions. I've seen posters say it's all on Bethesda and dupers can't be held accountable that exploits and glitches exist in this game.
---
When are you on right now?
---
Lv.156 little bit to go before I can attempt it then I don't have the perks yet but definitely keen to have a play with them
---
Camp mcinlock is good for springs. Close to 40 clipboards in there.
---
Sugar grove is pretty good too with the added bonus of lots of desk fans.
---
Is there still no fix to this? I‚Äôm having the same issue...
---
Probably would, actually. It‚Äôd be funny to see them lose shit they were duping to sell. 
---
It was not a patch it was a hotfix
---
I honestly dont understand how this was an oversight that was allowed to pass to begin with lol. But this is desperately needed so I stop dropping my ultracite when I want my X-01 üòÇ
---
Don‚Äôt ever drop your pa unless you want to get rid of it. Never know when you will get dc‚Äôd. Always place it.  The atom symbol next to the pa in inventory usually means you have an atom store paint on it
---
I didn't need to be reminded both me and my Fallout character are in the same rut
---
Lv.156 atm little bit to go before I can attempt but keen to try once I have the perks
---
Hell yeah
---
All these Two Shot Explosive weapons should be nerfed if they want to balance the game in the slightest way lol period
---
Bringing lvl 3 rad sponge
---
Try turning graphics settings down and draw distance 
---
They're still overpowered though. Unless those get nerfed/removed, there is no legitimate claim to not have legendary hunting rifles
---
Uh so you can talk or not ?
---
Servers full :[
---
02/15/84
---
Why would they be dropping items on the ground? I keep reading this from these same exact stories. You guys need to realize the dupe doesn't have anyone dropping gear on the ground, they drop a stack of boards on the ground and the valuable stuff on a world container.
---
Also, even if you took the stuff from the container the dupers haven't lost anything. Once those items are put in the container the dupe is done.
---
Rockstar already has released GTA:O which was a microtransaction filled cash grab so its not shocking that RDR2:O is similar. Bethesda is usually not so shady though so this is more of a surprise 
---
My one worry is that they're gonna end up absolutely fucking over PvE for the sake of PvP balance. I've seen far too may game devs make that same mistake over the years *cough* Bungie *cough*.
---
I don't think 12 year olds can lawyer up.
---
Someone beat me to it let's hit it!
---
Fair enough.
---
Wait ... check AFTER everyone check. It seems when 2 or more people click on the body (not just SBQ) the items become shared between those people. 
---
You should treat it like the water fountain in elementary school... 1 at a time, 3 second limit, no one lick the spigot. 
---
Hah I saw that happen this afternoon and helped take it down.
---
What about console?
---
A buddy of mine and I take turns reading and explaining to each other the content of the tapes 
---
That way we can save our attention span and get to talk about the quests 
---
Mole miners have shotguns alot unknown they have pump shotguns and double barrel disk bout combat 
---
That would be why I wreck shit with my auto combat rifle with no commando perk cards equipped. Huh. 
---
I've just scrapped my brahmin pen for this reason. I've been repairing it \~10 times a day because people think they'll get meat from it.
---
Still need the Veil for that route.
---
I have been tempted to go back to FO1 and play through the series again. (Probably skipping tactics this time around lol)
---
Also may need to put the time in for hemlock holes for the acid if you don't have much to smelt the ore
---
Quite your bitching
---
I think this needs to be taken into consideration and cannot happen. This is a PVE game FIRST
---
Yeah. I got the excavator armor late with one of my characters and I don't think I ever actually used it. I used the crap out of it on my other characters when I got it at 25.
---
Spambeasts are terrible for almost all levels, especially if you don‚Äôt have one of few particular builds 
---
They work the same. I made the website.
---
The other thing I want to see is an M4. Not this "assault rifle" but an actual AR15. 
---
I'm a sneak build. A non-leg damage increase handmade does not oneshot much. If I can get a good damage boost handmade, might turn out correct and might just put aside all other weapons, but I have to get it first :)
---
I love the lever action. I have a scoped silenced hardened TSE lever I use for nukes and a two shot scoped silenced for regular travels. I would love a legendary hunting rifle as well but I have made due with the lever action and enjoy it immensely. 
---
It took me about 5+ hours to get mine....my husband got his on his first jump. Then when I was about to give up, he logged on because I needed him to pass something to my alt, and he was like "oh hey the witch is up on my server", loaded in...and got the plans. He got a second set of plans too...
---
I mainly use a Explosive 2 Shot Quad Double Barrel Shotgun, since lvl 60 or so (Lvl 152 now) and its still way to overpowered, with Skeet Shooter I can almost snipe with that beauty. Everything that gets close is dead in seconds lol. But it kinda ruins the game after a while..
---
For no key letters just enter a question mark.
---
Right now they're just adding the fallout 4 tattoos, the lucky 13, and bad luck tattoos are my favorite ironic combination.
---
Are you scrapping all the junk? 600 hasnt been so bad, used to be 400
---
nice!!
---
It's true i thought i'd get a bunch of replies saying how they want to be part of a legit community but this is reddit. They're all too busy grinding to do anything imaginative or different to their very basic and literal programming.
---
These idiots think Beth will actually ban anyone over exploits! What a bunch of mental midgets!
---
Not the point. 
---
Need me a friend like that üò©üëå
---
It especially gets real tricky with a whole squad, sometimes even 2 squads lol.
---
I usually train them into a bunch of mutants or local fauna, distract them enough to run and hide. 
---
The whole eastern side of the map is a high level area, I stayed away until about level 45 since a mirelurk queen wrecked my shit the moment I entered the Mire the first time. 
---
Like the other dude wrote, hit em molers up
---
LOL, you haven't even been playing the patched game and have been going off on how broken it is? You expect anyone to take you seriously on how much impact the latest updates have?
---
There is no time table for fixing bugs; first you have to reliable duplicate the issue, then you have to track down the cause, finally you have to find a way to fix said cause without causing other issues to the best of your ability.
---
It can take months for a simple bug fix to come out because finding the source or fixing it without making more bugs is difficult.
---
The only things that can be fixed within 24 hours 100% reliably are misplaced values, like a perk saying it gives +10% damage when player tests show it's only giving +1%. Even then, that assumes the 1% is a mistyped value, not a normal bug interfering with damage calculations. 
---
Up on the dpad brings up the assign wheel for weapons and items.
---
Much love &lt;3
---
Rad Sponge 2 will not work for me at all. It just unequips itself right away. Rad Sponge 1 works just fine. I don't want to waste a perk on Rad Sponge 3 to find out if it works or not, so I don't have an answer for that one.
---
Ah, interesting.  Thanks!
---
People hear online multiplayer and stupidly think it's an mmo or something, it's still a Fallout game and should be played like a Fallout game. 
---
Fine you can play how you want but don't come crying when you're lvl 150 in a week and have nothing to do and say the game is bad and lack content when you've said fuck to the content and just rushed lvls to "catch up".
---
There is tons of content if you play it like any other Fallout game.
---
Heads up as a sniper main. They fall off hard at 50
---
There are maps you can buy?
---
Your camp should be there. I always log out manually. If someone is in your camp spot, therefore not allowing your camp to be placed, then the game will give you the option to place it elsewhere for free, or try to re-log and attempt to place it in the original location.
---
Weapon is the left d-pad. You can open up the pip boy and select weapons. It alternates between the two most recently used weapons. You can set weapons and other items in the favorite wheel for more flexibility. Stimpak is always d-pad to the right. 
---
Its like 500-1000 caps my friend
---
Thanks for this. I got an anti armor vats crit damage western revolver but all of my builds come to the same conclusion.
---
I'm better off using a rifle modded for more crit damage plus tank killer to do what that revolver would do but better.
---
Were the new codes dicipered?
---
I would like to hear more.
---
Dont ever mention that dirty evil name anymore in here *shakes*
---
This would all depend on what you're playing on. Camp might have been stored as there may be another player's camp in the area. To favorite weapons, go into your pip boy and hit the right bumper (xbox) and a jeart should appear by it.
---
Pressing select opens your map. 
---
And the game should auto save at certain points, but no save game button exists, as it is a live game. 
---
What platform?
---
Yep. They got me partner.
---
"...And with that, he rode off on his high horse into the silhouette of the sunset."
---
Why does a comment where one voices his concern get downvoted?
---
This is why I have no turrets. I'd rather have a nice compound with three buildings and a farm. 
---
But seriously, *does anyone know anything about any launch coooodes?*
---
Yes most certainly! 
---
...you can solve your problem just by turning on the pacifist mode and you rather keep destroying things? Just throw in a molotov and let the turrets do the rest
---
Whats the xp glitch now? Ill check it
---
Yes! Had to run to get food real fast
---
3 days for me...then i bought serums
---
..fuck rng
---
You can't at all, currently.
---
Combat shotguns show up more later. I think i was lvl 20-25 before i started to see them often. Higher level scorched will have them but no great places to farm.
---
As for the accidental stim packing. Best i can tell you is to avoid hitting right on your d-pad.
---
And make sure you dont have that perk activated that makes you autostim when your health is low
---
Scrap and don't keep stupid amounts on each material and you have no issue at all.
---
When you dropping the nuke 
---
What time is that EST?
---
K who do I add then ?
---
PS4
---
Just stand in something that gives rads, and wait for it. Keep in mind you can only get like 1 mutation ever 30 minutes unless you server hop (at least from my husband and friends experiences) you can also save your caps and buy them for about 3.9k (with hardbargain and only 3 charisma) from the Enclave vendor.
---
Efll
---
I think you confused what is meant by shared inventory.
---
Shared inventory means if we are on the same server together and I buy something from the vendor, then the vendor no longer has it when you try to buy from the same vendor on the same server.
---
So if you server hop and the server you are randomly placed on has a vendor where someone else already bought the shocks from the vendor, its going to already be gone on that server, etc.
---
Thanks for that info, good to know.
---
You can always fast-travel to that tent icon on your map for free if you get turned around, your camp and the Vault 76 entrance cost nothing to travel to.
---
Pumps are found on Scorched all around Morgantown Trainyards and Airport, I believe.  
---
I know what you mean. I actually have an explosive shotgun but I tend to use the Tesla rifle just to allow everyone a tag and I never miss out on enemies üòã
---
What's ironic here is that you're being a little cry baby since my opinion differs from yours. You act like I'm asking Jesus to walk on water when all I'm saying is there are plenty of areas in whitesprings that don't affect other players. Besides, these aren't camps they're stairs with wooden planks filled with missle turrets. 
---
Bulk scrap what you can and if you have power armor frames, store the pieces on the frame before you put it in the stash.
---
I just realized I‚Äôm farming the wrong thing. 
---
I should hand my caps to a team mate, offload junk, and go farm those damn back door bases. 
---
That‚Äôs the Pic of the week I lost it, dead
---
Bulk the junk that you have excess of. Sell it for caps. You‚Äôre level 21 and have a level 45 piece of armour or weapon? Sell it. You don‚Äôt need it for a while anyway. That level 10 single action that was always at your side? You‚Äôre level 50 now. Let go of it. You only rarely use the rocket launcher? Sell. That. Thing. 
---
Seriously. I know I‚Äôm probably sounding like a dick, but hoarding everything you find isn‚Äôt how you play this version of Fallout. 
---
Refunds on Boxing day are like that.
---
Most places don't do it
---
Wow it's amazing that you're the first person to state this... I don't want the turrets to do the rest. I have fun killing the good. 
---
Gotta have multiple cannons for it to truly be effective. More cannons means longer barrages. One cannon is three or four shots, I believe. I've got enough cannons set up for a good couple of minutes worth of artillery. It's beautiful. 
---
Yeah the first time falling into water in a mine with a mole miner stuck in a wall nearby (no fast travel), not having a head piece yet (no light), and never really finding a spot where I was allowed to exit the armor.
---
The second time falling into water in a mine (there‚Äôs a pattern here...), getting out of the armor, radiation lowering me to about 15% health, and killed by mole miners on whatever sunless shore I found.
---
After this I decided if I‚Äôm basically 100% power armor user anyway I might as well wear a hazmat suit before entering the armor.
---
Wait. That's why I found a drill?
---
Trying to join but not letting me if you want to Invite me it's SEANZY 123
---
Yep alpha for sure confirmed
---
I have a much much much minor problem but it's the same thing on their end. In regards to the canvas bag thing I got this reply on the 11th.
---
"Greetings!

---
Still haven't heard anything more. They can't even manage their own estimate of a couple days to credit an account with their own made up currency. I think they forgot except I sent another reply a week later (on 17th) asking about it and it's still just "waiting on agent" as status. Bethesda just has no follow through, they say they do stuff and just never finish.
---
"...I messaged two of them telling them they forgot their boards, cue panicking and my laughter."
---
How did you message them?
---
Lead marine armor and rad shield probably work
---
Switched my out this afternoon and used it once the nukes started falling. It‚Äôs money. 
---
Perks, lead lined armor with legendary rad resist, rad-x
---
Tracking Unknowns
---
But you can only lay down two mines at a time I thought? Or is it different for nuke mines? When I lay down three frag mines, the first one goes off after laying the third. 
---
So you come here, to the Fallout 76 subreddit to make a post about something that has nothing to do with the game at all? Sorry but you are hoping for what to happen here? 
---
Basically everything is on low and I can hardly stay on 60fps,with a 1060 mini 6gb,feels like an early access sometimes &gt;_&gt;‚Äù
---
Radshield &amp; Diluted rad x plus glowing blood if you need mutations
---
Plus rad x if you can have mutations suppressed
---
Please note, these stacks still fucking suck, as hazmat and pa have hidden resists, you'll still take like 10rads a sec min
---
When I get home in an hour I got you 300 caps a pop. I got Marsupial, electrically charged, talons, twisted, herd, adrenal, and speed demon. Let me know what you need 
---
I'm pretty sure you get like a 50% damage debuff for a few hours or something when you die.
---
Thanks! I got this plan but couldn't figure out how to get my moo moo! 
---
We‚Äôre can I get rad shield plans? Also would having lead any armor work to or does marine armor already give rad resist on top of the lead?
---
The first dupe method was to craft 300 boards. Bethesda made it so you can only craft 255 boards into a stack while at crafting station. Using a super powerful calculator the dupers figured out how to subtract 255 from 300 and just dropped the remaining boards before carrying on.
---
This time they patched it for sure. You can only craft 254 items now. Dupers will never solve this riddle.
---
(LS)
---
Bulk only saves weight for aluminium and lead afaik.
---
Ty
---
Pretty sure any leaded armor would work and radshield is from doing freestates missions I believe normal rad-x probably work too.
---
Megasloths do it too, which is hilarious because they're enormous. 
---
Oh look gamesradar is the new cnn. Nothing but lies.
---
Let‚Äôs see if he drops a synth part. 
---
Lol, so thats YOU taking my spot after server hops! Hahaha
---
Or just take whatever armor set has the most pieces and call it that. Excavator frame. If one has 4 pieces of t-51 and 2 t-45, ‚Äút-51 frame‚Äù
---
I was aware the last fix made it so you could only craft around 250ish. So you're saying all they did on this fix was lower the number again? How the fuck did they think that'd fix it now when it didn't before?
---
I just want to emphasize for those that only use power armor, the perk system lets you spec for no PA. So when non PA people are forced to go into nuke zones it's just not fun, and feels like yet another oversight. The game encourages this playstyle until it doesn't and that's frustrating. 
---
It's true, they're my caps to waste. And to answer your question one leads to the other, if you have a base of only turrets and I hit one, they all agro on me. Then you have the missle turrets that kill the ghouls as soon as they spawn and you have a chance to tag. IDK why it's so hard for you to understand what we're saying here. 
---
That's it.  You get a cool hazmat suit and the pyrolizer as a reward don't you?
---
Ur theory is wrong
---
Does rad-x and rad shield stack?
---
Damn I just bought speed and marsupial from a guy for 750 each...could still use healing factor. I'd also want herbivore if you ever get that 
---
Find lookout towers, climb to the top and activate the scenic view; you'll get a bunch of new locations on tour map. Start exploring! 
---
Also, how about All Night Long? I couldn't tell you how long I was using that perk thinking it was making it take longer for my thirst and hunger to increase, when in actuallity it just makes the negative effects less, when you are suffering from them. I mean, I guess I just misread it, but it could be worded better.
---
No idea seems another poster has a better idea of it.
---
Gets them a bounty fast.  Also some do it because of where you build and/or what you build. 
---
And others have fun letting their turrets kill them...
---
Thank you for your incite. The reply to this is when people take from the world containers a lot of players will drop a Bobby pin on the ground and then they will drop their entire bag on the ground and the person will reload into the game of the same unstable server and can then redupe those exact items and the more they can pick up into their inventory then the faster they can redupe those items. 
---
10 x 7 = 70 x 2 is 140 versus 10 x 1 x 2 = 20. Do you understand now? 
---
I'm not being rude, I'm just trying to educate you on time management.
---
Can you message me the discord?
---
I just like to raid 
---
Son of a bitch, alright lets do it again. I froze with 1/3 health left, she was dead by the time I got back in, didnt get any loot
---
yes
---
I donjabe carnivore. I'm suppose to be buying the rest of the recipes tonight but my seller hasnt gotten back to me in a few hours. Add me on xbox, AngelOfDeath116 we can work something out and I'll get you everything you need
---
I shot someone's camp yesterday.. Honestly it was out of pure boredom.. I apologize stranger. 
---
Scratch that just got healing factor randomally.  So just need herbivore if you ever get it 
---
Same here. Doing the "scan and repair" option on the launcher to see if it helps. I'll edit this post after.
---
1 minute 45 seconds from event start to end. https://clips.twitch.tv/RefinedBetterCoffeeMau5 less than 30 seconds after she landed.
---
Radshield suppresses mutations now as an fyi.
---
Last patch changed it
---
Why?
---
Nah the fix they did was made it to where you can‚Äôt pick up the ones you drop with others in your inventory that would put u over 300. The new work around is to drop the 50 next to the 250 so it combines into one bag then Pick it up
---
Tried it. This isn't enough. Rad scaling is broken for regular armor.
---
Some people just want to set the world on fire........  
---
also are you sure it is other players and not just mobs?  
---
It's fine when they're around, and I'm not talking about that. Why keep turrets aggroing ghouls when you're not around. It doesn't benefit you in any way. So explain how that's fun? Is it the inconvinience of others that makes your willies wobble?
---
They don't work.
---
They aren‚Äôt having NPCs 
---
I see. I bought the game after that.
---
That is a really weird way of doing business. Did they think it would be nice to do as Fortnite? But if that was the case, shouldn't they add interesting things more often and remove all that crap they are selling right now?
---
Anyway, most of that datamined items are as crappy as the current ones (some are already on the shop), with exception of the blackbird, a few weapon paints and a few cloths (in my opinion). So, not too much anxious for the next updates on the shop actually...
---
We use an ancient technique to grab attention and have some silence when too many speak at once 
---
Scream ‚ÄûSILENCE‚Äú and immediately drop a grenade at their feet. after a short laughter you got their attention - works all the time 
---
(This technique is not to be used on RL though I can also guarantee it also works) 
---
Preach.. And good perks in intelligence.. 
---
I mean, yeah you could probably find a big piece of fabric and throw it on the ground. 
---
I wish we had the option to grab furniture from abandoned places and lug it back to our camp. Stuff like chairs we could do solo but a couch you'd need a few friends. It would weigh a ton and you'd be overencumbered and lose some special points while carrying it.
---
and might have to end up dumping it to fight something. but that would be so immersive lol!
---
They have. It's on the Bethesda plz retired topics list 
---
[happened to me too](https://i.imgur.com/QVQU77A.png)
---
That‚Äôs unfortunate. Guess we can assume they won‚Äôt advance the world any. 
---
Maybe they just farm loot? Come back and collect with no effort. 
---
Thanks all
---
You guys both seem to think that powerful guns means TSE. 
---
TSE isn‚Äôt a powerful gun. It‚Äôs an unaimable spray and pray mess that eliminates the ability to put more than 5% of the of the rounds in a mag into your target in full automatic, as an elegant, disciplined weapon would. 
---
It‚Äôs massively overrated. 
---
You can use them to build to the ground (at least in some spots, only for aesthetically fixing "floating" things)
---
The overseer's cache at her camp is great, too.
---
Like others said, use Pharma Farma. Also, save every blood pack you find. When you get the stimpak recipe, you'll need them, steel, and antiseptic to make. Combine with chemist and super duper. 
---
It'll be a long time before you run out. 
---
Brahmin Pen Brahmin don‚Äôt drop any loot when killed.

---
Sorry. I should have mentioned I was joking. 
---
Dupe here before you complete said act, problem solved. No dating game issues. In fact, dupe as many as you like.
---
Some of the weight reducing perks should be merged. There's far too many taking up far too many perk cards and it gets really bad for stuff like rifle/pistol builds who don't take STR.
---
They haven't even patched anything in two weeks are you an idiot?
---
Welcome to the online world.
---
I don't know for sure but I think it was the Appalachian Radio that was making my game crash, after I turned it off my game was fine (minus the occasional disconnection from servers but I think that is pretty normal). 
---
But its a Rust clone tho.
---
Equally broken , being released in early access with mcrotransactions, base building, dry out content and forced online.
---
Fallout 76 is a pure definition of a "Rust clone".
---
Its laughable that this is just another sweet, sweet lie of Todd.
---
Technically you have 3000 due to 5 characters (or more if you don't use the 4). 
---
issue is, there is no shared stash to xfer stuff so you need either a very trusted friend or 2nd account. 
---
They might just do that.
---
I spent half an hour the other day trying (and failing) to give plans to low level players.
---
*takes notes in marsupial*
---
The whole two shot explosive thing is also super expanded by the whole duplication thing too. I don't have one either, but there shouldn't be websites where people can sell 20+ two shot explosive weapons for over $100. It's supposed to be a super rare legendary that makes you feel like you finally gotten a really rare powerful weapon, but when you go into a nuked zone and find almost everyone but you with one, it's a little ridiculous. The game is oversaturated with them now.
---
My stuff is on low with texture on medium. I have a x4 860k, 16gb ram, and a rx 570 8gb oc edition. And I get 30 fps
---
I know this will sound weird, but I swear this is true. On the combat rifle, going to a long barrel instead of the default short barrel saves .7 of a pound. I know that‚Äôs weird, but I swear it‚Äôs true. I also think it‚Äôs true on the hunting rifle. This is also only true if they are both default barrels with no other affects.
---
I think it should be too... but you can get rid of pack rat in late game anyway (or before if you like) as you will generally only be picking up what you need.
---
I have 1 point in Endurance, and I only have it because you are unable to have a SPECIAL slot with zero points in it. 
---
dc‚Äôd?
---
You need one of those.
---
There was a thread on here where they stacked rad res on gear and actually surpassed x01 power armour.
---
Still suffered 10 rad per sec vs 2.

when people were getting banned for "third party programs" rumor started that mods were getting people banned, but a community manager came out and said "if you think you've been banned for mods, contact the bethesda helpdesk and we'll review it. we're not banning people for mods."
---
Where is your camp located?  I only attack camps as a rule if they're in certain places obstructing or otherwise conflicting with what i'm doing.
---
I don't think you get loot when your not around to instance it. 
---
I feel you, current level is 53, but I read and listen to everything i find. I spend a lot of time alone and enjoyed the lower levels of, "Oh Shit, weapon broke, run!" Side note: being super sneaky is a LOT more difficult in this one.
---
At most mining sites are "U-Mine-It" vendors. You can buy maps from cheapest to most expensive: Mining Map, Prospector's Map, Excavator's Map.
---
Consuming these start quests to a dig site. I have a few of these and treasure maps but I'm only level 45. Since Treasure maps scale to level, I thought mining maps might to, so I've been saving them until I get to 50.
---
No idea i never tried i just farm there with molotovs and let others do the killing
---
Oh! A work bench could work too then. The wouldn‚Äôt have to worry about the PA then maybe?
---
You dont get muted for saying fuck. If so I would have been muted back in 2008.
---
If you are going to be a vigilante, I hope you have done the Mistress of Mysteries questline, and are dressed appropriately.
---
If they accelerate this service-as-a-game to an early demise then I guess they can't be all that bad
---
No... that is the method people use when they are alone, not in a group like you said. Nice try.
---
I'm a Gahm man myself, friendly super mutants are always fun. Rose tries way too hard to be "whacky", not to mention her being in a Mr. Handy with that personality makes no sense, she really should've been a robo-brain. and if I had to hear that level 7 bot threaten my one more damn time...‚Ä¶.

I have a tendency to have a lot of .50, so if I am doing some junk runs and whitesprins runs i use the .50 because I can make a billion bullets cheap and can usually one shot them with it. I will use the .308 for harder instances
---
Cries in unarmed.
---
It does seem really sad that when I make a build, I always try to find a reason to have more than 1 END in it and always come up wanting.  There really isn't much there for someone looking to maximize their QoL or their effectiveness in combat.
---
Usually just raiders being raiders.  Could also be stray gunfire from people shooting mobs that spawned near your camp.
---
Nope your right.
---
I agree and that‚Äôs the point I‚Äôm trying to make. There is better Legendary rolled guns that can be more effective in PVP. 
---
What Melee PVPers blame on TSE. Will have the same issue going against a god rolled Gun.
---
Sorry, no. Google the folks that clitched into the vaults.
---
They lowered it by 1. Dupe still works exactly the same as always.
---
That was awesome, thanks! 
---
Thanks for this!
---
Go find Garrahan Mining and Camden Park. The park gives you a short quest, but Garrahan Mining gives you a new quest that looks long. 
---
I‚Äôm in your same spot too. I‚Äôve been grinding for better gear for a bit. 
---
I did the same thing. The guy was putting duped stuff into the first aid box near vault76 with the banjo and mouth harp. I found 600,000 grape nuka colas. I took them all, walked into the woods and dropped them all in a bush. 
---
Duping does not require a pair of players to be together. From what I've seen, it's typically done outdoors since the duper will quickly become overweight and they cannot spawn indoors when they log out and back in.
---
Even if you take their items, they're not REALLY losing anything since everything is duped straight into their own inventory. Just a few more minutes and they will be able to dupe it all again.
---
More like jumping the broadsider
---
Thanks for clarifying 
---
Get a team. Share radsponge.
---
It means you put a paint from the atomic shop on your power armor.
---
For spoilers, read below.
---
Vault 96 had 6 inhabitants. Their design was to release wildlife into the wasteland in cycles until the other Vaults opened. It went poorly. Mirelurks, Radscorpians and etc had mutated for whatever reason and had killed all 6 residents.
---
This likely explains why we have some of the wildlife in Appalachia. This Vault is also the most complete, so changes are possible for the other two.
---
Vault 64 had a reactor meltdown. While it is possible some lived, I'm guessing all are dead, especially as mole miners have somehow made their way in through tunnels.
---
Vault 94 had reopened 1 year after the bombs dropped, and ingame lore implies all had died after the vault exploded, releasing much of the mutated plant life you see dotting the area.
---
The whole game is, yes
---
Hell yeah 
---
When Im trying to get the wandering responder vendor to spawn, I will destroy any base thats by the pond and therefor blocking the spawn for me and others.
---
In normal daily gaming sessions, I will shoot (only shoot once, not destroy) any base I come across so that I get a bounty. Adds a little unpredictability to the game, and occasionally get some little PvP battles out of it that end up being fun and me running away from people with the "Help me" emote being spammed. You make your own fun in this game.
---
Witchcraft!  How does this work?
---
Good character idea! I have done the quest,but have scrapped the attire. I do believe the garb could send a non-verbal message to the perps.
---
Just because there isn‚Äôt stuff in vaults as of right now. Doesn‚Äôt mean there will not be with some updates.
---
Though I do know one Vault is a Raid Vault.
---
I don't mind that they did this but id still rather have real npcs.
---
i agree.. i mean when i use them in real life i can hold them steady fairly easily
---
Lol you're going to steal duped items from dupers and that makes you a "vigilante" haha what fucking world do I live in. I guess 32 is just too old to exist anymore haha. I don't know if this is funny or pathetic or what... Hahahahahaaa
---
There will be NPC‚Äôs brought to the game world. There wasn‚Äôt any at launch for the story of the game.
---
There are too many posts, so this may have already been said, but they need an explosive damage resistance perk. I don't have anything eplosive, but my brother runs and explosive build and is constantly killed by his autogrenade launcher. They need something like "Hit the Deck" from New Vegas.
---
pro tip: never preorder
---
Nothing.
---
Lots of kids are having fortnite withdrawal and can‚Äôt stop swinging that sledge, I guess... 
---
With this new patch duping has increased to almost 20 times a minute!
---
I mean what do they unlock 
---
Bobbleheads should be made desirable. I get that they want Bobbleheads to be consumable, but an hour is really not long, which makes them feel not special. I think they should last 24 hours. I could see people being excited about saving them then... you'd pop them on days you expect to play a long time and get some important stuff done.
---
There are a few QoL improvements I can imagine that would also be gameplay nerfs. For instance, get rid of the +1 Per on the Tattered Dress so that all clothing is cosmetic. 
---
Also, and more contentiously, I think the best way to handle the annoyance of reslotting hacking and lockpicking and crafting perks is not to make them permanent passives, as this post suggests and which would be a huge buff... I think that you should be able to reassign perks only once every 24 hours (or when leveling up). That'd be a big nerf but would make builds more strategically interesting and would be a huge QoL improvement, because the hassle of constant reslotting would go away. 
---
Bought end of November... Well within their 30 day return window. They must have monkeys working customer service
---
DONT STOP PLAYING A GAME CUZ REVIEWS MOST OF THEM ARE OUT FOR THE AD REVENUE.  HATE.GETS.CLICKS.
---
They can block off access to areas with their camps? I'm not familiar enough with the area to picture what you mean from what you said.
---
Nothing. Seriously. I bought them and it didn't u lock anything. I even bought them twice. They don't show up as a build able thing.
---
They did, a community manager did, we spoke in PMs. Enough said. 
---
Well, I know what I‚Äôm doing the next time I change my CAMP! Thanks!
---
You can (and imo should) have both.

There's a lvl 143 and 139 staying in one area if your on xbox you might want to check it out

PipBoy from Fallout76, chief.
---
And correct me if I'm wrong but some Bethesda employees post here, so maybe they see it.
---
Fallout 76: Attack of the Clones
---
I like the sniper outfit and the nuka girl one I picked up the grognak rag thing for my melee build. There's some there. 
---
You can buy serums from people on the market for 500-750ish caps. Id suggest planning what you want, saving,b uying them, and being done with it.
---
Theory: 2019 is the year you and your family find a vault and lock yourselves the fuck away.
---
I agree to some extent, I started playing like a fallout game and quickly realized that I was scavenging for nothing, the stash cap was too low, forcing me to go do content and level. No real trading or selling, cap limits on merchants etc took a lot of steam out of my sails. That and everything being these instanced events it seems like an etch a sketch, whatever impact you make is almost instantly gone. Investigating some building and have to take a break? Start all over again from outside, but this time the enemies are twice your level. Get to the end of a quest and the stash is...empty or even worse you somebody killed the guy and you have to jump servers just to finish a quest.
---
To me the story is Fallout, the game is not.
---
People like to grief 
---
Bringing in lawyers will always be last resort. But maybe they're just backed up with requests? I'm giving them the benefit of the doubt here
---
I wonder how many of people from this thread are still playing and defending Bethesda , hehe.
---
I think reloading quick saves to see there‚Äôs never truly a good outcome from those showdowns between humans and their double (depending on the companion) was one of the most memorable things from FO4. 
---
U got pip boy games 
---
I agree.
---
Yes! I actually thought it would be a default setting. A nuke = map wide rad storms as the fallout of it.
---
One day? I've been in contact with support since the 11th of November. But yeah let's all just be angry to find anything to be angry about. 
---
For gears, Miner Suit Scrap from Mole Miners is good. Also, grab every adjustable wrench (not combination wrench) you find. 
---
It‚Äôs pretty counterintuitive that the beefy character who likes to hit enemies with a sledgehammer is the one who struggles to carry all his gear around!
---
Unless Bethesda patched it, they don't get XP from turret kills but they can loot turret kills. It's why they do it, they are maximising their tag pool to increase their amount of loot.
---
I am a low level casual but I keep up on Fallout video content.
---
I saw a video guide very early on about farming legendaries from Apoqsi and he does tell you it's not good for XP farming but a camp and missile turrets at some (front or back) door is a good legendary farm.
---
They run through the building to aggro everything and head to the door and then the turrets take care of everything and then they loot all the corpses.
---
Sounds like you're an expert on duping...
---
I was messing around while building completely on water and found you can plant plants in between floor tiles. These are those second floor pieces not foundation. You have to position it just right. I just slowly moved the plant along the border while spinning until it turned green.
---
Oh, I understand for the help I almost wasted caps it must be unfinished then
---
It's on an empty farm near Posideon Power Station, near to the trader. 
---
Im enjoying any bit of fun PvP I can get by running with a (albeit small) bounty every day.
---
Can you explain what the scenario is for Hunter/Hunted? Ive queued before but noone came.
---
Do you get a quest marker for the other players, like how does it work exactly
---
I saw him and tried to kill the mule and steal his shit. Unfortunately you can't. 
---
Yeah, I am. I may take you up on that if I can't get it done soon. 
---
That‚Äôs basically all I do to fuel my 1200 cap vendor rotation every day. 
---
Thanks, headed there tonight.
---
Seems like an acceptable amount of bugs huh.  Get off your fucking high horse.  I was hoping they were fixing one of the many other issues that have plagued the game since launch, but nope...  I get to wait even longer to play the game I wasted my money on.
---
Well that's just dumb. 
---
If you havent received your 500 atoms I would contact them again. If you get no response well then it looks like we're on the same page 
---
I saw two low  LVL people together yesterday, obvious dupers. I followed them for 3 hours as they ran around looking for a good dupe hideout location. 
---
Interesting, same problem here, ALSO a 1080ti zen 2700x..
---
Okay bro invite me Twas a Ploy when you‚Äôre about to drop the Nuke 
---
Nice.
---
My friend and I are going to place camps on opposite sides of these guys that like to place their homes at the back door. we're gonna simultaneously shell it with artillery and mininukes.
---
It's a cosmetic variant of the bed
---
Thanks for the tip! I got some help this morning and beat that pain of a Wendigo!
---
So if I had my base say... right next to a trader - this might provoke people to destroy it because the trader won't respawn while I'm on the server?
---
Sounds like it's more just a product of those filthy Raiders!!!  Join the Order of Mysteries and put a stop to those scum!
---
Still counts as a 2h though
---
Mate, they were on vacation and just got back. Give them another week.
---
Couldn't agree more. Way too many overpowered two shot explosive duplications going around. I don't want to cheat and would feel better if I could earn a really good legendary myself. However, too many people are super impatient and just buy the two shot explosives. Some guy actually tried to peddle me his two shot explosives for real money and claimed he had a guy getting them for him and he didn't know how. Really? You have a guy getting you a bunch of two shot explosive legendaries and you don't know how? I call bullsh*t. I have a double tesla rifle and a two shot plasma rifle, both of which I found and they can't come anywhere near the damage of anyone with those explosive legendaries.
---
Honestly the smear campaign is a certainty in my eues at this point. I suspected during the beta but wasn't 100% convinced. I'm not pointing fingers but the only thing in the same window I can see it threatening is rdr2.
---
Great read. Thanks OP
---
It does
---
That happened to me too bro lost my trusty pump action 
---
What ? Take off your armor and swim up?
---
I'm sure it was players on 2 occasions. Once because I ported back and said hi, and the other because literally every single item was destroyed. Which by the way - is super cheap to repair. I think it was all common scrap except for 2 aluminium. 
---
Store it client side. Retain actual inventory server side, just have names stored by the client.
---

You can place most things on the very very edge of a floor tile.

I think it's the small white military bed in C.A.M.P.

if you're still in need of help, I need the trophy as well!

You know its players and not NPCs? Mine gets shot all the time by scorched

For springs sugar grove, easy 30-40 springs

That makes so much sense shouldn't be the hardest fix but I'm also not a programmer
---
if you still need help, I could use to get the trophy as well! PSN is BatmanFreak
---
Scrap handmades 
---
Ya because it's real difficult to watch a YouTube video. 
---
I think a player should be able to build his base wherever the fuck he wants.
---
Weight reducing perks are not a good mechanic. It's a broken system.
---
Sounds great, then I dont want to hear them cry and message me when I fuck it up. 
---
Can't tell if this is serious or a joke about an overactive detective sneaking around after two new players looking for good CAMP locations...
---
Every server is packed tho. 
---
You have to use spoiler tags to make your SPOILER NOT VISIBLE.
---
That's really impressive.
---
Every time I see it I'm so tempted to just sit there and keep closing the doors.
---
They could be racking up a bounty to encourage players to PVP them, because raiders.
---
Bless your soul! Happy Nuking!
---
You should be able to kill a scorch beast. I killed one at level 35 and not all my damage perks. Def looks like ur build focus is pretty spread u def don't need the melee perks.
---
:‚Äô( 
---
we are brothers now.
---
 Very cool.
---
No, sorry I wasnt clear
---
I was referring to a random (and rare) vendor spawn. The area directly beside Charleston train station (near Poseidon power plant) has a chance to spawn a rare vendor among other things, and this will not happen if a CAMP is in the area.
---
..but in a general sense, some people shoot up bases for seemingly no reason. Where is yours?
---
haha I see, that's kind of funny
---
There's an actual feedback comment thread pinned in this subreddit that they have stated they do read. So these should honestly go there, but I'd be genuinely surprised if they don't also catch high profile suggestions like this on the main subreddit. 
---
Synth hater

That‚Äôs why I posted it as a post. It probably won‚Äôt be seen in the feedback comments
---
So does my mute friend, and pretty much every pc player. 
---
It amazes me they launched without this basic feature. 
---
But hey, they launched without the ability to rebind keys...so yeah. 
---
Came across that last night n my glob did that give me a fright 
---
Yeah I'm legit gonna nicely post this weekly to show people want this. Even if it gets 2 likes.
---
Yeah Feedback tends to get buried in the flood of bug reports that thread is filled with, so I can't fault you there. 
---
It wouldn't work.  
---
You can get so much weight reduction with some of the legendary armors that dupers will have no problem staying unencumbered.  
---
I just had something like 95% reduced junk weight for thousands of bulk i picked up off what i assume was a duper or a mule for a team.  Wasn't over encumbered because I have literally just one piece of legendary armor that reduces junk weight and stacks well with pack rat.
---
Yep
---
I'm 30. Nice try. I do extensive reading and watching. 
---
The big thing that I appreciate about the truly dedicated members of the Fallout community... besides our fixation with skin-tight blue jumpsuits... is the lengths that they will go to with providing assistance, advice, and just plain *fun* for everyone; case in point here indeed.  Thank you for your input Mephistote!

Found some in the area a couple days ago they were drop trading between them for some reason I spam picked up all their bags and left the server ended up with a few hundred of bulk everything and 250 TSE shotguns and 10K nuke colas, scrapped the shotguns and began handing out the rest of the stuff to random low levels 
---
For god sake there is nothing wrong with the black powder rifle or lever animation. You complained multiple times. These are just the animations. Old musket rifles use to take a full minute to reload. 8 seconds is reasonable. The lever is already being reworked. Stop bitching about it. Sheesh. 
---
Thank you. This guy!
---
Only a damage reduction against players 
---
Nice, love your driveway
---
what kinda enemies bother you out that way?
---
Ps4 here and I would love a text chat. I have my keyboard all ready to go.

You, I like you.....
---
They tried to have some kind of gathering at Whitesprings where people could take photos.  It was hit-and-miss, apparently.
---
Don't normally comment on camp posts but I think they are so great because we are all so proud of what we manage to scrap together. This is fantastic and I love it. I am not much of a builder so I like to get inspiration from others. Your place looks so weird inside and out compared to what I am able to come up with, and I love seeing how people appropriate pre-existing locations.
---
Power armor, as designed, is very much not supposed to be worn at all times. You're actively forced out of it to do certain tasks, and it requires resources (admittedly minimal) just to use. So yes, you should be able to store it effectively because it's not intended to be in use at all times. 
---
Lost thousands of bulk junk because i was afk.  Maybe a i deserve it but dang.  Still hurts.
---
Simply would not work.
---
&gt; Using super carry glitches still registers as overencumbered, despite glitch, so damage curbs that glitch until it can be fixed.
---
It using super carry glitches registered as overencumbered, then the super carry glitch would be fixed.
---
They should make normal weapons stronger and slightly reduce explosive perks, then add other types of dmg like previously mentioned
---
Very nice camp, thanks for sharing!
---
Can give you 6 confirmed duper gamer tags if you need some to ‚Äúhunt‚Äù on Xbox. 
---
It should be cross platform and they could implament it very intuitively 
---
There is your problem. There's a rare spawn that happens RIGHT at your farm. That little ambient cabin with the small pond spawns a robot trader that sells a really rare clothing item. If a CAMP is there the event is disabled. You're frustrating people spending hours logging in and out of the spot on top of your base.
---
Definitely move.
---
You know what would also be cool? Showing what armor you are wearing under the power armor so you don't have to exit to avoid accidentally selling what you are wearing. Renaming Armor in General. Selling/scrapping/leveling up Legendary armor.    
---
I thought that was some kind of compost pile! I‚Äôm getting a pet cow of my own after work tonight!

Why? he just socially engineered you to do the work for him
---
Yeah, I put another message on that ticket to get it back in my "recent tickets" list. A ticket should not be removed from that list if it's still in the "awaiting response from agent" status. If they take so long to reply that it's no longer a "recent" ticket, they're fucking up.
---
That code is wrong. The code was just posted on nukacrypt.
---
This is where my base is...
---
I been trying to mostly keep it under ground. It's so nice since it has so many spawns inside. But it lacks water and a junk heap. What do you have those floors snapped to at the ceiling level (ground level)? I been making floating walls and using the ceiling/roof as the floor. Since floors don't snap to foundations.
---
How about energy weapons damage just sucking in general.. for supposedly end game weapons (true in any previous fallout) the seem pretty lack luster
---
&gt;I honestly dont understand how this was an oversight that was allowed to pass to begin with lol.
---
Just this one? 
---
Oh yeah, if you‚Äôre on xbox, I would be willing to join this posse of vigilantes. I know of one other who looks for dupers too, he‚Äôll gladly join us. 
---
I agree. If I'm that strong how come everyone else can carry way more then me?
---
True. I consistently gather extra materials for my brothers 40 mm grenades and actually run out stash space and end up just crafting the grenades, because I consistently have over 400 of  these items, just from exploring. I think the problem is people just don't like the tedium of the "scrounging" aspect of the game, even though it's exactly as it was intended.
---
Is that the one by the bridge? I gave up on that spot.

Dunno all the uses but it works with lights ( changing colors/on and off) and garage door

Is it the atom symbol? Do you have a paint job from the atom store?

I would guess, as I have no clue what you are talking about, it is would just be a different way to play the holotape games.

PVP balance issues can all be solved by negating legendary effects.  Simple, done.  No downsides to this approach that I can think of.

---
I just want to be a ghoul. 
---
Came to post this. I got them, couldnt find them anywhere in the CAMP menus.. good to see its not just me
---
Honestly...this sub is way too petty and pathetically immature when it comes to people duping. Sorry you had such a bad experience from those who consider themselves holier than thou
---
Kaboooooom!
---
I went in all 3 yesterday for fun.
---
It's safe to assume they are all similar "raid" content. Without spoiling, each has a layout that's clearly objective based, kind of like Silos.
---
Again, 0 spoilers, looking around at evidence of each sealed vault already available outside going in yourself, it's safe to assume nothing good happened in any of the 3. I think it's safe to hold onto that assumption.
---
Dude, how did you scrap the shotguns? Or did you mean just dropped them somewhere? 
---
Thank you sir.
---
 Big deal you cheated and wants to Nuke nice dude you're about three months late
---
What is this market you speak of in such high regard? I wasnt aware they added an auction house.
---
Oh wait, they havent and you are just acting as an asshole? Okay.
---
I understand what you mean but I don't think you understood that I'm not server hopping to random servers. I'm logging out of and logging back into the same exact server over and over again. Vendor inventory (except any legendaries sold to it by players) is different each time. Two people visit the same vendor and it has different mods/serums for sale.
---
Makes sense?
---
I always end up pulling out the pip boy after killing the first of a quickly advancing hoard because vats remains locked onto the dead ghoul as it tumbled down a fucking hill. Meanwhile all of its buddies are munching on my neck or balls deep in my face 
---
Gratz!
---
Well do have inside information that Raiders as Enemy types and quest given NPCs are coming to the game I just can‚Äôt say when.
---
You could even do this in 3 and NV if I remember correctly.
---
I thought that how many points you have in endurance determines how much HP you have, so I put some points into it.  I'm probably wrong.  This game does a shit job of explaining how things work.
---
Well you are better than me, I wouldnt have even fetched the links for him
---
Ive needed those maps before, but you wouldnt have known.. because I searched and found them quicker than it would be creating a new post on Reddit

To be honest I think his intentions are in the right place, but since the commander died, he went defective.

RDR2 "The single player game" was easily one of the best games released in 2018 where FO76 was a disaster and in a lot of people eyes will be one of the worst AAA games ever released.  
---
You buy RDR2 and get and amazing single player experience, with an optional online game with some decent multiplayer game play but a terrible MTX system which has received a lot of negative feedback. Since release they have made re-balancing changes to the MTX system and rewarded players with free in game currency. Q&amp;A issues have been almost non-existent.
---
You buy Fallout 76 and get a decent single player/co-op experience if you want to explore and complete main/side missions only with terrible Q&amp;A and game breaking bugs. It also included unrewarding end game content like workshops, events, nuke zones, broken PvP and even more Q&amp;A issues.  Since release they have addressed a number of game breaking issues and exploits, balance changes has made leveling slower, rewards less rewarding, workshops useless and the Atom shop (MTX) content harder to obtain through game play only.  The community are still asking for a number of major bugs to be fixed, quality of life features to be introduced and make end game content more interesting and rewarding.
---
Bethesda have also made a number of other poor decisions outside of the game and are the only ones to blame for  the negative feedback.
---
RDR2 and RDO are following the same path of GTA V and GTO a great single player experience with a online component filled with terrible MTX.
---
For someone wanting to play single player content both RDR2 and GTA V are worth it, FO76's single player/co-op content is harder to value it's "worth".  If your a slow player you could play FO76 for quite a while on the exploration/missions only and see enough value for the asking price, for me it didn't take long to finish and if you include all of the issue my friends and I had to go through it was definitely not worth it.
---
The biggest difference for me is that with Fallout 4 I'm still playing the game, Fallout 76 I haven't played for a number of weeks as there is nothing to do or rewarding enough for me to play it..
---
This happened to me too! He wasn‚Äôt on and I screamed HONEY SOMEONE IS TRYING TO KILL ME!!!! And then he logged in and saved me! üíï Who says chivalry is dead?! 
---
Oh so it was available in beta! I thought i was imagining things.  
---
Yeah a camp radio wouldn't hurt. Jukebox kinda sucks.
---
Its on Grahm can confirm, got it 2 days ago. Also, sweet check list. I made a copy so thank you!
---
I'm just curious why would you even waste your time giving a little speculative dumbass opinion like that???? If you don't know why do you feel the need to get involved in the conversation? Just give it a rest dude
---
Hardened is the best
---
Does it work for the larger plants as well or only small base plants like carrots, corn, and Tato?
---
Saw some low level characters in a blast zone with no health or armor, could only think they were ghouls from all the radiation!
---
It's not like Fallout 4 where there's a bunch of different versions of the same receiver that scale up, the most damage you can do with a weapon is typically when it's Level 45/50 and has whatever mod typically says, "Superior Damage."
---
The best way to boost damage is to get the perks associated with the weapon, and any Legendaries, especially Two-Shot Explosive (Which will then also benefit from Explosive Damage Perks).
---
I‚Äôve had scorchbeasts annihilate my camp to the last scrap.
---
I shoot ugly camps 
---
I can‚Äôt understand why there is a caps cost for fast travelling at all. Who the hell is taxing us for using the roads, or is the NCR in this game?
---
Yes. I've had to run people off a couple times for murdering my pets.
---
Oh man! I‚Äôm a new player and I‚Äôve never witnessed a nuke before before, but to be the one to launch the nuke sounds beyond exciting. 
---
Not fixed sadly.  Just killed the queen and got no loot.  Loaded shit ton of ammo into it
---
You're a bigger prick than a robobrain

I think you went over and above the call of duty for an online friend tbh.
---
I dont think I would even do that for someone IRL that wasnt family
---
Your inventory is the endgame boss that never dies!
---
I rarely get crashes from VATS (does happen though and was there in older games too) but I do get the stupid glitch where the game just goes nuts in and out vats stuttering with no control until the enemy I targeted in VATS is dead
---
I appreciate your actually non aggressive comment but this had been going on since November. I think I'm being very generous with time 
---
I've set my base up there, with a garage door so you can turn the turrets off basically. The mire is my forwarding address these days though.
---
Now if only the visuals matched. :(
---
It's not that I disagree, just saying. I don't see a reason to store it. I very seldom can find a reason to even use it other than nuke drops.
---
Questions: do I need the maps in my inventory to trigger them? I'm at the spot near overgrown sun dew grove and there are no dig options.

I bet you're the type of person who has very unenthusiastic sex
---
&gt; Bear arms reduces the carry weight 
---
I know this thread is old but I was searching for this exact thing because my bear arms isn't applying to my auto grenade launcher... Did they change it?
---
I think all energy weapons need a ton of work. I found a two shot plasma rifle and just like the splitter, the second projectile makes it break even faster. It's absolutely rificulous. The only decent energy weapons in the game right now are the tesla rifle and gauss rifle, but they are also limited for play style. Tesla is good for weak crowds like ghouls, but low range and gauss is good for long distance and sniping. But even they have lame weaknesses, Tesla has very few modifications and always has the same clip size unless you find a double or quad legendary and the gauss doesn't do full damage unless it is charged, but a hunting rifle always does max damage. Sure the gauss is more damage, but takes too long to reach max potential for fast moving targets.
---
Help me!

It is, I got the game at launch and finally did it. I recommend it, lol

I imagine theyre all using mules, I never see anyone walking around in slow mo

I appreciate it guys. That's why I'm going to delete this post in a minute. They its something like 5am there so they won't see it atm.

My camp is just up from Overseers on the steel deposit before the motel.. how do you think the level 2s and 3s would cope with a Deathclaw running around the area?

I‚Äôve seen this name around a good bit. Who is Grahm?
---
I follow a simple rule, never mix friends and family and money. It always ends badly with friends and with family. I've lost friends over money and family as well and that's what this sounds like. You aren't being a dick you want to play the game, it's not your fault the guy can't afford the game but him fighting over the profile with your nephew is not cool. 
---
How enthusiastic can you really be fucking your own hand? 
---
Unless you plan on using the Loudspeaker or Lightboxes, there's no real application for it.
---
This doesn't work for me or my girlfriend. I don't even spawn inside the buildable area on two of my characters, and neither character even spawns in the same place every time. I'm either on the opposite side of the water from my camp somewhere on the bank, or sometimes I'll spawn in the water itself, but still outside the build area. I don't understand why my spawn location changes, when I don't change ANYTHING in my camp, including the location of the Camp module. My girlfriend never spawned anywhere near her last camp, she used half her AP sprinting to it every time. She just moved her camp, so I'm not sure how her spawns have been since the move.
---
Good question!
---
First you place a foundation in a very precise spot on the side of the bunker with the trash cans. just to the side of it toward the left. Keep the level of the foundation flush with the wall, and make the "gap" between the foundation level and the bunker roof big enough for small stuff (like a campfire or light) but short enough to be negligible. 
---
With this foundation, build a stairway up. This will be your ceiling/roof. Map out your floor plan a bit, for your roof/upper floor, then build another staircase back down to the first floor (this is why you see a ladder off to the left in my picture showing the top of my roof, it was to build the "1st floor).
---
Build out that first floor as much as you'd like. You can even move where your "key" foundation piece is located, as long as you build it first/make all floors accesible before deleting your initial block.
---
This duping glitch is simaluar to the one in 7 days to die. They also had issues patching it due to game engine. Kinda something that goes with these sorta games.

I think you were being a nice guy. They sound like jerks. I wouldnt share crap with them to be honest.

Beyond the obvious things like it'd help those with disabilities; their voice chat sucks. I've swapped to area chat to thank someone for my mute friend. Neither of them heard it, I switched back to group only and fast traveled. All of a sudden now it's on area and working. 
---
I'd love to talk to people, but I'm not going to deal with a shitty voice system, and having to deal with squeakers etc in voice. I'd much rather just type. 
---
People always say "It'll ruin my immersion!1!11" to have global text chat. Well...don't have a global text chat. *Or*, have the ability to disable it. 
---
There is no good reason *not* to have text chat. All it does is bring pros to the table, no cons.

It does a couple times i think. This was posted earlier.

The ghoul perk already exists. It could just change you physically

‚ÄúThe big about launch codes disappearing‚Äù that‚Äôs what they said about what Bethesda has to say about their being a problem with Nike silos

How do people cheat?

It controls lightboxes, speakers (you can change the note they play), spotlights, some advanced switches (like the ticker counter power thing) and I believe also some electronic doors.

Was a timed sale closer to release. They're great. Shame they were timed with how unique they are compared to what's available right now.

That would be absolute chaos.

I‚Äôm a noob still at level 12, stepping into a nuclear site for me is like having a death wish, let alone the process to even launch one. The view of the explosion in live-person must be breathtaking.

Drop a paper bag, they pick it up, read it, rename it, drop it, we get to read it.

It should cost food and water; why they chose caps escapes me.

Read the post.
---
Am I the only one that is just like, at this point, if you aren't 1000% certain of the item you're trading for, then don't trade? So like, if you get screwed by a dishonest trader, it's your fault, and cool features like naming items shouldn't be left out to protect you?
---
I need my "monkey choking a buzzard" tattoo. Straighten up and fly right!
---
Even without a bunch of duped legendaries, the endgame isn't particularly challenging. 
---
Damn.  Well, I guess I'll start watching the atom shop more closely now for some good flooring.  :)
---
I'll work on taming later today and see what happens
---
Ah, I never tried making a stair case back down, I already have foundations flush. Perfect. I'll give that a shot.
---
I launched it at level 99. I was a 102 when I left the nuke zone!
---
Had the same issue last 2 weeks. Then one day I logged in and it restored itself. Don‚Äôt delete, be patient.
---
Nobody, its just there to slow down inflation and has nothing to do with lore.
---
Did you fill out the proper change of forms at the DMV?
---
Still though, it's pretty standard to send a shipping confirmation number if a company is sending someone something.
---
I've been lucky, and unlucky to have a Nuke launched on me, not at the players fault. The Mushroom Cloud is amazing to look at, dying? Not so much haha
---
It really is just about the biggest "duh" thing that's missing. You can't playtest for an hour without having issues with it. They must've had trouble with the "PA as inventory" implementation and weren't given time to finish it. 
---
the circuit board of thor
---
That has to be the most aggravating thing. The first results when searching for things always tend to be "did you search?".
---
The problem isn't White Knight per se, I think people are just objecting to the fact that repairing armor costs outrageously more than the base cost to create it. By LEAGUES more.  
---
Don't get me wrong, I know there's people complaining about the ballistic fibre itself, which I understand. Ballistic fibre is rough to get, but it isn't impossible. However, making a simple piece of heavy metal right leg should have a higher build investment cost than it would take to maintain the item. The alternative is what we have now: don't bother maintaining and craft a fresh item at minimal cost.
---
What is wrong with mules? They have admitted the only reason stash limit is low is due to physical hardware problems. Muling is not exploiting or cheating.. ffs. Its working WITH them until they upgrade their crap so it can handle more storage.
---
Holy, anyone above level 50 is like a titan in my eyes. Do you have any tips for leveling up? 
---
Sounds like a plan, just HMU, no rush.  Cheers to you being able to get it without wasting 1000 caps worth of ammo :).  Just as a note, I‚Äôll hit you up with some ammo for anything you buy from me... If I‚Äôm selling it , I ain‚Äôt using it so there‚Äôs no sense in having the ammo
---
Join again on different server.
---
I just kill everything I see...Do quests...Do events...craft...everything...If you see a nuke zone, make sure you have power armor, wear it and then go in and at least shoot everything
---
Does anybody know any of the codes
---
What do you mean? That strength shouldn't have most of the weight reducing perks, plus carry weight perks, plus carry weight passive, and melee damage (which also does the most damage)? 
---
Heresy. 
---
I made my CAMP here while leveling when I first came across it the same way you did. Having that floor there makes it feel so much more open to possibilities, haha. Have fun!
---
I don't think the drop rate is intentionally. Shhhhhhh.
---
Dupe is still working just with another step needed. It seems that to actually remove the dupe would require a lot of effort spent on the engine and so they will continue these half measures. And the only way these half measure will work is if they make it so weapons never stack. Idk what kind of issues that would bring up however.
---
What do most rifle builds take besides strength? I think I may end up having 7 or so str at the end of mine. Those shotgun perks man. 
---
Recently picked up any mutations ? 
---
Prime is I'm pretty sure
---
Could be because of Class Freak. Are you using that perk card? Currently Class Freak reduces the effects of Barbarian and Evasive to give you no effect at all.
---
Going to say thank you to everyone here for the advice and delete the post. I appreciate it! 
---
I feel like if it was really a player they might have been making some kind of joke about "blowing up the bathroom" (takin' a narsty shit)
---
At least that's what my reasoning would be if I did that
---
Endurance does or does not affect how much hp u have?
---
I've been using T-60 legs for ages with Calibrated Shocks, the fact that T-60 is the easiest to repair and almost no difference to X-01 is just an added bonus
---
I've seen both Vendors in Watoga selling the calibrated shocks mod
---
I agree 100% thankyou
---
Now you have to find the mini megasloth
---
I like the fact it's on an island; great looks base design!
---
You know when you can click to see details of a weapon/armor in your inventory? And you go into a screen with a close up of the item and a detailed list of all mods attatched?
---
Yeah, that. But for power armor chassis that displays a list of its armor parts in that screen.
---
oh wow,... yeah, i wanted to go recently for an mutation build. Is it still bugged or supposed to work like that?
---
Welding floodlights to my PA would be fantastic.
---
I‚Äôve never seen a nuke zone before so pardon me if this sounds dumb, what does power armour provide aside from durability?
---
Yep. They definetly seem to have turned into jerks in the past month or so. 
---
It's not... I have 11 nukes behind me and the first one was nice but meh

There is no consistent PvP unless you target noobs. This is how it works: You tap me, then I kill you. I tap you, I chase you around while you try to get out of the range that will blow yourself up with explosive damage. If I kill someone and they seek revenge, I will kill them 100%. If a ranged player kills me and I seek revenge, they will kill me again because they will see me coming. I can mitigate a ton of damage, but not nearly enough to win against a ranged player who knows what he's doing in more than two shots or 1-3 seconds of sustained automatic fire. I have studied the mechanics enough that if there are nerfs or rebalancing my build will hold up, but as of right now there is no balanced PvP. TSE is becoming a blanket term for overpowered "god roll" guns. Melee PvP isn't even about who can do the most dps, so that's pretty much no indication that your friend's experience means more than mine (pretty much all I do is pvp). 
---
Agreed, I‚Äôd love to build a more structurally sound building, but the single foundation and staircase supporting my 4x4x3high structure is the best way I can fit it onto most terrain. 
---
It‚Äôs still bugged as of right now. I don‚Äôt think it was originally supposed to affect those two perk cards because Class Freak says reduce the negative effects of mutations only. Hopefully they can roll out a patch for it soon.
---
Yeah I've definetly started to notice. Its really surprising how the top situation turned out. Just kinda blew me away that the guy would tell me to wait. I just got off work man. I'm not expecting to have to wait to use my own shit.
---
I‚Äôm sorry I should‚Äôve clarified I play on Xbox

I hope too, i miss like 125 Damage and Energy Resistance

It looks the same, because it is the same, except that the lighting has been improved, static GI has been added, terrain has been revamped, but ultimately the models/textures are the same as Fallout4 except for where new models were added
---
I'd love to meet up and buy the plans, do you play in EST time zone? Thanks!

That just made my afternoon...    Thanks for sharing!

Yeah a huge peg someone get taken down.  Travel to the next server and replace the blueprinted structure.  Such a huge problem for anyone....not. lol

Are nukes really that ‚Äúcommon‚Äù? I‚Äôve joined servers over at least 20 times now and have never witnessed it.

Yeah 7 is far too low for doing the scorchbeast queen. I did make it so the battle wasn't in the radiation zone though, so you might have stood a chance.

I second this.  I imagined when I bought this my friends and I could build a little diamond city style settlement.  I am hoping they do guilds/clans and let us build closer to those in our respective groups.
---
Historically, it was unlikely to be on a new engine. Look at FO1 and 2 (and tactics), then also FO3 and NV. Same engine carries over at least one title. Call me a normie and not a hardcore fallout fan but I really liked the FO4 engine; it was smooth, handled lighting pretty well, actually allowed for sprinting and advanced combat, and made it feel like a Triple A title should (for better or for worse). 
---
Camp mcclintock for springs (clip boards), sugar grove for screws (desk fans) server hop and you‚Äôre good 
---
What‚Äôs the plan name called? There‚Äôs one similar that is mislabelled because it clearly isn‚Äôt a brahmin.

I've lost so much good stuff to that bullshit. Plans/recipes, weapons and armor, a shit ton of junk I've needed. I couldn't tell you how much. Most recently I had to do the Firebreathers last quest in the mine at least ten times due to crashes, and each time I lost everything. Some of the stuff was there and I was able to reacquire it, but not all of it. Sucked big time. Still playing and loving it tho.
---
Drop 250, craft 50 more, drop 50, pick up 300. Still works.

Thank you I‚Äôll try this instead

If you didn't receive a message telling you that you were banned, then most likely you weren't.

Also, that classical music is a song and a half.  It abruptly ends and resets to the start too.
---
Honestly I'd rather have bugs fixed and server stability worked on than anything in this list. If I can't stay connected through a single session without the server failing to respond, disconnecting completely, or the entire game just outright crashing, what is the point of any of these?
---
I'd also really like to see the bugs Bethesda claimed to fix actually fixed. I've been stuck in power armor, and attacked by invisible bees after each respective patch was released.
---
Plus you get enough players who just play music through their mic the entire time.
---
So you either disable voice completely or spend time navigating the terrible "social" menu to mute them individually.
---
Oh yeah, that's the real world and why I try not to work for companies that does that. Typically those are the types of companies that want you to work unpaid overtime while the people who are making decisions don't work unpaid overtime. In fact they tend to get bonuses from cutting cost.

Mods can be scraped like if you needed 1 steel it will take the steel from the mod so you can build whatever you were building and the mod will disappear. It sucks they need to take that feature off the game and make mods unscrapable.

I'm curious, what are you doing in FO4 that's still keeping you engaged? 
---
That‚Äôs my point. It‚Äôs not the same as before.
---
Any "meat" that is prepacked will work with herbivore. Ie canned dog food, Salisbury steak, imitation crab, etc etc. 
---
That's actually a really good idea. Build guild cities with a budget based on member roster and activity.
---
Plan can be found in the cases easier to just buy the plan from merchant though but checking both can't hurt still hunting the normal marine limbs plan down :/
---
Unpopular opinion, but FO4 dialogue isn‚Äôt terrible. There, I said it.

Waste 9 perks in CHA first. Oh and always having to run with 3-4 people and having to make sure they are all within range is very annoying.

The First Person Position of the Gatling Gun is off. Its held at an angle and the Gunner sights are useless. But In Third Person its held Perfectly horizontal.
---
Small Thing also, on the map (on PC at least), Player levels past 100 aren't displayed properly.
---
Add more graphics options for PC. Especially for the lighting. because a lot of places look like garbage. Being in a 'dark' room that looks like a crude oil pipeline exploded in it, looks terrible. Overall, The Lighting just needs an overhaul. During Rain weather a lot of locations turn greyscale for some reason too.

How‚Äôd you get the super mutants arm positioned like that? Great pics btw
---
The unfortunate truth ... people ask to trade with me and I just ignore them because I just assume they are either a duper or want to try to steal my weapon.
---
Beware the Swamp nearing Harper's Ferry. 
---
We are Always Watching. 
---
Well hold on, I want to be able to name drugs.
---
I know who you are, ps4 right? 
---
I just want a GODDAMN ROLL DODGE.
---
Even ESO has it, bethesda. How do you make real-time combat in this day and age without dodging? GW2 is a clicking mmo released 6 years ago and its combat is more fluid than this!
---
Wut, there's a fo76 discord?
---
Im not choosing sides, I love Fallout, no matter the engine. Always been positive about the games. But I am curious about how it looked like if they would've gone "next level". It might have gone completely wrong, or maybe hit a goldmine.  Fallout gives me chills, in a good way. It hurts me to see all those bad reviews, I know Bethesda screws up sometimes, but still.. Fallout is a diamond, whatever the majority of people say. The true Fallout fans feel the same, im pretty sure
---
Oh that‚Äôs right :(
---
thanks! that was the idea.
---
Assaultron in SG can be bad
---
Yes that guilds idea is pretty cool like when you join a guild you will have the camps of other guild members even when offline and you are more likely to join a server with like 5 or more members playing.
---
So many shotguns and shotgun ammo at blackwater mine
---
I found the chest and legs in 2 server hops in a row but no wetsuit yet, but bought the helmet at least, thank you
---
No shit? I spent all my money and at least a day getting those, and just scrapped it to fix a hammer or something? That is not good.
---
Good on GMG, the company that created the fukin game doesn't care about their customers as much as third parties do. 
---
Care factor on their reputation is less than 0 at this point.
---
I‚Äôm hoping that there is something like that with the teased faction pvp.  Brotherhood gets to repair the old asylum.  Enclave expands out and reclaims all of white springs.  Raiders refortify top of the world.  I have no ideas for responders or free states, but 3/5 ain‚Äôt bad.
---
and that's obviously where you stopped watching the video...
---
Looks great!  Nice job on it. 
---
Yep happened to me too.
---
Np i can make you a westsuit treated too I think if ya like
---
DWELLER SKOOOOM
---
I see that you also follow a fortnite subreddit... did you mean to post this there?
---
I got the same. Sent me to the little mall place in the Mire. Level 1 pipe revolver. Awesome. Could throw mine out though. Also got it once where it was literally a blank note. Seems like a broken/half written quest.
---
I'm getting tons as well, they all suck but I got em
---
It doesn‚Äôt. 
---
I need the visuals so badly 
---
Are the modern couches, elegant couches, double display shelf, ice machine or light boxes still available?
---
Right, I‚Äôm saying I want those tasty visuals. 
---
Lol you‚Äôre not not wrong. 
---
It does. TBF it makes sense to have, literally, all the carry weight under strength. But gameplay it doesn't. 
---
Honestly, having carry weight perks at all is pretty shitty. Passives aren't super fun; let alone carry weight passives. 
---
PC here. Dang it! That's probably them too. 
---
Yeah I've have VATS prioritize non hostiles over hostiles in a fight, its bloody annoying when Im trying to help out random folks.
---
Yes. 
---
I've known this and keep forgetting lol...screwed myself so many times. 
---
what system u on
---
My camp is actually on the very top above the bridge. 
---
I have purifiers and tables set up for all the people constantly coming and going. The medical clinics basement there keeps me overstocked.
---
Harpers is my favorite.
---
bethesda shills are out in force today
---
Remove the turrets, take out their stash, kill the generators and camo their bodies.  
---
Had to do that today to two people that thought their camp farm was going to be left alone earlier.
---
I think you know what to do bro. Find new online friends who can afford their own games and actually want to play with you. 
---
It's me too.  I just discovered it the other day after checking the map and built my camp there to build ammo.  
---
treated? and what platform 
---
That's how you solve a problem in a development environment, not a production environment. Their servers only handle 24 players, they can easily afford to have 72 people playing the game so they have 24 hours a day of testing, where they can replicate all the known glitches.
---
They could even hire modders to test the game if they wanted to, this isn't a technical problem it's a money problem.
---
Yup. You'll automatically learn the schematics for whichever extractor you need. 
---
Well, according to the daily and painfully reoccurring  sub top post, naturally nobody wants you *two shot explosive*-ing, their wife.
---
Right. Even in guilds, people would do this. People also act as if no one listens to or watches things while playing. So it's not super great to have to mute my stuff while someone babbles on about some inane thing. 
---
Counterpoint: I was able to kite a big ol mob of ghouls that would have killed me into tang of a CAMP‚Äôs rockets. I was able to farm XP from a higher level mob I couldn‚Äôt have taken on by myself. 
---
Yea, I have found 4 variants of this note... it's totally random and all level 1 garbage. I was hoping you all the parts together into an Easter Egg armour. :(
---
Xb1 treated is +1 str +1 end and 4 of all dmg resists
---
If you build your camp near a deposit, the extractor will be available to build. No need for plans, but it does require 10 power.
---
Oh this would help grouping a lot!!! I‚Äôm holding out hope for the next patch.
---
You will always get my upvote
---
How do i do that?  Im still confused as to where the map is too.  I pulled it up once but not sure what i did.
---
aw I'm on ps4
---
People saying story isnt there, go on a advanture, let your fantasy go, there is so much to see.. There's a story almost everywhere, it just doesnt have NPC's to tell you. Maybe robots. But read the terminals, notes, holotapes. Even without those you can learn about what happend at that place where you are right now in game. Just look around, and if you look good enough, you can see what the story is, without saying a reading a word.
---
Ahh dang sorry gl man! He sells all that too first thing I actually found never give up never surrender haha :)
---
Yeah, that's where they were. Dang they really do spoil fast! Thanks for the answers everyone
---
Doesn‚Äôt matter either way as I have shot down 4 cargo bots in a roll and when I try and use the Nuclear key cards they dropped they don‚Äôt work and the mission resets to ‚Äúshoot down a cargo bot to acquire a nuclear key card‚Äù again. 
---
I love this game but the glitches are astronomical and ridiculous which is misleading and counterproductive in my opinion. 
---
If you are on PC i have a plan you can have
---
Just move to the other side of the pond. It doesn‚Äôt block it from that location. I‚Äôve found him there and my camp is halfway between the dried river and the pond
---
yea scrapped them meaning, left them in a bag at the bottom of the rector pool at the power plant.
---
OMG HOW DID YOU GET THAT?!?!?!??
---
Well, you're right. I am downvoting you for this.
---
lucky! goodluck with the armor plans!
---
Looks like brother billy got his GT leaked 
---
I'm level 43 and I soloed a scorchbeast just by wailing on it when it landed. I was able to take in down in under 5 mins. Always go shotgun or melee super broken
---
God I hope they bring us the AMR...
---
We know. We seen you when you were skinny dipping.
---
I have 2 cows at my c.a.m.p. but I already have too much fertilizer so I just leave the bins full.  And I have a couple o' them grains growing so's I can fix my cow if it breaks.
---
See.  It‚Äôs not the end of the world.  
---
Or is it? üò≥
---
aw thanks but I'm on ps4 
---
Yes yes and yes. My handmade weighs more than my .50 cal MG....
---
How did you get the monster mash mask ? Is it a reward from the event or did it bug on you?
---
choose. It give meat?
---
This! I have a buddy I play with who takes great joy in killing my poor brahmin :(
---
Sometime 1st quarter of 2019
---
Same thing happened to me. No idea what this is about. 
---
I am so glad somebody brought this up. The place is already overcrowded as hell as it stands. 
---
Similar to not knowing which plans you already have, there's an issue with the two Enclave Scout armor sets. You can't tell what mods apply to which pieces. You just have to buy one and hope for the best.   
---
I have a whole collection of Scout mods that I didn't actually need. :/  
---
A broader application of those mods, or some specificity as to which pieces the mods are for would be greatly appreciated.
---
Epic build, really like it!
---
Can I take you up on this offer if he‚Äôs not on the pc lol
---
Nobody sees shit because I have chameleon mutation!
---
Well that's not horrifying at all.
---
wait WHICH MOD?
---
The plain two shot lever is still sexy as hell. It can easily take down a scorch  beast. 
---
That quest loaded weird for me a few times. I always had to start back at the initiate line B part or whatever at the terminal. 
---
As far as know it is not possible to choose the same server in the normal UI. Are you using some special tool to force the same server? Joining a friend already on the server?
---
Yea I didn‚Äôt realize my perks that helps me find extra items in first aid kits and ammo boxes required me to press Y.
---
My friend just found this out too and I made fun of him a shit ton. But since this is reddit, I respect your discovery and I hope you find more. Happy hunting!
---
I have my door locked when I'm in camp helpless outside my power armor in case a mob comes by or a lousy griefer. When I leave, I open the door so others can use it. I may need to leave a note though, I came across somebody's camp recently and after exploring it I closed the door, and found out it was locked so I and anybody else who came by couldn't get back in. Oops.
---
Oh, in case anyone wonders, it is NOT by Whitesprings. My girlfriend and I both had our camps inside the walls though not anywhere near the Golf Club House during Beta. Too many random attacks by Scorch Beasts when we fast traveled to them. After fighting off three of them at the same time for the third or fourth time, we decided to move.
---
Same happened to us xD
---
https://imgur.com/LKXaf70
---
That damage value is lower than I thought it would be, I mean I knew the lmg wasn‚Äôt in a great spot but even with two shot it‚Äôs lower than I thought. I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs fun to shoot though.
---
&gt;Perk Loadout Manager
---
I use this since it came out and I don't think I could play anymore without it.
---
Yeah man basically the concept for this is that once for players cue up the system gives you 2 minutes to prepare. What's prepared every person is selected one target they need to kill until there are no targets left it gives you an area overall in the map that constantly updates while they move so there's no real way you can fast travel away without your target knowing where you've gone. Eventually when there's one winner the prizes are handed out to all people
---
1.  Every weapon has a perk card to reduce its weight except for rifles.   Some rifles can weight close to 25 pounds, so having a perk to reduce their weights would be nice.
---
2.  Have Lockpicking and Hacking on a single 3 star card instead of three separate cards, just to clean it up a little.
---
None of these reasons matter. Because there is NO MARKET in fo76. There never was going to be and there never will be. They were never going to give you the tools to become a cross server trading cap-billionare. At most we're selling to our server, if they come across our CAMP.
---
When I play with my brother I randomly add low levels so we can get to his CAMP and add a turret or crafting stations.
---
I am on my 2nd play of RDR2.  It is a AAA+ single-player story game.  Play it for that.  I've touched online, but have no real interest in RDO.

 Warning The Charging Tesla Rifle Will Crash Your Game!
---
1. What platform are you playing on?
---
&gt;PC
---
2) ParaPup
---
3)  [**https://youtu.be/OhCWwVDo\_K0**](https://youtu.be/OhCWwVDo_K0) Link to the example of a charged shot. 
---
4)  I think I finally worked it out,  
---
The cause of the crash may be from the "Charging Tesla Rifle" specifically when the charging is happening.  
---
This causes the player's bones to go into a null or Vector.Zero and I'd strong believe when a monster is attacking me this is causing massive errors and crashing the game that way. 
---
5) 11844535
---
On PS4, it's the Options button to the upper right of the touchpad.  
---
Just click on any icon that is blue or yellow and you'll have the option to appear there instantly, at the cost of caps.  You'll discover more places as you travel, which adds their icon to your map.
---
if youre on a laggy server it can take a while to activate. 
---
I suddenly got disconnected about the same moment you posted and couldn't reconnect on first try (kept flashing the "controls temporarily disabled" message even though it was still connecting). Exited to try again.
---
Sorry, was on Xbox, got it thanks you 
---
I need to put my mines on speed dial.
---
She literally dropped nothing for me... gg beth
---
30 minutes for 200 is on the lowest end of what I need. I would prefer around 1000 lead an hour which would keep up with my heavy guns fairly easily. 
---
Can someone clear up whether or not team mates who are nearby will also receive loot but don't have the map, too?
---
I got stuck as "Wanted" because in the process of shooting a Deathclaw that was attacking a player's c.a.m.p. a shot from my shotgun winged one of their walls. 
---
I guess in the future I'm just letting the Deathclaw wreck everyone's stuff. 
---
I think it has a lot to do with luck too. After the last point I put into luck, I started seeing a lot more plans in random drops, and I get spawns more often. I got 2 combat helmet spawns almost back to back, and same thing with the space helmet on a couple of outdoor spawns at Whitesprings. I got the plan for Grape Mentats off a random low level ghoul I killed.
---
Level 45 is insane plus the mods and the perks throw in some Chems too. 
---
Running around with a hunters lobgcoat and a bloodied fireaxe that does about 750 dmg. :)
---
There's an actual reason why the Whitesprings vendors trade in bottlecaps and not "just cuz"
---
"Shills" now write against corporations according to OP.
---
Who exactly would pay for that?  That's a pretty pathetic line of logic, considering we've seen more than enough people reporting offered payment for promoting 76 in a positive light no matter what.
---
We haven't seen one person saying "I got paid to write about 76 negatively" ever.    
---
What is actually going on, is this subreddit has become one giant fanboy circle jerk.  Where any and every piece of criticism gets twisted into some grand conspiracy.  Laughable.
---
It does, but I haven't run into a situation where I've found myself thinking "If i'd only had another 50 HP".  Food and damage reduction is too powerful at high levels.
---
Let's just say we were here when you first settled. And we will be here when you no longer breathe air into your lungs. Come join us in the deep end of the river my new friend. The water tastes great.

The Knight uniform is the green one correct? If so make me one for 500 caps. Fcatania is my PSN
---
Why isn‚Äôt CAMP radio on this list or CAMP Welcome Mats? This looks more like a personal list than a master list of the community... I like the music from the radio station just not the ones from the jukebox
---
Uranium Fever event has at least three 3* Legendary Mole Miners during the waves of baddies, just be sure to let other players tag them before the kill if you co-op.
---
I got to level 96 and realized that I wasted a lot of time grinding on a game that isn‚Äôt even good.
---
&gt;Holy, anyone above level 50 is like a titan in my eyes. Do you have any tips for leveling up? 
---
If you see Whitesprings is nuked just run in and start tagging shit. You can get several levels in an hour. 
---
actually no, those are found plans I used
---
I use it for my light boxes to attract people to my base.
---
I‚Äôm currently unable to read your post. You might still be banned. 
---
Can we add to the list the issues with  ‚ÄúCannot remove item: part of the structure would not be accessible‚Äù 
---
I have a freaking stair case that is not usable anymore because of that :( And I really don't want to redo my camp (also running out of caps because I had to redo it 10 times because of that :(
---
&gt;Yikes, level 30 radrats take away 20% of my HP per bite with power armour on. I can‚Äôt imagine how terrifying the enemies must be in the blast zone!
---
Get the Glow Sight perk that increases damage to glowing enemies. It fucking crushes in a nuke zone. 
---
I'm so happy I'm not the only one who thought of this....
---
Yeah, it's almost as if most people bought Red Dead 2 for the single player story mode which was worth the 60 dollars and the online is a bonus. So if the online is pure garbage, atleast there was an award winning single player game.   
---
What the fuck do you have? 
---
Yes the iron sights are quite satisfying until you have a long shot you wish you could hit lol. 
---
Not that I'm aware of
---
Whitesprings is the best place to launch a nuke if you want to level up. I walked into a blast zone at the whitesprings at level 18 and left level 32. Then the next time I got up to 41 and finished all my commendations for the enclave. I had no idea what to do with my perks lol
---
&gt;The game encourages this playstyle until it doesn't and that's frustrating
---
This. Because of the perks, the game had me thinking non-PA was somehow a viable option for end-game. 
---
Hahaha I so wish for a stranglers faction to join.
---
Yeah. It's been like that. Dunno if it's intended. For now just bulk that to save space. Otherwise bulk only stuff you wanna sell to vendors. Save your plastic.
---
That part
---
If it's a large amount of damage you usually can't be revived. If you get hit a seconded time after getting knocked down, you can't be revived. So if a ghoul double hits you and the first hit Knocks you down, the second will end you. Sometimes it's a really quick hit.
---
https://www.enclavedb.net
---
This site usually has em.  They have this weeks up already it seems :)
---
Sure psn
---
What is it? I have the caps
---
I think some even increase weight.
---
But I wouldn't say bulk "doesn't work" since it allows most types of junk to be sold.
---
Oh, I love the scroll wheel for favorites, there's nothing I like more than scrolling down the menu for looting something and then getting my fucking gun menu popping up because an [Insert literally anything in game that moves here] did LITERALLY ANY ACTION NEAR ME and now instead of picking up the .45 ammo instead of the .38 ammo, I'm picking a new gun. That's just my fucking FAVORITE.
---
Bulk is meant to reduce weight
---
Some materials actually gain weight too. All materials have different values.
---
The point of bulking those is to sell to venders/ trade.
---
Some venders wont buy 21 loose whatevers but they will buy 2 bulks and leave you 1 loose
---
Sounds quite cool. I wasnt interested if it had a huge quest symbol on players heads. Might give it another try
---
I use the circle reflex since I use my hunting rifle for sniping. Thing have changed a bit since I finally got an explosive combat rifle to drop. 
---
The support is trash, Over a month ago I requested a refund and they told me they can't refund me because I downloaded the game. I replied saying that was bullshit and they replied almost 3 weeks later suggesting I wait for some performance patches and asked if they wanted to assist me with the performance issues.  
---
 I said sure and they sent me a link that doesn't work, replied saying it didn't work. That was over a week ago now. 
---

It doesn't increase weight, just keeps the same

Uh oh. So thats how why I found a big ass stack for 2 caps at the vendor...

Hey mate, going to share this with the team as general feedback. Thank you and sorry for the delay in responding (just got back from Christmas break!)

Try bulking acid and then scrapping it.

Not much works as it should.

I am sorry for my delay in response - just got back from Christmas break.

I read the Brahmin pen plans, but can't find where they are kept, halp!  
---
Right?! I‚Äôm currently level 12 and was venturing to White Springs when I see level 50+ scorched coming at me. I am literally useless in these situations and its a bit frustrating. 
---
Xbox one
---
I don't publicize my GT, and I haven't made an official complaint to Bethesda.
---
But I'm stuck in my power armor.
---
Again.
---
Same as last time- I took it off, and collected it in my camp like I always do. I thought I had hit the wrong button because it's late and I'm tired, but I put my xo armor back in the chassis and then went to repair my weapons. Except I couldn't. Like last time, it shows me elongated on the screen with the power armor interface, but not in the armor. I can put it on and take it off, but I can'tgactually get out of it. 
---
I thought this bug was fixed? 
---
OHHHH JUST the trade glitch? So EVERYTHING else I said was spot on???
---
Another one who likes getting fucked in the ass. I love all 30 upvotes you got who confirm that, the trade glitch is LITERALLY the only thing that wasn't true.
---
Fucking win.
---
It's used in the scorch beast stew I think 
---
Taco bell with rads.
---
lol. Doesn't that just make the whole revive mechanic entirely useless? Like of course you're going down because you're being killed by something, which means if you can't kill that thing and you go down in the first place, it's gonna be there and keep hitting you. 
---
The rule seems rather dumb
---
Is this the random quest that starts by the overseers camp? It's meant for new characters to give them a little starter adventure.
---
I agree
---
It's the wasteland, amigo. Grab that stack and squirrel it away, someone should have picked a more obscure vendor.
---
I will be doing Whitesprings tomorrow. My group voted and thats the next spot. I just wanted to do the Queen for my first nuke.
---
Yes and budgets for own base building should be able to be increased based on quests and activities in the game intended to do so also
---
I low key a free stater.
---
Robotics expert 3 and troubleshooters gear help alot.
---
Don‚Äôt get me started on this, Or how about show what plans actually make before you buy them. 
---
But the not being able to custom name things is just annoying as hell. 
---
I haven‚Äôt even gone near the queen. To be honest I‚Äôm scared I‚Äôll run out of time or my game will crash
---
I would like to further ask and add, if you are in pacifist mode, can a player attack and destroy things at your camp? 
---
If yes then that may also want to be tweaked to stop it as that‚Äôs griefing material right there.
---
God, I just got back on after a few weeks and the game is possibly worse than I remember. Just got disconnected from the server about 5 times and had 2 infinite loading screens within about 2 hours. I'm starting to remember why I gave up on this game.
---
You are (Hopefully) older then 10 years old. You can fucking say god damn you cowardly cuckhold.
---
Coincidentally, I was one-shot today with Pacifist on. I don't know what the gun was.
---
I owned Spruce Knob and defended it through its second PvE event, helped by two high-level randoms who showed up. I never hit them, not that it matters with Pacifist, and there was no contesting of the workshop. Immediately after the event ended I went to my crafting table. I heard a shot and went directly to the respawn map. I saw that one of the randoms killed me and the other was taking my shop.
---
GG Bethesda.
---
I get the idea they were going for. I really do. But, well, not all ideas are smart ones. 
---
ESO has the ‚ÄúOne Tamriel‚Äù system that I‚Äôm genuinely baffled they didn‚Äôt implement here as it‚Äôs changed ESO radically ... for the better!

Not a King of the Hill fan?

---
Thus far the only food recipe that eludes me is Delbert's Traditional Chitlins. The files say it is in Spruce Knob Campgrounds but I can't find it anywhere :-(
---
No we don't need another mandatory perk to deal with a QoL issue. Guns should weigh ¬Ω what they do now baseline and all those weapon weight perks should die in a fire. Also you know it would be a perception perk, along with 9 points in rifleman, 3 in tank killer and 3 in your proposed perk there would be 0 points leftover for the one flexible ability we have now.
---
&gt; why not a sniper that weighs even 5 lbs?
---
You can get the legendary suffix to make your rifles weigh 90% less, it's just not given out as a quest reward. Given the choice though I doubt you'd use a quest reward rifle that only has 90% less weight over a dropped legendary two-shot.
---
Bad news, that's a common spot if you're where I think you are. Be prepared for the camp cannot be placed alarm.
---
If they was taking ur workshop already and they where in a team they probably team shores shot you. Server lag probably hadn‚Äôt notified you yet..or if you was in work bench you didn‚Äôt get the notification.
---
Speech 100
---
Well... Some people have loyalty from game to game rather than for a studio. Fallout could die with this game. Elder scrolls hasn't had a non Skyrim iteration for a while and the two franchises are heavily tied.

Why play a game when you know your going to get abused? 
---
I've been playing since day 1 of the beta and I had no idea. Are those the big red/pink plants that grow in huge groups?

I'm confused on why that now Im lvl 35 I can no longer see the perk cards for hacking and lockpicking when I leveled up?

Ive had a level 21 deathclaw, a level 20 sluggish megasloth, and now a level 30 Mirelurk King. The death claw is the coolest for sure, but the mirelurk is doing some work in a level 50-60 area. He screams a loud warcry so you know it's being attacked too. I believe you can get higher levels too. The tame has to be a random encounter, you need around 5 charisma, 3 animal friend, 1 wasteland whisperer, and it has to be less than half your level. So if you're 100, it has to be 49. I'm guessing 182 I'll be able to get 91 Deathclaws.
---
So heres the thing. A vast majority of people say you cant take someones power armor. They agree on this. I agree on this as well. Meaning, its probably the truth. However perception is reality, so if youve seen something, you know it to be true.
---
Now since youve told your story im going to tell mine, since apparently anecdotal evidence is concrete,.
---
My friend and I tested this as well, because he'd placed it, ran off to a vendor and asked me to watch it. This is when we decided to see. Since he had placed it, I couldnt touch it. No inventory option came up. On xbox its the A button as opposed to X for drop. Meaning that not even someone on your team can take it.
---
Now fast forward a few days and I did something similar. However I hit X, for drop, not A. Sure enough, it was gone. Some scoundrel just up and walked off with my T60. 
---
When you "drop" power armor you give up all claim, Id imagine it despawns if you leave the server too. Just like the person above you said, you were probably "dropping" it, not "placing" it. 
---
You know else speaks nothing of intelligence?
---
Talkin real fancy like tryin to make yerself seem smarter than the other fella tryin to teach you something. It just makes you seem snotty 
---
Until they ever make the pool tables actually function
---
Whitespring nuked or non nuked, I think legendaries may be more prone to spawn nuked, as mentioned previously Uranium Fever, also One Violent Night event had a decent chance for spawning legendaries and always spawns a Wendigo at the end
---
Bulk acid increases the weight but not actually. To make bulk acid it takes 10 acid but if you look at the amount of acid that is gotten from bulk acid its 15. You actually get an additional 5 acid for every 10 you bulk. 
---
It‚Äôs a Hank Hill reference... luckily jokes aren‚Äôt funny unless you have to explain them, so that means my joke was a success!
---
Game is full of little things like that. I figure it's just devs having fun. Maybe that's some dev's pseudonym in something.
---
They're in that area, but those plants aren't the pitcher plants. The pitcher plants are on the ground and look like this. 
---

---
I believe it says if you can't use it. 
---
Afaik the only one you can't is the powerfist...which is odd since it's a power armor weapon. 
---
Oh cool. Do you have any screenshots, I would really look at how all the other camps look like
---
Huh?
---
Sorry. I just didn't recognize it.
---
That second one would be cool, but I feel like it get's rid of paper bags too fast for it to work well unless you have a buttload of stealthboys and can see when they're here to pick up clue 1/2/3/etc
---
It also works with things like water purifiers. I have two attached to the edge of a rock on top of a cliff just outside West Tek facility.
---
No, it's meant to "bulk" things so you can sell them. Not everything can be bulked. Those items can be sold as is. 
---
Is that west of the whitespring? Ya. I went past that area a few times and kept wondering why a damn scorchbeast kept agroing to me.....then I finally noticed the fissure. 
---
Just sent one off
---
Well normally they don't attack you if your down, in fact there is barely any things in the game to do double tap. Also this ma not actually be it, because scorchbeasts are the only thing that can do an overwhelming amount of damage to me it's the only other thing I can put it down to
---
You get the last one in the 40s, I think 43 but I don't remember. Check Nukedragons. 
---
That boy ain't right.
---
Hey mate - just catching up on my inbox after getting back from Christmas break.
---
Did you end up updating your support ticket with the below info? Please note the bit about including your full name, username and email.
---
* Your proof of purchase should be an **image** of your receipt or invoice from your retailer. To avoid upload issues, please use an image file format such as .jpg or .png.¬†
---
* Your image **must** include your **full name**, **Bethesda.net username**, and your **email address** **printed legibly** on the receipt or on a separate piece of paper. A photo of your digital receipt is also acceptable.

* A photo of Power Armor Edition items in your possession is **not** acceptable proof of purchase.
---
Is that like a scorched megasloth? Looks like a hamburger version of Chunk from the goonies. I haven't seen one that looks like that.
---
I didn't create it, I just set up camp at a little barn that already had a dresser that is a public container.
---
Maybe I'll get on and post a pic so it's easier to visualize, haha. 
---
When using TSE shotgun, try shooting their feet. I've found my Exploding double barrel (not even Two shot) does far more damage if I'm shooting the ground than shooting the target.
---
Scorched, super mutants, the occasional Sierra Bravo. It's usually only one or two enemies taking shots at my crops from across the river, they very rarely destroy anything. But I've had SBs attack on a few occasions, they do a ton of damage. 
---
What‚Äôs wrong with Charleston train station bases?
---
Can I vote against Second CAMP and the Fast Travel while overweight perk?
---
There are some perks that are effectively passive because of the lack of restrictions on when you can swap perks. Having the Fast Travel while encumbered perk is effectively removing that mechanic from the game. There are a lot of problems with the weight mechanics of the game but removing one of the two consequences isn't the right way to "fix" it.
---
I'm a gunslinger without marsupial, does being in the air stop Melee's from VATSing onto you?
---
&gt; most have to hit me twice to kill me, 
---
That's like the Assassin's 44 (+Dmg while aiming down the sights, don't think that applies to Vats?) I have vs "Normal People" in PA tho
---
It actually works better than Melees because it doesn't run into the Dmg Cap bug.
---
Until I get hit of course
---
I mean I can ask my friend if I can get some of his base when I see him but I don't know when that is going to be. But I checked yours and it's definitely built into the same spot as his and a few others I've seen.
---
I had the same exact issue with that gun. It's  shame because it was actually pretty decent.
---
I believe I wouldn't crash until I hit a hostile and they hit back. As long as they didn't hit me then I wouldn't crash. 
---
It only crashed you, and not the entire server. 
---
It's there. One of my favorite subs right now.
---
Nah, he means they put their camp by the club housr but lock it up so no one can use their facilities. 
---
Likely perk
---
Oh okay. I see now. Thank you!
---
&gt; It apparently tastes like a coconut is trying to chloroform you.
---
Hahahaa holy shit
---
I'm pretty sure it was because Bobbleheads used to Stack? Insane Damage ontop of Insane Dmg
---
Yeah. There are mods and a perk for that.
---
I'm on PC so I've modded the game.  I wouldn't say I've added a heap of extra content and most of the mods are game play/quality of life improvements but I played the game a lot on release.  I then started a new play through last year and I am continuing now at a much slower pace in between other games.
---
They have nothing to do with the store and would most likely just direct you to the store support, they are different departments.
---
Can't offer to sell anything, but I have info:
---
If you're a high enough level to help with a scorchbeast queen fight, you will get the plans from your first queen kill.
---
If you're not a high enough level to help, you can throw on some power armor or a hazmat suit and try to at least do a little damage. Kind of a dick move since your presence will make the SBQ stronger, but it's your life.
---
Launched 2 already. Gonna do a third soon. 
---
Ah, I just moved my camp here!  I love what you've done!
---
Happened again tonight but the circumstances were different. Came into white springs and shot some ghouls. I hit another player and got the message stating you can‚Äôt hurt anyone else in pacifist mode. Few minutes later I jump down with everyone else to loot and I die. The guy had a shotgun but did not loot me and seemed to be guarding my paper bag. Next round I get the message again and the same guy kills and again does not loot making me think it‚Äôs accidental. Im sure I was down 30-40% health from rads each time but in T-60. 
---
The very next round a melee starts pounding on me and is doing a good 10-15% a whack but no where near enough to  kill me. I jump over the wall to the pool and give myself room to turn pacifist off and kill the melee. Weird part here is he‚Äôs still doing the same damage but my first 20 rd mag does nothing to him in VATS. I run again to gain distance, reload and kill him in maybe 5 shots from full health. I recognize that he was awful which is why I lived but something really weird was going on. I guess getting killed zoning in might seem like being one shot because of the lag time loading. All I see is death but they could be unloading on me. Either way... something is broken.
---
the only shill is OP for not even realizing they fucking hotfixed the fact that YOU COULDNT NUKE WHEN THE ARTICLE WAS POSTED. holy shit, put the kool aid down
---
I've never seen anything like that, nor do I believe there are any perk cards that allow you to just revive yourself after you die....Although now that I'm thinking of it, there is a perk card that does that! 
---
I forgot the name, but it's a Luck perk called "Reaper"? Or something that has to do with one. 
---
I noticed a lot of locked up houses i try to find away in using my jetpack, never to steal any resources just to scrap at a workbench
---
Don't need them. I have every mutations from standing in puddles. I'm full on mutant and I don't really care to vendor hop for recipes.
---
Looks amazing coral 
---
YES! You can use HDML in Fallout 4 when renaming weapons. So awesome
---
Yeah, I‚Äôm learning how terrifying the right side of the map is as I progress. It doesn‚Äôt help how slow leveling up feels at times, especially when servers are dehydrated of any action.
---
If you die overencumbered, you will only have 1 respawn point available - the closest one to you.
---
If you die normally, or fast travel, you should be able to spawn at any discovered place on the map.
---
That‚Äôs what I‚Äôve found anyway
---
I've had these evil thoughts about dropping down a camp that's nothing but a porta-john with a nuke mine in it. 
---
I replace them and run around with stealth boys. Usually doesn't last long but still fun.
---
Don't be scared of the beasts. Get a TSE weapon, or missile turrets. It probably won't hurt your base too bad.
---
I agree, it's nothing. I was expecting an actual Olive drab cot on a frame, military style. Never saw any kind of new addition to my beds
---
well thats a tad disappointing 
---
I'm not entirely sure tbh. I've always hoarded my caps.
---
Lol. This is 1 emote I would buy without a doubt. Take my money.
---
Yup, 4 the introduced the slider while the previous games had presets.
---
Its been like that since the way they changed how loot &amp; npc spawns a couple patches ago
---
Sharing with the team just to make sure. Apologies for the delay cashiimo (just back in the office after christmas break).
---
Where did you launch it? White springs? If so can i join your server?
---
This is the only one I'm missing. I keep checking the whitesprings vender but no luck thus far. 
---
Level 104 and still have heaps of quests that were available when I was in the 20s. I didn't rush through levelling...levelled very slowly and have played heaps. Are you smashing through quests not reading anything and avoiding all fights or something?
---
Or.... you and everyone else is just plain full of crap.  
---
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xhxCYgtq52E](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xhxCYgtq52E)
---
Are you trying to equip them or pick new perks? If you are trying to equip cycle through them, same with unlocking new ones. I think maybe if this doesnt answer your question im not understanding what you are asking.
---
Fallout's great.  
---
Mmmm intentionally vague statements that imply other things...
---
No, both you, /u/HartoftheGalexi and /u/giantpunda are thinking about Mysterious Saviour perk. It is in luck. *However*, no mysterious stranger is showing up and, *again*, he was level 21. That is a level *49* perk. 
---
Born survivor iirc
---
I was nervous the game would crash too, especially with the nukes being bugged out yesterday. But I was so geeked up for it, I was doing it no matter what.
---
Thanks, this will help me build my tower :)
---
Could you provide a image please?
---
Sorry mate about the delay on this one. Could you explain this issue for me? 
---
Im not a new player but if you have the Plasma Grenade plan on PS4, I will gladly take it from you. That friggen thing has evaded me for so damn long.
---
Sorry for the delay guys - just back from Christmas break.
---
Going to let the team know about this one.
---
No it's tge born survivor perk. You have a chance to revive yourself with a stim
---
&gt;because they have nothing better to do
---
That's not why they do it. They could be on their way to a magical portal to Skyrim and they'd still stop to smash your shit if they run into your camp on the way. 
---
100% VATS chance at 50% AP cost finally has a use on a melee weapon!
---
Power Fist, Deathclaw Gauntlet, Boxing Glove, Knuckles, etc. are ‚Äúunarmed weapons‚Äù instead of ‚Äúmelee weapons‚Äù, and it‚Äôs unarmed weapons that don‚Äôt work with power armor.  I don‚Äôt recall offhand if or how one sees whether a weapon is unarmed vs melee.
---
 Or.... you and everyone else is just plain full of crap.
---
You could turn the game on and play right now, you're acting like its in an unplayable state. I think maybe you should get off your high horse and be happy they are fixing game breaking shit, rather than throw a hissy fit about them not fixing everything immediately. 
---
Hmhm message my psn when you want ny phone is sending notis late af for some reason
---
Xbox one... just picked up an assaultron head it showed zero ammo loaded. I had over 700 rounds fire at once when I tried to fire it.
---
I just heard sometime early January 
---
Can robots be tamed?
---
Whomp whomp -_-
---
We need a bull Brahmin with turrets on its back to defend Bessie. 
---
I just carry different lever actions for various needs since I am obsessed with the stealth sniper build üòÇ
---
No. It's impossible. I posted a video of it being taken away right after the quest is completed.
---
Thx 
---
Oh I never seen those skins, they don't sound like atom shop ones, I mean we did kinda get a black skin for a day so that might be an atom shop, was 1800 skin.
---
And for you psychopaths/crazies out there maxed lead belly + cannibal is an amazing combo
---
They said Early January but knowing them that could early January 2077
---
Not saying this is you but people need to quit building bases behind the golf club, man. There's a certain etiquette if you're gonna join the golf grinders, and they'll make you learn it
---
Life Saver armor mod? I‚Äôve got a leather shoulder that does this. It happens after death, like you describe. 
---
Get better internet?
---
I attribute it to boredom only because it seems to be a new phenomenon within the last couple weeks.  
---
But yeah...I get your point...some people are just dicks.
---
Where are you freezing ? What map area? 
---
I love PA and spec'ced accordingly. However I get furious about games that present you with false choices. There are SO, SO MANY perks that specifically benefit only non-PA users. But non-PA builds blow for end-game. WTF. Especially since you have no idea how fucked you'd bed end-game when you start picking perks at level 2.
---
I feel like it has gotten worse after that recent hotfix, im just trying my best to complete my bos attire
---
You can also respawn on a team mate if overencumbered  
---
Yeah, this has always been a problem for me. Hopefully Bethesda doesn't listen to all the people telling them to move onto their next game. It would upset me a ton if they were to do that. 
---
It‚Äôs a whole library of camp items allowing you to spell out whatever you want, there‚Äôs a reason it cost so much.
---
They shoild seriously up the hp of structures or implement a new formula for player damage on structures. 
---
Sure pm me your name and i will find you
---
Same, I had a base in the Ash Heap with a cat, and a bunch of milk machines. Someone destroyed my milkbox stonehedge and killed my kitty :(
---
I've been reading lists of them extracted from the game and it is supposed to spawn at Spruce Knob Campgrounds but no dice.
---
Gigabit ougtta do it.  Any other valuable recommendations?
---
No problem, I understand you people have families as well. I hope you have had a nice Christmas and a safe new year! :)
---
I just wanted to say that I am no longer able to replicate the issue. 
---
Since I wrote the feedback, I have tried 4 breach and clear events, and they all had something in the containers.
---
Only 1-2 of the containers at each event didn't spawn anything, which is not great but still acceptable in my opinion. 
---
Thank you for getting back to me!  
---
its called life saving and your spot on that its that
---
Oh ok. No it's not a perk. It's ny life saver chest piece that revives me with my stim. Sorry bout that. But it does revive me sometimes after death
---
Last couple were at Grafton Steel yard. 
---
I would do that if i could find another one, Haha. I don't like to buy off of other players since they could be duped, and I don't want to be associated with them. Kinda sad it's come to this tbh
---
Dont take it personal man. Bethesda seems to want to make it better
---
Is the real price you need to pay to be able to spell out vulgar stuff. Use grape mentats and selling perk to get it under 1k. 
---
Who cares about lore. Good game design trumps lore 100% of the time. The issue is clear: the perk system gives you all sorts of false choice with tons of no-PA perks. Only for players to find out around level 40 or 50 that non-PA utterly blows for end game.
---
If they wanted PA to be the only end-game option, this should have been clear from level 1 in terms of perk information.
---
Hey Steven, I'm going to have a chat with the team about this to exactly see what happened. Could you please DM me your ticket number?
---
Link to build?
---
No, that's not correct. That doesn't revive you. What it does is automatically use a stim pak to *heal* you when you fall below 20, 40, or 60% health. It does not revive you. 
---
In fact, it will use a stimpak and *not* save you if you take enough damage to one-shot you. You will be in a downed state with *full* health. 
---
Either way, again, the player was in a downed state, then *died*, including dropping a bag of junk. Then instantly revived with full health, on their corpse. 
---
Where's the tutorial at?
---
Assassin's Creed Odyssey does this.
---
I was freezing in watoga. 
---
Do you work for Bethesda customer support or something? Sounds exactly what they suggest instead of addressing there are severe stability issues.
---
Uranium fever has only ever dropped level 40 gear for me... 
---
Come back in a year?
---
Havent failed me \*yet\*, infact im on a roll, zero server disconnects now for about a week if not more. Even then it was only one per session, maybe per couple of sessions, a lot less than some MMOs ive played. (I have bad internet).
---
Whitesprings golf club, there's a ledge lowbies jump to and a higher level gathers the mobs and leads them back. Most people understand this if you're a lower player there, they know what you want. Don't build a turret house behind it though
---
I think I played it for maybe 2 hours with a freind before we both agreed we arent dealing with gtao 2.0 grindfest again
---
Happened to me a month or so ago, they were all "diseased" eyebots..
---
You are right. I was mixing that up with my armor mod that revives me. Sorry. 
---
This is the most blatantly false claim ever.
---
The reason it costs so much is that its the only real customization available besides picking from a few different floors/walls/lights.
---
But duping is a feature, why else would super duper be a perk in the game!
---
I wouldn't be surprised if they were just looted by someone; since they restarted servers for the hotfixed, everything would be fresh.
---
Also probably not comparable with the patch that changed how spawning works since the hotfix was just several hours ago.
---
I was lucky enough to go to a whitesprings nuke zone at level 27 or 28. From then on I went up to 38 from one nuke zone and then the next server I went into another nuke took me to level 49. I went up 20 levels in 5 hours just from farming enemies and being lucky enough to find nuke zones lol. 
---
Edited. Here is the map with soot flower and rhodos removed
---
[https://imgur.com/a/uU3DJeF](https://imgur.com/a/uU3DJeF)
---
Life saving armor. I have 3 pieces on me and it's amazing. .
---
Thanks for making sure even more people see it, asshole. 
---
here ya go rhodos and soots are gone 
---
console players don't have this feature I believe
---
These lists really are awesome [u/S-Plantagenet](https://www.reddit.com/user/S-Plantagenet) \- thank you.
---
Sharing this with the team now.
---
It gives you every individual letter and number which would total over ‚Äú35‚Äù camp items... how is that a false claim?
---
Youre an idiot.
---
Show us a picture of your download speed no way you you have that lmfao
---
See, granted I don't have a piece to test. But I'm not sure if that's it. 
---
When you're downed you don't drop junk, correct? It's only when you die and respawn yes? 
---
If you do drop it when you're downed, alright egg on my face. But even then, it says revived while down. Maybe the effect is just buggy? 
---
I'll have to see if I can find a video showing it in action. 
---
Oh no! Poor bastard would get his video demonitized and lose a couple hundread after a 6 hour stream making thousands in donations during sais stream! Oh no we cant have that! People think of poor oxhorn before you request such silly things! How inconsiderate!!!
---
I would always make the pip boy white so I had a normal flashlight
---
No need to be sorry. Never seen that piece so unfamiliar with the fx. 
---
rhodos and soot flowers have been removed so starlights should be easier to tell apart now [https://imgur.com/a/uU3DJeF](https://imgur.com/a/uU3DJeF)

Get a better comment? God you‚Äôre a fucking tool 
---
I've probably opened around 40 or 50 mounds so far...I've found 2 plans for t-51b parts (helmet and leg). I think I also found a plan for excavator rusty knuckles. But the vast majority of the time it's either a low-tier plan or mod, a random weapon, a random armor piece, and some junk
---
Find a good place to build where you can settle down for a while. Make surr to build water purifiers and have food. This will ensure you to never run out out of two key components that can screw you entirely late game.
---
Hrm, so to be clear, when it goes off for you, you die correct? As in you're in a downed state, then you die, drop a bag of junk, and are revived? 
---
I haven't used it before so I don't know. 
---
I mixed you up with the usual people on this subreddit that claim the price is to stop people from using it so write out meany words in the game.
---
But yeah, 35 letters makes it the most customizable aspect of the game.
---
I get that freeze there and in a LARGE area that surrounds Charleston. If you are like me you get a few seconds when you load in before you freeze... if you give up trying to have the area load, quickly open the map and fast travel to 76. You wont freeze there. They did something in the last patch that started these freezes. This didn't happen to me before it. As of right now, I can't get anywhere near two LARGE areas of the map and it's absolute shit they haven't released something that fixes it yet. 
---
&gt; Did they change it?
---
Probably. I haven't played in weeks so I don't know for sure.
---
Animals and creatures lower level than you
---
No robots, or humanoids (think Scorched and Ghouls etc)
---
I login fast travel to the enclave bunker which is so close it takes 1 cap and now I'm in a forever loading screen, restart pc same thing what gives??????????
---
Where exactly is it supposed to spawn there?
---
There was just a variety of pipe weapons near the corpse each time I visited this location 
---
Just stop, honestly. Absolutely nothing valuable to contribute. 
---
Missed your reply, thanks. Never ran into that before, and with how glitchy the game was; figured it was a new glitch I didn't know about heh. 
---
Yep, fuck this guy. 
---
Yes, it is a side of the road event you will see a dead witch and she will have the plans for the outfit and hat. It is a low % for it to be her though so if you server hop expect upwards of two hours, it only took me 40 minutes and I have seen her one other time when I was just passing through doing stangler blooms.   
---
Fast travel crevasse dam load in all the way and then look to the left up the road there will be something there it could be the witch or a vampire or a tent or a tank or a nuke or a vertibird and so on. 
---
In other words the government and Vault Tec hated West Virginia
---
They "failed" you? Melodramatic much.
---
I only smash shit if you lock your doors. I just wanna use your stove, man, it's not like I can capture your camp. 
---
Plus, the in-game music is limited to what was made before the war. As cool as it would be to hear someone blasting Weird Al from their C.A.M.P, it'd break immersion a bit.   
---
... "immersion" \*air quotes\*
---
I hope I'm not too late to the party.  
---
Can confirm the following (I can make them):  
---
BoS - Soldier Suit, Officer Suit, Knight Suit
---
Full mods (Treated through Shielded) on all of those as well as BoS Fatigues (which I can not make, but have a few pairs of).
---
The white spring bunk is a glitch in the matrix. Everytime you enter the bunker, there is a deja vu moment on PS4. 
---
Never checked there. Thank you. Will be in this area for the week. If I find something, will let ya know. 
---
I‚Äôve noticed some servers are just borked for some people and not for others. If I‚Äôm disconnecting I‚Äôll back out and join a few times in a row. It usually seems to do the trick 
---
It's why it feels so comfortable, yeah?
---
Why the hate? Are there that many Dupers?
---
Yeah I‚Äôm pretty sure they fixed it.
---
If you need codes they are here: https://nukacrypt.com/solved
---
No problem. To be honest, the first time that mod kicked in while I was playing, I had forgotten it was on my armor and it freaked me out. LoL 
---
I cant tell u if the junk drops or not. It may, and then may pop back in my inventory. I haven't asked anyone to watch me die before. It's usually mid heavy battle that it happens. But I am deader than dead for a few seconds then I pop back up. So its possible
---
Have ques on the regular man. 
---
Hey blades - thank you as always for sharing feedback.
---
I've shared this suggestion previously with the team but will do so again
---
Silly children
---
His logic checks out though, the stuff like building sets or power sets all cost much more than most other plans. Some of them go up past a thousand because they have a couple fairly popular things
---
Aside from that, bethesda does need to have a bit of a deterrent to stop people from smacking COCKMASTER69 all over their camps
---
Whitesprings shop for food stuff has a lot of "gourmet" level recipes that require sugar/salt/pepper/spices, etc. Rare but they all exist in high level cooking.
---
I don‚Äôt hate PvP, I just like the way it‚Äôs currently implemented: you have to get people‚Äôs consent to PvP. I don‚Äôt like being griefed and harassed, and no amount of reporting will fix that in the heat of the moment, when you‚Äôre trying to make PvE progress and being forced not to be able to. Had that happen in to many games before. I like Bethesda‚Äôs approach. I also think they could &amp; should expand upon PvP games and events to encourage players to engage in PvP. 
---
I understand where some players feel the wasteland should be dangerous, or that there should be optional free-PvP servers, but I‚Äôve spent years playing Fallout as a franchise specifically to avoid that shit, so I appreciate the opportunity to *choose* whether to engage in it. 
---
Yes, its back up. I nuked Prime a few hours ago.
---
Cause nobody play tested it ahahaha
---
Those people don't know what they're talking about. The engine is irrelevant. They either have tools for this or they don't. Even if they don't, each weapon has a unique ID and dupes share ID's. I don't see why they couldn't check their database for duplicate ID's and remove them, but I'm not there so I can't say for sure what their setup is like.
---
Anyway, just because customer service says they can't help people doesn't mean Bethesda doesn't have the tools for it. Their customer support is obviously just not set up for that kind of thing. Customer support is notoriously bad...like everywhere anyway.
---
Obviously I can't say whether they'll remove dupes, or whether they have the tools do so. But I can say with absolutely certainty that it's possible. It doesn't matter what engine they're using, and I think it's weird and frustrating that people constantly blame things on the engine as if it's some monolithic, magic thing that can either do or not do something. 
---
Could be the server? I had major lag and freezes yesterday, logged off and back in, all was good. They haven't fixed a bunch of things (robots at whitespring, people glitching, instability in nuke  zones etc) so you'll find certain servers are messed up.
---
Hey mate - thank you for sharing this suggestion. It's really appreciated it.
---
The team was previously made aware of this feedback but I'm going to share it with them again just in case.
---
Shooting the middleman hardly seems sporting.
---
Everyone died from dysentery. 
---
This usually works for me too. I also think the server crashing seems to happen a lot more after the patches because a lot of the dupers all jump on right away testing it out and looking for new ways to dupe.
---
Known bug for now, it's just the charging tesla rifle barrel, nothing to do with hitting too many enemies (although that probably does also crash games from time to time). For a fun little adventure, try viewing yourself in third person while charging it
---
Us people with face tattoos that look like they were created in MS Paint never get representation in games. Take your artistic sleeve mainstream ideas elsewhere and let US have one for once.
---
You, know I can see this right?
---
Thank you 
---
I never received the ATOMS either on my original ticket.
---
You're an awful human being and I hope this post gets as many downvotes as humanly possible. You're YouTube Rewind levels of bad.
---
If it‚Äôs pure black it‚Äôs called Black Bird.  It was in the atom shop.
---
‚ÄúWhat can I say except you‚Äôre welcome?‚Äù
---
I was hoping the Respec would work something like Skyrim's where for one Dragon Soul you can wipe any skill tree clean and reallocate the points you'd placed there. I'd love to trade in a Scorchbeast heart to wipe a Special and put those points anywhere else.  I've been working on my respect for ages, move one point, buy one card, move one point, buy one card... L94 and still a ways to go.
---
I was unable to use the key code in the bunker to complete "I am become death". If I could please join you to nuke, and then "Scorched Earth", I would absolutely love you. 
---
I'm dtb7591 on PS4, if you're on PC / xBox. Thanks :)
---
The lockpick and hacker perks are for progression. If it was a single 3 star card you could either pick everything from a low level, or not pick anything until you're high level.  
---
They could merge into one once you get all 3 though.
---
This just means they will be the prime target in three years.
---
Sadly it's only procced for me once prob due to my low luck. But I was dead dead and came back. Don't think I had loot on me at the time.
---
Yeah I think I kinda figured out I finished the Hide &amp; Seek last night when it was down now is asking me to do it over again...
---
How many grape mentats? With the bargain perk maxed out I see the price is 9500. I‚Äôll hunt down the increasingly elusive grape mentats now. 
---
Thank you buddy :) And you're welcome!
---
Well just in case, I've shared this with the team anyway, to see if they can replicate the issue.
---
They also need a hay bailing mini game so I can use my 3* pitchfork
---
That explains why the guy downed himself while I was reviving him. 
---
It used my stimpak...took his junk. 
---
Attacking the middleman?
---
And you call yourselves white knights.
---
Just launched 
---
The issue of getting "locked" seems to be an issue with stairs in general I have it happen to me with just a single stairs I haven't been able to figure out how to stack them like this thanks for the video.
---
Lots of fuckery trying different angles, heights, distances, and building in different phases would work on the rare occasion. I stopped trying to build more creative bases because of it and opted for the boring square. I also stopped playing weeks ago, so it may of been patched. 
---
Go suck a dick ya twat
---
Honestly they should just make em all work, The arcade, chess, golf course.
---
I have yet ran into one alive or not.
---
Great perk card. Never need ballistic fiber again
---
It could also be that when a player forces it, you drop junk but it still can save you. Perhaps when it's "natural" you don't drop junk. 
---
Don't know, either way not a hack. 
---
Usually takes a couple of years
---
I believe you would have to be party leader and activate the equipment yourself for it to count
---
Where abouts on the map is this bridge an did you have any budget left lol?
---
Ard. No shame in being gay. It‚Äôs 2019 out here.
---
Get a good set of level 1 legendaries, you have yourself a semi invincible mule alt. Keep it below level 5, make it so anything trying to hit you deals with wonky scaling giving you time to escape, look at that you're invulnerable!
---
I wasn't in a party. 
---
With 3 charisma, first equip a maxed party boy. Eat a sweet roll. Drink a beer. Then equip a maxed hard bargain. Pop a grape mentats or a day tripper. 
---
Effective Cha~14 with Max hard bargain. You'll trade very close to the max efficiency.
---
Sweet :)
---
DC three or four times in my session today. For me it‚Äôs the stash box. 
---
I cue in every session. After 200-something hours I got it to start 2 times. And it was pretty sweet. Just store your junk and have some fun people! Just try it out before judging too quick.
---
Blackwater Mine is also great for Glowing Meat, which crafts to a steak I sell for 9 caps each, or eat if needed. There's even a cooking station in the courtyard opposite the mine entrance. It's like free money.
---
I've seen bodies at nuke sites
---
Why thank you very much.
---
Just a confusing mod ppl that have can't entirely explain. Lol
---
Very cool! Even though that Scorchbeast is coming to slaughter them :)
---
There‚Äôs perks for lacking ballistic, yeah?
---
I also liked it. It was refreshing from the same boring ass dialogue that every rpg since the 90‚Äôs had
---
That‚Äôs no buddy :( 
---
I'll start looking. Sounds awesome lol
---
Gotcha!
---
Service entrance.... less annoying... where can I find such a thing
---
Letting the team know about this feedback. Thank you for sharing memebone :)
---
THIS! is the correct answer. Look at the 2 most overly priced plans possible. Signs and letters, neon signs and letters. The 2 camp objects that could be used for spelling profanity. Also with Bethesda wanting to appeal towards younger audiences with the online aspect, it would've come into consideration
---
Thank you for uploading this so it can be addressed by Bethesda as soon as possible.
---
I would ask yourself if you really want to do a full convert to a rifle build. 
---
Melee is so strong, and you already have 15 str. Hell, I'd be more inclined to go full shotgun with that. Enforcer is fucking stupid. 
---
Yeah, it's weird they don't have a lock mechanic. If  you ever sell it and it doesn't show up in the vendor you just need to exit and trade again, and then the items will show up. (Just for future reference)
---
A man of *culture*
---
Do you have Paladin paint? ps4?
---
Use the psn quick menu to display you as offline then back to online. It will refresh and fix the social menu. 
---
This and a "laughing hysterically" emoji is much needed.
---
I had a behemoth follow me from somewhere on the golf course to the white springs bunker and then dome me from behind, so my I assume they can spawn there as well
---
Yea man, yw.
---
I think this hotfix for it is a pathetic joke, and they need to beat the SOURCE of it.
---
I absolutely love how the CAMP is hidden from the main road. Great CAMP mate!
---
while you can mix and match weapons you need to pick a single type to specialize in otherwise late game mobs will grind you up
---
2handed melee is "the best" atm as well as heavy weapons but shotguns and snipers are decent with the right perks
---
pistols are bad if i remember due to the lack of damage perks but this may change with dlc
---
Ill add you later when I get on, you can hop to me at Harpers and deal on some screws
---
Maybe, but the majority of the players, especially dupers, would probably move to a community server where custom rules can be set, so most items would just dissappear from the public server economies circulation.
---
Sink 3 into Tank Killer in Perception. 
---
Nothing better to do. Was it in a field, trees, road?
---
I have an explosive shotgun, but I opted to not using it because its so dangerous in enclosed areas
---
Meh... leave the Libertarians to themselves.  At least they are trying to do something to combat the scorched.  We all know the Enclave is the true enemy here.    
---
All the same, I'll happily hijack their power armor and nuke cards.  Just because they are the enemy doesnt mean they dont have useful stuff.  
---
Ad Victoriam!
---
I presume its more along the lines of stability and technical limitations
---
I was at the doctors office last week and there was a big box of clipboards.  I so strongly wanted to "loot" them all for springs 
---
Under 1k? Like under 1000 caps? Never heard of this please explain! 
---
I'm honestly not sure it will come this patch even tho I highly want it too. Maybe the next big one but I still have hopes I'll keep posting my thoughts about it 
---
Huh, that's really cool!  Thanks for the info!  I'm not much of a server hopper but I'll try and poke around there from time to time.
---
Well legendaries don't stop weapons above their lvls and mole mines cap a lvl 40. Luckily even the lvl 40 Two shots, explosives and TSEs are still hella good. 
---
actually, bud, the first reply shot doesn't do any damage. They got plenty of shots on me before my first hit. It was also a 3v1, with players around my level. Both of the 21/22 levels could have used the same weapon I was using, bar the rifle which I didn't use after the first missed shot. I didn't "come to reddit seeking approval and a pat on the back" I posted it because I thought it'd be a fun story.
---
Hey Blades - I know this is a popular request from the community so I've already shared this with the team (there was another trending post about it too). Thank you for taking the time to make the suggestion
---
If you're wondering how many floors you can do, the answer seems to be 4 if you want a roof. When I did 5 the other day I could not put a roof on it. Error message said it was out of the buildable area. Which is a shame because I wanted the Red Rocket sign on top... haven't been able to put that sign on anything over 2 stories.
---
I should have added I'm on Xbox. Sorryüò• it's mostly stuff that would take a new person a bit to find though. 
---
Well duh, i think the missles you've been handling irl have been shoddy
---
*Laughs in 1.9 pound laser gatling*
---
Go to the duper mart if you're only going to spend 3k. They're worth a lot more than that to those who grind them out. 
---
Legendary Scrapping would definitely go a long way for the game. As well as being able to produce said Legendary Weapons, or re-roll the attributes. Such things could always be balanced out by making the resource requirement expensive, or by adding in the chance of the weapon breaking for good (unless you have other materials to prevent that). There are loads of MMOs out there that combine these attributes so that it doesn't make one part of the system useless. As it stands, why craft a weapon when you can grind for a legendary version of said weapon? Sure it may be a long time but eventually you'll find some legendary that fits the bill.
---
For the Refined Junk weight, that definitely should not count towards the stash limit. That probably should be some other kind of storage like a depository where we stash our resources. For balancing purposes, all players start out with a space that holds up to X units of each raw resource type in the game. You have your "boxes" for aluminum, steel, etc. Over time these storage boxes could be upgraded with whatever resources or caps to hold more. Obviously not all resources will have the same amount of storage. Make certain rare ones more expensive to upgrade etc.
---
If you want to pretty up the concept, just give us a miniaturized version of the Motherlode Digger for our CAMP. Accessing it allows us to stash only raw materials. Advertise it as some Hornwright &amp; Vault-Tec joint venture if you want to whip it up lore wise. All players have a personal underground bank along with a personal mini digger unit. It's free to access at your cap, but costs caps to summon it at far off locations. I don't think that would break anything in the game. It's already easy to just pay to have your camp moved to stash your junk, or find the nearest train station.
---
I imagine just hearing the oncoming sound of a chainsaw...
---
 and then seeing that crazy hillbilly from the horizon running towards me.
---
Whats weird is when I went there the first time there was a space monkey looking down at a panda bear. Now its not there anymore :(
---
DM your ticket number and order number I‚Äôll look into it 
---
typo.. was suppose to say under 10k ..sorry for the confusion 
---
I‚Äôve have been farming for the last hour and no more clipboards are spawning do I need to wait 24 hours or something 
---
Likely means under 10k
---
Did any of you take the time to read his story?
---
I tried.. but I refuse to finish. Sorry man
---
I don't care if you're a middle man or the exploit discovered, you're spreading it and it's fucking stupid.
---
I remember that box! It killed me too. If I remember correctly it was across a lake? 
---
Higher level areas bring more weapon variety but are also level-locked so you can find new gear but may not be able to equip it yet. Toxic Valley (up north. you will know when you're there) has more challenge and new gear to find, I might recommend going there around level 10-15+ but you can explore earlier if you are careful to avoid the monsters like Snallygasters and such.
---
The most fun and challenge you can probably have with the game is opening your map, finding a landmark that looks interesting, and just going there. Supplies of any sort are only scarce if you aren't exploring. Caps, XP, and Stimpaks are mostly earned from quests/events, so farming those works, but if you really want to, you can leech off of higher level players around Whitesprings by poking as many enemies as you can. That is the de facto feral ghoul farming area. I say just go on an adventure instead of doing menial things, that's when the game is at its best.
---
I think it would be cool to have a "I come in peace" emote
---
It was on a somewhat open dirt area. I remember passing a downed yellow plane. That‚Äôs all I can remember sadly. I was so focused on running to loot it. Then before I can remember it, I was attacked by the beast :(
---
Field. I passed a downed yellow plane. Box was on a somewhat open dirt field.
---
Huh..........NAH! That can't be it.
---
South of Morgantown. And no. (I do have a medium water purifier stuck in limbo... Maybe some phantom wire too)
---
If you‚Äôre still defending fallout 76 you‚Äôre part of the problem. Not to mention it‚Äôs ‚Äúfans‚Äù like you that give bethesda the impression they can release games of the same series years and years apart with the same glitches the previous games released with even though it was patched, fixed and modded for free by its fans. 
---
They just bug sometimes
---
There were paragraphs and line breaks when I wrote this. 
---
It seems like after the backlash from the fo76 launch Bethesda essentially went radio silence on everything important but the inside the vault, community managers, and pr tweets. Their customer service just shut down and even pete Hines is radio silent except retweets. 
---
If you could get a bunch of assassin's/sentinels at low levels.. Yeah you really would be
---
Hey Belyal - while I can't answer your question right now, I can share this feedback with the team. Thank you for this.
---
PS: very jealous that you got a TSE Gauss Rifle :)
---
Personally, I think anything that's faved (or on your wheel) should prompt you with a confirmation dialog if you choose to sell, drop or scrap it. I lost one of my favorite guns the other day. How? I don't know, probably hit R instead of E in the heat of battle. Now it's just another brown paper bag somewhere in the wasteland.
---
Don't you talk about Chally that way...
---
The one on the right looks like a deranged Ronald McDonald. Lol
---
It will come back im sure, likely after releasing another high sought after item to try and force people to buy Atoms after they exhausted the in game ones.
---
Yes, I hate needing the weight reduction cards too. Considering how many their are though, I highly doubt Bethesda would remove them all and reduce the weight of guns and mods. However, I do think that every (or at least most) weight reduction cards should be moved to Strength. A major bonus in strength is increasing your base carry capacity, so why not include weapon weight reduction perks there too?
---
I had a bleeding laser gatling gun on FO4. That was waaay better I think. I could light something up then turn a corner and wait for it to die two seconds later.
---
How did you get the cat?
---
That should be fine for now
---
Hey you guys
---
Repeat that to yourself and tell yourself how attacking me has anything to do with the issues at hand.
---
good call.  what platform you play on?   im Counterpointa on PS4
---
I agree. You posting it here they will see that video a lot faster. So they can fix it instead of a band aid patch.
---
I've seen several people mention clans/guilds, how are people managing them seeing as there's nothing in game about it?
---
Lots and lots of little quality of life stuff, but it's all been posted about quite a bit.
---
Probably the biggest two pieces of advice I'd give a new player are to not sweat the card choice nearly as much as the SPECIAL choice.  You get lots and lots of cards so don't feel like picking one locks you into a weapon forever.  You can shift your SPECIAL around but it's a pain, so try and have a rough idea what you want for baseline stats at least.  I recommend 3 points in every stat so you can make use of most of the cards at max rank - they all pretty much have something good.
---
Watch your weight.  It adds up fast and you kind of need to poke through your inventory menu to find it all.
---
The 9mm is literally just a browning Hi-power. 
---
[browning hi power in 9mm](https://i.imgur.com/YBTyRII.jpg) 
---
The .45 pistol from honest hearts is a 1911.
---
I would very much like either of those things m‚Äôlord Howard...
---
My God, I was told this SR was full of hardcore FO76 dickriders. This is so true. 
---
I've server hopped maybe 2-300 times at this point and never once have I seen the jetpack.  I'm level 115 now and started hopping around level 40.  I've found a few stealth boys and reactive plates, though the latter both mysteriously disappeared from my inventory after a few days - CS apparently had no means of discerning if I ever had them or where they had gone.
---
Are you legit downsie? You're spreading the exploit. 
---
To put it in simple terms for someone like you:
---
Exploit=Bad
---
Spreading exploit= Bad
---
Get it yet?
---
They're pretty cool.  I generally avoid attacking them and just sit and watch them roaming around.
---
How much does 1400 razorgrain weigh with thru hiker
---
I'm sorry too. I really did try to edit and break it up to make it easier to read. No idea why the line breaks went away. 
---
Yes I‚Äôm a troll lol.... you know these things about me.
---
I‚Äôm not trying to be evil about it.
---
I probably have so much phantom wire lol. Luckily water purifier never hit me. They honestly need to just make wire free with the next camp QOL change. I don't understand the need for it to cost so much if anything.
---
Yes. I don't know how many dropped bags you can have at one time. 
---
nah.  
---
even a lvl 5 super mutant can nuke ya.  
---
adapt, overcome, survive.  
---
Watch out for Grief errand toxic players. Always take Screws,Gears,and Springs
---
It looks similar to a colt 1911, you can't deny
---
Ok ok I like it :)
---
No
---
Thanks for the suggestion mate - While I've previously let the team know about this feedback, I'm going to share this thread as well.
---
Have you tried joining another server
---
I belive you didnt play RDR2 for 300 hours as I did in fallout. In my country every single one beer producing company have their own competition and won some award, that means nothing. RDR2 is reskined GTA V and nobody cares. 
---
Ahh, thank you. Now, to find some friends! 
---
You replies this 25 minutes after Bethesda replied to the thread though. They have been kinda inactive on Reddit though since the whole "we gonna be gud" in the second week.
---
Let's just hope it was holiday related.
---
Thank you, can‚Äôt ask any of my irl friends because none of them bought it because of its reputation
---
Bah. Bamboozled myself.
---
I think the mutation roulette is a pain in the ass.  Once again I caught empath so once again I'll end up popping rad-away and watching my useful mutations go away.  I swear the garbage mutations are always the last to go as well.
---
Serum recipes are starting to infiltrate my play group so I can get a lot of the ones I'm fond of back, but it's still a nuisance.  Some of them I don't have easy access to either and I just kind of accept that they are gone until a lucky radiation hit.
---
If you need adhesive just plant some tato, corn, and mutfruit and have a water purifier. Bulk adhesive is my main sale item at vendors now and I still have at least 15bulked for crafting.
---
Or do this. Either way.
---
Wish the pitcher plants had springs and screws. 
---
I would expect that it would not work, as cannibal should count as meat. 
---
Would only need sentinel under 5 as pvp is disabled until then. At that point, only way you can die is if someone trains mobs onto you. Be in a safe spawn or have adequate gear, no longer a problem! Walk around with that 10k steel you swear was worth holding onto and someone is totally going to buy it for top caps one day.
---
Ok. Your comment made me realize what the problem is... We need to start murdering these single player game multiplayer gamers. Send them back to fo4
---
Double line breaks
---
For new paragraphs
---
Yes multiple. Idk if I‚Äôm missing something or not. My marker is on the terminal tho. The start of the quest was bugged with finding Ella‚Äôs research. Took jumping servers to fix that problem.
---
I‚Äôm not too sure. But I did find a tiny lake nearby the area in red with a water purifier.
---
Google is your friend
---
What you mean you didn't get anything ? You got a legendary weapon.
---
I said the community managers are active in my post if you read it. The community managers are ones who reply on reddit.
---
Only have eight words for you Bethesda... Fix the constant disconnection from servers on PC!!!
---
This is why when I got my first mutation, Marsupial, I got starched genes 2 asap and left it at that. I will grind caps for the serums so I don't have to deal with it. 
---
Thank you! After about 3 months this may be the last one I do. I think we have exhausted the format and many of the comments have turned into 'wish list' type requests.
---
As such, I won't be deleting it or anything but it might be worth archiving the list for your own uses.
---
While many of us are not happy with the launch, just as many of us really enjoy the game and want it to improve and get better. This list is my small effort into making it so, although it is little more than creating a shopping list put forth by the community hopefully it helps with a centralized list of tweaks that many of us (not all) would hope to see. 
---
Please pass on that there are many of us that enjoy playing the game and are looking forward to its longevity. Hopefully the community and bethesda can come to an accord when it comes to things like the atom shop and some of these tweaks, changes and additions.
---
Thank you for the reply, and if there is ever anything I can do please let me know, I am normally a lurker on gaming subreddits but always willing to help.
---
Isn‚Äôt there a pacifist mode? And thanks jll look out for those items
---
Max out rifleman perks
---
Submit a bug report to the devs on Twitter 
---
Yep, weapons are definitely level locked, so I don't really get the issue. 
---
Fact is, RDR2 online shows massive potential at it's beta stage with lots to build upon. FO76 has lots of potential too, but it's a fully released game. 
---
Also aluminium from ski poles
---
Another minor thing is to be mindful of CAMP placement. If you are a lower level you don‚Äôt need to be moving to a higher level area. There are maps on the Internet that show recommended levels
---
No I am on PC and my house got blown up because there were a couple of camps at the back of the golf house with turrets so I think people just started destroying everything :P
---
I have moved much further away now.
---
This has been pointed out and I shared that thread with the team. However, going to share this too so they know it's a widespread issue. Thank you Fallout nerd!
---
Right there with ya. I truly believe Beth listens to the community, making most heavy complaints happening (stash limit, playee vendors, etc...) and NPCs have been a HUGE issue for lots of people. 
---
So, yeah, maybe those vaults will have people or ghouls or SOMEone. And, if not then, then later a Chinese Invasion Crew mighy role in and set up shop in the forest.
---
Or Western Raiders might hear if an unclaimed territory and make their way in.
---
Or BoS could set up shop and give er another go.
---
Anything is possible. But I'm with you and thinking that ONE of those vaults are gonna have a bunch of Doe-eyed npc noobies peeking out.
---
Like us, at one time!
---
Most if not all legendaries should see a rebalance for both pve and pvp.  
---
Right now, effects are either "overpowered" or useless.
---
Little do you know but there's actually a lot more out there
---
I see a car henge, trailers with PA at a dump site but no plane yet
---
nty
---
Are you kidding me you don't kill them for meat?
---
I feel the radius of explosive ammo should be nerfed for the sake of not killing ourselves on accident.
---
Yeesh. What I, as in specifically me, would recommend? I'd say do your absolute best to form your own opinion of the game and find your own way. There's so many people floating positive and negative opinions and ideas, it's gotten to a point where outsiders and new players looking in don't know what to think or where to start anymore. Just do your best to make of the game what you see in it, not what others idealize or vilify.
---
If you're asking specifically for things in the game to do, I'd say follow overseer quests and others as they pop up. Get a feel for the gameplay and what you think is fun. Follow that rabbit and go from there. Quests are a good source of XP and sleep in beds and play instruments when you can for bonuses. You'll find badass armor, weapons, and outfits on enemies, in the environment, or as quest rewards. Case in point, the firebreathers have a really nice suit you get just for doing quests for em. 
---
If you go in your program files and dig until you find the fallout76.exe, run as admin and once you open the game it should prompt you to enter your email and password again.
---
Best advice I‚Äôve got.
---
You press Enter twice
---
Oh yea, so simple, to turn raw information I provided as a service to attack me.
---
What? Not even a thank you?
---
Or maybe another perk should have like a blast shield affect?
---
They're freeware, so anytime you want. 
---
Place a generator and then a power connector of some sort on the roof/wall and attach a wire between them
---
It's actually just as good without the blow, problem is you have to actually enjoy golfing
---
Sorry for late comment, but did we ever figure out if legendary forest scout armor drops? 
---
Explosive resistance?
---
wait what.. 
---
Yeah!
---
Thank you, I already placed down my camp and then lost it cause I was attacked and didn‚Äôt realize it cost caps to move :(
---
I hear you.  Unfortunate because it's a really fun game and I don't think most people get the "super broken" bugs.
---
I'd run a search on "beginner's tips" or something.  There's a fair bit discussed.  Game has evolved a little but not really.  There's a little bit of base-hunting going on as the high level players are running low on content so maybe stick it somewhere a bit out of the way.
---
What's up with the new hive mind zombies saying "quality of life" for everything?
---
Take your time.  
---
actually there are hope. technically console players can still play on community servers if the game itself has it allowed. (ie. ARK, any Valve games)
---
What's up with the new hive mind zombies saying "toxic" for everything
---
To be fair, Bethesda ordered the hit on Bethesda.
---
Yea also placing your camp within city limits can cause enemies to chase you
---
That's okay! We are looking at the forums every single day for the top feedback and quality of life requests - so don't feel like these will go unheard if you stop.
---
We definitely know that you are enjoying the game and we appreciate all of you for your dedication and support. It means a lot to us to see your love for the game.
---
Equally, we also incredibly appreciate the constant bug reports, constructive criticisms and quality of life requests. These are very important and we take them seriously.
---
Thank you for being awesome mate.
---
LMAO ok
---
Sure
---
*pats back*
---
GOOD JOB 
---
Like, who wouldn‚Äôt?
---
I see no one really believes you, but this is definitely plausible. Once ddosed, unplug your modem and router for 15 minutes or so. This should release your current IP address (the one being attacked) and renew it with a fresh IP.
---
Great to hear from Bethesda themselves on this issue! And please, Fallout Nerd's my dad's name. Call me fellas
---
WAIT! The marker is over the terminal but there is a panel above and next to the terminal you have to click first.  So for now I have it figured out.
---
Exactly. If I hit your base while it's at whitespring, you better believe it's coming down... Caps be damned
---
I don't know why but I'm honestly surprised by the genuinely good info for starters in this thread. The food/water prep and weapon specializing tips particularly I wasn't expecting. It's really nice that no one's gotten in here yet to be a contrarian.
---
All mexicans r d bags.
---
Why didn't you bring it back to the store? Usually they hold onto  few collectors editions at the warehouse for when/ if this does happen
---
Ive actually just started an alt that im trying to get to 50 before i do any story quests. That way ill get lvl 50 rewards every time and wont feel wasted. If they did implement you being able to upgrade quest gear thatd be a treat
---
How much did it cost ro rebuild? Did you switch servers?
---
Happens very frequently for us on PS4 too, either invisible with a nameplate, invisible with no nameplate, or naked.  Zoning, fast traveling, and even going in &amp; out of power armour causes this to occur.  Seems to be anything that makes the character model actually load.
---
When you passed the plane, were you going north? I just found the plane and some burnt out 18 wheelers close to the car henge.
---
I‚Äôll make sure to not make it stick out too much, cause my plan before was to put it on top of the tallest hill I can find so it‚Äôs easier for me to find

No one else knows more than that.

I tell myself that but I just can't free up 2 slots in Luck to sacrifice for it.  I hate running Class Freak as it is but I've accumulated so dang many mutations it makes sense to run it.
---
Really wish Starched Genes was in Endurance.
---
That's pretty much where I'm at too. The problem is the game ends up competing with FO4, and it's not winning that competition. I haven't played at all in a couple weeks now, and frankly I don't see myself ever going back unless/until they fix the perk system so I can do a build I actually want to play. I don't see them ever being willing to change the game that much, so I expect I'm probably done.
---
Thanks fellas ;)

Atom Shop,

There's nothing wrong with a mule, it's a mule with 50k cola flux and dozens of duped tse weapons. 
---
You might want to read Rule #9 of this subreddit.
---
And theres a point where relogging is the best solution.
---
Mind if I ask how to accuracy was on your two shot .50 cal? Im only asking because the one that I got a while ago has just the worst accuracy (and hip fire accuracy). 
---
Ive seen two shot weapons be less accurate, but this one I have is only useful as a slightly longer than melee range weapon for how inaccurate it is. This is all with me having the stability perk, too (which doesn't seem to increase its accuracy at all...but just for this one heavy weapon).
---
Swap Glow sight for Rank 3 tank killer, Definitely spring the 3 points in luck and get r 3 Torment. Get rank 1 tenderize. Invest your last 2 points To increase rifleman perks.
---
With this you know have 36% armor ignore, 15% chance to cripple a limb, and 10% more damage with rifles. Couple with everything else you have.
---
That about the best I can figure to round you out.
---
[Right here.](https://i.imgur.com/2jFi5ST.png) You enter/exit from the production area instead, so you don't have to open up the vault and use the elevator every time.
---
There's also the Resort Exit near the Military Wing that brings you right inside of Whitesprings Resort. I'm not sure exactly where it is in the resort, as I usually have to run around a bit to find my bearings and have only used it twice.
---
Both can be pretty handy.
---
It's always funny how Fallout never really explains how things work. I was building stuff for ages on Fallout 4 before I learnt how to turn on lights :P
---
So really you can have any generators in your camp (even just one small one) but what you will notice is you cant actually attach a wire to lights (except for spotlights, street lights and the yellow stand up ones). What you actually need to do is just get a power connector (the connectors that attach to the walls) and put it near a light/s and when it is in range the lights kick in.
---
I think you do start with a small generator, the power connnectors and some basic lights so you should be able to do it straight away. Apologies if this isn't what you were asking.
---
I feel hungry. I want tacos. :(
---
I've kind of built my spec around the idea of that. I don't think I'll need class freak. 
---
I don't like using 2 points for SG, but it's nice not to have to worry about it. And the carry weight is fantastic, the jumps help quite a bit in qol and getting into places you're not supposed to yet. 
---
I like this suggestion! Sharing with the team now. Thanks GeekzAnonymous 
---
Perfect.
---
Yeah. I was still heading north. I do remember seeing 2 trailers (one pickable) and a bunch of barrels. 
---
I want to second the idea that certain stackable items - like junk, ammo, aid etc. should not apply to your stash limit at all. Personally I feel the whole stash weight limit system is not needed and could be replaced with something similar to a Diablo 3 console type system of limiting based on number of items - for weapons/armor - for a more long term solution. 
---
The weight limit was introduced as an apparent workaround to problems with tracking the number of items on the server, but something to keep in mind is that these stackable items should be tracked as singular objects on the server (example: 99 stimpacks in your stash would be an object with value 99) - so they should not be contributing significantly to the item tracking issue from a computational standpoint. In fact, many players already will have at least one of many types of junk/aid/ammo - just from playing the game normally. So I expect it is the other more complex and non-stackable items the server is having issues with ultimately - these could be limited directly rather than using the weight limit.
---
Wrote a post about it here: [https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/a9ww0u/suggestion\_replacing\_stash\_weight\_limitation\_with/](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/a9ww0u/suggestion_replacing_stash_weight_limitation_with/)
---
Iirc this is the way the handheld Pokemon games get around people nicknaming their Pokemon for online vs. 
---
i mean no xp no caps  just that one armor piece 
---
If all items were equal whats the point, would too easy to get best in slot. Damage is done with duping unfortunately 
---
Just a standard leveled machete for me...  If I just had a hockey mask
---
Power Connectors.
---
Try playing and testing them out separately from your house. Just build a wall, light, generator on the ground and practice.
---
I don't know it's not your Nuke maybe it's not your right to get XP there
---
Wait, what? 
---
This warms my heart :)
---
 I've got the same type of set up, but the caveat is that those perks don't affect your stash, a fat man will weigh its true weight if stashed, regardless of perks or equipment. Plus if they want those bonuses they'll have to both level that character to unlock the best versions, and devote a portion of their mule management time to finding those weight reducing items. 
---
When I read your post I remembered I got stuck with the same issue but I couldn't remember how I got passed it. It was the same as you said, there us a panel above the computer  :P
---
I'm game. My psn is AvengedClayFoldX add me. I'll be home in roughly 30 mins or so
---
Oh gosh just thinking about it I miss it the spread on that gun was pretty bad. But still accurate. I think the two shot made the gun a bit more inaccurate but still manageable 
---
I'd really like to stay away from the legal action side of this situation.
---
Thats probably a great idea as the only recourse you have is small claims and they aint even gonna show up for that.
---
Not currently but I have let the team know about this feedback previously.

Uhhhh ok... good luck with that
---
Kinda wondering if they are level gates, like the Handmade plans, and the 10mm plsns?
---
Server hopped for 6 hours looking for handmade plans with my level 100, nothing... rolled a new character, got it to level 15 (minimum level to use the handmade) and wham 2nd hop found it, friend said it was luck, 3 hopes, got another.
---
For the 10mm, Charleston Vendor Bot, level 5 new character, 2 hops Wham found it. Had been periodically  checking all responder bots with my level 100, to no avsil.
---
After reading the above posts, as well as hopping for about 6 hours myself, and a friend I have has been hopping, for literally  days, 12 hours a day for the past 3 days. And nothing.
---
I am wondering is a level (35?) Lowest level for x01? Could get it?
---
the tiny server player maximum could be easily managed by the owner simply increasing them. the only thing they had to manage is checking what is the maximum player count their server can handle before it starts having problems.
---
other than that, 24 players isn't really that tiny, and I have seen a lot of community servers from other games having both players that prefer to play during the day and the other who plays from the start of the night (either due to sleeping patterns or from different region).
---
and honestly, this game probably has more playerbase than you might think (seeing with the game having a 75% discount on the holidays).
---
I wouldnt focus too much on farming legendaries when youre that low of a level. Youre just gonna end up finding a better upgrade.
---
Oh, someone else did this on ps4.
---
I think because the first couple you did use the computer for the mission and then the bone one looked like it was pointing to the computer but it wasnt....
---
Nice!
---
Not yet.  Not sure I'd want any to be honest.  Legendary effects on regular armor is one of the balancing points to actually using it.
---
I killed him. I'm still salty but not as salty xD
---
I thought it was "Modern Paintings", which should be at Whitesprings.  Not positive on that though.
---
I was at the white springs the other day and was confused why my house was there but it turned out to be someone else's that just looked very similar to mine.....
---
What is "the website"?
---
I can confirm Nukacrypt has the correct code
---
Why is this dig at OP needed?
---
Did you have to rip its poor little eye out?
---
#1 if you think that this giant company is going to appear at a small claims summons (Sure youll win by default but they will never pay), ive got some property in Mexico to sell ya.  
---
The big part (and probably the best part) is that in every automated help ticket Ive even encountered they specifically tell you not to do what you are going to do.  Why?  It puts you at the back of the line every time you edit, or respond to the ticket.
---
It gets around it by reducing your carry capacity to &lt; 0, but those inventory number still get flagged as red, and from what I've seen they still have the little red bag symbol on their hud. 
---
Have the code lined up like damage effect trigger on character capacity +1000. 
---
I got the light box plans for defending a workshop, but you can buy them from Harpers Ferry. Don't know if there's a guaranteed spawn.

Only if you don't want to use the nice stairs that only take up two tiles and still allow walls.   They save budget.

But just for the sake of getting along I'll concede the point.  Mainly because it's pool night and I've had a few beers. Beer makes me a jolly good fellow. 
---
Anyone can lawyer up.  IN this case it would be small claims and Bethesda isnt going to show up.  Youll win by default and never see a dime.
---
Please allow us to see what notes/plans/recipes we already own when browsing vendors
---
I hardly ever see them at vendors (and I do vendor circuits very frequently), but they do seem to be a common-ish workshop defense reward.
---
Make a day of taking 5-6 workshops and defending them I'd say.  You'll get a lot of bonus plans in the process.
---
This might help. (It‚Äôs the new dupe glitch)
---
Yes unless its changed. 
---
The item must be originally the pistol version and modified with the stock into a rifle. Both mods would apply. Wont last long they fixed explosive shotguns on the grenade launcher as it was flagged as both. 
---
Yikes.
---
Might wanna check this out
---
Legally youll be entitled to the amount you spent.  This puts you in small claims court only.  They will never show.  Sure youll win, but they wont pay a dime.
---
I noticed in really popular areas like Whitesprings it happens a lot.
---
So if someone has a camp even slightly close to yours (even outside of your buildable area) it seems to count it as being taken. There must be a minimum distance that camps need to be at from each other.
---
I got my massive built house kicked off a few times because someone put down just a box and nothing else.
---
Problem with that is, with the exception of PvP events I imagine, everyone doing the event is considered to be on a team and friendly fire is disabled. I've seen this firsthand in both the Protest March event in Grafton (where some guy came in with a rocket launcher and didn't trigger PvP when he hit enemies all around me) and the Collision Course event at Morgantown Airport (where I accidentally hit someone else doing the event and it still didn't trigger PvP).
---
That would be funny

Is not that I don't understand it, I just think it's a really petty thing  to complain about.

THANK YOU I thought that was another broken plan! Couldn't find it in build and had been ignoring the fertilizer thing not thinking I needed it. 
---
it would keep up player morale if they gave us an update on what Qality of Life fixes they are planning on implementing. 
---
So far we really have no idea what they are working on, what to expect in 2019, or how much support they are planning on for this game.
---
At least if they had a dialogue with us, let us know what they think they can fix, how long to expect to have to wait for the fix, it would give us some hope.
---
Right now all we have is radio silence.
---
Youtube search fallout 76 critical hits. There is a glitch that shows how to get infinite critical hits. Might be patched. But anyways he showcases the 100% hit rate except on rockets. 
---
Around 60 ideally. A lot of high damage builds require more than 50 levels to work. 60 lets you get more high level perks and better gear at lvl 50 before you go in. You could probably contribute at 50, much lower and you are likely more of a hinderance to a group. The queen scales health based on participants so if you can‚Äôt keep up in damage you are making it harder by being there. 
---
yawn 
---
Shotguns probably, though I don't know how they'd do it.
---
Other than that I think they are ok-ish.  Lord knows I kill myself with one frequently enough.  Biggest part is getting access to Demo Expert that affects overall damage, not just the explosive part.  I guess if they nerfed that to just the explosion you might see a bit less emphasis.
---
Its holiday season, im sure as most retail locations are they are dealing with a ton of tickets and processing in the order received. I have worked construction, banking, retail, and now a government job. Its interesting that in all of those professions you get people who just cannot be realistic and understand sometimes things take time, especially during busy seasons. If you want faster support or service, you are going to need to pay more for the company or agency in order for them to be able to higher more staff. Its true some companies do not give a crap,but this is a minority and generally there are things happening behind the scenes you are not aware of. 
---
Saying things like " How fucking terrible can you possibly be at your job?" makes me wonder what you do for a living, and what jobs and industries you have worked in previously. You either lack empathy, or understanding for the situation. It can be frustrating to have to wait longer than you would want, but this is also your fault. You bought something around a season when deals happen often, found a better deal and bought it wanting to refund during a super busy refund season. Is there a stipulation on how fast refunds will be resolved, or just a window in which you can request a refund? 
---
Im sure I may get downvoted, but I think you are acting super unrealistic, entitled, and showing a lack of empathy and understanding for the situation. Honestly regardless of the jobs I have had, it is people with your mentality I hate dealing with the most.

I've heard tell that an abundance of twelve year olds got 76 for Christmas due to it's substantial price drops so there may just be a bunch of sociopathic children running around.

You have to be in a group and wearing specific outfits. Highlight the challenge title to see the details.

I do believe the plane is south of the dump site.

You have to wear certain outfits and coordinate that with someone else for it to count. 
---
Use a power source, like a generator.

Here is the new method for duping:
---
Question, are the tamed creatures meant to defend/attack? I have heard stories of them doing it for others but my idiot death claw just let's enemies wail on him and to my knowledge has never attacked. I've had to stop him being killed by multiple mobs and he's never once defended himself or even attacked any of the critters that wander around. Is he broken? Can I get a refund?
---
Nothing applies to camps. Someone can come in and destroy your entire camp without triggering PvP or even becoming wanted. It doesn't even give you a message saying someone is attacking your camp.
---
Pick up and move the CAMP box. That has something to do with where you spawn in. 
---
This is either a bug or not a player that killed you.  From personal experience during nuked whitesprings I die a lot seemingly randomly, and its not from other players. Ill go from 30-40% health to instantly dead, and I think theres a bug involved or lag. I can tell you testing outside of that zone with a TSE handmade, gauss, and black dragon, that it does not typically work this way or is allowed to happen. So either a bug, or not a player killing you.
---
Yeah, I'm starting to hear that line of thinking in my play group.  "Nothing else to do, let's go grief."
---
PvP mode will help a lot I think.
---
Tried that doesnt matter where I put it I end up in a wall
---
Why not both. The .45 will have the higher damage output and there's already a ton of .45 littered around Appalachia

I‚Äôm guessing *really* fixing the dup bugs, not just masking particular ones but changing the strategy so that one can start to have faith that they‚Äôre eliminated, may involve changes to the strategies around not having to get confirmation from the server ahead of time to approve every change to your inventory i.e. the strategies that are already letting you not have it be increadibly laggy to do basically anything with your inventory. 
---
The non-games-specific more universal thing to note is that the worst part of changing a feature is keeping it working with all the 100 features you already committed to and implemented.  If it‚Äôs ‚Äúback to the drawing board‚Äù for some more fundamental aspects of the game, then of course it‚Äôs going to be expensive to change everything else to work with that feature, where all the other parts of the game already assumed that this part of the game worked a certain way, and maybe you won‚Äôt know until testing or users discover the... inconsitency... that you introduced.
---
I doubt it matters too much what is ‚Äúengine‚Äù and what isn‚Äôt.  It‚Äôs not like there‚Äôs anything in this that Bethesda can‚Äôt change if they want to.  However, it sounds like an easy way for the speaker to say, assuming they have the knowledge that we hope they do, that this is a more fundamental change that‚Äôs going to take more commitment and time and testing such that it‚Äôs not just going to be in a new minor patch to the game.
---
It was late November patches in December were announced, one on the 4th, the 11th and the 19th. The one on the 11th and 19th were delayed by a day or two if I remember right. So let's be optimistic and say about two weeks before we get the first patch, but it won't be the things we want right now, like vending

I took down the Queen earlier. I was a level 99 entering the fight. My two other teammates were 101 and 109. A bunch of other people were no higher than 55. A bunch of mid-level 30s and we took down the Queen with about 4 minutes left in the event.

If it was profitable to make happy articles they would be doing that instead. 
---
Bethesda threw their fanbase under a bus and made a lot of people angry. They pissed off enough people that demand for the negative press is greater than the demand for positive.
---
Just like any elastic market, eventually the demand will go away and the supply will stop soon after. For the moment, best to completely avoid similar media to this because all your doing is adding to their bottom line.

To respond to your question, Yes, these organizations know they are spewing bullshit. Until it ceases to be profitable, they don't care.

Oh, maybe AI should read after 6am, too early. Though they have been rather silent recently (lootboxes rumors etc) though I haven't played recently all I do is sell stuff for caps waiting for next patch..
---
Ever been on twitch? 
---
Unlike synths they do not need to die a quick glance at their inventory will tell you.
---
Got 1.2 tonnes of items you got a duper..
---
Got 25k caps and 100k nuka colas you got a duper...
---
Someone has 25 of every type of TSE weapon you got a duper....
---
They are very easy to spot since the ones i have seen are pretty darn open about it... thanks Bethesda for that!.
---
He's winking
---
Is the team not aware of how common these are now? 
---
join me
---
I was more talking about the two shot prefix
---
That sucks
---
I've been disconnected seven times in a single night yesterday. Gets worse if you try to hold on Workshops. I tried capturing Mount Blair just to see how long I could get in the mining event before getting dc'ed and it literally happened in the first minute. Wish I had captured that.
---
It's just east of the raider camp that's north of Clancy manor
---
aight you dumbass
---
I checked out their base for a minute to see if there were turrets, I looked on the map to make sure they didn't leave the game, then I began claiming their base to get their attention but they didn't come. The defend workshop event happened and then the fight happened. I did indeed miss my first shots and used vats. I never said "Look at me, I'm an almighty god of combat, bow before me you imbecilic peasants"
---
You can't have fucking pacifist on and initiate slap damage combat, again you have no idea about game mechanics at all, you absolute fucking moron.
---
You seem like you're getting more angry every reply, and while the same goes for me, you seem irrationally invested in this.
---
This just in: Toxic water isn't full of rads, it's just very emotionally troublesome.
---
/joke
---
Nope. People have already found another way
---
then why the hell even have the tag feature? if i shoot something and someone kills it i get some xp so then just throw out the whole tag system
---
That sucks, guess we gotta wait 5 more months for them to try to fix it again 
---
Pacifist mode just makes it where you can't accidentally hurt someone. I turn mine on because there's no telling what I'll hit when I'm furiously super Sledging an enemy and my buddy is in there shooting too.
---
Online mode is the key phrase there
---
It came with a spectacular single player campaign, while we got this
---
Will do! Thanks for helping! 
---
more quality stuff from bethesda. cant wait for the next three titles which include the new elder scrolls to be released knowing that they are still using a Frankenstein's monster-esque game engine. a game engine that's core coding was put in place in the mid 80s (and cant be updated or replaced) i cant wait for more wooden/flavorless/cheap/broken animation, story, voice acting, modeling and textures that they refuse to put even a modicum of effort into crafting or polishing. i cant wait for them to think they can continue to nickle and dime us by making three more freaking games that are only ever passable as completed products after a myriad of modders, (who are far more talented then the dribble they employ at bethesda) spend hundreds of unpaid hours to make unofficial patches and bug fixes. i cant wait for bethesda to lower the bar yet another notch. 
---
; A ;
---
Yup, get used to those server crashes, they gon' last. 
---
Thanks for the clarification!
---
Harpers Ferry is where I got mine too
---
With cannibal and sunkist it's my normal I am bored farming for ammo
---
Yes please
---
it does not,dense however does. 
---
No crate yet, but I did find [this guy](https://i.imgur.com/Hp37cIv.jpg) lmao
---
Download the Bethesda launcher and you will have them I got fallout 1 2 and tactics
---
Add Por_QPine, I‚Äôll see you at V76!
---
Funny that‚Äôs the same excuse griefers give for killing newbies in any multiplayer game. Just because you can doesn‚Äôt mean you should. You have the right to be stupid and the world has the right to put you in your place for it.
---
Where at? This is the kinda stuff I wonder in a random direction for.
---
I like that PA is basically useless to scrap. If it wasn't, you would probably not find a set very often, just empty chassis.
---
Marine wetsuit is crazy cheap to make and has a ton of value
---
It's very, very likely they already are, but we continue to share these requests as they arise JUST in case and also to ensure they know how requested a particular suggestion is.
---
You can sever hop it out to find the bot. 
---
And 23agi + all armor pieces with ap regen. Map can not render so fast, PS4 blue screen sometimes. But being kangaroo stabing ninja is fkin fun.
---
I don‚Äôt think so, just as long as you have nuclear keycards then you should be good
---
The only heavy weapon I carry around is a backup Gatlin Gun that has 90% weight reduction on it. Really wish my rifle weighed 2lbs like it does, lol. I'd trade a +1 perception stat for weight reduction any day.
---
Yes, you need to be in the vicinity of where the quest starts from what I've noticed
---
The queen doesnt give exp, just loot that seems to scales with damage done to the queen.
---
You wanna farm mobs for xp at that level so a place with a lot of enemies like Grafton. Appropriate level super Mutants and then 3 different events. If you wanna make money too farm Mothman Eggs in Point Pleasant. Scorched are here but always low level. Make omelets to sell. When you're higher level, can't get one shotted, and want to farm Legendaries and make money too then go to the Whitespring Golf Club. Pick up all the golfing outfits should be about 3-9 and they sell for 20 caps minimum. Almost always high level ghouls. This will give you some variety of enemies
---
Oh so your the one that destroyed my fusion generation :|
---
So what do you do with the silver? It cant he bulked, right?
---

---
Explosive should only be a % chance. And shot gun should only have a single explosion.
---
Pick new perks. I kept on seeing a lockpick perk when I would choose a new perk from leveling up. But when I recently leveled up, I couldn't see lockpicking and hacker to choose as a new perk anymore. Im only one lvl away with wach to achieve a full set. But I can't remember if it was masterlock perk.
---
Generator plans come from Power Plant Events (powering up).  I think you get small as a default though.
---
You get a basic suite of electrical connectors as default.  Advanced power connections is an uncommon plan you can find at Watoga and Harpers.
---
Wires are strung in build mode when you don't have an item selected to build  Don't know what the key is on other systems but you highlight the object you want to string from and hit triangle on PS4, then just stick it to an appropriate connector.
---
Connectors radiate power a modest distance to power lights and whatnot.  A few devices need to be hardwired like terminals.
---
Oh gotcha that has ruined some aspects of the game for sure. 
---
there is also a bee bear
---
No problem. If u dont mind, just let me eat 1st, then I'll hop online
---
Idk are you on xbox?
---
My first time was the same experience, lmfao. 
---
What‚Äôs the Golden holotape?
---
i just found a Comrade chubs near the giant teapot but for some reason it wasnt in my inventory also thanks for the other ones i already new them but completely forgot
---
I think I was on pc at the time 
---
Is there any way to tell if you can actually do the quest again yet?
---
Yes it still works, and canned/pre war food is still good too.
---
Hey foundflame - I've been telling others to not stress if they haven't received a response yet after updating their ticket with the required info (i.e. name, username etc. on the receipt/invoice). There are a lot of requests and the support team is working their way through them. Rest assured, you will hear back.
---
Not me then, I play on xbox
---
This guy has 29 ivory grips... duping!!!
---
I found my chubs at the monorail elevator
---
Ok I‚Äôll have to keep hunting him down then lol
---
Or you can be grateful that they tried, be pissy with the people duping. I doubt you have any idea what work goes inte coding and game development. You can't just point at a problem and say fix it, doing that will only fuck it up more.
---
To be OP seems part of the Fallout Universe to me. This counts for PVE of course.
---
Give me GIN!!
---
Gl, the internet is pretty big, lol
---
The lockpick and hacker perks are walled by level requirements. You might not be high enough level to unlock rank 3 lockpick/hacker.
---
So much this. It actually kinda bums me out how many people are focused on getting the best of everything but not exploring and digging through things. That's where the best stuff is in the game...in my opinion. I'm not going to tell anyone how to have fun. But I've never wanted for any guns or materials or anything because I am a "run in a random direction" player.
---
They sure did a number on this place, didn‚Äôt they, *member*?
---
For high level player camps or turrets placed on camps that face into the club, I agree.
---
However, and this isnt necessarily a player issue so much as a developer issue, if high level players would stop camping the area, (even without a nuke zone or being at the resort) keeping ghouls permanently at level 60, then my level 13-20 ass wouldnt need to place a camp so close to the club with a turret when I'm running quests.
---
I found and killed my very first one today...at Whitesprings of all places during a nuke strike...it was a bit South and East of the normal action, I was looking for plants/flux. 
---
As an herbivore mutant, this is pretty helpful. Dope.
---
Eh, gotta have stretch goals to work towards.  It's about a week of "grinding" merchants for caps.  Pretty reasonable all told.
---
Ironically lighting takes up quite a bit of camp budget so I never actually put any up once I got the plan, short of an "Open" sign on a buddy's fresh camp.
---
It's narrated by a guy named Dick Shale. He says you've won a "free Extreme Adventure upgrade" and to go to the Uncanny Caverns at 10am on October 1st
---
I actually like that idea. A chance to fire an explosive round.
---
Wait a day after you've done it
---
I‚Äôm not sure why they didn‚Äôt have the quest giving rose command of her own radio station, just give her control over Appalachia radio. She may be a robot, but she‚Äôs got the most personality out of anyone(thing) in the game. 
---
still not a flat 50 making it easy and convenient to sell hell the skeleton is 65 but it creates odd numbers so you have to figure out something else to sell. Also the wetsuit weighs more and takes 3.5 times the materials to make.   
---
So uh yeah..no
---
What I mean is do I have to wait 24 hours exactly after finishing it 
---
You're going to want to move your camp and unbulk and stored blueprints.
---
If youre planning to store or scrap any item that requires wiring; make sure to scrap the wire first.
---
Hopefully one of the many mods on right now have seen this already.
---
I love this.
---
prolly whitesprings
---
Would it be better to have enforcer over tenderiser with a shotgun sidearm? right now the only thing I cant 1 shot is scorchbeasts 
---
Luck should effect the base durability (length of the cnd bar).  100% repair is full base durability, 200% is double base durability.    Int and crafting should work the same but I keep forgetting to actually test it.  If luck/int work any other way then I would assume they are bugged and not wai, as that aspect of them would be next to useless.
---
I'm also in a raider camp and built onto a cliff with cliff wall on one side. Had this problem for awhile but kept moving that box around on each load out or changing worlds and it's been good about it. Took me about 30 tries to stop spawning IN the cliff and then a few more to get me to stop spawning way up on top of it. Hope you find an acceptable spot. If I can just stop the scorchbeasts from coming over, Ill be set. 
---
I only tried it with the small ones
---
Assorted Lights has a bunch of lights other than the free default one you're given.
---
I am one from billions team. We killed more queens, than other people killed brahmins in flatwoods, haha. Not duped single shit (maybe bought something duped from market, buy you know, its hard to get those caps, so it is legal to buy them!!)
---
Now we are farming stuff and trying to figure out new builds. Did you know chainsaw can do insane damage too? There is reason to min/max, becouse **who will clear vaults first?** Those who knows which mechanics are strongest. I hope vanilla wow Naxx was easy in comparation to announced vault raids.
---
&gt; **Character names** should be shown, not gamer tags or screen names. Certainly not account names! (PC)
---
I hope if they ever change this, they will give us an option to change our characters name. I wasn't very creative with it because it never plays a role ingame (except being shown in our Pip Boy).
---
No lots of people do it do u got unlucky 
---
Unless you're wanted, then I'm coming to kill you.
---
idk if its placebo or not but i was crashing terribly every single day until a player told me to drop all the useless holotapes and notes i had. I had a ridiculous amount, too. ever since then my performance has seen a drastic increase and my daily crashes have become few.
---
I wish I had found this. I saw the civil war actor today with the union hat plan. 
---
There's one in the entrance to the overgrown vault in the Mire I think, but I couldn't do anything with that plant.
---
Oo most things.. I must try more
---
Okay fine, i won't kill your cow. Entirely coincidentially, mind telling me where your camp is ? \*loads instigating fatman\* ...delicious nuclear roast bramin... 
---
Swap the data in the esm for a 1st slot legendary effect, like anti armor. This would mean no more new TSE weapons, and all existing ones would be fixed. No weapons would lose legendary effects/stars
---
Ah maybe it‚Äôs my build then, high luck and charisma with super duper gets me a ton of these things
---
They couldn't bug it in our favor? So close! Larger camps... But no electricity booo!
---
Imagine being able to play caravan. Hell, imagine being able to actually advertise your settlement to those on your server...
---
Yeh someone edited their post or deleted it
---
I haven't seen this problem in any other game.  I'm sorry I have higher expectations than you. 
---
Try ditching your extra holotapes + notes but not plans or treasure notes.
---
I noticed less crashes and lag after clearing out those tabs a lot.
---
I'm working a night shift rn, but I'll get on when I'm home and post a pic of it in the grove. 
---
Ha
---
They dont even exust yet.
---
Don't take it personally. It's not you, it's them.
---
Camden park and the other place (sorry cant recall the name) Its the ferris wheel on the west coast. Both in the open, and inside containers. 
---
ya the event itself should give at least 1000 xp from completing it but no nothing

Here is the exact build I used tonight when I did 80% of the work load on the Queen [https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=f516d6a&amp;d=lt2ls2ip2ib1pe2s22pq1lu1l71sb2sa2s61s30sr0s01e60cu1cr0c52ic4s12ac2s72&amp;w=&amp;n=](https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=f516d6a&amp;d=lt2ls2ip2ib1pe2s22pq1lu1l71sb2sa2s61s30sr0s01e60cu1cr0c52ic4s12ac2s72&amp;w=&amp;n=)  
---
Like literally I did at least 80%, I died when she had a sliver left and they couldn't kill her until I got back watched them all die to the mobs around them and I killed her in 3 seconds her life hadn't moved.   
---
This is important 1 low player is fine at a queen when there is a group of experienced well equipped players. 13 sub level 40s and are you are making the others carry your ass and when there are a total of two players above level 50 you know not much is getting done. Still managed to kill er with 4 minutes left on the clock but man that was a close one. 
---
LOUD NOISES
---
i edited the map recently and took out soot flowers and rhodos as they are as common as dirt to make viewing easier and i put this map in the post again as the second link
---
I want to downvote this, but I dc'd earlier in a sea of 3* legendary ghouls, so i'll just say...
---
FUCK!

LOUD SCREECHING ENSUES
---
Thanks 
---
I agree with you. However we differ in the fact that you still play the game.
---
This site. Just drop your gamer tag and system 10 minutes prior and people will join. It‚Äôs what I do.
---
It's more like weekly. Some maybe longer. I go to the Black Hills location several times a day and have been doing so since finding it during Beta. Have only triggered it twice. Both times rewarded me with nothing interesting but speculating the mounted head plans should be won from it. 
---
THIS IS NOW AN ALL CAPS WAR!
---
The true final boss is the server disconnects.  It is the unbeatable enemy.  
---
Doesn't say dead servers anywhere, it's an article about the new years bug that was hotfixed. Do you seriously not see that?  
---
The game is struggling to maintain a steady playerbase considering it came out 2 months ago, none of my RL friends or in-game friends log in anymore. I play 30 mins a day maximum if I play at all. I used to log in to complete all daily/weekly challenges now I don't even bother with the harder ones to complete.  
---
The game is a joke even to people I know aren't really that into games on social media. The bugs need to be addressed much quicker than they are, I actually legit surprised they hotfixed the nuke glitch as quick as they did. (The one this article is referring to)  
---
Obviously this is my experience and yours may differ, but it by no means is only my experience. The issues and controversies are widely known and trying to pretend they don't exist doesn't help anyone in my opinion.
---
I didn‚Äôt get one.
---
That sounds so much better because free money
---
Ok cool. Does the queen scale with the number of players?
---
Short barrels are better close up and if you want to be able to accurately hip fire your weapon.
---
Still costs more materials to make and sells for less to the vendor. Therefore it is suboptimal. It is fine if you do not have other better plans but it is not cheap in comparison and its value is meh too. What is it like 37 to the vendor. 
---
Not a worry at all! 
---
Would love to get Queen Kill if you guys are on PS4. My game crashed several times already when we attempted to get it.
---
do you know the specific ones that are there?
---
If you finish out the enclave questline you get some exp, otherwise the queen is for end game loot.
---
Nuke whitesprings for exp
---
Most likely this, along with the red headlamp.
---
I killed one and felt bad afterward.  The are a marvel to watch.
---
My friends would pull mobs and if I didn't have an automatic, I'd blast em with a grenade to ensure I got a lick in before they were wiped out. Party members should most definitely share exp, how else are we going to spread out and clear a building while ensuring everyone benefits? Seems pretty basic.
---
Yes! I pick up loads of guns and armor to scrap for mods. Sometimes a bit of lag will cause me to accidentally scrap the weapon or armor I'm using. 
---
Also, when I'm in power armor, my regular armor doesn't show as equipped. There's been more than a few times that I've scrapped my current armor while in PA because I thought it was extra. üò£
---
Something like 2 separate notification windows (one being "scrap your favorite gun for 2 steel?" And the other being "this gun is marked as a favorite, are you sure?") would be great!!
---
T60 BOS initiates paint plan is a randomized reward from the Forbidden Knowledge thing that's got you collecting and depositing technical data. It's thee only paint plan I've found but I'm getting it all the time. Dropped two today. 
---
Ty very much 
---
Very mixed reviews here, I can‚Äôt get away from other players, I enter a bunker, BAM, another player there to greet me at the door. They‚Äôre almost always there because they‚Äôre doing the same quest, and we help each other out. 
---
Can confirm bug is visual for player only, don‚Äôt get excited.
---
I disagree, you get more fast travel points if you build your camps on opposite sides of the map.
---
(Seriously, you‚Äôre right, you should be able to do this, but the convenience of not doing it outweighs it for me).
---
Get nothing notable or even a chance of anything notable from killing them so I avoid em. 
---
I thought I was the only one 
---
why not introduce cazadors for that merry moments?
---
Would be smarter to do them all in a row so you could walk through all three without ever leaving nuke zone. 
---
Those atoms from the achievements matter ü§ë
---
Is QA even a thing? 
---
I love Wallace for his *soothing voice*.
---
What about the players that go through all that trouble and nuke their friends base even though they're standing right beside you in the launch room when you pick your target? Lol.
---
PC. We don't need no stinkin' achievements. Is there a challenge for killing mythicals ? 
---
Fucking heal!
---
Only thing I haven't killed, haven't even seen it
---
Can confirm, I am a herbivore cannibal.  Still get food and healing from those corpses.
---
Oh, that's the Event in Camp Venture right? Is it a Daily Quest that has me running around God-knows-where or is it a "normal" Event?
---
u cant create it. only drop or buy. ive got a couple if u want
---
i know the infinite crit glitch. if he's getting 100% hit rates with crits, then that's also a glitch. i can tell you from experience that crits do not legitimately have 100% hit rate. yes if you spec into being a vats build and have high perception you basically never miss, but it's never 100% 
---
I'm pretty sure you can get it as a quest reward for workshop defense so I'm not sure I'd spend the caps
---
No u found them from farming legndery 
---
No. Those are legendary effects. 
---
Same for crossbows
---
But adrenal reaction and emergency protocols!!
---
Yes, it's how I farm steel and wood.
---
Bethesda, don't do that or you will ruin the idea of you limited items
---
I'm using a level 2 Sunkissed and a Healing factor mutation, I don't care about rads anymore) And stimpacks are only for in-combat healing. 
---
THAT WAS YOUR FIRST MISTAKE YOU PAID 60 FOR IT WHEN JUST A WEEK OR SO LATER U COULD OF HAD IT FOR 40 OR LESS. 
---
Dont worry like all Bethesda games the modding community will fix it and make it great..... Oh wait its an online only title....disregard this statement.
---
I mean, walking through stuff isn't exactly new. They linked the collision to textures...for some reason. That's how some guy got into a new vault. He replaced the door texture w/ a bottle cap. 
---
hmm interesting. i knew about to grenade launcher being considered a shotgun. wonder what else can "double dip". obviously that currently makes pipe weapons the best in the game
---
Only timed item I sorta regret not grabbing.  Looks MUCH better in-game as an accent piece than what I'd anticipated.  Oh well, live and learn!
---
Are you comparing Fo76 to working a shitty retail job? Because you're right.
---
Improvise, adapt, overcome! Bear would be rolling over in his $2,000 sleeping bag
---
Unleash vault 108 on them.  Poetic justice. 
---
okay maybe I'll come across one, one day
---
If you build it. They will come. 
---
‚ÄúI have a program to remove textures to walk through whatever you want‚Äù, why are you even playing 
---
That's the plan. The two we did, while looking close together in the picture where just ever so slightly overlapping, next time we'll do all three in a line, but the problem is the area around Whitespring is pretty sparse. 
---
We also considered dropping a Nuke on Fissure Prime, then once the Scorched Earth event started drop a second and see if it had any effect on the SBQ. Maybe another time. 
---
What? Even vanilla WoW does a better job. Ever played ESO? Apparently not. 
---
I needed them cuz I wanted them. You're missing the point of Fallout 76
---
Its not about the levels .. more about the weapons
---
Disagree. My gf had a camp by a brahmin spawn and l got mad meat from that. Didnt even know it was a plan..
---
GARY
---
This sub.  Did my first successful SBQ run tonight...and then another one 30 mins later.  Two in one night simply by posting "Join me in x mins for SBQ _______&lt;(Platform) GamerTag is _____"
---
Thank you!
---
Do it! Make an official subredit for gear that came from illicit means that sells for cheaper than the actual "market". No one gives a shit how it was obtained as long as it works and is a fair price. Kinda how the bazaar was supposed to be and probably how the game community would be if we could actually raid each other for loot.
---
no im pretty sure it just gives you just more plastic, wood, etc.
---
I think every bear in the game is at the fairgrounds, somewhere. For example the panda is on a folding chair in the middle of a large group of chairs. Others are in or near the rides.
---
Thanks for the help
---
They avoided having to make up an entire state of civilization never heard of, while adding a believable story to why we haven‚Äôt heard of them. 
---
Plus, NPCs are usually very dull in online games, I think it‚Äôs better this way. 
---
Can you post your build?
---
Lol you can‚Äôt even read and are clearly the one raging ü§£ 
---
I‚Äôm enjoying your mental gymnastics though...it‚Äôs hilarious watching you struggle to find new angles. 
---
I just played the beta and have a level 100+ that is constantly defending the munitions plant though. I‚Äôm sure you and your 22 levels knows more than me about the game mechanics. 
---
Can you regale us with a tale about killing radroaches with VATS next? I can‚Äôt wait to read more of your fantastic stories. 
---
That was sweet ! Happy new year btw.
---
Cool, how many people did you have with you? 
---
How many times can you send a nuke?  Is there a limit or a cool down?
---
I have not launched one yet, have the quest. I have acquired 3 nuke cards. Could I do 3 in one night?
---
You on PS4? You sound like someone I'd stack a bounty with
---
**OH MY FUCKING GOD I HATE THAT MILITARY GRADE CIRCUIT BOARD ON A SPIRITUAL LEVEL**
---
They are definitely OP but I do love mine.
---
Always visit at least two venders. The responders vender in Flatwoods and a train station vender. Each will have a pool of 200 caps. Pick up anything and everything  in the surrounding area (I call it Grinching) and get those 200 caps every time you see em. I would be rich if I'd have started saving early. 
---
Hey man, did you fix it? I just realized mr fluffy has a voice but i could never hear it or any robot 
---
After lots of trying I carry hazmat with me, but use it only in one part in silo. **Killing SBQ outside of nuke zone**. I even spend 4k caps on legendary trapper armor, but you get over 7rads per sec without PA/hazmat even with milion radrezist. With that trapper i was able to run silo with 2radaways without fkin ugly hazmat. 
---
Cannot live without my agility and ap regen from armor. Run Forest run!
---
Darn. Well thank you!
---
No.  Don't let that deter you though - end game you'll find steel and plastic are almost always in short supply.  I appreciate this perk much more than I did while leveling.
---
I just read that, will give it a try tomorrow.
---
Gwent?
---
Like in the Sim Settlements mod for Fallout 4!
---
Seriously though, Bethesda, you should hire the Sim Settlements guy when you want to make collaborative CAMPs. Please please please please please.
---
OK. Should be a bit easier now. 
---
Wait was it really a hoax?  Shit.  I heard about it and have been avoiding in game trades like the plague.  Not that I would have traded anyway but this just solidified things.  Is it really safe to trade?  People can't steal my stuff for free?
---
Building a base anywhere u want and griefing players are two different subjects. Blowing up someone's base because you don't like where it's located can be defined as griefing.
---
For higher levels too
---
I just get a literal heaping pile of junk and sell it to a vendor or do some events
---
I‚Äôd be happy if I could sell ammo to the bots at train stations. 
---
See all the stuff on the ground? Sell it all. Sell anything that isn't nailed down. Between Responders vender and a train station vender you will have 400 caps as they have separate cap pools. 
---
I have no idea what that even is and would like to be enlightened
---
The nerd in me is wondering if you get any better stuff in the places where they overlap (like a Venn diagram)?
---
I'm sorry not at home so off the top of my head, no, but if memory serves there are almost all of them there.
---
Events for me.
---
Not to shit on your parade because I support it, but the perk you talk of affects Workshop items only. With or without the perk you deal the same damage to CAMPs. Figured I'd let u know so u can use the perk points elsewhere
---
No one has this feature
---
1) PS4
---
2) LONEWULF81
---
4) Trophy did not unlock for Code Cruncher (Hack 50 Terminals). I am already at 51.
---
Yea it was in 4 as well
---
I played Fallout for about a week, and played Red Dead until I beat the story. That's good you have that in your country. Here in the states, and about everywhere else, barely anyone likes or will remember Fallout 76 as it currently stands. For good reason too. It didn't get close to the ratings, reviews, or meta score, or even sell close to Red Dead.
---
Either way. These are two completely different games, and comparing 76 next to it's previous installments, 76 is in a distant last place.
---
That's the way the cookie crumbles.
---
Exactly this.  If I see one with turrets pointed, I level the base.  Racked up a 300 bounty today.  Someone set one up in the Nuke zone after I launched.  I hate selfish players and I try to let low levels tag before finishing the ghouls off.
---
Classical is pretty meh though, Raider is ok, if you don't mind a bit of elevator music and the same repetitive sayings after a while.
---
My opinion is less that we should remove songs and more that there should be different stations and much more diversity in the playlists, as much as I love country roads, it get's kinda grating after the 76th time I've heard it.
---
I've legit crafted like 50 weapons before. Trying to learn all the melee mods for I think lead pipe (still don't think I have them all).
---
I...really think you're fucking high, because I'm not seeing a hit piece here at all. "there was an  issue, in a long line of issues". This is a fact. This launch is fucking \_riddled\_ with bugs, even more so than other bethesda titles. Stating a fact isn't a "hit job".   
---
It's also worth noting in response to your "nukes spawn co op PVE events." statement...yeah, in theory. it's a rare day I don't see at least one person flagged wanted in a nuke zone, and I read about griefers in nuke zones all the time...there's a seriously toxic chunk of the player base.   
---
I went back after building my base up there, and the jingles the spacemonkey was there looking at the panda bear!
---
I actually didn't even have to use mine.   I was halfway through the solo when someone beat me to nuking prime.
---
Then on the second run some other friends told me they were working on Silo in their server so I joined them there for another run.   5 people actually friended and joined me,  3 on my team.   Who knows how many just searched the GT and joined without any contact.   Both servers were full shortly after my heads up posts.  You probably could do 3 in one night.   I'd recommend changing servers between each drop so you don't max lag and DC from all the activity.  In order to make it worth it though you need about 2 hours for each time, unless you're going solely for SBQ.  There's a lot of legendary enemies and good flora to farm too.
---
I only just recently started using reddit again, considering the name of the place I'm still genuinely surprised at the amount of accounts on here that seemingly can't read.
---
Yeah, I have a crappy base in the woods that consists of crops, a fence and turrets and 2 guys were shooting up my turrets for fun so just logged off and back on but pretty lame.
---
I just sent u a party invite 
---
Pretty cool find! I'm new to the game. Is there the crashed alien ship in this game?
---
Fun fact...the only coverage i've seen on rdr2 has been about how horrible it is. The only place I go where the coverage implies it's good is the comments section here. 
---
Yes but it may be awhile
---
This needs more upvotes.
---
Tfw you find yourself "How tf do I not have any wood?"
---
Advice: If you find a Dusky Yao Guai, do not approach it or assume you can beat it because it's low level because ITS LITERALLY ONE OF THE MOST POWERFUL ENEMIES IN THE GAME.
---
No but there's an alien blaster in the water near the butterfly in the map ;)
---
I would be up for doing a Tier 2. I'm at dtb7591 on PSN please add me and we can go when the silos are working
---
Very good to know, what happens if you die?
---
2000 hours wanna see my account lol esos stories were shit in the base game dlc is what made it good. And the more in fallouts base game is way better then esos.
---
I'd be trying Whitesprings then south west from there to include Solomon's Pond and Blackwater mine. 
---
Yeah, I don't use my explosive shotty until I'm sure everybody tagged. I know explosive guns can be bad etiquette too but I'm careful with it, don't shoot unless they're close to death. I've shown five people the golf club so far and they all thanked me for the help
---
Lmao 
---
you uh, respawn?
---
Not sure if sarcasm...but damn funny either way.
---
But do you lose caps or anything
---
A lot came through when they hit ctrl + C ctrl + V on fallout 4. Hell we‚Äôve got dog armour in a game without dogs or companions of any kind (oops)
---
It legit puts the leg in my inventory every time I step into my power armor lol it‚Äôs annoying as hell
---
That snowflake looks sketchy af. Just ignore his anus. 
---
That must suck ass
---
If you mean non-PA, I started collecting them today but it's not easy. Stuff like heavy robot is rare, and I'm missing a few top-tier materials on some body parts.
---
The DLC was infinitely better, for sure. The vanilla stories are at worst on par with 76 (go here, kill this) except you had characters, but there were at least decent questlines. Whats the best one in 76? Mistress? Its memorable because my guy had a dress on.
---
Just the truth my friend :) 
---
Grounded is a fantastic end game mutation.  Turns out the Scorchbeasts' spam echo attacks are coded as energy attacks.   Stand there and take it,  then lose the mutation and see how much shorter you can stand it. 
---
Cap sink + make you choose to run instead of fast travel every now and than and explore.
---
Fast travel makes food with a CND bar go down faster so it kinda costs food.
---
I like the standard paint job on it a lot, plus it has the best stats.
---
you drop all the junk you have in a paper bag when you die but you can just go back and recollect it. You only lose Caps if you become wanted and another player kills you
---
No 
---
I fucking wish
---
That's my purse! I don't know you!
---
Mark the dupers wanted and give players the chance to kill them for a reward. 
---
Can I have one
---
what console u on
---
I‚Äôm on Pc
---
I got two of them nearly back to back.  Extremely lucky.  But of course now it has been days since I've seen another one.  
---
No. The achievements are not fully functioning. I also did not get it when I was at ground zero.
---
Once you obtain the plans, the Halloween Outfits can be very effective for cap runs when you don't have other items you want to sell.  If I am in a hurry two Skeleton (250) and one Witch (200) will be enough for most of the caps at a single vendor with a 3 charisma and 3 star hard bargain. All it costs to make is a bit of cloth and bit less plastic. With a 0.1 weight, they are easy to build up front and hop to sell to all faction vendors quickly. 
---
They're honestly so cool. The first time I ran into one in Far Harbor was awesome. I was glad they made a return. 
---
I mean.... The servers crashed just as much before duping.
---
Hero, fuck this flappy sky bastard. 
---
See it
---
&gt; Cap sink 
---
Not enough to matter though. 
---
&gt;Fast travel makes food with a CND bar go down faster so it kinda costs food.
---
Oh does it now...that'd be nice of the game to tell you. Or hint to. 
---
It doesn't make sense to do that *and* caps though. It'd make sense for it to take hunger and thirst. 
---
Fuck if I know or care. 
---
You ever find the plans bro?
---
Be sure to check us out when we solve the codes on livestream every week!

we want men, not machines
---
Huh, I always thought he said plane ticket but claim ticket makes more sense. 
---
oof im on ps4 sorry 
---
I literally just hit the "I am become death" mission and immediately thought to myself "how the hell am I gonna find eight lv50+ players to fight with?" - I'm down for a nuke party this weekend if y'all want to PM me your discord channel.
---
Not sure if theres a certain level they start appearing, but I feel like I see them somewhat regularly now (lv 140). I sever hopped a few times tonight, they showed up two different occasions out of 5 or so times I checked at harpers ferry
---
I'm on PS4 though 
---
I did this from the very start apart from the occasional group session on a separate character and now I have nothing to do but grind for legendaries and plans.  
---
There's no point in me starting another character, I have read and listened to everything and none of the other content ever changes. There's 0 choices or decisions to be made, just follow the marker, go here grab this and listen to this on the way. I actually play fallout 4 more than I play this already.  
---
I enjoyed what it was when it was new but now there's nothing new. But so many bugs since beta still persist. Just my 2 cents. I do hope they get on it super quick this year.
---
If we could bulk ammo I could see this happening, as ammo cant sell for less than 1 per unit, as nothing can
---
Weird to set expectations without any knowledge of the feild or a true understanding of the games inner workings. They are trying but they just havent found a way yet. 
---
This subreddit is so weird man.
---
You people need to have higher standards and stop making excuses for a billion dollar company.
---
I'm all about that corn soup!
---
Currency duping has happened in WoW and SWG. Armbrace duping happened in GW1. Duping exploits have been in online games since online games were a thing.
---
Its the environmental story telling mixed with hints and ques that you can tell was very well thought up. A picture paints a 1000 words and a picture with puzzles within it are amazing. The holotapes are really interesting for the most part and some of the quests we're memorable. But yeah the dlc in eso was good.. for the most part I didn't like summerset story but I hate high elves. But the base games main story was meh and the side quests we're pretty bad 
---
K bye
---
Everyone must see this post, this just made my day.
---
The one from the plans drops no meat so no point in killing  those
---
Can the devs just patch crafting so that only like 15-20 of a weapon or armor can be crafted per 24 hour period? Who the fuck needs to craft 15-20 of the same weapon or armor in such a short time anyway? And if the dupers figure out how to spam craft another item to do the glitch, just put in a crafting limit that's reasonable per item, but under the needed amount to dupe with. Unless that's like the developer equivalent of neurosurgery
---
Ummm, yeah. Thanks for the wishes though.
---
This is the first post, article, video, or image discussing Zetans or Zetan corpses in Fallout 76 so I think it's safe to say you are the first person to find a Zetan corpse in the game!
---
Oh noooo..... They didn't patch it. How will I ever enjoy playing the game now??? People duping stops me from..... Ummmmm.. Ughhh..... It just ruins the game for me that other people are doing that! 
---
Threat could be Blackbird paint with Red Headlamp.   I have it on my X-01.  Its pretty ominous looking. 
---
Put that ranged mod on and youre out of self damage range! You still have to be careful though. My friend has a tse shotty and frequently KOs himself. Always makes for a good laugh over comms
---
It's alright. These things happen.
---
It happens a lot more in 76 too considering some enemies literally spawn right in front of you. I've had my share of ferals, scorched, and deathclaws appearing right in front of me. 
---
There will eventually be single player servers that you can mod 
---
You know that right
---
you can send nuke from each silo with 3hours cooldown. 3 nukes 8daily thats 168 per week, if you are mad. Also if you have friend, he can send 3nukes when you are on cooldown, so that is 336nukes per week. So two people can shoot 8760 nukes per year, if they are completly mentaly broken.
---
Thank you! I‚Äôm assuming you only get a bounty for killing other players?
---
In rare occasions tamable like mirelurks, deathclaws etc.
---
Yeah, not power armor, that's easy.
---
DUDE! SAME! I fast traveled some time ago (I don't remember where) and I saw something out of the corner of my first person shooter eye. It was LITERALLY right beside me when I spawned. I peed myself a bit. 
---
http://lmgtfy.com/?q=fo76+forbidden+knowledge
---
I joined in the fight, and also the one at The Whitespring afterward.  I saw you light up those bots near the bunker entrance :-)
---
I couldn't find it until I leveled an alt to 15 and took it to Watoga Train Station. I was able to get it to show up for me pretty regularly after that. I think there's something going on with the levels.
---
This is a bad idea, I would craft 50 of something inside other peoples bases just to get their camp destroyed.
---
What's this about scraping wire first?
---
Sometimes it takes a few minutes to load in. If it doesn't after a few minutes close the application and open it again.
---
‚ÄûHe downvoted the title because of click bait name, you won‚Äôt believe what happened next!‚Äú
---
Good to know. I still hunt em tho. 
---
Sometimes it takes a minute to show up.
---
I hate em, that was the first now they are following me, they always show up in weird isolated spots...I have screamed a few more times this week..
---
Did you get hit by the bomb? Like were you in the blast zone before the bomb dropped?
---
Funny story the 3rd creature I encountered in fallout 76 was a fabled flatwoods monster
---
Do you have ANY proof? I've seen you respond with wishful thinking 3 times but offer no proof at all. There is proof to the contrary. If you have some please share it. 
---
I think this is just one of those animatronicc aliens from Fallout 4 's Nuka World DLC that also act like turrets that shoot you. 
---
You can get bounties one of 3 ways, Damaging other Players, Damaging their Bases, and killing their pets. Nothing else, so don't shoot someone who doesn't have a yellow nametag and don't shoot any player made building.
---
Shit got me yesterday.  It appeared in a flash and I screamed, vatsed and peed a little
---
That.
---
Is.
---
Adorable.
---
Events, even the easy ones they always give caps and things you can sell.
---
Whitesprings, am I right?  I was there yesterday at level 22 and got swarmed by level 40s ghouls and some green monster thing that was level 60s and had to book it for the robots and still got killed.
---
Thank you, can‚Äôt imagine who‚Äôd shoot someone‚Äôs pet, also super looking forward to getting a pet
---
It does from what I hear.
---
I bet if you submit a ticket they'll respond immediately.
---
Lol. I enjoy the game but give them a few jabs now and then.
---
Get ahold of a hazmat suit and head into Whitesprings when it's nuked. Pick whatever plants you can find. 
---
I can't remember what perk it is but something under Charisma helps with vendor prices. Max that out and you'll get like 12 caps per flux. Get Green Thumb under Perception and you get 2 flux per bush. You'll pick up plenty in no time, and 16 flux will net you 192 caps, which is most of a vendor's cap pool right there. I have a couple other perks that reduce consumable weight and slow decay, so I can spend days just selling flux.
---
At that level I honestly server hopped Grafton dam and steel mill and picked up everything and sold it.
---
Micro sledge.
---
No, it is the game, I crash 3 times a day, but I am also using an Ultrawide monitor, and 21:9 support is bad because when it crashes you can't alt + f4, alt+tab or go into task manager resulting in power button quick shutdown.
---
Haha I love that the moment we all see a group of friendly robots we high tail it in the middle of them so they can tank and kill the enemies. 
---
But yea, it‚Äôs Whitesprings. 
---
Yeah this happened to me earlier on xbox, it was so infuriating. It had some ammo on it for a second and then when i went to check again, there was nothing in the loot menu. 500 shotgun shells down the drain
---
I prefer an Atoms war
---
Nope didnt get that memo
---
Thanks dudes.. will be mass selling junk now. On a side note; is it more profitable to scrap the junk first or sell as is?
---
Thank you for this! I launched my first nuke ever today (as Sebass2020 on PS4) üòÅ
---
üòî thanks.
---
Relieved to know I'm not the only one. And the struggle I went through. I'm a level 17 and was running away from a level 56 ghoul. Haha
---
Whaaat 
---
Haha ty for the reply. I found it later but stopped playing
---
gonna take awhile, you can get a Brahmin in your Camp or aquire a Perk that allows you to tame low level creatures and put them in your Camp. You won't have a pet following you around and helping you in combat sadly.
---
Just got one of these myself. Curious of the response.
---
I honestly heard about them but never saw one. I just started shooting at it until it fluttered and died.
---
Id be happy if I didnt CTD 50-70% of the time im doing queen.
---
Cause I load in right in front of it and facing it, and never went in any other way.  
---
This sounds much better though...
---
Like just dont respond to things that you have no understanding of, its that simple.
---
yeah i just went there and found most of them so ima just get rid of the location part and i found the rad bear near the building with all the pumkins
---
anyway ima get off for today ill update the post tommorow
---
ya i used about all of the durability on my sniper on it
---
I was in the blast radius. I got a message that I got killed by so-and-so's bomb.
---
Fair, probably should have just titled it "Mothman took my manliness, and I hate em for it"
---
Every SINGLE TIME!!!!!!! In a few months I want bethesda to make it able to be picked up just for a few hours just to fuck with people
---
Fun read
---
I get the "end" feeling, but I honestly believe the future content for the game (if done well) will start showing just how much an impact on the future our actions have from this game. It would be amazing to see small easter eggs that set up major events in the future from previous games, which I'd be willing to bet money we will. 
---
I downvoted because I think your list is confused and misguided. It seems you have confused QOL with player buffs and game suggestions in numerous cases.  Quality of life means improving the interface. I don't want to get into how a buff "improves one's quality of life, too" as that is not what is meant by QOL. A buff is buff and QOL improvement is a QOL improvement. They need to be distinct in a list like 
---
QOL examples
---
- fixing the power armor compass
---
- perk loadouts/presets. 
---
- show which plans aren't learnt from vendors
---
- fixing reload animation for lever action rifle
---
- more pipboy categories
---
- accessibility for blind players
---
Examples of buffs
---
- make scrapped junk zero weight
---
- tone down hunger/thirst levels
---
- cannibal perk should provide thirst
---
- scapper needs to be better
---
- scrapping legendaries
---
- benefit from hazmat suit while wearing armor over it
---
- make screws more plentiful
---
- make plans account based. (why? I want to be able to start a totally fresh game)
---
Examples of game suggestions which alter the game's narrative
---
- add dog companions
---
- add more radio stations
---
- add voice actors
---
etc etc
---
Many of the buffs are subjective and debateable. I do not want plans to be account wide. Thus, if it is debateable it should not be on this list. I have no desire to have hunger and thirst decreased. And since we disagree it is a matter of debate and therefore does not belong. 
---
Adding new music, voice acting and lore also do not belong. They are suggestions for player's enjoyment related to the story telling aspect of the game. They are not interface tweaks. 
---
Fixing the power armor compass is not an issue for debate. I doubt there is a single person who would disagree. Therefore it belongs on the list. Major changes to the game do not. Hopefully OP you will trim this list down and move the buffs/game suggestions to an ulterior list or separate them on the list from the purely QOL requests 
---
I just realized it's easier to get the cap collector perk than spending perks on weight reduction so I can collect more junk to sell.
---
Lol but are you okay?? 
---
You have to be at the center , as in get nuked not just Stoll in
---
Kill queen outside of nuke zone. Fu\*\* whitespring.
---
I killed it, but I have not gone back to that area again.
---
Can you show me on the dolly where the mothman touched your l√§mp?
---
I have killed the SBQ 6 or 7 times already, I just haven‚Äôt sent the nuke on my own yet. I‚Äôm level 82. 
---
Was just curious if there was a limit on the amount of nukes you personally could send. 
---
Modern paintings, I got it myself from defending a workshop.
---
Same with the various gym weights at the top of the monorail elevator.  Concrete sacks?  You can grab 'em.  The lead weights next to them? Noooope.
---
This is why I prefer farming building with super mutants and a table. Scraping every weapon solves the steel and plastic problem. The caps and gunpowder are just icing.
---
How do you get a sentry for your camp???
---
Hmmm. Is Beta the new normal?
---
My game is unplayable, so I am acting how my game is.  Spend a fucking hour wasting mats and ammo, get booted, progress resets, but I've lost my mats and ammo.  Not everybody is having your perfect gaming experience.  
---
Oh nice thanks for joining in on the fun!
---
I feel like saying the knob is too risqu√© for the sub so let's say lamp shade.
---
Lmao although you provided me nothing of use, the randomness of this comment was hilarious. 
---
Hey is that the barn building set you're using? I bought and learned it but the building pieces (walls, etc.) are still locked for me. Just trying to find out if it was the correct plan that I assumed would let me build pieces like in your pictures. 
---
Those damn weights burned me so Bad. 
---
I downvoted because I think your list is confused and misguided. It seems you have confused QOL with player buffs and game suggestions in numerous cases.

Live a little. Try some vodka in a plastic bottle. If you drop it, you still have your vodka and it might do a little bounce. 
---
Make a level 15 alt with 15 charisma and park him in watoga. Cheapest way to get plans.
---
Yeah, oxhorn is the only 76 streamer.
---
Nope.
---
I don't know. But there is one item that's listed under "Quest item" that's useful. There's a daily quest with a police protection named Boomer in the Mire. He sends you to go collect inert bombs. Once you collect them the quest is finished. But you can keep the inert bombs. In the workbench you can turn them into mines. Pretty good ones too. 
---
I would like a way to build certain things.
---
Sounds like a party. 
---
imeanwhat
---
Another person found the same alien right before the sever maintenance today. Looking forward to that Zeta DLC too
---
In every game where I've seen the "guts," items do indeed have unique IDs. For example, a 2* TSE lever action is gun2 (for example). Everyone who happens to loot this gun, or dupes it, will have gun2 in their inventory. It wouldn't make sense to have an identical item looted by you, and later by me, have completely different identifiers and/or designations in code.
---
it's pretty awful :(
---
If you're in a team and you crash youll have the option to join team after you reload
---
This also saves your spot in the world so none of that "world is full take a number and wait in line" shiy
---
They did patch it. But a new one popped up. It's like wack-a-mole. You squash one method another pops up. 
---
yes, but just one way of doing, new methods are already in practice, laging your servers
---
Anybody wanna run alpha silo with me? hoping for a 3-4 man team (i wanna complete i am become death lmao, i donr have a keycard sadly.) xbox is JoeyAKangaroo
---
I get the feeling that some of the Youtubers and puplicists are payed by some1 to set fallout in a bad light, just to push their own sales...
---
I‚Äôll still treat that Brahmin with love
---
No. Same glitch with minor change works on all platforms. Is a bit crazy Bethesda is having this much trouble fixing it. The good news is identifying the people who use it is still trivial so we can hope for a ban wave. 
---
Just let every pleb craft legendary effects
---
Job done
---
Being "wanted" isn't much of a punishment. 
---
Happy New Years Lieutenant Dan!
---
Maybe add in a system like the one from New Vegas? Maybe not with all the casings and primers, but just the lead and powder.
---
Bahahaha 
---
I'm curious how long it took WoW to fix it.
---
Hey. Just thought I'd ask, but are you guys aware of the big QOL thread going on right now?
---
Is the station right up against a wall?
---
I launched a nuke yesterday o.O
---
do you know if it's a certain one or random?
---
You can hit 200 caps with just the junk around each vendor. Drop the ammo you don‚Äôt need. This fascination with scraping everything in a game that bleeds junk is crazy. 
---
Yeah, laging the server to dupe a item won't affect me at all.
---
The few times I have my teammate also CTD. I checked recent players list and its empty, and this is the only time i have had an empty recent list. If you search this reddit a lot of people have this issue, and to me it really makes it hard to get excited, spend a lot of time launching a nuke or hopping and CTD due to game issue. Its the reason I dont bother launching my own nukes.. not worth time compared to likelyhood of a crash.
---
Yes - I shared the last one with the team today
---
Sorry to break it to ya bud, but I think it's a random encounter like the defusable nukes.
---
My buddy ran across something similar, but it was in a way different location. He called me over for a photo op, and it went something like this:
---
Friend: "Duuude! Come check out this wacky shit! Worth a photo, yeah?"
---
Me, as I'm walking towards said box: "Whoah, that box is clipped through a safe I wonder if I can open i-"
---
Friend: "DUDENOWAI-"
---
Explosions. 
---
This. I‚Äôve noticed that building along the road just north of the Overseer‚Äôs camp is getting to be popular. I‚Äôm on the west side of the road, between it and the river, and a camp placed on the other side of the road or about 40 yards north of me is enough to store my camp. 
---
Mines doing the same thing, except with my left arm
---
Well then thats the problem right there. The game is broken.
---
Make thier ammo require gun powder?
---
Nah, my operation is still going strong - spreading it out to 9 different accounts. The game will get better and there is no reason not to get the upper hand on the future economy. 
---
Cracker

Well, deathclaws are usually kill on sight for most people. But others understand that the giant lizards only want some affection and a good place to stay. 
---
The most egregious example of something that doesn't belong is **endgame shouldn't force you into PA**. This is so patently not true. I have never used power armor and I have completed the end game just fine in a hazmat suit.  I took many defensive perks. PA is the tradeoff you make when you want to spec into damage and not defense. Or if you are not employing efficient strategy to stay alive without PA. So not only are you wholly misguided about end game PA requirements, it again is not a QOL item
---
However, fixing the power armor compass is not an issue for debate. I doubt there is a single person who would disagree. Therefore it belongs on the list. Major changes to the game do not. Hopefully OP you will trim this list down and move the buffs/game suggestions to an ulterior list or separate them on the list from the purely QOL requests. Please consider. Thank you.
---
Seriously want to remove beach boys??
---
I tried RDO today while the 76 servers where down. Did the intro missions and got to free roam. Went to Saint Denis to check out the online shops and what not, got killed by high levels atleast 5 times before I could get to the tailors. Then I tried to make it to a barber got lassoed and drug through town. Went and watched youtube videos on what perks I should take in 76.
---
uhh I have some PTSD from deathclaws in Fallout 4 so i hope I don‚Äôt meet one soon
---
Just picking up the junk around each vendor works. If you hate junk farming then may I suggest water farming?
---
Take workshops. Throw down a fusion reactor and 12 water purifiers. Repeat. Fast travel between them and collect water. 
---
Sorry pal, but I don't care if you're level 572, you've been wrong about the pvp mechanics every time you open your mouth. 
---
My story has been consistent the entire time. I've changed nothing since the original post above.
---
 You're grasping at straws, trying to make me seem like this horrible villain manipulating exploits to kill poor innocents who can't defend themselves.
---
No as it happens in multiple areas and it worked perfectly when I was so close I couldn't see the armour then moved the station for it to glitch again
---
In a way with a duplication glitch, but that is kinda frowned upon
---
Scrap wont sell unless its bulked first. Some doesnt sell at all.
---
Keep things unscrapped for vendors if you wanna do it quickly. In the long run though I get more money selling bulks. 
---
There was "hotfix". It is all ok now.
---
Snap the sloped roof to a foundation(might have to do a half wall) . Then put a wall on the next foundation and put a sloped roof on that. 
---
I just shuddered at the thought of Cazadors being introduced in this game for any reason. 
---
I think I wasted about 3000 caps buying stoves, doors, walls, ect because did not remember which ones I bought.
---
Found one south of Whitesprings on the road on the mountain side, maybe you'll have luck there.
---
Not sure if it would be possible, but maybe have a way to track who is causing server ping to crash and kick them before the full server crashes. Probably be hard with people who have optimal at best internet.
---
Much faster method than those I see here are to go southwest a bit to the farm, harvest all of the corn in the first field and razorgrain a field over. You can sell them for a cap a piece to vendors, usually 400 per run if I have... whatever the perk is for double plants.
---
Havent had any issues whatsoever trading here.
---
You should be safe, friend.
---
If you have a question about something, please put the question **in the title**. Reddit does not make it possible to edit titles, so you will have to post again with a LONGER, MORE DESCRIPTIVE TITLE. Once again, MAKE A TITLE WHICH IS LONGER AND MORE DESCRIPTIVE.
---
Fix energy weapons. Durability is terrible, and the damage is mediocre. 
---
It means aiming down sights... 
---
Mules until they upgrade their hardware/software enough to increase. It reminds me of diablo 2 days... fond memories back then, painful now due to how tedious it is to mule without using paperbags, which i dont want to risk due to DC's.
---
Not exactly sure. I think it resulted in ban waves. Some games don't even let certain regions play their game because the gold farming was so bad in the early 2000s.
---
Pick up all chems you find, even with rank 1 Hard Bargain you'll amass quite a fortune in caps very quickly.
---
Yeah I thought about that, didn't want players forcing themselves out of pacifism mode when it's convenient 
---
I've never heard the jukebox play anything in Fallout 4 or 76! It loads a tape and then silence. I wonder what I'm doing wrong?
---
Maybe you should join the responders 
---
0/10 troll
---
You're mad cause you can buy cosmetics? I've had more problems with bugs in Red Dead Online than 76. I was told there would be bugs, I was told it was an open world Fallout game that was strictly multiplayer and survival elements and that is exactly what I got. Why the hell are you still here bitching about the game? You don't like it? Don't play it you moron. Stop chugging the damn glue and get a new hobby
---
No evidence it "lags the server" it disconnects the person doing it because it is most likely an issue client side which is why is doesnt disconnect everyone. Ive been on plenty of servers where I saw people duping and my game saw no change in performance, I'm pretty sure thats a myth and everyone who says it is just jumping on the bandwagon because they heard someone else say it.
---
Literally unplayable. I bet you've accidentally deleted so many fallout saves, all those hundreds of hours gone in an instant. Yet here you are complaining about server issues, on a post about a hot fix that is meant to improve the game.
---
so..i heard people say there is a pleasant valley claim ticket in game file. But i never see anyone mention finding it. Maybe future dlc??
---
Is bird bones worth the hit in strength. I only have one point in the perk that makes the negatives less harsh 
---
Posting comment to find out as well.
---
I'm honestly really upset that killing this Flatwoods monster wasnt the way you get the alien blaster gun. 
---
I absolutely loved the alien part of fo4. The way it was handled in 4 was really inaignifigant in comparison but this game had the potential to really tie things together and didnt. 
---
Can I delete saves on ps4.. on an online game... gtfo here fucking fanboy
---
Hang around by silo Alpha, they kept spawning on muh base. https://youtu.be/_wXLNwBy5LA
---
I think Bethesda had the concept where people would start with one, say the Raider one and replace pieces on that frame until they got all the desired pieces for the one they wanted.   
---
Do not think they seriously considered people wanted to keep 4-5 different sets. 
---
Excavator for the ores.  (Lead/Ultracite mining)
---
T51B for the Nuka-Cola skin.  Its fun for a change up!
---
X01 for Nuke Zones.
---
Ultracite for other areas.
---
I picked up 80% of the junk in flatwoods alone and managed to clear out the vendor‚Äôs capacity without any charisma perks. Nice 
---
lmao at the imgur tard asking in the comments
---
I have serious doubts they can tell who is doing what.
---
If they went on YouTube there's plenty of names shown. I just watched a video of a guy who removed walls and built under Whitesprings, they don't even hide their names. That's how little they think of it.
---
Well, just don‚Äôt go to Deathclaw Island or start the Enclave questline for a bit then. Or Rose‚Äôs quests. Those are all gonna be there no matter what. Besides those, I haven‚Äôt seen any deathclaws out in the wild besides Watoga. 
---
For me it's the mongrel dog under the map biting your ass, not knowing where it's coming from
---
Is the explosive weapon damage bug still going on with queen?
---
Wouldn't it be nice if there was more communication from Bethesda (as promised) or patches were focused on the bigger issues the community is mentioning? Even if its saying "hey we cant do X cause of Y yet, but are trying to find a solution" such as the 600 lbm increase and explaining why its only 600.. that was nice. Im more irritated now by a 2-3 week lack of feedback and response from Bethesda on some major key issues that have been around for awhile now, and then when patches do come out they add in things no one mentions or cares about, and ends up actually angering a lot of the player base. Communication is key in any relationship.. friends, lovers, and especially in business transactions.
---
This game sounds better and better
---
Well I have gotten Legendary drops from normal mobs too.   So it balances out, right?
---
Not at all - my stuff is on sale on ezokay, I can't link it here but you are welcome any time!
---
But you shouldn't be able to hit an ally... or is there a syringe gun that can shoot stimpaks? 
---
I'd think if they could track that, they could fix it.
---
Was talking about previous fallout games, ya doof. 
---
Keep believing and giving money , communication will surely improve :) 
---
Not until theh fix the hit detection.
---
I think that the servers have a bad case of communism.
---
There are plenty of solutions for it, but the devs won't do any of them. I don't expect they ever will. Be it laziness or genuine inability. Like they do not know how to actually implement them. Or they straight up don't care.
---
99 cores though?
---
1. It‚Äôs 2019, come on. 
---
;)
---
2. They‚Äôd probably just end up giving me 500 atoms instead. Not worth prison, ty tho
---
Adding to this there are a few specialty lights that DO have to be connected directly to your power grid.  
---
The LED cycling light and one of the light boxes, for example.  
---
If the electric lightning bolt has a number, it must be directly connected.  Otherwise, it just has to be near a power connector ever on the other side of a wall.
---
point being sensitive subject and you know it
---
In this case it might make it easier if the camp zones were square shaped rather than circles.  This way people could line them up.
---
I stock them for the eventual buff to gat lasers.
---
Well at least with 500 atoms you could buy nice tiles for your kitchen? 
---
You are my Redditor of the week.
---
Also, if you‚Äôre on PC, I‚Äôd be more than happy to get on and help you out a bit. Not do everything for you, but just like...make sure you‚Äôre not having to go through too much ammo and stimpaks and that stuff. 
---
I agree. My thought would be temporary as it's just a check for everyone's ping and if one just drops suddenly or something. I'm not sure how the dupe works just that it kicks servers down.
---
ohh so nothing official?
---
If it doesnt give any rewards like meat or leather, then the brahmin shouldn't be able to be killed by players. Other in game creatures, sure, but not people. I mean players are now going to seek out others with brahmin or other "pets" just to kill them to troll. What does the super bored high level care of they get a 5-10 cap bounty? 
---
Alternative solution: greatly increase the cap bounty based on the action that makes you wanted. Example, murdering another players pet is now a 500-1000 cap bounty and the creature gives no rewards. That eliminates pretty much all incentive to kill a "pet." Fusion generator detroyed? That's 1500 caps on your head. Everyone will want a piece of you. Now keep in mind I don't mean the high bounty is applied as soon as you attack. You have to actually destroy/kill the item/creature to get the full bounty. I'd even say go so far as to allow an initial hit that does no damage, but gives the player a warning that they will receive a bounty if they continue to attack. 
---
Yeah, dumb... the games broken.  I want to play, but it ain't worth my time.  
---
It's not a normal event. More like a random item that can be picked up from containers like safes and office desks. If you want to find one right away. Go to the enclave bunker by whitesprings and find that military wing with all the desks. People saying it only takes one tech data after the first initial turn in because it wont count it in your inventory if you pick up a second. So you could have a friend help to cut down on fast travel costs by staying at Venture or outside Whitesprings bunker, picking up one from those desks and turning it in then going back and finding another and so on...
---
I do this every few days.  Take over a few and defend for a few hours.  I have shitloads of plans.  And, yeah, after a while, you get dupes but sometimes you just NEED the small side tables... ;)
---
Did I miss the chance to get it?? I never saw it in the atom shop
---
WoW in 2004 had better quests than 76, and WoW has shit quests. Thats my entire point. It feels outdated and maybe you personally felt connected to the holotapes of dead people but I can't remember a single one. If 76 has such a deep plot, why not give me a synopsis? You probably can't because it's absolute garbage that goes nowhere.
---
I think that would go beyond the damage limit and produce that HP regen error again...
---
Sensitive subject to you, an opportunity for me.
---
Well just yesterday I had a 3 star drop an assassin's roller pin with 8% extra damage to players and 100% accuracy in VATS if not engaged in combat!
---
But I think you would always get the 100% anyway without the ability because the target player is going to stand there in shock watching someone trying to sneak up to them with a roller pin raised...
---
True that. Don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôd get to see them much however.
---
Identifying the dupers isn't trivial... They can't track who has duped at all. The most they could do is find out who has a large amount of the same item but even that doesnt prove anything as dupers sell stuff super cheap and on Christmas dupers were dropping 1000s of items to anyone they met for free.
---
And use the chem station.
---
Do you mean 2 boiled +1 wood = 1 pur?
---
Yeah its unfortunate that this is even an issue to begin with - but my hope is that the above could make the limitation more transparent/fair to the player before a longer term efficiency solution on the backend is developed.
---
The problem is the weight limitation actually creates additional gameplay problems that would not exist if they just went with a direct limit on number of relevant items that are apparently causing the problem.
---
Legendary enemies, especially in nuke zones where you can basically farm legendary items.
---
Does that make named items non-tradeable or does it mean when they get traded, the default names get reset back?
---
Please god
---
4 hours 
---
I‚Äôm on Xbox unfortunately, but thank you for the offer
---
Lmao that‚Äôs all i see. With all the damn water boiling I have to do on a daily basis. 
---
Well I'm hopeful and quite positive it will be in a much better state next time you play again. 
---
You can change servers.  However, if you died and haven't recovered your items they will be lost
---
Are dupers actually a thing? How can you even dupe in the game? I feel duped :(
---
Duping is not fixed though I doubt that is the cause of your troubles. 
---
Can we report players outside of the game?
---
More likely 76 was wanted people to nuke if you found the holo from the overseer about the nuke launch you know she's been following dwellers murdering them want proof you can find a dead vault dweller at every major stage of the questline (sons of dane, red rocket megastop roof and 2-3 by the raider camps. 
---
What level are you? I collected a lot of guns until I was around level 40, and realized I'd never really use a lot of them because of my build so I ended up getting rid of them. I thought having options would be nice, but it's so much easier to just stick to 2-4 weapons that are perk'd out.
---
Get rid of junk you probably won't use. For me that was stuff like bone shards and cork scrap.
---
I don't keep much more than one full set of armor and a set of power armor. Having more armor than you need is kinda pointless. Outfits can be fun but you don't need 20 different ones.
---
Ammo can build up pretty fast, and that comes with weight. Drop whatever you don't plan on using. Plasma cores took up a lot of my inventory weight. Also, grenades.
---
Chems too. I don't take anything other than water, stimpaks and radaway (and the occasional grape mentat to make selling and buying prices better). Chems sell for a relatively good amount, especially with the vendor prices perk in Charisma.
---
Not sure if you know this already, but there are 7 different vendor factions all with separate cap wells, and they reset every 20 hours IIRC. [Here's a map for them](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/220026434226225153/513631437962870784/Vendorsfixed.jpg). So if you have enough stuff to sell, you can make 1400 caps every day.
---
Do you leave the cap off your toothpaste? Know who does that?
---
Dupers. 
---
is whitesprings also normally laggy?
---
I doubt it, I get on about once a week now... maybe in a few months itll be better.  I really hope so.  My brothers and I love fallout, and always wanted to coop it.
---
What about a real crafting animation that takes about 10-20 seconds per crafted item (excluding ammo)? That would sum up to a big amount of time if you want to craft 300 items for duping.
---
This would also be realistic. And uf you are just crafting to getting mods, everybody should be fine with some time to craft.
---
Thanks for the reply so quickly guess I need to go to more nuke zones
---
I‚Äôve tried beating it many times, to no avail :(
---
I'm with you. There was one right outside the golf club with its turrets level with the windows, killing my ghouls. I finally got fed up, went outside, and leveled the whole thing. Turrets, walls, decor, crafting, power, everything. 440 cap bounty, which I had a friend claim.
---
Flatwoods monster. 
---
Equally terrifying.
---
Duping 
---
Just collect like 5 of each alcohol type and chug them all at once 
---
Same thing here 
---
I was in there since the countdown was down to 1:45secs
---
GET CHEM!
---
WHAT SORT OF CHEM!?
---
Wait is he like legit a thing? Where can I find this half man, half mutant half bearpig
---
This is the way to play fallout. I did that on my first character. 
---
Maybe it could be balanced out by including brass, which could be scrapped en masse from ammo and other junk items? I'd imagine higher caliber rounds and rifle rounds would have to take more brass compared to your standard 10mm
---
nice, thanks for the info!
---
For me, only when the robots go out of control copying themself.
---
There are solutions but it‚Äôs not laziness or inability, it‚Äôs about number of entities in a world and ensuring stability of the server, I‚Äôm certain it will increase as they said the increase to 600 was a starting point, that being that they monitor how it affects performance and then up it some more, rinse, repeat.
---
Hah, I was referring to your hostage idea.
---
But yeah, I bought the one in the atom shop- the flash sale mosaic tiles- sooo worth it. 
---
we can not even report them in the game
---
So please edit your note, otherwise it¬¥s kinda wrong to complain about something which was fixed :)
---
There's a Holotape picked up in a house outside of Abandoned Bog Town, named 'Where now?' and the subtitles Say Richard is speaking, but the voice file is that of a young woman. 
---
I had a special room in my house for mr. Moo moo, only way I could keep things from killing her lol
---
Ah I got ya completely understandable and for sure annoying
---
I'm on x1 and I've crashed once doing queen but was able to rejoin
---
My game seems to crash most while transferring  items quickly from inventory to stash or trying to join on someones world when I'm  in a different game world
---
Wtf seriously?
---
I meant turrets. You can set up a base right outside of whitesprings and lead them into a line of turrets.
---
oh thank you i changed servers and it's gone
---
Not really the market is going to get flooded regardless. I would like to see a ladder system
---
Mostly duping these days. It's a daily thing for a large part of the community. 
---
Farm the deathclaw 100% spaw at watoga for 5-8 gears
---
We need a ranked poll
---
I do not remember which it was from, sorry. I have only tried claiming a few workshops though. Hemlock Holes or Gorge junkyard if I had to guess.
---
Someone had to get them legit 1st, I think that's what he is asking about.
---
I don't really know much about character building, so I can't comment really, but this has given me some ideas on where to take sniper character once I start re-specing into pistols
---
Ayyy SBQ probably then 
---
Flooded af so get in while it's hot. Though a year+ is where the real money is.
---
Aye. You have fun out there. 
---
That's GREAT
---
I've come across mothman one time a lv 50ish verity and I shot him he jumped in my face beat my ass then flew away like a prick
---
Why burn ammo/ durability faster ?
---
I‚Äôve been playing for the past two hours and this has been great! Hope you have fun too
---
Pro Tip: don't buy the game
---
I could farm at white springs at level 20
---
If you could group up with someone higher level, and go to whitespring and tag stuff. 
---
Or just hang around whitespring and tag things as others kill. You could also train things to the robots to kill and get xp. You could also build a camp at whitesprings with all the turrets ever and bring stuff to it to kill. 
---
Probably better ways. 
---
Psn b_nano69
---
HTML?
---
No, herbivore only doubles the food side of corn soup, not the water.  Am herbivore.
---
No difference what so ever. Same attack speed and same damage unless you modify the super sledge with a heating coil... then it's the same damage still but half of it counts as energy damage. It's just the same weapon with  2 different skins. The only thing that puts one over the other is legendary effects.
---
My psn is bobbymcgee__ with 2 underscores 
---
I said nuked whitesprings, it's not that fast without nuking it
---
I personally would get rid of mister sandman and gun fu and put the points into maxing sneak and covert operative. 25% harder to detect and an extra 35% damage from ranged vats attack. 
---
Sandman is far too situational, and 10% damage bonus isn't needed when you'll already do mega damage, and just the additional bonus from covert operative outweighs it. 
---
I feel kinda stupid for saying this but what do people mean by duping stuff?  I've never heard of it in fo76 untill this subreddit.
---
Thanks I got to try this
---
No but there is a perk that does iirc.
---
&gt;Ballistic Fiber either needs to be more plentiful, or needed less for Armor repairs.
---
I keep seeing this, and I just don't get it. Ballistic fiber isn't that hard to find, and with the White Knight perk, I only need one fiber per repair, which again thanks to White Knight, is rare as shit.
---
Yeah it's shit that we need fiber to repair when it's not needed for building, but c'mon - it's not that bad.
---
seriously..
---
All energy weapons (excluding Guass, and some consider Tesla) are extremely underpowered and break horribly fast.
---
Unfortunately, it's best to hold off those kind of weapons until a fix/buff is implemented.
---
Nuked Whitesprings. You are not on your own - there are up to 23 other people on your server. Wait outside of the golf resort for someone to gather the enemies and run them outside. Hit as many enemies as you can. Collect loot and xp. Someone will likely respawn them.
---
Spam the invite to party emote, learn how to force respawn the enemies. You'll be level 50 in the span of one nuke. 
---
Personal preference, grognak is easier to repair. Depending on effects super sledge has higher damage and more mods. 
---
It says when sighted not aiming down sights that's why I asked. 
---
What vendor?
---
I can't launch nukes tho, and despite my constant server hopping I've only seen 4 total nukes 
---
Watoga train vendor
---
Yeah agreed on that - and it was their stated goal to increase this. But my guess is that not all objects are equally contributing to this problem associated with server stability - and weight is an indirect way to limit this - rather than number of items. If they could just focus on limiting the number of problematic items then I think it would help with the current inventory management issues associated with weight.
---
But if they had the same legendary effects would they be the same?
---
hey,  
---
 i never attacked anyone only  2 times  pvp in 200+level,so i cant say anything approved.  
---
With TSE Gauss you can get close to 9k dmg solo with team prob. around 10k,, not sustained but thats a fact.  80 scorcedbeast are 1 shots.
---
Sadly  I dont own a TSE Dragon  it should be even higher.   
---
I dont know how the dmg is calculated for crits, sneak and headshoot. Combine  better criticals 40% more,  covert ops 2,5x for ranged sneak and a headshoot. Even with additive multiplication.
---
8.8k TSE Gauss x2.5 for sneak =22k+hedshoot 30,8 + 12.3 =42,8k  with your numbers 1% would be  428 dmg.   
---
Even if the stats are calculated differently alot of people arent full hp especially in the nukezone. Not even thinking about PVP 8%dmg amor.   
---
Like i said im not interested in pvp so i probably missing alot of tweaks, but im pretty sure its possible.   
---
Is it rare?
---
Fast travel or switch servers
---
Maybe it worked at the time of your comment, but as of the time of mine it doesn't.  Spoiled food of any type isn't considered meat or vegetables.  Full disease chance and not doubled food intake.
---
Short for duplicating. Using glitches and exploits to create a copy of an item. 1 person gets an amazing roll and proceeds to sell tons of copies at exorbitant prices. 
---
Youre on a Baseball team. What position would you like?
---
A) The Catcher
---
B) The shortstop
---
C) on 1st Base
---
D) Pitching 17 500 fast balls in a row as the Pitcher
---
Yeah, I hear you. It will definitely get better, just needs time unfortunately. On the upside though, devs have a lot to work on and when it gets fixed it will be glorious. It took no mans sky 2 years to get their game to where it needed to be and now that it is one of a kind. 
---
? U legit answered my questions for me I don't give a shit about overseers journey man. It doesn't have a main plot that's obvious even Bethesda knows that but there is lore all over and I'm not about to type to you all the lore I've found . It's legit one of my my favorite things to do in this game. It's a exploration online sandbox game I think you should watch the noclip doc on YouTube they legit said what this game was point by point before launch of the game . 
---
Not really god teir items arnt that hard to obtain legit in this game. Take d2 for instance there is still items so rare they go for 100's of real money dollars even with all the bots 24/7 farming. People wont hold that kind of value to this game, it's moot.
---
Got the same thing going on with my chest plate
---
That's 4 opportunities to power level to 50 though
---
That's cool and all. But people who know a lot more than you or your father have proven that it only shoots one extra pellet. Whether its a bug or not is yet to be seen though. 
---
If duping wasn't fixed and it's a similar method there's a pretty good chance that's still what's going on. 
---
thanks!
---
They cannot in this situation, but there is indeed one where they can.
---
If you are repairing/upgrading your PA at a workstation, someone else can enter your PA and take it.
---
Had a friend with me while modifying mine yesterday.  He got the "ENTER" prompt.
---
Going to pick up a junk one next time he is on and see if he can actually enter it.  But I think he probably can.  
---
Participate in the uranium event with the mole miners just east of Whitesprings when it's up. You get lots of XP from it plus some good loot. Get yourself a good melee weapon and you will demolish them.
---
I mean, I'm totally sure you could hit the bomb with a bullet.
---
It won't do anything, but you can hit it.
---
Yeah but those 4 dont help me now, I can't find any servers with whitesprings nuked, everybody says it's super common but idk maybe I'm just unlucky
---
I've never said that it shoots more than one extra pellet, I said it does twice the damage
---
Mine does the same with the chest piece.
---
Number 8: the weight yard in eastern regional penitentiary.
---
I just want the goddamn phantom weight bug to go away.
---
You can also get them from non nuked whitesprings as well as any other 2 * - 3 * enemy you find throughout the map. 
---
Lets say someone finds a shotgun with two shot and explosive effects and then they use a glitch where the item is duplicated (doubled).
---
No problem
---
WEIRED - I was almost in the same situation. 
---
We started all three at day 1 but I was the only one with a lot of free time to spare. So I continued to play, building my camp, exploring the world but NOT to continue the story alone. Just a little bit questing but we said, we wanna do this together. And while the others stayed in the mid 20th I hit lvl 80 surprisingly soon. Saw the most places, had the most blueprints, even the rarest but it was just not satisfying playing with the others if you can one-slap even scorchebeasts almostly. 
---
I decided to make another character for the handmade plan. Leveled it past 15, purchased several handmade-plans and figured out, that it‚Äôs mich more thrilling questing with my buddies at the same low level and not with 80+.
---
So I decided to put my first character beside and continue with my friends with the lvl 15-20 and to keep an eye more for pacing and how the story leads you through the world. And the whole experience feels now so much better!
---
set welcome mat down.. you should spawn on it
---
I think there was confusion, I was asking why is it a big part of the community  
---
Literally no one is against this.
---
Damn rip
---
Bitch bases must die
---
I got 8 mutations, all naturally and within 3 tries each time. Success looked like - different map areas, usually in water, time spaced &gt; hour apart, prob different servers due to server instability. 
---
Pleasant valley ski resort &amp; Harper's ferry when high level players in the area - super mutants have caps &amp; you can make good caps selling the loot dropped by them.
---
This is from a sniper perspective, but: 
---
I'd replace Grim Reaper's Spring w/ bloody mess. You'll have less kill than hits (usually), and I'd rather have the chance for an insta kill in and out of vats.
---
Not a fan of Mister Sandman. Unless you only plan to play while it's night. 
---
Not a fan of Gun Fu. My thought is I do enough damage to usually one or two shot things, I don't need the damage buff; and even with high AP, you don't get a ton of shots off. 
---
Gunsmith is fine, maybe too many points in it. But that's your prerogative. 
---
Lone Wanderer, if you're solo it's A ok. Guessing you are.
---
Ironclad...gonna say no to that. It's only 50 resis, and you'll need PA for nuke zones and, honestly, PA is just so stupid in regards to DR and hidden flags. It's worth using. I still stay out of it as much as I can; but for killing scorchbeasts and the like it's a must for the most part. 
---
Night eyes, again, only at night. Too restrictive imo. I'd rather have something that is constant. 
---
Refractor, again, only 40. 
---
Crackshot is fine. 
---
Blocker is fine, I've considered it. However I carry more than just pistols, so it's not a big deal; and I always duo. 
---
Oh, well that‚Äôs an easy answer, it‚Äôs because the game is buggy and people have no self control. 
---
Being known for buggy games isn't something to be proud of LMAO, Rockstar doesn't charge 18 bucks for a skin
---
The problem is data, they need to collect enough of it to ensure whatever solution they implement is the correct one and they‚Äôre definitely not rushing anything out that‚Äôs related to stability after that launch. I do personally think anyone who is struggling for space is probably hoarding stuff they will never use. I struggled with weight up to about level 30 but then cleared out all the stuff I‚Äôd outgrown or stuff I was 20 levels away from and now I seem to hover around 400.
---
Who glued this circuit board down?

Thank you for clearing it up, now I know it's the 2 to 3 star legendary
---
Thank you for all the work you do!
---
If they were the same legendary effects then yes 
---
HINT: You can upgrade the headlight on the PA.  I have upgraded 3 out of 4 of my PA now.   I just have problems finding the excavator one now.
---
There's a little clearing in the trees right around there- it's got some weird random events in it. The first time I went through there it spawned a PA chassis with a full set of max raider armor on it. Freaked me out cuz it was dark
---
I got an error message and was only able to see things i already have when i accessed it earlier. I wonder if there's an issue with it. 
---
It's still well worth it.
---
I put my Excavator torso in Mama Dolce's food processor by accident... irretrievable.

Goodbye my friend

Duping lags client side, that's why the entire server doesn't get kicked, just the person doing it.
---
we dare not speak about *The Long Boy*
---
It sounds like a severe case of the local server you're connected to lagging to hell and being unable to send you the data properly, probably dropping some vital information that your pc needs to know 
---
Speaking of t45 is lvl 45 the highest it goes?
---
I also took out all my junk from the box and rescrapped it and that gave me an extra 100 
---
no they can't afford to if they give up on this no one will have faith in starfield they have to make this game work
---
I only have one character but would love to see this so I can mail things to a station vendor, fast travel and sell
---
Sad thing is, most of these issues are daily. Such as the not loading, or weight
---
Not sure
---
Nice, must be random
---
I'm level 22 and only have the metal armor that I'm wearing. Pocketed metal armor would  be awesome but haven't come across any plans yet and don't know  if it exists in this game. 
---
I tried getting to the whitesprings bunker and clubhouse yesterday for new vendors but got my ass handed to me at the clubhouse and the bunker I needed a key card.  Other vendors are pretty far out from where I've been already but will get there eventually.  
---
I did ultimately have to get rid of most of my junk and grenades and sell off all heavy weapons.  Too bad that they can't just bump the weights up so people don't have to resort to bare bones everything.  I found a level 50 legendary armor chest piece at a vendor I had bought earlier and was saving for later but had to sell that back for only 30 caps because of weight management.  I guess I'm just used to fallout 4 where I was a complete hoarder.
---
One that I'd throw on top of this list is a way of silencing, or at least turning down, event voices especially if you have already done them... A toast notification would be better which I have actually gotten so I know the system is there.
---
 They are on the same level as effects and it's tedious since survival requires open ears but then I have to hear the same 1 minute rant on why I gotta help an reoccurring event.
---
pretty much only controling the light boxes
---
I regret finishing her quest. I liked her greetings when i logged in.
---
...and there is still the bug where someone can steal your PA if you are working on it at a workstation.
---
People will still buy their next game. Like I said, they wont publicly say they give up but they might stop pouring as money into it
---
I've found that the best way for me was to farm high level robots at watooga
---
Please change "**Ammo** Need a way to dismantle, sell or otherwise store excess ammo grenades, missiles, etc." to also specifically suggest that ammo in our stash/camp not have weight. That way if I go out of my way to find, loot, and bring back a certain type of ammo to my base for later, then I can use it when I want to.
---
If there is any technical limitations with this, then they can just implement a maximum amount for each type of ammo. Thanks.
---
As others suggested: Let the sign-in finish... Also, I don't know if it's still true, but during BETA friends and I noticed when we joined a friend from the PS4 menu without being properly loaded into the game first, the Atom Shop and emote menu would break until we restarted the game &amp; signed in first. Since then we just start up and sign in before grouping up in game and none of us have had that problem again ( that I know of. )

The barn building set is actually the power conductor/switch set.

I believe you want the barn door set. Could be wrong though

Power armor weighs nothing while equipped. It weights 10 lbs while in inventory. Don't think it's worth a perk point. Unless you're carrying a ton of power armor frames around 1 point in strong back would be more worthwhile. 
---
ive been downvoted for making a thread on this, especially when they put a bunch of turrets that split up the ghouls and make it more annoying to clear it out. or the turrets manage to kill one of them, then nobody gets the exp/loot since the owner is nowhere around
---
i dont even wait to get wanted, i just level any camp that i see there without hesitation
---
Well the nukes we're bugged the last day and a half and nobody could nuke anything. Don't immediately server hop if Whitesprings isn't nuked, check the silo's on the map and see if there's people at them. If there is you're likely to see a nuke soon enough. Other then that you can still farm Whitesprings, it'll take longer but it's decent xp for your level. And you can just start doing the main quest, it's designed to get you to 50 by the time you complete it.
---
And if the super sledge had the heating coil mod? Sorry I‚Äôm asking alot of questions 
---
‚ÄúNo Ragrets‚Äù tattoo please!
---
And I don't think white knight works for power armor.
---
To be honest, Most of your points are what I would love to see in F076, if you get upvoted enough, maybe a moderator will see this.
---
Only happens to me when removing two or more legendaries. I'm on an X so I guess the little bit of a performance boost compared to my friends on standard Xboxs is why it's JUST on legendaries for me as they have issues with all items. I crash more often than them on all other circumstances though which is strange.
---
To this day, I wonder why they had to make legendaries do the stupid "look at me, I'm a legendary" slideshow. It's obnoxious, causes lag a lot of times, obscures visibility, and causes many crashes personally. One of my many menu settings wishes... "view legendary on pickup:[OFF]"
---
Maybe the playerbase will finally defeat Lawbreakers when FO76 goes F2P next month. 
---
Isn‚Äôt the end goal that they die? Why not put that into the players hands? It would keep other players from having to deal with the rando spawns left behind after the duper dies and reward them with caps+junk. 
---
LOL
---
Then it's the same total damage but half of it counts as energy damage which may effect some enemies more than just normal melee damage and effect some enemies less than normal melee damage 
---
In the duffle bag on top of the tower.
---
You also seem very spread out on weapon preference. You have melee shotgun and rifle perks. You should stick to 2 a max.
---
Are you dead yet?
---
Well dang, I'll give that a try - thanks! 
---
I dont want to spend camp budget on that. Its for decorating. 
---
I‚Äôm level 58, have been all around the world and still have not seen one.
---
Honestly if at least one of those things happens I'd be happy. Personally the legendary Hunting Rifle/Pipe Revolver and wearable raider outfits seem to be somewhat of a mistake on their part, they should be relatively easy to fix.
---
... It's mentioned in the post dude
---
I don't use PA a lot but I'm always hitting my weight limit and that extra 3 lbs comes in handy but you're right I'll see what I could maybe swap out for the PA weight card thankd
---
can't over-repair grognak so super sledge is better rn.
---
I‚Äôve seen the player base do nothing but grow since launch and they have regularly updated and patched the game. They‚Äôve outlined future updates.  
---
This post is pure speculation. Poor speculation at that. 
---
Yeah strong back gives you +10 carry weight. Making the  weight of the power armor canceled out. Plus you get a bonus 10 lbs if you're not in pa
---
For their sake i hope not. This game is not as bad as people make it. It is very easy to turn it around in the game of the year. Who ever made the atmosphere in this game was a true artist. The sound design is also amazing. Game itself is cool as hell with launching nukes, amazing explosions in general, power armors with jet packs shooting guns with explosive bullets from above. Very easy to turn the game around because it has a lot of positives, it's only flaw is that the tehnical issues outnumber the positives. Once those are resolved they can also please the people who want more engaging content for the game. Honestly i'm already in love with the game even with so many issues.
---
Actually, Fallout 4 with all the NPCs feels much more lonely then Fallout 76 with some other foreigners around. It‚Äôs strange but how I experience it and why Fallout 4 is no fun to me anymore. 
---
But I‚Äôm thinking to give Skyrim SE after years a comeback. Almost same gameplay but other mindset ;-)
---
Thanks for the info man
---
Is it a perk to be able to over repair?
---
Roleplay that he's Evan.
---
Kill him deader.
---
Thanks again I dropped that point from int added to ST so more carry weight and a bit more melee damage win win
---
I solved the problem by moving all my points from perception to agility to run with pistols instead.
---
Then I never took the pistol weight perk. Then I just never stopped using melee. 
---
It's worked out pretty well honestly.
---
That's a pretty fun bug. I wonder why the post was removed.
---
&gt;End Game should not force you into power armor, make the hazmat suit fit OVER or UNDER everything so you can wear it on top (or under) literally everything else. Some of us don't want to be in power armor and have designed our perks as such.
---
Don't agree with this one and is find how it is. Everyone can carry around 10lb end game armor, the whole point of power armor is to be a walking tank in the battlefield. Power armor was always meant to be that thing you needed for going somewhere dangerous just like the glowing sea in the commonwealth. And with the hazmat suits having zero defense being a bit annoying. A hazmat suit would only protect against radioactive material and airborne diseases. So Go in with a rubber suit with fresh breathable air or take armor the was design with advanced engineering to protect its users from all sort of dangers. Or just take your regular armor that wasn't designed for said use and frie to death.
---
With all of that said though, Non power armor perks, ghoulish type perks and mutations, there should definitely be some kind of option for a ghoulish type play through for people wanting the role of a ghoul to be  able to survive harsh environments without out Power armor or a hazmat suits
---
&gt;Remove the Beach Boys song "Wouldn't it be nice" from the radio station. (Or replace it with Sloop John B, which has a much more Fallout feel to it.)
---
That's a hard NO
---
Hahahahahaha you can't make this shit up. This is seriously videogame coding of early 2000's. What a time capsule FO76 is, holy shit.
---
Unless They make it a paint appearl for the 10mm.

also banable

yep intelligence perk card called weapon artisan
---
Do Silo Gyms! i get around 70 per in 2 min 210 in a run.  
---
I dont even bother with Charleston FD Gym, GreenLodge Gym, vaulttec uni, uni bunker or any other location because they are looted sometimes i never saw a Silo looted.
---
Seeded RNG! And I thought I had the nocturnal curse on everything.
---
EVERYTHING has nocturnal on it. It‚Äôs actually worse than a normal weapon!
---
They should remove it from all drop lists.
---
Sure my [XB1] (GT is wolfsniper2255) I started a few days ago
---
Tbh the fo76 thread is much more active than i expected.
---
At this moment it's more active than readdead online, gta and battlefield, which are the others that i follow.
---
Anytime. You should update your original post with changes you make if you haven't already.
---
True enough those are good. I just looked Silo Alpha today haha
---
I'm mostly just going back and building up every single settlement and doing a "proper" nuka-world and far-harbour playthrough.  
---
I mostly agree I tend not to like the dialogue options/robotic character traits in FO4 but at least there's a reason to replay it for me. I've been paying more attention to companion dialogue and random dialogue as opposed to the story stuff and there is so much I never really saw/heard before... Or atleast didn't notice it. At least different companions say different things for different locations/situations etc.
---
I tried this the other day. Wanted to give away a 3star pipe gun because it was lvl10 but they just looked at the bag looked at me and then wanted to trade... 
---
This is what we get from clickbait YT videos.
---
Of course its speculation... that's the point of asking others opinion but poor? Being worried about a game I like because the company has had PR disasters one after another over and over with the game is "Poor Speculation"? Ok.
---
you've got to be careful doing this if you got it through amazon, they really hate chargebacks 
---
Mainly rifle and melee think it's just one shotgun card but tbh I don't use them much lately so I might add a point to gladiator
---
Good looking out thx
---
Apologies misunderstood what he was saying
---
You can't take the armor.  Me and friends tested it. You can activate the prompt but nothing happens.
---
Pocketed metal armor plans exist, not 100% sure where though. Probably at certain vendors or as rewards for certain events and quests. A lot of the vendors can be somewhat tough to get to. *cough* Watoga *cough cough*, but they can be worth it as they sell some pretty good gear.
---
Yeah it would be nice to have more carry/stash weight. They bumped the stash up from 400 to 600 not too long ago, and I think they plan on bumping it up some more, but we'll have to make this work for now. Legendary armor is iffy, there aren't too many effects that I feel are actually good enough to warrant holding on to it.
---
Slap on a thrower mod and you'll shred through any enemy like they're nothing. Only downside is you'll burn through hundreds of cartridges in no time.
---
The plan is a reward after completing the BOS quest chain.
---
If service rifle is a skin for assault rifle?
---
True and I support the game but everything you listed is just copy paste from FO4.
---
Pretty dumb question if you ask me. Zero chance they give up on it. They already put so much time and resources into as it is. Looking at ESO as comparison, and considering how much shit that game got at launch, I dont see it happening
---
I love the game, but it's not fair that people who have issues with it need to go to social media to get them fixed. I know you're just one man in an endless (glowing) sea of bureaucracy, but maybe you can let the higher ups know that everyone is getting tired of seeing this.
---
Thank you for doing your job and tell the dev team I love them.
---
The character that the outfit is based on is female.
---
Stop encouraging this behaviour...my house gets in the nuke zone when you use more than one
---
Can confirm I got my Cali shocks there. Now if only I could get enough violet flux
---
What's with spamming all the threads with excuses?
---
Oh nooo... Someone made a post about duping and didn't flagellate the virtue badge. How will you ever enjoy Reddit now? People posting and not proselytizing the dupelord and savior stops me from ummmmm....
---
..... right. Next.
---
Maybe they fixed the glitch you used !
---
So you like rifles and one hand melee? Do you like to use vats? Are you stealth or just run and gun. Do you want glass cannon or a bit tanky? Do you want quality of life perks or min max dmg? I can try to make up a build if you want.
---
did he glitch it aswell?
---
ESO launch wasnt nearly as bad as this and it would be be the 1st time a company gave up I mean look at Titan Fall. That game was dead a month after release. I know Bethesda didnt make titan fall but they have also never made an online game before, they didnt even make ESO.
---
Ah yeah ok will do
---
Same
---
What are you, a Youtuber?
---
What game you any impression that Bethesda was giving up on the game already?
---
It's dangerous to run with scissors. It's more dangerous to run with a sword. The release of this game was a minor stumble while running with a sword, resulting in a gash to company repuation and a bit of lost blood of fan loyalty.  
---
Giving up on the game would be like recovering from the stumble by diving face-first into the point of the blade.
---
As if any of these will actually be changed or implemented lol
---
I messaged you on xbox a couple days back, not sure what time your free to meet up if you still have them, im on EST I can hop anytime before i head out to work at 4pm (:
---
I am assuming you are very, very new to this game and not trolling.
---
In that case, you probably do not have enough junk to bulk and sell.
---
So, the options for you are to visit train station and sell extra chems, weapons, armors to the robot stating there.
---
Not all train stations are equal.  There are 4-5 different factions in the game and each "region" has a grouping of vendors associated with that faction.
---
There is a 200 cap pool Shared between all vendors of that faction.  So once you get all caps from a faction vendor, choose a different faction to get more caps from.   Now if your new, it will be more difficult to get to other faction vendors, but there is a timer when the vendors will get more caps, so you can just wait an hour or so until the vendor gets more.
---
I'm not sure what you're trying to say here? I never said dupeing posted were ruining reddit... soooooooo you have no point to make. 
---
lol.  Good thing you were not encumbered.
---
Other people can see a little speaker icon next to your username over your head when you talk. I have my mic on not push to talk and the icon only appears when it detects audio coming out of me specifically. 
---
I could see the icon on myself briefly when I was dying once, too (and going "ughhhh" about it).
---
I did. It's still trash, even with a prime receiver.
---
Please explain.
---
Just joining a friend's world, yes.
---
I definitely agree with all of this, im constantly trolled by players with TSE and i lose all of my loot, cant even defend back and im level 70 with max power armor
---
I think I was there with you. 4 rocket turrets right?
---
When duping fucks up the economy and PvP 
---
I think they ARE already paying with their reputation at this point and it has cost them dearly 
---
They will repair what can be repaired and to save face to create the bare minimum of what they promised, then ride on to the hypewave of the next elder scroll. At the same time make some memorable events in fallout 76 and then activate ‚Äûpublic servers‚Äú to end its game cycle by ‚Äûgiving it up to the modding community to create their own quests‚Äú
---
I am a realist and will most likely net a lot of downvotes but that doesn‚Äôt change my perception of fallout 76 already entering milking cow stage 
---
But what about the illicit smuggler/courier economy? How is it going to have any legs if this too replaces humans with a machine? #noCommo
---
I think that's a bad analogy. Bethesda secretly putting less resources into the game probably wouldn't make much of a difference as the game is completely broken already and people have stopped expecting much of them in this game anyway.
---
I would love to see 2,3,4,5 and 9. 10 is the idea I hope doesn't happen. Not because I like PvP or want it forced on anyone who doesn't want it.
---
I think having an on/off PvP switch in the the camp would keep from splitting the players up. 
---
Yeah, it is.  
---
And honestly, I‚Äôm not going to argue about it with you, I thought I recognized your name and from another thread where you‚Äôre justifying/minimizing the impact of item duplication on the game and sure enough, a quick view of your post history shows that your *very* active on the trading subs with obviously duped stuff, so quit claiming you like this game when you actively undermine it.
---
Can we do something about the dupers and the existence of two shot explosive weapons its negatively effecting the game for legit players and pvp with two shot explosive weapons is no fun for anybody don't matter what build your running if I got a TSE 
---
"You got any radaway?" "no, all I have is WACKY GREEN SICK JUICE".
---
Dear god.... I‚Äôm only on board if they ONLY spawn for dupers. 
---
Yeah, if I‚Äôm running low on crossbow bolts I hit a corpse for a while 
---
To be fair, the engine is from the 90s. It's archaic. 
---
And yes, before a fanboi says engines aren't totally rewritten, bla bla bla. Yes, that's true. But this engine is duct taped together. New features are bought in and duct taped on. It's not the same as going from UE to UE4. 
---
I haven't done a lot of game dev work, only some VR and AR stuff. But I don't understand how or why they'd link collision to textures or how that would even work. As it should be linked to the mesh. 
---
...unless we're actually able to change *meshes* then holy shit. 
---
Hrm.   Well when I bought my light one, I know I paid 400.  (Not featured).
---
I do know the dark was labeled as *new* and it was 600.   I am guessing they adjusted the pricing since?
---
Of course I could have been up way late and playing too long and this was all in my head...
---
Hey, that's a nice video you got there &lt;3
---
Exactly which perk/s do I need equipped to tame a Snallygaster - Animal Friend, Wasteland Whisperer or both? And do the Snallies that spawn around Charleston and New Gad count as solo randoms or not?
---
I can't tell whether I'm failing because it's just that rare or if I'm failing because I'm doing it wrong.
---
When you have mindless drones as the fanbase (luckily a big part is waking up) that still holds out for betterment and hopes for improvement...this is what you get: A studio that crowdsources Q&amp;A and bugtesting...while charging $60 to do so.
---
There's another one at the antique shop in cranberry bog. It pisses me off every time
---
I'm not a youtuber and even if I was I'm not sure how that would relate to my post. I didn't say they already gave up I said "are they going to". Also what gave me the idea? The fact that the game becomes even more unstable and broken with every patch, I have only seen a decrease in performance and an increase in bugs with every uodate.
---
Mostly run and gun I'm pretty tanky and use melee and cannibal for if shit gets crazy 
---
Most of my armor is bolstering with bloodied  weapons and the bloodied mutation it's a fun play style imo
---
I see. 
---
Does it have a faster reload animation than the hunting rifle?
---
The reason why Rose and Grahm are so famous (and I like both too!) isn‚Äôt cause Rose gave us the best quests ever (basically her quest is very bugged and she ordered you just to ran to several places to kill something, take something or interact with something) or Grahm has a superior offering (after some time he isn‚Äôt offering very special plans etc).
---
It‚Äôs because they are almost THE ONLY NPCs with some character-Lines in the game. That‚Äôs sad. 
---
Do you push or hold the button?
---
How do I know if it's on or off?
---
I push the button, but nothing appears on my screen.
---
Beth has two titles that they are known for and if I remember correctly FO4 was even more successful than Skyrim at launch. Beth's life depends on both series, and I am sure they care about both. If and when they can save FO76's unnecessary bad reputation, it will make Beth's rep even more better than it was before FO76. 
---
Just watch Hello Games and what their work with No Man's Sky did to their rep or Zenimax with ESO or Massive with The Division. Saving a "bad" game(which FO76 is not), is considered heroism by the players. 
---
I'm always spending at least 30 mins each play session playing the inventory management minigame but it's not terrible.
---
Btw, never save weapons you can't use now. You'll almost always find something equivalent or better by the time you can use them.
---
If you‚Äôre on Xbox and are interested in a triple legendary super sledge with some fun effects, I‚Äôve been holding onto it for no reason. No compensation necessary - if it might help with your testing hit me up. 
---
I like it .. but it‚Äôs fucked when you right you right. Just hit lvl 57 today so there‚Äôs that.
---
Rad resistant could be reworked to 25/50/75/100% radiation resistance. A four point perk should have a noticeable effect on th e game.
---
Don't know what perks you're running, but mine has no problems with killing. It takes down Scorchbeasts in a matter of seconds, provided they actually land.
---
Yeah, but Amazon's customer service (in my experience) would be understanding enough to give a refund so a chargeback wouldn't necessarily be needed.
---
This^
---
They're always dead though
---
Well, some lessons have to be learned the hard way. 
---
At least you know for future that you bit off way more than you could chew.
---
Dude my stove is tricky, it‚Äôs an insurance nightmare if I don‚Äôt lock it up and you burn yourself.
---
Don‚Äôt blame me, blame the egg head bureacrats
---
I agree with all of these, but especially raider armor and favorite gear saving.
---
I really miss the raider armor from Fallout 3 - http://fallout.wikia.com/wiki/Raider_armor_(Fallout_3) - made it way more Mad Max for me and I'm ALL ABOUT IT. üòÉ 
---
Also if there could be SPECIAL perks for outfits besides the Tattered Dress that would be neat. I mean, the Tattered Dress is something I would wear in real life, but it's not really jiving with my role-playing, but I need more Perception. Bah!
---
I understand if you can't follow your own circle.
---
It's okay. You post about duping and let other people post about not duping. It's the same as letting people be free to dupe and be free not to dupe. I get you've committed to being a white night, but it really isn't necessary for either "side" of the topic.
---
You know what... I recently gave some low level like25 bobble heads that I found in my travels, and now that I think about it, pretty sure he thinks I‚Äôm a duper now...  :(
---
Can't over-repair Grognak's currently, so there's a deficit there.  Personally I feel like the reach on the Grognak's axe is slightly better, but have no metric to prove it.
---
Do not tell my character that...
---
No wonder it‚Äôs so comfy :(
---
Yes sorry, you are correct.
---
I was thinking about the Watoga BOS Vender.  That one sells the T60.
---
The Enclave sells the X01.
---
Vendor Greg sells T45 (Maybe T51) I think.
---
The normal vendors sell the remaining one.
---
Watoga also seem to sell Excavator pieces.   (They are usually the ones that are missing the label for the PA and just say stuff like "Red Headlamp".
---
Funny, I've only noticed increased stability with each patch... Except for the first 12-24 hours after said patch. This is probably because all the dupers immediately get on and furiously crash servers until they can figure out the next dupe method. 
---
ESO was very close to being this bad on release. It lacked alot of content, and the common consensus was "it's only fun with friends", just like 76. Titanfall is a COMPLETELY different story then 76. 1) It was made by a very small company. 2) it was a brand new IP 3) it was supposed to be the competitor to that years call of duty/battlefield. Even released it very close to them. It's also a FPS not a RPG. Didnt really have alot of potential compared to 76. And just because Bethesda didnt make ESO, it doesn't mean they had no oversight on the game whatsoever.
---
Yeah, this, and:
---
- Actually list the effects of ‚Äòmods‚Äô at vendors before we buy them (shouldn‚Äôt really have to google for this); and
---
- Show ‚Äú[Owned]‚Äù or something similar next to plans that we already know. 
---
I get so damn nervous at vendors and I‚Äôm not about to move my camp to find out if I already know the plans to build something that interests me.. You know, just in case I get disconnected from the server again before I can buy it.
---
Also faster caps reset at vendors!
---
Look at my post history all you like, I have never sold an abundance of the same item and I dont dupe. I do however buy and sell anything I find on market76 of which yes most are likely duped as everything is on the trading subs. Another really dumb thing you said is "quit claiming you like this game when you actively undermine it". Are you retarded? People who dupe dont like the game? Then why would they bother? That makes no since. Don't falsely accuse people of cheating with no proof... reported. As for my stance on duping, I just dont care what other people choose to do in a game they paid for... it doesn't bother me one way or the other.
---
It loads in faster, less laggy, and overall higher frames I love it
---
I‚Äôm on ps4 sorry :(
---
I dig.
---
When GameBryo came out, there weren't seperate maps for collision and textures. I do remember Unreal Engine 2 having seperate maps however. So I think GameBryo already was archaic by design and what I have read upon, was designed for MMO's actually. 
---
For example, GameBryo will always need seperate loading screens for interiors. Physics will always are tied to framerate by default. Apparently collision is glued to the textures themselves. So I wonder what else is jury-rigged together.
---
Can you grab a screenshot of your weapon.
---
 please?
---
Nuking other players camp is my new fun factor. Thing is, its hard to find camp outside Whitespring. Luckily my camp is on good resource deposit and time to time I find that spot taken. Idea really aint to open the spot, because it would be faster to just relog, but what is fun in that. So when I come inside and find people on my spot, I launch nuke. Just for fun, just because I have no where to waste resources and doing queens is f#cking boring.  
---
Yes please this is a must
---
You hold it and when you speak while in third person you should be able to see a icon above your head. 
---
What if you find a legendary pipe rifle? Can you mod it to a pistol and back to get the benefit?
---
Nawh, you can stab them with dagger, cause they cant shoot on close range, be flyiing kangaroo like me and win.
---
If you don‚Äôt attack back they do nothing to you. So you initiated a duel and lost. I just got baited by a lvl 93 with a TSE Gatling gun yet me and my team killed him and his buddy multiple times. If you knew he had a weapon like that and you stood no chance you could of avoided conflict.
---
Two shot and explosive should atleast be in the same category so you cant have both at the same time. Probaly not a populair opinion but I think it would be better.
---
Oh dang, are there mods for it I guess?
---
I have explosive two shot guns, and when my team went up against another team in pvp it basically just turned into who could shoot the other person first. Caps literally just went back and forth. Fun for a bit, but if you don‚Äôt have one, yeah, it would‚Äôve been a shitfest and I probably would‚Äôve logged off for the day. 
---
At least you can buy one on the bazaar. Then you‚Äôre on a level playing field with everyone else. 
---
White knight? Lol. All I said was "is Bethesda gonna give up on FO76" get out of here, you're obviously just a neckbeard troll.
---
There is level 70 xo1 power armor??
---
It takes just some hours to make a lvl 15 character and buy so many handmade plans as I wish in Harpers Ferry. Each just some hundred caps. You really should think about your pricing. 
---
Men can still wear all the dresses in the game. 
---
I'm pretty sure they're only allowed to reply with pre-generated paragraphs in customer support. 
---
Leave on passive mode, it does wonders.
---
Yes I can see your point where you can crank faster if by hand thereby increasing ROF.
---
However, when used in a game, I assume that all melee related perks would just affect melee only.
---
I thought it was incoming damage. I've been KOed (kneeling) and it still seemed like things were hitting me but I was fine. I've been one shot "critically injured" (no KO, just dead) by players.
---
Gutsy and their little 22 pistol has ended me instantly.
---
There might even be some sort of "saving roll" or something. I can't tell.
---
I don't understand how that is a bad thing. It's Fallout 4 Online. If they copy pasted Skyrim into Skyrim Online that would be just as amazing. I don't understand why people expected this game to have full Fallout 5 story content. That is a long time to wait. Probably delayed the game 3 years if they added lipsync to human NPC's to this multiplayer game. And why change things that are awesone just so they don't appear copy pasted. They wanted to make Fallout 4 multiplayer and that is exacy what they did. This game was delivered very fast and i'm glad for it. Like i said it doesn't take much to turn it around, so far i prefer it way more then ESO or whatever else i would have been playing if this game didn't existed.
---
Actually it is entirely true. They won't ban someone for duping. A friend of mine has a friend who works for them, not ONLY that he talked to them when his account didnget banned. They informed him the only people they are banning ate the 3rd party users. 
---
&gt; mage. It's just the same weapon with 2 different skins. The only thing that puts one over the other is legendary effect
---
Im on Xbox and willing to take it off your hands if OP doesnt want it and you're willing.
---
50+ should do it, power armor is a must if you want to make a serious impact. No specific build works the best you just have to spec for the most DPS possible, for most people this ends up being heavy gun/melee. 
---
Sign me up!
---
Fair criticism, but the plans are only available in a 6 level bracket (15-20) thus making them rare, any player who wants the plans would have to do this on another character which takes a good chunk of time.
---
&gt;!Read the terminals in the West Tek lab - Snallies and Grafton Monsters are cousin species created around the same time by their FEV experiments on kidnapped humans.!&lt;
---
Oh, project, fuzzy. And use something from an unrelated thread.
---
That's cute. As I said, carry on. Defend the forums with virtue! You're important! Very special!
---
I assume ammo scrapping and ammo selling would be a balance issue for melee. 
---
Melee already has a huge advantage with inventory management and carry weight. If melee could scrap or sell all the bullets we've found it would be that much further ahead. 
---
Maybe make it a perception card. 3 cost. 
---
Indeed. Looks like the OP was a less girly version.
---
What video? I didn't post a video...
---
Thank you for doing this, OP! I wish I could mutate and grow two more sets of arms because I feel that the one set I have can't possibly clap enough for the amount of gratitude this post deserves.  
---
I agree with pretty much everything on this list, aside from the song changes. The vendor changes would be a frigging Godsend. I too would LOVE to be able to include items from my inventory as payment for vendor items as we've had in previous Fallout games.
---
Yes! 
---
Project fuzzy? Unrelated thread? Not sure what you're talking about but I was definitely right... you are a neckbeard troll.
---
Just wanted to say, it's really nice scrolling down r/fo76 and seeing "Bethesda Replied" on most of the important threads :) 
---
Thank you for what you do!
---
That's really enlightening. 
---
&gt;So I wonder what else is jury-rigged together.
---
From what I understand, every new feature is more or less outsourced / bought and then kind of just inserted into the engine. Think like plugins for UE4. 
---
I don't know how accurate this is, but it would explain quite a bit. 
---
If you didn't know, they said that TES6 and Starbound (Is that it? Their new IP) will *also* still be built on GameBryo. 
---
Yep. So expect another, what, 5 years of this? 
---
Wire takes up budget space. 
---
When you store or scrap; lets say a light post wired to your generator, it stores that wire into your budget and you currently cannot remove it through the UI
---
Here is a build I came up with. It's for a low health rifleman one handed melee user
---
A new one was found 20 mins after servers came up lol
---
I'll see if I can tomorrow, it's 1AM and I'm laying in bed right now.
---
I mean it seems you've already given up on it, you post here about instability issues but you are duplicating items and selling them on the forums, helping cause said server instability and ruining what economy that existed before.
---
Also lets you control your turrets' targeting behavior. 
---
There seems to be a mod available to accomplish this. Are we good to install mods without getting banned?
---
Pa. Ci. Fist. Mode.
---
Or Bethesda can sort their shit out. Don't blame other players for Bethesda's/your problem.
---
Me and my body found bout this week ago I think,  but i thought it was more like camo so we laughed and moved on. But now u mention Zetan I am curious.
---
Or they changed it seing as my original comment is one month ago 
---
Why 15 perception? 
---
Furious and vampiric only work on the power attacks of rippers. 
---
I've yet to test bloodied or mutants
---
Again, I dont dupe myself I just dont really care that others do it. Provide proof when accusing someone. Reporter.
---
...... like the one posting in every thread about duping to roleplay the special duckling?
---
Nailing it.
---
I will gladly take one of them if you are still giving them away, my ign is Zanikai.
---
Or berserker sry
---
Oh, you just have a constant supply of every serum recipe and TSE that you found yourself? Riiight.
---
oops, meant for it to be 12 with the other commando perk.
---
I will gladly take one if one is available. My ign is Zanikai, let me know if it's possible!
---
Correct.   I have only a few learned plans.  
---
But you can find mods more often, however many players farm the watoga and Harpers Ferry Vendors for plans/mods by server-hopping.   So they are usually stripped of all the good stuff.
---
The vendors inventory are on refresh timers though.  I believe they refresh at the beginning of each hour or two.
---
So just go to the station a minute or 2 before the beginning of the next hour and check him soon as it refreshes.   Server hoppers will have about 30 seconds between each server hop, so you will beat them on your particular server.
---
Only one I disagree with is number 9. 
---
I've really fallen in love with there being no living people. The game feels lonelier and more post apocalyptic than 3 or 4. 
---
I however wish they would have fleshed out some of the storylines we come across. Even if they didnt make them quests but I want more stories. I want to know about the families who lived on the farms we come across. I want more holotapes of people recording their last days on earth. 
---
I want to have more emotional quests like the Mystress of Mysteries story line. 
---
A constant supply? I've sold only a couple... people are selling them for 2k each so yes I guess I can get as many as I want.
---
Was Xx_EdgelordSn!per69_xX  already taken?
---
I found a Bloodied/Explosive Radium Rifle and stopped playing, because only challenge in the game after that was finding bullets. I will return when there is new content that's for sure, but I hope the balance is better then.
---
Am I too late to get it?
---
In your most recent post on the trading reddit, you sell a guy a set of serum recipes and still have plenty left, and say you have most every TSE. If you're not duping yourself then you're just buying from a supplier and supporting the cause, either way.
---
That's absolutely awesome, nice job man, very creative!
---
Probably a stupid question (I've only now started trying to build a proper CAMP and not just a tent in the middle of nowhere), but how do you guys get so much budget? My current camp is tiny and my budget is constantly full. I cleared my stored items out and it didn't make much difference.
---
dried meat, roast meat, charred meat, skewered meat, squishy meat, crispy meat, fishy meat, stinky meat, rotten meat, icky meat, browned meat, seasoned meat, salty meat, slimy meat, sticky meat, sugary meat, meaty meat, chewy meat, gamy meat, fatty meat, frozen meat, burnt meant, spicy meat, chopped meat, stringy meat, red meat, wormy meat, mashed meat, peppered meat.. and greens for moo-moo üêÆ
---
I am level 112, have over one hundred hours of play time, explored the entirety of Appalachia and have never encountered one of these... wtf?
---
Why even try to pvp lol
---
Aww...haters gonna hate. At least someone has the balls to exploit the flaws in this horrid game...I think I'll start playing again just to dupe ...Bethesda is allowing player vendors..so........
---
Ah that is good to know.
---
I did not test it because was afraid was going to get my good PA bugged.
---
Already got burned on the Order of Mysteries: Novice quest.  I cannot finish it due to getting DC'd while trying to get complete the first part.   
---
Server gave me the Novice Holo but removed all the login items.
---
So now I cannot log into crypto.
---
What do you do when other people are there farming at the same time?
---
You cannot steal the chassis or parts unless you are using "Drop" to place your power armor in the world.  If you are use the power armor chassis, it will place it in the world claimed to you.  Only you can "Enter" or "Transfer" from the chassis.
---
I bought mine from Harper's Ferry I think, seen it for sale a few times from different vendors. Finally bought it then found it in a toolbox in Flatwoods straight afterwards, do'h. 
---
Are you pretending they didn't literally say they would have a main story line? You really love the taste of Todd Howard's dong don't you? This game is fun for like 20 hours of exploring tops until you realize 90% of the lore was "survivor died because obvious reasons" and it means absolutely nothing. The quests are all fucking trash besides dropping nukes, which soon becomes the only thing to do in the game. 
---
The quest design in this game is abysmal, you saying it's the best you have ever seen in an online game makes me think you're trolling. Better than vanilla ESO. Dude keep typing dumb shit I'm loving it.
---
I feel like it sounded something like this. https://youtu.be/JS6IIFf47LE
---
You are a true VIP!!
---
No rules against buying cheap stuff from other people on the reddit. I guess it's a crime to accept any trade on reddit I think would be profitable. If you have any tse weapon what so ever and you didnt pick it up yourself then it is duped. So almost everyone on reddit is guilty by that logic.
---
This was a big undertaking and I think they handled it pretty well, to be honest. It's a new multiplayer game and I've had problems, sure, but not nearly as many problems as I had in other online games in the past. 
---
Eventually they will probably give up on it and stop supporting it, sure. It's the life cycle of many MMOs. They usually last several years first, though, even ones you never hear about anymore, like my old pastime, Pirates of the Caribbean Online. 
---
I want to see where we'll go in a few years with this. There's a few vaults that will probably open, what's that going to do? They'll probably add more to the map. 
---
Heck, maybe they'll just keep expanding the borders. And you know what's SUPER CLOSE to the borders we already have in the game? DC. Can we have a Fallout 3 with redone graphics prequel expansion thing? MAYBE WE CAN. We just gotta believe!
---
nope. it hasn't affected my play because I don't really play it. The few times I did, it was with friends I used skype or discord with.
---
Fuck that! PUNCH THE GRENADE!
---
I went looking for carrot flower to a place near the mothman museum and i fucking saw a cult of radioactive frogs jumping in the middle of some kind of ritual while all the cultist where dead, and inside their bodies i could take robot models (miniatures). WTF
---
Teleport to Welch or do Uranium Fever. The mole miners drop gear that scraps into gears and black titanium.
---
Ah ok. I haven't done a lot of vendor server hopping over there besides for the handmade, guess I should've looked at the rest of the inventory lol. Thanks!
---
Run events. Stash your junk so it doesn't matter if you die and just run events.
---
You'll be drowning in stimpaks and water.
---
Funny. People would be just as upset and complaining if the duping never happened. It‚Äôs like, to have any and all of these duped weps going around someone had to find one first. Sooner than later everyone would get one regardless all in their own.. Found my 1st one week 3 after game release and my second a couple weeks after that. Both I got at Whitesprings and anyone can go do that.. Cmon guys. 
---
You don't need flux or any materials for that matter. Just equip the mod. You already have it.
---
Yes but that is not uncommon. They use SpeedTree for trees, I think Havok for physics and directX or OpenGL for shaders. They recently put godrays in (2008's F.E.A.R. says hello).
---
The problem is the engine's being a jumbled mess of a code and being a sourcehog with memory leaks everywhere. With Skyrim and New Vegas, the size of the save-file is the goddamn memory leak itself, only ballooning in size.
---
The game, as per MMO origins, treats every character as its own entity and has to load everything of that person into the memory. That is why dupers get memory leaks and framerate issues. However the server itself has to keep an record of every item and player too. This is really dumb coding and only made sense in early 2000.
---
Not in 2018.
---
I just use the party chat but since I‚Äôm not teamed up I don‚Äôt get any bonuses for the team perks I have :/
---
My entire excavator power armor disappeared completely leaving an empty chassis, just be glad its still there lol
---
I loved these little fuckers. Though will sadly say I don't encounter em enough. Most of the times I encountered em wasn't much of a surprise. All except for the giant hermit fight.
---
So I'm in the mire running along the road n see a giant hermit crab n decided heh free kill so I tossed a mirv nade at it. It slowly starts turning and charging me. I continue to toss two nades at it both miss. It closes in on me I pull out my combat shotgun and unload into it. It hits me once but damage is more than expected with more going.
---
I look to my left n there standing before me a vengeful mothman that then proceeds to kill. The lucky bastard. Needless to say I respawned n killed em both.
---
BTW mothmans are nice source of ballistic fiber.
---
Shouldn't have to buy the game to play the beta, it should be open to literally everyone, to collect as much data as possible.
---
Yes I somewhat agree however after I placed calibrated shocks on my x-01 (and soon Ill do the same with the excavator for more carry weight when needed) I didnt have any where near as much issues when swapping between armors.
---
Still it makes me wonder about the devs intentions. Since it forces you to choose your weapons wisely. I like that currently. It mixes up what you come across in the world.
---
That being said I am able to run 1xsniper, 1√óassault, 1√óshotgun, 1x2HE, Daisycutter, and a mix of short range melee stuff without any problems. If I choose to run with heavy weapons or think I might need lots of explosives then I run with different perks (like Bear arms that reduces said heavy weapons weight).
---
Yes! My exact thoughts. Perk and Outfit ‚ÄúSets‚Äù that can be customised on a menu, and then used in a quick-slot wheel, as easily as the existing quick-slots. Perhaps ‚Äòleft‚Äô on the D-Pad instead of ‚Äòup‚Äô, replacing the weapon switch. (Xbox)
---
Yes.  T45 caps at 45 right now.
---
I believe different rules apply to fo76 and modding won't be allowed afaik.
---
Dayum that thing is ugly. Well done Bethesda in making nightmare fuel
---
My T51b right arm constantly does this. 
---
Sure it‚Äôs not the Gutsy family?
---
Welcome to the Wasteland fellow nerd.

[This is how i imagined it sounded](https://youtu.be/Wk4g-eyHA8k) 
---
A rideable fucking apocalypse mount would be awesome.
---
That, or it's because he commented close to when the post was made and it's not uncommon for posts to be downvoted upon creation in **any** situation. It happens all the time, even for circle jerk threads. It's just something that happens. Afterall, we are sitting at 60 points with 92% upvotes right now.
---
Maybe stack those pop figures along your mirror frame so you have the lower half? 
---
&gt; i am awaiting an official response here
---
Do staff members of bethesda answer (or even read) what‚Äôs going on here on reddit?
---
torment or enforcer would be good options. Just keep in mind though that the shotgun won‚Äôt help much to ground scorch beasts when you try an cripple wings.
---
If you want to go shotty sidearm I would take pack rat out and max out Shotgunner. With that much strength you won‚Äôt really need it. Then you will effectively have Several options for play style Just another option.
---
Personally I would go with torment, and melee secondary with the strength you have. But it depends on your play style.
---
Colonel dickhead and his ilk can kindly fuck right off.
---
Yeah, I actually hate The Beach Boys song but I‚Äôd just prefer an option to add it to a personal do not play list, because everyone has different tastes in music. Also, maybe you get sick of hearing a song for a while but down the road you want it back, then you could just switch it back on. I‚Äôve played other games where they had this option.
---
I have two questions/bug reports/suggestions:
---
* Hunting Rifles do not drop with Legendary modifiers. Is this a bug, or intended behaviour?
---
* Hazmat suits count against the Chameleon mutation. Is this a bug, or intended behaviour? (If it's intended, could you possibly add some way to unlock a Weightless Hazmat, like adding the modifier to the Prototype Hazmat? As it stands, the Chameleon playstyle kinda gets shafted in nuke zones.)
---
Todd said (in an E3 interview with Keighly I believe) that mods will be allowed at some point and so will private servers. I'm assuming that mods will *only* be allowed on private servers.
---
Number 15: Burger king foot lettuce
---
Again... neck beard troll with no life. You're a real hero man, you really put me in my place for asking if Bethesda was gonna give up on fo76
---
Aid provides something for the player tho. isnt flux for crafting? 
---
I saw a really nice camp there a couple days ago, like a real house. I never saw the player but I repaired a couple turrets for them.
---
My own camp's just stairs leading to a bunch of floating platforms.
---
It is made from hardenes mass which is junk. And it is crafting material which you cant consume.
---
very :P
---
Gatling fun with 500 rounds a large drill shaped bayonet and fast crank 8.04 pounds.  Combat rifle long barrel, red dot, stinging magazine and a measly 25 rounds...18.9.  I make jokes about my gatling being a sidearm but sadly they weigh less than most pistols 
---
I found that doing events made for some fast leveling. Craft as much food as you can, do quests. I found that was faster that just trying to straight grind the same location.
---
The dupe glitch lags client and server side
---
Ouch you've really just been trying to stir the pot today, hope you feel better soon.
---
Thing is, you shouldn‚Äôt be able to absolutely dominate PVP with one weapon type that people are duping and spitting out like candy. It‚Äôs not right to place the onus on the community to balance the game by playing fair...
---
Likewise, and you're still on the wrong topic.
---
Holy shit LOL
---
This guy.  
---
Openly defends/minimizes the impact of duping.  
---
Has a massive inventory of obviously duped items. (My favorite is the trading of matching marine chest, and left arm/leg, looking for matching right arm/leg, *not obvious at all*  
---
Gets called out. Gets *real* defensive.  
---
If my eyes roll any harder I‚Äôm going to dislocate my optic nerve bundle.
---
You could rebind PTT to Capslock.
---
That way you should be able to toggle PTT on and off by pressing the key once (instead of having to hold it down). Plus, there usually is an LED on the keyboard to indicate whether Capslock is active or not (and thus weather PTT is active or not).
---
I haven't tested this in FO76, but it has been working in other games.
---
I love that area! I used to have a huge farm there that led to much heartache.... and eventually writing a AHK script to destroy things, when that one glitch resulted in over 2k each of corn, tato, and mutfruit plants in my camp storage.
---
What level were you when you got it? I'm only level 21 so I am hoping you were lower level lol. Thanks!
---
Or let us form an "Alliance/Clan" and have a unified persistent build space (budget dependent on # of members)  so that way we can get some real territorial warfare going on and REALLY justify bringing this to life in the fallout universe.  
---

Just picked up a few tonight and they were showing up as aid, no longer junk. 
---
It's not unintentional **at all**. Companies continue to do this because they continue to get away with it. They know that out of the 1000 people whose tickets they ignore, maybe 1 takes to social media, then /u/LoneVaultWanderer gets to swoop in and be the "good guy" who "helps out" and fosters the sense of "community engagement" on Reddit.
---
Nah. I didn't know I had to hit enter twice to create line breaks. Should be an easier read now. 
---
It's the same.
---
Marine chest and arm? 
---
Best short term solution is just have a playlist outside of the game that you play in the background
---
That is a great idea. I usually drop molotavs
---
Still wishing for this. 
---
Duke nukem
---
Yeah even at 428 they would only receive about 42 health points lost.
---
See your Damage gets nerfed to 1% and they receive based on regular Leather armor only 10% of your damage. That can very with different Armor and stats.
---
Um. . . No. It took a lot note than that to repair all items from the camp device.
---
Get a pack of pipe cleaners, and change your screen.  ;)
---
Stabilized flux is pure flux. If you look at the components of stable flux (like how it shows a fan is made of screws, steel, gears, etc) you will see that it is made up of pure flux.
---
When farming flux, make sure to have the green thumb perk equipped, as you will get 2x the amount of flux. Also when crafting stable flux, slap on super duper for the double batch craft chance as well.
---
Oh didn't know about the private servers. 
---
I wasn't sure on the reason behind the no mods but I heard it was because they wouldn't make any money on the cosmetics if modding was available.
---
Same thing mate
---
Screws are called "loose screws" fyi
---
Names aren't the same as their crafting, cause Bethesda
---
**Very well done and I agree with virtually all of it!**
---
I don't know why *bloody mess* should speed up conversion to *meat pile* but I'll take it ten times over if it means we get even a tenth of this list.
---
Also, the song choices are too based on personal opinion. I would edit them out of the post to promote support.
---
Additionally a few of the requests seem to be mentioned more than once...like the *easily find dead bodies* suggestion, although I do believe that it's importance might warrant extra mentions. ;)

So, the game is dumb and it doesn't show you what the legendary effects are on a weapon past the first. Like, when you pick it up it will say something like "+15 damage versus insects" but it could have two more effects that it doesn't mention at all. You have to look at it in your inventory and see if it has more than one little diamond/star under its name in its small info box. On PC you press X to inspect it and then you can see all of the legendary effects listed out. 
---
Basically always check how many diamond/stars in your inventory and inspect if there is more than one.
---
This is still happening. It‚Äôs less then when I started playing but still if you spend to much time on a server you need to jump to another server to team up with someone that‚Äôs just got to that server. It‚Äôs almost like the server has a time out error for teaming up. 
---
Yes. There's even a bot that adds flair after a post's title letting people know that Bethesda replied.
---
The helmet? I got it at level 80. But someone else here mentioned that he got it with character with levels lower than 5. So I guess you dont need to rush it, you can get it on any level. Just do responder events and rng will give it to you eventualy.
---
Random event cant spawn when there is a base nearby, could spawn unique responder trader bot (like grahm). 
---
I do. I leave it on 2 and VSS off. Like every game.
---
Haha legendary wood
---
Yes, so you should just stop playing right now.  Bye!
---
That's a fair point. I still think it would be helpful if we know where we stand on .b2a modification and my "P.S." as well.
---
glowing mass, high radiation fluid, and the flux itself goes under the aid catagory.
---
Hardened masses go under junk, as they can be scrapped for ultracite. 
---
Stable flux as said before is used for crafting, so it is placed under junk as well.
---
Wetsuit is great, but it‚Äôs not ‚Äò2 cloth/5 plastic each before SD‚Äô great.
---
True but using it to cover more distance doesn't work. Not sure it gets you anywhere marsupial can't (I have both).
---
Not sure if this is related, but my game briefly glitched tonight while walking up a bumpy hill while in power armor. After walking up the hill I couldn't jump at all and my power armor wasn't making walking sounds. I was like, sliding?, but my character was making walking animations.
---
I got out of my power armor and got back in and it was fixed. Not sure if that affects mutations but maybe that will help. 
---
I had a similar bug where I got stuck in the VATS blurry on the edges mode while I smacked a Mr. Gutsy that suddenly became completely invisible. Once he was dead my vision stayed blurry on the edges but everything else worked the same as when out of VATS. I found another enemy and VATSed it and after that it was fixed again.
---
Some kind of getting stuck in things bug seems to be affecting a few of the systems.
---
This is fine work; total game change for my CAMP.
---
I was walking along the road south of Harper's Ferry where the Hermit Crab is.. (Bus-Crab).
---
Then flap, flap, flap... Crap.   So I look up and start shooting the Scorching Beast now pummeling me with crazy flashes of bright colors all over.
---
Dive for the trees to the side of the road.  Then something else starts machine-gunning these flashes of bright white and I go from 80% health down to dead in about 0.5 seconds.  Er... What?
---
Brown bag recovery.   Scorch Beast is flying around above the trees still at half life.   Hmm..  Now what could have killed me so very quickly?   So off trudging into the forest, over the next hill side...
---
Brrrrzaaappp.   Like 1000 shots going off in very rapid fire.  Same bright white flashes and dead in about 0.5 seconds again.   What the...
---
Third attempt.   Bag recovered and this time scanning from far away with long recon scope until I lock onto him:  level 45 Assaultron Dominator.   That is the scariest thing in this game. 
---
Snipping and running before he gets into range, I was able to get him and I think he dropped a legendary but do not remember "Legendary" being in title.
---
Advice:  do \*not\* let this guy get within medium range.
---
must be tired of seeing all these smooth skins 
---
That‚Äôs annoying they need to use the same terminology of stable is pure and pure is stable. Pick a term and stick with it. 
---
You don't use the companion app at all? 
---
He has the same cap pool as watoga station. 
---
High rads and one of the masses are in aid items.
---
The other mass (hardened? I forget) is junk. Be careful not to scrap it for Ultracite.
---
For me that has to be the most common PA plan I've seen
---
People either wave, run away or give me something - but I try give them something first
---
As the other guy said, ‚Äúpure‚Äù flux is just labeled as ‚Äústable‚Äù in the chemistry bench. Remember not to scrap-all when you‚Äôve nabbed hardened masses and throw on green thumb if you‚Äôre gardening in a nuke zone. You‚Äôll end up with far more than you need.
---
And don‚Äôt forget to drop or sell the ‚Äúinert‚Äù flux after they decompose and turn into sandbags.
---
Nope not specifically anyway. Not logging out/in at Whitespring seems to resolved the issue.
---
No... I'm gonna keep playing the game I paid for.
---
you can eat the unstable flux actually. gives you a slight boost to disease resistance as well for some odd reason.
---
High radiation fluids and glowing masses are consumable as well, but provide no benefit whatsover really.
---
saying they won't isn't the same as saying they cant. They definitely can.
---
I‚Äôve noticed this too. Every since 1.03 update it has been happening more then other previous versions. 
---
Just ask it politely
---
Yes, I am aware of the Drop/Deploy thing.   I am not talking about those characteristics at all.
---
This is when you are working on your PA at a workstation.   Anyone nearby can come up to the PA there while you are working on it and get the "Enter" prompt.
---
But as someone else said, they tested it and you cannot actually enter the PA.
---
I like the idea. Reward those that go the distance and actually continue to play.. Lord knows it‚Äôs hard with the constant disconnects üò©
---
Hey friend, you got a weird pink nub coming out the side of your face that looks like it's alive.
---
...oh wait, that's the tip of your tongue protruding through your cheek.
---
What would be wrong about it? Of course you can defend your buddy.
---
It'd be awesome if there were more super mutant behemoths. I found a glowing one lvl 91 roaming around outside the gates of whitespring area.
---
You don‚Äôt care because you are a part of the problem, and I misread. It was about sentinel armor. Not the point, the point is your behavior negatively impacts both the servers that you do this on and the community as a whole. Full stop. Just do us all a favor and delete this dumb thread.
---
It‚Äôs a game, not Wallstreet dumbass. You want a trading simulator, ~~Spreadsheets ‚Äòn Screensavers Online~~ EvE is that way.
---
Agree 
---
Also I know its kinda pointless but a in-base turret defenses. 
---
Awesome, I will keep scrounging for it then
---
Not sure if listed, but I want to be able to get out of scope/zoom mode exactly when I let go of the left trigger. For some reason it stays in scooe while the gun is being cocked, and I have to re-press the trigger to get out. I'm hoping it becomes more like battlefield of CoD, where the holding of the trigger directly correlates with the scope being brought up.. 
---
Also, I found Excavator mod in the Camden fair grounds laying on a crate or tabletop.   I believe it was Motion-Assist mod?
---
Did you loot it? Y/N.
---
That's about all there is. I've picked up identical legendaries with the same affixes, value, and CND so.... I don't think you can tell by any attribute or similar.
---
Honestly, you dont really unless the person you are trading with has like thousands of pounds worth of gear on their person, and the item you are trading for they have 30 copies of.
---
I believe 7 or 8 but tbh  you don‚Äôt neeed em just find out the weeks code and you can just go straight to the silo 
---
8
---
I spent the day at the museum of mothman praying to our god, all hail the mothman
---
conflicting reports
---
unless you're getting yours from game files, I'd take it as a grain of salt
---
One you get it from nukacrypt.com sometimes they have two and u gotta try both but normaly someone figures the weeks code out and posts it on that site 
---
This happens sometimes. Usually just have to re-equip SIN
---
Technically? None. The codes are posted online by the community and cracked very quickly. You just need the code to enter in to the silo.
---
I just had the same though earlier today. Someone in a facebook group said "I don't think duping is a big problem" and I replied "Sounds like something a synth would say!"
---
If Bethesda gives up on 76. There will be a lot of pissed off customers and I feel like legal action will probably take place. Bethesda doesn‚Äôt want negativity actions in the media. 
---
Most duped guns are 3 stars,TSE,bloodied, etc etc basically the rarer the gun, the more likely it is duped 
---
The only way to know for sure is if 1) you see them duping it in front of you 2) they just straight up dont care and admit to duping
---
1st I dont dupe and 2nd I dont have to delete the thread as it breaks no rules. I dont know how my post about concerns with fo76s future turned into this witchhunt but you can just leave the thread of you dont like it. 
---
It only has one tse pump on him at the moment of trade just 2 stars
---
You can't.
---
8 per silo.
---
but its easier to just go onto [nukacrypts solved page](https://nukacrypt.com/solved) and see if the decrypted codes for the week have been posted.
---
Nope! You reacted appropriately.  Dickheads wanna PVP then they better be ready to fight everyone that's in a team.
---
Yes this was a big problem for me but i found it better to not let them snap and just line them up it can be hard i must admit i spent 2 hours of my stream the other day doing this
---
I jumped for 24 straight hours not 1 calibrated shocks. Gave up and bought 2 on market reddit. Next trip to enclave one was on the vendor lmao. Fml
---
probably legit then.
---
Or at least they got it from someone who duped it and then are now selling it themselves. 
---
Poor choice in categorizing 
---
I wanted this early in the game, and dont oppose it now...but honestly not much need for it with vendors capped at 200 caps. Junk easily wipes them out.
---
Nawh, kill everyone who do not respond to your waving. It is rude to ignore others, and only commies does that.
---
Word. 
---
Is there any problem in the future having a duped gun?
---
The video japan posted
---
its 8 
---
Upvoted 
---
I think the point is that overpowered guns make the game trivial, not that it is hard to get them. 
---
I've figured out what triggers the bug. Everything works fine until you send a team invite. While the invite is pending, mutations are disabled. As soon as the other player accepts (or declines), mutations resume working. I've also had mutations disable when a team mate drops team. 
---
As far as we know, no.
---
&gt; it also ruins pve when someone in my squad can just 3 tap a lvl 80 scorch beast 
---
you don't need a TSE to do this.
---
plasma flamers have 300 rounds a magazine, takes...80ish? to kill a SB but it's a wide AOE
---
That is just a coke my dude
---
Nice rifle!
---
NoFilter 
---
Yeah. They're creepy. 
---
I think I've been most freaked out by wendigos, especially the first one I encountered. Those things just radiate malevolent evil. 
---
so you went looking for a fight, lost and are now salty? yep, checks out with every other "explosives op, nerf pls" topic on this sub. pretty sure you wouldn't be complaining if you were on the other side.
---
what if he beat you with pistols? should they nerf them too? there are half a dozen ways to oneshot people.
---
Good with salt helps me a ton with actually getting to a crafting station/selling it before it "spoils"
---
This! I spent a couple hours last night placing 20 letters. And tonight another hour or two placing 12 more. Snap should... be snappy :-D
---
Did you know if you add the letter "r" to "analogy" you get "analorgy"?
---
Just above level 50, "airhawk_henri" I won't be able to play just yet but I'll love to play in an hour about, we can speak more over PSN
---
Hahahahah yes I‚Äôm dead
---
I had been making to post this for weeks,  actually thought I was going crazy! I was 99%  sure I had a radio during the beta but couldn't find it anywhere since. 
---
I kill SBs all the time with a non-legendary handmade... and about 500 bullets.
---
Besides looking in the crafting menu? I do not believe so. 
---
It would be nice to be alerted whether you know it or not though. 
---
And if they enjoy that sort of thing, then, they can do it... without lube! 
---
Thanks. Sounds like it isn't new but I'm shocked I didn't notice it before.
---
I usually see them at the Watoga and BOS vendors. You can also server hop in an area close to there for the wetsuit plans itself.
---
You will never know if you didn't loot it yourself.
---
Oh, even an invite does it?
---
So you‚Äòre having trouble lining the words ‚Äû I DO‚Äú
---
Are you trying to answer a marriage proposal with neon lights?  (Girly squeee)
---
Assaultron Dominators are way worse.
---
"Because Bethesda" describes everything about this game. Seriosuly:
---
Why are mods scrapable?
---
Because Bethesda.
---
Why is the game so buggy?
---
Because Bethesda. 
---
Why is the balance so bad?
---
But what if they enjoy that? 
---
Like lube is cool, but without is better, and then added courseness is awesome? 
---
What kind of *degenerate* are we dealing with here!? 
---
I never really understood the obsession with the mothman until I did the lighthouse daily mission and met a wise mothman face to face. Changed my life forever, I am truly a converted.
---
Praise be him.
---
Same. Although for me I started an alt to try melee after getting absolutely wrecked by someone and feeling a bit useless in nuke events with my sniper build.
---
1. Melee is super OP and just wrecks everything. Some of the perks are insane.
---
2. Having actual quests again is great -- endgame this time I need to actually do more events rather than just wandering whitesprings
---
3. I have the handmade rifle plans
---
4. I just know how to play better so I am much more efficient and therefore am not struggling for mats/resources the whole time. e.g. I know not to repair my low level armour but just let it break then ditch it for something else.
---
Nice
---
Lost four t60 mods my friend bought me when trying to craft 5.56 ammo. Worst part is it didn't even show my resources going down/the text box of what's being used to craft it just the occasional Super Duper guy popping up on the side. When I tried to use the station again, I still had well over 300 steel left but no mods.  
---
Can you also please add 2 authentication account security? I actually wrote quite a detailed post about this [https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/a7x93t/we\_need\_better\_account\_security/](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/a7x93t/we_need_better_account_security/) and I was really hoping it got some traction from Bethesda, but didn't.
---
For a second I thought you were talking to someone named Beth. Time for bed. 
---
Truth. That and hardened mass being auto-scrap, while fucking beer bottles are safe? Undeniable sign of room temp IQ somewhere on the team.
---
Perception does not add any damage btw.
---
I‚Äôve only ever had them stare at me from a distance.
---
Thank you for the Reply. But it doesn¬¥t answer my question to 100%. I have some Upgrades  available, but i was looking for the best one. Server hoped for 2 hours yesterday to find the plans in harpers ferry, but no luck
---
I have the Black Cowboy Hat and it is not from the ATOM shop.
---
Like... jagged knives wrapped in sandpaper? I mean eventually we pass from the "masochist" realm into the "suicidal" realm but... I guess some people enjoy self mutilation so... maybe we force them to server hop for a jetpack mod then base build until the mod scraps, and then make them server hop for another one?
---
They said that modding is not supported but they aren't banning for it. It's when you use third party programs to cheat and the like. 
---
I use mods that make certain objects glow, UI mods to make it less terrible, a perk manager to make that more bearable, some others I don't remember. 
---
You're good OP. 
---
As for servers, they said there will be private servers; but it will be through them. Which is really, really unfortunate. 
---
Pure speculation, but I'm betting we won't have access to most of the server. Just a gui with some options; and any mods we want to use will have to go through the creation store. 
---
Fair enough, sorry I couldnt help. Im not sure what the best one is tbh, but i do see wetsuit upgrade plans at the vendors mentioned previously. Best of luck mate.
---
Problem is when someone puts a house there and prevents the spawn.
---
Here's a few tips that I ended up doing also a few exp food boost you could add on to the exp grinding. If you have already been to cranberry bog there are cranberrys which you can harvest and make cranberry relish and or drinks which adds on 5% exp boost plus sleeping adds another 5% exp bonus(2hrs duration). Before I knew about whitespring exp grinding and youtube what I end up doing was shooting once each ghoul or throwing any mocktail and let the security robots handle the ghouls or set up my camp defenses I have where its near the building where its filled with ghouls. The white spring.
---
Or just do events uranium event is a popular one.
---
Sad but so very true
---
Unequip, re-equip.  
---
And if you do that fast enough, it works like the old carry weight exploit.
---
FWIW I've had people who I haven't engaged with, let alone accepted a duel, do full damage to me. 
---
Still not sure how. 
---
They could make if it you have the "Scrapper" perk equipped "BULK" items in your stash do not count against it's weight limit, that would help a bit
---
good-ass bot
---
Ooo cool to know. Havent been hunting flux yet cuz I'm still too low lvl 
---
So... did he 3shot you? or... 6shot you?  
---
EH? EH?
---
So regular taco bell?
---
Awesome! Will add you in a bit
---
So he posted a video claiming it was proof that I was wrong... I told him actually if you watch the video it shows it first not working, then it takes the guy 10 seconds to figure out how to get it to work. 
---
So in your mind, it's my video? That's some logic.
---
Thanks a lot dude :)
---
Because it would ruin the whole existing story.
---
Oof, those got to be the most expensive 20 or so shots 5.56 you have ever crafted 
---
Yeah, especially after a nuke, check the vendors in whitesprings. People usually unload the stuff they don‚Äôt want there lol
---
This won‚Äôt be too helpful, but you can buy at least the first and second (treated and resistant, respectively) upgrades from the Watoga and BoS bots. Make sure to buy, use, leave server, and go back to get the next level. 
---
After that, only the Enaclave vendor has continued to sell to the top tiers (protected, shielded) of their own faction-themed underwear for me. There‚Äôs a post somewhere on this sub that details the process for that particular set.
---
Same, I use this as my base but it‚Äôs all underground in the pre-existing structure. Just crammed all the crafting stations in the bunker with a small generator and some decor. Only wish it could fit a PA station and I‚Äôd be set!
---
I'm typing dumb shit ? Your being an idiot critisizing me for my own opinions? And no I didn't say best story in an online game is aid it had some of the best in game lore stories in online games. Only idiots would bring Todd Howard up on this anyways? If I didn't enjoy the game I wouldn't play it ? No one would forcefully enjoy something they don't like that's just stupid . This isn't a MMO this is a sandbox game do what u want in it . Other wise don't play it. I'm not gonna be replying to you anymore so go ahead and get the last word  cuz I won't see it.
---
"OVERPRICED LETTER SIGN" and "RADS? DIAL 2411" 
---
I have my decontamination unit set up with a keypad :-D
---
I got one myself 3 star explosive but I have yet to test it. Also if anyone gets a explosive 2 shot gatlin plasma it sucks. the durabilty wears out TOO quick.....
---
"Mr. Moo Moo", killing "her"
---
I'm not one to judge but it seems rather fickle on the prospect of its gender lol
---
Census violence event random reward
---
...and here I thought that all those memories were lost:
---
Like tears...
---
In the rain.
---
Because Diablo came out in 1997 and this is 2019, who the fuck wants to sit there and pray to RNGesus for 300-400hrs to FINALLY get a two shot explosive weapon or what ever the actual fuck it is you want? Pray to RNGesus? Fuck that I'm using my BRAIN to minimize the efforts/ammo used to reap maximum reward just like Bethesda is doing with the Fallout franchise. 
---
What's even worse, they are getting **reordered** inside inventory each time you put down and then pick it up.
---
They fixed it in a patch. That‚Äôs called ‚ÄúAdvanced Power Connectors‚Äù now and the barn building set is the real thing.
---
Its a perk.  A couple of them actually.  Animal one at the highest rank allows taming of animals.  Creature one allows taming of creatures.   This only works if you have enough points left in your CAMP budget.   
---
Its under resources tab and called "fertilizer pen" or something similar.
---
300+ too, jelly
---
that's a good question Im going to test it out soon.... and see. Im very curuious about that .
---
Yeah but that would reward players too much, Bethesda would never go for that :(
---
Build a barn next to your house for it and lock it up. Thats what i did.
---
Those take up a lot of camp budget, make sure you got enough free before trying.
---
Why bother, there's like 5 songs on the radio.
---
I didn‚Äôt look through all of the pictures but I‚Äôm gonna guess OP has no turrets. 
---
We're you at the center? Like did a bomb hit your head? Were you at "ground zero"
---
&gt; Speaking of which, my female's bra straps need not show when wearing bare-shoulder styles.
---
I mean.. this _is_ west virginia.
---
You craft with purified water and unstable flux tho
---
I want different colors so badly, fuck baby blue
---
I can't tell how many times ive crashed whenever I get near or around whitesprings after a nuke has been launched in that area.  Id always try to group up with anyone out there so that if I lag out or the game crashes I can log back in to the game.
---
Variation? So I dont have to hear the same classical music all the time? Why not bother?
---
I live next to a triple Brahmin spawn... and have the vegeterian mutation... awesome.
---
eh, it's not that good. I mean, anything tse *is* good, but I play explosives religiously and 16/32 damage without proper speccing ain't gonna break or make.
---
you want as many explosions as possible, so either shotguns or a high fire rate.
---
Been doing this a week after launch and every day I walk away with 30-40 legendaries 1-2 3\*'s and a handful of 2\*'s doesn't matter if I'm on site or off dicking around in another corner of the map for 2+ hrs, the loot sticks around for quite some time regardless of owner location. Farm smarter not harder kids.
---
They should have seen my Power Armour Storage Facility on Spectacle Island then... It contained one of every type of obtainable PA in the game, mounted on frames and sitting in those nice PA display thingies. 
---
It was guarded by one sturdy lady in a mechanic's coverall and a couple of angry custom Automatrons. 
---
If they remove the beach boys song I will riot. It fits wonderfully thematically and its my second favorite song in the game, after country roads of course.
---
I used the serum so I don't really have any negative effects, so I can't accurately answer that one.
---
Nooooo. 7 frames, a few extra torsos and the joy of looking ah-may-zing!
---
For the nonexistent radio?
---
Yes count me man I've been searching for those plans A VERY LONG TIME but havent got the luck to get em...... Im on ps4 
---
Like when you inspect a piece of gear to see which mods it has? If that's what you mean, I support the idea. 
---
Actually the newest dress is inspired by Christian Dior's new look. 1950s fashion look it up.
---
How about this comparison then:
---
Right now, a bobby pin weighs as more than boiled water. 
---
I think the only thing that uses unstable flux as a ingredient is the orbital scan and strike grenades.
---
(Girly squee slowly dying down)
---
Oh, oh well ... one shower please 
---
You mean like renaming your rocket launcher to "Clamfelcher" before you try to sell it to someone? 
---
Another idea is having those powered speakers play the radio out loudly at your camp rather than some annoying monotone, which can be switched over to radio at your camps terminal. But yeah, we need that Jukebox playing something else other than classical.
---
Thank you so much.. Now all I need is a nuclear key card, could anyone spare one? 
---
&gt; And that clearly wasn't enough, plus the advertising of it "pre-order the game and play the beta!" only during ridiculous hours where many couldn't partake unless they took off work/school/stayed up crazy late hours.
---
I have a super flexible schedule, and I couldn't make it work so I could play the beta without forgoing some of life's more important responsibilities. 
---
Aw hell naw.
---
a. Licensing was definitely a bitch for that, so they won't ever.
---
b. I think it actually fits it quite well since the song revolves around the ideal of marrying young, which was a prime thing during the Nuclear Family.
---
c. Just let us customize the radio instead, I don't wanna hear hacking and wacking twenty times a day.
---
I thought they would change if I added a terminal... Sad
---
I like the idea of the powered speaker that could be funny to blast country roads from my camp
---
If Bethesda would fix actual problems with the game, ie (server stability and grouping problems) instead of worrying about fixing exploits there would be a lot less people asking for refunds.
---
I¬¥ll give it a try. Thank you! :)
---
No there aren't lol what the fuck? TSE weapons ignore any and all logic of stats and power armor. You know it, I know it, everyone's experienced it. It's not fun whatsoever to have a weapon type that is basically the hand of God with 0 drawbacks. You don't have to hit the target even, just the ground near them and they're dead. You demeaning very real criticism doesn't make you cool or somehow intellectual, it makes you a dickhead.
---
I'd like to add, just let us customize the radio, and try to put more stuff in. That's the best solution.
---
I like my Brian Wilson.
---
I have so many spoiled veggies in my inventory, I constantly have 100+ fertilizer.
---
I even choose to repair the destroyed plants instead of scrapping/replanting because... I'm lazy.
---
Indeed that's the beet solution. I'm currently playing a heavy metal playlist which is really funny when you fight scorchbeasts.
---
I already bought both, but there are even better ones. I want to wear the suit, but atm the fully upgraded vault suit is better.
---
But thank you for the reply! 
---
&gt; There are technically perks to help all these issues, they're just completely unnecessary and feel bad to take.
---
Yeah, perks should take something good and make it better, not take something broken and make it work. (Good With Salt, I'm looking at you)
---
Yeah, every time I invite my buddy (or someone in a blast zone) I have to deal without my super jump height (marsupial) while I wait for their accept/decline
---
Try a 2 shot auto laser rifle with hair trigger, full health to broken in 2 clips/reloads :-)
---
2 diseased and a boss were guarding the overseers house in Welch when I was around 28ish. Thankfully they can‚Äôt fit into the doors because I was _not_ equipped to fight 3 of those at that level. 
---
ü§£üòÇü§£üòÇü§£

Why such high charisma 
---
Same happened to me it was when I was at level 20-35 and I think I was trying to get all the keys for the secret nuke cola power Armor paint and I was in the mountain wondering to the cranberry bogs when I saw something from the corner of my eye but it disappeared I kept hearing a cicada type noise but couldn‚Äôt pin point the location of it that‚Äôs when I saw that red eyed moth hitting me it‚Äôs was insane I was jumping and trying to hit it but it would just destroy my health bar and teleport away so I couldn‚Äôt hit it after 2 minutes it just knew I wasn‚Äôt good enough for his presence and disappeared into the West Virginia mountain till this day I vowed to never go to point Pleasant and or take and cook moth man eggs 
---
Seems like a waste of time imo, rather have a new radio station or stuff added to the current.
---
Most female outfits in Fallout games always looked better than the ones for males.
---
I would love that. Maybe get a area for that in Whitespring. Maybe add in Blackjack to and use Bots as dealers.
---
Screaming into an open mic because video game? 
---
I'm sure your friends can't get enough of you.
---
I still haven't seen all of the monsters in the game (haven't seen the Mothman, for example), but of the ones I have seen I think it's an even toss between the Snallygaster and the Honey Beast. Although, the Snallygasters have been slightly harder to kill so far, so they probably freak me out just a little bit more. 
---
I‚Äôd guess they would have their lawyers say the emotes are enough communication. 
---
https://imgur.com/a/VThlTLK nah just this LUL
---
My only encounter with a Mothman was disappointing. I was on the edge of the lake next to Silo Bravo and saw a shadow on the edge of the cliff above. I was only in the teens in level at the time so I immediately crouched and was already at [Danger] so I knew I was probably fucked. I started shooting at the thing, and it... didn't move? I kept shooting, doing very little damage, for about 5 minutes and around halfway through it's health bar it slowly drifted backwards to where I couldn't see it from the bottom. I thought it was finally coming to get me, but a few seconds later my status changed back to [Hidden]. Haven't seen another since.
---
My favorite encounter with one was wendigo cave the atmosphere of everything was so awesome plus it was my first time fighting one so I was so scared 
---
Emotes
---
melee. there's a well-known one. I'll let you figure out the rest by yourself.
---
the game is broken on a fundamental level. anyone who came in expecting a balanced, competitive pvp is a fucking moron. this is Fo4 with an online mod.
---
legendaries are fun. leave them alone.
---
On top of that
---
You can only be awarded the next rank, after you have the previous
---
But yes, Cranberry Bog events all *apparently* have a chance to drop them
---
I'm yet to see one though
---
This issue bugs the fuck out of me. Gaming in general is guilty of this overall admittedly not that it's okay, I've been nudging for this sort of compliance with Overwatch (in terms of gameplay aspects specifically but), the lack of a text chat in F76 RUINS the social experience of a SOCIAL game for almost everyone and leaves hearing impaired people pretty much out entirely. The entire industry needs to be held accountable for this on all fronts.
---
Yup. I have a plan for the assaultron head, and a scrapped head in my inventory waiting for this bug to get fixed. But I have something like 5000 fusion cells right now, so I'm not testing to see if it's still a thing until someone shows it to me fixed in a changelog. Already got burned by that twice before I figured out what was up. 
---
I was changed when he attacked me for eating his eggs 
---
I don't hate this game but it's so funny if you actually think about it. The fact that people have to message others asking for them not to use explosive weapons or everyone and the server will crash
---
&gt;imgur ‚Äûoops we couldn‚Äôt find that page 
---
I can‚Äôt see!
---
Can you show me a pic of your non quest Rose's Syringer?
---
Hrm, I am always running out of plastic and trying to get all the mods for combat armor.  So...
---
I just learned the plan for Shirt &amp; Pants underlining.  I will try making those and selling and see what I can get.
---
Hopefully only takes cloth, I always have way more than need of that.  If I can get 10 caps each, that would be fantastic.
---
If only that were true... instead of getting like 5 of those out of my 10 treasure maps.
---
Currently there isn't.
---
Moreover the workshop items are named in such generic fashion that makes the task of working out what one is missing... arduous.
---
Not only that, plans are also misnamed... The Marine Armor dense mod plan being named Combat Armor instead comes to mind. 
---
There is a way, courtesy of a kind modder, to get less inane naming on the workshop items; check the nexus depending on your stance on mods.
---
What most of us who would like to keep our sanity have done is make spreadsheets for workshop items, weapons/armor/underarmor/power armor pieces/mods etc and their corresponding plans where applicable and 'tick off' things off the list to keep track. 
---
Lmao WOW so entitled KID want to get a product he paid for smdh great game bethesda stuff like this make me sad for Fallout future!
---
For real though, this needs visibility. I wonder how many people this has happened to that just sadly accept it, and move on. Every single one of these situations needs to blow up on reddit/youtube/etc until Bethesda fucking learns, because they somehow STILL haven't.
---
This deserves more upvotes. My excavator right leg broke on me last night and I‚Äôm near 400 pounds over encumbered with tons of goodies to scrap. This place was a gold mine tonight. I can‚Äôt wait to get my ass back to my CAMP with all my goodies. 
---
Whitesprings often gets attacked by a Behemoth at one of the gates. The security is no match for it and the behemoth reached the other side of the Golfcourse before being taken down by me and someone else + the remaining security bots.
---
Took me a few weeks to get anything from Bethesda when my Power Armor Edition was missing. Someone finally reached to me after I made a thread on here and about a week or two later I finally got the issue resolved.
---
Gotta love that ending when you t bagged his ashes  
---
Not true. There are many perks and ways to mitigate melee damage. Try again bud. Dodgy(agility), blocker(strength), serendipity(luck), lone wanderer (I guess) blocking and better armor. With TSE your armor doesn't matter at all. You could have full dense assassin's sentinels armor and still get 2 shotted. It's broken. End of story. Stop defending that shit
---
That would actually make me boot the game up again lol.
---
I use a TSE Combat Shotgun. While the Queen is in the air, my gun is completely useless. When the Queen is on the ground...Fire away!
---
Those bastards remind me of the BlackOps Zombies crawlers. The nova gas exploding pricks...
---
Oh wow that is strange. In 76 sometimes it loads the tape but doesnt play the first time. Might be it I don't know. But to be honest be a bit happy about it since the songs get repetitive quick haha.
---
You look like best mates of on a wild adventure. 
---
No i havent played in ages 
---
What I have been noticing is that when someone in my group engages in PVP I get marked as in Combat for the guy too. It doesn't show it to me that I am in PVP with the guy he can just open fire on me as if I challenged him. Happened 3 time to me thus far with pacifist mode on and off.
---
OK, I'll look. I'm at Harper's Ferry now. I'll see if I can find out after work. 
---
Ahh, well I will pass. I use my enclave uniform and officer hat. If I could just find a good legendary 10mm smg that would go perfect with the theme. It would look like a typical villan or bad guy uniform and gun. Looks kind of like the "blasters" from A New Hope. 
---
Edit: Also, it's not just Canadian shipping from the gear store that's absurd. Shipping for the PA edition from the Bethesda website was 55 fucking dollars. 
---
Oh you are picking up those heavy useless things? good, go on market reddit page and ofer it there.
---
Yup.  There's usually a water purifier to swipe water from though lol
---
...and you can easily carry a full two brace of the damn things (4x BPPs, with two 2x shots, in my case) for less than what it'd take you to lug around a fully modded rifle of any variety. 
---
TTK for hordes/groups don't really matter to me much, honestly... It's all about yelling "YAAARRRRR! I'MMUTHATFUCKINBLACKBEARD!" whilst leaping onto things with the benefit of marsupial.
---
Looks down on the sub by throwing some 'shade their way... I'm sure they could handle knob with ease. smh
---
Shouldn't explosive favour high rate of fire/pellets. How does it work like this?
---
Had an almost similar experience. A bugged Wendigo that floated in the air spawned right beside me on the top of a cliff. I turned around and the first thing I saw was the face of the Wendigo. Then I discovered that he was bugged and I took it out of its misery with one shot.
---
I‚Äôm so sorry lol I love this game and I‚Äôd love for this issue to be fixed
---
If you apply a paint from the shop it shows as the atom symbol next to the armour in your inventory, not a fix but works for me until there is an update
---
The higher your charisma the cheaper stuff gets with traders (to a certain point)
---
Happy New Years Bubba!
---
Do what you want (unless its not shooting legendary monsters or walking around aimlessly). Fallout 3, NV and 4 were sandbox games filled with toys, 76 is just sand.
---
This company needs to fucking burn.
---
I made a camp up north wsst because it had a wood station and a cool looking jeep, so I wanted to build a house there, and as I get closer, I see a figure behind the other side of the vehicle. I wasn't sure what it was as it was a dark silhouette of some sort, and then as I got close it's eyes glowed and it's entire being became super bright and it's wings spread and it disappeared. It freaked the crap outta me.
---
This is the camp that I've had the longest and I've still not seen the Mothman since. I love creepy stuff like this. I used to spend hours in Back O Beyond searching for Bigfoot way back in the day.
---
There hasnt ever been any official response from Bethesday why they wont allow it.
---
Chopsticks!
---
My thoughts exactly, I intend to fracture fresh fissure sites in the earth with my load af speakers blasting John Denver across Appalachia lol.
---
Threaten to sue for that amount of money?
---
Pro tip: you can‚Äôt lose your workshop to a game crash if you don‚Äôt take one in the first place!
---
Pro tip: you can‚Äôt crash out of the server while launching a nuke if you don‚Äôt launch one in the first place. 
---
Pro tip: it‚Äôs nice down here in vault 96, where we play red dead 2 and wait for the game to become playable before we crack the door!
---
You have to go to the help.bethesda site and report them in a ticket
---
It is the popular opinion
---
&gt; and a stray bullet hits one of your turrets, or camp stove and I become wanted.  
---
Turn on pacifist mode.  
---
yeah, seriosuly.
---
&gt; As for servers, they said there will be private servers; but it will be through them.   
---
Do you happen to have a link to who/where this was said?
---
No, but applies ti gun bashing.
---
it's broken because assassin's/sentinel's rely on the server, not because tses deal more damage than they can mitigate. by the time the client receives the packet, you're already dead.
---
but that's an interesting point- that combo makes you invincible, why not ban it as well? and melee specced properly for low health/crit/sneak *can* oneshot.
---
That'll change.
---
Remove the explosive effect and let us craft different ammo types. It was possible in Fallout New Vegas and I would like to see the return of Incendiary, explosive and more ammo types.
---
Is that a two shot explosive harpoon gun? if so why does it have 3 explosions?
---
The ability to rename all weapons and armors too. Pleaseeeee..
---
&gt; buff automatic weapons AGAIN
---
Shall they just be removed from the game then? The reason this is asked for is because they are useless. It takes hundreds of bullets to do the same damage as a swing from a melee weapon for the minimum. Does that sound fixed to you? In real life would you rather I hit you with a bat or an axe once or fire hundreds of bullets at you? Bullet damage should be tied to calibre not fire rate. It doesn‚Äôt matter how many of the same calibre bullet I throw at you they‚Äôre all gonna hurt the same amount.
---
I have a purified water problem.   I usually get my 5 water and 10 acid from my deposit.
---
True. Main thing I was trying to say was we call Bethesda assholes, not the other way around. They already proved those of us that pre-ordered were.
---
I agree with most of these points. Especially adding NPCs. Again, I know that this is the point of Fallout 76, but I am just not interested or invested in most quests because I know everyone is dead. The only reason I am  doing it is for the XP.
---
I don't even bother reading what's on terminals anymore, I just click on every entry in case it opens a quest marker. 
---
I agree. They probably do think emotes are enough. If that's the case, then, it's kind of unfair that some of the emotes cost Atoms. 
---
I also believe this is an issue with holotapes. Some holotapes do not have subtitles and just say "radio drama plays" the entire time. 
---
Additionally, notes for people with lower vision. We should be able to convert notes to plain text instead of images, and the text for notes, subtitles, terminals, the pip boy, and the HUD should be scalable.
---
This isnt going to help...but you dont need the materials shown on the crafting screen when adding mods you purchased. That shows the cost if you did not have the mod. 
---
You simply add the mod and it works without needing the materials shown as long as you have the mod.
---
100% agree. I scrapped 2 x-01 jet packs that way. Mods shouldn‚Äôt have a material associated with them. 
---
Suck my cock bitch face. 
---
I don't mind that you post these, but I like discovering them, could you please spoiler the codes next time.
---
Funny, I looked at your post history and it looks like you buy duped stuff all the time.
---
is this melee damage reduction or better blocking ??
---
Max charisma hard bargain and grape mentats and it's 74
---
No it doesn't, they don't go on and it says you don't have what you need...
---
Your most recent posts is you trying to buy duped items.
---
I‚Äôve been ranting about this since I accidentally scraped calibrated shocks and jet packs I was holding for friends... they need to hot patch mods not to count as junk.
---
It should at least be a perk.
---
With the mass amount of duping, I wouldn't be trading or trying to trade with people. You also have the possible bug that people can steal you gear just by opening trade window.
---
I just desrroy their camp, usually are low level players
---
[It's the bare minimum and it's totally not cool, but...](https://i.imgur.com/k6JqmfL.jpg)
---
According to your post history you have mule characters... seems like you might be a duper.
---
It isn't. It would be quite boring if I would only be able to find higher leveled enemies in a small part of the map.
---
Yea the enclave takes 20% but they did train me 
---
It says that but it does not matter as you already had the mod. That cost is only if you only learned the plan and didnt have the mod. Same for all weapon and armor mods as well and been that way since day 1.
---
Yeah the only time you‚Äôll get a semblance of good pvp is lower level workshop defenses.
---
I sell the vendors drugs B)
---
Well, in the end duping a glitch, same as the weight glitch and it's up to Bethesda to fix it. In that sense it's not really 'hacking'. And i'm sure most dupers are just trying it out (cause of lack of other things to do?) or to give stuff to friends. Then you have collectors who just want all the stuff in the game.
---
I don't have a huge problem with those categories. But there are those who dupe to sell items for real $. I think that is decremental for the long term game development and should be dealt with quickly.
---
I‚Äôve seen him a couple of times far east of the map 
---
But it literally will not apply the mod, unless that's a bug for some people, I really can't add them without the listed materials....
---
Just continue with your main quest and you will eventually get there
---
According to your post history you were complaining about transfering things to your mule. Is that the pot calling the kettle black?
---
I want to see something like the 12.7mm pistol added. Canonically they were popular in the early years of the wasteland, not that Bethesda cares. Plus using 50 cal would be less effort to implement and have a justified reason for being more powerful like other ‚Äúdlc upgrades‚Äù. 
---
well bad for them u can look at items in detail and then see whats stands under their name, also u have the star rating on each weapon. if u get fooled welcome to the world. people in the wasteland would to try to scam u so its lorefriedly to xD
---
wait theres a story? does it help you level up faster? where does it start?
---
Theres really no other to way to say you are wrong. Everyone else will tell you the same. I have 404 hours in Fallout 76 so far.
---
Glowing Mass is Aid.  
---
Hardened Mass is Junk.
---
No I just said it was a nice video
---
Yeah, I had my camp there for a while. The missile turrets tag stuff and I go out in the world doing other things. Come back to me camp, run through the golf store and collect a bunch of legendaries.
---
Not really so - sometimes the complaints made make it very obvious they *maybe* logged in, and if they did they barely got out of the Vault, simply because the statements made are factually untrue.
---
Make food, then can it with any cans you have for far slower spoil rate. Drinks go into bottles, and use a cap which you get back later when you consume the drink.
---
I got them really early for defending the dirt track in the forest. Very random.
---
Mods do not require materials to apply, look at them as a one time use all in one kit
---
So why wont they go on? Now I am even more mad....
---
You have to wait until after he tells you about that astronomical overdue bill.
---
Then kill him.
---
And say "Keep the change, you filthy animal."
---
yeah you are right but thats a "low " i calculated.  
---
everything is added "additive multiplicative" what if the headshoot modifier is multilicative on the final value that with a 10 k or even higher TSE Dragon.  Did you guys use Tank killer ?
---
In Fo4 the Crit was added last and was multiplicative.  
---
While im at more Perks came to my mind Like Mr sandman ill do one calc with the all perks only additive which is the lowest and one how it was done in Fo4.  
---
( 10000 x 3.75 [Covert Op, Mister Sandman Perks] ) + (10000 x 2.72 [Better Criticals Perk + Crit Mutation] ) + ( 10000 x 2 ) = ( 37,5k + 27.5k + 20k ) =  85k damage!  
---
Fallout 4 ( 37,5k + 27.5k )x2 = 130k   
---
Even this wouldnt kill someone with full hp and you need adrenaline full ,bobllehead, revenant and a crit ready  the 1% reduction is for attacking/slapping ? and after that 90% reduction for like 100 resi?   
---
Wait a second, people actually use the little mods? I thought they were just dead weight &gt;&lt;
---
Serum only suppresses for an hour... you‚Äôll be able to tell us shortly 
---

---
Wow that was 19 days ago, you go get a life, and take the OP with you, the whiners room is over there. 
---
I had to stand in center of zone and literally Catch the nuke with my face. Ding! I think there was a smiley face painted on the warhead.
---
I have 6 sets :-)
---
I got something a bit different tonight. A few hours ago, I had to wait 10 minutes for the loot to load off corpses, which really isn't fun with the scorchbeast queen and hoping you don't get kicked or crash. Got my loot, joined another world, and there was another nuke at whitesprings, killed a few ghouls, was waiting several minutes for loot to generate, got my loot, then disconnected a few minutes later.
---
Haven't you seen the trailer? You're supposed to get rid of all that extra ammo by spinning a circle shooting wildly into the air while a sweet oldies song plays in the background.
---
Two üòâ
---
Want to become a bullet sponge? 
---
Serendipity. 
---
YOU CAN BUY COWS?! fo76 has just gone way up in my eyes &gt;&lt;
---
I don‚Äôt know but there is a major reduction to damage until you engage into PVP. But how the Mechanics Of the Formula work it almost impossible to 1 Shot someone.
---
Though there is a glitch to get u dps in ridiculous ranges. Which are so high that the negate and break the PVP Mechanics and allows one shot kills with out people in PVP.
---
So it‚Äôs come down to being and exploit and glitch people are doing. Have you send the dps on that shotgun in the pic because of the glitch?
---
When I first met a hermit crab, i got jumpscared by it, because it pushed me over an edge and almost killed me.
---
uh, no
---
i don't have turrets set, but it's a nice, convenient location for me. if you want to waste your time smashing my stuff then fine, but i'll just rebuild instantly and painlessly.
---
How about naming my barb-wired baseball bat "Lucille"? :P
---
I was trying to solo a launch on a non PA character and get stuck where you need to repair the reactor and fight robots. Wear hazmat and die from robots or wear armor and die from radiation.
---
I think I can pull it off with certain post 50 ‚Äúnon build‚Äù perks and a lot of Chems... or they could just make hazmat go over armor so I can play my character my way.
---
OK so let's play with the idea that that one pellet does the same amount of damage as all your normal pellets combined. If that one pellet misses you are losing half your damage. Which makes it almost inarguably worse than every other Two Shot weapon. Because every other weapon fires the second bullet at the same time, deals damage at the same time and gets benefits like sneak damage at the same time. None of the others, as far as I am aware, have a chance for the "second shot" to miss. Therefore bloodied or another type of damage modifier would serve shotguns better. 
---
You just ain‚Äôt banging enough of it dawg 
---
Do you regret your decision now?
---
I just enjoy and love my spear. Gets the job done for me.
---
Get near a bunch of mid/high lvl players and quietly say ‚Äúscortchbeast‚Äù, if it is working you will see a response.
---
Do you do custom paint jobs on gear?
---
Fastest way to level up is by being a fartslashing, cosmic clashing, extraterrestrial crashing little spaceman.
---
These are great! 
---
My wish list includes fusion cores being queued with lowest charge first. That way they drop out of the weight quicker. üòÇ
---
I definitely want the 9mm, I'd use that thing ALL the time.
---
He walks along the roads of Apalachia and you can often see him walk into workshops... If you hear a voice sort of like an Ent in LOTR it's him!
---
If you had a 3* TSE Dragon with increase reload speed, that would be pretty great
---
You can not only emote, but also message player to player.

Just got level 60, almost done all the soloable missions.. Looking to farm legendaries and just buggerise around I guess

---
Another issue with reloading black powder guns is sometimes it'll go through the entire reload animation but not actually reload. This might be caused by getting interrupted at the end without the stagger or any visible or audible ques.
---
It actually does have that. I bought it from a guy yesterday. Needlessly to say, it was pricy.
---
Fastest way to level in this game other than exploitation is to always join in on nuked sites. Particularly White Springs. All you have to do is shoot an enemy once and you get the full xp for the kill. Trail high level players around and shoot literally everything at least once. Let the high level players finish them off. Consider using weapons such as the Tesla rifle or flamer for tagging many enemies simultaneously. Depending on your current level and stability of server, you can level up 5-10 times in one whitesprings run.
---
We all know if we drop the weight cap on the stash box some weirdo is going to collect 25,000 pieces of every junk in the game and blow up Bethesda entire headquarters. 
---
Flechette harpoon is like a shotgun, just better in many ways.
---
It is more accurate, it has infinite ammo, it does 3 times more damage per shot.
---
My harpoon gun goes to 3k dmg per shot at low health. I eat exclusively only scorchbeast intestines sinse I got it.
---
Or 65,536 synth parts ...
---
He was already wanted and very slightly damaged. I did actually kill him in one shot.
---
Give it a few months after they patch duping and we'll see how pricey stuff gets! Gotta hodl all the weapons!
---
Really now. Didnt know that was a thing. Guess ill keep the armor in the stash untill they pay. Thanks for the heads up üëç
---
Maybe get some updates on those canvas bags, too?
---
I submitted a ticket day one when the link was posted for them and still have yet to here back.
---
After two weeks, I posted a new one under every single email I have (four, btw) and ***still*** have yet to hear back.
---
Ur pet do respawn while ur away from camp... 
---
Also ur pet seems to patrol the area where the C.A.M.P device is if hes gettin stuck try moving the device.
---
I find smashing the robots faces in in Watoga levels up quick and is satisfying (watch the frequently dropped legendaries, they blow up), mixed in with Monster Mash at the High School.... it's pretty quick
---
Most pay to win got removed from the game you actually now need the level requirements for horses and weapons.
---
I read a few people mention it, but no one has evidence. Up to you tho.
---
Man, I'm surprised they even responded.
---
At this point, I've sent them around five things about the canvas bag and I've yet to get a response from any single ticket.
---
Yes. We paint gear. We have the Nuka Cola paint for the T-51b and the BoS initiate for the T-60. Cant trade paints from the atomic store.
---
Great! thank you!
---
Thanks
---
The Knight and Soldier suits are both orange and grayish cream. The Officer Suit is black and kinda OD green.
---
I just found the plans last night for the Officer Suit, they were in the train car between Watoga Station and NAR (something), closer to NAR. I'd be glad to make you one of you were on PC. üòê
---
Me aswell, found my first one today fighting the Sentry Bots there.
---
Yeah i saw it and i dont question peps are oneclicking.
---
I will test it a soon as i can. 
---
Play the game.
---
I'm comparing your experience of fo76 to a shitty retail job. You can argue that almost any game ends up like that if you play it a few hundred hours.
---
Wish we had jukeboxes that play other music. I swear I remember a quest with jukeboxes that played different music from the camp one.
---
Also I know it's  not on top of the list but please buff the deathclaw. I know it's year of the scorchbeast but I want to feel mortal fear from being stalked by these majestic predators. 
---
Dae EA HITLER?
---
Yeah it‚Äôs hard to near Impossible One Shot somebody unless the decide to engage in PVP. Unless you do the damage Exploit Glitch.
---
Going through this exact issue right now, so I guess there‚Äôs still no solution?
---
&gt;According to your post history you were complaining about transfering things to your mule. Is that the pot calling the kettle black?
---
Are you seriously suggesting having a mule alt is the same as duping.
---
Even without that I died once in white springs and some lvl 20 stole all my junk. Fluxes titanium and over 100 of springs and screws. If I ever find him again I'll get a bounty if need to just for revenge. By the time I respawned it was gone
---
I sell outfits. 
---
Wait... turrets and traps with a tunnel system? You wouldnt by chance have played Fortnite Save the World before have you? No, not the crappy battle royale.
---
For some reason I can't find a list or the video I saw it in, but a LOT of Battlecry  (now Bethesda Austin) worked on SWG in some capacity. 
---
Which, explains most of the bugs in 76.
---
Passive mode did nothing, originally i was on passive mode but that only diminishes the damage you deal to them not the other way around
---
The Vault-Tec experiment would make it a non static grabbable 1 in 100 cell loads.
---
Look at the prices you dipstick. Atom's CAN be earned, but to actually buy them in some instances costs the same as a full priced DLC- and I'm not even going to bother mentioning the Christmas bullsit they pulled. Funny how microtransactions work fine, while the actual game is a joke. Bethesda has their priorities, and they aren't aimed where they should be.
---
Add me on ps4 NemoTouchedDaBut. Ill do it for free
---
This is so cute! A very nice painting!
---
putting a 3 second cooldown on both effect would be much better
---
Lil' kid: "Hello sir üôÇ" ... you: "NO!"  Hahahaha lmao picturing that
---
Still too op of you ask me. The game needs a better balance so other weapons/builds Will be more viable aswell
---
No I havent played fortnite (well maybe two games when the battle royale first came out). It was quite a nice setup, had a tunnel with a laser trip wire that set off flame traps down the tunnel, arc trap in the open bit and rocket turrets with a barred jail door that I could lock myself in and shoot through. Definatley over kill for what I was doing with it but it was fun to build. 
---
There is a bug where someone can steal your PA and/or pieces. Someone had their X01 stolen as they were fixing it. Until this is fixed, never repair it with randoms around. Person took his armour and logged off like a loser knowing he was taking someones PA ..
---
The grind in RDR Online is fun. Doing missions or PvP to level up. You get gold nuggets in the process. You can buy mostly anything you want. Though some things do cost quite a bit of gold as something to work towards. I personally have my character looking exactly as I want her to look and I'm only probably around level 20. You can get treasure maps from clearing out gang hideouts and bandit ambushes. You also get treasure maps every 5 levels. These give you dollars and a bunch of gold nuggets. I think they have done a really good job with their ways to make gold by simply leveling up and playing the game.

It's a jukebox not an old timey music box 
---
Did ya? Lol what a small world..
---
The thing i dont get isthe following.
---
You said with  1200 you did 12 dmg right?   
---
use your numbers just with 10k  instead of 1,2k just about 8.3 times as much which is around 100.
---
100dmg Did you crit,sneak or headshot him?  
---
if no add this tot the 100 dmg.  
---
if you did you are right
---
This sounds exactly like what happens in fortnite save the world, since most missions have you defending an objective, people will funnel the mobs through a tunnel exactly like this
---
This is adorable 
---
Actually they can, there are certain conditions that allow it .. someone had their X01 stolen .. there have been multiple reports of this happening ..
---
craft skeleton halloween costumes, get travel perk, sell to vendors on every cd
---
it happens to me multiple times... idk what it is
---
The main quest line starts in the overseer's camp, then flatwoods, then morgantown, then charleston, etc. Under the "data" tab you should have a main quest line, if none is active see which one you completed last and try to find the next step, should start the main quest again for you.

Beer bottles are safe thanks to them being used for molotov cocktails.

Read the other comment.

NemoTouchedDaBut lvl 110
---
What an interesting law, had no idea it existed. This is off topic but what if someone makes a game purposely playing against these ideas? Like the whole point is that it lacks this type of thing, because its am art experimental game. Does that mean you have to comply or can you argue against it because of the games focus?
---
No I was using a pump shotgun..it‚Äôs hard to read a head shot damage with it because the pellets spread.
---
We did with Gauss and other guns. Damage still average out to low Health point lost.
---
Ive had a couple of instances where either someone wants to trade or team up.. And for whatever reason I wanted to decline. But we dont have any real good option to say 'no thanks', so instead I just do the No emote quickly followed up by the Heart emote.
---
Oh cool. Yeah I didn't really plan it, it just kinda ended up like that :P
---
thanks mate, I just ignored that lol, I just thought it was a tutorial of some sort.
---
I agree with most the changes except perception increasing all ranged damage. I believe that damage should increase based on the stat it relates to (heavy weapons and shotguns for strength for example) 
---
Farming events with many spawns, f.e. uranium fever and also farming the golf club at whitesprings seems to be good. Also the watch the parade event gives instantly 600 exp\~. Fast travel kill the grafton monster and its done.
---
It starts as kind of a tutorial but only in the first few areas. When it takes you to Top of The World it stops being much of a tutorial and is more a story quest instead.
---
How is that an exploit? It's annoying but.... who cares 
---
Yeah. Lost T60 calibrated shocks and X-01 jetpack last night whilst making some CAMP shelves...    
---
       
---
Sucks.     
---
I'm blind and deaf
---
How do I communicate in virtually any game?
---
And you carry them on you at all times?
---
Might be fine if you only accept caps. Be careful on accepting items if they are duped they might be removed from the game at a later date. 
---
Yeah.. same thing happened to me.. was where the nuke went off.. no trophy
---
So heres my gripe with that, first off it was literally two shots from his weapon which makes pvp a total joke and secondly after the duel ended it shouldnt have continued to allow him to continue to troll my character by inflicting massive amounts of explosive damage when i put on passive mode and did not shoot back, i died about 6 or 7 times trying to get my loot and eventually gave up and left.  What is this so called pvp balancing bullshit and what does it matter when clearly there is a combination of mods that one shots you regardless of any amount of armor or health or perks you invest in? 
---
Im just saying in terms of pvp the only person that should die in one hit should be a player hit by a mini nuke, the battles should feel more intense then this garbage.
---
Cannibal + Carnivore mutation is what you are really looking for.
---
Lol fixing the cow if it breaks
---
He was level 5, poor sod, still feel bad, you should have heard his voice....
---
After my honest posts got downvoted I said to myself I'm going to go kill some low levels just because these idiots think Fallout PvP system is great compared to RDR open PvP. I got to 2 low levels and one of them was down, the other on the mic was like it's not letting me revive you. Poor low level victims of a broken game. I ran up and revived the low level and then disappeared. I can't even be a proper Raider. I'm too nice. I also don't shoot first in RDR Online. Even when I'm playing the outlaw and the Raider, I still can't be an asshole. I'm too considerate of other peoples experience.
---
You probably think man child love is a good thing too. Go away troll beast puta. 
---
You can write with letter signs in your camp. Workaround text chat...
---
It's the wheelbarrow/haybales under the Resources tab.  
---
You need the "Brahmin Pen" plan
---
I just click over using the d-pad. Nothing says thank you like accidentally vomiting instead.
---
Right now, pipe wps with 3 point licensed plumber perk (90% break slowly).
---
Reread original post, character is lvl 70 not x01 PA lvl.
---
&gt; Wait is he like legit a thing? Where can I find this half man, half mutant half bearpig  
---
You want to get the "Brahmin Pen" plan. Once you've learned it, in build-mode it is the wheelbarrow/haybales under Resources.  
---
Enjoy your moo :)

When I use mine, it shoots explosive bullets like a gun, explode, and still apply the freezing effects.

YES! I thought Rose was a cool idea but was became very annoyed with her once I realized how boring her radio-station was.
---
=D Sorry my brains stopped working im super tired you are right.
---
Ill give it a shoot in the coming days if something out of the lines happens ill let you know.

Have a good day

I played with a 45lvl guy the other night he was running around overweight with 100 (bad) legendaries, cause god forbid he sell one.... Some people are weird.

---
That is what happened to the friends in my party, they instantly died trying to get my loot for me by the same player that attacked me.
---
Yep it‚Äôs a known bug. I think the chance of getting the actual barn to unlock is very slim from what I have read 
---
Think a cap limit increase would be needed as well if this were to happen. 
---
How do you know it wasn't a girl? ü§ì Just waiting for you to fall in the trap
---
I farmed there tons from about 15 to 35. Haven't been back since because I have so much 308 ammo and all the hunting rifle mods. 
---
Sharp as a marble.
---
I'm level 54, and have only encountered the Wise Mothman.
---
I don't see the point of what you're saying... Once your stash is full it's full...
---
I believe that is dirt. I think its under extra. Go in that and hut remove all. 
---
Its been awhile since i was on character creation, but I'm like 90% sure that is a dirt setting. 
---
Agreed. Free fast-travel would undermine inventory management and mess up the game.
---
I have done, I line them up quick to take cool pictures with me lying in front of them seductivley etc :-)
---
Whomever is in charge of the Atomic Shop pricing index is a fucking asshole. 
---
It's stupid to have a jukebox play classical music. It would be better if it just played one shitty rock and roll song on repeat than classical. 
---
New music isat the bottom of my wish list. There's dozens of fallout themed playlists on YouTube etc that I could just listen to in the background. A radio host really would have made it seem less empty imo . 
---
They should have blue name tag for friendly creatures and give them the massive damage reduction that passive players get, as apposed to gray for passive creatures, 
---
lol dont need to be 80 to defeat it leveling over 50 is pointless coming from lv127 player. I quit til actual endgame content is released because janky skyrim dragon is boring and has no real challlenge to beat.
---
If you pick everything up you end up with way to much cloth, steel, copper ceramic, rubber... Its not great.
---
I thought the same but it's not, none of those were active 
---
Thanks. No idea how I didn‚Äôt see this before now.
---
Thanks no problem.. and I been there with being tired.
---
Awesome I would love to see your results.
---
It didnt matter myself and my friends were dying in passive mode, i figured id at least try  lmfao.
---
That's how many dollars Todd pays for his mop chop :-)
---
She's turning into a ghoul!
---
my son and I created an ALT character titled ‚Äúmule‚Äù. Just for this purpose. He logs on with the mule character and builds a stash box.  Then we team up and fast travel to the mule, pull everything out of the stash box box and give it to the mule.  Then I change characters to my new one and team up/fast travel to the mule and pull everything off.  Great way to give your New character a complete set of Raider PA (lvl 15) and some nice mod‚Äôd weapons early in the game
---
What
---
As someone who was definitely mooching at lower levels, I had no idea that it changed the Queen's health. Some may know and are being malicious, but I'd guess most are unaware
---
Some nasty man hadn't said No to him earlier when he said Hello had they?.... probably me :-)
---
I‚Äôm my experience gauss riffles are vastly underpowered compared to some other riffles it takes me like 5-6 shots to kill a lv 50 robot with a gauss rifle when I kill the same dude in like 2 shots with my handmade I think it may be a bug with them but I‚Äôm not sure 
---
That made me laugh a bit too much, ffs lol
---
Some of the items up for limited time are really cringeworthy, it is actually sad 
---
I disagree that we now need to restrict certain areas just because the community has decided it is the optimal place to farm.
---
I've seen people complain about how Whitesprings, an area that players go to at a low level, is constantly scaled super high or nuked which is a significant inconvenience to some players. 
---
So perhaps stop nuking Whitesprings 24/7? If you don't want to do that because you want to optimize your farm then don't blame other people for optimizing *their* farm. It's not a violation of the game rules to build a CAMP there, and people have been building CAMPS there long before it became Legendary Farm Central.
---
Eh, cry more. 
---
As bright as a rock
---
With the 800 3 outfit bundle, people were happy, few days later this is added (for 1 day for ungodly reasons) and I guess its back to over priced ugly items
---
D: OH NO! Don't hunt me plis! 
---
It‚Äôs helping you just don‚Äôt shoot at the shit shack and you‚Äôll be ok 
---
What the hell!!! So that's where my T-60 mods went!!! Now I'm just angry! 
---
It branches off and leads you to a ton of sidequests too. üëå
---
you'd think limited time shit would be the best looking stuff. but I guess thats a crazy thought. also it's like if it didnt take me 2 seconds to change if "new" things got added each day, I'd never of knew that existed, Like they don't even tell you lol. I just hope GOOD things get added in one day 
---
i wanna know why people are trying explosives in the first place, queens explosive resist is so damn high to begin with...
---
Lol, yes done that also, its very funny :-)
---
I know the one,  got stick down the side of that truck weeks ago and happened to see this guy whilst trying to free myself.  Took a screenshot but never uploaded it.  
---
I'm currently working on my camp in the same location. I'm trying to set up a little bar with a possibility of opening it up to a fight club if we can get enough interest to do some gentlemanly bare knuckle pvp. It's taking quite a bit of work  and is very much a work in progress but seeing someone else make something great with the same area I am is inspiring. 
---
The only people to care about who dupers are, are other duper‚Äôs who are looking for dupers.
---
True, alot of stuff is dumb in my opinion (tatoos mentioned on another post). There is, an yeah I could shut off the in game radio an boot up spotfy. Doesn't make the game any better. An they have something like that for the raider lady, but the lack of her voice lines really kills it.
---
Kinda how I feel about most of the game ATM. You got so much crap but it's spead to thin.
---
Seperenty and adamantion are faster since power armor 
---
Crabs wear armour. Just not the same kind as humans. Use Awareness to see the exact values. 
---
Fallout is pretty campy. I don't really see them adding anything not cartoony and goofy. I always dress pretty serious but some stuff I like when it's prewar clothes or something
---
Those creatures wear a miniva for armor. shoot at the exposed yet carapaced parts.
---
This.
---
1st encounter was in one of the elevated mansions in the south.  I had no idea a wendigo was there and was in a bathroom. Heard a weird noise, was hit once while my back was to the door, dead on the second hit. Had no idea what had hit me since I was dead before I could turn around but I thought it was just a ghoul and that my health had been low to begin with.  I creep back into the area but don't see anything and pick my stuff back up. Head up a flight of stairs to a bedroom, kill a couple ghouls, then am ambushed AGAIN! I kind of caught sight of it before I died but had no idea what it was. In creeping back for my stuff, I use VATS this time and it finds it through a wall and tells me it's a wendigo. I was able to grab my stuff but just BOLTED out of the mansion without trying to attack it.
---
Earlier this week, I was powering Monogah and was in the reactor section when a glowing wendigo appeared in a herd of ghouls. My heart leapt in my chest. I stabbed it a couple times but did hardly any damage so I ran, vaulting over railings to drop down to a lower level of the reactor area, managed to find the door to the office area, and had to use a terminal to enter the decontamination arches. I'm pressing the button to open the security door on the other side, turn to see if anything is behind me JUST as the wendigo enters the room with the arches. I turned and fled through the rest of the office and into the turbine hall, vault more railings, and see an EXIT sign. I frantically click on the  door, trying to calm my heart while I'm in the loading screen, and fast traveled to my CAMP for a nap while I walked away from my controller to babble to my husband about what just happened.
---
I've only otherwise seen scorchbeasts and they're more annoying than scary.
---
Are you positive they never got back to you? It seems really weird - I heard back after two weeks that my request had been approved!
---
Its easy to blame things on glitching but if you're running a nuke zone you can easily gain 4-7 levels depending on if you're running group, multiple xp boost items and perks. I'm on my 4th character now as I like specialised/varied builds. Even normal leveling/questing/materials hunting should be earning you 1+ a evening so if you've played since beta its hard not to be high level. Just be honest and say "I like the casual relaxed exploring type of game" rather than blame everything else on cheating. Even my new mule alt solo made 1-12 last Sunday afternoon and I only stopped because I wanted to go harvest materials to build a load of lever actions to try to learn more mods. 
---
Now thats fun levelling with minimal combat perks (lone wandered and action boy only) as you want to max carrying capability side... just another 21 or so levels to have my mule build sorted to where I want it... ;)
---
You known a lot about the trade menu, thanks for stealing my inventory you assholes! Hackers!
---
From the Main Entrance go upstairs to the left, take the first right past all the rooms with the Hand Scanner. Take the next staircase up and left and keep running until you see the blank wall with the Hand Scanner. 
---
Using the in house entrance also brings you through a Rad Shower if you need it. 
---
(At work but I'm pretty sure these directions are near enough).
---
Where'd you get it for. 10?
---
Damn, this deserves more than one like...Thank you, kindly.
---
She had it coming,  tbh.
---
Discord please.
---
Yeah, I don‚Äôt know if they will put it back in. We‚Äôll have to wait to see.
---
Whatever you first go into is what is places your point into. 
---
These shotguns desperately need to be addressed. It's ridiculous at this point.
---
When I'm able to drop nukes, I would deffinitely drop a nuke on that stupid house of mysteries with that stupid questline.
---
The perk point goes to the category you choose first, before browsing through the other card categories. If you choose luck as category but a charisma card,sou get the charisma card and a point in luck. 
---
Nope. I did a follow up ticket, recently. Same response.
---
‚ÄúWe currently do not have the tools to fix this issue.‚Äù
---
I plan to follow up ever 2-4 weeks til the issue is resolved.
---
its got udders,  its clearly a cow not a bull
---
No, I'm suggesting needing a mule is indicative of having duped items.
---
Well, 50 stims should make up for it though!
---
What are you talking about?
---
The Ripper is also in game - plan is available from a level 3 safe  in Harpers Ferry. If you're on PC I'm happy to show you the safe location if you want to farm it. I've got it a few times so shouldn't take long.
---
It's pretty silly, I only know it boosts the queen from posts here. I've only been on the server once when someone nuked Prime and as tempted as I was I stayed away (I was level 45 at the time). I looked on the map and saw loads of level 15-25s down there, there was even a level 8. How annoying for the players trying to beat it, although I got the pop up saying she had been defeated so I guess they won. Perhaps players under level 30 shouldn't contribute to her buff, or at least give players a warning when they enter the area that by doing so they increase the strength of enemies, maybe they wouldn't go in if they knew.
---
No they sell them in the science wing for 24,000
---
CD Keys just before Xmas, back to 12.99 now though..
---
Uhm?
---
I have had modds randomly disappear out of my stash box and inventory and I know I didn't select to scrap them
---
Reminds me of the liquid metal terminator cow in Tactics
---
http://fallout.wikia.com/wiki/B1000_(special_encounter)
---
Since when do gat lasers use fusion cores an dnot energy cells or mf cells?
---
I didn‚Äôt even know about them when one (twice my level) chased me halfway across the map. I made my last stand inside a train station and finally killed it after spending pretty much all my ammo and stimpacks. 
---
An intense experience, to say the least. Can never look at moth memes the same way again. 
---
Ok Good I've got loads of each, I'm keeping my gold as I want to get the deep pockets mod and I konw it takes 10 gold scrap per item to craft. 
---
I've got over 500lbs of bulked material in my stash I should start selling  lots of it now.    
---
They need a better way of announcing limited items. I havent been playing every day  but I can tell they have the randomest release times/dates of items and won't even announce anywhere that there is new products up for grabs (not even the main menu of 76, like come on) 
---
I completely agree, I cant believe they arent using their best swag and/or gear to make people really hungry for those "limited" time offers 
---
Alien-like creature floats, teleports and shoots lasers at you. I had him him try to kill me once southeast of Whitesprings.
---
The only junk you should bulk and store is acid, aluminum and lead. Acid bulking costs 10 acid and returns 15 when scrapped. Lead and Aluminum lower weight. All other junk weighs more bulked so don't bother unless your selling it. 
---
Plastic can be easily farmed in Morgantown or Watoga high schools. Grab all the golf balls and plastic pumpkins and the plastic in the cafeteria. Plenty of shotgun shells in morgantown, not sure about watoga since I haven't been there. Personally gotten over 150 plastic in a morgantown run. 
---
Get Hard bargain and travel agent early. Makes caps add up quick and makes cap runs cheaper. Try to friend people at vendors you haven't been to so you can fast travel for free or save new locations. 
---
If your playing with friends you only need 1 set of excavator armor and everyone can get credit for the excavator armor quest. Welch and blackwater mine are great places for lower level players to find black titanium. 
---
Hot take!
---
Winter holiday - we should be reasonable
---
New year - fuck it, yolo
---
That's why you need those calibrated shock mods equipped so you can fast travel and store the hardened mass without junk scraping
---
I understand if people are new to fighting the queen so we would like to educate them on that subject
---
Definitely working to white knight next. On stage one and repairs are still so expensive. Thanks! 
---
I dont know about you but I use a lot more hardened mass than I do freaking molotovs.
---
The horse looks insane haha
---
Hoping the next update fixes Class Freak not working on the Empath mutation. I have every mutation except for the vegetarian one, and I dont want to lose any good ones trying to get rid of empath.
---
I saw a level 5 in cranberry yesterday
---
What do you mean buy it? I have a sniper build so I use shadowed armor, upgrading to new ones as I level (now 46)
---
CAMPS should not be allowed anywhere in Whitesprings.  Only outside the fence/gates.
---
Indeed. And auto using mods as scrap while crafting too!
---
Oh they can fix it, your characters are a server saved.
---
So they have all the information about them.
---
They could easily see who is duping, and give them the ban hammer, and I hope they do. Perma Ban ALL the Dupers. It's their fault there is so much server instabilities on PC.
---
Its not fair to assume gender these days. Its up to the cow to decide
---
I have the level 45 version and it's not useless. Even without any perks for one handed weapons I use it as a backup weapon, or if I need extra carry weight +5 strength adds a few and gets me to my max carry weight if required.
---
You can also buy it in watoga station and Harper's ferry 
---
This is literally EVERY SINGLE COMPANY(over exaggerating of course) nowadays, we let this happen and slide with other companies so it will keep happening.
---
So bethesda still chooses to ignore New Vegas' ammo crafting abilities. 
---
keep this up the company may only live once. or atleast the team behind these damn pirces
---
Definitely. Strange in numbers and rank 3 class freak
---
this would require bethesda to admit obsidian handled fallout better
---
or just have weapons not stackable...
---
rather than all this limited time junk and ugly stuff. I can see if they sold Backpacks, Messager bags and other kinds of cosmetic bags for your character on a new cosmetic slot to wear for a price of like 150-250 each of different designs/enemy designed ones. they'd sell them so FAST but I guess 1 or two over priced sells are better -.-
---
It'll come at some point but realistically it would be more worth to just drop for other players.
---
I bet we won't even get 1/10th of what it costs to craft it.
---
I wish you good luck! I would play with you but I don‚Äôt t think you wanna play with a lvl 165 lol.
---
I had this same problem a few years ago. It took nearly a year to get sorted. The customer support for their store is just really really rubbish. Don't give up, though. The only reason my order was eventually sorted was because I kept sending in tickets and contacting them on social media. 
---
You look like Arthur Morgan by the way
---
Scrapping ammo to get lead and gun powder back so you could make the ammo you use? I have 4k .38 rounds I don't have the heart to drop. Knowing my luck ill get some 3 star legendary weapon that uses them right after I drop them.
---
I dont believe that workshop can make energy ammo or fusion cores. The fusion core workshop is by the Poseidon power plant 
---
I would rather go for acid nodes.. Then I can farm whatever ores I want.
---
Ultracite or lead.
---
A vengeful Mothman nearly killed me yesterday.
---
IRL, not in the game.
---
Worst jump scare ever!
---
Yeah, I feel you. Unfortunately, 20 something socialists will scream "REGULATION" and continue to purchase the shit we're being fed, instead of voting with their wallets. Nothing will change. 
---
I'm PS4, but thanks for the offer. I'll buff up my safecracking skills and have a go.
---
How could i be so blind
---
Still confused, makes no sense, not descriptions other than name. They thought this one up at the end of a meeting when they'd run out of  doughnuts.
---
A pure daft afterthought.
---
Nope there isn't a crashed alien ship but there is a crashed space station and you can find an Alien Blaster
---
#0.5: perk card loadouts
---
Or just make the Rad resistant perk give a 20-100% rad resistance.
---
If someone can build the small blue cooler, I'll pay them 1k caps to build it in my base for me
---
Completely agree. Dont sell clean outfits that can be found in the wasteland, give me stuff that will actually make me stand out while not making my wallet cry
---
add me via discord and we'll talk about it, I dont add people directly in game without discord because of how buggy the friends list is.
---
It's not voting with your wallets, it's going against this practice in general and not specific companies.
---
I do not want this company to burn, just practices like this.
---
The only advice I can offer is to keep away from locations on the Main Quest. These regularly get cleaned out. More out of the way places like the Silva Farmstead usually have loads of good junk.
---
Right but is it region locked?
---
You just got Bethesdad
---
It is literally impossible to steal gear in this game. You either spammed R and dropped it all or decided to sell it by accident or traded it and got screwed over or something. I was busy fighting the scorch queen and server hopping looking for the Charleston vendor and hunting bounties after being done with the queen. I have no time for glitches cause I actually want Fallout 76 to succeed. Lying is a fast way to get banned from reddit. Those guys aren't even on my friend's list even. If I was a duper, why the hell would I be selling 2 Two Shot Gatling guns, neither of which have any god tier rolls? 
---
&gt;is it supposed to work this way, that means only increasing precision using VATS but not increasing the number of usable perks ?
---
Yeah that's what it does. There's a screen in your pipboy that shows how many special points you have, you should have a +1 next to perception while wearing that armor.
---
All the gasmasks and stuff are -2 perception but they don't affect how many perk cards you can have equipped.
---
What's the point of not having a suppressor though? I thought in 4 and 76 you do MORE damage and recoil control with it than without?
---
If it was quad, you'd be in business
---
Inb4 "game play loop!"
---
the Database mod should simply work like the Awareness Perk.
---
EMEA is for UK and is the cheapest I think
---
There is also this. Usually a beta is for bug testing and trying different mechanics. Some people just couldn‚Äôt stop themselves from playing and they reached higher levels before the game even released. I hope Bethesda does some kind of overhaul so these people can make alts and relive the experience once more.
---
One of the best descriptions of these ridiculous confusing objects in the game, I'll feel OK now dumping or selling the whole lot of them and save a lot of weight.
---
A setup like that makes me irrationally angry....why is it not a prompt/selection like when you choose your card?
---
&gt; **Crop Plots** so we can grow crops on the roof or whatever. 
---
Maybe even plan-locked variants to grow the currently ungrowable plants... i.e. Silt Beans, Starlight Berries, etc.
---
Christ
---
maybe one day. one day
---
Sad but true 
---
These mods that go into junk? Are they the ones you get from scrapping items?
---
I scrap stuff, and it stays something in the corner...I dont know if it's a mod, or learning a recipe.
---
Also, and I dont want to sound like an idiot, but how do we use mods? I have two sitting in my inventory, but I cant equip them to anything 
---
Thanks !
---
What? I stab everything in face, and if they spot me, i just stand and crouch again. How can you get spoted on long range?
---
He didn't say. But he was actually a cool little guy. He only asked for a few things, listened and followed directions, expressed gratitude. Only caused me worry when I heard the beat of wings, told him to hide and he wanted to LOOK at the Scorchbeast circling overhead.
---
Based on comments/posts in this sub. Many ppl think every legendary on the game is duped

They live in the Mire, explore enough and you'll find one.

I'm level 60 and happy to do missions with people. Jameskenney33 on psn 
---
And why no Legendary Hunting Rifles?
---
Rather be safe than sorry 
---
You can have both, and it‚Äôs very much worth the difference when it‚Äôs the decider between a OHK or not.
---
I mean... I don‚Äôt, but um. I‚Äôm... pretty sure I know what your problem is there.
---
Super Mutants see me at an ungodly range, meanwhile Snallygasters are blind and might as well be numb throughout their body. 
---
There's also a fusion core generator at the basement of the ammo factory
---
No. I guess you have to be at, more or less, dead center of it
---
Artificial scarcity. They hope to increase the value by making it rarer and get you to pay it by creating a sense of urgency. I really don't like these kinds of marketing strategies. The intrinsic value should be enough.
---
That said, I wonder how a floating price shop would work? Price drops if an item is not selling and rises when it does automatically. Eventually you could get everything dirt cheap, but then everyone else probably has them too.
---
There should be an option for all types of ammo except ultracite I think I was able to pump put dozens of fusion cells that way
---
As far as I can tell it's just a premade list of mods on a normal hunting rifle.
---
Saving Private Ryan is one of the best, if not the best war movie of all time - change my mind 
---
Baseballs are a component for the Baseball grenades and the HalluciGen canisters are a component for the Phantom Device from the Order of Mysteries Questline. 
---
Assaultron Circuit Cards and Heads are also not auto-scrapped due to their use in crafting. 
---
Sadly as stated above ... not sure why Hardened Mass is not set to manually scrap.
---
I am beginning to think that the whole cosmetic shop is run by an A.I.
---
just get a hammer and destory his camp. after 3-4 "run" he will move it.
---
It was one step forward, two steps back.
---
They've always used fusion cores
---
I've only taken the workshop once, never fully explored it I didnt realize that was a generator down there. I remember passing by that once and just thought it was the same kind like in FO4 where only one fusion core would spawn 
---
This is how I play, but I do the weapon repairing thing.
---
Lone... plz.....the DCs and and crashes.....
---
I noticed that.......
---
they can get xp just spamm few molotow coctail into door and all ghoul will be tagged for xp in a flames.

Crazy. In fallout 4 and 76 at least.

Those goddamn synths

Max out all critical hits-related perks :

\- Covert operative  
---
\- Psychopath
---
\- Four leaf clover
---
\-  Grim Reaper sprint
---
\- Critical Savvy
---
\- Bloody Mess
---
That way, use a fast rifle in VATS to fill the critico-meter then use your most powerfull rifle (usually black powder) to deal an insane amount of damage.
---
76 got there a lot quicker then even Fallout 4, and that's a game you could argue was brutal too. Doesn't make it less shitty.
---
The higher up just want us to stop being 'difficult' about their broken mess.

Until someone comes by with a 2shot explosive shotgun and 1 shots it cause he can
---
I wouldn't dream of trying to!
---
Don't you dare.
---
I want to know how a level 1 reproach or someone with a stick hurts me at all through 200 % level 50 X01.... stupid :-)
---
So you can craft the ammo you need/want
---
I feel like some legendary effects should just not work in pvp but even without that there will still be one shots and people griping about op melee or stealth sniper builds. PvP in its entire essence needs a rework. 
---
However if you PvP you should know that one its started, it continues between those players until yall leave each other alone for some time. So repeated deaths is kinda on you.
---
No idea... really. I shoot them from halfway across Charleston and they just f***ing disappear and reappear RIGHT NEXT TO ME for some reason. I freak out every single time. I hate them. They're like giant mole rats.
---
I've definitely been one shot outside of pvp and it happens to be tse every time so
---
im yet to hear about the canvas bag replacement, sent in 2 tickets (one for me and one for me friend) and ive gotten no word about it at all
---
They had something like this in New Vegas
---
http://fallout.wikia.com/wiki/NCR_salvaged_power_armor
---
They ALLLLWAAYYSSSSS find me though. I haaaaaate them so much.
---
Omg I hate them. I literally have to get my partner to fight them lol. 
---
Many perk effectss are spreaded way too thin and just feel like they were created to fill in the void. food/drink, rad, disease and weight mitigation perks should be condensed to 2 cards each for efficiency and mitigation (ex weight : one card for carry weight, one card for overencumbrance movement/AP).
---
Handmade rifle and lever rifle. Love the accuracy and the handling of the lever rifle. I can't say anything about the damage, cause literally the first one I got was a instigating lever rifle which I saved til I had enough levels to use it. 
---
It is a a exploit that u can stack Damage way night then the PvP Mechanics. It can be done with any guns or melee weapon. 
---
So it‚Äôs just not TSE..it‚Äôs a Exploit and Glitch..
---
I actually like the level 50 black diamond.  Modded it with spikes and it does 145 dmg at medium swing.
---
Sick, I never play new Vegas that much but this would be cool to have in 76. 
---
Good read. 
---
I do like the david vs goliath stories. It has always been my favorite thing to hear how players get around things and use game mechanics in ways they are not meant to.  
---
It is good to hear that bag of dongs got what he deserved. There is pvp, then there is being a trashcan about it. Perhaps he will think twice about being so shitty about it.
---
Yea the PVP in this game isnt perfect but i still admire Bethesda for trying something different, i honestly dreaded the idea of a Rust clone or &lt;insert any survival game with PVP here&gt;. Games like Ark and H1Z1 always bothered me with the shoot on sight mentality. At least this way i dont have to worry about some dongus killing me over nothing. 
---
It is fun to play with this weird style of PVP though. The other day some rando lowbie came walking into my base. No mic, but kept hovering around me, teabagging and emoting. It was funny at first then got annoying. I puffed out my chest hoping he would take the bait and start something or accidently hit me while baitshooting. Nothing. 
---
Eventually i got the idea to lock my doors (i never have them locked cause of mats required). Just quick lvl 0 locks, no skill required but i knew if he picked it, it would mark him wanted.
---
After he figured out what happened he panicked a bit, and instead of fast traveling he took the bait and picked the lock. Bonked him in the head right there. Gave me a laugh.
---
Okay, you see why you'd think it would be 
---
Where can I find the plans for the letters?
---
And how overpriced are they exactly? 
---
Thanks. Used one of these to launch my first nuke, feels good. 
---
You can plant things in the wheelbarrow too. I put a couple carrots and a corn for my little Geronimoo....
---
I had the same problem a week ago was instakilled 3 times with no chance of returning fire the guys was only 20 lvls higher than me. Everybody was like I must have been bad at this game and told me that "they" can easily win pvp which doesnt add up when u get instakilled.
---
YYeaaaaaa.....So you need the Armorer Perk Card Lvl 3 I believe.
---
It is. Did you see the pic showing a 200k dps Shotgun.,we have pics of the glitch of Melee weapons to. It and Exploit and Glitch the cheaters have figured out. With the Exploit or glitch there is no way to be one shot without being in PVP or while in Pacifist mode that is a fact.
---
My partner is South African and  there are not many hair options or African characters which bugs her a little 
---
Why don‚Äôt the teeth auto scrap? I haven‚Äôt found a use for them in teeth form

Am i the only that doesn't feel in danger in this game??? And i am playing solo like 90% of the time.

I was also attacked by mothman when I encountered the hermit crab on th road in the mire: https://youtu.be/KAwpuuBWJGs
---
like the "water purifier" recipie that is already in the game, you mean ?
---
I didn't say it wasn't. I said you can see why people think that way cause it's always with those weapons. I never heard about the glitch/exploit til now
---
I lose mods to leather not steel so maybe that? 
---
Control light boxes, switches, cycling lights and turrets. Pretty much like in Fallout 4.

Someone had already worked on a third party companion app for Fallout 4.

Curious to see if this is possible with Fallout 76 i.e. they left the code in tact from Fallout 4.
---
The Marine helmet is actually pretty good for it like 2 cloth and 3 rubber and worth quite a bit
---
You want the answer to your question, and only the answer? Yes, 600 is the the limit.
---
You want to cry about it, when all of us playing since beta/launch had to contend with 400? Suck it up, buttercup, and learn to manage your shit. People gave you good advice, and your edit makes you sound like a dick. You'll get no sympathy or help that way.
---
You'd have found your answer, and loads of management help (that you don't want, apparently) a lot faster by searching on Google. 
---
Yeah we have people on this post talking about being killed like that with Melee weapons also. There was a pic showing a melee weapon hitting 700K dps with the glitch and exploit.
---
if you have the plan, it's easy to get violet flux if they nuke fissure prime. Every group of 2-5 trees has flash fern under it. But if you bought the mod, then you don't need mats
---
No, the little yellow rectangle boxes with a gear on top. You can use them on weapons and armor once . With a plan you learn the ability to craft it infinite times 
---
Can you play with people

From

NA

?

problem with that theory is betheda's AI isnt good enough to do things, nevermind create items

Fortnite's Battle Royale is sick fam what you smoking

That's so dumb.Then again,the game looks like an early access .They haven't even played their game past a certain point probably.
---
Moleminer gauntlets I believe. 
---
I'd just be happy if the boundary was a square or rectangle vs a circle :/. They give us no ROUND pieces to build with. Thats just sadistic.
---
It takes me a while to press the waving emote, so sometimes I just don't wave back because I feel like I've taken too long and the moment has passed. I always feel bad. &gt;!I do this irl too.!&lt;
---
You're right thank you for saving me a nuke elsewhere 
---
This sucks, I hope you find a resolution.
---
But to OP and everyone who is talking about legal action...
---
***Stop it.***
---
You are all giving OP false hope that this will end well.
---
The only thing a consumer with a product complaint can do is sue in small claims court, nothing else.  That's it.  There is no criminal case, no one is going to jail, no one is in trouble.  It's just a local Judge saying "You Win" especially seeing Bethesda will never send someone to a small claims court.
---
Large corporations are sued in small claims court 1000's of a times a day in the US and Canada. None of them show up and only some end up with summary judgment, which is the main reason WHY they are sued, people know this (that corporations will not show up), so they clog the courts with them hoping to get free money.  That's not this case here, just saying that's what you are competing with.  People vs. Large Corporation are usually dismissed for the simple reason that the Judge in the case can see things the plaintiff cannot like in this case:
---
1. Plaintiff did not buy said item directly from Bethesda. (this one right here is the biggie)
---
2. An email stating a replacement is not a breach of contract. 
---
3. A missed time frame is not a liable offence.
---
4. Judge will often advise plaintiff to try and settle the matter with more perseverance because they're ever going to pay.
---
Bethesda, if they did decide to show up or send a response could easily defend this with:
---
1. Plaintiff did not buy said item directly from Bethesda. (lots of legalese with this one) 
---
2. Replacement offers are dependent on supply, still working on this issue.
---
3. Plaintiff did not provide physical proof of purchase or possession. (valid or not)
---
4. Plaintiff did not respond to contacts. (valid or not)
---
5. Plaintiff did not adhere to or follow proper return procedures. (valid or not)
---
The last three, even if complete bullshit or outright lies would delay the proceedings and cause you to lose even more time and something companies do all the time to frustrate the process with just a letter.  They could also send along information for plaintiff to follow to get satisfaction of dispute which would cause plaintiff to restart the whole thing later.
---
Along with the Judge knowing how these things usually go...Case closed.
---
Small claims court is not automatic money.
---
In addition to all of that small claims court takes time, namely yours. You may not need a lawyer (still a good idea) so you can save money there, but everyone's time is worth something.  The final nail in the coffin is even if the Judge says "you win", Bethesda is not going to send you a check, so good luck getting a local sheriff out to one of Bethesda offices to go find someone to arrest. There is not a judge in the free world that would place a lien on Bethesda property over 200 bucks.
---
Taking a large corporation to court for a small amount will never end up as a positive in your favor, at absolute best, you get your money back, at worse, you've wasted countless hours, and created self stress and other concerns.
---
The best course of action is to be persistent. It sucks, it's not right yadda yadda but it's the best course.
---
One final note, the second you say "legal" in any direct conversation with a large business, that's when all conversations between the two parties will immediately stop. That's policy.
---
So lame, I thought you were suppose to actually go around to LOOK for this but you can find them with a google search LOL
---
It would've been ideal if Fallout 76 had mod support. It can be integrated in the Atom shop with the same currency. If this game had something like Homemaker or Spring Cleaning i could've easily spent 2000-3000 Atoms on it. Bethesda wants me to spend it on Santa costume... Ain't gonna happen.
---
Grrrr!
---
i think you're right but now i want animatronic alien turrets for my camp
---
That's why we deal with em in clown outfits :P

Guess they are suffering from  Coulrophobia :D

It allows text chat, map tracking (where you can mark locations to track them), and controls your Protectron vendor bot‚Äôs settings.
---
I just got a 2 star legendary level 50 boxing glove and put it in my stash for this very reason.   Unfortunately, this was after the challenge expired.
---
Yes its a bug, but the work around is to remove all the fusion cells from your inventory, then equip it,  Then pick up the ammo.  It only uses all your ammo the first time, then it works correctly.
---
This is very nice!
---
I have been rolling with some high level guys I've met here (I'm only level 56) and yesterday something nice happened. I was at the Pleasant Valley Station selling some stuff when I started hearing some gun shots and someone running. It was a level 14 guy fighting some level 20+ mole rats and having a hard time. After I helped him with it he invited me to team up, and I decided to go.
---
I have to say that helping him out in his quests was very fun and definitely a welcoming experience.
---
The game mechanics aren't explained to you, at all, so you can't blame people for not knowing things
---
I‚Äôm just glad spiders aren‚Äôt in the fucking game, though the bee things and the nasty fucking tics are close I don‚Äôt think I could handle it. 
---
If you're stealth, they're SUPER easy. Just pluck them with sneak crits!
---
If you want a pain in the ass. Glowing fucking molerats. Even with 17 agi they still see you and get alllll their friends to join in the games, tunneling under the world till they can just pop up and poke you :/.
---
It surprises me that more people aren't aware of this and other cheap tactics.
---
There's an entire area within the shop area of the hotel that has every crafting bench and a stash...you don't need to go to the station
---
thats true but like... you wanna be seen with that hair? seriously tho, I've played a lot of games that have microtrans actions in them and this games, so far is so bad. 
---
My ruling for shops like this is:
---
¬£1-¬£3 for basic ass items/skins
---
¬£4-¬£6 for a upgraded, new or unquie item
---
¬£7-¬£10MAX for a brand new item skin that adds, new sounds, animations, visuals, etc.
---
Like a Common, uquie, Legendary effect in the cosmetic store.
---
I've played lots of MOBAs and this is how skins work. Beth need to learn this. sooner than later
---
I got this last Sunday on PS4 on accident. I was just hoping being in the area when the nuke landed would prevent a disconnect. Was crouched on the maintenance side of Whitesprings. The blast came right at my face, dead, trophy. Respawned at the train station, disconnected. Server hopped but couldn't find the nuke. Good times.
---
No, but there is a way to search if a question has been asked already.
---
You know, if we could learn to build the mod from scrapping them, this wouldn't be a problem. 
---
But yes, mods being counted as junk when crafting is a very strange design choice. 
---
Beerhat challenge was already third time. I think you will use it soon.
---
Goddamnit. Now I hear the song.
---
ITS BED TIME
---
I would definitely recommend it in 76. At the very least, enemies seem to aggro more to a player with the loudest gun.
---
Did exact same +1
---
The only difference from a level 60 player to a level 300, is that the 300 played more time and maybe had more chance to get a good weapon for his build, but doesn't guarantee it at all. I am at level ~130 and only found one "decent" weapon for my build, 2S 50cal (without explosive) and managed to kill it the other day because a level 74 was taking huge chunks of her health with his whatever OP weapon (could see the explosive shots)
---
I agree with you in that the level 20-30s shouldn't scale her health though.
---
I'm on xbox one or we could definitely do this. Sorry mate. :(
---
Not sure how the servers work, but I play through VPN so that part works, not sure if gameplay is region dependant but I imagine to remove some language barriers it may be... nobody uses Mic hardly so I haven't heard any accents yet
---
I don't know How to word this but can we look at doing something about being 'skull-tricked'- for lack of a better discriptor- into losing caps over and over to the same person? Currently every time I respawn after being Pk'd the enemy can just kill me again regardless of me seeking revenge or not. 
---
I think this stems from if a team mate enters PvP the whole team is in PvP with the other team. Therefore a level 100 can just bean me level 85 all day 
---
Yes chameleon is sometimes awesome, but can be a challenge when try to aim through iron sights while hidden... Shadowed armor body parts and chest armor is nice when you can get, but as traders have random stuff to sell you need to be in luck to get those.
---
This is why I like fallout 76. Most of the players are very friendly and I've already made tons of friends while playing it ! ‚ò∫
---
I walked into the bed and breakfast place and heard some weird groaning that I assumed was a ghoul or scorched. Went upstairs and opened the first door to see a glowing wendigo of all things. It was my first encounter with one so I just closed the door and went back downstairs to take some chems first 
---
I fail to see how at the moment solely due to vender cap limits as well as a 25k limit on your player. Which many people are at, via dupes or just playing since beta.
---
Later on in game he kills you and steals your stuff...
---
Dupe it.
---
Bethesda be Bethesda
---
Seems logical to use them. They server lags anyway
---
Did they not see how people played FO4 and having rooms full of PA?
---
I'd like to be able to have mine on display. Got 9 sets, mostly complete 
---
The problem is that they leave their camp there when they are of doing other stuff, so their turrets are there stealing kills from people who are actually there while the camp owner isn't even there to get anything out of it.
---
Negative. This was triggered by the penitentiary... I was server hopping there. If you follow the highway (92 I think) west of the prison to the sign that says (speed limit 45) there will be one of many random spawns, one was a suitcase mostly buried in the middle of the road and it had a "Note" in it called "Note".
---
That's something only a synth would say
---
Of course I'm bitter about being shadowbanned for trying to help solve a vsync issue, of all things. It was definitely hidden, not ignored. Confirmed through other accounts, and others have shares similar stories.
---
Couldnt agree with you more, i laugh at it now but goddamn was it tragic for my friend after he lent me those 60 screws to craft it for him only for me to have to break the bad news to him after hahaha
---
Amusingly a friend of mine does that regularly and then gets me to claim it. :)
---
Yea but I've a problem with mods.
---
I'm a PS4 guy.
---
People get around 70 Atoms for free every day, you're suggesting a new addition to the Atom Shop take under 1 day of dailies to get for free?
---
hmmm sushi
---
The problem with pistols is the lack of any perk to negate enemy armor. Plus once you get a 2 shot explosive rifle, pistol damage seems puny in comparison. +60% rifle damage and +100% explosive damage, you can one shot most weaker enemy types with a handmade, and can one shot just about everything include a close up none-queen scorchbeast with a 2 shot explosive Dragon.
---
I think I crafted about 700 leather arms/legs trying to get deep pocketed before giving up.   I cannot get it.  I believe you need to learn the plan for chest before you can learn it from scrapping IMO.
---
A normal super sledge could still kill in 3 hits tho
---
I‚Äôve only caught then staring at me once and I‚Äôm level 44. The second time I walked into them without even noticing and they flew away, scaring the shit out of me 
---
They make many stealth changes, they have increased thirst and hunger a fair bit in increments and stopped robobrains dropping fusion cores, no mention in the "open" announcements/patch notes..
---
Actually, if you "read over his shoulder", it shows up on your Pipboy. So yes, you can both read terminals at the same time. 
---
but could you camp somewhere and wait for your killer? Can you attack your killer straight away like he would with you?
---
How is your killer marked when you have him closeby?
---
I never managed to start it so i cannot answer any of these questions.
---
There‚Äôs a cap limit????
---
Maybe they try to also make it desirable through the scarcity, no matter how ugly.
---
Somehow the pricing and catalogue feels like they're too careful in allocating resources to making the content. They make a skin here, an emote there and see if they sell. Trying to make you want what they're selling rather than trying to sell you everything you could want. Perhaps some marketing guru has told them this model will have a better profit ratio, even if general customer satisfaction is lower.
---
Dude, the game is as if 1950's America never left. No shit there won't be a bunch of African  stuff.
---
Assaultrons are so annoying in this game they have a shit ton of health and barely take any damage, and don‚Äôt even get me started on that stupid beam, it basically one shots you and by the time you come back to get your stuff the beam is charged up again and ready to kill you.
---
I was getting them from non legendary ghouls and mole miners
---
Man, what? I never had my camp disapeared, not single shit, in 300hours, why should it be prio fix? It is ok. Better than it was in Fo4, rust, fortnite (haha).
---
Mole rats are what they are and it is sooo awesome, the way they dig thru ground even if you are invisible on other side of map, they still find you. Weaker version of radscorpion. Why should they make opposum/fox from them?
---
Did not even read anything else, bcos you want them to waste time changing something thats is in "ok" state or actualy great.
---
I carry three on me at all times.  X-01 for Nuke runs, Excavator for when I am overweight, and T-51B for general fighting.
---
For the bag claim? I thought they were being sent out in January? 
---
Been saying this for a while now. EVERY OTHER WEAPON TYPE HAS ONE. My suggestion was to stick it on the armor pen or stagger perk so both semi and autos get the benefit 
---
&gt;I think it's safe to say you are the first person to find a Zetan corpse in the game!
---
In the first week of release I was jumping on top of things and found it. I'm certain there were plenty of others that found it before I did.
---
A bobby pin weighs more than a .50 round.......
---
I found some group of cabins (forgot the name of the location) with a glowing honey beast that I started fighting. Almost immediately four more glowing honey beasts swarm in and start fucking my shit up 
---
I miss renaming weapons too
---
&gt;stopped robobrains dropping fusion cores
---
They done this few patches ago. 
---
Thats the perfect phrase for this! I forgot that existed as a saying! thank you haha
---
Disconnecting I can kinda deal with when I'm on a team, but I've had a hit or miss history rejoining said team. Can't sync friends list or some other nonsense. 
---
But...THE issue I have most is the platform stairs giving me the "object is floating" message when trying to place objects on or around it. It's infuriating. For the first time yesterday I nearly tore my controller in half. I haven't that kind of rage over something so stupid since super ghouls and ghosts. I had this elegant design using minimal resources, but had to settle for an ugly alternative. Routing conduit. Which btw should allow me to place it ANYWHERE instead of 2 ft from the wall. Always having to use weird workarounds to get stuff to go where you want it. 
---
These items seem to be following the same idea as the social mobile app type games. Just release something for a limited time and/or at a ridiculous price and some people who have more money than sense will buy it because it will, in their eyes, command some respect for being rare and therefore somehow special.
---
It's such a crock of horseshit, but it seems to be working in those apps. I guess Bethesda's marketing people hope it will work here too.
---
I can only guess they are holding out on styles, items and skins that people ACTUALLY WANT so they have things to sell well into the future.
---
Hey, while you're at it, let's make welcome mats work again as the fast travel way point.
---
Rose is the best npc in the game.
---
I know, was giving examples of stuff they haven't told us about that I had noticed...Don't know why they do it and claim they being open?
---
I saw the Stalking Mothman and ran down the hill to a town. Of course it follows me. So I ran more into town. The one with the  nanny robot. It kept zooming up and crashing down closer, so I ran straight into a ground turret and Mothman vanished! I was dodging bullets, but I guess Mothman doesn't like turrets.
---
Relog fixed. Damage was as if I was unarmed 
---
whats with wendigo teeth? 
---
Annoying as can be.. would not be as bad if they appeared in FRONT of you.  Oh no, can't do that, they gotta get their free cheap hit in back of you and then run behind you again.  So I just immediately start backpeddling and shooting those stupid things.
---
45ish isn't half a bad level to give it a go.
---
It really depends on your weapons and specs going into the fight. I brought an automatic armor pen combat riffle, a tricked out gatling gun, and mirv frags for when the queen landed. I was running a screwed up commando-rifleman build with some points in heavy and maxed demo expert.
---
A lot of high level titans will join up because there's good loot to be had, so even if you're nowhere near optimally built, you might end up being carried anyway. Give it a run and have some fun.
---
How do you find the treasure maps themselves?
---
Definitely! Meeting this little guy made my night. Just before, some jerk killed me while I was working on my camp. I almost quit. Instead, I made note of the player's name. My husband will be happy to avenge my death.
---
 But moleminer teeth do auto scrap.
---
I'm kinda aware, it sits in the back of my head, but as a british, its my god given right to complain lmao. seriously tho I just dont want them to use this bs. because over Christmas they tried and it back fired so much it hurt them a lot
---
Sad part is its has become a sort of pay to win game, anyone who looks around enough can just buy god tier weapons/armor/mutations/heals. Thus my lvl300 character is effectively obsolete compared to a lvl50 that watched a 15minute youtube video.  
---
More than once I've been schooled due to exploits/workarounds because i was too busy playing the game rather than watching a streamer/ browsing reddit.
---
Idk why this bugged me so much but you don‚Äôt have steam in your sails lol . It‚Äôs called wind ....
---
That would be great idea though :D
---
&gt; Sure youll win by default but they will never pay
---
Then they get garnished. 
---
I reached level 52 I think on my first character with all the sneak, crit, luck type goodness and I coped with these monsters exactly as you describe. It's only now that I'm running around Charleston with a new character that I'm feeling the pain again.
---
Also yes, mole rats can go to hell.
---
i don't have a damn clue what I'm looking at here. 
---
If if decides it's a bull don't try and milk it.
---
Will add you now!
---
Oh no, its not the charge bean you should be afraid of.
---
This weapon is machine-gun firing glowy white circle thing of death.
---
Not afraid of that piddly charge laser at all when compared to this thing.
---
Assaultrons are annoying but manageable.  
---
Level 45 Assaultron Dominator with that weapon is *insane*!
---
Entrance to house üòÅ
---
Easy way in is to go down towards the security office keeping the coaster on your left. At the very end you will see a gap with raider tag . There's normally s trap or can chimes too. 
---
It would completely trivialize the materials that go into making the Ammo to the point they may as well just get rid of Ammo and give everyone magical unlimited Ammo, unless they hard nerfed the rate at which we get Ammo from kills, I wouldn't want this.
---
I store the Ammo I don't want on my mule, I've got over 30k of multiple Ammo types, if I were able to scrap them for even 1/3rd of what went into making them I'd get resources from Ammo faster than I spend them shooting.
---
The Ammo amounts we get have been specifically balanced around the idea that you wont be able to scrap them.
---
With that said, I would be fine with a Bulk option, with the Bulk Ammo being able to be sold to vendors (only because it's so easy to cap them anyway). 
---
My first and so far only fight with the flatwoods monster was super weird. He was shooting lasers while slowly becoming overheated or something. Then at like 40% hp he just dies.
---
Immediately the mr. Handy prize bot congratulates me on winning my prize and gave me his junk. I think I also got some effect from the flatwoods monster because I had a similar overheat tint and my attacks did a stacking bleed effect. What is actually supposed to happen with the flatwoods monster?!
---
That's true but in the long run, they would make more money working with the communit rather than "profits" they are seeing, because they did this over christmas, lots of people bought a 2k emote bundle (me too) and it failed to sell because LOADS of people (as well as me) claimed a refund from Bethesda for our atoms back resulting in no gain for them. 
---
I just want them to... Open their eyes to the commuinty, the Player base has been asking for lots of things since the "creation club" in FO4... Plus during christmas they made NICER STUFF in that than they did in 76! for cheapier! Just a fun thing that annoyed me... HMPH
---
Yeah you might be a bit too far ahead of me hahah
---
More about the cosmetic stuff
---
My friend for African American characters ??? 
---
Did not know that was an enter-able bldg!
---
Time to go commit die.
---
Thanks folks!
---
Hrm, time for me to nab that beerhat from Harpers Ferry then...
---
Get rid of Blocker, add the 3rd rank of Slugger instead. Get rid of adamantium skeleton, in power armor you dont take limb damage. Get rid of egghead mutation, you want as much strength as possible. Add 3 levels of blood mess, 3 in glow sight, and you want at least 3 in makeshift warrior. Adrenaline is also a great perk to have leveled high. 
---
But they did tell us about it.  Robobrains were using the Sentrybot loot table and they corrected it.  Robos were never supposed to drop fusion cores.
---
Rip oBLUterate. The BoS charged me a firstborn son. Not mine, but still...
---
First that's not griefing. If they repeatedly destroy your base after you rebuild, the sure.  But that's just raiders being lousy raiders.  
---
(I was joking)
---
think that sounded mroe harsh than it was lol but I agree. I understand why she'd like more stuff but they still need to "try" fit into the game. it's not like Fortnite or SMITE/LoL where you can threw in lots of fun colourful skins.... (LoL has some cool af skins tho, dont even play it). but yeah. got distracked
---
They are griefers, they're going base to base, even my newly found friend got his base destroyed
---
Because they did that before the backlash to those types of changes, which prompted them to be more open.
---
Soup works with carnivore at least for now, dunno if bgs plans to fix that or leave it.
---
So you can essentially still have a veggie farm, turn them into soup, eat and gain the bonuses. Raw veggies or veggie meals not soup, I think you still get the effect with no food benefit.
---
I'll have to try it out later with a cran cobbler and my carnivore character.
---
It really is so annoying ....
---
Carebear buys game with pvp , proceeds to cry about how game has pvp 
---
If you say you'll get back to me within 96 hours, and then  it's been 3 weeks and still nothing? Yea... You suck at your job.... 
---
You are my Hero!
---
I hope you like the smell of uranium in the morning.
---
Get marsupial and rain fire from the rooftops .
---
I thought level dictated size or is that just budget?
---
they told about the robobrain change for sure also giving the reason. Had lootable from sentry bots.
---
Yup, can‚Äôt have stealable armor hanging about all over the place now can we? 
---
That‚Äôs OUR wife now 
---
you're likely not using the blocker perk 
---
Did you ofer them vodka or psycho when they arrived to your house? Not? Ofcourse they were angry......
---
I'm praying they REALISE this isnt a F2P play and is actaully ¬£40ish! (¬£170 or Power Armour players) and they want money worth of cosmetics. I play SAO MD on my phone and it has a better system for buying currentcy than this game haha. its also f2p sooooooooooo (add a point here)  
---
Hopefully they'll start lowering prices before they release the "good" items everyone would like. and sort out the stores prices
---
Hold up. Mods get scrapped?! Glad I read this than!! Wtf
---
TSE weapons are still cooked. Why should a legendary modifier outclass or make entire build/perk setups meaningless?
---
Are you sure adamantium doesn't work with power armor? I googled but I found nothing
---
Try deleting the platform you're standing on in the picture and building from the door out towards the land.
---
That's a sweet outfit Willie's got on, wonder if it's available in game to wear.
---
Sorry, I must have missed that then...
---
Met mothman twice. Once alone and I didn't know what it is. It was dark and I just saw his glowing eyes. I shot at it and it disappeared. I was probably lucky :D Second time, I was already with friend and we were both around level 15. We managed to kill it without dying. I was surprised because people were saying they're hard to kill. It's pretty easy to dodge his attack.
---
yes I am. or around that. yep.  
---
After playing TONS of free to play games, you think me and others want to spend tons of money that is being sold for 20% - 40% of the actualy games price for a REALLY shit skin or cosmetic??  
---
if you agree with bethesda, please. take your bag of excuses and shut the door on your way out &lt;3
---
It disappears like instantly with a beeping noise
---
Have you tried blueprinting?
---
Note: blueprints seem to have a much lower budget than the entire base so you will need to blue print the place in sections if it is maxed out.
---
Try putting all of this on ONE foundation block if you are having trouble moving the base.
---
Ok cool lmk I wanted to use overdrive, blightsoup, and firecracker berry juice but didn't think it would work because of carnivore and also im not sure if  crit stacks.
---
Meant for vendor caps (so more than 200) sorry. 
---
Yea it's a mod but everyone only nukes whitesprings and I need it for the vault suit lining as well. I'm planning on nuking prime today prob in a few hours. Hopefully sbq doesn't disconnect me
---
Best bet is get an exploding weapon yourself and fight fire with fire 
---
Did you try swapping servers?
---
Are you trying to place it by "dropping" or "selecting"?
---
No TSE put guns on the same level as melee. Up until TSE guns where found Melee was always the overpowers build and to and extent still is. There is Melee builds that hit around 3k dps. I have serval TSE Weapons. I have the TSE Pump with all the perks you need and it only does 1100 dps base with other perks it can hit 1400.
---
TSE Weapons being overpowered is a myth started by bad Melee users in PVP with bad builds. Also supported by people that want all TSE weapons removed and deleted from the game. Because of duping. 
---
Snally‚Äôs seem to have a massive damage multiplier when taking hits to the head, almost always two-shot them with a basic hunting rifle. 
---
There's usually some good ghoul spawns happening at the firestation as well, which is a little green building I feel gets neglected by a lot of people. Go fire a nuke mirv into that one if you're feeling brave. At least you'll already be outside so you can get a headstart on outrunning the whitesprings gardeners. ;)
---
The risk was calculated but they don't teach math in the apocalypse
---
It's a shell of hardened metal armour, it shouldn't let anything so low level through just by common sense, perk my arse....
---
YES
---
Unfair - now I don‚Äôt get romance nor a shower :( 
---
Yeah having set prices before a trade would be great. Idk bout u. I've had people end the trade waiting for me to set a price. 
---
I'd probably sit around and preprice everything in my inventory
---
1 step forward, two steps back it seems 
---
I suppose it will work on your melee weapons as soon as you manage to put a silencer on one
---
Read the whole thread, feel bad for you and the mess that is being created here.  Without my backstory, I would advise you write a Chief Executive Complaint letter to Bethesda and ZeniMax  Some folks imagine CEO's know about all problems, trust me they don't.  In order to cut through all the layers of managers process/procedure compliance, go to the top.  Personally I have had multiple success this way.  So just dig their addresses out, it's on Google and write down the facts, dates etc.  It's the norm for them to have a dedicated troubleshooter to sort stuff like this out. Good luck whatever you decide to do.

Todd Howard  Currently serves as director and executive producer at¬†Bethesda

---
Done
---
Hey I have a black powder pistol with 50% armor piercing was going to drop it but if you'd like it it's yours. Lvl50 though...
---
Force quit.  Saves most of the base.
---
If guns need the TSE mod to be on the same level then the combat system needs rebalancing. Why should a guns user be confined to one mod to compete with melee (which also needs a fix)
---
Looks like you were wrong again since someone did respond... This post might have worked after all 
---
I've met a level 30 guy (I'm level 78)that said hello and I responded with "no" because I was minding my own business. He then proceeded to hit me my back with a single shot. I turned around and I killed him in one shot with my instigating lever action.
---
Wait for next patch and vending will come
---
It's just an effect of social media. Humans aren't meant to be **this** interconnected all of the time and the cracks are starting to show where people are finding ways to exploit the negative exernalities inherent in the technology.
---
He said, and goes back to browsing reddit. 
---
You could say the same thing about most armor. That's just how it be... Roaches bite hard 
---
I am not saying that its valid,  just theorizing why the current situation is what it is today.   I cannot imagine the game getting released with this limit other than "going to take more time to get that done."  So I give them benefit of the doubt and say they thought people would constantly upgrade on 1 set.
---
The TSE part of this post is irrelevant. PVP right now is unbalanced to the point that ANY half-decent build with ANY weapon of any level (cept maybe drill lol), legendary or not ... is gonna one-shot ya. 
---
It is LONG LASTING hair gel.
---
That I Total agree with. Guns need a base damage across the board. Some Melee weapons need a base damage increase.
---
I also believe the Demolitionist perk shouldn‚Äôt work with guns. Only should work on Explosive Weapons.
---
Overall pretty good build.  You went different for a few stats then I would have went with, but overall solid choices.
---
Few minor changes that I would make would be to go with 2 points in each Slugger, Expert Slugger, and Master Slugger.  You get 45% rather than 40% as the effect is additive.
---
I would get rid of Dodgy as it drains AP like crazy leaving no AP to do Power Attacks.  Replace it with Adrenaline.
---
I do hope you said "Say hello to my little friend" as you did so :-)
---
Sigh...  Even with the wonky PvP mechanics some people just should stay off multiplayer games.  
---
I think the issue is more along the line of server stability and amount of assets needed to be loaded. 
---
I really doubt they never considered it when initially deciding the proximity.
---
Going to go out on a limb and guess that Support has been a little busier over the past 4 to 5 weeks than they initially expected....
---
I'm currently 64, got full set of X-01 and 2SE Combat Shotgun and Handmade, but I'm far from nuking and taking down SBQ - I'm still got around 1/3 of the map undiscovered and many quests to do. I don't rush, play only solo, carefully looting every location I visit, killed few SBs solo (highest level 62), but didn't even visited Whitesprings :P (I was passing by the golf course at level 21 accidentally and 62 lvl ghouls, spawned by high level players, kicked my ass :)
---
I've only seen the mothman once,  and it teleported away before i could fully realize what it was.  üò≠
---
The Flatwoods creature and I are fairly acquainted though.  I'll never forget the first time seeing this enormous purple glow in the middle of the woods at night... and then all of the glowing purple creatures it took over.  So cool üò©üëå
---
Bad game. 
---
We mainly only accept caps. I mainly fouce on power armor and moding them. 
---
Wish that shit worked in real life... wind blows my hair for half a second and PUFF feels like I was in whitesprings during the nuke
---
You have to admit that three of the weeks since then have been American holiday weeks though...
---
Last time I saw the plan in Ghrams inventory it cost 9k caps...
---
You taught him an important lesson: Your parents will nurture you, everyone else's parents want you to die so their child survives.
---
There IS a good story in F76, but you have to invest time to hear it.
---
Hey Babkine, I have the same with upgrades for under-armor wear, when crafted with ballistic weave ... should have CHA 1, INT 1, LCK 1... anyway my perk stats are the same (if I wear or not) and I cannot add a unused perk card. Only in PIP Boy I saw the SPECIAL increase.
---
ye someone else said that (forgot that phrase existed) and I am too. the only thing I've ever really bought (other than a few camp things) is the northen lights T51b skin. I do believe it should of been around 700-800 Atoms not 1000 but it was a great step in the rigth direction and I actully love the skin cause i'm silly haha
---
hoping before new stuff comes out, prices change a bit
---
Blowing up someone's base is the fastest way to get a bounty. It's also a good way to get someone to attack you.
---
They are not got mine at level 100+ something
---
You know it was......
---
Make the switch inside and make the only other entrance a keypad door. What‚Äôs the issue? Not hackable. 
---
you can get legendaries easy in watoga, there are several legendary robots in the buckets around town, lol
---
but the best you get from the queen, and sometime normal SB's...
---
It was just a side effect of the dump that was dropped here. I didn't mean to break it.
---
There's a guaranteed spawn like 2 minutes north east of Watoga, just outside one of the sundew forests. 
---
Know your pain though, level 98 and only time I've ever seen Mothman was him teleporting away behind me. Only knew it was him due to his health bar at the top of the screen, apart from that nothing in roughly 200 hours. For how hyped up they were the Cryptids are massively underused. 
---
Yeah good point on the progression aspect.   I forgot about that.   Being able to combine hem into one card when you have all three though is a sensible solution.
---
I was told that the keypad doesnt work right, and that anyone can just pull the lever
---
I was a low level i think level 7 and i had a friend who was much higher and i spotted a black lump with red eyes and almost jumped out my skin just looking at it, i kept telling him theres something there and he finally looked and said it was mothman and we both ran over to kill it, dropped some alright loot
---
You had one job....
---
Or do try if it constents and you are both into it
---
If they didn't have a policy for a 30 day return window, I wouldn't have cared.  
---
But there's no way I could know if that 30 day policy would be waived because they're swamped. So I take it upon myself to return the product on my own dime (policy anyways) without having a response from support. 
---
To this day, the only avenue I've gotten a response from Bethesda is posting on the Fo76 reddit... Nearly a full month since first opening the ticket. 
---
I'm sorry but if you're swamped with people bitching about the canvas bag, free Atoms, or the game itself, those tickets need to go elsewhere so employees aren't sifting through bullshit. 
---
I did that when I seen the duo running around getting 1000 caps + bounties still 
---
Heck, Lvl 1 hunting rifle can one-shot when specced properly.
---
And then you find out &gt;!a raider cannibal became that very wendigo.!&lt; How fitting!
---
that little bastard. every time 
---
They need to patch in Legendary items in treasure maps, would make them so much better
---
Of course, I should've offered them some Vodka, and maybe a round of pool 
---
Even if you don't have turrets, maybe don't build *right* our the back door. Getting a bounty for clipping someone's roof with a stray bullet because it's right down the line of fire is annoying too.
---
I met my 1st mothman few days ago was just collecting wood and I turn around to it in my face needless to say i too screamed like a little girl. 
---
I‚Äôve always seen him in the highway that runs next to Harper‚Äôs Ferry
---
When I read of such idiots I'm really sad....
---
Are they a temporary one time use thing or can they be used forever or is there a coolsown period or something? Ive got a few but am unsure how they work
---
this is why I keep daisycutter of me
---
I can deal with some of the asset reuse from FO4 and its expansions, but hermit crabs feel like chucking something in for the sake of it.  They made sense in Far Harbor, they make zero sense in FO76. 
---
Yup, it‚Äôs so that if you get out of it, you won‚Äôt loose it by accident. 
---
It‚Äôs also a reason why the armor weighs 10lbs instead of 70+ lbs as it should. 
---
Never knew a brahmin pen/pet was a thing so I would just have assumed it was a spawn area and killed it.
---
I almost only eat brahmin and radstag since they give +20 carry weight and are easily farmable.
---
To be honest, that sounds like any game with tower defence involved. 
---
I nuke the queen at least 6 times a day. Prime nukes are really common
---
My encounter was over 2500.  I believe he was using an explosive .50 cal, but I quit so fast I didn‚Äôt get a look at him.
---
From a perspective of a level 160 player having some 200+ players in my friends I assure you that if the bounty for killing cows would be increased by to 500, then those would be killed more often.
---
Right now I just wait for someone to be rude to me so I can lay my daisycutter on their camp and make sure that I become hunted so I could have a nice bounty, nice PvP and a clear coscience.
---
What better way to communicate "pvp plz" than a 1500 cap bounty on your head? 
---
The one time I shot him was at night. It was this pitch black blob in the forest with 2 red globes I thought were lights off some technology of some kind. But they were it's eyes, staring at me from like 50 meters away. It jumped into the sky and disappeared. It must of realised that I was the one who would do the ass beating if it tried to dance with me.
---
Yeah I‚Äôve been camped just south of 96 for about a week. Last night he showed up for the second time. 
---
The first time my turrets started firing at him, so I went in guns blazing. But yesterday I tried approaching him without attacking. Unfortunately he still bugged out. 
---
They're consumables that give a bonus for 1 hour or 2 hours if you have the applicable perk card.
---
Very easy. Go to third person view, you could also extend third person distance while holding the mouse wheel button and moving the mouse. Then when you push to talk you can see the speaker icon next to your head.
---
I miss slugs. shotguns would be so much better with them back
---
Same. I hear one spawns at twin peaks but never seen one
---
do you know the % of armor penetration it does, and does it stack with Anti-Armor and Incisor? I know Anti-Armor + Incisor results in like 88.5%, so if it stacks with those it must bring it to over 90% ?
---
You can play in pacifist mode all the time and switch only when you find a bounty to chase on the map. It's not quick but it will prevent the issue you talk about in your original post.
---
The players who do get their issues addressed will feel a sense of pride and accomplishment!
---
I also have an irrational fear of moths! Yet for some reason I'm obsessed with mothman because of this game. I got a mothman museum t-shirt. 
---
Toxic players man  :(
---
Thanks man, i still havnt got my head around the game im just a lone wanderer at the mo XD
---
Hmmm... Wha.. Whos here?
---
    
---
 (Opens door)
---
NOPE THE FUCK OUT
---
I domt see how people find that fun, really :( it's just sad 
---
This is pretty spot on. I am sitting on over 200+ ballistic fiber because I still continue to pick up every ammo bag or military duct tape I see from Pre-50 programming. 
---
Sitting on 100+ Canned Dog Food - I have had Good Doggy since level 1 (It is the only End perk I use/equip). 
---
Many of the mentioned Quality of Life items mentioned are more for the "I don't want to worry about playing survival" crowd. 
---
Spoilage is easily managed.
---
2 good shots in the left and they hobble around. 
---
I'm EU time zone so I guess they don't often. Or at least I've had poor luck with servers
---
Pal, they ARE the armor. If it was realistic on that part, it would be dead by a.a. shot 1.
---
OK, so what about my explosive double barrel shotgun. It OHKs anyway because of the extra +10% damage to players (including myself)
---
Thank you for getting to that faster than I was able to 
---
If the servers are online, the support should be online. No exceptions.
---
Two things i would like to mention:
---
1. Only Weapon Repairs should be changed because there is no Perk to reduce repair costs, but armor and Power Armor repair costs can be reduced with white knight and power patcher respectively. This way normal armor costs bassicaly nothing to repair (1 of each item when i repair my Combat armor) and Power armor has a lot of durabilty on its own and with the Persk we have it can last very long so i think the repair costs are understandable there too.
---
2. There is an option for sorting after weight so that should be outlined more specifically. or Example have an option that show how much each item weighs and one that shows which bulk of items weighs more so notmally a Stimpack weighs 1 Pound and a Radaway 0,25 Pounds but Radaway would still be shown as lighter than stimpacks even if you have like 200 of them and only 3 stimpacks. The bulk opton shold show Radaway is heavier and show how much it weighs in total on its own. Then you could also add the functions of the inventory mod many people are already using (dont know the name) that can show the weights of different categories.
---
One of their press releases. Said we could join camps our togeather. That was before the games release.
---
Anyone who is wanted will die
---
 I think the problem might be your wife. You should consider a divorce.
---
NPCs are already in the game...
---
My one encounter with him... He was chill till he was about to die then he went nuts and scared the hell out of me.
---
I just want the ability to change my pip boy light color and to name our frames or have them labeled in some in the stash and as a bonus let us display stuff like those little models of sentry bots and what not
---
This game gives you a free outfit every 1-3 weeks from just playing the game, that's completely acceptable to me.
---
I would agree with your assessment of the prices if we weren't given so many free Atoms, but we are.
---
Offset any prices with the free Atoms you get and everything costs less than your suggested prices.
---
With that said, even if you insisted on buying the Atoms, you'd get 1100 Atoms for ¬£8, this "new" skin would use 72.72% of your purchased Atoms, or ¬£5.82 worth of Atoms, which is within your suggested prices, lol. So I'm glad this skins pricing is acceptable to you. :\^)
---
&gt; if you agree with bethesda, please. take your bag of excuses and shut the door on your way out &lt;3
---
No thanks, I'm allowed to not agree with you and still comment.
---
3. Just raise the carry weight instead of hiding it behind an item.
---
5. Increase other areas for overall density of enemies or make it so that it's worth the traveling around between close locations. I'd love to have a horde of like 15 pissed off Colonel Gutsy's using AP rounds. Good luck getting near that.
---
Basically what happened lol. I saw the thing, kinda went ‚Äúthe fuck...?‚Äù and made my way back downstairs. Thank god it somehow didn‚Äôt see me before I could take some Med-X
---
I wonder how many people just give up and never get a replacement or a refund. It's a nice tactic, only resolve issues for those that go public, screw everybody else. You save a lot of money that way and technically break no laws since only incompetence can be proven, not intent.
---
I keep nuking Watoga. Why? I don't know anymore, I really don't, but I'm just driven. 
---
The ‚ÄúNaked Sprint to Watoga For Handmade Plans‚Äù is all the rage among the lowbies these days.  
---
Where do I get that perk card? I'm lvl 85 and can't pick it. Do I have to increase my strenght?
---
considering that every platform the game is on allows you to text message another player, it's fine. 
---
No similar weapon perk but if you take Weapon Artisan (extra durability upon repair) and use the weapon degradation perks it makes a difference.
---
Master science unlocks at level 43 you have to select the card on your 43rd level. If you‚Äôre level 43 but have levels banked you won‚Äôt be able to unlock it until you pick a card for level 43
---
If they DID add the capital wasteland I would cry tears of joy.
---
assaultron head is used for a quest as well, just like the hallucigen canisters are
---
I pulled off a sneaky move and gathered a horde of super mutants. The melee ones came running up to a level 6 camp in cranberry and killed him in one hit, along with his camp XD
---
I would like to see perks that increase energy weapon damage and a overall increase in base energy weapon damage throughout the board. Energy weapons should have been the high powered hard hitting weapon to make up for the ballistic weapons being much more capable in stealth.
---
I meant to reference the blast zone in particular, as I‚Äôve most certainly witnessed folks PvP‚Äôing (and not infrequently). Obviously those are high-traffic areas that persist well after the team event finishes, which would make Pacifist mode useful to plenty. Added to that, I‚Äôve been shot at by a number of folks while ‚Äúout in the wild‚Äù and have also shot other players who whipped around corners unexpectedly‚Äîevery time (so far) these have been unintended interactions.
---
wat
---
Or go the other way and have more stealth mods for energy weapons! I totally agree. 
---
I'm honestly confused about your price part, and 
---
&gt; I've played lots of MOBAs and this is how skins work 
---
Not exactly sure what game you're thinking of. League of legends and their shit loads of "digital sales" (always having items at 50% off, isn't a sale, its just making you think you're saving money on digital goods), and maybe Overwatch not considering the lootbox bullshit lol.  
---
Thats just considering MOBAs, compare it to other Sandboxes or open worlds with MTX, and F76 falls pretty well into pricing standards.  
---
Look at Path of Exiles, Dota 2, CS-GO, Fortnite. There are others even. People are so entitled now, that paying for a $60 game, makes you believe all MTX should be super cheap. MTX Is simple, they don't offer content, they only add customization. If you find the price is too high, its pretty easy to not purchase them.
---
Almost.
---
I got side tracked in lewisburg. I managed to get a second power frame though.
---
I hope to go there today.
---
Maybe player vending will allow for preset prices from a vending machine or soemthing.
---
Very polite name for it, I would called it other way :P
---
Seems unlikely, but i'll take your advice under consideration.
---
Do all mods go to junk? 
---
I built the fertiliser thing thinking it was a renewable source of meat, kill moo moo, repair for new moo moo, but that was not the case.
---
&gt;not clean.
---
&gt;can somehow style your hair into whatever the heck that is.
---
why cant there just be some normal, cute hairstyles ;~;
---
Does Pacifist mode prevent that?
---
They are extremely lackluster. I gave my brother all my fusion cells and energy weapons because I just never use them and because of their low power I'll never use them. I'd change my mind if they made some energy weapons viable but as of right now I'll stick to my All Rise, handmade rifle and lever action rifle. 
---
It's only accessible through the menu, it's not an actual location. 
---
Under my base I put a stash box, bed, and armor &amp; weapon benches for weary travelers to use. I keep having to replace the bed because people shoot it?
---
It should be a location though. Remove the atom shop in the menu and make it a free fast travel location
---
(no messaging mechanism on PC)
---
Yep several freezes and kicked out a couple times as well in about an hr and a half time gave up last night. 
---
Ruptured canisters cant be used for phantom devices. Only intact ones. 
---
Same thing happens to me, I can use it with no issues anywhere but White Springs.
---
Yeah, it's in game. 
---
Well, if you read more of that article:
---

---
Bold is by me. Can you name any major game on the market right now or coming to market that you can play blind, with limited use of fine motor skills, having to perform multiple actions at once, no time dependency on controls, and with limited cognitive skills. Yeah, yeah, queue the Fortnite jokes...but seriously.  How can anyone be in compliance here?
---
Now before people jump on me, I 100% believe FO76 needs text chat...but I don't know if this is the best argument for "Why".
---
I would love it
---
After you plant them, you come back at a later time to harvest them. They are time based. Most of the time I log back in ,after awhile off the game, my plants are ready to harvest. 
---
I agree! I don't mind hunting for some things but beans are east as hell to plant in real life dammit! I placed my camp beside a firecap spawn spot just so I could harvest it regularly haha.
---
Do you have pacifist mode enabled? Make sure it's on and you won't have to worry as much in nuke zones. Also stay away from the cars in case they blow up. 
---
Oh damn that‚Äôs amazing. xD I love Mothman and think he‚Äôs adorable, but I‚Äôm not sure I wouldn‚Äôt have freaked out in the same situation. And I like moths.
---
My non duped 2 shot exploding handmaid - lev 45 and I found it while lev 17 - I love my gun.
---
Its 4:30am, I‚Äôm very tired, reading this made me bust up laughing. Glad I was able read this before bed
---
Capture a workshop or two that produces lead. Now you have lead being harvested while you‚Äôre farming for weights. 
---
I spam 95 headshots all day and never have an issue.  
---
Only if you don‚Äôt have any of the material the mod scraps for .. say you need 2 steel to repair your gun. If you don‚Äôt have the scrap steel , it will scrap a mod to get it . Idk the order of operations for scrap but mods seem to be the last resort scrap . Check the window that tells you where it is pulling mats from and if it says a mod you don‚Äôt want scrapped , take that mod out of stash or once and drop on ground until your done
---
I saw red-eyed Mothman while hikin on the mountains between mire and dat middle zone, doing a objective with my friend and it appeared on a rock. Shouted instantly to my friend :"RUN YOU HAVE TO SEE THIS" but zwoop it was gone instantly. Second time with this same friend he was walking some distance behind me and we had been huntin for mothman and collecting it's eggs but it was a no-show so we went about doing some sides and suddenly it popped behind my and i almost lost my hearing as my friend nearly shat himself and screamed at the chat and zwoop it was gone again. Damn swifty boi mothman, we gon find ya one day!
---
I fought a live one a couple of weeks ago.. I killed him while he was teleporting around, and he froze.. unfortunately, he became un-lootable.
---
I wondered the same thing, if he returned the broken helmet they would have probably had him setup with a new one by now
---
seems like his helmet simply doesnt light up? but everything else is fine?
---
so he wants a second one for free, keeps the first one that is hardly even broken to begin with? he essentially wants $150-$200 extra spent on him to replace a flashlight? lol
---
I think you're better off with a lv45 Blade of Bastet.
---
What is really surprising to me honestly more then anything about prices or the limited time is that people keep giving a shit, do you want to item? No? Then don't buy it. Don't like the atom shop? Then don't go there. Do you want the item? Well then use some of your thousands of free atoms.
---
Or Flatwoods gym
---
Or the VTU gym
---
I'm more mad about that lv15 Raider PA she gave me - when I should have gotten a full lv45 set from her.
---
That was the Flatwoods monster

Everytime I use a workbench or chemistry station etc. they request several attempts for use them. The same issue happens when I exit from repair/create function: a couple of times my character re-connects again with the workbench and I have to do other attempts to exit.   
---
it looks like the civil war era suit and tophat you can get these at the philippi battle cemetary (its the cemetery next to the butterfly on the map) inside the building there are display cases and it usually spawns in one of them
---
Seen it in Watoga station for sale (mod)
---
Id like to have them as follower, i mean why the heck not?
---
By the same logic Bleached dogwood would not auto-scrap as it's used for water filters... but sure enough, harvesting a bunch of it quickly turned into just plain 'ol wood when I scrapped "all junk" without assuming those would break down. 
---
And here I've been going to Lucky Hole mine with Excavator armor and walking out with 440 units of lead ore that coverts into 1100 units of lead (that's without Super Duper) All within about 10 minutes.
---
No, it is the ghost of disconnects present as they reverberate between ghosts of disconnects past and disconnects future.
---
This entire game is filled with lazy shit. 
---
Legendarys are such a joke in this game. 95% of the time it's trash and most of the time it's trash not even worth vendoring.
---
FYI: tatos, mutfruit, and corn are the ingredients for making adhesive.
---
I have a circle of 6 friends I made. We take turns nuking. It is better with friends
---
Honestly, shit needs to have a set atom price, not "This hairstyle is 400 atoms and this hairstyle is 800!" or "This pose is 150 and this pose is 600!" its like... no...
---
they pmuch slap a high 3 digit to 4 digit number on a item and say "job well done!"
---
Something to fix it is (like said before) set pricepoints
---
Hair costs 150 atoms each.
---
face paints cost 100 atoms.
---
camp items (depending on size) 
---
Small: 150 atoms, Med: 250, large: 350
---
Paints cost 200 atoms remodels cost 350.
---
Regular outfits cost 300, special costumes cost 450.
---
bundles (depending on how much shit is in it)
---
BOS Bundle: Bos flag, Elder coat and jumpsuit, bos armor and pa paints costing around 1000 atoms.
---
I wish I could fight him. In the entirety of my time playing I only saaw him once and it was in "Stalk then run away" mode.
---
Multiple ways to play this game are always welcome though. Bigger issue is capped vendors and such limited stash.
---
Never seen the mothman and im level 93
---
Are you a rifle build? Sniper with all the perks does mad damage to wendigos, especially from sneak. Heaps better than shotguns. 
---
That would be great. But I‚Äôd be happy with server stability üòî
---
At least it did t touch your wick. 
---
Maybe make INT increase energy weapon damage like STR does melee? Currently high INT is not very useful most of the time. Maybe even make energy weapons scale by weapon condition to counterbalance it.
---
The odds though in Diablo were way better of getting what you wanted.
---
Server lagging again.  Had it happen at times, sometimes if you place it again it will finally show up, but even then, not immediately.
---
get the logic behind it, im just wondering if its actually has a place.  hidden just a place to be able to always see it.
---
Energy weapons in 76 are just crap, don't hold a candle to ballistic weapons for damage and wear out stupid fast, strange for things with very few moving parts. 
---
#thirth
---
Have any more plans? I'd love to be able to make one. Can a level 23 farm them or am I too low?
---
Yes. Let me rename my guns dammit!
---
The skin has no impact on the game so that point is pretty useless, they can charge 100 bucks if they so want they STILL has no impact on the game. Just people being pissy and needing something to bitch about.
---
Horde events have placed me in some pretty weird places, but this one takes the cake. Awesome!
---
Fallout 76 has many many many problems, but failing to comply with a ridiculous and unconstitutional law is not one of them.
---
Same, twice. One benevolent and one hostile. Both were only level 1. I wanna see the big ones!
---
Only seen one twice so far. The first time it was watching me and flew away when I got close. The second time I walked into it without even seeing it and it flew away again and scared me 
---
Or you can scrap tesla rifles in hope of unlocking it. I have an extra plan for this mod on Xbox One.
---
As I said, I'm lvl 130. But thx for your reply, I have serious suspicious that this is a bug.
---
I would like to actually be able to put my brahmin in a pen. My CAMP brahmin apparently has the ability to walk through the fences we can currently build... since I have a problem with wolves in my CAMP area, the damn brahmin walks through the fence I built to protect it and gets mauled to death by glowing wolves before my turrets can do jack.
---
But I want my steak!

I changed my PS4 language to english, logged into the game so it downloaded some audio files that were missing. Then i changed the PS4 back to my language after that and it worked.
---
Because each round would have to sell for at least 1 cap each.  This would have made caps worthless-er than they already are.  Can't break it down because it would further solidify ballistic firearms as THE weapons to use since you could break down the other 12 calibers you collect to make your own ammo and never have to do hunt for materials unless you run special snowflake ammo like cryo cells.
---
The first (and thus far only) time I was involved in killing the queen someone started spamming plasma grenades on it about 3/4 the way through every time it landed. Me and my melee weapon were not amused.
---
You admit that you were too low to contribute yet stayed around. The guy obviously just wanted you to leave.
---
I hear ya just checking, some people bank a lot of levels before they decide their build. It seemed unlikely just thought I‚Äôd check.
---
Pvp would be a lot more palatable if it wasn't terrible and broken and something beyond a griefing mechanic.
---
There is absolutely nothing redeemable about pvp in fo76.
---
What outfit is that?
---
I thought Marine armor was essentially this? 
---
Looks like Sun Kissed has been nerfed too. I used to be able to regen rads pretty fast during the day with rank 1 of that perk. Now it barely moves.

---
lol
---
Emotes are enough and the game comes with subtitles.
---
Since I have Pacifist mode, these camps can be a quick stop to break down junk and such, or repair my weapon.  Turrets especially missile ones are a bit obnoxious but I'll just make the best and use the facilities every once in a while...
---
Yes, anyone who accesses a stash box can only access their own stash.
---
I don't like the radial menus for PC.  PC needs better mapping for certain things, because it's so awkward using a radial menu on mouse as you're moving around and stuff.  Is there a way to shortcut this stuff to specific keys?
---
That is one trashed out vault.
---
They could have us box/bulk it up like scrap. Maybe 100 rounds of the lower stuff is like 5 to 10 caps and 20 missles could be 10 to 20?
---
Not true I was killing glowing ghouls just like the rest of the high level guys maybe not 3 shoting them but killing allot of them tho with my melee build after like 5 hits 
---
Thank you !
---
I'll have to try that. I've been looting the silo gyms, thought I was doing pretty good lol
---
I find baseball bats really satisfying. Yet to find a legendary so I use a barbed oak one. I don't mind that it takes more swings than a super sledge, the gentle "thunk thunk" of the bat against a skull is therapeutic. For guns I use a marksmans sniper rifle, again nothing special but it'll do for now, until I find a better one.
---
Thnx for the info 
---
And thank you for placing a stash box where other players can reach it!  It's one of the first things I look for when I come across someone else's camp or workbench.
---
yea...1000+ wanted....how did that work out for ya?
---
1.) Turrets need to have more HP and smarter AI.
---
2.) There needs to plans for building upgraded versions of the walls, floors and roofs which have significantly more HP the higher the tier.  Reinforced walls, etc for maybe sightly more resources that act like a variant in the build menu.
---
3.) The player could have a Home Sweet Home buff while within the perimeter of their camp that increases their damage resistance and health regen. 
---
When you do, click really fast on the deposits, I get 4-8 on some and others 16-20 per.
---
That's a great idea omg
---
Any one remember that giant sloth from house of the dead 3 that thing made me scared of sloths forever I don‚Äôt even like fighting these things in fallout 76 
---
I'm pretty sure the monorail weights can't be picked up.
---
I just assumed stealth in this game wasnt really a thing. Sure, there are perks and items that make you harder to detect.. but it still doesn't feel quite right. 
---
There have been more than a handful of times where enemies detect me from several rooms away,  sometimes even on the other floor. Meanwhile other times I can come full force sprinting towards an enemy with my power armor and they dont notice me until I hit them. 
---
Maybe it's there, but it's broken? ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
Carnivore and soup you just don't get any hunger reduction, thirst and buffs still work.
---
The only cross-platform game that your Bethesda account has universal progress in is for Elder Scrolls Legends.
---
My go to game to compare the micro transaction and pricing model with is titan fall 2. Expensive as all living hell skins and mechs and free dlc 
---
I‚Äôm honestly starting to think it might be better to just let the duper‚Äôs destroy the economy . I‚Äôm not a fan of having to run around with my account name above my head . So if everything being worthless means I have less people trying to guess my password than it might be a good thing 
---
I just hop into them and scrap them.
---
Yes, it can be annoying but there are ways to fix it.
---
They could reopen vault 76 as the store lol
---
No need to contribute at whitesprings nuke,  high level players wouldn't be there if they couldn't handle it solo.  
---
It's actually in the high levels favour if there are more players asking regardless of their level since more people means more lot drops,  more loot drops means more chance players will drop unwanted legendaries (to high level for them anyway)  which is the point.  
---
I'd rather have a bunch of low levels there with me than a high level player since the high level could one-shot the ghouls meaning less XP and drops for me. 
---
So what
---
&gt;got a bit luckier
---
Increased your charisma huh?
---
Because you can, with not much to do in game you can at least destroy other players bases "for fun", I would understand it if you would get something out of it, resources for example, at least some junk but nothing, only the "joy" of destroying some other players base. Harassing people is seen as a fun thing to do for some people, in the real world, social media and in online games.
---
They have a stat dont they? Produces xx in x hours. I could be way off I'm not on the game atm to check but I think carrots are 17 hours, but that's fallout hours not ill hours. Its roughly a second for a minute, and a minute for an hour. So carrots should be ready to harvest every 17 minutes of irl time. Or whatever the production time is 1 hour in game = 1 minute irl.
---
I couldn't agree more. I'm happy to pay 500ish for a weapon skin if it added new audio or effects. But like you said 300 for normal skins for them is good
---
Thanks for the tip!
---
Idc
---
Yes you must harvest.
---
If you plan to use crops a lot I recommend getting green thumb perk card.  You get twice as much from each plant (including plants you find out in the world).  That means you can plant fewer and use the build budget for other things.
---
I saw a weird thing on a power pole once and then I watched 800 episodes of dragon ball 
---
that would be a no on both
---
Same. 
---
So who or what is Yahtzee and why should anybody care?
---
molerat teeth
---
On top of posidian  power plant they can spawn a Hazmat suit. It will help against radiation and stuff.
---
If your on Xbox and Message me I have an extra one I can give u.
---
Same. I got the cat paintings while the mister got the barn walls set.
---
You need mask only to protect from diseases, but it reduce your perception. So if you have disease cure, you dont need that mask.   Also if you need hazmat suit for hightly iradiated zones, you can get lvl 5 hazmat with +1000 rad protection on roof of poseidon powerplant in trailer.
---
I will look
---
Wherr did you find the mirelurk? My farming spot in the mire don't have it as a possible encounter.
---
Wait... what? Elder scrolls is cross platform?! Why the fuck isn't fallout then? Its the only thing that I actually hate about fallout76. I wanna play on my pc but my Mrs only has an xbox. I had to buy it on my inferior playing system to play with her.
---
I thought you couldn't get the shotgun mod by scrapping?
---
FYI, you cannot take things from other player's stash. What was showing up was your own stash. You robbed yourself 
---
What numbers?
---
Alas Observatory, seems currently another empty rather boring Fallout interior area full of annoying shotgun shell wasting blue Chinese mini bots.
---
Hazmat suits are all over. Look for them near high radiation. They'll often be in employee locker rooms in these facilities. 
---
Any waste disposal site marked as a location on the map should have one. 
---
1 you need to find the plans and 2 some weapons will only allow you to craft levels in 10 or 10,20 etc however some goes in 5s
---
You have to know the plans to be able to craft. If the option isn't available (doesn't appear at all) in the craft menu at a weapons bench, then you haven't learned the plan yet. 
---
Its mostly random, you can get one up your level even from fertile soil or whatever is named that event in flatwoods on level 1.
---
Journalists write what people want to read. And people love to watch the world burn.
---
It's all too easy in writing to portray anything how you want, and at the moment fo76 is the gaming worlds' little fire they love to sit and watch.
---
Honestly I have no idea. It all seems totally random to me.
---
Beer bottles, assaultron circut boards, deathclaw hands, etc. There's enough "protected" classes of scrap which you can ONLY scrap by specifically selecting them that it's shocking that hardened masses and mods don't make the list. 
---
This is what you signed up for
---
My deathclaw had a red bar and totally tried his best when a horde of lvl 50 radtoad killed it. Thr yao guai has a white bar and it's completely useless. My advice is to never pacify them.just tame them and send them to camp.
---
I never lock it up.  I spent time designing and building this thing.  I want people to see it!  Hell, I even put strobe lights in the cupolas to attract players.
---
i have the plans and am able to craft the weapons but i can‚Äôt craft higher levels. i can craft a level 5 pump but that‚Äôs as high as i can get
---
Salt is used in recipies.  There is one in particular I make quite often:  Vegetable Medley Soup.    Takes 1 tato,  1 carrot, 1 boiled water, 1 salt.
---
Gives some good buff, but restores a lot of food.   I have Veggy Mutation and so have habbit now of making 4-5 of these with 10-12 Blackberry juices and then heading out.
---
I started with 27 salt stock pile and now down to 3.   I have been grabbing every salt I can find.
---
For some strange reason I thought he Enclave base was the safest place, that was another bad idea
---
i have the plans yet the highest level i can craft for the pump is 5 and for the rifle it‚Äôs 10
---
there are a ton of people who enjoy trading on a very active unofficial marketplace, which has an accountability system. I've had a lot of good interactions with people and seen a lot of really cool bases I might not have been to otherwise. When I get a good weapon piece or armor that doesn't fit my build, I can find someone who can use it and get something I can use in return, which is especially nice when inventory space is tight. Trading in online games has been a thing for years and years, if you call me a dumbass because I recognize the effects duping has on that trading, I suggest you look in the mirror instead.
---
Best ones I‚Äôve seen so far but I‚Äôm no where near endgame. 
---
Level 7 guy is the REAL hero!!! 
---
&gt;  So you need to real careful when running low on steel
---
Yeah, always be sure you have at least 50 units of steel scrap in your inventory or stash before crafting anything even slightly metallic. It's just a good rule of thumb. 
---
I could definitely see it happening, especially after the shitshow it's been so far. They could potentially make tons of money off of Atoms.
---
You need a hazmat suit however you will not be able to wear armor and it so you will be extremely defenceless in radiation zones, personally I would recommend you don‚Äôt melee in them unless you have Power Armor that is resistant to radiation 
---
The first time I saw the mothman was after a event at a lighthouse near vault 76.  Got the reward took some photos and left it be. 
---
Then many many hours later me and my wife were walking through the toxic air region south of the map.
---
A horde is super mutants spotted us and unleashed hell. My wife engaged with her heavy sleg hammer were I gave covering fire with auto rifles and exsplosives.
---
Soon after the last super mutant fell I realise we were not alone. A angry mothman started attacking for no reason sadly had to put the old friend down.
---
Don't really know why it attacked but I did not want to kill it but I had to keep mysel and wife alive
---
R.I.P Mothman
---
It‚Äôs true. The same guys also designed MODUS speech patterns just to fuck with us. 
---
Those exploding hand maids are a nuisance! It's so hard to get good staff these days and then they blow up all over the place. A nightmare 
---
wait what?....hair styles?
---
Uhhh lol. I didn‚Äôt take from his stash....
---
Exactly, some of these "Quality of Life" requests are ... not really QoL but more I can't be bothered to learn how to play Fallout.
---
Not all guns can be crafted at the same interval of levels (5s, 10s, etc.) so you most likely will get more options once you hit level 20
---
I guess it‚Äôs a little surprising he didn‚Äôt put it at the top maybe he has hope for the game 
---
I lock my CAMP but make sure to have a stash/crafting bench of some sort outside along with some unlocked water purifiers for the passer-by
---
Do you have the gunsmith perk? Just a thought... maybe it has something to do with it. Also, you can't create the level 20 hunting rifle until you hit level 20.
---
That's the dumbest thing I've heard to date.
---
Your idea is beyond wrong because items we want in the game WILL BE PUT IN THERE. Existing items we loved in Fallout 4, 3, etc will be put into this store for us to buy.
---
So we NEED it fixed before items we want get released 
---
Budget maxed out; only 1 industrial filter 'stored' w 1% of budget in storage. No turrets (had 3)-disappeared. Placed ticket. Told to scrap all blueprints, bug is being addressed. Meanwhile, no news of fix in coming update. Can't move camp-tried- cannot place anywhere. Tried storing some items-60% of camp - watching stored budget. No change. Scrapped all but structure. No change. Very afraid to venture into other space if stuck with no camp ability...nearing lvl70 .   Me on pc, shiva_ri.  Any ideas anyone?  THIS is my source of true wasteland anxiety...not my use of chems.   
---
I haven't tried, (UK here too) but I haven't yet met anyone with a NA accent in my travels, lots of europeans and british players though.
---
So yeah I do think the servers are localised, but perhaps if you actively added a friend in another continent it should maybe let you join their server?
---
What did you mean by taking from his  unsecured storage
---
I got it by scrapping
---
Walk around. While doing so sing ‚ÄúMegasloth‚Äù to the tune of ‚ÄúBaby Shark‚Äù And you‚Äôll find one ezpz
---
I just mini nuke their camp or draw and or draw all the mobs upstairs
---
..
---
Oh snap pacify might be what I did. It has a white bar. It was my first time taming so I think I pacified before taming just to be safe haha. Didn't know it worked that way. Thanks!
---
Just do the 5 min quest?
---
As far as I know Pacifist mode works only one way - I can't hurt other players, but they can hurt me if they don't activate pacifist mode by themselves?
---
Sure, let's blame the devs, which probably didn't decide on that.
---
Oh okay. I saw that thing on the east side of the map once. It was kinda far off from me and just popped out of existence as I approached. 
---
I should be equipping super duper when I smelt and bulk? 
---
Good number that
---
For someone who doesn't play the game you sure care a lot about it
---
Hey neighbor! Love the fog and aesthetic in these parts. 
---
Ok how about a level 45 one.  150 caps 
---
No man you're not understanding. The extra pellet doesn't do the whole amount of extra damage, it's probably divided between all your pellets, i haven't had any problems dealing damage even when I don't get a full shot on. 
---
All two shot weapons can have the second shot miss, it's fired immediately and suffers the full effects of recoil. The m79 grenade launcher is the best example of this, the two shots wont land anywhere near each other unless you only fire like max 15 feet away
---
1) Id like a perk card load out. For example,  if I'm building a new camp, I could switch to a perk loadout  I previously set up with my most beneficial cards.  Nuke zone?  My card set up for that.  Gathering resources or plants?  Switch to that load out.  I mean we are all already doing this to some extent but wouldn't it be nice if we could take a few minutes and set up a few predetermined load outs of our perk cards? 
---
2) A blue and gold paint scheme for the power armor.  West Virginia University's colors. 
---
3) A cosmetic item exclusive for people from West Virginia.  
---
She reminds me of tiny Tina from borderlands
---
How did it affect shotgun guy though? 
---
I am surprised you were able to strike someone's camp due to the short range of the artillary and the large distance required between camps.
---
Had this happen to me with the slugger park, after an unknown amount of time it came back
---
Yeah, I find it hard to keep a balance.
---
I know there are so many problems people have with 76, but a lot of the things people find wrong with it, I haven't experienced and I have good experiences with it so I think theres good things.
---
i kind of assumed that since both weapons had a level 5 version of itself that it increased by 5 each time but you‚Äôre probably right. i may just have to wait until 20 to see. thank you 
---
Curator doubles Bobblehead and magazine times - 1 pt luck perk. 
---
Maybe that‚Äôs why we don‚Äôt see them often. The weather effects seem kinda rare to me. Maybe fog crawlers are tied to fog for spawns which is why they‚Äôre so seldom. 
---
He deserved it, shooting a player while they're using a terminal, crafting etc is not on. I sleep with one eye open since the time some dick killed me while I was napping in my own bed.
---
A stash is secured storage...obviously. Any other storage is unsecured. 
---
And then bam you from using their services 
---
Damn man, I didnt come back to check after a while. Im always down for the queen, im sick of whitesprings... I got 2 keycards with her name on them.
---
&gt;  inferior playing system
---
I have far less technical issues in the game on my day one xbox one than most PC players experience, just sayin. 
---
Dupers are as bad as Commies and thats saying something!!
---
Contribute to what exactly? I'm level 100 and I can solo everything south of a scorch queen. I prefer to nuke whitesprings when there are only low levels in the server. I message the ones that show up and tell them to enable pacisfist and use molotovs (I'll drop some if they dont have any) or just hit each enemy once then move to the next one. They get a hit on almost all the enemies, then I finish them off with a couple shots. Everyone gets xp and I'm guaranteed to loot every legendary. When a bunch of high levels are there it's a contest for legendaries. Everyone wants to use the big boy guns and they kill them before everyone else can get a shot on. 
---
i do have the gunsmith perk although it is only at rank 1. this character build revolves around auto weapons not the hunting rifle but that is useful information. thank you!
---
Ah yeah, but it seems like the perks in 4 you'd do more damage, but maybe because I have a sledgehammer that gives you +1 strength, double damage at full health, and 40% more power attack damage.
---
Most of the robots in watoga I usually 1 shot them
---
A good few people build in the lake bit in the middle of the map (New Gad)
---
Ive ran into the moth man on the ledge North East of the alpha launch site over looking the national radio array. I built a camp there and next login he was in a tree
---
Probably XP glitches 
---
Actually I may be remembering the shooting wrong. I'm primarily melee so I wouldn't be surprised if I approached it thinking what the hell is that, and it shot into the sky and disappeared without me attacking it or realising what it was until it shot up into the sky.
---
this is very correct anyone can access and panel and just open it without the code
---
Also check to see if Gunsmith is needed. I run around with level 5 Gunsmith so it's never an issue for me in crafting. I'm not sure what level you start needing it to craft higher level weapons. 
---
Don‚Äôt worry the pulowski shelters will actually work this time ;)
---
Hmm then I'll pray that Howard blesses me with rng
---
I was on the top floor of fort defiance and I got out of my power armour to repair it and I was suddenly rushed by a wendigo coming out of the lift. My brother just turned to me and said how did a wendigo get military access.
---
The game is totally functional and nobody is making you buy expensive skins. You're a complete shill you don't form your own opinions and thank god nobody will have to run into your sorry bitching ass on this game cause that might actually make this game suck
---
I wish we could re-enter it
---
His real level is most likely 10-20 or something, it's just someone who's left a macro doing the old disarm exploit, it's not impressive.
---
I'd just send this screenshot to Bethesda.
---
I'm beyond happy for you to disagree. It's a discussion. But I just don't enjoy fake excuses. I accept we gain atoms for free but my problem is, a existing outfit ingame can cost us, what, 300, sometimes to 600. (the ski outfits) a paint job for Power Armour costing us 1.8k is insane, I love the Northern lights paint set, it's unquie and added new sounds and light to the armour. Costing me 1k from random dailies. that 1k is perfect in my eyes.
---
The huge problem is, why is this hair 800? Others are 600, 250, we need set prices. I wouldn't mind is it was 300, I personally think 800 is closer to a new weapon skin.
---
I gain around 50-70 atoms a day (I normally don't do my dailies and just get them randomly from playing) but for people who do, I think something as simple as hair should be 150-350 depending on how the hair is, is it out going and adds more to a model, up it to 350 sure. Is it a bit basic? 200, is it a reused asset from an older game and costs us 600? Shoot me down. I don't think we should pay for existing items atm. I think atom store should be solely new things but still. That's a different topic
---
They‚Äôre fucking bullshit. You get to have a death beam (which doesn‚Äôt take them time to recharge and has a much longer use cycle), you make them highly capable in melee combat, you make them become invisible, AND you give them shit loads of armor or health or whatever the fuck. 
---
Besides the stay in the air and laugh at your dumb shot gunning ass batbois, fucking Assaultrons are such bullshit to fig...I mean encounter. 
---
I finished ‚ÄòMayor for a Day‚Äô as a lowly level 13. The Bog is my second home.
---
Melee build with any of the modded sledges makes short work of them too. 
---
This is not really desirable. Yes, some would slot the 3 Star and never look back; but, I only slot Lockpick usually and slot Expert and Master if I need them. 
---
Fake
---
He has brothers as well. 
---
A ghoul cannot detect me when I am right literally in his crouch, so yes, stealth exists.
---
Yep. Somehow the ghouls got into his base and destroyed his walls, I just walked past the level 3 locked door
---
There is no other storage.  Only stash.  You can place other stash boxes and make them look like what you want, like I have a dresser and a toolbox, but they are all the same secured stash. And when my friend accesses them, he sees his own stash. So yes, that was your personal stash you took from
---
My prediction was 6 months from release until it goes free. Seeing that i already found it 76% off in several places, i might be wrong. It could go free sooner than i thought.
---
If you‚Äôre on xbox ill buy it 
---
Dude that's what teams are for.  I'd be kinda disappointed if my teammate didn't get my back, especially against a higher level player.
---
Had to do a double take to realize that extra digit, god damn 1k+
---
Go to the c.a.m.p item itself and try to ‚Äúrepair all structures‚Äù perhaps it may fix the turrets and anything else which may have been destroyed and disappeared.
---
If you‚Äôre in my scorched earth event and you‚Äôre not level 50 me and my group are going to PK you through the slap damage for being a leech.
---
Chased a level 15 out the other day with a tse black powder rifle. 
---
Am I the only one who wonders what his level up screen must look like?
---
I love my pipe revolver. I would love a two shot with more crit damage üòÄ
---
Also. I would like the end of duping.
---
&gt; mods seem to be the last resort scrap
---
Mods are definitely ahead of bulk in the use order. 
---
It might go to Game Pass in the future, but it will be a very long time if it ever goes free to play.
---
Oh boy. So many cheaters think they aren't going to be banned. There is going to be so much bitching from cheaters just like on the last ban wave.
---
to improve the feel of the guns as well as kill enemies faster, if not more efficiently
---
Yes, the game is a buggy mess, but it's still a lot of fun in its current state. If they'd released a finished product I would have needed a Kleenex.  
---
We defend it because we enjoy it, we're still telling Bethesda that's it a fucking disgrace to charge people AAA money for an early access release.
---
Easy to do when you cheat....
---
I have my camp right next to that spawn. I can safely say that hermit crabs are pretty, uhm, docile. When i fast travel to my camp, i spawn about 5 feet next to the crab and it never attacks me or my camp. I let it live most of the time, but when it spawns as a legendary, it has to die. 
---
Except they give you a full suit of Armor as a reward long after you‚Äôd already have Armor. What do they expect you to do, throw everything else away?
---
I almost got rid of an explosive 3* lever-action and explosive laser gatling because I didn‚Äôt initially see the other stars on them.
---
there are 2 challenges in that require you to kill an alien. so they must be in the game or at least coming to the game
---
The amount of mods I've lost to this is nigh embarrassing at this point.
---
Duping wasnt fixed and probably wont be for a long time given many variants exist.
---
Refund from Amazon won't get you banned Amazon cause that's Amazon giving you back the money from Bethesda.  
---
Chargeback from Amazon will get you banned from Amazon cause that's your bank giving you back the money from Amazon.
---
I can confirm that this work-around indeed works. While it was a pain in the butt, I created a second character and at level four completed the Basic Training quest (with the help of a random nice guy who joined my team and provided assistance with the live fire exercise ). My low level guy gave my new team mate¬†the newly acquired Soldier's Certificate, then I logged out and back in with my quest-bugged main character, traveled to the helpful other player, and he gave me the newly acquired Soldier's Certificate. This immediately advance my questline and told me to go to the DMV. Be careful, though, I believe this only worked because my helpful new team mate had already completed Back to Basics but had not yet triggered the Recruitment Blues quest line. If he would have already had the Recruitment Blues quest line, then I think my handing my Soldier's Certificate would have bound it to him as a quest item. Hope this helps. 
---
Mods also count as junk when repair workshops with a stash built.... 
---
yay, i won that event... look i got some water and stims for it... let me go back to working on that weapon i was working on right before i got attacked... were are my mods... 
---
Not arguing that the xbox game build may or may not be less buggy with this game. But my xbox sure as hell is an inferior playing system compaired to my pc that cost over ¬£1000 more. Just sayin.
---
Damn. That is something. 
---
(Fyi, this might be breaking the witchhunting rule. Ive seen a few posts like this that arent calling for violence, but still get deleted) 
---
Stay away from PVP until the new servers fire up, I don't care for it myself, but it's a little one side indeed :-)
---
and i also wanna say "thanks" this is pretty epic way of putting things together
---
I had about 400-ish screws, and had to eventually get rid of a bunch for space. Raid places that have a lot of desk fans, typewriters and car/truck toys. I've also grabbed boxes of loose screws from mechanic garages/robot repair places... I k ow that wasn't the OP's question, but maybe itll help
---
With good gear and a proper buils level 50 is quite doable. 80 is just a little dumb level as a guide. Been killing the queen and launching my own nukes for queen kills since 45.
---
Oh I'll never try to argue that Xbox is better than PC. I'm simply saying that this particular game runs better on Xbox.
---
It even works for cooking! I believe it works with everything you cook/craft through workbenches.
---
Yep just lost about 5k worth.  Honestly this is by far the most frustrating thing I've encountered.  Why on earth is this even a thing?
---
People are assholes. Do you have to then find and tame a new one? I've decided to play around with taming since I actually found a dog. But if it's just going to be irresistible for griefers to shoot my pets, I may not bother. Is it possible to get them indoors and lock up to keep them safe?
---
Do you really need Assasins leather left leg like?
---
That's all they ever drop for me :-)
---
It seems like Legendary hunting rifles should be an easy fix. 
---
Why is this so difficult?
---
There has been plenty of posts about and I have seen this exact zetan posted before.
---
Also the Flatwoods Monster is zetan and have been  discussed a lot.
---
My first interaction I saw him watching me far off in the distance and said "hey fuck, whatcha lookin at?" while shooting him and proceed to get destroyed by him because he kept teleporting on ledges (I didn't have much ammo at the time and focused more on melee, those ledges were driving me crazy).
---
Nooo now we can‚Äôt bullshit each other about the story anymore and make funny inserts :)
---
Is that some kinda prompt or do I just have to stand behind him - also do my objectives also update or only do his then?
---
OMG the number of times I took aim. Then thought better of it. Did she die?
---
Yeah it's all kind of stupid. If you know the exact rules of flagging  you can use it to your advantage. And people do, and grief people with it. Unless you have an explosive weapon to one shot people, and the other person initiates it, then it's pointless.
---
As a lvl 92.... I'm more afraid of a wendigo than a scorchbeast. I know what a SB is gonna do and can pulverize it when it lands......Wendigos jump around me and melt my PA waaaaaaaay faster than SB do (am rifle + melee build)
---
Never played it myself, but that can work well if done correctly.   
---
People seem to overlook the fact that all future DLC (content packs) is free in F76, and its multiplayer, so server costs too. 
---
So slightly overpricing OPTIONAL cosmetic content, is expected.
---
Which paint did you put on it ? üßê
---
God damn haha
---
i was thinking this exact thing.  A companion app would make my life so much easier with this game.  
---
I just got a helmet FFS
---
Elder Scrolls *Legends*. It's a card game.
---
I just assumed all the helmets we're broken when I got mine. It came and only the light works and there's a wide open seam on one side. Rather than attempt to replace it from Best Buy, I didn't bother. I'm enjoying the game, and this will just be a display piece anyways...though it would be great it the sounds or voice module worked...
---
How do you check on status? 
---
I totally get what you're saying, and you aren't wrong. I just have such a mixed bag of feelings about this though.
---
I just don't really think you can really "play it like any other Fallout game." considering they took a huge chunk of what makes the series great out.. And usually when people hear about a mass multiplayer game its not unusual to think its something like an mmo. In reality it's just kind of a bland take of what Borderlands multiplayer style except with the occasional randos/griefers, large empty sections, a ton of glitches ( I know,  original comment right) and without the fun characters.
---
With that all said though, I do genuinely love the game but its definitely got a ton of flaws.
---
&gt;no drawbacks 
---
&gt;will instakill the shooter if fired at close range 
---
Pick one
---
Yeah, I‚Äôm not scared of them now that I know that I can 3 shot them with All Rise
---
Well no, they are cosmetic so you don't need any of it. If you like an item you buy it, if you dont like the price then don't buy it like with real life. If the price is not to your liking then don't make the purchase....
---
The prices are what they are, people are buying so the prices will stay, if people isn't buying the prices will drop. No post here will change that, only the numbers from the store. 
---
And the process are good because of the amount of free atoms you can get which is unlimited. Only other option is to remove all the free atoms and maybe lower the atom store prices a little. 
---
There is no need to bitch over this because if you don't like it don't use it...
---
A couple more tidbits:
---
1 - I built a commando build and gave up around level 30 and switched to riflemen because ammo consumption was a huge problem. I started with 5,000 rounds of .38 I had on another character. Now I'm level 75(ish) and considering switching back to commando because ammo is less of an issue with Ammo Smith and Super Duper perks. However, if you find a single shot Combat Rifle and switch it to the Tweaked Automatic Receiver it actually takes advantage of the Riflemen perks. You get full auto without needing Commando for buffs.
---
2 - There is a  terminal just to the right of the entrance to Fort Defiance that gives the plans for the BOS Recon Rifle. It's essentially a hunting rifle (craft at levels 10, 20, 30, 40, 50) kitted with all the goodies that's incredibly cheap to make. I've never compared but I think it uses the same number of screws to craft as the standard hunting rifle but has a suppressor, hardened receiver, upgraded barrel &amp; magazine and the recon scope. I make them for newbies all the time. 
---
Good luck!
---
Watcha doin down there buddy? ( Õ°¬∞ Õú ñ Õ°¬∞)
---
And to top it all off, you lose caps and junk when you die. That kind of punishment isn't even in some totally open PvP games, never mind games where the system is messed up and allows people invulnerability and the ability to block and hide on the map after killing someone.
---
Just did this quest last night. Was disappointing. Straight up fetch quest, and the "story" had no ending. 
---
I understand you're point. but I also have a view of Warframe. after about 2k hours in Warframe, which is Free, has graphcis and content = and more than most triple A games, I can spend around ¬£39, to get like 4k Plat, using of which I can get at least 15+ skins and cosmetic. In Fallout I can get about 4k Atoms for ¬£39. both are the same and equal. no fault. but those Atoms can get me around 2-8 items depending on what I buy (looking at you, power armour skins, 1.8k). Something that only adds a wick of paint to my item should I think be around 800 Atoms, depending on WHAT it adds. 1k I was happy to pay for the Northlights Paint. it added cosmetic to the Power armour, it added a sound (as small as it is). I do think Northen Lights should cost maybe less due to it being 1 Power Armour set but it's a lot cheapier than the white one and sugar bombs one.
---
when it comes to LoL etc, I dont play LoL fully, I'm not a huge fan (i played smite and HoTS) but I have played it and when I did, "sales" to trick me wasnt a thing. I could spend ¬£7 on a skin that added full new audio, New FX, New Model, New Voice lines &amp; new animations (to the character model, Walking etc) while in 76 I can spend ¬£13ish to get just a white paint job or ¬£7 to get a hair style.
---
Thats my biggest grape. (not including 600 atoms for existing assets)
---
As someone who has done years of work monitoring tickets for large companies, I will have to disagree with you.  This is a classic case of an escalated ticket that is difficult to deal with, coming in at a time with a high saturation of other tickets, and it's simply been overlooked.   
---
It's still not acceptable, but there is little to no chance that someone is intentionally ignoring it in hopes that they "get away with it".  
---
Check your cynicism at the door.
---
Duper and/or XP exploiter, probably a total knob :-)
---
Shouldn't be too hard to get a team on XB1. Usually 20 100+ players with (most likely) duped OP weapons show up and we take her down. You have a mic, right?
---
Stop making sense!
---
Blind nerd rage is the norm round these parts!
---
Thank you! I wasn't aware of this. 
---
Unless genuine, then respect (or Dev playing) :-)
---
Try fully power cycling your playstation. Hold the power button until it beeps twice, wait for it to power down completely, then unplug the cord from the back of the console. Wait 15 seconds, plug it back in, then power it back on. It's good to do this about some a week. Helps your console run smoothly. 
---
There should be a gas mask spawned at the Charleston Firestation. Also the Fire Breathers helmet given by the Responders quest line would offer that protection too.
---
That‚Äôs the problem. It keeps spawning new robots and the screen the freeze and game crash. It‚Äôs absolutely annoying ! 
---
They haven't taken anything out that makes Fallout game great what I know? 
---
The games isn't a mass multiplayer game though, you have at max about what, 20ish if even that players per server. Nothing about 76 would tell you it's an mmo in any way :P
---
If you remember, in previous BGS fallout titles out of game scenes, like the news caster at the beginning of fallout 4, or the ending slideshow in new Vegas, they were all in game locations. You could only access them with mods or command console, but they were all created in the game, and have in game cells. 
---
So I imagine it‚Äôs not impossible to find the atomic shop cell, but it‚Äôd be useless I‚Äôd wager. The shop itself is a menu interface.
---
Yeah the lag/hang in between scrapping or selling has gotten me too. 
---
Poor choices *everywhere*
---
Victory rolls can be super cute, too. Proof [1](http://hairstylecamp.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Victory-Rolls-hairstyles-form-1940s-1-min.jpg), [2](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-JhVgH5Jtefg/TrHTkLZcqHI/AAAAAAAAAYs/U1LjNAD9spU/s1600/linda-darnell-wearing-victory-rolls-in-plane.jpg), [3](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-_Av2NJjXTKM/TbwqbSgMEbI/AAAAAAAAANU/RagVIQpABH8/s1600/lipstick+and+curls+victory+rolls.jpg), and [4](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-k1RYq9Gzv6E/TvoeFCN3feI/AAAAAAAAC8Q/FnY-8ZZMXvA/s1600/ritarollcurls.jpg).
---
But they decided to add just...a roll. One huge roll, with no dangling hair. This bitch's hair looks like a damn swiss cake roll. Just give me *cute* 40s/50s authentic hairstyles, Bethesda.
---
That would be great! Thank you very much. 
---
THIS.
---
Like 50% of legendaries drop no legendaries and about 99.99% of 3 star legendaries dont drop 3 star loot
---
If you stand behind him, just off to one side, you should get the prompt to interact with it. Your objectives update, too. 
---
Yup, this. There was a level 20ish it there the other night with his dumpy platform camp and all is turrets as close to the windows as you could get. I was trying to help someone complete that pain in the butt what to kill golfer ghouls. There was a legendary and a glowing one in the mix that we didn't get credit for along with a couple golfers. 
---
I went outside. He was there, milling about. I gave him a thumbs down and said over voice maybe he didn't know because he's new that this is extremely rude, generally frowned upon and will get his base destroyed repeatedly by high levels who also find it obnoxious. So I shot all his turrets. He repaired them. I have him a thumbs down again and no way emote, assuming he didn't have voice. Guess he got the message or didn't have the mats to repair. My partner cleared my bounty and we resumed our quest.
---
Server hop the Watoga vendors. I think I got most of mine from watoga and maybe raiders. They sell eventually sometimes have to hop a few times. Harpers Ferry as well.
---
I run a nonPA char with heavy metal. Just some advice, youll never be as good as PA and you will need PA or hazmat for nukes no way around. Also the fat ghouls rad you up like crazy so might need to swap to PA for big hordes.
---
Im stuck with hazmat since my fav and best weapon is a 3* powerfist and cant use it with PA cause... reasons.
---
Aso, if you cant mod it to polished check vendor mods.
---
This same glitch happened to me with the responder quests. Seems to happen when the quest is continued from a terminal. Go back to whatever terminal you had to before and re-do what you did before you logged off. It will bring it all back.
---
Try mob bosses. They usually drop metal or combat armor. Mostly the higher level ones
---
Perception should NOT increase range damage, doesn‚Äôt make logical sense.  
---
The Benefits that adding strength make since, carry weight and more melee damage. Guns have better perks suited for out preforming melee. 
---
 You can get a total of 160% bonus damage, and fire two shots. 
---
Just server hop to find an event that has a legendary instead. It sucks that they keep "fixing"¬£ stuff that people enjoy doing, but maybe I can kind of understand that one. You are the mayor so they don't attack you. I kind of feel bad attacking them, which you should because they are there to protect AND serve. It feels like you're betraying them, for some part they might have on them, which is like a moral decision, in a game that doesn't have many.
---
Do you still get those misc missions? They stopped long ago for me, I get the skull marker but nothing else... assumed it was level related.
---
Those are HoliDAYs not HoliWEEKs.
---
Can we not act like businesses close down for weeks at a time?
---
Their own support page acknowledges responses are delayed in Nov and Dec and that responses could take up to 96 hours... When they go we'll beyond that without a response? Yea that's a problem I don't give a shot what time of year it is... 
---
Why are mods taken before bulk? I can have ten bulk steel in my stash, run out of steel scrap and instead of pulling from that bulk pool of 300, it'll scrap a mod in a heartbeat. I'm fairly sure uranium fever the event also loves eating mods when you repair the extractors without any warnings.
---
There is a huge reason because of the equal value of these items. Why should someone pay ¬£7 for a hairstyle. when someone else can pay ¬£7 for a whole new skin that adds new audio, FX, Animations, voicelines, etc.
---
Who cares if we get free atoms? The pricing of Atoms shouldnt change because of that lol.
---
Atoms to BUY should be a lot lower due to it being a Full paid game. its not free to play. They are acting like it is. you should either get 10k+ atoms for like ¬£40 vs getting like 4k. 4k can get you like 2 items at times. 5 depending on what you buy 
---
No. There's lots of them.
---
Shot a couple last night whilst farming t60 parts from the vendor there. Dropped legendaries for me, terrible ones, but still. what system you on ? 
---
I agree, deleted post because it was garbage, what was I thinking.
---
I like this person, give him Todd's wages....
---
Well that‚Äôs good to know
---
^i wont tell him hahahaha 
---
Energy weapons allready recieve a boost from the weapon Perk Card of its weapon type rifle/pistol/ heavy. Making perk cards for specific damage types would hurt energy weapon more than anything. Best thing they did was remove the energy/small arms skills imo.
---
Just a boost to base damage to make them more inline to ballistic counterparts and a massive bump to durability would fix everything.
---
/r/Relatable 
---
My camp has been there for weeks... still haven't encountered one
---
That is one thing I like about 76's storyline. Since Appalacia gets nuked to hell by us (therefore we never hear about appalacian survivors) we can have all these wacky fun things that don't break the lore (too much.)
---
In the tunnels buried under the highway? That's where I have mine currently, often go to kill the local Crab as I'm pretty sure they sometimes drop one of the rare weapons like the Lever Action or Handmade. 
---
Well said. 
---
"reconnect most recent server" feature would probably fix a lot of these issues. It probably never disappeared, it's just that you connected to a different server.
---
Depends on what part of war you concentrate on I guess. Enemy at the gates is brilliant too imo, it highlights sacrifice and attrocities of war etc. much more.
---
Letters from Iwo Jima is another brilliant one too.
---
There are plenty more if we just look at ww2 era that are also brilliant in their own rights so I don't think I'd be able to choose an absolute favourite, but Saving Private Ryan would definitely be one for my top 5 overall. 
---
In case your wondering power Smith's 3rd ability is just durability past 100%
---
Why not something similar to old world blues' robo-scorpion?
---
That was your own stuff you Burke :-)
---
I could use some easy xp to get some more cards.
---
I just imagine your character trying to make a shelf, and deciding to shred a jetpack into steel scrap and saying "yes, this is fine"
---
i actually ran a rifleman build since the beginning of my last characters lifespan (who is now level 111), so i kind of just wanted to change it up a bit,  i know how fun auto weapons can be while also packing a punch so i thought i‚Äôd try that, i‚Äôm sure i‚Äôll eventually change it up to semi-auto due to the ammo consumption. also, i did not know about that recon rifle, i will have to look into that
---
The downside is that without pacify,they could be targeted by turrets or attack friends. It's far from a well implemented feature and you might have to compromise.
---
And here I was expecting Evan to come up...
---
If you had a real life you would not be on this sub crying because people don't like some aspects of FO76, talk about classic fanboyism. Don't bother getting a life, it would be wasted on you.
---
Are you saying this since duping keep hackers busy? I'd rather they fux both issues if possible. 
---
Time will tell :P
---
I met someone who was farming for steel last night, I dropped him 500 after realizing that I had 1000. went back to my work bench after killing the queen twice to craft ammo and ran out of steel. 
---
you can never have enough but you always seem low on supply.
---
Wish my first and only Mothman encounter was this good! I found mine on one of those cryptid hunter quests, spent most of the fight hiding behind a tree, haha.
---
may i have it?

RemindMe! 6 Months

Tried using it with 4 but seemed pretty pointless, but it would be much more efficient in 76 plus I've gone from an iPhone SE to Huawei P20 since so screen size is much more practical for me. 
---
They are just bills. At least when you see the 3d version of it. That's why they scrap to cloth(?) They would have to change the 3d model and the scrapping system for that item to make it work.
---
While I like your suggestion, I doubt it would happen.

Can confirm power Smith's 323rd ability is extra durabillity past 100% not before so it's just not as good.
---
Not to mention those bodies have individual drops so it's not like you lose anything but time waiting for someone to spam the Pickup key for half a second.
---
And not even any pictures to cycle through to get a good look at it. I'm not a girl but I take pride in how fashionable my in game gal looks. Regret getting this hairstyle. And regret how every other female toon seems to be sporting red hair.
---
Damn posers! 
---
The 2 Grafton vendors also randomly sell the BOS combat armor mods
---
Think it appears when you pick up the raw stuff...
---
Ack! Yup. That would be a problem. 
---
Plot twist... His calibrated shocks were in inventory prior to this post...
---
Any time I've been playing over the last week, there are rarely 3-4 other people on the server.
---
Wendigo's don't scare me so much now I've seen groups of about 4 of them fighting the Whitesprings sentry bots a few times... the first time I saw one near the space station as a level 12 I shat so many bricks though.
---
Almost same experience with me man. I was running with my level 50ish freind and I was about 16 at the time. Going north up the road from the overseers camp past the gorge junkyard, till you hit the next map marker then make a right and found some train cars, one had a military logo so I went into stealth and tried to find a door. I found two red eyes staring at me from down the tracks(when you make the right go forward some till you hit tracks then go to your left) I quickly went into vats and saw F****** moth man, i tried to get my freind to attack but he just went on so i had to leave it. :(
---
Fast forward to about 2-3 days after that i went over there again during day and nothing was there(lucky spawn?) (It was also shaped just like a tunnel at night. Still try to get him to spawn there (level 41 now
---
They have a kind of stupid system where some quest rewards scale to your level, so it's more rewarding if you don't do a lot of quests until you reach level 50./ Personally I think those quests should be repeatable so people can get the high level version, or have a crafting option to upgrade it to the max level. I personally didn't do most of those quests until level 50+ so I could get the good items. Some people did them at a low level and regret it as they got the item at level 15 or 25 etc. rather than 50.

Baseballs too üòÇ

anti-armor 50%+Tank Killer 36%+piercing capacitor, it should work on the Hermit Crab, but it's not.
---
I just made a locked back door for if I get locked out :/
---
Imagine logging in and inviting a couple of your friends to come nuke with you. You get organized and nuke the place. Next, some random guy pops up and starts running around killing things. I mean who is the toxic one here? You saw a nuke on a map that you had nothing to do with and decided to roll over and take on things you couldn't do normally.
---
If there was a chat system I'm sure the guy would just be yelling for you to leave.
---
#I 100% agree with #5.
---
There are so many cool locations and creatures in this game and I'm getting pretty bored of the Scorchqueen and Whitesprings. Give me deathclaws, mega sloths, behemoths, snallygasters, *Mirelurk Queens*, ect.  Would love some more mini-bosses and areas affected by the nuke.
---
I've been to Blast Zones outside of the two usual areas... they're usually empty and boring. 
---
He got powered doors? What's ur PSN?
---
Finally found a legendary piece with the weapon reduction effect. I'm so happy. Need more. My precious. 
---
The scorched open the doors pretty quick for me.
---
Good idea but its paper cash
---
not a moth man but had a wendigo  encounter with friends in fort defiance. we where going to second level and i was fighting some ghouls then bam out of no where a wendigo and it almost one shot me  i screamed my 2 friends laughed. when i went up again im like "ok i think its gone" so i go into that little room and throw a mine for the ghouls like "i can hear the ghouls coming" nope was the fucking wendigo scared the shit out of me again. also for some reason i mostly encounter them with ghouls.
---
Nope, but if u know that he can sell them we can farm him. Psn: lucianoschaeffer
---
I as well have been hunting for that mossiasc tile...glad I'm not alone. 
---
Selling re-used assets is the thing that honestly bothers me. Pretty poor practice there.
---
After thinking about, I do understand your issue with the Quality to price ratio? this game has. (Not sure how to word that)
---
You'll definitely find higher quality work from other publishers, but I've always personally looked at MTX as a way of supporting the company. Others like to add personalization, many different reasons.
---
This era of MTX run games is an odd one honestly. I can't complain though, because sometimes it leads to great games. Also opens the market to F2p games like Warframe, PoE, Fortnite.
---
WHAT really?!?!?! Would REALLY love to get deep pocketed without spending 3 perk points.
---
Ha! Love it. Are you on PC? There is so much testosterone in this game (granted all the chaps I've partied up with have been quite nice) I don't ever seem to come across other chicks out in "the wild". I seriously think that initially people hear me in voice and assume I'm a pre-pubescent boy. Especially considering the past week I've had a wicked cold. xD
---
I took a week off at Thanksgiving, a week for Christmas, and a week for New Years.
---
I started answering emails again yesterday.
---
Yeah and it should also be noted you don't need flux for mods. You can apply mods without the required materials even if it says you need them in the crafting menu. You only need the materials if you have the plan.
---
There is no reason they can't allow client side renaming as a QOL improvement.  There are so many small things like this that were in Fallout 3 and 4 that really make inventory management difficult in F76 due to their not being implemented....  At least with the new christmas lights skin on my t51 I can tell that's my active set but the other 4?  Ugh....
---
In the napoleonic wars, soldiers who ran out of ammunition for their flintlock/muskets would use the buttons of their suit and bent coins as payload to keep the enemies at bay 
---
Another historically alternative use would be as lowgrade bullets for The dragon and flintlock rifles 
---
Sure, yeah!
---
That's a glitch I've been screwed by at least twice now that I dont see anyone talking about.  Yesterday I threw away all of my 10mm ammo.  
---
Nope, directly next to the spawn. It¬¥s basicly a house, a barn and a small crop field surrounded by a big fence. I make some screenshots later and add them here.
---
Pretty sure it‚Äôs a bug, not a design choice. Combined with the fact that many mods give different materials than they say they do when scrapped, I‚Äôm confident scrapping mods is just bugged to shit in general.
---
LOL!
---
I feel you. My first encounter involved death, returning to grab my stuff and then a narrow escape. 
---
Back to the OP's point, mothmen can also scare the pants off you with their abilit to pop right in on you. And they seem to be close to invincible.
---
I wonder how we could solve that... ‚ò∫
---
And if you come across female corpses in tattered dresses, you should investigate ...
---
Don't forget ignition cores are also scrappable.
---
Does he spawn randomly everywhere or only on a Point?
---
I had the wise Mothman yeasterday after finishing the Event‚ò∫Ô∏è
---
I‚Äôm on Xbox so I‚Äôve noticed when it spawns 2 one always drops nothing and one always drops something 
---
Yeah I love how I can accidentally auto-scrap mods but beer bottles ,that only give you glass, have to be manually scraped...super annoying :(
---
Did not know that thanks for the insight I‚Äôm just getting into legendary loot now 
---
I was stalked by one once. It followed me for about 5 full minutes. It would attack from a distance. Then I would run away, and think I was safe. Wrong. It followed me, and attacked me. A lot. Pretty creepy. 
---
I have around 100 or so spare , how many do you need ? 
---
That ski sword is what is keeping me from being overencumbered 99% of the time
---
There is indeed a seriously toxic chunk of players in this game and everyone wants to sweep it under the rug.
---
Pvp is everything people didnt want. I dont understand why they didnt go the borderlands route.
---
I totally agree. In all the older fallout games energy weapons were considered "end game" and did alot of damage and were fun to use. They just dont do enough damage or break too fast. Plasma weapons also seem to miss alot even at point blank.. another concern is they typically do not drop very often (excelt the laser rifles) which makes them more difficult to learn mods. Once you have the plans they also take alot of materials to make. regardless of this I dedicated myself to making them work and did find two semi useful non legendary builds. If you have a good legendary consider building like one of these two:
---
Gamma wave scatter automatic laser rifle: actually does decent damage but breaks really fast even with gun 5 and luck of the draw 3. The scatter turns it into a shotgun laser spray (shotgun perks do not apply though) and being automatic with burn damage itll kill most things fairly quickly. Again, itll break after you kill like 3 enemies though.. sigh. 
---
Gamma wave plasma flamer: probably the most viable energy weapon build I've found and also alot of fun to use. It just melts enemies alive and lasts a reasonable amount of time with gun 5 and luck of the draw 3. However, it also eats plasma cartridges like crazy lol. I now have a 2 shot one and it's a blast using. I have the prime capacitor for it but I'm waiting till I have like 5k ultracite ammo stockpiled before I change the capacitor over for fear of running out of ammo too quickly. 
---
My thoughts on a fix: we need an energy weapon damage perk card (or add damage buff to the 3 science cards) to boost damage output or a general damage buff to all energy weapons. 
---
Yeah I do feel some remorse because as soon as a scorch beast comes in they rush to my aid 
---
https://imgur.com/a/yPnP1zO
---
He just stared at me from a distance last night. 
---
&gt;gave time for things at Whitespring to get respawned
---
I was fairly certain things only spawn when a player newly enters the area for that session?
---
Lol on phone auto correct crap i meant they dont work in power armor 
---
I failed to mention that it gave me a message that a player killed me. Forgive me for not remember the exact phrasing but it's the box that pops up with red in it that states the players name and caps loss. Given that I always one shot people in consensual PVP, I don't believe it's outside the realm of possibility but it could be a bug. I'm also wondering if it has something to do with teams. I had been in one with a friend who logged off and I became the defacto team leader of just me, right before I went to White Springs.
---
I'd like em to fix the bug with the salavaged assaultron head cause I just got a double shot one, I'd also like em to fix the bug on the Lever Action Rifle that reloads all bullets.
---
Also for the life of me please fix the CAMP spotlights cause none of them work ATM. Also it would be great if outdoor lights were only on during the night. Thats sort of basic stuff.
---
They also need to fix DPS on a bunch of ranged weapons cause handmade is just too good now and melee in general is far easier than ranged. Same as two handed melee is way too good vs one handed melee.
---
They also need to do something about the power armors all having the same label in the inventory.
---
Did he even review Fallout 76?
---
Checked. He did. Pretty interesting. This is ‚ÄúWorst and Blandest‚Äù and to be fair Fallout 76 is a huge new direction in some ways from the usual Fallout game, and I‚Äôm not just taking about it being multiplayer. 
---
So while the bugs and screwups put it in the running for worst, it‚Äôs definitely not bland. Inb4 ‚Äúbut no NPCs lOLlErSkAtES!‚Äù
---
So I‚Äôm guessing you‚Äôll never believe that you‚Äôre a small group of devoted fans. Why can‚Äôt that be enough for you. You‚Äôre a small group of devoted fans. 
---
You aren‚Äôt a large player base. It isn‚Äôt some conspiracy. Many people who played this game didn‚Äôt like it, most aren‚Äôt interested. These stories obviously aren‚Äôt changing your made up mind. So why not just ignore it and play. 
---
I just want to know the "anti-armor" is anti-defense stats or just the piece of armor you are wearing. 
---
Cool man looking forward to seeing

here's those screen shots, just missing the ransom note on the wall in the room.

---
Ahh ok so i get down voted for not knowing it was a card game. Cool cool.
---
Cheers for letting me know though I had no idea lol.
---
I was looking at that but no idea what I would take off to add it
---
I'll check it out tho I got like 15 lvs just waiting to be used
---
Ahh I can see it now.  Can't wait for Borderlands 3!
---
Many thanks!
---
Oh I just assumed you were new, sorry! VATS critting a scorch beast with commando is pretty fun. I can kill one pretty quickly with a non-legendary gun... you're in for a treat.
---
Are you sure? I scrapped like 50 before I found a post of someone who datamined everything available from scrapping and it wasn't listed
---
This is exactly the type I ran in to. He was following behind me about as far. As I aimed down my sights at him it‚Äôs like he knew. He flew off right before I pulled the trigger. 
---
I‚Äôm level 66 and this is the first encounter I have ever had with him. To be fair I did just steal his eggs 10 minutes before. Seems they don‚Äôt like that.
---
Are you sure? My lever action rifle does insane explosive damage, I'd say more than shotguns. Only 5 shots before reload, but the fire rate is exceptional in the single shot rifles department.
---
You can see your open tickets here: https://help.bethesda.net/app/account/overview
---
Oh I saw kotaku's thing on the nuke bug from someone on twitter.
---
While I have no idea about silo timers, they also said the code officers weren't spawning. Which is kind of amusing considering I found an unprecedented 6 of them in Lewisburg at once *before* the hotfix this week,
---
Gotta give the Bethesda creative team lots of credit. Not only have they managed to come up with a lot of cool new creatures, they've done it in a way that can get our pulse going. 
---
Even the scorchbeasts. When I hear those wings, I feel like a field mouse with an eagle overhead. 
---
I don't mind the atom store to finance upcomming projects but charging 8 euro's for a single hairstyle is beyond ridiculous. I understand i don't have to purchase these skins and they are merely cosmetic but the fact they actually have the balls to put a price on a item like that is just scandulous. 
---
The people that don't mind going through the shitshow launch and understand it's WIP are just getting straight up shit on. 
---
You are correct. I meant the mole teeth (needed to upgrade the mole miner gauntlet). 
---
...and it uplinks to the satellite so when the signal reaches the Zetans in a few thousand years they'll ACK ACK ACK laugh at our asses too.
---
I got the plan for the mod at Watoga I'm pretty sure. If you're on PC I can mod one for you if you like
---
I see it as experimentation. They have no idea what to charge so they put out similar things with different prices to see what they make more ‚Äúmoney‚Äù on. If this is true they will eventually find a sweet spot and pricing will be more consistent. I am _trying_ to patiently wait for that to happen.  
---
You do have the required perks? Thought it should display it clearly if you don't.
---
Unless your mod is not the correct one. 
---
What the other guy is correct. The game will display resources needed but as long as you have it as mod, you should be able to just attach it.
---
Do notice that I recall, the button to apply a ready mod, is different than the botton to craft (and install) it. Make sure you read the bottom of the screen, and again, some PA mods are not very clearly labelled.
---
&gt; Then for God knows what reason you need 2 mods for calibrated shocks (English language would suggest shock is single and shocks is multiple) 
---
No. You need two shocks for two legs. You need only one shocks for one leg.
---
Also https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plurale_tantum That's fairly common thing on many languages. 
---
no need to apologize, it‚Äôs hard to tell who‚Äôs new and who‚Äôs not. i pretty much am new when it comes to auto weapon builds so any suggestions would be greatly appreciated 
---
We're neighbours! Well kinda.

Go slightly east to the road. I'm built around the bus there. You have to go through the bus to reach my workshop and water purifiers. The house is next door, along with a separate guest room.

---
Totally of topic back  during wotlk in wow,  a update caused token points not to be used on purchase.  I knows for myself and others no one got banned or rolled back unless they were open over it.  I think the bug was in live servers for all of 2 to 3 hours. 
---
They do get loot, so run as many mobs as you can over to them so they destroy the base. 
---
I've only encountered the Mothman twice, that I've noticed anyway.
---
The first I was like level 3 not long after leaving Vault 76, and all of a sudden there was a level 50 Mothman just chilling in the middle of the road, wings all folded up. Once I realized that he wasn't going to attack me, I took a few selfies with him, and then he poofed as disappeared.
---
The second, I was level 15, and climbing down a mountain when something began attacking me. I couldn't see where it was coming from until I looked up, and saw a level 1 Mothman flying above me shooting at me. I killed it with one shot, and nervously expected looted his body, fully expecting revenge after my peaceful first encounter.
---
But I've never seen him since. Not even when I went to the Mothman museum and ate a bunch of his eggs.
---
Act like it then. Tell me how you would "Destroy' this company in a letter, that they told you to write them to get your 60$ game back. The reaction would roughly be."Haha. Oh man" \*Moves mouse button to Perma banned folder\*
---
That's meta as fuck...
---
The flatwoods monster shows up points in the corner where they placed the hidden camera and explain that we are all on a hidden camera show.
---
&gt;There's even a legendary Fat Man that weighs only 2lbs, so why not a sniper that weighs even 5 lbs?
---
Weightless effect can spawn on rifles as well.
---
I‚Äôve encountered a Mothman exactly once. I was fast traveling to my buddy when I fell asleep (I‚Äôm a third shifter with a crappy sleep record). When my character loaded in, I was abruptly awoken by a scream and loud thwacking sounds. I looked up to see the gigantic glowing eyes of a very angry Mothman, and I nearly crapped myself.
---
And Bethesda are literally the only ones who won't...
---
&gt; ok so i get down voted
---
Reddit is a lot more tolerable when you just ignore karma entirely.
---
ahh, I wondered how to use that piece. i thought it maybe was to go up a level - i saw it like a periscope to carry the other end of pipe up. I didnt think about spinning it around to where that power point stuck thru a wall. i will try that tonight, thanks!
---
P
---
enjoy the journey slowly, right now the end game is an infinite grind 
---
&gt;Respond to that Community team
---
Hey  StingyBlingitz - thank you as always for sharing feedback.
---
I've shared this suggestion previously with the team but will do so again.
---
or something to that effect.
---
The explosives/molitov dev/qa guy/s (gals?) knew what they were doing...  So there's one person/team we can compliment.  Right?
---
It's definitely an odd design choice considering you can upgrade the quest items received in a particular quest. They aren't "legendary", but upgradable none the less. I wish they would have given that option to all quest reward items. 
---
I think just the Atomic store ones
---
Well just doing them. Clans are just group of people. 
---
Maybe he is the ‚ÄûKirito‚Äú of fallout 76 ;)
---
That does look pretty good and relatively close to mine only thing I'd change is the rifleman perks with only one point on each I'd be losing like 60% rifle damage and the dodgey perk sounds good but I'm almost always out of AP even not using vats
---
Thanks again I'll try something similar to this out tho I got a bunch of lvs waiting to be used
---
I was referring to the choice to not have dialogue options and great NPCs. We got Rose, Grahm, MODUS and a bunch of snarky protectrons... that's about it. The fact that we can't interact with them more than "Press E" makes it worse. I kinda miss the whole "if I do this than this person(s) will like/hate me" and having to think out my decisions. 
---
I know its just beating a dead horse at this point but it still stings.
---
I got the Patriot paint to go with the blue tricentenial one for the Captain America look,, now waiting for a nice Red one for an Optimus Prime look.
---
Who decided that mole rat teeth don‚Äôt get auto-scrapped but hardened mass does I mean come on. 
---
Mods shouldn‚Äôt be scrap-able, and if they are, it should come with a warning, and bulk junk should be prioritized for repairs before it.
---
I mean we have aluminum and copper too so maybe we could mix at a station to make more as needed
---
The flatwoods monster is a zetan, same face as your picture. 
---
If you have pacifist enabled they can technically damage you but it is a really small amount. Their weapons would likely break before they killed you
---
You can get the mistress of mystery mask as well for the mask requirement areas. No radiation protection but stops the airborne diseases and no perception penalty. 
---
Does anyone know if there will be a back pay scenario for atoms? Because I'm owed atoms for a fair few challanges I've completed and not been rewarded for. But how will the game know that? I don't think it will.
---
Vault-Tec   
---
ASSISTED  
---
Targeting   
---
System  
---
It's assisted and it kinda sucks. You don't get to have full auto aim, sorry. 
---
Drop a fusion core into old excavators and drive them to your camp for ground leveling!
---
Tried to play on Xbox last night and crashed every other minute. Unplayable.
---
Indeed. I prefer 30% crit over explosive as I'm mostly into crit builds.
---
Pacifist mode for life. Game has literal auto aim. Dupers have given everyone access to op weapons. Vats will teleport a melee attacker 30' to hit someone. Nothing about the pvp is balanced or proper in any way shape or form. I will literally change servers if someone takes muh workshop. Lol 
---
It doesn't even look like a moth, it looks like an owl.
---
Agree wholeheartedly though I'm pretty much the moron now because you would think I would learn to install calibrated shocks IMMEDIATELY. Plot twist: I did actually learn my lesson but then someone said "I found a room of typewriters and globes" and off I go.
---
I haven't seen to many servers with just a few people. But the people saying they routinely get 30+ minute ques are full of shit that's for sure. 
---
Nope https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=f359b58&amp;d=s40ss2sg2sm0se2sn0sb2pe2es2eg1i44lu2l71lt2a00ih2i12a80cu0ev0ce0cm0cd0ck0cf1a72&amp;w=&amp;n= this is more pa chem crazy since they give sick  buffs Also safeish playstyle with better auto heal and increased heal buff with perks dmg is gonna be fine with a super slegde and chems Also all the charisma perks are for very team fokused play style Also. 
---
Still got him?
---
100% legit agree!  I have now literally enclosed my bramen inside my house...
---
Probably much easier to code it simply to auto rename the chassis with whatever armor type is in the head or chest slot.
---
And I'm pretty sure we'd all be fine with that.
---
Hmm - but isn‚Äôt changing stash upper limit like ... editing one command line...? 
---
Haven't used it, but out curiosity, what type of sights were you using? (Reflex, scope, iron sights) What distances did you try and what is your perception level? Interested in this mod and would like to know if it's bugged or just works in a way that is unclear from reading the description
---
I agree with everything but #10 . Don‚Äôt buy a pvp game if you can‚Äôt handle getting healed for free 
---
Mine dropped a legendary yesterday after hotfix. I only got him once though, and moved on.
---
Seriously, what is going on? Rumors of enormous bugs that don't exist, articles based on flat out lies? The world is against this game and it feels like a conspiracy. 
---
I would just like a system to pull off perks and put them on a weapon of your choosing. 
---
Mobs shoot at your base from just outside turret range, ive walked back to my base many times and ive caught scorched, mutants, rats, dogs, wolves and scorched beasts attacking my base... zero in game notification when its a npc. 
---
Syntha Claus you mean
---
I don't think they can. Actually tell I've gotten 2 of the same 2 shot 10m at max durability from a nuke at white springs.  They actually stacked. It makes me wonder. What they could do. I agree the meta is trash and bethesda needs to address the issues.  But a ban wave by id number would catch far to many innocents who bought junk off thr bazaar.  
---
Yea. I had it most of the time until one guy asked me to kill him cause he shot someones wall by mistake. Forgot to turn it back on and i shot  (somehow) a wall of another person while SBQ run. 
---
No shame. I ran across a camp outside of the golf course like this two days ago. The missle turrets were lagging shit out and killing ghouls before I could attack. Got pissed off. Pulled out my instigating fat man and shot it straight at the turrets. Bounty was worth it.
---
**We‚Äôre also building an incredible list of future updates that we can‚Äôt wait to share, including new quests, weekly in-game events, new Vaults opening, a new PvP mode, Player Vending and much more.** 
---
Okay, that will be the new content coming. Now optimistically this month is when it would release, but. I would prefer to see it pushed back a little bit to ensure it has no game breaking bugs/glitches. Wishful thinking I know, but it would really help this game to have a really good DLC launch.
---
Side note does anyone else get slightly tilted from reading DLC? My first reaction every time is. but I already spent 60$ EA XD
---
I guarantee it wasn‚Äôt. 
---
&gt; Pacificst mode doesnt stop you from accidentally hitting camps.  
---
It deals no damage to the camp, and stops you from becoming wanted. Thus solving OPs main gripe.  
---
Reading some further comments from the OP in this thread though it seems he doesn't actually care about accidentally hitting peoples camps, he's just annoyed that turrets kill "his" ghouls/whatever.  
---
What about glitch when they shoot grenade in the air near you? I've never experienced toxic player by myself yet (and hopefully I won't ;), but I heard about that glitch...
---
Man. That was a treat to read. Dead on. I also dig the dedication on finding a way to make it work. I have been theory crafting in that direction with the Chainsaw.
---
Someone said they are above the priority for "bulk" material (i.e. it will scrap a mod before breaking down bulk). But, people say a lot of things that are wrong, so not sure.
---
You can't - not underwater.
---
You so full of shit! I don't know how but you ripped me off and took a lot of gear that was for other players mostly lower levels trying to get in the 100s. I  see you dupping all the time at the whitesprings, drupping rares to sell on herebI bet and just being a troll! People like you and your disturbed friends need to growup and act like adults! I was an idiot for trsuting this guy,  don't make the same mistake I did. Make sure someone will vouch for whoever you get into a trade screen with or you might get ripped off!
---
I think to summarize I will say this: we need more big dick energy weapons.
---
I love how Bethesda's UI can't even properly display levels beyond 99, and people were beyond 99 within a week. And people call it a "good game". 
---
Perception is low, like 6 or so, tried all sight types (except Recon obviously), but if it's in view it should mark it, if I'm out of PA and sight the same dude with a Recon scope it works.. 
---
As a powergamer - not a duper, just a regular powergamer - I find that being said from ModAbuseo funny
---
Great post. lol. I think in the months to come they need to create another real creepy creature or a down right creepy quest. At level 70 I've only encountered the mothman once. Lucky for me he glitched in a tree and I just shot him to death. Even then it was a bit creepy. Just running along and all the sudden a dark ball with big bright red eyes just sitting there. 
---
honestly, I could count almost 100 minor fixes that would make the game infinitely better 
---
Disagreements like? Cuz I've never got in a disagreement üòÇ
---
Stop having fun you bastards
---
I've seen Mothman once, when I was level seven.  It was 18, and being a newb back then I hauled ass out of there away from it.  Knowing now that they're generally not hostile, I wish I would have snapped some photos lol.  Found him up in the mountains when I was trying to cross the mountains to go to top of the world the first time.
---
See you're supposed to look at that and go "OH! Limited offer? I better buy it before it goes away! I may want to use that hairstyle at some point in the future" and burn through whatever atom stock you might have.
---
Mole Miners aren‚Äôt cryptids. They are children who were playing dress up in the mines when the nuke dropped thus the suit deforming and melting the miner suit into their skin. There have been many theories supporting this not to mention the fact they drop toys and players have recalled hearing them call out ‚ÄúMum...‚Äù 
---
The other cryptids like Mothman, Grafton Monster, Snallygaster and Flatwoods Monster could be incorporated into Fallout like you said as West Tek experiments or a Zetan but the game is based off West Virginia from the general map, locations and lore. If you didn‚Äôt know, all the cryptids you listed were a big thing around the 1960 -1980 for West Virginia reported as sightings and all that.
---
If you knew all of this and simply wanted a Fallout backstory to everything then I just wasted 5 mins of my life :D
---
The kind of people who find it fun to kill ants. I get that, I did it too...until I was 5 and grew out of it. :P
---
Calibrated Shocks are your best friend, they give you +50 carry weight for each leg. Better yet, *Excavator* with Calibrated Shocks for +200 total carry weight.
---
Yeah, checked my spam messages, made sure my email and everything was correct, etc.
---
Logged onto Bethesda's website for the hell of it and it looks like one was actually approved, three are still awaiting an agent and one is expired.
---
All without any email sent back to me, lol.
---
All press is good press
---
Yep, a buddy is with him, we re doing 1 log out and in per time with him, you can come to my session and add him too
---
I call this my "I'm tired of being an overburdened drug-dealer" build: My #Fallout76 character build https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=5f1189c&amp;d=ph2pp2pg2pi2p02s01sb2e60cu0ic4a72an2ar2lv2lk2lt2lr2s12&amp;w=&amp;n=
---
Nice- what plan set did the Big Chief ammo submachine gun poster come from?
---
Just why would you post it on Reddit? 
---
Eloquent words. 
---
No it was not. I know my stash. I know what is in my stash. I know what I took. I am not dumb. 
---
The stash primarily had baseballs, baseball grenades, home plates, and baseball themed items. Kind of like the guy wanted to decorate a baseball themed camp.
---
I don‚Äôt like baseball. 
---
Think is good to know. I am a melee user, who hasn't fought queen yet, and my plan was to use a missile launcher to cripple her, and cause her to land.
---
Back to the drawing board.
---
Adds more dynamic controls to things. Lock and unlock doors via their switches, turn off and on lights, change spotlight targeting parameters, etc. Useful to have for mechanical doors
---
My brother and I ran into one effectively right after leaving 76. It was strange, as we caught it on VATS sitting off the roadside. Aaand... it wasn't moving. It was wrapped up and refused to aggro. So being level 5 at most, we did the most reasonable thing, and bludgeoned it to death to save ammo.
---
Also, now that I'm back to commando and not carrying a ton of 2mm its 3 points too many in INT. If I learned to sell pharma I could yank 3 points from STR as well.
---
I'd love a giant berserk Motherlode to appear when Ash Heap is nuked.
---
Then they left it deliberately to be taken, or they were a duper.... then good on you. 
---
To promote his shitty channel
---
The problem is peoples turrets, not the camps. Youre fine.
---
5 min quest? To be honest ive just been shooting the cargo bots out of the sky, i just got my 5th one last night... ironically im a melee player.
---
does that actually belong to another player?
---
When you craft the set it comes with the Prototype paint on it. Other than that, no, just Atom Shop stuff.
---
yes! nuke the DMV!
---
I don't know where they are used but you can make granades out of the intact HalluciGen canisters.
---
&gt;All nuke Codes Solved! 
---
The title literally says its a spoiler.
---
It's not my channel lol.
---
No. Im pacifist always and i get wanted all the time because even in vats, my bullets can hit a canp.  Its so frustrating.
---
Lol did you memorize all of them just by peaking at them? If so you‚Äôre a genius and you should be spending your time in a more productive fashion 
---
...projects?
---
Someone makes a point that you don't like or can't refute? Assassinate their character by implying they're a duper and now you can ignore their argument.
---
Better yet, if they stop to address your new ridiculous accusation, you've derailed the conversation entirely in your favor!
---
48 year old housewife playing Fallout. I love it.  Never heard of a middle aged woman playing Fallout. (I'm 47) 
---
...look to the skies in nuke zones...
---
Early days of COD and interest in war history was mainly focused on the western front so to have that D-Day opening in SPR. It was the most chilling and realistic openings I have ever seen.
---
Enemy at the gate really got me because lots of people dont understand that the eastern front, especially Stainlingard was a huge turning point in the way. Watching the beginning with how the Russians didnt stop pushing forward and would rather kill their own men was the great at showing the viewers the true hell's of battle. 
---
I really liked both letters from Iwo Jima and the other POV one, they both really hit home on how brutally the Pacific war was. 
---
absolutely agree with you, soo many movies from that war that is hard to pick from them all. I'm a little bias because SPR was one of the first war movies I watched growing up and it helped me really enjoy Tom Hank movies going forward. 
---
Yep! Especially when you accidentally buy two of some dumb recipe and would just like your caps back, please.
---
Hmmm i Wonder how players setting the Price will interact with barter perks 
---
I see the /s...  but there's really one [one time](https://imgur.com/4w6amoS) I felt/knew that the guy I was trading with was a duper...
---
Exactly. It's my "I got a little too fat for the TP home" stick.
---
I have high strength but am not a melee character, so built-in armor piercing is essential. I found the Black diamond(with spikes) did better damage overall. If I had Incisor and could use a skate blade on it, it would be even better.
---
I‚Äôm positive, I only have three unlocked semi, auto, and charging shotgun 
---
You hit them once despite being perked out for stealth, hidden, and chameleon, and they zone in on you the moment the bullet hits them. Not cool man.
---
I've got a funny feeling it only puts a dot on your compass rather than the marker above your target like a recon scope does.
---
Wait so your saying our lord and savior was Perched up? I've only ever seen him on the ground or hanging by a tree. 
---
HolyMoth.
---
Probably cause people like duping stuff ü§Øü§Øü§Ø
---
At least someone‚Äôs moral compass is still working after the bombs dropped.
---
lol fair play!
---
Not encouraging cheating but clearly a few vocal people here seem to care more about it than Bethesda do.
---
Isn't the fact they've done nothing about this for almost 2 months now enough to show there not all that bothered?
---
Would have expected some sort of communication from them (the latest into the vault is just PR fluff) with some substance but seem that's to much for them sadly ...prob busy counting all that cash still :/
---
...probably means plans?
---
I totally trust people that are selling unique legendaries, but if they say something like "I have 5 (exactly identical item)", I assume they duped them.
---
My camp building is locked but I have outdoors crafting, cooking, and loot boxes. My 4 purifiers aren't locked because they make too much water and IDC. I'm not near White Springs though. 
---
No, 
---
They say this! 
---

---
I got the game yesterday and immediately tried to kill the first person I saw with a machete out of instinct. It didn‚Äôt register right away that it was a person. 
---
Fortunately, I didn‚Äôt hit him and we waved and went on with our days. 
---
Are you making a complaint or making a reference to the fact that one of the proposed "actual" things the "actual" Mothman could be is an owl? If it's the first, now you know why. If it's the second I salute you on your cryptid knowledge.
---
Didn‚Äôt even take an hour üòÇ
---
I'd love to have a dog that could fetch the loot from the mob. Or at least show me where it landed in the bushes so I could loot it.
---
You can also craft the assaultron gun itself from the head, I've picked up the plan somewhere so I can make them.
---
I mean ... its the SAME glitch :/. With 1 small extra step.
---
Also as much as people might not like it. 1. It's already super easy to youtube search these. 2. Exposure gets things fixed.
---
It's asinine to think "not showing these" on reddit makes them any less known, lol.
---
I actually connected with FO4, but It didn't work! I always wondered how it could be...
---
Most open world sandbox type games are going to be bugggy anyway.  Just by the nature of random and unpredictable events in said sandbox.  Worth the trade-off to me lol
---
Mods don't "go" into junk. Mods can be scrapped for junk. They will be scrapped for junk if you try to use that kind of junk and you don't have any free one.
---
In inventory mods have their own category.
---
&gt;Also, and I dont want to sound like an idiot, but how do we use mods? I have two sitting in my inventory, but I cant equip them to anything
---
In a relevant workbench. Like weapon workbench for weapon mods ect.
---
That would work as a first hot fix but later on custom would be nice
---
But then players might actually use the robot armor...
---
Must be a very low chance. It's not listed as having a chance at all. There's only 2 more mods you can unlock btw. Reflex sight and charging (regular charging not charging shotgun)
---
Currently helping a 14 year old.  He did believe he had to kill every player he met.  Now it's just those who give him or his team grief.  Even got him to build a CAMP that looked habitable and not just several workbenches.  It's funny (in a good way) when I am playing solo and he suddenly turns up and waves and team invites.  It's like having "Billy the Kid" on your team.
---
That may just be plan only. Some mods can't be learned by scrapping.
---
When measuring in Celsius
---
Nice uh... nice. Comparison. Lmfao
---
Yeah dude, you definitely need professional help
---
Or they would be in same order but it could be more random.
---
I will call on orbital strike down on the next base I see there. It‚Äôs fucking annoying.
---
Design screw up. Not choice.
---
Taking workshops are easiest way to gain plans
---
Doesn't matter, you constantly post this guy's videos either way.
---
Other post this guy posted this channel on for [example](https://www.removeddit.com/r/fo76/comments/ac20li/guys_the_dupe_glitch_hasnt_been_patched_new/?st=JQG5NCV6&amp;sh=4f1382d5)
---
Yes, for rare things. The rest are dead weight.
---
Okay, and where are the wires? I can't find them in build mode. And nothing comes up when I hover over the pylons or conduits. 
---
I like the game, but yeah. Low effort, lazy design and lack of QA are obvious. 
---
I decided recently that any future nukes will be slightly to the left (west) of the normal zone to try and destroy those camps that try to lurk on the edge...
---
All future DLC's is gunna be free, patch every few weeks, online server costs for being multiplayer game = expect cosmetic items to be overpriced and frankly i'm ok with that.
---
over entitled people 
---
Pacifist mode doesnt prevent people from doing accidental damage to camps. Im not sure why you need 6 turrets to back you up at whitesprings. Thats just sad.
---
Could be. I just never bulk steel as its not efficient (saves no space). 
---
     
---
I only bulk lead and alu. Or if I want to sell junk, in which case it is sold very shortly after being bulked. 
---
I have run into the Mothman twice right out the front door of my camp. Both times I shot it all that happened was it disappeared. 
---
This was before I knew what it was and how out of my league it is so I am glad for both glitches. 
---
I play on pacifist and have been 1 shot by players a few times.
---
Two shot explosives need nerfing if they are so ridiculous they 1 shot kill a player even with slap damage.
---
You're more than welcome to solve it yourself, but once you do it you'll be thrilled that there's a croud sourced solution available.
---
The deciphering is pretty cool, but having to collect the codes every time you want to nuke Whitesprings would be a colossal time suck. 
---
There's a quest in watoga that starts with meeting the mayor. If you have any interest in running anything melee related, don't do it until level 50.
---
!!!! Okay I really love that even in 76 I can still get surprised by mechanics after so much time played. Thanks for the heads up!
---
I bought the tux package for 800 of my 3200 in game earned atoms and I am completely happy with the purchase . I doubt I‚Äôll ever pay for anything with real money tho
---
If so, that sucks :-).
---
Alright, ok, alright, ok......
---
you should have turned your power armour headlamp off, that's what draws them in, they love the fuken lamp 
---
Sounds like it was not a player base at all because there is no unsecured storage. There is only your stash
---
Nope, they're instanced as far as I know. I had the quest the other day and another guy shot it down and looted it. I was still able to grab the card. The quest just shows you where the bit is.
---
Bought the same thing and don‚Äôt regret it! I‚Äôm hoping if more people buy at this price they will adjust the other prices accordingly!
---
So the armor pen on the blade of bastet ... is trumped by the armor pen added via mods on the sky sword and + 1 str?
---
Mothman ate your pants. It is known.
---
Pacifist mode doesnt prevent camp damage.  Im always on pacifist and even through vats The bullets can hit camps accidentally.  Im not sure why everyone thinks pacifist protects camps. It only protects people.
---
Yeah, I had it on a T-60 suit before and that's all it did.
---
Just put it in your stash. Every station vendor has a stash box near them.
---
It's the resistance values you see when you equip Awareness. Armor pieces are only here for cosmetics purposes. (Players can increase armour values without gear too.)
---
It¬¥s nothing special to be honest.
---
That¬¥s what you see when you come from watoga: [https://i.imgur.com/JXRg2RB.png](https://i.imgur.com/JXRg2RB.png)

---
There are no locks anywhere. Everything is free to use/grab. It¬¥s basicly a free fast travel point for fissure prime nukes. My friends have camps pretty much anywhere on the map so we can fast travel for free. 
---
"Do these publications know how obvious it is to actual players that they have no fucking idea what they are talking about?"
---
I've literally seen articles use Destiny 1 screenshots for Destiny 2. So probably not.
---
I have noticed amidst the recent nuke issue, that many are reporting a "fan theory" (some actually identifying it as such in their article, but putting it as gospel in their headline/leading paragraph) that is related to the year crossover. When really it could be dozens of things. And someone random said nuke officers weren't spawning so that must also be true (it wasn't, killed half a dozen in one town before the hotfix)
---
I think Neo‚Äôs point of view is very valid, provided that the movement never forgets it‚Äôs the right of every man...
---
Yea:( I was hoping it was like a recon scope. I have targetting HUD and am not really impressed. If recon turns out to just be a compass dot, I think I'll keep it
---
No, sadly, it does not work.
---
Never had a crash during scorch queen (that I remember). Maybe you got a down vote for somebody thinking you're exaggerating and expressing themselves that way... Or it's just because some salty fuckers down vote everything posted in this sub. Which happens too.
---
You on PC? Crashes are super rare for me.
---
Guy solved it in 5 seconds. Not sure why all the white knights are on this platform.
---
I thought those cows were a workshop thing! Because I learned the plan but can‚Äôt find it in my options. 
---
Yes, plans, translation wrong from italian "progetti"
---
I have deffo been there before.  I wish they had separate servers. Pve servers. Pvp servers. That way if you don't wanna deal with it you don't have to. Only problem is it would make workshops first come first serve. But in my hundreds of hours of gameplay, I've never taken a workshop from someone. If someone has the one I want/need, I just switch servers. 
---
Nice one.
---
But I must have the skin of a raisin.

Instigating Grognak Axe. I prefer it over All Rise. Just got a Vampire Shiskebab I started using to test out. I go back to the Axe though. Love it.
---
Welp, lets hop bgs does not come down on you for trying to sell their in game items for real cash.
---
Either way .. hahahahahahahahahahahahahaha. No.
---
make your camp as out of the way as possible.
---
mines out at the very bottom of the savage divide, south of vault 96. no griefers, no visitors period actually, nice and peaceful.
---
A bright mod? Cause i don't think it's bright enough. Also needs more smoke. Like annoyingly  smokey
---
They have so many assets they've held back they can not charge 8 bucks for one hair. It isn't entitlement to inform a company they want too much for their imaginary item. It's telling them they aren't achieving a satisfying price point for their customers, which is a valid complaint and also something which has fucked individual products as well as companies in the past.
---
You have to be in touch with what your players want to pay and if it's too high for most players then the problem does not lie with "entitled gamers".
---
Look I'm here to post this video, I'm not sure why you go to great lengths to attack the middleman.
---
Yeah I was selecting it instead of dropping it, thank you!
---
The only downside is that it's not centrally located to anything. But love how it flows.

Duping and selling ingame items for real world money?

The final boss is inventory management 
---
I mean I got good loot so evidently our version of good/great is different üòÇ I did I believe 30 or 40 maps one night and got a crap ton of good plans, armour (that was better than mine) a few guns and junk. Completely worth it for me
---
I just relocated mine to a lonely little place in the middle of the map near Yellow Sandy's Still, east of Top of The World, west of Harpers Ferry
---
The is the last quest I need to do.. launch a nuke.
---
I would like to get in on this, if I can tag along in the silo to see that part!
---
Now you're just being ridiculous...this is a game for everyone to enjoy. Not meant to shut out people like high school clique's.  You don't own that Nuke drop or its potential content. When i drop a Nuke, I want people there...its more fun.  ppl. are starting to get covetous of legendary drops, and forgetting the purpose of the game: teamwork and fun.  
---
I was having this conversation last night with a team mate as we were discussing the complaints, valid and otherwise, that people have with this game. The ability to chat in game was one of our topics.   
---
Our view as that everyone on the Xbox has the ability to PM other players on the Xbox. Plus you can download an Xbox phone app that makes that so much easier to do too, as you can type faster and not have to leave the game screen.  
---
We don't play on PC or PS4, so we were wondering if those platforms had some kind of limitations that Xbox doesn't.
---
Check my edit. 
---
Really hope in one of the DLC they give us Player Factions where we get to create our own factions.
---
There is a challenge to find an alien.... 
---
What is that even for? I've seen a few, but for weapons I don't care for, so I tossed them. 
---
It also has two heads.
---
They were yesterday. They must have just changed it. :-(
---
Yeah those are good, but I have the kid secure Id,  
---
Is punctuation dead?
---
Everything in this engine is ugly, they can‚Äôt do real hair so we get hair helmets like this :(
---
Then ‚ÄùWhat can I say but you're welcome?‚Äù
---
It is for me, and my black diamond is level 35 compared to my Bastet at 45 (since you can upgrade it). 
---
All the time, Usually it's the sick emote or whatever is oposite to the thumbs up emote. I'm on Xbox and on a mic but I never hear anyone. I always say hello though.    
---
I think it‚Äôs spawning 2 so one still drops something and the other only drops a flair gun 
---
Die.
---
&gt;  I'm saving the video and reporting the users in the video, along with your IGN Scorpion278
---
No, it's not that easy.
---
You can edit one line of code, think everything is all good. But 5 more lines of code, dependent on that single line of code are now all messed up. This could very well break the game. So unless its something like changing a "1" to a "2", changing a line of code generally involves changing several lines of code.
---
I'm level 102 and I think I have about 40 maps. I think I know what I'm doing this evening.

Liberator prime -&gt; liberty prime from china with liberator instead of head

Or ‚ÄùBlock this player‚Äù
---
FYI ants and mutant hounds also give plus carry food.
---
Awwww... xbox. I'll just hope Grahm has them next I see him.
---
legal action side lmao
---
So you would recommend dumping pack rat and getting a higher level food weight reduction? Might have to move some skill points if so.
---
Craft them at a Tinker bench
---
The hair actually looks pretty close to a style popular with black women  from the time (I don't know enough to know the name but I do recognize the style and where I know it from).  Who would have a devil if a time getting the looks in the photos you linked, especially without modern hair texture changing products.
---
Stealth boys and the halucanagen canisters.  Craft them from the tinker station.
---
Fuck Rose
---
You're given the plan/recipe so it should show in the Tinker bench....
---
More of an observation, my instincts when I first saw the mothman was "this looks like a giant owl."  Although after a closer look in game, they used a mirelurk body to make the mothman.
---
I feel so bad after taking their steel, aluminum, and lead. So, so bad I‚Äôm going to continue to use them as my little friendly robot sheep.
---
Buffs I believe?
---
nah man, you are typing way too much for someone who ain't angry
---
same here bro, already done on yt
---
Right on. Thanks for the input
---
Yeah I got in there during beta,it's cool
---
I got a Furious Gatling Gun off of one the other day...

Power Armor does not prevent limb damage, but it does prevent you from getting your limbs crippled. So it's overkill to have Adamantium Skeleton if you are Power Armor user.
---
Also, Serendipity flat out doesn't work in Power Armor. So use Emergency Protocols mod on your chestpiece for that instead.
---
But if you don't use PA? Yeah, Adamantium is very, very nice to have, unless you enjoy spamming stims every time you take a bad hit, which as melee will be a lot. 
---
I have the targeting HUD because at least that outlines the enemies... I do wonder if it outlines them based on the color of your Helmet lamp because I have the Red Tactical Lamp and everybody is outlined in Red... Anyone with it that doesn't have the Red light see a different outline color?
---
the ps4 has the same things Xbox does in regards to that.
---
on pc. you can message other players directly, otherwise you have near endless options to communicate with someone because you're on a computer.

Nothing official official.

Thats .. crazy.
---
Now I am curious as to the actual pen % of the legendary effect, more so when it comes to pistols {Only weapon class without a pen perk}. I am also curious now as too anyone with one handed melee build and the pen perk, which works better for them, pen wise.
---
Yesterday I checked on it but there was nothing. Maybe I have to read the plan/recipe ? 
---
Thanks for the history anyway. :)
---
i've found that if the foundation and the your camp set down point are on the same plane, 4 stories, though  functionally you only go 3, as you can't build anything above a fourth story.
---
You must not have played the other Fallouts because pre-war money is dolla dolla billz. Used to decorate my Tenpenny suite with stacks and stacks of cash.
---
Huh, I'm all for new outfits and whatnot but you'd better believe I put a premium on "clean" items.
---
Hoping for a functional washer and dryer to be released!  And a carpet shampooer....

So much caps for killing him, oooh where he is, i must try
---
That damn thing made me jump too, I was shooting it at distance when about L10 then lost sight of it, came out of the scope when I herd a buzzing n the bloody thing was right behind me, easy kill mind. 
---
I love that Modus is like ummm can you please leave here... we have a lot of work to do to get this ready...
---
Excuses, what is a mod? 
---
Disagree. Need general weight reduction. Not another perk card. 
---
This is why I mentioned the Blade of Bastet - after the 50% AP reduction, it should do more actual damage than the Black Diamond does with spikes unless you have a really soft target.
---
If u lock ur doors people seem to attack more often

Funnily, I just took this one yesterday

I'm a 37 year old woman, there are more of us than you think. I used to play CoD with a bunch of 60+ year old men. 
---
I took 5 workshops over in one session. 4-5 hours of farming the defense missions and I had racked up 20+ new camp plans. You'll get duplicates from time to time and the rarer ones can only be bought at vendors or obtained through questlines in my experience.
---
If it wasn't so pricey I would be on top of this like a flash. It's perfect for one of my characters. Too bad she already has a pretty cool hairstyle that I find acceptable enough to ignore this one in favor of saving my atoms for something I can't live without.
---
Ah, well. Better luck next time, Bethesda. :3

---
There is post with level 1600+ player above your post. Of course you got super idea how to make it even more stressing for server lol
---
It's always in increments of 10.  So if you have Lv. 5 versions of an item, the next craftable will be at Lv. 15.
---
The trick is to take out their legs first, just like protectrons. 
---
Yeah, they're no fun when they attack in groups ;-) 
---
I turned around the loot a truck and as I did I saw it in the tree line behind me just staring at me from a distance. Pretty freaky. 
---
My second day playing I was investigating the map and came across the light house event when a billion giant frogs jumped me. Took them out and read the quest was a attempt to summon Mothman. I'd not even made it to his museum yet so I was all "Hell yeah lets do this." Two or three more huge waves of those damn frogs and countless fire flies later I'm on the tower waiting for him to show and nothing. Disappointed I walk back down the tower turn to close the door as I'm weird about closing doors. And here a thump behind me, I pull my gun thinking its more frogs and its a big purple eyed mass. I put my gun away and despite no mic I am making the shushing sounds people do to random animals. It stands there buzzing or whatever that noise it makes is and I get a ping saying a limited time effect is on me giving me a exp bonus %. SO I carefully ease closer and take a selfie with him, and the moment the game tells me the picture was taken, whoosh off he goes. 
---
Except Tiny Tina didn't make me want to stab chopsticks into my ears. 
---
At endgame you drop legendaries on the ground all day. No point dragging them back to a store because you already hit cap limit before you even really started playing. Rifle builds don't suddenly go pistol for one legendary drop. You drop the useless-to-you item on the ground and keep farming.

Best spot I‚Äôve found that‚Äôs often overlooked - white springs, not only for golf balls, but clubs also provide plastic.

Then there is the boat tour on the sw edge of the forest, lots of life preservers
---
Yeah, that sounds pretty likely. 
---
She reminds me of a lovable little psycho from borderlands 2.
---
Nope. But you can sell it still. Since I've built on the silver node, I've been able to clear out all vendor caps each day and still have a ton of silver left over. 
---
Means much coming from a uneducated and fat American.
---
Short version: yes. And thanks for the disclaimer, it does end up that way sometimes. :(
---
I don‚Äôt have the long version btw cause I don‚Äôt have actual numbers. If someone did and showed conclusively the Blade is better, cool. They‚Äôre just so close that the +1 strength pushes the Diamond juuuust past the Blade, for me.
---
I appreciate that this is well thought out. Some of these proposed changes are great. That said, some of these proposals will just make the game extremely easy mode, and some suggestions are just unnecesary. Bloody mess increasing corpse to meat pile conversion? Why? If it's to help the server, speed it up across the board. What's the point of having the perk to speed up this process? There's no benefit to looting a corpse vs a meat pile...
---
"junk should weigh zero" While I think Junk should have some sort of seperate storage system, as I agree we do need more for weapons/armor, making it zero will not only make managing junk and incentivising selling bulk obsolete, it might negitivly impact the servers with some people hording exponential amounts of junk. 
---
I think the post is good and well thought out. Some ideas here need a serious second look though.
---
I tried to take a picture of my moth man kill once but he turned to ash D:
---
Bright headlamp and still red outlines...  your headlamp color has nothing to do with your Targeting HUD.  I do find its a bit inconsistent though, at times it will fail to highlight some enemies.
---
Lol, it's just a game. Get a life.
---
Yeah it probably shouldn't in terms of clarity of effects on perk cards =/
---
You know what if you think aesthetics are so unimportant why don't you just go find a fucking MUCK to connect to where it doesn't matter at all. I hear there's still a number of them open, Tapestries might offer a space where you can go get fucked.
---
Unfortunately due to the horrible social and grouping system. Farming white springs is far easier solo. By the time you get everyone loaded in, wait for the mobs to visually spawn, and then have every one grouped up. In the time you could almost have the place cleared. 
---
It turns a 3 mins process into a 10 min one, plus you always got that one guy going around picking up everything, and double checking the corpses. Then after 3 runs they are full and need to sell while everyone waits. 
---
I tried it a few times and lost my patience‚Äôs rather quickly. 
---
I've been keeping them as well. Maybe a syringer barrel or something??
---
&gt; I'm beyond happy for you to disagree. It's a discussion. But I just don't enjoy fake excuses.
---
You obviously not or you wouldn't have suggested I leave for disagreeing with you. It's not a "fake excuse" just because you don't agree with it.
---
&gt; I accept we gain atoms for free but my problem is, a existing outfit ingame can cost us, what, 300, sometimes to 600. (the ski outfits) a paint job for Power Armour costing us 1.8k is insane, I love the Northern lights paint set, it's unquie and added new sounds and light to the armour. Costing me 1k from random dailies. that 1k is perfect in my eyes.
---
I've purchased two of those "insane" PA paints in a few months (along with a bunch of other stuff) and I've not purchased any Atoms yet.
---
Again, $18 for a PA Paint would be ridiculous, but it's not $18 as long as you're actually playing the game.
---
&gt; The huge problem is, why is this hair 800? Others are 600, 250, we need set prices. I wouldn't mind is it was 300, I personally think 800 is closer to a new weapon skin.
---
Your suggestion, which was what I replied to, was the idea that they should be 50 each, lol.
---
Here's the truth of the matter, items need to be priced in a way that a percentage of the playerbase will actually purchase Atoms. There's currently no need to actually purchase Atoms.
---
&gt; I gain around 50-70 atoms a day (I normally don't do my dailies and just get them randomly from playing) but for people who do, I think something as simple as hair should be 150-350 depending on how the hair is, is it out going and adds more to a model, up it to 350 sure. Is it a bit basic? 200, is it a reused asset from an older game and costs us 600? Shoot me down. I don't think we should pay for existing items atm. I think atom store should be solely new things but still. That's a different topic
---
You suggested they should be 50, that's my primary issue. If you want to debate 800-&gt;600 or similar we can, but it's not only dishonest, but also a fallacy to attempt to shift the goal posts now.
---
-----
---
Decide what price you think is fair, edit your initial post to reflect that price, that's what I'll debate against. AAt the time of writing this your initial post still says 50.
---
Oh ok. Makes sense because the legendaries were spawning like crazy. In about 30-45 mins I probably saw 15 when I normally see like 3 or 4.
---
I like seeing posts like this. 
---
Helping out other players (whether they are a low level player, young and might not understand some of the concepts/gameplay, or new to the series) is something that isn't seen too often in alot of online communities, at least in my experience. It's just nice to see, and I've had positive experiences from the times I've teamed up with low level players, or some youngin who was getting mauled to death by mongrels. plus they could use some of the 80+ stims and radaway that I cant stop hoarding.
---
That dude's handled a lot of grenade sacks in his time.
---
Everything but bulking junk.
---
That ski sword is what is keeping me from being overcucumber all the time
---
Fairly certain that doesn't apply here, I have to assume the stash limit is set in a variable somewhere and all references to the stash limit are references to that variable.
---
Basically that means that instead of typing the stash limit in several places in the code it is set once and all other times it just points to that variable. Changing the stash limit would then literally only be changing a single number in one place.
---
 Then it's spot on. She is a raider after all
---
I thought so too, but when I tried the two on actual enemies, the Diamond was keeping up. 
---
They drop after you kill 3 star legendary opponents.  Whitesprings is your best bet - nuked/post nuked.
---
That is because YouTube is his job. He makes his money every time you watch. He doesn't care about a ban because he makes more than enough on the videos to buy another copy and keep playing.
---
And yes, a simple database query for every moron with 600 tons in his inventory is quite trivial.
---
Sweet. For me that just makes playing this game better. 
---
I am pretty furious every time it's a leather left leg :-)
---
Sorry, I promised it to u/Jank1 last night but if for some reason they can‚Äôt I‚Äôll shoot you a PM.
---
Just changing the stash limit is probably one line of a config that's used, not any kind of code
---
In Spanish, I think it's the same voice actress.
---
God damnit almost every voice actor on Fallout 76 is from Borderlands series. Even the Super Mutants are just Kriegs.
---
I'm recently getting back into the game after not playing it since launch week. 4 AM, doing The Path to Enlightenment event for the first time. Walked down the stairs and fucking jumped at the wise Mothman sitting at the entrance staring at me. Things creepy as hell. I proceeded to take 20 photos of it though, which proved to be a huge mistake cause now I jump every time I see the close-up of its face I took whenever I'm loading an area.
---
Yeah that's what I was trying to ask.. i'll keep an eye out for answers =P
---
The easy fix would be if it just named itself the model it is, or the model that is most equipped to the frame. 
---
Currently I only care about my full T51-b and the excavator sets. So its easy for me to tell because my T51 has the patriot paint and has the atom symbol next to the name and the excavator doesn't. 
---
Been there...
---
I think it's where all my excess adhesive went
---
It doesn't apply here, it is just a property value. 
---
I was exhausted halfway through this rant.
---
I have so far only seen one wendigo, and it was actually killed by some super mutants mere moments before I rounded the corner to see what the fuss was about. I'm glad I didn't get there a couple of minutes earlier... 
---
I have this issue trying to trade with vendors sometimes. Takes a couple tries. Bugs man...
---
I will never understand Sony's decision to neuter mods like they did with FO4. Didn't they say mods can only use existing textures or something?
---
The photos linked are probably time consuming since they're modeled photos, but achieving a similar look without worrying about how kempt it is probably wouldn't take long back then. It was normal not to shower everyday and oily hair is easier to work with, plus many women slept with curls in and such.
---
If you CAN tame cryptids, I'd tame a Grafton Monster so i can call him bob so when super mutants attack i can shout "bob do something!"
---
wait, mods get auto scrapped when you need junk for building stuff??   that is crazy!!!
---
Son of a bitch, they deleted my ticket and my girlfriend's ticket too.
---
I just woke up but I'm on periodically throughout the day. I'll add you
---
Interesting - good to know.  Unfortunately when I got my Diamond it was lv35 so the Blade of Bastet was more useful in the end.
---
Wedingos too! Those fucking things look like the grudge girl grew up with a heroin addiction
---
No you didn't.

Thanks for the new insult!

I took down my first sbq last night. After reading posts like these I expected to do no damgage. Level 71. However, when I got there properly specced out with a stealth, sniper rifle build my twoshot non-explosive combat rifle was taking out visible chunks of damage so I know I was helping. Plus I was able to tank quite a bit from her after I aggroed. There were four or five other players there most above 140. We took her down in short order.
---
So, let's just say that your arbitrary suggestion does not apply in all situations. You can have high level players that are useless and low levels that help out.
---
Nice, where did you find those? i will start collecting them
---
Dude, the game is as if 1950's America never left. No shit there won't be a bunch of African stuff. And does it really matter? 
---
It would matter to some players obviously.
---
Every. Single. Time.
---
That‚Äôs unfortunate, because the wendigos actually drop decent loot if you kill them yourself 
---
I got this message after weeks of no response from them and me pestering them a bunch... 
---
"**Your request has been validated and you‚Äôre approved to receive your new canvas bag once it has been manufactured. Please allow 4-6 months for manufacturing and delivery**.
---
4-6 months! Wow I'm pretty sure in 4-6 months I can learn how to make canvas thread, learn to use a loom and make my own canvas bag LOL!!!
---
Does it do the red scan lines as per FO4 or is it a glow (like the ready brek man).
---
If the latter I think others nearby see it too, I don't have it and a few times in Enclave bunker the bots are glowing red
---
I guess the PS4 one is fucked. Bc nothing comes up when I hover in build mode lol. 
---
And I wouldn't be surprised. I get disconnected from the server, error codes, and freeze multiple times throughout the day. If 30 min goes by without incident, then I've entered the Twilight Zone. 
---
I lost two x0-1 jet packs this way. I was pulling my hair out, trying to work out where they‚Äôre gone.

Leaked Footage of the end of month update
---
I am with the same bug, I completed the quest but did not win the trophy.
---
What area was this? Doesn't the SB Queen get stronger/harder to kill when there are more people there?
---
Realism is the most weak excuse to not be inclusive in a game with strong fantastic elements. Unless you're telling me you think a mirelurk king is more realistic than a black person. And if you are, and it's because you know an actual mirelurk king can I get his number? Mirelurk kings can get some of this ;)
---
I feel like the game is meant to just *start* out like this, but eventually they will start to add in humans and non-feral ghouls at some point. Like they are in fact it there, but hiding because of the scorched. 
---
As long as any new characters added have as much soul as these characters we're good. Expanding on existing characters even better. 
---
Thank you! 
---
same happened to me I was running around in my newly refitted excavator armor shotgun in hand and see these giant eyes looking at me was like ok nope not going that way turn around and its 2 feet in front of my face I unload my entire shotgun into it and start reloading and backing up about to fire again when I notice it wasn't moving
---
mothman lvl 5...... apparently my first shot killed it and the other like 7 were just reflex 
---
this is nice btw... surprised no one said anything about this...
---
The company you work for is trash and the game that you released is trash.
---
Queen lands way more frequently then other scorched beasts
---
(throws molatov at enemy does nothing) sooo glad those bottles were safe....
---
Before Christmas, i felt like most everybody low-level i met was just an alt account because they all knew exactly what they were doing.
---
Now there's some legitimate noobs around that appreciate a hand sometimes. I love crafting and handing out level 1 spiked rocket ballbats like a crazed melee Santa Claus.
---
Lol you believe in stats.
---
I have them on XBox. I think I also have emergency protocols.
---
I also have t51b jet pack and calibrated shock plans and can craft those too.
---
I know they're not, bc I can't figure out how to wire them lol. From other people's responses, I guess my game is just fucked. No menu or options come up when I hove over the lights or conduits (in build or reg mode). 
---
I used to spam E on the machine to drop all the ingredients, now I take my sweet time
---
But *HOW*!
---
Mothman has it out for me since I started. I was barely level 5 when I went with friends to Point pleasant. Now, having grown up in WV, I know the stories. So I saw the statue, and picked up the eggs/loot, and promptly cooked up an omelette. 
---
Fast forward to level... 35? I'm running for my life to whitesprings, trying to ditch a scorch beast. Who shows up? That jackass, vengeful mothman. Who the bots ignore. Who I have to kite while weapon after weapon breaks. Who I finally Kill... only to upset the bots and run for my life out of whitespring. 
---
He regularly shows up to harass me when I'm in the worst position possible. Five times now. Five! All because of a silly omelette. 
---
Now I deal with the mothman with explosive prejudice every chance I get. 
---
You hear me?!? You can't pick on me any more!!
---

---
What items do you want in the game that will be in there? It's nothing that you are going to need right? Special weapons or armor?
---
I haven't really checked out the atom shop. I assumed it was mostly cosmetic stuff. But if they are putting in special weapons or something like that then I might have an issue.
---
&gt; Check your cynicism at the door.
---
I'm glad someone with first hand knowledge stepped up. I doubt very seriously anyone has intentionally said "just let 99% of the complaints slide through and don't address them, we'll address anyone who really throws a fit on social media though."
---
It seems much more likely that someone is misunderstanding the problem in a complicated situation, such as a team not being responsible for a certain type of sale (gear store) and trying to pass it over to the right team, or someone just being generally incompetent. Or an entire company being backlogged with issues because of a rough release of a product. I bet these guys are still neck deep in nylon bag tickets, so 4-5 weeks sounds about right *for processing*. Not shipment.
---
I agree though, someone should be able to take a look at his ticket and at least let him know the status. Even if that status is "sorry bro, it's a mess over here and it's taking longer than we thought. It's not being ignored, though!"
---
So, are those conduits I'm using not the right ones? You can see they're right next to the lights. 
---
Everyone else is saying they need to be wired. I give up. 
---
Why do you lock your camp? I used to but don't see any benefit.
---
Why would anyone buy the x-01 mods and not turn around and install them at the power armor station right behind the vendor?
---
I'd even accept the total armor values so I could just tell the difference by that 
---
Technical data drops, and BoS missions
---
Time to burninate the countryside!
---
*How*? 
---
No menu or options come up when I hover over the conduits or pylons, in build or play mode. 
---
All of the BoS fatigues (and the Bomber Jacket) were given to me. No idea where they come from. 
---
Bethesda could make "Pre-war Coins" that you could scrap to silver and copper at a workstation, as well as keep the "Pre-war Money" as paper bills.
---
Haha! Fuck that place!
---
 We need a check list with the plan name and what it's actually for, so we can print it out. Unless a solution is coming in a week or two? 
---
That's what I mean; every time I've tried that, it fails ("selected item is floating." no shit, game, that's the point). Or it reaches the ground, but won't place because it's "unsupported." I gave up trying after that.
---
Will this now become a wholesome fallout meme? I support it!
---
This is soo relationship goals fml
---
umm no... you can't get there via the story, its closed off completely. you might be thinking of the exec board room or something but the actual Presidential Suit is off limits still.
---
I got freaked out for like a second, then i bashed it with a sledgehammer multiple times until it stopped moving. Kinda like my reaction to spiders in real life.
---
I got ultracite mod plans from the Scorchbeast queen in the Watoga area.
---
I only ever see Nukes in 2 places, Fissure site prime and whitesprings. I wonder if different ultracite mods drop at different fissure sites
---
I wish I could give this more than one thumb up. If I can fever dream for a moment here, I'd also love if there was a way to trade excess plans (and perk cards) at vendors, to get a random one you don't have yet. 
---
Lvl does changes the budget
---
Watch the video again.
---
That's because they are not wired. Meaning you don't wire them. You don't connect them. You just place them and they will turn on in the evening if they are close to a node
---
I just assumed the were hung over on nuka dark rum 
---
While common sense says the prices suck, the fact they haven't dropped yet means someone out there is actually paying those prices. Also, don't forget that the MTX store is how they are giving us free DLC down the line. I'll put up with a crappy unfair MTX store if it means I get free content in exchange, since I don't have to pay a penny for MTX.
---
Mods should be like Blueprints. Once you acquire and read/open them your character should unlock the ability to remember it. The way they have them now is fucking dumb.
---
Choosing the category and choosing the card are two separate acts- the game just does a really shitty job of explaining and displaying that.
---
This is almost certainly the heart of OP's problem - Bethesda is completely covered in tickets. You opened 4 tickets for one problem - how many others did the same? Assuming they eventually get to all 4 of them, they have to spend that extra time determining whether the other 3 are valid or duplicates?
---
Not necessarily saying you were wrong to submit so many, but the company's flooded and it just takes time to wade through it all and serve everyone. 
---
You could do that in New Vegas too but you had the added bonus of stacking the gold bars from Dead Money, lol
---
The option is kinda difficult to notice, it should be down along the bottom of the screen. Just try pressing Y (triangle?) on every generator and power connector.
---
Also note that some conduits (the pipe lookin things) cant be connected with wires, only to other conduits physically. Of course none of this information is in-game.
---
It still works. I was running Watoga last night. It was an issue where I got drops a majority of the time but about a third were missing the Legendary weapon/armor.
---
pretty sure that was a bug mate, not supposed to be able to use any PA till 25 that I'm aware of. You can use the Chassis at like level 10 or whatever but AFAIK there are no armor parts below level 25.
---
Short letter.
---
I've still not used the first one I have, the blade is my backup melee weapon.  Since I'm a pistol build at the moment, the voice of set is a decent pistol.  I wish it would indicate how much extra damage it does to robots though.  That bonus alone makes me want to use it in watoga and a couple other bot heavy areas.
---
The only time I encountered Mothman, I was wandering around the woods looking for food one night. I look up and see this shadowy figure with huge red eyes so I start walking towards it. It shoots into the sky in a trail of smoke and quick as hell. Needless to say I noped out of there really quick.
---
Cool
---
so if i‚Äôm understanding correctly, since i have a level 10 auto pipe rifle, the next craftable will be level 20?
---
As someone that is a heavy weapons explosive build I use Mininukes all the time. Originally I used them on the queen but found out about her resistance to explosives, OK  I thought let me modify my strategy. 2 shot mirv. While everyone is going after the queen I'm taking out majority of the add ons in the area. One or two of them takes out anything that comes across the battlefield. I understand it lags but you can get the same issue or worse if people don't deal with the additional enemies that show up. If people can manage both with no issues I put away the mirv and switch to my prime explosive 50 and my 2 shot explosive mini gun. 
---
i'd like to have 2 favorite wheels. one for weapons and one for meds/aid. i have a crazy amount of medx/psycho/buffout that i'll likely never use because i cant fit it in my favorites and unless you eat it before a fight (cus that happens) you have to stop mid combat and take a bunch of damage to find it. especially since perk cards dont work in stash and you have to carry literally every med/food/drink you own on your person to keep the weight low
---
Nice man, good solution.
---
No worries, thanks for the response.  When I took the herd mentality mutation and use the class freak perk the damage reduction from barbarian goes away.  When I take class freak off and reload my dr from barb starts working again.
---
I have seen some people speculate that is has to do with class freak reducing the special hit from herd mentality by a non whole number causing problems.  I am not sure if that is the issue or not.
---
Well, I was something like lvl 14 at the time, so I probably wouldn't have gotten any of that loot anyway, but that's good to know :-)
---
I thought that the mothman was bugged because he was hitting me from two directions at the same time
---
Silly me, they were two vengeful mothman lol
---
Last night I was playing my alt. I'm level 9 in Flatwoods when a level 19 comes up and starts shooting me. I'm taking damage giving thumbs down. His lvl 20 friend shows up to and when I loose a 1/4 HP I shoot back to realize passive is on. Turn it off slowly (needs button on console) and now down to half health. Use a stimpack, enter vats, and unload my .44. He goes down and his friend comes over now lit up red to. Not taking any chances I do the same to him. They both seek revenge so I crouch and kill them again as soon as I saw them. This repeated a few more times with one of them before he invites me to party. Turns out they're just noobs who were 'trying to get my attention', didn't know about pacifist or respawning with revenge. I made sure to explain to them the pvp mechanics and gave them 200 caps (a little more than I got off of them). Offered to pass on my workshop when I logged off but they didn't message back. Sorry guys, but you had to learn. 
---
So.. are the conduits I'm using wrong? Or is that not close enough? I literally put one as close to a hanging light as humanly possible and nothing happened. 
---
Bethesda bad praise Geraldo! I can't wait for good game company Obsidianos to release New Vegas II it's gonna be epic üòé
---
I'm lvl 193...I don't think it does
---
O can tell you why I didn't, theu wouldn't go on, I assumed (incorrectly it seems) the listed requirements in flux etc were needed ....as is implied by listing them.
---
So I stored them to gather flux....
---
idk if its bugged or not but I have a few plans it wont let me learn, so I assume I already know them, but when I go to the workbench they don't show up
---
confederate hat is one of them
---
Of course it will come to Game Pass. Microsoft/Xbox has always been tight with Bethesda. Plus other Bethesda games have been on the service already. 
---
I'm thinking it has something to do with the way they handled mod crafting. Since mods you remove from your weapon get autoscrapped, I guess marking them as junk was the only solution they had to make that possible. Why we aren't allowed to keep mods I don't agree with but w/e
---
High Int DOES let you build much better Power Armor, so there is that. but that is a one time thing.
---
Digested Goo gets auto scrapped too. It sucks.
---
They havent said anything about it to my knowledge but there is this

Might help you out.

I mean just new armor since ballistic fiber is kind of annoying 
---
I‚Äôm a man of important words.
---
The glitch here is that when you move your camp there's a small chance (roughly 10%) that EVERYTHING in your camp will duplicate. Just delete the dupes and it's fixed.
---
Yes to this, but I also want raider decor. Can I get blood stained floors and walls please? Also corpses I can hang on walls and from ceilings made from the mystery meat you get from that one perk card would be a nice touch. Same for heads on spikes. 
---
Raider tents and a replacement for the roof tiles using that cloth material most raider camps have. 
---
The first raider PA is for sure 15.
---
Confederate hat ? Me too! I can‚Äôt learn it even though I never had it before.. I dropped it 
---
That bug has been known  for a long time.   That is vault 63 and not much to see in there until they release it.
---
Can you screenshot it? Maybe the community can help you figure it out!
---
I wish they would too. Tho would also wish people didn't nuke whitesprings cause found a nice tucked away spot that's flat with lush grass I wanna build on
---
It changes up to lvl 50. Being lvl 193 you won't be able to notice this. 
---
Lvl 193... Djezus! Nice.

This sub has less than 200K followers. The only way this would get to a broader audience is if it just happens to get picked up by the media to write an article, and the spin would be that be that how Bethesda is ignoring tickets, only barely mentioning that someone picked it up from Reddit, then asking the question about what are all the people who don‚Äôt use reddit are supposed to do.  
---
There is no way doing this intentionally would have a positive impact.  
---
The mole miners are what's left of the original human miners of ash heap. They escaped the nukes by living underground in the mines but over time mutated by radiation and pollution of the area.
---
The flatwood monster could be zetan in origin or a totally different alien species that has visited earth.
---
I‚Äôm having that same exact issue I got 1 to drop early so out of every 3 I‚Äôm getting 1 every other time it‚Äôs a flare gun 
---
Anyone know if the Bethesda rep that has been commenting on things here on Reddit has said that he will bring this to the attention of the Dev's?  I mean this is a pretty big segment of the game content that is in a pretty bad state.  I could totally be fine with the damage if the condition issue was fixed.  The fact that even with 200% durability I can't get though 1 encounter using a laser weapon without it breaking is pretty bad.  I would also love to use the heavy energy weapons but again they are meh.  As others of stated plasma weapons have it issues causing their damage to be horrible because they hardly ever actually do damage, yet you get these as a 'reward' for the enclave events like they should be worthy of being a 'reward'?!?!
---
I say this because I've been rocking the exact same base since lvl 103 and my base budget hasn't moved in 90 lvls.
---
Can i interest you in four hundred and eleven copies of "Mole-Miner's Gauntlet?"
---
Sorry- sad, but true. 
---
I thought at first mine had been deleted too, but then I found it under "All tickets". Did you check there?
---
I had issues with that map as well, I used 7 of them and I had 7 left. They would not be consumed so eventually I dropped them.
---
there is a hard spawn in the thunder mountain power plant its on a bench next to one of the power armor stations
---
Oh yeah, sorry, modify* mode. I forgot it's specifically called 2 different things. 
---
I'm definitely going to try to look *very* closely and see if I can find any triangle options! 
---
Know what else is a sign of room temp IQ?  People who keeping scrapping their mods when it can be avoided by having enough of the unbulked junk needed to craft/repair, that the mods can be scrapped for, which tends to mainly be steel.  So if you poitlessly bulk all your steel thinking it takes up less weight or you recklessly burn through your reserve with no consideration to your mods, it's entirely your fault.
---
In regards to hardened mass, it is stupid that most of the junk items used to craft are protected while this one isn't; however, seeing as you shouldn't have much else in the way of junk from a nuke zone, at least not enough to warrant scrapping everything so you can carry more, there's no reason to scrap your junk and hardened mass, making this just as much your fault as the devs.
---
Ok...I'll buy that then.
---
Steamy, steamy wind. I read your comment and was like wtf is steam in your sales? Oh.
---
How is it half?  When I look at my Super Sledge with the Heating Coil, it's like 280 dmg and 15 elec. dmg.  Maybe I just don't understand how that works.
---
I support MTX fully but when they are done well. I don't have a problem with them being in Triple A games. I've put about ¬£80 into Ghost Wildlands, ¬£500+ in Warframe, ¬£100+ into SMITE but I just have a feeling bethesda have this F2P idea going when they looked into pricing and items for their store rather than other full price games. I understand the huge popularlity of Warframe and Fortnite when it comes to F2P and MTX and I bet bethesda looked into it to help gather info how to do this for their own store but I think they got too stcuk into the F2P mentality, just how I see it though

Bethesda was so blatantly trying to make Tiny Tina... but they did it in such a way that she wasn't fun, just horribly obnoxious and grating.
---
Maybe she wouldn't have been so bad if there were other personalities/robots/npc's that you interact with on a regular basis, but being that she has \[what feels like\] more lines of dialog than even MODUS... super annoying.
---
Useless ski sword? I wasn't building a melee spec and that thing murdalized everything in my path for a good 30 or so levels!
---
I'm not sure if clicking really fast helped or not as it only ever showed me Lead Ore (4) in the top left. But I walked out with 257 or, or 640 lead scrap all together. Took 5-10 minutes, no server hopping or anything lol. Great method, can confirm as best I've used so far. 
---
Hood way to advertise yourself as a duper.
---
I have attempted to submit my request three times now. Each time I received a message that the ticket was submitted. Each time I've then received the following email from Bethesda:
---
&gt; Your attempt to submit a replacement request for the Fallout 76 Power Armor Edition Canvas Bag DID NOT COMPLETE. It appears that the upload of the your Proof of Purchase attachment was cancelled prematurely. This is usually caused when the ticket submittal window is closed before the user reaches the  ‚ÄúYour Ticket Has Been Submitted‚Äù screen. 
---
&gt; Therefore, we are unable to process your request at this time.
---
&gt; We kindly ask that you resubmit your request.
---
Just tried submitting a 4th time, this time using my phone instead of my laptop. Waiting to see if I get the denial message again.
---
Selling a broken product is against the law....
---
I just looked too. Mine were gone with no reply ever. They had moved to Feedback section, but would go away less than a second after clicking on that section. If I clicked back to it, I was able to  quickly click into my tickets and add a comment as an update, which put them back into Recent (still waiting on an agent).
---
This is terrible customer service. Pretty disappointed.
---
I find they are easier to fight indoors. They don't seem to know what to do when you pop in and out of a doorway for cover. So I just strafe behind the wall when the beam goes off then pop out and wear them down. 
---
If you have the plans, yes.

Any type of stash is tied to the player looking at it, no matter where it is or who placed it
---
Eeeekkk!!
---
It's super super finicky but can be done (though not everywhere, that I've found)
---
So something that can help is switching between the shorter one and the longer one. Adjust where your character is (closeness as well as height) and where you're looking. Sometimes placement will work in a slightly different area, so try all snapping points on the general area of where you want your support.
---
My biggest issue now is the clipping error, because the not supported thing can, generally, be bullied into doing what you want in this case. Good luck!
---
mothmen are freaky to fight. and they die freaky.
---
i wish they were more common 
---
RDR2 has a compelling single player game and the online is basically a bonus
---
Something that 76 should have been to 4 imo
---
 I thought pacifist mode automatically turns off when you are retaliating, that's a huge pain in the butt to go through this laggy menu and wait for it to load and switch it off, so inconvenient. If they had better weapons you probably have died before exiting the menu. 
---
If only there was a way to get feeback before the game released? /S
---
In English I'm p. sure it's the same voice actress. She KINDA sounds like Amethyst from Steven Universe but I know it's not her.
---
I‚Äôm so upset! My first mothman experience was so lame. He comes barreling by like an obese old man trying to get to the liquor store before it closes like ‚ÄúGETOUTOFMYWAY‚Äù and I tell my teammate I think a mothman just ran by so we killed it easy peasy and that was that. Same thing the next time. For some reason, they don‚Äôt fight me back. Or fly away. They‚Äôre always on the ground. Dumb. 
---
Good point. For most, this won‚Äôt even be a contest. Makes me wish I could upgrade ALL of the quest-granted items.
---
I've mostly done just the story quests, with some side, daily and event quests thrown in - I'm toward the point where I can launch a nuke, and I'm level 42ish. Without spoiling things too much for you, things can get a bit hairy as you get toward the cranberry bogs and the bunkers in the East and Northeast portions of the map. There are a lot of high level players doing other things in that portion of the map, which makes the enemy levels scale up, and the enemies are just generally tougher (gulpers and anglers &gt; mirelurks, much more frequent scorchbeast attacks). Be prepared to have to run in and out of areas to complete objectives. 
---
Wait, I have this mission and I have no idea where it came from or why?  Lol, what's the deal?  Usually I read and listen to everything since I love the environmental storytelling but I must have missed this one.
---
Hell, for me the regular recon Scopes are broken.  They worked initially as I have them on two pistols and a rifle, but now they no longer seem to tag enemies.
---
I sure hope you're both right on this. Everything is pointing too it not being that simple, but if it is. Good.
---
I have the Power armour edition, so I've been through hell and back with this game and its not even been half a year haha. I would LOVE to support Bethesda more with the game if they can prove they are willing to put their damnest into making this a great game, I know its their first solo ran MMO but still. I can see they aren't sure how to deal with a Microtrans action store yet. Hopefully they'll tone it down a tad
---
Lol 
---
Yup. I out a lunch box stash near my cook fire, a dumpster near my junk collector, and a traditional stash near my trading platform.
---
Build your base next to an environmental container, not one you build
---
Well that's the smart fix. I just build a mansion with the extra materials, so now I'm stuck til I run out of water :)

Change my mind.

lol, nukes are a world event... sorry but you don't own a nuke zone. Not to mention low levels can't hardly pump out enough damage to "steal" these mobs. Can't imagine the self-entitlement it takes to think you own an entire part of the world map for 2 hours and that no one else is allowed to be there.
---
and if that were the actual tactic the employees wouldn't be in the know, the people who handle tickets are just pawns for the company, they would have to be kept ignorant from the higher ups to be released from intent, otherwise you couldn't feint that it was incompetence 
---
I guess we all forgot the the nukes were private affairs. If a group of high levels feel that their speed is being threatened by a lowbie then maybe they need to try a different game
---
Sorry, you're wrong. This is just terrible design and/or a complete oversight on their part due to getting this MVP out of the door. There's simply no viable excuse, especially when items with far less value already mentioned have protections in place.
---
One level 9 vs two 19&amp;20 over what course of time?
---
Yeah sure they are new and only wanted your attention ;)
---
There should be a place to look this up.
---
&gt;All future DLC's is gunna be free, patch every few weeks,

Assuming the game isn't killed off.
---
wrong... I can kill ppl easily with my TSE shotty or my TSE Gauss Rifle. Takes anywhere from a few to a few dozen shots depending on their overall health, resists, armor, and perks... I do it any time someone tries to harass me. Doesn't happen a lot because i"m in the high 90s now but every once in a while a 12 year old will just shoot at me or try to whack me with his hammer non stop because I'm killing things too fast or something... So I just get a safe distance (a few steps back with the shotty or pretty much any distance with the Gauss) and keep passive on and shoot them a few times. I don't even think they can get revenge on me because I'm in passive mode. But I've not tested it that much and don't care that much to be honest. 
---
I don't want to participate but I am intrigued... will there be screenshots/video?
---
Ahhhh!!! 
---
Let's be honest.  Both basebuilders and non are just exploiting the system.  They're boosting the level of the mobs for an area  that has an excessive respawn and close mob dismemberment.   The true fix is one you'll hate and that's just fix the area altogether.  Keep the mobs capped at LVL 9 so they stay as the golfer type so the youngins can quest and have everyone else find a new loophole to exploit.
---
Aim for the head.
---
unfortunately the weird uptimes for the B.E.T.A pushed me away 
---
I just had the same reaction. All of a sudden, I realized that I'm not insane. I really did have those mods! They weren't figments of my imagination, even though I couldn't find them anywhere!!
---
As sad as this is...because, just..why; however, its part of the game, and there's even a perk card for more damage to other players' CAMP's.  Given that, I agree with another poster's comment on being able to beef up your CAMP. improve defense mechanisms etc...it would be awesome to be able to plant land mines for hostile players once they initiate destruction, BOOM&gt; haha. Then we also get a CAMP cam that can film it all.

I like it. It says so much with so little. And I get a strong sense of appreciation for this game and the community around it.

You‚Äôve clearly never played the real fallout games . This is more of if Skyrim timetraveled and turned into a strictly survivor game .. only thing that resembles anything about fallout is the lore and well that‚Äôs about it
---
&gt; This bitch's hair looks like a damn swiss cake roll 
---
Ok you need to calm down. I almost choked on apple juice xD and I agree 100%. Huge struggle I have (and will ALWAYS) have with Fallout is, I grew up listening to Green Day, Black Veil Brides, Paramore, Guns and Roses, etc. Hell, My dad sung Green Day songs to me as a kid to get me to fall asleep, so like I have this huge "Emo" (dare I call it that) Rock  Look IRL and I know I'll have get this in Fallout cause, its not that theme, this was all later on during the 80s-90s upwards but still. Just gimme cuteness, I dont want this weird ass hair and omega basic hair. UGH
---
i dont know if i'll follow through but i'd like to nuke vault 76 and flatwoods area for my first nuke. the only 2 nuke spots i've ever seen are whitesprings and fissure prime.
---
please allow 4-6 months for this to arrive in your bethesda account

Garment from the mistress of mystery quest with the eye of ra gives like... +30 stealth bonus.

I was originally going to report it to eBay, but the last time I did that about soemthing like this it was a pain trying to explain to them why it was bad and the company it belonged to wouldn't be happy about it.

really ? he is weak as hell he only spawns as high as level 30
---
Damn I didn't know. Thanks 
---
I had a whole set of raider PA scavenged from various locations. All lvl 15 till i was lvl 25 and got the excavator.
---
A buddy of mine got a full Ultracite set randomly in his inventory. 
---
The rewards from the technical data I bet, was thinking you had another farm somewhere
---
Mine is under "all tickets" and the last ipdate was two weeks ago by me asking about the complimentary 500 atoms they said they would add in a few days. I still havent gotten the atoms.
---
Myself and two of the people I play with have experienced this. We are all above level 50 and have max level T-60. Yesterday I went to change the mod on my T-60 and my chest piece has dropped to level 40. After a bit of checking it happened to 3 of us. One player had every piece that had a mod in it drop to level 40.   I posted about it last night but for some reason it got down votes?
---
Not a movie, but Generation Kill is tops for me, followed by Full Metal Jacket.
---
OK thanks I will check it again.
---
AFAIK, range builds are all outclassed damage-wise by melee, but you can make them viable for most enemies around your level, at least to the point I'm at in the game (level 42, facing enemies up to level 62 usually). I alternate between a long-range hunting rifle and a lever-action rifle to balance my ammo, with the Sword of Bastet as my melee when enemies charge. Perks for rifles are in Perception, and Agility also offers boosts for attacking from stealth and ignoring armor. 
---
I'm really digging those modern angles and the open floorplan. 
---
I tried but failed to wait long enough for some of these quest items.  At least my All Rise is lv50 so all is well.  I messed up early on too, ended up with a lv5 Somerset Special when I was close to lv15 at that time.
---
The service rifle wouldn‚Äôt make sense as it was a pre war design modified by the NCR.
---
It would be like giving Russian troops a kar98
---
Same here, found a random Raider PA part in my stuff, had just done Monster Mash a little earlier and assumed it was just shit loot....
---
Agree with the Energy weapon damage, less of a bug, more of a "balance issue", will add to Quality of Life.
---
I got full set of Raider's Power Armor for completing some quest, but don't remember which one (Rosie's?). Maybe that way?
---
Nope, just a good crew that looks out for me. One of them got the initiate paint plans... saved it for me. Made my day. 
---
We try to do the same all around. Folks (like you) help us out, so we keep an eye out to return the favor. 
---
Didn't know that it affects others nearby, but yes it does make friendly bots glow/outline in red too.
---
Did the backpacks in the creation club add additional carry weight? 
---
Yeah I have a really nice melee build going, can pretty much one tap everything. But it‚Äôs getting stale
---
When‚Äôs the last time you played ? Last year? 
---
The rumour of lootboxes is a little premature speculation. All anyone saw was Lunchboxes that were datamined which could be anything from a camp decoration, to maybe a container with food and drink inside, or maybe lootboxes (which I doubt to be honest). Until we hear anything from Bethesda about them it's pointless to speculate as we have literally zero information other than a datamined image.
---
If you're in xbox and decide to do it. I have a mutants crossbow with 10% extra damage you can have for it
---
It's also been brought up a ton of times.. wish one of the devs would comment on this so we know that they are tracking and potentially working on it. Ya chainsaws and rippers need a buff too. I was so disappointed when I found out rippers just stink.. they were such a cool weapon in old fallout games. 
---
You get this from completing Rosie's questline
---
Same stuff happened to me and I had to just start over, unfortunately.
---
Irl money (at least in the USA) is made out of a paper like cloth material 
---
What does that cow do? Can it produce food or something? I have the plan but I'm having second-thought building it.
---
Basically: Rifles in fall out are what humans are in DnD. they are already good enough that i literally told my kid last night playing with my other kid to stop using the syringer and get a hunting rifle and loot 308 til he can use a 50 cal(from the bathroom while taking a shit over hearing them argue about needing ammo)
---
You get this from completing the BOS questline
---
Hang on, had you recently done Rosies missions? It's a reward for that....
---
Aside from the double dipping pistol/rifle from pipe weapons, explosive is technically a double dip right now. It flags the weapon now as an explosive allowing the perk to affect the base damage of the weapon.
---
But it might be even worse then that and triple dip. Currently "Explosive" does that following.
---
 - Flag weapon as explosive
---
 - Based on base damage/dps of weapon add AOE damage on impact
---
Normally, you'd expect the explosives perk to only affect the flat bonus explosive damage. Typically this number isn't that large. In Fallout 4 the number is a flat 15 damage. In Fallout 76 it is calculated based on dps. Slower weapons have larger damages while faster weapons have lower damages. So if we assume 50 damage bullet w/ +15 Explosive damage, we would expect 65 total damage. Then we would also expect when Explosives perk 5 is considered it would 50 w/ +30 Explosive damage for 80 damage. 
---
However, since the explosive legendary mod is flagging the weapon as an explosive as well. The explosives perk modifies base damage. So we end up with 100 base damage from explosives. Then the explosive damage is calculated on the dps. Let's make some assumptions that there isn't a diminishing returns on the scale but there very well may be but, for simplicity sake we can skip it for now since, the total explosive damage added per weapon is still being figured out.(At least I am working on it and it seems like it will take forever due to rarity and the fact they are highly coveted) 
---
So with that 100 we could assume a +30 would be picked for base explosive damage. THEN, the explosives perk would calculate the damage putting it at 160.
---
So we expected 80 and received 160 which appears to be just double as the explosive perk would imply when looking at general damage, but it likely this was not intended at all.
---
This gets more bonkers for each damage modifier since the more modifiers will increase the base damage, then the new base explosive damage will then receive its more modifiers.
---
**MORE** modifiers(some listed as **BONUS**) are the biggest culprit of amplifying the double dipping issue but is the intended way to increase your damage.
---
Just so you can get an idea of how those perks are working. All calculate the same way. Let's assume you are affected by the following:
---
 - Bloody Mess Rank 3(+15% More Damage)
---
 - Tenderizer Rank 3(+7% More Damage)
---
 - Nerd Rage Rank 3(+20% Damage)
---
 - Explosives Rank 5(+100% Damage)
---
 - Any Weapon Type Rank 3(+20% Damage)
---
 - Any Expert Weapon Type Rank 3(+20% Damage)
---
 - Any Master Weapon Type Rank 3(+20% Damage)
---
All of the additive percentages = +180% Damage
---
With out 50 base damage gun that is = 140
---
Then we calculate bloody mess as its multiplicative = 161
---
Then we calculate tenderizer = 172
---
Then assuming that 50 base damage = 15 explosive damage, we would get a base damage of 52 explosive damage. We will round down to 50 explosive damage base for this example. Which is roughly the same process we just went through with base weapon damage. So we end up with 172 bullet damage and 172 explosive damage.
---
So as you can see the initial ratio of bullet damage to explosive damage was 50-15, 77% was from the weapon and 23% was from the explosive mod. We end up with almost 50% damage from the bullet and 50% damage from the explosive.
---
This gets much worse with bloodied combined with adrenal reaction and worse yet before calculating stealth attacks &amp; crits which are more damage multipliers.
---
Should be all rifles. I don't use automatic so I can't completely confirm it. 
---
And what‚Äôs ironic is energy weapons definitely pop up more commonly in the latter parts of Fallout 76 and its endgame. Yet they suck compared to previous entries. I really want to do an energy weapons build for my next character too, but not in this state. 
---
It's hard not to believe it's on purpose that **things we must grind for is easier to lose, than things that we could afford losing.**
---
It's hard to believe it's not intentional.
---
I‚Äôve renuked prime, it just starts the event again. She was dead when the second nuke hit thanks to good players putting in work but I wonder if it‚Äôd just spawn two at once?
---
I meant a second set.
---
It's only 1 str. Doesn't it weigh a few pounds itself?
---
Truth. I lost an x-01 jetpack. 
---
The plasma gatlings do decent damage, they burn down scorch conquerors in about the same time as a good melee weapon, but one will break after three cores (assuming you used weapons artisan when repairing/building it), so I carry a mix of plasma and laser gatlings (which are more durable but do less dps).  An ultracite laser gatling, plasma flamer, and legendary Grognaks axe are my goto problem solvers (along with a few nuka grenades and an orbital strike for special occassions).  Maintenance for those items can be a pain at times, always needing circuits, springs, nuclear material, copper, and the like means I spend a fair amount of time farming repair/ammo components but such is life.
---
AH does facilitate trading, but it doesn't really fit well in the game. It's more immersive to stumble upon a camp and buy stuff there :)

I‚Äôm pretty certain that means it‚Äôll be their health when all effects wear off, like poison or something

theres a mod that protects anything you've favorited until they make it an official game change

U get a complete raider set.    I thought it was just a chassis reward but it was a whole raider PA setup
---
I wont lie me and my wife played with a 10 year old on Christmas day who just got the game. best time we had.  Kids say the darnedest things.  
---
Grey damage is the total damage that hasnt been applied i believe
---
Saying no is healthy. There is no harm in the thumbs down emote. It's my go-to when someone asks to trade. 
---
On a side note I like the finger bang taunt emote, I use this to say hello.
---
Or stop leeching and earn your legendaries.
---
Explain your sources
---
I'm a 55-year-old woman IRL and currently a level 44. 
---
You clearly don‚Äôt play this game , be gone with your ill informed blasphemy 
---
Have you seen its face though? Definitely looks more mothlike than owl. Got that party tooter nose-thing going (idk names for insect anatomy. Proboscis? Maybe?)
---
I was more talking shit about the really lackluster B.E.T.A. we got. I don't blame you for not getting in the beta as the times were pretty abnormal.
---
I am in support of all these ideas except #9. I love that the only humans we meet are other players. It wouldn't break the game for me if they do add human NPCs (from one of the other vaults perhaps?) but I really like the loneliness of this game. 
---
Can you pm me your discord server? Are you on PS4 too? Thanks!
---
I feel you on point #9. 
---
I feel like I‚Äôm playing a less well-written System Shock with the number of times I‚Äôve listened to holotapes/broadcasts only to find the speaker dead. 
---
I‚Äôd even settle for raiders. There are camps and dead raiders aplenty, but the world just feels kind of dull with people in Vault Boy masks and underwear the only humans you encounter. 
---
I think OP might mean a stash were people can place items instead of dropping in baggie.  
---
even if its not a feature. it will be the same since you can manually port block people from joining u in windows firewall
---
Definitely agree -- but whats likely happening is the person the ticket is assigned to is waiting for a response from someone higher up who was probably on holiday, and they are waiting for some kind of approval from finance or waiting to hear back from the company that actually manufactures the helm or something of the sort.  Communication back to the customer is the major fault here, they need to be better at it -- but to claim its intentional just to hope it "goes away" sounds like more of a projection of the posters habits rather than actual business practice.
---
What's the point if you don't have one of the duped explosive double shots? 
---
Is geebus finally bringing his deadbeat dad ass back?
---
It's possible to get it to 100% AP [By equipping Eye of Ra, the whole dress isn't needed for the enhance, just the eye](/spoiler)
---
Not really. You simply don't punish employees for dragging out tickets, that's it. You don't need to have a meeting about it, create any policy, tell any employees or any of that.
---
You just reward the behavior you want and punish the behavior you don't want.
---
is there enough customers with messed up $200 helmets, $50 canvas bags? how many want refunds?
---
if they started a thread/forum specifically for it would they have enough for class action instead of small claims as individuals? 
---
There don't seem to be, the most I've seen was 3, and they'll all drop 1* Nocturnal Wood Right Leg anyway lol.
---
Edited. Thanks! :)
---
Ur dum
---
Back to them insane prices xD
---
It‚Äôs somehow in the fertilizer maker resource.
---
Until he figures out carrying 50 stims is the reason he's always encumbered.  
---
When you look at it closely it does, but at a glance from far away it looks like a fat owl to me.
---
This isn't for in game grouping, this is just so people can notify others about worlds where it's been nuked, they can join and leave as they like.  The best method for farming it is just going there and doing it.  Each time a new person shows up the ghouls spawn anew, or if the spawn timer has expired (I think 10-15 minutes).  
---
Nope :)
---
It's the fertilizer resource collector under resources.  It makes a cow and collects the waste.
---
Happened to me too I'm just chilling at my camp and hear my turrets start firing so I grab my gun to protect my flamingo and turns out to be a lvl 20 being chased by a albino deathclaw. Killed the flamingo humper and let the little guy in to heal and repair. We start talking and he showed me his camp and it's a small open air one with a bed and cooking station in the middle of a tick spawn.  Barfed a crap ton of extra plans I had on him and took him home shopping to find a new place that wasn't a dump and after a few he found one he liked so helped him make a nice cabin. Now anytime I'm on he always chills and follows me around as I look for a new spot cause tired of my flamingo being harassed
---
Rifleman build.  
---
I use a vats rifleman build.  Only thing that gives me issues is the scortch queen.  
---
I have no TSE so im shit out of luck on her.  
---
Ur lucky, every other time i tp back to base i have confrontarion with the ham shanker after hes begun tearing apart my base
---
What's generation kill about?
---
Full metal Jacket gave me the enemy at the gate feel, just completely showing it all from basic  training to killing enemies on the battlefield.  
---
Very real and brutal 
---
The hotfix yesterday was just for silos... They made no mention of fixing anything else.

---
Some sort of internet database.
---
Because the people making the decisions for the store strategy believe that predatory tactics are an okay thing. They're not, don't buy into it.
---
I run into female players fairly often on xbox.
---
I would also assume that after being in a Vault for 25 years, there would have been someone in there that knew how to do their own damn hair in different styles. makeup is easy, but hair? I dunno how to do that.
---
Its like there was a North Korea hair chart kinda deal in that damn vault. Want braided pigtails or ponytail, or hair past the shoulder? nope, not on the list you Pinko.
---
I concur with OP
---
Go to the lighthouse, and do any events there
---
Maybe they could just add the old music they licensed for fallout 4 or nv in 76. There was literally tons of music in previous fall outs not this classic public domain shit. 
---
If 76 is really just 4 with multiplayer then i want my sheldon allman, cole porter and roy brown back
---
Wasnt all the winter stuff overpriced. Im confused.
---
Process was pretty protracted here. I submitted a request, sent in a screenshot of my email receipt...they rejected it, without even explaining what other kind of proof I was supposed to provide.
---
Eventually I did it again slightly different and it worked. Says 4-6 months, though. Yikes.
---
It horrifies me that if we're unsure all we can do is buy them and wait to see... some of my alts which never craft have strangely learnt a lot of plans. :(
---
I had no idea they have eggs, and I had killed a handful before 66, and another handful since getting to 79.
---
I have just been going with whatever 3* legendaries have the effects that suit me. The 20% weapon weight reduction pieces are super handy since rifles don't have a perk for that.
---
I want to find/buy different musical holotapes/discs in the wasteland that can be put into my jukebox. Bethesda, pls let me make a mixtape to play in my base. 
---
I can get an hair cut like that for 5$ irl, why would someone pay 8 for it in a game
---
I saw that hairstyle and thought, "My Atoms will easily be saved for another day!"
---
I also found it amusing that it was a limited offer. Yes, please hurry and replace it with something I might buy.
---
Sorry about my grammar, but maybe if you hate the game (which I have no problem with, I personally don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs amazing) you should ya know leave the sub considering you‚Äôve posted about 5 angry reviews, let‚Äôs be real Bethesda has never listened to their audience so why do you think they‚Äôll start now, instead of just leaving you put people down for having a opinion 
---
It's nice to see all the counterparts laid out like that.  Its a strong arguement for a perk.  Too bad it'll smack right down in perception which is already so easy to fill up with actual damage perks.  9 points for 60% damage, 3 points for armor pen, 3 points for concentrated fire or glow sight.. 
---
If there was a legendary effect, that would be nice.. although obviously it'll take the place of another one as well.  At least there would be an option.
---
Also it could be used for when you're overweight and want to slap on a bunch of perks just so you can fast travel to sell... 
---
Thanks for your support, clean reinstall of my gpu driver fixed it for me.
---
OMG i completely forgot about that, i can load the spotify app on xbox and just make my own playlist with music from fo4 
---
That's kinda disappointing, wanted to make a "free loot" box for people.
---
Praise be to the mothman.
---
It#s because you need these particular parts (and not scrap) to build certain things (like baseball grenades, molotovs, deathclaw gloves, assaultron helmets). Taht's why they're not autoscrap.
---
That said, I still don't get why hardened mass is not protected.
---
Eh, average it over 20 players. Even that 7k wouldn't amount to much. But yeah that player isn't legit, and clearly there could be an upper limit.
---
if you move your crossair onto something on which wires can be connected you get an option in your Hud to do so.    
---
On Xbox for example it is the button (Y) while in build mode.  
---
There will be a visible wire which you can than connect to a generator/pylon etc.  again with the (Y) button.  
---
I would guess its the triangle button on PS4.  Dont know PC
---
I like it for the +1 strength. I call it my fast travel sword. Scrapped all my junk, still 3 or 4 pounds over encumbered. Equip Black Diamond and carry capacity goes up by 5. Now I can fast travel.
---
Make a new issues and feedback thread, please.
---
/u/VaultOfDaedalus
---
Just farm blackwater mine for mole miners, super easy barely an inconvenience
---
I'm not guaranteeing this will work but I've seen the Mothman two out of two times I've walked this path. Head to the Whitespring lookout tower south of the resort, then walk toward Riverside Manor (Order of Mysteries house).  He's jumped me as I was heading down the mountain both times. Beware that there is a fissure site in between these locations so you may also get a scorchbeast on your ass.
---
The only players ive met in game without an explosive weapon were my friends and that's because I bought them each a copy of the game and was there when they first started, they quit playing after only two days
---
Yeah that's what I meant. Was hoping to have it and put up a sign so people can get free water and stuff I don't need anymore (I have at least 10 bulk gears and 10 bulk springs I want to get rid of)
---
eso announces all the stuff coming to the store for the whole month as well as any limited ones the dates it will be up then gone.
---
In the video he show cases it.
---
Using a standard SMG medium range I get 40% hit rate on a scorched. Once the first bullet hits the second always hits right after. 
---
Not on xbox but that's really nice of you and I appreciate the tip! 
---
But that's the latest patch isn't it?
---
Cant have threads listing issues and problems caused by patches if there's been no patches hey.
---
Not sure yesterdays hot fix counts really as it would be a very very short list wouldn't it?
---
Awesome, I'll look Into that. Thanks!!
---
Neat... Try...
---
* Exit/enter the PA?
---
* Exit/enter a different PA?
---
* Enter the PA, open Pipboy, remove helmet, exit Pipboy, then re-equip helmet?
---
* Exit the PA, remove helmet from chassis, enter PA, equip helmet?
---
Unpopular opinion: game features and quirks that make senseless farming from overwhelmingly exploited areas are good things, not bad.
---
I just can't feel much sympathy for someone who's entire in-game existence consists of wandering from one groomed flower bed to another searching for their ninety fifth Legendary Diseased Charred Feral Ghoul.  That the game encourages this is bad enough.  That you guys do it definitely hurts my experience.  Try to level up a new character to experiment with new builds -- Whitespring quests (the Order of Mystery sends you here, for example) are almost impossible to play as intended without an end game build due to all the roaming high level spawns.
---
Think it's funny when someone shuts the door behind them haha
---
Not sure really, probably will stop because it's annoying rolling up to a locked camp
---
Name 1 ‚Äúgame breaking bug‚Äù plz . The worst thing I‚Äôve had is the messenger event dying over and over on fire , hardly gamebreaking 
---
Why? It's stickied and sorted by new. It's still getting attention.
---
Basically its good form to leave workbenches, beds, and stash boxes open.  Locking up resources like extractors and water purifiers is generally acceptable because hey, its your resources.  As far as the different lock levels go, the only difference is how many resources it takes to lock things up, though its not a huge difference if you learned to compulsively pick up everything that isn't nailed down.  Personally i lock all but one of my purifiers in case a visitor is sick of that radiation taste.
---
I have a few quest lines open I'll have to figure out the responders one. I hope I didn't complete it and scrap it already Haha, thanks though!!
---
Does it work in power armor too?  Or only outside?
---
It looks like a cart or wheelbarrow type thing. Lot of people assumed it was bugged and expected the tile for it to have a cow or fence or something, but it's just a cart with a stack of hay.
---
CHALLY THE MOO-MOO
---
Chainsaw and ripper get a major buff when using weapon artisan to repair. Not enough to replace the meta weapons, but they can at least be used. 
---
ok if you confirmed it with other accounts, then I suppose that's fair.
---
What do you use that fit anyway?
---
1) What platform are you playing on?
---
2) Gamertag/PSN/Bethesda.net account: Frowdo
---
3) Videos/screenshots of the issue (if applicable)
---
4) Description of the issue: When I boot into Fallout 76 while in a full suit of power armor my carrying weight is 455.  If I get out of my power armor and get back in or if I die in game my max carrying weight is 355.  The only way to get that extra 100 is to relog.
---
5) Bethesda Customer Support Ticket Number (if applicable)
---
Plasma weapons are practically useless with projectile lag. Laser guns are weak and have the durability of cardboard. Gauss rifle is okay I guess, but I'm not fond of the charging mechanic.
---
The only worthwhile e-weap is the Tesla gun, but even that has pretty shite range.
---
I'd like to see the Tesla gun get a range boost, laser guns get a damage and durability boost, and plasma a guns go hitscan.
---
I'd also like to see radiation weapons not be useless against half of the wasteland, but that's a different can of worms.
---
I've not heard one person speak on the Xbox yet, some days its nice others its just too quiet
---
looks like the loading/lift exoskeletons from the first aliens movie
---
I appreciate the tip, thanks!!
---
Looks like he did a BYAH! from Dave Chappelle 
---
PC? 
---
Also property of players in passive mode should not be attackable. Doesn't make much sense to have an "I don't want to participate in PvP-Button" if it excludes your property.
---
As a consumer you shouldnt just put up with this.Its also unfair to so many people who would support the game but feel cheated if they actually did.
---
I've spent actual dollars on Atoms to get stuff (Christmas lights and snowman), but ever since I keep racking up earned Atoms bc there is absolutely nothing else I want to buy.
---
Everyone loved the succulents and modern fireplace (which I bought with earned Atoms) so you'd think there would be more nice camp items.
---
Catch a clue, Bethesda.
---
lol there has to be lesser, medium and superior legendary effects, but I feel you.
---
Working on setting up another round of tests with Before and After screenshots to prove the point with Treasure maps (Easier to control).
---
Hmm now I'll be looking for the corpses in dresses for sure Haha, thanks!!
---
He was probably just looking for lamps dude, he was more scared of you than you on him
---
No you're confused. I meam every major update. December 11th for example. When they launched December's patch, the original feedback thread from **November** was still being used.
---
The one stickied right now was posted around November 14th! It's outdated, no denying it.
---
I loved the Plasma Rifle in Fallout games. was always my favorite. And then they fucked it up. the only barrel thats decent is the plasma thrower and thats debatable. Even my first 3 star legendary was a plasma rifle, and it was garbage, I ended up just dumping it. 
---
I'll do it tonight if you are on!    PC right?
---

---
That's just it, everyone isn't rolling in op gear.  166k members to this thread, 7.5 in bazaar,  15k in the market, whats that?  maybe 20% of total copy's sold?   Just play solo and don;t but/use them.  
---
I was just there too for an event to repair stuff in there Haha I'll have to go back, thanks!!
---
Don't worry about pleasing people with that made up etiquette stuff.  Do whatever you want with your camp.  If someone doesn't like it and smashes the door down, you get free caps for killing them!  
---
As for locks, I just use the lowest level.  This is due to the fact that anyone picking it becomes wanted.  More caps for me.
---
It‚Äôs the fortnite standard. Of course it‚Äôs a different game model and everything but I think fortnite really popularized that model of micro transactions. At least when they screw you out of your money it‚Äôs for an outfit that looks pretty cool and that has had a lot of work put into its design tho. 
---
You can still do this.
---
Fair enough (for some.)
---
I didnt have that much of an disconnecting or crashing issue, but my friend did, so I feel for you guys ):
---
But now I can at least go to players who seem suspicious in a camp and stand there disapprovingly in front of them xD
---
It's the little things in life.
---
They could give us 1 quest every month and they would fulfill that promise too.
---
Sorry PS4
---
Not quite. Refusing to replace a broken product is potentially against the law depending on how the damage was done etc.
---
In this case, Bethesda have not refused to refund, so no broken law there, there just kicking the can down the road in the hopes the customer will simply give up. If it comes back on them they can just say there sorry it took longer then average to resolve the issue but since the customer decided to cease communicating with them it's not really their problem.
---
OP will get his refund now though, because he went public. For every person willing to kick up the stink required to get good treatment, there are 10 others who just say screw this and give up.
---
I'll have to keep an eye out, thanks!!
---
Different locks just require more mats. Everyone ends up with max lockpick anyway. You only really lock them so people who pick them get flagged for PvP. Don't worry too much about whatever people think the etiquette is. You rarely even come across people's camps except maybe some stupid, gravity defying piece of crap platform hanging off a ladder in the whitespring loaded with turrets. I personally only lock my junk extractor, but it doesn't really matter
---
I have had problems with a purchase, they gave me a lot of laps, I solved the problem a bethesda administrator who communicated by reddit with me. none of the page helped me, after 20 days I was able to solve my problem thanks to reddit because a bethesda member saw the message
---
I suppose they are foreign people, who are only occupying position by time
---
Well nothing else is wrong my character.  I just lost the items I was wearing - luckily just the shotgun and hazmat suit.
---
I'm kind of worried to use my other legendary shotguns now because I don't want to crash and lose them.  I'm probably going to just take a break for a few days though because I am pretty annoyed. 
---
Go home, Strong, you're drunk.
---
there better be a damn alien DLC in the future, thats all I can say.
---
You can't nuke Vault 76
---
Just remember if you are not the main contributor to the kills, don't run up and grab all of the Hardened Mass, Glowing Mass, and High-Radiation fluids. Just take those off the bodies from your kills. Those drops are shared and it is very frustrating when people run up and take all your hard work when you are trying to create Stabilized Flux.  
---
If you weren't doing this, then I don't see how you were doing anything wrong. Then that guy is just an asshole.
---
That‚Äôs actually a very good idea. Thanks.
---
Why did you not bring it back to EB-games for replacement in first place?
---
I'll scream, fall over and call you a duck ü¶Ü 
---
I usually empty my junk for two reasons:
---
1) i collect electronic junk from all the robots i destroy (great source)
---
2) if I get killed, I dont want to hunt down my loot (not talking about loot from 1)
---
No big ememies, but lots of robots and turrets. so you need ammo and stims.
---
Well it could be like cramburgers which isn‚Äôt in the game right now. 
---
Pretty sure you can't nuke the newbie areas.
---
Lol you people need to look up the definition of the word "shill". Writing a negative article on this game is as far removed from what that word means as anything could possibly be.
---
Yeah its a pain I was out doing my thing left my camp unlocked for others to use near v 76. Get a alert so fast travel there to guys over 130 lvl has destroyed my entire base. Then trying to get me to attack them as if I am going to feed them caps while they shoot me with tse shotties. 
---
  SO IF YOUR READING THIS AND YOUR ONE OF THOSE TYPE PPL XXXX OFF. 
---
Locking extractors is fine but generally everything else is nice to be left unlocked but if you want have one purifier locked if you have a few running is ok too. Had my camp set up on a junk pile and never licked it cause if you found my camp you deserve what it has in it tho had to move out of the neighborhood cause deathclaws loved my flamingo too much
---
You can't nuke most of the forest or 76 itself. It is to prevent griefing of lower levels. Since emerging from the vault in a nuke zone would be insta-death.
---
Lool
---
When I do have time and the quietness to read notes and listen to halo tapes , I‚Äôm usually always pleasantly surprised with the funny/savage content 
---
I dont have any OP gear, just genuine dropped stuff, it has to drop to be duped in the first place, so you will see genuine players from time to time with it....as well as the scumbags
---
Did, they said it was an issue to contact bethesda about. They offered no assistance 
---
So why not do what most of us did ... create a new character? lets be honest the only reason i have a second account is actually to trade between my own characters without bothering friends and have unlimited stash space. ;)
---
Yeah. But for me I have multiple and that only works with two
---
*shrugs*
---
One reliable^? person claimed it happened to then.
---
One relaible^?? person claimed it was a bug that was fixed in the *first* patch.
---
^? A medical doctor no less, you can find the post somewhere on redit.
---
^?? moderator of a FO76 trading forum, also posted on reddit somewhere.
---
I've lost the links to the original messages among all the hysterical bullshit.
---
Anyway, in short, it is possible that the bug existed once, but if it did it was fixed long ago.
---
Charlie is 05626236
---
Are you on PlayStation? If you are I'd be happy to help you out with your building.
---
My 3* tse flamer.   It's a mini gun of fun and fire.    And my tse 50cal is fun. 
---
Ok thank you for replying. When I think about it it should do but I am really not sure
---
If they're on a team, couldn't they just kill each other to remove the bounty?
---
Where did you have your camp? I leave mine in the starting area by the reclamation day event. I‚Äôve never had someone bug me but I‚Äôm level 30 so haven‚Äôt had much experience. 
---
Now scorch beasts with their ability to detect your beating heart (or whatever)..... ;)
---
Ah so that's how you get rid of children in Bethesda games!
---
Couldn't the duo just kill each other to remove the bounty?
---
Over half of the old comments are issues already addressed, a fresh, new thread will gather attention in one focused area.
---
If the team only sorted by new, they will have more trouble figuring out which reports are trolls, and fakes. There are people reporting fake bugs in that thread. A fresh thread will have more activity from both Bethesda and players. Popular comments on freshly updated feedback threads will allow us to address the issues in one place, instead of just scrolling the front page, *hoping* they see certain bug reports.
---
She talks every time I log in. I want to murder her.
---
My next character will use energy weapons exclusively and melee in a pinch. I figured plasma was the way to go as it kind of was that way in FO4 but your write-up seems to suggest a laser rifle over a plasma rifle.  I guess I'll see what I end up with
---
I disagree. It's your CAMP to do as you please with. Other people can say whatever but in the end it's still YOUR place. So, if you want to lock the doors, fine. My water purifiers are locked. However, Since I have four of them I have considered occasionally leaving one or two unlocked out of charity.
---
As to your follow up question if you have the resources to put a level three (not four lol) lock on something, do so.
---
&gt; Who exactly would pay for that? 
---
Other corporations. Yes, it happens. It's called public relations. Go read that NYTimes piece about how Facebook paid a PR firm to put out negative press about Google.
---
The money in this industry is big enough that other game publishers chasing the same pool of gamer dollars are absolutely resorting to shady tactics. I'm not saying it's happening in this case, but it happens.
---
Luck 
---
Look at JC Penny. The CEO decided to drop sale pricing games and just offer their ‚Äúbest price‚Äù all the time. Sales tanked and CEO was dropped. They went back to raising the prices and running sales and people started buying from them again even though the prices weren‚Äôt actually generally better. People love a ‚Äúsale‚Äù. 
---
I‚Äôd bet money 76 outlasts rdr2
---
DLC, probably. It looks like a lot of the resort is locked behind future updates.
---
No problem..when I find one I usually pick it up to keep a couple in my stash for other players.
---
Don't worry, I had a similar reaction when I bumped into him on the road and he flew off.
---
Thank you I don't know what happened with that one 
---
Hahahahahaha. NO. Now you are just being beyond ridiculous. I need Flux. I solo launch nukes. I am under no delusions that this is my nuke zone and only people I invite can join. 
---
Negative. Responders vendor bots are better than that frosty mechanical bitch. 
---
&gt; Heaps better than shotguns
---
Unless you have Enforcer. Because a wendigo that can do nothing but lay there and scream at you is way less scary.
---
Why in gods name would you lick a junk pile?
---
My avatar has blue hair lol.
---
Also if you submit a support ticket you can get a refund for your atoms and they'll remove the item  for you. (just say it was a misclick or you're unhappy with the product) 
---
I could have been wrong about it being half. Thanks for the correction and further helping to answer this guys question. : )
---
It's your camp do what you want. I've got locks on my door but I leave my garage door open for people to use whatever they want on a specific floor of my house. First floor is off limits to people that are not on my team. I've got an extractor, water and food in my home on the first floor and it's protected from random mobs that spawn and its for myself and my friends. Second floor has all the benches they could need and stash even a jukebox and TV. I'm switching the doors that separate the first and second floors and my main door to powered pin doors. I may be an asshole to some people I get that but I've got stuff for everyone outside, extra plants, extra water access to everything they may need except the extractor, extra food and one water purifier. 
---
Judging people that have over an ounce of social skills causing them to have friends?
---
I‚Äôm sure your parents can‚Äôt get enough of you
---
I like that idea as well. Maybe a rogue AI within Robco that is like SkyNet and decides that the Vault Dwellers are a threat to the new Utopia and need to be eradicated.
---
Everyone I know who recently started playing has quit within a week, they feel like they just cant get ahead at this point. Duping not only ruined the economy, it ruined the progression system of the game; its like fallout76 has been out for a year or more, people 200+ walking around one shotting SBs like its nothing, when in reality its only been a few months, barely.
---
The game is not aging well at allll and new players are very actively discouraged at this point. The fact of the matter is that a large percantage of the player base has been allowed to take FULL, CONTINUOUS advantage of game breaking glitches for FAR TOO LONG, and that has had some serious ramifications, and this is literally a fact, not an opinion.

Bethesda has 100% failed to deliver the smooth online experience that buyers have come to expect in the year 2018 from a full priced major title. Its truly disgraceful if you ask me! This game had so much potential to be something super special but alas, in the age of Fornite and shitty mobile games, what can we expect?
---
Oooh! I like the idea of a Chinese robot still roaming around after the war.
---
They were a team, and that's probably what they were doing, I'm not sure tho
---
I'm on XBOX1, but 4, 6, and 8 are my top 3 wants for early 2019 updates!  
---
I'd also like to see:
---
1. \[Crafting\] I'd also like the ability to rename weapons like in FO4 (helps with sorting weapons)
---
2. \[Gameplay\] Have the option to remap the Dpad to be more like FO4/FONV/FO3, even if its only left and right dpad options
---
3. \[Gameplay\] Have a Map in the PipBoy
---
4. \[Gameplay\] Have Weights Totals at the top of each tab in the PipBoy
---
5. \[Combat\] Share Recon Scoped Enemies with Party
---
6. \[Combat\] Level 50 Chainsaws!
---
Clearly.

I was in that church in the Mire, everything was calm, was just looting it, then suddenly I see this creature at the end of corridor scream and sprint towards me. Absolutely shit myself, did a 180, got stuck on the door, then bolted as fast as I could. I could still hear it directly behind me while I was trying to lose it. Terrifying.
---
Ouch. I guess my luck is a bit better right now. Id say its a 50/50 chance rn for most people from the sounds of it.
---
Read the upcoming "In the Vault"
---
Awesome, thanks y'all
---
The pricing of stuff in atom shop is so weird.. This hair style looks awful like you said and will probably be covered in a helmet anyway. On the other hand they added that t51 santa suit that looks amazing, has lighting on it and makes sounds as you walk for 1k atoms? wtf..
---
You can get legendaries, but I've only ever gotten 2. A Ghoul Slayer Gamma Gun(yay, most useless legenary weapon from FO4), and a Lv.35 Quad Dragon(that I sold to the vendor at the Morgantown Station, so if someone found and bought that, congrats I guess).
---
Wow, that's pretty good.
---
Love the style :)
---
Nice work. How did you get the wire to go from the connection point on the door, through the door, to the conduit connection inside of your base?
---
I am sorry to be an idiot but can someone ELI5 on this issue?  I guess I havent run into it yet
---
Me! 
---
Been posting about this anywhere I see this mentioned. Minimap + App + Better signposting on missions = Happy Guy!
---
RIP Quad Lever Action that only needs to reload 5 bullets.
---
so you guys are talking about  extractors at your camp...is there a plan for that? I know they exist at workshops, but those disappear after logoff.
---
okay thank you, that helps a lot 
---
Thanks for the info guys. Yeah, did all of Rosie's quests.   I didn't even realise she gave me them.  
---
Yes PC.
---
I just want a nice long fringe, bangs, etc, I just want Morden hair... I know it's not fallout theme, but hell, I'm running round with Christmas lights and jiggle bells strapped to my Power armour! LET ME HAVE ROCK/EMO/WHATEVER SAD HAIRSTYLE I HAVE IRL lol
---
Attach the upper floor to a different fundation with stairs, delete the first fundation, rebuilt it corectly, then delete the second one.
---
the painting is also in the governors office in the Charleston capital building 
---
Honestly as someone who wanted to rp as a gun runner i love the duper, i buy low and sell high and have a lot of fun running around selling items and gear.  It honestly saved this game for me as currently it has ZERO other content
---
But if your weapon have 100 damage, with standard damage buff It goes to 200, with the perk It goes to 250 and sandman incrase It to 275. 5 points for all of this, and Only on sneack attacks with the last One only during night.
---
Well... Nvm what I just said, 100% AP is possible but [apparently I just had a lucky bug twice. It's supposed to only work with the dress equipped.](/spoilers)
---
It probably won't work in PA.
---
So aliens are lore official or no?
---
* slowly crosses fingers *
---
Very very yea!
---
20 outfits is only 2 pounds. 
---
Wouldn't be bad if hairstyles were max of like 400 atoms, depending how 'esentric' they are
---
Yeah, I was curious about that last night.  The bounty system is probably easy to exploit right now.
---
The other thing I was wondering about is if the bounty is tied to the individual character or Bethesda name.  If it's the latter, then someone could create a massive bounty and then switch to a low level alt.  Can't take 1000 caps from someone who doesn't have it.  I haven't tested either, just a thought that occurred to me.
---
All great points. I'll talk about this with the team later. Thanks for this!
---
I‚Äôm down for anything besides the same boring bullshit we do right now. With that said, the crashes need to be fixed because they ruin just about any activity. 
---
There are resource nodes out in the world. If you place a camp nearby, you can build an extractor like the workshop ones
---
You're right! My old ticket is in there, but still hasnt had a reply in over 3 weeks :(
---
Johnny Cash - the man comes around... Right?!
---
Yeah I'm just now getting to this point in the game.  Well, had this quest sitting in my log for about a month but finally decided to start doing nukes.  I quickly realized that having camp next to the bunker entrance is going to save me a lot of caps in fast travel fees.  
---
Trouble with inventory? Here, this 40 pound rocket launcher should help.
---
Raider PA can be used as early as level 15.  I used it on my most recent character when I hit 15 and I felt like a boss. :)
---
[http://fallout.wikia.com/wiki/Raider\_power\_armor\_(Fallout\_76)](http://fallout.wikia.com/wiki/Raider_power_armor_(Fallout_76))
---
I have. It doesn't list it specifically. 
---
just curious - whats wrong with it?
---
I believe someone ran the numbers and found that Combat Armor with the BoS armor mod on it yields the best defenses, even higher than Marine Combat.  So... going for full Heavy Combat Armor + BoS, one piece with Chameleon and if possible another with the "harder to detect while sneaking" mod (you get this on a chestpiece from the main quest line, Last Stand I think?) would work well... at least until literally everything detects you through all of your stealth bonuses and runs directly to you to tear you to shreds.
---
I'm with you don't worry. But I am over joyed with my silly Northern Lights Power Armour, and that was 1k. Just... It feels toooo much. Yah no
---
Like 1 of every 50 players I see have Explosive weapons. I‚Äôve found one legitimately myself and one shot most enemies. New players shouldn‚Äôt be fighting SBs to begin with. Also, new players shouldn‚Äôt pvp higher levels regardless because your gear set won‚Äôt be able to compete. 
---
You can't count players on the map because not everyone shows up on the map.
---
You've got a good start to it. 
---
Locked doors are a pain for wanderers needing to scrap, stash, repair, and cook. 
---
Locked extractors and purifiers are understandable, protecting your important resources. 
---
My friends and I have at least 1 of every workbench for people to use if necessary along with a stash box. 
---
And its a nice gesture to have a bed and an instrument available for folks to get their Well Rested/Well Tuned buffs. 
---
As for the why for different levels of locks: 
---
A lvl 0-1 lock is extremely easy to pick where a 2-3 will offer signifigantly more protection. The higher level the locks, the more components you use. And the components needed for the higher lvl locks can be some of the rarer ones in game (Gears and Springs) 
---
Locks dont get stored and they wont transfer with your C.A.M.P. if you move it. If you move around a lot and have a lot of things to lock, you will burn through those reaources fast, which may be another reason to use lower lvl locks. 
---
I hope this information is helpful :) 
---
You go girl!
---
All hail Mothman!
---
I think the bigger issue for most people (me included) was how they made everything during the holidays into stupid bundles 
---
Back at it again with those prices
---
I wish I could help but I‚Äôm busy. If you still need help after four hours I‚Äôll be willing to help. 
---
Idk about that mole miner explanation friend lol
---
I know it's used to make Psycho but is probably used in other stuff.
---
It always reloads the full magazine regardless of how many shots are left

You know what? Do whatever makes you happy and makes it feel like your camp. I personally leave the door to my house unlocked in case people wanna nap or jam out some tunes on my back porch. Or, y'know, just have a gander around and maybe get inspiration for a design.
---
I
---
Myrafting area is in a different building that has the rolling garage door which is attached to pressure plates so people can just step on them and help themselves to the facilities.
---
I have the usual line up of veggies growing for making vegetable starch (adhesive). It's kinda funny because I've watched several people sneak over and try to be all covert about stealing from my garden, when I grew it with the intention for others to use anyways.
---
My 2 water purifiers are unlocked. I've never had issue with running low on purified water in my inventory so I never saw the point. 
---
My junk extractor is where I draw the line though. Later on things like screws, springs and gears become precious and are used in mass quantities in higher level crafting. So yeah, I keep that locked up. I dunno the point of different level locks. Slightly different quantities of mats required.
---
But all that said, it just depends how you wanna play. Do you want your camp to be your private sanctuary that you can dance around in with mannequins while wearing nothing but a Mr. Fuzzy head? Or do you want it to be a welcoming spot for other travelers passing by? 
---
ive never messed with the blueprint function manually but when I go to move my camp to a new location it appears to have the previous structure blueprinted automatically
---
It's any damage done to the mob while you're attacking it.  If i'm shooting the queen with an automatic for example, all damage everyone is doing leaves a grey bar until i stop to reload.
---
When I joined party it was a young kid whining "why you keep bully me" over and over again. I'll give them the benefit of doubt. 
---
I agree, especially with the double barrel. 8 shots instead of 2 thats insane
---
Thank you for your consideration.
---
This is what I was going to mention. Some people like going out of their way to leave their resources available to anyone.
---
I build near Morgantown, and the only thing that I really keep unlocked any more are my water purifiers. The town itself has plenty of workbenches scattered throughout it so I don't worry as much anymore.
---
There are terminals in west tek that tell you allll about some of these things youre wondering about!
---
I'm pretty sure radio is server-based, so all the radios in-game play the same thing for everybody.
---
We need a custom faction like the free stats, to vs the atomic store hahah
---
I‚Äôd pay 10$ for a pet death claw to guard my camp 
---
aren't they oblidged to handle it as they were the reseller?
---
I lock mine with level zero muahahahaha

it was in one of last months ITV. https://fallout.bethesda.net/article/6Gmr5HkkEgOY2k8qyey4M8/fallout-76-inside-the-vault-december-19-2018
---
Junk pile is best resource! Get all the screws!
---
OP is right about the bugs and duping just not everyone had them. Seen plenty without TSE gear and decked sets like vanguards.
---
I have said my bit and piece on all this before.
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/aaedli/want_to_know_why_the_servers_are_unstable_bethesda/?utm_source=reddit-android
---
But i have decided to take a break from the game myself. Its probably one of my favourite games and it has serious potential. But Bethesdas has alot of work ahead of them first. 
---
Always best to step away from a game you love before you end up despising it.
---
I reccomend anyone else feeling this way to remember that.
---
I think because perception has the rifle perks.
---
I follow the logic there.
---
I'm a guy playing a female character and I'd love to have a hairstyle like Kassandra from AC Odyssey, I'd probably pay good Atoms for that.
---
Man, I know PC is the way to go but game breaking bugs seem so much more prevalent in PC than console. 
---
It's such an essential function. Many other games have a method of swapping for different builds on the fly. I currently have a stealth/gunslinger build, a power armor build, a crafting build, and one for gathering and farming. 
---
The mod allows for this to happen flawlessly, but it would make much more sense to be a native feature. 
---
Nope. Shot back and it poos up a little message saying pacifist is on. At least it tells you.

Cripple all their limbs and they'll self-destruct.

"we will be releasing another patch that contains many fixes, including fixes for the Lever-Action Rifle reload animation"
---
you paid the same money as everyone else for this game, you do what you want and create your own etiquette, don't ask people for permission to do shit in game either
---
But... But... Waaaahhh
---
Just want tons of Morden hair... Idc if it fits... My Power armour (a suit made for war) has damn flashing lights on it.... But my hair tho! 
---
I wish you could reskin pipe rifles. I don‚Äôt use them because they look ugly and I‚Äôm all about aesthetic. 
---
So is 400 rounds of 10mm ammo but if you‚Äôre not gonna use them, that‚Äôs unnecessary weight
---
Me too, that question mark saved my life lol
---
Oof. That's true
---
It's the effect for gameplay only, not the perk card system...
---
There's supposedly one at the two lakes. Forget the exact name of the place, something like that. And one spawns at the abandoned bog town. I have almost 200 hours and I've never seen one either.
---
Do other quad guns also show load animation for 4x the ammo? 
---
37 y/o woman here with full time job and over 300 hours in on FO76.  We exist.  And we love Fallout.
---
There's also another common exploit with these BS mechanics in games like this. Somebody invites you to a team, shoots someone, then they kill you and steal your stuff. Enjoy pacifist mode! It means you can't fight back, but they can still kill and grief you and steal your stuff and caps.
---
Same. If someone is going to pick the lock, they're going to pick the lock regardless of the level. I'd rather not spend the screws
---
It does for me
---
Ohh thanks! I missed that. Guess I'll just put it in my stash and wait
---
I had similar confusion, the points are dual role...
---
Ye that's how I feel. I mainly hope for more raider stuff and MORDEN hairstyles haha
---
Shit I wish Fallout ran as smooth as Fortnite. Say what you will about the vapid nature of it, Fortnite is a well oiled machine and it delivers on expectations. Fo76 isn‚Äôt particularly good at anything it does except the Atom store. 
---
I don't believe you, the mothman isn't real, he can't be.. Have you seen a doctor about this yet? Do it for the family, they deserve it.

Should have thrown on the skeleton costume and crouched on him.  "Its rider was named Death, and a scorchbeast was following close behind¬†him"
---
I can already lift 200 pounds. A lot of people can. =|
---
That's what I'm doing now. Don't even finish the responder quest line. Deleted a level 12 after I finished it and got Somerset Special lvl 5. 
---
Are you needing someone to hold it so you can server hop for items? I can help! PSN is MandyMarieB
---
I don‚Äôt really see how other players load outs affect your game unless to play for PVP. Stability is the main thing holding this game back. 
---
Actually Cramburger is in the game. I found it under the name Delbert's Bunless Cramburger. The recipe can be found in The General's Steakhouse in the basement/kitchen if I remember correctly. It is still just called "Cramburger" in the cooking menu.
---
I support this message.
---
The first time I wish I was on a different platform. This is such a cool idea.
---
I‚Äôm all for pvp . If you don‚Äôt want to lose your junk , stash it.
---
synfidie is right, that looks exactly like the "dirt" extra.  Try going into the Extras, toggle dirt on, then toggle it off.  The UI is a little stupid and doesn't always show if someone is enabled or disabled when you're looking at the preset characters.
---
they mentioned that wasn't going to be enforced for a month so that they could start planning the retired topics.
---
Thats good for you, very lucky experience. Youre aware that the majority isnt experiencing this "stability" though, right?
---
New players should be able to feel like there's a point to the grind, not that theyre late to the drop party to end all drop parties. The meta is literally TSE weapons rn.
---
What do you have to say about the dozens of posts here? Lol like literally someones grandma getting griefed, her whole CAMP levelled by 100+ players with TSE weapons. She wasnt pvping anyone, was she? Any ideas on what she could have done differently???????????????
---
You prob didnt mean it, but definitely try not to trivialize the issue here; there is a problem whether or not you can see it my friend! Im happy your experience is positive!
---
Just go inside and pick up the tin cans each one gives 100 steal and like 50 lead, so you get a bunch of lead if you farm it
---
well, I can say being on reddit more has helped my grammar. 
---
Yep, my psn is lucianoschaeffer add me and join me if u want to farm him :D
---
Black... People are more real? HOLD THE PHONE DAVE (you're dave now) you're telling me that wasn't a mirelurk king I saw working at Costa?!?!
---
(that probably sounded hella racist.... If it does... Sorry lol) 
---
That has nothing to do with what I quoted. You said they would not add anything from New Vegas, those weapons didn't exist in Fallout 4 but they did in New Vegas, so arguably, they "came" from New Vegas.
---
Can't stand keyboard and mouse.....plus I play on laptop sat on my sofa, so it would be just plain nasty....
---
It's a heavy gun so use heavy gun perks for it, and also stabilized for armor penetration  
---
If it were a real bomb you'd probably break it and it wouldn't go off.
---
Haha yeah fuck the noobs!
---
Sometimes legendaries drop a drill/flaregun in place of a legendary. Happened to me let night with the Scorchbeast Queen. 
---
I think it just randomly popped up for me when I first traveled to the pumpkin house.
---
Same here. Do you have any point, or are you just like the rest of the idiots who don't like the truth?
---
The gatling gun is a heavy weapon so any perk that says heavy weapons effect it. Also tank killer is for non-auto only. Its for any kind of rifle.
---
But do you have big camp or just basic stuff and basic building? I see a lot of people uses abandoned buildings to save blueprint bar, building only furniture/workbenches, but I want my own building in not-so-obvious place .
---
100 plus hours of solo play so yah 
---
Just play solo and don't engage any players
---
Correct. Done scorched earth three times but not actually launched it myself and still have the quest.
---
I just want a long hair option! The longest we have is up in a ponytail (lame) or above the shoulders. WTF?
---
It should effect perks so we can begin to use under armor to substitute for missing special points
---
you mean animation of reloading gun?
---
the last day they put some of the christmas stuff on sale, I picked up one of the skins, id have been pissed if I dropped 800-1000 atoms only to see it go -50% on sale a day or two later
---
It adds to your special points so you can add more cards?
---
The presidential power armor paint job was datamined back when the game first came out. It's literally just a black set of power armor, kinda like the Blackbird but without red highlights. Not that great.
---
Yeah but it's also my; bed, workstations, decontamination shower, stashes, and instruments that I've earned. Not some noob to reap my rewards for MY work. Just try getting into my base, you'll take a load of explosive buckshot through your dome.
---
[Mothman is my buddy](https://i.imgur.com/pEM2NPN.png)
---
Do serums suppress ALL negative effects, or just the mutation they are associated with?
---
Ya it's pretty well established that Fallout 76 is Fallout 4 set on a multiplayer platform, so I'm 100% positive someone better educated on coding than me could take the fallout 4 pip-boy app and make it compatible with Fallout 76.
---
You don't have to pay for that you can already do it in game for free.
---
&gt; That's how you solve a problem in a development environment, not a production environment.
---
Clearly you don't work in a production environment. Bandaid fixes are used all over the place.
---
&gt; They could even hire modders to test the game if they wanted to, this isn't a technical problem it's a money problem.
---
Why would they hire modders when they have their own QA?
---
Yeah I guess so. I‚Äôd drive myself crazy because everyone else can aim better with their pinpoint precision etc. do you play a lot of shooters this way?
---
Every mmo like game has a meta.  Also, this game has pvp mechanics that allow camps to be destroyed. It sucks and it‚Äôs happened to me but it‚Äôs the nature of the  game. This would be like complaining that your base was destroyed and loot taken on an Ark pvp server. It happens. Players who want almost no risk of ‚Äúgriefing‚Äù should play a single payer game. 
---
Good sir, I am a married man and would never cheat on my wife with just ANY noob.
---
Martial Artist is the one stealth perk for the Gatling - faster fire rate.  You do want Stabilized and One Gun Army plus the Heavy Gunner perks.
---
I am still unable to team with anyone.  I am glad it is working for most people though.  Was in a Nuked area last night and could have used a team.
---
The springs are the real cost here, I mean cmon.
---
Is One Gun Army worth it?  In the Luck tree and gives chance to stagger and cripple limbs
---
If you build a diner door you can open it and build another door on top lol

---
Well i know what im doing when i finish work
---
I‚Äôve posted this before but carry weight increasing backpacks have actually been datamined as Atom shop items. Obviously that doesn‚Äôt mean it will happen or anything, but they *are* are least coded into the game.
---
[Source](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1cbortvX4lbLW2iX0OFPHf8cdjUUQINDWDoYWiHL-080/edit?usp=sharing)
---
&gt; Things that are coded into the game as with other items but are unobtainable and can only be purchased through the Atom Shop. Some may be available at launch, others are future updates.
---
&gt; **Backpacks** - (variants are Standard, Framed and Vault), customizable backpack that increases carry weight - colors are Aqua, Blue, Green, Pink, Red, White, Yellow.
---
Pvp , Server Stability, Player Market ( especially if your roleplaying as a npc for the community like myself).
---
PVE fights like Queen and nuke zones been wrecked by items people should not have so easily including the spam of insanely cheap mutations for the perfect xmen builds.
---
Pretty much every area of the game gets effected by exploits left open for 8 weeks. With zero backlash and only hotfixing the current version of it instead of sorting out a way to stop the issue.
---
Sent you a request!
---
11) Ability to "park" owned power armor in your Camp in a repair station and not have it recall to your inventory.  Just have it sit there indefinitely until I want to use it.  
---
12) Show benefits of recipes you are about to make in the cooking station.  Only showing the name doesn't help.
---
13) Do away with PVP.  If you must have it, tie it exclusively to workshops and make the workshops worth having and fighting for.
---
14) Build up PVE COOP.  Have more serverwide events that are announced on radio.  If you join (by going to the area) you can cooperate vs the boss or whatever and get the exp/loot
---
15) Enable trading. Sometimes you don't have 1000 caps for a recipe, but you have way too many stimpacks.  Trade them in towards that recipe. Without having to spend hours jumping around and selling.
---
16) Allow me to scrap legendary items.  I don't care about that leather +14 damage resist from animals armband.  Let me scrap it.
---
17) When I put my camp down, remove all rocks and scrub and fallen trees from that circle.  Just remove them.  
---
18) Need a Med-wheel similar to our item/weapon wheel.  Or just give us 2 wheels.  
---
19) Make workshops worth claiming.  After getting the Ammo factory setup to make shotgun shells, I returned after an hour to have 86 shells waiting (and another defense event).  What's the point?  Production rate of these facilities should be 3x what they  are currently...if not more.
---
20) To go with #4 - show known plans in your pipboy, not just at vendors. 
---
21) Fix the saboteur hideout bug featuring 50 copies of password/cardkeys.
---
Karmic consequences seem to go around...be wary...
---
Yeah the Martial Artist is kind of what got me thinking about it.  Between that and getting challenges done for pistol kills while using it, it seems to be a weird weapon in this game.
---
I want a sleeve like Scar's from FMA
---
I have seen him and the Flatwoods monster on that section of road. 
---
How exactly do you see that working when you un-equip the item?
---
Except for when you guys run out of caps to forfeit. I'm level 120+ and I spend caps frequently. 1500 is not qomerhing I want to lose because of a cow. 
---
^.&gt;
---
It has planters up/down the entire tower.
---
When I'm on tonight I'll figure out which one it is.
---
That and please.. For humanity. Stop posting 'I quit/I'm done with fallout because...'
---
No one gives a fuck
---
Pink.
---
With glitter.
---
This is really interesting to read. I hated Tiny Tina, like completely. Awful character. I liked Rose though.
---
Baseballs as well, but that is due to M Cocktails and Baseball grenades.
---
I love the "Ethically Farmed" tag. It's our own version of Organic, or Cage Free.
---
This post reminds me of when the game released and people flooded the sub with posts about how they just scrapped their main weapon.
---
Think you mixed up "this machine" and "that gun" haha. I do miss the garand :(.
---
Yes I 2nd this
---
I built my base under a bridge. Orbital strike that. =)
---
Not a lot for someone who isn‚Äôt a lazy millennial üòâ
---
There‚Äôs another vault you can get into, but it only has mirelurks
---
I missed this too. I wasn‚Äôt checking the Atomic shop regularly and was just focusing on playing. Have been playing since beta. If this showed up in the Atomic Shop again I would buy it immediately. 
---
Can you give you your ign please? I have a plan
---
That what I was talking about 
---
Then they can shoot you before you shoot them.
---
It removes the perk points and 3 random perk cards
---
All of the crazy mental people that turned into mental feral ghouls.

That said, no idea. Possible DLC.

Oh I know. I have a rifle/vats build and I enjoy getting to 95% accuracy after one shot (w rank one concentrated fire).

Still a buff that nothing else offers.

Yes, the players are entitled... to a functioning game, which they currently don't have.

It was a legendary so i could not scrap it. Though i understand what you mean. But not a buyback is just stupid every online game has a buyback. People make mistakes... 
---
breaking limbs is pretty solid meta. you obviously dont have as many shots per second as say a miningun so it wont proc as often but its worth the points imo.
---
Lvl193...I play solo unless my sons are on...
---
5x Unyielding is the best armor for stealth players.
---
Live at 20% HP but have 30+ AGI. This makes your sneak rating stupid high.
---
Optionally, replace 1x unyielding piece for a chameleon piece.
---
You are basically invisible now.
---
I use it with my heavy weapons character, the stagger can be useful. Though most enemies might die before you even get a chance to stagger them, it can be useful against scorchbeasts and stuff
---
Same here. . .Lvl 68.
---
I would probably use energy weapons *if they were actually worth it*. Laser damage is already so much less than ballistic, and on top of that they break like 3 times faster. I love the fantasy of a high-end sci-fi weapon but they perform like shit.
---
I wouldn't even mind them breaking easier if it meant that they do more damage on average than the ballistic weapons. That would make sense, they're supposed to be experimental weapons anyway.
---
By itself? No. Without building into heavy weapons none of them are worth it. Put together, it's a fantastic perk that will help land scorchbeasts.
---
But... you've just taken away half his arms!  
---
He needs those! For, you know... Oh god, poor thing
---
Just a random comment... Holotapes and notes are pretty fkng annoying to me.  If they‚Äôd trigger I‚Äôd be more interested. Seems it‚Äôs mostly just ‚Äúclick here to see how that pile of bones over in the corner died‚Äù.  Definitely not a fan of picking up endless shit that weighs nothing and clutters inventory for absolutely no benefit.

add for 200 caps from time to time.
---
Nobody sets foot in my camp unless they are; a close friend, someone I've journeyed with at least 5+ hours, or my own mother. It doesn't matter though, the procedure is the same, they step into a locked room to strip down for decontamination. Then they are allowed to explore the facilities. Under my strict watch.
---
Checked YouTube. Dupe was not fixed it seems.
---
Me too, with my Furious Handmade and ~85 rounds per drum. I can take them out eithout even reloading if they are on the ground but when they are in the sky I waste a lot of bullets.
---
Boy, you place yer camp next to Charleston station and stop that vendor bot from spawning, imma find a right warm dark place for my baton if'n you know what I mean.
---
Where did you work, what was your title, specific duties and what was your background? Because I don‚Äôt believe you. 
---
First of all, you‚Äôre just flat out wrong. This isn‚Äôt a difficult ticket to deal with - in fact it‚Äôs actually more cost effective to replace the item than it is to spend paid customer service hours navigating the issue and trying to mitigate responsibility. This is the driving force behind no hassle returns, free return shipping, immediate replacements and the like - it dampens loss on the bottom line. 
---
The alternative to this is in fact to simply ignore issues knowing that ultimately you will be forced to resolve only a handful in the end. This is a classic operation style and it works well in markets like this, unfortunately. 
---
Check your knowledge at the door. 
---
Matte black with pink glitter.
---
Alot of those issues are still a thing now. Unless they make sure all that feedback is first looked at then close it and continue the next one.
---
Agreed! I would respec in a heart beat for a legendary 10mm. One of the more aesthetically pleasing small guns.
---
Now about those sights and stocks.... Can we have em?
---
What is your outfit, fellow dweller?
---
This is a cool idea. I think it's funny how people haven't really been complaining about the stash limit lately.
---
Some will say it's because they increased it to 600 and that was the magic number. I think it's because (like a lot of other things in the game) it was a new system that we all just needed to get used to; and we have.
---
Good luck enforcing that one.
---
The issue is that it is difficult to leave those stair cases in anything other than a foundation. 
---
I wish Aid could be sorted into Drinks, Food, Healing, Drugs, etc. 
---
Have there been bans for using Sorting mods?
---
I believe someone said they'd tamed a snallygaster.
---
Can't say ive ever sold something to a vendor that I didnt want to, maybe calm down on how fast your trying to sell shit?
---
Eh. I'll just eat something for the perception buff and enjoy running around in the 20+lbs of clothing I've hoarded then.
---
You're correct in that they probably won't
---
I just rock a full set of heavy leather with stability mods on the arms (almost 0 sway with a scope), padded on the chest, and either sleek or custom fitted legs.  If I happen to find good leveled armor I might go to that - but I seem to only attract wood and metal legends.
---
That be a real shame when folks be throwing away a perfectly good green boy like that.
---
yeah so be careful... some people like to go around just shooting anyone, they don't care if ur set to passive or not. It's the crazy high dmg and the explosion dmg that causes the slap dmg to actually me much more than just a slap. 
---
Lets not talk about ark.
---
But your point tho is that lower levels shouldnt actively seek out trouble... when the trouble is coming to them... in the form of xp exploits and duped god tier items. Youre just dismissing the problem at this point really and its super annoying!
---
Lets talk about ark; pvp servers and pve servers. Advertised and organized, most games have this! This game didnt/doesnt have that. You know what this game had? Advertising promising catering to BOTH play styles. Like these are not strictly PVP servers dude, this is not a strictly PVP game, and the pvp is extremely secondary to any sort of magic that the fallout series possesses. So like why are people being forced to do PVP in a scenario where they are guaranteed to lose and get discouraged, when the game was literally advertised to cater to a playstyle where they dont have to???
---
Honestly the only robot that has it coming is the Mayor of Grafton
---
Yea it's the base strenght of an average human male they got for their calculations. That exoskeleton there is just a skin. RL is not pay to win!
---
If you have a big base you CANNOT blueprint it all in one BP.   
---
What you need to do is break it down into sections/multiple blueprints.     
---
What Ive done is I BP the foundations and floors as #1. Then all the stuff that makes up the first floor as #2. Then any upper floors / roofing as #3.     
---
You then lay them down in order when you move your camp. 
---
Each can chime gives 9 lead and 18 steel. I once ended up with a total of 250ish lead for a run-through of Patrol Duty, but that can also be ammo intensive. 
---
&gt; if the rumor of lootboxes are true.
---
We're going to judge them on things they *might* do now?
---
I've heard Bethesda are going to kill your first born child, how low can they get.  Black Isle^1 or Obsidian would never do that.  FONV RULEZ!
---
^1 Actually, Black Isle probably would have.
---
I know it is totaly my fault. This is serieusly the first time i did not put the important stuff in the stach first. 
---
Hey! I'm also a new player to the game too (and am on PC), just got it after Christmas. My name on Discord is Amphisbaena, name for F76 is Teaginthedragon. 
---
you arent *losing* special points. the ones given to you outside of level-ups are *bonus* points.
---
First time I ran into mothman I was like "wth is this? Should I shoot him? I'll shoot him." Then out of nowhere I get blasted to pieces by one of those massive security bots. By the time I got back both were gone and I was left wondering if he traveled around with an escort!
---
Yeah it's better put that fertilizer in the pen before it runs away!
---
Sorry. :D
---
All, for me it adds back some skill requirement, like removing driving aids on Forza.
---
Plus I like the fine/natural movement control....and actual triggers.
---
Rumble also added bonus, but that's just me, don't want to start the age old controller versus K and M argument...
---
They should have thought of that before straying so far from home... Stay the heck away from my door! I see those dirty outsiders scrounging, digging, eating spoiled foods. The rads have gotten to them I say, and I won't let a single one of those soon to be ferals anywhere near my stuff!
---
Click bait? Find out!
---
YouTubers hate him for this one, simple trick...
---
In reality, it's a bit of both. 
---
Seriously the department in charge is full of braindead idiots with a) idiotic items and b) these prices? I mean WHAT THE FUCK! 8$ for this assugly hairstyle? Ok tastes are different but this is not even remotely worth the price. If they'd charge like 100 atoms ok, fine, some ppl may like it, but this is just hideous. The major problem is that 90% of the stuff is just overpriced like hell. Sorry but I needed this off my chest. It's ridiculous.
---
Kinda sad I missed out on those tile floorsets. Hope they come back in the future.
---
I see two sides to this argument. I'm definitely one who believes the prices are ridiculous, but I understand it's all just to support free upcoming content. 
---
Here is the issue: I; like many others, would love to support the game by purchasing cosmetics, but if low quality stuff is being thrown out then I won't spend the money. I don't even mind dropping 20 dollars on a skin... but make it a skin actually worth 20 dollars. " You don't have to buy it" is a ridiculous response that I keep seeing. 
---
That being said, The game is still not even two months old. Most games that sell cosmetics put out a lot of garbage at first for what seems like a lot of money. Fortnite had very basic skins for 5-15 dollars at first and the majority of people didn't buy them so they became rare later on. Then they eventually started making a lot better content and it kept getting better. Now  most of the time the prices reflect what is offered (which I get is relative based on opinion.)
---
 I HOPE Fo76 can achieve the same; so i'll be patient and wait to spend my money. 
---
I really do understand everyone's disappointment with the current contents pricing though. Especially with hairstyles. They are all just so ugly. 
---
Comments like this are why Bethesda should be reading these threads. Great idea to solve a problem. Maybe the devs hadn't thought of that yet.
---
I don't go over 10 bulk of each junk item.
---
I want to give this a go, I'll add you tonight.
---
If you're wanting to use the 2x1 stair case on a non-foundation floor you can do it using columns. Place a column on top of a column, then remove the bottom one so you have a column floating in the air. You should be able to place one of those stairs off of the bottom of that column. 
---
There is no argument. Two thumbs can‚Äôt cover 15 buttons as well as two hands can cover an entire keyboard. Mouse is hands down more accurate than joystick and it isn‚Äôt debatable. 
---
Ooh. That had gone right over my head. v__v;
---
You might be looking for high-tech lights, or maybe the plan is stage lights?
---
I enforce it well, I'm watching my campgrounds 24/7
---
Thats a lot of text for saying you shot a mothman, pussyboy 
---
People really do just be missing the point so eloquently and gracefully on this sub 
---
yes, it always takes the time to reload all 5 bullets, instead of just the amount missing from the magazine.
---
I didnt think stat boosts from equipment/food/etc affected perks.  But, I guess it can affect SHARING of perks... didn't consider that.
---
As long as they continue to insult me by thinking I'm stupid enough to pay $8 for 1 haircut (ugly one at that) I'm going to continue to not spend anything on the Atom shop nor purchase any other Bethesda products.
---
I used to use this blade, was pretty good at some time.
---
Also Rose's voice and lines are pretty much the best in the game.
---
I had high hopes for 76. I really did. 
---
I've been doing 150-200 depending on type of junk, some 120s for stuff I don't really use.
---
Very much just like that...
---
Dude that's the best place to put a farm but I agree. There are other spawn points for the vendor though
---
i did the test before doing so :)
---
But you can't stop someone from fast travelling or re-logging.
---
It doesn't reach the whole map from there but it certainly reaches far enough to hit another camp.
---
Yeah, there's an event called one Violent Night that has a jukebox that plays twangy banjo music.
---
hope it serves you well :D
---
Instructions unclear...
---
Just keep checking in the Bethesda launcher for the games.  The last time they gave them out the games just suddenly became available for installation without any additional notice.
---
Yep, was having the conversation with someone I was grouped with yesterday.  Saying how the environmental story-telling is as strong as ever in Fallout 76, albeit with a strange lack of human population.  One thing I find odd is that ALL humans outside of vaults have perished in WV.  I mean, clearly, they survived for some time after the bombs dropped and some even thrived for a short time.  It's odd that so many would be so recently deceased and there would be nothing standing.  I guess that's the scorch virus though that finally got to them all.  Perhaps we will see a human re-population yet if they keep working on the game.
---
Got this guy started with the Mistress of Mystery side quest, which I would recommend to everyone if you haven't done it yet.
---
If you check the stats in your pip boy it will show strength X (+1) etc
---
How do you get the Brahmin pen to work? I have it learned but it shows up nowhere when I go to build. 
---
Dude what does xp exploits have to do with a player minding their business? I play almost entirely solo and this ‚Äúforced‚Äù pvp you‚Äôre talking about is an exaggeration at best. Also, you don‚Äôt have proof that all god tiers you‚Äôve encountered have been duped. So that means your real issue is op weapons in general which is a different case and one I agree with. 
---
Same I try to keep about 10 bulk and just drop everything else 
---
Minimum of 100 each. More of the stuff I use more often such as adhesive and springs.
---
Don't say "snowflake ammo" - tends to make them run crying to their safe space.
---
Fortnite is a smash sensation that literally did everything right. I just really hate what it's success has done to the hearts and minds of gaming industry higher ups lol
---
ok good lol - the server could have still crashed (had that happen with 20lbs of recipes).. it'd just be bad timing
---
Well that's one of the MANY reasons only authorized personnel are even allowed past my gate
---
I ran into her out in the open world, she was giving the quest dialog like i had already started her quest but i was like level 20 and had just skipped up to grafton to get the overseer cache. 
---
I don't break the law. I enforce it. I encourage you to do the same.
---
&gt;!The Grafton Monster, Snallygast, and maybe Monthman are 100% West Tek, it's on one of the terminals where it talks about the FEV experiments. The Flatwoods monster is clearly one of the Zetan either aliens or probe. !&lt;
---
Tell me that when Im lying in bed playing,....glad you're happy with your chosen playstyle.
---
I know the merits of both, I was answering a question...
---
I‚Äôd kill for ‚Äúthat gun‚Äù I‚Äôd be running that blade runner shit all day. 
---
&gt; nothing has even changed in two weeks
---
You are pedantically right, two weeks ago was the 20th of December and the last fix was the 19th.
---
So you played one whole day after the last fix.
---
Although I haven't really made any friends in game, I have encountered a lot of friendly people. This game is the reason I changed my xbox settings so I can hear other people not on my friends list. 
---
Fills it with mines...
---
My 4 year old son told me to pick it up. I tried and failed. 
---
He said "Dad, pick it up!" 
---
I told him it was glued down. This did not sit well with him. 
---
He said "If you were stronger you could pull it up"
---
So yeah, that thing had me questioning my shortcomings and has shamed me in front of my son. Damn that thing.
---
It was mentioned in some of the pre-release material that they were working on vendor bots players could deploy.  That appears to have been put on hold during launch and subsequent issues that had to be addressed at that time and now they have some time to devote to implementing them in game again.
---
Time to bring out the 2 shot Fat Man üòé
---
Yes. However dying with a bounty higher than your cap pool gives you a 3.5hr debuff of 50% less damage to players. 
---
I wonder how many of us are playing while our wives and children are sleeping. 
---
It's the only time I get to play while I drink my coffee.
---
What? I‚Äôm talking about it should add more perk points so you can add more perk cards, as of now it doesn‚Äôt 
---
Jesus lmao. The game that keeps on giving.
---
Oh shit, they should make them functional when players drop nukes
---
Not for me really, also I got so much lead because of this lol 
---
We don't serve your kind here.
---
It still drops legendary for me last night, but mainly drops armor. I did get a nice shotgun from one yesterday afternoon.
---
I know there are other things that do besides brahmin and radstag but they're so easy to farm and only require boiled water.
---
Not a nuke,  thoseare pretty resistant to those kind of things,  or else we'd just ring every city with computer controlled anti aircraft guns. 
---
Real G's move in silence like lasagna 
---
Join the subreddits and PS4 community for queen raids, every now and then someone throws up that they're about to do a raid and want people to join
---
Thanks guys! 
---
I am, I will PM you my gamertag. Thank you so much! 
---
I did the same thing with the Ultracite set. I had no idea you got a set as a quest reward. I thought it had to be crafted. 
---
I was carrying, Excavator, T51, and T60 so I didn‚Äôt realize another set had been added much to my surprise when I set them all down trying to figure out which one was which and saw this cool new set of PA. 
---
I still only use excavator. But at least I have all the other sets of PA. 
---
I've worked for 4 major telecomms, including Verizon when they were setting up fibre op in hundreds of new areas. 
---
Which meant thousands of tickets. Many which often got escalated beyond myself. Often this lead to having to wait for all kinds of things.... Contractors....city permits....credit/fee adjustments....
---
And I'd have boatloads of people telling me I just didn't care. As if I could fly down to their city Hall and demand permits, or force a contractor to abandon other jobs to push ours through. 
---
I refuse to work in that industry anymore. I left and took a pay cut to do so. 
---
Because consumers I learned , are entitled little jack offs. Especially when they don't have to see your face.
---
No, the controller was on the bed and she walked on it while I was distracted. 
---
This is fucking amazing, how have I not heard this before!
---
We all should kick up the stink then and say we will not take this bs anymore. 
---
Haha, PS4? 
---
I don't think that's really what they're saying. The problem isn't that tickets are being intentionally ignored, it's that nothing is being done to make sure no ticket gets overlooked.
---
Before playing Destiny, i never realized how much of a necessity this is in modern online gaming.
---
There's a clipboard on the dash of a bus, right outside the whitespring resort entrance that is unlootable as well. Don't know how many times that damn thing has fooled me into trying. Alas, it always wins. Damned unlootable texture mapped clipboard. SERENITY NOW!!!!
---
Yep, I‚Äôve had them put me in a free state bunker that I couldn‚Äôt get into normally since it was locked down.
---
Since you're running an explosive weapon, get full ranks in Demolition Expert for more damage and make sure you've got the armor piercing perk for heavy guns.  I personally run a shotgun build, so i generally only have to fight her on the ground.
---
Just do what you want. If you want to share your resources, leave it unlocked. Most people will assume open = free for taking. If you lock stuff, it'll only stop an honest person and I've personally encountered more of those than people who are assholes.
---
Here's a trick if your base gets broken: Don't waste resources repairing, just move your CAMP (even if it's in the same spot), it'll repair everything. The 30-50 cap cost is easier than getting the mats depending on how nutty the trolls went. You might need to do some magic to get the blueprint down.
---
I appreciate it when people leave a crafting bench and stash available so I can scrap junk and store and move on. Personally I only lock my extractors. Everything else like my water, beds, instruments, farm, and crafting stations are available to anyone who walks by. I leave my jukebox on for ambient music, feel free to turn it off if you need to take a nap. Just do me a favor and if you see me by the camp play the Tuba so I can laugh :-)
---
Will pacifist mode prevent you from gaining a bounty on stray bullets to CAMPs? I don't pvp and do my best to avoid hitting other people's structures...come close, but unsure.
---
What did they fix on the 19th that would have changed my opinion of the game at all?
---
About the TSE I have one yes II've used it to kill players is it fun? No not at all its just bullying its the equivalent of a large body builder kicking a small child in the face nice house bud say goodbye to the resources to repair you generator and 10  water purifiers 
---
cough ** orbital strike ** cough
---
You say my prices are all over. I don't make games for a living. I'm giving a ruff I think pricing should be in this zone (lowest to highest) I think a hair like that should cost us 150 atoms, max. If they give us hair styles that are more Morden and have a more extreme look, charge us 300 atoms. Your over priced skins should cost 500 max. They are purely a wash of paint. It's not about buying atoms to buy the item. It's about the value of the item. Your skins for PA are not worth ¬£15. Just because in game money can be earned doesn't mean that they are allowed to rack up the atoms price.
---
I can spend ¬£39 in Warframe and get 4k Plat, I can use that plat to get around 15 Skins and cosmetics. In fallout I can also buy 4k Atoms for ¬£39. Those atoms can get me about 5 items.
---
Take into fact I can also get Plat in Warframe for free as well. For me to buy a hairstyle in Warframe for my Op it costs me 50 Plat, which is less than 75p. For me to buy a Deluxe remodel skin it costs 250 (400ish for a bundle) which is about ¬£3. And when it comes to colours, I can just flat buy a whole colour pallet for 75 plat which is about ¬£1 or just under (don't remember off the top of my head). For me to get a paint job it should cost me equal to ¬£15 in Fallout.
---
That's my point. Charge me ¬£5 for it, that's more than normal price for other games because I can earn Atoms. But charging me more than double a basic standard other games offer is crazy. Especially when Warframe is Free and Fallout isn't when it comes to pricing. Also think of the fact that all of Warframes content is also free, and has no pay walls. I can spend a total of ¬£0.00 on Warframe and have all its content but a few cosmetics that get 'unvaulted'.
---
I don't play fortnite but I'm sure that is also the same as in, no pay walls and you don't have to spend around ¬£18 for 1 skin. That does nothing but add a paint job
---
So craft another already.  It's not like it's something you don't have the plans for.
---
Why would you contact Bethesda if EBgames sold you a broken helmet?
---
i just crossed 1000 carry weight last night, with enough AP Regen you barely notice it. 
---
True, but my level 35 bloodied explosive double barrel and furious explosive gatling gun I got from there still perform better than any max level legendary I've found to date. 
---
Say goodbye to all your .308 ammo lol.
---
You don't get something, even more tailored to your liking, because you missed out on a limited thing...
---
Hermit crabs were prewar pets. Also, if we are using the same logic, then radscorpions don't make sense in any of the east coast Fallouts. They were kept as pets as well. Personally, I find the Far Harbor creatures a welcome addition to 76, and they make the Mire feel more alive.
---
Thank you. This is too complicated for some lol

&gt; building set. Yes it's weird but currently there are two barn sets, one gives the actual barn stuff, the other gives the power items
---
This must now be fixed since last night I bought an "Advanced Power Connectors Plan" or something similar from a vendor for I think 280 caps.
---
The haunting eyes on that damn thing. I can still see them long after I stop. 
---
So it's not *just* cosmetic :).
---
&gt;  I meam

me too buddy, meme too

For a net of +2 with its weight.

Btw ultra light is better than deep pocketed for carry weight unkess you have light frame maxed.

As above, this must now be fixed since last night I bought an "Advanced Power Connectors Plan" or something similar from a vendor for I think 280 caps.

Lol

I'm off work by 3p today. If you are still looking. I can make the first 2 tiers of upgrades ( treated or resistant). I'm Agent_August.  I'll sell you one for 300 caps.

u/BlackValor83
---
I spent about 30 minutes looking for something interesting there and found maybe three/four glowing ones and a handfull of radberries.  A waste of a nuke.
---
Still a huge amount of people in this sub that havent realised that the existence of this game is to be a Fallout vanity contest in the atom store for whales.
---
Much like there are new versions or raider armor in 76 (trapper, etc) I'd love to see versions of raider power armor, or mods based around each of the Raider tribes, maybe even set bonuses themed to each.
---
It's under resources it's the fertilizer wheel barrow 
---
I'm waiting
---
Well, you‚Äôve definitely misjudged the majority of people‚Äôs feelings on this lol. 
---
You aren‚Äôt correct imo either but hopefully you can see why you‚Äôve been downvoted so much. 
---
Pic of the broken helmet?
---
How did you see through his disguise
---
Changed my downvote to an upvote for the Judge Dread refrence.
---
Thx for an answer, I'll try to do it that way.
---
I had a chuckle. I love in-game photo ops.
---
Kill everything on the way to the Harper's Ferry Vendor (the drops generally get 200 caps with Hard Bargain). Unless you get ghouls only then you might have to circle a bit ... Super Mutants and Scorched usually have great weapon drops. 
---
There are some outfits "that are not bent" that go for 44 caps (Hard Bargain 3/Charisma 5) each.
---
I find that weapons get a better return than the drugs and are easier to farm quickly (although I save the drugs for lazy days and run with Pharma Farma 3).
---
But just my take on it.
---
My mirelurk, and previous sloth and deathclaw fought at my camp when enemies appeared. You might have a glitch. The deathclaw and mirelurk had a white health bar and still fought, the sloth wanted to kill team mates because it had a red health bar.
---
Problems with the local birdlife?
---
Are you saying "almost the same stats" or "halved"?  And what are you going for that powerarmor gives you that regular armor doesn't?  Just the carry weight bonus?  The +2 STR?  Jetpack?
---
Just trying to get an idea of what you don't like from power armor that you want to get rid of and what you do like that you want to keep.
---
Uhm hello! How you think level 470 got so beefy in 1 month? Howd he get so ballsy?  Are you aware that people sat in front of traps in DROVES spamming the action button for like, a million xp in 10 minutes? Have you seen any of the countless youtube exploit tutorials, with an ample amount of thankful, eager comments? And youre really gonna try and tell me that that has nothing to do with people feeling confident enough so early in the game's lifecycle to quite literally level new players? Get real dude.
---
Like, have you been to the bazaar? Can I ask you: why are the TSEs so cheap now? I straight up bought two for barn door plans lol. Why do parties of four all have the same exploding shotty? The proof is literally everywhere like hello???? 
---
Again; you arent experiencing the shittyness, thats great. Doesnt mean it isnt a thing, I mean literally just scroll down the front page. Youre really tryna tell me the sky is green at this point, I wont have it! Lol
---
Associated with

Yeah I have full demo perk.  Running lv 1s on the heavy weapon damage since I used to be pure melee
---
This was disappointing for a lot of people, including myself. 
---
I loved the energy weapons in the other games. 
---
I have the Ultracite laser gun plan and havent even bothered crafting it for Mods because the damage is so low. like 19 a hit at lvl 50? really? I'm a rifle build so i've got most of the damage cards too. 
---
Also I have yet to see and legendary laser pistol/rifle.. I know they exist, but are they really just that rare?

Anyway I hope to see these weapons get a buff. That being said, I hope they fix the ash/goo pile looting first because I wouldn't use them if I cant loot.

honestly, if you leave the trading window, and start the trade again, everything you sold to the vendor will be in his window.. at a much higher buyback rate. This has happened to me a few times, and I just get the stuff back. You sometimes may have to wait a minute if the server is lagging behind

I started treasure hunting after level 50 and can absolutely confirm this is the ONLY way to find excavator mods.  Mostly found in the savage divide and toxic valley.  Forest area still yields garbage but most likely because its the starting area.  Also, I would not be surprised if the treasure mounds are tied to the area level I.E. if another player is in the area before you and the enemies are scaled to that player's level.  I could be wrong and in need of an adjustment on my tinfoil hat though...
---
Awesome story! 
---
Love the jump scares. 
---
I've seen Mothman 3 times in my lvl 71 solo existence. 
---
First time was around lvl 13 not far from Mothman museum. This occasion he simply shot out of site as I approached. 
---
Second time was around lvl 30 ish some where north central map. Running along at night through some woods, as I enter a clearing I notice the black figure and 1 of his eyes perched on a mountain side ledge. Since he wasn't watching me, I decided to sneak attack with my rifle. He was around the same lvl so figured i'd chance it. Once I took the shot and damaged him for a measly 10% he shot out of existence again.
---
The third time... I was cruising along the mountains near the Dam in the north. Doing my usual VATS scanning suddenly I see Mothman's back. He was listed in vats as "Stalking Mothman". Or something to that affect. Now I'm thinking "I have him this time. I pull out The Dragon and load it. Still in sneak mode, I creep closer to ensure all 4 rounds hit. 
---
At this point He is only 30ish yards away. Fire! Suddenly Mothman is at about 20% HP. He vanishes and appears behind me. Mothman made Mothman threatening sounds and takes another round from The Dragon to the chest. Suddenly he is at about 3% HP and shoots to the sky screeching. No kill but he did leave an ash pile with a broken wing and some meat. 
---
I think he was lvl 37 this go around. One tough cookie.
---
I don‚Äôt use PA on either character. My melee character tanks the queen without issue - in a hazmat. It‚Äôs more than possible, you just have to build for it. 
---
Don‚Äôt worry about metal armor. Scorch attacks are energy, as are robots. BoS combat is the best bang for your buck, heavy if possible. 
---
Barbarian, Evasive, Ironclad, Grounded, Scaly Skin are all easy ways to get like 200+/300+ without armor. Add dodgy for more mitigation. Add empath for 25% less damage. Strange in number and class freaks required. 
---
Then I am severely bugged bc Ibdidnt realize that and my serums have been on for three days...ummm. &gt;.&gt;
---
I'm pretty sure you can close and open the vendor to buy items again, but they will cost way more then you got for them.
---
These videos remind me of how terrible pistols are. Man, you are a masochist.
---
Serieusly... Well FML then... I rage quit the game haha 
---
Dont know why youre getting downvoted; this is literally what we mean when we say that the economy is fucked. Quick, downvote it so it cant be seen! Fucken gargoyles!!
---
And the effect that would have in performance would likely be negligible, if it had any effect at all. 
---
They don't need to close it, just remove the sticky. They can always go back to it, only difference is that a new thread will be stickied.
---
üëçThanks! 
---
Had the same reaction my first encounter with the hermit crab. Running by what I thought was just another derelict, stationary vehicle...
---
Is it a two-shot?
---
Total rubbish lad, the blokes down the office betta' look at this one.
---
You mean exploit broken and stupid game "features"? You have to get to them to actually claim the bounty. And if you destroyed anything of theirs you lost the advantage of being able to shoot first. But metagaming stupid PvP mechanics and one shotting people with 2 shot explosive legendaries is this games PvP. Anyone who actually likes PvP isn't going to be putting up with that stupid BS for long. And destroying some noobs base because they picked a lock they didn't know they weren't meant to doesn't seem like something a "real G" does.
---
They will attack and are a major nuisance. I'd rather fight a Wendigo than a Mothman.
---
Yeah but that would create an annoying issue in game for non dupers. I dont want to pick up a few weapons/armors to scrap and have to do them one by one and scroll through my inventory like that. 
---
Their tears sustain me.
---
That‚Äôs an entirely different industry, with an even more diverse market. It‚Äôs not relatable. 
---
Ikr?! I had wondered about it, but finally confirmed last night. It opens up some good pvp interactions.
---
Our first bounty ran away over 5 caps, leaving his base exposed without an honorable defense. Next time he'll think twice about trying to steal from that water purifier!!
---
It shouldn't be necessary, but in a game like FO76 it's an incredible improvement. For companion apps, they are just a more accesible way to a game's contents. And we all now that FO76 has a lot of content. So an official companion would be a real good thing.
---
good bot
---
I keep trying the spot near abbies bunker and thunder mountain, but I get mad and go past abbies bunker into the mountains, there is a pond up there with a crashed vertibird. The random encounter spawns on the west side of the pond. You can also head to the right of the fissure site at the top of the map to get to it. 
---
Once again. What do others‚Äô xp gains have to do with another player lol? Unless you are playing 76 for pvp you have nothing to complain about. Also, you still have no proof that all high levels use glitches. There are people who have no life or jobs and can play games all day lol. Stop exaggerating and just grind if it‚Äôs that big of a deal haha. 
---
My wife is really into CoD/Destiny on xbox, is isnt into fallout sadly else id get her to join in. 
---
dude, every time I go to a new server I see 24 names and only recognize maybe 1 or 2 
---
Oh you meant the lasagna lol... lil wayne
---
Umm even the glowing or deasied ones?
---
Guess I could be wrong but I know it was a higher lv than me and it was out by the big maw and I thought I was like lv 40 when I first got to that area
---
I'll check my past clips and see if I got a video
---
Yeah the dude on the pictures is holding a auto combat rifle from the looks of it. When in doubt, sound it out!
---
Lmao I was talking about your comment, the thread subject is also great and I will be doing this, thanks and enjoy the karma my lasagna ;)
---
What's the nuke zone like in Watoga? I have a few key cards and want to do someplace different.
---
or fixing the audio so that I can plug or unplug my headphones in mid game without losing sound entirely and having to restart the client
---
My opinions on it are 
---
* need more pvp dedicated areas (no slap system)
---
* cap damage for pvp
---
*pvp events - would be cool if when a vault opens you could choose to be a responder or raider . Depending which side you choose , you will have to either protect or kill the newly released vault dwellers 
---
* slight changes to wanted system-
---
     - don‚Äôt make it so easy to get a 5-10 bounty 
---
     - make the whole group wanted 
---
     - some type of item to show how many bounties              you‚Äôve collected would be cool 
---
Makes sense hahaha. 
---
That‚Äôs a shame, I was at least hoping to be able to get my ass kicked by a giant moth. Thanks for the help.
---
Can we look at balancing the strength of weapons, especially explosive bullets? They are overpowered. I watched someone one shot a scorchbeast. It's a bit much and its current state, it really steamrolls any builds when everyone is forced to go after the same type of weapon.
---
This may be the first time in my gaming history that I've ever requested a nerf.
---
I grew up solely using controllers because I had consoles, not computer games.
---
The biggest factor in my case, though, is arthritis. It fucking hurts so much to use m&amp;k for gaming. It sucks. :( I'm not even old! I just have shitty joints that betrayed me way early.
---
I just think Bethesda need to make it more clear what perk cards effect. A list of what weapons are in what category would be nice.
---
Its sad, but I like it when other players comment on my armour paint and ask for a photo with me.... :-)
---
You don't need 2 Calibrated Shocks mods. You only need one mod, plus the materials required for a 2nd one.  
---
When you open the PA station's crafting screen with the Shocks mod in your inventory, it'll show you Calibrated Shocks as a recipe on your PA legs. Make sure you have ALL the materials required on the list before doing this, or you will need a 2nd mod for your other leg.  
---
I'll break it down into steps:  
---
1. Open PA station crafting screen with Shocks mod in inventory  
---
2. Attach Shocks mod to one leg (NOTE: As soon as you do this, you cannot close the crafting screen anymore until you attach the 2nd mod, or you will forget the "recipe" you had due to the mod being in your inventory)  
---
3. Navigate to your other PA leg without closing the crafting screen  
---
4. Craft the 2nd Calibrated Shocks mod onto the 2nd leg (this time the game will use up the materials listed in the recipe)  
---
You now have Calibrated Shocks on both legs using only one mod and the materials required for the 2nd one. You don't need a 2nd mod unless you attached the Shocks to one leg and closed the crafting screen already. The reason this works apparently is because the game "teaches" you the recipe for the mod temporarily when you open the crafting screen, possibly to allow you to choose it from the list and attach it in the first place. So as long as you don't close the crafting window after attaching them, you will still "know" the recipe for the mod you attached as long as you don't close the crafting window after attaching them. You can then go ahead and craft them normally using your materials as if you knew the plans/recipe for the mod.
---
Note that you still use up the mod when attaching it, and forget the recipe after closing the crafting window after doing this, so if you want to attach Calibrated Shocks to a seperate set of armor you'd have to get another mod for that.
---
iirc it works with PC, PS4 from the get go.

---
I assume there was a hiring frenzy.
---
I mean. I HOPE. 
---
I find that the last one isn't always on top.  And certainly wouldn't risk that when trying to scrap/drop/sell an empty frame.
---
A good way to differentiate, is to drop all your frames, and pick up the one that you want to work with.
---
Picked up items rarely match and so rarely stacks anyway.
---
The next Mothman you see will be called Vengeful Mothman and yeah it's actually a unique fight, he teleports around and spreads his wings to unleash moths that swarm you
---
Or at least be able to build a higher leveler to create a level base above ground.
---
I'm on my X too and that is the exact same circumstances for me. Does the next item in line shake for you when you deposit something? 
---
I built mine ‚Äúin a van down by the river‚Äù  find that
---
Lol @ "predatory tactics".
---
You mean the same tactics that *every retailer ever* uses? I imagine you don't buy much.
---
I'm on PC, but I remember I found the plans on the trainyard by The Whitespring. Good luck!
---
Had two drop legendaries for me last night as well. However they were crap. Nocturnal wood leg and Hunters trapper chest piece. 
---
Where‚Äôd you get it for ¬£10?
---
Did you have a bounty on your head or playing at a weird time?
---
Alright, now, I don't know if this has been suggested yet, I'm honestly somewhat sure it has, but can we please get an ammo break down option at the tinkerer's bench? Honestly I just want all the lead from the .38 ammo which I have never used.
---
Bethesda is saving their stellar light for Starfield.
---
What do the lights you are trying to get look like?  Is it the lit arrow signs?
---
Desperate recruiter needed to make mission for the month.
---
First of all, you're right, it is old and idk how you even found it lol. Anyways thats kinda true but it seems like this game is especially prone to making people get burnt out super quick. I felt this way within 2 weeks of the game coming out. I did compare multiplayer to hanging out with friends however, because, a game shouldn't have an endgame being hanging with friends. Thats not gameplay because its just being social. Also, yes, many games do have a endgame grind for more gear, but that usually isnt all there is to do. Its usually other stuff to go along with it. Fallout 76 makes me feel like thats all there is to do.
---
The worst bit is, even if you‚Äôre careful, I‚Äôm pretty sure Uranium Fever repairs will scrap them without warning. 
---
Respecc for the pc I sadly don't have.
---
One improvement (that I use myself with that setup). Have a floor plate inside connected to the generator and then the door. That way you can shut off the switch while inside and have the leaving process automated (step on plate to open door, run through, and the door shuts behind you).
---
The overpowered nature of automatic weapons is always offset by scarcity of ammo.  Up the damage but increase the rates of fire.  Yes, it'll blow through that moleman but you'll be out of bullets 10x faster.
---
You're living my dream.
---
Marquee Arrows I believe is what the plans are called - I know I've seen them at vendors before.
---
Picked up a decent ripper last night not home add Torquemada75 I‚Äôll be on this evening. Might be a vampire? 
---
But you can craft it
---
CD Keys, just before Christmas, it's up to ¬£12.99 now but still cheap...
---
And if you get a few pieces of armor with the -8% damage from players, and slap on wasteland wanderer (if running solo)..
---
Then it becomes really difficult for a player to kill you, even with two-shot explosive weapons. (They really can only kill you via melee staggers, which you can also work on mitigating via the "Pneumatic" mod and adamantium skeleton.
---
Lmao me neither bro i‚Äôm on the box but we got FO4 mods tho
---
I chuckled with that mission. It wasn't THAT bad. The most challenging part was awkward waypoints.
---
That's something that really needs to be fixed. Like what's the purpose of that item at all if it's just a switch pylon? We already have switch objects.
---
Hazmats viable if you have enough sneak and escape artist.  I survived fine, the only thing that got me was a DC when we had her down to 25% health
---
but youre looking at it from the wrong angle. you seem to think that your character+armor bonuses are "baseline", and that taking off that armor makes you lose points. im saying your character is baseline, and that armor points are bonuses you get in addition to the baseline. special points have passive benefits and youre already gaining those.
---
....if 100k players got ahead using an exploit that allowed them to gain many levels over the competetion (that no longer exists to be abused for new players) that would render said competition (competition here being new players and players who dont use exploits) in /very big trouble/, especially if those 100k players are assholes who choose to main raiding and griefing. How does half the player base getting some much further ahead than the other half, not negatively affect the half that either missed out or had honor? Again, grandma wasnt trying to pvp dude. Grandma wouldnt have gotten raided so early in the lifecycle in this game if half the player base didnt exploit theyre way to an early endgame.
---
Is that really not clear to you? I really dont know how to make this any clearer. Idk what to tell ya 
---
This is correct.  I've done it twice. Im not sure if it works if you leave the server before reset, as I immediately fixed my mistake by buying it back.
---
Yeah, but we're talking about in-game hairstyles here, dude.
---
I was gonna make a post on this the other day and I forgot. Thanks for the reminder. 
---
Actually on top of Howells Cave is a cemetery with a union hat spawn there
---
Easily top 3 bases I've seen for Fallout 76!
---
Having it in a area where things spawn in, so it looks like you actually live there and have decorations etc pushes this base to #1 imo. Well done! 
---
Is this PC? How did you get the walls to clip?
---
Got off it about an hour ago. So kinda odd for the east coast.
---
That's definitely not Ashly Burch voicing Rose.
---
Can confirm he‚Äôs doing okay. I was at a nuke zone with some friends and he strolled past the chaos with 0 care in the world. Love that guy. 
---
If you're on xbox, I'll be your buddy!
---
If any of you are on PC and looking for some company, feel free to look me up.

WarlockyGoodness 
---
I can build most camp objects, can craft most weapons, and some armor. 
---
1 I used the black Dymond to get me through the majority of the game hahaha. One of my favorite Quest Rewards.
---
What a lazy, bullshit and dishonest reply. I get more truth or of the blue hairs than you neck cheese growing fucks. Seriously.
---
I have an upgraded suit I can sell. 
---
Eh I'm all for trying different Nuke Zones. White Springs is getting old. The Queen is still decent but it seems WS is the go to spot.
---
Yes. I have 288 purified water on me, thats 144 weight, but with thru hiker it becomes just 14.4 weight. Junk you scrap and then put in your stash, and the bonus doesnt count in your stash. Some people carry huge amounts of junk on them because of the perk and then they die and lose it all. Much safer to stash it.
---
?!?
---
My daughter will want to play more if there‚Äôs pink... especially with glitter. 
---
I‚Äôm also a power gamer level 174 and that‚Äôs with a break since Christmas. 
---
Imagine all the untouched loot at the different locations across the world. All the junk you could dream of....right at your fingertips. Amazing. No griefers, no dupers causing your server to lag....the possibilities are endless lol.
---
100 pcs each, but common things I ever use (ceramic, glass, bone, concrete...) I just sell them out asap.
---
Steel, I keep +200 in stock... scared of accidentally scrapping mod boxes.
---
You were like Patrick slamming his rock into spongebob over and over
---
SPIDERRS SPIDERS SPIDERS SPIDERS
---
What console are you on, and what kind of power armor do you need calibrated shocks for?
---
Shooting at a target doing 16,000 Mph (7 300 m/s).  Should be easy.
---
You have my support at least, hate free loaders
---
Honestly, the Atom store is just... underwhelming. From the presentation, to the pricing, to the quality of the items, there's just very little in there that's worth having unless you really take a shine to a specific item.
---
Yup, I've learned over the course of crashing so many times how to avoid it mostly though. Take one legendary out, open pipboy to skip the legendary slideshow, then take another one out of stash. I'm guessing it hates loading all the effects and queuing up the slideshow at the same time.
---
* me continuing the eternal fight PS - Xbox *
---
Yes please! :)
---
I'm sure there's a lot of a team going "This isn't my job, I can't do it" and passing it to another team who they in good faith think CAN do it. The second team's response then ends up being "This isn't my job either, I can't do it" before trying to pass it along to someone else. 
---
Lather, rinse, repeat.
---
I see it all the time where I work, and as the person who finally has to do the weird thing to get someone's issue resolved, it's frustrating, but at the same time super normal to see.
---
Fallouts all about mom's and 11 year old kids?!
---
It's worth it IMO this is the best quest line in the game.
---
Bright blue and orangey-pink w/ dolphins pls
---
I haven't been motivated to get on today, is why im here, trying to get that urge back
---
about to just go into town irl and find something better to do lol
---
redditors have a perverted and contradictory sense of justice? ya don't say...
---
A girl can dream!!!!!!
---
I have only seen mothman spawn when I'm outdoors at night with a flashlight on. 
---
Haha that's great
---
I've wasted countless bullets shooting dead things that don't fall 
---
Oh I already knew that, I was saying that the armor points should contribute to your special points  so you can put on more perk cards where the points were added
---
I already know it has passive benefits but those passive benefits are practically useless, it should do as the description says and add the specialpoints when you wearing it so you can equip more
---
Dude once again you don‚Äôt understand 76. The level is capped at 50 regardless. That would take like 2 weeks of moderate grinding to achieve lol glitches or not 50 is the cap so once again your exaggeration is proving to be futile at explaining your points. Also, half the player base would be like 500k. I have rarely seen people over level 150 so your exaggeration of how wid the xp glitch usage is disturbing. 
---
Why downvote? This is an honest question, this sub has so many questionable people, very suspicious really.
---
I never even thought about that. Did it still crash you, ever so often, or did that completely eliminate crashing for you? 
---
Get the handmade rifle Plans.
---
Event at the prison
---
I have yet to see a game with pvp has does not have "a seriously toxic chunk of players" so that is hardly unique to to FO76, and my experience (lvl 125+) has been limited to two instances of players exhibiting 'toxic' behavior, which is much lower than many other games I have played.  PVP gets discussed frequently so I don't see anyone sweeping its issues under a rug.
---
Think I'ma go mothman hunting now
---
Thx for the tip
---
Hmm maybe.. I hope so. There's quite a few things I've found that I can't do shit with right now and I'm really hoping that it wasn't just Bethesda neglecting the content
---
Over Thanksgiving and Christmas and New Years?  Maybe, but tough timing.
---
I got some at some point and I definitely didn‚Äôt pay for them. So pretty sure it can be random but your best bet is the vendor. 
---
This. A full set of anything assassin's and sentinels. Sounds op as hell from what I've seen, and especially PvP.
---
They have had data mined info about future items. Maybe they'll be reduced or the community will explain how they feel (again) and Bethesda will... Change... The prices??..... Yeah... Ok
---
No it shouldn't. Unyielding armor would further be broken if it did.
---
Low hp builds can get 20+ in revert start.
---
sounds good, anything but the white screen.
---
Oh man it's so scary when you're not expecting them to teleport to you. Those first encounters are always a bitch haha
---
Dang. I've been to the space station probably 3 times and didn't realize there's an Alien Blaster in the vicinity. I'll have to go back. As a big Alien fan, it's one of my favorite areas anyway.
---
Strange, I've shot Wanted people in their base before with explosive weapons and automatically go Wanted myself. 
---
I think it's more of a way to get back at the annoying assholes.
---
Where's your base?
---
Except farming for weights usually requires server hoping in which you will lose your workbench. Unless of course you meant farming for weights in all the gym locations on a single server. 
---
Butcher's Bounty 4eva

I gave up on doors. I just show up at camp, build mode, remove wall, enter, replace wall. Lmao.

Would be awesome if we could just put in a youtube or twitch user and watch it on the tv
---
Aren't 5 star weapons coming?
---
I am at work but can add you when I am off! 
---
I want to support that statement but I guess I'm just too jaded at this point. Better to let Bethesda die and free up the market space for someone else.
---
I cap it around 5 bulk of everything, and haven't really run into issues yet. 
---
Thank you so much for the response now I can acuallly get these weapons now
---
Not sure what platform you are on, but that is not the case on PC.  
---
I believe so yea, but sooner the better. 
---
hand made plans from Watoga BOS Vendor or Watoga Trainyard Vendor. If you don't get from them the only other method is from the Prison Event which in all my levels (98) I've not seen or gotten to proc once... Someone else got in from inside the prison but i think that was just random luck.
---
You shot him and he's the prick???
---
You can also add the riverside area run+Nuka power plant all within distance area. 
---
I use explosive heavies as well I'd recommend lvl 3 heavy Gunner perks if you can swing them that additional 60% damage is really nice
---
I concur- its called marquee arrows. I would try looking at the vendors in ash heap: welch, lewisburg, charleston fire station
---
Haha, as I said, first one who sends a friend  request wins :D No matter if you do it with the app
---
I think difficult is not the correct word here. More like unusual.
---
Also speaking from experience, most of these companies generally don't encourage out of the box thinking as they tend to impact productivity. That said, a properly trained staff should have an escalation process to resolve such tickets whether it's management or customer relations etc.
---
Issues like this are why I don't give ETAs on a complete resolution, as I run the risk of not meeting it. Instead I'll set a follow-up appointment to keep the customer in the loop, though I admittedly don't deal with large numbers of issues all at the same time. I typically only have 5-6 active issues at a given time.
---
Piggybacking on this one in case the times aren't suitable. I too can make you a modded one for free. Please don't purchase one. I'll be on around 6 pm. Txcowboy69. Also, I found the plan in harpers ferry, building with a big hole in the wall, check all of the glass cases. Some are on the 2nd and 3rd floor and you have to go around back and jump on the crashed train car to get up there. And Lonestranger sorry for piggybacking lol

What's a good one to join?
---
Yeah 37 year old mom, I play when my daughter is asleep. Sometimes with my friends, sometimes my husband. 
---
The key pad pylon will work without knowing the correct code, what he was saying is using the key pad door (located under walls at the very bottom)
---
Unless the person knows the code they aint getting in unless they blow the door down. Though it's kinda one way without you rigging up an exit pad/switch.
---
What's the bug? I bet they can't fix it if you think it's unplayable when it's not.
---
Also if you're on pc and haven't formatted your pc they're are still things you can do.
---
Just make each card of science boost energy weapon damage for like 5%. 3 cards = 15%. Not a bad increase and sorely needed.
---
I can make a suit add me on PlayStation @ Grazkhul they're 500 each for treated 
---
CRASH, BAM, ALAKAZAM!
---
Last night it froze on me 3 times and crashed my entire xbox once before I gave up for the night. Comparatively it only froze on me once in the last week before the patch.
---
That‚Äôs definitely not an unpopular opinion 
---
Yeah, I can see that. I know it's all new. Idk why they don't bring some creation club items over. *shrugs*
---
Ta
---
I have an Instigating Power Fist, 3 star with 40% swing speed and 15% damage reduction when blocking that dropped from one of the Uranium Fever mobs that I love!  I just wish I could use it with power armor, or that they would fix the hazmat suit so I can wear it over my normal armor.  I can use it everywhere but nuke events.
---
Thank you I will look out for those insulting trolls :) (even though I can probably kill them)
---
 Buffs/stat bonuses still work, you will notice the soups show 0% for hunger/thirst. 
---
I am a Herbivore and will occasionally eat meet (scorchbeast stuff) for the bonuses. 
---
True true.  I'm going to get those maxed.  I'm just prioritizing the crippling and armor pen first
---
&gt;I'm pretty sure in 4-6 months I can learn how to make canvas thread, learn to use a loom and make my own canvas bag
---
im pretty sure you couldnt
---
Players being able to have vendor bots was discussed in pre-release material, I think it was either NoClip video, but maybe the E3 material.  
---
Yeah I can relate. That carpal tunnel pain is a bitch lol. People play games for all kinds of reasons... my reasons are competitive so I just can‚Äôt imagine playing against mouse users with a controller... at least if you do it on console everyone else is as handicapped as you are üòÇ
---
Is this bug related to the people decrypting nuke codes or is there another problem? I finally got to the point where I could launch a nuke, but none of the silos would let me in, even though I am a general. I assumed it was just bugged and I turned it off. Haven't been back on in days.
---
Where my Camp is, I've logged in and discovered him just a level lower... Never been brave enough to go near him

put that in brackets cause I'm really not sure how most feel about it. The youtubers are getting praise, upvotes, subs and more so abusing and effectively destroying the market / game
---
The Wise Mothman shows up after the Lighthouse Event also. 
---
I made a friend friend last night. He‚Äôs 13 and I‚Äôm 36. I‚Äôm lvl 145 and he‚Äôs lvl 12. I modded out his rifle, gave him some tips on his build and built him a fusion generator at his camp. I also took him to the west side of the map to fight some lvl 68 super mutants for XP.  Little dude wouldn‚Äôt stop thanking me lol. If he‚Äôs on tonight I‚Äôm gonna take him out scorch beast hunting. I‚Äôve always played solo so it was nice to be able to help someone out. 
---
I'm on PC. You literally cannot tell me that is "not the case", because it is something that I have categorically observed.
---
I never said it was representative of the entire playerbase, or indicative of anything other than in the region I'm slotting into, at the time I'm slotting in has few players.
---
Also, I have never queued for a server.
---
Well at the manor they take you inside the instance so this is the only case where you‚Äôd actually survive a nuke getting in one.
---
Did you crank the FOV settings too high? (if on pc)
---
Unpopular opinion: if I see another 3,000 posts with the word dupe in the title I'm going to be nauseous.
---
No worries, EMEA is the region you want...
---
This is exactly why I am looking to leave my current job.
---
That or the recipe on the box by Solomon's Pond!! I try every time.
---
Thanks for the information! How you got the Chameleon mutation? is it like a mod / plan you purchased?  
---
Just asking because I only know the armor parts...
---
Im lvl 35 and the only thing i have found this far is robo armor plans
---
it does add special points. but total current special points=/=active perk card slots; rather, base special=total perk card slots.
---
if it worked that way, it would have to work the other way, and cause special debuffs such as diseases and addictions to lower perk card slots. but if you have 9/9 agility slots filled and contract snot ear (-2 AGI), how is the game supposed to calculate which cards to unequip? if you have 5 INT and take a mentats and fill it up to 7/7, what is the game supposed to unequip when the mentats wear off?
---
plus it would make disease/addiction builds (plaguewalker and junkie legendary weps respectively) even more unbearable than they currently are.
---
Sent a request :) PSN is Cronolix
---
I kind of agree? but I think more so I feel like spreading the knowledge is helping to get it on Bethesda's radar so they can fix it? There's no easy answers here, really. If people want to cheat, they will search like crazy until they find out how. I don't think any of us are going to see any of the videos posted here and go, "you know what, I never really wanted to cheat before but now that I saw this I'm totally going to"? Or maybe I don't understand people üòÖ
---
My biggest hair related fear is that I'll never get dreadlocks in this game.  Ulysses had them, but he was a New Vegas character and they seem hell bent on not touching anything from that game.  
---
But yeah, overpriced limited edition crap like this banks on the hope that someone will say "oh shit, limited item!" and buy it, as unappealing as it is.
---
Except that people/griefers would exploit this by following someone, quickly placing their camp (with nothing built or very little) to get the buff and then try to kill them. 
---
I lock my door only when I'm home, and only for a couple of important reasons. #1. people can steal your power armor pieces if you are crafting/modifying it on a station. #2, MOBS can open doors to attack you, unless you have a lock on them. It keeps me safe while I step away for a few mins, or if I'm deep in a crafting menu. Other than that, I keep my doors and water purifiers wide open for anyone to utilize while I'm gone. 
---
So they do stack? That is really good to know.
---
I work nights and it's past my bedtime
---
This is also a problem on Xbox One, I‚Äôm getting really tired of doing the same quests over and over. 
---
Congrats! 
---
A group of use killed her in like 3-4 mins last night but I know others that consistently kill her in 2 or just over. We melted her last night and it was so fun. I got a Furious fast attack speed Grog's axe just for fighting her because each successful hit increases the damage so you end up crushing her. then I think we broke her because she flew in the same spot for the last 30 seconds or 1/5th of her Health. 
---
I think the best thing to do is announce that you are doing her  in the different subs and discord groups. you'll get a lot of turnout. I think the lowest guy fighting her when i dropped the bomb last night was level 29. So he/she probably didn't contribute much but at least there weren't any people hiding in the shed making her more difficult.
---
I literally just turned 45 last night. Godammit.
---
I hope they change this, it make no sense at all.
---
It was nice when loading from empty. However, if I ever needed to top off just one round, it would load five. 
---
It's the same as everything else in the game though. Eat a steak that boosts STR? No extra perk cards. Drink alcohol for the buffs? No extra perk cards. Use chems and skyrocket your SPECIAL? No extra perk cards. Get mutations that boost your special stats? No extra perk cards. 
---
Get a disease that lowers STR? You dont lose a card. Addicted to chems and have lower SPECIAL? You dont lose a card.
---
You are either asking for underarmors to behave differently than anything else, or you are asking for an entire new system. It's not going to happen 
---
IMHO It's Bethesda's own doing.
---
It's at the golf course, good protection but not from griefers..
---
I had one randomly attack me at my base . heres a video of it
---
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vViOh2WzKKg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vViOh2WzKKg)
---
Yaaay junk xP 
---
How much for just a standard one?
---
So did I! Guess I'll have to wait until 25 then 
---
Yeah, same. I popped to V76 to drop off some purified water and chems for some newbies. Meant to be friendly, puked instead. Dropped off what I meant to, heart'ed 'em as a farewell then proceeded to sprint away and nearly kill myself leaping off a nearby cliff with my recently-aquired marsupial mutation. 
---
Thank god for autostim/lifesaving armor. 
---
Are you wrong?  Difficult question... the FCC would mediate and act.. or not.  If there was a complaint.  Your argument seems to hinge on the "substantial updates" part.  That would be arguable.  The law seems to be trying to balance what is reasonable for technology manufacturers while still providing accessibility.  I'd say that fo76 is fine.
---
On the other hand, i'd say that fo76 should have had text chat in-game simply because it's a common feature that they should have known people would want.
---
Also it may still be coming... which would be more than enough.
---
Just sent you a message. 
---
another one for PVP:
---
a wanted player should not be able to retaliate without consequences. it is absolute bullshit that players can "seek revenge" on someone claiming a bounty. you did something wrong, the bounty is a punishment. you shouldn't be allowed to contest that and reclaim caps. took someone out that had a 110 cap bounty. the bounty had dropped to about 20-30 by the time i found and killed the guy. he comes back and one shots me with a pump shotgun. i lose 70 caps. he then proceeds to chase me and my teammate around, killing us repeatedly. i ended up launching a mini nuke at the floor, killing both of us, and giving my teammate time to claim the junk that he had stolen from both of us, which was quite the haul itself.
---
all this does is encourage the behavior that the mechanics are intended to dissuade. this seriously needs to be fixed.
---
This was a little text exposing a lot about yourself, penisgirl.
---
Very likely, but their target audience isn't the game's loyal fanbase, it's the rest of the majority that don't and *won't* play the game, those who have already decided they hate it (some of them without even trying it), because most gaming publications like this work essentially the same as any other news site: they make money through advertising and through clicks, they want to stir up the most shock or surprise or outrage, anything to get people to click onto that page, and a smear article like that is much more likely to get clicked on than a "boring" one telling the loyal fans who already love the game how "well" it's doing and the things it's getting right
---
I'm only one point from max perception so I doubt it.
---
It just needs to be fixed before the First big content release.
---
&gt;Spreading the knowledge is helping to get it on Bethesda's radar so they can fix it
---
I agree with this too. Kinda why I put it in brackets too. It took soo long for them to fix it. It's as if the glitch itself just dropped a nuke on the market and turned it into a wasteland of it's own.
---
I was a CoD and Fallout/Skyrim playing engineering student when my husband and I started dating, and he brought me over to the world of MMO's and Magic the Gathering. Both of which I love, but it is debatable whether or not this was a good thing. 
---
I have marquee Arrows plan on XB1 if thats what you mean.
---
That sounds pretty alright. Thanks!
---
I honestly don't know why they do half the stupid things they're doing anymore. I was a huge fan of Bethesda games prior to 76, but this game has me seriously scratching my head at them.
---
There is so much to love about FO76, but it's steadily getting drowned out by the massively broken stuff they can't seem to get on top of, and the sloppy and poorly-thought out Atom store isn't helping.
---
I'm fairly certain the Mothman is the only enemy I have yet to come across in 76. 
---
How about they fix the game first before they start implementing other services... Lol
---
dupe method was patched AFAIK.
---
Fixing the economy won't happen until they release new server/higher tier weapons.
---
11) Make Rad-away, Rad-away diluted, disease cures, and intobiotics apply to the traveling pharmacy perk. 
---
12) I have a 2 shot explosive combat shotgun and 2 shot explosive gauss rifile they are super god tier and my hope is they are not dupped by probably are. Lately I've noticed neither weapon has been degrading at all, my hope is that this is how they're indentifying duped items and will be removing them. I'll lose my 2 core weapons and the legit weapons/caps/armor I traded away for them, but is worth for the sake of the game. 
---
Yeah, I used it as well. They did say (oddly specifically) that they are going to address the issue. Which is cool, it's a great gun.
---
So sick of not actually being able to kill the annoying assholes. My base is in the Toxic Valley and I'm level 95+ and welcome anyone to make the first move, since that is the only way to PvP without being at an extreme disadvantage.
---
Lol I did create a new character,  that's what the thread is about haha. 
---
My alt account was originally made for what you just stated, but now its my main account.
---
I like that its such a hard component to find but I think there should be a way for us to produce ballistic fiber. Like you have to go on a quest into an old military factory to find the secrets of producing it. I think that even if they did this they should make it a hard thing to produce. Like it would require some rare things to make. I just really love the idea of producing things in this game and would like to see more added in.
---
This is untrue. You can purchase Serum Recipes from Science Wing. It is just a rare spawn chance. When it does spawn it cost 22,000 without hard bargain perk card. I have personally came across one while server hopping for X-01 Jet Pack which is also a not guaranteed spawn from the armory but it does appear there with all other X-01 Mods. It is just less than 1% chance to be there
---
Ah, didn‚Äôt know that. I was wondering why he disappeared when I shot him. 
---
Nobody is debating that. But it gets brought up as if they aren't aware of the issue.
---
They're aware. Duping sucks, it needs to be stopped. An extra few posts on the subreddit isn't going to make them move any faster or slower.
---
Combine this with the "evasive" perk and you're looking at pretty much non-stop stealth damage bonuses.
---
Stand, and crouch. Attack. Stand, crouch, attack. It's beautiful.
---
There are dozens of us! Dozens!
---
Go into Repair/modify and choose the torso, it'll be there :-)
---
"I am not high enough to hallucinate that"
---
*sniff*
---
"Now I'm good"
---
It is idiotic that you need to juggle this much to complete the quest. I've had it open at 4/10 since I was a low level because those golfers just *do not spawn* anymore due to the volume of high level characters running around. (And now that my alt is almost 50, I expect to never finish it.)
---
You sound like the type of person who looks for the top tier of any game you play
---
Once you get another mod that is...
---
if i didn't have a life or family I absolutely could. Might not be what ever they are making but I'm pretty sure it could be done. Just be cause YOU can't do something doesn't mean others can't.
---
Yeah, this is fair. I've actually never played an openly MP game where there wasn't some instances of griefing because of toxic players.
---
Proportionately, I've been griefed more in FO76 in about 100hr, than in say 1000hr of BF1. Even in Warthunder I've seen less griefing. Granted this is entirely anecdotal (I've probably been unlucky in FO76).
---
Now griefing in FO76 isn't even terribly consequential, but it is extremely annoying. I also find it extremely jarring because unlike other games where PVP is a core experience, FO76 is really a single player or limited coop game, where occosionally people parachute in. Sometimes to help. Sometimes to grief. The times when people parachute in to help are awesome, but the griefing really just throws off the entire game for a bit for me.
---
I'll second that. Pair it with adrenal reaction and a bloodied weapon and oh boy your DPS will go places you couldn't imagine. 
---
üòÅ
---
Aw man. I‚Äôm sorry. That really sucks.
---
It would be good to have the option of shooting and killing the vendor and stealing everything, but having to fight the L.V.D.F *Legendary Vendor Defence Force* who emerge from robot pods and have massive DPS making a fun battle, if you die you *loose* everything you stole, no bag or anything, but also including non junk items such a weapons.
---
That would be nice.
---
Yes, predatory tactics. Creating an artificial sense of scarcity and urgency over a digital/intangible thing that is literally limitless in supply. And no, I don‚Äôt buy much (nothing at all for this game, in fact) when it comes to over priced, digital items. I‚Äôm not an easily swayed sucker that they hope to take advantage of.
---
I saw one of those once... Was in the airport responder camp... I targeted it and saw "lvl 50" and Noped out 
---
You do not need any materials If you buy a mod, just install it.
---
A few extra posts talking about how the game is still negatively impacted **is exactly** what we need. There needs to be a solution for the damage caused. Since duping was patched already, we need a fix/solution for the **permanent damage** it has caused
---
Yeah that's makes sense, I used to use one gun army but I could never get it to go off so I swapped it out for bloody mess
---
Wait, so what would stack about the chameleon effect? I'm not saying I disbelieve, I just don't understand what exactly would "stack". 
---
I don't think the BOS vender carries it, but I could be wrong. The Harper's Ferry vendor carries it though. I have gotten 4 from him on my alt. 
---
Also, to OP, certain quests reward weapons like the All Hail and Perfect Storm. I dont remember the quest names off top just google the weapon names with Fallout 76 and you'll easily find the quests. You should wait til you are level 50 to do those so the weapon will be max level and more useful.
---
Maybe they were all sneaking.
---
It's really sad that people believe server instability is the fault of people exploiting.
---
It drops there after 40, I got it twice. It does not show up at vendors after level 25
---
It should be like the other mods where you go like you're going to "craft" that exact mod but instead of "craft" it will say "attach mod".
---
I would also check what it scraps down to before you scrap anything, and keep some of that loose scrap in your inventory just in case (probably steel). I've heard it will scrap mods first but I'm not totally sure of that, so this might be some added protection.
---
I'll make you a set for free of you bring the stuff. I'll sell you the stuff for 250 for a standard.
---
I'll sell you the plan for the suit for 750
---
Nice comment. I agree, problem I have is I come from Warframe, when it comes to Live service, Warframe was TRASH back in the day, it was saved by fans who believed but the difference is, the Dev teams.
---
I just like complaining about stuff tbh. Not in a awful way, but, you can't improve otherwise. I should honestly tell some people, take my rant with a grain of salt but too late.
---
I don't follow fortnite either so, that's glad to know for info too. Thanks.
---
Hopefully before all the so called data mined items from the atom store get released they'll have settled on a price range. Idk
---
Well yeah...
---
It makes sense if you don't think about it
---
This happened to me around launch. Pretty sure it's a bug, but hey, I'm okay with Beth leaving it in.
---
I know, but still an alien!
---
See, your comment got me thinking. So now, because you want to farm the wanted bounty, friends and teammates cant claim it from you. And if your friends unfriend, we added a 48 debuff for the game registering you guys as not friends. This debuff only applies if you are wanted at the time or if your friend is wanted and one of you unfriend the other.  
---
So now you kill a cow, 500 caps on your head, and only random strangers can kill you for it. If you want those caps to go to friends, you will have to survive for 2 days in game. The debuff doesnt apply while you're offline either. Murder another cow, now the penalty is even higher. You take 50% more damage from everything and theres 1000 caps on your head. Do it again and you get a soft ban. Similar to the one already in place for not being able to pay the bounty when you die. Huge debuff for player character for let's make it 24 online hours. 
---
Is that penalty enough for you? Keep in mind, the more loopholes you find, the more harsh the patches and nerfs will become. 
---
This is Bethesda. The risk of accidental spawns is too high. 
---
They‚Äôre receivers that often do more damage than hardened ones and do extra damage to scorchbeasts. Even if you don‚Äôt care for the weapon, it also lets you craft the ultracite ammo if that caliber. That‚Äôs useful if you have a friend upgrade you combat shotgun to prime and all you can find for yourself is double barrel plans.
---
Don‚Äôt toss them
---
Main reason I've stopped playing for now.  Heavy weapons weigh next to nothing with "Bear Arms" but my modded .308 and my gauss weigh 17 and 20+  and there's nothing I can do about it.
---
Really? Il test my luck with it. Hope I can get it to activate whenever I take her on. 
---
You can make an alt character then get it to level 15 and server hop Harpers Ferry vendor for Handmade plans. That's what I had to do.
---
I just want to say THANK YOU GUYS SO MUCH! THIS GAME IS AMAZING! Please keep up all the hard work. And I'm super excited for the next big update! But the main problem/glitch I've been running across is when my compass gets turned around. Very annoying but I found that entering my pip boy and switching the display corrects this. Just a little annoy when I'm playing with a low level guy and there like "where are you going?" I ran across a issue with having too many halotapes. But I read a post on here how dropping some will help. But I am not complaining about this. Mainly just wanted to say thanks for this great game!
---
Never mind pictures, why can't we load a 3D preview of pretty much anything in the store?  A shot from 1 angle is kinda limiting.  Probably wouldn't take long to pull your last used character and apply the item to it, or just display the camp object in 3D.
---
If the prices were low enough I wouldn't care as much, and the tuxedo pack is kind of a good example of something I'd probably grab on impulse, but if it costs more than that per item I'm gonna want to inspect it.
---
That‚Äôs always an option yes, if anything obsidian could just take over 
---
Breaking news folks!
---
Its lovely!  Shame it'll be destroyed when bethesda "loses" your camp again
---
The prison event is called 'Patrol Duty' or something similar. Some people have had success with this one as far as getting the handmade plans' others seem to grind it endlessly for nothing.
---
It is not a hoax. They sell for a minimum of 10,000 Caps. As you know the vendors do not get above 200 caps so they would not be able to even sell it to the vendor
---
Yea thanks dude, that sword sucks, wish it was better, but this sentry bot helmet is a hundred times cooler
---
I‚Äôve encountered him a total of like 8 times in the roughly 100-150 hours of surviving. 
---
Once as a random encounter (can‚Äôt remember where) he fought me. I killed him. He only seems to spawn at lvl 35. The second time was at Fort Defiance, I was going for a supply drop and the event that takes place out front was happening and he spawned and attacked me. It was kinda hectic but I killed him again. The remaining times I encountered him, I shot at him and he just flew away.
---
Ironically I‚Äôve never been to the lighthouse or to
---
The shrine or whatever in Point Pleasant.

So my husband and I were playing together last night and we fast traveled to Charleston Station to unload some stuff before doing our next quest. As soon as I load in, I run for the station (gotta get to that vendor before my husband because he takes *forever*). My husband, sitting a few feet away from me, goes "Uh, Kayla?." I look over at him IRL and he's staring at his screen like it's possessed. So I turn around in-game and there's a mothman just chilling right next to my husband's character. 
---
My husband - ever the calm, stoic type - is pulling out his black powder pistol to make sure it's loaded and ready, planning his method of attack. I, however, just pull out my shotgun and start wailing on the thing. Fortunately it stayed rooted to the spot and took every hit to the face so we killed it and made off with the goods, but in retrospect I realize that could have gone very, very poorly.
---
yepp agreed, I am lvl 27 and I realize also that the way from lvl 20 &gt; 30 is really slow and boring doing the same quests as armor and guns are not so strong to reach-out higher level areas...  
---
It depends what the mod's for, that's what mat you get (Black Titanium for Excavator Mods, etc) 
---
I had seen elsewhere that there was some sort of bug preventing nukes, but I was more talking about things like their "End of the month" news, which was just links to every piece they wrote on it.
---
Ye but if you compare her to even the shittiest of npc's in the other games shes awful.
---
Sneaking does seem to work a little in PA, but it's greatly reduced. As far as I can tell "evasive" no longer works, though. Which is fair. Harder to lose track of a giant whirring pile of yellow metal.
---
something anything is better than that white screen.
---
Just change camp location it stores everything 
---

---
Can this be responded to so we know the devs are aware of the issue.  Acknowledgement is half the battle in your PR game.
---
That's a good question about the camps. We agreed to restrict our area to one location like Ash Heap or Savage Divide. I'll let you know about it. As far as how you know when people are close by there's a radio station that unlocks once you engage in the game.
---
 It gives you quick beeps and the game even tells you the frequency of Beats tells you how close you are to your target. Your compass will recognize them as  a hostile. What's the game gets started it gives you 2 minutes to separate. Also the radio station will update you if you're target fast travelled saying "evasion detected updating last known location"
---
The mothman and flatwoods monsters always teleport away before i can kill them. its happened 3 or 4 times now and it just pisses me off. but yea i agree, the first time i saw the mothman it scared the bejebus out of me
---
It could easily just be my bad luck lol bloody mess is the only luck perks I can get to go off regularly and it just explodes enemies 
---
It wasn't patched. Well...it sort of was. Some jackass already posted the youtube video here about the "new" glitch.
---
Someone is duping the posts
---
Duping the dupers
---
dupe
---
You were also lucky at only 7 hours... 
---
Does the mothman have any notable loot? 
---
Its not patched. People are still doing it. Just look at the workshop and how magically people group up at them all of a sudden. Idk the method but have found a stash bag and came to the conclusion that was WHY workshops are so widely used now.
---
Maybe it's not their base and juat some poor random schmuck's base they decided to take shelter in
---
Well go elsewhere...
---
no, people aren't going to stop it. The sooner you adapt to things that are going to stay that way, the better for you.
---
I've been about 3 weeks last Iv'e been in whitesprings. Im going to go there soon enough though. Lots and lots of places to go besides that place. 
---
I might relocate my base to exactly there, as my camp next to SB spawn point has perhaps lived it's usefulness and fun. Haven't been at my camp since a week or more, Im sure it's totally nuked by the SB by now.
---
Though at some point Im  been looking for super great new place to set up permanent home. The place between prime fissure site and another fissure site seems better than perfect. Nice large house, set up workbenches for visitors.
---
Never Quit!  
---
Okay, i already sent the friend request and im waiting
---
And what it has sacrificed for that amazing story is any level of creative problem solving, as if you step even slightly outside of how Rockstar wants you to solve a mission, you fail it.
---
I'm 40, I work in a software development company that is 70% men and most of them under the age of 30, and I was the only person in the office to play the FO76 beta. They were all amazed and jealous at the same time ;) 
---
if any dupers wanna give me stuff i'm fine with it. i'd prefer stimpaks. i have 50 radaways for trade.
---
Yeah, same except I have killed 0. üòÖ
---
I was actually really happy when the nukes were broken because I could actually explore Whitesprings without being killed by every crazy high level enemy the level 100+s were pulling. Whitesprings is big and even if that other player is way on the other side of it I was still getting dozens of level 60+ bloated glowing feral ghouls attacking my level 22 (at the time). Gah.
---
I can‚Äôt say you‚Äôre wrong, all I wanted to do in a fallout game was to carry a badass laser rifle, wander around no problem and give 0 shits about anybody...
---
Oh how Bethesda is changing things
---
I went to my station to what I thought was installing, but it was scrapped. I have hundreds of steel in my stash and I'm just jaw dropped the game would allow me to act so foolishly. Damn my over-hyped self
---
Try it...
---
Mines in top of the savage divide on top of the map the only way to reach is to hike 15 -20 minutes or spawn in or jump in to it lol 
---
In BETA there was an actual radio you could build at your camp. I had 4 of them, one in each corner of my hut so the music came in loud and clear. Some day I hope they bring that radio back so my friends and I can sit in chairs drinking a nice cold Nuka Cola and sing along to the radio.
---
"Praise the lord and pass the ammunition"
---
Not gonna matter when the top tier weapons currently available are enough to wipe the floor with any players ass. What's the difference if new weapons that do the same shit get released?
---
Ok that makes sense, thanks! 
---
Ehh. I feel like that's not the hill to die on here. Predatory tactics are par for the course for retailers everywhere: car dealerships, food stores, internet providers; it's literally the way business is done nowadays. Although physical goods are obviously more limited in nature than digital ones, there's usually no correlation between scarcity and sales tactics.
---
The Atom store has a lot of things to complain about. Pricing, item quality, variety, etc. I feel like on the long list of "things I wish the Atom Store did better" sales tactics are at the bottom.
---
I've purchased exactly one item there (just to test out how it worked), and am sitting on thousands of Atoms that I won't spend until pricing comes down, or the items get more interesting. I don't care how they hawk their wares - if the wares suck, no deal in the world will make me buy them.
---
And then when you scrape it, you 1 pound worth of stuff. 
---
Perfect for that solo SBQ run
---
We did it! Maybe it will go in now!
---
Its a verse from revelation about the white horseman thats whete i got the title anyway
---
That was just yesterday. I have been on the search for many days! but yes I still felt very lucky and blessed to be sure, a feeling I shattered moments after! Lol! 
---
I would just not buy a TSE.. there's no way to tell.  People seem to think you're reasonably safe under certain circumstances but I disagree.  If I had been lucky enough to get one, i certainly wouldn't be selling it.
---
Now if i were OK with the situation and I got one cheaply or for free, or could easily replace it, I'd probably capitalize on that.  Which is why I think they're so commonly sold.  It just also means I am not expecting to not get one after another 300 hours of playing.
---
It could also mean they just didn't want that type of weapon.. but how likely is that?  I personally horde any good gun in case i want to use it some day.  Then maybe they got 2 of the exact same TSE just by chance?  How likely is that?
---
I think overall the chances it is duped are extremely high if it's for sale, and only slightly less if it's not being sold.
---
zzz
---
thanks for the info. thats insane damage potential

The datami e was pretty clear. You buy the lunchbox from the atom shop, you open thr lunchbox with a massive burst of fanfair and confetti and special animation,  and you amd your team get a special lunchbox buff, ranging from increased jump hight to bonus xp to extra damage vs Robots/scorched/ect.
---
Help in the overall market...maybe but wouldn't be much different once diapers get hands on them....gonna be exactly the same as it is today....5k for a gun more common than a pipe pistol.

Codsworth couldn't be bother to water the lawn every now and then despite only needing to contend with a few rad roaches, but these brave security bots managed to keep the lawn pristine even in the face of TWO direct nuclear strikes. Hats off to them.

I killed *one* out of a possible *three* players who were wrecking my shit...*that‚Äôs* too far fetched for you? r/nothingeverhappens 
---
Nah fam. No lawyer will take on a $200 small claim against a large corp.
---
Bethesda/Zen has a team of lawyers who's entire (highly paid) job is crushing stuff like this.
---
Class action maybe, but that also requires a ton of legwork that for many, just isnt worth it.
---
Seriously, they keep releasing these ugly ass hair designs, tattoos and clothes.  I liked the sequin dress, but that's the only thing I've gotten so far.  The rocket girl suit would be cool if it took place of the hazmat suit, too. 
---
Also, why do they have TWO different skins for small generators?   Who the fuck is using small generators?
---
Oh, I know it, lost Jetpack and calibrated shocks myself...
---
Lost four t60 mods my friend bought me when trying to craft 5.56 ammo. Worst part is it didn't even show my resources going down/the text box of what's being used to craft it just the occasional Super Duper guy popping up on the side. When I tried to use the station again, I still had well over 300 steel left but no mods.

There were supposed to be two one with bun and one without but so far you can make bread.

Yeah that lvl5 Somerset Special is still sitting in my stash in hopes they'll add the ability to upgrade it. 
---
Try to create some blueprints when you set up a nice workshop. But be careful it doesn't use more resources or it could eat into your stashed mods. Split it up into a few blueprints to make it easier to place them. I haven't done it yet but that is the next thing I'm going to do.
---
*Jazz music stops*
---
You can add death Tambo to the list. üôÅ Ektenias explanation makes sense though. Im kind of pissed about the power fist though, it's perfect for power armor, wtf? 
---
I agree that Bethesda needs to see how the glitches work so that they can fix them.. A couple times I've actually created support tickets with youtube links. However, some of the people spreading the videos online are just looking for subs.. especially when they almost always say something like "subscribe to my crappy channel for more Fallout cheats and glitches... blah blah blah"
---
I'm 40 and play when I can (including FPS) outside of work. Been playing since I was a kid in the 80s. My first computer was a C64. We've been here all along.
---
why do people primarily nuke white springs? is there like better enemies that spawn there or something?
---
Okay cool I'm just going to put my PlayStation on 
---
Jinkies! I lost a bright headlamp in the mix but I haven't risked buying the shocks, I have seen them since but won't touch them until I know how to properly install any more mods. 
---
&gt; Will pacifist mode prevent you from gaining a bounty on stray bullets to CAMPs?

Yes.

With that hat and the weirdly proportioned limbs, this thing looks an awful lot like [Mr. Poopybutthole](https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/rickandmorty/images/3/37/Mr_poopy_butthole.png/revision/latest?cb=20150819161234).
---
Rick and Morty DLC confirmed?
---
I'm not sure what you mean.  There is a perk that allows for better condition on crafted PA; but that only requires 3 INT.
---
Man I really hope so... Im gonna uninstall if the first vault is just full of corpses or generic ghouls... or worse... **nothing**.
---
Here's to hoping for a better wasteland.
---
Yeah but that jackass made the new way known. Hopefully they keep on craving the you tube attention and post the minute they learn.
---
I get vengeful mothmen at my camp just on the border of the Savage divide and cranberry bog every so often 
---
Three times I took hemlock holes and all three times got booted from the server almost immediately after. I feel your pain loosing the materials I could have put to better use else where is so frustrating. I hope they fix this soon.
---
first time i encountered him he scared the shit out of me.  i was using a workbench at my camp on the middle of the forest, at night, when these big red eyes just jump in front of my face. my heart was literally racing cuz i didnt expect to get jumped by this thing 
---
Nice we need a sub for this wasted wasteland or somthing lol
---
Added you and I see you played some Eve Valkyrie. Can't wait to see your camp.
---
Not overpriced, but forced bundles. You couldn't buy JUST the santa suit for 800, you had to buy the bundle.
---
Why would I use a shity laser rifle when my pipe pistol is obviously better?
---
I wish so hard this could be /s
---
I did. Still sucks don't you think?
---
All you need is a fresh server devoid of other players- hop until you get one. I go in there alone at level 115+ and can spawn them in the club and out on the greens to the west of the club and those guesthouses. 
---
Whatever the reset timer is for the whole place, as long as you're first in there you can spawn them at any level wearing their little outfits.
---
exactly^^^^^^
---
i built mine next to the irradiated river near flatwoods, checkmate if you dont have radaway
---
The guy who i purchased the gun has a combat tse maybe just wanted the other one, or maybe is duped, but if theres no problem with duped guns in the future i think theres no problem with tha, what do u think about it? ü§î
---
I got a daisycutter and put a mirv mod on it, only weighs 2 more than a mini nuke. I've managed to fire it once without killing myself. Makes a hell of a mess.
---
Doesn‚Äôt seem possible u would kill a 150+ with as u say three of them together they would 1 tap you
---
Also, IDK if bug or intended but if someone starts PvP with you, you can destroy their base and you won't get wanted. 
---
No. The judge (who has a limited authority outside their lil world) will order them to pay.
---
They can fight that order for years, flat out not pay, or "settle" for half as much if that.
---
Enforcing those decisions against large corps is impossible until you get into some serious cash.
---
Think of the IRS as fiscal mercenaries, they aren't interested in spending man hours if the payoff is a small fraction of a small amount.
---
Yeah THAT I could do without. ‚òπÔ∏è
---
people were doing it 10-20 minutes after the hotfix, that's how long that patch kept them at bay, seriously
---
Also in ur Original post you said ‚Äútwo 150+ players‚Äù
---
Now u say there are three?
---
Raider dolphins, with scars and guns.
---
XBox1. Shocks are for X-01 PA, I luckily found one last night, just need one more.
---
Its difficult to find a vendor that offered legendary modded armor, i have metal armor Chameleon and shadowed metal armor legs (all ultra light modded), so for me I think its easier to repair...  
---
Agreed. I just like to complain a little too, but I try and make it constructive and it seems you do the same. Being able to understand both (or many) sides to an argument is very key in successful progression. 
---
 I've gotten responses that tell me to stop bitching, but nothing will ever change with that attitude. If some people are okay with the content pricing and quality then fine, but a lot of us are not and we have the right to speak up about it. 
---
I have never played Warframe, but I can understand where you're coming from. 
---
Hope fully we can get some decently priced content in the upcoming months. I also think that we will get some free cosmetics when they add in DLC and what not. Again, just hoping. I feel like all the different raider armors from nuka world will make it in at some point. 
---
I use both auto and semi auto rifles, and I can confirm that it affects both. 
---
There would be a certain poetic justice to that considering the Fallout history. Fingers crossed on there recent announcement for the outer worlds.
---
Xbone - taking all pieces of chassis and putting back on fixed but that was not fun trying to figure it out.

What platform are you on?

(cheerfully) If you ever get it in your head to screw me oooooover, (seriously) I will gut you with this here saw and string your entrails up like christmas tinsel
---
Nothing personnnel, kid üòé
---
I agree, my crafting character is my main, and his INT and LUCK are both maxed, it'll be nice if INT gave some type of buff to energy weapons.
---
If they disconnect and their name tag disappears from the party UI, it still sort of leaves you "in a team".  That's when you might notice their name tag is still floating in the world.  If you open your social menu (ctrl+tab) and click on your name at the top, you'll see you can still Leave Team.  If you do that, or unequip strange in numbers it'll go back to normal.
---
I think it sort of updates the number of teammates to 0 when they leave instead of disbanding the team.  So all your mutation effects get multiplied by 0 =P
---
Oh shit neat! Not a fan of those color schemes but still awesome it's coming eventually!
---
&gt; The final nail in the coffin is even if the Judge says "you win", Bethesda is not going to send you a check, so good luck getting a local sheriff out to one of Bethesda offices to go find someone to arrest. There is not a judge in the free world that would place a lien on Bethesda property over 200 bucks.
---
Take 'em back to small claims court for defaulting on the payment, they'd probably get a court fine for refusing to make the payment and still have to pay you.
---
Oh I meant the first two weeks the game was out and they were being absolutely barraged by support tix.
---
If I were in their shoes I'd have done the same, clearly their CA team was too small for what turned out to be a giant shitshow
---
Thanks. I had the same issue, had tons of screws and didn't need them until I built some armor. I owe my buddy a bunch so I'm going to farm them pretty soon.
---
I don't understand, what do you mean "only"? Do you mean at Harpers Ferry? Or in general? I've found hundreds of plans and I'm only level 60. If nothing else I can show you some good places to get them.
---
The plasma gattling gun might just be the most awful and underwhelming weapon I've ever seen in a game meta, ever.
---
My game froze as i was getting into a power armour set i had just discovered, which was a big deal for me as a level 10. When i reloaded i couldnt find it again.
---
Happen to me last night and lots of legendary drops, but the RNG gods hated me so all the legendary drops were basically useless.
---
How can you tell who owns a base?
---
There needs to be a "Sorry" or "My bad" emote. The other day I was crawling around Charleston Capital Building and when I turned around, there was another player behind me and I fired my shotgun at him. Totally didn't mean to PvP and he seemed cool with it, but being able to emote "Sorry" would have been helpful.
---
You can't blame people at all because it's not their fault the engine can't handle what it.
---
Imagine being a player with an explosive build.
---
Yeah that's what I want
---
The beacon doesn't apply to you when there's collateral damage. Every other weapon does.
---
Hell, I forgot about the Atoms!  I haven't received mine either, and its been weeks.
---
I don't understand how another person's gear and or level ruined the game for people. I made it to lvl 95 the hard way and I have had nothing but fun. So there are people higher level better gear. Are new palyers mad that they cannot be that person? WhAt platform are you playing on? The PC community has been amazing, friendly, helpful.
---
Apparently moving your C.A.M.P. box around will change your spawn. Try that.
---
Saving for mine now, as I decided at the last minute to spend on my holiday power armor.
---
... It jingles as I walk, dammit! Don't judge me!
---
When I travel to my base I spawn 20m outide my buildable area just so it can drop me off a cliff.
---
Yes to fast travel mats. Literally no reason not to.
---
Can you "repair" a dead deathclaw pet or would I have to find another?  Just curious.  Got the perks recently
---
OP acknowledges in the original post. Did you just read the title, then comment?
---
I mean, at the harpers ferry building
---
No, not always.
---
Well I mean you have to make your own decision.. its entirely up to you.  I don't even seek out TSE weapons through trading personally but that's just me.  I like to go find legendaries and kill them.. 
---
I just think at the moment there's not a whole lot else to do than farm for good gear.  If i just buy the ultimate weapon, it'll be a lot less fun for me.
---
I'm on PC. Thanks for any help you may offer!
---
Do recall where you found the plan? 
---
I know what you mean, and this is probably not it, but have you heard of https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76FilthyCasuals/ ? Memes allowed, and as the name suggests, it's a little more casual :)
---
I've tried that several times, no luck for me unfortunately. There's this one spot the game kept spawning me in, and it's only stopped due to me placing a flooring to block it.
---
Sweet thanks 
---
I hum to myself a lot.
---
I can't sing.
---
Doesn't stop me.
---
All the Hot Rod paints from FO4- flames, pink &amp; shark are in the data files for 76 according to the lists i've seen from the dataminers. Probably be in the atom store or future loot from DLC probably.
---
This should be the top voted comment on this thread!
---
Old news. Move along 
---
I've put about 75 hours into this game on PS4 and haven't encountered a single OP weapon as far as I know. The only players trying to PVP me have been hitting me with sledgehammers and the like. Strange how people's in-game experiences differ so much.
---
I've seen this I personally find it hilarious I have an explosive Tesla I put the charging shot gun barrel on my friends and I make transformer jokes. But I can see how it could break the experience.
---
Yep i understand your point
---
Is it a seperate model for the one that appears to give you a buff after the "lighting the fire" (or whatever) event?
---
Are you okay? You seem stressed. I‚Äôm here if you need to talk 
---
The higher your intelligence the higher durability for all the stuff you craft.
---
I find it weird (but it also makes sense obviously) that they changed it. There's a video one Youtube where somebody DID nuke the forest south of Vault 76, implying there wasn't a protected zone for areas that aren't Vault 76. But now you can't nuke those areas due to all of the beginner locations being protected
---
Read the OP. Three players, two 150+ one low level. He said he killed one of the three players
---
Aw Nuts! If you were on ps4 I have a jetpack with your name on it!
---
Yeah, leave it to old Bethesda to do something like `effect * 125% * 0`, right? :P
---
Off the top of my head it was just over 1000 but that was without rifleman perks on as I had my commando ones slotted in at the time, I‚Äôve only got lvl 1 of each rifleman, expert rifleman, and master rifleman but 30% extra damage on that base stat is still going to be handy. I‚Äôve got the mutation adrenal reaction but I think I was at full health at the station when I checked, sry I can‚Äôt be preside but I‚Äôl not be logging in again until late on tonight, I‚Äôm planning to see if I can 1 shot that hermit crab in the mire that patrols the road lol üòÇ 
---
Lots of legendary spawns there, way more than anywhere else. Once it's nuked they are all pretty high level. 
---
*facepalm* can u hand me my L
---
Maybe vendors as they sell plans to craft armor? I purchased some plans at vendors to craft special metal armor (body parts and chest)...
---
**PLEASE ADD RIOT GEAR**
---
Same. I'm super curious now what it was like closer to when the bombs fell (76 time vs 3 time). 
---
Part of me feels like it wouldn't be stupidly tough to just polish up all their old assets from 3 for the 4 level of graphics?
---
Yes! To add: I think the power connector, attached to the side of your building, has a certain "lighting radius." Imagine an invisible sphere with the power connector as its center. Anything touching that sphere will light up and be powered. You can make power farther from the generator by building more connectors, which create more of these powered areas. 
---
Think about what you're saying. You have a lot of ammo. So if you sold it, that would reduce the value of caps. If you scrapped it, that would reduce the value of materials. Think about how boring this game would be if everything was plentiful. There needs to be resource scarcity. 
---
That would be nice. I let her play FO4 a few times and she always wanted the pink stuff. Shes 10 now. That love for pink hasn‚Äôt really died. 
---
I know lol, but that might take a bit of a grind meaning hours and hours of server hopping if I'm not lucky
---
There is one on the bridge/highway just north of Thunder Mountain ... it has been there the dozen or so times I've rolled down to Harper's Ferry from up North.
---
All while pushing a conservative agenda. You just don't see it because your indoctrination conditions you to think it's normal. It isn't.
---
Gonna be honest, mate, if they don't have radaway literally falling out of their pockets, maybe they shouldn't be hunting bounties.
---
Bard? You mean lust compelled sexual deviant?
---
Couldn't revive it or add more meat so it was pretty dead. 
---
I'm gonna make a new thread about this and maybe Bethesda will see it. üòçüòçüòç
---
Nice I will keep that in mind for the tse a hole that decides to shoot up my camp just to try and start pvp to try and collect caps off me.  Had 2 high lvl the other day when I got the warning base under attack got there to see it destroyed and the 2 guys with tse trying to kill me on pacifist mode. 
---
Use them in pre-war vending machines... There should still be some Twinkies around, right?
---
Double nukes turning the Whitesprings into the Ultra-Fluxe. 
---
Tnx dude didnt know this one. 
---
Bigger stash is definitely my #1 request.  Loving the game right now except for that.
---
If they're having problems with database recall times / lag, they can always do this:
---
All Junk, Ammo, and Aid (without condition bars) is unlimited. It doesn't take any more time for a database to recall 10 steel as it does 1,000 steel. It's a line item name and a numerical value.
---
Since there are so many variants and conditions of armor and weapons and food items (literally millions if you take all the variables in), make that a FIXED number of slots in your stash (as many as they can get in there without lag).  So you could store 100 armor or weapons or food items.
---
If it's a database retrieval problem, that would fix it :)
---
As a potential trade/investment.  The scrapping of mods is again, an epic fail.  Beer bottles, military grade circuit boards, and baseballs have to be manually scrapped.  But a prototype jetpack, nah.  Scrap it.
---
Just thinkin the other day during a whitesprings nuke drop i wish i could use the phone pipboy so i could tap to use radaway, stimpaks and water.. 
---
Instead of stopping, checkin saftey, open up pipboy, scroll through tabs and down items to get to what i want to use..
---
Id be amazingly happy if they implemented this.
---
I was wondering this regarding player vending. Except for the few constant farming locations, I hardly ever see anyone.
---
Yah, I don‚Äôt why we still have that thread, Mods are lazy I guess. New updates need to be sticked and any Bethesda post too.
---
The alien blaster isnt really near the space station.  It is near the butterfly on the map, just south of the station.  I was sorely disappointed in the space station.  One of the coolest map locations, and no quest or interesting loot to be found there.
---
More like the answer above yours. Doesnt apply to orbital strike. It will definetly apply if you shoot and hit the base / objects with a regular weapon. It's happened to me too many times. 
---
I think once i get a chance to nuke someplace ill nuke somewhere unusual. Sure theyre may not be many mobs and perhaps no one will come.. But ill have fun.
---
Apparently bethesda has no issues with this
---
Yeah I managed to get into there a few months back my marsupial jumping up to the window and the clicking the president's chair through the glass. When I posted about it, some folks had some interesting theories on the subject, specifically around the Presidential Seals that are needed to purchase that presidential gear. 
---
One theory someone suggested is that to get a seal you'll need to be elected as the president using the automated voter systems around the map. In my travels I have so far found three Active Vote Ballots in filing cabinets and such(Theres a respawning one in Harpers Ferry on the top floor of an office building, tucked inside of an open filing cabinet. Easy to mistake for a plane folder since it's world item looks similar). This could mean either rigging the election your self, or some kind of event in which people on the server have to vote for you.
---
My personal theory on how to get the seals is that each one is a reward for a raid dungeon. When the vaults open up, we might have to fight our way through the whole vault to reach the overseers quarters, and snag the presidential seal from there. 
---
There were a few others, but it's all speculation at this point. If anyone else has ideas on how it might go down I'd love to hear them.
---
that's further evidence that there's a glitch in The Matrix and we're all in VR pods on October 23rd.
---
I cant sing worth shit. I sound like a dying moose. That doesn‚Äôt stop me from screaming country roads every time it comes on. Keep your mic on and keep singing my guy.
---
I crash at least once, every time I enter a nuke zone, queen or not. It is a certainty that I will crash.
---
So much for the "end game" when I have a 100% crash rate while trying to participate in it.
---
Just found a new spawn location for this bot. West of Lady Janet's Soft Serve on the road, shortly past the tipped over bus, and next to the 25 mph speed limit sign. As far as I can tell it was just a straight run from the ice cream shop to the sign and he spawned for me.
---
" **You can attack a wanted player's base without consequences** " -- Incorrect, only by using Orbital Strike. Anything else, you'll go Wanted yourself. 
---
You are a hero.    
---
Thanks from everyone who can't thank you personally.
---
When they're traded default names reset, and other players wouldn't see the names you gave your stuff
---
It's a QOL mod with 388 unique downloads and no comments about bans.
---
Sure I'll get downvoted for this, but to answer your question; a lot of people think all mods are a form of cheating. Some would be considered cheating in a multiplayer environment, this one is not.
---
The reality is BGS has depended on modders to fix their buggy games for years. They've also profited handsomely from the modding community.
---
Vaults other than your own are always full of corpses and whatever caused those corpses to be. Should be expected. I'm thinking there are hidden bunkers we don't know about with survivors still living and breathing waiting for the end of the scorched or death. 
---
Hahaha
---
The issue for me is that, out of every song that's been in a Fallout game, *Wouldn't It Be Nice* is the one that breaks the theme most of all by a long shot. Every time it comes on the radio it just kinda pulls me out of the retrofuturism that the game is going for. 
---
I *love* the song, the whole Pet Sounds album is one of my faves, and the first record I bought when I got a turntable recently. It just doesn't fit the game well.
---
Now that said, I think asking for it to be removed is a hell of a long shot. They probably paid a hefty price for licensing on it and they're going to get their money's worth. And since the radio is server-based, an option to put it on some kind of do-not-play list is an even longer shot. And I also don't think it fits in this QoL list because it isn't QoL, it's simply preference. 
---
This. Anything that reduces AP ussage will also cause you to use less core charge.
---
two-shot is a legendary effect that's tier 3, while explosive is a legendary effect tier 2 i think so they're saying if they were both tier 3, you couldn't have both on the gun at the same time.  It would be either two-shot or explosive, but not both.
---
Your double barrel shotgun doesn't seem to be two-shot.  
---
Are you saying it's also overpowered?
---
&gt; you guys will complain about absolutely everything
---
great discussion you're having then.
---
Did you feel like you helped improve the game?
---
Ahh the submerged train yard is a good spot for it too
---
I haven‚Äôt gotten charging, I‚Äôm not exactly looking either. I do have the reflex sight though. I‚Äôll have to make some up and see what kind of success I have. If I unlock anything I‚Äôll post back here
---
\^\^This.  Also, Line in the Sand/ASAM site events.
---
That is a mighty generous offer, I appreciate it all the same!!
---
Happened to me also. And seems to be every time I capture and try to build in my 3rd workshop. Could be coincidence... 
---
I lock everything to the max. I don't want some Goldilocks wandering in to sleep in my bed. Screw them, and the bloodbug they rode in on.
---
(I don't lock my hand water pump. I've never tried. I think that would be a dick move.)
---
Why not just work through them 1/2 at a time?
---
The only Mothman I've encountered was a Vengeful Mothman. I was level 72 and the bastard was wreaking havoc on my PA'd ass. Scared the shit out of me too. (I was apologizing the entire fight and telling it how I was a huge fan and I had it's sleeping bag n everything.)
---
Not a mistake. Not at all... Especially if you're looking for that sweet sweet raw flux. My friends and I nuked Harpers Ferry and found a shit ton of violet flux there. We nuked Charleston and found some (not a lot, but some) raw cobalt flux.
---
Really depends on what you're looking for, but I don't blame you for nuking Rose. I built my base close to her so that I can keep an eye on that sketchy bot... I don't trust her.
---
Ooh you got my interest. Whats deep shrouded do?
---
okay. i‚Äôm new and basically all of the posts i‚Äôve seen about nukes are directed at white springs, and then every time a place has been nuked in game it was whitesprings. 
---
I think its because of my level
---
Finding Garrahan in game would be amazing, what a cool thought
---
I don't think ranged needs the sort of bonus effects that STR gives because of the advantages/disadvantages of the two fighting styles. These are sufficiently different and both viable. Both do more than enough damage using the right weapons, perks and legendaries.
---
The issue is that energy weapons just completely suck, and they need to be buffed somehow to bring them in line with the ballistic weapons. The plasma gatttling gun is the absolute worst offender. It's worse than a pool cue.
---
Hey so I noticed you are a non PA player as well.  
---
Were you able to handle the nuked zone/ enemies without it?
---
Within 30 minutes of writing this I got a reply from support to say my request has been approved and i'll get a bag in 4-6 months.
---
Good idea, also making them not benefit from Demolitions expert would help too. But I don't dislike the weapons power, it just sucks that everybody and his brother can get them so easily. Maybe if they made other weapons like tesla do something cool, like be more effective against robots/disable them sort of like the LAER mod for Fallout 4, that might make it more fun.
---
Passive mode prevents you from triggering pvp.  If your're in a situation where they would do slap damage to you they wouldn't be able to kill you (generally speaking).
---
There's areas that enable pvp like if you're in a workshop you have claimed.  Those are contested.  You'll take full damage until you leave the area.
---
I don't know why this fact bothers me so much but it does.
---
Kind of a let down to see it after the path to enlightenment like... Thats it?
---
Fuck that! Those prize bots who hand out vouchers for cars need to get a good whoopin'
---
If your ever on ps4 ill hook you up!
---
Same. It was great having for fallout 4 (so you could have a map up while you're walking, etc). It's almost a necessity for fallout 76 because of everything happening in realtime.
---
You could trade with a user who has it to paint your armor for you.
---
As well when friends or teammates fast travel to your camp, and your camp was originally where your house is now so they spawn in the floor.
---
In addition to what the other guy said, there‚Äôs a ton of plants there that can be harvested for flux. You need flux to craft end game stuff, and it‚Äôs only obtainable from nuke zones. Different kinds of plants drop different flux, whitesprings has a good supply of all o them 
---
Also depends on the type of armor.  I had ultra light on the urban scout armor and got a better net gain from deep pocketed for it w/o sturdy frame
---
Would you be interested in joining our Discord? We're just a small group of people that play togethr whenever any of us are online. If you want the link, just pm me and I'd be glad to get in touch with you.
---
Hope the Dev's do something about the TSE guns its seriously affecting the game in a negative way for me and my friends already had 3 out of 6 friends leave because of TSE shottys I really like pvp but they ruin it for everyone even themselves 
---
Yeah, alot of prebuilt playlists are on there.
---
Holy fuck That radium rifle
---
or just boost their raw dmg and fix the way DR is calculated. And fix durability.
---
Except... That is (one of) the cause(s) of server instability?
---
I semi working trick if you've gathered enough atoms from achievements, buy a atom shop paint job and apply it to at least one piece of the X-01 (IIRC the Ultracite can't take paint jobs) then most of the time the armor with the paint job applied will have the Atom symbol next to it when packed in your inventory.
---
It's not 100% but it's something. I put a piece of the critmiss armor in with the Nuka-Cola paint and it's barely noticeable.
---
If you're at a workshop you have claimed or are taking from someone, it's full damage.  If you pick up the mask at the watoga highschool event, etc.. there's pvp in the game where there is no slap damage.
---
This hair style should be.... \*throws dart\* .... 800 atoms.
---
Ye I understand the problem with limited stuff. I don't mind limited/seasonal items, I bought the Northern Lights skin, which added lights and new silly audio to the power armour but that's kinda been it. 
---
Looks like u found fallout new vegas
---
Just to clarify also, we're PC players... lol
---
&gt; Magic the Gathering
---
Financially speaking, it may or may not be a good idea indeed
---
I really feel like telling how to dupe nowüòÇ 
---
I got the Handmade rifle as a Christmas present from Patrol Duty, first time doing it and I'm lvl 47
---
It wouldn't be too hard to believe. In fallout four there were propaganda posters featuring giant commie robots like [this one](https://myhotposters.com/products/military-propaganda-fallout-4-poster-101369)
---
energy weapons are flat out broken.
---
On one I have that checked off so flatwood monster counts (because I know I never saw a Zetan).
---
That too lol
---
rule 10
---
Yeah support is swamped right now from the game and most likely trolls reporting their game is broken and unplayable 
---
You have to play a song on the Electric guitar and then break that guitar on the floor before raiding.
---
It's the only way to be sure of heavy metal loot. 
---
I doubt it but either way add me and I'll help out plus I don't charge caps for helping 
---
I blame butcher Pete.  Dude is always hacking , whacking and stacking.  
---
Unique hazmat suit though (space suit).
---
Hmm okay.  I heard if you change servers right after it dies then it will be alive again.  Would be nice if you could just revive it with a resource cost though.
---
I've got a lazer gun that shoots out 8 shots per round and the has the gamma mod. Shreds through enemies but unfortunately dies when I empty out a clip or 2. They're so fragile it hurts.. 
---
I need to do the Poseidon event a third time. I hate the smoke that comes off the basic generators and the windmill makes too scary a sound for me to have at my camp.
---
Really want that fusion generator. Having it in it's own building is a good idea.
---
er... isn't this against rule 3?
---
*jazz music stops*
---
Use it to ur advantage! When player vendors come out, u could build a bar and have a live band! Lol
---
Haha yeah , when i got the weapon i tried to shoot a wendingo in a tent with it. It didnt end well... for me! The Wendigo didnt get a scratch 
---
Like the Blackbird, but without the red highlights? Okay, now I just want it more. :P
---
Can you post pictures? Since Bethesda didn‚Äôt...
---
So do I need to make a big Reddit post to get my ticket answered?  Been 4 weeks since I've submitted it with 0 reply from support at all.  Not even a "hey, we got your ticket and are looking into it." 
---
Just radio silence.
---
It's a special mod you get from following the storyline. It lowers the weight to 0.34 a piece, increases sneak in dark areas, increases sneak speed. Even on arm and body pieces. (I don't know how it stacks though)
---
I'm hoping with the new patch coming this stuff maybe addressed and stopped with the weird pricing and get settled. Idk anymore. Like 76 is kinda my favourite fallout game because I just get so into it when I play and seeing other people is soo nice but... I'm just worried its gonna go to far down hill
---
I was with a group doing the SBQ.  After she died, I was checking my inventory to see what I'd got, and when I came out of the menu my equipped rifle just disappeared from my hands along with all the ammo for it.  I was baffled, and spent a few minutes looking around on the ground in case I dropped it.  But alas, it was gone.  Luckily it wasn't anything I was terribly attached to, but I was annoyed I lost 400+ rounds of .308.
---
Have done the 5k reward 3 times now, was always a random 1 star legendary all weapons so far. Sometimes a bunch of crap like ammo on top of it.
---
For my SPECIAL points, and this is just my 2 caps, I see more return with just getting the Perk Weapon Artisian/Fix It Good.  This gives 200% durability.  And only requires 3 INT.  I went with 6 INT so I can run First Aid/Power User or Power Patcher.  Though INT does give higher XP returns--but I haven't done the math to find the sweet spot on that yet.
---
You reply with bad argumentation as if declaration without providing substantive reasoning is good enough. Are you this lazy in bed with the girlfriend you pretend to have?
---
only the tesla rifle is a viable energy weapon
---
That works well but not everyone has someone they can trust to hold stuff for them.
---
Having a Pip-Boy app for FO76 would be a good reason to have two monitors :)
---
Although it was just 3 friends, but it's still a startling moment haha. 
---
You‚Äôve got a good point about clean hair etc, in FO4 there was a barber‚Äôs/hairdressers chair you could change your appearance at, and fallout shelter has a barbers chair for different hair etc, so if post apocalyptic hairdressing is a thing it‚Äôs only logical that the said post apocalyptic hairdresser would wash your hair in one of those working sinks or a stream to wash out that pink hair dye or bleach from going blonde so yes let‚Äôs have some new clean hair styles in the atom shop üëç
---
As others have said, it's under Resources and looks like a wheelbarrow and a pile of manure. If you're short of razorgrain to build it, there's plenty growing in the field south of the Silva Homestead. But be warned, it's pretty fragile and enemies often make a bee-line for it. When I built my most recent camp a scorched was trying to take a fire-axe to my Brahmin within the first minute I'd made it. They're also noisy, and unless you fence them it they wander about the place.
---
Oh lord, luckily I didn't lose my 1000 ultracite shells, but now I have no prime shotgun to shoot them from :(
---
It should and so should food but only one food effect (just like how you can‚Äôt have two chem effects at the same time)
---
A guess would be some kind of shipping refund, or a price adjustment?
---
I found a two shot tesla and two shot cryolator that are actually pretty decent with mods and stuff. I think I even added a charging shotgun mod on the Tesla and it makes it pretty useful, not as useful as executioner rifles or ballistic, but better.
---
Oh ye I agree totally I'd love that so much. 3D inspection in store would be awesome. And so far Northern Lights Power Armour skin and the tuxedo bundle has been my favourite 'priced' items. I don't care about buying the tudexos but I did grab the PA and loving it, it did way more than just give a wash of paint compared to the other pa paints and was 800 cheaper.
---
I don't understand the pricing. 
---
Yeah, same boat as /u/CodyRCantrell here.  Submitted my ticket 4 weeks ago and has yet to receive a reply.  Not even a "Hey, we got your ticket and are looking into it."
---
Nothing at all from them.  Seems good.
---
Want me to pm you a picture of it?
---
MAX!!!! THAT IS NOT A CHEWTOY!!!
---
$8 for a hairstyle... what the fuck, Bethesda?
---
Luckily I got it the first run at the plant. Built my buddy one as well. Just don't make the same mistake I did and put a door with a window to it.. Scorch/super mutants will kill it through the small opening. 
---
It's a fantastic spot to get legendary weapons. You can also earn a lot of exp by killing all the ghouls. I will hop on to a server, make a lap killing and looting all the ghouls, then go off to do something else. If you have trouble with a certain enemy, you can aggro it and kite it into all the security robots there. It's not as fast, but you can still get good exp that way. If you're over-encumbered you can duck into white springs and go to the shop that has all the crafting benches. 
---
I thought this, but i'm not sure now. We tried sending in a low level first and it seemed easier, still not 100% tho. Unless its how many people are in the area at the time of aggro'ing the Queen to give it its health bar, not sure pal
---
It would remove random amount of perk cards, to the stat effects coming off, also I‚Äôve never met someone using a plaguewalker or junkie build
---
I have this! I will assist!
---
That one is neutral if you don't try to fill it full of lead. it's part of the event there. Still had me going "oh noes" as I'd strayed off course, and had been attacked by an aggro one in the ash heap. 
---
At least you got a reply about the bag.  I submitted mine 4 weeks ago and have gotten no reply yet.  At this point I'm expecting them to answer it after the submission deadline and say that I was too late in submitting a ticket.
---
Wow, thanks for the heads up, that's amazing!
---
I've tried the pond up in the mountain to no end for nothing. Then tried the one under a train bridge,really close to treetops and big b rest stop. But never even seen a mirelurk there in the events.
---
Mine isn't two shot, wish it was. And yes it is overpowered
---
I play with my kid, he calls me Dad instead of Dab.... everyone thinks hes just saying it wrong. 
---
I had one attack me at my camp and was able to kill it with with the help of my turrets, it had a bunch of ballistic fiber on it, i forget what else.
---
Nuke Mines!
---
I had to do the same.  Checked my tickets and was like "Uhh, nothing?  Wut?"  And sure enough it was just so old with no update that it was moved out of that list. 
---
I love the single action revolver more than any gun in this game. I love my hunting rifle+fixed bayonet and single action character but I‚Äôm sad it won‚Äôt be viable at higher levels. 
---
Single action is incredibly satisfying though. 
---
I have a two star 10 mm with 2 shot and 25% faster fire rate. Is yours only a 1 star? Honestly would prefer caps, I've already got more than a few 1 star 2 shot legendaries
---
INT gives better base durability to all crafted items... Artisan/fix it good give a % boost depending on base durability.
---
Personaly I have 15 points in INT so i can have the cards that makes weapons last longer + demolition expert.
---
The number of people at the pull makes a ton of sense, actually. Who knows. That could explain why that guy wanted OP out of the zone if he thought it would make the fight harder.
---
It wouldn‚Äôt be visible to the other player if it was like regular atomic painted items, unless power armour worked differently 
---
im running a 3 luck build.   its fine.  
---
just dont get those sweet %200 quality weapons.  
---
You disrespecting my small genny? Actually not gonna lie, my first camp had 2 medium and by Lv23 I had a fusion Geny lol.
---
My favourite thing so far is the Northern Lights Power Armour. I like the dress I just don't see myself using it, I picked up the pink summer hat (wish I could change its colour to black) but I liked that a lot too for 300 atoms
---
in game haircut lasts FOREVER
---
There needs to be a fix for HDR displays.  I play on a PC connected to an LG OLED, and it is way too dark. I know some people like this, and mod for "realistic nights" but I literally can't see anything at night unless I'm using my pipboy light. 
---
Just make it the same as fo4, had no problems with the default settings in that game.
---
&gt; A group of use killed her in like 3-4 mins last night 
---
I don't know whose gun it was, but someone was lighting her up like crazy as she flew.  It sounded sort of like a minigun, but I wasn't looking at the players.  I could just see her under fire and her health bar going down quick.  
---
&gt;  One thing I find odd is that ALL humans outside of vaults have perished in WV. I mean, clearly, they survived for some time after the bombs dropped and some even thrived for a short time. It's odd that so many would be so recently deceased and there would be nothing standing.
---
Uh, the explanation for that *is* the story.  It's up to you to find out the how and why.
---
it is my favorite sword, I only wish I would have completed that quest at level 50 and not 25.  
---
I put my name on mine!
---
&gt; Maybe make INT increase energy weapon damage like STR does melee? Currently high INT is not very useful most of the time. Maybe even make energy weapons scale by weapon condition to counterbalance it.
---
Just give the Science perks energy weapon buffs in addition to what they do (that way we have reason to use them outside of crafting). Science could increase durability (like plumber does for pipe weapons). Science Expert can increase ammo efficiency. Science Master can buff damage.
---
Hunters long coat
---
I've got a friend that went to the effort of getting a set; he uses it because he wants something when he's running around, as he says, 'naked', but spends most of his time in Power Armor, and it's very very light sitting in inventory.
---
I froze 3 times always when messing with my stash and legendary weapons (known error I think) and got kicked twice. I rarely claim workshops since I get kicked several times everytime I play usually once every hour or two.
---
I took cannibal at 15 and 16  after that was lead belly i never looked back
---
Yeah unyielding shouldn‚Äôt only cap at +3 to each
---
Also the max for each stat is 15
---
You'll save a ton of caps with as little as 3 points in luck. I'd actually recommend 3 points in all stats just for support stuff. Locks, computers, share a perk, weight reduction and free money/repairs... you can get that from each of the special stats
---
Except that it doesn't block radiation... so, useless hazmat suit.  It just blocks disease.
---
Yeah "5 stars" "raise weapon lvl" get bringed a lot as the problem solver but in the end you'll one shot anyone with a 2* lvl 30 explosive shotgun.
---
Won't fix duped colas/plans/mods/junks either.
---
Why? Everyone has a right to voice their reasons to why they're quitting the game. If nobody complained, Bethesda wouldn't know what to prioritize in terms of making the game better.
---
I have a habit of opening mythics and I usually go at least 2-1 at FNM, so financially it is probably fine, but it is a time commitment, although I assume no more than someone who watches TV. 
---
This happened to me too because I went down/died the same second as I got the level.
---
Gonna have to push through another character 
---
That's what I was thinking. Each Science perk does something different. Science can make them break slower. Science expert can give them like ammo efficiency (like they get 2 shots for every energy cell). Science Master can increase damage of energy weapons.
---
I had a vampiric ripper i trashed bunch of levels ago... ugh should have held on to it in hopes they fix it one day..
---
+1 strength, +2 endurance, +2 intelligence and +2 luck is a benefit like you wouldn‚Äôt believe, I would delete this comment altogether because under armor is nothing but beneficial. 
---
in addition to rain coming through tents, it should also get fixed for the upper levels of Hornwright and Garrahan Estates
---
Wait, how do you put items down not in a paper bag like spices, salt, cups, etc.?! Is there really a plan for that or am I an idiot?
---
Take over Public Workshops and defend them at least once. You'll get plans each time. They might not be great plans ('Dirty ashtray' anyone), but you'll get them. The best building plans I have (eg brick walls) I bought from station vendors. Always check what's in stock when you visit and don't put off buying them, you never know how long they'll take to reappear.
---
That's nice. Yeah you could camp inside wendigo cave,at the entrance and kill your pursuer,then wait till you're tha last one. Max coward yeah.
---
I want my TWO CAPS!
---
Worse when it's something you can't recreate easily^1 
---
^1 for insane amounts of mats values of "easily".
---
&gt; In all the older fallout games energy weapons were considered "end game" and did alot of damage and were fun to use.
---
Yeah, remember Fallout 2. The huge fucking deal the mobster were making about "light bringer" weapons and how the Bishops were too dangerous because they were the only ones with lasers?
---
Yeah, I hate power armor and I still almost bought the Northern Lights set just in case I decide to roll with PA eventually.  
---
I'd definitely pay some atoms for a necklace or a nice jacket. 
---
I've noticed I'm older then most I played with. They call smart and intelligent. Thanks for that fallout...
---
yah, i was there when i was like level 16 and i leveled up a couple times and got a couple of legendary items. i was only there for like 10 minutes. but i was too low of a level to actually be able to kill the enemies, so i had to rely on others :P 
---
If you want mutations, you'll want 5 luck for Starched Genes and Class Freak.
---
BTW Mutations are super fun and helpful.  I'd recommend 5 luck.
---
That also describes me, yes. 
---
Im gonna make a Heavy Gunner since everyone is like Screw the all that weight....half way to level 20 but once i hit that i have 2k in weapons sitting on a mule for the rest of the levels. 
---
I had to get a repalcement for mine as well for the same issue with nothing working. The only odd part I see is, when I contacted their support, I needed to also provide a picture of the helmet with a post-it with my name and e-mail attached to the helmet along with everything else to prove I had one, etc etc. I am surprised they do not want the picture anymore. I did,however, get the replacement about 3-4 weeks after I requested it however, so hopefully you get yours soon.
---
A mothman decided to roll me outside whitesprings. I kited him into the gates. 
---
It was glorious. The lasers. The shots fired. The sentinels pumping endless rounds into him. 
---
I was tucked into a toll gate house. Taking pot shots till it died. Didnt get much of anything. But a good time..
---
And then i shot at a scorchbeast. I should not have done that... It did not go well...
---
Do you have blueprints stored as well? Might need to break them down...there was a pretty serious bug (which might still be there) where when camps got blueprinted, the blueprints duped. Took up space, didn't actually dupe mats. So make sure both Stored and Blueprints are empty.  
---
With the patch that checks to see if your camp site is taken, things have become much better in terms of being able to truly "build a permanent home".
---
or you know. swap in aquaboy
---
I finally saw him last night, once I started searching for him, in the forest halfway between vault 76 and the mothman museum. I was level 24 and he was 35. As I approached he suddenly flew upwards and disappeared.
---
Are you reporting the threads?
---
So just remove bags entirely until it can be 100% fixed - dropped items go into the never never void instead.  Its not a true fix, but removes the ability to dupe.
---
I wonder if it applies to artillery from your base?
---
Each server can handle 32 people 24 + 8 friends, so potentially servers can have 32.
---
Wut lolololol
---
Oh, nice. The original companion app is pretty cool, but it was never updated with DLC stuff, at least not on Android. Glad that somebody is using the API for something useful.
---
True
---
Lol but if the new weapon one shots....the old weapons one shot....still no balance. Everyone still has god tier weapons. One fix would be an energy effect or something introduced while needing the explosive effect.
---
Oh really? I just put it in my stash without really looking at it.
---
Move your camp device around the camp, then test it with a fast travel.  It's not an exact science, but you can change your fast travel point.
---
As a melee main, i drop ammo like santa on people cause im always like... wtf is weighing me down... oh its this 3k in 45 rounds...
---
&gt; Informing people
---
Funny how YouTubers like RGT85 and Spawn Wave manage to do just that without injection their political biases and endless buzzwords.
---
&gt; Being upset for the sake of it
---
90% of good videos are some form of conservative pearl clutching outrage about something some blue hair said about him on Twitter or similar tribalistic nonsense.
---
&gt; I'm pretty open to political ideas
---
Yet here you are, white knighting (badly) for someone who isn't.
---
&gt; I haven't watched him for a super long time
---
It shows.
---
Wait mothman jumpscares? Shid I gotta find one even though I am only a level 30 xmas noob.
---
Add your platform to the title
---
Yes that‚Äôs so true. I‚Äôll stick with 5 luck. 
---
I wanted to date a wendigo once
---
Why would they?
---
Bethesda should cater to some noob who goes to a popular area, doesn't look where he's shooting and ends up getting a wanted level through nobody's fault but his own, then proceeds to throw a hissy fit and destroy the player's base he shot? 
---
I'd like to say in advance this is a crap answer... it depends on the legendary gun. TSE does not require luck and I'm guessing some others don't either. I'm a stealth/VATS/crit build and a handmade or gauss does fine in sneak without VATS but if I'm getting DANGER, I go to VATS. 
---
That said, I borrowed someones TSE yesterday and even though it's not max level I still plowed through everything. I accidentally 2-shot a level 91 'scary name' deathclaw from the hip that I was trying to let someone else hit for the xp/loot.
---
Here's the quest you need for the Fire Breathers hat. It's part of the main questline.  
---
[https://fallout76.wiki.fextralife.com/Into+the+Fire](https://fallout76.wiki.fextralife.com/Into+the+Fire)
---
Is the plan for that at that fear store?
---
I suppose I could not use the TSE, but then dmg plummets so hard :(
---
Finding a bloody/twsho+50Crit dmg is hard.
---
Oh man, I wish I had that kind of time. 34 y/o dude here, work full time, if I'm lucky I'll get to average an hour or two a night, a little more on weekends. Took a few days off in November and December just to play, so I have over 100 hours, but damn.
---
lvl310, Do whatever makes you happy homie. Some don't waste too many materials with max locks, just the lvl 0 will be enough to get the point across. If someone wants in, they'll get in 
---
&gt;Nobody sets foot in my camp unless I let them in
---
Yea sure, we have have two shot explosives, nuke mines, mini nukes, orbital strikes... big boi nukes, c'mon old sport you're only fooling yourself.
---
Being considerate would be have a workbench, stash, bed, instrument, and maybe a waterpurifier accessible.  
---
As for resource extractors, it's up to you if you want to inclose the entire thing, lock it, or leave it open. It usually gets full so fast you will hardly notice if some one takes a batch.
---
If you have a brahmen pen, keep it inclosed/indoors to prevent other players from trying to kill the cow for meat, decontamination showers should be hidden since its a hassle to fix if you don't keep flux on you.
---
Please explain. ü§î
---
No this lets you take purified water and make it into boiled water for cooking.
---
11. A way to know what plans have been learned already. It could be as simple as adding an asterisk next to learned plans. 
---
12. Bump the stash box weight limit to 800 or 1000. 
---
13. When using a hazmat suit and taking it off, your armor goes back on like when exiting PA. 
---
14. Removing the level cap to purchase the hand made rifle. 
---
Passive mode should completely stop ANY damage against self and household from players.  Basically apply the team logic that the game does in that scenario against all players.  
---
Thats alright, I'm nearing my mid 30s and have played with what seems like pre-teens. 
---
Is what it is. #gaminglife
---
I find it absolutely fucking hilarious that pistol are the only gun with no armor pen perk, so they thought to give you an armor pen unique pistol, but they made it the first god damn weapon drop in the main quest line.
---
Like, you can progress THREE quests into the main quest before having to level to 45 if you want a useable Somerset.
---
Lol.
---
Yeah, I'd like the other raider stuff back, they added the Trapper set, but not the helmets to match lol. I wanted the silly Lobster cage one again haha, I loved that one.
---
When it comes to pricing I've liked the Northern Lights PA skin, Pink sunhat (wish it was black or pale blue), the tuxedo bundle and sparkly dress, I've only bought the Lights armour and Sun hat out them 4 but the prices I liked. I thought of getting the dress but was like. I'll never use it so didn't bother.
---
I'm happy to pay a bit more than normal pricing for cosmetics as I can earn them but still. A lot of these items are not worth their price at their quality. I'm hoping before they release any cool Mothman stuff or nice hairs and stuff they'll sorted pricing out and found a nice spot to stay at. It bugs me they keep jumping between prices lol.
---
And I hope they add free cosmetics with dlc updates... Cause they have added some Fallout 4 assets into the store and that worries me
---
There is a tip card for the gamma gun states something along the lines of "*blah blah does radiation damage, as such is effective against humanoid targets...*" I read that as "..use this for pvp.." since the only humanoid targets are other players. 
---
Damn I dont meet anyone, most ppl I encounter don't even have a mic
---
That's what I went with, love it.
---
It's a cause, not the cause. A bunch of players being in one place, say a nuke zone, is another cause of server instability. The "duper boogeymen" distracts from the real problem. Server stability is not a player problem, it's a server problem. Players are not going to fix it, only bethesda can fix it.
---
I followed the main quest and did other quests as I came across them, mixed in with some general exploring.
---
There's no hurry. But get to Harpers Ferry and buy the plans for the Handmade rifle when you hit Level 15. For some reason he stops selling it at Level 19. (Better check those levels, but they're about right.
---
I had a permanent base there...I loved the cry baby messages lol
---
Even if not ridable allowing tamed creatures to be 'companions' with varying benefits/uses would be nice, like, brahmin could be the 'basic' trader animal, being slow but having a HUGE cary capacity, and then Hermit Crabs being like the 'end game' trader animal being able to cary enough stuff to stock Crazy Mirna for a full quarter.
---
Energy weapons already benefit from their respective perks (heavy wps, rifleman, commando, gunsmith, etc). The issue is they they just suck damage wise and have horrendous durability compared to ballistic weapons.
---
We don't need perk stuff to fix energy weapons, we need their raw damage values and durability values corrected to be in line with other weapons. Also energy DR is calculated differently than physical DR AFAIK, so even for samy damage per hit, energy weapons do worse.
---
Actually yeah me too. The email i got said something about a discount not being applied correctly. I dont quite understand it but free money is free money i guess
---
If you don't want to worry about that you should just use pacifist, I would be aggroing lots otherwise.
---
I used to be. But now I‚Äôm almost always in my PA. I love my excavator set. It‚Äôs just that the hazmat suit is way more radiation friendly especially when I stack a radx with a radx diluted.  
---
I‚Äôm only level 45 so I‚Äôm not ready for the battle portion of nukes. I sell bulk junk and flux when available so the hazmat suit is kinda like my work uniform. :) I just stay as far away from the enemy ‚Äúhot spot‚Äù areas as possible. 
---
I can‚Äôt create good carry weight armor yet. So PA is necessary for me.
---
 [my two sets of PA](https://imgur.com/gallery/bgUOht2) 
---
It‚Äôs easy to accidentally hit something and get a 10 cap bounty so destroying their base for 10 caps makes you the asshole
---
All I wanted to do was to politely decline an invitation to a party not FLAT OUT ASSHOLE GLADIATOR DENY them
---
That doesn't work for me unfortunately, it doesn't move my spawn locations. I seem to have a few that it's set for me to spawn at regardless of how far I've moved the device or the direction its facing.
---
I have not seen a legendary radium rifle drop for me but my friend got one. Also, is that gun any good? I thought the appeal of the gun was the radiation damage which is only good against humans making it an odd choice in this game. 
---
I was talking about Laser weapons specifically though. I've seen legendary versions of all other energy weapons except the laser. 
---
I'm certain it's just the odds, but some stuff just drops way too frequently and some not at all. I get that better weapons should be rarer, but there really doesn't seem to be a correlation with that. I'll find legendary heavy weapons and melee of pretty much all kinds, but I rarely see legendary rifles, shotguns or pistols. Then id say the majority of the time its armor that drops, but in this game you get penalized for wanting to be a no PA build. This causes people to just server hop and legendary farm even more because many players do not care to use anything outside of power armor which makes 60% of their legendary drops useless to them other than some quick caps. 
---
Here's to looking forward ^.^
---
I'm bulking and selling everything over 100 but I'm still pretty new to this. My stash is always too full.
---
This is actually a pretty popular opinion....
---
Even just a map like RDR2 would be nice :-)
---
well, alot of the plants and such in game should be easy to grow, the fact that they are thriving given the radiation and environments means they are hardy.  Hell, the fungi should all be plantable as fungus is pretty easy to culture and grow, so long as you know what your doing
---
It did not work for me..I just got this game and it won‚Äôt let me in the game and just keeps saying [4:9:1]. Please help if you can..
---
Sure, I could've died too, that would've been worse.
---
'TSE weapon and chameleon' This for sure man, keep hearing the melee guys saying OP, go 10 rounds with equally skilled players and look at the K.D.R bet ya is 10-0 to the ranged player. 
---
I wonder with the new proposed pvp servers? they may tune down some of the weapons / builds. Since most builds have 1 shot capabilities regardless of resistances or HP, it can't really work at the minute.
---
Yeah they're using unlimited weight containers (I believe the devs forgot to add weight restriction to some containers because most are 0/5, 0/10, 0,50 etc while some are just 0/0) they are scattered around the whole map and some are indeed inside workshops. 
---
Could be a nice fix to make life harder for the dupers 
---
Even just a map like RDR2 would be nice.  
---
I have a theory about this, as it's happened to me a couple of times; that if a server is due to come down for a reboot or maintenance, it stops accepting logins and attempts to patiently wait for everyone to leave. Only for emergency deployments or if people aren't leaving fast enough does it give up and inform you it's shutting down. 
---
Naw naw
---
Should probably do 8 for bloody mess as well... it's a staple for any build.
---
Txcowboy69 level 60 something but don't mind helping ya out
---
Should have made the Voice of Set the AP pistol - at least that can be upgraded, but no scope.
---
5 bulk, unless it is something that character in particular is hunting. My heavy exposive person is always low on fertilizer and adhesive. My shotgunner is perpetually short on plastic. 
---
Basically, I only keep any amount of things I'm constantly crafting.
---
I keep all screws, springs, ultracite, black titanium, etc. and similar. I don't ever sell those.
---
Things that don't bulk that aren't used / useful for repetitive crafting I tend to ditch to 50 (asbestos, etc.)
---
No. But have logged in since and occasionally had it not placed due to someone else being on the same spot.
---
Oh man please
---
Hur dur sure it was 
---
Most people I encounter with a mic are either having a 200 person family reunion or are 6 year olds with friends over who also don't know how to mute mics 
---
I've thought about jumping out on people at my raider toll booth and singing " stop in the name of love" to break the ice, however I canny hold.a tune in a bucket.
---
That's my impression of explosive shotguns.. haven't found one yet :(   I do have a two-shot shotgun though and it is a *pain* to get the grouping tight.  It doesn't do well at all at range.
---
daisycutter comes with the mirv mod already installed

I'm on ps4 and pc. On ps4, my gamer tag is sonicblue10, on pc it's sonicblue13. Lmk when you'll be on.

---
Personal responsibility.  People are their own masters.  Social media presence makes it so these issues can't be ignored by Bethesda.  This is a positive thing.  You don't see me (or most of you) duping, do you?  No.. we're not cheaters.  But now we know what behavior to be on guard for...
---
I'm on the fence about the issue... but I lean towards only punishing (and by punishment I mean permanent ban / account wipe) those that actually engage in such behavior.
---
Damn it Paula Abdul. Go back to judging stupid singing contests and leave our games a lone. 
---
And I'm over here just having staring contests with mothman until he flies away 
---
What's does tse mean?
---
I dint remember where in this thread now (on phone, hard af to find stuff) but imagine BACK PACKS oof I'd kill for cosmetic bags and things I can hang off them. Irl I have like a tiny plushy on my bag, but like imagine we could craft like molerat teeth to hang off out guns, melee weapon handles and bags. Oooh I really want this
---
I didn't see you at the convention
---
Just wait till you encounter the Scorched Mothman, he spawns at level 95 minimum from my experience
---
They (mothmen) are good for balistic fiber though, they drop scraps of it (likely their fur/antenae) and their wings scrap into it too
---
i never claimed it would be a factory produced quality product but I promise you learning to use a loom or however a canvas bag would be made in the old world wouldn't be an impossible task in 4-6 months. My busia taught all of my siblings and all of my cousins and I how to sew, knit and crochet in one summer at our family cottage. It's not like building a nuclear reactor dude... Learning any craft takes dedication and effort, Mastering a craft takes years but learning one can take very little time. 
---
Achivements are broken. I've accomplished many things and not gotten it for them.
---
Luck will let you find gear at higher durability.  Same as the intelligence repair perk so that‚Äôs a wash really. 
---
Good to know.
---
I still like the first two though. Science giving basically the "plumber" perk to energy weapons and Science Expert doing something for ammo charges (makes them kind of unique then, with investment they become really high capacity and all). So maybe have master rank do something to damage, maybe have it turn part of the damage into piercing damage or something.
---
All that along with tuning the actual stats to be more usable at a base level.
---
Hahaha you are Right :D
---
&gt;Check your cynicism at the door 
---
While I agree that people need to strive to be more understanding and less cynical when it comes to issues like this overall... Bethesda has kind of earned the skepticism surrounding them at this point, don‚Äôt you think? 
---
Looks superb! I don‚Äôt think I could summon the will to wrestle against the settlement builder enough to create something like this, so kudos. All the spawned clutter just brings home how much we‚Äôre missing out on with our empty shelves and tables. 
---
Hazmat suit!
---
It is not something he is doing, this is a bug. I didn‚Äôt get to assign a special point my last level up, and it was not randomly assigned. The point just never was, the point disappeared into thin air for me. I am considering deleting the character because I don‚Äòt want to hit level 50 and be a SPECIAL point shorter than everyone else.
---
mmmph. I've been avoiding doing stuff like that after I figured out that the rewards scale to your level. That level 50 All Rise is pretty nice as a backup. 
---
If this were an exploit, mayhaps telling everyone about it is a fantastic way to spread it.
---
The XP glitch is not the only issue. The weapon duping is. 
---
Painted parts can't be traded/dropped.  Also a good way to safeguard accidental sale/dropping of power armor chassis but you can still scrap it!
---
Not ready for the sound of silence when I hit 100
---
If playing heavy you need one gun army for 3. It is a mandatory for heavy builds. I personally do 10 in it for starched 2 points of class freak and 3 point bloody mess it is 15% bonus damage across all guns and effects the expo damage as well.   
---
Can you play a no luck build yes but you will hurt yourself simply because you kinda need one gun army. 
---
How do you have 50 stimpacks to give away? I always feel like I'm running out. 
---
To let you know where you're probably going wrong, you still need to meet the perk requirement to attach a mod.
---
Two shot explosive, which is basically everyone‚Äôs ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want to play the game, I just want to have one fun that kills everything instantly‚Äù go to.
---
would be a good use of all the damn voting boxes all over but Modus seems to control pretty much everything and I'm thinking Modus was the main reason behind the nukes dropping in the first place... that robot is sketchy at best and if you listen to all of the Enclave messages and such by starting a mission in the enclave entrance off a broken robot, you learn how shit went down inside the Enclave after the bombs dropped and how twisted things got.
---
The ballots all over might play into it but I'm thinking Modus is going to have a bigger say/part in all that...
---
Same as the item duping. Either way people need to be made aware and you can always report people using the exploit, if that indeed what this is.
---
They need a robust road map and changelog. You know how normal people have to do lists? We need that here.
---
I feel like it might cause some glitches and the last thing they want is more bugs 
---
my build is mostly around STR and INT but still have 11 in Luck  
---
I explain why this is the case   
---
First in endgame you probably will farm mutations and use them, I cant think playing without marsupial and speed demon to be honest  
---
This will need starched genes 2* and class freak 3*  to be viable so you wont loose em or suffer from negative effects  
---
So thats 5 points right there  
---
Second you would want the perk bloody mess at 3* for a overall 15% dmg boost that works for everything  
---
Another 3 points  
---
Third since I like heavy weapons as you do the perk one gun army 3* is almost necessary to be good in queen fights etc.  
---
You really need that cripple effect for her to come down.   
---
So even with a build I never intended to be around luck theres still too much stuff to ignore it, you probably will end up putting points in luck at the end, too    
---
And dont forget Super Duper 3* which I also switch always in for crafting
---
Not true. I hunted a wanted player to a house, and kicked in the door and all the walls. Now of he hides in a friends house you will get wanted
---
Aliens have been lore for a while
---
Pre-War Quarters (would be awesome) used in shotgun shell, then make damage 1.25-2x when using, but then make the coins more rare in the world, due to the fact that with inflation (a comic book costing almost 30 or 40 bucks) then there would be more Paper Money around.
---
So I know that helps with hunger, but does it increase your healing from it too?  
---
I'm actually about to buy the Carnivore Mutation no matter what, was just curious to see if anyone had this figured out yet.
---
&gt; But it literally will not apply the mod, unless that's a bug for some people, I really can't add them without the listed materials....
---
You probably don't have the perk equipped. You actually DO need the perk for some reason.
---
I have a prime recievered, furious, explosive, plasma gatling, that does quite well. Other than that I dont use energy weapons.
---
I would rather not have any mikrotransaktions and pay for quality DLC... but I understand, that would split the community and maybe even the server infrastructure. But Vault-DLCs or new regions would work, so I don't see that many problems with it... but it is what it is and I will never buy atoms anyway.
---
Totally, I agree with banning cheaters on FO76. I don't so much agree with banning "the messenger" in this subreddit (people trying to spread the word about exploitable bugs).
---
Eh, it's another point of entry for bugs and people complaining.  No thanks.
---
Since they're hosted on AWS.. we just not get a patch for a while =P
---
Shotguns work best on molemen, especially with armor piercing rounds. They drop combat shotguns if you can kill a few and get to scrapping it will help out, even better with perks.
---
Vendor only sells armor mods not the plans we are looking for.
---
Hmm. Could have swore it just came with reduced weight and i added the mirv mood, but that was a couple weeks ago. Can't say i remember for sure now. 
---
Here's the Paladin Paint  
---
[https://imgur.com/a/SXwdjul](https://imgur.com/a/SXwdjul)
---
I agree tbh. For example when I visited this sub on Jan 1 in my head I was thinking ‚ÄúI‚Äôll just check the sticky post for updates on the broken silo issue‚Äù before remembering they just have this old ass issues thread stickied. Imagine all the reposting, misinformation, and drama that could be avoided if mods had kept a stickied post saying ‚Äúhere‚Äôs what‚Äôs happening (silo reset it whack), here‚Äôs what we know (unintentional, no Whitesprings event), here‚Äôs a real time update (Beth aware... hotfix coming.... servers going down at 2:30pm, etc). Isn‚Äôt that what most subs for online games would do?
---
Two-Shot Explosive
---
&gt; Same as the item duping.
---
Yes, I think it's fucking stupid when people walk everyone through that exploit as well.
---
&gt;Either way people need to be made aware
---
No, they really don't.
---
&gt;you can always report people using the exploit
---
No one is getting banned for using exploits, so you're comletely just spreading a problem.
---
I can prove the Paladin paint does, and I've seen Knight and Elder and Sentinel in our BoS group on PC.  
---
I know there was a mini gun or something, but I was also switching between my TSE Rapid Fire Hand Made and my TSE Prime 50 Cal Machine Gun. When she landed I used my Furious Grog Axe. She melted real good considering the low number of people around or maybe because the low number of people and every one was working on her well.
---
Just found this thread having lost my garb of mysteries to this bug. Not happy.
---
I had a horde event in the bog last week. I fast travel in to a all out fucking brawl between scorch, super mutants, mirelurk, a SCORCHBEAST, and a Mirelurk Queen.....
---
2 deaths and 9 Stimpacks later it's over.... Only me and a Mothman that I never knew was there...... staring at me..... like he just bore witness to my glory.... we had a moment...... then he vanished. It was the most epic thing I have experienced in this game yet.
---
I was he would've stayed still for a pic though
---
I‚Äôm still sad they don‚Äôt have fort boremen 
---
Ugh I just typed out a huge paragraph and went to edit it but accidentally deleted it RIP
---
Also love a accidentally shooting 1 Whitesprings Mr.Gardener then not only a horde of Ghouls, which are all level 50 for some fucking reason, along with an army of weaker bots that get 1 tapped by a level 5 pipe pistol.
---
So the Gun 5 perk does affect Energy weapons? That's gross because my Lazer rifle still breaks quite quickly, and doesn't do nearly as much damage as anything else I have. 
---
I just wanna wander around in T-60 with my Plasma rifle and FEEL like I have the technological advantage. 
---
Bonus pic - Kassandra
---
Every time i attack a mothman they just go poof up into the air and are gone.
---
Old, slow, controlling that stick to land on the right spot never works for me.
---
Even emotes i can never hit the one i want.
---
It was a play on OP title. 
---
Nonsense, $5 for a small black no-entry sign on your forehead is totally reasonable.
---
100% certain it comes with it, because that was part of the reason i got it, and then a few days after i found the recipe for the mirv mod and it didn‚Äôt matter anyway.
---
Ok thanks.
---
Oh... Okay then. 
---
Coolest house-wife evz
---
Bethesda messed up, they gave us way too many free atoms, and now are having to set prices high based on that, relative to "real" money.
---
They should have divided the price by 10, and also given us a tenth the free atoms.  So you still get as many "free" things, and your real money would go further.
---
Compared to now where I have almost 4000 free atoms, and they are stuck knowing if they lower the prices significantly, I can just buy everything for "free" I'd ever need.
---
About 2/3 of the people I encounter with mics are eating a never-ending bag of chips or apparently have a horrible cold. None of them apparently know there is a push to talk feature or don't care.
---
I thought the loot wasn't shared at all? Some stuff is?
---
Why do that?
---
Oh my god that's genius
---
Yeah, I mean I built my character with high int because I intended it to be a crafter that used lasers but lasers suck. I even found a weapon I want to use if they fix lasers, a 2 shot ultracite laser (unfortunately no other effects). Started building my own ultracite lasers and deconstructing them to learn mods too.
---
4x ammo explosive lever action is a ton of fun
---
I don't have images of all the ranks, but our BoS group on PC has a guy that was traded the paint plans by another player. This is my Paladin painted armor, and I know we have Knight, Knight Captain, Sentinel, and Elder as well.  
---
Fair enough.  I play in PC so just being able to tap a number is nice
---
A 48 year old woman helping a little kid on a video game, seen it all now!
---
Nah, dying is no big deal in FO76.
---
Now, if you died in real life that would suck.  Not that you'd be worrying about it though.
---
A few people have stocked some plans and just sell them for a reasonable price. Or level an alt if they have the time. 
---
Both viable options. Leveling ults with mates is kind of fun. 
---
They all generate the same items and they all produce screws. I had a junk extractor for the first two months of playing until I moved from the west to the east. 
---
Think it maxes at level 45. At least I hope it does. My alt is level 41 and I'm waiting till 45 to finish up her first set of quests in order to get the lvl 45 version of black diamond.
---
Black Diamond was my Goto Melee weapon for quite awhile. But then i found the Chainsaw Flamer Mod and have been using that. If you over repair it via Weapon Artisan it does almost 50 damage total add in a armor piercing blade and it can tear through things.
---
Do you have to find plans for upgraded under armor all I can make is the base of what I have 
---
No. Even if there was it would be in the magazine slot and would most likely be standard harpoon, which would decrease your damage a lot if your using an explosive one
---
Hbo miniseries. Invasion of Iraq in 2003 from the viewpoint of the Marine 1st recon battalion. I wasn't infantry and didn't go to Iraq but in my opinion this is the best onscreen depiction of the corps since fmj.
---
good thing I stick to Rimmer's rules... Never take on anything with more teeth than the Osmond family...
---
Right, I feel like they'd make more money if stuff was priced reasonably because more people would be willing to spend atoms. 
---
$20 is way too much for a skin.  Stuff should be like $5 max. 
---
And get rid of this "limited time" garbage. It's predatory as fuck. 
---
Thanks, this will be so helpful.
---
That's a good idea. I've been considering trying to get a set of Weightless armor for when I'm naked.
---
But this could be a viable alternative. 
---
Marsupial makes life so much easier.
---
Healing factor means barely ever having to use stimpacks.
---
I can live without any of the mutations except marsupial, it is just way too useful.
---
White knight is a much better choice for armor. 
---
Yeah ps4 uses a circle selection thing and ya have to get left stick to choose.. ill choose go to hit it and it jumps to next one.. annoys the piss outta me so just gotten used to not using it at all
---
They are a game changer
---
bringing the methods to light forces them to fix the methods. keep in mind these were known in beta and it didn't get resolved or become an issue until it was mass produced. Dont pretend like this game has a decent ingame economy because the pillars weren't setup to support that. Between easy whitespring farming to server hopping this game isn't a decent player economy game.
---
Lol the one time I saw mothman I was lvl 15 and didn‚Äôt know what it was cause it was night and for some reason I didn‚Äôt turn my pip-light on. I shot it a whole bunch and I think it glitched cause I never attacked. Then (cause I was so low leveled) I used up every piece of ammo I had and still didn‚Äôt kill it. Luckily I was by a train stop so I went and bought the meager amount of ammo the vendor had and had to resort to melee weapons to kill the little sh*t. Got a cool pic with my ‚Äúheroic‚Äù slay with me next to the dead beast.
---
That's how I'm building my second character. Mutations add another level to the game, I haven't played with a full mutation build yet, but it's definitely two different styles between with and without mutations. 
---
They need to put silent hill in the game, it takes place in W. V. 
---
I had a random encounter with a mothman last night near Alpine River Cabins. He appeared in the middle of the road in front of me and immediately battle music started playing. I ran up to him and he did... nothing. I decided that its silent stare was a little unnerving so I shot it, and still nothing. I unloaded my clip on it and it did not move until it died and I got the dying mothman animation. Looking back, I should have snapped a selfie with it.
---
Yes to all of that!  I‚Äôm pretty basic irl but I like to get creative in games sometimes. I‚Äôd love some accessories to play with 
---
No way he's that high without glitch
---
The ultracite and institute weapons are especially disappointing. LVL 50 energy weapons are worse than LVL 20 ballistic weapons.
---
lets not forget the 'chance to fix armor on taking damage' and 'chance to fix guns when shooting' perks, the later actaually let me deplete a full overcharged gatplas prime core the other night (500some shot)
---
Is this across all platforms?
---
Nice lesbian hipster hair style, much edgy.
---
What is with the crazy prices for stupid shit?
---
Normally when you click on the piece it should show three options, 25, 35, and 45, but maybe it has to do with the 25 being tied to the quest or something, try maybe using a different PA station in another location
---
Do you have any useful team related perks? I have level 3 Rad Sponge and the one that gives +6 DR for each team mate, so if I'm looking to team up I'll let them know I'm happy to share whichever they prefer. People almost always accept, and almost always choose rad sponge.
---
I don‚Äôt think it works like that
---
I see you mention Morden alot, who and what is this? :P I'm confused it means "the murder" in my language.
---
Have a question. Its a similiar perk card for guns? Ill love to have one like that. White Knight its really usefull
---
BuT mUh InStaNT SatiSFaCtIon!
---
So 8 LUCK is probably ideal, I went with 9 for the Curator perk in addition to Class Freak/Starched Genes/Bloody Mess.
---
Do you have the necessary parts? Some people choose the "show craftable only" option
---
I've seen that in my completely unrelated industry, too - someone at level 1 gets a request, they can't handle it but know who can. They pass along request to level 2, now customer and level 1 are waiting. Level 2 passes it to level 3 - now level 1 is so in the dark they *can't* give any quality update to customer... but they probably should say something, anything. 
---
It takes a huge company to consistently turn out games and products like the Fallout franchise, and unfortunately glacially slow customer service is a likely side product. 
---
I have two levels of that equipped.
---
Thanks for taking the time, I always wonder if those perks were worth it. 
---
yep i usually end up with 26 glowing meat after a uranium fever + each one crafted is worth 9xp
---
4
---
Eh kind of, wanted levels take really long to go away, so theyd have to constantly be in public events for 4+ hours at the minimum, seems pointless
---
Yeah i have all parts and all the mats to craft, but when i put a frame on the stand, the only option is level 25 
---
&gt; institute weapons
---
What? Are you just talking about FO4 there are or are those in this game somewhere? I'm guessing they were worse in FO4 because they were so much more common and mass produced (you'll have dozens of those for each actual laser pistol you find).
---
I'm OK with everything but removing wouldn't it be nice 
---
I love number 11. There is at least 7 vendors in the whitespring resort and you want them all to have 200 each?
---
There I was thinking: Jesus, \*\*\*finally\*\*\* I get to meet a live human NPC.
---
Not a crap answer. I appreciate your feedback, thank you
---
Yes there‚Äôs a couple different perks that increase weapon life. Gunsmith/Licensed Plumber/ And makeshifts warrior are a few. 
---
I'm in the same place.. My cat dies for no fucking reason it makes me so angry.. Looks just like my cat IRL I can't stand to see it hurt...
---
You mean like trying to travel from one rooftop to another? I think it just takes practice in how to use it to avoid falling too fast which is what causes the stagger. If you jet constantly and gain a lot of height then you'll fall too fast and stagger. If you pulse the Jetpack to maintain your height to be more level with the surface you're trying to reach then you won't fall too fast.
---
It's like the difference between throwing a ball as far as you can (45¬∞ angle) and throwing a frisbee as far as you can.
---
Refund amount for the cost of Fallout 1 and 2, as well as Tactics. I got refunded for all three.
---
Ty for clarifying
---
I'd rather racks we can place them in.
---
Oh thats a great shout, will try that! Can I still finish the quest if I build a set elsewhere though?
---
Have 70 on me now and more stored, I know somewhere to get plenty, so I give them away...
---
Yup! I was thinking the same thing with my hunting rifle, the long barrel saves weight. So weird.
---
I actually love that! I can use my mic separately while still hearing sound from speaker lol i hate wearing headphone
---
How long is a while?  I got fire on the bethesda forums because "Mothership Zeta doesn't count because it's DLC.  In NV, "easter eggs don't count especially if you need wild wasteland perk to be active." 
---
I throw up a little every time I hear about the "market". Now people can farm for their own gear!! How can you complain that the way you enjoy playing the game is ruined, but expect others to ruin how they want to play to fit yours? It's an exploit, sure. But it's an exploit that allowed a ton of people to not have to barter with someone who has the free time and luck to go find great stuff, and then completely control the prices on the "market". 
---
I'm sure the TSE handmade I got was duped, but now I can help my friends find strong weapons of their own, and we no longer have to be as desperate when trading. Now, we have more power and say so in trading!! 
---
FREE STATES. 
---
The circle is now complete. When I left you, I was but the learner. Now I am the master
---
There's almost always one of them at the Pylon tower near Bog Town. It's the only place I've constantly seen one spawn. 
---
nope, and I still have those random water purifiers that can't be deleted
---
&gt;So I know that helps with hunger, but does it increase your healing from it too?I'm actually about to buy the Carnivore Mutation no matter what, was just curious to see if anyone had this figured out yet.
---
yup increases healing and food.
---
Right. The handling of ticket systems, and escalated customer issues is in no way relatable across industries. Because the only difference between. Me getting the ok on. $3000 re-bury, and a Bethesda rep getting the ok on replacing $200 worth of product does not in any way have similar limitations.
---
"I can't authorize that amount directly, I will have to forward it to my department head."
---
You see ticket and escalation systems are all pretty similar. A ticket is submitted. A department reviews said ticket. If they can provide a solution they do. If not they forward it to the appropriate channel. Or escalate it. Rinse. Repeat.
---
Have you worked in either industry? Lets assume no. Oh wait. This is the internet. Of course you have. And so you can reliably speak on the escalation and ticket system of either industry. 
---
Yea, what completes the quest is just being scanned in the excavator set by hitting the button, itd seem weird for the quest to be locked in at only level 25, I cant say 100% for sure though since I did it at level 25 since thats when it first unlocks
---
ALL DE CHEMS
---
Great answer.
---
I can't remember if I had Power Smith equipped when I was crafting mine, but I was able to craft level 45 when I was building my excavator suit.
---
Its another Game with mutations, I recommend to have at least 5 point on LUCK, and one in CHA for the mutations perk cards
---
Never thought about it like adding a limit to containers, I mean like trash cans and such. You don't need them to hold infinite just a few pounds to hold the rng loot.
---
Sorry, I meant enclave weapons (the plasma ones you get from the bunker). My brain is fusing FO4 and FO76 crazy bunker people clearly.
---
I have used both. For me lucky break was much more helpful than .06 percent of the time. I have a 7 lick build so I imagine that has something to do with it. Any luck perk card is effected by the amount of points you have allotted to luck as well. 
---
For example a friend of mine has a 3 luck build. When we both use super duper for crafting mine triggers more frequent than hers does. 
---
PC :(
---
Cool, thanks!!
---
Great idea; but do you honestly think in your heart of hearts Bethesda are going to make content like that for this game? 
---
Sadly I think not. Based on what we've gotten this far I'm going to go on a limb and suggest the additional "content" which will release for this game will be a few more things for the atom shop and maybe 2-3  single quest style dlc which will be about the size of $5 expansion pack dlc. 
---
These "dlc/quest/content" will basically be 1 new fast travel point in the map (ie a new or already existing unopened vault) and a 1 hour go to point a grind item b type quest ...
---
Sorry if I just spoiled Bethesdas 2019 roadmap for anyone but I think anyone paying attention at this point kinda knows how this is going to shake out.
---
I did think the scanning might be the key to finishing it, but will try on a different stand, thanks
---
I took a 15% pay cut to change jobs. 
---
The benefit of not dealing with the types of people who populate this sub and have "conspiracy" or just flat wrong ideas of how customer service works was worth every single penny. 
---
Oh ok, are enclave weapons stronger than normal plasma weapons? I don't think I have the plans for them.
---
Great tips ty. I will have to consider sticking with luck ‚òòÔ∏è
---
oh thank god, it was almost a half hour since the last dupe post.
---
Thanks will try that
---
Yeah such as when renaming a gun you can use asterisks to make italics etc 
---
The tesla rifle is a beast at close and mid range, but it's only got about half of it's advertised ~200 meter range. Basically, I want to be able to fight Bravos with it, but can't. 
---
Oh well nevermind then. How does DLC not count? Buncha goofs
---
awesome thanks!
---
Awesome work!  I really enjoy the use of the angled walls!
---
I haven't taken that card, but it could also explain it, I thought it was just for mods?
---
Yeah. See I just don't quit in spawn areas. 
---
Because loading the world map can take a few moments. Which is to be expected. Especially on console. 
---
Like the padded mod on armor?
---
Pretty much. Which as someone who plays with pacifist mode on, it's useless.
---
Why do you say that ? It has been pretty well documented as 32
---
https://www.pcgamesn.com/fallout-76/fallout-76-server-size
---
Honestly I don't notice too much of an issue, but I'm a vats-crit build on my main and melee on my alt. I imagine that helps! 
---
Actually the only time I think it may have been an issue was when I was doing the Camp McClintock timed gun course. For the guns I tried to use initially, between their reload animation and the slight increase in time I have for aiming it was impossible. Once I switched to a gun with more rapid fire I was okay.
---
I think if I was into PVP it would be more of an issue, but just out in the world I can't say it feels much like a hardship. I might feel differently if I tried out using m&amp;k and had a more recent difference to compare it to.
---
Yeah, it was amazing.  I've been holding off on fighting the SBQ, mostly because I still wanted there to be something big to look forward to.  But I was in the area a few days ago while others were fighting her.  I wasn't really outfitted to take her on, but it had been going on for a while so I figured I'd pop in and help with the final push.  Wrong.  Her health had only gone down by about 5% and she survived the whole ordeal.
---
I was surprised to see her get mowed down like that last night.  Very cool.
---
Depending on the circumstances, Rad X can suppress your mutations and mess with your build.
---
If you have a friend and at least 3 charisma, sharing Rad Sponge makes radiation a second thought in nuke zones. Add in Ghoulish for even more benefit. All you need is 1 level of each.
---
Except fact at this point in time they probably got 300k of everything and still profit months/ years down the line.
---
They might do this if they reset the servers every body's character.
---
I just bought the plans for the level action last night, I plan today is to make a crap ton of guns and scrap them.
---
Sometimes, I load in as a float head. I have yet to find another float head though.
---
Thanks! Awesome that you responded! That's really cool. The ATOM shop has had some pretty neat items. Keeps me doing challenges :)
---
Took about the same time for me to get the buildable wooden Mr.Handy, and the Fallout Cookbook, both of which were listed as in stock on the webstore for merch, so maybe calm your tits, at least with this they have to actually produce the item, it's not in stock and your stuck waiting 5ish months
---
The first level is but the second level makes crafting PA need less materials. It's a weird card. I'm not entirely sure what it affects. I mostly got it to level two just so I would need less mats when building the Excavator and X-01
---
It's better than the "Bethesda is screwing me because they won't refund me after playing 178 hours of the game" posts. 
---
Delicious bacon
---
This is true seen a you tube video of someone talking about how crappy 2 shot weapons are for vats build. Said anti armor and explosive is best combo you can get for a vats build if you want to hit things still. With the anti armor he said it was about a wash in damage too. 
---
My first encounter was on a bridge full of cars.  Suddenly this van with legs is chasing me down.  I panic and run for it shooting backwards.  I make it off the bridge in time for it to catch up and kill me.  Hate those things.  Encountered the one at cranberry bog too.  Much higher level and the thing still chased me down and killed me.  Sure I got revenge later, but those things suck.
---
How much luck do you have? It makes a big difference having 10 instead of 3.
---
Great idea
---
Please and thank you!
---
Bethesda‚Äôs ‚Äòradar‚Äô only seems to kinda sorta work. Maybe they are low on adhesive or screws? 
---
Same. I thought Rose's missions were way less enjoyable, and the way she spoke to me, ugh, can't wait to Nike her from orbit.
---
Its only the high level nuke materials dropped by enemies. Probably to add a more competitive nature to the nuke zones. I just keep sharing this information to try and let newbies to the nuke zones know. If you take all the Stable Flux crafting material from the high level players working hard for it, they may try to chase you off. I really enjoy helping other players in the nuke, I hold back to let people get hits to share xp, but after they quick loot the bodies while I'm still fighting and I lose out on 80% of what I'm working for I start to get frustrated. Then I will try to get them to leave me alone, or I'll run off to the next area and ditch them.
---
The Only Shared Loot is:
---
Hardened Mass
---
Glowing Mass
---
High-Radiation Fluids
---
oh shit that i just realised that the picture you took showing the mothman is exactly where my camp is.......
---
The Gray Fox gang had a meeting tonight.
---
Location: Unknown.
---
personally it's just a different shade of shit to me. they really need stickied mega threads on the same topics.
---
Not everyone dupes and a lot of us are encumbered, so as long as they give us unlimited stash. I don't dupe and my weight is close to 2000 lbs, my stash is full of junk and PA frames. I walk everywhere on the map.
---
Honestly with VATS it isn‚Äôt a deal breaker in this game. Fortnite/call of duty type games you‚Äôd notice a big difference in skill cap. 
---
Great original idea that no one else in the world has ever suggested. 
---
They can be found at any level there, I picked up a couple on my 42 alt last night. They are just really rare is all. 
---
Perfect! Thanks!
---
There's been a few times where i've run into an area to complete a quest while someone else has been doing the same quest and just tagged along while repeatedly, and inadvertently, ignoring their team invites. I never even notice them until it says i declined their invite. 
---
Happens to me on pc. Take yesterday, I died before I could even do anything due to spawning in to a group of ghouls. 
---
It does... that's how I got my 1.5k bounty
---
There's an aggressive version and a chill version. Theres some quest you can do at a light house and he'll pop up and let you take pictures with him at the end. He's got purple eyes tho. That's when you know he's friendly. 
---
Yeah not true.  usually kill the guy inside by the time I'm done emptying my second auto grenade launcher clip... along with everything else they own.
---
What story line, as I've completed the main story myself, and a number of side stories also, although the one for following the overseer seems bugged as I've gotten all 14 holos/listend to them but it's not completing
---
Y‚Äôknow I have a picture of that meme in my house for some reason. 
---
Np my friend. Happy Wandering. 
---
Yea, that goes for anyone you are actively in combat with. 
---
Any player who‚Äôs name is in red you can break their camp, shoot their turrets, and destroy their workshops without consequence.
---
So you claim a workshop that‚Äôs already owned? Now you can shoot their turrets and not get flagged
---
So you do consenting pvp with somebody near their house? Now you can wreck it as collateral damage. 
---
Marsupial is just loads of fun.  The drop in INT is acceptable even without class freak imo.  However, add speed Demon and your reloads will be hella faster.  Especially with heavy guns.  But the need for extra food is tedious, so I suggest class freak for that.
---
That being said, you're gonna need maxed starched genes if you want to run mutations.  Accidentally clip into a rad shower without it and your mutations vanish.
---
Also, 1 point perk card for charisma is Strange in Numbers.  Mixed with marsupial, you can leap 3 story buildings... it's just so much fun.
---
Agreed. I play way overencumbered and don't dupe.
---
Nuke Zone shares loot for: High Radiation Fluids, Hardened Mass, and Glowing Mass.   
---
Other than that I agree it shouldn't matter.
---
It‚Äôs not a useless ski sword btw, it‚Äôs one of my favorite and high damaging single handed melee weapons. 
---
lo and behold\*
---
Not being a grammar Nazi, it's just a common phrase and wouldn't want you saying it wrong in the future.
---
I had a friend think "ipso facto" was "if so, fatso" for a decade.
---
Cool experience though :)
---
Love it!
---
Sorry, but 800 atoms or $8 is overpriced for 1 digital outfit.  This is worse pricing than horse armor back in the day...
---
This happened to me 2-3 days ago.
---
I played for 5 hours alone with no connection issues or hitches whatsoever. I owned most of the workshops on the map. It was glorious.
---
I have the same problem, in and out of my stash.  Seems like its increased the last couple updates.  Ignore the toxic replies,  lol.  
---
Well I see fallen down trees and logs and want to run over and collect em every single time.. Played a shooting game yesterday and tried to use VATS... Then my bf was on COD and tried to pick up a desk fan.. You're not alone lol
---
Let‚Äôs organize them in stashes and inventories first
---
How do you track down a persons base?
---
right? sometimes i know i'm going to be logging soon or whatever so it just doesnt make sense. 
---
If you read op's comments on here, he thought duping was fixed. Op also has admitted that spreading the information helped get Bethesda to try and patch it faster. I'm a little confused if he sees it as beneficial why he would also see it as bannable. 
---
Take a dip in radiation.
---
ye haha. I bought that 'Northen Lights' Power armour skin, cause it was unquie and added to thr armour and wasnt just a paint job. and then this hair is liek this price. I'm beyond confused so I just rant until someone helps make sense of thinks
---
Drops nuke on their base. Then they‚Äôll have to log out  or have you it destroyed. 
---
Geash, when I leave my mic on, I realize I spam X way to much when collecting from meat piles at the whitesprings...
---
Why would you do that to yourself? What could you possibly be carrying that you need to be THAT over encumbered?
---
I just completed silo Bravo this morning, solo. Great mission! I did launch the nuke! :)
---
The worst part was repairing the pipes. I didn‚Äôt know where they were at first and failed. After realizing my mistake it wasn‚Äôt that difficult.
---
Yep my husband and I ran into the mothman and I was like "IT'S GO TIME!", Except it kicked both of our asses lolol
---
If this was done then special penalties from withdrawl/disease/mutation should reduce perk points also, which it doesn't
---
Yes it does. Ghoulish and Rad Sponge makes Whitesprings a cake walk.
---
I'm at work for about another six hours, but if I remember I will. 
---
High armor pen doesn‚Äôt do as much damage as I‚Äôd like, it really depends on the enemy.. but my Black Diamond slays. 
---
Paying attention to what? Wild , unfounded speculation that you just made up and had no evidence to use as a basis? 
---
Now let's see. On the other hand. Since dropping the ball at release and a few communication mishaps Bethesda has
---
-Prioritized/Fixed or attempted to fix some of the most commonly complained about bugs.
---
-Started communicating more often after the community voiced their displeasure about that. 
---
- Reduced the price of New Year's Atomic shop bundles vs the previous holiday bundles after the community was upset.
---
-Will implement player vending in someway, another common community request...
---
....
---
Me thinks you aren't paying attention and are too quick to jump blindly on the hate train.
---
Is this perk useful at all?
---
Lol...I fat finger my Android and suck at proofing. Meant to and behold, but, sausage finger carelessness. Thx my friend. 
---
i have been using this perk, and it has been steadily paying off since the first rank. my armor regularly repairs itself, it's pretty consistent. as someone else pointed out, maybe it's your luck? I have 3rd rank for this perk, as well as the weapon one, with &gt;10 points in luck, and they have both been well worth it.
---
Yeah, the "endgame" Nuke Silos aren't even that hard. If that's their template (endless enemies, simple fetch/interact objectives) then it will be pretty boring. 
---
I think we need daily stickies. Camp showcase, perk card builds, QA, LFG, issues and feedback - especially a QA would be tremendous, I have so many little questions that don't warrant a new thread for each. 
---
XBox too, happens to me every time.
---
It's so they force your hand into buying - FOMO.
---
my pc is hooked up to my livingroom television and i play with an xbox controller on my couch. i've experimented with different ways to use kbm while on my couch back when i was playing OW but could never find anything that was comfortable and effective. I ended up playing OW with a controller in my left hand and mouse in my right, lol
---
I know, can't stand to not sprint
---
That makes sense, just need teammate then.
---
How is Ghoulish + Sun Kissed?
---
That's what I said!  Some people had solid reasoning.  They said that since (at the time) not everyone had access to the DLC, because it was new or still expensive for some, that it shouldn't be official.
---
I get it.  "My Lone Wanderer stopped the Zetans."  
---
"Well, mine died in the Capital Wasteland saving everyone from thirst."
---
So now, I'm wondering if this has changed.
---
Unyielding radicool builds can push 40+ S. 
---
Yeah I guess that‚Äôs me - I have a heart for broken and bad things to make them viable 
---
But it will, even with max pieces you can only mitigate 50% (if the game doesn't have diminishing returns) a standard players health pool sits at around 300ish, with the weapons base damage being 245+100%+crit+crit damage modifier from legendary and perk+adrenal modifier (there will always be some since I rarely care about rads) 
---
Your armor cant help you mitigate a single shot that deals approximately 1245 damage without factoring adrenal. Even with a max out of power armor DR perks and armor the weapon at absolute minimum would deal 420 damage to you.
---
Yeah I've figured that, but my lever action is TSE, averaging 1440~ damage by default. I don't think it can get better than that, especially when they'll fix that reload animation bug.
---
No idea, no room doe it in my build.
---
Tell me more about this " Customize your camp spawn point" 
---
I agree.. I've brought this exact thing up many times. I'm getting killed by things that I can't see, and even if I can move, my guns wont work right away. Sometimes I'll get stuck inside of a piece of my invisible CAMP, then have to temporarily remove it to get out. One time I even spawned next to a car that popped into existence, and the invisible enemies made it explode while I was loading in. Insta-death, then took a bunch more hits loading a second time before they could be killed to re-collect my junk. If I could move out of the way, that is a different story. 
---
&gt; Human NPCs, I know this is not the point of the game, but I miss those generic-ass raiders and mercenaries. I'd love for some future update to include them as an enemy. 
---
With how many remnants of humans you see, it's amazing not a single one is alive to chat. 
---
yeah, I had the same problem, although mine was because I had to spend the first 90 seconds killing robots before I recognized the "repair pipes" quest from the power plant events.
---
&gt; Bethesda, you've got to still have your assets from Fallout 3! It's probably not too difficult (versus starting from scratch!) to polish them up to the graphics standards of 4 and 76.
---
Probably more work than you think. They would have to basically remake the textures, and the models are comparativly low quality they would be better off just remaking them. Also there is the style differences between 3 and 4 they would need to account for, somost of the Fallout 3 assets are probably just unusable.
---
Sounds fun, however did it contribute to your stroke?
---
&gt;  Has alot of polish and is just frankly fun whe. Yiu ate bired especially with friends
---
Bethesda is fucking up again?
---
Shocker.
---
Maybe, if they added Creation Club items, to the Atomic store, and got actual moders to make us Hair?! I used to use so many hair mods in Skyrim and Fallout 4 lol
---
Seriously, man, if you‚Äôre at whitesprings, just turn pacifist mode on as a precaution. I use my two shot Tesla rifle when killing glowing ones there to ensure I get a hit on every one before they‚Äôre killed and I‚Äôd tear my hair out if I got a bounty every time I fired. 
---
Fight the good fi-
---
Disconnected from server.
---
Can‚Äôt you drop another nuke to force them to go off all have their base destroyed?
---
&gt; Is that a joke?
---
no it isn't because if they could have patched it they would have when they patched out all the other server hoping shit you think bethesda intended you to be able to just hop servers to get the mods or plans you wanted? no they didnt anyone who thinks they did is mentally challenged 
---
&gt;prop up the game economy 
---
game economy lol you really think they give a flying fuck about this games economy? where are the duping bans? exploiting bans? oh that's right bethesda themselves said that they have no system in place to track that kind of shit so fat chance of there ever being any people banned for duping, or using exploits 
---
All I ever hear is people saying how easy steel is to get and everyone has steel and steel is so abundant.....
---
and I'm constantly in a steel drought. That's a good way of putting it.
---
Sorry, I was hoping the sea salt and vinegar would help my sore throat. 
---
I made a thread asking Bethesda to properly address that issue:
---
[https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/aboq5f/so\_how\_long\_until\_we\_get\_an\_honest\_statement\_from/](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/aboq5f/so_how_long_until_we_get_an_honest_statement_from/)
---
48% upvoted, which means the majority of people on this subreddit are either using automated tools to silence any criticism of Bethesda or are worried someone might hurt Bethesda's feelings.
---
And I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs just me but I have always passed on bloody mess since fo 3 because I thought the killing blow animation was too over the top. I‚Äôm ok losing the 15% damage lol
---
Ive met and ran with several women on this game.. in my main group of friends got one that joins us regularly..
---
Always get a kick out her playing style too.. she kneecaps everything then runs up to em and 10mm em to the back of the head.. while giggling..
---
&gt;Yeah, I'd like the other raider stuff back, they added the Trapper set, but not the helmets to match lol. I wanted the silly Lobster cage one again haha, I loved that one.  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;When it comes to pricing I've liked the Northern Lights PA skin, Pink sunhat (wish it was black or pale blue), the tuxedo bundle and sparkly dress, I've only bought the Lights armour and Sun hat out them 4 but the prices I liked. I thought of getting the dress but was like. I'll never use it so didn't bother.  
---
&gt;I'm happy to pay a bit more than normal pricing for cosmetics as I can earn them but still. A lot of these items are not worth their price at their quality. I'm hoping before they release any cool Mothman stuff or nice hairs and stuff they'll sorted pricing out and found a nice spot to stay at. It bugs me they keep jumping between prices lol. And I hope they add free cosmetics with dlc updates... Cause they have added some Fallout 4 assets into the store and that worries me
---
With max Bear Arms it weighs 0.6lbs 
---
Check on r/market76

 a lot of guys there would trade you one for around 4k caps or a decent weapon or unyielding armor piece.

Oh the assaultrons. I dreaded hearing that voice! I cleared out as many robots as I could prior to starting each section.
---
Only budget AFAIK. The base i built as a level 10, was still just as big once i was 50.
---
Well I have no clue if it has. I didn't know it wasn't qualified as true canon so that's pretty lame. But I am fairly certain most other DLCs qualify as canon, maybe I'm wrong but if all DLC is null and void that's super boring.
---
100 mb is really slow dude.
---
*I know you meant 100 Mb, I'm just fuckin with you*
---
I mean just do the same w/ a rifle and 3x faster. Less ammo farming, quick killing. 
---
Well, if only the size of the C.A.M.P area increases, i don't think that will be too bad for the servers, it just dictates where the player can place stuff.
---
Easiest way to get quick money just travel around and sell everything in whitespring where after you got through all the vendors they allready resetted not broken or so
---
I saw a red Bud bottle cap on the ground and thought I better pick it up. Oh wait, I cannot spend those in the real world.

lol, no biggie.

I knew a guy that applied to Goldman Sachs after he got his MBA. He sent a letter/resume and Word didn't catch that he wrote "butt" instead of "but".

According to the players guide Somerset has a chance to drop from back on the beat(?), The escort event in Morgantown
---
Nah, they made it so nukes dont destroy bases anymore. 
---
Chameleon has a 20% cloaking effect. Cloaking (the legendary effect) also stacks. So the more pieces you have the stronger the stealth field. Chameleon mutation has a 99% stealth field but breaks once you fire your gun. I noticed a difference from going from 4 pieces down to 2. High perception enemies like robots and Super Mutants are the best was to test this.
---
Thanks, I looked around a bit but didn't find any info. Luckily I found another Tesla gun without the charging barrel shortly after. 
---
Weapon artisan is under intelligence and it only costs 3 points
---
Chameleon seems to only affect players and not enemies, I've been agrod from like half a mile away while under it's affect by an SB (and I've got 6 or 7 AGI, so it's not a 'bad' stat in that)
---
V.A.T.S.
---
How would a regular nuke fair against a V.A.T.S. critical mininuke?
---
problem is, after playing for awhile, you stop gaining atoms. because you finish all the easy challeneges and get stuck doing long ass stuff and dailys so the "tons" of free atoms they promised us, slows down

Does your avatar wear a fedora or something similar? Ran into a blue haired gal at Sutton station few days ago. Not sure if I dropped a few stims or not. 
---
Thanks for the refund tip. Hope we get some better hairstyles (be nice for free, seems like fo4 had more selection of styles but then again I modded the hell out of it so I may just be remembering that). Some neck jewelry would be cool too. 
---
I carry 1 of each weapon I find, Yes I know I don't need to, even if I didn't, I carry 5-10 super sledges and they break often enough. If we had a decent stash size I could play the game as it was meant. I also have a lot of chems, clothes, water etc, it just became a nightmare to try manage and before I know it I had too much. I stopped caring and walking around semi emcumbered isn't too bad .. once stash is fixed I can finally fast travel ..
---
Sadly this is correct, on the torso, bos Combat Armor grants 83 physical, and Energy (118 if you line it with asbestos like I tend to for that sweet, sweet imunity to being set on fire)
---
The limited time stuff is really shitty. If they are gonna do that then it should be for seasonal stuff only or for unique, in-game events that will only be during a certain time period. 
---
The $20 skins are pretty pricey, but I truly think that it would be warranted if it was for some really awesome skin or a pack of skins. Cool visual/sound effects, customizable colors and the like. 
---
I would pay 20 dollars for a deathclaw pelt skin that uses the skull as a helmet and makes roaring sounds when you use melee weapons. Or a suit similar to the stealth suit in Old World Blues from New vegas. 
---
I understand that some people still do not consider that worth the money, but still... the bar is set far too low at the moment. They should have a large range of skins from basic to intricate and spectacular and the prices should reflect the quality. 
---
like i said though. Its really early. hopefully thats coming. 
---
I know I'm sick of seeing "Dear Bethesda" threads. One, because almost every suggestion should have been there since release and, two, because they most likely don't give a shit that you can't tell your PA apart.

yeah, that's definitely weird. i was iffy when i got the perk, but it was working so well for me that i got all 3 ranks + all 3 ranks of the weapon one. wouldn't have invested if it didn't. maybe just bad rng?
---
I know it's a ton of work, but like I said, less work than starting from scratch probably. üòÅ
---
&gt;!You should pick it up during the scorched detector quest when you go to one of the bunkers for heaters and fan motors.!&lt;
---
As someone else who also spent years first working and then monitoring tickets, I have to say I disagree with both of you to an extent.

When techs and service reps are overworked with tickets due to not enough manpower, or even when they're not, they tend to work on tickets that they can easily resolve. Agents are often rewarded for high numbers of ticket resolutions. Resolving an atypical ticket like this requires an agent to check in with and communicate outside the department. Communicating outside the department takes frequent calls and effort. This is likely one of those tickets that the agents have seen come in several times (as OP submitted it more than once), and it is likely either getting marked "not my job" or "no known fix" and just left to age. 
---
This is all of course speculation, but it's an educated guess.
---
I hate it even more now. Did it all the way to governors seal, then server crashed and when i logged back the quest says:  Obtain a military-issue ID.  :/
---
Which build it would help a lot if you showed me what I am supposed to be looking at.
---
Maybe a new feature? Oh please please please
---
Oh
---
You got to much stuff. If you see the items bouncing around odds are you are going to black out and crash. Try stashing your notes and holos maybe unload some apparel. I haven't had the issue for days now that I ditched the holos notes and moved down to 15 clothing pieces (aside from armor)  from about 100 since I had a habit of picking every outfit i came across up.  
---
Not sure on the tesla bug I haven't used one in weeks. 
---
I had no idea those were shared. I have a few hardened glowing mass and rad fluid, a few flux as well. What do I do with it? I've only just started going into nuke sites. 
---
Its way less now lol, they started this back in november
---
53 y/o woman with a full time job, here.  It looks like I'm at 175 hours because I had a lot of vacation downtime over the holiday.
---
Damn, I was just assuming only the owner and their team could do this. Bethesda, pls fix!
---
I'm pretty sure the rest of us are playing the game "the way it was meant". I'm not sure why your weapons break that much..I haven't had to repair my super sledge in about a week. You might want to look into your perk setup. 
---
Nah... tickets are not overlooked.  If they are in the system, someone can see them all.
---
Yes, no, yes
---
They literally said theres a big improvement patch coming before all of the dlc lol
---
I found a lead deposit from the fallout resource map that was published earlier on Reddit. Moved my C.A.M.P. next to it and set up a resource collector. I end up with 14 lead pretty much everytime I head to camp. 
---
Really awesome camp !
---
At this point, banning dupers will be a big chunk of the playerbase, so don't get your hopes up. 
---
How about they install a camp expansion of say 20 percent hidden in a treasure map that can only be used at and after level 76?
---
 Also they could let us display power armor at a power armor station locking that station to not be able to store anything else. Resulting in having to build another station to repair your power armor?
---
I'm on PS4 and wanting a group to launch a nuke. DM me for my username.
---
Turns out that unmodded Bethesda textures are far from good enough to pay money for. 
---
legendary weapons can come with different configurations.
---
that would be interesting if that was the stuff for the 'enclave pvp' stuff, and that each faction had similar things that folks just haven't found yet.
---
Not the guy from whom you requested sources, but: The Hillbilly Hotdog place has a holotape police interview with a guy who describes the Flatwoods Monster ( a hovering, multicolored lightshow) and then describes it again when it got closer as clearly a zetan-style alien.
---
That's cool, better launcher than i thought. 
---
If anything its proof the economy is not fucked i have 3 characters all maxxed on caps i make money hand over fist and pick up toys to play with
---
Whenever I hit low steel, usually from ammo crafting, I just cap the munitions workshop and start grabbing and scrapping weapons for a session or two. That usually gets my ammo, steel and lead stockpiled for a little while.
---
Probably accurate
---
Oh this is news to me. 
---
asshat.
---
Ok. Notes and Holo gone. Thanks for the help. I only carry one outfit (spacesuit) and a miners helmet with the bright light. 
---
Talk about beating a dead horse.
---
Odd, I've done that one and didn't get it, I've done the full BoS line too
---
This is a good point, and I always go back to camp before I log off for the night. However you do not get to choose when and where the game decides to disconnect you from server or get a bluescreen.
---
no you can loot it at the dead witch event
---
Got it, thank you very much. 
---
How do you farm mutations?  Just by getting rads?
---
I‚Äôve got a ton of legendaries I don‚Äôt use too
---
That was called the [Safeguard program](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safeguard_Program).
---
Notable for actually building a giant truncated pyramid with an eye on the side.
---
r/fo76bazaar or r/market76
---
This assumes all attacks are equal.  Does dmg% or DR penetration or any other stat effect this perk?  Let Super Mutants shoot you 1000 times and see if it's any different.
---
In my house we obey the laws of thermodynamics!
---
Why is everyone SO negative about this game? 
---
I've been playing quite a bit and yeah it's a little buggy, but it's new! And holy cow they sure churned out quite a bit of content for being released relatively close to when 4 came out (compared to how long these giant games tend to take to build). 
---
There is a lot to do, especially if you explore everywhere and don't just run to Whitesprings and grind ad nauseam.
---
ESO had a slightly bumpy start too and it's been going pretty strong for a while. As a huge fan of Fallout I really want to see where it will go. 
---
Gonna feel left out if I don't join the mom club. 34yo here, level 52. Sometimes I play with my husband, sometimes I go solo. I have a big axe and I know how to use it!
---
Fashion Frame is endgame, is the saying in Warframe, Let us fashion our Vault dweller lol. (still dont know where i said that before about bags) I think it'd be cool if after the store is I guess "sorted" Bethesda opened a QnA page liek thing for us to submit ideas we'd love to see in the atomic Store. I'm not asking for TennoGen but yeah no, Bags Bethesda, Bags and hangy things :D
---
Those holotapes are quite disturbing.
---
Daisycutter is a quest specific Legendary, like All Rise, Perfect Storm, Bunker Buster, any legendary that has a custom name is quest specific guaranteed drop and is locked in its toll.   
---
lmao
---
^ THIS!!!!! ^
---
Just don't nuke Palace of the Winding Path. Someone nuked that, literally the only enemies that showed up there were for the meditation event, all super mutants. No glowing ones, no Scorched, at all.
---
I might do it today, I want to start making room for some of the unique weapons and armors that I've been tossing since I was low level. I want to transition into a small armory type stash, so I can switch between a couple of playstyles.
---
They are not a must have, but are fun to have.  Once I bought some plans to make my own serum and got two others from queens is when I started messing around with them. I will say I like the adrenal marsupial and speed demon. I also have electrified and unstable but have noticed you take a lot of damage if griefers find you. Granted I just pull out the two shotters and face rape them it is annoying if I am doing an event. 
---
&gt; 48% upvoted, which means the majority of people on this subreddit are either using automated tools to silence any criticism of Bethesda or are worried someone might hurt Bethesda's feelings.
---
You care too much about upvotes
---
Im always running pacifist, and many times Ive become wanted by accidentally hitting someones wall or workstations when trying to help defend against mobs.  Maybe theres a diff between workshops and camps though.
---
Pretty sure the fissure site in cranberry bog. Around the trees theres usually a lot of mutated ferns I think?
---
Use any shotgun with maxed ranges and enforcer, you'll cripple her wings fast
---
Did you know Mongrel Dogs are expert lock pickers? This is something I was not aware of coming back from a quick AFK. 
---
Yes and buying them
---
Yep, thats it.
---
This. At the games launch the mods here kept up a useless megathread of outdated info that was 6 months old! Judt useless speculation instead of providing actual info. Pathetic.
---
I just used a keypad on the outside and a normal switch inside. I have to turn both off to close it so it's not as convenient as your method, but it avoids the sit down animation for the terminal. 
---
Oh lame.  I assumed you could trade them and that is why the paints/atom stuff was so expencive cause it allowed players to "Craft" it for trade
---
I think you're blindly on the love train:
---
"Prioritized fixes" Korean localization for the atom shop while game breaking bugs still run rampant
---
"Started communication more often" they now have an intern update the punctuation and Grammer on the industrial purifiers thread every few days so it appears there is a communication update when there isn't, screenshots taken every day verify the edits.
---
I get that you love this game but you're not seeing the bigger pieces moving. Bethesda is now rushing the next elder scrolls for 2019 because they understand the shit situation they got themselves into. Their resources are going to go to elder scrolls they are officially in "saving face mode", they want to get away from this train wreck as fast as they can...
---
Yeah, when the game was first announced, and I read that there wouldn't be specific servers, I knew this would become a MASSIVE issue.  No permance = No consequences.  Full disclosure:  I love PvP.  But FO76 doesn't have PvP.  It just has some annoying system of trading one shot kills.  No skill, no engagement.  Just TSE&gt;Respawn.  Also, no reward/incentive to PvP.  As to the 'instance' based approach, it is epic fail.  Let's say I want to RP a trader and focus my time in the waste crafting.  How do I build a brand name with each login (or instance crash) I have to re-establish myself.  Same thing applies to PvP.  You come across a 'raider' going around destroying camps or what have you, all he does die once (after storing all his junk) and he/she can repeat the process with no lasting effects.  In Ye Olden Times of MMOs (and I know FO76 isn't a traditional MMO by any stretch), players developed reputations (good and bad) that preceeded them.  A sense of community developed.  No such thing exist to date in FO76.  Just my 2 caps.
---
I love getting ambushed outside Whitesprings and luring it into the robot staff.
---
Don't worry, Bethesda will do somethi- ahahahaha, sorry, I couldn't say that with a straight face. 
---
They won't do jack because as it is i'm sure at LEAST 20% of the playerbase dupes. As adamantly against duping as this sub is, you gotta realize there are only 4k people online right now. That's a MEAGER amount of the base. 
---
Regardless of the industries of the companies, 98 out of 100 ticket systems not created by a geek in a basement are very, very similar.  The task is identical regardless of the request.
---
Dupers are people, too! Who wants to join my underground club where we misguidedly try to rescue them from persecution?

Thanks,cool, May Jesus bless you

4. I've been having a issue with 76 with me spawning in, and becoming T-posed. I'm not able to move, I can fast travel and die, but those didn't fix it. All enemies are still as well, and I magically receive damage. 
---
I have tried switching characters, uninstall and reinstall the game, and validate the files. Nothing has worked so far, and I can't seem to find anything online about this, as far as I know.
---
Cranberry bog, you get violet flux from cranberries/diseased cranberries and mutated ferns, which are pretty much the only plants that grow there. The northwest part of the bog has plenty of plants but is relatively free of enemies
---
I think Harpers Ferry as well. The violet is around the perimeter of the city
---
&gt; Like 5 or 6 different area bosses that would reward you with those head on a plaque things from fo4 so you could display your kills in your camp.
---
Now that's a great fucking idea.
---
Queen event will nab you a couple usually and there's typically some in the Bog area there too
---
Several linings appear to be broken currently. Let me go find the thread discussing linings.
---
The knight one should be black.
---
The officer one is orange
---
Its tons of fun to spawn in at Whitesprings and get down to 10% health because you cant move or get in your power armor. 
---
I would add purchased mods dont get ate when crafting.. i lost about 10k caps worth of purchased modd due to them being ate as scrap when crafting.
---
Buddy of mine night before last lost his newly purchased xo1 jet pack when he was reparing aromor and was low on a material. Since he didnt have the flux to attaxch it immediately and was waiting for me to get online to borrow some.
---
sit in a puddle of dirty water until you get one.  if you don't want that one then hop in a decon shower.  Blackwater Mine is a good place for this too
---
Locking your doors and extractors are fine. I personally think locking water purifiers is a noob move, they regenerate and you can help out your fellow vaulties but allowing them to take water and who cares since they just repopulate and can only hold a few at a time or a max of 5. I laugh every time I find a camp with water purifiers locked.
---
What you could do is build a two story, leave your first floor unlocked so players can use your stations and have some private space above that is locked, I used to do this. 
---
Also what I do now, is I keep my door closed and locked when I am at my camp as I am probably AFK'ing, but when I leave camp, I leave my door open so people can use anything they want.
---
Rare mods like the jet pack and calibrated shocks require flux in order to attach to power armor. The people that are wrong here are the people telling this guy he‚Äôs wrong. I have x01 jet pack and 2 calibrated shocks and all three required farming stable flux in order to apply the mods to my armor. So no, mods are not necessarily an all in one package. I have played over 400 hours as well, since BETA. I literally just installed all these things so the info I‚Äôm sharing is 100% accurate. If you‚Äôre on Xbox I can sell you some flux, gt fermentedmilque. 
---
Never said it was original. Just layed it out in a practical way for it fit into the already established game mechanics and gave reasons for implementing it in a fun light hearted way. 
---
Around lvl 40, my noob friend was screaming as he was being chased. I made him run away from the fight as I had a ‚Äúyou shall not pass!‚Äù moment with it. It kicked my ass, but my super sledge flew up his.
---
Happened to me once change characters load in then relog your stuck character.
---
Why are you such a little bitch? 
---
I came across a Flatwoods Monster the other day.  He basically hit me once and then noped out of existence which was kind of a bummer.  But he was cool looking.  
---
I will be on later. I am on eastern time
---
# 8 is a must after having bad luck with the world eating some of my best stuff when I accidentally dropped it. 
---
The biggest wtf is who the fuck put tattoos on forehead? Fine, if they dont have to tech to do body paint but at least give us presets for various parts for a tattoo. Not like that's difficult to do at all. 
---
You may be joking but I might start doing this. Probably a better option than the "owo" that currently greets guests
---
Wrong. Rare mods require stable flux. 
---
I have my camp in the same place. I had this trouble as well. 2 things that worked for me 1) try fast traveling a second time. 2) try placing your camp device on a foundation. Also try moving the foundation/camp device different locations within build area (rotation too). It took me about an hour to finally get a good fast travel point. Worth it not having to fast travel twice each time tho. Good luck
---
To be honest, while it isn't the strongest, it is really fun. I am stuck with a pipe revolver rifle for a while
---
&gt; 16) Allow me to scrap legendary items. I don't care about that leather +14 damage resist from animals armband. Let me scrap it.
---
This would be great, especially if there was a small (say 10%) chance of learning that legendary effect so that you could mod other pieces of gear.
---
What platform if you still have it?
---
To shreds, you say?
---
It's why I make these ranty posts haha. idc if people hate what I have to say, its just a rant after all. it's nothing super seious but its true what we've said. basic hair should be 100 or 150 max, and hair that has lots going on or is a bit more 'out going' should be like 300 max.
---
Most posts will correctly state that mutations get removed at random.  You probably just stumbled on bad info.  This is the entire basis of setting up mutations perfectly being tedious.
---
I work for a big tech company on a product that was famously, laughably buggy for years. If we can turn it around, Bethesda can recover from this. I think you can read into this any way you want to. If you want to see the negatives, you will. Confirmation bias and all.
---
Meanwhile it's not helping to poo poo every positive thought with "waa some things have been bad". We get it. Gosh.
---
Ah, gotcha. I hadn't thought of doing that. Makes sense then. Absolutely agree too, if we can have beer bottles not autoscrap, certainly the mods should be the same.
---
Don‚Äôt want to be a downer, but I believe there will be no way to make the game airtight. Within an hour after each patch there will be a new method found. I believe part of this is because Bethesda is lazy and does band aid fixes and there are a lot of clever people. Also, the game engine is essentially Fallout 4, so really smart people have access to the inner workings, if you will. I don‚Äôt think duping completely disappears. 
---
With this, they should buff high level enemies some and any new enemies need to be more interactive if they're gonna have huge health pools
---
What system do you play on? My friend and I are on Xbox. We routinely patrol the wastes to dispense justice. 
---
Nothing feels better than showing up to some asshats destroying a lowbies base just for us to wreck with our own TSE weapons. 
---
On my other character, which is lvl 103, I have only saw a behemoth once. And it was at whitesprings
---
The way I was thinking was just have an option to shuffle the discs you put in or have it in a set order. So it can work for both styles of DJing/Enlightening the wasteland.
---
Sorry bud but you‚Äôre the guy that‚Äôs wrong telling other people they are wrong. You need stable flux to add rare mods to x01 power armor. I have 2 calibrated shocks and a jet pack and had to farm flux in order to attach. 
---
i came across my first 2 days ago on the road right outside the galleria in the mire
---
We did it, Reddit!
---
You can also buy a serum to get the mutation.
---
Good to know. I am going to start farming mutations as soon as I can get Class Freak.
---
Im a low life build. =)
---
wtf is a Paula Abdul
---
Because you need stable flux for things like calibrated shocks and the jet pack. 
---
Can we confirm that these were acquired by technical data mission?
---
Yeah, but those mini nukes are 6 a piece. I wonder if there's a perk to reduce their weight.
---
What mission are you talking about? 
---
Mine came with a MIRV
---
Finally someone on ps4. Everyone is xbox and pc here it seems
---
Not like these posts are proliferated in say - a video or a Reddit post so it's easy to miss it
---
I guess I might be wrong as to which one. I want the black outfit
---
Ah yes, this I have run into. I apparently can fabricate a Gauss Rifle from scratch, but lake the mental capacity to attach an extra jet on my Shiskabob. Perks are fun. 
---
My guess is that if Bethesda doesn't fix this, the modding community will, once and if we can mod on private servers. 
---
:D
---
Well, if I ever want to complete the "kill 76 wanted players" challenge, this is how I'll lay my trap.
---
I was in Flatwoods(lv 120)  and heard a little boy (lv 7)  say hello to some people (lv 15ish), and they told him to "F\*#\^ off" and he was like, "Oh...Ok". Then the mean guy was talking about how he was going to attack the kid to be a jerk. So I ran down the road and marsupial-jumped between them with my legendary shotgun and the mean guy immediately started kowtowing and apologized.. Then he ran away. I gave the young kid a bunch of ammo and fully modded a 10mm pistol for him. He was very polite.
---
I shot him like 6 times, he stayed still and died. Boring. Most likely bugged like the rest of that garbage game.
---
Mobs can supposedly open locked doors, they just ignored, probably a bug, but at least a few people have mentioned it, actually the main reason why I started locking and then WTF ...
---
Take this upvote.  I run around with a game friendly playlist of my own and put on my radio dj voice or play on an acoustic guitar when I'm at my camp. 
---
I agree. I'd like for the game to be a bit harder in general. I routinely kill level 90+ Glowing Deathclaws in Whitesprings with a Super Sledge, despite having no points in Slugger or Martial Artist; the game is too damn easy.
---
From what I've gathered, Bethesda scaled enemy difficulty the way they've always done -- increased Damage Resistance, and a marginal increase in Health. This basically means combat never gets more difficult, it just takes longer to kill things (ie: bullet sponges).
---
What outfit are you wearing? 
---
I know that feeling all to well... 
---
What platform are you on? If on xbox I can run you through the queen. Sounds like no one was doing enough dps to make a sent in her health. TSE weapons are freat but you need the perks to support it to increase damage.
---
thats probably true judging by the other hair's pirces next to that one xD '600' &amp; '500'
---
pretty sure the cranbwerries are crimson. but yes tons of mutated fern for violet around prime.
---
&gt;ea
---
Its very obvious there's a large amount of Bethesda fanboys who will not tolerate any criticism of this game.
---
I don't really care about upvotes except it was very interesting to see posts talking about many common issues of the game be so popular in the controversial view of this subreddit.
---
Have you seen a straight jacket? You get heavy duty cloth, some solid straps, and buckles! Much more useful than a golf polo.
---
This happens a lot. I've also noticed that when in a team, if we all fast travel, my teammates frequently appear in their underwear or they are just invisible and stay that way until fast travelling or entering a building, etc.
---
I'm quite disappointed in the Artillery (I've removed it from my C.A.M.P.).  The range is so weak.  I'd like it to reach most (if not all) the map.  You can have the Vertibots reach more limited areas (tied to the workshops they spawn from).  A real world comparison would be a 155mm with between 25-30km range.  Just my 2 caps.
---
actaully true. take my money
---
If you have the Chemist and Super Duper perks, you can make a bunch quickly if you go out and kill some ticks.
---
The camp box itself seems to be a secondary spawn point. I'll usually spawn on the North side of my camp, and a friend fast traveling to me usually ends up at the camp box.
---
Remove ‚ÄúWouldn‚Äôt it Be Nice‚Äù? Get the hell outta here. 
---
Ur damage just isn't high enough. So you either need more people or better gear/perks.
---
It is randomly acquired. And randomly removed with Radaway 
---
Considering shit like this exists nothing surprises me any more (Different pricing for same product sold to different customers). https://vimeo.com/154271693?fbclid=IwAR26W9s5As8ocLoUiZBR_WkFjBIDw6yxDcuda7jKQpsWXokulDvhlhWfums
---
Honestly its zero effort work for them for those hair styles, even if they sell a few thousands of them. Also they could even want you to think to yourself after looking at that price: "this isn't worth it, but look at this other skin that's much more awesome and basicaly the same price.. hmm".
---
Idk, there's stuff there that are IMO worth the price and I'm glad I bought them like the Northern lights (it was just from doing daily/weekly challenges), but there's also some absolute garbage in there that should never have been sold for atoms in the first place.
---
it's the b/B that differentiates bit from byte... what would be the difference between M/m?
---
It works 
---
Nuke the prime site.  After you get done with the queen, check the areas around trees for fern bushes (yes, check all the patches of trees).  Make sure you have Green Thumb on for double gather.  If you need more glowing mass, high radiation fluids, or hardened mass, have a friend quit the game and rejoin you to respawn the smaller enemies (he must be spawning back in the nuke zone, preferrably somewhere in the middle).
---
Toxic Valley is pretty good. If you don't want to have to deal with many mobs. Though there are some, enough to get a few Hardened Mass.
---
Probably not. As I said, models would need to be remade to meet style requirements, textures as well to meet quality requirements, it would probably be easier to do them over rather than reuse.
---
I managed 12 violets from a queen zone. Flash ferns and the pitcher plants are rather plentiful. Just make sure you check the smaller 2-3 tree clusters those are the ones with the ferns. 
---
Can you please tell where in the northwest exactly?
---
Cant help that you are wrong. Ill make a video later for proof.
---
Lol, I feel that pain. 
---
I remember all these exact posts from "industry insiders" a la Mass Effect: Andromeda... We know how that turned out üëç
---
B R A V E G A M E R S R I S E U P !
---
I don't think that mod exists for excavator. 
---
Completely unrelated not but why do 10 artillery grenades keep appearing in my stash whenever I decide to my Artillery Cannons? 
---
They need to make pvp not pointless and plain old bad and increase player count per map OR start adding npcs and life to the map. The game is in this in between state so far where the map is empty of players and npcs and there is no reason to interact with the players so what is there to do once you get bored of wandering around?
---
I'd love saved perk loadouts AND this :)
---
Can't tell you how many time I've run around doing things with Super Duper and Ammosmith still on because I didn't see them....lol
---
A pack of skins maybe but $20 for a single, gimmicky outfit? 
---
That's too much. That's more than a lot of fully fleshed out DLCs. Hell, that's the same price Dawngard cost when it came out.
---
I‚Äôve been sitting on a event similar to a nuke where instead of blowing up an area you can call a brotherhood blimp that travel across the wasteland dropping goodies and if you are factioned with the brotherhood your duty is to secure packages dropped and protect them from other players
---
Only thing left where foundations. I was curious what would happen when 10 artillery cannons where fired off. Each does 4 shots.
---
Good luck, kid. Expect very little of this. 
---
Not sure why this sub needs to foster this childish "gimme this, gimme that" mentality. But, hey, if you think a couple upvotes will make someone at Bethesda say, "Wow, we really fucked up! Let's just implement all of this random guys ideas!," then more power to ya.
---
No but armour with lifesaver on it does
---
Yeah I learned that the hard way, I just haven‚Äôt been able to find a better place 
---
Odd that there weren't any glowing ones. I've only been to two "off the beaten path" nuke zones but both had glowing ones. I'm thinking a distant fissure site. I've discovered all of them I'm pretty sure.
---
Because it's in the artillerys inventory
---
So my understanding of what people do for end game PVP.
---
 imo this game should be a PVE only game but the reality is it's not so PVp peers want something to do 
---
 So to instigate people into pvping them what they do is attack bases because let's admit it being an asshole and destroying a base can be extremely satisfying and fun for a PvP but only for so long.
---
 What they do is rack up a bounty this lets other people know they are available and can be killed for thousands of caps a very rich reward.
---
 They want people to come for them so you can blast them away with their op weapons and armor one shotting them and having PVP fun.  
---
 This is not wrong of them it's the mechanics and design of the game to which is best suited for PVP which is what they want.
---
 PVP Mechanics for this game are not well thought-out and honestly should not even be an option.
---
 How I would have designed the system is you have to flag for PVP or PVE on your character once flagged you cannot unflag it cannot be reversed you have to commit to a PVP character or a PVE character. Very similar to a Diablo 3 hardcore or normal core character creation.
---
 When you flag for PVP enteting a server you will join a PVP server and only a PVP server which is full-on PVP full loot full coin kill the only thing safe is in your stash.
---
 It could make it so it's Queen and junk dropped only weapons and armor don't drop that just take damaged or something silly like that the point being they should completely separate PVP and PVE. Enter enter 
---
 Now I've a mention that there shouldn't be PVP and the reason for that is it's extremely difficult to balance PvP with PVE. To do so requires separate gear sets separate armor separate weapon separate stats everything must be separate.
---
 you're basically creating two separate game system which requires additional developer resources which regardless of how you cut it takes away from the PVE experience this is why I'm against both PVP and PVE in a game
---
it's extremely difficult extremely costly to do correctly and is completely unneeded when you can have PVP game and a whole separate PVE game
---
Funny pic man! Also that outfit is badass. Where did you get it?
---
And double infuriated that I CANT SELL THEM BACK TO THE GODDAMN VENDOR.
---
People will show up, it's pretty much the only "end game" left and the loot is good.
---
The survivors are in hiding until the scorched are killed off. Are you doing your part to end the scorched plague? 
---
Multiple thoughts here. First I agree with 90% of what you're saying.
---
The Executioner Radium Rifle is awesome because the "Executioner" part is that it deals explosive damage. So you're really getting three damage types out of it. Ballistic, Radiation, and Explosive..... The only down side of it being that if you're not in PA (or don't have a armor piece that auto heals you) it can be super dangerous in close range as it's easy to blow yourself up.
---
I have seen an executioner laser rifle (or pistol, don't remember) that my friend had, but haven't seen it other than that. I do agree with the legendaries though, I only seem to ever see legendary armor pieces and melee weapons.... and I'm a scout/rifle build.... so I don't use melee
---
Charging for cosmetics has been around forever.  Team Fortress 2 was doing it back in 2009 with ‚Äúhats‚Äù. 
---
Exactly, thats still considered obtaining it yourself.
---
i doubt they'd ever implement it, but i wish we got a choice at the end of a quest of the reward that we want.
---
I was near Top of the World, and a guy ran past me, getting chased by high level Super Mutants.  I helped him beat them down, but he went unconscious and called for help.  There were still a couple of SMs to kill, and I didn't want to get murdered while trying to revive him, so I focused on killing them first.   Besides, he could always come back and get his stuff if he died.
---
I didn't quite have time to get to him before the 30 second timer expired, so I waited by his stuff, guarding it for him.  But he never came back, he must have assumed that I deliberately let him die so I could take his stuff.  But I never did.  Eventually I ran off, and I hope he went back and found his paper bag, unmolested.
---
I took mine out too.. not that it was taking much space but that It wasn't worth it to me to carry the smoke grenades =/
---
It's a really cool feature but yeah.. I don't see the point in limiting the range.  I suppose you could claim a bunch of workshop and place them all over but that's probably not worth it either. 
---
If you can get Two Shot Explosive, pack points into both the gun damage and explosive damage.  They both will scale with Two Shot Explosive.
---
It also helps if you have melee guys with Bloodied or Furious weapons maxed out as well.
---
My fiance and I were playing together last night and noticed a few new players at the vault so we headed over to drop off appropriate level but high damage weapons, water, stims, etc. We wished their was a gift emote because it took them all so long to figure out the paper bag was full of goodies and not just random trash in the world. When some of them realized they jumped for joy literally. We left with a thumbs up and a wave and ran away.

Like always for anything, GO BACK TO THE STORE YOU BOUGHT IT AT.
---
My EB Games in Canada still has Power Armour Editions laying in the back because they are too huge to keep on the floor.
---
Contact your EB Games district manager ASAP, they will usually ship one in from another store if they do not have one to replace at your location.
---
Honestly, no idea why you did not do this from the start.  Like I said this is the case for ANYTHING.  Buy a new phone at Best Buy and it does not work, go back do not call Apple.
---
I replied back to my unanswered ticket along for confirmation that it was approved, still nothing. Hopefully I'll get the confirmation sooner than later.
---
I would say they are the most important part cards of the game there will never be a character I create that does not have mutations
---
Sun kissed works fine.. as long as it's daytime.
---
Haha do they talk with their mouth full?
---
Where is the metal cage outfit? I see all the raiders wearing it. 
---
I made a minimalist adhesive farm with molerat proof crafting area.
---
Add Counterpointa on PSN and leave a note stating you're from the association!
---
Exactly. I can one shot the level 91 Emmett disposal deathclaw pretty much every time. The only difficult thing in the game is killing the queen FAST ENOUGH. Which just isn't fun considering how people aren't there for the experience of killing the queen, the xp, or the fun of the nuke zone, it's just for a chance at specific loot and maybe something that isn't a nocturnal stalkers lead pipe. Sure you can go around doing quests and getting plans for your house n such as well ass abusing strange in numbers to become essentially God but late game is so incredibly dry and who knows how much they **actually** have ready in the next 6 months.
---
The ones you find at uncanny caverns are a little creepy as well
---
I had a pet Snally Gaster that lived in my camp &amp; after her I had a Pet Mirelurk Hunter. Which got killed :'(
---
lol. Feel free to visit mine.
---
It's Motel 76 and I've left the lanterns on for ya.
---
Genuine question: are you expecting Lucky Break to keep your armor at full? Its purpose is to slow armor degradation, not to negate armor degradation entirely.
---
A good test would be to do the same thing without Lucky Break and see how quickly it goes down. 
---
Yes but for special card points
---
Imo, it is proly a multiplicative formula so the incoming limb damage is set to 0, and anything times 0 is still 0. Would need testing but this is how I would program it.
---
I used to work in 3D graphics. I totally understand that it's an insane amount of work. I don't need convincing on that front! üòä
---
But I'm sure that SOMETHING from their old assets, even if it's just some of the stuff from concept art, level design, random scripts, or something, is definitely usable. I'm sure someone there wants to revisit it and I'm sure they have ideas.
---
Who‚Äôs Matt Black? 
---
JK, but for real, I‚Äôd like one in Jeff Blue.
---
Alright, that‚Äôs enough, I‚Äôll stop Horaceing around now.
---
Funny enough, keep your eyes out for a double or quad one.  The reload glitch then works in your favor

---
Given how many issues this game has and how many quality of life improvements are needed, it really should updated to a new thread more regularly.  Every 2 weeks would be best.
---
They already have them. It‚Äôs the first object in the last building tab to the right. Think it‚Äôs ‚Äúmiscellaneous‚Äù but I could be wrong. You can place them at your camp and workshops. 
---
I think it depends a lot on the areas you're exploring. If you're going through the factories, the mines, the various buildings, pretty much everything in them scraps to steel. If you're venturing out in the world more, you tend to get more glass, wood, etc. I'm currently a little low on wood, just because I've been making so many teas, roasts and other cooking items. 
---
I use it.. it definitely heals you.. just only up to the point your rads are at.  It's not nearly as helpful as a teammate having rad sponge.  Or sharing rank 1 rad sponge.
---
This isnt an unpopular opinion, this is simply against the rules in the subreddit (promoting exploits)
---
Try teaming up in the zone.  If you can get someone to friend you, it's easy to get back in the same server.  Double benefit is it respawns the enemies.
---
If that doesn't work, write down a bunch of names of people in the zone.  You can sometimes join off of them from your RECENT list.
---
&gt; I don't really care about upvotes
---
Yeah ya do.
---
I have all of those except electrical 
---
that's the tatical marine hat and the hunters coat.

Whats a point of that junk with 600 weight stash

 /cry
---
My camp has a public area with water, croos, work benchs, power armor station, beds, instruments...etc. Then i have my private quarters with only keypad entry.
---
Im in the ash heap so i get a lot of folks passing by doing the excavator suit mission. Most people are curious to check out my camp set up (basement garden, epic views on the 3rd floor deck) and not a single person has attacked me or destroyed my base. 
---
Any "Furious" Fist weapons/unarmed?   
---
Knuckles, boxing glove, death tambo, Mole Miner Gauntlet or power fists of any kind?
---
Just to try and get some visibility for this, I don't believe ultracite gatling lasers can spawn as legendaries either! I would greatly appreciate if you could update your post and represent us energy weapon lovers :) 
---
When are you launching? I‚Äôm in game now but can‚Äôt stay for long 
---
I don‚Äôt really have much experience with games quite like this. I only dabble with F076 because it‚Äôs frustratingly buggy. I‚Äôve never seen any player wrecking house in a nuke zone. I could see that happening I guess but that particular issue isn‚Äôt going to be so common that it ruins your game. I could see duping a crazy amount of items ruining the server stability. 
---
If all of your points are valid then it sounds like this game has absolutely no future. It‚Äôs frustrating but I have no sympathy for this development team or the publisher after dropping a screw job like this. It‚Äôs the worst I‚Äôve seen in my 15 years of online console gaming. 
---
Ah well, I'm on Xbox, thanks for the offer though
---
Because this is the definition of predatory practices in games to make you want it, from only being available for a limited time or the fake sales that the holiday stuff had that MAGICALLY got removed.
---
If I play long enough I have a server to myself.
---
Nope! Adamantium skeleton completely protects you from limb damage, regardless of disease. I've had it for awhile now and caught bone worms sever times. Never broken a limb since I equipped lvl 3 of that perk. 
---
Added it to the disease list I don't even bother to cure. 
---
Its not just the energy weapons that suck. If you ask me, almost every heavy weapon is terrible as well with the only exception being the Gatling Gun. The only way to make them good is by having a legendary with Two Shot and/or Exploding on them but even then most of them still don't come close to the damage of a Gatling Gun and you are still wasting a lot of ammo on a weapon that breaks incredibly fast. 
---
The energy heavy weapons are probably the worst since they also break much faster then ballistic heavy weapons. I have a legendary Gatling Plasma that breaks after 1-2 cores of firing. It seems to break even faster when you put a beam splitter on it. 
---
The Atomic Store honestly just confuses me so much lol. I imagine its all test items and they are testing the waters to see where feels right but atm. I'm hella confused lol
---
IT JUST WORKS!
---
If your interested in forming a small army. I specialize in the assasinos
---
I have not personally seen a weight reduction legendary effect on a rifle before, but others have said it's possible.
---
i have a level 0 lock on my door to keep out the occasional scorched that wanders by. I also built a nook where you can easily jump in (but should keep out mobs) and have vault boy cutouts pointing the way from my front door. Unlocked purifier. 
---
I remember a time or two when i was over-encumbered with broken weapons and desperately searching for a workbench when i came across a friendly camp. I try to pass that on. 
---
those bags can eventually despawn too.
---
whyin the fuck does it scrap mods?
---
Does it do this for anything else? Stored Weapons? Stored Armor? Anything?
---
Don't know, this is just one test, yeah it needs to be tested against different levels of enemies and maybe damage types.
---
This is what I saw that I was saving caps for. Bough the blackbird when it came out instead. 
---
Oh yeah I was there for that haha. I did so much trading in the tf2economy. But I was talking more  about timed cosmetics. Fortnite has popularized it and made it so you are pressured into buying a particular skin before it gets put back on rotation. 
---
Some other games have probably tried something similar though but fortnite is the most  successful that I‚Äôve seen. 
---
It is given as and end reward for completing all the brotherhood quests. Complete suit and core included. I wasnt aware there were even plans for that. You sure its ultracite power armor?
---
Yes. My Life saver leather armor chestpiece is a godsend. Best piece of gear I've ever gotten.
---
This. Skipping over stuff or whole areas? My buddy has had too much to do endlessly and he just hit 40. Still working the mire with 50% done there. He started in the forest, hit the area to the north, then ash heap, savage divide, now the mire. Already completed the BoS and most of the Enclave quests (commendations). 
---
Never stuck at 20. 
---
Tank killer only effects rifles, the heavy weapons you mention are governed by stabilized in INT as far as penetration. Other than that whoever spawns the queen in should be the lowest level as this gives her base stats (read this on the sub not 100% if it is true), someone wasn't pulling their weight / not enough dps / people in quest zone additionally buff the queen could contribute to the fail. 
---
I just go to whitesprings and farm ghouls since basically all they drop is junk I get everything I need
---
Well it's clearly not working on a large amount of the player base... it's gonna bite them in the butt again
---
ADDENDUM: Our scoring is based entirely on Caps. By allowing the WEHA to evaluate your CAMP, you agree to come back to this post and post your score, even if you disagree. 
---
M is mega m is milli
---
Except you cannot scrap ammo for gunpowder/lead/steel???? -\_\_-
---
They pin it to their social media so its always the first post, I think thats how theyll be mainly spreading info
---
I dont disagree with you on any particular point, but at this point I'm starting to cheer for the dupers to be honest. Bethesda's "fix" has been to simply change the number of items you can/need to craft. If that's all the effort they are putting into stopping it, then they could at least be doing it two or three times as often.
---
It honestly reminds me of playing hide and seek with my nephew who keeps hiding in the same spot, while saying he wont hide there next time. 
---
Unfortunately other publishers are going to chase that model with games that don‚Äôt really fit the mold. The game is really fun at times but it‚Äôs completely empty, kinda like doing cocaine. It‚Äôs fun in the moment but once it‚Äôs over you have no sense of accomplishment or satisfaction. 
---
Right you are Ken. Blast berries are crimson flux. There a ton of ferns however if you nuke directly on prime.
---
Yeah I've gotten the plans off of the SBQ, but never seen an actual set of it for me to take. Guess I missed it :/
---
Because it deals ballistic damage, energy damage is whats fucked. It's sad because energy weapons are a staple of Fallout like power armor is.
---
Don't farm mutations at Emmet Mountain.  You have to fight enemies every time you re-log for a new mutation.
---
1 - Get a decon shower plan.  If you can't find one on FO76 Bazzar or FO76 Market reddits, see if you can get a friend who has it to build one in your base (you can build in eachother's base when teamed).
---
2 - Move your base to toxic valley with your decon shower.  Find a spot that's NOT near enemy spawns and has several radiation steam vents nearby.
---
3 - Farm your mutations in peace, easy money.  If you get a mutation you don't want, use DILUTED radaway for a better chance to pull just 1 mutation off.
---
4 - If you're not going for all the mutations, go for 3-5 you want MAX before you stop and start buying serums on the FO76 Bazzar or FO76 Market reddit.
---
5 - Profit :)  Hope that helps!
---
I have suppressors Death Tambo
---
Youtubers...
---
Stealth doesn't work with SB in the normal way. You have to hide yourself from its line of sight. 
---
learning the plan is the same thing as having the mod as long as you have the materials, isn't it?
---
So I learn a plan for a scope for my rifle and I have the materials needed but then also have a mod in my inventory. That's the same thing. Either way, i have it two ways, so it should put at least one scope on the rifle.
---
Looks awesome! I'll have to find them 
---
I'm always down to hang out with folks using mics. Ign stonekraken. Lvl 80something.
---
If that paint was available on X-01 like all the other Atom paints are, I would have bought it in a heartbeat. Not switching to T-51b for a paint though.
---
It is the strategy of trying to make an exploit well known so that it will be fixed faster. This *can* work, sometimes, but in this case Bethesda was like "Ha, you think we care about dupes and exploits, pfft. We'll get to it when we get to it...*IF* we get to it."
---
Can just imagine a Trello with the work going on with the game, would help a lot with the repeated bug reports.
---
this, how do people not know this still
---
Mine crashes more now since the update when I scrap guns or scroll lists.
---
Try do a hard reset and clear your cache, else that sucks ..
---
That was me I think! I'm on PC and dropped them earlier as I did a big clear out of Stuff. I couldn't sell them so choose to drop them near a busy area. 
---
They move around too much. I need a target that just remains stationary 
---
There is no mission for getting in there yet. It's not an open access space yet, I glitched into it.
---
I feel like a bad ass for one trigger pull of my salvaged assaulting head, then its onto the scrap heap
---
Thanks for the reply, this is such a minor mod, just an edited audio FX file, but I was concerned as I'd read about Bethesda possibly coming down on modified files in FO76.
---
If you got a bounty by accident and want it to go away, go stand in whitespring and not your base.
---
I put my extra stuff in the mailbox, newspaper box, cigarette stands outside the train stations. All kinds of good stuff I can no longer carry (ammo, stims, legendary items). 
---
If 76 players could organize a real and effective boycott, that would be the one thing that would light a fire under their asses. 
---
But Bethesda would probably be stoked "Sweet! A week off!"
---
what does a millibyte look like?  do computers have a concept of a millibyte??!  Like one millionth of a byte?
---
I have encountered them twice, both times in the middle of nowhere, I am suddenly in \[Danger}, but can't find an enemy, and stay that way for a while, when a Stalking Mothman suddenly appears, and we fight, but then he disappears just as he's about to Die.
---
Haven't seen one since getting good Explosive weapons, so I have a big surprise for him next time he stalks me.
---
Wood armor has a shrouded upgrade for it. It's like shadowed and lightweight together. And you move faster while stealthed. A lot faster. 
---
look around areas with trees.
---
Of course, so still unusable in many situations.
---
Two shot 50 cal. no expo needed.   
---
This was my build last night in which I did 80% of the damage as there were only 2 players above level 40 and I was one the other was using a basic gauss, or at the least not two shot nor expo.   
---

---
It took 26 minutes to kill her. And I went through all of my two shot 1 star 50 cals which is 7 and I had to go to my back up two shot expo gatling which was nearly broken when she died.   
---
I am nowhere near min/max and had I swapped my points around it would have been easier. But I like to carry stuff.   
---
In 1400 rounds of 50 cal if you didn't take away 3 stars worth of damage you got yourself the wrong gun and you need a two shotter. Also make sure you have stabilized in INT it is mandatory, one gun army is helpful for SBQ but not so demanding if others hare cripplers.   
---
My first 3 legendaries that dropped were two shotters, in fact just gave away my 3 star two shot combat rifle that was my very first legendary. I found the 50 cal and this was at the hype of hand mades and expos so I was able to buy play 1 stars for 100-500 caps each and I bought a lot of them.   
---
Not sure what the non expos are selling for but they shred.   
---
Good hunting and sorry for your failed it happens, and it happens a lot when you can not carry the hazmat wearing level 20s 10-14 around being little useless leaches won't even help to distract the mobs and just let the guys doing damage die . Want to make sure you win have at least 6 two shot 50 cals on you and 20k in ammo. 
---
Crafting stations query your inventory of items before opening the crafting menu. Try with an empty inventory and also be nakid / no weapon equipped. Fixed? If so, something in your inventory is glitching the bench. Add/remove to find the offending item or stack of items.
---
Probably due to the reasoning you provided, it's kinda asinine.
---
Even if they did create the app you do not *have* to use your phone. You can simply not use the app. They aren't asking to make all controls be moved to the app.
---
Simply not being interested in the app is one thing, not wanting it released because you think you will be *forced* to do something is another.¬†
---
ty, not sure how I got that mixed up
---
Ahh. Well it wasn't a set to take it was just a chassis that was included in Item Rewards when I finished the last quest. So much for my plans to sell it at a high price! 
---
Shhhh, calm down. Your parents basement isn't going anywhere. Calm down.
---
How would I find a wanted persons CAMP?
---
Good afternoon, I would like you to evaluate my camp I built a beautiful estate with a garage and a small farm.
---
I know you didn‚Äôt mean anything negative by it, but my clan has plenty of women in it and the ‚Äúa grown woman gamer?‚Äù comment that is invariably the first thing out of everyone‚Äôs mouth is the reason they never, ever unmute their mics. It‚Äôs the adult gaming version of ‚ÄúHey everyone, [points] that person is different! Let‚Äôs all stare!‚Äù
---
They're really nice, especially marsupial, speed demon, healing factor (musts for all builds).
---
I left my mic on and now people know I can f**k.
---
Just kidding.  That was just the first thought that came to mind.  That did happen to a friend of mine once, though, but not with this game.
---
Since I started playing, I haven't bothered trying to get a mic working, so no voice.
---
The other night, had a player come across me while walking around Watoga, looking for the odd legendary 'bot.  He greeted me, and asked me "Whoa, where'd you get that collar?" (was wearing a Prisoner Collar; found in Eastern Regional Penitentiary).
---
With no way to communicate such with emotes, I decided to just high-tail it out of there ... I guess he wasn't used to seeing someone with the Speed Demon mutation, because the last things I heard him say before I was out of range were "Hey, wait up!" and "Damn, you're fast!"
---
After that interaction, I decided to dig out an old USB webcam of mine that has an integrated mic, and get it set up.  I'm no longer mute, so hopefully won't *have* to be so rude anymore ... I can just be rude when I *feel* like it. :)
---
I absolutely hate that they tied weapon and armor durability perks into the crafting cards. It makes no sense at all. 
---
As it is we have to swap cards in and out for crafting vs fighting. I agree 100% that durability should be tied to the specific gun cards. Not crafting. 
---
I really hope one day they give us quick presents but they really need to reevaluate the perks. 
---
Why are there two cards for making stimpacks and rad away more effective. Those should have been together as well. 
---
Thanks for confirming this one works, I have nothing else changed from my default install of FO76 and have run Verification several times, I think i'll try this one, I love the Super Sledge for farming shotgun shells from Scorched as zero ammo cost, but the noise is obnoxious. Cheers!
---
...for fucks sake, I'm not blaming the players, it's still Bethesda's fault these people are able to do what they do, which is kind of the whole point of starting this thread with asking if they fixed it.
---
When you can look at the map and see no nukes, no big group around Whitesprings, and one cluster of 2-4 people not near any major location while you're having intermittent connection issues, it's pretty consistently people fucking with the servers that's the cause.
---
Either you're trying to defend dupers or you are way off base with your assumptions of what I think about this game's server issues.
---
Because when you‚Äôre fighting a scorchqueen or a country club full of glowing zombies no one pays attention to team invites. It‚Äôs not like I didn‚Äôt know this, it‚Äôs just shouldn‚Äôt have to be done that way. Writing down names is a good idea tho. 
---
My two shot fat man enjoys whenever a wanted person is at their base.
---
Just be careful though, usually the wanted person will die during the attack and any shells in the air that land after the death will make you wanted, ha. So don't carry any junk on you!
---
&gt;heavy duty cloth
---
Mmhmm
---
&gt;solid straps
---
That's also useful
---
&gt;and buckles!

Yup I'm wearing Marine Wetsuit (upgraded), Marine tactical Helm and the hunter's long coat. For sure it's the coolest look I've put together! 
---
If ur on XB1, I can sell you the plans for the tactical helm, build you a wetsuit (not needed for this look but still bad ass) and sell you another hunter's long coat. Then you can equip it all and we can take a pic looking all bad ass!
---
 &gt;So what do you guys think?
---
idgaf
---
Each time it fired I checked my armor pieces to see if any showed a noticeable increase, but they didn't increase enough for me to tell. Maybe 10% armor health improvement?
---
Most of them already are in strength. There's already like 20 points worth of weight reduction perks in strength.
---
The explosives weight reduction perk reduces their weight, as well as ammo weight reduction legendary armor. 
---
Why? It‚Äôs f2p , they aren‚Äôt getting much more out of us so I kinda doubt they will pay us much attention 
---
Bos vendor for me
---
Still pretty well defended. I'm rarely in any panic while out of PA. 
---
Wait you can have animals?
---
Get in the back of the line. J47 has been waoting forever.
---
It's like half the weapons in this game are bugged.
---
Usually it's parties through discord. We are still working it out, but I see your part of the assassin style gameplay. Wana join? 
---
Please do. 
---
The prefix milli is 10^-3. So essentially 100 millibytes (I don't think there is a thing) would translate to 100 * 10^-3 bytes or 0.1 bytes. 
---
This happened to me last night. I have a medics dragon. I switched to it and it had 50+ rounds in it's "magazine". Was firing semi auto as fast as a combat rifle. I had just killed the sbq in a group and didn't bother with it because of the reload time. Once I realized it was bugged I was moving down scorched beasts. 
---
I switched back later on and it 90+ of my 120 or so ammo again. I'm interested to see if it will still be bugged when I log in today.
---
They are explosives, right? And there is a perk for it. Something...train.  
---
Not that it saves POS game life Fallout 76 :)
---
They're fine. But I'm thinking from a more multiplayer angle.
---
Texas hold 'em with Big Iron playing in the background. Texas Red is coming
---
It's not just energy weapons, but in my opinion, a few weapon categories are overshadowed by either certain options just being plain better, or they're overall just a terrible choice of weapons.
---
Handguns in particular seem a little on the lackluster side, but I can see some application to it.  Unarmed is arguably just an inferior version of melee with fewer options.  And I think some heavy weapons are just really bad compared to others.
---
Energy weapons in particular are disappointing because you need a series of perks to really start crafting and modifying them, and it borders almost on this end-game sort of requirements.  On top of that, you can gain the ability to craft them early, but early on you won't be finding any energy weapons at all.  They're in higher-leveled areas due east past the Savage Divide, so there's no point trying to invest in them when they're so rare until you make the jump to the mountains, but even then, plans are not common.
---
If you actually do get your hands on something like a laser gun and can craft it, you'll really just find it's at best, maybe a slightly better assault rifle.  With sniper barrels, it can deal a little higher, but sniper barrels are awful, they have that awful 3-tick charge system, before you can deal full damage, and it takes like 3 seconds to reach full charge, if you fire before that, I believe you're doing considerably less damage.
---
Plasma guns have a rare ammunition type, and they deal both ballistic and energy weapon damage, but they have travel time unlike other weapons, and the damage they do isn't really that much better than say a hardened combat rifle with a perforating magazine.  Again, same problems as the laser gun, you won't find these early, and by the time they do get found, there are better options.
---
I think the tesla gun is the only energy weapon I've found that isn't complete crap, but I need to find plans to really try it more.  I found one that had a lobbing barrel, which statistically does the highest microfusion damage I believe, but I'm not sure how the other barrels fare, since lobbing is hard to use.
---
Most wanted players will go hide in their camps.
---
Right on, lady. 36 y/o woman here, also with a full time job and have poured hours into the wasteland. Such fun and always eager to get back out there. 
---
Keep those woods. Add the shrouded mod to them and give them a try. You'd be surprised. 
---
Not sure if those are the ones I am missing but next time I see cabinets at the Ferry vender I will try and press my luck. 
---
Uhm.. no. Like 3-4.
---
Just stop already dude lmao you change up your reasoning like every 10 minutes
---
Precisely. It's what I meant by "Perk Card Bloat" -- too many niche Perk Cards that should logically be tied into other Perks. It's clear a lot of the Perk Cards look good on paper, but make very little sense in application. Especially since any weapon type is going to take at least 9 points of a tree to maximize it's efficacy (usually 12, though). This doesn't leave much wiggle-room for utility in a build.

Hilarious - until the 600th time you hear it when you log in. :D

Rifles have an armor pen, I'll take the more multiplier from adrenal reaction and bloodied.

fissure prime is a good place, so is the grafton area as Fern Flowers become Flash Ferns which grant violet flux.  Just be carefule as IDK what happens to Grafton Monsters in a nuke zone
---
Buying things for video games is weird to me but I can accept that people do it. Buying things for this game is extra weird because caps are mostly just for fast travel and getting a tse weapon basically puts the game on baby/easy mode. Whatever I guess...
---
PS: Anyone want to pay me to play their games for them? /s
---
 Oh yeah, rocket baseball bat and PA was my setup until I got All Rise. Note I bathe in the blood and guts of my enemies. My buddy is upset I can stand in front of a pack of 10 super mutants and use maybe 1 or 2 stims max before they all die. It's the assault rifle guys that get you hardest. 
---
Free States could retake Harper's Ferry, since a lot of their members originally set up shop there.
---
Maybe Responders could somehow combine Flatwoods and the Vault Tec Agricultural Research Center.
---
I haven't checked hairstyles, but a lot of items like armor paint jobs and outfits do show multiple pictures from different angles. You have to click the item to see its description, then the enlarged image on the left will sometimes have a right arrow to scroll through the various images.
---
Ooh damn. I bet I got it back during that PA glitch where I couldn't wear any and just moved past it right away. So it won't spawn anywhere after that huh?
---
IIRC, the only people to use it in FO1 were in full PA. At least, that's what I read. So it's odd you can't use it in PA. 
---
Yes, that's three-week old news.
---
Your defense is laziness? You had to post on reddit to whine about this knowing there's an easy solution already in the game? That's pretty weak dude
---
Right, like im a "fan" of lite microtransactions, ill buy a loot box sure. But buying duped materials from a third party source? Yikes.
---
So it works for Gatling?!
---
I'm just not a fan of low health builds. I like to have some survivability. :D
---
Truth. And the metrics aren't public like they are with Steamcharts. 
---
Healing factor is poop, works outside combat only, reduces your stimpaks effectiveness.
---
I've killed a glowing moth man and a vengeful mothman
---
That's beautiful *wipes away tear*
---
Damage is from rifleman but it‚Äôs crafted and modded with energy crafting perks.
---
You won‚Äôt encounter it until later in the game IMO.  I started as a ballistic rifle stealth build and switched my main gun to gauss pretty late.  The key is gauss can get a silencer.
---
Until then, I found all the energy rifles very disappointing compared to a simple hunting rifle.
---
One nice thing is batteries included perk reduces the weight of fusion cores, so if you‚Äôre going PA instead of stealth it helps a lot. 
---
Don‚Äôt be upset that I came with facts and you used whiny exaggeration rofl. Go back to the sims or something lol
---
Well, being "bored out of their minds" is why I'm doing those weird quests, so makes sense for the character too I guess. 
---
No, because the gatling isnt a rifle, its a heavy.
---
Dont get discouraged.  There are a lot of good helpful players. My gang and I run 20 deep and are all upper 100's. We constantly help out players. We give supplies guns ammo and help them progress through the game. 
---
When bad occurs stash ur junk and pvp. Dont be afraid to get killed it's only a game. Find friends...lots of them and roll together.

Grahm is a saint, bless his heart

I'm including every energy weapon because there is no way that durability rate is intended. If that isn't a bug, this is an even worse situation.

i check out every camp i stumble across. I love seeing what everyone else is doing. although if the door is locked i take the hint and move along
---
I'll go ahead and provide a reply in the similar format of your comment, I DID CONTACTTYE LOCAL STORE I BOUGHT IT AT. 
---
My local EB pretty much told me that it's an issue to take up with Bethesda. They did not offer any form of replacement or help. Instead just referring me to the Bethesda support page. 
---
Even after a lengthy conversation they still stood their ground and insisted that they cannot do anything to help. Which is why I am currently in this position. Contacting Bethesda was my second option. Going back and reaching out to my local EB for a replacement was my first. 
---
No, that is the popular opinion. Seems like this sub is full of dupers.
---
Rifle perks work on both ballistic rifles and energy rifles.  Make sure you're using Rifleman (single shot) and NOT commando (automatic).
---
Sometimes I don't think and heavy attack with a 1 hit kill. Still get a legendary but it takes a second to load. 
---
I support this idea. When I find my ideal settlement spot I'll get back to yah
---
Interesting then that I am just getting my email. Weird indeed. Oh well!
---
So far I've got a 0/2 KDR using MIRV Fat Men.
---
Yup. I was walking through the Red Rocket Truck Stop up North and saw a group of scorched so I killed them not realizing they were attacking the extractors that whomever had taken over there built. Stray bullet caused a 10 cap bounty before I realized what I'd done. Got killed for it later while selling in Watoga. 
---
Just because you have a 10 cap bounty doesn't mean you're a hardened criminal and should have your base destroyed.
---
right? what if they have bedbugs?? or GLOWING BEDBUGS?!?!?
---
That was my favorite node for a long time!
---
It will still drop a legendary almost 99% of the time the difference is the quality of the legendary.
---
Let's kiss

I also had a charging Tesla rifle that would constantly (often the first shot fired) crash my client on Xbox. However it might be fixed now?
---
I‚Äôm on PS4 if you want to team up sometime. Just got the game like a week ago but I rented it a few weeks back. 
---
Currently level 30 though and I sometimes run with a team but they‚Äôre like 100+ and it‚Äôs not a lot of fun fighting the creatures they fight. 
---
Technically, but after a lengthy conversation they informed me that they only ordered the amount equal to pre-orders. They never ordered extra as "backups" in case some customers editions were faulty. Which is why they could not replace the one I had. 
---
Lol good comeback, my man. I think my 5 year old nephew has a few more he can give to you.
---
but the flatwood monster is a separate check box compared to the Alien 
---
Xbox as well
---
I'm on Mac so I guess I'm just stuck using my gog version. 
---
I have been looking for one as well. I'm genuinely surprised there isn't someone posting updated challenges daily. =(
---
The problem really is that whitesprings is way too alluring as a grinding area. I dont want it to get nerfed but there needs to be real love put into places besides whitesprings and prime as nuke zones.

Thanks for sharing. Good read.

Whenever I hit up a train station I always dump any extra loot I'm clearing out from my stash into the nearest luggage. Who knew mailboxes can't hold 300 steel pieces!
---
Used mine yesterday and it disconnected me. Hence why it went away. 
---
I'd rather they spend their time fixing the bugs and working on new content. The FO4 companion app was cute, but I never used it while playing the game.
---
Maybe it would be cool some time down the road, but right now all their resources should be about the game.
---
For a different challenge I think. There's one for kill each type of "X" (not the cryptid one but another one). I have "Alien" checked of on my list.

Can confirm it is NOT locked at 25. Built mine for the quest in their pa stand. Level 45 excavator armor.

i wouldn't go above 300-400 caps and that is being generous, it's been duped to hell and beyond.

Yo if i had a pc id be playing sims rn at this very moment dont play binch!!! Very iconic game series.

You came here with no type facts, youre literally saying "i dont understand how someone elses level can affect you" you asked a question; I (me!) Answered with facts and reasoning and actual evidence. You cant understand because you refuse to understand, so absolutely do not get it twisted. Its all there, feel free to delete/edit your comments tho!!

I am not the only one who has posted a response to your question, someone else even included links with more solid proof. You wanna come back an hour later to talk some more shit instead of reading the fine print.

Legendary enemies are rare random spawns the more enemies,the bigger chance for one to spawn and there are 1-3 star ranked enemies 3 stars have a chance to drop a weapon with 3 legendaries on it
---
Always apply the mod to a piece of armor, and store that armor.  For now, anyway.
---
Wait wait wait they are admitting to selling caps for real money. I'm about 99% sure that's against the terms of use.
---
I've heard that Morgantown isn't terrible.
---
this was my go-to for a long while. recently trashed it for a 2* ski sword. furious and +1 Perception or endurance (i don't remember). its also L45, as my black diamond was 35.
---
no, but it will save you from dying often since it uses a stimpak without playing the animation
---
My gamer tag is Raynesidius, hit me up anytime some players are griefing you and we'll help take care of them. 
---
You can? I‚Äôve gotten a bounty by accidentally doing collateral to a players base whilst trying to claim their bounty, is this because I killed them.. then the stuff was destroyed, I‚Äôll be sure to try this on the next wasteland scum tho definitely a fun suggestion but equally terrifying if it happens to me 
---
Well if there were two exactly the same the it was probably left by the dupe fairy.
---
Invisibility should do such
---
Two shot explosive is a brokenly overpowered combination on any weapon, and shouldn't be in the game. Once you get a tse *anything*, every other weapon class seems week.

My shotgun is amazing at range, but vats are basically pointless as it only goes up to 10% beyond 5 metres

i‚Äôm not really into nukes but i‚Äôm fairly high level (85), i have discord and i play most of the day until the holidays end and usually on the afternoons, from Finland but time zones havent really been a problem with others yet. let me know if you wanna team up, bethesda.net username is the same as here, discord is helka.exe#0350 if you have it
---
I'd say the Marine tactical helmet just because of the fact you can craft them and sell them for 22-31 caps depending on Charisma level, hard bargain perk level, and if you ate grape mentats.
---
For every 3 points you can share 1 rank of a perk with your team. I am not sure beyond that.
---
You go into edit mode, move your targeting dot over the pylons, generator, or connection point and at the bottom, it should tell you the command for attaching wire. PS4 is triangle, xbox1 its Y, and not sure on PC. You push the attach button on it, then go to the other point and press the button there to attach it there. You should see it start to string it once you press it the first time.
---
üòÇüòÇüòÇ you eat too much soy bro chill. But I‚Äôm done lol I‚Äôve had enough laughs 
---
Improves prices at vendors and you can share a perk card for very 3 points 
---
huh, I guess flatwoods monster does count. now I just need to kill one before it fucks off, or hell even just find 1. I have only seen 2 of them out of my 160+ hours of game play
---
i've heard the farms north of the vault have a lot of corn and if you nuke them you can farm cobalt flux. havent confirmed 
---
Was in a party with a duper over the weekend (was selling each 25k coins for $5)  It had been working for like 9 hours at that point and had made $65, he was going to buy his gf a Christmas present that he missed.  It was pretty sad actually.  I had just gone there b/c of a LFG post on a single weapon, and that is how they were farming in game coins, then selling the coins.  Ironically never got the weapon but they dropped a bunch of quantom colas for waiting my time, he was do busy working on the money deals.
---
finlands time is great im sittting in norway so rougly the same. :)
---
Fully and completely disagree.  Bugthesda released this game months before it was ready.  These duping videos pressure them to remove the issues that should‚Äôve been caught and dealt with before the game was even released.  
---
Once a dupe is removed all those dupe videos become pointless and stop making money.  It should be a very limited window of opportunity.  
---
This notion of a market is absurd.  Duping means there‚Äôs plenty of TSE anything (minus hunting rifle) around for people to snatch up if they want.  Without duping the price on these items would be ludicrous.  No thank you.  Never felt the need to buy a weapon like this myself, but have no problem with anyone who wants to buy one from a duper.  
---
The only issue I could have with duping is how it affects the server, but even that is speculation.  Bugthesda has never come out and stated that duping is negatively affecting the game.  That is just an assumption we as players have made.
---
And you know what they say about assuming!
---
I wondered if it stacks? I guess not. I have two pieces of it. I guess I can probably get rid of one if it doesn't stack. But then there is the Mysterious Stranger in Luck. That should increase the chances some more at least.
---
Charisma is mostly for teamwork perks. You also need 3 Charisma points per point of a perk you want to share with your team. For example with 3 Charisma you can share an equipped perk that is worth 1 point in any SPECIAL category. 6 Charisma will let you share a level 2 perk, 9 Charisma you can share a level three perk, etc, etc. Keep in mind that some cards at level 2 cost three points. you would need 9 Charisma to share that card.
---
black diamond was my go-to for a long while. recently trashed it for a 2* ski sword. furious and +1 Perception or endurance (i don't remember). its also L45, as my black diamond was 35. the black diamond definitely served its purpose though. nowhere near "useless"
---
I'll be one of the judges. Probably have 200+ hours of modded settlement building in F04. Built some of the most amazing places, as u/xxJimmyVRxx can attest. Ironically, I am currently living out of 2 tents because I am weary of having to constantly repair anything nice I build due to scorchbitches and CAMP griefers. :-D  Hopefully ya'll can inspire me to get creative again.

How do you track his base, follow him?

---
One of my friends lives in WV, and is absolutely terrified of the mothman. This could be great. 
---
The passive is the more you have the cheaper prices are and the higher your goods are worth, along with for every 3 ranks you can share a 1 star perk cark. so 15 charisma = maxed gunsmith. 9 is the most common players take just to share a 3 star card.   
---
It is also limited to sharing 1 card only. 
---
It's a bat, they see sound!
---
now that i'm over 50 and have clear best weapons that dont break in one outing i could probably just reduce the amount of favorites i carry and replace them with aid items. while leveling through it wouldve been a godsend to have 2 wheels

Remove them from the console that told you to craft them

The PvP is just the worst.  I wish I could have seen the minutes from the development meetings were those decisions were made.  They have a few interesting concepts (e.g. the Wanted system and Hunter/Hunted Radio) but the execution is terrible.
---
X-01 calibrated shocks are in pretty high demand, from what I've seen. Adding the mod adds 50lb. carry weight per leg (possible 100lb total).

I got bitten by this earlier.  
---
I wandered up to the back door and somebody had built a gun platform and it was hammering the shit out of anything in range, couple of guns, 5-6 rockets, all giving it absolute beans.  
---
"I'll have some of this" i think to myself and climb up on the platform to tag a few of the ghouls and bloated as they pour out of the door for some free XP while the C.A.M.P did the hard work.  
---
So i get bored of having to do difficult stuff like "aim" and toss in a couple of molotovs and let the hoard do the work for me.  
---
Easy. Until the bugger logged out and the camp disappeared from under me, dropping me down onto the lawn.  
---
And the hoard kept coming, i don't know if another player had triggered the mobs to respawn but their were at least a dozen of them (i think the platform agro'd a lot of them firing rockets at the windows), and they all came for me after getting tagged by my petrol bomb.  
---
Fucking legged it down to the bottom gate "oh shit oh shit oh shit, running running running!" and let the half dozen Assaultrons wipe them out.   
---
Loving it.
---
Eventually everyone would have 15 in each special and would be over powered. 
---
I just want to be able to pick a perk for myself when I get an unusable duplicate in a perk pack which ends up getting deleted anyways. Might as well compensate me for it. 
---
Have you seen a show called The Last Man on Earth?
---
Read the post. The wanted guy wasn‚Äôt at his base. The douche op tracked him till he went to his base just to destroy his base
---
Weapon damage should be it's own stat category, like when we had skills. Get one "weapon skill point" each time you level up, for example, and max the skills at 10 or something. 
---
PC version of this would be swell. 
---
thnk you sir
---
Man, come on. This was a cool story until "making me the girl of the house." 
---
There are a million better comparisons to cowardly things you could have made without having to imply that being a girl is embarrassing.

Where do you get these plans?
---
I am having the same problem with both Heart of the Enemy (this quest) and Queen of the Hunt.  I did them on back to back days a couple of weeks ago and they haven't triggered since.
---
Kind of stinks to not have two high end dailies available.
---
I‚Äôve only seen him twice :(
---
Once for the side quest where you summon him at the light house, the other when a team mate saw him on a nearby ridge (we were walking through the valley).
---
Pretty sure the helmet isnt in the game
---
I've been making my own, stopped even reading the issues one because the format drives me crazy
---
That player can drop from the team and have his friend collect the bounty and give it right back to him.
---
I don't think I've ever read a list like this that I disagreed with so much.
---
1. The budget is fine, but items like turrets eat way too much of it up
---
2. If players can take over empty houses then it would create less exploring and looting. 
---
3. I think fast travel prices are reasonable. There are perks to lower prices.
---
4. Sure I guess. What they have is fine, but I'd be ok with adding more with later releases
---
5. Absolutely not. You should have to go back for it.
---
6. The problem with this is if the other friend isn't online. You'd be killing buildable real estate.
---
7. Haven't seen this?
---
8. I kind of like this. I don't need an indicator on where to go for every quest. This overseer quest forces you to explore.
---
9. I agree
---
10. I do think they need a few more caps on them, but the 20 hour reset seems fair
---
11. The vendors are separated based off which faction they belong too. The Whitespring vendors would all logically be a part of the same faction.
---
12. That might be cool. It's never been a feature in any fallout game before so it may be tough to implement.
---
13. how would a chat window work for consoles?
---
14. I love this idea
---
15. I'd be ok with faction camps
---

Good idea but then you run into the problem of everyone being able to do everything, which is fine in single player fallout but in 76 that'd ruin the balance.
---
I totally agree.  Maybe I can post to a fallout lore sub and see what the scribes say.
---
I'm wondering if the weapon repair perk is just as bad?
---
No problem, if they bug somehow, there are damaged ones scattered around the room (they are tiny so look careful)

How does this possibly effect your game play? The point in killing things is to get to a good spot so you dont die.

Depends. I have people buying metal buildings from me everyday when they stop by my little shop. But my marine plans sell kinda fast, same with my BoS officer and knight too. Some gun plans I find sell some do not I think I have been sitting on a 10mm smg for 4 weeks.

Anyone who actually enjoys PvP and has been around long enough to know that player balance is king for open world pvp, would run from this game, or not play it for the pvp aspect at the very least.
---
As much as I enjoy this game, trying to balance all the variations of character builds,mutations and weapon combos would be a lesson in futility. There will always be an alpha build that is way overpowered in this game, and it will always be a battle of one shot kills.
---
The silver lining, this game is a min/maxer's wet dream come true.
---
Why?  This is how exploits get exposed.
---
Not at all! My gf and I started alts and this has happened three times! Since we know how to min/max, our melee game is strong and we've had to smack them down with the quickness. I just don't get these people. 
---
This made me laugh a lot. I have yet to encounter the mothman, but my boyfriend also has an irrational fear of moths so I can't wait until I get that up close moment.

Fallout 3 is my favorite game ever. Not sure I need a FO4/FO76 updated version of it though.

I think the simplest solution would be breaking them down for atoms. Not too many since you can get them infinitely but not too little that you'll never be able to buy anything. 
---
does the MIRV have a greater radius? I was wondering why i kept taking myself out... i thought i was just estimating poorly. is it a larger blast zone for less damage? bc when i go to modify it, it says that the regular mini nuke attachment does almost double the damage in comparison to the MIRV

I just meant the Radium rifle in general. A legendary with some good effects will pretty much be good no matter what unless its just a really garbage weapon (buzzblaze) or a bad combo like a furious black pweder rifle. 
---
Do you mean explosive? the Executioner effect isn't explosive damage. i believe it makes the weapon do bonus damage when the target is below 40% health or something. 
---
Either way that makes it better than a normal radium rifle. 
---
But yeah I was just asking if a non legendary radium rifle was any good. havent used one. 
---

You need two newline characters (hit enter twice) to make new paragraphs.

as others said you can pull them out and repair them also you can find working mainframes around the room. a bit hard to spot at first but might save some mats if you don't want to repair them all.

---
Don't know why but found that equally funny and cute. I have a fascination and love of moths and was so excited there was a giant one in FO76 :)
---
If you spec into automatics they really pack a punch. Your comparison is flawed because it‚Äôs assuming that everyone specs into melee weapons only and not automatic weapons. I have a VATS build that uses a double shot auto 10mm with full guerrilla and it shreds. Especially with criticals they do a lot of damage. The reason that they dumb down the automatic weapons base damage compared to semi auto is because they have a higher DPS the more shots you land over time. You can mitigate the damage a semi has over an automatic if you take all the perk cards for it so there really isn‚Äôt any reason it needs buffing again.
---
by the way i dont really use the in-game chat so if you have discord that would be great so crashes wont be so big of a problem, the chat also cuts off when it happens you see. would just make things a bit easier :)
---
Agree, and shameless plug, [added it to my "bugs" post I try and update ](http://reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/ab9i2i/bugs_observed_issues_list_including_multiple/)
---
&gt;One fix would be an energy effect or something introduced while nerfing the explosive effect
---
You're right and we share the same thought:
---
Explosive must be nerfed, it is not a main but a 2nd effect, all other 2nd effect are mostly useless but +25% fire rate, either nerf explosive as 2nd effect to max 15 dmg or set explosive as a main effect (prefix) and set max dmg to 20-50 (depending of RoF).
---
Once dupe is *fixed for good* we need a massive balance of legendary effects, new prefixes, major effects &amp; minor effects: energy damage, incendiary, radioactive etc... 
---
If you are available in the next 10 mins from this post, I will give you an X01-Jetpack for free. Otherwise, you'll have to wait till I get home from work.

What was the local like? Always been curious what happens if you do that!
---
I sure hope they make other spots more alluring. I had a friend tell me that harpers ferry is an awesome place to nuke *IF* and only  *IF* the gouls are spawned there. As they get to the end of the silo he has another friend scoutnharpers ferry to see what enemies are there. 
---
If you're lucky. I've tried probably 80-90 times with no luck so far. I've been able to outfit my T-60 with calibrated shocks, but that's it.
---
I have a Ghoul slayer walking cane with limb damage and block reflection. It's a god roll for sure. Lol
---
sure ill boot it up. what do you enjoy doing then? if not nuking? :)
---
No, it's not. It's an amusing idea, but having to hunt down a shovel is a bad experience. I did it for the graveyard daily and the one that's supposed to be nearby was not. It took 3, 3! train stations to find one. 
---
Is your gauss rifle two shot or explosive damage? I've noticed that I can one shot most ferals with a headshot in sneak mode if I'm undetected with just a normal modded hunting rifle. 
---
Love it when this happens ! Usually only enjoy an empty server between 2am-5am but hey I'll take it
---
I accept all friend invites usually.. and always welcome anyone that wants to tag along with me or my friends.. been a time or two we have run a couple 4 man parties coordinating through the ps4 voice chat so 8 people could talk.. 
---
I will warn ya im bad at remembering names and we dont really ever have much of a plan just more of one of us says hey lets go do this, and most are sure lets go.. pretty laid back and a lil close to boring. 
---
But if lookin for people to run around with send me an inv.. mention reddit.. and come find me in game..
---
Actual mods dont need materials.   Only plans.   
---
It will show u lack materials if ur lacking but the mod will get attached.    
---
Wet ass indeed!
---
The hell this post about? Asking for a player shop? It is already confirmed player vending is coming. 
---
well for those with out orbital strike beacons the consequence would be loosing 8000 caps worth of ammo
---
Thank you for putting this so much more eloquently than me, I just really dont have the patience anymore at this point to spoon-feed this to people.
---
lol plaguewalker/junkie build players are super protective of their playstyle, even if it is more meme than meta. more power to them.
---
i dont necessarily agree or disagree that thats how it should work, but im just a player and we both have the same game and we all play by the same rules. i dont know if itll become part of the game but id be happy to see how it changes things.
---
No. Mod u dont need material to attache it.  
---
Plans u need material to attach.  
---
True camaraderie befitting of what I would hope would happen to the vault dwellers of Vault 76. 
---
Is the ability to share cards based off the passive charisma stat? I always thought it was hard linked to the perk level of charisma.
---
I believe he is now a Bardbarian 
---
If you do prime make sure you nuke between the two sites as there is a good amount of ferns in the forest close to watoga that you don't cover if you nuke directly on prime.
---
I mean, the tactic one, not the assault one
---
Wait, it does? I never even noticed that. 
---
Lmao. The second I saw limited time bullshit, I quit. If they have to put an item on "limited time" to try to meet some weekly Atom quota, they can suck my dick. 
---
Not going to be a rich man's toy. 
---
but not bulk, unless i'm incredibly unlucky...
---
Well dang though, I will make sure to equip whenever i craft!
---
Man, loadouts would be SO nice...
---
My first modem was 1200 baud. Who knew that lightning fast connection would be worthless in a few years. I mean it was fast. Then again, back then you directly dialed and connected to a specific server. 
---
Can share cards, required Charisma value x 3 the card rank.
---
Better prieces at vendors. It's capped.
---
Better loot from events and Group quests.
---
You wouldn't happen to be tracking all the issues with the Chainsaw, would you? That is my no. 1 irritation with this game.
---
Same, plus getting killed by creatures due to lag and losing hours worth of materials grinding has made this game entirely broken. I‚Äôm just going to uninstall the game to save memory and maybe come back in a few months if its any better. 
---
Well Idk where about, but I've never heard of her until now
---
Awesome. Thanks for sharing.
---
If you're talking about the welcome mats, they only work when placed in workshops, not in your camp, wish they did though.
---
&gt;When I hear those wings, I feel like a field mouse with an eagle overhead.
---
Excellent description, my feelings as well, I just slink away hoping beyond hope the bastard hasn't seen me.
---
We're all clearly having different experiences with this. Ive done a lot of Wanted hunting, and if I shot them with an explosive weapon inside their base I go Wanted myself. I'm not making this up nor I have any reason to lie. 
---
Uk theres a 3 min countdown to the nuke landing? Maybe idk join a team while you're waiting around, but uk disconnect knowing you could prevent it and complain like an idiot. You so smart!
---
PSA: Always check the cash registers or world stashes I drop 20-50 carry worth of plans aid and junk a day.   
---
 (rant) And I am tired of messaging people and them saying thanks but I don't trust it. And have it sit there to rot.  Oh well someone didn't get a full set of plans to make T-60.  /r
---
So happy to read this, a few posts I've read lately saying they have been harassed in nuke zones by high levels. It does happen semi-often. But many more times myself lv150+ and others will always try to guard and give and supplies to lower levels, some in hazmat suits even. Most importantly we always try our best to let everyone tag as much as possible, Especially legendary mobs, it makes a lovely farming group. Anyone 1 shotting everything with no thought of others, we will always try to kill them. Bit hard atm, as everyone 1 shots each other goes back and forth a bit till someone gets bored lol.
---
Yeah it happens form time to time for me but only when the nuke is launched to close to watoga vs farther
---
ohh in the entrance to the enclave bunker where you enter the actual vault door, you cross into the bunk over a catwalk, if you drop down underneath there is a pile of garbage and in that pile is a broken protectron that you can search and get a bit of a message recording. it then starts a thing (can't remember the name) where you investigate what happened in the Enclave. the recordings and transcripts you find inside the enclave bunker tell a pretty effed up story. don't want to ruin it but it's worth looking at if you haven't already.
---
I mean besides the rarity, the lack of Legendaries... What am I missing?
---
do a lot of events and just explore when i‚Äôm solo, i‚Äôve got a team i usually play with but they‚Äôre really nice people so they‚Äôll probably take you in too if you want
---
That walking cane... that's definitely late game gear. Hold onto to, friend. 
---
also do the servers stay up long enough now?  Ive curtailed my play style to be 1 hour increments where the only time i go back to base is to log off so i have a safe spawn point
---
Do consoles get them as well?
---
A 1 star requires 3 charisma, a 2 star requires 6, a 3 star requires nine. 
---
Feel free to add me: ndmonkey
---
I would love to level up and gather loot!
---
I don't know how big or small the team is that's working on the game so if I'd have to guess with everything I've seen I'd say no. 
---
I don't want the team to dedicate more resources that they may not have on an app that may not be used my the entirety of the games players. With how the game shipped I don't know if it will be good enough to work or work properly.
---
It‚Äôs fallout. Get lost and do whatever the hell you want.
---
Too many players. I find it triggers when i view my inventory
---
have you watched the vid? that's just broken. how people plan to do queen hunting and stuff? we couldn't do anything. lol
---
Me too, my first fight with one and had that quest after, not found the clown's costume yet, something to look forward to.
---
Yeah but oddly they're considered energy weapons also lmao, just bethesda things.
---
You don‚Äôt get wanted, but the owner of the camp gets an ‚Äúunder attack notification‚Äù and can initiate combat with you.  Still be wary.  
---
My irritation is mostly aimed at the fake rocks. You've probably noticed that a lot of stone outcroppings don't seem to count as ground - placing items goes right through them, things touching them are still "floating," etc. Some of the grey stone is part of the landscape, but it seems like most of them are props. PITA when trying to build overhanging a cliff etc, and it's a real -_- moment when you have support legs making perfect contact and can't place because "floating"
---
The passive stat. If you have a SPECIAL Charisma of 6 but then become addicted (and lose a point), you will not be able to share a level 2 perk. So if you share Magnetic Personality, yeah, everyone is able to share high-level perks.
---
I have all my benches and stash box outside. All I have in my locked house is another stove, a plant and the bed with that filthy mattress.  I'd pay with atoms to get fresh sheets or a comforter to cover that nasty thing. Rarely do I  use it because we all know it's full of who knows what kinds of nasty things. Anyway, I  digress.  I  have a question about storage containers. Is there a storage container that I  can put outside that's not tied to our stash box. I'd  like to put free items in there for people who visit. 
---
If it isn't Lonestar and his sidekick Puke!  Where's my money?
---
Yeah, but you have to see them coming first to be able to snipe them!
---
(I am a melee/sniper build, however, so if I DO ever see one from a distance, I will remember your advice!)
---
Anyway I can get a bulk discount? üòÄ
---
The problem with this is nuke zones though, yes? 
---
Doesn't drop as loot, level locked at 20 and the dual bar seems purely cosmetic. Glad you are tracking these things!
---
Yeah, here's the screenshots of the challenges. First one is the one I was referring to.
---
https://xboxdvr.com/gamer/fallouthirteen/screenshot/11198131
---
This one is the one you mentioned.
---
https://xboxdvr.com/gamer/fallouthirteen/screenshot/11198132
---
So yeah, I don't know. I know I didn't kill any actual Zetans but it's weird the cryptid list has Alien and Flatwood Monster listed.
---
I think there is a cap of 6???
---
Yes I'm aware. I'm asking if it's based off the passive charisma stat that is under the Status menu in the pipboy or if it's linked to the perk level of charisma in "Perks"
---
Get Dense. Fire isn‚Äôt too common. Explosions definitely are (scorchbeasts sonic attacks...)
---
Yeah, I was thinking about those. Didn‚Äôt realise they don‚Äôt actually work at your camp. Thanks for setting me straight. 
---
I've just maxed enforcer so shall look forward to my next Wendigo encounter :))
---
Workshops have always had them under Misc. Why CAMPs dont still is beyond me.
---
5k for all that I can make (like 15 or 16 out of 19 possible)
---
I crossed the map work level 5. It's a game. Death isn't forever.
---
Very informative. Ty
---
Oh I know. I love fallouts. I just didnt want my game stuck or frozen or lose all my progress so I waited to play. 
---
it was 3 of us plus 2 or 3 more max. the quest thing says min 8 players. i cant imagine what a mess it would be if like whole server gather there. 
---
Both Heart of the Enemy and Queen of the Hunt haven't popped for me in 2+ weeks.
---
The animal walks to your base, so it will take some time to get there.
---
It takes a minute or two to get to your camp. Wait. Go do stuff. It'll be there eventually.  
---
... assuming Bethesda doesn't bug out, as per the norm.
---
sometimes you get a ton of people that are too low level or just get 1 hit and then hide near by and each additional person in the event makes her more powerful, have more HP and summon way more mobs to help fight you. We had a relatively small group last night and most of us were high level and well geared. not a lot of mobs lived more than a second or two so it wasn't all chaotic as it can be. And as you saw we were able to melt her pretty fast. I have 2 prime weapons now and they are both TSE weapons and the ultracite ammo they shoot does a bunch of extra damage to scorched. I'm sure others had some as well. It was a great fight.
---
I have a wonderful lakeside home built on a cliff with some nice features

I'll be on in about an hour
---
I'll add you guys next time I play. Might be a little later today
---
Wow. Calibrated shock mods require flux to install?   
---
What game are u playing. 
---
T45, t51, t60, excavator all have calibrated shocks via mods and not a single material or flux was needed.  
---
Got it thank you for the answer. For some reason I thought it was the perk level, but that would essentially make that perk card useless since passive charisma is only really good for vendors. Thanks again. 
---
Don't mean to be a dick but it's donned, not "dawned."
---
Yeah me too...
---
I think you should do it. You have 4-6 months. I'd like to see what you make by the time it arrives.
---
never visit the atom shop pretend it doesn't exist.  play the game be happy.
---
Gotcha that shouldn't happen. Loosing your progress wise.. your gonna freeze here and there tho. But it's on a server it auto saves everywhere.
---
I just did it for my first time and got the fusion generator 
---
9 (I added that to the original post)
---
It was unbelievable brah. We figured the game had to be trying to load us into the same nuked server over and over. There is no indicator of any server numbers or anything like that so you have no way of really knowing if you are changing servers or logging back into the same one. I don't know why, but I do know it was a pain in the ass..
---
Anyone found targeting computer plans for a missile launcher? I‚Äôve scraped dozens and never got it. Thinking I‚Äôll have to buy it from a vendor 
---
I won't bore you with details as to when/where I play but I play a lot and I have never seen server populations as low as you describe nor have I have seen anyone else relate numbers similar to what you describe, so based on my experience I stand by what I said. 
---
Yea.. the most I've been getting from other players are emoticons to acknowledge that we see eachother lol. If its not that, it's griefers. 
---
I can confirm that this is and will always be one of the scariest things to experience in fallout 76
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/abx5m0/now_that_servers_are_down_wanted_to_repost_this/
---
Here is Reddit post on it. 
---
Oh, so you can only share one no matter your CHA?
---
didn't know SB screams were tagged as being explosive, but super mutants use molotovs alot, and dots are rather dangerous if your not careful
---
He does not fear the dark side as you do. He has brought peace, freedom, justice, and security to his new empire.
---
great post!!
---
**General Rule:**
---
Any time you see high level player using a low damage weapon (dagger, sword, guitar, etc) or a Tesla weapon they are there to share, have fun, and help people out..
---
Turn your in game chat on area chat (if for no other reason to hear us), or atleast follow their emotes, because most of us aren't asshats.
---
I've held together groups of around 12 (like the whole server) in WhiteSprings, everyone getting XP and loot, with the people even sharing 2*&amp;3** with each other as people need.. When we work together it can be a freaking blast.
---
Happened to me before too. I'm pretty sure I just logged out and back in and the quest reappeared 
---
Pheh even if this gets added , I still won't stop destroyin people's bases , one shotting 'em with my TSE Dragon even if we're not in combat to see their faces when I steal their junk after the end of a massive dungeon and running in front of em when they are shooting to initiate combat and kill them because after all of this duping , do you think I'm short on materials to rebuild my base?Or caps?
---
I agree with you but have a downvote for being an ass about downvotes.
---
Cobalt, Violet, Fluorescent, Crimson, and Yellowcake. Those are the colors of raw flux collected from different plants (use green thumb for double loot!). Those need to be combined in a chemistry bench 10x raw flux of your color choice, with Hardended mass, Glowing Mass, and High radiation fluids to create 1 Stable Flux of that color (use Super Duper luck perk for a chance at crafting double!). 
---
Stable Flux is the highest level crafting material in the game. Used for Fusion Cores, Radiation Arch, High level power armor mods, Under Armor upgrades for SPECIAL bonuses, and more.
---
They never buy a round, don't bother, selfish bastards!
---
I think I love your mum too! Sounds like my kind of gal!
---
Agreed. I'm a little floored the radium rifle isnt more effective against players. 
---
Im on Xbox. Sure we will receive the windows version, but it‚Äôs released already? Thought I would get an email or whatever. Should I ‚Äûsense‚Äú that we are gifted now? So I need those Launcher? 
---
Guess I buy the gog version and install it on the Mac. Costs just cents and it‚Äôs much more comfortable.
---
I think you mean late age gear, but totally agree.
---
Accurate.  I‚Äôm on a standard PS4 and I‚Äôve done very clean queen runs with smaller groups of 6-8.  When the whole server shows up it basically becomes a storyboard. Frame rate is in the toilet, bugs galore, teleporting enemies, etc.  it seems like not only the Queen, but the number of mob spawns increases dramatically with more people
---
And it just becomes hellish after a certain point.
---
Bats actually have really good eyesight, and if they 'see sound' shouldn't explosives blind them temporarily with how loud they are?
---
*nod* forgot about the level lock, will add that back in, people have reported the dual bar helps with Armor pen but I'll peak later, thanks for the info!
---
Some quests, like Roses Super Mutant quest, do not have a fixed location.  Turn off every other quest but hers, swing around until you see it on the compass, then follow that line on the map... you will find it.
---
You can use the d-pad to scroll between options on the favorites wheel. Saves me a bunch of time for RadAway
---
Do it. Go to town, have fun, come back in a few weeks when they add more to do. No shame in that.
---
Bandwidth isnt terribly important anyway, unless your still on dialup or something.  Latency is what matters and in Bethesda's case it's most likely within Amazon's network.  Amazon has entry points all over the world so your ping may appear low but gameplay latency is still pretty high due to their "cloud" setup.
---
You're not wrong, but they can sell for 2-3k.

Sorry, I couldn't help it. I know this won't end well, but I guess I'm a glutton for punishment
---
I did only once at end ? Unless your talking about load screens?
---
If you knew what they were about to do, why not just server hop? 
---
Ill have to try that thanks.. i know the stick doesnt work for me.
---
I wish I was on ps4 but I aam on xbox. I have a small 6 room hotel with a gift shop, restaurant, and lounge. Best of luck to finding a cool base.
---
You are a coward. Don‚Äôt say things on the internet that you wouldn‚Äôt say to someone‚Äôs face. It‚Äôs so easy in the safety of your home, try doing it in real life.  You wouldn‚Äôt be talking still if you called people lazy and idiotic in the way that you have done here. Grow the fuck up. 
---
Special are still capped at 15, and with how many 5 point perks, and 'multiples' of 3 point perks for damage there are...I'd not be to upset personally about having 15s across the board tbh
---
If I didn't have a full time job and a kid with special needs I'd do it for sure. Maybe I'll start by looking into the "yarn" aspect and see about that. You never know LOL! 
---
"12) Show benefits of recipes you are about to make in the cooking station. Only showing the name doesn't help."
---
It does, look to the left of the name under "Item stats" while at cookstation, it tells you all the benefits.
---
Last night crashed 4 times on me in a hr and half so I just stoped trying but will be back at it again today if game will let me. Lots of bad publicity about 76 but its a addictive game for me I play and lose trac of everything like bed time got work in the morning. üòî lol 
---
You actually can't have two shot and quad legendary on same weapon.
---
Are they not showing up? or can you just not see them? Sometimes the markers are really hard to find. If you highlight the current quest and hit RB (for xbox atleast) it will open the map and center on the destination. 
---
hey, who doesn't love feats at level 1?
---
Every time I've fired it, it was so hectic i can't really tell what the blast radius would be. I need to get up on a cliff or something and fire a few rounds, get a better idea of how far away i need to be. I tried using it at white springs, between the ghouls rushing you and all the cars, i would not recommend.
---
Regarding ammo scrapping:  
---
JUST FUCKING USE IT! USE THE FUCKING AMMO. OR GIVE IT TO ANOTHER PLAYER SO THEY CAN FUCKING USE IT!
---
LMAO I tell it like it is, you shooting yourself in the foot and then crying about it is moronic and now you wanna talk about irl shit? Please XD XD XD
---
Oooof
---
Cool job stealing my post 
---
I also got one form a drop a few days ago and it definitely appears that way. 
---
Crikey i just saw this!! A tad too late but I will gladly wait. You are a saint thank you so much!
---
Sometimes one or all of my quests disappear upon login (not just from the map but from my pip-boy) and logging back out and back in fixes it.
---
It does look cooler that‚Äôs for sure
---
Well, I don't care about downvotes personally. But if this post gets downvoted into oblivion then no-one will see it. This is an issue that needs a fix and frankly I found it baffling that more than half the people reading had downvoted (before I was an ass about it)
---
You need to decide on a build, I would suggest in your case, go with melee,  melee does a great deal of damage, start building you Strength and Charisma Trees and get some decent melee weapons, they all over, pretty much anything works, baseball bats, lead pipes, axes. Look at some of the melee perks for improve your swing. 
---
Once you have a semi decent or not so decent melee build, there is nothing to fear, you can pretty much drop anything with enough patience except the scorch beast and some of the really OP enemies  .. also get some PA even if it is just a empty frame, this immediately increases your strength +10 .. if you don't like PA, get some get Armour ..
---
Also get the Pharma Farm perk asap so you can get decent chems early in the game.
---
No, the animal goes to your camp when tamed not when pacified.When pacified is just not aggressive towards you.
---
I had never seen one until i explored up north by prickett's fort and the munitions factory- that's the only place i've ever seen them.
---
I have a hermit crab that spawns on the road next to camp. I named him Andrew Hester. He's a 3 star a fair chunk of the time I go test out weapons on him. 
---
While I didn‚Äôt quite scream like a little girl, my first encounter with Mothman may or may not have caused me to pee a little 
---
yay seems like a nice bunch. just out for a cigarette but added you on discord. Daliko#3130
---
seriously, i can count the amount of ammo that i've had to drop because i have no space left in my stash box or inventory.
---
Another tip for your future Nuke runs. If you have a group you can trust, Trade all of the mats to one person that has Super Duper perk to maximize your crafting. Then just have them divide it back up between group members. I do this all the time and come out with way more then I would solo. Just make sure its someone you trust to not rip you off.
---
Is taming it a different perk?
---
I‚Äôm playing the game that has ultracite and x01 power armors. 
---
Yeah, this I have noticed too. 
---
12.1) Make user interface more intuitive... lol  Thanks I'll check it out
---
It just works.
---
Im still here. AFrostedWolf IGN hurry
---
No problem!
---
Pacifying an animal wont tame it, and you cant tame just any creature spawn. I think there are some pretty useful guides on here detailing the process.
---
I‚Äôve had this song on my brain since I read this... &lt;3
---
I disagree. I think hotswapping min-maxed perk card loadouts should not be encouraged.
---
a bit disappointing that end game content runs like this. kinda same happens when we do 3..4 men silo clears. its a total mess. sadly :/
---
It is not that bad but it kills faster than it gives rads, now a legendary radium rifle with +50 rads dmg would be rad
---
Copy, logging in now
---
... did he try turning it off and back on again?
---
Tried this. Will try Necatorducis's advice next. As for "no marker" ... well, that sucks. Good to know, though. Thanks
---
I really wish there was a better way to do do this, or a communal dumping ground with stash box near by. 
---
I dropped ~1200 ammo yesterday because I don't have weapons to even burn through it. I've got a ton of plans on me that I wanna get rid of but can't bring my self to dump randomly (unlike ammo). 
---
I know some people use the corpse outside of the vault but I've gone a few times and never see anything there and rarely see people leaving the vault now. the first few weeks I always saw at least one person coming out or near flatwoods. Now it seems fairly uncommon to catch that on the servers.
---
Interesting. Will try this tonight

They're trying to do what Fortnite did with cosmetics. ***YOU'LL NEVER KNOW WHEN THIS ITEM WILL BE BACK SO BUY IT NOW FOR THIS OUTRAGEOUS PRICE*** *even though Fortnite is f2p*... 
---
Say what you want about that game,  but at least their cosmetics were well made. Still incredibly overpriced though, but definitely makes the Atomic look like trash.
---
Wow. Just wow. I've heard of floating heads and elongated necks but this is new. 
---
Did they do a new update where pacifying tames them? Cuz last time I checked those were 2 different things. 
---
Honestly it feels like a huge moneygrab, either that or they're trying to see how far they can push people with the stupid pricing. I mean sure you do get a ton of atoms early by just playing the game, but I imagine it will slow down considerably later on, and the really dedicated people that are still playing down the line will probably end up buying atoms for real cash if cool stuff keeps getting added to it.
---
I got all the PA skins from just doing challenges, but I'm sure a bunch of people actually bought a few, and pricing on those for example are just horrible, 14-18 bucks for skins is kind of outrageous.
---
But the "please let me re name power armour" are fine? Duping is killing this game. Why shouldn't ppl be angry about it? 
---
Tried to stack Green thumb last night with team it did not work cumulatively
---
As long as you have all those except for electrical? Deal. I'm on PS4. I'll be on in 5-6 hours. City_dave on PSN too.
---
I would love it if you could use Footlocker &amp; other storage area as extra space. It wouldn't be too much of  game breaking if only the items in your "my stash box" moves around with you, but the items in the Footlocker stay at your base.

The 200 cap bounty. His buddy was 100-something, but I‚Äôd never seen 200 before. Wanted to try my luck at taking him/them down. 
---
Caught the big fish by surprise but as soon as his buddy realized what was happening he made very short work of me. The unwanted guy just sat back and watched as far as I could tell. 
---
This \^\^
---
plus i'm always hitting the wrong option and stimpacking myself :P

One problem: Prices post-inflation are all rounded to the dollar, implying they don't use change any more. Probably phased it out when resources started to get tight after the pre-nuke war kicked off.

You should play games before offering your opinions on them.  
---
Same goes for speculating on how a corporation works, work there to gain insight.

That's just not how managing a company works.

Did you do this to me last night?  I had a 10 cap wanted mark for rummaging around and I think I broke someone‚Äôs traps in cranberry bog
---
they changed the animation and it looks much better now, but if you don't want to use PA serendipity is a good choice as well
---
Found the feminist. 
---
Oh. Hah. You're right, I wasn't even thinking. Pacifying just makes the animal stop being hostile for a short while. Taming is definitely different. Thank you!
---
What if they hide in another player's house and you orbital strike it? :)
---
Your an idiot no offense 
---
This sounds interesting but already being level 19 and some points going into agility and other skills to help with stealth would it be much of a setback to chanhe my build now?
---
I already have some empty PA and a few bits that are too high level to equip to it, the only thing that puts me off of the PA is the HUD, I just think its too much on the screen personally.
---
It is *that* bad. When you dc due to their pos servers, it restarts. 
---
Oh, I see. I thought the OP was talking about having a phone app synced with your game, where you could see and use your PIP boy. That way, your screen would never be covered with it. You could leave the weapons tab open and quickly switch weapons by touching them, which seems like it could be nicer than using hot keys.  Being able to see where you are on the map would be cool so. I don't know why the game doesn't have a mini map.
---
I learned a valuable lesson this week.
---
After arguing with Verizon techs for two weeks in an effort to get a crew to come to my new home and dig a ten foot line to connect me to FiOS, being told "no connection is possible" by the "engineering team",  I finally posted in their twitter feed about how disappointed I was with their entire program. I posted a picture showing where my home is in relation to the closest junction box. I told them i'd post this crap in their feed every day until someone came to my house and either explained why it cannot be done, or completed the connection. 
---
It took me less than 30 mins to have THEM call ME to schedule the installation. 
---
Companies hate bad PR on social media. I'd suggest you hit them there. I hated to be that way, but being disregarded when it was obvious the "engineers" were just being lazy pissed me off. 
---
? I didnt offer any opinion on the game
---
Do you realize you're on reddit? The internet? That you can just organize with the 87 who upvoted and the 166,000 subbed?
---
I don't know how else to address your defeatist attitude.
---
&gt;I havent personally played the game
---
Stopped reading there.
---
üòÇ This happens to me all the time with random shit, game has a lot of guaranteed jump scares 
---
I see the game in the launcher, but it says I need to buy it.  I'm a Christmas noob, and didn't log in until after the announcement.  So, maybe I logged in too late to get the it.  Doesn't really matter, I have Fallout 1 &amp; 2 on steam already.
---
I feel like hypothetically you are correct, but practically you are wrong.
---
&gt; Both do more than enough damage using the right weapons, perks and legendaries.
---
Sure, as long as you are using pipe weapons and cheesing the system because they somehow count as both a rifle and a pistol, this is true. There's no way this isn't a bug, though, and it's only a matter of time before it's *fixed* and all weapons that are TSE suck balls. Anything other than those two guns will have you unloading entire clips into an enemy, by which time he's close the gap and you have to rely on your shotgun or melee. This isn't sniping, it's just poking an enemy 100 times and then using a close range weapon. Melee is feasible with just about any weapon you want to use. 
---
And if combat and hunting rifles suck compared to pipe weapons, energy weapons suck compared to *everything*. Laser, gamma, and plasma are just terrible. There's no point in them being in the game as they are right now; they aren't viable in any situation.
---
The weapons and perks need a major balance effort. IMO melee and ranged should do roughly the same damage. The advantage to melee isn't that it should be more deadly, it's that it never has to worry about ammo, ever. The inconvenience of getting into melee range and having to spec more toughness to balance out the convenience of never worrying about ammo or having to spec into crafting it. 
---
The strike-first style of ranged means you have a decent chance of killing half the enemies before they really get to take a good crack at you, so you don't have to be as tough. However, if you run out of ammo you're boned. You'll either be farming, spending $$, or specing like crazy to keep your ammo reserves up. 
---
Yeah well it took them way to long to add such a basic feature of push to talk so everyone got used to never using mics.
---
The problem with that would be people making dummy characters just to break down Perk cards for atoms. 
---
Just play, explore. Go with perks you want that you think will be useful or fun, once you get the hang of things, then start looking at more hardcore builds and rolling a new toon or rebuilding the one you have 
---
Dude, Rose is awesome.
---
I just noticed this myself the other day. Crazy that they‚Äôre completely omitted from the build menu in CAMPs. 
---
Oh, I see. I thought the OP was talking about having a phone app synced with your game, where you could see and use your PIP boy. That way, your screen would never be covered with it. You could leave the weapons tab open and quickly switch weapons by touching them, which seems like it could be nicer than using hot keys.  Being able to see where you are on the map would be cool too. I don't know why the game doesn't have a mini map.
---
That's what girls say about guys who are good at math and computer studies.
---
I cucumbered myself doing this... But I like dropping off shitloads of free food to newbies so...worth
---
Thanks I was starting to look it up but got distracted by work. 
---
I love the 76 community you all are always helpful with questions and loot. 
---
I‚Äôm doing a heavy pa build with mutations, I don‚Äôt mainline starched genes as I feel it‚Äôs a waste of a slot, it‚Äôs useful for obtaining all your mutations, as long as you remember actively that you don‚Äôt have it on it‚Äôs not a problem. I run sun kissed under endurance so radiation isn‚Äôt a big deal. However sun kissed does not work when you are in a nuke zone so putting on starched genes in there makes sense. 
---
The terrifying locust sound doesn't help when they attack 
---
When did I say that it's fine? When did I say that you shouldn't be angry about it?
---
I do not condone duping, but it doesn't kill a damn thing. Duping of TSE weapons? Sure, that's having a very negative impact on the community. But the primary issue is that TSE guns are so ridiculously overpowered.
---
&gt; 76 game bad    
---
--random NPC
---
Nah, man, you can tell from the context that he meant that he caused the sun to rise over the horizon of his power armor.
---
I think it should be a combined perk added to something else already providing a perk for the rifle.  Much like how Martial Arts does 2 things for melee weapons, and Scattershot does 2 things for shotguns...  there's really no excuse for rifles weighing as much as heavy weapons and requiring a singular perk just to reduce its weight.
---
Less than you expect. I get a lot of Potato Crisps and Pork n Beans lol
---
My base is inside a mountain good luck catching me coppers 
---
No memes on the subreddit bud.
---
Looks like I need to redo some perk cards. 
---
One of my friends got a glitch where they "looked like" they were sitting on a couch, even when moving around.  It was epic....lol
---
Leave his/her cow alone!!!
---
Yeah, I use my regular rifles on most standard enemies. I save my Gauss for Nukes or PvP.
---
 My Gauss is neither. It's a 3 star legendary that does +30% more damage to ghouls and +50% more critical damage in Vats. I still use 2mm EC ammo. I have sneak maxed with mister sandman, which makes it 3.5x damage at night with a supressor. All rifleman and bloody mess. Adrenal Reaction, and Eagle Eye mutations. Better criticals and crit savy. Nerd Rage. Concentrated fire. A lot of others. I still have room to improve which is crazy. You can seriously do some insane damage in this game. 
---
Currently, my Gauss base damage at 20% health is 526.. so 3.5x that, then stack +115% critical damage. Oooo buddy.
---
I'm pretty sure that statement is inherently offensive on porpoise lol
---
Keep on dootin that thumbs up y‚Äôall!
---
Clickbait. Uninformed (and wild) speculation at the absolute best. Downvoted.
---
I can neither confirm nor deny that. One of the players in our group was traded them for other items. He didn't think to ask how when he saw them in the players inventory. 
---
I'm pretty sure Energy Weapons are actually broken on a code level or something. 
---
I have a Bloodied Laser Rifle, and adrenal reaction. So at low health all my weapons do a LOT of damage. My laser rifle will show 270 damage. Yet my Handmade will show 180 damage. The laser rifle will take twice as many headshots to kill an enemy that the handmade will. Despite listing lower damage. Even with a damage per shot of "270" and a faster rate of fire, I still only need 2-3 headshots from the hand made than the laser rifle. 
---
And then like you said, it'll break if you sneeze on it. Same with the heavy weapons. Sub par damage output (the Gatling Gun and M2 Machine gun are exceptions) pathetic durability, and massive perk and ammo investments.
---
Alex Jones called. He said you're crazy.
---
Nah. 
---
Beth maryland made a weak game real quick cuz it had no story (i.e. no elaborate scenes/no npc dialogue/no story to navigate) and sent it to beth austin so they could apply netcode and make it online. Due to deadlines a weak ass product was released. Pretty basic, mang.
---
I'm also a 48 year old housewife that plays Fallout - we need some kind of "Cryptid" name because no one believes we exist! :D 
---
Very sexy and wholesome tbh, thank u for sharing
---
oooh oooh oooh... pick me,  pick me...
---
Nope. My foundations lock in place and refuse to go anywhere even if I never added any stair or ramp. Sometimes it randomly let's me take it apart so the only other option is to build around what you have or re-place your camp. Honestly we need a RESET CAMP option that stores every thing you put down already.
---
Hello! PsS4tag is Maximums_effortus if you'd like to see a grease monkeys humble warehouse stop by!
---
Edgy.
---
You all fucking rock!! And thank you!
---
Tell it like it is? What that I‚Äôm lazy for nuking solo? Or that I‚Äôm lazy because no one accepts team invites? Your nonsensical bullshit only entertains yourself and strokes your fragile ego. I‚Äôm sorry if video games are the closest thing to real life that you experience. Now go away. 
---
Or just code it so we can't get duplicates.
---
1star cards of 3star cards I kind of understand, although making it so we can just choose which rank we want to use would be a thousand times better 
---
But duplicates of things like hacker/lockpick just... Disappear. What horrible design.
---
You should read past that part! I put a ton of effort into it!
---
This would just make the whitespring nuke spawn glitching worse
---
Where  did you find that weapon. I found one but accidentally scrapped it. Can't remember where it was. 
---
I mean if they can find someone willing to pay that I say sure go for it, but I will spend about 10 minutes at most with a trade. I'm more about pushing product out then getting the best bang for its buck, especially in a over saturated market.
---
This is why no one should pay attention to them.
---
If that route, I'd love passive perks that enable at camp. 
---
Switching to craft extra ammo, better defenses, use fewer components, ect....  is really dang annoying. 
---
I forgot I had ditched my Thru-Hiker perk (Reduce food weight) in order to craft lvl2 turrets yesterday. Left camp and quickly found myself over encumbered after a few items and could not figure out WTF happened. Thought I hit some glitch or something. Dropped a bunch of stuff before realizing the issue was a perk card. 
---
Absolutely correct however the posts that are just click bait with no constructive points regarding the reasons for leaving can go. 
---
Less: Fuck this game I'm done *click on post* because it's shit"
---
More: Fuck this game I'm done *click on post* because these valid points...
---
They do Respawn after being killed?? :o
---
same with green thumb, I've gotten like...5 dupes of that cause I took it at level 2
---
Completely agree. Ban the youtubers that do this crap; they are not only violating the ToS but also showing themselves doing it for the world to see in order to show more people how to do it
---
Lol. 
---
 dick move, but i still chuckled. 
---
Cute troll :&gt;
---
That's a good point. 
---
The only good thing that I've seen in the store (read: the only thing that even mildly interested me) was my awesome Blackbird paint job.
---
Of course. But until this subreddit's mods explicitly say they don't want people posting complaints on *their* subreddit, I don't see what the problem is. 
---
i logged into a server last night and checked the map for any nuke zones... instead I was a quick run away from a naked wanted man who had a 440 cap bounty on him... I shot him 6 times before he died and I was like WTF this is a TSE Shottie! I forgot to turn off passive... 
---
I love the way you write, you're funny :)
---
Yes, u can. 
---
Mine did, not impressed with its performance.  Too many times I saw mirv'ed mod do no damage so I replaced that and it seems to work better.  But then maybe it was just my lack of training.
---
I thought you were talking about your age. I was about to agree with you full heartedly!! The 20‚Äôs flew for me in this game, lots of explorin‚Äô
---
To heck with all those people saying helping people is boring and it's fun to "RP" as a raider just to be a jerk. This is what I like to see.
---
Agreed
---
Yes you can still eat dog food but it will continue to give the normal food percent, not extra.
---
This man (AFrostedWolf) is a saint among men, holy shit! I just want everyone to know this is a true kind soul! 
---
Vendor stops showing it after level 44, event drop is not level capped
---
Ouch, that sucks. My favorite part was when they kept asking for J47 and that they were like 21 years late. A while later I saw a ghoul wearing a hat with the ticket labeled J47 tucked in the side of their hat.
---
I must have bumped into a wendigo around there without realizing it.... creepy...
---
 Bottom left on the map. The highest level place outside of the Glass Cavern, not far from there. She did that at level 25 or so the first time.
---
 Get way out of your depth. its immense fun. 
---
some badass bear glitch happened to me. like i was being like this and moving around like some actions figure lol.
---
[https://imgur.com/a/NgN3Sop](https://imgur.com/a/NgN3Sop)
---
You can buy the shielded lining and all others at enclave bunker military wing. Have to each lvl read before the others show up there just got shielded there myself. Hope that helps 
---
The first wendigo I fought scared the shit out of me. I was just killing ghouls in the area during an Order of Mysteries quest only to hear a weird roar and ominous boss music begin before the thing popped up out of nowhere and started to chase me down at ridiculous speeds. It was only slowed by shotgun blasts and Molotov cocktails to the face. I think I was down to one or no stimpacks when it was all said and done. My last encounter went so much better with me managing to cripple it and run it into a damn yao gai who I then also crippled and murdered because fuck both of those things so very much. 
---
I'll certainly give this a try then, Strength will be the first thing i go for. I think the only other thing for me would be the fusion cores, ive only ever found 2 or 3, obviously not looking in the correct places but my friends all seem to have 10 or 20+!
---
&gt; When using a hazmat suit and taking it off, your armor goes back on like when exiting PA.
---
Even better, treat hazmat suits like other "outerwear" that can be worn over armor pieces. It doesn't make any friggin sense that I can wear a slinky red dress over my combat armor, but I can't put on a big bulky hazmat suit. 
---
It would also allow for a lot more build diversity. As it stands, pretty much everyone at end game is either stomping around in power armor or running a glass cannon build with nothing but a hazmat suit and some mutations. 
---
If we could wear a hazmat suit on top of our regular armor it would actually make armor with perks like "-15% damage from Ghouls" worth saving and using.
---
servers dont repopulate very much so if you play for long enough you end up with just 2-3 people on ur server if that. last time it happened to me i used the last 2 hours of playtime to go around and capture every workshop i could and just farm the plans
---
How can you call it clickbait? I called it a conspiracy theory and you cite your reasons as uniformed and and wild speculation. Like, what would satisfy your definition of a conspiracy theory? What should I have done better?
---
I feel ya. I have more perks and points dedicated to ballistic rifles than anything else, but when the shit hits the fan I always have to fall back on unarmed to save my skin. 
---
Not sure if rifles are underpowered or unarmed/melee is overpowered, but something has gotta change. 
---
The damage numbers go up when you take off the mirv launcher because the damage numbers are per nuke, so you have to multiply the lower number by 6 for the mirv launcher.
---
Well going off of some advice im going to move toward a melee build, so once I have a few points in that then i may give this a look!
---
Teaming doesn't work for me at all.  I get the invite and click on it and nothing happens.  I have a couple of team based perks that I cant' use.
---
I will be very disappointed if they release the other raider armors as an atom shop pack or something. 
---
The main reason I don't think they will do this is because each of those armors have unique mods and stats. So they would literally have to make them skins of the base raider armor and that seems a bit dumb when they could just port the Fo4 files like everything else.. but you never know. Money is everything sometimes. 
---
As for the trapper helmet... i'm kinda wondering if its just extremely rare or if its not in at all. I saw a post about someone finding the marine helmet yesterday and up until then I was under the impression it wasn't in the game based on everyone saying they've never seen it. Helmets in this game seem super rare in general. So there is still hope for that i think. 
---
Honestly, they might just be trying to make sure they get theirs. I got so used to people snagging them because I am not a melee god that I tend to dash in mid-fight and loot a few bodies before they do.
---
I suggest moderation. You only need what, one mass and fluid per flux? Take a handful and then step back and let others get some. Unless you're building something that needs it, just take a few and chill. I have 14 stable crimson flux for making more prime ammo if I need it, and don't bother looting until everyone else leaves now because I have nothing that needs the flux.
---
Also, if you're desperate and/or not solo-capable, keep an eye out for meat piles. I've found about half my stock of masses and fluids from those, as some folks either farm legendaries and don't check, or miss a body in the pile.
---
Bless you for your spoiler tag. 
---
Get this man 1,000,000 Doge! 
---
Good source of food is a  nuked whitesprings.  Ionized meat doesnt spoil.
---
There's other requirements - you have to wear different outfits and be in a group for most of them.  I tossed out doing it just cause it was way too much trouble.
---
The lighthouse quest version also gives you an experience buff.
---
Lol... yeah... a cold... right.
---
Thanks for the offer but my teaming doesn't work at all.  I would be glad to team with anyone if it worked.
---
I met the one with a bunch of over protective wild mongrels
---
yup
---
I use the suitcases at Train Stations, FYI.
---
I thought it would be cool if player vending was similar to how ESO does it. By that I mean you join your faction of choice (BoS, enclave, free states, etc...) and you have bidding wars for the most popular spots and whatever faction wins gets that area for the week. I know it can't work that way since servers are so small, but I liked that about ESO. 
---
&gt;so destroying their base for 10 caps makes you the asshole
---
unless they are one of those ass hats who parks their base right up to the back side of the Whitesprings Golf Club and aren't even around to claim the kills and you accidentally tag their base while trying to kill the mob around you... Then it is your god give right to do all the damage to that base you can because now you are wanted because some ass-hat had to try to hog all the kills with 6 rocket launchers and 4 laser turrets mk 3 or whatever they are... 
---
Xbox One X here and no crashes in 3 hours last night. I am sorry for your issues, but they are not affecting everyone on the platform.
---
I'm a 28 yr old girl, on PC. Just recently realized my mic mute button doesn't work so I've been running around broadcasting all my thoughts to the world on area chat. If you ever hear someone giggling at a Protection talking, or singing along really badly to Sixteen Tons, it might be me. 
---
I'd love to start the game as a Ghoul or a Super Mutant or just a person who grew up outside of a vault. I want to find or make a homemade pipboy that is scrapped together. I want to experience the world from a different perspective then a vault dweller. I agree with you mate!
---
That would be awesome. Especially if they can animate the arm switching the actual tapes. 
---
Funkos of who? Rose? Like, there aren't many iconic characters to emulate. 
---
WORDOMANCER
---
Yeah you would have been slaughtered for sure. You want to be in the 20s at least when fighting those things. That or have a team.
---
Who says this when playing a fallout game?Wrong game for you my dude!
---
This almost never happens to me, maybe 3 time in 300 hrs. I wonder what the prob is. 
---
Why would Alex call YOU to say IM crazy? Your story just doesnt add up, mr galexi
---
Damn straight. I accidentally became wanted on two occassions, once because I accidentally shot someone's base during a firefight with ghouls and the other time I don't even know how I became wanted. Both times I dropped off all my junk (except for maybe 1 item such as 1 Pre-War Money or 1 Black Titanium if I'm feeling generous), I take off my life-saving gear and perks, and then go find someone to kill me so that I can lose the stupid 10 cap bounty.
---
Ooo I think I hit a pressure point XD You're lazy for not joining a team knowing that it will allow you to reconnect to a server you decide to nuke 100%. That is lazy and stupid. Your shit post was removed and not one person agreed with your stupidity. Please talk about real life more you seem to know so much about it, is there a window in your parent's basement, is that how you're experiencing it??
---
The longshoreman outfit isn‚Äôt the overalls it‚Äôs the yellow slicker and it‚Äôs a lot rarer. 
---
and how are you suggesting bethesda differentiates between the two? The dupe bug can happen to people accidentally with a number of items, not just tato plants
---
Duping is cheating. Cheating in a game like this is cheating yourself. You're an idiot if you cheat your way through the game then complain about said game. I mean, whatever, it's your money. Just seems real stupid and lightweight pathetic
---
a third nuke!
---
I‚Äôve heard that people that use them also have small hands.
---
Were you ‚Äúwanted‚Äù? Because if you were everyone else is hidden on your map. Happened to me when I accidentally shot someone‚Äôs base.
---
This whole time I though it was bandits
---
Same. MFer even told me it had been checkpointing along the way.
---
NOPE. Worst mission ever to have to f'ing repeat.
---
No idea.  I'd like to think so, but I'm not holding my breath.
---
Maybe logon to Bethesda from a pc?
---
He was the chosen one, he was meant to destroy the sith not join them he was supposed to bring balance to the force not leave it darkness
---
&gt; I'm glad someone with first hand knowledge stepped up.
---
Why? Because he posted it on Reddit? Do you believe everything everyone on the internet says?
---
If you're playing solo with guns, make sure you get some Gunsmith and mod up your weapons. If you haven't been scrapping guns for mods then get started.
---
Stick around the Forest area until it's too easy. Crouch-move everywhere if you're really worried about getting jumped.
---
Ha! I guess I never really thought of this... But i'm guessing they could release the x01 prototype... uhm... graham, the ultracite armor, perhaps an autobot ? I don't know hah
---
I've never met another person with an irrational fear of moths, I thought I was just nuts
---
Still looking for a nice home spot for me and Ringo the flamingo lol found a nice spot at whitesprings but we'll nukes don't mix well with Ringo. Going to look and see if there's a nice place near Summerville and uncanny caverns. Ringo needs to stay safe.
---
Don't be mean, bro
---
i try to find that perfect balance of "Okay, hairstyles are cool and all but 90% of the high level playerbase are wearing something that covers it"
---
so essentially, you pay 800 atoms (or 8$) for something you'll most likely hardly see. i went with 150 so people could buy it in bulk, like say a triple mohawk, braided hair (something like MCU's thor before his haircut in ragnarok) and maybe some sort of wacky hairstyle. all that would go for 450, you get more bang for your buck
---
From the number of ghouls in there, I suspect the Chinese already tried that.
---
Everything is so much less scary when you can cripple it. The wonders of explosives and Enforcer.

Pretty much proof that it does happen until you complain on social media. It was "impossible" until all the sudden it was ok. Like you said, im sure its not the norm, but it does absolutely happen to some of us.

You know what would fix most of this? A list from bethesda. Known issues and upcoming features.

I didn't get any email, I just went looking.  I bought 76 for the PC online

It seems to be when managing my inventory at the moment. 
---
I'm leveling an alt with no questing for this exact reason. Can't wait for the flaming SMG
---
The question is, will Bethesda now ban my account if I use the Fixt patch for FO1?
---
Yes, Make it so!
---
Seriously, subnautica and killing floor 2 both did/do this for a reason!
---
Density, lots of legendaries and lots of enemies for more chances at getting nuke zone materials
---
also, high-level ghouls are easier to deal with since they're fairly squishy and have no ranged (outside of wendigo's)
---
Show me proof
---
My 10:
---
1) I want to be able to send a friend invite to my friend, and have him receive it. Or visa versa, I'm not picky. 
---
2) Non-pipe ballistic weapons to be more viable. There's a hundred different receiver mods for 100 different guns, but only hardened pipe rifle is viable and only if you get all rifleman and handgun perk cards. 
---
3) Energy weapons to be more viable. Again, hundreds off options in the game, but none of them are truly an option.
---
4) Better base defenses. 
---
5) I'm going to use another wish on being able to play with my friend.
---
6) Legendary hunter riffles and pipe rifles.
---
7) More CAMP options. Love what's in there so far, but variety is great. Especially more lighting options. 
---
8) Food refrigeration. I'd spend a lot more time gathering food and crafting the "specialty" recipes if I could stash some of the rarer ingredients without them turning to poop. At this point so many of the recipes are near useless because the involve ingredients that are nowhere near each other.
---
9) In game text chat.
---
10) More visibility on what is weighing so much in my stash/inventory. Maybe a total at the top of each tab. My mind just can't wrap around what's currently in my stash actually hitting 600lbs...
---
Why do you want the Mr. Fuzzy caps? 
---
my cap is right next to for mcclintocks firing range. when i hear someone shooting there doing the quest i run over and beckon them to me hoping they'll follow me. if you take like 2 steps past the fence you can see my buildings. i run inside my garage and do a heart emote and so many people have just ran away without using any of my free water or stations and a few have just done no or angry emotes. makes me so sad

Well at least you made a loont in the comments..

What level bounty would deserve this punishment?
---
* Girly scream
---
* Beat up by wife
---
* Scared of moths
---
Hmmm...
---
it might take a bit to happen, personally i feel the prices i set are alright, definetly better than 1000 atom fatman paint or 800 blue and yellow paint for leather armor
---
Bottom right of the map is fissure site prime. Pretty popular. hopefully not too spoilerish
---
Are the plans shared across characters? I would think no? I'm not interested in going through all that all over again, I kinda like the character I have now. 
---
You‚Äôre better off saving some caps and buying individual serums off people for around 1k each. Way better than playing the mutation lottery.
---
Explosive in general is OP. Bloodied explosive will out dps a TSE by quite a bit on the right build.
---
If orbital strike beacons weren't so expensive I'd be nuking every jackass who parks a dozen rocket turrets behind the Whitesprings Golf Club to steal every kill the instant it spawns.
---
Weightless combat armor hasn't been duped (I've still never seen any) and I'm trying to see if explosive crossbows exist.
---
Probably too late.  Although they are on sale right now.  But I have both steam, gog and now Bethesda.  I had the box in the day as well....  far too many copies.
---
Big change apparently that you can only have 1 datum at a time. Just did 6 turn ins and got the Initiate paint. Will keep going for the Knight one
---
Like no stacking items?
---
Update: Remove mine.
---
I'd rather wait until after the phantom water purifier camp bug is resolved. I have two of them taking up 18% of my budget. I'll get back to you later on.
---
Also suggest, to be fair, not doing something like this until that and similar camp bugs are resolved. That way everyone has a fair chance with full budget.
---
Mothman seems to constantly visit my house but always leaves when I see him so I never get the chance to fight him but looks cool when he flies 
---
Disappointment overwhelming is your reward
---
The only thing you can do better is delete it.  
---
Bottom right is Fissure Prime.
---
You can so see nukes fall from the sky.
---
Excavator armor too
---
Somehow I have around 100x more steel than any other material.  If you take over a workbench that has waves of robot attackers, you don't even need to bother with the steel harvester - you'll just accumulate more steal from looting all the destroyed robots.
---
im gonna pick a video game i never played and go post a thread their subreddit..thanks for the inspiration
---
[yeah I know](https://m.imgur.com/gallery/kfWc1T7) 
---
Nothing like realizing you still have Big Sale equipped instead of Blood Sucker and that's why all those blood packs you just drank were wasted.
---
Lol.  Yup.  Did the same.  
---
I am trying to figure out a good camp plan too. My camp keeps getting attacked by Super Mutants, seemingly no matter where I move. I got the Brahmin pen recently and I want to protect my moo moo! I'm hoping to build a house around a central courtyard where my moo moo can live.
---
100% and you can tell Bethesda made sure CAMPs wouldn‚Äôt turn the PvP into some Fortnite type bullshit where you just try to build stuff quick while engaging. They‚Äôll likely remain very careful to not let it get that way with any changes, if they do make changes. 
---
Been playing all day not a single disconnect on PC. 
---
 I can neither confirm nor deny that. One of the players in our group was traded them for other items. He didn't think to ask how when he saw them in the players inventory. But I'll check again and see if anyone knows.
---
To get the outfit but the quests are glitched im grinding for them when they work.. 
---
You say this when it's no longer fun due to the level hump. 
---
Already did this and it destroyed a wanted player.  Funny thing is I put up a dozen of the cutouts pointing to the door. 
---
"It's a trap!" Never entered his mind I guess. 
---
I need a functional shop though. I only knew what happened after I traveled back as I used it as a discount travel spot. Guy was still there laughing his ass off. 
---
Btw, do you still get caps if something else of yours like turrets kill a wanted player when you're on the other side of the map? 
---
gross dude
---
The only problem I see are people (like me) sorting through 5
---
76 stimpacks to get to something else. But as far as weapons stacking in bags, yeah that's some BS. 
---
easy trick - 
---
port to Whitespring Bunker Service Entrance
---
Check for Jet Pack
---
Grab one Datum
---
Port to Fort Venture
---
Turn it in for 25 caps, 350 exp. 
---
(My camp is right next to venture so I actually make caps doing this)
---
&lt;3
---
The caps reward offsets the travel costs; 
---
Not the best for exp but better than not getting any (like in other farms)
---
Not worth my effort to read about a conspiracy theory of someone who has not played the game. 
---
I don't use pistols, shotguns, or heavy weapons so I can't "use" the ammo. Also most players run away when I approach them to give them the ammo as I don't have a mic (well I have a mic I don't turn on because I have a newborn) I had a guy "give" me a bunch of ammo, it was all useless to him and it was useless to me. So the bag sat there, unused.
---
I got the Tux Bundle because I'm gonna Roll an alt that is James Bond of the Wasteland! Expert with pistols and always wears a tux! Dapper AF!
---
The Wise Mothman appears at the end of the Evclave Event at the Lighthouse. 
---
Ok so you can buy the outfit with those tokens? 
---
I have a feeling I know this one... if you load into the game in another location, and then fast travel to your CAMP, you'll load there before your CAMP loads. If your mat was anywhere on the structure, you'll fall through, either falling to your death or getting stuck in a foundation or something. They still haven't fixed it, hopefully they're working on it.
---
I still have mine carried over from the beta, and it only works if I put it on solid ground, and even then only as a fast travel target -- never on game load.
---
melee is way too overpowered. if they made perception increase ballistic damage then it would even out i think. strength is just too good of a stat to use on top of 30-90% damage buff cards
---
This happens because it can be any super mutant camp, and there are dozens of them so every time you log it just marks a different one 
---
Cap player damage against other players. Problem solved. No matter how ridiculously OP your build is it doesn't matter if you can't deal it. 
---
you wont be disappointed =D 
---
In my experience, almost all min/Max endgame builds are going to have at least 8 luck, for Starched Genes, Class Freak, and Bloody Mess.
---
If you're talking automatic heavy weapons, you're also going to want to seriously consider One Gun Army, and also definitely give Luck of the Draw some consideration. If you only take one of those, you'll be at 11 Luck.
---
Maybe ultracite as well and any others that come out
---
No you just can‚Äôt stack weapons 
---
Not sure if you're PC but weirdly I have only been able to team up with one person so far, it bugs out for everyone else. I just keep area or auto chat on and we can still run around together at least. 
---
It just happened to me on PC. I can't complete it again as the Sargent Gutsy just gives me the Soldier Certificate again and the training terminals just give "access denied".
---
I'd love to main a hazmat suit.
---
Id hope so
---
Try and stick to the north west of the map for a bit. The enemies have lvl caps there, so you wont see lvl 68 scorched and super mutants like you do in the eastern part of the map. 
---
My knowledge of funkpoops is very limited. 
---
Yup but all of it is 400 tokens and you only get 3 per game plus it's quest is glitchy
---
I  made a stair case out of tables the other night cause thats all i could do in the public workshop.. i though this video was that... this was way better. 
---
No, plans are not shared. The stuff you purchase from the atom store is though. But you could get the plan on the alt then trade it through a friend yo get it to your main.
---
Ugh! Horrible when you realise that there are lions on the horses killing them and that's why they're screaming!!!
---
That‚Äôs crazy, well good luck on the grind. 
---
burned through 100 plastic crafting shotgun shells.
---
didn't have crafting perk enabled. 
---
sad day
---
Do you really need punctuation to tell you where to pause?
---
Where is the BOS mod? Just random?
---
God forbid the mods actually do something about it... if I see 8000 more threads with titles demanding game changes that people have been demanding since launch, I'm gonna lose it.
---
The Association would like to review your CAMP. Are you available now?
---
Killed my first scorchbeast last night with a gatling laser.  Took 8 cores  and I got nothing because it disintegrated into ash that dropped below the ground.
---
start reporting the YT videos for TOS violations... not sure if it'll make a diff but it's a start
---
I am. 
---
Conspiracy theories, by definition, are clickbait. They're meant to get your attention and appeal to emotion. Conspiracy theories are also, normally, wild speculation or cherry-picking facts in order to meet the intent of the author.
---
I get that you're "thinking outside the box", but there aren't enough facts or personal comments to support it. Hence, downvoted.
---
This is very true. Coupling explosive with basically any decent legendary affix (I've got a Furious, Explosive Handmade that absolutely shreds) is super powerful.
---
Two Shot is fine on its own.
---
Molotov's FTW.
---
But I agree, it can be really annoying.
---
Was it really complicated? You know this because your a Bethesda Dev?  It's pathetic when you can look back at older MMOs, uo/swg had fully customizable homes and entire player towns.  Apparently dialup and older rigs were so op that devs can't figure out how to do this with modern bandwidth.  
---
What are the best crops to grow? I'm thinking about going the herbivore route too (from you said, it seems perfect). Do you just eat spoiled vegetables? Are melons the way to go? 
---
i mean, it seems like they could fix this if they just created a new stack automatically once you hit a stack of 255.
---
Thanks if you have any ill buy them 3 caps per token 150 tokens for a power armor 
---
Thats a problem I had doing a quest for a sword(?) I think it was the mistress questline. That was truly a pain in my ass.
---
Tempted to just do the whitesprings spot I found and have a neon sign that I'll update everytime my camp gets nuked. But I don't wanna lose Ringo he's my only friend. I swear I'm not crazy
---
I hope to be more like you and your friends as time goes on. Right now the only person I constantly play with is an old high school friend, but he's got a family and can't play as much, so typically it's just me. I'm only level 112, and I haven't run into any griefers, but I like to think if I did and I were in a position to help out, I would.
---
I agree to that; I've never had weapons stack, even when I make LARs to break down for mods. Does the glitch require boards? If so can't they just make boards not stack?
---
So many options but would love a sorchbeast pop figure despite how much I hate them for being so annoying
---
I crafted like 20 and vendored them the other day. On PC though.
---
At the same time the people who spread the word make it a serious issue that needs more attention. If they kept it to themselves it would never be fixed, thought it certainly isn‚Äôt the spreader‚Äôs intent to spread the word/have it fixed
---
Nah. I think we should need to pick and choose.
---
Yes. Look for him on map away from points of interest. That will usually be them at their base.
---
I don‚Äôt have any at the moment but it‚Äôs not the first time I see people asking for these so I just wanted to know what they were for.
---
It‚Äôs good you stopped there, I continued and am dumber then before 
---
I'm not sure where I found it, but I believe I saw a thread/video recently indicating that it was available from the Responders vendor in Grafton.
---
They all seem to be able to review 2 shot explosive weapons. Seems like they all have "kind friends" who give them these things.
---
Yeah, seems like I should stock up on these. 
---
Ahh OK :)
---
Use the registers at the vendors. Infinite space and I'm not sure how long it lasts, but I find stuff there all the time. 
---
Left 20 fusion cores and 500 .308 ammo I  one once. When I decided to go full melee. Already had like 40 cores eating stash space. Might drop more later today. I use the right register at BoS vendor.
---
"And the name that said on him was, Death, and Hell followed with him.
---
If I see 25,000 more sarcastic comments I'm gonna fucking lose it.
---
I remember seeing a token booth that I could interact with but I dont remember where it was and if it actually does anything. 
---
Also don‚Äôt nuke the space station. Nothing special there either. 
---
There‚Äôs a fissure site next to Vault 96 I would be curious about. 
---
None of them are required some are detrimental others can be game breaking. I have a pretty standard power armored heavy guns build and I do alright with none. 
---
I'm not 100% sure, but I think items in containers last a lot longer in game and persist if you log out/dc
---
It's a good courtensy to switch to melee. You are right that player was an asshole. Next time follow him and purposly trow yourself in his face before he shoots so he can killhimself with his own TSE.
---
I think its a mix. I was playing with a dude who was raining mini nukes and destroying everything but he gave us time to tag. It was the most fun i had at whitesprings. Plus its real easy to get swarmed there and some people are bitter and dont want to share. I think people are just in a rush though and want to clear the sections asap. Thats why i shoot them now instead of trying to bash them.
---
My team just raged so kinda need people tho
---
I don't like using them? I main rifles and their perks.
---
Simple fix from Bethesda's end would be to prevent perks from Stacking, which I assumed was the case initially, just like Chems.
---
I am working on gathering Legendary Polished Metal &amp; Combat armor with a variety of effects, but picked up a few Marine Armor legendary pieces yesterday that have me rethinking that.
---
I haven't found any Scout Armor yet, but like the look, and would go that way if I could find all the parts.
---
Sounds good.
---
Got a TSE handmade?
---
This is the water, and this is the well. Drink full, and descend. The horse is the white of the eyes, and dark within.
---
Yeah as a potential PVP player I agree with 13. Workshops need to be balanced better with a greater sense of loss/gain. Splitting servers would be good if they can give some actual PVP incentive. The whole current system is basically an after thought that really does nothing for either player type. By offering no rewards PVP is basically destined to be a "screwing over other players for fun" mechanic which has really low universal appeal.
---
I've seen the Mothman twice and I'm only level 25. I just meander aimlessly. I was too chicken to shoot him. 
---
Lol, wtf is this dude thinking being sponsored by a site like that. 
---
I‚Äôm no fan of 76 and typically don‚Äôt have an issue with YouTube calling it out on its faults but that‚Äôs just idiot. 
---
That's better than the lvl 30 guy with his mic on at Watoga last night coughing every 15 seconds.
---
The service entrance also has a rad shower.
---
Yellowcake is not too hard to find. I think they are worth it. Love seeing that big boom.
---
Was it you that originally placed down the water purifiers? Or did someone do it for you?
---
Pictures?
---
Martial Artist makes it *shoot* faster?
---
Well shit.
---
I thought it made it reload faster.
---
Time to change my build around.
---
&gt;Are we just going to not talk about how most of the in game atom challenges are completely non-functional?
---
It's already been talked about. Sorry you didn't get the invite.
---
If you just train yourself to look for plastic and you pretty much will end up with stacks of it. 
---
I remember I killed one without realizing it was a mothman..Goodtimes...
---
The snark is strong in this one.
---
S.H.O.P.S. 
---
  The __Store at Home Object Purchasing System__ or S.H.O.P.S. for short will allow you to place items on display for sale around the C.A.M.P. 
---
  This will allow the placement of objects around the C.A.M.P. with a set cap value for other players to purchase.  The S.H.O.P.S. should include, but not be limited to, glass display cases, weapon displays, armor stands, and vendor machines.
---
  Players going for a more aesthetic C.A.M.P. could choose to set unreasonable cap prices so as to deter purchasing.  
---
  The S.H.O.P.S. would ensure a more immersive RPG for years to come.
---
Zero. The law must be respected.
---
not gonna lie, that actually looks sort of pimp.
---
looks kind of like some knid of Armored Core, shoulder mounted .50 cal.
---
All he needs is a jetpack and a handheld bazooka and the image is complete
---
I built mine at 35 a couple days ago and it worked for the quest.
---
Whoa where is a monster mask at?
---
Remember to take a break you can get lost in that game for hours lol 
---
Yeah I nuked the airport there and the flower selection was really great.  A decent amount of Scorched too but they're pretty spread out.
---
Fallout 76 subreddit doesn‚Äôt allow pics, look it up
---
had the same issue as well
---
Bethesda why don't we have cow armor? LITERALLY UNPLAYABLE
---
The whole time playing fallout 4, the biggest problem with settlements was I'd start building some fancy elaborate vault 88 or something, and after problem hours into it, is just stop. Because what was the point? Nicest but me was ever going to see it. And the only part I was going to ever really see was the fastest route between the entrance, bed, crafting station, and trunk where I kept all my great loot i wasn't ever going to use.
---
So now that random people can see my camp, wander over, look around, it actually gives me a reason to want to make something cool, and not just a 2x2 block shack full of beds and craft benches. So that's my reason for leaving my does unlocked. Not because of any kind of unwritten role that you have to.
---
Irrelevant perhaps but you'll have an easier time to maintain food by planting some corn and razorgrain and make soups out of it. Cheap, easy and water and food all in one with decent buffs. And if you're using Good Doggy you could replace that with one rank Slow Metabolize something. 
---
I can't really help you but I can commiserate... I'm also lvl 19 and basically have no direction on what to do.  I was leveling up so fast in the beginning and now it's ground to a halt.  I have no time to read every single post here or read a wiki front-to-back... but there seem to be no good web resources to act as a general guide (like, at level 20 you should be doing these quests and should have these items, at level 30 you should have these perks and focus on this area of the map).  Instead I login and waste an hour or two with no real gains made to my character.  
---
Can we have enemies just be on a fixed spawn - respawn timer and none of this respawn when player enters the area. Its fucking ridiculous to have to clear a area then be overwhelmed 3 1/2 minutes later when another player fast travels to the area. 
---
Dang, well gl man and have fun. One last tip is that quest rewards scale to your lvl so before you turn a quest in you can google the reward to see if you would want that weapon later down the line. 
---
Ex: &gt;! The allrise you get for completing "mayor for a day !&lt;
---
Yeah it's certainly not a thing
---
right, so having the mod and having the plan and materials is the same thing.
---
they were giving you a light show ...
---
This guy has 10 treasure maps, he much be duping. 
---
I should have thought about that, damn :D 
---
What up lmao then there's a million posts that should be deleted
---
Wow cool bro
---
A stack of anti-armor, two-shot, and furious is devastating even when not cheesing pipe weapons. TSE is also blatantly overpowered to make my statement practically correct: I said "right weapons, perks and legendary effects". I never said it was balanced, well designed, terrible interesting, etc.
---
Energy weapons are indeed entirely non-viable, and either perk-stacked pipe explosive guns, or explosive shotguns are overwhelmingly dominant.
---
I never said the game was balanced, just that you can be highly (and IMO equally) viable using melee or the right ranged ballistic weapon. Game combat balance is blatantly garbage. To be honest, power armor makes so so incredibly tough I think durability is moot regardless of playstyle for PVE. As long as you've got a reserve of stimpaks and cola you're not going to die in PVE.
---
You can burn through that ammo quickly with some automatic receivers and get back to your special snowflake "build".
---
I was getting attacked by one the other night. Never seen one before. Laughed, panicked, and bolted. Luckily it got distracted by a few scorched which it promptly dispatched but gave me enough time to escape. 
---
Agreed. I‚Äôm selling 3* sickles and combat knifes because that ski sword is so effective. 
---
*It just works* something someone said. 
---
First thing I can think of is - cook everything. Early on, you should be seeing a decent amount of animals. Wild mongrels, mole rats, etc. Always loot 'em, always cook the meat if there's a cooking station in the area. Might seem obvious, but food will get you HP, and if you cook it, you won't take rads from it. Bonus, cooking gets you XP.  
---
Second - always hit a bed before you log out, so that when you log back in, you're "Well rested". That bonus XP will help. If you're really motivated, play a musical instrument long enough to get "Well Tuned" - that gives a bonus to your AP regeneration rate.  
---
Third - put your camp somewhere useful and farm it all the time. Fast travelling to your camp is free, fast traveling to teammates is free. Take advantage of it. If you can drop a water purifier at your camp, you will always be able to get more.  
---
Fourth - Take your time. There's no need to blitz through all of the stories. I mean, you can if you want, but there's no rush. When you hit endgame and have finished all of the main questlines, it won't matter if you're level 51 or 192. You stop getting SPECIAL points at level 50, so if you plan smartly and are having fun, then everything after 50 is just gravy. Which leads me to ...  
---
Fifth - go look at the wiki and figure out how you want your SPECIAL now. Remember that certain cards aren't even available until a certain level, and figure out what you want your character to be like when you get to that point. Keep that in mind and work at it. (But don't be afraid to change, because you can now re-spec your points.)  
---
Have fun!
---
Me too.  Not sure why some people don't like it.  It must depend on what level you get it at or what your other options are at the time.
---
I forgot about those mats! Yes, I‚Äôd love to have them back. 
---
I'm in.  
---
I will be happy with even a 1 cap score if you don't like my C.A.M.P., I just want other people to see my nice little West Virginia home.   
---
PM me your PSN name or ask for mine in message, and i'll let you in and give you a tour
---
You can pay a link to the picture if you imgur then it shows up here it's simple a lot of people do it in this subreddit I guess they aren't supposed to be
---
It sounds way dumber than it is. 
---
I mean like we actually have that painting in our house. When people started making a meme out of it we all were like ‚Äúhold the fuck up, that‚Äôs hanging in our living room‚Äù
---
Great you still live in her house that she left you I'm sure. You have an anger issue and can't stand being wrong. I can talk however I want cuz I'm a big boy now and take care of myself. Sorry you can't come at me irl I would love to put you in your place. 
---
I am also a victim of missing Ultracite\_power\_armor. Is is armor or is there a schematics where you can do it. 
---
But I hope that someday option to replay old story missions after you have completed them or at least after you have done all main story missions. In this way people will get their armor set and it would be nice fun to do these old story missions after you have done everything else than give up on the game ;D
---
That quest i think ive already done but thank you for that bit of info! :D
---
I really did, used the small letters and put it next to my 4 deep decon shower alley into my unlocked base with unlocked purifiers and plants inside. It's lit up really well I get visitors all the time! If you're on PC you can always come by and chill!
---
Dyer chem, loot strangler flowers / pods. Pods are like seeds without flowers, they grow on stumps and roots . Pretty sure the Pods give the swamp flower

---
majorly important perks: blocker, bloody mess, starched genes, class freak
---
if you want to use Power armour swap serendipity for more perception
---
Wut about the disconnects? Is that the radiation making you pass out?
---
Wow cool bro, damn shit, r/madlads
---
Thanks but I'm going to keep playing the game the way I want to play. Nice use of snowflake, really solidifies your point.
---
They should probably put something ingame &amp; in video form. Generally Bethesda needs to take credit for successes a LOT more if they want to change player perception for the better
---
With 2-shot even without using vats, even if i zoom, i still do barely any damage.  I have to be in melee range basically to get full damage.
---
Between that and that 10mm SMG that lights shit on fire yeah. Two great rewards. 
---
That sucks, but the wendigo *can* drop a legendary weapon if take one down. They arent as rare as the flatwoods monster or the mothman, but still is a cryptid
---
Possibly top of the world 
---
There is a token collector around some abandon mines in the south, I haven't cashed in anything, but my impression is that it gives out raw materials.
---
Thats the quest at the robot city, are you sure you did it? Its pretty hard. 
---
In an apocalypse, internet is sketchy at best
---
Can I ask what kind of weapon you use? I assume a lot of melee people have a surplus of extra steel.
---
I wonder...if it ‚Äúunteaches‚Äù you the plan upon leaving the station, I wonder if disconnecting while still working at the station could get the plan to stick permanently? 
---
And that way includes incessant ranting at the developers to buff your special snowflake way you want to play?
---
I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs necessarily greifing, but it‚Äôs definitely a ‚Äúfuck everyone else,‚Äù mentality. I guess when you‚Äôre farming for a specific three star legendary, you have to rack up as many kills as you can, but the chances are so small that I don‚Äôt see the point in screwing the other players over.
---
No, fix that cuz fux that.
---
Close to the vault are some shacks that have weapons and food. The overseers stash box also has useful items. In one of the mailboxes in flatwoods, you can find an emergency requisition that will drop supplies. The radio tower to offer the drop is great Flatwoods, up on a hill to the left of the town. Flatwoods also had all the benches you'll need to improve armor, weapons, make food etc so you don't have to build your camp right away.
---
Exactly this. Thats why i made my camp when i logged in the other day because after many trips looking for wood it felt like atleast some sort of achievement when it was complete, as bad as the camp looks its still mine.
---
I dunno, a desperate dude would do something like this in an attempt to get laid...
---
The issue with mod scrapping isn't people scrapping them, it's them being auto scrapped in crafting
---
I have a "Weightless" Combat Leg that shows .06, a "Weightless" Polished Metal Chest Piece at .4, and a Weightless Marine RT arm that shows 0, I have not tried applying the Ultra light build, but instead opt for the Higher DR.
---
The perk card equip max is 15 I‚Äôm pretty sure
---
I immediately thought of Far Cry 5
---
Yeah, it just kind of donned on me as well.
---
Moi-m√™me. Je peux rien faire... Ils apparaissent blancs et je peux pas les d√©truire... 
---
No there's some stupid perk to make it reload faster - I believe its called Lock &amp; Load.  No reason to use that perk ever - Martial Artist is the one you want.
---
There is a quest in that theme park in the Toxic Valley....
---
Uhhh alright man. Have a good one, you obviously need it.
---
Honestly, there's a veritable ocean of shit that people are "Dear Bethesda"ing. Expect actual problems to be drowned out by fanboys thinking that Beth gives a fuck about their ideas.
---
Nice, might be worth carrying around just for fun with the right perks. Every once in a while i get the drop on a grouped up mob and really wish i had it on me.
---
Edgy, aren‚Äôt ya. 
---
Still, it‚Äôs practically nothing weight wise. 
---
Nope. You're right. Atom shop icon.
---
I'll have to check when im online tonight but the name of the quest rings a bell.
---
I'll check that out, thanks.
---
Myself. I can not do anything ... They appear white and I can not destroy them ...
---
Yeah, agree. Sometimes even with auto stims, I get killed and gotta do all that stuff again. Hate those cores. Actually all I hate is the auto reinforcements...come on. After I've killed 100 robots, I should have some peace to  launch. I'm still loving this game tho. No matter how many hours I pour into it, I always find something I want to do. :)
---
Only thing sexier then you is that machine gun can we not or the paint on our two shot explosive it's so beautiful
---
If they don't do more than this and at least introduce more maps then I don't see this game lasting a year. 
---
Indeed there would be a crap ton.
---
Enjoy living life as a heartless fucked up piece of shit troll.
---
Buttholes like that keep getting me kicked from the server. 
---
Go to the top of every lookout tower you find. Leaning over the railing pops up an activate option and adds locations to your map.
---
At the war reenactment place in the north you can trade in some tokens for a tour(I think, haven't actually done it)
---
If you can't handle the heat, stay out of the fucking kitchen.
---
Bethesda no have glitches Bethesda perfect those are features! 
---
Wait, they do? Damn, I didn‚Äôt know this, thanks!
---
Any time you craft anything there's a popup that says what is being scrapped. Sure it shouldn't scrap mods, but if you pay attention it never will
---
I love your voice &lt;3
---
Oh, yeah! The pain is real, I feel you.
---
My only advice is to just keep experimenting. It may kill is a little inside, but people are discovering new ways to use building pieces with regularity! Even within the harsh and cruel confined that Bethesda has cursed is with. Master and Mistress "item is clipping" and "item is floating". Their stinging red text be the deadliest enemy of them all.
---
How prevalent are griefers in general? Hopefully nothing like RDR2 online haha...
---
That sucks for the guy that accidentally gets wanted by picking a lock on a toolbox in a workshop...or accidentally taps someone else's stuff and gets a 10 cap bounty. XD
---
Yep I have mine just south of Seneca rocks and spawn outside of my build area, under the map, luckily it‚Äôs quite easy for me to just jump back inside the map but still frustrating
---
It would be nice if some of the perks would be passive that they still give bonuses(base building, crafting, hacking picklockin), but wont take any slots in special.
---
Same here. My fiance always spawns inside the supports beneath my house while I get stuck between some stairs outside. Would love to get those mats back.
---
Just a bug
---
HA! Came here to write almost the exact same comment. And in response to your comment below about not finishing, my favorite Pwent scene actually comes from one of the later novels, *Gauntlgrym*. "Me king!"
---
I have no inkling as to water you talking about
---
I think /u/PaxInBello85 nailed it. I remember doing one of the quests, the reward was like 10 of those tokens. The end of the quest is to use them at one of the vending machines, it gave me like 3-4 raw materials.
---
For evidence. To prove the post isn't made up.
---
Here's my fix for this, place your first letter then place another letter over top of that letter. Now place your next letter by snapping it and it should force it to stay straight. Continue doing this till you are done. The I requires some extra work to get it to be place correctly.
---
Weird flex but okay.
---
Being smart isn't being a troll. It's okay little man go bully a neighborhood child. 
---
I made a ticket over 5 weeks ago and it was ignored and then eventually deleted a few days ago. I commented on it daily asking for someone to help em, and to keep it alive. But they just ignored it and kept marking it as "resolved". I had to keep commenting on it to make it back to "unresolved". It was a daily battle to keep it alive. Disgusting.
---
sell junk before you scrap it. Each item is worth at least 1
---
Remember how they said everything you could unlock through the atom shop you could unlock by just playing in game..... kinda feel like that was a lie
---
the big thing with the Energy Weapons is most things have very low, if any, energy resistance (they tear through super muties) but yeah, there isn't any reason the Lever Action should deal more than them with the same round used in combat rifles, or that assault/home made should have higher base damage than them.  After All the US military was replacing conventional weapons with the laser/plas weapons for the exact reason that they were better, lighter weight, more punch, no recoil (which makes the amount of recoil they do have fuggin hilarious) and more efficien amunition storage (one cell with enough shots to equal a magazine is lighter than a 24 round mag with rounds in it, not to mention much more compact)
---
tl:dr, all guns need to be reworked, as the 'dlc' guns from 4 are just better than all their counter parts, and blackpowder weapons do stupid high damage despite being replaced due to how 'bad' they were when compared to something better
---
Exactly. You have to pay attention. This is good.
---
The nice thing about PA is it fits in your back pocket, take it out when you need it or use it all the time, up to you. Many go with pure armour builds and don't use PA .. I would still carry it as backup.
---
Fusion cores are everywhere, don't worry about that, I probably have 60+ if not more and they last much longer now. Also if you change worlds in PA, it recharges your core (likely to be fixed in the future), but even without, I never have a issue finding cores.
---
Every frame I come across, I steal the core and leave the rest, a lot of us do that, so you likely just not finding them because they already go raided. But you will find many generators with them still in and they will get repopulated.
---
Can you not use a trip wire or pressure plate instead of the switch? 
---
Explosive shotgun. Explosive booblehead. Overdrive....  Boom kill on first land.
---
Rifle/shotgun.  I haven't really started crafting ammo though becaaaaause I have no lead.  If I was able to get lead easier, I'd probably have less steel ;)
---
careful..funkos are addictive
---
This is why I left it on the list, it breaks the immersion of the game and does not fit in theme or sound with the entire fallout library.
---
I still stand by the opinion that Sloop John B, would have been a better choice than Wouldn't it be nice.
---
Then save everyone the time and don't comment. 
---
More food for the ferals.
---
You didnt by chance notice a mushroom cloud? Or a red circle on the map?
---
Ah. I haven't used the Tesla rifle in weeks, but the one I did use shot an arc. I suppose there may be some sort of mod to change the way it shoots (like the plasma sprayer).
---
I'm interested in the trade but I believe my mg has a higher worth. Its the type of gun that can change your playstyle to ez mode lol. If you have a cherry to throw on top, we could make a deal today. Missing a couple serums (chameleon and adrenal reaction), and any caps that could help me get there would be great. Maybe a couple plans instead. Something else that has high value and low weight.
---
ok!
---
Go offline!  or use 3 proxies!
---
Oh, i know. Believe me.
---
I don't kill things too fast if I can help it.  Cuz it's mean :P 
---
Ypu have a fear of moths? Basically-a-butterfly, mouthless moths?
---
 remove the wall or do you just convert it into a doorway walkthrough and then turn it back into a wall?
---
At least spawn us at the door :( 
---
Almost 100 and not had one drop. I bought one off of Reddit with caps.
---
Pick up some nades.  That's what I do for Whitesprings runs.
---
As a high damage melee it's almost impossible to hit all of the ghouls at the golf club.  But a few nades later, got XP and loot from them all.  20-30 nades and you'll never run out in a single zone.  Plus all nades work for the 1 hit on groups.
---
Level 53 here, still don‚Äôt have one. 
---
I didnt know about the changing worlds, that will surely help me along the way haha. Thanks for all the info!
---
Wow. Do you create content on YouTube? 
---
Because you're just blindly speculating about elder scrolls. I fucking hate the internet. 
---
Not mine...
---
Yeah didn't think so, thanks for the info. At this point I am just taking it slow and doing a lot of this solo so maybe I'll find something else I like. I also read there is a chance for a rifle to spawn in Berkley Springs so I may try that too. 
---
I have found none. I am lvl116. Bought tse handmade and tse Gauss from a player via the market.
---
got lucky got a lvl 50  tse western revolver at about lvl 55
---
I want to request the ability to hide perk cards that are unslotted, which will then sort them to the right, so the ones I dont want to interact with often wont get in my way.
---
&amp;nbsp;
---
[Link to my thread from today with the details](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/ac7x0p/qol_suggestion_hideignore_perk_cards/)
---
And that wont result in you getting any kind of wanted level on yourself?
---
Well, raiders, for one. Part of the idea of the PA-Wasteland look is the breaking of social structures and norms. A big ass ugly tattoo in the middle of your forehead is exactly the sort of "I don't give a fuck, now watch me eat your liver" thing that OP wants, but then complains about.
---
Hey it's ok, theres just no need to go around throwing insults around willy nilly! However for future reference, if you are going to go around calling people stupid on the internet you may want to make sure you know the difference between your and you're because that could very easily backfire on you
---
I was using a Bloodied explosive gatling for a while. Seeing 4k+ damage per shot was fun, one of my fav builds
---
Face it. This game and subreddit is dead. Nobody cares about this garbage anymore. Not even Bethesda. They can‚Äôt even release a change log. 
---
If your on ps4 look me up.
---
Silune.
---
Your more than welcome to follow me around as well, or come grab me if your needing help, im always lookin for something to do besides the endless search for plastic, lead, steel, springs, and screws.
---
Remember...if you keep your party hat and happen to run into a pack of Feral Ghouls, put your party hat on and put your weapon away and run up to them. they will start dancing.
---
I only saw him once... and he just let me and this other dude shoot at him until he died. Pretty good loot and he literally didn‚Äôt attack us once 
---
At work but Google chameleon mutation you can bit it for 5k or get it randomly from radiation.  Wait till lol 32
---
Some of them do work but are just dumb - like the one asking you to scrap power armor parts...  you don't learn mods from them, scrapping them gives next to nothing in materials.  All this does is just cause more grief for others looking for PA parts.
---
That'd be a workable solution if it doesn't take thirty button presses to toggle on and off in the event someone attacks you.
---
I work in a production environment, in fact I have the final say on if something gets pushed to production. We also have a development environment that completely replicates production except user data. We have test systems that report data for the development  environment, these systems use the exact same hardware and software as the systems that report data to the production environment.
---
As for their  QA team, They need people who understand how the underlying technical mechanics of the game work. This way they can reproduce bugs that you would only be able to easily by having that knowledge.
---
They could just hire modders as contractors to do this after their day jobs. Modders understand the core concept of how the engine handles items, I've never seen a QA department where individual testers would understand things to that degree. The results of the patches do not make me think that Bethesda is an exception.
---
The ferns tend to grow under the trees so visit the copses to cop them flora farmer.  Tarberries can be found in some water areas that also provide it as do the pitcher plants but the ferns are easiest to gather.
---
I have to disagree.  I had carnivore, and now have herbivore.  Carnivore was far easier for me to maintain.  So many things drop meat.  I feel like I have to go out of my way to get veggies where meat just piles up in my inventory.  I'm constantly dropping meat on the ground while slowly chipping away at the soup i went out of my way to make earlier.
---
Is it the one for reviving people? I would follow some low levels around.
---
There‚Äôs no trick around it you have to kill the scorch queen or hang out while other people kill it but I‚Äôve been seeing a lot of low levels trying to do it and waste all there resources 
---
Summerville voting tents. The pencils. Damn you...
---
How‚Äôd you not die from Rads? üòÇ
---
I bought my first one about 2 weeks after launch. 
---
And then I got my next 20000 later that day üòâüòâ
---
 I would advise against a particular build myself. Certainly melee is strong but that's not a great reason to twist your whole build to it. Everything is strong built right and i recommend a balanced build for the first 40 levels or so. You can do whatever you want but balance explores all aspects of the game.
---
 I will pull out a sword for a bunch of Ghouls that get close but having them be mostly dead makes that less important. My Shotgun will have taken many and the rifle and explosives before that, many more.
---
 You can twist your build any way at all later, once you understand the game a bit better.  
---
- Fissure site prime: violet flux

- Whitespring: all other flux

I have figured out why us wastelanders collect PreWar Cash......Its toilet paper....that is all its good for.....we wipe our ass' on dead presidents.
---
when theres 5 workshops within 20 caps fast travel that are unowned i take offense to someone trying to take my cabins workshop thats within walking distance from my camp. if i saw someone who is constantly right next to a workshop they own i wouldnt even think of trying to steal it from them. 
---
either way i didnt really bitch about it, just called them douchebags and literally destroyed their will to live. 
---
Go buy the Handmade plans - lv 15 to 19 only though.
---
Take them all free caps and a mad duper 
---
I hope you're feeling better.
---
Did this by accident on a 3 star armor piece . Think I got like 20 caps for it and had to buy it back for like 940 ....
---
i run a melee build and discovered with enough AP Regen you really don't notice being over encumbered. (apart from never being able to fast travel)
---
I finally said screw it and accepted my fate and i just pick everything up... literally i have maybe 20 or 30 ski suits... they arent work shit.... those golf outfits on the other hand are 30 caps if i remember correctly for 0.1 weight. 
---
I cross 1200/425 last night. 
---
Face your fear, and die...track down your junk. Rinse, repeat until you focus on fun instead of dying.
---
Wait seriously?
---
Mmmmmm wet ass
---
Thats what you look like in power armor, I was stuck like that for a week or 2
---
Powered door plans
---
I have mine equipped to flannel shirt and jeans 
---
Judge Dredd
---
adorable that you believe such nonsense
---
There easy to and cheap to get because of dupers, so now like every has one.
---
Yup.  I have a shotgun that deals low damage that is just designed to cripple with Enforcer so people can get their hits in at their leisure.  
---
I often ran T60 legs and the rest X01 until I got the X01 mods.  T60 is much easier to maintain overall.
---
Hey! Anyone wants to come destroy part of my CAMP so I can rebuild part of it :) I will pay back your bounty! I'm on PC
---
Awesome story. I'm on xb1..spawned into a nuke zone this morning and instantly died because of spawn lag. Respawned at whitesprings station and put on my hazmat suit(non power armor build) returned to my base in the nuke zone and repaired my turrets..there were several 100+ I'm the area..none offered to help..nothing dropped..but they made use of my crafting stations though..glad you had better luck than me!
---
This? THIS is what‚Äôs disturbing you?
---
Most people with TSE have been bought not found.
---
Exactly.
---
I hate running into Wendigos but I love killing the things. Ever since I started collecting spare plasma grenades each Wendigo encounter feels less terrifying and more like a chance to cleanse the wasteland.
---
Kids these days are fucktards
---
Well then you didn‚Äôt try hard enough because that is total bullshit they fed you. Like I said contact your district manager. Which you did not do. 
---
Lol. Yeah you‚Äôve really displayed your elite level of intelligence in this thread. Nothing like a bully calling someone a bully.
---
So i killed a lvl 46 glowing gulper and gained 185xp, ate brain fungus soup for +2 INT, killed another lvl 46 glowing gulper and gained 197xp
---
Id say intelligence effects xp gains
---
That's great. "Nah, no way, I've gotta be way more stoned to deal with this."
---
Mostly.  Thank you!
---
I literally only ever met one, and it was during the BETA. And I think he was just attacking me because he wanted to try the PVP but I wasn't biting lol
---
I typically dont play til later at night due to my schedule but if you dont get it or have any takers id help you out. I need that one myself and the kill 20 players.
---
I've read a little bit about the books I haven't read - so I know what happens with Thib.  Just finished "Road of the Patriarch" so I'm gonna blow the dust off the rest that I have and then check out the Gauntlgrym series.
---
exactly you called them douchebags, that kinda falls under bitching. Like I said Bethesda wanted the Workshops to encourage it so bitching that "douchebags" are doing what was intended kinda makes you the douche

All travellers welcome! Free water, food and junk.  Workstations and beds available.

We should have a rewind emote. Something like our character shaking their head and hands like they didnt mean to say that with the rewind symbol above us. Or just oops.
---
Honestly, checking out other people's camps is my favorite thing to do on this sub. Great job!
---
If you can't tell the mods don't really care anymore. 
---
This sub is basically a christmas list of all the extravagant ideas fanboys can come up with and Bethesda is our deadbeat parents that ain't gonna be able to afford any of that shit. 
---
/ rant about "Dear Bethesda" posts
---
Right now my shotgun and rifle havent been doing too bad, I have been putting my levels to help them out rather than try balance everything and try different things so maybe going to try melee now at the halfway point wont make too much of an impact if i dont like it.
---
they are shown to give more fucks with Fo76 than previous tiltes.
---
You said you wanted to share, so where is my Cherry Nuka Cola?
---
Pasifism mode?
---
While in pacifist you won't need to worry about being attacked.  Just turn it on when you want to PvP, and off for farming PvE areas.
---
Stay around the lower level areas until you build up a few levels.   You'll save yourself some frustration trying to kill higher level mobs.  If you ever find an area too tough, head back down to a lower level area to grind a bit more.
---
Remember to craft your own weapons / armor!  Use those plans, and when you craft new versions, you get higher level more damage weapons / armor.  I spent sooo long with a dumb level 5 pipe pistol, I think I carried it until I was level 20 (when I could've had a level 10-20 one crafted from scratch).  Also scrap weapons and armors you find constantly for mods (so you can mod your own weapons).
---
I do play with a friend of mine.  It would be much better if we could team but we do leave the chat on area so we can communicate.  Would be nice if we could share quests and what not though.
---
He is altering the deal, pray he does not alter it any further
---
About 100 hours between two characters and haven't even seen one yet...besides the one that was used on me.
---
I chatted with him in the party for quite a while after our business was finished (about an hour) and totally believe his story actually.  I had to down about 12000 quantum colas, coins are pretty much worthless I am not sure what I put myself through that experience.
---
Explains why it crashes my Xbox at the golf course when I use it.
---
Interesting - I‚Äôve also noticed that hipfiring in general with a two shot gauss registers hits more than VATS, even when the target is far away.  It‚Äôs almost like there‚Äôs a more generous hit box with hip fires?  Most obvious against scorchbeasts 
---
They‚Äôve never been in camps. They are available in workshops build menu exclusively. 
---
If you're on Xbox I can craft you one, just need the mats. Kr you can buy the plan from someone on one of the trading subs for 500-1000 caps.
---
sad thing is i don‚Äôt have lead belly and the radiation from them is destroying me
---
Not seen one so far, lvl 126 and yes I examine them beyond looking at the name.
---
If you do happen to get a griefer you can "block them for session" and they won't be able to locate you on the map. If they still track you down just server hop.
---
Then power armor would give you &lt;9 free perk cards.... and the drugs... oh the drugs....
---
Cool thanks I will make changes on my build
---
Where is it on the map? The hermit crab not your camp?
---
&gt;  fungus is pretty easy to culture and grow, so long as you know what your doing
---
That depends on the fungus.  There's a reason why there are people who hunt the forests for morels, and can sell them for obscene prices.
---
No one else reading the judged by caps as in "show us your location. We will judge it by the wanted bounty we get." Could be legit but be aware of giving camp locations away. If you want to share it. Take yourself some pics. 
---
You probably have a good thing but people should be aware that camp locations and appealing to proud camp owners would be perfect for griefers. 
---
Been a while since I played, but I'm pretty sure they have those mats still. I was using them outside of the beta.
---
If it is their base and they are wanted you will get no wanted.
---
Once they die and lose wanted status, any further attack on the base will result in you becoming wanted.
---
After you kill them they do have the option, as always, to seek revenge so be mindful.
---
This is something i should do, i know im certainly concentrating too much on trying to survibe rather than just have some fun.
---
That sucks wanna share?
---
I believe they r there so you can break down a max perk to a lower level which leaves room for other cards to move to a diff build style.
---
Havent found one at 240 Ive found Bloodied explosive tho so cant complain
---
It does. RIP
---
I bought my first one, a TSE Combat Shotgun. But I found a Bloodied Explosive Dragon during the Uranium Fever event. Then I found a Furious Explosive Gauss Rifle on a random legendary protectron outside the Brotherhood shop (Vendor Phoenix) in Watoga.
---
This is super cool my friend! Inspiring even now that I feel I must build a new house haha
---
Hope your character doesn't get diabetes from all that soda
---
I got a TSE Handmade off Reddit. And frankly I didn‚Äôt like it. 
---
First thing I did was kill myself by firing it indoors. 
---
Then it just kinda took the fun out of the game. 
---
I traded it off for a lever action and am much happier. 
---
So far so good with my camp near the Watoga station - I usually end up between the station and my camp, but the FT mats would be nice to have again.
---
Game of the year...
---
Radaway 
---
If looking for caps as well
---
\- you can check above the service entrance - a lot of people skip 
---
\- the level 3 locked door inside the Mall
---
\- the stash in the blue room past the military wing with the Assaultron
---
This way you are farming (jetpack, caps, exp, and the paint)
---
Ive seen the same thing with a few of the suitcases at train stations. I always stop to check them now, and dump duplicate plans in.
---
https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=JeXSM11kCuU
---
Woulda won if you did this on Xbox ;) id be like keep the caps too I just Love to show off this structure :P
---
lvl 93 and the closest i have gotten is an explosive gauss rifle (not two-shot but +10% damage if you have a mutation).   I did get a sweet instigating lever action rifle with gives me the ability to 1-shot kill most trash mobs in sniper mode.  i love that damn gun even more because I actually found it myself.  
---
pathological narcissists and in some cases, full on sociopaths.
---
Those are mods, not the plans for the mods
---
You‚Äôre way off base about the market. There‚Äôs absolutely NO reason to have weapons with different rarities in the game if some jackass is always going to have 2000 of them stored in his locker.  The game economy is fucked eternally because of this. 
---
Cleetus there talk real good.
---
Technically.  Yea i guess.  Mod is one time use.  Plan is limitless as long as u got materials.  
---
Agree, as well! 
---
People will complain about duping, then go on and build exploit. People are hypocrites, they do what they will as long as they can justify it.
---
No need to be a keyboard warrior... The nice thing about my country is my freedom to say whatever the fuck I want .. lol
---
The more social u are the more friends u will gain. Invite people on missions. Keep active on forums and reddit. Give to lower level players. Invite people ingame to a team....just dont give up. A lot of my friends came from other games and from selling farmed legendaries to them. 
---
Take end down to 1 and int to 5 so you can get 15 in per and get tank killer 
---
A small tip every now and then check Fort defiances top floor. I've found 3 paper bags with maxed ultracite from hasty players who drop the chassis BEFORE checking if any armour pieces are on it. 
---
Gotta agree, I built a plasma gat an hour ago used it for one run of sugar grove. It broke as soon as I got out, that's maybe 15 enemies total. 
---
Needs moer cowbell, er... I mean desk fans.
---
Each turret claims ~10% of your budget. If you want a big build you need to find a low traffic area and skip the defenses. If you do get attacked, it's cheaper to rebuild a wall than a turret, so you're still coming out ahead in the grand scheme of things.
---
Take your upvote, you swine
---
not sure which one you mean. if its the one at the very end of the video thats in a thumbnail of another video its from the monster mash event at watoga high school. you dont get to keep that mask. 
---
theres a clown mask at the asylum, a bloody cartoon mole mask at  dolly sods, and a very hard to get cartoon cat mask at camden park. 
---
Nice! That post sounds interesting, I‚Äôve tried looking for such a list before and came up empty. It‚Äôd be really helpful.
---
LOL for one thing I don't think you formatted it correctly for the doge coin bot but also that was a long time ago and who knows if it works or if I even know what I am talking about
---
Power armor doesn‚Äôt add perk points  
---
Fair enough, haha. I'm a 10mm guy, so I have to take my daily trip to the Fire House and then to kill some super mutants for their gun scraps.
---
Always felt like the Gatling gun shot WAY too fuckin slow.
---
Maybe that's tied to this.
---
Can we just... Remove that interaction and fix Gatling gun speed? Please? Lol
---
U make an ass of Ming the merciless?
---
If your on ps4 i can paint them with BoS. Dont know whereni learned it from though.
---
I‚Äôm looking to relocate from Charleston.  Does The Mire have a decent school district.  Would you say the neighborhood is ‚Äúsafe‚Äù?
---
What I see is players blaming other players for the developers problems. 
---
If it's so consistent why aren't videos of it being plastered all over this sub? People seem to enjoy the narratives of "crashing duper parties" and yet there is never any evidence. 
---
XD i hope not i don‚Äôt think a disease cure will help that
---
I like that it's lonely compared to other games like it, you rarely see someone, so when you do it makes it a special encounter. Even if you just wave at each other and move on, it most other games, you don't even acknowledge the other players, and just go on doing your own thing.
---
Don‚Äôt follow his build , he has way too much endurance 
---
Found a Gatling plasma while battling the queen. Was excited to use it. Broke just after using it for 5 mins. Total shit. Still it just looked hella cool using it on the queen
---
Fuck em, let‚Äôs do it
---
Also on a more serious note, remember to check all containers at least daily when you play. Containers are instanced to the player as far as loot, they reset daily. On top of that, don't forget to often check stash boxes like the Overseers stash box at the Overseer's Camp and inside the church in Flat woods, many of us higher leveled players randomly leave stuff in there for lower levels.
---
Also don't be afraid of every high level you see. True, there are assholes out there but there are also friendly players out there that will give advice/items/ other types of help.
---
One of the things I do is to go to FLatwoods and stand up on a higher point above everyone. I'lll drop some stuff in a bag then start emoting for someone to follow me (come to me). First one that does gets a bag full of stuff.
---
Mine is very close to this location, and despite the lack of anything other than Harper's Ferry nearby I think it's the perfect spot. Because of the free fast travel to CAMP and Vault 76, having my camp there means I can get pretty much anywhere on the map for 25 caps or less.
---
I choose the register because there is typically only one whereas usually there are several suitcases.
---
I‚Äôm not sure, but I think you can get one (if there is one) by farming Paladin Taggerdy in the cavern associated with the BoS questline.
---
Correct me if I‚Äôm wrong anyone
---
Yea i was looking at the left of the thumbnail of this post. thats lame you dont get to keep that.
---
I said I would make changes I did not say I would follow there design
---
The BoS combat armor mods are sold at the Grafton station I believe.
---
 if someone dumps on a game they must be shilling. you call out their claim without evidence...and then make an accusation without evidence.
---
Here's what I would change for balance reasons:
---
1. Energy Resistance would be reduced across the board. This results in overall damage increase.
---
2. Energy weapons would have 0 kick, none. Ballistics would have more kick added but perks would be changed to compensate for that.
---
3. Energy weapons would all be fully automatic but vary in fire rate depending on type+mods. Quite nice with #2.
---
4. Energy ammo would have very high capacitance and be metered like fusion cores **IF** fusion cores were combinable. Basically they take only two slots in your inventory: the stack of full and the current partial.
---
5. Energy weapons would suffer heat damage if you let them get too hot. After 20-25 shots at high rof, your weapon would be hissing with steam. If you always let them cool, then they actually last longer than ballistic weapons. If you continue firing a hot energy weapon, it melts itself. This can be compensated with heat sink mods.

Lmao my wife killed a cow and got a bounty, I joked and said it was probably some players cow, didn't know it actually was, if your on Xbox my wife may have killed your cow btw and I'm sorry I swiftly killed her after.

Rdr2 isnt even pay to win, theres not an option to buy gold lol. (Or wasnt last time I played it, which was about a week after online beta dropped)

Peut tu detruire les objets dans la categorie des ‚Äúobjets stock√©s‚Äù? Les objets stock√©s prennent beaucoup d‚Äôespace dans mon budget.
---
Actually it‚Äôs technically legal as long as they claim they are selling their ‚Äútime‚Äù in the game for real money ‚Äúsomething tangible‚Äù and give you the caps for free after paying for their time. It‚Äôs how all those shady companies that do sell currency in game for real money get away with it.
---
Great idea, never considered the shotgun enforcer build
---
Yeah but with patched up power armor I doubt he had much rad resist... seems like it would take lots of radaway
---
found my first explosive at level 25, first twoshot at 45, first TSE at 50.
---
They were in the beta and that's how I still have mine. :)
---
I bet that's good on the hunt/hunted radio station?
---
Watoga high school. Its part of the monster smash event when ya zone in. Cant leave the school with it though.
---
I honestly love it when that happens only happened twice for me
---
&gt;Take 'em back to small claims court for defaulting on the payment, they'd probably get a court fine for refusing to make the payment and still have to pay you.
---
You've missed the point completely, so I will reiterate. Hopefully this dispels the notions you have.
---
First, your suggestion adds nothing to the tally other than more time and effort.  Motion, delay and dismissal filing is a full time job for Corporate lawyers, it's not your full time job, but might become one, all over $200.00, that means nothing to them but probably a lot to you. And how much time and stress did you invest into the ordeal?
---
Like I said it is better to act like an adult, continue to contact the company and attempt to get a resolution, not stamp your feet and sue.  Shit happens and it's virtually never nefarious in nature.  It will however become contiguous once you start legal proceedings.
---
The mentality of random redditor postings reminds me of a woman I "saved" from getting hit by a car.  She was walking slow, 
---
 seemingly not paying attention, I thought there was something wrong with her, but upon conversation with her at the curb, in which she was a little miffed I intervened, I said something to the tune of "You almost got hit there are you ok?"  To which she replied "If he had hit me I'd just sue his ass". It downed on me that she was purposefully walking slow and not looking both ways with the thought in her head that she would just sue if something happened... like that was an insulator and a fallback
---
Walking away I said under my breath "not if your dead, dumbass".
---
Lawsuits are not magic, which was the initial point I was making, they are not guaranteed, we are hearing one side of the story.  The other part is the contingencies I mentioned, it is flat out not worth trying to sue Bethesda.  The local pizza joint, sure.. Bethesda? No. 
---
This isn't "you vs. Large Corporation" this is you AT small claims court. You will not "win". They will not get any comeuppance and again, no one is getting in trouble, fired or staying up late at night worried about a SCC judgement.  Small claims does not go to the Justice department, they do not send the FBI or the FCC after corporations not responding to a small court claim. 
---
The only satisfaction one will ever get is imaginary.
---
...I'm ashamed to admit this, but it never occurred to me to mix and match the two. And now I am ashamed.
---
T-60 is definitely easier, but with Power Patcher and Fix it Good maxed out, repairing the X-01 hasn't been an issue for me. I usually go at least a week to ten days (albeit that's a couple hours of playing at a time) of gaming without the condition dropping below 100%.
---
Definitely equipping the T-60 legs on my character when I get home, though.
---
Its been weird for me. I've been in a pack of 15 then i went to change my shared perk and it went to shit.
---

Seriously. They want to court the PVP/griefer audience? Great. Give us separate servers, one with all the PVP elements and none of that completely laughable "limited damage" system that still lets players double your level kill you in about six hits, and one with absolutely zero PVP elements at all. Super simple solution, makes everyone happy..baring the hardcore griefers who get off on smashing lower level players, but fuck those guys. 
---
Mind sharing your build :)

I would brought every BOS Combat Armor plan..Arms, Legs, Chest. Now I am not sure if there is one for Helmets though.

I like how the community of players in this game is finally answering the age-old question of how valuable stuff keeps popping up in trash cans throughout the wasteland. Not sure who's throwing out their weightless bottlecaps, but my characters from a few hundred years in the future certainly appreciate it!
---
I guess I was putting spare stuff in the stash box at the overseers camp. No idea how long it stays there but the noobs could use the boost.
---
But they make money from cheating the game and creating problems to bitch about. Waste $60 once and then continue wasting your time to get a fat paycheck from the bandwagon. To them it's like an investment

This is great, this happened to me also just yesterday. I saw a really cool camp from a level 118 player and I just started walking around it kind of peeking in the windows checking out with this person built, I gave him a thumbs up only because I liked his camp and then I took off. Not far from his Camp I found a huge Super Mutant camp and got my level 20 ass kicked over and over again, I kept going back because I saw there was a legendary Super Mutant there. All of a sudden. That player shows up and kills everything and leaves me all the loot and gives me another thumbs up and then he takes off running away
---
I‚Äôm at work so kinda hard to explain button controls but I go into build mode, select the wall like your going to move or delete it, and your guy kinda ‚Äòholds‚Äô it while you decide what to do. I jump in, hit Cancel and the game puts the wall back in place cause I didn‚Äôt edit anything. Leave build mode boom. Inside a room with no doors. 
---
One night I was at Whitesprings (I think it was after a nuke), and the place was full of lvl1 legendary Eyebots. They all dropped lvl1 legendary items. Weird and pointless.
---
Awww thanks but sadly I am on Xbox One.
---
I take it you got a good deal on a desirable weapon and now worry that it might be a duped one?
---
I would like to have my camp evaluated. Same username.
---
SAME HERE!  Wtf??  It's worked for me I \*think\* one time, but I can't even really remember for sure.
---
Agreed however many of these aren't bases, but a wall of turrets facing the ghouls. 
---
U gotta play the game before you make claims tho
---
I disagree, making exploits known to a large number of people has proven very effective in getting it dealt with. Nothing make waves as social media outrage.
---
You don't need to put 10 hrs into a game to have an opinion if a game puts you off in an hour then it sounds like garbage. They didn't extensively cover 76 because Gerstman said no one wants to put anymore time into the game. I don't believe they reviewed it. 
---
You'd probably have better luck contacting them via modmail to get an answer. 
---
Derp, you're right. I am a dumb.
---
Pointing out the solution to your problem then defending myself from your stupidity is elite level smartness thanks for the recognition. 
---
As a (your) suggestion, I agree with a New issues thread after each patch as opposed to sorting a massive list of comments by newest first.  Some would still fall by the wayside I think even sorted that way.  As to the censoring, (which censoring itself escapes me after reading your post), for the sake of reducing redundancy and consolidating issues into a single thread, I could see that as a legitimate reason for closing a thread.  
---
Is their comment censored when you're logged in?  Logged out I could see it as a form of privacy to bar random people from reading a mod's comments on a censored or locked post so that only the poster can see the reasoning for the thread lock/censor.
---
Just FYI, you gotta leave the vault for the game to start saving any progress. 
---
I know some people who aren't dupers, but have taken advantage of the duping.  They'd buy 500 nukas for 200 caps or something like that.... buy up thousands of them... then get bored trying to drink them all and crashing, so they just drop them.  Sounds like that.

That's nice.
---
My buddy and I once ran into a couple of lvl 68 guys (we were mid lvl 20s) while we were tinkering at a workbench... he killed me and took over my workbench for his own.  My buddy ran away.
---
They took over the workbench and build up the defenses and and such.
---
So we did what any sensible player would do.  We kept re-spawning near-by and going back and harassed him for a good 20 minutes before they got fed up and left.
---
oh my god, that's... this is... 
---
i'm just so sad i bought this.
---
Lol yeah i have a bloodied explosive combat rifle.. no TSE though.. plenty of E's, plenty of TS's but no TSE's =P
---
its amazing for serious pve action as well.
---
Few things cost their value anymore, and now we have things that have zero post invention cost to and unlimited free supply (digital sales) purely priced by demand. Money is doomed to fail.  I don't think this any longer qualifies as predatory in itself. 
---
The mods must be the devs.
---
that makes a lot of sense! thank you!!
---
Did you even play FO4? I mean, yes, loading times should be short, we all agree. But the loading times are nowhere near the level of FO4's and there are more pressing issues. 
---
BIG OOF! I made a post and video 2 weeks ago showing how to change spawn. XD I should get into YouTube :P
---
The xp glitch is only worthwhile on pc and even then your hurting yourself more than those levels will help . Items don‚Äôt matter , this game is easy af with a basic combat knife so idk why you think it‚Äôd be hard for people without 3star weapons . Maybe if you stopped crying on reddit and farmed a couple of spawns at white springs you would get some good items

40,000 frag grenades is all I‚Äôve ever found in a bag.

I destroyed everything except the water purifiers that can neither be placed nor destroyed ... Whether via storage or after placement because impossible to place in the water. The purifiers appear with a white outline ... The only time I see this outline ... I do not see how much is left of it too and an error message appears during the destruction attempt by storage.
---
Honestly we get PvE servers only I'd be happy
---
Here‚Äôs an alternative story for you, yesterday my friend and I where in the glass cavern headed back out and I saw two people at my camp, one wanted, one not. I said ‚Äúhey man we have to head back to my camp NOW there are people there destroying it let‚Äôs go!‚Äù Of course we both have to stop and take off passive mode, but I‚Äôm over encumbered and he is not. He fast travels the short ways up there and dies immediately. Apparently between the time he was loading the other guy at my camp killed the wanted player, and my friendly blindly attacked ‚Äùthe good guy‚Äù and got one shot by a TSE shotgun. I arrive a moment later to find my base almost 100% destroyed and no one there at all. That other guy probably walked away with 300 caps, and I had to scrap my whole farm to repair my camp.
---
Good on you for being prepared and taking one of those suckers down! 
---
I haven‚Äôt played in a while, so I‚Äôm not sure, but it might
---
I think duping could be solved by making every weapon or Armor unique and you can only carry one of that prefix.
---
Aid, junk etc duping could be fixed by capping the amount you can carry if each item, eg 99 nuke colas and you try to get another it will tell you that you can‚Äôt carry anymore of those.
---
I also think that excessive over encumbrance should damage the player, damage per second based on the % of weight they are over. All these duper‚Äôs would suddenly start dying several seconds upon entering the game.
---
Tried it. Terrible. Even less spawn, if that's possible.
---
Not good, my CAMP is near there.  I wasn't on at the time, but don't make it a habit. 
---
Hmm, older Beth releases were basically ship n sit back. Maybe they do a hotfix for a gamebreaking bug. 
---
I think 76's release kind of laid bare their inadequacies as developers when it comes to creating something with everything a mmo (shared world shooter, if you want to get technical) player could want. It's gallingly apparent they had no idea what they were doing besides: barebones fallout gameplay + multiplayer. With the MASSIVE QOL thread going around, it's hard to think that anything will get done soon, let alone by spring when dlc will be released. Not to mention the fact that stealth nerfs and more breaks will come with those patches because they use us to test. 
---
They give more fucks, yes, but they're giving us the fuck. 
---
ha! 
---
Characters don't become permanent until they leave the vault.
---
Interesting about how it procs a bunch of times in a row, but not spread out consistently. I‚Äôve noticed the exact same thing happen with both lucky break and the weapon one (luck of the draw?). I‚Äôll have it not proc once for an entire play session, then the next day it‚Äôll proc 3 times in the same mob, or like twice while shooting once deathclaw. Weird. 
---
Watching this.  Need the same thing.  
---
Well, weapons like the ripper or mr. handy blade are broken and aren't affected by vampire's, so technically that does change it from the regular healing to 0. Afaik the damage, fire rate, etc does not actaully affect it though. 
---
J'ai tout d√©truit except√© les √©purateurs d'eau qui ne peuvent ni √™tre plac√©, ni √™tre d√©truit... Que ce soit via le stockage ou apr√®s placement car impossible √† placer dans l'eau.

I shot at one of his walls and got a bounty on me which somebody claimed from me the day after.

Your point is that other people are higher level and have better items so you cry about it , we get it

Nope but they can kill many mobs that you don't get to tag either which sux.

Cant fit 300 pieces of steel in a mailbox, but 20 fatmans(fatmen?), 1000 screws, 500 glue bottles, and 100 ribeye steaks fit nicely into 1 brown paper bag - which is an average Saturday night for Michael Moore. XD
---
Aww cute! I found some non hostile rat pups that followed me around for awhile until I left the area lol
---
Attack speed from my experimenting was the only difference. Its a small sliver healed per hit. The vampire Combat knife was decent stabbing but didnt out-heal damage taken, 10mm submachine gun was decent but didnt outheal damage from basic enemies. Then I got the Vampire Ripper. Thing healed so fast my bar just raced back up........ But the ripper damage was so weak I had to swap weapons to kill after healing. There was not noticeable change in healing to damage ration that I noticed, just a per hit small heal.

Ok who then? the difference with the Facebook example Is there is a clear cohesive story if you can't provide evidence then its just something anyone could have made up like I can tell you im a doctor but I could just be lieing.

You can also do this with maps at the railway stations, although you have to get REALLY close to the pins on the map to be able to interact with them. Another location tip - You can join Events and fast travel to that place even if you haven't been there before. Handy way to pick up map locations, even if you have no interest in the event.

This is why I rarely nuke and just solo farm stuff. We need an ‚Äúinvite only/private server‚Äù option. Either I‚Äôm an asshole or you are.. terrible system.

PS4 unfortunately, and I have a shitload of materials too. Im mainly a farmer junk hoarder explorer too. I have about 6k caps now and I would be worth it to just buy the plans outright instead.
---
I would trade you a tse handmade for that if it's max level
---
Use radshields? Regular armor shouldn't be close to the resistance given by hazmat suits or power armor.
---
the fact that this sub doesn't do this is boggling to me. almost every single large online game subreddit does this because otherwise what happens is the same thing that happens in this sub, which is just an endless tide of outdated or highly repetitive ~tips n trickz~ and "DAE THINK THIS GAME IS ACTUALLY FUN?" circlejerks. we don't even get to have any memes or shitposts to balance it out either.
---
I gathered that about the miners, personally would like to read some logs from their days mid-change into what they are now. Interested in what they look like under the mask as well, they gotta eat somehow I assume.

The Tesla gun is good to use for the lower guys who do t have one hit builds..

Whats your hotspot password?  I'll say it all night long for that sweet, sweet internet connection!
---
I guess my point is that up until multiple star legendaries, there's not a lot of positives to be said about going ranged, whereas melee is pretty strong throughout once you get a handful of strength cards; it's based more on your build than your weapon, whereas ranged is the other way around *unless* you're cheesing the pipe weapon bug. 
---
The weapons need to be balanced so that your build determines your effectiveness, and having multi-star legendaries is what makes you more powerful at late levels. That includes some heavy nerfs on some legendary effects and some massive buffs to base damage on a lot of weapons. 
---
Radants, those thing suck. Too much DR. 
---
when you're being attacked by ghouls if they are diseased or some other prefixes you also take poison damage just fyi
---
You could, but anyone could trigger it then. Also a tripwire would only work once before needing to be reset. 
---
They desperately need to add more "nukable" places. Between the CAMPs people are building next to the club house and the server hopping, there are just too many people trying to tag the same few spawns.  I have had much better luck when Whitesprings is not nuked lately.
---
I would like to see it being worth dropping 2 nukes in different spots and having different higher level spawns. I feel like so many of these things are put in place due to limitations of the game and/or engine. I feel the same when just running around in the wild. I feel like there should be more spawns all over. 
---
yes go to whitesprings vendor mall there is a vendor who sell furniture plans you want plan called "modern bed"
---
I'm not accusing Rockstar of anything, but if I had spent 7 years and hundreds of millions of dollars to develop a new game I would want to do anything I can to minimize the competition from another well loved franchise coming out at the same time. 
---
Nah, that's alright - no need to go getting me all excited when there's no telling when it might make it into the game. :P Thank you for offering, though!
---
I don't understand the vitriolic hatred for PvPers in this game. I perfectly understand if you don't want to participate, but it seems 40% of the posts on here are complaining about or just plain insulting people who choose to partake in a major portion of the game

You can sort by weight already.  Push Q.
---
Level 142, I found a level 35 two shot explosive dragon from a ghoul in the whitesprings parking lot by the tool/laundry shack. I was just passing through on my way to sell stuff to the enclave bunker, I didn't believe my eyes
---
There were two updates, then silence? High-end weapons still broken?
---
Thanks, I'll try that one!
---
Yeah, if you got the caps just buy it. Saves a lot of time.
---
Hmmmm scorch beasts should be blinding them selves
---
Woah. Is this true? I actually never knew that
---
This is the first game where I'd \_use\_ a companion app. It actually makes sense. It would add usability and be immersive, instead of dealing with the overlay and being terrified, I can swap out weapons AND watch the world around me.   
---
And that's why we won't get one. It would be USEFUL. 
---
I agree 100%. Some times I notice I'm way higher in one material than the others and don't need them so I skip the next few. Also for people not crafting the Ionized meat is great money and most people going for flux completely ignore them.
---
Oh yea I forgot ionized meat is shared too. Just not as useful so I forgot about it.
---
Yes, it was in the beta. I'll take a photo when I get home.
---
I was following the story of the family as well as Hornright's, and not sure if we know the fates of either. I might have glossed over it mistakenly but don't want to check the wiki in case I spoil it for myself. 
---
 Normally, in other games, that‚Äôs exactly how it‚Äôs done. Duping or otherwise breaking game mechanics is viewed extremely poorly by developers and results in lifetime bans, other penalties of that level.
---
Breaking servers or doing other similar things that impact other players‚Äô experience is also viewed very poorly and once again, bans.
---
So. This particular issue is a double whammy of duping (item exploit affecting gameplay of multiple players in a large way) and crashing game servers. And so far, nothing. It‚Äôs so bad that whenever Bethesda tries to patch the dupe glitch, a new way to dupe is spread around.
---
The reason why people are getting away with it is because Bethesda lets them. So either the big B is powerless, or they don‚Äôt give a fuck.
---
Either way this is a gigantic mess in terms of gameplay and longevity.
---
No, but I'm more likely to believe someone with first hand knowledge saying what they *know* on the internet than someone who has zero experience in the industry or first hand knowledge just spouting off what they *believe* on the internet. 
---
combat meta sucks so bad i bet even rumored/promised faction wars will flop.
---
I was under the assumption that you couldn't activate the keypad switch if you didn't know the code and weren't on the owners team. Have I been wrong this whole time?
---
dude, your post is epic
---
You do have a bit of control over where you spawn. Just move your C.A.M.P. box around and quick-travel to your camp. Play around with the positioning to get it just the way you want it.
---
I don't think the actual mod I was talking to is at fault though, whether it was the right choice or not. He/she wouldn't remove their own comment when they actually agreed with the idea.
---
The mod said "All great points!" I don't think they would just say that to ease me, I genuinely think this mod liked the idea, but everyone else didn't.
---
I use a vampire wardrum sledge with the 50% resist close combat damage perks in a boosted str excavator armor basically can tank all day in a radiation zone without using stimpacks 
---
How does that work out since shotguns have their own perk line and the combat is a shotgun class?  Must be a bug, if it's not my build might get a slight tweak.
---
I've just shanked people previously... TSE being so common once you close you win..

"Use radshields?"
---
I do. It doesn't help.
---
"Regular armor shouldn't be close to the resistance given by hazmat suits or power armor."
---
Then A) Why does lead lining, natural armor resists, RR perk, RR legendary affix exist. Stacking them is pointless. B) Why didn't it work this way in FO4.
---
"I can't believe that I can get away with this! WHAT IS WRONG WITH SOCIETY!"

I downloaded them 2 days ago. 
---
Ay it's just a blood transfusion through a different hole.
---
Yes - but be careful. I'd recommend NOT wearing a suit of the Excavator armor on this quest to avoid breaking the quest chain and preventing you from ever getting the plans.
---
Once you're at the "Build" X, Y, Z part of the quest (and this will be after already acquiring the plans, head into the room directly south of the room where the quest directs you to build the power armor. In that room on the west wall it a platform with a large square red button. While wearing the Excavator Power Armor, press that button. This completes the quest chain and clears the quest from your log, without needing to build the Power Armor.
---
Note: I'd read on a wiki page that completing the chain gives the armor +100 weight capacity. I'm not sure if that's true (beyond the +100 that the armor gives as a set already).
---
I've found, even without completing the chain, simply logging into the game while wearing the Excavator Power Armor will give you the larger carry weight (+200 lb), until you exit/enter the armor again. 
---
Note 2: I completed the chain and the armor weight capacity didn't increase, even after exiting/entering the armor. 
---
* Quitting to the main menu and then returning to the game also does not appear to give the full benefit of the armor. 
---
* Quitting the game entirely also does not allow the full benefit of the armor

I'm not positive what the weight capacity would be if the entire quest chain was completed without skipping the build steps, so, caveat emptor on skipping the build portion.
---
It'd be nice for someone to verify if building the set as part of the chain allows for an additional +100 lb weight capacity for the set outside of what the completed set already provides.
---
**So I can't use my End Game gear in End Game.**
---
Todd, is that you?
---
I was level 102 when I found my first TSE. 
---
I'm guilty of this. I have a TSE lever action rifle that one shots ghouls if it's a sneak crit, and my build is pure sneak.
---
When I go to Whitesprings and oneshot the ghouls (I can kill clusters if I just aim at the floor), I can feel the weight of other people glaring at me. And no, I'm not going to wait for someone else to tag it for a couple of reasons.
---
1. They could one shot it before I do
---
2. Sneak crits are no longer sneak crits once the monster is aggro'd to someone (maybe the first shot but never any shot after, it's super wonky)
---
Bethesda needs to fix the looting system so you can loot something that dies from someone that you're reasonably close to.
---
I usually go ham in the nuke zone at whitesprings with my TSE gatling/handmade and then find the lowest level brave enough to hang out and give him every drop I don't want (which is everything 90% of the time...)
---
lol right back at ya
---
The fast travel mat, I have mine on my beta toon. I made a new character when the game went live to start fresh and was confused why I couldn't set my fast travel point for a long while I assumed it was a recipe I hadn't learned on my new character now I know it got removed and I'm scared to move my beta toons camp.
---
With this I could run the ammo factory for more than 40mins, imagine the amounts of ammo!
---
I sell everything bulked over 100 except lead, plastic, and adhesive - and depending on my stash space I might keep steel and wood at 200
---
I have no problem with the load time, at no point does this post complain about the load time. In point of fact I would prefer a LONGER load time. Long enough for everything to load properly BEFORE you take damage. 
---
The issue, which if you had actually read the post you would understand, lies in the fact that AFTER the load screen has ended there remains a 20 second window while the game is still loading things in, during that time you cannot use weapons and any enemies around you still haven't fully loaded in, but you can still take damage from them and from the environment. 
---
Fallout 4 was not a live game, it was an offline solo player game, in that this was not an issue.
---
This game IS a live game and is ONline, therefore a 20 second period where you take damage with no opportunity to defend yourself is completely unacceptable. It's a basic thing for online games one that should never have been an issue in the first place, let alone need to be fixed.
---
I think the one you want is actually Vault-Tec Bed 2. That's the one with the dark grey blanket.
---
Being an explosives build, i can say that  it's incredibly satisfying to see what people do when you suck down some drugs and lay waste to them with 2000+ damage from a fatman. That's that GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOD shit
---
That wasn‚Äôt invisible... 205-16=189 and that was what happened.
---
Maybe it triggers more often with higher damage attacks.
---
Agree with what others are saying.  The average I keep of uncommon stuff is 100.  Here's a guide I use, feel free to tweak based on your personal needs:
---
200 each:
---
Plastic (mostly for bulking to sell excess)
---
Adhesive
---
Ballistic Fiber
---
Lead
---
Steel
---
Wood (I cook a lot).
---
100 each (this will vary based on how much you use things on this list):
---
Fiber Optics
---
Aluminum
---
Fiberglass
---
Nuclear Material
---
Acid
---
Copper
---
Oil
---
Circuitry
---
Glass
---
Concrete
---
50 each of the less used items: 
---
Gold
---
Silver
---
Cork
---
Leather
---
Ceramic
---
Asbestos
---
Bone
---
Fertilizer
---
Unlimited (the rarer stuff frequently used):
---
Ultracite
---
Screws
---
Springs
---
Gears
---
Black Titanium
---
Hope this helps!
---
Interesting. I've never done those quests. My stash is always full, and I seem to be awash in black titanium. 
---
I made a 2x2 mini base with all the stuff you could use and need as a new player and join peoples teams drop it in there camp give them the thumbs up and roam about helping people 
---
Good for you!
---
Don't get me wrong, I'm still having a blast playing solo. I'm just not a super social guy outside of my group of friends, so it's tough for me to just walk up to a stranger and be all buddy-buddy with them, ya know? The buddy I'm playing with is struggling to level up, so I've been trying to get him new gear and level him up, but he's still only a level 22, so it's tough to find places he can survive. Right now our goal is to get him up to 25 so I can give him a set of Excavator armor I made for him.
---
I am playing... I've done everything there is do do for the most part... I have no more side or main quests..  I wanted to see what was in there. I marked it spoilers so if you didn't want to know about it that's on you for reading it. Besides I'm not the first to post on this. Most of this was out in the Beta. I just wanted to talk about my excitement and show off my cool ass look!
---
Open world games, the one and only good fallout 76 coverage. Fuck juicehead, that guys a prick
---
Most I've had was 6500, and I currently have 5900...it's a massive pain to get rid of. I've been crafting as much .50 cal as humanly possible, hoarding all the steel I can find, and I'm almost breaking even with just the gunpowder I find in ammo boxes and on mutants. You absolutely do not need to have a lot on you
---
This is one of my favorite things to do. finding lower level players and helping them. its really a rewarding experience. you know why i do it? because i was that low level player being helped many times.
---
Weird flex but okay
---
Actually, I did a whitespring run with my spear today, and had to double take as a level 62 charred ghoul took a hit and didn‚Äôt immediately collapse. I dare say he took 3 hits in fact, hmmmm.
---
Do Molotov instead. Nades can send the bodies flying and bug them out, making them hard to loot.
---
it's an adrenal reaction build that doesn't use PA endurance is necessary + at least 3 endurance is fairly standard for high-level play for ghoulish and rejuvenated if titan doesn't want to go for adrenal than putting the 5 extra points into luck, agility or perception works fine
---
Camden Park is a good place to get shotguns to scrap to learn mods.
---
As per global Reddit policy... only two threads can be Stickied.
---
They have added the Bot that puts a Bethesda Replied Flag to the First post, and inside the post each Bethesda response is at the top of the thread.
---
I think calling them lazy before you have walked in their shoes is pretty lame.  Lots of progress have happen in the sub since its inception.
---
I do Agree they should make a new Sticky Issues and Feedback thread for each patch though.
---
I picked the cannon back up. It went from 212, to 205 after I picked it back up.
---
I LOVE this idea! Yes please! I am a PC player though, would love to see a Homeowners Association for PC now. :) Was one of my favorite things in the Ark subreddit. I will avidly await the submissions.

It could be that their "random" function isn't all that random.
---
I use automatic energy weapons to hose down enemies of lower lvls to use up my cells or gatling lazer when I get to many fusion cores 
---
Are you sure? Because it doesnt change the damage on the pipboy when you equip it. But the shot gun perks in strength do. I know it worked in fallout 4 but there doesnt seem to be anything to indicate it does on 76
---
What was the date? I got the game on xmas, and didn't play until that day either.
---
I have Tactics on CD-ROM somewhere, but it would be nice.
---
All become hippies and preach love?
---
I want to see what they do with the other factions to be honest. 
---
I have 200 plastic if interested 
---
I really liked this for fo4, even with how flakey it was. Agree it would be 100% more useful for a multiplayer game where you don't always want to have your character frozen while you search for meds or sort items. The one in RDR2 is pretty useful even for single player.
---
Of all the things wrong in 76, it seems they actually have server transactions for inventory item tracking down pretty solid, so I don't imagine there would be sync issues.
---
Yeah it's pretty horrific. Game really wants to sell PA skins or something, they tickle me in that.
---
They see a certain frequency. It'd be like trying to blind them with a really bright normal light when they see in ultraviolet. Just as an example. 
---
I had no idea that the power armor chassis you got from some quests even had anything on them. So I dropped them as they took up weight... Wish they could've atleast given me a prompt saying "You got the X-01 Enclave PA!". Just something you know :/
---
If you mean at one time, only one. There is a cooldown for each silo I believe. There is a holotape you can buy from the enclave that will allow you to see silo status. 
---
how many caps?
---
agreed rad and poison damage outside of PA is basically nothing, chems and mods get you maybe 1/4 of the way to PA, even 3\* legendaries with rad resist / something else don't compare especially cuz PA is always available 
---
Nahhhhh.
---
I was going through the school where people used to do the grenade glitch, and a guy was spamming the empty string getting his nades and xp.  When he saw me, he moved, something happened, and he blew himself up.
---
He had like 35 screws and a bunch of other goodies, so I took what I wanted and left the server before he got back üòÇ
---
I'd say yea.......but I'd do the same thing so no lol
---
I am hoping that Bethesda puts out more information rather soon about their next patch since they just did an inside the vault on January 1st with some vague details about upcoming stuff.  Plus the next patch is again going to be a huge one to download apparently.
---
I have not moved my base for some time now to avoid this glitch.  I can't even repair missing or broken items now that I am missing a turret that used to fit in my budget but does not anymore.  The turret disappeared but the space it took up did not free back up.
---
dammm wtf 800 for that!!! that‚Äôs crazy lol
---
My house was just evaluated and I got a score of 650, the judges were very professional and friendly, I really liked the experience and I will now make some great changes to my estate that were brought up during the evaluation. Overall I really enjoyed it.

The usual etiquette for the golf club is everyone sits on the ledge, and one high level player runs through the left side entrance and aggroes everything, then runs out of the front door leading everything to the ledge. Anyone who runs in and starts killing mobs in the resort is being selfish on purpose because they don't wanna wait 30 seconds for the mobs to run outside, or else they don't know. Also anyone who smashes a house in the back gets a thumbs up
---
Negative. I'm at work.
---
Also I'd like to withdraw until such time as the Water Purifier bug has been resolved.
---
Sounds like a bug, but I don't play on PC so I couldn't tell you for sure. It should be a semi-fluid motion when you press the button to swing. 
---
every time I see a thread like this, I have to wonder what's wrong with the person who posted it. The game is a buggy (even by Bethesda standards) mess, surrounded by controversy of fucking insane levels. Youtubers point this out, and they point out that it's not acceptable.   
---
The game doesn't \_need any fucking help\_ to have a "bad rep".  It's earned it's negative reviews by being, objectively speaking, \_fucking unfinished garbage\_.   
---
That doesn't mean I don't enjoy it for what it is, but it's fucking \_offensive\_ that this was put out as a release title and not a \_true fucking beta\_. And some of the controversy around the publishing of this game is \_literally criminal\_ in the sense that \_bethesda deserves to face legal charges in multiple courts around the world for violating laws\_ including in America for \_fucking fraud\_.   
---
But yeah, youtubers shouldn't promote duping glitches. That's fucking stupid, I'll grant you that. 
---
Hey - you got 3 more dark crystals then the Skekses got!  XD
---
Did not know that! Thanks!

---
Yeah Im pretty miserly with my caps in general except for fast travel, I literally don't buy anything, but its worth it in this case.
---
Yeah tons of times I'll be sitting in fo76 and realize I've just been hanging out in the woods with my map open for like five minutes and it's a miracle some Deathclaw hasn't shown up.
---
&gt; Don‚Äôt know why so many people hate it. 
---
People think 'worst game launch of 2018' means worst game of 2018. Even as a fan I can see that Bethesda as a publisher handled this about as poorly as you possibly can. But Bethesda as a developer made an alright game that I'm still playing even after 100 hours or so and still enjoying. 
---
Where did the 7 units go? Didn't you notice I had the overweight debuff and lost AP at the bottom right of the screen?
---
I dropped the cannon, lost the overweight debuff, picked it back up, and it was like I was never overweight in the first place. That's phantom weight.

Suggestions
---
Add a way to search players / teams, that want to do nuke launch and Scorchbeast queen stuff and looking additional player or if someone like to do quest together or do a event etc.  
---
Also, please do also something to prevent some random dude to wonder around the launch the nuke, when you have fighting yourself about 4 hours and cant choose where to launch. 
---
This made me cry when it happened to me ;D
---
Stories like this is why I take my thousand plus damage melee build and go one shot people with bounties. Griefers are something that this game doesn't need. However it is great that you were able to find some company in your trying time.
---
Aren't those different things? There are mining machines in the ash heap that can give you treasure maps for resource caches, but I'm pretty sure it did not let me use the tokens I found around the map. I think the tokens for those vending machines are a different kind
---
Hi fellow midlife housewife!  I would love to see shots of your camp!
---
Unfortunate as that is, it happened. 
---
So long as you know that you didn't loot the bag with intent to steal this player's items, you'll both get over it easily enough.  
---
Willing to bet $ (caps) that it isn't luck effecting it but a different RNG...
---
I've been testing and documenting, but there appears to be a "luck" factor not effected by the Luck Stat... Which is why some perks are fantastic for person A with a luck of 3 and terrible for person B with a 15 luck.
---
End gives piss poor returns and horrible perk cards . I don‚Äôt mean to be harsh but in terms of min/maxing your build is bad 
---
All PA spawns in the Savage Divide are Raider at least.
---
Enjoy it while you can, after you get past level 60 or so the game becomes VERY easy. I can one shot glowing nuked mobs and kill anything else very easily. Weapons and PA are very over powered in the game, especially melee weapons.
---
We always leave our extra plans and ammo in the overseers box at Flatwoods' church. I do like the cash register idea as well. 
---
What are you dreaming about?
---
The Atom shop works perfectly. Now if they'd only put the same effort into the actual game, they wouldn't be being humiliated right now would they?
---
&gt; That sucks for the guy that accidentally gets wanted by picking a lock on a toolbox in a workshop
---
This is really fucking annoying, too. Extractors will be marked as "Steal" for their interaction when you look at them. Workshop toolboxes are not. 
---
Also, what happened to the ol' "crosshair turns red" thing when looting a container would count as theft? That was a lot more clear and unambiguous.
---
thank you
---
THANK YOUm God I was waiting for someone to say it
---
I always thought being able to ‚Äúconsume‚Äù unwanted perk cards for 10 atoms would be a good solution
---
Whoa that sounds annoying. Now that I think about it, it happens with my mole miner gauntlet if things are intense and I click too much. Click to block &gt; nothing. Click to attack &gt; nothing, I eat a fat board to the face and back off &gt; suddenly I can swing again.
---
So try what I‚Äôm trying to train myself to do and don‚Äôt spam inputs.

Neon letters. Anybody got them for a reasonable price? I'm low on caps, but i'm willing to trade favors/junk/loot/etc alongside caps
---
I can‚Äôt do much about them cheating the game, but I can activate ad block anytime I click on one of their videos (ahem, JuiceHead). 
---
I like candy too, chocolate is my go to.
---
Level 137 and haven't found one yet.  Have found two 2-shot weapons (laser pistol and flamer) and 1 explosive weapon (flamer).  But not TSE on the same weapon yet, unfortunately.
---
I hope it will be corrected soon .... A tip, do not move your base and do not try to reduce the budget.
---
Well once I dropped my only exploding nocturnal shotgun by accident so hopefully someone got that...:(
---
Yes, they all suck really bad. Especially laser rifles.
---
Shame the nuke the other night was so bad!
---
You're going to love this one :)
---
Queen nuke zone, queen is done, everyone is re-checking bodies for nuke materials.  What's this?  A bag, probably filled with trash junk I don't need.  What the heck, I'll check it anyways.   Never know, it could be some stable flux.
---
SHARP INTAKE OF BREATH........stunned silence........it's a Two Shot Explosive Max Level Handmade and nothing else.  
---
The only thing I can think is some noob was trying to drop a legendary he didn't want and dropped this instead.  Then didn't check the bag to see what he dropped.
---
My profit your loss bud :)

Not really. This is reddit, not some scholarly essay. Even with the exclamation point I knew you were asking a question. You can't seriously be serious. Either you are trolling or you are 12 years old. Have a good life.
---
Never got one and the trade servers I‚Äôm in don‚Äôt allow dupes 
---
At this point I don‚Äôt even care if one I get is duped just wish I had an easier way of finding a dupe to trade for 
---
I logged in on the 25th.  It might take time for account injection, or I missed the boat.  Like I said, doesn't really matter for me, I've got the Fallout collection on Steam.  It has Fallout 1, 2, and Tactics.  If you don't already have them through Steam, GoG, or old CDs, all three are $2.50 each right now on the Bethesda store.
---
I won't immediately loot someone's bag if they happen to die close to me. However, if I find one randomly with no one around I will loot it. Same goes for a wanted player's junk.
---
Amazing work! Keep it up!
---
Not my fault you're taking gear without proper rad resist into an area with high radiation. Wear PA or use hazmat if you want to be in a nuke zone. It's the way the game is. 
---
You can pray to Todd to change the world or suck it up and alter the way you play. 
---
Also, 10-12 per second could possibly be negated with the radsponge perk. Though, you'd need high charisma to share it/teammates to make it work. 
---
Make a new character, keep them around level 15 and spec them entirely into Melee. Then you just need one halfway decent legendary melee weapon and you can one shot high level players thanks to the really bad PvP scaling system.
---
I‚Äôve noticed inconsistent results in VATS similar to what you‚Äôve reported here. One thing I‚Äôve done to try and improve it is to make sure my feet are planted on the ground when I fire. Strafing around seems to make me miss a little more often when I fire, but maybe that‚Äôs just in my head. 
---
I don‚Äôt think you understood what I said, that wasn‚Äôt permanent and two when you swapped tabs the weight changed back to 205. 
---
Yes. Originally it was a pc on promotion but they‚Äôve opened it up to anyone who played their copy of Fallout 76 in 2018. 
---
You decide good and evil.

I actually stopped watching several YouTube channels over their approach with Fallout 76.

Never encoumtered that event either do know the location?

Encountered*
---
The best way to get one is to get up on FO76 Bazzar and FO76 Market reddits.  Sometimes people who have one will trade it for other things they need.
---
i've found two-shots and i've found exploding, but i have yet to find them together by ~250 hours into the game.

u/MisterWoodhouse mods both and to be honest I'm surprised this thread is still up with him as mod since none of the mods like to be questioned 'publicly'.  Everything gets funneled to mod mail so they can control it. 
---
Yeah i've seen weapons like that lying around before.  I think it's some disabled functionality showing through before all the items around you have full loaded/synched.
---
I don't really watch any gaming news channels anymore. Even OpenWorldGames started to irritate me leading up to release with his 10 minute videos covering two or three Pete Hines tweets.
---
When I was white springs during nuke zone jumped into while trying to farm to make x01 and guess what some dropped AT THE FRONT DOOR AS I WAS GOING TO SCRAP AND STORE everything to make except for 1 leg.

Passive mode does not protect yourself or your base, just prevents you from slapping/damaging players.

Just change weapons / styles for non-solo play..

Level 290 and still haven't gotten a TSE
---
I found a two shot explosive black powder rifle around level 60, and a flamer around level 90 (both just from whitesprings farming)
---
Are you talking about 100dmg * .85
---
Or
---
Are you asking if 2 pieces mean 30% less damage?
---
I thought there was one in misc?
---
Nice, how would I go about claiming these games?
---
my prior base would spawn me 10' under water in the lake... good times
---
Chill! It also is the freedom to look like a tool. 
---
Some of us make great use of those freedoms. Others make us wonder why we have them... 
---
The OP?
---
So dont think a supersledge or fireaxe would heal a larger amount per blow?
---
That's what he was screaming over the mic
---
yeah. It doesn't say vault tec on the description anywhere, just bed variant 5/5
---
JuiceHead is a hit or a miss for me. Some of his videos are actually pretty good, but others are following the stereotype. 
---
What platform, dude.
---
Oh yeah I didn't notice that, sorry. But my point still stands that there was some type of phantom weight there that made me overweight. Dropping and re-looting a weapon seemed to fix it.
---
Sorry again.
---
It was a joke. And it's Miss Galexi. Thank you.
---
That's what he was screaming over the mic 
---
Sometimes I log in and my weapon damage (mole miner claws) says 400+ damage. Sometimes I log in and it says 180-260. I check my perks and mutations, everything seems right just my damage is like cut in half.
---
or... bethesda could just fix it. Like, you know, every other game as service. 
---
They wanted there online game, and now they dont treat it like one
---
Yeah keep that duping shit somewhere else man I'm a top vendor in the wasteland of xbox one I'm well connected and organized.
---
Why should someone change something, when the mechanic itself isn't right for decent party exp farming.
---
Yes, which is why I included the "lol" at the end to emphasize the silly comment.
---
Yeah I felt like the bos story just ended abruptly... like here's ur PA and that was it... I'd like to see more from the responders too because there was a lot a sad stories along the way with them.
---
Without proper rad resist. So lead lining, rad resist legendary, natural rr, rr perk, and rad shield were designed for what content exactly?
---
Fucking serious?  You're just going to remove the thread?   u/MisterWoodhouse or whichever mod did this, this is very childish.   
---
I constantly have too much shit, I see a bag i'm transferring junk IN. Your problem now buddy!
---
Damage increase with each consecutive hit on the same target. Can‚Äôt remember what it‚Äôs called. 
---
I wish I could do that just to find some "Unruly Golfers" for once.
---
I've been stalked 3 times by the Stalking Mothman (who will tele-follow you until you get him down to 25% then run of like a little witch), I've seen the Watching Mothman  twice, and communed with the one that shows up when you light the lighthouse.
---
Yes, the Stalking Mothman is a serious pain in that if you don't do damage fast enough to him, he runs before you can kill him.  Frankly, he's next on my list, if I can figure out the trigger (i suspect it's being alone alot in remote parts of the wasteland)
---
The Grafton Station and the Hunting Lodge?
---
Especially at whitespring, some people like myself, one shot stuff to get drops. I farm for glowing mass, and hardened mass. I've done the tag only thing, just to have some low level run up and grab the mass. I did all the work mostly, to get no loot i needed. I don't understand why some loot is shared and some isn't. 
---
If you have the plan, it will say "**Build** mod" if you have a mod it will say "**Attach** mod" in the list of actions at the bottom of the screen. In both instances it will tell you what is required to **build** the mod. However since you have the mod pre-built you simply need to **attach** the mod at no material cost. This being said, Ive seen this happen to enough people that I think this needs to be clarified in game. 
---
I wasn‚Äôt hating on ‚Äòem, but I think the reason people get salty would have something to do with the fact that Fallout players typically are big fans of role playing and, as the game currently sits, basically the only reason to attack other players is for the sake of greifing and messing up somebody‚Äôs day. 
---
I mean, what‚Äôs the incentive? A tiny bag of junk (assuming they were even carrying any). 
---
I don‚Äôt know what the answer would be, but if there was some more logical and understandable reason players may be pushed into raiding, everyone would like it more. Like if you could actually join a faction and get perks from it or something? 
---
Dang!  That‚Äôs awesome! I‚Äôve only came across nanny and the two handys having an odd conversation. 
---
If you're a ranged character, trying to keep it around 250 is ok.  Remember you can craft more with cloth and acid.
---
Sell the rest on FO76 Bazzar or FO76 Market.  Probably won't get much though, it's easy to come by.
---
Yeah your right. Maybe a little something to show. I'm just going from how I read the post. If I read it that way someone else might. :) I think it is personally a great idea. 
---
What area are all those meant for? Why did it work in FO4?
---
Because generally having one guy one shot'ing everything in a group is boring as hell for everyone else... 
---
I called my character Mother Tazer, but my Bethesda username I chose so long ago comes up instead, I am so disappointed.

This is a fantastic story. Thumbs up for you!
---
This post was removed too
---
Ditto. Chances are they may not come back, so why waste all the goodies. 
---
A guy did that to me, and I had two hours worth of junk.  He took it at the munitions factory. I saw him, so went back, and we started fighting...I died, he died etc.  Finally he realised I was pissed about losing my junk...lol...he made me 1k rounds of fusion cells. I was happy...gave the thumbs up and we went on our way.
---
"Get away from her you bitch!" Best. Scene. Ever
---
&gt;  My low level ass had a ten cap bounty for accidentally looting from an owned lead extractor I stumbled upon in the middle of nowhere. It wasn't even locked (do those ones even lock?).
---
They do. It is not explained at all. I only discovered that you can lock containers because I was pouring myself another drink and had time to look at the action menu. People rarely lock extractors because it costs springs.
---
Frankly I think if you don't lock an extractor it should be equivalent to marking the contents as unowned. For one thing I would enjoy putting up some resource extractors near newbie areas and letting people get things they need like water. I have tons; I don't need any more.
---
&gt; I play in pacifist mode to avoid this type of thing all together. I have no interest in PvP.
---
Fallout and PvP go together like cookies and ass. If you're really into ass then I guess that might work for you, but otherwise that's a weird fucking mix and you shouldn't force it on everyone.
---
If it wasn't for me playing this with a dedicated wingwoman (my wife) the always-on no-safe-zone PvP would have soured me on this game long ago. Without someone you can reliably ask to kill you to reset your bounty you can very easily get in a situation like yours.
---
Also, said it before, will say it again: this is the *worst* PvP system I have ever seen or experienced, and I am including The Division's Dark Zone during the early days of the game.

https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fallout-76-funko-pops-coming-starting-this-month/1100-6462183/
---
I have one of these I got from GameStop the day I bought 76. 
---
There are welcome mats but they don't change the fast travel spawn point. 
---
The ammo is energy, so Batteries Included will reduce its weight. You‚Äôll see it listed under Energy when you‚Äôre crafting 2mm. 
---
Furious I think? I have a furious combat knife. There must be some cap on the damage. I tried using it on the Queen, but it was really underwhelming.
---
&gt;Are you free right now? The HOA would like to evaluate your CAMP.
---
I have found plenty of two shot weapons, and one explosive junkies gause rifle, but the only TSE weapons I have I purchased on 76 bazaar. That‚Äôs after 400 ish hours of playing. 
---
Personally I don‚Äôt care for the TSE weapons as much, and found that I prefer regular two shot guns. However I am keeping them in my storage for SBQ fights because why not, failing that event is infuriating so might as well give her all we got.
---
I'm not against a buy back option. Or the ability to tag not for sale or whatever.
---
But all these posts come often come across as it's Bethesda's fault for a player not paying attention. 
---
Yep. It's crazy but the whole plan system is kinda messed up. The dude at Whitesprings sells all the bed plans except the really basic ones (mattress, military cot).
---
Bunk Bed - speaks for itself
---
Simple Modern Bed - the bed with the blue Vault-Tec comforter
---
Fancy Bed - the four poster bed with the draped curtains
---
Vault-Tec Bed 1 - the clean mattress double bed
---
Vault-Tec Bed 2 - the double bed with the grey comforter
---
Yeah, I can confirm.  Gragnak axe is the only one that I've found it doesn't work on.
---
Like you wouldn't just sit and smile while exp is flowing
---
Started keeping around 50-100 in storage and 20-40 on my character.  It's not been an issue unless I go farming for lead.  I'm never short for long since gunpowder rains from the sky.
---
This sounds more like the Stallone Dredd, rather than the far superior Urban.

Jeez, you two get a room already.

#NOW I DON'T WANT YOU TO BE THINKING PAL ROSE IS GOING SOFT ON YOU SO LET ME SAY THIS
---
I give ya an upvote for being honest but damn son, just switch gun pal to something that does half damage, Don't be the shellfish person who doesn't share the farm. Just wondering do launch nukes yourself if so maybe you feel like you've earned them, still bad play but understandable. If not your nuke well no excuse man
---
i stay away from explosives cus i dont trust myself. my favorite experience in pvp was when i ran from my camp to defend a workshop and i forgot to repair my good weapon and was dehydrated and starving. only had death tambo and they won. when i went back they werent pvp enabled anymore so i just punched at the guy while he did emotes back. as soon as he punched back, probably thinking it would go the same as it did, i dropped him in 3 hits. he immediately logged out after i stole his junk
---
In the description of the actual item it lists that it changes the fast travel point of your camp and there is only one available per location unless it is bugged.
---
Sure and they can simply not pay.  Do some research into small claims.  You can win and they can still simply not pay.  
---
Are you a high enough gunsmith/Armorer level? You still need to be the right crafting level to attach a mod. 
---
Thank you!!!! Too bad they're pops but i might still get em
---
I'd prefer a system where everyone in a certain range gets the xp shared as well as loot drops. I mean everyone in a nuke zone is pretty much a team anyway and at least this way it stops the whole TSE/one-shot crap where some people wont get the rewards. 
---
Nope but good thought.
---
Seen it, waste of a nuke
---
I held off until 50 to finish main quests after I got Overseer's journal to Welch and Main to Top of the World. If you wait, the legendary quest rewards will be max level (50). 
---
Don't do the missing kid one in Toxic Valley either till 50, it gives a nice 10mm machine gun with a fire DoT. I did it at 20 :\
---
That's confusing since (at least in my experience) turret kills give you no loot on the corpses.
---
Did read the post, I just don't think it's as bad a problem as you explain it. I did misunderstand that though, I thought the wait was the worst part for you.
---
Have you not seen long threads going back and forth before?
---
We are two months later, I got the game a few days ago and thirst is seriously busting my balls. Hunger is not a problem at all, but what the fuck I keep having to drink and it's never enough.
---
I'm only concerned about playing in a way that is fun and not irritating if I cared about min/max I'd be using shotgun or melee
---
true,true.
---
Yeah, good one
---
I'd like to see decon arches just take base materials too.
---
I've got plenty of flux, but I'm sure it sucks for lower level people trying to struggle bus their way into getting flux.
---
This is how I feel. Nothing gets resolved if we choose to ignore it. I see it's already turned people against each other in the community. 
---
Turn up the heat so Bethesda understands this is a major issue that needs addressing sooner than later. 
---
Noted. The HOA is here when you're ready, unless this goes nowhere then tough luck. :)
---
Oh, you just want to whine and complain.
---
See ya!
---
dude that is a fat l
---
 Are you free right now? The HOA would like to evaluate your CAMP. 
---
I hated that mission! - the wendigo was a punk, but the 3! Mirelurk Kings that guarded him were downright prissy.  I finally loaded up the PA and the automatic grenade launcher to beat that one.
---
I've not run into a griefer in my time, two pvp instances though when shooting broke out for the hell of it between me and two other players.  I killed one and the other one got me (I was like level 11 and they were lvl 8 and 30 something).  Most of the time, if someone wants to start pvp with you, you'll start getting hit before you know whats going on when someone's out to do pvp.  
---
I like Instigating, 40% power attack and +1 str
---
This combo lets you 1 Shot enemies 
---
I have an instigating war drum, changed my game dramatically. I guess swing speed increase would be ok but really doesnt need it.
---
If there was a 11. It would be interesting if Bethesda adds some good emotes like one for ex.- a guy or women showing of caps(cap flexing)  pretty much flexing. It be hilarious but other than that I hope someone from the community sees all these points that youve made . Its great that this is one of the first website where there is a strong community where everyone can speak on their ideas and help influence or give wake to a new idea.
---
My base is in the south along the border of the Savage divide and cranberry bog and I get vengeful mothmen that show up there, but there is also the daily queen of the hunt in the mire. It sends you after a random cryptid.
---
That doesn't work for me. It did in FO4, but not in 76. I have to convert to a doorway, then convert back. Otherwise it acts like the wall is still there. 
---
Bloodied, anything with good build you get 3.5k+ damage 
---
I'm asking BGS to consider fixing this bug or oversight, so end game isn't everyone using the same few builds and same few PAs, like they currently always are on Queen/Whitespring. 
---
**Using End Game gear in End Game. What a novel idea right!?**
---
As tu beaucoup de plans de structures dans ton CAMP?
---
It would definitely be nice, but...
---
Did you know you can move the physical CAMP item to a different spot and it will change where you fast travel into?  I had to tweak my cliff-side CAMP a few times before I could safely travel home fast-style. 
---
TSE Faster reload speed, bloodied 40 swing speed +1 strength.
---
Pat yourself on the back, then go jerk off in a mirror loser. 
---
Some people want to look like they have a mole rat hole in their hair. 
---
i wish they had at least 1 energy melee weapon. the shiskebob might count but i'd love to have a sonic fist
---
Awesome, I appreciate the information. I had high hopes for the military cot, as I'd been doing an actual camping spot, complete with large tent. Now that I upgraded to an actual house with brick walls, I'd like to move up to a nicer bed.
---
Thanks again!
---
Just use an antidote or a remedy
---
Found it lady night with the marine armor arms plans
---
This game will scrap mods before scrapping your bulk materials too. Smh. 
---
That's not the Fancy Bed - the fancy bed you can buy in game has no posts.  The four poster is from the Atom store...  the fancy bed in game is just fancy wood but no posts.
---
You need to change "objectively speaking" to "subjectively speaking", because this is 100% your opinion and you don't speak for me. Many people, myself included, find this to be an awesome game that is well done, but admittedly has some bugs that need to be fixed. For my playstyle, the bugs are minor annoyances and I feel like I  regularly get way more hours of fun than I paid for.
---
Further, the amount of vulgarity in your post really makes you look like an entitled brat who is unable to articulate like a reasonable adult. This really detracts from your opinion being taken seriously.
---
Was this thread removed without a proper reason? That only makes me wanna dig deeper on what's going on.
---
Same. I keep a furious TS pump action for that sort of thing since I'm all perk stacked for shotguns. The issue is actually closing the distance without dying. It only takes a semi accurate burst and you die.
---
I can answer this with authority, as someone who's looked at the game files and tested it..
---
**Vampiric:**
---
2 HP healed over 2 ticks (1/per), and it stacks additive..
---
So 2 hits in 1 tick = 4 HP per 2 ticks (or 2/Per).
---
In short faster weapons are better with it.
---
Notes:
---
It is not currently working properly with "Continuous" weapons like the "Ripper", "Mr. handy Buzz Blade" and flamer, but is exceptional on Miniguns, assault rifles, daggers, etc.
---
Just wanted to see how much butthurt would come of 2 words 
---
Antibiotics or Disease Cure.
---
Why extra small the bigger the better

Non, il m'en reste qu'un seul qui regroupe juste un g√©n√©rateur √† fusion, un drapeau US rien de plus.

LAMP
---
Your melting, lol
---
The "Fast Travel Mat" you are thinking of is in the build menu when you are in a workshop, but its missing from the build menu for CAMP. Apparently it was there in beta and was removed.
---
ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
Way to embrace the douchbag role play. Are you also a raider? 
---
Mats were in the menu in BETA, not sure why they were removed.  Maybe because they don‚Äôt work reliably?  Whereas all the workshops are not on cliffs?
---
Mats were grandfathered in CAMPs from beta and it often wouldn‚Äôt work anyway, I‚Äôd spawn locationally where the mat was but fall through anyway 
---
You can either use a Disease Cure or some Antibiotics. 
---
And the ‚ÄúNothing is Real‚Äù thing at Watoga High
---
Someone left me a modded 10mm pistol and 300 bullets at my last death spot after witnessing me punching ghouls because I ran out of .38 for the pipe pistol 
---
Four levels later and I am still using the same pistol - thanks mysterious stranger :D
---
Oh ok thanks for the information.
---
I love how mad you are, you're hilarious why don't you take your own advice, you'd never say that to me in person you're pathetic. 
---
The worst part about it as that theres a Nexus mod that enables text chat. So it's totally not like they couldnt do it and theres no excuse for it to not be there.  At the very least they should put it in the Pip-Boy as like a shitty texting gimmick. 
---
I honestly don‚Äôt get this.  Every time I go to a Whitesprings nuke, nothing on the golf course mutates, and the only thing I can find is a shit ton of Radodendron up by the cabins.  Throw in a handful of whatever carrot flowers turn into, and I get like one stable yellowcake and a handful of fluorescents.  If I‚Äôm lucky, I might maybe find a couple cobalts and crimsons, but never enough to craft anything stable before it goes inert.
---
That's probably the other guy, the flatwoods monster. It looks like a alien. 
---
I'm a packrat so usually crawl out of there with like 9,000 pounds of crap and then drop it on "Mules", but point is sound :)
---
It‚Äôs great helping people some times.
---
It‚Äôs also fun to sneak up on people on their pip boy or crafting and trying to scare them...was easier when more people had area chat on.
---
Half the time depending on the disease I just wait it out, some though are a pain in the ass if they have a long duration.  You can see the time remaining in the effects screen under STATS.
---
Hey, I'm on xb1, lvl 92+. Add me and we can venture around and help you level up some. Gt: sonicrun83
---
I wasn't actually thinking about pvp tbh, but yes I see what you mean. I am fairly sure it's multiplicative but those two particular bonuses get stupid fairly fast when stacked:
---
7 pieces of sentinel/assassin's (-15% not moving, -8% from players) - if it's in PvP we can assume (probably) that these stack to 23%.
---
So 100 damage -&gt; 16.05
---
Then Lone Wanderer - 16.05 -&gt; 12.84
---
Serendipity - 12.84 -&gt; 7.06
---
Dodgy - 7.06 -&gt; 4.94
---
And if it's melee: Blocker - 4.94 -&gt; 2.72
---
Shooting or hitting them even once procs Suppressor - 2.72 -&gt; 1.90
---
We're at 98% DR here and this hasn't taken into account base armour values for DR and ER or Nerd Rage...
---
It appears that stupidly high DR is possible no matter how you do it, I just want to figure out if the Sentinel mod or the Unyielding mod, or a mix, is the best way to go for my little theorycrafted "Bane of WV" character :)
---
Odd. When I‚Äôm ‚Äòholding‚Äô the wall it‚Äôs like it‚Äôs in limbo. The stairs don‚Äôt work for me that way though. 
---
Wait, Funko is different than Funko pops? I‚Äôve only ever seen the pops. 
---
I guess
---
I change my build a lot but the the important perks are heavy gunner(at least 1 point per card), stabilized, gunsmith, power patcher, ammo smith and super duper. The heavy gunner and stabilized help keep your damage up so you‚Äôre not wasting ammo, gunsmith and power patcher slow gun and armor degradation and keep the repairs cheap, and both ammo smith and super duper are used to craft ammo faster than you‚Äôre burning it.  Heavy guns PA is all about just keeping every thing repaired, fueled and loaded. 
---
If you‚Äôre using a gatling laser then use the perk to slow fusion core drain but otherwise you‚Äôll have plenty and never have to leave the armor except to craft. 
---
One gun army is pretty useful crowd control but I don‚Äôt feel like it‚Äôs required, others disagree and swear by though. 
---
Pick weight reduction perks and other utility at your discretion depending on what you keep on your person. 
---
Best all around guns are the Gatling Gun followed by the .50cal because they have ammo that‚Äôs crafted easily and in large amounts while keeping a good amount of damage per shot.
---
Grafton steel mill is the best place to farm ammo. It has a lead extractor, 2 steel extractors that produce a ton and is flooded with super mutants that drop steel weapons and lots of gun powder, if you build your camp on a lead vein to go along with that and you can get ammo very quickly by clearing the steel mill and emptying the extractors in between doing other missions and exploring. 
---
If I think of something else I‚Äôve left out I‚Äôll add an edit below. 
---
Its because he's smarter than us. That's why he hates the game so much. All of us trying to enjoy a game we bought are just fan-boys who are too stupid to see the (imaginary) big picture that only him and other hate-filled, oh I mean intelligent, people see so easily.
---
Saw another nuke later that night, I "think" they might have reduced the number that spawns, consistently the 3 in the kitchen and couple by the pool table were not spawning, which is about 5, if one or two others didn't as well... 
---
I only know the tea-bag waltz
---
I play with a friend from Australia, and I'm in North America. So, *yes*.
---
never seen one... at 82.
---
My son and I are opposite, I play fearless and will run towards a group of enemies twice my level shooting them in the face, replying to thier taunts.  I love super mutants the best, they say oof sometimes on the headshot and I have the best smack talk sessions with them.
---
You win this round grynde7
---
One suggestion I'd make about this (if you haven't already figured it out) - have some perk cards at different ranks that you can switch out to use another perk but still have the original albeit at a lower rank.  I do this with some of the weight altering perks - sometimes I'll equip a maxed out bandolier, but sometimes I'll just use a 1/2* and use the leftover points for something else.
---
Lol Bethesda should be held accountable grow the fuck up 
---
And yes I motion to ban duper posts on this sub it's a fucking dead horse 
---
I had same issue. I fixed it by moving that overhead projector C.A.M.P. thing away from cliff - as in edit mode **not** Move CAMP mode
---
Ugh, I really hope it's not additive.
---
Otherwise 7 pieces of armour with -15% DR while standing still will give you 105% DR - i.e. cannot die.
---
Yea u need to be away from camp though
---
I'd stay away from all mods for the time being.
---
Your level 36 why dont you have the excavator armor yet?
---
Yes yes this was my intention!
---
nope you're right! I got them confused with the Dorbz!
---
Wow that's a stellar idea! Yea I kind of gave up trying to think of a creative solution like that. This post too, will be downvoted to oblivion I'm sure. 
---
I really hope that Bethesda somehow tackles this problem 
---
Just found out about this bug because it ate my legendary fire axe with 50% extra limb damage, more damage lower the health, and +1 strength. Also it ate my excavator left leg....
---
Tie the fast travel perk into that encumbrance. Weightx2 you walk instead of run, but can still fast travel at twice the cost with the perk. Weightx3 you can't move and no fast travel either way.
---
I thought someone (don't remember who) said that Camp McClintock was a/the spawn point for those? 
---
&gt;make sure to have the green thumb perk equipped, as you will get 2x the amount of flux
---
TIL
---
Seriously give it a try sometime in a group, take a vampiric weapon and just have fun "tagging" everything or crippling... 
---
I've got a pretty revealing tattered dress that I think would work perfectly. My character is also a man, so you'll have something for everyone. 
---
Yeah, I hate how long it takes to reload my melee weapons.
---
Where did you get the porta-potty plan? Haven‚Äôt found it and searching hasn‚Äôt yielded anything.

cant let us keep climbing and keep the content the same. Is the same as my first lvl 50 whitesprings and now im 130something. Want more monsters damnit.

Thanks a lot guys, this is really strange wow  ... So maybe I can ask one last thing...?! if you got it from serum or by RAD are you during movement completely invisible or only like Chameleon parts when you not / or very slow move?

Just asking because I saw a player in a very nice "old style" woman dress and she was moving complete invisible, I only recognize by accidental touching her during my walk and afterwards by looking on the map... 
---
I have a level 50 Perfect Storm. It's good for using up excess ammo and it's fun lighting low-mid level enemies on fire, but it's not an end game gun by any means.
---
Learned it the hard way too - server connection error and my first character I worked on for two hours was gone

Remaking the same character was much easier and faster the second time around and I even improved the look quite a bit

Phew! I was about to start second guessing my Fallout collection. Hah.

&gt;Youtubers will complain about cheating and how bad Fallout76 is, then go on and admit to duping

Yeah, Youtubers are the devil! Good thing there wasn't a thread on this sub where someone ranted a wall of text complaining about duping/cheaters and admitted that they did as well. And comments that called them a hypocrite got downvoted.
---
11. Allow me to go into Nuke zones without Power Armor. I hate that I wasted cards on a non-Power Armor build and can't play end game content.
---
..agree..
---
Actually thinking it might be fun to nuke some other locations, see what happens..
---
Might not end up with exactly the same experience, but it could still be fun.
---
This is still just a theory, and I think Scout mods are buggy (haven't been able to apply my "Stabilized" mod to ANY piece yet), but-  
---
The mods for the arms/legs seem to cost less (like half?) what the mods for the chest piece cost. So if you see one from the Enclave vendor that's like 150 or so, that's probably for the chest piece... if it's like 70-80, arm or leg. 
---
It happens to me sometimes. It is like I just can't attack with the weapon, I click but nothing happens. I solve it by switching weapons or buy sheathing the weapon I'm carrying and pulling it back out.

Single Revolver Ivory Grip plans.

It is pretty brief though so wouldn't mind some more exposition. 
---
Can we get a better bounty system? I go to help low levels defend a workshop, but because a stray bullet winged a fucking trashcan, I'm wanted? That's kinda BS.
---
"Oh just turn off PvP" if I have it on there's a reason. Usually dealing with griefers or bountyhunting myself.
---
They should really have a better set of rules of what would constitute actual hostility. Like say, Shooting a structure multiple times or destroying it, instead of some randoricochet sentencing me to death by a sneaky ass hat with a hunting rifle.
---
Yeah had a Level 200 with a Explosive Minigun that wandered into the Uranium Fever event that was killing everything before any chance to get a tag it. I just fast traveled out no use wasting any more time on the event.
---
I really don't.    
---
Objective facts are quantifiable with proof. This game was released in a buggy state. This is objective fact.  This game has received multiple updates to fix major bugs, and there are many, many major bugs that have not yet been addressed. These are objective facts.   
---
What is subjective is the enjoyment that you, I, and others get out of this game \_despite\_ the observable, provable facts about the incomplete, buggy, state of the launch title, and the morally questionable, and the demonstrably illegal, actions of the company around specific aspects of the game launch, from the fraud of promising one product and shipping another (those bags with the pre-order copies? That's literally, legally, fraud).  Publishing a product at a "discounted price" without first releasing it at it's full price, is illegal in multiple countries.   
---
So again. This game is subjectively enjoyable, but objectively unfinished.   
---
I will, I suppose, have to state that "garbage" is my view, and as such is subjective, but "unfinished" is not. That is objective fucking fact.

Is it confirmed that items put in those boxes remain for other players? I was about to do that the other night, but was concerned it would just decay out of sight so I dropped on the floor in front of it.

Wait, you're assuming that because the game is rated M that the playerbase are adults?

Disease Cure or Antibiotics.  You can find them in white med containers, yellow chem containers, and very rarely in blue chem containers.

Alternatively you can find plans to make Forest, Ash Heap, Toxic Valley, etc disease cures.  But they take some materials that make it painful to farm for.

I agree with all of that in multiplayer online games. Cheating is a big problem, because it directly affects every other player.

But in single player games, it‚Äôs understandable, especially once you‚Äôve played through it 20 times. For example, when I start a new build in fo4, I‚Äôll use console commands to start myself off at level 40 or something, so I can quickly spec my character, allow myself to build high level power generators and weapons, and avoid the first 24 hour grind. 
---
Many people failed to understand that fo76 is not your classic fallout game, and these harmless exploits you would have used in fo4, aren‚Äôt harmless anymore. People became totally inconsiderate towards other players, and now we have a major problem with the economy.
---
How are you going to stop the people who don't use containers and just use the bag that is created when you drop something?
---
No. A youtuber is someone who gets most of their income from YouTube or streaming
---
Yeah, like on Xbox or PS4, not sure how it works on PC though.
---
Lol pretty sure this post was made about me. Did you beat my head in with a melee weapon while I was modding a gun and have your low level friend steal my junk, then voice message me saying I should be happy you didn't nuke me for 10 caps? 
---
i use reshade and a ton of mods. ive also tried using cheat engine. nothing happens. they only ban people who talk shit to other players ingame.
---
In my experience, using the MIRV is more likely to kill you than to even damage whatever enemy you're aiming at. I use mine almost exclusively for random fireworks shows (or for surprising my teammates with random explosions since pacifist mode means they don't take damage).
---
Username does not check out
---
Ugh. Gross.
---
That‚Äôs debatable, I still think I‚Äôm correct üòÇ
---
Try switching weapons when that happens.
---
Sometimes my character gets the "wont swing" bug.  Switching weapons fixes it.
---
Do you want my crossbow bolts?  I hate dropping them, would rather give them to a good home.
---
Wait a minute, so they are saying "For $30 bucks I'll give you 5 minutes of my time, AND I'll throw in 25k caps for free! But if you give me $50, I'll give you 5 minutes of my time, AND throw in 50k in caps!"  
---
I will admit that back when I was a lowly office drone and telecommuter, I would grind Warcraft accounts to high levels and then sell them.  Paid for a few Disney trips that way.  But I never thought it was "my time" I was selling. huh.
---
If you capture a workshop it should give you the plans, iirc.
---
I cannot imagine spending real money to buy nothing but caps. There's barely anything worth buying from Vendors anyway. As for buying gear from other players, for real money, why don't you just play the game? 
---
Shoot the commie liberators!  Lolol
---
Thats the gauss rifle, not the tesla.
---
Nah fam, just hide in the toilet and open the door periodically to take pot shots.
---
That‚Äôs what I did as a level 8 on my first character in a hazmat suit.  (No idea I could jump up on the wall to escape if needed)
---
Thanks for apologizing, but I took it the wrong way as well.
---
I am just going to respectfully disagree with you and move on. Its clear you have some bitterness that I am not going to have any positive impact on.
---
If you're on PC I'll buy. I chew through ammo with the .50 cal
---
Hold space. Note it uses both AP and Fusion Core to power the jetpack, but it is fun.
---
I'm on ps4, so unless your on another console or pc, I'd be happy to take them.
---
None really... You can make it on demand with cloth and acid and with super duper you get even more. 
---
I don't bother holding it unless I've got lead waiting on steel to churn out a few thousand rounds. 
---
All other places I nuke have worse spawns. Best is whitesprings. Second Fissure Site Prime. Everything else has been utter garbage if you want anything else than flux. 
---
Only other semi meh is Clarksburg in Toxic Valley. 
---
At the very least make the Science cards stop energy weapons from degrading so goddamn fast. I have a Two Shot Laser Rifle with a Splitter mod and 6 clips will take that thing from full repair condition to ~30%. 
---
The worst part is that I actually love the power on that weapon, but I can't afford to stop every 10 minutes to repair it.
---
Any rules or can I just get a minigun and walk through? üòÇüòÇ
---
No. You are making up a definition. There is no consensus for that.

---
Nothing in there about subscriber count or percent of income. Also this fucking youtuber has a sponser, Youtubers have sponsors.  
---
Who said only ammo vending?
---
Most people just give away the shit they duped for free. I bet there is a large part of the community(there is) that would take that stuff no questions asked. I suspect a lot of people are mad they don't get shit for free and are witch hunting.
---
What? Bitch about Youtubers or bitch about cheaters? Because that's this subs two favorite topics and the things they blame people not liking the game on. 
---
Ohhh to the contrary I would say all of this to your face and if you said that shit about my mom I‚Äôd knock you the fuck out. No go away ffs. 
---
But you‚Äôre not...they were removed from the camp but not workshops.
---
Any of that is great I guess but if the game doesn‚Äôt run without frequent crashes I‚Äôll never stick around. The duping has to be stopped first. Then maybe consider a clean slate. I‚Äôd be ok with getting my inventory wiped if it meant we could have a stable platform going forward. Without that I don‚Äôt think the game has much of a future regardless of whatever changes they make or content they add. It has to run properly. 
---
Is there a "Home Plate" recipe?  I have been looking in game to no avail, but it should be a fast travel point if it exists.
---
Xbox here. Oh well.
---
Know how you combat TSE weapons from people who aren‚Äôt being considerate enough to let others tag? Strafe in front of them repeatedly at point blank.  
---
They‚Äôll either kill themselves or switch to a different weapon.
---
I regular check registers, especially at Whitesprings. I‚Äôve picked up many a legendary/plan from them, while depositing my own when I can. 
---
No wanted level ^^
---
Not oversight, deliberate decision. Power armor doesn't get legendary affixes. Regular armor doesn't get high rad/dmg resist.
---
That's it. End of story. It's called BALANCE. 
---
SAME AF.  No idea why this was not a feature of the game from the start.
---
Can you get/but more orbital strikes?
---
Blaming all of them gets more karma, though. 
---
Can you show me any post where someone complained about it being removed from camps? Sounds like something people would shit a brick about and it‚Äôs not something I‚Äôve seen any complaints about at all
---
I wouldn‚Äôt have known about it if they didn‚Äôt tell me
---
Just because it‚Äôs a popular opinion doesn‚Äôt mean there needs to be a new post every day about it. These repeated posts are flooding the sub.
---
I could understand someone doing a video like - watch out for duped items - but a how to dupe seems like it would mean they had to cheat and thus should be banned
---
Under the Resources tab, it‚Äôs the fertilizer option.
---
I also couldn't find them forever.  Take over any workshop and you will get them for the workshop and your camp, even if it doesn't say you did in the quest reward.  Worked for me too.
---
WK still seems way better for the same amount of points. Perhaps lucky break would be useful if you want to free up some points in agility while not using(or not fully optimizing) a Crit build. But imo, the perk could use a buff
---
If I had the time in the day to even get them all done I know I would :(

I think that's some playstation only functionality.  There's no text chat for PC.

(Top Ranking Noob) and he has a few VERY GOOD VIDS. on cap stash running. There's 6 cap stash around the river side area-2 in charlestown-10 in posedien power plant AND.... 5 in nuka power plant. All these areas are within distance to one another. Fast traveling invest would be 6-12 caps if you don't include the perk card fast travel.

Same here

I am young, desperate and really need those quantum colas

Where do I sign up?

The prototype and regular are at Emmett Mountain Disposal
---
Regular or prototype?
---
Awesome! The songs on the radio in game must be a real nostalgia trip for him.
---
Nah wendigos have the same origin as their real-world legend, more or less. There's a quest in the Mire that explains the wendigo origin.
---
I'm pretty sure I got mine the first time I took over a workshop, they give you a wack of plans the first time you do it, I believe a generator and the  small purifer are one of them. If not, i got it from an over-seers box, thats how you get the other two. 
---
I'm at level 97 myself, haven't had anything interesting to do for weeks on 76 so I haven't played since before Christmas. I want the level 100 achievement but I just can't bring myself to play again. I mean, what am I going to do for those last 3 levels? Farm another fuckin nuke zone, I guess. thrilling. 
---
Dude...look at the title of this thread.
---
I will in a few days! I ordered it on sale for PS4 and I'll be starting over. Probably going to do an energy weapons focus on this go around. Still totally down to explore and take it slow.
---
If it's like Belly of the Beast, you don't have to redo the earlier steps, even if the quest log points to them. With BotB, I crashed inside the Glassed Cavern and when I got back in I was outside and the quest wanted me to locate the first beacon again. I just headed back into the cavern and the quest finished when I found Paladin Taggerdy.
---
I have 3 pieces of scorched gear and scorchbeasts do little to nothing to me. Also, there are only 6 pieces of armor, no? 2 hand, 2 feet, 1 leg n 1 chest. Would like to see how that works honestly. 
---
"Regular armor doesn't get high rad/dmg resist."
---
Wrong. You can stack RR on regular armor to be 2-4x more than PA.  It's just broken at the moment. These items and perks exist for 0 reason. You're defending items existing in the game that do almost nothing. Imagine being that apologetic. 
---
"That's it. End of story. It's called BALANCE."
---
Not being able to use end game armor in end game. Todd Balance.
---
Press space to jump, then press and hold space to use the jetpack.  It's essentially a double jump.
---
Adorable that you think a guy wouldn't buy a chick something to get laid
---
No, but we're can shame them. The effectiveness of shaming someone who willingly cheats themselves is debatable but they are actively making the game less enjoyable so fuck them
---
I don't use my explosive shotgun and go with melee, but the problem is that I one hit with melee as well. If I see lower levels, I try to let them get at least a shot off first. If it is a high level? Welp everything is fair game since we could both one shot lol.
---
The prototype suit or a regular hazmat suit? Just off the top of my head you cam find damaged and pristine hazmat suits in any of the 3 power plants, but that's only a small percentage of where they spawn. The prototype hazmat suit is the same as a regular hazmat suit just in a different color. Not to spoil anything, but you get it by doing the free states quest line that starts in harpers ferry based on a side misc objective.
---
&gt;Further, the amount of vulgarity in your post really makes you look like an entitled brat who is unable to articulate like a reasonable adult. This really detracts from your opinion being taken seriously.
---
Only if someone is looking for any reason at all, no matter how petty, to ignore their opinion. 
---
If your stash is full you shouldnt need any junk.  If you manage your inventory correct. 
---
Manage inventory: determining max qtys of each junk type for stash. Keeping them there. Selling excess junk to vendors. Dropping/scrapping what you dont need. 
---
Get your shit together! Most of the junk i dont actively use i keep a max of 100, some 50. Stuff i like gets up to 200. I have almost 2 armor sets and 3 weapons and 50+ ballistic fiber.
---
My stash is usually around 515 and u dont have to run back to camp when i am playing with people.   
---
Sometimes ill go to watoga or whitesprings solo and loot everything. Not scrap it, but instead sell the junk to the 2 vendors to make 800 caps.
---
Sometimes ill go loot junk until i am 400 lbs overencumbrred. Scrap it. Then add the scrap til my stash is full. Bulk what is beyond my set limits for each junk type and sell them. 
---
Also i bulk everything im keeping to reduce stash weight. 
---
When im ready for multiplayer, i will be good fpr hours without going back to camp. 
---
Im also melee and have almost 400 lbs carry weight with no PA or perk cards for weight reduction. 
---
You...should have the forest disease cure plan automatically by doing the main quest. You get forest salve and forest disease cure just handed to you. 
---
I respond to being called a douchebag and I'm a douchebag? fuck off.
---
Are you sure that isn't from the sultry supermutant named Francis? 
---
We keep it 100, 5 by 5, on the level, etc. We pay for what we like, and deduct for what we don't. No catch, just honest CAMP reviews. The Wasteland is too good for crappy CAMPs.
---
Nvm thanks any way got the undamaged 
---
Known issue. Don't shoot the robots.
---
Those Youtubers only wait for some news to hate on Fallout 76, glad that there are some gems like Oxhorn who made a very fair review and is not ashamed of enyoing the game very much.
---
Everything Stallone does fascinates- it's like watching a talking bear.
---
Same here. I usually just use my prototype hazmat suit and prepare myself for a quick death if I get hit by something. I'd like an armored varient of the hazmat suit or let us wear our armor pieces under it.
---
Got the undamaged

I wand to be Vice President with the Mayor of Grafton as president.  He has my vote!

I'm pretty sure that wendigos, although cryptids, can have variants, including Legendaries.

I got the undamaged thanks any ways

You're right, looking at my own finds, there's no hat.
---
Even 6 is 90% DR immediately though.
---
Same experience here. Disconnected usually twice per hour and evenings are the worst. I've been really patient with this game since the day one, but it has become almost unplayable. 
---
And like you, I'd even pay a few euros for a stable server.

Will do. I usually run with my buddy same level as me if you don't mind a third. Gt tiptoebaggins

You destroyed someone's base over a possible accidental 5 cap bounty?
---
Sounds like you're the hardened criminal my dude
---
This is not true on xbox at all. I bounty hunt every opportunity I get and a very common tactic for the hunted to use is to secure their base and hide inside.
---
You get a bounty from damaging it or picking locks.
---
Similar thing happened to me, except I got a second set of Excavator. 
---
so much free farminggggg
---
Won't stop them, will pisses them off tho.
---
Containers in workshops can be locked, paper bags can't. Containers don't glitch, bags can disappear in the void.
---
Wouldn't be a huge fix but a small step forward
---
I don't. My buddy placed it when I wasn't looking. I just dropped the C.A.M.P so I could get a discount fast traveling. 
---
Honestly it wasnt about quick service. It was about being told I wasnt qualified for service whatsoever, and customer support telling me "seek other service providers" when I knew it was possible.  I would have been ok with being told it would take some time, but being disregarded entirely was not acceptable. 
---
Unfortunately the Slay Bells skin for the death tambo seems to not make noise at all. 
---
I switch pacifist mode on and pull a flamer then just fire strait through them so I tag them all 
---
also great time to use rockets or grenade launchers just get up high and chuck them into clusters of enemies you see
---
Yes like people who didn't buy the game reporting the game is broken and unplayable
---
Congratulations, you succed in comprehend reading, is it first one kiddo?
---
Good Advice! I have a secondary weapon with Suppressor so if the enemies do less damage to me while I let my friends get hits in. 
---
i've been using the registers,  the oversears caches, and the garbage can by my base.
---
Why do you have to be a toxic sack of shit? Seriously, what's damaged in your head that "oh hey I want to show off cool builds" turns into "AND THEN SHIT ON THE PEOPLE WHO MADE THEM BECAUSE I'M A SACK OF SHIT"? 
---
I got mine on the roof of the Poseidon energy plant. Take the stairs on the outside of the building. On the roof there will be a small pod/orange trailer thing with the hazmat suit inside.
---
Also Poseidon Energy Plant WV-06. Outside, up on the roof area inside one of the smaller structures. It's located on the lower roof, not the higher one that the stairs lead to.
---
I agree, I've done this a few times to and all I can think it welp that's what you get for spamming a key and not paying attention. Completely my fault. 
---
Yea, don‚Äôt shoot the robots, fucking madman. 
---
If you log out after seeing that message and log back in the game will set the camp back down for you in its spot. You just happened to load into a server where that spot was already taken. 
---
If this isn't a bug, I can only assume it was to sell more PA skins.
---
Post or private message us your PSN name.

well you also get to perpetuate a persecution complex if you do. Because as we a

ll know, if you are a fan of the IP you must construct additional straw men to defend it, no matter how valid the complaints.
---
Indeed it does. Personally it keeps me from having to suit up during a nuke üòú
---
Yea, COD Black Ops players were complaining about a red reticle being 1 dollar.
---
Meanwhile this game has more pathetic items for over 20 dollars
---
I've come across this too.  I get out of it by swapping to a different weapon and swapping back.  It's good to use the radial menu and assign things to the number buttons for this reason.
---
I don't know exactly what causes it.  It's probably some combination of either you or the enemy blocking an attack and it doesn't register that you finished swinging.
---
I must have had it work as a fluke. I only tested it for about 10-15 kills but my Ripper with vamp was healing extraordinarily fast. Did next to 0 damage on the enemies tho, so the trade off wasnt worth it.
---
The golf course is a very popular location, it‚Äôs quite possible that someone has settled in your spot, returning your camp to your inventory. 
---
You can either server hop (in which case if there‚Äôs space your camp will be placed where you left it) it you can place it down elsewhere free of charge. 
---
They're the Jeb! Guac Bowl of weapons.
---
If bullets were worth 1 cap thats all i would ever need to sell.
---
Im already richer, with more carry weight and inventory space than the people i play with.

They pay me for lead and steel. I give away ammo now. I like giving away ammo.

Thats all.

Form a circuit and develop alternating routes.

I have xbox too but I NEVER crash I have crashed maybe 2-3 times in my 50 hours of playing
---
A Lifesaving armor piece one day, and another day it was about 20 Fusion Cores. 
---
No.  The idea is that you are not selling an item (bottlecaps) but the *time you spent* collecting that item.
---
How far back did you stalk me to see posts anywhere else? 
---
My Lvl 45 Vampire Combat Knife is my go to melee weapon.  Even bloated ones have a hard time out damaging the healing. 
---
IMO it has improved ALOT from the moment the beta was out. Its still a work in progress. 
---
As far as the game improving it may take another month or two to get to that fully devolped game. 
---
I‚Äôve just been rocking normal leather armour that is deep pocketed and has chameleon.

I keep meaning to upgrade but forget.

You wasted loads of points on rad perks and put heavy ass mods on your armor just to bitch on reddit, huh? Keep dropping Todd's name and maybe he'll take a break from starfield to laugh his ass off at your poor decisions.

This one is nice!

I've yet to get one,  have ts pump that I scored when i was in the 50's or 60's. It's pretty damn good.  I keep getting shitty legendary wood armor with a mix of a few others

Ammo supply location. North east on the map. Take it over, pick the ammo you want, and it will produce it for you.
---
lol it comes with the mirv mod already on it
---
Buy, Craft, or take over the Ammunition factory. Other than those options .308 isnt super popular at high levels so many high level players may be willing to give it away free. I just dropped over 400 rounds last night right outside vault 76 for a guy.
---
Outfit is hunters longcoat, you get it from a random encounter responder vendor bot that has a chance to appear next to Charleston station. Hat is black cowboy hat. I found the hat on the wheelchair at the bottom floor of the whitespring golf club building. Bandana is the skull bandana able to purchase from any raider vendor bot.
---
Half of the weapons in this game are in the shitter, it's pretty bad atm. Shouldn't have released so early.
---
Crafting is your most reliable, consistent source of ammunition. Ammosmith+Super Duper perk.
---
At that level, craft it.
---
Farm Flatwoods Hotel Gym and Charleston Fire Department Gym for lead.
---
Get acid and cloth off random scrap items.
---
Get steel by scrapping all the weapons and armor you find.
---
Nice story I like reading stuff like this makes me want to help out all the low levels out there.
---
Crafting it. 
---
Lead, steel and gunpowder. 
---
Honestly though, at your level,  ammo is hard to come by. 
---
Correct, it is furious. Also the queens dmg resistance with melee is huuggeeee. i can 2 shot a scorched beast, but i dont do much dmg to her. 
---
Psn Geinen
---
I wonder how op that would be. Say one of those pieces has less dmg from players as well! 
---
Because he IS one. This is the same guy who tried to shade Obsidian by blatantly lying on them. Claiming they forgot their own lore because he found a folder in a building that had the BOS signature there that shouldnt have been. Turns out wasn't in the vanilla game and was caused by one of his mods. He lied trying to discredit Obsidian and never apologized for it. He's also a homophobe who when exposed as such went back deleting all the websites that included his homophobic comments, luckily they were all screen capped.
---
I'm still enjoying the time I spent being stalked by a guy narrating my movements like he was watching wild life I turned around to see him standing there crouched behind a lamp post in a ranger outfit and he was like - ohh no I think he spotted me I shouldn't get so close to wild life as to disturb that natural behavior - pretty much burst out laughing and had a blast for the like 20mins he was doing it till he found a group of noobs to follow he called them shrieking noobious maximus or something like that 
---
No way to know unless you unfortunately buy them and try to learn them to only realize you already know them ;-;
---
I recommend just leaving the vault as quickly as possible with the name at least and a default face. You can change your appearance anytime in the menu.

I lost 2000 fusion cells to the bug

Ok to get the fertilizer building set your looking for the brahmn pen plan it can be sold at harpers ferry if I remember. It‚Äôs been awhile since Iv seen it but there‚Äôs a few places that have it I think grahm has it also in the church in Sutton has it. 
---
Making a list/spreadsheet is probably the easiest way. Unfortunately there doesn't seem to be a way to know in-game. I was dumb and bought at least five or six plans that I already knew before I started writing them down.
---
Ah, I thought you meant people who had the game and for which it's unplayable.

---
Out of curiosity, does "Stabalized" perk apply to energy damage?
---
I just scrolled for as long as it took me to smoke a cigarette. I don't smoke in the house and the neighbors are boring. My phone and Reddit are my smoke break entertainment.
---
Molotovs, flamer or Tesla Rifle. It sucks. I have a few TSEs, and when more people show up I switch to a vampire combat knife.
---
Everything is going to die, I'll still tag everything, but everyone gets loot. 
---
While it's annoying as fuck, even other TSE users get hurt by this because you'll likely not tag everything either. Idk if adding area looting will help. You'll probably have half a dozen bots just sitting by the golf course there to loot and nothing more.
---
I find that scorched and super mutants will have .308 ammo. In the meantime I suggest stocking up on lead, gunpowder and steel and you can make your own ammo at a tinkers workbench. You won‚Äôt have a problem finding .308 ammo for too much longer. It‚Äôs the 10mm ammo that I‚Äôm also out of.
---
 They need to make any place on the map like that. I'd totally nuke red rocket mega stop because the Flatwoods monster always harasses me there. Purple bastard. 
---
Same here - I had a perfect spawn point - it was right up tight against the mountain (always facing away from my camp for some reason but okay) - since it had no texture or distance to load, it actually loaded fairly quickly.  
---
First time I noticed a change was New Years eve.  Logged in and i was in the middle of my lake.   
---
Was thinking about it... isn't that when the nuke-silo change happened, and a bunch of the fissures stopped working? 
---
Have you seen the campfires? Portable ground. You can even put water purifiers on 'em.
---
In a tight spot I have to unequip all my weight perks to get the power attacks. I got the Scaley Skin mutation and it took 50 AP away. I can take a Rad-X to get rid of it temporarily though or do try to get rid of it with Rad-Away. I can fast travel with Excavator. I have about 575 carry weight but can get it higher if I need to with Party Girl and beer, Radstag, etc. It's a PITA. I'm about to dump everything but something makes me keep hold of everything instead. I want to be underwieght without weight perks or Excavator. I want  to float like a butterfly and sting like a bee with all my damage perks equipped. I need to do some serious inventory management.

Robot leader of a horde was inside mama dolce‚Äôs secret basement but it wouldn‚Äôt teleport me there :(

(And I haven‚Äôt done much question on this character...strangely addicted to the legendary grind)

It‚Äôs those damn commies and dupers

And i tend to die after the second swing with explosive. But shooting my supersledge is cool!
---
I found a gas mask last night at the top of the lighthouse, I think?
---
Someone did that at the Morgantown station. Left a mini nuke and other goodies. I'm going to start doing the same.
---
I've been using like 3 mods since the start and nothing has happen so far. 
---
Please accept a friends request from a user with Boss in the name, and then join the server and come to that CAMP. We will go over the rules, and head to yours. 
---
When I'm in the mood to offload some stuff, I generally check the map and seek out low level players on my server. There's usually always some hanging around the general vicinity of the vault and Flatwoods. 
---
Now if I can find the plans for those clean cream lockers.

2 shot lever action still works just fine in VATS btw. My handmade, shotgun and gauss are all terrible in VATS.

I love this! üòÇüò≠
---
&gt; &gt; Don‚Äôt know why so many people hate it.
---
It's the fashionable hipster thing to do
---
It's actually fun and as it gets updates and gets better there will be a lot of people hating it harder and harder because it's easier to do that than to change your mind.
---
But that's ok, they self selected themselves out as a core audience moving forward
---
any chance you could share a sheet of this so I can begin tracking data myself?
---
No, yeah, griefing people who have spent hours on building their camp is a great idea.
---
You can get to about 98% if it's multiplicative (which I hope it is), but you can get to 100% really easily if it's additive. This is exactly what I am trying to work out :)

Both are OP tbh.

Nvm, got it back by entering and exiting the chassis multiple times but some how duplicated another chassis with nothing on it.

Lol happened not 5 minutes ago again for me they are trully greedy bums in a nuke zone and well im just there to gwt leg weapons and i meet a lvl 25 and well he starts following me as i kill ghouls and well i see he heeds assistance so i hoard them to me and i start bashing them and let them get low and he pickes m off helped him rank up and a few minutes in guess who a lvl 245 spamong tse shotgun killing eveything and i just look at like like really that lvl and being a greedy bum he is just keeps going for all to kill and im a lvl 131 and i still let others get some rewards because why not? We are a cummunity we.need to help each other put  and help others who dont jaave whaat we have and help them enjoy the game if not if you wanna be greedy and hoard everything when you clearly dont need it go play another fallout where you can kill anything you like as easily and selfishly as you please
---
This thread has just saved me a lot of grief. Thanks Redditors.
---
Sweet! Okay so just server hop those guys until I find it? 
---
I lost all of my .44 and .45 rounds to this bug. I can craft more of that too but it doesn't change the fact that the game shouldn't have taken it in the first place.
---
That‚Äôs what I‚Äôve been doing, and wasting caps. Thank you for the response :(
---
I keep forgetting to abuse that. Skyfarm incoming.
---
What's crazy is you can generally see their screen names and they say what they play on. So go ahead and take down their caps selling website and tell youtube to strike down their channel. Easy as that. YouTube doesnt play around with people messing with big companies.
---
I only have 6 LCK but the weapon hasn‚Äôt procced in forever, it has different rates for various weapons and apparently it only wants to procc the first time you hit an enemy. It needs help.
---
You can get some from killing super mutants early on. The best location early for mutants is I would say Charleston or Summersville next to new gad (the dried up lake in the middle of the map)
---
I totally agree. It would really help with the congestion in the nuked areas when people are busting out their TSE to kill things before you can get a tag on it. It would also add some longevity to the current content. I think at least every zone should have one solid nuke zone. Would be great to see people send 3 nukes to different spots of the map and it actually be worth the time. 
---
It's kinda funny to me how people will use the "I don't need to acknowledge the fact that what I said was wrong, because YOU used a bad word! LA LA LA I WIN" argument. 
---
Nope there is no way to know right now unless you keep track of them yourself. It blows my mind that Bethesda hasn't added this QOL fix yet. Everyone has been asking since day 1. I'm writing them down as I go since I've spending a lot of caps on them lately and if I get a duplicate I just check my list and add it if needed.
---
it's cuz youre supposed to shoot it into the air and it rains down on enemies. you shouldnt shoot the mirv directly at an enemy 
---
I love this. It‚Äôs the best ever to claim all workshops yourself and make the rounds for pickup!
---
I wish my game had a faster reload speed after I crash for the umpteenth time.
---
Strongly disagree. Once the tutorial is out there, Bethesda is all the more aware and motivated to fix it. It's almost always a bad idea to go after freedom of expression.
---
What happen
---
Yea, it sucks. That's why I have to keep a notepad written with all plans and recipes I have in order to keep myself from buying things I already have/know. 
---
Lately it likes to spawn me in water, ever since I got a purifier.
---
Nuh don't have to, english is my 4th language, but I am glad at you attempt, keep trying buddy :)
---

---
I'll drink from a lake but that's it 
---
Turrets reflect player level and at higher levels have  the option for explosive rounds like enemy turrets (or Armour piercing)...these should be available via hooking them up to a console or something and with a high enough science perk
---
Sounds good!
---
They were in the beta, some people still have them stored away for their camps because they never scrapped them from the beta. There's been plenty of posts about them, maybe not necessarily in their own threads but they have been brought up more than a few times.
---
Yeah. This was with the armor penetration perk card. I normally use a super sledge, and, with that, I can see some of her health going down. With the combat knife, it was like I wasn't even hitting her.
---
Adults play video games. It's not 1988 anymore.
---
By the way, if anyone wants to join us we have a Brotherhood of Steel sub over here r/Fo76Brotherhood
---
I get this aggro all of the time because I use melee and grenades.  Especially during a nuke event, I'll lob grenades at every large group of baddies I see.  Occasionally it hits the robots too.  With the exception of the assaultrons, who mess me up (Only wearing a hazmat suit),  I just use them as extra experience.
---
big facts
---
I appreciated the read, thanks.
---
230 hrs in, tons of TS weapons, 3 Explosive weapons, 0 TSE. All 3 Explosive weapons were found from Uranium fever. 
---
They're the ones giving Fallout 76 a bad rep? 
---
The player base ranges from shit to great but the rep Fallout 76 has is as a bug riddled mess that crashes regularly and locks up when it feels like it.
---
It's rep is as an unfinished game produced by a AAA company that charged full price for it.
---
You can have fun in the game if you're determined enough or willing to forgive the fact that a company with plenty of money to spend on development and QA chose not to and still had the gall to charge full price for the game.
---
Which you shouldn't be, nobody should be okay with that, It's utterly ridiculous, it's similar in its own way to buying a car after being led to believe it was in goid condition only to have the engine fall out when you get home with it.
---
This game is fucked up, they are fucked up for putting it out before it was finished and quality tested, and fuck them for charging full price AND not doing their do diligence and taking the developmental time to finish the game. If the consequence of them not putting it out when they did would have been the death of Fallout 76, fine, stick to your fucking standards and don't put out a broken excuse for a game.

Perhaps you haven't been around long enough to understand that true capitalism is doing what you can get away with. 
---
Sorry if they didn't teach you that in economics, but it is reality and the reason there is a ridiculous gap between the rich and the poor. Capitalism is essentially extortion.
---
I'm not a communist by any means, but I'm not going to act like this isn't what we should expect with "free" trade.
---
I like to build there because there's always people who want to play together.  This game sucks solo and if I can have some laughs while tossing grenades with strangers while we run to the turrets so be it. 
---
I know, low level PA spawn rates need help.
---
It should of been released at the day of launch even in the trailer it shows that it WAS supposed to come with the game. But the company put it off 2months later they announced later on that player vending comning.. 
---
If Anyone is curious of the video go to youtube (Fallout 76 Multiplayer Trailer 2018) 2:38-2:42
---
And the reason I'd be saying this as I don't look at it as a bad thing but what already people figured out the Duplication glitch you can go to a website and request or even here at reddit to purchase a certain partiuclar weapon or serum at a price. 
---
I've found them in those warehouse buildings more often. Look at the name of the location and it might clue you in. Military, warehouses, that one lab place.
---
It doesn't work with bulking but it does with smelting.
---
Tried that, didn‚Äôt work. I let them kill me, didn‚Äôt reset. Literally left/rejoined game. That worked. 
---
I'm with you. In FO4, I enjoy the fights, but I don't enjoy constantly scrounging for ammo.  A few terminal commands and I am having more fun without bothering anyone else.
---
I wouldn't even care if players were cheating the system in FO76 if it didn't crash the servers.
---
Harpers fairy...
---
Move forward out of the spawn point until you find a building with a hole in the wall search that buildings display cases. all of them except for the ones with vases have the chance of having the plans there. there's also an upstairs that you can access using a car on the other side of the building.
---
That and lots of server hopping... found the torso so far.
---
You can move SPECIAL points at level 50 though?
---
How'd you get scammed? 
---
Those gives ballistics fiber, a different component.
---
By spreading the duping methods people are pushing the priority to fix said methods for Bethesda. And I believe that's a good thing. The bad thing is not punishing the dupers.
---
So in your mind it‚Äôs perfectly okay for Bethesda to sell in game currency, but not a third party?
---
I'm on PC but luckily I have a pre built video tour of my (old) CAMP ready for inspection  
---
[https://youtu.be/WyVPMz8pzew](https://youtu.be/WyVPMz8pzew)
---
Both can be fun, if the good outweighs the bad!
---
I don't feel like leveling up but I spend a ton of points in weight lowering perks, and I want to branch out to use some other weapons also so I guess I have to, then level up some more to move some points around.

An interesting note. One of the actors plays himself. The dude is so interesting/weird that they said he wouldn't be believable otherwise. Google Rudy Reyes 
---
I respect that. I have a TSE handmade myself-- its too versatile to get rid of. The 50cal fills a different niche, having the same range with over twice the fire rate and 250 ammo capacity. But the damage for me (no perks on either rifles or heavy guns) is at a base of 153 for the mg and 203 for the hm. I'd heard that damage was lackluster for auto weapons, and seeing a .556 outclass a .50cal of the same legendary variant enforces this. Still good for what it does, just really heavy and eats ammo.
---
I find those very often @ the flatwoods vendor. 
---
JUST USE MELEE AND YOU NEVER HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT AMMO

I got VERY lucky with a 3 star drop - my legendary lever rifle has -

You exclusively post in English, so I doubt that.

And second, kind of sad that you think you shouldn't improve on your ~~fourth~~ first language.  
---
Even if you're not lying (lol) you shouldn't try to condescend to someone in a language you can't speak about understanding that language.
---
Yes, but when you open a perk card pack and go 'oh....look...more duplicates' it's frustrating and takes alot of the excitement and anticipation out of opening the packs because 'and there go half my cards into the ether' when you get dupes of cards that don't have multiple ranks

I love building and defending settlements and engage with workshops extensively.  But I feel your pain.  My plan is always to defend until I crash or DC.  With the exception of shops I took just to defend once and bail, I‚Äôve never made it to the point that I leave on my own.  100% crash or DC.  I wish they would auto snapshot like a camp, much of the fun is designing and iterating on camp layouts.
---
I haven‚Äôt trusted blueprints after bad experiences in beta and right after launch, do they work well for workshops these days?  Does it store blueprints specifically in that workshop‚Äôs BP menu or does it add it to everywhere you might see blueprints? 
---
Are you on PC? If so, I have a TON of .308 you can have - add me if you are PC - simmo0916
---
Not sure, my usual buddy has been away on holiday for a couple weeks, will find out for sure sometime next week.
---
Better or worse than a Snot Ear + Swamp Itch combo?
---
Having not played and experienced what op is talking about first hand, your response would be similar to mine. 
---
However, seeing as how I have experienced this, your comment makes no sense. Robots will literally walk into your line of fire, they‚Äôll walk into a damn swing from a melee. 
---
Morgantown High School has a number of them.
---
Except they don't. Fallout 4 is still considered bad. As will Fallout 76. Where is this proof that everyone plays it and considers it good? Because i'm on Twitch all the time, and literally none of the top streams like Fallout 4. It died faster than on stream than all other RPG's that followed.  All call it the trash Fallout. Likewise 76 is already on life support on twitch. I glanced at the numbers around 8 pm the other day it had lower numbers than the original Mass Effect which came out in 2007 heh
---
Agreed. Beth is selling currency. Why can‚Äôt players?
---
It works exactly like this. It‚Äôs broken as hell. I love it so hard.
---
the last 2 I found were people on their 3rd/4th character and didn't want/need my stuff. 
---
I hope in the future they'll make it so plans you know are "grayed out" in vendor lists / bags / inventory.  You can still pick them up or buy them (for friends) but you'll at least know you don't need it.
---
You're laughing at for expecting perks and armor to actually work? Oof, the white knighting of this game is getting out of control.
---
Literally happened to me yesterday. Two guys, higher level than me (I'm 74), come in, annihilate everything before my melee ass can jump over to hit it. I got to tag just one of the legendaries.
---
I'm very into this idea
---
Holy cow, thanks for the heads up. I have all of the BoS plans for the combat armor, so that‚Äôs why I‚Äôm so focused on that 
---
Yes? Not sure what your point is. So do kids. And ratings are meaningless as a method to determine *who* is playing your game.
---
Sorry I haven't been around long enough to learn a definition for something that you completely fucking made up.
---
‚ÄúActively making the game less enjoyable‚Äù
---
Play somewhere else? Saying this is the equivalent to being mad because some dude has a red dump truck in your sandbox and it‚Äôs breaking your immersion 
---
not very server hoppable though. they always seem to be gone.
---
48yo gamer housewife, huh? Pics or it didn‚Äôt happen
---
Doesn't one of the High schools have them them? In the science class..
---
yeah i've seen multiple youtubers advertising this at the beginning of their videos. there's multiple sites too
---
Kain666420
---
So the canvas bags will be ready right around when 76 is ready for launch 
---
I always remind everyone when we party in Whitesprings to remove there level 5 Demo Expert perk so everyone can attack things. Surprisingly, people are more welcome to that idea than swapping away from their TSE
---
They should drop something decent I agree.  Even if it‚Äôs something as simple as some super stimpaks.
---
Not useful for everybody and not a legendary but better than what you got.
---
As for the ammo...maybe a different weapon is more suitable for a single enemy.  
---
People complain about heavy weapons but to me they are designed to wreck mobs, not annilihate one high level enemy.  But given how much ammo you used I‚Äôd look at perk loadout and whether your weapon is up to task.
---
Other thing that sucks is you can‚Äôt craft your ammo like most other people can 
---
So you want to displace your feelings on them. Awesome defensive mechanism. How about you just play the game and leave them the fuck alone.
---
It‚Äôs not even a competitive game.
---
They print off every comment to burn it and keep Todd's bunker warm.
---
I wouldn't worry about it too much.
---
In the end you'll have more levels than you could possibly use.
---
I think I'm level 150 or so on this 2nd character and I probably have 20 banked levels I haven't even done anything with yet...lol
---
They do, but they will also break walls.
---
It would be awesome I mean I don't like to compare this game to Fortnite but they do have a forge map feature where you can create or add new models,trees, etc......
---
That's good to know about Radshield not working I was gonna try that. I think Radshield is a single player replacement for Rad Spongue.
---
Funny that I‚Äôve been grinding the fuck out of whitesprings and have never had this problem either with guns or melee. ü§î it‚Äôs called not button mashing 
---
No. You've never been able to in the full game.
---
Always welcom! My door is always open. (wait does it even have a door? Can't remember right now)
---
I would like to know what you think of the place. I put in a lot of time and effort. And even some blood when the neigbours keept storming in. 
---
But I finally found a place with a Nice location, Nice vieuw  and would love to have your opinion of the place.
---
PS4, look for Jefke_008
---
Yes, but having each 'rank level' of a given perk card listed as something else just to 'pad out' the 'player choice' bit instead of adding in new/interesting things, especially when capacities for things are so limited is frustrating.
---
I mean, there is a reason in games like wow and the like you can sell off shit you don't need at an AH or to a vendor to liquidate the assets to make room for other assets.  And those games don't require the kind of 'hording' that this game does, what with most weapons being made out of tissue paper, and each boby pin weighing a tenth of a wg
---
So there are lower level hazmat suits? I've been trying to catch up with my brother, just started last weekend, and have only found level 30+ suits. I assumed that was the minimum because those were the very first ones I encountered. Maybe I should go back to that location solo and see if a level appropriate one shows up, I'm 20 now. 
---
The stairs are already attached to a floor. I cannot remove the floor either.
---
I'm low level (26) but I've been using this laser sniper rifle recently that I modded to deal burn damage and its honestly one of my favorite guns. Sure it doesn't do much damage but it's fun as fuck to play with
---
OMG this. Without crashing the server. I've only ever seen two active nuke zones in the obvious locations. The dyer chem location for the mire and the crashed ship for... the northern zone I can never remember the name of. 
---
Capitalism? That‚Äôs not even my idea or definition. It‚Äôs literally extortion. It‚Äôs pay to play.
---
I haven't experienced that. They do do a poor job of button debouncing, but it's still pretty rare that I get an unintended double-tap.
---
If you're on PC using an xbone controller, check and see if you have essentially two copies of the same controller. I think the software installs both the modern controller's driver and one that emulates a legacy 360 controller. Some games will read both and thus respond twice. Come to think of it, I think I was having this problem with navigating menus in Fallout 4 before I disabled one of the two.
---
Do you grind Nuked Whitesprings or something else to level?
---
Yes, they can destroy everything in your camp. That's not saying you have to build them behind walls, but it would be a good idea to put some kind of active defense* up so anything that attacks will die before breaking your stuff.
---
I don't seem to have real problems if I warp away from my camp and then come back later, but if other players are in the vicinity of my camp, then stuff spawns and attacks and the other players are under no compulsion to assist. So protect yourself.
---
* As in guns, not just walls
---
I was stupid and made a new character. While trying to level her up fast I got accused of hacking, dupping, all that stuff and was witch hunted. I got harassed while in passive mode by good old BostonGeorge and his crew of jerks! They spent a lot of time posing for pictures next to my corpses. This went on for over an hour. These are grown men! I will never let any young people I know play this game even with supervision. BostonGeorge is a freaking kook and creep! I have been at Nuke events and heard him hassling a kid playing late saying things like "your balls haven't dropped yet bitch" and "suck it kid". The guy is seriously disturbed! I am not playing today, time to hang out with my car a bit and walk my dogs...

If you got scammed on a trade, go to FO76 Market and setup trades there.  You'll be able to see how much positive karma people have, so you'll know how many successful trades they've had.  Plus if you get scammed you can report them and possibly get them banned from that reddit.
---
Normal in-game trades with randoms, kinda too bad you got scammed.  Bethesda isn't going to do anything about it.

When you go to your camp module to repair your base it doesn't say it will scrap mods but it does.

I have 3 in the open with a single turret above them. It won't really stop anything but it will help deter.

You can meet a friendly wise mothman at the end of the landview light house event. If you click him after the event you get an hour long 5% xp buff.

Funny, I was thinking the exact same thing last night but I would like to add: Melee is as powerful w/o legendary weapons.  By the time my melee character was level 15 or so, I walked through everything.  I was on last night (levl 60ish w/no legendary weapons) with my melee toon and ran into the queen fight (not grouped) and tanked the gal while everyone shot at her then turned around and downed the Murlock queen without ever thinking I would or could die.  
---
This is the same issue that Morrowind, Oblivion, Skyrim and all of the FO series games have - they are too easy.  For FO4 and Skyrim, I play with all of the most difficult mods and they are still too easy.
---
I rerolled a couple weeks ago and have a level 50ish pistol vats crit build with all the agil and luck perks and it's a lot of fun - no legendary weapons.  However, without a legendary weapon It takes a lot to kill one glowing ghoul in a blast zone...  The bad part is:  With ZERO WEAPON SKILLS, I pick up a nail board and can solo nuke zones without any problem.
---
I am just playing now with no PA and Legendary weapons / armor...seems to at least be a little more interesting.
---
Very nice. Still no luck for mine.
---
Where did you find that axe?  Looks awesome.  Sorry I have nothing to contribute to your post.
---
I am on PC, I will add you when I get the chance.
---
I noticed it doesn't work so well in pve vs melee mobs. They push you around a lot and you take full dmg.
---
Thanks everyone. I guess my memory isn't what it used to be.
---
I've been dropping them for others I come across. I don't mind sharing the wealth :)
---
Lol. Thanks. I'll have to look for a hermit crab near there.
---
Cheers :)
---
We could at least travel right to where our C.A.M.P. is placed or something.
---
I put them up because in my area, mobs spawn nearby with ranged weapons, so they'll take potshots that I barely notice half the time that eventually destroy my stuff. You can get a pretty good idea of where they'll all spawn and usually put one wall up to block their line of sight if you run into that. Otherwise I usually don't bother if I'm in a place where it's clear.
---
Don't bother with the clothes one unless you paid 600 atoms for pyjamas, I have yet to see any confirm you can do this without paying. That right there is pay to win which this game was not supposed to be.
---
Or 'Pimp my Powerarmor'?
---
I think getting that schematic was an optional objective? It was inside one of the containers, but not the one that had the other items. 
---
You don't actually need any of the code pieces as long as you have the code
---
I use it sometimes but I never actually verified.  I need to check that and some other things this evening while I am farming for mats/cores.  After doing Scorched Earth late last night I have a couple of broken plasma and laser gatlings I need to repair and restock ammo to be ready for the next nuke zone.
---
Turrets up high and blackberries as decoy fodder. You're welcome. 
---
So far Iv only managed to get ahold of two pieces of assassins/sentinel gear with the rest just assassins. With blocker, dodgy, serendipity alone I can survive hits from friends of mine that swing a powerfist for just under 5k a pop. Multiple times. 
---
Throw in some padded with lone wanderer and suppressor. You got yourself the ability to laugh at all the tse weapons in pvp. 
---
Takes some work to get everything put together but it‚Äôs insanely awesome how well this works.
---
I think in nuke zones anyone should be able to loot everything.  
---
Also maybe if you are within 30 metres of the person who made a kill anywhere you should also be able to loot that kill team or no team as you were "present" at the fight either way
---
Yes, my friend left the team a could still open it when we tested the keypad switch.
---
 make him leader
---
I too have experienced this yet I am still confused by this post. Of course they are going to end up in the line of fire if you are not careful and attacking the same thing as them (mainly the melee ones) I don't see the problem.
---
 I want to be a whitesprings butler 
---
Not surprising since the path he walks is so huge
---
I would LOVE that. I'd go material farming to mod them to the best I can and actually server hop to pass out legendary items to newbies that can actually use them when handed out. If I had as many items as last night that would occupy me for a week or more.
---
Lots of legendary power armor in FO4... (two in Nuka World)

---
And you 13 year olds keep viewing their videos. You all are the main cause of the very problem you complain about and you dont even know it. 
---
Must just be a lucky bug for me then. I often accidentally hit the robots at the front entrance and enter exit the building to reset them. Has never not worked. 
---
That would be cool like you get a higher intelligence and have a permanent hacking perk. But you have less carry weight, and can only use robot weapons.
---
I love that sword. I think it's one of the strongest one-handed in the game.
---
I got it at level 15 though so I'll have to switch to the Blade of Bastet soon. The latter I think can be recrafted to higher levels (consuming the original).
---
I'm level 84 and I still haven't seen a drop.
---
The company that made it said it was plastic but they origanally made a glass prototype but it didn't look right
---
I believe we should be able to scrap them, with guaranteed learning of a new related plan, or...
---
1. Let us remove the Legendary effects, and move them to another similar weapon
---
2. Let us store them at 0 weight under a separate tab in our Stash
---
3. Let us Display them on Secure Display racks
---
I would also like to see  "For Sale" Weapon &amp; Armor Racks, that we could place Items on and set a price for them, then anyone visiting our camp could purchase the item for the set price.

But mostly I would like to see Bethesda fix their Server Stability issues first.

I have a two shot crossbow (level 45) you can have OP.  Give me your gamer tag (PS4 yeah?) and I‚Äôll just give it to you...I finally got the lever rifle plans last Night and at using my anti armour lever rifle now.

I‚Äôd give you my gamer tag but I can‚Äôt remember the exact spelling right now (stupid underscores) and I‚Äôm at work right now.

Yup, just look at how one typo gymped the AI for the Aliens in a certain shitty game (they are still bad when the typo is fixe, sure, but they are a ton better than when it's not fixed)
---
Coding is very, very tedious, no joke, you forget one - when doing a 'call tag' and that call tag can't pull what it needs, forget a " or ' or } and everything from the point of the 'opening designator (the first " or ' or the { ) is broken and will not work.
---
Dec. 19th had a patch as already discussed.
---
You‚Äôve repeatedly demonstrated the inability to understand that small fixes can lead to big changes for certain players, have ignored or downplayed anything that contradicts your preconceived notions of how much post launch support the game has been given by the devs and conviently ignore facts you‚Äôve already been told.

---
This isn't true. At all. Pacifist mode doesn't prevent people from attacking you. It just prevents you from accidentally attacking them, so they are limited to "slap" damage (unless you are in a workshop). Thing is, there are plenty of weapons that can kill you in just a few hits, slap damage or not.
---
Atoms have no effect on any in-game economy.

EXPLOSION!

When I get another Violet Flux, I plan to just store mine and place it as needed.
---
For some unspecified reason OP wishes to not rank up, which is unavoidable, but whatever. 
---
Gave 5 of my best legendary armor pieces to a buddy to mod it for me. He did and when he gave it back the server kicked us both. So I feel your pain. Hopefully someone found that sweet set of armor lol.
---
The events are really good for armor pieces I've learned, look for people doing them and join.
---
I'm laughing at someone for expecting the meta to change for them and a small portion of the playerbase. 
---
It won't. 
---
He wants to get the damage resist and rad resist of power armor AND the legendary affixes of normal armor. It's a great fantasy, tbh. I have a stealthsniper that'd really enjoy it. But it ain't going to happen. 
---
And don't go assuming too much, dweeb, I haven't played since duping became a thing.
---
"Scammed" btw.  At worst you let yourself get griefed for an hour.
---
That would be dope. But you can only leave the prime fissure site if somebody nukes it. Or it would be cool if it did an evolve type thing where on player in the server gets randomly selected to be the queen for the event. Like a asymmetrical multiplayer event.
---
There is no meaningful in game economy. Other peoples‚Äô caps have no realistic effect on your gameplay and can be ignored wholesale. 
---
bloodied swing speed +1 str deathclaw gauntlet, a one shot queen killing machine...
---
Screw explosives, work on weapon smithing. Being able to craft any and all weapons is a big plus.
---
Damn.
---
My first experience was a level 9 camping with Power Armor right by Vault 76. 
---
I wish there were some good folks on PC
---
If only there was some mechanic that allowed a team of players to at least get the loot dropped by monsters that others in the same team kill.
---
Sooo does that mean you're role-playing as a troll?
---
I can sell you adhesives , I have bulked and unbulked in abundance.
---
how much do you think you would be in need of ? 
---
What platform do you play on? 
---
I‚Äôm not sure what duping is but at this point I‚Äôm too afraid to ask...
---
Weird Flex but ok :)
---
What I'm working on is to see just how tanky a bloodied/adrenal build can be. I reckon it's possible to be basically immortal with the highest damage in the game...with the right gear, ofc, and until they fix the issue with normal armor not being able to reach rad-res levels it's a purely non-nuke build.
---
What platform do you play on?
---
I think the third star of star of each rifleman perk (fuck it, any weapon perk), should reduce weapon weight and increase damage.
---
Make it more useful for people to pursue them
---
Dislike the FUCK out of the video and let him know this shit ain't cool of him in the comments.
---
Fucking asshole, i was subbed to you for years bro, lost all respect as a gamer for you.
---
Yea tested it today, you get a status pop up for getting enough rads, and it changes your look in the pip boy status to ghoulish, but your outwards appearance does not change, hopefully they change this. :(
---
Talk about a weird loophole... eh, as long as there be whales, there be someone exploiting em.
---
With level 3 hard bargain and grape mentats it was 8800 caps for me
---
Yeah I've fired it once without killing myself. Thinking about getting the perks to reduce weapon and mini nuke weight, then getting marsupial back. You can easily get up on buildings and stuff and fire it. Still very situational and basically just for fun. It would be cool of you had a chance of spawning a legendary enemy after launching a mini nuke. 
---
Wait it out while eating everything in site and violently pooping or chow down on a disease cure.

Kylo Ren is a baby with anger issues tho.
---
I feel your pain, my main character knows how to make every food item in the game (that I'm aware of that is) and I can't tell you the number of times I multi bought an item....
---
On that thread: any one know where to get fuggin royal jelly, I find 'jars' of it at times but they are listed as a junk item not a food item...please tell me it's not another thing like the Hardened Mass are
---
‚ÄúWithout having to be greedy shits‚Äù

Charge a subscription fee. Don‚Äôt pretend your Santa Claus outfit is worth $30. Also don‚Äôt pretend other people‚Äôs exploits have anything to do with you. Literally go play somewhere else.
---
This one.    
---
I have 3 characters and I've found one every time I've gone up there. The Scorched are low level so it's worth a trip. When someone nukes Whitesprings you can put on that suit, pop some RadX. Climb on the wall and shoot things with a hunting rifle to tag them, get XP, and items.
---
I've actually had the Responder vendor spawn between Fire Station and Riverside Manor... I was jogging down road towards Fire Station (close the the section with houses on both sides of road) and he popped behind me... and his pack animal and its' escorts a little in front of me. Unfortunately, all he had was the two clocks (Cuckoo and Nuka) still bought them tho'
---
Yuup...It's something I've noticed a lot from people who are in the wrong. Racists? "You're proving my discrimination against you is acceptable, because you are VULGAR". etc. 
---
This post is amazing. I just want to put my vote in for favorite items being protected. I‚Äôd even suggest taking it a step further, let us ‚Äúflag‚Äù our main items without them being on the favorites menu. A flagged item would be unable to be scrapped, sold, dropped or even show up on a vendor list (less clutter while selling). The flag should stay on the item even if its put into the stash. We should however still be able to repair or mod flagged weapons and armor.
---
Youtubers also incite cyber riots against companies because they didn't get exactly what they wanted. 
---
1. Bethesda had no insight in this it was made by a different company and the money is going to them. 2. They said themselves it was plastic and they showed it being made. The only reason they didn't make it glass was they couldn't make the bottle quite right.
---
I have seen the same issue as others and wholeheartedly support bringing welcome mats back. What I am learning with my own C.A.M.P. is that is seems that teammates appear to fast travel to the very spot I was standing when I originally placed my camp at this location. Unfortunately, this is at the small outcropping of a cliff. I have had to go so far as to add a door at this outcropping to allow teammates to enter the camp - they would be stuck without it. I on the other hand, fast travel next to my camp - if it hasn't spawned yet, I quickly move as it seems like I am spawning under where a wall would be. In any case, being able to specify where one enters the camp when fast traveling would be stellar.
---
I was level 50 when i got it. Friend was doing a full melee build so gave me all his guns.
---
Intelligence goes well with Power Armor. I have a relatively high intelligence build, but I;m actually thinking about removing some points from it.
---
Radios have been removed since beta, I don't believe they've ever said why.
---
Dude, we are t earth displacement and relocation engineers.  That is a highly technical job.
---
Let‚Äôs just stick to our simple jobs like building laser turrets and fusion generators and let the egg heads look after that.
---
$30 santa clause bundle outfit that has no effect on actual gameplay, and isn't required to play the game, or that locks content.
---
Let's tour! I've been tweaking mine and think I've found a good balance. 
---
It would have been nice to have this as an unlock when you finish the main quest.
---
Why am I not on that list?!
---
I thought we had something! :0
---
Take the advice of one well known Ghoul Mayer and use Mentats as your Ride of choice.
---
The gauss rifle has some power, besides that energy weapons are pretty sad. I've heard that the gattling laser is fun, but breaks too quickly. 
---
Do you not crash when using the Tesla rifle? 
---
Like directly under it? If so how?
---
Taking items out of the game to sell them separately and subsequently banning people for cosmetic mods after claiming this was allowed affects the gameplay. 
---
I try dropping things for noobs, but they run away. I guess I'm bad a communicating. Last night some mid-lvl was blowing up cars in Flatwoods, thought he would enjoy some Nuka grenades I can make. Dropped one and he picked it up, then what I can assume was his teammate immediately gets into his PA. I just dropped another one an walked back to my camp. I try.
---
My experiences with the community playing the game have been mostly positive.  Most players I encounter either ignore me or give me a quick wave and go on their way.  I'm fine with that.  Occasionally someone will pop in to lend a hand when I'm fighting a mob of something or a scorchbeast.
---
I help out lower level players sometimes when I see them struggling.  I made a friend with a Level 2 kid last week.  Now he's Level 25-ish, thanks in part to me escorting him around the map and helping him not die so much.  I introduced him to his first nuke zone last night.
---
Don't understand why nobody likes energy weapons. The Tesla rifle is the best gun in the game for farming whitespring ghouls and pretty much every other enemy type.
---
This would be a cool endgame then have a quest to find a cure or something.
---
Eh, I'm kinda liking my trapper armor (wish it protected more as it's a 'heavier' armor, and combat armor is light but is better than all other armors) if only because of the balanced protection it gives.  With it an a rax x I only take 14r/s in nuke zones 
---
I was so happy when i discovered the plan. Then i went to build it and saw the materials needed.. 'well, that'll never happen.' 
---
...is...is that a hint or...
---
I want to be Mothman.  As for in game though, being a ghoul would be fun. 
---
You're asking for something simple but can't see past your own bullshit to realize you'd be turning the meta upside down. Doesn't matter if you and 20 other idiots that specced endurance want it, it ain't gonna happen. 
---
Keep begging todd though, it's literally the most cliche, pathetic thing to do on this sub. The only thing that would one-up it is if you put "Dear Bethesda," in the title, lmao. 
---
You should try an adhesive farm. You'll never run out again.
---
No i meant people filimg false reports
---
Im not seeing anything when I click on the link
---
I've always felt that with energy weapons too. They're just so damn boring.
---
Has revenging been fixed? I recently had a guy aggro me and revenge me trying to kill me 3 times in a row until I chose to just change servers
---
Til you knick a robot with one and you‚Äôre fucked.
---
I don't think basing your build off of stat focus isn't the strongest idea, would be better to pick the gameplay style you want, what perksnyou need for that, and then allocate special as needed.
---
That said, if you want to play a character with 15 int going heavy weapon explosives will be your best use of points for damage.
---
I'd like you to judge my little home! I'll be on tonight. Roughly  4 hours from now!
---
It's not much, but it's practical and it's mine! 
---

---
I'd love to see someone nuke the area around Thunder Mtn power plant. Give that a shot and report back. 
---
the 'banning for mods' was debunked actually, as most of the users banned had either Cheat Engine running, or were using a program called Reshade, both of which are checked for and auto bannable in most online games due to either injecting code to the servers, or by allowing people to change some textures to grant a tangible advantage (ie wall hacks, or glowing caps stashes, or the lock pick bar 'mod' which is really just a cheat)
---
Yea, his inventory is randomized so you have to be lucky 
---
I image any new players would disagree lol.
---
Nice write up. I too love the lore of the series, it all makes sense to me.
---
Cranberry Bog allll the way haha. Although sometimes I like glamping in The Mire. At night time with all the critter noises is sometimes a little spooky!
---
I actually managed to get most of them done. I wish they would stop including level up every day.
---
I‚Äôm not interested in supporting a game I already paid full price for; they‚Äôre obligated to support it themselves. It‚Äôd be different if the costumes were labeled as donations, but they aren‚Äôt. They‚Äôre deliberately stripped content from the game to sell back to us. Since the actual gameplay is broken, the building was the only mechanic I enjoy- $2 cactus DLC.
---
I've had them reset after fast travel, but I've also had them not reset until switching servers. Who knows?
---
I'm 90% certain that all the the handmades stem from like, 2 or 3 original drops. If I ever get one, it's going straight in the garbage. I don't need any of that baby shit.
---
I won't be back on for a few weeks, but mostly animal hunts n such. Just a cool idea to help put together a group of people with specialties. I'm personally starting an assassins guild
---
I didn‚Äôt even get the first two achievements on PS4 
---
Yeah mate.
---
It killed get take some coordinating as I‚Äôm in Australia but then again it‚Äôs the weekend almost so that should help.
---
I‚Äôll add you tonight 
---
Only of you get to be as ripped as the mothman statue.
---
I am one of those high level assholes, and I'm sorry. Both of my weapons are TSE and 1 hit everything. I try to sit back and let everyone get hits before I fire a cluster of shotgun pullets into the room and kills everything at once.
---
I won‚Äôt claim to have looked very far into the whole mod debacle, but I don‚Äôt understand why anyone would be mad at players modding when it doesn‚Äôt affect their game whatsoever.
---
Damn, I was gonna offer my help and try to see if I could build your way out of it. See if you could invite someone to your team and have them build. Teammates can build at your CAMP and it might 'jump-start' something.
---
If someone only has a 10 cap bounty, I assume they likely don't even know why or even that they are wanted.
---
I also use melee. Usually I dump the mags from a few different guns, finish them off with my blade, and then reload  for the next round.  
---
The whole metagame min-maxer idea that we should be narrowly focused on some sort of class archetype is simply wrong.
---
Ooo, that sounds fun. Yea I'll be down for that whenever you get on again.
---
100 
---
That would be fun
---
More than this I'd like fingers/valves to move when playing the tuba and more wood winds, I mean, Appalachia is known for the Blues right?  Where's my saxamophones?
---
Of course, I can barely mod the damn thing. No scope yet, no suppressor, I think I have a True Stock and a calibrated receiver. ;)
---
OK sounds good. 
---
Yeah but i mean they could introduce it with a quest where you create an active strain of the fev that you are able to use on yourself
---
It heals radioactive enemies like Ghouls, and Ghouls are quite common.
---
I‚Äôve played this game 250+ hours, I‚Äôm level 183, and I can say that the duping and selling bottle caps for real $ for which people are more than willing to pay (more than likely because the game makes it impossible to grind coherently) pale in comparison to the actual issues in the game. 
---
Not enough people playing with your own particular set of rules? This is a video game, grow up!
---
I use one quite a bit. I have the plans for it.
---
Good idea :) Thanks!
---
Only reason would be demolition, batteries, and gunsmith maxed for 13 points. If that fits with the rest of the build then fine. Otherwise, there is little benefit.  With 5 points you can craft any weapon by swapping cards, and the condition buff for crafting is not very useful.  Weapon artisan gives you all you need.  
---
Oh thank never thought about that
---
I think I have a cool camps
---
shitty kids with shitty parents are anyway
---
Quality reference 
---
 Not true. I've sold that ivory grip one a few times, but stopped picking it up. I believe there was a couple others you could sell. The rest you can't. If my buddy already has it I drop them into Phoenix's register. 
---
That would be cool like Virgil from Fallout 4.
---
I think armor pen is glitched if you go over 100% or something. My blade of bastet says it only does ~10 less damage than the modded black diamond. I figured with the armor pen on Blade of Bastet it would do more damage but it seemed to be MUCH worse in my bit of testing. I never tried taking off Incisor (3) so I can't be sure. I just went back to hacking things up with black diamond rather than test further.
---
I'm level 290 for a reason, think outside the box..
---
I used a swing per 0.46 second weapon (roughly) so getting hits in isn't hard..
---
Plus pain train..
---
Plus mutations for AoE damage
---
Plus Tesla Coils AoE damage..
---
Short of long I never, ever, fail to tag, unless there are 2 people with fast TSE's

Unless hes a robot that that play this game 24/7 since beta

I would gladly sacrifice the necessary weight for this!

The radios too, please.
---
I haven't played much 76 (just got it a few days ago) but from what I remember of the RR, doesn't it just end up healing mutants because of the radiation?

Keypad doors plan can be found on Graham, although it's only a chance he'll have it. If you have a friend or something and find him, you can have a friend hold him in place and relog until he has it. Or so I've heard. I'm still looking for it myself.
---
Yeah I had a crap load of .45 so I started using it on non-ghoul enemies.
---
There are.  I'm on PC and have experienced no griefing at all, only help.  Now I'm lvl 105 I try and pass this on to low level players, dropping them weapons/armour/meds etc.
---
There are loads of good folks on PC
---
Don't. 
---
Intel is all crafting, i.e. perks you swap out as needed. Highest intel you *really* need is 8. 5 for weapon type perk and 3 for medic perk. 
---
Can't even think of what else you can do. The power armor degrades slower perk? Eh. PA is pretty resilient on its own. If you have the cheaper to repair perk it balances out and you only need to repair once a day. 
---
Did you keep pressing attack or hold down the button?
---
The issue is when you keep holding the attack and do a continuous attack.
---
Just tested the BuzzBlade this morning to make sure there wasn't a stealth fix

Yeah that was one fissure I was eyeing. The terrain is pretty rough and hilly though.
---
Ghouls it heals mutants just have a resistance to it.
---
So you're the SPECIAL here, huh? Lol dude bro nice one
---
I have a good one i'm squirreling away for when an update makes them magically awesome.  To be honest, i haven't even tried it to see if it's already awesome.  How crazy is that?  I'm just waiting for someone on reddit to say how awesome they are before I try it myself.
---
I think this is how the whole FOTM thing works... 
---
Nope, from my very first comment I said it's been close to a month with no changes. There was a small hotfix on December 19th that maybe fixed a single small bug, knowing Bethesda they probably made it worse. They even called it a hot fix themselves yet you keep calling it a patch to further some agenda that you know what you are talking about or make this company look better who knows.  December 11th was the last patch and we didn't get one this week, if we get one next week it will have been 1 month between patches and it doesn't even look like that is going to happen. So at the end of the day my original comment is correct and you can't math/look at calendar/are an idiot. 
---
Something to remember, upvotes don't mean you are right.
---
Seriously!
---
Sonic Fist would be siiiiiick
---
It's just a suggestion. Damn, some of you all are miserable.
---
I'm a small time Youtuber, 5 years running, that really likes this game.  This game does have it's problems, but it is very fun.... at least for me.  I didn't watch the video, but I'm not a fan of bashing games, cheating, or selling in-game currency for real money (which is most likely against the EULA). It sucks the fun out of the game.  It's all about having fun.
---
KK but why even lock your shit? no one can steal anything...
---
1. The meta is PA because of this specific issue. It's a small portion using Regular Armor because of THIS issue.
---
2. The legendary affixes of normal armor aren't much use considering they can't be used in end game. So it's kind of a non starter.
---
3. Balance isn't final. Pistols are trash. Energy weapons are trash. Explosive is overpowered. The issue the TC brought up belongs in that list. Not being able to use the hardest to farm gear in the entire game in the ultimate content is absolute bonkers.
---
Hope you got all of that, "Dweeb".  For someone who stopped playing, you sure do care about keeping this game poorly balanced (which it is).
---
Use the heart-emote. If that doesn‚Äôt work, then neither will ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry‚Äù or ‚ÄúIt was an accident.‚Äù
---
Or the shotgun fist weapon from the original games
---
Yeah, I do mostly agree that they need to add more places to nuke that are actually worth it. For me it's getting old that the same two places are constantly nuked because those are the only places that give anything good.
---
 Before I bought the game, I was under the impression that anywhere you nuked would spawn a bunch of high levels and a couple of  legendaries; I really wish it was this way. Imagine nuking any fissure site and the scorch beast queen would spawn, plus deathclaws, maybe even some sloths. This would make the whole nuking concept much more interesting and fun to play. 
---
On top of that, they need to make some areas harder w/ more  legendaries. I don't even think it's possible to obtain a five star legendary. Maybe that's going to be in some DLC. Although, I question what they DLC's will be like. I read somewhere saying that they don't plan on adding any new areas (map area) anytime soon. Really curious to see what they end up doing. 
---
Well next time you have a friend on ask them what they see.
---
I saw myself wanted as 10 caps, my friend saw me as 5.
---
Bugged.
---
I found a steel guitar a few weeks ago, I forgot I had it in my inventory and crushed it with the rest of my junk. üò¢
---
At lower levels it‚Äôs a bit of a struggle.
---
At higher levels you have ammo Smith and super duper and it‚Äôs easy to craft ample amounts.
---
Crafting is still your best bet, hit up the hotel lodge in flatwoods and Charleston fire department for the weights from the gyms every day you play as that will give you lead.  Scrap all the enemy weapons you can to get steel and always pick up gun powder.
---
The best place to farm those two I find at lower levels is summersville as it is populated by super mutants (who drop .308 ammo...they used to drop a LOT more and it was so much easier, so it‚Äôs a double whammy of ammo and resources) and has a crafting bench or two to scrap stuff at once your over encumbered.
---
I seriously considered abandoning my current character at lower levels because it was a constant battle and grind to have ammo for my hunting rifle.
---
I went to drop off some plans and ammo at the Morgantown train statation before I logged off yesterday and someone had lined up six power armor chassis for people to grab. 
---
I am on PC :)

Enter and exit the trade menu a few times until it display the caps.
---
What do you play on? I'm farming for the mod right now. If I get 2 I'll give you one if your on ps4.
---
More likely they are A/B testing to tune pricing to find "Maximum Value."  That just made me puke a bit, but it's common practice to find your market sweet spot.
---
While the community thinks, and I agree, like 100 atoms is great for 80% of things the MBA sociopaths need to prove their worth by finding the "best" price for the company.
---
I had an acoustic once, but it wasn‚Äôt playable, just junk for wood scraps
---
That is a strong use case, I'll give you that.
---
Have you considered not using your TSEs?
---
pro tip: be a wanted player and dont maintain a base to destroy
---
Found a lvl 45 Radium with quad ammo, 25% faster fire rate, and +1 agil. I was furious. 
---
Agree
---
Welp. I wish I knew that before I trashed mine
---
Nah you just need to stop being selfish. 
---
DPS check. just kill it before it flies away. having a weapon that staggers gives you some extra seconds.
---
Doesn't anyone remember the noclip documentary about the mothman evolving? or having other forms? I've only seen one form.
---
As someone that stays with a bounty 24/7 I confirm this. I stay with at least a 10 cap bounty to make the game a little more exciting and unpredictable. Any time my bounty is over 100 caps I find a low level player and let him cash in
---
A few times I've circumvented the base thing by chilling in someone else's base while bountied which can have some fun outcomes
---
Doesn't matter what server you hop to, the vendors restock is based on your character, not the server. You just have to wait however long it is for them to restock their caps.
---
I‚Äôm comin!
---
I'm down to help as well if you're down
---
It is in a sense, I plan to share when I get home. =)
---
I didnt see an explosive weapon drop until 204. Meanwhile Ive seen lvl 30s running around with them.
---
0.5 - The ability to join the server you were just d/c'd from - nothing like running a nuke silo just to get booted from the server 15 seconds after stepping into the nuke zone... seems like it would be so easy to at least automatically try to attempt to have you join the same server if you were disconnected unnaturally.
---
I don't know if I trust HOA's, they tried to organize one in my neighborhood and on the 'list of things that would apply to the neighborhood' they would have made me take down my ham radio antennas and do something different wrt my carport. Seriously, no carports. And the rules they wanted were specifically to include no grandfathering. And my carport is literally part of the house.
---
But hopefully WeeHaw if it comes to PC won't make me fence in my Brahmin. I like Mindy &amp; Lindy to roam free!

It's already an alternate timeline. Just pretend that in this alternate timeline, Sutton was settled somewhere else.

You need to go to the Vendors of a different faction.  Same factions share same money base until reset.  Explained here.  [https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/9yudk1/faction\_vendors\_locations/](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/9yudk1/faction_vendors_locations/)
---
Hey man, sorry to bump an old thread, but since we're already friends, i was wondering if you can still offer ultracite pa mods. i would like calibrated shocks and core assembly. how much for these 3 things?
---
Try selling something. Sometime the vendor will show 0 caps until you sell something.
---
I‚Äôm all over I go every where trying to find a good stock of stuff for all levels 
---
Just because its a wasteland home, doesnt mean your home has to be a wasteland. Come vist a three story house with a manicured yard that comes complete with all the amenities a wastelander could ever need. We'll grill out some muttchops, have a cold nukacola and see how high those caps can go.
---
PM me for a tour tonight.
---
Honestly, I would keep it so you could possible sell it when player vending is released. 
---
This is a really good way to be unable to avoid people who are harassing you, or won‚Äôt leave you alone.
---
I don‚Äôt think I see a single benefit to this kind of algorithm.
---
It fucks with the servers. I don't have any emotional investment in how they play. I don't like that the servers- which are already shaky at best- are less stable when they cheat. 
---
You think I'm mad because people have better stuff than me? Come on man. 
---
no then you have asshat blocking doors or hallways and as melee you can still one shot things easy. 
---
The problem is that the aggro persists after you die.
---
Works dandy with scorched.  
---
I apologise but I don't understand what you mean.... PA skin sales?
---
I have no issue at all with Whitespring ghouls when I am at &lt;20% health. Damage does not seem to go "straight through" but I do have to do the diluted radaway+stimpack combo when they mob me.

Seriously, it got me through some of my low levels. I keep it around to level my other characters.
---
Duplicating items
---
there is 7 different factions..look them up..whichever vendor you were just at..look for another vendor for a different faction and they will have 200 caps reset...also sometimes i notice a vendor will have zero caps..ill buy something small lets say a camera and it will then reset their caps to 200..i think that is some sort of glitch so i always buy something that is useful for low caps to test it out if that doesnt work i know i have to go to a different faction
---
X1x
---
No, they need funds to continue development. A sale at half price is better than no sale.
---
put them in the cash register next to the vendor
---
that's what a lot of people are doing and is becoming more widely known to check
---
Water and a good view. I can't tell you where, exactly, because it's a seriously nice view and about 1/5 times someone else is placed there. But there are a few good spots like that around the map in almost every zone. 
---
http://dulfy.net/2018/11/22/fallout-76-vendors-locations-and-factions-guide/
---
200 caps per faction per day. Do not visit a vendor in the same faction, you are wasting your time.  Just visit one of each faction per day. Sometimes vendor will say 0 when it actually has caps. Just sell something and it will update.
---
Totally agreed!  I missed spending much time in the toxic valley in the Beta, spending more time there now on my alt
---
My bad
---
Well it could have been something else amazing.
---
Where is this caps display?
---
I liked my ski sword.
---
always say 'hi!' that's what i do
---
Caps are player based, while inventories are server based. You were just wasting your caps.
---
Any of the homesteads have massive amounts of flat farmland near them to build on , that or near a less used workshop like Gorge. Again a large flat area to build on is always a major plus when building. 
---
I think I'll just save up my atoms until they change the shop; prices, inventory retention, or otherwise. 
---
None of my plans have ever appeared as sellable.
---
Got my first explosive at level 48.
---
Level 10 10mm submachine, vampire and explosive.
---
Gonna be nice for an alt I guess.
---
I agree with you, 1000 rad resist on my armor should function the same as 1000 rad resist on PA or Hazmat suit. If they are not meant to be comparable please make the numbers reflect that (ie 1000 rad resist on armor and hazmat at 3000). However the repeated bold shouting, odd call outs to Todd, and claims of "It worked in FO4, why can't it work here" detracts from your point and could come across as whining rather than attempting to discuss a response
---
Might have it as a keepsake, or if some op dude is griefing lower levels, but the less tse handmades out there the better.
---
Dude, it fucks with the servers. Do you really not know that? This is how people are hunting dupers. They look for the fucked server
---
Ok
---
Similarly, I would be interested in representing the HOA on Xbox.
---
Add me if you want, wheeldogz 
---
Mysterious saviour in luck tree will bring you back, more often than not, but can still fail
---
It‚Äôs only really useful vs humans, and Fallout 76 doesn‚Äôt have many of them.
---
Yeah I always run into issues because my build spots are angled or odd üòÇ
---
It's a conspiracy. This mid century modern blog is in on it too. http://www.madformidcentury.com/2012/08/eichler-mid-century-doors.html?m=1
---
For real though, it's a fairly common design and color for the mid century modern theme. 
---
Yeah 
---
That‚Äôs awesome! I‚Äôm lev 33, playing slow so lucking out on a Santa gift would help for sure! Hide well big man! I‚Äôll be watching for you!
---
I feel that, i originally had a spot in cranberry bog but scorchbitches made that a negatory spot, so now I'm camped out beside a dam
---
would you kind adding me?
---
my username is Corial8, a planet I invented for a game I once developed. :)
---
Get the Bird Bones mutation ... YOU"LL FLOAT TOO!
---
Are super mutant effected by the rads?
---
Of course it's an unpopular opinion, the people providing those videos are forcing Bethesda's hand.
---
They could leave it if it were an isolated problem, but if everyone starts doing it, it will get fixed more quickly.
---
i like the rivers too..i like to be away from everything..i have a very minimal camp only stash box, stove, and bed..the bed usually ends up  getting destroyed by something but whatever..the river is helpful for crafting my soup..i really really want to find a cave but ive yet to find one..heard there is a bunch by vault 76..but right now im in the mountains not too far from whitespring
---
Ive had the reset just randomly as well, didnt do anything.
---
Other times only a server log works.
---
Just a keypad switch is in the 'advanced power connectors' plan
---
Zephyrthrills
---
Add me I‚Äôll be on later this evening 
---
They will fix the "air" bug, but I agree, love my Cultist dagger!
---
I try to carry an extra one or two to give to clueless TSE jerks 
---
Ehm... what? Don't know what that means, sorry.
---
Powered Door and Warehouse.. seriously I've been looking for weeks
---
Anytime I accidentally hit someone, I just pretend like nothing happened. They usually do the same.
---
I can't tell if y'all are friends or just the last three people that don't know what duping does to the servers. I don't give two shits what toys they have, I hate what they do to the infrastructure of the game, making it nearly impossible to play at all at times
---
Easy!
---
Step 1: see a plan you want
---
Step 2: buy the plans
---
Step 3: realize you already had them
---
Step 4: realize vendors won‚Äôt buy plans
---
Taa da!  It just works :)
---
It‚Äôs silly when anyone thinks a company has ‚Äúlost faith‚Äù in their game. It‚Äôs not that simple to abandon. Other than that, I‚Äôm assuming you see those low prices in retailers and online? Because the game is still being sold at full price $59.99 on the actual Bethesda site. Retailers are likely dropping down their prices to try and get more ppl to buy their copies.
---
They never completely copy the maps; they make their own mashups of the region; taking locations they enjoy and reworking them into a new world layout.
---
This. If I am the one that launches the nuke, sorry. I'm TSE'ing it all the way. Someone else's nuke? I use something else. 
---
This is an insult to Tiny Tina 
---
Thirdstorm, I'm not always "playing" sometimes just wheeling and dealing, but more than a few decent folks often around 
---
Ps4 bockyhal2
---
Would like to show you my whitesprings nuke ready base with artillery cannon at the ready. Comes complete with resources open to the public.
---
Be on 12pm GMT (UK)
---
Still this? Bethesda hasnt banned anyone for using mods, keep watching your click bait and believing they aren't just as money grubbing as Bethesda.
---
I usually go overboard, and build fully fledged waterside huts or cabins lmao, which always get demolished by a super mutant with a missle launcher ;-;
---
The problem is finding their base as the base they are at could just be one they stumbled upon. 
---
Been looking for a nuke server for half hour now! Will try to add and join you for some farming
---
*The feels when some clown wants to bring justice down upon you, but you know better and give your caps to your raider buddies* 
---
Sure dude, whatever you say.
---
You can always get more of whatever you need from playing the game.
---
Makes sense. 
---
The second part is funny. It‚Äôs too bad that there aren‚Äôt PvP servers. If I went to hunt someone for the bounty, I couldn‚Äôt really get mad if they ambushed me! :D
---
I killed myself so often I started carrying a TS and TSE to avoid killing myself
---
I'm playing this right now, got the first round but stuck on the second as there is no swarm appearing. :P
---
From time to time these little guys spawn in the world, and you can scrap em if you are able to pick them up.
---
I mean their radiation damage goes straight through even with 5/5 sentinels and 3/3 blocker. Like 30-100 per pop. 
---
PA is considerably easier for me.
---
I didn't really use the camps during beta because I tried to use all of my time exploring... these were a thing? I was literally thinking about this today and thought it was a great idea. Why would they remove them?? üôÑ
---
Fun fact: This also goes for workshops. So when that douche canoe takes your workshop and comes away with a small bounty you can trash the place for no consequences.
---
Just something to add to this. Last night I snuck into a wanted player‚Äôs base and shot him with my explosive shotgun‚Äî I immediately became wanted with a 10 cap bounty.  Im assuming the area damage lingered after the player was killed... either way I was surprised ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
You should just sneak around the map singing for people. 
---
Normally everyone disconnects when I join :'(
---
I move my camp a lot actually. Anytime I see a cute little area that isn't taken I give it a shot. Someday I hope to find a spot nobody else really likes that I can just leave my camp on, but I haven't been too lucky yet.
---
Initially I was building under those big power line structures (forgot what they're called) because it was some of the only flat land I could find in the forest lol.
---
BKLN92
---
This happens in cdifferent spots of the map where I build my camp. I‚Äôll be walking around my camp, and in some spots, my entire camp will glitch and be invisible. It‚Äôs pretty frustrating when I‚Äôm trying to build and place things in a certain spot. 
---
Sweet, will add you when I get on. I've been having issues with freezing when I get out of PA lately and if it happens too many times in a sesson I usually hang it up for the night but hopefully it gets fixed soon
---
It even works with quest items. I was doing the free state quest to make upgrades fans and ended up with 8 of them instead of 5.
---
Bulk mostly metals, and get junk rat lvl 3 to keep some on you yo help out the storage space
---
I am not predisposed to shooting other "allied" creatures/bots, is this not how they all work? I expected everything  I aggro in that way to stay that way until I switch servers or log off.
---
They only loose aggro if you leave the server and rejoin or find a new one. Entering the building not only has them still aggro, but they will start shooting you before you even fully load in. 
---
Is there a good discord channel for friendly folks like this?  I play a lot solo and it would be great to make some connections.
---
Man, I really love this game but the subreddit is starting to become really annoying. You can't say anything, even an honest opinion without someone immediately downvoting you lol. Like I said in another thread; Some of you all are miserable af.
---
+300 hours, I've gotten one 2 shot laser pistol (lame) and zero explosive weapons, I've gotten plenty of 3* weapons. Just waiting for RNGesus to bless me with a 2 shot guass or explosive .50 Cal.
---
The damage is all rifleman. The damage TYPE (for enemy DR) is ballistic as far as I know. But the crafting skills are energy, I‚Äôm not sure if the Ammo is affected by Bandolier (ballistic) or Batteries Included (energy), but the actual damage IS affected by the Grounded mutation (half-damage with energy weapons.
---
So Gauss is a bit of a Frankenstein weapon. 
---
I hate those robots 
---
I've had lower level griefers do this to me. Jump in front of me while I'm shooting a bloated until I hit him and go red. Then he backed to shoot me with his exploding weapon before I can turn. I finally turned on pacifist to give me time to hop servers.
---
Hot damn. Dream hammer.
---
Don't store 4400 pieces of steel lol. That was like 250lbs of stash haha.
---
Go find another power armor frame, remove all your armor from your current one, scrap it, then get in the new frame.
---
There's atleast one bugged frame still in circulation (IMHO) have had that happen before, with some CTD's when switching servers etc) and that fixed it for me
---
Ooh I like your suggestions the Ghoul one especially.
---
As of now keypads do nothing but open and close the door if you enter in the code, they don't actually lock the switch.
---
Drugs and/or power armor.
---
Was this on ps4 with two towers built with turrets all over them
---
It helps to not be over encumbered and to ignore all the beasts from point a to b and back
---
It‚Äôs self balancing too. Trade off some extra carry weight for easy access to the exp buff.
---
Can't get swing speed and power attack on same weapon sadly.
---
Also, I'm not friends with anybody here. I really hate to sound like such a dick but I'm just tired of people acting like the dickheads who wanna fuck around in this piece of shit game should be burned at the stake whereas Bethsoft deserves 0% of the blame. The game is 100% grinding, the only thing cheating progression does is steal your own playtime.
---
White horse was Conquest/Victory(Old Term) or Pestilence(New Term used).
---
I watched as the Lamb opened the first of the seven seals. Then I heard one of the four living creatures say in a voice like thunder, ‚ÄúCome and see!‚Äù I looked, and there before me was a white horse! Its rider held a bow, and he was given a crown, and he rode out as a conqueror bent on conquest. ( Revelation 6:1-2)
---
Pale horse was Death.
---
When the Lamb opened the fourth seal, I heard the voice of the fourth living creature say, ‚ÄúCome and see!‚Äù I looked and there before me was a pale horse! Its rider was named Death, and Hades was following close behind him. They were given power over a fourth of the earth to kill by sword, famine, and plague, and by the wild beasts of the earth. (Revelation 6:7-8)
---
Yeah, I have noticed a lot of people don't build next to the river on the Western side of the map, but it's a good spot. Haha, maybe I'll build near Deathclaw Island.
---
And yet every survival PvP game has failed to see this solid statement. Ark why you must be hot shit?!
---
I've gotten my money's worth. Some of it in just the flat out amusement at how badly Bethesda missed on virtually all the promises and delivered a warm baloney sandwich of a game. 
---
Idk about PC or ps4. But on xbox if you go to the fallout76 game in store, there is a multiplayer lfg tab built in. I'm sure theres an equivalent for ps4
---
At level 7.... make yourself a spiked board.  Hunt down scorched at Morgantown Airport.  Feel free to use whatever weapons and ammo they drop while saving the .308 rounds you find.  Also, the majority of super mutants that use guns at your level use hunting rifles, whereas scorched use a variety of guns.
---
You should put turrets inside your building simply to have them protected more; enemies can and will prioritize the generators given the chance. Higher tier turrets use electricity so it also makes sense to defend it correctly so they aren't targeted first as well as the issue of PvP where a player can take down your electricity in one fell swoop if not protected. Right now PvP is unbalanced but once they balance it out generators will become more of a priority to grief first.
---
I plopped my camp down in a spot just north of the bog in the mountains which provided a good source for water and crops and a nice little cabin. Very seldom do I play and get a message "you can't live here" message.
---
By lost faith I mean that they think they can't fix major flaws anymore and try to get as much money out of the game as possible, until turning services on another title with a (hopefully) better future. A decision I can understand, but I cannot support.
---
Yes, I tried to make sure to add that with "key offer" in the title - might not be obvious on the first look - my bad!
---
So someone else launched the nuke and you feel you deserve to tag everything?
---
What if he nuked it himself 
---
[Sure thing](https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=f382f49&amp;d=sq2s32s22sr2sb2p90p80pa0e60em1ep1er2ic4s12ip2s72a00ls2lu2lt2cu0ce0ib3&amp;w=&amp;n=Heavy)
---
yes we have confirmed through other not in our group that they can pick up items we leave in the Overseer's Cache inside the church at Flatwoods.
---
Assholes. I've stopped playing FO76 during this duping scandle, I've actually haven't touched FO76 in 5 weeks (yes a longer period than than the duping bug) . I wont consider playing it again until the duping bug is fixed.
---
This should had been addressed with a hotfix patch. The fact it hasn't fucking blows my mind. Either they dont know how to fix it, or dont care about the bug.
---
Revelation 6:1-2
---
But.. that's almost a quarter. :D I get your point though - might just be so the addons get developed with better quality.
---
How do you have that many?  I have one and break it frequently in the melee (even with makeshift). Care to trade caps for an extra?
---
I crouch and stand up a lot.
---
Rip to you if they ever get angry xD
---
You have some control over your spawn, but not visitors. Visitors to my camp spawn underwater inside of a concrete foundation. 
---
noticed this since i moved my camp there but directly south of watoga station near the farm is an unmarked fissure that spawns a passive scorchedbeast
---
Thats an awesome story! Sounds like a hell of a fun guy to play with.
---
P.S interested in linking discords? Id love to grt some smaller groups into full clans. 
---
I listen to the classical station because it seems to have more variety than the other one. Got old hearing a song I had just heard what seems like 15 minutes ago pop back on. I'm not sure how they randomize the songs but I feel like it isn't done well. 
---
Found a selling duper
---
There‚Äôs a blacklist going around in the trader subreddit. 
---
Another way to help craft is to find a lead resource in the open world and build your camp around it. There are maps showing where they are.  An extractor and a few generators should be doable if you focus on those components.  Also be sure to lock it (in modify mode).
---
Also as someone who used 308 a lot, it‚Äôs important to have a back up weapon or two for farming and easy encounters.  Ie a melee weapon and another ammo type gun.  Depends on your build and level but a 38 pipe rifle, 45 combat rifle, or even a laser rifle could suffice.  Splitting your ammo usage helps a lot.
---
Sounds like a latency issue to the servers.
---
How do you have the screws to repair PA once a day???
---
Pretty sure the ivory grip mod plan would sell. Might not now? Who knows with this game anymore. Maybe it'll all make more sense in the next month or so after a few more patches to right the ship. 
---
It's not too hard once you know the correct route. Most bits you can run but with the balancing sections just take a steady pace - practice beforehand to get the hang of it if you like.
---
It is on something like a 10 to 15 minute real time timer , if no one has entered the cell it will reset. It leads to an incredible ability to farm things in areas that no one ever goes to. 
---
I usually see this plan at watoga vendor
---
Let me play my Guitar Sword pls
---
Huh, never knew that. In that case I guess it would be Bloodied, Vampire, and +40% power attack damage.
---
Honest answer, it's pretty easy. 
---
If you have an interaction with a player, or just choose one specific player, and watch them for a while, you will see them jumping around the map as they adventure. Their camp is likely in the spot that they jump back to most often. 
---
I've only done this once when I was hunting bounties. It made it really easy to find the guy, because I was waiting for him at his camp by the time he got back, and then he had no choice but to fight.
---
I no longer have the game installed as it's a pile of unfinished dogshit. I am still, however, allowed to talk about it.
---
Same here, took 3 times, before Scarlett was born, First she was sapphire, and then garnet both times, locked up and booted me on exiting the vault. 3rd time, I just took whatever they gave me and ran out the door, at least this one made it.
---
Happened to me for 20 minutes once in nuked whitesprings, I was in a ps voice group of 8 and everyone disconnected one by one until there was only 2 of us left. Was glorious
---
A lot of the really scenic spots are always occupied but the really convenient spots are vacant, which is cool but shows what most peeps value lmao
---
16/32 damage? I believe in FO4 that was about right but what I‚Äôve been hearing is in FO76 it‚Äôs a percentage of the weapon damage...
---
YEah they need to fix that. I lost my T-60 Calibrated shock right leg due to it.
---
I think it's 2 Firecap, 2 Bloodleaf and 2 Snaptail to make a forest Remedy at a chemistry station.  You should get the recipe from the first set of responder quests. 
---
This isn't a bug, it's a feature.
---
...that's the first time anyone has said those phrases in that order about this game lol.
---
Don‚Äôt dupe 
---
That is certainly an interesting observation. Maybe they used the same reference? I have played around with 3d modelling and texturing etc. I could make that door in 5 minutes. I've often felt disappointed with some Sims packs, with the small number of things for the price, and nothing great. These companies could really provide amazing value for money. They could make you feel like you really got your moneys worth, but instead they sell a door for $5. I could fill that store from with cool things that people would really want to spend money to buy and I'm a beginner amateur at 3d modelling. What the heck are these companies doing?
---
They should set up a Raider bot to pay off your bounty (at some exorbitant fee, most likely). That way you still have to pay a price for misdeeds, but don't need to worry about junk loss, and that would seem like a thing the raiders would do. 
---
The overall question was: "What is the best way to get ammo?"
---
That's the question I answered. At level 7? Obviously you won't have those perks. But now OP knows what to work toward in the future.
---
they're still getting ganked for those caps though
---
What kind of shotgun? My two-shot Combat Shotgun works well in VATS when modded for accuracy.
---
Holy shit, idk what's more pathetic, that you're obviously using a second account or that you still want the game to change because you went max endurance like a dipshit.
---
Can't. Stop. Laughing.
---
&gt; I‚Äôm assuming you see those low prices in retailers and online?
---
No, he's seeing that price on those game key sites.  I'll let you [make up your own mind on those sites](https://thelegality.com/reviews/is-cdkeys-legit/).  However you feel about them, they usually have the lowest price, and it's definitely *NOT* retail price.
---
Of course they don't - but those shops want to make profit aswell. So obviously they must've decent deals with Bethesda to get prices that far down. (Don't want to mention the vendor, I don't think it's allowed in here)
---
And yes, absolutely developers are not making the prices - but if the game isn't worth further development due to the low profit the Devs will be put into other projects. They're just workers like you and me.
---
&gt;How do you manage this?
---
1) Unless I am pursuing a specific goal, I only keep about 100-150 of each kind of scrap. I bulk and sell the rest to vendors.
---
2) I sell any weapons and armor that don't fit the build I am playing. These two things can fill up your box really fast.
---
3) I sell all drugs because I don't use them. I only keep the necessary healing chems.
---
4) I get rid of all ammo for guns I don't use. Missiles, mini nukes, and few other types like 2mm ECs are really heavy.
---
5) Build a few water purifiers and you never need to stockpile drinks. They provide enough for your needs for as long as you play. Just empty them when you go back to your camp to drop off junk.
---
6) Most of the magazines and bobbleheads I sell, with few exceptions. Stockpiling these was taking up way too much space.
---
7) Make sure you scrap junk before you store it. Unscrapped junk weighs a lot more than the scraps.
---
I have a wonderful view of the entire bog. Enemies never attack me... so peaceful. 
---
I love to set up near Wixxon because new characters need food and waters , my setup allows access to some of this
---
Anyone who dupes is trash, and please use the H:/W: format
---
I had a spot between the cemetary and the workshop along the river there. Only found one instance where someone else was there. Definitely a great spot! Lots of good places for junk like adhesive within walking distance. 
---
It's not even a creative solution (absolutely no offense meant to poster of it, it is 100% the right thing to do), it's like... A very basic, common sense solution fairly common in games like this that should have been baked into the game at launch, as it was already known this was a problem in previous fallout games.
---
I don't know why we're in this situation.
---
I first got my plans from the overseer stash in the Charleston DMV. Has that changed?
---
Nah, go after everyone.  But it's not even their fault.  Fix the game.   
---
If you guys don't know by now to be extra careful, you deserve whatever happens to you.
---
If you shot back, you willingly opened PvP .. so I don't see the issue? The guy sounds like he was an ass but you did afford him the opportunity to be
---
They still have to pay their employees as well. They dont just take a hike when the game is done. lol
---
Whoa thanks for the information!! 
---
Jesus that sounds redickoulous
---
It's something - I guess? :P
---
More like Judge Dudd. Raiders for life!
---
Yea you need more game experience and/or knowledge
---
That is such an awesome story! Im still waiting to have an encounter like this but I am going to atart playing solo more as my group has dwindled to just me.
---
Is there any way to join your positive FO76 discord? If you're not comfortable posting it freely im reddit then please feel free to message me if i am able to join ^.^
---
Found a mountain top. Oh the views. 
---
Two shot does update the damage.  Also the impact of your current perks will show up in that number.  However it‚Äôs something like damage per time it‚Äôs fired, not a DPS number so attack speed will not change it.
---
Hope this helps,
---
How does one obtain more orbital strikes
---
Personally, 50 of each junk, more of only what you need to repair
---
(the exception is if you are crafting to scarp stuff to learn mods)
---
Only horde weapons/armor that are usable to your build.
---
example, I keep a few different slots of chameleon armor in case I need to shift things around, but no more then that.
---
reduce the gunpowder/bobby pins that you carry or stash
---
Burnt Books/magazines/et cetera have no value outside selling to vendors
---
I throw away almost nothing and have done allot of WhiteSprings Runs...
---
Sure something can be worked out, have a whole suite of Vampiric 1*'s
---
Thirdstorm IGN / Discord Thirdstorm#1655
---
Thats exactly what i do. Ive gotten funny responses when i just walk up to people and ask to be shot in the face. Usually they ask if im sure. 
---
There's almost always one at Pylon V 13 over near Bog Town. 
---
I believe Appalachia is known for Bluegrass not the Blues, though that may be changing...  
---
[https://folkways.si.edu/magazine-summer-2010-appalachian-blues/african-american-folk/music/article/smithsonian](https://folkways.si.edu/magazine-summer-2010-appalachian-blues/african-american-folk/music/article/smithsonian)
---
&gt;\[...\] Why, with such an array of blues legends‚Äîthe Empress of the blues, the Queen of the blues, and the Godfather of soul‚Äîhas the region's blues tradition received so little attention?  
---
&gt;Part of the answer lies in the sheer size of the region. The Appalachian Mountain chain cuts diagonally across the Eastern United States from New York to Mississippi, with Appalachian counties in a full thirteen states. Another factor has to do with demographics. Common wisdom held that there wasn't a sufficient black population in the mountains to sustain a viable blues tradition, in contrast with the cotton belt of the Deep South. One result of this bias was to associate the region almost exclusively with the country-music industry, which historically excluded black musical participation.  
---
&gt;A closer look at the region and its history reveals a more complicated story. First, in regard to demographics, the black population varied significantly from Alabama to West Virginia, and while whites may have outnumbered blacks across the region as a whole, the ratio was by no means uniform.
---
Is bulking worth it now? 
---
Yep! My play partner has 3 CHA but gets drunk to share ammosmith with me when she wants me to make her shotgun shells
---
ha..nice..i invested sooooo much time building a settlement in fo4..once i do become much higher level..i will have time to create a nice camp..but right now im grinding away
---
It's only like 15 each with the cheaper pa repair perk. Head to the abandoned bog town and go on top of the big building, go down the elevator shaft and rejoice.
---
Oh and get weapon mastery, with makeshift 5 + 200% weapon health, works well
---
Build near a train station or other vendor that is near to where you are questing at the time
---
You should know by now to be careful. If you don't that lesson's gonna be taught until it sinks in
---
Already saw a video somewhere of someone "glitching" and taking no damage from multiple high level players while standing still.
---
Turns out he just had a set Assassin's Unyielding armor and some damage redux perks.
---
Do you have any passive things that could be doing damage to them? No reason they should be attacking you unless you‚Äôre doing any damage to them 
---
I bought one at the whitesprings bunker  vendor in the military wing. I've seen All Rise for sale there at least once too.
---
Or you could just run around, button mash and get fucked up by WhiteSprings security. üòÇü§£üòÇü§£üòÇ
---
Thanks, hell, Playing as a Deathclaw would be fun, you can only wear 'scrappy' armors (leather/trapper/etc.) and can't use small guns, can use 'heavy' weapons with modification, no picking locks, or hacking terminals, but can 'force' open doors by ramming them (repeatedly if needed) and well....YOUR A FUGGIN DEATHCLAW
---
Seems like current bugs are getting in the way of us knowing for sure. 
---
Destroying a workshop will get you up into the 200+ range pretty easily. Someone came by and wrecked my wife's setup on Posideon, to her great amusement. She'd spent hardly anything of her own resources kitting it out, but the guy still wracked up a 240 cap bounty.
---
Sadly, there is no happy ending. My wife was looking forward to engaging in some actual PvP for once, only for the server to crash just as she was getting her gear together. Sadtrombone.wav
---
That's not how caps work. 21 hour reset timer, 7 vendor types and each will have 200 caps. And there is a bug where some show 0 caps. You'll get it once you understand these machanics.
---
Armor that eliminates chems and aid weight so I can free up 6 special points to respec. 
---
Do the quest for the mayor in watoga.
---
Yeah I feel ya once I checked that suitcase and found literally thousands of duped stimpaks, psychos, buffouts, purified waters and radXs. I gave what I could to my friends, put some in my stash for myself and left the rest.
---
For 50 tickets I want you to drink from the lake while I paint a Bob Ross landscape painting. I also need you to battle another moose. I've got another guy who can play that role. 
---
Why would Beth allow such a stupidly high level amount to even occur? Is there no cap whatsoever? I figured it would be 500 or something. 
---
What's a TSE?
---
I took it as a question with a condition. 
---
"What is the best way to get ammo *at level 7*?"
---
Why else would OP mention that? Your info for higher levels or a target to achieve is great, perfect even, but not for a level 7's current predicament of having no ammo.
---
Yea that‚Äôs players selling them to the vendor, your getting a second hand one, probably lower level ones.
---
I've become wanted because I shot the base belonging to someone else my bounty just so happened to be taking refuge in. 
---
Duping is an exploit and considered cheating 
---
Cheating is being frowned upon 
---
(Looks at OP with a frowning face expression)
---
No lol. I just have problems when they talk about how cheaters are bad, and then they mention how they've tried it before, or show them doing it on a stream
---
Boston and Massachusetts was a mess in Fallout 4
---
They take massive liberties with the geography because, not only because of the condensing, but for narrative reasons and ease of reference.
---
They're still pretty great if you don't have any equivalent legendaries.  My Somerset Special on my first two builds consistently fulfilled my pistol needs when no other modes handgun could compare.  I was still using a level 5 weapon into my 30s.
---
I love this my dude! I try to be a friendly home keeper when peeps are on, im right newr grafton dam and love to help newbies decimate the supermutants up their if they need help
---
Well, I agree that they should make it clear what makes you wanted, like marking picked locks etc.. And remove wanted from workshop lockpicks.. 
---
 However, those are very rare occurances..
---
Just change servers, the next ones should be friendly ..
---
100 hours in and I haven't had a problem ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
The atomic blasts blew Sutton up into the air, and it landed on Corley.  That's my story, and I'm sticking to it.
---
I bought it at the black friday price of $50 instead of $80.  
---
I still would have paid $80.  I think its a fine game, that gave me what I wanted.  
---
It has glitches, just like any other game I played at launch.  
---
Within those glitches there are people exploiting and ruining the game, just like any other game I played at launch.  
---
They are patching issues as they can, just like any other game I played at launch.  
---
We're just past the 2 month mark here.   The price drop is a direct reaction to people reading opinions and being scared off the product, so to incentivise, they drop the price, to remove a potential barrier.  
---
They're looking at long term atomic shop purchases paying for future development, so the initial one time buy mean little to them on the whole.
---
Combat Armor is pretty light with the proper perks, so Pocketed is close to a wash, but Deep Pocketed gains 10 pounds of carry capacity, which is significantly better than the Ultra Light build savings.
---
I'm not a second account. And I didn't max endurance. You only need 5 points in endurance for Max rad resistance perk, which does nothing. 
---
The game should make it clear that several perks, items, and chems don't do anything.
---
Imagine being so low IQ that you defend things in the game that don't work. Do you also not take issue with energy weapon durability? What other bogus shit do you defend in this broken game?
---
I am sure the mark up at 16 euros is still sufficient to make a profit. 
---
Third party sellers like that are out for profit, but don't get keys from the developers. Most are a market place where people can sell keys to others. Not all of these keys are legitimate or were they acquired legitimately.
---
The best way to see how Bethesda is feeling about the game is to check official retailers and their development blogs. New stuff is coming out.
---
I agree it‚Äôs bizarre that nuked areas mean never using regular armor, but I‚Äôve accepted that nuking isn‚Äôt the only way to endgame.  There are other ways to farm legendaries, or given the current item market and meta anything that makes caps is endgame - and you have the plausible deniability of not knowing for sure that it‚Äôs duped!
---
Your straining my optic nerves due to the amount of eye rolling your statements cause. 
---
10/10, would recommend to everyone 
---
Whoosh...
---
True, they're better off beating super mutants with baseball bats for 3 rounds.
---
This helped me out today. Thanks!

---
If I build a giant chimney will you come?
---
Yeah that‚Äôs what i‚Äôm implying. Any site or external seller that sells them for as cheap as it is now has no indication that a company has given up on their game as the actual company has no say in those prices.
---
Well it doesn't suit everyone of course. 
---
I just happen to have a good farm up at my CAMP which I travel to a lot in a central location. Everything is there and ready. Pit stop per se. :)
---
That is when you pull out your TSE and clear the parking lot of robots.  
---
I think I had to do it twice so definitely not impossible. IIRC someone in your team can help you too. What platform are you playing on?
---
Refund has been issued. 
---
Want to see how many fucks I give? 
---
bottom right
---
Yea maybe revenge once.. I've never picked the revenge option before, its kinda petty unless it's a fun battle between you both 
---
How many times have you switched servers? 
---
Seriously? That's hilariously Bethesda...
---
I run 6 luck with my heavy/explosives/PA build. For bloody mess, and then whatever else I want to toss in (One Gun Army, luck of the draw, starched jeans if I‚Äôm using mutations, whatever). I don‚Äôt use VATS either (vats and PA and heavy weapons/explosives don‚Äôt really go well together)
---
So that‚Äôs where my fusion cells went...
---
I got the plans by scrapping helmets and other combat armor parts. 
---
From what I've read people were using them to create traps... for what little that accomplishes. And it seems like that would still be possible for workshops. They absolutely need to be added back.
---
People still have them from the beta and they say they work fine. They didn't just remove them from the camp items like they did the radio. 
---
Good info! Yes the region known as Appalachia is pretty wide spread, check out the Appalchian Trail for reference. On my bucket list to complete it! As a West Virginia native, yes bluegrass is more commonly know in this part of Appalachia. But also has some other musical influence and roots such as blues, country, rock or rock-a-billy. 
---
Yeah, I keep waiting for Fallout: Chicago. Maybe that's what the FO76 expansions will be. Dare to dream

I know.  I want him as president, with his own radio station.

I can only assume the will release more and more songs with updates to keep the world moving and their content fresh 
---
Ahhh I miss galaxy news Radio 
---
It's a combat. It still works but it's not as reliable as just ADSing. A lot of times it will do low damage which means a bunch of the pellets just flat out missed. There's just never a situation where it's better for me to VATS with the shotgun. I don't have the spread perk though. That would probably help but seems like a big sacrifice.  
---
I have one for sale 
---
Ive come to realize that most reviewers on youtube are full of B.S., and most likely just read articles and other videos, then fake an opinion to get hits. Some are reallly good at it.

And here we are.

Bottom of the vendors trade window
---
Yeah.. i've got like 8 corn planted with green thumb that'll last me more than a weeknight play session.. its just way easier to munch on random meat I pick up.
---
I'm a working robot. I have somewhere around 270 lvls from Beta til today between my three builds
---
Yes, this is the meta.  Ignore your build, put on power armor, and spray a shit weapon hoping to tag the legendary.  :(
---
endgame is whining online just like endgame in every other online game ever
---
Good lord did you must have the marsupial mutation because you're jumping to all kinds of conclusions. Guess that also makes you part of the circus act you clown.
---
Maybe you server hopped back into your previous server? Try just doing something else away from whitesprings.
---
Go inside whitesprings hotel, talk to a vendor, go outside, should help.
---
&gt;I've let them kill me I've switched servers and they still attack me
---
Satellite dropping
---
I'm in the same boat as you.  The holder for the batteries almost broke when getting to the battery compartment.  Then I put in the batteries, and ... nothing.  No lights, no voice, nada.  Based off of everybody's response to the whole bag deal, I expect that I just flushed the extra money down the toilet.
---
No passive things I think it might just be glitched
---
More times than not I find myself clearing out the Silos alone, so trust me that I'm not mooching off of someone elses nuke. (Which isn't just a 30 min. endeavor, but takes a ton of .45 ammo)
---
Also I don't use more than one gun for a couple of reasons.
---
1. Nerfing myself due to poor game design is not something I will do. I actually found my own TSE lever action rifle, and now i'm expected not to use it during one of the two end game activities? 
---
2. Even if I did carry around another gun, I often run into the problem that I can't even hit the ghoul everyone's crowding around because they're all in super beefy power armor using melee. 
---
3. If I use grenades, I'll run out, and it often just throws the bodies around everywhere that makes it difficult to loot. 
---
I never use power armor because I can sneak around better in a hazmat suit, and I really don't like to wear power armor. 
---
I've seen this, so cool!  
---
Also, I walked by one Eyebot that was voiced by Hynden Walch (played Princess Bubblegum in Adventure Time) that asked me to do some super science-y stuff, but my knowledge of science was not high enough. Cool little easter egg.
---
If Bethesda had some actual communicae that warranted new threads, they would exist.
---
I did that i. Poisedon power plant. Got stuck in highky radioactive water. Eventually got tired of waiting so I took off the armor and lo and behold I was able to swim out. Course thats not quite as bad as falling into fissures and seeing your little brown bag of loot still sitting there when you respawn. 
---
This has probably already been mentioned, but.... White Springs Golf Club is a goldmine for Legendary stuff. I pretty much start every session with a stop there. 20ish ghouls, anywhere between 2 and 5 of them legendary. I generally get crappy armor, but sometimes it's a gun or melee weapon. I just got a 3* bat (nocturnal, +1 STR, and increasing damage, I think) which I might play around with. The rest is easy caps.
---
Plus, there are usuallyy 4 or 5 golf outfits/skirts laying about, which sell for 20 caps apiece. Easy money.
---
I actually went looking for this one last night, and it was not there.
---
I generally lock everything up.
---
I have a normal water pump and crops outside people can help themselves to but my house is my house...of which I generally leave the front door open by accident 
---
I laughed so hard /u/rodneykang goodjob 
---
Whats a dupe?
---
In the last 2 days I've had encounters with 3 Vengeful Mothmen and 4 Mythical Flatwoods Monsters. All right up against the cliffs to the west of Watoga. The inventory of the first of the Mothmen never loaded, the rest of the Mothmen and Mythical Flatwoods Monsters inventories were completely lame.
---
I keep 50 radaway and 50 diluted on hand, the rest only about 5 of each and sell everything else.
---
Gatling gun is a heavy gun, so anything that says heavy guns affects it. It is ALSO currently affected by the Martial Artist perk to increase its fire rate. This is a bug, don‚Äôt rely on it, but enjoy it while it lasts. 
---
It‚Äôs all fun and games until the base he‚Äôs hiding in is his friends O_O
---
The thing is that those weapons are fairly easy to get from other players if you look for them. 
---
I was drunk the other night and while I was fine with my TSE lever-action, I decided to pick up a TSE handmade and a gatling for use another time. I bought them each for around 2k caps from other players. 
---
I could definitely see a handmade just destroying anything in its path with its high mag count. With the gatling you have to kill everything before it gets to you or you kill yourself due to the explosvie damage. 
---
I still just use my TSE lever-action because the game would be a bore if I went with anything more powerful.
---
If I could store more weapons, I would save a non-legendary handmade for use with other players.
---
Week 3, Whitesprings. Week 5, Whitesprings again. None since.
---
&gt;Im not sure that people dont like playing the game and would rather pay someone to play it for them.
---
I love playing the game, but sometimes I only have an hour or so to play. It takes me around 30 minutes to clear the silo, which leaves me 30 minutes to actually kill things in the nuke zone. I would happily pay this guy  to start 30 minutes before I get home from work so that there's a nuke zone waiting for me when I log in. 
---
Scorchbeast I think best sums this up. It has to be based on how many people are nearby, and what level.
---
Or just weird coding, idk.
---
Trump stop blaming others for your shit taste put down your phone and get back to work
---
It's "retro" in the Sims because it's an old school '50s style design. But everything in the Fallout universe is styled around those '50s designs being "modern" in 2077 when the bombs dropped. Same with the clothes, decor, etc. Retro came back in the 2070s and was considered "modern" again. 
---
Lmao, so you just happen to type with 1 bold sentence like op and parrot his talking points of pistols, energy weapons and explosive affixes? Yeah, it's obvious (and pathetic!), bud. 
---
It just takes time which I don't have a lot of.
---
FAM I didn't even know I had a bounty till I left. I was using a single shot hunting rifle with vats. I was hardly like I was spraying around with a minigun. I don't mind being killed for an accident that's fair play. But to have my home demolished for no good reason is just sad. Honestly OP sounds toxic AF. He wants to stalk a player for who knows how long just to possibly find their base, wait for them to leave then waste an orbital strike. 
---
Maybe it was put in for future content...
---
I don't hate it, but I hate on it, a lot.
---
Not because it's fashionable.
---
But because this is an unfinished, recycled game with broken and half-assed mechanics left and right, terrible gun balance, and horrible server stability issues, from a well-established AAA developer with a AAA price tag. 
---
The base gameplay loop is great. The environments are great. The concept is great.
---
It falls short... Just about every else.
---
It's getting better, but this game still barely feels like a beta to me. Nondescriptive plans, event mobs spawning underground, buggy perk cards... The list of things that need adjustments is just so, so long. And then charging freemium cash shop prices on top of it? And all the bag bullshit, and the credit card info business?
---
Again, I ENJOY PLAYING THIS GAME. But if you think this game is faultless you need a serious fucking reality check.
---
Goddamn it thanks anyway
---
I've found dungeons also are included with nuked zones. I'm assuming wotoga will be nice. Monster mash would be great. 
---
It's mechanically broken.
---
When the bomb package bursts the 6 mini nukes fly out of your feet to meet the location they fall from, if there is any sort of obstruction they explode when colliding with that. NEVER AIM DOWN, if the nuke package is below you when it goes of the nukes will explode at your feet.
---
This is brilliant, so in conclusion what we actually get will be a third of this ambitious and half as functional.
---
Dude, you've got issues. Posting and then editing to make a completely different post. Get a life, dude.
---
Talking points? Those are widely known and factual issues. Yes, I'm relisting what he wrote, some of those I completely forgot about and was reminded from his post since I now only use ballistic guns. You appear to be moving the goal post since you lost this argument, that much is clear. "Oo, I lost the debate, let me run to bu  bu bu alt!"
---
Do you or do you not find pistols and energy weapons fine? Or do you defend broken shit like that as well like some kind of braindead zombie?
---
It's a bit like poop, only smells 10x worse 
---
I don't think you should loose what you earned already if you leave to join another faction. Other than that, I like this idea.
---
Why do you think you should get access to something you have to glitch to get? Maybe don't glitch shit? Ever think of that?
---
You don't need the items yet though right?    
---
So they have an unopened area for future content, which thankfully it looks like they have fleshed out before releasing, no big deal.  
---
They have said the future of Appalachia in the early new year will include "other vaults opening"
---
More goal post moves. Lose the debate, attack the poster.
---
Think of the fun
---
 Player a shoots with regular 
---
Player B radium heals him
---
Repeat 
---
It‚Äôs for future content. I believe the vaults are going to act like raids (well 4 man party raids) dungeon sorta stuff.
---
Plasma guns only go up to level 45, the enclave one is the level 50 version.
---
Yep, that's exactly it, not the first game to implement this. 
---
I never go back to my camp when I'm wanted. There are plenty of stash boxes just out in the world to store your spoils.
---
radium rifle and gamma gun are worse than pipe rifles now
---
Would you want to get on later today and play for a bit?
---
they will all attack him
---
Makes the game silly and unplayable and can't fast travel away because... enemies
---
Unpopular opinion: If it weren't for Youtubers exposing and giving guides on these bugs, Bethesda Austin would still be in the total dark about them and the bugs would never be patched at all.
---
RGD5IMPACT is the unpaid QA Tester this game needs but doesn't deserve.
---
I just found the ID card.   I was looking for firecap and was headed towards Slocum Joes from Vault 76 and came upon a corpse in white lab coat with a doctors bag next to him in a clearing.    Upon looting him I received a holotape that describes their mission as a failure, a Fujiniya ID card, and a note with the base password.    I've been through that area a ton of times and have never noticed this corpse.  
---
With the perk on, no.
---
You have no rights or opinions to a game you no longer play. Yet try to defend cheaters and talk down to people who say differently than you. You are a reason why the game is shit. And with you gone. It'll get better‚ù§Ô∏è. Kill yourself wanna be trash‚ù§Ô∏èüòò.
---
How much is the damage increased?
---
They farm the legendaries and sell them on eBay :))
---
Plus caps, you're right
---
You have been more than helpful and I apologize for my frustration and negativity.
---
Well monitor the payment source the next few days to confirm 
---
If you would have stopped at the 1st line it would have been a witty comeback. Brevity is the soul of wit. The clown shit bc I use a TSE, you introduced insult into the equation, which is why I called you a salty bitch. 
---
Get it on what ever platform you have friends to play with. Its so much better with friends. On your own its ok but once you complete the main story its pretty boring. Friends solves that issue. 
---
I think its only like a tenner now as well. 
---
There are still quite a few bugs. I havent had anything game breaking, did loose my x01 power armour though.  If you trade with players always trade for caps currently. 
---
&gt; They're the ones giving this game a bad rep
---
Pretty sure that's Bethesda
---
1. Similar setup and the game still runs like mud on my PC. No context on consoles.
---
2. They are purposefully silent but many players are using UI mods to compensate for the typically awful ui.
---
3. If you go pacifist mode, you will be mostly immune from PVP. I have honestly not had any issues with grifers or PVP on the PC but as with anything YMMV./
---
4. You are more likely to lose progress to crashers than PVP because you can exclude yourself from PVP but if lost progress due to bugs and crashes is a big irritant for you. This might not be the game for you at this moment,
---
5. 60+ mostly in teams with wife and a few other friends. Started on Launch Day. Mostly as slow roamers and explorers rather than hardcore push for end game.
---
I'm assuming he means the bonus random perks you get every 5 levels. yea ok p2w
---
That's what it is. 
---
You just gotta space the letter/number/etc a small distance from the adjacent one to get it to work for now. I get some people hate the gaps, but it‚Äôs the best current option and looks pretty nice imo.
---
I just laughed so hard at my phone that my husband thinks there's legit something wrong with me. Try praying to the statue next to the Mothman museum. Maybe you'll fall into his good graces and be forgiven. 
---
I'm the opposite - have it for Xbox and PC and have far fewer crashes on the PC version - at least since the last hotfix (and I use a controller). Whichever way you go, enable pacifist mode to avoid accidentally entering PVP by hitting a player or their camp/items. You also will only lose "junk", not weapons, armor, aid, etc when you die. Only painful if you've spent a lot of time gathering screws and springs and haven't stashed them yet.
---
Here are a couple of my shopping/selling tips.
---
1. For the responders station, I often choose Charleston Train station. Run across the train track before going to the vendor and look for the Grafton monster. He drops around 20 caps which usually pays for the jump there. Then return back and maybe there will be that secret vendor that shows up...or not. Either way then sell.
---
2. For the Grafton Train station, at the base of the stairs, there is a trash can often with 3-5 caps. Love free money.
---
Each train station/vendor I use, I have a quick run/path to go to grab a recipe, plan, mod, comic book, radstag meat, etc., so that even if I miss my 200 cap window, it wasn't a complete loss of a trip. Also, always check cash registers (or suitcases) near the vendor and drop off your old crappy recipes and plans...you'll often find some or give someone else a chance to use yours. Pay it forward!
---
Weird flex buy okay
---
One time farming Golf Club, some asshat jumps on top of the bus by the tennis courts and starts lobbing plasma grenades into the glowing mob(that I was in the middle of hacking away.)  After they nearly drained all my health I stimmed up ran over to the bus, blew it in one swing and took their loot(we were both in PA but I guess my DR was better even though they were higher lvl.)  Serves them right, dont lob grenades into mob fights, dickhead.  
---
Coincidental explosive damage is apparently not a PVP instigator.
---
Got it done in first try just followed the waypoints 
---
Do you pick which card is shared or is it random?
---
Bro, it's obvious you're losing your shit because of MY OPINION, which in and of itself is pathetic. 
---
 Wastelander "Geinen's" CAMP has been evaluated, and she has been paid. Result and pic HERE:[ ](https://twitter.com/HoaWasteland/status/1080915257982214144) https://twitter.com/HoaWasteland/status/1080935956503420928

We are neighbors. I'm close to the observatory. [https://i.imgur.com/9rCTN8p.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/9rCTN8p.jpg) Can see the a corner of Top O by my workshop nook. You get visits from the scorchbeast neighbors over there?
---
How much does it cost?
---
Best way to get laid real quick. 
---
That‚Äôs all I saw. Lulz.
---
Interesting idea. Imagine being able to hand your phone to your gf while you stay in game.   She puts down her copy of InTouch magazine to find you some aid with perception buffs. Then figures out what components you need to repair your most damaged armor. Then she gives you back your phone and leaves you forever. 
---
You know I really hate some parts of the bounty system. I shot a guys base twice while fighting off some hostile Robots and now i have a 15 cap bounty. I wish I could just pay the 15 caps to that player and get rid of my bounty. I wish there was SOME WAY to get rid of minor bounties, its driving me nuts
---
Actually fo76 is just hating yourself.
---
I got mine for next to nothing from a guy that robbed some dupers.
---
1. I play on PS4 and its fine, but if visuals is what you're going for, use your master race access point.  The mods will be better on PC if they do come.
---
2.  They love modders, they're the unpaid interns of bethesda.  It'll happen, just dont know when.  
---
3. PvP is opt in/opt out at you leisure, but you automatically opt in at level 5, but are notified and can turn it off immediately.  
---
4. You will lose crafting items you have recovered and not stored in your bank.  You can then return to your death spot and retrieve your loot, unless another player find it.  The bags are tough to spot, so other wont see it easily, you will have a map marke.  I've lost lots, but its only due to me not going back and depositing before hitting highly populated areas.  Overall, no though, no big loss for dying.  
---
5.  I'm in about 60 hours.
---
so could I do all 3 silos in one day (2hr ish apart) and then do them all again the next day?
---
"See ya!" One hour ago. Lmao.
---
Anyways. Yes. This game has several broken and unbalanced items, factually recorded. This thread lists one of them as the central topic. 
---
DMV Bot tells you to wait for your number even if you go up when it is called.
---
not at all, it‚Äôs quite peaceful. nothing but the breeze and crackle of my bonfire, neighbor 
---
There's a mod on PC to fix that, because you can't expect Beth to do it right.
---
How is it a lack of care? Many games do this. Even if devs test out every possible exploit they can think of, there will likely be more that pop up later or that occur through sheer coincidence. Besides, having content in there isn't uncommon - they made it clear vaults will be opened in the future. It's to their benefit to put things in there to see if it has any adverse effects they didn't anticipate. Theoretically it does not matter because people should not be able to access it, so they could put in a KKK rally inside of a strip club in one of the vaults for all anybody cares
---
save me the rolling pin I ll look ya up in an hour. :)
---
It's not a glass cannon build if you can survive "a few" TSE shots :)
---
Yeah it was the tight rope over the water that was killing me. The other balance beams I know I can do if I take a bit of time.
---
Ironic bit is, 5 minutes after me posting this, I got lucky with a good run and made the course with 2 seconds on the clock. Thanks for the tip though.
---
It'll happen on it's own. I meant to stop trying to level to let my buddy catch up. Hit 50-58 without even trying in three 2 hour sessions. I had to create a new char. 
---
Mostly trying to help him kill the golfer ghouls. He's still 3/10. 
---
Not a lot, energy weapons are weak atm. 
---
We do exist, friendly pc folk! I'll help anyone.
---
It's how I got mine. 
---
That means you.
---
you pick
---
Wouldn‚Äôt say I quit just ran out of stuff to do. Waiting to play once late game content arrives.
---
:( it‚Äôs almost 11 pm here, maybe I can save it for you? :) 
---
I could see maybe keeping your weapons, but you can't be flying the colors of a gang you're not repping! Lawful faction members *can* keep their gear and even equip it after they've left, maybe even if they join another lawful faction. 
---
That'd be great. Somehow my friend leveled at 3x the rate I did...while I killed the majority of the enemies. (Still trying to figure that one out...)
---
Also the loss of loot is infuriating if one of us happens to one shot something. 
---
Don‚Äôt have to be nice but don‚Äôt pretend you are righteous like op
---
Pretty sure there was a post on here from someone claiming that they do work.
---
Sure thing :)
---
&gt; Lock pick bar makes it so you only need one bobby pin
---
Whoa boy, I don't know how I can compete with those guys when I'm only getting enough bobby pins to pick literally every lock I come across and sell the excess to vendors so I don't have a good chunk of my inventory space taken up by all the extra bobby pins that keep accumulating.
---
For all these "statistical" advantages I'm seeing a clear lack of anything to do with statistics. Unless no one let me in on the secret that Fallout is just a competition of seeing how many locks you can pick without breaking these oh so precious bobby pins that are a dime a dozen.
---
There was some power armor thing that zapped enemies, a lot of people forget about that, do you have that?
---
Just trying to help, could totally be a bug. üòä
---
I‚Äôm taking you up on that! üòá
---
Just wait til you try getting it all to work.. you'll wish you'd never foudn em. 
---
Hit level 39
---
It‚Äôs a level 22 who‚Äôs already flagged for pvp, so....no. 
---
Seems this Reddit account was deleted in less than 8 minutes after posting this.  ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
I won the Monster Mash without even participating, by the way. I was in the Glassed Cave when the achievement unlocked üòõ
---
level 85 myself on console.
---
The pvp side of things I wouldn't worry so much about this sub seems to exagerate it a bit i think personally. In 85 levels and countless hours helping a couple of friends play / get into the game I've been attacked once by another player when i was around level 20. He couldn't kill me as i didn't fight back and after a few minutes he ran off to bother someone else.
---
Yes it does happen however Worse case scenario you can just switch servers if it does become an issue.
---
People love to moan about the pvp but in all honesty i reckon anyone serious about pvp has already got fed up of fighting people that don't fight back and are back playing fortnite or whatever else it is this month :)
---
As for loosing progress through pvp no you wont, at worst you'll loose whatever junk your carrying at the time of death...with the stash and weight micro management game people have to play though it really shouldn't be something that puts you off trying / enjoying 76 because as a fall out fan your sure to enjoy your time in the wasteland!
---
Mod support for pc im not sure, i know they were aiming at late 2019 for the private servers etc and pretty sure I read that it would be around the same time as full support for mods etc but someone else prob has more info on that than me.
---
Not sure on hours so far but I'm easily at 100 hours, got the 76 hours achievement / challenge a few days ago and can easily see me playing for another 100 at least.  Over Xmas PSN emailed us here in UK offering us a video about our gamer tags and it showed top played games etc and F04 was my 2nd most played game with 550ish hours just for context.
---
This. I still have my welcome mat from the Beta and use it in my camp.
---
If you have the keycards and with respect to the cooldowns, I don't see why not. Now, i don't know for certain whether another player's launch will put the entire silo on CD or if it will just put them on a CD.
---
Are you ok?  Just curious, I have been playing way to much lately, and the last few days I have had one disconnect, and one lock up.
---
Did you take any pictures? Video?
---
I believe you're on the right track. The system seems to try to consolidate players to certain servers. I'd assume this is to minimize the number of active servers in the AWS cloud [which is expensive].
---
Me and my wife ended up as the last two players in a server and were alone for a while. Then we both mysteriously disconnected with no warning. 
---
And now you look like a know it all weeny. Are you the kid from Polar Express? Cause that's the voice I'm hearing when your reading your post.
---
My jab was at the fact that the game sorta dies once you get a TSE, so many critters die in one hit and like a lot of people it becomes the only weapon they use.
---
Ya Melvin.
---
Not a secret area. Go around behind SG and there is a door.
---
Especially laser weapons.
---
Sadly, heavy weapons and automatics are in the same boat. Sure you can do a lot of damage with heavies but the 50 cal and plasma gatling break way to fast even with 200% condition and gunsmith. Likewise automatics just dont do enough damage period and likely have the same breakage issue.
---
I did. I can post once I get them off my PS4. The above the ceiling area looked pretty weird.
---
I wish we had the ability to name all customizable items such as weapons and armor. Obviously this would be open to abuse with profanity and bigotry but it would be cool send one of your weapons into the wild and maybe see it again at a later date. In a way we would be able to make our own legendary weapons with stories around them
---
Ah gotcha, thanks!
---
Idk I'm not current with the market 
---
How I pick which card is shared?
---
You asked a question, I answered it. That's why.
---
My apologies, who are you again? 
---
Please forgive my memory but it has this habit of remembering significant people. 
---
I seem to have forgotten about you. 
---
In reverse order: I've been playing since the initial beta was launched. Progress is saved automatically for the most part. Most quest lines will rest if you exit the game for whatever reason but items, levels, etc. will remain as you left them. Unfortunately, players have the opportunity to attack anything and everything. They can't do much unless you engage them. The pvp elements are a bit odd and take some time to get used to but overall, I believe that they are the best that can be done while still being true to the game. As far as I'm aware, expansions have yet to be announced let alone given a specific time/date. I haven't been able to compare the Xbox and pc versions but I imagine it's based on the rig you're running.
---
Thats because a player had sold theirs at the store you were at. Its not offered, but being a quest reward, its not too rare either
---
I only have one friend that would maybe play it, and he plays on xbox, so that may be it. Do you know if you can play without being attacked or forced into pvp, or if progress is lost \[besides crashes or bugs\] due to the latter and being killed when you weren't trying to fight another real player?
---
It's a rare treat but when ever I have em over, they leave the place a wreck. I'll have to bring them by sometime if I see your light on. 
---
Right? Real posts flooded out by the same constant rants. Shits old.
---
I think i have one.  Not sure until i get out of work. 
---
Happened to me a couple of times.  
---
&gt; with a TSE Dragon
---
What a fucking stupid question :/
---
That‚Äôs where I was ambushed by one too
---
I haven't purchased them but could you let us know what platform you're on so people can confirm if its on others as well
---
The balance sections, specifically the tight rope over the water. The other balance beams I was able to get if I took my time but I always seem to fall off the rope and it just eats up the time.
---
Ironically enough though, I just completed it with a lucky perfect run, so I guess it's all good now.
---
Ok I will take a look at that when I get online later. Thanks.
---
Xbox 
---
Have you found the Trumpet up the Bean Stalk yet?
---
Do me do me mcroy88 (ps4)
---
Combine the magic of armor/DR and it‚Äôs hard to summarize something like time to kill or effective DPS.  Really need to just use the weapon and see how it works for you
---
I also did this to someone who was a little past level 50. It‚Äôs a little strange that my rifle can one shot wanted people without them even knowing I‚Äôm there. 
---
If you go the normal way you need to grab the key from the back of the server room
---
Make it big so I don‚Äôt get stuck 
---
Chiseledhen860. I have a mic too
---
Shit, I hadn't thought about that.
---
The pyrolizer's perk is just suppressor's, you can get that on many other weapons. I have a suppressor's cryolator on me right now
---
Also, draining vendors of caps is already easy. You can craft marine tactical masks to sell for 20+ caps each and it only uses one plastic, one glass, and three rubber to make one.
---
I don‚Äôt remember it doing that but ok 
---
Same here. I want to hear the footsteps of the enemy. I don't need "He's hackin' and wackin' and smackin'" constantly in my hear.
---
I second this, I'm also looking for friendly people to discord with
---
Most likely February 22.
---
I cleared the aggro this way.
---
Lack of better endgame content. Theres nothing for me to strive for. In all honesty, the only things I'm looking forward to, is more DLC, events, and power armor skins in the atom shop. 
---
Kind of resorted to doing daily and weekly challenges just so I dont have to pay for Atom Shop things 
---
Honestly this is almost any explosive weapon in pvp. 
---
Thanks. Have you recently lost a lot of progress to bugs, and would you say it has improved since you first started? And by grifers do you mean players who start attacking you, trying to get you to attack and initiate a pvp encounter?
---
Check a YT vid for concise info you can watch in real time.
---
"Merry Christmas ya filthy animal"
---
I'm on the naughty ps4 list.
---
EVERYTHING that is TSE is OP 
---
I have found the game is lagging when walking over the last two days. It moves smoothly when running but not walking. 
---
no
---
Where do I fill out this ticket i only recently heard of it
---
Never drink before an obstacle course run
---
There should be a map somewhere on here with the stealthboy locations
---
If they are flagged for PvP how do they not know you are there? Btw. An explosive shotgun can do the same from rifle distances. Pretty much any explosive can.
---
I turn them all on üòÖ 
---
I found out that it was a problem with my graphics driver. I thought that they were updated buuut actually they were not...shame on me I guess lol I should have checked them before 
---
the only energy weapon i've felt satisfied with is the plasma flamer.
---
You can be killed by another player if they feel like hurting you. Weapons will deal limited damage until both players attack one another, however, and they'll also become Wanted if the griefing persists. There is a Pacifist Mode, which I don't quite understand because other players can still kill you while it is active. In my experience (PC, ~100 hours), this is the exception more than the rule. I think I've been actively attacked by other players 3 separate times during my play time in 76.  
---
As far as losing progress, I've been disconnected from the server while attempting to retrieve dropped loot after death (you drop all of your Junk from your inventory when you die). This has happened twice; I try to keep all my Junk stored in the Stash Box, but it only holds so much (and I'm terrible at inventory management).  
---
I can't speak for mod availability, or PC vs console. I can say, however, that the game is enjoyable, even with its flaws. I liked FO4, and 76 feels a lot like that to me. Ignore the folks who say that FO76 sucks; they're wrong. It is buggy, and it has its issues, but it's a lot of fun.
---
Might be! Would still feel tricked as a full price customer after such a short time.
---
I did as well, and I've talked to others who've done the same. There were channels that I've followed for years because I trusted/valued their opinions on games. Sometimes to see if a game was something I'd like before I bought it and sometimes just to see what they had to say about it. When it came down to FO76 though I noticed that most of these people were jumping on the hate bandwagon instead of doing an actual review which disappointed me so much.
---
One channel in particular I watched because they always complained that AAA games were basically "Interactive movies" and that games these days weren't being made with immersive worlds/background storytelling. When he got around to FO76 he said "The story doesn't count if I have to read it". As it turned out, for all the complaining he did about games spoon feeding you the story, that's exactly what he came to want from them.
---
I got more than my money's worth and I get free stuff in their store just playing the game. I'm not pissed in any way so long as they fix the bigger big issues in the game. 
---
Also I don't care for people trying to fear monger that this game might go F2P even if unintentional. One thing we don't need is more drama. The YouTube stars and inaccurate stories about the game have that covered. 
---
The way I see it, they are making enough from the *COSMETICS* store to sell the core game for less. Is this true? I don't know nor care as long as they fully support the game for years. Support stops I won't buy another Bethesda game ever again.
---
Just check the game files, good catch, damage modified is "secondary", with secondary being 1.00 points, so increasing secondary damage means 0.5 added damage
---
I didnt fully read it at first, saw you said Whitesprings, realized I was wrong. No idea how to help, never heard of the robots attacking without something being done to them first. Unless your teammate attacked them.
---
Traps? Wouldn't it only effect people who travel to your camp? Would be a bummer if the item was removed because people were just trolling their friends lol. 
---
Make sure you‚Äôre charging each shot.

I dislike thegauss rifle for this reason

have the same problem, got the same cpu with a 770 tho d:. on windows 7 also.

The shuffle is kinda borked. I had it play one song, something different, then the first one again on three separate occasions. It at least needs to go through the whole library once before repeating, IMO.

I will probably move on when some new game catches my attention. FO76 has it for now. I still have stuff to do and I still like it, even though I also don't like a lot of things about it.

Hells yea!!!

Long range rifle + stealth boy + not being able to see players when wanted

It‚Äôs pretty easy to sneak up on people

Not sure if "reading opinions" is going to be the main reason. Like I've been watching so many videos and streams of people that actually enjoyed the game - just so I can find enough reasons to buy it. But it never seemed worth the price. Now I'm scared because of the low price regarding how long the game will be supported/developed.
---
Yeah, it made me look twice making sure my eyes aren't deceiving me. 
---
Couldn't tell you :/ 
---
Fits well with your username yeah? I love it because I've picked up an explosive tommy, feels good haha.
---
You did not kill any level 200 players.  You got killed by said players and are now hear begging people to retaliate.
---
Ah. Didn't realize they were wanted. I don't bother with most wanted people these days since fast travel costs more than the dumb bounties give.
---
I haven't played in over a month, but I still check the sub periodically for news.  Maybe I'll pick it up again someday down the road.
---
If they are showing 0 caps sell a low value item. Sometimes it's just a visual glitch. 
---
You must be new to gaming...
---
Bethesda support. Log in to your account and there should be an option to inquire about a replacement bag.
---
I have one of those heads, but haven't used it yet; now I don't think I want too. What exactly is the bug with it?
---
    Except that show isint journalism. It's an opinion one based on the experiences the panel had while playing those games. They also had RDR2 in top 3 of most disappointing about half the people had not finished the story and as someone who has I noticed several things said that wasn't true if you played through it.
---
 But you can't blame them because if a game puts you off so much in the first few hours you don't wish to continue thats just subjective opinion. Don't get opinion pieces and reports confused they are very different.
---
My camp is a basic setup &amp; I try to place it in a convenient spot for the current quests I am on. Depending on build I try to put it near resources - current one is on a lead vein near munitions factory. Nothing is locked so if anyone finds it or I control the munitions factory people can help themselves as I don't  always get back to collect at the end of my gameplay.

thats how you do it.  THANK YOU.  1.4k caps per day just from vending here I COME.
---
I've had a 10 cap bounty twice. Both times was from accidentally hitting another player's turret while being attacked by some horde of something. Barely left a scratch on the others players bar and now you're calling for an airstrike on my humble home? 
---
For shame!

Probably the same with more digits.  Although, a portrait should be implemented whenever you reach a hundred levels like D3.

I got a glitch bounty from taking something from some random container, not part of a base or anything. Stashed my junk and ran around the golf course during a nuke and loot. Someone finally delivered sweet mercy. 
---
Go to the abandoned mine shaft 5, slightly right of Camden park in Ash Heap. There's a metal shack straight in front of you when spawning there, and just a few feet past it is a cliff with stairs winding down it. Along that cliff near the stairs are 4 iron ore deposit nodes that are all very close to each other. Get like 44-56 iron ore with Excavator armor arms that give you more ore when mining. Do that twice, and you get a few hundred steel. Best part is that there's a chemistry bench in that metal shack.
---
Someone else did, the glowing and bloated ones inside was nice. Lota loot like the whitesprings. But they never respawned
---
‚ÄúOpe‚Äù
---
I agree, way to litte in 76. 
---
Nee
---
Turn off your mods
---
That wasn't even to you. Or was it? Lmao
---
If you're done throwing out weak ass IQ insults or asking me about energy weapons (they fucking suck why tf would anyone use them), we can return to your impossible request: You want the meta to change. You want regular armor to be as strong/resistant as PA and have legendary affixes, which, contrary to what you said before, makes a HUGE difference. 
---
I have 3 zealot pieces (-45% scorched dmg) and I can take on 2 scorchbeasts and their horde on a character with 2 endurance. 4 of my pieces have ap refresh, which is at least twice as powerful as action boy. You with me, bud?
---
IF they were to up the rad resistance of the armor mods, they would need to add legendary affixes to power armor OR ELSE IT ISN'T BALANCED. It doesn't fucking matter if it came out of the SBQ's gooch, it would be unbalanced if regular armor were as strong AND had the affixes. END OF STORY.
---
I never ONCE defended the broken system, only reminded you that it exists and that begging Todd or whoever the fuck to fix it, ain't gonna do jack shit. So either deal with the broken system, or bitch about it and get into dumbass reddit arguments over it. 
---
Up to you, mate. 
---
dont then.  I'm just saying, read their description of the game.
---
And who cares how long they support it if its about the low price.  You got a deal for what others paid more for, even if they called you up after installing and said "Hi sir, no more updates."  You still got everything they offered for $17.  
---
You're in a low risk position.  
---
It sounds like you don't want to play this game, but you want a deal.  I'd say go to dollar store, buy up all the chocolate bars.  Better deal with visible timeframe.
---
Probably can't be bothered to deal with clipping issues
---
Sadly it took me 14 attempts to complete over 2 days due to disconnections. I gave up at some point til I had to return when I realized the quest was needed for progression. Eventually I got it though. Best of luck to you!
---
I would interpret this as the opposite. 
---
Nah this was a few weeks ago but theres probably more than a few people who use those spots
---
 I'll take that bet. 
---
Nothing more frustrating than running conduit or placing walls on or around the stairs with the grating. 
---
"Object is floating" can eat a dick. 
---
It's a laggy mess and crashes half of the time.
---
Ugh this game.
---
You're a wanted man. You have the death penalty on twelve systems.
---
Man thanks! Someone's #1, feels good haha. 
---
PC, yeah! Which walls specifically? the ones into the dirt? if your tiles don't automatically clip on through like a majority of mine did, you can always do a floor overhang then build walls down from that. Walls down from second floors are a lot more willing to clip.
---
Let's see. How many years is it till Starfield comes out?
---
It's funny you had this issue too because I had a poster that was barely in the way and caused me a lot of frustration with that wall conduit.
---
Can you nuke Valut 76? I want to see the new player comes out and go, "Hell No, let me back in!"
---
AFAIK, they‚Äôre totally immune to radiation. 
---
My, yer a bit of a fucking knob, ain't ya?
---
I paid $70AUD on release day - cheapest I could find. I have gotten my monies worth doing 160+ hours on 2 builds. I get crazy lag at times &amp; random disconnects but nothing that has completely stopped me from enjoying the game.
---
When did you get a response? I also submitted mine a few hours after they tweeted about it. Still no response
---
One time someone followed me to my base because I had a bounty. For some reason my turrets turned on me. Picking them up and placing them back down wouldn't fix them.
---
&gt; Before I bought the game, I was under the impression that anywhere you nuked would spawn a bunch of high levels and a couple of legendaries; I really wish it was this way.
---
I thought that, too. I also thought you could continue to nuke the same area to make it harder and harder with every nuke. 
---
I expect 4 and 5 star items will be down the road and I hope they do add more challenging content. There really isn't anything you can't solo besides the Queen after level 50.
---
I love that she has a sweet roll and tea.
---
I do queens all day everyday i get a crash every like 4th or 5th queen, oh well shit happens just get on and do it again. Me and my squad drop her in 2 mins
---
No worries, threw the comment on here in the hoeps that it would be a helpful reminder (and not just dickish snark, though sorta still a little bit of that too)
---
Why use a grenade when you can use a nuke 
---
Please, nobody takes ToS seriously; not even the companies. They only exist to give companies just that extra bit of legal edge in case a user would sue as a result of them being banned from their service for whatever reason where they can then point to them inevitably being in violation of that ToS which uses the broadest, catch-all language they can possibly get away with.
---
Played a bunch on New Years day I crashed or DC'd about half dozen times over about 6 hours including one full one Blue Screen. We also had a couple servers go bad so we had to hop. Stability feels worse than at launch. We have lost items, quest progress, time, and sanity to bugs and crashes. 
---
Griefers is a kind of a catch all to cover harassment, trolling, etc. We generally don't use area chat so that eliminates a bunch of issues. I tend to run in pacifist because we like running events and too often I've "initiated pvp" with no intention of pvp'ing and the bounty system is just annoying and getting someone to kill me to set me free is a slog. Griefing can run the gamut from trashing your base, trying to glitch you, following you around and just generally being annoying. It's easy enough to hop servers if someone is being an asshat but we have not run into any of the horror stories that have been posted or that are typical to multiplayer survival games. Honestly, the opposite is mostly true... the servers feel empty with 24 players and unless you are gravitating to events or nuke sites you'll hardly run into anyone once you are past the early quests.
---
i was ducking around on reddit on my computer and i was being attacked by other players. smh. it was an invitation to come in not destroy my stuff. 
---
Online yes, played Eve Online while back and knew that this was prevalent with character and ISK selling, just didn't know it was rife Fallout 76. 
---
So it's just something to put up with then? Oh well.
---
It's 2019, and we still can't have this. Stupid. 
---
Yep hate this this, we had about 5minutes left the other day and the server crashed. All that time wasted üò¢
---
&gt;csgo?
---
Don't even know what that means.
---
I live in a 2x1 metal box that has every workstation inside and a bed/muic chair... I demand to see your ‚Äúminimalism‚Äù!
---
Welcome to the Internet!
---
I‚Äôm guessing I could‚Äôve done the same solo with what I have since she scales with amount of people, but the whole server just kinda showed up lol
---
The first Mothman I encountered was when I was very low level.  It just sat and did nothing while I poured nearly every round of ammo I had into him and finally killed him.
---
About 20 levels later I saw one and fired one round before he sort of evaporated on me, never to return.
---
Since then my experiences with them have been pretty normal, but the first two encounters left me thinking WTF??
---
Maybe go a bit further with this A. I. 
---
Like have it make robo versions of standard enemies. Robo-deathclaws, robo- sbq

@_@

And make them bad 80's sci-fi. Like Far Cry's blood dragon expansion. (Never had the opportunity to play it though).

Luls. Looks like little Billy is showing how stupid he looks. Regular Armor is balanced by the fact that it's 100x harder to get a 3* perfect roll. If using end game drops in end game triggers you so hard, perhaps you should find some other buggy and unfinished shitfest of a game instead of crying to those asking to improve it?
---
That's my impression as well. Hopefully they'll take a look at it someday.
---
Hell yeah, I know what I'm going to do for the back door now. Now I just have to track is elusive ass down.

Graphics are all client side and have nothing to do with anything.

New to gaming? Ever heard of Ultima? D2? Everquest? The list is massive. Christ look at the WoW battle pet/mount market. If you can sell it, someone with an expendable income or lack of play time will buy. This will never change.
---
Time to get out more. 
---
What platform are you on? I picked up a lvl 50 instigating power fist yesterday. I won‚Äôt use it because I have a rifle build, but I cant bring myself to dump it.

For whatever reason this hairstyle just doesn't have any previews

I think I found the problem if there is a source of water that splashes and the splash hits where you would be building it acts like it's in water. 
---
A lot of the map is wrong. Beckely is on the opposite side of the map. Summersville is not that close to Charleston. I could list lots of problems.
---
Can't get Bloodied &amp; Vampire either.

Accidentally shoot someone and then convey a message that is basically interpreted as ‚Äú...and not only that, but I‚Äômm‚Äôa also tea bag you fuckface!‚Äù
---
I'm beginning to think that TSE weapons are a myth.
---
Is this a Bethesda alt, or are you really this dense? Most games have bugs, but most game dev's don't release a Beta and charge loads of cash for it.
---
The more this game becomes like diablo 2, the more I like it.
---
It‚Äôs almost a sense of nostalgia for me. This was always just a part of the game for D2.
---
You could farm your own stuff or buy it.
---
So it IS a criminal enterprise then, selling in game items for $$ or real life crime, what a choice.
---
Aren't you clever~

I would say 4k total

You also get defensive walls.

December 19th.  Also consider their staff is likely just coming back from holidays and they probably still have staff out, responses may have stopped coming out at some time prior to the holidays and would just recently be restarting.
---
Welcome to the Wasteland. 
---
I can call myself lucky then. Done on the first try, clocked myself at about 17 minutes.
---
Kinda disappointingly easy to be honest lol
---
Also, shame you don't get to see the id card with the photo (at least I can't figure out a way to look at it...)
---
I assume you are using mods? As of the December 4th patch, Bethesda has been using sResourceArchive2List for Atom Shop stuff. You need to add the bolded text before your mods in the Fallout76Custom.ini:  
---
\[Archive\]
---
sResourceArchive2List = **SeventySix - ATX\_Main.ba2, SeventySix - ATX\_Textures.ba2,** (your mods)
---
This is awesome, its what I enjoy, meeting some random people and becoming friends. I like helping others out too and can see doing that as I continue to lvl up myself.

I‚Äôd like to nominate u/TuckTheBlack0

Try it with a Mele weapon in a group of people.
---
House of a Thousand Corpses pops into my head

Harmonica would fit right in too :) 
---
Although fast travel costs are slowly bankrupting me xD
---
I'd love to join your friendly discord channel for fo76! Finding friendly people to play this game with is becoming...tedious for me. Would love to have regular people to learn from or play with!
---
I used to have mods but I got rid of them because I though that was the problem. I'll take another look.
---
Oi true that.
---
Wanna tell me why I can have higher numerical rad resist in my regular armor with drugs than I can get in my hazmat suit but I take 10x more damage rads?
---
Why bother having that number at all? It's meaningless.
---
Sorry i‚Äôm literally falling asleep with a joystick in my hands, hit me up tomorrow i‚Äôm gonna pull an all nighter! :) 
---
I just solved this issue by moving it away from the wall. It seems that this is an issue only if the back of your power armor station is close to a wall. It works but it looks dumb in the middle of the room -_- 
---
Please DM or post to us an image of a CAMP you feel shows your skill level. The HOA brings only the most judgemental people on board. [https://twitter.com/HoaWasteland](https://twitter.com/HoaWasteland)

:)
---
Abandoned Bog Town workshop has 3 concrete resource spots, leaving that up for an hour will give you a decent supply. I think you can also find a bunch of concrete bags to loot in the town, as well. 
---
Press triangle on the perk you want to share while in your perks page. (For ps4)
---
I shot my first MIRV, inside of a building..... big mistake.
---
ok then please tell me when you know it
---
Some people just have a limited view on what constitutes a raider. My raider RP consists of charging a toll to pass through my camp, crafting chems hopefully to vendor at some point, and just generally having fun whilst others do the hard work.
---
Chaotic neutral - might save your life, might steal your workshop
---
Translation: I have no interest in playing in a way that isn't annoying AF to everyone else around me.
---
I play solo and all I do is take off some damage perks so I don't one shot everything. It's not hard to not be toxic. 
---
I made an alt and that‚Äôs been fun.  I‚Äôve stopped investing in workshops beyond the first defense.  I don‚Äôt try to drop nukes and just wait for others to drop them, or lately avoid nuke areas entirely. 
---
Nice walls, I guess if you need that sort of thing.
---
my WALL supports my entire "top floor"
---
My whole "house" is 4 tiles and a stair set.
---
I have a cow, three crops and my water purifiers/gennys.  
---
Also the crafting stations except for PA, cuz I don't need PA, minimal!
---
4 Turrets, cuz 5 was more than I needed.
---
You have a chair?!?!  Can't you just lie down or stand, why do we need three options?
---
whats your username?
---
Best way to use the mirv isn't to aim where the target is, but up in the air above them, after a set travel time the mirv will 'pop' and rain down it's nukes over the spots it's at
---
It depends on what level you are. I seem to slow down a lot in the 30's because of maintenance of my ammo/gun/armour. Why does it seem easier to just remake leather armour then to fix it? Is there a trick to farming ballistic weave I don't know? Seems like being able to pick up a pattern to make it would solve this issue. (Make it cost cloth+adhesive I guess? I don't even bother picking up pre-war money because cloth is useless.)
---
Imagine coding an entire hit box to account for "sea foam spray" lolz
---
Still can't use power armour without glitching the fug out though.
---
still nope
---
It's a crapshoot. I would get the quest that takes you through this area (Rose and the Raiders). Some areas are safe but some aren't as safe until you are higher level. 
---
Work as a team to re-build Liberty Prime so it can fight Liberator Prime. While the primes fight each other, players can capture points (generators, or turrets) to weaken or strengthen the corresponding prime. 
---
It would be something that needs to be taken into account, maybe a custom 'squeeze through the doorway' animation, as physically they should be able to get through by contorting themselves through it some, much like watching a guy like Shaq try to crawl in/out a normal 4 door sedan
---
The build will work well, if you are wanting to kill the scorch beast queen I would recommend a bloodied build.
---
It's impossible to kill a guy in full x01 armour with a shotgun that OHKs you
---
You use the orbital strike like any other grenade. After a few seconds an explosion come down from the sky. The other one scans enemies or something. 
---
We founded the Wasteland Estates HOA on many of the foundations that made up the Happy Home Academy. Biggest difference, we pay in caps, not bells. :)
---
20 hours for them to respawn, so yes. That‚Äôs completely natural.
---
I had a great experience like this today too!  I was wandering around the Wixon homestead (I'm level 20 but was just chilling - I was actually looking for a low level weapon for a L1 who had just come out of the vault).  
---
A guy in power armour came around the corner and made me jump so I accidentally shot him, but I have pacifist mode on and I hearted him so it was OK.  My camp was near Deathclaw island and he helped me kill it and gave me all the loot :) 
---
Thank you :) 
---
You may actually be more critical than we're looking for. :)
---
How do you track their base?
---
I mean, yes, but it's not news.
---
Pretty much any TSE gun can do equivalent.
---
Dragon is one of the strongest single shot guns in the game. Of course it'll do this.
---
Yeah I ‚Äúbreached‚Äù a wanted players base with my 2se shotgun (I blew off all the walls on one side when I only meant to do the door) and killed him. 
---
Strike is a missile strike, and the other one just scans the area and idk wtf it's supposed to do. Seemingly nothing
---
Hmmm, if you aren't Brohead, why did you edit the last sentence of the post I called you out on to remove the bold that made it seem like you *were* Brohead? 
---
&gt; The meta is PA because of this specific issue. It's a small portion using Regular Armor because of THIS issue. Radiation resist not working is STUPID. (Defending it is not intelligent.)
---
You removed the bold like a little bitch. Ahahahahaha. You're such a fucking loser!!!
---
Life's hard when you try to bring some order and logic in whatever the fuck Bethesda created.
---
For sure.  More than once I‚Äôve gone to contest the ammo dump but saw they were low level and server hopped instead.  Same to leaving the easy workshops alone.  Gotta let new players have fun and find pvp on their own IMO
---
You do Face McShooty proud
---
Same. I'll do what I want to start but then I'll scope out the map and see whose around and just go say hi, and give out free water/food/stimpacks
---
Unless they are actively reading it to launch the nuke, no one will remember the code just reading it in the feed.
---
I appreciate the advice, but I‚Äôm not new, I‚Äôm over level 100. 
---
I‚Äôve got several 3* legendary items I want to hang on to until they add player vending, so there just isn‚Äôt space for those marginal/chaff items. 
---
Counter Strike Go...I don't know much about it but I know there's like, guns that sell for $200 USD for some reason.
---
A good tse lever gun will cost around 5k. Combat rifle may be more.
---
He is still right tho, shame this game started with all the duping, economy is very important for an online game for me and friends.
---
I'll try that. thanks.
---
Gothca. Thanks
---
There have been times where I feel like I could of used this emote. Shooting someone by accident.  What can I say, I have a twitchy trigger finger. 
---
basically depends on whos in the area. if your lvl 20 encounter lvl 20ish enemys if a lvl 90 wanders by you then guess what bam lvl 65s doesnt matter if your in a party or not
---
Lucky Hole Mine. You will see a god. 
---
Yeah craft
---
Yeah, that‚Äôs one big weak spot for the atomic store. If my characters where more attractive I‚Äôd probably want to dress them up more.
---
When I played saints row 3 I spent a good hour getting my character perfect, with fallout I just pick a default, change the hair, and that‚Äôs about it
---
&gt;"wont swing" bug
---
Glad knowing it's not just me doing something daft. Thanks.
---
Thanks! So over all you'd suggest storing into your player bank whatever loot you don't want to risk losing before entering an area with a lot of players? And of course I'll assume this is when only when you turn off pacifist mode.
---
Also, if you do leave the non-pvp aspect for a while, what happens when friendly fire hits you or a friend, nothing I suppose? And last but not least, the player bank, is it sort of like where you would stash items at your base/s on FO4, or is it an actually dedicated out of game storage sort of thing?
---
Say it isn't so.
---
yeah I get the feeling a lot of them forget a large amount of this community knows tech concepts and are long time gamers
---
That last sentence gave me Oregon trail flashbacks
---
Poseidon energy has a concrete resource spawn also
---
The 30s slow down a good bit because you're busy dealing with the woes you describe. There's an AGI perk called White Knight that will, at full level, knock the ballistic fiber need down to 1 per repair instead. Worth grabbing at some point for sure, but I think it's available in the 40's so you have a little ways to go.
---
Camp McClintock has ballistic fiber. If you're at Fort Defiance, do enough of that quest to get to the higher floors and you will be rolling in it. There's also numerous BoS camps in the bog that have ballistic fiber, but I wouldn't suggest going there at your level just yet!
---
Added you on PSN :) I'm hobbesdream there too
---
Ok....
---
They do move in herds
---
I have a foundation house aka 1 foundation then ladders upto the real house, does this automatically detract points?
---
NewtGingrinch  I wont be on til later tonight. 
---
I have the radial set up but I'm not very adapt and using it fast in game, I'll have to practice.
---
Gratz!!
---
No one, he dreamed it up.
---
I don‚Äôt understand why people are paying cash when there‚Äôs a market in caps here on Reddit.
---
Nope. Just people making money however they can. Maybe some do work for Bethesda but it's likely super discouraged if not against company policy for employees to make money like that.
---
A friend of a friend bought a car with the money from selling their World of Warcraft character back in the day.
---
Loses debate, goes back to old goal-post move that he also lost on.
---
You forgot your tin-foil hat, billy. Lets talk about radiation resist mathematically being broken in FO76, unlike FO4.
---
They had long hair mods in FO4 and they worked pretty well. The dresses already clip quite a bit!
---
I think you'll find things are a bit... looser... in these post-apocalyptic days.  
---
Still, everyone has exactly 2 weeks to take down ALL Christmas decor. TIA - WEHA
---
If it works like F4 it might still be good against mutants.
---
http://fallout.wikia.com/wiki/Radiation#Fallout_4
---
"the game distinguishes between radiation immunity (present on e.g. Super mutants) and resistance (present in high quantities on e.g. Feral ghouls). This is important because some weapons do pure radiation damage that ignores radiation immunity; they are still, however, affected by radiation resistance, so these weapons will ironically do more damage to an "immune" target than one with high resistances. "
---
Although I'm not sure if radium rifle has that type of damage. It looks like the gamma gun does though.
---
When i picked up the Overseer's Log the mission just went blank so i have no clue what to do now there is nothing on the map even though the mission is selected
---
PSA: You can also bulk and scrap Acid repeatedly for sale, until you get recipes like this.
---
10 Acid+2 Plastic=1 Bulk Acid
---
1 Bulk Acid=15 Acid.
---
So you can basically turn 2 Plastic in 5 Acid repeatedly, and bulk acid sells pretty well.
---
Just saying. That house is located way to close to the path. 
---
And OP will probably want to get rank 3 of Hard Bargain to min/max caps and lower the cost of the plans.
---
No worries, let me know if it doesn't show up.
---
Thank you for the response and information! 
---
When you say bloodied do you mean swap out for bloody mess or do you have a whole build I can look at or lookup? 
---
It's also the holiday season which means there is a much larger que of things than normal, doubly so with the 'flood' of negativity about the game in general from the echo chambers and influencers that it wouldn't suprise me if false reports are also being posted which further bog the system (as feed back is also done in the support system for some reason)
---
&gt; Oh well someone didn't get a full set of plans to make T-60.
---
I'd kill for T-60 plans lol.
---
Only 5k? I already get 6k on bank so that'd be good news. Ive seen some people pay 15k and up tho for a LAR lol 
---
1k for most, 2-4k for higher end stuff.
---
Wait til you SEE them and then get back to me. I'll be waiting to hear from you. 
---
Ive seen it too! I called it the phased ghoul
---
hehe, i risked it for the reveal :D
---
damn 20 pounds, that must've been a hell of a lot of recipes
---
you tried^(?)
---
umm she doesnt scale......... she has 35000 hp 
---
Ok. Thanks
---
&gt; Another lets you see the enemy resistances. 
---
However, it's pretty useless tbh. Even if something is weaker to laser, you're better off just using ballistic anyway. 
---
&gt;People love to moan about the pvp but in all honesty i reckon anyone serious about pvp has already got fed up of fighting people that don't fight back and are back playing fortnite or whatever else it is this month :)
---
I think this is a big factor. The PVP system was terrible and combat mechanics aren't satisfying to anyone who really likes twitchy PVP games. Fallout has never had great combat mechanics and feels bad man face smashing unengaged enemies can only entertain even the most "hardcore" for so long.
---
It does ballistic and radiation so the ballistic damage still would count against them. On my character the ballistic is higher than the radiation damage.
---
I allways find my character is having a bath in the irradiated pond as soon as she gets home. She does stink like a super mutant though. 
---
Bruh, how long you gonna pretend, huh? Lmaooooo
---
Mine's probably not the most efficient, but I dumped 11 points into Intelligence. That way, I could also equip max level Power Patcher (power armor breaks 60% more slowly and is cheaper to repair) in addition to Makeshift Warrior and First Aid. I think I had lower (like 4) Perception since I don't use guns a whole lot and lower charisma since I play solo and don't team up a whole lot.
---
There's quite a few in the monorail car at the Spruce Knoll building. Bunch of dead soldiers with bags. That's all I've found so far.
---
You pathetic little bitch! Ahahahahahahahaha
---
Or they were wanted who did you kill lol. 
---
I bought mine for 3k. Just depends on who is selling. Lately I‚Äôve seen them for 5k on the fo76 bazaar
---
I swear half the people here are on the edge of their seats while reading comments hovering over the downvote button until they've heard enough to decide whether you're advocating for "their team", or "the *evil* other team".
---
Wv lumber Co is a good spot at a lower level, top left of the map. Kill the lvl 5-10  supermutant for .308 and the xp.
---
https://youtu.be/L4FP1vFKyo4 heres my camp. I normally build near rivers and roads...:')
---
Righteous? No. But I don't care if it was an accident, if you have a bounty and you're near me I'mma claim it. I just think it's unreal how many pansies there are playing this game
---
I don't have it but I would like to use it out of curiosity. Maybe you can even see other players resistances. I don't know.
---
It used to be whenever someone entered the area, but not it only spawns by itself every 10 or so minutes, 3 times, then stops. And that‚Äôs the entire Whitespring area. Usually people will start leaving after the 3 spawns. 
---
Does double nuking increase the flux spawns?
---
You forget PA Edition was a limited run item, so to replace the helmet they have to order a new one and get it in, QA check it to ensure it's fine since it's a replacement for a damaged/broken one, send the new one, and hope the broken one gets sent back, assuming they didn't require the broken one to be sent back first (which most companies require) which means due to time of year there's likely going to be delays on the shipping side of things
---
Sorting to pure personal attack posts. Oof, losing debates doesn't sit well with little billy.
---
Bloodied build uses Bloodied Weapon + Nerd Rage + mutations + potentially radicool, runs at 20% ish HP.
---
It is its own build
---
Love this idea. Commenting to make the thread look important.
---
I've got a [screenshot](https://xboxdvr.com/gamer/wild-smurf-14/screenshot/11200043) as well as a [clip](https://xboxdvr.com/gamer/wild-smurf-14/video/66586726). 
---
I did miss a bit on the ghoul and was smacked around a lot by the deathclaw, but it still killed pretty quick. To be fair, my Two-Shot Combat Rifle *does* out damage it by a bit, but if RNGesus hasn't blessed you with good legendaries, the plasma thrower isn't a bad go-to for tougher enemies. 
---
Can confirm, diluted radaways do in-fact remove mutations.  Only a slightly less of a chance to do so.  I only use diluted everything and I finally got healing factor, put on starched genes, used a few diluted to recoup my rads, waited for the red bar to stop moving.... un-equipped starched to try to obtain another mutation and apparently still under the effect of the diluted and lost healing factor.
---
Hold on, let me block you so your bitch ass has to get back on brohead, l aoooooo
---
Nice! So, let's say you turned the pacifist mode on to avoid pvp until you're ready/feeling it. You said being attacked doesn't damage you \[besides the annoyance\] unless you decide to fire back at which point I'll assume you're switched to pvp on. I think that's how Warcraft was. That seems fair since you wouldn't be pushed into a situation you didn't want to be in yourself.
---
As for mods, at the very least since it seems it might be only through the bethesda . net, there's a chance both console and pc will enjoy the same amount and quality of mods. Last but not least, do you see the crashes as often recently as in the first couple weeks you started playing? Is it more of a minor annoyance now or do you actively have to go out of your way to stash things just in case. Thanks again.
---
Yes! Yes it is. Friend just gave a me a TSE looking forward to using it a White Springs
---
The one reason I don't do exclusively heavy guns is because a lot of them break quickly and many have a "spin up" time that isn't great for faster enemies. I do melee with heavy gun backup.
---
Also be careful if you do Power Armor that uses fusion cores and a gun that does too üòÖ
---
Perks, pharma farma, can do, and the other one
---
May you find your worth in the waking world.
---
In game, but its player specific, so think banking tabs from WOW etc.   Anyone can access that box, but it only opens to your personal bank.
---
As far as losing the loot, you'll drop all your "junk" (crafting materials) in a bag on the ground, no matter how you die.  (any death including: cliff jumping, enemy spawns, PVP)
---
That bag of loot becomes an accessible container anyone can collect, if they do you get notified "another player collected your loot"
---
If you are opted in to pvp and you attack another player or their base, you will become wanted, tagged on the map for all to see the bounty and wont be able to do any quests until your bounty is gone.  If that happens I keep being a shithead so people come kill me.  
---
The wanted restrictions are brutal but ensure no one is a dick by accident more than once.
---
If you opt out, people that hit you will still gain bounties, but their damage is nerfed to the point they cant kill you, regardless of gear/level.  I had a guy hit me while trying to kill mobs, took a bounty, I mercy killed him and returned his stuff so he could keep playing.
---
If you opt back in, on a team, you cant shoot your friend, damage is ignored.   If you opt in and shoot another player by accident, BOUNTY.
---
If you are worried about bounties, just opt out until you're in full PVP mood.
---
10-4. I solo a lot. I see the benefits in INT. For power armor issues etc. I can swap those out I guess when I need to repair. Does it degrade that fast? Just getting into it.. sorry for lame questions.. lol
---
One bug down..how many to go? üòÇ

Have you checked out Emmett Mountain Disposal Site just east of Whitespring Bunker? I was there today and found something nice.
---
My friend, many keys found on sites like that are not acquired by savory/legal/legitimate means.
---
Bethesda is not working with them.
---
Installing Fallout 1 now. Didn't have to log out/in.
---
I think America should do a variant of what Israel does tbh.  Over there due to the danger they are in, every one must serve a minimum of iirc 2 years in the civil defnese force/military thing they have.
---
Here in america, with how much consumeristic(?) it is, every one should be required to work 2 years f2f retail/cs, and 2 years remote cs/retail
---
Lvl 2 is strait up broken: doesn't work at all. I got the third card from a card pack so I upgraded for the hell of it. Lvl 3 with a luck of 10 has kept my weapons in really good shape, and I'm using a 50 cal (HW).
---
I'll keep it slotted for the time being.
---
I think what they are trying to say is, that there are too many around. I have been playing since launch and have yet to get a TSE of any kind, farming both SBQ and WS: Golf club &amp; surrounding area, best I have gotten is a 2-shot 10mm pistol. You have just been extremely lucky getting 2 TSEs so close to another. People would still complain about TSEs being op, but probably not at the current rate they are now...in regards to PvP. 
---
Ah I see, that's unfortunate @ crashes you experienced. And I can see what you mean about the griefers. Someone wanting to troll or be ill willed might resort to destroying your base if they can't damage you or get you to engage in confrontation. I presume/hope fixing your home/base is not too ardous if someone tries to trash for the sake of doing so? And really? only 24 players on your realm? That seems low but perhaps good if you're trying to avoid those situations. I remember there were several realms back in Warcraft and they didn't really list a number other than Medium, High, Full, etc so it was difficult to know how many. I wonder if 24 is an average on these realms, and how many there actually are.
---
There's the uranium fever event it's all mole men. Idk what lvl though I never paid much attention.

Would they fight the Whitespring staff-bots?

Sucks to suck. Look where you're shooting.

What if it was mine? 
---
Now thats an idea, find a container near your base and leave a sign at your base saying to look in the nearby container for free shit
---
Do you have discord or something?
---
All I‚Äôm gonna say is I personally am not in love with this game..I am however in love with what it could be whether that growth comes from Bethesda or modders I don‚Äôt mind because either way my patience will be rewarded for the time being I‚Äôll treat it like any other vanilla Bethesda game and slog away and do everything that I can do till that sweet, sweet mod tidal wave hits.
---
I did too!
---
I live near Hwy 64 in TN, so I was like "oh neat!" when I saw it on the map. Then I realized it doesn't seem to go anywhere, lol.
---
A friend of mine who's got a PS4 says that Sony is apparently notoriously stingy with allowing cross-platform compatibility. Maybe Bethesda figures if not everyone can play together, nobody can.
---
I'm in the same boat :D
---
Me and my girlfriend tried the Bog/Watoga and man...I cant wait to be able to fight Scorched beasts...not just run away.

Progress does not get lost when you die or log out. There is no save function. When you die, any scrap/junk you have on you will drop on the ground as a paper bag and you can go back to try to recover it. You get one stash box to place the scrap/junk in and it will stay there until you need to use it. Several places around the map give you access to the stash box besides the one in your camp. 
---
The weight allowance will limit how much you can carry, but it is still a good idea to stash your junk on a regular basis in case a snallygaster sneaks up on you... 
---
The one mine that spawns the Uranium Fever event...Black Hole Mine I think. They were low level (14) when I was 25ish. 
---
If the event spawns check your map for a high level player and run towards them and try to pair up. They will cause dozens of level 60+ glowing mole men to spawn just being there. I died 3 times but the guy who was there wasn't rude and we finished the event. üòâ

It's usually the stealth assaultrons that screw me over, 3 of them in a room, you walk in and be like oh shit..

Accidentally hitting someones stuff while defending it or has caused me two bounties at this point
---
Ammo factory?
---
What do you mean am I ok?
---
I think the game wasn't supposed to have EVERYONE in the same spot all the time, honestly. I can wait that melee dude to tag, but if he's oneshotting things aswell then what's even the point? Every end game build destroy ghouls.. the only option we have as players is to equip low level things or use build unfriendly weapons, but with the weight limits good luck on that. The real answer is that the game can be played with up to 4 players in party and that's your sweet spot IMHO, the one designed by developers. We need more variety and activities across the map, every server need players scattered around, simple as that.
---
you can find a bunch of them in ash heap. The area around welch station has a bunch of mole men.
---
I found 2mins to be incredibly short for this. Not everyone is a twitch player. I had to do it over and over and over for a week before I finally did it. With only 3 seconds to spare.
---
It should increase with failure. Like if you fail it twice you get an extra minute, fail that a couple of times you get 4 mins and up until you can succeed. I DESPISE timed quests like these.

Art imitates life. This made me chuckle way to much at work today! 
---
I left my mic in and my hamster died! Not fair!!!
---
Or if it has things other than junk in it. If it has other things that means they decided to drop that stuff and it's free game.
---
What are you smoking? How does selling virtual items to other people in video games involve the law?
---
No. You don't need to use the keypad. Ever. Even if you're not the owner of the keypad. I have tested this with friends that were teammates, friends that were not teammates, random people that were my teammates, and random people that were not my teammates. Every. Single. One. Could operate the damn switch without having to first operate the keypad. Either the item is bugged, or Bethesda didn't think this one through because the keypad is completely pointless (you can't even change the code, so good luck remembering the random code that's assigned to it!)
---
And before any idiots try asking, I grouped up with a random person while exploring the world and asked him (before sending a friend request) to come try to open my door. He could. I also have used my shack as a hideout when I have had a bounty on my head in the past--people who were most definitely not on my team and not friends with me were able to walk right up to the keypad pylon and flip the switch to open the garage door.
---
It appears the only way to set it up so that the door is operated by an unlocked switch from the inside but a "locked switch" from the outside is to also use a terminal. If you set up a terminal on the outside of the garage door and a standard switch on the inside of the garage door, you can then lock the terminal (to require Hacking 0-3). The terminal, when also connected on the same power grid with a switch, will have options to turn all connected switches on or off. If this is the only switch you have in your camp, then it'll work exactly as expected. The only catch is that you need to manually close the door after going through it.
---
If I get on tonight I'll hit ya up. I'm a lvl 97 just in case you'd want to know

---
I cant find this weapon would it be possible to get it i would buy it but no one will sell it so i got no other choice!
---
Explosives are terrible to use while farming because you end up blowing mobs and corpses all over the place, into bushes where it's hard to see, unreachable spots, setting cars off.
---
Ah thanks for the edit. I remember getting the X-01 without cheats on FO4 took some time, yet I read comments of people losing their stuff regularly. I suppose if nothing is too difficult to get again, it balances out; specially with the bases assuming someone destroys it or nukes it. I saw you can't be harmed if you're on pacifict mode and don't answer back an attack, but I presume the same is not true for your camp.
---
It depends on the person I think. I just ran into a level 9 and gave him a couple of superstims and a radshield. Was cautious at first but then took it and was thankful. A few minutes later I had to go defend my workshop from someone and the 9er turned up to help. Gifted them some more chems, a couple grenades and a bobblehead. Pays to be nice, even if people are sometimes suspicious!
---
What‚Äôs February 22nd?
---
You can pass some of dem stims and radaway over here my dudeüëã
---
as a singer i want to have am instrument and an bard throughout the wastes..  
---
ahhh how i would enjoy that so..  
---
There's plenty of YouTube content creators blatantly advertising caps and gear for real currency over eBay, or other 3rd party sites. It's ridiculous, and these folks are just as harmful as the dupers, assuming they are not one in the same.
---
All the hubbub and trash talk about how pay-to-win has no place in fallout, and now look. It's not the haters keeping these guys in business, it's players.
---
There are commonly around seven bags of concrete at the top of the monorail elevator. Each bag yields, I believe, 6 concrete.
---
No! Bethesda is clearly the good guy! They only released an incomplete product, full of bugs that were even in fucking Fallout 4 lol, did false advertising (the bag), and made public some people's info! Bethesda is the good guy, they don't make bad rep, the damn Youtubers are the evil guys!!!!!
---
This sub is so full of Shilltesda it's hilarious
---
Yup you can choose. Go into your perks and find the one you want to share and hit the designated button (should show at the bottom of the screen) to share it.
---
When I first heard of fo76 I thought there would be different "races" like elder scrolls. I thought you would be able to choose to be a mutant, ghoul, human, robot, synth etc. I was a little sad I wasnt but I still love the game.
---
Shhhhhhhh don't tell everyone!
---
I had just made a post from the good side perspective of this, and now I get it. I'm sorry about the people who farm people with the PvP traps. I have been lucky enough to only have one guy tear my camp down and ive never been shot by a player. Trust me there are good people out there. Dont lose all hope, cause it's a fun game.
---
Then if you want to take it a step further, you shouldnt really ever have excess lead in your stash, make ammo every time you hit an excess of 50 lead. That way you have a little stash if you happen to find a gun with ammo you dont already have.
---
Also i dont keep more than 50 acid, if you bulk acid ( 10 ) then unbulk it you get 15 acid back.
---
Other tips are only keeping 25-50 of the lowbie/hardly used/ ez to farm junk, wood scraps, cloth, leather, rubber, concrete, fertilizer, copper, gold, silver nuclear material, black titanium,  ect 50-100 of medium junk, aluminum, ballistic fiber, lead, ect. And then keep unlimited of the stuff people actually buy, Screws, Gears, Springs, Lead (optional), Plastic, steel ( i keep upto 2k sell the rest) .
---
With this method i never run out of materials when repairing my stuff or modding guns i use for different situations. I have over 350+ of screws / gears / springs 500+ plastic and 1200 steel. The rest i keep no more than 100 of other junk items, i keep any gun / armor im not immediately trading or using on my mule. I dont keep excess meds past selling to vendors, my char sits at around 115/280 weight and my stash 350/600.
---
Also remember to only keep \~10 bobby pins and discard the rest, they are .1 each! Look out for 3 star armor with -20% chem or weapon weight. I run 60% weapon weight 20% chem ( need a good chest piece ) and its EXTREMELY noticeable i can hold around 25 weapons before going overweight great for steel farming.
---
Cool, guess I will try my luck then. 3k would be dope
---
(do you remember who sold you that for 3k? maybe there's more)
---
Thats what i did.
---
It wasn't fun so i stopped grouping.
---
I dunno. Did you?
---
I like staying in the forest sorta close to Vault 76. Not particularly good for fast travel but I don't have to worry about scorchbeasts or nukes so it's worth the tradeoff. 
---
This was it. I heard the noise and everything, and found a crashed satellite by my camp
---
On the bethesda launcher on the pc. As soon as i logged into my bethesda account they were available 
---
You're awesome. :)
---
PC, XB1, or PS4?
---
This is prevalent in every online game today. People realized from gold farmers that there‚Äôs money to be made in selling your virtual items to another person. 
---
This happens between me and my wife alot. 
---
I don‚Äôt. I found him on the Xbox One looking for group app
---
I thought about that too. Maybe not nerf it to the ground but completely rework it. Maybe you're able to shot a 40mm granade by pressing your designated granade button or something. Two shot should decrease your rate of fire by XY%. 
---
So you can still be killed in pacifist mode if someone keeps attacking you despite not answering back the attack? Is the only change a slower influx of incoming damage allowing you to run somewhere or?
---
Would you say its wise to stash repeatedly as you would sleep/save on FO4's survival mode to avoid losing progress? This may be a bit of a noobish question, but are realms/servers shared between console/pc or will you only meet people on your hardware.
---
Edit: Would you recommend it more on pc or xbox?
---
Yes! I will read a comment and think, "That was a really good comment!" Only to see it immediately downvoted even if it was something true or just an honest opinion. They must refresh the new section like crazy, fingers ready on that downvote button, haha.
---
Only issue these guys face is storing this items, unless they stay encumbered all the time.
---
NE Forest Gorge Junkyard workshop has a spot to use a resource collector for black titanium. I was able to claim it with a couple characters and get a decent amount.
---
My friend and I routinely 'police' the wastes, looking for people who do exactly that. A TSE handmade and TSE Gatling gun don't care what level you. 
---
Wasteland justice comes in the form of BOS armor and 550+ damage a shot. 
---
It‚Äôs probably just lazy copy pasta when they made the guide from a list Bethesda gave.
---
Drop it off at the first overseers cache. Make them work for it. It's a survival game.
---
You don't have a TestMisc?!?!  I don't know how my household could ever get by without our TestMisc!
---
I had a 500 cap bounty on me once for killing this group of assholes and destroying their shitty camp. 
---
Exactly this. Also, don't place it by the golf club either. 
---
I think you're right and I stopped listening because of it, I'd rather wait for a mod to load my own songs (I haven't bothered making one due to the bans lately).
---
I meant in reference to the bloody weapons/nerd rage etc build and setups. One hit wonders if you will.
---
That being said I imagine a low health max damage build would survive only the 1 x TSE in this set. And even then I didnt mention that a certain perk significanlty enhances this set (which a bloodly/low health build should have in their build).
---
However the small pool of health I dont think would be enough to compensate for the 'recovery' phase.
---
Now I wanna log and test this xD
---
Oh, no problem at all.
---
I'm not sure how quickly PA degrades without it at all, to be honest. I knew I was gonna go for a PA build, so I got it as soon as I could. I play maybe 15-20 hours a week and I'd say I have to repair maybe every ten days to two weeks. I'm wearing the X-01 power armor, so without Power Patcher, it could get a lot more costly since the X-01 requires some rarer materials to repair it. The T-60 is one of the cheapest to repair and uses very readily available materials, so if you rock that, it's not as much of an issue.
---
Maybe. A minute after I posted this I saw another post by U/didolgi and it made more sense. Shame people treat this game like GTA V and just attack players..
---
Yeah that‚Äôs another thing. Whitesprings was fun the first 10 times. Then it turned into its the easiest way to get xp fast. Now it‚Äôs just lame. The queen is alright but again, way too repetitive. I‚Äôm almost in the phase of trying to make the perfect camp, which is not really my playstyle at all. I‚Äôm crafting guns to waste up all the unused ammo in my stash at the moment. After both of those things, idk.
---
Watch how the tse people fire first. If they come in guns blazing then yes they are being pricks. But not all of us are.
---
I will watch other people or wait for the all clear from my group on voice chat using a machine gun to tag mobs first then once i see pretty much everything and everyones tagged i switch to a shot gun and quick kill the rest.. 
---
If i see a lower level (below 50 and i have room in my party) i always add them to make sure they tag everything and especially legendaries before a mob wipe.
---
There are considerate ways to use an explosive weapon. And there are very inconsiderate ways as well, just like there are good and bad players.
---
I cant tell you how many heart emotes ive gotten from players even higher levels than me from saving them as they were running out of a bad situation.
---
if you launch a nuke, you can farm the nukezone however you want. if you want to play with your explodey shotgun, it is totally fine to spawn the largest amount of strong enemies in a small area as possible
---
Yeah, that was intense.
---

---
May you catch dysentery and forever be out of reach of your purifiers and disease cures
---
Welch, Blackwater Mine (Not during Uranium Fever), and Uncanny Caverns.
---
Some of the abilities like nocturnal only update the stats when you have the item equipped.
---
Thank you for the clarification! 
---
Yes? It is their game.  Are you trying to be edgy or do you really not understand the difference between the owner of something earning revenue off it vs a 3rd party?
---
Well damn. I'm on ps4 my dude. Sorry about that. I woukd 1000% do it if i could.
---
Intellectual Copyright, these item are not theirs to sell they belong to Bethesda /  ZeniMax Media
---
And perhaps a you are forgiven emote that can remove a wanted level if you were the one the crime was committed against 
---
The terminal plans are obtained from the Enclave bunker's vendors btw.
---
Yep, I've got 4 or 5 cardboard vault guy stand ups point to it.  Since we can't just put a container right in our base!
---
Oh OK, thanks for info, it's another world to me.
---
As a guy with two different TSE weapons and two, as I call them, tag guns, I second this 100%. My farming routine, if I am not alone, consists of asking the players to follow me, placing em where they are safe, luring all the mobs out, tagging all the monsters, running in circles so everybody has a chance to tag all mobs, and then after two minutes of circling killing all the enemies in few shots.
---
I get crashes a lot. Happened at least 3/4 times in 5 hours last night. I don‚Äôt know if it had to do with the y2k thing with the silos, but it still happens on a regular basis at the most random times. 
---
"It isn't so"
---
Popular and obvious solution: release higher tier items. It's inevitable to need them to artificially drive the economy in a games-as-service model, anyways.
---
Yep, gotta get the high arc. Even still, that shit's hard to aim effectively.
---
This, I hardly ever go to the vendor there because I always end up in a fight üôÑ
---
You sure you dont need science master? I needed science master to make gaus rifle
---
No worries lol and new players are expecting high levels to camp the area, u could try setting a camp near overseers camp. Or just wait there
---
The damage they do whilst pacifist mode is on is minuscule, and if they really wanna spend 10 mins reducing your health by 1 HP at a time watching you use a stim or just leave the server its prob quite disheartening for them lol
---
Crash's on ps4 its hit and miss tbh, i can get a good 10-12 hours play and not crash once then the next day it could be one or two every few hours. That said ive been playing since it dropped to 30 bucks on the psn store so erm week or so before Christmas i guess and theres only been a couple of days where the crashing got bad that was boxing day and the day after for me. Personally i put that down to all the new players that were around, more people having time to play and Bethesda not being in the office so server maintenance was at a minimum. 
---
That's just me though and a lot off peoples experiences are prob different so take what you will from it, id say its no worse than any other mmo I've played on console or PC. I recently got the latest dlc for wow a few months back and prob dc'd / crashed more on that than this. Although diff platforms so \*shrug\*
---
Again though, if your a fallout fan grab it whilst its cheap. For all its frustrations its fallout online and I for one have wanted that ever since playing fallout 3 (and that mmo Fallen Earth way back lol)
---
Here you go!

Circle  of Steel: Appalachia is a Brotherhood of Steel Fallout 76  faction   and  gaming community. It's based on the West Coast BoS  structure as   seen  in Fallout: New Vegas and the original Fallout  games. Our purpose   is  to defend the remnants of humanity from the  abominations of the    wasteland; to protect humanity from itself by  making sure that dangerous    technology doesn‚Äôt fall into the wrong  hands; and to locate, preserve    and study the embers of civilization  to prevent it being lost  forever.  We do wasteland patrols, trading,  and team up for nuking  abominations. A  lot of the members has been in  BoS factions since the  very start. Ad  Victoriam!

Well, it's Savage. and Divided. So.... 
---
Sarcasm aside, the top of the world (middle of savage divide can range from 15-45 or so, at least that was my experience. The first players level in an area tends to spawn level appropriate enemies. By the time I was higher level (about 50) I was messing around down there in the empty region, which aside from some fissures was actually pretty empty, and in the north was when I was completing quests around 55-60 and that is what I saw there. 
---
So all of that to basically say depending on your level is what you'll see there, but shouldn't be BELOW 15 ever. I'd say the spawns and groups I saw the most ranged from 20 below my level with 2 or 3 individual baddies 10-15 above me. 
---
I was asking about the vendor. 
---
My friend and I tried for about a week to get the plans from the vendor, from 35 to 45, and it never showed up. However, we did get them (I think above 44 too) at the PD event. I can't verify if we were above 44, but we were close if not. 
---
Reports do seem to "confirm" that it's level 15-19 or so. As many people make an alt and get it within a server hop or two. 
---
Please and Thank you
---
At the moment im not sure I will, I play on PC and its my sort of game, its the Fallout that I have always wanted, yes I will be found in the new FarCry when that comes out, but this will stay installed and played for as long as there are servers available. I also have it on "X" and will play on there if at some point they give it mouse and keyboard support!
---
Tanagra town, first time i saw it I was in awe. 
---
I disagree with the fundamental principal of nicklediming your playerbase on a fully priced title more than I disagree with free enterprise. 
---
It's a reward for the quest Belly of the Beast. Lots of people tend to miss it when they finish it up. 
---
Dupers should be permanently banned
---
FTFY
---
Sounds good! Level doesn't matter as long as everyone gets a hit in so they get the loot. I'm like 60ish and we'll be hitting high level legendaries, unless a lower level player joins us we can let them spawn the enemy a few times at least.
---
I don't think so but if the door is unlocked and there is a vault boy out front you're generally safe to use their stuff that's what I do
---
This is pretty much what it is, i have played quite a few mmo‚Äôs over the years and sony refuses to let any other companies get access to their stuff. Even FINAL FANTASY XIV is crossplay only between PC and Playstation but they refuse to make a deal with microsoft to allow  xbox players in on the game.
---
I can't bring myself to be a jerk. But I am a Raider and I do want to PvP. The first time I PvPed I claimed a workshop that belonged to someone else. i didn't know at the time, and they showed up and started shooting at me. I fought back and killed them. Then they came back. I did an emote thumbs up. But they kept shooting at me, so I killed them again. I felt bad about it. Another time someone came to my workshop and opened a trade window and requested all of my shotgun shells. I gave them half then they walked to the console and instantly killed me with a shotgun. So much for being nice. I'm not going to make that mistake again. Then I met Rose and because a Raider. I was going to kill some low levels when one of them went down and his friend was having trouble reviving him. I went from would be murderer to saviour. Then I noticed a higher level was lingering around north of my base so I went to check it out. They had a base there. All of the doors were locked and their water purifier. I went and stood next to the water purifier dying of thirst and then they came and stood in front of me. I took out my knife and then swung it. They killed me with an explosive weapon. I came back and destroyed the water purifier. Then destroyed their door. I came back a few times and was trying some different weapons, armor, tactics, to see what I could do but the game crashed. I don't know if I'm good, bad, a saint, but to survive in this world I think I need to be a Raider.
---
But what about my lever action rifle?
---
Probably from another player selling it there
---
Surely you've figured this out by now, but it took me an *embarrassingly* long time to realize holding the plans and reading them is not the same thing.
---
Granted yes it is, I also remember how it was starting off level 1 solo. I see some people getting burn out quick. Besides it's a win/win for everyone involved, so I have no qualms just dropping it for them instead.
---
I cant really put my generator inside because the wire wont reach to where the water is for the purifier.
---
&gt;I have a 7 lick build
---
hehe....
---
Before I got my TSE weapons I were not dying at all. NownI kill myself with my own gun several times a day. Easy mode? Huh
---
I think it would be nice to see vendor locations that you've tapped out, become red or grayed out.
---
You're welcome.
---
Also, look into getting the Travel Agent perk (under Charisma). 30% fewer cap cost to fast travel. Until you really get going and start earning a lot of caps, it'll help.
---
you can change your characters look &amp; gender anytime you wish
---
it's in the "pause"-menu 
---
Ahhhhhh. Thank you.
---
I think it might be possible drop from any event in the Watoga region. I got it once from the Enclave event there, and others have reported it dropping from Line in the Sand.
---
Far as drops go we always tell people around us to go to white springs station and we drop everything in the desk and filing cabinet for lower levels to go through for upgrades on armor and weapons.. we all usually drop 1* and 2* items since ones i normally run with are 1 or 2 parts from having everything 3*
---
24 is the current server cap. So usually less...
---
Ahh. Thank-you.
---
**T**wo-**S**hot, **E**xplosive bullets
---
Need to list system 
---
Conceptually, it would be a fun idea, but I don't put the kind of time in to these types of games for it to be fun if had built-in enemies in opposing factions. I'd be overrun every time I log in, lol.
---
I'm level 150, It isn't hard for me to kill level 200's with my setup. I have nothing to retaliate against, I just want the game to gain more players instead of chasing them away. If I was them I'd be annoyed and quit playing, But go off I guess... 
---
Wendigos remind me of deathclaws in 3/NV. Fast with good melee attacks and they can close the distance quickly. 
---
Too bad wendigos seem to have an incredibly low max level. The highest Ive ever seen is 42 or so. They just dont inspire the same fear since I would consider a lvl 62 Charred Ghoul to be more threatening. 
---
Would you say this sub is...super duper?
---
On PC I just had the problem of the event: battle bot not showing markers in time and saying quest started over and over again even when I leave the area. It stopped when I quit to menu and rejoined
---
When you complete the BoS story, you get a full set.
---
Rosie's quests give you a set of Raider PA.
---
Enclave gives you plans for X-01.
---
Not sure about spending caps to do this. I'd be cool with placing my camp in areas that people can find to perhaps help with selling some of the resources. I'd like to know that I have protecting from people simply coming and blowing things up though if I do that.
---
It was only in the clubhouse from what a saw, I  didn‚Äôt stay to long either because they were all spawning really low level but they were hostile on site so I would assume so.
---
I've not used Pacifist Mode myself, but the text given before turning it on states that other players can still kill you if it's on. In regular play (without Pacifist), if a player attacks you, their shots will deal lowered damage until you attack them back.  
---
I would recommend stashing as much as possible, but inventory management can become a chore at times due to very limited space. There is no cross-platform play.  
---
I haven't played 76 on consoles. I'd suggest playing wherever your friends do. 
---
When PvP servers come up I do think that people who don't tag enemies and oneshot em will be hunted down by angry mob
---
Fact.
---
FYI it acts like a single shot rifle without the electric arc
---
That's a good point, they can buy extra Stash storage on eBay.
---
Level 70 and I just experienced my first megasloth at this location yesterday. It helped me take down two scorch-beasts once I grounded them. After the fighting was done, it was pretty badly injured, and I contemplated finishing it off to see what loot it dropped. Couldn‚Äôt bring myself to do it. Magnificent furry bastards. Haven‚Äôt seen another one since.
---
Yes, you can repair their camp as long as the part you're repairing is fully destroyed. I help repair some random, low-level player's walls after some griefer leveled it to the ground.
---
Still better than the first time I encountered her I listened to 99% of her story, then accidentally hit bash and killed her.  rip :'(
---
YES it is I've done it many times
---
I've been playing since beta and just got to level 50 yesterday, I probably have over a hundred hours so far and I've spent the majority of the time building and exploring. I havent launched a nuke or found the BOS yet but ill get there eventually. I'm having a ton of fun building my character and CAMPs, I can't see the game getting stale for me anytime soon
---
thank y
---
I forgot.
---
Anthem
---
Honestly bums me out when I go through my pile of 90+ holotapes that didn't give me a quest. :'(
---
How do mutations work without starched Gene's? Are they easy to maintain?
---
blame Todd. I dislike playing with you just as much.
---
Regardless if they have the tools to determine who has and has not duped anything, they know the names of the high profile douche canoes offering tutorials on YouTube... 
---
I did an orbital strike on a wanteds base and it only broke his walls and turrets :(
---
When you get finish quest it say, "Power Armor Frame"
---
I just did that actually and it worked! Level 8 dude walked up and had zero fear. This game really brings out the good in some people.
---
ge tthe plans from the scorch beast queen and build it, or pay someone who has it to build it for you
---
Ya they are cheating to make money. That makes it better right?
---
I think we just need a large damage increase across the board and a massive buff to durability all around.
---
Ranged weapons break far too quickly compared to the amount of damage they do.
---
I can help you run it if you're on xbox
---
I'm logging in right now
---
What platform? I might have a piece
---
Saints certianly exist. I just claimed the munitions factory and instantly got a defense quest for 2 SBs. I was around lvl 55...so I've got a good idea what's gonna happen but I know I'm not resourced for the fight. I'm running around desperately trying to repair the missle turrets and hoping the vertibot helps enough.
---
It's not going well. I've got a basic gatling...maybe 2 stimmies and I keep hiding in the factory just so I can eat food to survive.
---
Suddenly 2 guys show up. One is in his 80s and the other is like 150. First thing I think is they're watching me suck and then will take the workshop. 
---
Lo and behold, the realize I'm having a hard time and take down the SBs. Then came inside, dropped a LOT of plans for me, gave me a thumbs up and went on their way.
---
Thanks for your sharing.
---
That‚Äôs debatable false. As paying customers you have your own right to virtual items that no company would ever try to sue you for. Even in this circumstance, it does not break any law in any country except an EULA agreement with Bethesda. 
---
&gt; pimped out fops in fancy PA
---
I agree on the weapons, but getting a complete PA set of any kind and all the mods is easily in reach of anyone, so I wouldn't exactly paint everyone with that brush.
---
That's crazy.
---
Yeah, I've seen some people report similar things to you.  It takes me 15 hours to get three crashes/disconnects.
---
It's a shame we don't have hard data to look at, to see who experiences what more often.  We could separate crashing from disconnecting.  Then break it up by platform, then drill down farther and farther until we figure out why they're happening.  Hopefully Bethesda has some data at their disposal for that, although I have my doubts.
---
I‚Äôve been finding it hard to give things away because trade doesn‚Äôt show you what‚Äôs being offered unless you‚Äôre looking for it so it just confuses them. So I resort to dropping but then I need to make sure they see it, I rarely have my headset on.
---
PS4. Thanks but I‚Äôm going to chalk this up to a life lesson and move on. 
---
LOL. I read em'. I have a lot of weapons my baby Jenny Jones can make and she is my crafter for this MMO.
---
Im level 90, and always willing to help out!
---
I will one day get an explosive shotgun, but right now plans for it are avoiding me. Feel free to add me (anyone) - simmo0916 (PC)
---
You.. how it's right there it's a core mechanic how?!?!!? (Don't be offended please)
---
Wonder if it's because someone else built something inside his base? I have tons of stuff my mates built me in mine. Maybe if you damage that its considered the other person's base. 
---
Bummer didn't know that I love the arcing effect.
---
Glassed Cavern.  It was quite a bit bigger than I expected and the looting of the corpses was rewarding.
---
Correct. When I'm with friends, the vendors always have different cap amounts. So it's definitely tied to your character. And from what I read, it refreshes every 20 hours. 
---
For the OP. the vendors are all tied to a faction too. Like the Responders, or the Raiders. 
---
Reduced because you‚Äôre essentially three factions working together, or at very least not actively gunning for each other, less folks gunning for you. With the reduced risk comes reduced reward. 
---
Respect is "unlocked" at level 50
---
Tesla rifles. I was blessed with a two shot Tesla rifle and it tags everything for me
---
Dude I play online since '99 and that's reeeeeally the norm. In Asia there are families literally runned by MMOs black markets. You get real money from botting and/or exploits, basically your only risk is losing accounts here and there. At the end of the day you monetize pixels, it would have been weird if it wasn't a thing, honestly. Even without the dupe exploit, someone would have invented a way to automatize legendaries farming and sell the outcome. Try to Google playerauction, it's just one of the hundreds of ecommerce around, eBay is just the ice on the cake.
---
I do strictly heavy guns on my new main. (Almost level 70)
---
https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=f338c59&amp;d=sq2s32sr2s22sx0pe2c72cu2ic4ip2ih2s10a04l22ls2lt2es2sb1cm0&amp;w=&amp;n=Swiss%20cheese
---
I more or less follow this build (not mine). I put less into charisma because i play in a dedicated fireteam and didnt feel the need for lone wanderer.
---
Things to know before you go heavy weapons. You will most likely need to farm ammo for long periods of time before you do anything. Grafton steel or ammo factory. Both if you can.
---
You will most likely end up in power armor. Get some fusion cores and consider perking into power user.
---
Get both ranks of the ammo crafting perk and get super duper maxed out. Ammo is painful to come across before this. 
---
Personally, the gatling gun is king. I went from 25 dmg per bullet in the minigun to 132 dmg per bullet in the gatling. Thats the differnce between 100 dmg and 520ish (doing mental math) in 4 bullets. Thats huge. Scorchbests went from 500 rounds down to 40 to kill.
---
Chems increase your damage like mad. Consider abusing them...all the cool kids do anyway.
---
Other then that...prepare for the satisfying thunk thunk thunk of whatever you fire. It's glorious. 
---
I have an older Xbox one, which I‚Äôve heard does matter with server issues. Whether or not it‚Äôs true idk, but it makes sense
---
I‚Äôve had my decon arch up at my camp east of whitesprings for... month and a half? So far no one‚Äôs attacked my camp, let alone any single item. *shrug*.
---
BUT- PSA! Contractor perk in Intelligence applies to Any and All structures, so the arch is, mmm, two of each flux instead of 4?
---
A simple an elegant solution that will put this request to rest.
---
I'm much happier knowing I had to whip a possums ass with the butt of my pipe .38 and punch some mutts to death to make it, but that's just how I roll.
---
Yes, I have a PS4 and I fully acknowledge the problem is Sony and that it is stupid. 
---
Hope they'll fix this next patch
---
You have any leftover nuclear key cards? 
---
Gotta wait, cargo bot is bugged sometimes, after while there will be a yellow diamond with its exact location in the circle
---
I've had far more good experiences with people than bad experiences in 76. Though, like most games, it is more fun if you bring your own friends with you. I'm glad you had a good experience. 
---
Also, if you're feeling like you're not making real progress you should try making an alt character. Sometimes it helps to see a game with fresh eyes, try a different way of playing, meet some people in a different level range. My main is level 70-something. My friend and I started alts and I'm absolutely blowing through low level content. I had to stop and spend some time gathering supplies because I felt I was outstripping the resources I was finding through normal play. 
---
If you see Nuka Girl running around it might be me on my alt. If it is a Mistress of Mystery then it might be me on my main. Either way I'm happy to help so long as someone asks nicely or looks pathetic enough.
---
camps get attacked no matter where they are, certain enemies will always spawn in small groups periodically.
---
Just adding that this also worked for me.  I unchecked both of Rose's quests and she took the fragments from my inventory.
---
I didn't realize it but I there were more than 5 options, and you only need four of them. Enclave Officer's uniform counts as both formal and military, civil war era suit and hat count as historical, any sunglasses count for that one, and of course naked. We took our group photos in front of the Vault 76 door and got credit for 5 options and completed the weekly challenge. No Atom shop items needed.
---
There were other options: sleepwear (maybe long johns), sporing attire (golf shirt and golf skirt?), and others.
---
I think one step further of hitting youtube ... ahem.... 'personalities' and the like with an ICBM is preferred to a DMCA strike.
---
Not 100% sure what your trying to ask tbh :/
---
Why would you take a point out of strength and then on next level put it back in? Surely its better just to put the next point into what you wanted?
---
&gt; it's a core mechanic how
---
Maybe because it's totally unnecessary and neutered in Fo76, so any regular fps player can overlook it.
---
I hope someone fast travels to your zone and just kills all your shit before you can even touch it. Because that's what happens.
---
Gunsmith is good for keeping your weapons durability when out and about. 
---
You should of respawn, once your bounty off, they become wanted for destroying your stuff
---
fuk nuking this place, its been nerfed to shit, you get more from a queen, and you dont have to fighth te douche bags with the one hit guns.
---
Yes i am now one of those douche bags that one shot legendarys only cause i tried being hte nice guy and let everyone get a hit on it, but so many people just didnt do the same so fuk people now i just kill them straight up
---
You probably logged back on the same server 
---
Agreed...I dont get cool perks anymore.
---
What the game REALLY needs is a "Flipping the Bird" emote.
---
Are you sure about this? I recall going for a wanted player some weeks ago due to him having like a 1k bounty. He was hiding in his base and the moment I struck his door down, I became wanted myself.
---
Yes, yes
---
The guy asked for a moral viewpoint. I provided one. If you play as a raider, you're scum. You're choosing to make your play more enjoyable at the cost of the suffering of others. 
---
Once you hit 50, every level after your able to take a point away from one special and add it to another.  Though if you do this you forfeit the "select new card" phase.
---
Yeah that's bullshit. Why not use a Tesla rifle while farming? Just because you have a TSE you don't need to use it in a situation that ruins other people's experience. 
---
Its not a beta though guy, and yes it is quite common with mmos. Vanilla wow, warframe, eso, ark, no mans sky all had troubled launches but are now amazing games. The developer can only benefit from it being pushed to public, unforeseen issues can now be targeted. The community is playing a big part in fixing this game and Bethesda even put out a letter at one point to let players know this. What publishers decide to do is a lot of the time out of the devs hands, they could have been forced to launch.
---
Same. I just drop things because I know it took me a few hours and attempts to understand the trade system. I only have my headset on when my team is on to so it kinda complicates things. Ahh the life of a mute saint.
---
Which 99% of people miss haha
---
I believe several cosmetic items are content from the previous game that would‚Äôve obviously been added to the basegame otherwise.
---
It's definitely a spectrum out there. I have to say that hand in hand with the nice experience above, the workshop defence was my first real pvp experience in the hundred plus hours I've played this game. I was just trying to farm some much needed oil at the airport workshop and this chump decided to try and take it from me. It felt good to mince them to pieces with my shiny new auto grenade launcher and then take their stuff since they were the aggressor. 
---
People here often confuse a ToS (something some employees whipped up) with the law.
---
I can forbid you to wear shoes in my house, doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs against the law.
---
10-4
---
Is there not a limit? Maybe I'm mistaken, but I thought one person could only hold five at a time?
---
Never surrender!!!
---
At level 50 you can switch points around (1 level = 1 point swap)
---
You can also continue getting cards after level 50, just not additional points 
---
Trading subreddits help a lot as soon as you hit late game grind
---
if only we could report them with their advertised links too, just sayin that it would make it a lot easier for all of us
---
Passive mode does not in any real way do \_anything\_ for you. If you're level 50 and a level 100 wants to fuck your shit up, they can kill you in about six hits. it in no way protects your stuff. It's a fucking joke. 
---
Yea never heard of this issue. Make sure you meet level requirements to use the gun? You dont have to be a certain lvl to read plans but you do to craft
---
All we need is a Canadian flag emote and that will cover all the basis 
---
Death doesn‚Äôt really have consequences though 
---
I didn't say you should buy atoms. And to say there is no cap economy is true currently but with them adding player vendors that could quickly change. Not to mention its obvious the game was designed so caps are relatively scarce so someone who can fast travel everywhere constantly because they have infinite caps does effect everyone else's gameplay. My point was that if they dont stop the cheating, duping, and black market caps then the game will die and they won't continue support. So atoms help them support the game, players selling caps actively kills the game. Thats the difference.
---
On the east end of the gorge bridge there's a pickup truck that has fallen over, spilling at least five bags of cement on the bridge deck
---
blame Todd. instead of nerfing fun weapons, how about giving us fucking private servers?
---
I didn't kno-oohhh the gun was loaded and I'm so sorry my friend, I didn't kno-ooooh the gun was loaded and I'll never, never do it again!
---
I dump my extra plans and ammo right outside the vault where ever I‚Äôm up that way
---
I mean regardless of the MIRV mod, you shit a fatman
---
How long? I‚Äôve already been 4-5 minutes.
---
Any wanted less than a few hundred caps is a waste of my time.
---
You wouldn't believe it if I told you that I don't actually lean the same politically as him then. Lol. I'm just not willing to stand for alt left or alt right, and I enjoy watching them get called out on their stupidity. Middle ground is where it's at, and although I slightly lean one way, I like to hear both sides.
---
It really shows how poor your argument is when you have to go from insulting someone I watch, to insulting me directly. It really is pathetic. 
---
Ugh - I have it at 2, just 8 luck to work with.
---
Welch Station Vendor. 810 caps. Level 44.
---
Seems pretty general and widespread. Just rng on it showing up.
---
Yes blame Toad
---
‚ÄúFollow me‚Äù emote, drop, tea bag the bag, jump up and down, it‚Äôs seamless 
---
Can't give a exact time, it's random. 
---
Maybe the emote could be breaking your gun over your knee and throwing the pieces behind you? Or some grovelling?
---
In his defense they either never tell you about it or maybe tell you once. My friend who never played FO before had no idea too.
---
I've had a pair of asshats bomb my camp and then go through destroying anything left standing and they only drew the attention of the turrets. The only reason that you might be killed at random is if a party member engaged in a fight. Be careful.
---
But the game documentation clearly states-
---
Because I messed up on perk cards and the chance of getting 3 x 2 of the same card out of packs is unlikely so when I put the points back in I can select the card I want 
---
I guess you're right, and yeah compared to previous Fallouts it's not very well done
---
Sounds mighty similar to the trader system in the Elder Scrolls Online.
---
People have been selling game gold for two decades now. And it‚Äôs usually companies doing it.
---
Close up auto Tesla...melts 'em
---
Well done!  I thoroughly enjoyed this.  10/10 would read more.
---
I would like to have my home evaluated :)
---
so 1:dont have pc cant help you there
---
2:same as one
---
3: up till lvl 5 you can not attack any players or get attacked after lvl 5 you have to go into game setting and enable pasifist mode off to attack a player
---
4: weather pasifist is enabled or not people do slap damage to you minus 1 or 2 health for attacking you so as long as you dont attack them no matter what weapon they use or how high of a lvl they are.they Cant kill you...To initate pvp you both have to attack eachother with pasifist mode off
---
5: lvl 97 have about 60+ hours in the game pretty easy to grind lvls going to a nuke zone and tagging everything
---
hope my explanation wasnt to complicated
---
Mine's older as well.  I almost upgraded to the XBox One X, but I'm glad I didn't.  The setup I have right now seems to be really good for this game.
---
* Don't ever sell unwanted armor while you are wearing power armor. Your normal armor will appear unequipped and it can be very easy to accidentally sell stuff you don't want.
---
* When you take a workshop, you'll soon after get a quest to defend it. Do it for easy stimpacks, purified water and plans. 
---
* If you get a legendary gear piece, whether it be armor or a weapon, pay attention to the 5 little dots. Each dot represents a legendary effect, and you can find them with up to 3. You have to inspect the item to see them all.
---
* For perks like Pharma Farm, the ones that provide a chance for extra loot based on container types, you have to press a button to activate that second search. For example, with Pharma Farm on PC, when you are looking at the contents of the med box, press Spacebar to activate the second search. You'll see a little pop up if it procs.
---
Blizzard recognized that and created the real money auction house for D3, but it turns out people don‚Äôt like it when the company does it since it‚Äôs viewed as p2w. Just shows you that the people can‚Äôt win against their arch nemesis, the people.
---
I like the idea of a Deathclaw dressed like the mysterious stranger showing up and perma-killing their character. 
---
Whichever you prefer, honestly. Weapon mods are all kinds of fucked up, don‚Äôt try and figure out a logic to it, just look at what it actually does, or what it looks like, and go with that. 
---
the saddest part is when u go to kill the scorchbeast queen as melee but some fubois kills her before she lands and ur shitty range weapon didn't do any considerable damages to give you loot u.u
---
Cause I'm a ballistic rifle build. I'm not one shooting them what's your issue?
---
Im usually pack ratting it too during a nuke run.. have to slow walk to white springs station to unload and check drops.. then i will dump everything into the desk and filing cabinet there for others running with us or newbs following us to look through and go for upgrades.. 
---
Had a new guy running with us the other night had went from about 43 to 50 and was able to equip himself pretty good from the armor we all dropped in the desk. Then after everyone was done picking through it all several grabbed a few peices to sell at whitesprings for some caps.
---
Darn üò£
---
Yeah, it's really crappy that they don't let us see what's inside chassis.
---
You cannot redo the quest with the same character, however you can obtain plans for this armor and craft it. Or, what's cheaper and easier, just buy the whole set from other players. It's not that expensive and will cost few thousand caps I guess.
---
I gather all the lead, gunpowder, and plastic I can find and craft 10 mil, .45 and shotgun shells...I don't have any on hand (beyond like, less than enough to craft any bullets) for more than a day. If you're not using it, dump it.   
---
What I've been doing with ammo I don't want is traveling to vault 76 and dumping there...someone might want it. 
---
I can craft the entire set for reduced cost on PC. If you‚Äôre on PC message me here.
---
there's no fucking market, Jesus fucking Christ. this isn't a mmo, let people have fun.
---
what about the wage slave who can't farm for a month for a crappy explosive? fuck him?
---
I'd like one of those.  I accidentally detonated about half the Sugar Grove parking lot on a dude yesterday.  I was trying to use it to kill a couple robots, and he ran through from out of sight as I was doing the last bit of damage on a truck.
---
He was in power armor, so it didn't kill him, but still.
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76bazaar/?st=JQH7A43E&amp;sh=d8bf271c
---
If I go away and do another quest will it fall whilst I‚Äôm away?
---
If you don't attack back other players do negligible damage to you BTW. May have been able to avoid death. 
---
Yes, and the stats on the item is tied to its Max durability.
---
Drink some fungi-tea, pop a mentat, damage your self down to 30 health, with a bunch of unyielding armor.
---
Any other modifiers you can bring to the party. (egg head, and strange in numbers for example)
---
Then craft a PA piece - you will see something interesting.... it will have a higher DR and ER.
---
yes.... there is a good reason to be an int crafter in the game, you can make PA which has more damage resist (not by too much, but it is there)
---
Enjoy!
---
Different quest friend
---
It‚Äôs a named feral too!
---
Livin' that tesla life. They got great acceleration (on group tagging). Great battery recharge time (takes just a sec to reload). Best in show looks makes picking up ladies (or players looking to share the clubhouse) an easy task.
---
It'll probably fall since others can go pick up its contents as well.
---
My mute either doesn't work on my pretty new headset or there's some kind of bug. I tested it with a buddy, even when I have my mic muted he can hear me lol
---
Thanks :) hopefully when energy weapons are fixed, it'll be a beast.
---
Yeah, the "Converted Munitions Factory".
---
Don't bother with it though, once you clear it, set it up with generators to power the whole thing and start it up there's a mandatory defense against a Scorchedbeast regardless of the level. 
---
I ended up ignoring that but not before having wasted all of the ammo I had crafted to attack scorched. In the end it became overrun and I abandoned ship.
---
I'd recommend crafting ammo yourself with something like ammosmith and super duper to craft a bunch if bullets using lead, gunpowder and steel. This is much easier, safer and yields much more ammo that that godforsaken place...
---
NoRespawns does good camp build videos.
---
Ok, I give. What does tse mean in this context? I‚Äôm pretty sure it‚Äôs not ‚Äútesticular self examination ‚Äú or ‚Äútransmissible spongiform encephalopathy‚Äù, tho my first guess actually fits.
---
When you don‚Äôt have starched genes on, mutations can be removed with radaway/decontamination arches, when you do have it on they cannot be removed 
---
It doesn‚Äôt affect the mutation ability, it just affects the acquisition of them
---
Op lick build = lucky lady friend
---
I wasn't replying to you but the point stands. Your build/damage doesn't matter when farming in big groups, you just need to tag everything as they will die regardless. There's no need to one shot everything with a TSE if it's screwing over other players.
---
Saw that vid and thought that too
---
I support this
---
The "tag for search" feature is your best friend and a good way to avoid the need to hoard every piece of junk you come across. Makes for lighter travel.
---
V.E.N.D.O.R.
---
Vault-tec Enhanced Nuclear Diverse Object Retailer
---
But yeah i'm envisioning a database you can search for stuff.. it'd find an item and give you a location (map location).. you would have to swap servers and travel to the vendor which could be marked on the map.
---
On the other hand.. they might want us to really get out and try to advertise our shops naturally.  Which I'm not a huge fan of because it'd require using third party tools to advertise or just trying to advertise to the limited number of people on your server.  Or ... forbid... having to advertise in heavily trafficked spots due to server hopping activities.
---
In reality, i can picture them just giving us a vendor we can list stuff on that we can place in our camp and not implementing any supporting game mechanics.
---
I think the one needed tool is an icon on the map to locate vendors or have them all in a central location.  Having a central location would lead to more server hopping unless it was cross-server.
---
For your suggestion, definitely an ability to friend or follow/track the vendor or something similar so you can re-discover it would be great.  Especially for... known dupe vendors... ugh that would kind of spoil that idea IMHO.
---
It makes you a pacifist, meaning can not do damage to other players.  It does not mean you can not be damaged by other players.  You do not get to control other people‚Äôs actions, just yours.  This is not hard to understand but it seems the majority of people seem to be really confused.
---
Place your camp near a railroad station and/or a workshop. You can sell stuff at railroad stations and taking over workshops gives xp and plans when you defend them.
---
I don't mind doing that since that's what I've been doing on my latest survival FO4 run and Horizon mod of the latter. Granted I'd probably be aggravated if I lose progress halfway there lol.
---
When you say crunching them, do you mean like scrapping the item for the materials like you would scrap a desk fan on the other games for steel, circuitry, etc?
---
I come by every three-five days, and almost always see a  post exactly like this one, down to the passive aggressive heading. No, we talk about how shitty the atom system, from the shop, to the challenges, all the time.   
---
In game or...
---
Two shot explosive handmade rifle, 20$ on ebay.
---
Yup and personally I‚Äôd rather people profit from their effort than paying $20 for a Santa skin. Though RMT isn‚Äôt a big deal in this game at all I‚Äôm not sure why people are making it out to be. Have you seen how easy it is to dupe for the past few months..
---
How about energy guns be like pipe revolvers and bolt action so they get boost from pistols and rifle perks?
---
It‚Äôs random.
---
More often than not it‚Äôs a deathclaw for me.
---
What's a little alien doing with big alien smut like this?
---
Yes I understand, but I fucking dont want to pvp, so I have no fucking clue why this is a fucking thing, holy shit its dumb as fuck.
---
I have seen people on this forum say that if you pick up the eggs around the Mothman museum and keep them on your person, that it increases the chance of an encounter. I have not personally tried this though. My one and only encounter is when I was serving hopping the Charleston Vendor, I crossed the bridge and turned around and he was standing in the middle of the bridge. 
---
Both PA and Hazmat have a hidden effect that counters radiation, its easy to proof.
---
just stack a bunch of rad-x until you have like 2k radiation resistance and compare that to your 1000 rad resistance hazmat and your 500 rad resistance PA. its bullshit. 
---
I can't stand youtubers anyway so bullet dodged. Rather find out for myself if I love or hate a game than listen to some dickhead talk about it. 
---
Early on, lots of cooking. Easy xp, that you can sell. Get the canned dog food perk and save your nonperishables
---
_Totally_ in game. 
---
It's my favorite spot, very easy to control and you get other rewards for claiming the workshop as well.
---
But there are other games where a pacifist mode disables any and all pvp damage. 
---
It would be nice to have an option that lets us opt out of it all. 
---
Oh it's you the guy who complains about having to pay money for a completely optional portion of the game that doesn't affect anything in the gameworld aside from your feels. And also you don't play any more but seem to complain all the time? What a totally great use of your seemingly endless time.
---
I usually give myself 5-10 minutes before I go get it. I'm usually too early. You'll see red smoke coming up from it, which helps in finding it. 
---
it shouldn't come as a surprise as this is Reddit but these posts contradict themselves.
---
you want the game to have an economy but you call out people for selling in-game goods for real money. do you think WoW or EVE sustains itself based on make-believe currency?
---
Its funny the best weapons I've farmed have been solo'ed. I usually only stay in White Springs for 3-4 rounds anyway.
---
 Consider joining a faction too! It's a great way to find people to team up with, and it creates a great sense of community! If you're interested, here's a 150+ member BoS group: [https://discord.gg/PnEgyW7](https://discord.gg/PnEgyW7)

I recommend you reading this, contains excerpts from lawyers.
---
It's a shitty system.
---
Not sure about that complicated part but the top half had me 
---
Fortnight + PUBG sales = they hamfisted this in.
---
Yeah, so they can relentlessly tear apart anyone that pursues them with explosive shotguns. Sounds like a blast.  
---
Get it?   
---
a BLAST.
---
So in this example he's making a little over $7 an hour, plus any additional time it took to farm/dupe, minus the 'value' of the free quantums. I know first time interns that make more than twice that much. 
---
Unless your build is optimized you're going to have a tough time getting through a silo solo at level 39. Getting a set of level 40 PA might help, and loading up on as many buffs, chems, and stims as possible will be a good idea, but it'll still be tough. You may want to enlist a friend or two. 
---
As for the codes, they get solved and posted every week on nukacrypt.com, so if you can't get it done this week you can look there for next week's codes. 
---
Any braindead TSE weapon, I guess.
---
Wow, thank you that's very thorough. Sorry for repeating, but you said you only lose your junk in cases where you would lose anything \[killed, crash, etc\]. So does that mean your power armor, armor pieces \[not being worn\], and weapons would still be on your character's inventory when you logged back in or respawned?
---
_jazz music resumes_
---
Very lame. Hopefully fixed in the same patch they make laser weapons not break after 1 god damn minute. 
---
Didn‚Äôt know this. Will continue to complain until it works correctly and probably after it works correctly for a little bit because I paid for a working game at $60 for pc and xbox.

I don‚Äôt understand the hate for juicehead? He, as a player of the game, shows the good and the bad of the game while providing his own views 90% of the time. Poor guy even tried to make a ‚ÄúIs Fallout:76 really that bad‚Äù were he said it was worth 30$ and his viewers absolutely shitted on him for it.
---
It certainly sounds that way, considering I only ever got one liner response and then my ticket ignored when I submitted something. Why people have to go to social media to get anything fixed is ridiculous to me.
---
Ancients: the enigmatic heads scattered underground (tangara town, lucky hole mine) put onto the liberty primes model and uses similar attacks but mostly uses melee and an assaultron charged style beam and without the nuke bombs for balancing.. he would move slightly faster too, be very tanky and wander a certain path that changes daily (could wander in your camp)  
---
What ya'll think? Bethesda wouldnt this mind too much because they dont have to do much work, just create a body for the being. (you could even just go elemental and put floating rocks and/or fire in place of the body)
---
Good to know!
---
The damage caused to you without healing is "slap" damage, a small fraction that can be easily out healed. Best bet if it happens again is to pop a stim and vacate the area. I'm curious how did they manage to kill you?
---
Noice!!
---
The penalty for getting killed is pretty low. Best advice is just to respawn and go get your shit. If the same thing is happening at your base and you have no chance, just logout. Your base isn't permanent on the server, it's attached to you.
---
 She's level 51 now. I doubt that's the problem. ;)
---
It's all down to personal perspective. I have stated before that I paid the same price for resident evil 7 &amp; got about 15 hours game play from it before I lost interest - so witch game has given me better value for the price?.... If I had the major bugs stopping me from playing my opinion would be different, but it hasn't  &amp; I have almost enjoyed every moment of the game (can't say completely because major lag &amp; server disconnects are not fun)
---
Bad bot!
---
I know you can repair other players turrets. Came upon a guys base getting blasted by protectrons. Helped him patch up the damage after we cleared em out.
---
Explosive Shotguns. Found in game. Don't buy weapons for real cash. 
---
having just googled it in another tab: Two-Shot Explosive
---
apparently it's the best legendary effect... or pair of effects? not sure on that exactly
---
Same here. I often repair turrets.
---
That's what I did, I just had 4 gears and wanted to make my 10pwr gen for my large water purifier
---
Through Bethesda.net (pretty sure it‚Äôs .net) I haven‚Äôt done it since I haven‚Äôt owned a pc in forever. But it‚Äôs all through their website. 
---
Following the first few story quests will give you access to most of the good crafting items, and some basic vendor spots and locations. Train stations generally serve as a sort of 'safe zone' isolated enough from enemies. Early on, just focus on getting using to the eating and drinking requirements - they're not that hard to manage - and getting used to non-VATS combat, if you relied on it heavily in the previous games. 
---
Observation towers can give you access to a bunch of map points, if you find one. Climb to the top and you'll get an option to 'survey' the area. Also, if a map in the game has a pin-tack in it, you can 'activate' the pin point and it'll usually go on your map. 
---
Combat-wise, melee tends to do more damage, especially once you unlock reliable power armor - you get a quest for a good suit at level 25. Before then, you have to rely on raider armor if you want power armor, which is kind of meh. Hunting rifles are good early game weapons if you have good aim. 
---
Don't be afraid to run away from enemies that are way higher leveled than you. Enemies scale depending on the levels of other players in the area, or which player entered that area first. If you're consistently getting crushed in an area, trying logging off and then back on - server hop - or just explore some other areas. Generally, the area you start has the lowest leveled stuff, and the toughest enemies are in the East and the far extremes of the map. 
---
How do I sign up?
---
Then don‚Äôt pvp.    I like to PVP and attack every one I see in the hopes I get caps equal to their level divided by the team and their junk bag.  You are just another loot pianists to me.
---
I'll check it again in a few. Going back to see if any more of the armor shows up. 
---
I'd rather have two mothmen than have to solo four Scorchbeasts at once.
---
Which I did once.
---
Thank God I'm not epileptic.
---
Energy weapons are weak, bugged, have no good perks, lack in variety and there's even a popular mutation that nerfs their damage by a whooping 50%. Idk what devs were thinking.
---
I get this power armor bug a lot on myself apparently and people giggle about it
---
Jelly donuts should be more proportional.
---
The way it works, by default, is when you shoot someone, they can shoot you back.  If you don't shoot them, they deal reduced "slap" damage to you.  That gives you the opportunity to leave or engage them.  The slap damage won't do more damage than you can heal through with stims, and you can block them and teleport away.  When you block someone they can't see you on the map.
---
Now enter pacifist mode.  All it does is disable you doing damage to other players to avoid accidentally engaging them in pvp.
---
This is all barring special mechanics like workshop, pvp events, being in a team, etc..
---
I was at blackwater mine dying over and over again at level 16 against some level forty glowing molemen when a level 120 fella happened past, I did the follow me emote just kind of hoping. And he cleared out the mine for me. Than started an event which I tried and failed to help with, ended up bailing once I finally picked up my junk, and wasn't able to say thank you do to running away and lack of mic. But thank you redneck something or other. Thank you.
---
You know, level 50 explosive two shots and the All rise
---
This was like how it was for me on Christmas Eve, late on the west coast. There were two or three others, but it felt like I had the whole world to myself. Nothing was looted, all the enemies were the right level, it was amazing.
---
I had some guy continuously bomb my camp because he was wanted and I killed him, so I kept rebuilding, and because he would become wanted I kept killing him. Then he tried to take me on personally. Not a smart idea against a tse lever action lol.
---

We still love Reddit, though.

When lootboxes are a thing 
---
But NOT because I want to quit but because Fallout76 might no longer be playable nor available where I am right now :(
---
Auto run for console please 
---
That's probably too OP when paired with Concentrated Fire and Critical Savvy. 
---
yikes, i was not expecting that. would you do it cheaper if i provide all mats? 
---
Killin machinee is my gt i usually do like 3 queens a day if im not tired from work ill be on later tonight if you want to run a few queens
---
Why the fuck is this post getting so much downvotes? 
---
I had one last night near the Monorail Elevator that seemed to take a lot longer than usual to show up.
---
I went up to both levels on the elevator and searched around, wondering if the drop had gotten stuck somewhere and I just wasn't seeing the smoke from the ground ... but nope.  No luck.  Went back down, and right as I was about to leave, I saw the CargoBot coming in ...
---
... unfortunately, it just kept circling around the top of the elevator ... I eventually got fed up, went up there, and shot the ****** down.  A quick PA-jump down to the ground later, and was opening the drop to find ... absolutely nothing worth my trouble. :/
---
Me too! And thanks. I'm glad a few people saw this in the sea of feature requests and other drama.
---
It touched... my bulb...
---
Yes. I've been playing solo since release. Well worth it. 
---
Sadly that feeling will fade fast.  Since about 40 i've been soloing them and it's more annoying than thrilling.  But at least you can get some ultracite out of it.  haven't gotten any plans for killing them yet.
---
I hate swapping out perk cards at all. One of my least favorite things. Do I know how to fucking pick a lock or not?
---
Nice ty
---
Cool! I‚Äôll add you. I might be on, probably tomorrow night or something. 
---
Yup. Had a similar struggle here. They just ignore and then don't respond to tickets
---
I love irony.
---
This is awesome...
---
...aside from the fact that when I‚Äôm wanted, I‚Äôll always hide in someone else‚Äôs base that I‚Äôve found.  Enjoy Orbital Striking and getting wanted too, champ!
---
Bloodied is a legendary effect on weapons. It makes the weapon do more damage the lower your health gets. When you fight the Scorch Beast Queen, you drink dirty water or whatever you have that gives you rads until you are below 20% health. At 20% the Nerd Rage ability becomes activated, the adrenal reaction mutation becomes activated, and the emergency protocol power armor mod becomes activated. This leads to a massive amount of damage per swing and some extra damage reduction. 
---
You can play like normal when not fighting her, but this method allows you to do some real noticeable damage to her.  
---
There is a very interesting cave to the far north of the mire, if you hug the cliffs you should find it! 
---
Charleston for the fire breathers? I thought lol. Nevermind 
---
I'm thinking even that so long as you don't fight back you should be able to fast travel to your base for free at any time. Haven't tried this particular situation exactly, but I don't see why it wouldn't work. Just escape.
---
Just wonder around and RNGeesus will look upon you and will give his prays for you along with some "two shot explosive extra ultra automatic Gauss shotgun"
---
I don't PvP much, I know wanted players cannot see you on the map but do you still show up with a big banner with your name and level when you get close if they look your way? It would be cool to track and stalk a wanted player but at the same time if they can just spam vats to see you or see your health bar in the distance it kinda defeats the purpose.
---
It's too bad talking shows a mic icon in-game, too. It would be funny to trash talk or spook people if they didn't know where you are.
---
Yeah just walk or run away and use a stim or two. Don't engage or they get full damage
---
Dude, yikes. No wonder it was easy to miss! You are doing the Lord's work.
---
76 was launched in this state on purpose, the sheer volume of bugs that have been seen in previous titles proves it. A FEW bugs can be forgiven like you said ; but Bethesda got greedy rushed it out and are paying for it.
---
I was about to post my camp position and Layout too but I suddenly don‚Äôt feel too confident now after you have been attacked
---
I hardly have a lot yet, so losing even my bench would set me back a lot 
---
I‚Äôm in to do this sometime but tonight I‚Äôm busy; plz friend me. PSN id is bumpngrind 
---
Digging the "Winchester Mystery House" callout.  :)
---
Awesome, thank you. I think I know the answer to this one, but I'll ask just in case. Are realms/servers shared in the sense that PS4/PC/XBOX players can play with each other, or is it still all 3 only playing with their respective console/pc peeps?
---
My only criticism is that there isn't enough content in the Atom shop. Charge me whatever, I don't care, but make it something I actually want to buy, lol.
---
thank you sir
---
I just dont like when they are predatory about it. Limited time item for 1 day and drop 800 atoms to buy it. 
---
I've bought atoms for some of the things I wanted, but that's just.... eh.
---
I would be delighted to get another game like 76. Hilarious that you still think screeching about how the game is bad is an argument. You've got a nice little pool of phrases you repeat over and over to sound like you know what you're talking about. Lol still not a sequel and the price didn't drop to $25 after a week. You just can't stop lying, just because it comes out of your mouth a hundred times doesn't make it true. You've got no argument so you cry because I used mean words. You really are a bitch
---
It can't be that bad...can it? ü§û
---
When you pick a special, you can then tab right or left to change the category of card you want to pick from
---
TSE?
---
Gotcha got wrong part of thread. I agree. I'm spoiled I usually play with 2 teams on same server so were use to coordinating. Its fun when one of our guys calls in orbital strike on mass outside
---
Your, feeling, such does not make it so.
---
[I changed it a bit to make you more damaging, less tanky.](https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=f366b87&amp;d=s42sm2sn2ss2se2i12lt2l71e10e40ee2c72ck0a72a42a01ir2pa0p90p80ib4l91&amp;w=lu2&amp;n=)  
---
Without range, I find explosives to help with softening up heavy hitters before they get close.  
---
I maxed out your strength perks, 1 3\* card I find to be better than a bunch of 1\*'s  
---
I swapped out your perception to the lockpicking as the "advantage over this type" is too situational.  
---
Intel I stacked up the explosive damage, cuz BOOM, also I made this build with combat in mind, you have the points to swap into any crafting cards.  
---
I used the extra perception points to buff agility and intel.  The extra AP will help with power swings.  
---
With the luck points, I ssume you're going for a mutations build, so class freak becomes a must.  Pharma farma was a fill card, pick your fav.  
---
Have fun out there, I run an unarmed build with no PA, so these are the perks I select, you can adjust accordingly.
---
Rip Chris
---
Congrats on your reward!
---
" Great battery recharge time (takes just a sec to reload). "
---
You mean a Tesla Rifle without perks? Hope you're joking there buddy.
---
Tomislav, sandvich, and the holiday punch or GRU imo. 
---
Wait, wrong game. Oh well. Maybe somebody will get a laugh out of this. 
---
Maybe. But pistols sure do need something.
---
Definitely. It got a lot of bad press and as you might expect it's buggy as hell, but there's plenty to do without having a full squad every time you login. 
---
Alright, thanks! Seeing your banner of the BoS, I'm gonna read up and see which factions from the different games are available, if any, to join within the game.
---
Just south of the Overseer‚Äôs camp, on the west side of the road has a concert deposit. 
---
What platform do you play on?  PM me your in game name if you are on PC. 
---
What platform are u on
---
correct, gear is yours forever, unless you sell it or break it down.
---
The only thing you accumulate that you can lose through death is junk.
---
It's a very forgiving game that you will die in lots, lolz.
---
These are just a short list of issues I personally had within the first 2 weeks of release
---
- Unable to exit power armor
---
- People in your group not being visible, requiring everyone in the group to restart their game to correct
---
- Vertibird bug causing loud random noises for the rest of game play
---
- Fix it Good/Weapon Artisan Perks didn't work and gave you no extra durability
---
- Player camp randomly disappearing during play though
---
- Unable to replace camp in the same spot you originally had it
---
- Poor implementation of camp stairs causing an issue where you could no longer place your stored camp due to no support
---
- Quests (Kill unruly golfer feral ghouls, Cold Case, Keys to the Past, Tracking Unknowns) unable to be completed
---
- Game crashed when entering Poseidon Energy Plant until Bethesda did a full shutdown of all servers
---
- Random disconnects from the server
---
- Nuke Zones causing server to crash or cause player disconnects
---
- Legendary enemies not rewarding any loot
---
- Legendary explosive weapon causing enemies to never die/heal to 100%
---
Whenever you level up and choose a perk, use the sort by (R1, L1 ps4) to choose which perk you want. You do not need to take a perk associated with the SPECIAL that you increased that level. 
---
Or, or, hear me out, fuck'em.
---
 I'm playing my own game. if you are a duper you suck, your whole family sucks, and your rig is a potato. 
---
And with the YouTube people fuck them too, get a real job.
---
Two shot explosive
---
i doubt it was anyone from reddit, they only cost me 1 wood. just assholes from my server who were probably wandering around.  &gt;:( 
---
Right, assuming they add in game player vendors this is true and would be fair. As it stands, it‚Äôs not trying to go the traditional mercantile route, which for me was another main feature of the game. I never used mods in this game, and in previous games I always opted for only the mods that made the game harder to get more playtime out of it. That being said, I don‚Äôt believe that people selling caps is inherently wrong. If it‚Äôs fair for Beth to sell atom to people with no time to grind it for items they clearly add benefit to the game vis a vis building, I think it‚Äôs fair that people should be allowed to sell the cap grind. That being said, selling duped caps instead of giving them away may be baseline immoral, but it‚Äôs still fine imo to allow people who want to buy themselves out of playtime to do it. 
---
Alright thanks! I only know one other person that would probably play it, and he plays it on xbox, so I may have to get it for the console then.
---
Must be a diehard fallout fan &gt;.&gt;
---
...you literally can't engage. 
---
I agree with not acting self righteous. Claim bounties, but avoid blowing up camps for no reason.
---
That said, I shot up some kid's camp because he was in front of it, shot me, and I unloaded on him. Blee up his turrets, but he'll be fine.
---
I only play solo and I love it
---
Last night I spent the last 15 minutes hunting down Christmas noobs and... offering to mod their weapons. For the first time in recent memory, I actually ran out of aluminum. 
---
I think the ability to earn atoms in game kinda negates some of the high price, but it could still come down a little. The new years tux was a great way of pricing it, I think. Needs a lot more content on a much more regular basis, and content that fits the way people play the game. Like skins for weapons people commonly use. I just don't find much that is worthwhile in there most of the time, which is my biggest complaint.
---
On the video you always had a "face" item on. Does it conflict with this possibly?
---
That‚Äôs how I did it plus some good plans and junk for the PVE defense events!
---
Two effects
---
Yup. You got too much stuff. Thats the kind of stuff you put on a mule.
---
Stuff you dont use but you like.
---
Just keep your best gear. 1 alt gear at most in the stash. I have a pve and most of a pvp set. All 1 star. As i get 3 star replacements, i will sell or mule the others. I only have a bloody sledge, tse shotty which i only use on scorch beasts and 30% ghoul dmg, 40% swing speed sledge for farming. I carry all 3 weapons, so theres no weapons in my stash.
---
My stash is just: 5 armor pieces, costumes, and junk.  Other stuff can be muled. Try making a mule for trading on r/fo76bazaar . 
---
Plus being melee gives me about a 300+ lb advantage. Carty weight + no ammo. So i understand im not burdened by things like: ammo types, multiple guns to manage ammo use, using too much steel/lead.
---
But that doesnt mean you cant manage your inventory solo, then ceise lootinng in multiplayer to share time doing the more fun parts of the game with friends.  Getting prepared early. 
---
Protip: once your are lvl 50 there, there are perks you should have access to that can make you an effective melee grinder. So you can melee when you are farming. You save bullets. Things like: radicool, party boy,  unyielding, mutations, etc. You can be a 1 ST build then buff your strength to 12 for farming. One shot ghouls. Just swich your deck up, farm melee, switch it back. You will be sitting on stacks of ammo for multiplayer time!
---
I would drop Can Do and throw that point into level 3 Bloody Mess. I'd also ditch Sneak &amp; Covert Operative and put 5 of those points into Gunsmith, otherwise your TSE is going to be breaking every 20 minutes.
---
Lastly, I don't see the point of getting Batteries Included on this build. I know it reduces Fusion Core weight, but that seems like a waste of 3 points if that's the only reason you're using it. You're probably better off getting at least 1-2 levels of Lockpick and a level of Hacker. There's a lot of good stuff locked behind high security doors.
---
Right next to white springs train station.
---
Cheap enough travel to watoga, can use vault 76 to travel to Grafton (if I can be bothered...usually just spend the caps) and of course can hit Blackwater mine and whitesprings.
---
Also conveniently almost always just outside the whitesprings nuke zone.
---
That I don‚Äôt know. Let me know 
---
How many Gatling Lasers were you carrying to be able to use that many cores?
---
Thanks! A nuke zone, I presume is self explanatory as areas that can be nuked by players. Can they not nuke any area that is not a nuke zone? And would that mean you can just stash everything in your inventory you don't want to lose before heading into a nuke zone? 
---
Correct. That is advice for future. For them to have killed you through slap you would of either had to use no healing or stood there? I'm just saying best bet is to walk away or run. Pop a stim and never engage
---
HOA is a bitch over there. 
---
Don't quote me on this because I'm usually hunting and not on The Wanted side of this equation, but I don't think it shows your name until you get really close. Once they have visual on you it will show a marker above your head. They can still however spam Vats and catch you on the screen depending on the lay of the land and their special stats. Still with the map being so big you'd be surprised how easy it is to get the jump on people.
---
What's your channel?
---
Yeah, sounds about right. I failed to mention how ridiculously widespread and difficult it is to monitor and act on all the various sellers out there. I do like that it points out there are games like Eve that have built this into the mechanics, and function really well.
---
Todd said the factional content will come after the initial launch and subsequent implementations and patches. Once they figure out how PVP makes sense, and implement a system (likely with factions) where pvp isn‚Äôt simply griefing and fighting over workshops, then i believe factional content will make a lot more sense and fit better. The interesting thing is, much like in FO4, you could possibly be on more than one faction, and some factional quests or loyalty would make you automatically enemies with other players. I think that a lot of buddies who didn‚Äôt play FO4 who are busting finding the ‚Äúhook‚Äù around level 15-20 take a bit to get used to the UI, crafting and general fallout-stuff (versus my buddies who wanted the multiplayer but prefer ES games, but not ESO) would be overwhelmed with factional content at release. I can‚Äôt wait for factional content though :) 
---
FIGHT FIGHT FIGHT FIGHT!!!
---
Good strategy! 
---
PC? ill challenge his ass
---
Awesome! I only asked because I read a comment about someone saying they lost their X-01 power armor, but I wasn't sure whether it was through a death or a crash.
---
I don't really see the problem with that. some people want this game to have a market for whatever fucking reason, how do you think that happens?
---
granted, $20 is way too fucking steep.
---
Play other games.  It is not a feature in this game.  Find a game to your taste.  Don‚Äôt cry about Raiders raiding.
---
üòÇüòÇ
---
Added you :)
---
Yeah, this was just one door to nowhere, and the owner didn't seem at all Old Lady Winchester, but we both agreed,  opening it was a bit WMH.
---
Or Takahashi's Castle, that Japanese game show with the human maze containing doors that opened to a drop into a mudpit.
---
We don't get that many channels here in the breakroom of the Wasteland Estates Homeowners Ass.
---
is the TS Tesla still available?
---
When you are maxed out on caps it's more about the principle of it and fun. 8N cap Bounty turns to 5 when you get close and then that gets split up between your 4-man team, it's obviously not about the money.
---
I disagree
---
I‚Äôve been playing since day one of the PC beta. I only got to level 45 last night. Did my first nuke zone at Whitesprings last night. Barely started the Enclave story. Haven‚Äôt touched the Brotherhood or Free States at all. Still doing the overseer‚Äôs personal quest. I‚Äôm having a blast just taking my time, exploring, and helping out new players. I can‚Äôt see myself quitting anytime soon. 
---
They need buffed bad
---
Simple tables. 
---
Well shit, sorry I'm not on this sub 24/7. /s
---
Well, I suppose he has to do something to make people want to PvP him...
---
If you're on PC you can have mine. I've never used it.
---
In the two characters I have made I have yet to come across mothman, besides the lighthouse one, I play almost entirely solo, i have come across the flatwoods monster once, never mothman though.
---
I did heavy/explosives. You can always build an offset of perk cards for melee later. You will live in PA (a major perk requires power armor). Power armor honestly doesn‚Äôt need repairing often and with the right perks, repairs are cheap, I do not roll with power patcher. 
---
https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=f634e86&amp;d=sq2sw2s22s32sr2pe2pq1pj0e52c72ib4ic4ip2s10a04s72l22lt2&amp;w=&amp;n=The Heavy
---
My build. I swap my Luck cards around a lot depending on what I‚Äôm doing, but it‚Äôs enough points all over to create a lot of flexibility.
---
The biggest weakness starting as a Heavy build is that it really doesn‚Äôt exist until late game. Almost no heavy weapons show up until at least the mid 20‚Äôs, lots of the related perks are 30+.... that‚Äôs part of why I took explosives, to have something to spec into while building up. 
---
Beyond that, with how spammy endgame is, explosives are kind of hard to find a lot of value in- crafting costs are high, damage just doesn‚Äôt feel high enough to justify it, scorchbeasts are extra resistant to explosives (lame). Heavy guns are quite viable but ammo hungry, and depending on the weapon can require more frequent repairs than others (50cal is okay, Gatling gun is great, the rest, especially energy weapons, will need a lot of repairs...)
---
But damn does it feel satisfying to just hose lead in that general direction. 
---
Gatling gun is generally considered the best choice, although it‚Äôs slow fire rate is both a strength and weakness. It is very ammo(and also thus repair) efficient, but the slow chunk chunk of its fire rate can be pretty blah. Currently the Martial Artist perk is bugged and speeds up its fire rate a lot (probably 30%, but I‚Äôve got an instigating +25% fire rate Gatling with a speedy receiver, it *feels* like MA multiplies with those and gives me about 50% faster!). It‚Äôs also really accurate, I think because of the slow fire rate- it has time to settle out most of the recoil, so it‚Äôs almost pinpoint even out to long range at ‚Äúfull auto‚Äù, which the 50cal certainly isn‚Äôt. I use the Gatling primarily, switching to the 50 at extreme close ranges or specific situations.
---
It's the Atom shop where you can preview all the items before buying them.
---
Yes it's OP but you also got to see that it's a 2SE Dragon with its damage multiplied to a player who will take full damage. Most guns and melee will one shot a player with a sneak bonus. 
---
You can be one shot with slap damage by legendary weapons afaik, and you can be pretty easily mowed down by high levels with legendaries as well. 
---
Not sure. It sure looks cool as hell though.
---
Explosive weapons lose their special projectiles. So something like a gatling plasma or cryolator will just shoot regular "bullet" projectiles that explode instead. Not sure if this makes them lose their effects (like the cryolator), but I've still seen enemies melt into a goo pile from my explosive gatling plasma
---
The real price you pay won't be the caps, but rather your enjoyment. Unless you get yourself something like an explosive 10mm pistol, the game will become wayyyy too easy
---
It's Blackwater Mine, and they cap out at level 40 glowing Mole Miners, but other than that it's solid advice. Also, the event guarantees 3 legendary mole men, so it's a great place to farm legendary gear without dealing with a nuke zone.
---
Flatwoods hotel, Charleston fire department both have gyms with lead weight. 
---
Paint cans provide a very surprising 5 lead a pop!
---
and of course. pencils! grab every damn pencil you see. 
---
That's not enough to cover limited items, we need a way to be able to earn more atoms via missions, quests, events and not daily. Also the weekly and some daily are tedious af to do and not worth the time, such as crafting 5 menstats,  that should of been worth 100 atoms for the amount of work it took.
---
Ah ok...would of been happy to help out if I could. Xbox here. 
---
I've done scorchbeast queen multiple times, she lags out a lot and someone in party always disconnects (I don't always disconnect, only about every few times we do it). I haven't ever gotten anything good from her as loot, and sometimes you can't loot her at all. You mostly do it for the achievement and for the extra legendary mobs that get summoned when you fight her.
---
Those ARE unfair. Absolutely.  
---
What Ichor is talking about is the same thing I found this reddit page to try to clarify: if we can use model replacers. Ie... a mod that would make the radiation suit look like this an armor you've made yourself.
---
If someone is shooting at you with an explosive weapon, get in close to melee range and stay there. They'll more than likely kill themselves as well if they shoot you again.
---
I believe that‚Äôs the consensus, yeah. I‚Äôd heard that a while back. Same thing with Explosive vents, although they might not actually be broken, just the baseline effect they‚Äôre supposed to enhance is broken. 
---
They range from 8-40 depending on your level or the level of whoever was most recently there.
---
You haven‚Äôt been briefed at all
---
Correct. The post however didn't mention this. He mentioned taking damage. I'm not popping at OP just saying that when you meet players like this you should out heal them and vacate asap. 
---
ahh I see
---
Easy killer.  I‚Äôve seen a lot of bounty hunters with big britches face down and light a few caps all because they got cocky.
---
Interesting idea. I think they could do a ton of different things. Imagine if you could enter a server where they had a battleground set up? By have a server dedicated to an all out battle and by removing the extra buildings and NPCs, I wonder if we can fit more players in a battle too.

[XB1] This issue might be funny for some but it can also be distracting and just shouldnt be happening. My character is a tough gal, not a stripper.

Pretty much all plans award from workshops are random. Some plans have some bias as to what workshop you get them from. The dumpster from a junkyard, generators from power plants, etc. 
---
I put them on top of large water purifiers. 
---
i just use those metal tower like things with the stairs.  They're about 1/2 foundation size.  They're in the defense tab
---
ok thanks, I will check again, to me it looked like you needed to complete all of them. If this is the case, this is acceptable ..
---
üòÇ unless he‚Äôs got an explosive weapon i‚Äôm not all too worried 
---
I have a cowboy hat, a duster, and a really nice BoS recon rifle... I will absolutely be the Mysterious Stranger for any lowbie I see having a rough go

I had one there also, eventually it did do the drop off. That is the only place where I have had trouble
---
The queen is good as it is. It's your fault if you go for her without enough group preparation before.
---
No you just loot her body. The first time you kill her you get plans for the shower guaranteed. After that there's chance for ultracite plans and legendaries. If it loads anything correctly anyway.
---
If they nuked every god-damned thing in my inventory the only thing I'd be sad about is my ultracite armor because my friends and I earned that shit the hard way. Barely made it through belly of the beast due to disconnects and other glitches. Still, I say scrap it all and ban dupers to their own servers where they have to try to sell each other their 900 TSE weapons for all eternity
---
Perhaps a better solution would be to not allow anybody below a certain level to join the event?
---
Stash box's work. Ugly af but they work.
---
The problem is that the items do not belong to the people selling them. We own the rights to play the game, however all of the intellectual property still rightfully belongs to Bethesda. It's also a shady practice due to conmen. Getting scammed out of caps by an illegitimate seller is one thing but it becomes theft if your scammed from real money. Just not worth it in the long run. 
---
So i think every Nuke does 500 damage now. Same way as the MIRV grenade.....
---
Are the shower plans on her or quest reward? I don‚Äôt remember seeing that on her
---
Enclave events, kill scorchbeasts, or legendary mobs. The event Leader of the Pack is great for legendary mobs, as you have to kill 3 of them. Same for Uranium Fever.
---
1) The action isn't really that great, at least on xbox. Particularly when you are running from an enemy and need to change weapons, it's way slow. You pretty much have to stop and get hammered with melee damage for a second.
---
2) There really needs to be more slots, or multiple select wheels (like one for weapons and one for aid). Between grenades and various weapons mine is already full. Even grenades could arguably have it's own wheel since it's a different action already.
---
Stimpacks are already hotkeyed which is nice sometimes but I probably hit it on accident more than I do intentionally. 
---
I use to be the same, got sick of rebuilding all the time lol. Now I go for resources, find a resource you need and set up camp over it. Junk farms are always good!
---
Links/pics plz

I had my first experience in a blast zone today, too. Level 46, so not exactly holding my own out there but I could 1v1 most things we came across. At one point I had just finished a long fight with a mutant, turn around and a lvl 78 dude is standing right behind me in power armor; I panicked and shot him. He must have realized I was just jumpy, cuz he just went on his way. Which was nice, cuz then I lived long enough to return the favor when a lvl 22 did the exact same thing  to me a minute later. 
---
Heavy explosives player. My sniper isn't great beans except to keep me alive by jumping and pummeling the ground (it's an IS Gauss) so I'm typically hitting the queen. 
---
But periodically I'll hit her with a Fat Man to give the melee players some breathing room. If there's a bunch up further away on someone, I'll spray them with 40mm grenades. 
---
Explosive players (real blast radius, not explosive weapons) need to keep an eye on others too to be of best use. 
---
On the left side of the map, above the mothman museum along the river is a junk pile I built by. Having a junk extractor is ridiculously useful, and whilst the area isn't that flat, I still built a 3x4 house there. 
---
Also has the added bonus of the river so you can place water purifiers.
---
Exactly this mindset. I mean, it‚Äôs the same thing in TF2. When I first started playing that I didn‚Äôt know shit. Couldn‚Äôt rocket jump, didn‚Äôt know what airblast was, wondered how my own team was killing me. But I met people in that game that *helped* me learn. If it wasn‚Äôt for them, I wouldn‚Äôt still be playing it to this day. And it‚Äôs that same reason why when I see somebody anywhere between 76 and Flatwoods, I‚Äôll always hang around and help them learn the game. From standing back and picking off enemies with a sniper when they‚Äôre being swarmed, or dropping them supplies to use. It makes me feel good. 
---
Sounds like an unsophisticated player.  You realize TSE is not the end all be all, right?  And that you may not be as capable compared to others.  Don‚Äôt get cocky.
---
Thanks, appreciate it!  And point taken on the loss of fun.  I‚Äôm going to focus on my alt for now.
---
It seems to drop the crash rate by about 90% I'd say. Can pickup  a bunch of them from my stash and not crash until the twentieth or so.
---
yep have 2 on me rn
---
I think these sales are Bethesda hoping it will boost the playerbase and keep it long enough for the bugs to be hammered out.
---
Games that stay at full price while being buggy are just destined to die or at least never thrive. This game has **a lot** of potential and if they can fix these major bugs, then I can see it really taking off.
---
However they do it, at least it's done server side so it should be an easy fix. Source: my wife on I play side-by-side and we hear the same music at the same time
---
&gt;stealing items and selling them for real money is not capitalist freedom.
---
I suppose having the sole, exclusive rights to manufacturing one type of good until the end of time with no one ever being able to compete against you using the same type of product is the ultimate capitalist freedom because copying is literally stealing.
---
I know, if only there were a search bar
---
I've been disconnected from server twice within the last hour of nearly completing this!!!!   FFFFaaaaakkkkk
---
That's as helpful as saying "To kill a scorchbeast, lower its health to 0 while keeping your health above 0." 
---
To be fair, I've gotten 10 cap wanted status completely accidentally several times. I usually ask someone to kill me to void it, but still.
---
I wouldn't attack someone unless their bounty is higher than 10.
---
Also:  Most Extreme Challenge!
---
What? no Ivory Grips?
---
The problem is that Bethesda decided to go into Macrotransactions too late. I mean look at Fortnite and GTA V.
---
So around 1700 damage dang
---
You can farm whitesprings as well. 
---
i‚Äôm not cocky, i‚Äôm just saying i‚Äôm not too worried about other players. what about wanting a little revenge is unsophisticated? what is there to be sophisticated about? pvp? 
---
Im finally back and I can try to get the outfit. I did some event quests but I got nothing so far.
---
Why did you create new chars to farm for the outfit? Do you think the chance is higher?

The cliffs give a great view of the forest :)

Into it. 
---
So, I agree that at present, the atom shop isn't awful for players.
---
But hear me out for second.
---
The point of a cash shop, theoretically, is for the developers to make money outside base game sales, right?
---
And right now, as you and everyone else says, the Atom Shop prices are only balanced out by the fact that you can earn a decent amount of atoms in game.
---
Likely because you can earn atoms in game, if you want to purchase them, the dollar to atom ratio is... Really just not very good. That's what people are actually complaining about in the cash shop.
---
I guarantee a vast majority of the people who defend this current cash shop by saying you can earn atoms in game don't actually plan on spend any money, but instead plan on saving up their achievement and daily rewards to purchase what they want.
---
This is a little troublesome, as the cash shop is no longer a cash shop anymore, it's effectively an achievement store. That's not really a problem in and of itself... But it doesn't change the fact that people feel like they can't get good value for their money when buying atoms directly.
---
So... I think the cash shop is a mess.  But not really for the reasons people usually complain about.
---
I still have yet to find the Vault Beds i learned day 1
---
nope. console can't be enabled. I looked into it myself.
---
I'll say something that'll definitely get downboated, but it's the truth- I play on both PC and PS4 and the PC playerbase is a *lot* larger. less kids, too. the PC playerbase is also a lot more... ahem, prolific. competitive? or just competent. it's just how it is.
---
the market for in-game goods for PC is also a lot larger. you can buy basically anything on PC, whereas finding less popular legendaries on PS4 is a pain.
---
don't know about X1.

Right Eve is game that has done it well (since it‚Äôs accepted by the community). There‚Äôs also games that haven‚Äôt done it well (like Diablo 3‚Äôs real money auction house). I think it‚Äôs a gameplay issue and just depends on how the developer implements the main player trade system. You have games like FFXIV where you can‚Äôt trade anything good and every equip comes from raids - and I think that‚Äôs fine. Companies would just revise their game to prevent RMT since pretty much the most that they can do is ban you.
---
So you‚Äôre saying my 1400+ damage melee build is the reason why we failed? Had nothing to do with being surrounded by low levels? I swear the highest level there besides me was a 45. 
---
Flat wood monster comes in 3 forms. Flatwood (lvl30), fabled flatwood (lvl 40) and mythical flatwood (lvl 50).
---
This is why I don't like how overencumberedness is handled. 
---
Maybe up to 25 or 50 over, you can fast travel with a progressive and substantial cost penalty. After that you take periodically damage and drain thirst hunger faster. 
---
The idea that you go one over unavoidably and then logically get to go "fuck it, time to go ham" is idiotic. And yet you'd be stupid not to do it right now if you really can't drop any of your first 200 weight or so because the game incentivises this. 
---
Lmaooooo
---
I'm level 98. I spend my junk faster than I can collect it so I'm ok.
---
I'm doing heavy weapons so I need to stash some cause they are heavy, bunker buster is 40lbs, nukes are 6lbs a pop, missiles are 2-3lbs, grenades are also pretty heavy. I stash condiments, bunch of costumes and junk, mods i might need...
---
And France's flag so you can surrender.
---
Awesome, great tips. One last question. In your experience, should class freak be ***ranked or can I get away with * or **?
---
The game is like 6 weeks old.  I wouldn‚Äôt expect them to roll out hundreds of items right off the bat.  Even if they did, people would just shit bricks about it because they put time and effort into micro transactions when they game still has work needed.  Hell, people already crucified them for including Atom shop fixes and upgrades in patches.
---
I anticipate this will be like Little Big Planet or any other game with buy-in cosmetics, it‚Äôll start slow and end up with some sprawling library by adding on for a few years.
---
Im set up underneath the electric tower next to whitesprings station. Its close enough to do what i need during nukes, repairs and stashing stuff, yet far enough that when people nuke they typically miss it
---
I have not seen this suggested, its a good idea, better than just dumping it. But it would make the game a little too easy I think.
---
Looking for a fix? THE ATOMIC SHOP IS HERE FOR YOU....R MONEY!
---
Awesome!  Thanks for taking the time to reply :)
---
We're already friends lol!
---
In the Savage Divide there‚Äôs lots of flat cliffs with great views, and the more central you are the less caps you pay for certain areas. Although most spots there don‚Äôt have resources nearby, you can still make it work. I‚Äôve set up on the hills between New Gad and Whitesprings.
---
The reliance on TSE is what made your post unsophisticated.  Reliance on a Flavor of the month weapon is just a rubies, plebeian thing to do.
---
seems it just expired.
---
The bans where from people using cheat engine and cheating mods 
---
They are all separate i think, maybe PC and Xbox share but i doubt it, maybe someone else is more in the know on that.
---
i use the suitcase stash depending on the hight, or a bookcase

 No I missed that one. ;)

Wanna launch a nuke together?

Douche canoe who's......lol
---
Today I was just exploring Charleston and suddenly this green cloud of dust just covered everything. Also it brought some radiation with it. Immediately, I felt so immersed in the game, having to take shelter under a rooftop while the sudden rad storm blew over.
---
Not really. I've got 500+ hours logged and have come across many players wishing to pvp. Majority with 2SE weapons and a handful with 1-Shot outside pvp. The 1-Shots, sure they kill you. The others however have always been able to be outhealed. Again I'm not taking a dig at the OP. I'm trying to offer up some help. The OP never mentioned he was one shot. 
---
Yeah except if the company actually cares they can just change the ToS and make that activity prohibited, and then ban all the accounts.
---
I just turn my radio off. And the soundtrack. Complete immersion that way, not knowing if I‚Äôm actually safe or not. Unless I crotch...
---
Good point.
---
who said i rely on TSE? i don‚Äôt even have a TSE myself. i‚Äôm all 2 handed baby. and if u haven‚Äôt gone up against other players using TSE, it‚Äôs certain death. pvp is useless. 
---
Police me if you can, I‚Äôm the raider that this side of West Virginia needs.
---
I could go for that.
---
I've started always launching the game as an Administrator, seems to make it slightly better.
---
Oh right lol; I should have checked your username haha. Sorry bud.
---
I live atop Seneca Rocks. It puts me inside the mountain. Fortunately, someone at BGS put floors of ground inside it, so I walked under my buildable area, and built foundations extending outside the rocks (it let me walk out but not in) and then stairs up. Over time, I found the mountain inner floor was mostly dirt, so I put crops and purifiers there and some oil lamps. After two weeks the game stopped dropping me in there, so I had to reset the camp, but it was fun having a glitch farm for a while. I wish I'd tried to move the actual camp in there now. 
---
Yep, a few execptions in my inventory but wouldn't cry about it
---
they can nuke any area they want and the only thing you can lose is junk when you die only your junk gets drop so no need to worry about weapons or aid. 
---
Well, there's ultracite frame if i remember correctly.
---
Is he dead.....?
---
Also the more you allow people to "get their hits in" to get loot you introduce more legendary's into the market, by nature lowering the value of the economy to make it "low level friendly" and inclusive. It's the ultra poor mans duping. 
---
Yeah I'm actually a big fan of the concentrated fire (bonus accuracy and damage with subsequent vats hits) and luck critical shots using vats. Using low ap automatic weapons actually increases crit bar by same amount per shot. With a full crit bar you get bonus damage/no miss headshots at any distance.
---
I like to start with a crit headshot for guaranteed damage at a distance then follow that up with high percentage automatic weapons shots due to concentrated fire - which in turn generates another crit. If you also have grim reapers sprint you can have a good chance to get all your AP back as well when you get a kill in vats.
---
Need to have decent agility, perception, and luck for the above though.
---
there's no upper limit to how many fusion cells can be loaded, so when the head gets reloaded it will take all of the cell sin your inventory... though in theory the damage output goes up relative to how many fusion cells it consumed
---
Maybe there will be ‚Äûthe hub‚Äú a place where everyone can trade and has place to trade
---
Because I am not too sure about having everybody know my camp location - mine was destroyed by other players for shits and giggles twice before 
---
Sweet, thank you.
---
very small LUL you are a funny guy do you know how many nukes i have been though at whitespring and people are fucking douchebags, not a SMALL a very LARGE number, it also happens in events with legendarys all the time.... im not missing out on my items while busting my ass just because some douche cant use a normal weapon for one event like i was doing for the first month and a half of playing and letting everyone get in on them\
---
TSE .50 call ruins your day when those scorched close the distance
---
Check out Flatwoods Church and Camp MkClintock for some water purifier plans. And do Powering Up Poseidon event a few times to get the generators.
---
I sure hope they make this a thing sooner than later... I'm gonna sell tons of cheap cranberry relish and modded 10mms for noobs and then make a killing on the rare plans to high lvls. 
---
Or the rarest of rare items.... Company tea lol
---
My Two Shot Mirv Fatman went from 900 to 300, I'm assuming each of the smaller explosions do less damage but over a wider area and maybe can hit multiple times.
---
What are you expecting?
---
I've been at it the last hour and a half.....keep getting disconnected at different points and it restarts you.  I don't think it's funny at all........
---
Do quests and events
---
What about your crotch?  Itch?
---
Where is that event at?
---
TSE is nothing to be afraid of.  Come Raid with us we will show you the way.
---
yea but if they are wanted and you shoot them thru a open window you become wanted, such a joke
---
South of Vault 76 at Poseidon Power Plant. And I edited the first part I said Flatwoods Church but I remembered that is the water pump, the purifier is at Charleston.
---
Once you set up a good camp, and get the water purifier plans from (I think the overseer?) or someone early on in the game, you can get purified water easily. Near Morgantown airport, in the corner of the runway, left if you‚Äôre coming from the building, there is a farm. It has corn, tatos, pumpkins, and just up the hill there is some mutfruit. Combining corn, tatos and mutfruit gives you vegetable starch which can be scrapped for adhesive. Radaway is hard earlygame, but soon you‚Äôll find a ton, and it won‚Äôt be a problem. I‚Äôve thrown away almost 100 radaway, and I still have 50 between me and my stash.
---
I don't think that maps accurate. Like Whitesprings is included in the forest zone and we know that high levels can spawn there (so it's not 1-10).
---
He looks like giddy up buttercup 
---
Is it a bad thing to have them aggro? More bags of xp and loot right?  Unless you're counting on them to kill the ghouls?  I'm considering hopping up to that roof by the parking lot that also overlooks the main entrance.  They can't climb up their either.  I could see a downside being its hard to loot them since they keep respawning tho...
---
Thanks man I'll head over there in a bit!
---
Just don't leave your mic on while munching loudly on chips *cringes*
---
The Scorched drop RadAways and diluted, RadX and diluted. Check all first aid and chem boxes for purified water. Also try to set up a couple small water purifiers in your camp. Morgantown should have chems all over it.
---
I feel the same way about crashes. It sucks but isn't the end of the world for me. Game is so freaking fun for me it just feels like speed bumps.
---
Being able to readily forgive wanted players would greatly reduced the infuriating 10 cap bounties running around uncertain whether they can play normally or randomly get walloped by someone hundreds of levels above. 
---
Every time I see one in the mid range they look at me all twitchy. Relax, I'm not going to gun you down for 20 caps. It was probably something stupid. 
---
I didn't call anyone an asshole. The loot system is what it is until they adjust it, which probably will not happen. There is an easy way to not screw other people over nuke zones. You can drop your damage down by removing perk cards or use a "tag" weapon. People who refuse to do either and blame the game are just using that as an excuse for being toxic. You know you are pissing everyone off, you know there's an easy solution, yet you refuse to do it and then blame the game. 
---
I am guessing that they are going to make it so you get a bounty and are hostile when you loot another bag. They should make it red like in the other games too.
---
I dont even bother to fight if there isnt a core team of better geared players that show up. I would check to see who is on before deciding to launch a nuke for the queen event. 
---
Two Shot Explosive
---
Oh wow okay, I was struggling before and even having 3 was a life saver for me.
---
I think people were actually banned for using cheat engine/reshade though
---
That‚Äôs my thought process.  They don‚Äôt expect you to buy a power armor skin for $18.  They expect people to have 1400 atoms from gameplay, see a limited edition skin, and spend the extra $4 to get it.  I figured that was the con from day one, to get people thinking ‚ÄúI‚Äôm almost there, it‚Äôs just an extra couple bucks.‚Äù  
---
That‚Äôs why you get atoms in game too.  If I didn‚Äôt get atoms in game, I‚Äôd never check the shop.  I don‚Äôt plan on spending money on it, why would I even look?  But I log in and I see I‚Äôve got 650 atoms, maybe I check the shop to see what‚Äôs there.  Maybe I see a sofa I like, but it‚Äôs 700 atoms.  Maybe they get that $1 that they wouldn‚Äôt have ever seen if I hadn‚Äôt been given freebies to get me in the door.
---
Two words... Tesla rifle.
---
I recommend stealthing and then teleporting.  I know my raider crew is pretty persistent and will hunt people until they change servers in the hopes of draining all their caps.
---
Events and daily quests shower you with stimpaks, purified water, and rarer materials like ballistic fiber, crystal, black titanium, etc. Also, just go at your own pace and explore each area you pass through thoroughly. You will have more of everything than you know what to do with before you know it
---
I guess just 1k for time 
---
British, but hi! 
---
I‚Äôll check it out thanks
---
Then don‚Äôt pay? Do you even economy, bro?
---
"There can only be one" bring it
---
Matte pink with black glitter!
---
Not that I was aware of - which one would that be? Did a quick google of perk cards but didn't see anything
---
What's duping?
---
Two shot exploding
---
Seems to work. I have used a few of those smaller round tables. Stacking them was a bit tricky but I saved it as a blueprint.
---
Oh, and claiming a workshop will drop plans as a reward, and more after successful defenses. You can claim more than one workshop.
---
that's not how the game works. you can't create items out of thin air because that information is server-sided.
---
duping relies on that very fact, that the server stores your information and takes too long to send/receive packets. it'
---
There hasn't been a single proven case, just around 80 people who claim they were and for the most part were called out on their bullshit, it's all clickbait.
---
From what I read the problem was folks running OP builds just OHK legendary stuff in nuke zones.  Not sure where the leeching thing comes from.
---
All the hair styles are BAD :(
---
Yeah this still doesnt exist after 3 months. good fucking luck trying to google bench locations
---
People were legitimately banned though, that‚Äôs why bethesda released an official statement
---
Could be a mod seen lits of people on pc using mods already, just because one avenue is blocked it does not mean all are
---
Manchildren playing with make-believe-currency haha. 
---
Do you actively avoid using ANY ingame currencies in games to avoid being a "man child". 
---
The game has caps as currency. The items are designed to be traded for caps. Not real currency, that is written in the TOS. 
---
The market people want is for fair exchange of caps. It's widely known already that people hate that the game has over priced "cosmetic" micro transactions. You think the market they want is a "pay to win" system after the voices cried out about cosmetics. 
---
It comes with mirv
---
While the 2 shot explosive weapons are well the meta there really isn‚Äôt in my opinion a ‚Äúbest‚Äù weapon, it‚Äôs more of what type of weapon you use and of how you tailor your build to.
---
Been playing most days since the PC beta, gained around 500 dupe free levels across 10 players but stopped just before new years after the, maybe 10th disconnect clearing a silo burning mountains of ass-grinding ammo (at level 15 solo).
---
The pain/gain threshold has been breached and cleared. 
---
It may look yummy again after a couple of BO4 sessions though ...
---
This game really needs a chatbox. 
---
Yup.  I'm a super casual solo player who's only hit level 28 and I already feel like I got my money's worth.
---
Use the wood wall with the windows. Open window, string wire through or, coat window again. Bam! Wire through the walls. 
---
If you don't want to PvP why did you buy a game that has PvP as part of the core game? This was explained pre-launch so you have only yourself to blame for buying something that was clearly outlined and then being pissed off that it is there.
---
Ghouls was an ok source for radaway for me when i started out. When you get abit further you will find plenty I think. Im lvl 15 now, and I have lots now
---
They were banned, just not for using reshade or modding, they were banned for cheating and/or toxic behavior. 
---
Just made a new character, don't want handouts so I don't interact with other players.
---
I‚Äôll try to take one later, but the easiest way to actually see it (considering I don‚Äôt have it), is go to the Atomic shop, look at the atomic explosion lamp, go to the right to the actual pictures of it, and you‚Äôll see the table. It‚Äôs a really small, thin table, tall, with a square top. The set of tables look like they‚Äôre made of wrought iron or something. 
---
Table plans I‚Äôve bought so far are:
---
Antique tables: I think it was 300
---
Elegant tables: one was 330
---
Elegant tables: this one was 700 something (wanna say 770)
---
Rustic tables: 300 (forgot the exact price)
---
It's fun, but I refrain from using my explosives unless I see someone being truly bodied. 
---
I'm specced into it and so I do massive damage, but I feel horrible watching everyone trying to find where the bodies flew off to. 
---
Lmao I was around the same level when I got the same quest. A couple of high levels came over and I thought they were gonna help me. Instead they took the workshop while I was fighting a scorchbeast then killed me 
---
You expect them to make it easy to earn enough currency to bypass paying money?  That‚Äôs pretty counter productive to having a successful micro transactions system.  Which is the entire point of the Atom shop.
---
it's not uncommon to find that people making money through illegitimate means are doing so because they can't seem to make any honest money.
---
What level are you? I'm level 72, but I've been making this same run for about 20 levels now, in power armor. At worst, I have to burn a stimpack or two.
---
You need the 2 perk cards. I think you need at least 5 but I don't know that's just something somebody else said.
---
It say you get Xp per member of your team at rank 1. If you in a team and share you Get Xp and Caps from when you teammates finish missions or events. I don‚Äôt think work for every Kill. It is under charisma.
---
great tip. Thanks.
---
Lol i liked laying out all the ghouls from the clubhouse legless on the lawn

what's the problem with oneshotting mobs? unless somebody wants to leech off my kil.

that's what I meant. or should I gimp myself so other people can get a hit in? fuck that.
---
Probably a wise decision. Still frustrating that I need to round up some strong players to even have a chance to kill her, especially considering I play solo :(
---
It weighs 3.3 and allows you to carry +5, so you come out ahead on that. Plus it can replace whatever melee weapon you are using, so that up to 20 pounds you can get rid of.
---
like I said, mods can't generate items because that'

Click bait title! As a sniper I came in here fully expected to be offended! 
---
I hope it puts a marker on the map indicating Camps.  I hope I can destroy player vendors and loot them for the stuff and caps.
---
Lol least lvl 50 and you best be making a adhesive farm quick for those weapons 
---
Events will frequently give you purified water and stimpacks, and occasionally radaway. It's a great way to horde that kind of stuff until you get a good water purifier.
---
Meh, I have it and I wasn't that impressed. I've heard that it's effective when all the smaller frags hit, but I haven't been impressed so far. 
---
Make it so that the SBQ targeting priority is the weakest link. *Cough, those level 5s.*
---
I support this. 
---
&gt;1 3* I find to be better than a bunch of 1*s
---
Er..
---
1 3* Slugger is 20%.
---
3 1* Slugger is 30%.
---
I would disagree.
---
I've only found my jetpack/shocks after hopping. 
---
Everytime I‚Äôve PVP‚Äôd a wanted player they died almost instantly.
---
Why did you come in through the window? The door was unlocked...
---
I‚Äôve never crashed with my charging shotgun Tesla that‚Äôs odd
---
I like the game but its borderline unplayable. The only thing ruining this game is the game. 
---
Whoever this person was, needs to be banned from playing online. Not just this game. ALL of them. PVP is one thing. This is just purposefully setting out to make others miserable for no other reason than to do it, and should never be tolerated. 
---
If I was that kid's parent - or therapist, who probably spends more time with them anyway - I would go out of my way to ensure they didnt play video games any longer.
---
Ahh, naive child...
---
Except it totally ruins the trade economy, which was already terrible, and flooding the market with TSE weapons ruins PvP, which was already terrible.

Two of the small bookshelves usually work fine for turrets.

Feel free to point out some non-cosmetics that are currently available in the store.
---
So server hopping does work then.  Good good to know.  
---
What's your platform? You can have mine if you're on ps4.
---
I'm sure it's randomly set per server per hop. I jumped for over a days worth and no shocks at the watago station, then I found 4 shocks within 9 jumps. The RNG is real.

..lol kinda like an Easter egg hunt...u kill them all I'll hide them with my grenades then u can try to find them lmfao

100% solo since beta. üëçüèº

Just hearing the name makes me think of Borderlands

Spent way too long in that game

That‚Äôs probably my favorite solution. That‚Äôll teach em not to go to cranberry bog before they even get to Flatwoods.

That‚Äôs the good thing about having a tse gauss rifle. If I immediately shoot and don‚Äôt charge and hit the ground instead of directly I can tag them for most of their health and let the lower levels around me finish them off for xp

My foundation itself is a good 3 feet tall... you‚Äôd have to have a mutation or something to make it.

I'll be honest, I think 5 is all I had the patience to take over, so you're probably right. I was already spending almost half my time defending them.

I mean, none of the Fallout maps are accurate to how they are in the real world. If you took the map of the Mojave and overlaid am actual map of California and Nevada on it, [you can see that the towns aren‚Äôt where they actually are.](https://imgur.com/gallery/3bTSwVA) There‚Äôs other places, like Sloan, that don‚Äôt match up either. And with the overlay, you can see that the I-15 would be all over the place.  
---
Hmm I guess I did forget to record that, but I can confirm that when I took that part off it still doesn't show up.
---
Well you are one of the nice ones. I'm talking about the not nice ones. If I see an entire mob of ghouls die before I can draw my weapon and I hear an explosive weapon being used it's going to piss me off. I'm glad you are a nice person. but many are not. I just don't even use my explosive weapon around WS at all any more. 
---
I suppose I shouldn't make assumptions... but "non-American English speaker" is a bit wordy
---
Thankyou to any Bethesda Devs reading this. Fantastic game, been a Fallout fan for years. My team and I spent a few days preparing for what would be our first nuke. Went through the whole lengthly proccess together and finally nuked Whitesprings. It was awesome untill 5mins in the blast zone the server disconnected.  I was determined to play through all the issues, Fallout has been a big part of my life.  Sadly Im done with this game untill its fixed if it ever is.
---
first of all I'm not a kid. second these are just my wish list. not a give me or else crap.  
---
so chill out dude, let people have their opinion.  
---
Oof that sucks sorry I'm all out of ideas now :(
---
Two shot explosive weightless [insert your favorite gun here]
---
Don‚Äôt go swimming in the Mire, kids. 
---
Yes with an if. No with a but. 
---
Basically I have a list of items I keep an eye out for. I will do my rounds at all the vendors making m y sales. Always sure to hit my most sought first. The X0jet pack and good weapon plans from Grafton vendors. 
---
After I complete my rounds I will do one event and if there‚Äôs nothing else going on I‚Äôll stop playing for 15 minutes to an hour and then hop back on. 
---
Sometimes I luck out and there‚Äôll be something sometimes no. But I don‚Äôt do more than two hops s day. Otherwise I‚Äôm playing a game of chance and it‚Äôs not what I really want to be doing. 
---
Whether thats how the game works or not your missing the entire point of the post. Between Ps4 and Xbox SOMEONE wouldve gotten one of these paints by now, and yet its only been PC players who have advertised having them. Which coincidentally is the platform best suited to be getting items out of the game files that are unobtainable atm.
---
maybe check the entire threads here full of hate for the guy. I personally haven't ever watched him, and after reading this sub I'm pretty sure I've made the right choice.
---
The door I came across was locked at level 3 and I only have lvl1 lockpicking.
---
If you immediately left the server and were wearing excavator power armor with your house next to slocum joes in the Forrest north of the overseers camp, I apologize. I wasn't gonna greif. I liked your setup too.

I always get a bounty when I accidentally shoot the base of someone who is wanted, fml
---
Hey,   
---
Try to craft the antibiotics in one of the cooking stations outside of your camp, make sure you have the recipe.
---
I crafted those once, had to unequip the perk card and re-equip it again 
---
Leeching normally implies folks want to do nothing, in this case they want to do something yet are blocked by OP boomstick OHK boss critters.  Your joining a public horde event after all.
---
Now if your taking folks that hide wearing hazmat and just toss the occasional aoe to tag in for mass exp/loot I'm with ya.
---
Oh yes - you mean [Inspirational](http://fallout.wikia.com/wiki/Inspirational) I think. It does give you bonus XP - but I meant EXP for kills by teammates in the same area. You are correct also that you will get XP, Caps, and rewards for group events.
---
Basically my suggestion was to avoid some of the annoyance of having to "tag" enemies before a teammate kills them to get exp.
---
I THOUGHT the other one marks enemies FOR the orbital strike but now I'm thinking it just marks enemies, period
---
Depends on how difficult they make it to get the caps. If a wall or 20 has to go, I'll get them out of the way. 
---
It's not like it costs the person a lot to repair them. It doesn't destroy anything, all you have to do is press two buttons and it's back. Be more careful and stop blaming others for your fuckups. The community is not going to protect you.
---
Yeah and when you build a gorgeous house but you spawn in the water and get a disease every time you fast travel. OP we could get around this issue by fast traveling in Power Armor but lord knows how much a of an annoyance that is 
---
Its supposed to be fun, doesn't haven't to be used like everyone else. Ill waste hundreds of nukes if it pisses you off.
---
Oh it's all good. I have odd hours myself, usually after 10pm est... Unless I remote to work then all daytime long lol
---
Could be destroyed by a mob previously so they can be hard to see if its inbedded into the ground. 
---
I also noticed how by randomly picking up junk, ammunition gets removed from my inventory 
---
And like you said it‚Äôs not sneaky but very open about it. &gt;;(
---
Cant say what happened to your sniper rifle (maybe dropped it by accident, maybe a bug). But the ammo being taken is not actually be taken, look at what type of ammo is taken when it is, its always of the weapon u have equipped and when u recently fired, basically its just info messages that shouldnt normally appear that are appearing, removing ammo that you have recently used, normally occurs when u pick up another item, ie. the gold watch, or flowers or something.

This is whats working for me, I switch between refractor and glowsight.
---
Did they have two shot guns? Or was it a normal player who was probably wanted on accident

I think *you*'re missing the point. it's simply not possible.

either console players haven't put in enough hours or, more realistically, you just haven't found one with said paintjobs yet.

Would you please explain what PSA means?
---
The Overseer crate at McClintock has the large, industrial purifier plans.

You seem very angry. And not the type of person I‚Äôd want to play with. I did my first nuke zone last night. By myself. At level 44. Yeah, I was getting fucked over. But a very nice level 96 saw me and let me tag everything that I could while they were fighting. I was able to level up because of them. Remind me to not do zones if you‚Äôre near them, I guess. 
---
I find so many middle aged women playing fallout more than any other game. It‚Äôs great having a diverse community
---
I'm trying to be as good as I can. Go around helping new players by helping in quests, giving them stimpacks, the works. I've had to play about 30~ hours of the game by myself, so I want others to know that there's always a friend out there somewhere to help. And maybe it'll even encourage them to help out other players someday, who knows.
---
O my bad

Being a super mutant would be fun too! And going on mic and talking like one would be even better. Confuse the lot of people in your area and make them fear you, and fear being eaten. :)

I hope we get to be a ghoul.

When a currency no matter what is used to trade for an item. A monetary denomination exchanged for services or goods whether real or not it becomes a market. If I spend days farming fluxes to sell to the player base for X amount of caps. I have created a market. Supply and demand. However no where in the legal world is the sale of someone else's property "a market" nope that's the "black market" so if you want to do this go ahead. You have your black market.

Ah those dang horrible bridges. But there's so many! Where? You know, so I know where to avoid.

It‚Äôs like the recon scope it will tag enemies in its scan range

If you do the event at the lighthouse you can meet a friendly Wise Mothman who will hang around long enough to let you take a selfie with him. 
---
Its possible to mod the game on PC, why isnt it possible to get things out of the files then? I think you dont even know what your talking about or your one of the ones doing it and trying to down talk the truth. All i'm doing in my post is asking for proof that someone has proof that these are actaully obtainable on PS4.
---
She has 35000 HP and everyone else there probably hits for 50-100
---
It sounds like you have some duped items. You can hold on to them but I personally recommend scrapping since you more than likely can't use any of it for some time
---
People tend to place things there to help out newer players. That mixture of items is a little odd, but you didn't do anything wrong.
---
Nah. That would (probably) be from a duper that for whatever reason decided to be nice to a new player instead of selling for an ungodly price. 
---
What's a TSE? I'm not familiar with that
---
This sounds like you found a dupers stash 
---
The nuka grenades are wayy.... better.
---
Also if you look another players things you will be told you are wanted
---
That‚Äôs what I‚Äôm thinking 
---
You're right about the cannibals. I was more disagreeing with the part about kids being wendigos. I may have mixed up the gourmand key quest with something else, as it's been a while since I've played, but the quest definitely implies the cannibals turned into wendigos
---
This is basically what I've been looking for for my first character(got the game not too long ago) thanks man
---
Exactly 
---
What does TSE mean
---
&gt;Your joining a public horde event after all.
---
that's the thing though, I play solo. and I think this echoes a lot of Fallout players that play 76 despite it being online, not because of it.
---
fuck everyone else. this isn't ESO, it's not a full-fledged online experience. give us private servers already.
---
Yeah that‚Äôs pretty much how it went except they were all distracted tag teaming trying to kill like 3 scorched. 
---
Switch to a different gun and try killing them with that. It's a weird instance bug not directly linked to a particular gun 
---
I hate how accurate this is
---
Hate to break it to you but the code pieces have pretty much no value.  In order to launch, all you need is a nuclear keycard and big enough balls to get to the control panel.  The codes for all 3 silos are usually available online within hours of being reset for the week.
---
Whoever's on top is "stingy". When XBox was spanking PS3, Microsoft wouldn't allow cross-play. Now the tides have turned.
---
There's no value to silo codes since multiple people can get them.
---
Sorry.
---
This is objectively not true
---
You didnt steal, a lot of people drop free stuff for new players outside the vault. by the looks of it all that stuff was duped (duplicated by a bug) tho 
---
Also if caps are an issue I can supply some caps so people can move their camp
---
Forgive me but what is TSE
---
Weird
---
You can claim that. But we saw how PC was able to manipulate the game files in the beta.
---
it was all a joke, tesla rifle, tesla model 3... double entendre... I'm sad I have to explain this.
---
I got a level 35 war drum with instigating and +40% power attack damage. I'm still using it at level 80 because it fucking wrecks most creatures in 1 shot. 
---
Well, that almost sounds exactly like me, right down to the walls and location. But my door is always kept unlocked. *Just close it when you leave for the love of Atom.* 
---
I have only found two people with mics in game out of all of my time playing the game. I constantly talk through the mic to randoms and they never even seem to recognize I‚Äôm talking 
---
We will pretend you mentioned what system you play on. 
---
I usually just crouch and look at the floor with my gun out 
---
If on Xbox message phat dastard anytime lol
---
do you even know how online games work? yes, you can mod CLIENT-side data, not SERVER-side data.
---
you can't tell the game to spawn things, including items, because that's handled by the SERVER, not the CLIENT.
---
Fellow Missourian? 
---
I did say GT right?
---
No this is happening when I am running no creatures to shoot at. While I am running. This just happened 1 minute befor posting was running to sutton station and I saw the message " 10 shells removed gold pocket watch added" 
---
Eh, at that point probably want char locked offline mode instead.  Getting a DC from solo play would be quite annoying.
---
33. I can take enemies of that level from stealth, but once I get swarmed I'm usually forced to retreat. I think I should try to hit them in power armour. Worst case scenario is I have to do some repairing. I'll give it a go this evening.
---
I usually search for beginners guides rather than review vids. That way youre actually seeing content and get a bit of knowledge out of it rather than listening to someone trying to cash in on clickbait
---
The feed in the upper left will display the last thing on it when certain things happen. I've noticed the same thing. I'll pick up some thing and it will say 2 
---
.45 rounds removed, followed by Iron ore added. I removed 2 rounds when I reloaded the weapon earlier. So it's not randomly adding or taking anything. It's just a stale feed. 
---
As for your rifle randomly disappearing it is possible that you scrapped or dropped it accidentally. The former being the most likely. It happened to me early on a few times, not paying attention and scrap it. It's happened to a lot of players. But it is possible that it really did vanish, as I have seen other posts where that happened. Seems to have something to do with being disconnected or lagging out. 
---
I'm only level 38 but I dropped some level 12 guy stimpacks and armour today.
---
Feelsgoodman
---
Use the force Luke
---
And that's totally fair and absolutely makes sense.  I guess on PC it's not that bad, but I can see how on console using the system is annoying af.
---
I honestly can't blame these people for doing what they do. Bethesda allows it and it's going to be like this until they fix it(if they even can.) In the meantime, these cheaters are still playing the game, logging in hours, and boosting FO76's numbers which makes Bethesda appear to have a real, profitable game to TTWO investors. 
---
Is that specific to Xbox around here? I assumed it was a coke/soda situation used interchangeably.  My mistake. I retract the previous snarky comment. 
---
amen.

You know what, I'll bite. Yes. And you know why? Because every day this clusterfuck shambles along is another day further into the future before any chance of an actual Fallout 5 coming to fruition appears.

You and your friends have a plethora of choices for multiplayer and survival from dozens of companies, indie and AAA, across the industry. Modders, by contrast, have this franchise, and TES. So without putting too fine a point on it, sod off.

Awesome! Thanks!

Was tired of my camps spot being taken, and found a nice little deposit of stuff I've needed

read my words: you can't manipulate server-sided data.

I get genuinely envious when I see posts like this. I've never encountered any especially positive interactions in my many hours playing this game. For me, nuke zones have only ever consisted of scattered high-level players w/o mics all across the zone silently slaughtering everything like machines.

1. What platform are you playing on? **PS4**  
---
2) Gamertag/PSN/Bethesda.net account **writing this on behalf of a friend**
---
4) Description of the issue (what happened, where did it occur, what did it affect, quest name etc.) 
---
**During the quest "Early Warnings" a friend of mine and I were playing and had collected the correct number of items needed to craft and complete the mission. I was able to get an adequate number of parts in order to craft and complete the mission. While the friend I was playing with showed that he only collected 4/5 of the parts needed to complete the quest (even though he collected 5/5). Now he is unable to move forward with the quest and in the game as a result. He has since submitted a ticket to Bethesda and their bots replied with only a manual on how to walk through the mission. It appears he needs to have the mission reset, but after three unsuccessful attempts with submitting tickets, there has been no support in resolving the issue. I can relate to his frustration and I'm trying to do my best to help him get this resolved. I've asked him for his ticket number and listed it below. Is there any advice on how to get this resolved for him?   THANKS!**

weigh 1lb each do marginally more damage than frag grenades
---
Nuka grenades or pumpkin nades are monumentally better 
---
Check if you have dobly atmos set on your xbox if so turn off. sometimes there are issues with different audio sources!
---
No problem my guy the word GT is quite vague
---
I got tired of dealing with the rads from food/drink, so I went with Lead Belly perk Rank 3 under Endurance. That got rid of the early worry of not having enough Radaway. 
---
Luckily I found someone duping a quad exploding double barrel with reload speed, it's stupid good without two shot
---
Totally forgot about this and it helps me immensely with my explosive "tag everything" shotgun
---
If you leave a zone and go back, the bodies will be where they were when they died, not where they were sent after the fact.
---
I know it doesn't solve the problem of finding all of them, but you can at least search in the areas where things were being killed instead of trying to figure out if they flew over a wall somewhere. 
---
That you know of.
---
It's pretty basic and I keep changing it. I'm on Xbox if you want to come by sometime.
---
I think that's a bug that only happens in enclave bunker. What you are seeing is what the targetting HUD effect looks like though. It used to happen to me in the bunker a fair bit and I didn't know what it was until I got the mod.
---
"Tagging" sounds exactly like leeching to me. You just want to "tag" the enemy so that you can get credit for a kill, and thus the loot? That's leeching, IMO.
---
I'm nowhere near geared up enough to one-shot kill everything in sight, but honestly, I don't think I'd feel the slightest bit bad if I did so. Granted, if I saw a bunch of people already attacking a mob, I probably wouldn't do that, because it seems like a dick move.
---
Yay! an answer. 
---
thats fine my squad dont have an issue playing with me, nothing about anger here, just watching tossers do to me what i do to them...... i have several rookies leveling up and when i nuke a queen i get them down there and i get them to tag as much as they can, but when people want to be douchebags all the time why should i be nice to them?
---
How does that work?  Most of the ones I've modded games more from pockets then lost with UL.  Granted that's incorrect if you live in PA.
---
Helped an 11 yo in Flatwoods today. I sometimes stroll through and offer help. I'm 56 yo woman btw. I love the community in 76!
---
You want less FoV? 
---
Sounds like a plan. Just hit lvl 50, and starting on the main quest. When I find the spot I'll set up camp 
---
I actually can't answer that from experience as I didn't use any mutations until I hadn't 3star card and never had a reason to get the lower tier.
---
I think you'd be missing 12.5hp, 1 or 2 of multiple special stats, and likely 12.5% hunger/thirst drain if you dropped 1 star of class freak. Double/half again those numbers for dropping 2 stars.
---
Prove it 
---
Fuck this sub. Blame Bethesda, this could be fixed so easily yet they allow it to exist. Sad 
---
I think I‚Äôve figured it out. It‚Äôs top floor, near the terminal locked room. It‚Äôs behind a metal cage. No access too it. Also no access point for power connections in build mode. 
---
Only option I haven‚Äôt tried, is running the plant on power from fixing the power station nearby. Will try that tomorrow and see if it works and supplies me with water. 
---
I don't know how to dupe, I don't wanna know, I'm happy as it is. I have destroyed the fun in too many games buy using some advantageous exploit that I know better. I'd rather enjoy this game a bit longer, for once
---

---
Request: constructable mouth harps
---
Why does everyone always seem to find these great and fun people with mics on in game? I‚Äôve found two people with their mics on but everyone else has either been in a party or had no mic(mostly this one for me) 
---
I can't imagine how horific the last part of all rise quest would be if it was a nuke zone...
---
Nice if you join me I‚Äôll supply caps and you can fast travel to me
---
I want to load 100000 and one shot a queen!
---
That would be great, thanks, my PSN is Pupnik. Do you need any ammo or anything? I don't have much in the way of legendaries to swap but I have some of most types of ammo I can give you.
---
This is just asinine. If you want to play, you play. Nobody should have to hold your hand to 'convince" you. 
---
I'll be honest I'm the TSE guy on occasion. I promise it's not done to be a jack ass. I love feeling like a god in BGS games and the TSE Dragon in nuked zones does exactly that. Combined with Speed Demon I feel like Big E in his hayday before the heresy. I do try to stay away from groups obviously farming or I try to only get the last shot in if I see folks farming. If I'm by myself with no one trying to get xp I go ham
---
this should be the ''ban hammer'' or way people get banned wouldn't that be amazing just imagine coming across a cheater and suddenly a Deathclaw destroys them
---
Thanks for your comment it was helpfull.

Happened when someone travelled into Watoga, he was just stood and I was 50m away and the robots were glowing.    
---
From your source:
---
"In video games, an exploit is the use of a bug or glitches, game system, rates, hit boxes, speed or level design etc. by a player to their advantage in a manner not intended by the game's designers"
---
As it is intended by the designers to stack stairs, you have defeated yourself. Good job!
---
Lucked out for sure!
---
and that sounds a lot like manchildren playing with make-believe currency to me. it's exactly as if you chastised people in Dark Souls for using CE to create souls and items because "it's hurting the economy"
---
there's no fucking economy. there are caps that are bound by in-game limitations. so don't complain when people abuse those limitations, like Bethesda's inability to code a bug-free engine. if there's no real currency, there's no real value. it's subjective.
---
You are what is right with this game
---
Prototype armor excuse me thought I edited that.
---
It just means you can build the basic generators for water that go in dirt. No natural resource. 
---
Nope, not me at all. I just was attempting to subtly (and poorly) throw shade at people who lock their bases up. Why? Nobody can take anything, and maybe I'll help some poor over-encumbered SOB in the process.
---
I mean, did you want to play a "trader"?  They didn't really give us good support for this, and if it wasn't for duping then the market could, in theory, be insane.
---
How would they handle this?  Someone selling a TSE handmade for 100's of dollars?  Maybe more?   I vaguely remember this happening with Diablo 2 (literally don't care enough to even Google it).  You think Bethesda or their investors want this?  That's money they could've made, but if they tried to the player base would go insane!  So instead they let the market get saturated and then, when people are making 5's of dollars to sell these things, they can just up the max level to 75 or 100.
---
I could be wrong, I'm sure you hope so, but I wouldn't be shocked at all if a high level expansion comes out, that offers higher level weapons, and has a duping "glitch" active day one.  
---
They do not want YOU making more money than THEM on their product.  Does it sound irrational?  Have you met investors?
---
I‚Äôm so excited to stop by omg. 
---
Ahh thats pretty amazing roll, but I need a non explosive for indoors lol.
---
I need to see all of these
---
Oh, that sucks. I thought it was like (1) Ammo (1) Lead etc, coz there are resource points. 
---
They used a free-to-pay pricing model for their microtransaction shop in a full priced AAA title.
---
You overlook the fact that in-game atoms are heavily front-loaded. Might be easy enough to get now. What about in a year or two when the best you can eek out is a couple hundred a week?
---
Criticisms are very warranted.

If anyone has 12000 colas they got them from a duper

I hadn‚Äôt heard much about mothman so I though he‚Äôd be as easy as the Grafton Monster or some simple Snallygaster, but boy was I wrong. 
---
While heading up to Bog Town to the Mayor for a Day quest, I find mothman hanging out on some broken highway. I pull up photo mode and take a pic, then I observe the mothman. He looks cool and all, and not that intimidating. I take a shot. Mothman teleports to me and I can already hear the ‚Äúnothing personal kid‚Äù in my head. I scream and actually pray to god as I beg for forgiveness and mercy. Luckily my AP was max and I ran away. I look back and see mothman, observing from a distance, knowing he is better than me.

Quick warning, it has been awhile since I've played Fallout 76 only because [my wife and I had a new baby in December](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyBBuBKwv3c) (this is #4), so it's been hard for me to record games that I cannot pause. Plus with her recovering from the c-section, I've been having to look after her until she is allowed lifting and driving.  
---
I'll be recording Fallout 76 once this kid is on a proper sleep schedule and my wife recovers from the surgery.

just look up basic server interaction in online games if you don't believe me. inform yourself. it's not doable.
---
otherwise there'd be dozens of CE tables already and nexus mods with duping stations to spawn items.
---
Do the breach and clear event and you'll get a good chunk.  Also there is a deathclaw corpse at fissure site prime that has black titanium 
---
Yeah it‚Äôs very misleading. 
---
also, grab the pharma farma perk in luck (allows you to press a separate button to search med boxes and get more meds)
---
This is why there should be the simple choice at the start menu.. pvp on or pvp off. The solution to all this bs is soooo simple

---
My friend and I had a blast trying to kill a Mirelurk Queen once upon a time. Our levels didn't even add up to the Queen. 
---
We wiped our first attempt and spent hours putting together a game plan. We had some mishaps and spent a huge amount of ammo, and finally took it down. What a fight!
---
I wandered into the same one the other day. Put a few explosive rounds into it (a shot from my IE Gauss, the. 40mm rounds) and it went down easy. Felt bad. No nostalgia really, just this feeling of pointless. 
---
The difficulty curve is kind of insane. You go from being wiped by mobs of low levels to by high level monsters, to being able to solo both. Then you hit the SBQ and any chance of soloing is gone. 
---
Nothing midground at all. I'd kill for some unsoloable minibosses. The game can be played alone, but I don't see the faintest reason you can justify that meaning EVERYTHING can be done by one player, however high level. 
---
or lure a bunch of ghouls to the camp, and sit on top of a structure. They will break it.
---
I don't have armor for sale, but if you want more fusion cores, the big Sentry bots spawn in Whitesprings. Usually one or two near the main entrance, with additional spawn points near the gates on the north/north-east/east sides. At least on PC, they seem to always drop a 75% charge fusion core. Just jump servers to spawn more or to reset Whitesprings aggression.
---
I‚Äôm sending you a friend request right now. I don‚Äôt need anything in return
---
Why would you not have Batteries Included on unless you're actually LP or hacking, though?  I'd never leave those perks equipped when in combat.
---
I get that, but I only have 2k caps, and I could use my time better than chasing somebody that did nothing to me.
---
If he attacked me...diff. story ;)
---
And the name upon him was...death.
---
Thx for the tip!
---
The mess is being inflated by Youtubers who are banking on negativity and misinformation. It really isnt in as bad of a state as the internet lets on. Big companies have bad launches often, this isn't unheard of. 
---
&gt;level 1PatsBard3 points ¬∑ 
---
I definitely disagree, I have it on Xbox one x also and my performance is terrible, the load times are insanely long compared to PC and my game freezes every time I open the map on xbox and ps4 pro.
---
OH hell yeah I cheat like a mofo in F04 because I've done the grinding over and over and it's boring now and I just want to play with some great mods . But this is not F04 and I'm playing honestly and other people who are duping are ruining my experience. Fuck them.
---
I added u back 
---
I leave a bag of stimpaks at vendors!
---
Okay cool thanks, I'm just going to bed now (UK time) but I'll be on tomorrow and over the weekend :) 
---
I've only found one quantum grenade recipe. Obviously, I used it.
---
I just go to fallout shelter 76 since fast travel there is free.   Make it easy for every one.
---
I'm honestly just impressed people can apparently sell caps for money. Imagine being so dumb you're willing to pay for cheating at the game, but you don't realize you can easily do it for free and dupe caps yourself.
---
Oh look a duplicate post
---
I think its more exctiting that way, trying your best to find a perfect spot for your camp each time you go around, more excitement. maybe just me
---
protip: complaining about downvotes is a quicc way to get more downvotes, jsyk lol
---
If you are ever near Poseidon Power Plant, ALWAYS check the small table to the right of the Fusion Core Processor.. either a full core or a random plan is sitting there, it seems very few people ever check the table. Respawn rate is pretty decent aswell. I always check when im near
---
Okay, not trying to start anything, being serious. Why act like everybody will be a douchbag? I know that there‚Äôs lots of kind-hearted people in this game that either just want to help, or be helped. I mean, Team Fortress 2 is the same way. ‚Äútryhards‚Äù and ‚Äúfriendlies.‚Äù I get where you‚Äôre coming from. But just because it‚Äôs happened a few times, doesn‚Äôt mean that it‚Äôs gonna happen every time. 
---
Sometimes I roleplay with overalls, a sack hood, and a chainsaw, just slowly walking to new players. Either they ignore me, realise that I‚Äôm goofing off and let me chase them for a bit, or just straight up ask if I can help with with the game. Only once have I actually been attacked by somebody. But I‚Äôm not going to automatically assume that everyone will attack me now because of that experience. Everybody is different, man. I‚Äôm just saying that maybe you could give the benefit of the doubt and see how they act with you helping them before doing what you currently are. 
---
I think your confused. Have you googled where Strikebreaker is found?
---
More than likely. See you then. Might do more than one to catch up from earlier. I'll add you when I get home
---
Yeah it really sucks.   If every person on the server was running around with 300 and above carry weight and flying around in jet packs, would it crash the server? Just wondering why they have made acquiring mods so tedious. 
---
I now have a great idea on what I want to do. Thank you everyone for your feedback. It is appreciated ü§Ø
---
There has to become a way to add legendary effects, all of these crafting recipes and they are all shit compared to even a meh legendary. I can craft like 40 weapons and they are all garbage.
---
It‚Äôs glitches when you pick it up. It turns into a regular mini gun the only way to get it is RNG drop
---
Dont buy them
---
Someone with the plans will make you it for free. Im on PS4 or else I would.. having said that, anyone on PS4 that wants one hit me up
---
Ah, seems like there are opinions on both sides. I was hoping not having to buy the game twice to find out like I did for Fallout 4..
---
There's a cliff by Site Alpha with a great view of the Mire. Just be sure to move the C.A.M.P towards Site Alpha so you dont spawn at the bottom of the cliff
---
Yea, I submit a ticket shortly after launch about there being an issue with the belly of the beast quest, and got an actual paragraph of inaccurate information,  essentially telling me how to complete the quest and how the quest rewarded "plans" instead of an actual power armor suit. 
---
Despite their own guide saying it rewards an actual power armor suit, and then it took 3 more ticket escalations for them to say "we can't replace lost items" despite the issue being *I never received the quest reward in the first place*. And I completely understand if a support CAN'T do something, but if I submit a ticket saying missing item from quest reward, don't give me 3 replies that are how I don't know what I'm talking about / the quest doesn't function the way I think it does. (This was after I made an alt and completed the quest a second time, just for the sake of proving what the reward was)
---
Ice machine, milk machine, nuka cola machine? I got them from treasure map also some people in the trading market sell them 
---
Quite a conspiracy theory.  The last paragraph makes you sound pretty nuts üòÇ I can‚Äôt imagine someone spending real money on this shit so I guess we are operating on different wavelengths lol
---
no sorry mate
---
Dupers are fucking with the servers. We get disconnected all the time due to duping. Also people with TSEs are ruining the nuke runs... one shotting shit before anyone else can get a shot in. Seriously before the glut of TSEs we would all stand around trying to kill the SBQ and it was a real battle, not even sure if we could or not sometimes, it was quite the fight. Now it's over so fast when someone or a group of someones come in with TSEs and bam! That's it. 
---
Ditto Whitesprings when they come in with TSEs and kill all the ghouls before anyone else can even get near them. Everyone's got a TSE now. the challenge is gone from the game now. 
---
By the same token do you avoid shooting anything damaged by anyone else though?  It's the same difference.
---
Two major reasons. 
---
1) It vastly expands the population of people who can wipe legendaries in nuke zones, which denies looting chances for players who lack said weapons. 
---
2) It massively alters the risk-reward for calculation. A player without a TSE or explosive weapon won't be able to complete on damage output even with max perks. Without a proliferation of TSE weapons, it's much saver to assume damage parity which opens up tactics besides going for first strike OHKO or close. 
---
There are literally certain weapons that can't be blocked with any combination of practically available DR. It's be fine, albeit annoying if those were rate limited by RNG. But when you need to almost assume their presence, things become markedly different. 
---
Not that were strictly there yet on some platforms, but it's a major reason why duping can be an issue for other players. 
---
I've gotten it several times from workshop defense events. These will reward you with a random camp plan every time and anybody can participate in them. The quest you get to reclaim the workshop after ignoring and failing the event also gives you a camp plan and is much faster to complete...so if nobody else is joining the event you may as well let your workshop be overrun and get it later.
---
Im always down for nuke runs whenever, psn: birdJP19
---
screen shot pending
---
I drop items most of the time at the Whitesprings shopping mall in the middle of the floor where everyone can see it, low level weapons + armor, ammo and consumables i leave at the entry of Vault 76, or the Overseer Camps, sometimes Flatwoods at the Vendor Bot, or just Train Stations. Not sure about other good spots where low level players definitely would see paper bags.
---
Dude I do not want to try to face her without tse equipped teammates. It‚Äôs bad enough when she‚Äôs scaled up.
---
I don‚Äôt know. I tamed a scorched death claw a couple days ago with 7 charisma and both cards maxed to lvl 3. But I‚Äôve read conflicting reports about how high your charisma needs to be and whether you need both cards. 
---
Regardless, my new pet is one of my favorite things in the game, though he‚Äôs loud as hell and can‚Äôt stop trying to destroy my crops. 
---
Dude, send me a message and add me on PS4. If I‚Äôm on I‚Äôll help you out. Add: TheNevadaJack on PSN. I‚Äôm LEVEL 90. I can make you a three blade gauntlet. 
---
Oh please. I face her all the time with a gatling gun that is not TSE. In T60.  
---
Yeah sorry haha, i'm also plugged in directly so it's not an internet thing, but PC just feels smoother overall. I've also never crashed on PC, only like 5 disconnects also, but in 2 weeks of playing on consoles I crashed at least 5 times and get disconnected probably once a day. I will say xbox one x does perform slightly better than my ps4 pro though.
---
Plus PC does currently have some nice mods, like text chat or highlighted plans in the world, plus ultrawide support.
---
Yeah it's got great range and acurracy, I have a two shot pump non exploding, have to be literally point blank to hit anything, has an accuracy of like 15. Found that one on my own. Use it indoors with vats crit attacks.
---
I'm down for nuke runs..even though I suck. 
---
I'm also down to explore the wasteland and be goofs lol
---
My psn: ashoppit
---
No but there are laws. Selling something that doesn't belong to you is theft. Okay we get it you pay to win every chance so you don't come across as a man child but some of us enjoy playing the game and using what they give us. Some of us prefer not to spend real money on a game we've already payed for when everything is there for us to find already. Your telling me the market of caps is pointless but many many players trade caps to each other for goods every single day. Hell people even set up trading posts to do so. Your the minority of the player base that want to use real money on top of the initial purchase, cosmetic items. Your actively saying that anyone who doesn't use real money is a man child. Remember that next time you fast travel matey. 
---
Wow two replies and nobody‚Äôs been an asshole yet. That‚Äôs impressive. 
---
r/OopsDidntMeanTo

I've got \~200 hours in and have never seen the suppressor on a legendary before, so that's news to me. But same can be said about Explosive and Two Shot so it's just boiled down to RNG. Which further enhances my point, not everyone can find those specific types of weapons even if they grinded for 1000 hours. That's mostly what the request is covering, to benefit from specific legendaries most players will end up tossing after they either can't use it or out level it. But if you give the ability to bring those named items to your level they can benefit all players rather than the minority of those who get lucky enough to find those drops again.   
---
Also to point out, I'm looking ahead at if they address these methods in coming patches for cheesing caps from vendors. It wouldn't bother me if they did as it's already easy to get caps legitimately. Which is why I brought that front up.  
---
either they are cumulative or they messed up the text.  
---
slugger 3 is definitely better
---
I have tesla coils on my power armor, so i'm always "hitting" the enemy.
---
Best way to make sure to get all the loot. If you don't have coils any explosive weapon works too.
---
Native resident of watoga serving my robot overlords lots of ditches and tunnels and sky scrapers and robots to protect me 
---
I think having like stalls in whitesprings would be a good idea, visible and saves them the trouble of having to individually mark camps on the map.
---
They should just make so you can‚Äôt even see the event unless you‚Äôre an enclave member or level 40 or something. There‚Äôs no other reason to be down in the Bog at such a low level 
---
You're honestly the first person I've ever seen who took "trader" in this context to mean goods for cash. Every instance I've seen outside of examples of supers has been people who want test to act as in game traders for CAPS. 
---
I am talking about the shielded and protective...not the regular plan for just marine wetsuit....are you saying you can get those there too?
---
Are you in Belgium?
---
Isn't the player wearing an underarmor type thing in that skin?
---
I've seen them there since beta
---
1\* is 1 bonus effect
---
2\* is 2 bonuses
---
3\* is 3 bonuses...
---
Added you
---
I wouldn‚Äôt say you were necessarily ‚Äúscrewed over‚Äù. You wouldn‚Äôt of been able to kill it solo regardless of if those level 5s were there or not. So you unfortunately spent time launching a nuke alone on a server that didn‚Äôt have anyone efficient enough to offer support. Sorry for your loss but nobody is at fault here but you. 
---
My xbox is connected directly with the ethernet cable. My pc has that device that plugs into the wall, with a paired one plugged from the modem to the wall to use the electrical wiring as if it was an ethernet cable. So it's slightly faster for the xbox. Granted I'm sure if the game was optimized it would run much better on my pc but it may be a toss up for either.
---
I was under the impression mods were unfortunately not allowed and/or bannable until Bethesda released them themselves. Figured it was their way to have the same things available across both consoles and pc. Though with Sony not allowing external assets, I imagine it will be all creation club based as opposed to free modders 
---
Two shot Explosive. 
---
TSE needs to be removed.
---
My wife and I picked up the game recently and I‚Äôm the more aggressive player and I am currently lvl 16 while my wife is only lvl 10. We only play together but now she is too low lvl for some areas and we can‚Äôt split up any more to cover more ground.
---
A fool and his money are soon parted.
---
Ohhhh thank you 
---
There's an obvious chicken and egg problem that's been brought up. As-is, when you first spawn into a server it brings the player in, and then "builds" the camp, so there's logistical problems with trying to spawn you at a location where you'd just fall through the floor in the first couple seconds.
---
Not that falling through the floor is actually any worse than how it is now, with spawning inside mountains and cars and shit. But that's probably part of the reason they took it out.
---
They also will get mad at you if you're nearby when a car explodes.
---
Sweet! I'll be on later tonight. I'm cooking atm!
---
I drop a lot but never see many lowbies anymore. Got a 2 shot smg level 10 i've been trying to donate as well and buckets of healing.
---
Even killing enemies is considered griefing now. Other players don't have to make the game easier for you, accept it.
---
Two Shot Explosive. 
---
You can be a ghoul in the infamous "Fallout: The Brotherhood of Steel" which is weird since the brotherhood hates gouls and apparently you're a brotherhood initiate. 
---
Really wish they gave us the plans instead of frames for rewards.  Being able to make level appropriate, or missing pieces, of PA would make it far annoying for me
---
