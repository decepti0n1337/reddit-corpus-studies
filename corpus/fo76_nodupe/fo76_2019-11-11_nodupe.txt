It's a real thing, a group on FB. It's made clear several times that its just a joke and that they're actually trying to get away from the hate that fo1st gets, as well as just 76 in general. It got blown out of proportion as is usual and at the end of the day, most of us just want to be left alone
---
It really grinds my gears when people compare TOW to Fallout. 
---
It‚Äôs made by the same people that made a couple of Fallout games, that‚Äôs it. That‚Äôs where the comparison stops. 
---

---
It‚Äôs no wonder they‚Äôve prohibited talking about it, it literally has nothing to do with the sub.
---
Well, for some reason, younger kids have a easier time with BR type games. Why, idk. But it's the same with fortnite and all. When I play when kids are usually in school, I do eh. Better than usual. But on weekends and when kids are out? Nope. And I don't like losing to 10 year olds
---
death threats are not ok "even as someone who now hates bethesda I can't imagine giving threats"  
---
but the outer worlds comment made me LOL because you know a lot of players that gave up after the 76 lies and BS were probably posting about it
---
I dont think theres any denying that its a toxic sub, if the mods have been forced to make a "stop threatening to kill each other" announcement theres just no hiding it anymore
---
It's also bugged to miss a bunch at 95% until you stop firing and start again.
---
I've noticed this at 33.  I feel like I make it up in strategy and experience but I definitely lose on reflexes.  
---
There's a reason that you rarely find anyone over 25 in eSports.  It's crazy.
---
r/thathappened
---
I keep wondering exactly what kind of scam this is.
---
Your post history indicates that you made this exact same post 5 months ago.  
---
Don't know what you're up to but it smells bad
---
Trust me I get it. I could barely believe what my eyes had just seen. If I had known it was going to happen maybe I could have taken a video, but oh well.
---
We don't have many PVP events so
---
I'm level 140 and I haven't even gotten to the brotherhood quest line. I did a few of the main ones like following the over seer and Rose. But that's about it
---
The first time I read this, I thought you said you were 16 (years old) and you had a 9 year old son! I was like WTF?!?
---
But yeah. Welcome to the club, my 12 year old has been better than me at competetive shooters for a while now. 
---
I'll let you in on a little secret though... Download the Mega Man Legacy collection, let him get real frustrated and then show him how it's done! üòÅ
---
I want the game to be good, maybe they should have aimed for coop play. I had some really good sessions on FO76 early on when there was a lot to explore and I played with other people as a team. But the game got so buggy I would lose time, the economy has always been garbage (maybe vendors fixed it a bit), and they asked for more money but did not fix the game. Then shameless money grab, make Wastelanders good and free dlc I might come back and if I am blown away I may open up and buy some atoms (although the prices are silly so unlikely other than a couple things I really like rather than my usual buy everything completionist approach).
---
But Bethesda follows up with one scummy scandal after another.
---
r/nothingeverhappens
---
I still have yet to see any ‚Äúgame breaking‚Äù bugs in my ~140 hours of play. I assume I am just really lucky but the worst I saw was the T-Posing enemies in the Beta.
---
Nice deleting your post /u/mazterbelen immediately after I called it out - added your user name this time for your future scams.
---
When it first came out it was fun until all the cheater and bunny jumping bitches started to exploit the game, And I bet if I get on now all I'll see is dudes jumping and dudes cheating. At least on pc.
---
Sorry. Someone already helped me.
---
OK, Boomer!
---
The outta worlds one was put up because people there had already hyped it as being better then FO76 in every way.... months before it was released
---
So glad I was bright enough to quit this game after the first month of playing it.  Super great potential.  Super big fail.
---
I feel like progress has been made. We have new content, Wastelanders on the horizon, and somewhat better servers now. But, they need to do more. I don‚Äôt see all the bugs people say exist, but I trust the majority on this. They need to make sure WL‚Äôs is quality to keep people going. Then, bugs must be solved. All of them, else the game will wither away. Then, and only then, can this game shake off dust and become a ‚ÄúFallout‚Äù game.
---
&gt; Yes I would rather pay for DLC,
---
Then explain how the game works when some people pay for the DLC but some don't?
---
stop
---
I mean, if you trust a company that exposes your credit card information and screws you at every turn since last year and you still go ahead and support their products, then they aren't the ones to blame.
---
Been there done that, my son went from vault dweller to gourmand. Now everytime we hit the wastelands together I kill the ghouls... he eats them. Asks me if I want some... I'll stick to my dog food, thank you.
---
Is this thread hidden?
---
[deleted]
---
Doesn't help now a lot of them are saying I was doing it so you would know about the exploit and what it allowed people to do. That way they don't get banned. Had a streamer do it a few nights ago.
---
That's interesting - I've done the event a million times and never got the fixer plan. But I have not done the quest leading up to it.  Maybe that's why.
---
NW anticheat will heavily influence my f1st sub down the line, so they better get to it.
---
I very much doubt that.
---
Ghoulin' and Boolin' EVERBODY GET WEIRD.
---
awesome
---
Thank you
---
Are you from the future?
---
Na, uncommon, not rare.  round 1/10, not 1/1000 or 1/1,000,000
---
I respect that you're having fun but... Really, lowering your standards, ignoring bugs and glitches hurts everyone who wants a streamlined fallout/bethesda game. All people want is a complete product that isn't p2w nor grotesquely monetized. Fallout 3 and NV are my favourite games but I will never play this.
---
There is nothing there. You can bypass the security keypad and Laser grid but the elevator button isn't active. It's an interior Cell activator but it doesn't have a function yet. Glitching through the surrounding walls just shows more mountain. An interesting find though
---
And they most likely just logged out.. waste of nukes
---
That's about the same rate they patched World of Warcraft when I played. I've never played a game that gets patch move than that. A patch a month is pretty standard for MMOs.
---
‚ÄúI‚Äôd rather pay for DLC‚Äù doesn‚Äôt mean there is paid DLC and non paid DLC in the works. I‚Äôm not sure what mental gymnastics you pulled to come up but whatever. Also not everyone paid for the all DLCS‚Äôs in F4 so I‚Äôm sure the game works with or without the purchase of some DLC. Much like how not everyone buys the raider bundles in the Atom Shop but some do.
---
Basicly: add co-op to fo3/4 (depending on your preference)?
---
You get the first week of December.
---
If you could include some ascii snowflakes in the post to make it festive that would be awesome.
---
Yea it was an awesome spot I will forever miss it, I had a pool hall in the middle of my stairs up with a bar in the top cave and my house just out front
---
Best place for steel is arguably Uranium Fever in Blackwater.  Just kill all the mole men and scrap away.  
---
Lead, if you want a no-smelt option:  harvest the weights from the gyms in flat woods, the jail, and the silos.  
---
If you have excess acid to smelt, head to lucky hole mine in your excavation suit to harvest mass lead nodes.
---
The ONLY place you should farm for lead.
---
&gt;Schadenfreude.
---
That's pretty much what I suspected.
---
He plays Fortnite all the time. The controls are different. I play on a ‚Äútrash sensitivity level‚Äù according to him so he had to change that. He got used to the controls in 3 games I shit you not. 
---
Yes part of it was an amazing loot drop at the beginning and his team was definitely experienced, but he held his own. It‚Äôs 100% a true story.
---
Watch for the events load-bearing and breach and clear in the ash Heap.
---
I just want wall mounted turrets. Don't care if they work or not.
---
Outer Worlds was fun and sorta scratches the same itch.  I'd recommend using game pass to play it though, it's a pretty short game.
---
Yes fight fire with fire. It‚Äôs the only counter hence you don‚Äôt get tagged first. No other weapon will work except automatics in Nuclear Winter. No Pipe Weapons no sniper no Lever action no shotgun no melee weapon  no Heavy weapon no laser Pistol. Only any Automatic rifle will kill in 3 to 5 shots.  You can even get 10+ kills knowing this. Every match guaranteed.
---
yep
---
so you are saying the flame posts have helped something in the last year?
---
what has it improved?
---
Todd's sweet lies
---
Waiting for automatron XD
---
my 9 yr old does the same thing. its alright. no shame - some things come to youngins faster than us.
---
He started playing Fortnite about 2 years ago. It took him the first two matches to understand the controls of FO76 and adjust the sensitivity to make it more like how he plays Fortnite. 
---
He still had a few moments where he was running in place against a stump, but aiming?? Aiming was not a problem and it put me to shame. Haha
---
r/fallout76settlements
---
Also doesn‚Äôt matter what armor they are wearing. It‚Äôs guaranteed 3 to 5 shots instant death. You will probably have used maybe 4 or 5 clips of bullets the whole match.
---
The game has almost no features that are subscription based:
---
A subscription gets you:
---
1. some atoms
---
2. an outfit
---
3. a place to hold unlimited scrap
---
4. a "tent",a sort of per-built movable extra camp.
---
I found it and I equipped my head gear thanks fellow vault dweller.
---
Without the perk is going to take several clips to take down target.
---
Before legendary fixers were available from the purveyor the plan was cheap and for sale in a lot of player vendors.  The basic fixer was not that great.
---
I doubt there will be anything beyond the creation club. I don't think 76 is a testing ground. The point of this game is so that future core titles DONT need online features or microtransactions
---
Thank you :)!
---
Some people just are into mind boggling stuff xD.
---
ESOs first year the devs were marathoning hardcore in improving the game fast and keep going and going xD
---
Because I like the game they said they were making, not the one they shat out of their sticky, bloated asscheeks. Even to this day I can *see* a good game in there somewhere, it's just caked under piles of fermented feces and lies. 
---
Zenimax themselves admitted, in court, they did not live up to the game they advertised and had to refund those who live in Australia their money back.
---
But don't let this stop you. By all means, band together and put an end to the nasty mean old negativity and only allow positive comments for your doubleplus good game.
---
Got ant source for even the tiniest hint towards that?
---
Or are you just making shit up?
---
I always have a brown paper bag and fertilizer with a "you've been insulted" note to leave for shitty people.
---
These guys made the best radio mod for Fallout 4 which I always use; they will probably have Fallout 76 mods once they can be put out for custom radios.
---
ESO was a true MMO. It had a bit more freedom to how you gear your character and what abilities, but it was still a standard MMO. 
---
Eventually they redid the endgame level up system, but where it was its best was with pvp. There was the bounty system that was introduced, along with being able to steal and attack any NPCs, but the alliance battles rocked in my humble opinion. It basically turned all gear you equipment to cosmetics. It required knowing your character's strengths and adapting a play style to it, and required tons of communication with team mates because no single person was OP. It was super badass making siege engines that could destroy castles, but later on they added more with the expansions.
---
I haven't touch the game for about 4-5 years now. When it came out with gamepass I tried to sit down with it some more, but was so damn lost where and what I was doing, so I gave the game up for good.
---
yea with motifs nonstop being added theres a ungodly amount of cosmetics to earn even if you dont own the dlc.
---
So to unfuck the game people need to work for Bethesda now? Jesus wept.
---
They could just look different, hollow, smaller. It is so annoying.
---
Yeah, if I went back to it I‚Äôd only do Cyrodiil. I did Cadwell‚Äôs Gold on one character and I think 98% of all quests out before Elswyr.
---
Oh, man ... I love it. It's sad it does not happen often.
---
Different colors. Different shapes. Outlined. On and on and on. 
---
I‚Äôve followed the wrong marker so many times.
---
Motifs were a huge grind even with hundreds of thousands of gold and the big holiday events that gave random ones. I enjoyed it, but the quest for them kinda fried me.
---
Check out this: https://youtu.be/8U6nJrc8s58
---
Got any pictures or videos of that? Would love to see how made it all homey!
---
Absolutely. Maybe icons and avatars could work. Like, if you have the Raider icon, send you to people doing the same.
---
I wish I could get my other characters to wander around my camp.
---
Sadly no I didn‚Äôt think to take a bunch cause I wasn‚Äôt expecting it to go away
---
Your math is off here bud even with no armor and health at 300 getting hit with a rifle doing 50-55 it would take 6 shots. Add armor of 200, 120 if you are getting shot with tank killer and that would add 3 more shots. So really it takes 9-10 shots.
---
I dont think there is actual BoS titled combat helmet, its just black or shadowed is what its called, but ti matches color wise with the BoS armor setup. That may be where the confusion is. Im like 99% sure there is no Combat helmet color that actually says BoS whn making it, its either black or shadowed or something along those lines. Cant remember right now but I know i can make black combat helmets, have been able to forever
---
I once met a group of three cannibals during an event, I think it was a violent night. They wore cultist outfits and masks. It was fun to see them eat after every kill.
---
So many awesome ones. I'd say so far the fight club is my fav.
---
FO4 is not a shared world online game.
---
Probably best not to make videos of a kid that young tbh.
---
Except ESO was way bigger at launch.
---
What about the one where armour doesn‚Äôt lose any condition? I haven‚Äôt had to repair my armour in weeks.
---
I love the population sign, it actually changes with the number of people in Watoga.
---
Wait a minute, the tattered dress gives +1 PER??? since when??? I used to wear that thing all the time but i never noticed a buff from it? I mean its been liek 8 months since that time when i wore it a lot, maybe something got changed, but i never heard of an outfit giving a buff besides underarmor?
---
It doesn‚Äôt need to be a shared world online game. We‚Äôre talking about DLC and how being paid or not paid effects the game. 
---
You asked about how a game works when some people pay for dlc and others don‚Äôt. It still works, regardless of who pays or doesn‚Äôt. But what I was trying to state is that the ‚Äúfree dlc‚Äù tactic should be changed so that we all pay for the DLC‚Äôs separately. It‚Äôll probably give them more money to actually fix the game and produce meaningful content.
---
To bad the owner is xbox. Really creative and adds fun to the game.
---
That is a "you" problem.
---
Also, praised? For what, gunplay that's on a level of a decade old shooters? Gimme a break.
---
Can I pay for the game in future dollars as well then?
---
I
---
I just banned Bethesda on Steam so no more of their games.

Actually I watched their camps get destroyed it was beautiful
---
I'm not into men. Sorry to let you down bud. Better luck finding a life partner. Good luck! üåà
---
Maybe try censoring names? Idk
---
If you watch it get destroyed wouldn‚Äôt that mean you are in the nuke zone? Which is death
---
Well hopefully your new camp is just as awesome!
---
Some people have already been nice and are turning into raiders. Not a nice thing, but it is allowed by game mechanics. You may like it or not, but it is there. And sometimes, some events require certain quota to be achieved. It is a risk to think people know what etiquette says should be done. How do you play "campfire tales" do you farm it slowly for acid, or you just hurry up to get the Legendary? How do you play 'a violent night? Do you go unarmed to get the extra bonus? Do you turn the music on? Etc. 
---
If you want peace and quiet, multiplayer games are not the smartest option.
---
Well it shouldnt be called witch hunting should be called douche bag hunting and i dont agree with their dumb rules on not calling out legit cheating scumbags.
---
It wasn't as bad as they say it was around here. It could never compete with adventure mode numbers but there was a decent playerbase. Although the numbers did drop drastically after the nerfs rolled out on July 25th. It was so bad. I'm glad adventure mode didn't see any of those nerfs.
---
This is the most recent state of community knowledge
---
We video him doing all sorts of crazy things. We take pictures of him all the time. I think a lot of parents takes pictures and videos of their children. I had never thought anything was weird about that until your comment. Haha
---
I hear you.  I gave up fortnite and nw and let my 10 year old have the account long time ago. I suck at battleground games, royally
---
Have you been crafting? It actually uses those things if you do
---
so they showed up to the line an hour late. Tripped out of the gate. Fell on their dicks. Stood up and their pants fell down because they forgot to tie their drawstrings. Then they just decided to self immolate themselves like a Tibetan monk instead of try anymore.
---
I believe this is what everyone wanted and hoped 76 would be. I know me and my pals did.
---
pretty sure this is a rough alpha.
---
I hope assassin will be buffed to be the default PvP choice for majority builds, with only those specialized being better. 30% damage bonus at minimum, suggested 50%.
---
You'd think this would be a very obvious and standard feature.
---
No. I don't think so. I have plenty of actual acid in my scrap box and harden mass turns into ultracite and I haven't crafted anything with ultracite. Scrap shouldn't be touched in the stash box an if it does the game tells you it'll use it but I never get a notification about it. Been losing certain stuff whenever I put it in my stash box and not scrap box.
---
Well if you're in mid thirties with arthritis I'd hate to imagine getting it younger and the way I'm going that may be the case and I'm 23 üò¨üò¨

---
Mutants should be buffed to 3-4% per mutation with no limit, and there should be added perks that benefit not being mutated.
---
Antiseptic effect should be added as prefix and it should give out flat 50% damage bonus if you are not mutated. Frog legs should be put in main game as marsurpial alternative for nonmutated characters. Currently not being a mutant is simply stupid. There needs to be a lore reason and math incentive to stay clean out of mutations.
---
Yeah, I hear ya. I had just heard that it's another nice "glitch" from a few people, and that it does. I mean, I lost 4k ballistic fiber and 700 flux etc to the scrapbox the first day. It's.. Temperamental.
---
Hardened mass is a JUNK item. Ultricite is a SCRAP item. All junk breaks down into scrap. You pay the subscription and don't understand this mechanic? Wtf over???
---
You didn't read what I said. I separated them. Hardened mass goes into my stash box. It disappears in small amounts without me even using it.
---
Do you need to see the manager, Karen?
---
...if an explosive railway rifle has hit scan AND retains its extremely long max range projectile...  It would literally be the truest sniper rifle in the game since it'd be the only gun with a hit range beyond the render distance.
---
..........I guess I need to find me a Bloodied Explosive railway rifle to test.
---
Sucks that its automatic reciever is glitched and fires like any automatic rifle despite shooting way slower.
---
Here's a damage calculator- [https://akarnokd.github.io/rng-76/weapons.html](https://akarnokd.github.io/rng-76/weapons.html)
---
Bethesda implemented strangler armors which completely negated any points of PvP. They could either apply a hard nerf over something they wanted people to grind for, or accept increasing amount of posts asking them for a hard nerf because of how OP that armor is, and it was even more OP on survival, where the damage was capped heavier, and the cap did not affect the posion at all.
---
Below video shows how a single shot from a shotgun used by a character with 0 perks one-shots a full HP PA character from a long range.
---
https://youtu.be/rppJuKIKJsE
---
Thanks and glad it helps!
---
You're*, Karen.
---
3 shots at 50-55 damage only make 150-165 so you already have more health than that base dub.
---
Ok boomer
---
Found it. While in game, pull up the map, L1 for options, photo gallery, and there it is.
---
J
---
Aye! That's muh boi.
---
It‚Äôs pretty good, it was the one I normally do, it‚Äôs very welcoming and on the sunny top ski lanes slopes, looks like a real house to me
---
That's the beauty of it, it was down a hill and the top of the hill wasn't in the blast radius, plus their camps were still visible on the map as it dropped, they teleported back after the nuke dropped all salty.
---
No, the tombstone is still in the shop. The pumpkin pail was the only loot bag skin removed when Halloween ended.
---
I don't even play the game anymore because of its issues but sure, lol. Okay.
---
You are an idiot. If your math is as good as your English.
---
Oh yeah, that's fine, I just mean maybe not putting it online publically without checking with him or anything. My mum put a photo of me online and my entire school got it. Not fun.
---
I can see a storyline balanced for coop play but possible as single player.
---
It seems one of the assumptions is players would populate the world, unfortunately they did not. Trade mechanics were broken until vendors came around, I know I tried to trade and help people out as a merchant type. Workshops were not very persistent and often crashed before you could recoup your investment. Also there was a very big portion of players that did not want to interact with random players at all in the world.
---
Combine that with limited quest design and the world felt empty.
---
Coop open world with a more standard quest design and more stable engine (less stress from trying to manage 24 player servers, can optimize it to only process the area players are in) and I am sure the game gets a positive reaction even if it has the usal or slightly more bugs.
---
It also naturally turns into a single player  game for that crowd (just start your own session). 
---
As it gets more stable introduce competitive modes with higher player counts, although to be honest 24 players will never feel like an mmo.
---
Shill
---
Ahhh. Yeah for sure I‚Äôd ask him before I posted anything. Good point.
---
Obviously. Say you are using a combat rifle. 3 shots wouldn‚Äôt even add up to base health in NW. You are a moron.
---
I imagine Russians like Scorched Earth the most
---
What? You talk about the games complexity like its all that mattered skyrim had lore yes, so does outer worlds. How does that effect a game on a mechanical level? There's a reason they have seperate teams for these things. We started talking about the buga of 76 not hiw deasra there are
---
Now this is an Avengers level threat.
---
Not necessarily depends on the nuke placement if they were on the edge of the blast zone you could easily watch just outside the zone. Either way it forced them off the server if they left
---
Tombstone and gore bag are still in the shop
---
5x49=245 
---
Base health is 250 you said it yourself. Moron.
---
Edit: this is still before adding any armor. Dumb fuck.
---
No frog legs shouldn't  Marsupial has a negative impact, no free pass.
---
Because the game is not nearly as bad as they say it is, and because Bethesda has been working hard and constantly improving the gameplay experience.
---
Hornwright testing site #3 has a bunch of iron ore veins scattered around it. Also a few lead.
---
Don‚Äôt worry I can control him. Nothing can go wrong.
---
I really agree with non mutant perks. I don't think there's any builds that doesn't use mutation. There no reason to Not use mutations
---
Dude go play another game
---
It. Just. Works.
---
Haven't you got the memo?
---
Seriously though - it's a bug, easily google-able.
---
they seemed to be on the fence about what they wanted.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
On one hand, they wanted players to interact, become traders, farmers, armor/weapon smiths, etc.
---
then they went on wanting players to kill each other and be raiders.
---
while i see where they were coming from, my experience in gaming lead me to think that this is a bad idea, as people who would play as raiders, pvping usually have the upper had, being the people to finding the bugs/exploits to assist in killing, weighing the scales  to there side.
---
don't get me wrong, i love the idea of a co-op story, in fact its what i thought it would be at first (maybe 4 groups of 4 on each server, doing there own things, but can still interact like trade or attack), and i'm sad at where they went with 76 instead
---
Breach and clear event for ore, weights for lead and damn near everything for steel.
---
ok cuck
---
CandyüëÄ like fare payment.
---
I have only ever heard one person on PS4 that I had to report who was cussing and one of the other players on the team was a younger kid Maybe 11 / 12 and he handled it great he said something like dude stop if my mom hears I'm going to have to stop playing and this 20-something guy goes on a rant cursing Etc and I told him chill out we're here to play a game he goes off on me kid disconnects and the cursing idiot not paying attention gets us all killed
---
Yup, so with master commando the combat rifle does 49. Without it it does 40. Any other stupid points you want to bring up?
---
The bigger question is why add a new vault when 69 and 63 haven‚Äôt been given a purpose yet?  That was a great cave too.  Had a camp of mine there as well.  Bethesda really doesn‚Äôt want us to have the luxury building in caves, huh?  The only caves left to build in are just north of the lumbar mill which that isn‚Äôt a very practical and the bullseye cave near vault 76.
---
Nice haha
---
Nice
---
Does... Does this count as cold labour?
---
OOOOOOFFFFF
---
Usually testing my internet connection is enough, I haven‚Äôt had the issue before so I can‚Äôt say it‚Äôs a ‚Äúfix all‚Äù solution but it‚Äôs fixed the ‚Äúyou do not have the right permission‚Äù thing that pops up every now and again
---
Fucking idiot lmao just grasping at straws now.
---
&gt;Testers don't "reject" anything. The testers submit a bug through the  system, oftentimes not ever meeting the devs because frankly, in many  companies testers are looked down upon. The bugs are given different  classification depending on what they do and the actual dev  team/leadership would decide if they would fix it or not
---
I think there is a breakdown in communication here, for me QA has the ability to accept or reject something, so if we are equating "Testers" with QA then we are talking apples and oranges.
---
&gt;One of the things you need to realize is that at game companies, QA is  looked at as bottom of the barrel as far as staff goes, and they're  often times treated as such. Bureaucracy lets incompetent people and  practices rise to the top.
---
Wait, this seems in opposition to them having the best, they are also the bottom of the barrel...
---
Lets assume they are the best of the worst, and are leagues above the average Video Game QA, again if QA = Tester then back to Apples/Oranges.
---
&gt;That's because when you submit you put your name on it. People are going  to see what you did, and most importantly, because you're not being  paid for it, you're going to be passionate about it and protect it.  That's the difference between the open source community and corporate.  Everything you've suggested can be classified as more work, and the idea  they'd take on more than their already meager team assigned to 76 has  is laughable.
---
Again a reason to accept the outside help / feedback.
---
&gt;What will keep 76 afloat is fallout 1st. What will keep it afloat is the  atomic shop. What will keep it afloat are the people who just don't care  and will gladly play and pay for it even with the bugs.
---
Again $100 says Atomic Shop total revenue is down on average because of a reduced player base, yes they had a spike due to those who bought a month of Fallout1st, but exclude that for now until you have a 3+ month average.
---
Also if they accepted more suggestions and feedback, much of it easy to implement "low hanging fruit", they would have more microtransactions and an ecstatic player base.
---
They have been making BAD business decisions and it can be seen/reflected in the micro of the multiple "Player Die-Off's" we've seen in game and in r/fo76.
---
Even looking at Reddit and Bethnet as a vocal minority, almost **EVERYONE** has noticed fewer and fewer players, more repeats of the same players day after day who aren't on our friends list, etc.  
---
  
---
I know this is a complex situations with tons of red tape, people who lack an understanding of the players and game making choices, but other MMO's / Games have faced similar problems...The crossroads are almost always accepting and admitting the mistakes and embracing the playerbase to help solve both the in game and fiscal problems, or not, which time and time again has resulted in the death of the game.

Frog legs takes over your special slots, for majority of the builds the negative consequences of marsurpial are neglible

Should have been honest with him. It's actually so we can find the target in the first place. Eyes aren't as good as they used to be.
---
I say this with a heavy heart and a saddened gaze, as a 27 year old who knows they will have many more years ahead of them for vision to fade further.

Obligatory, "the real joke is in the comments"?
---
Fallout 76 is one of the games where you can see the bar lowered for other game makers. There are many small steps towards horrible game monetization, paywalls, lack of content, and I'm not saying this game alone makes the world a worse place.     
---
But the frustration is that seeing fallout used to push the boundaries of minimum effort for maximum cash is frustrating. It's frustrating for fallout fans. It's frustrating for gamers. It's frustrating for parents of players. It just sucks. I would love to play a game of fallout co-op with my son, explore the wastelands, nuke some shit. But I can't do that with this game. The game has no content that isn't there to try and hook cash out of you. Also, it's too damn buggy. We don't spend all that much time playing games, and to spend even 30 minutes on load screens, falling through the world, or whatever other game braking bug that pops up too often, is too much of our time to waste on this poor excuse of a game.
---
Talk to a doctor.  Start taking Aleve and maybe Tramadol.  This runs in my family and I'll be replacing joints in the coming decade or two.  Hopefully by then we'll have some cyborg options.  It started in my twenties in my back, then knees, and hit my hands in the past couple years which is what really made me sad.
---
What does NW stand for?
---
Also if you find a flaw and retest it to see if you understand the mechanism of failure, there is a good chance you'll get banned after reporting it.

&gt; Use descriptive titles. Clickbait or extremely vague titled posts will be removed. 
---
If you have a question about something, please put the question **in the title**. **Avoid the use of trailing ellipsis.** Posts with ellipsis are generally clickbait and non descriptive. Reddit does not make it possible to edit titles, so you will have to post again with a more descriptive title without a trailing elipsis. If you have questions you can feel free to message the moderators.
---
Then why do we need frog legs?  Since the 5 perks for marsupial to have no negative consequence don't matter?
---
Electrically charged, plague walker, and unstable isotope.
---
Any 3 of these mutations will get you killed.
---
It doesn't help that I am stoned when I play.
---
it does NOT get any better...but that's ok because I have more (and can afford more) toys now
---
Only if you're good. That's not a good perk for a wook.
---
Im a shill because i enjoy the game?
---
Lmao just add all this other shit in after you made some broad stupid statement. Whatever, you are a waste of time.
---
Enclave is the future of Murica
---
Eh in this case the core to 76 is spend money and lots of it
---
Its gotten better but not to the point I would buy this game at full price if I knew what I knew today.
---
Btw even so with that it would do 56 damage a shot so 56x5=280.
---
250 base health plus any armor and iron clad already proves you wrong again. Dumb dumb dumb you are.
---
Lmfao obviously you do dub.
---
Robobrains roasting each other...
---
The current setup of the Scrapbox/Stashbox prioritizes junk from the Stashbox, then the Scrapbox. If you‚Äôre crafting something that requires acid, your bug bits will be scrapped for acid before it moves to crafting items in your Scrapbox.
---
Several people have encountered this little issue, and I‚Äôve personally submitted a ticket. Hopefully we can see this adjusted in Patch 15!
---
yep, I found it earlier as well
---
It's called stockholm syndrome, sadly can't be fixed
---
For valid playstyle alternative to marsurpial so it's not mandatory to go mutated?
---
Hey don‚Äôt listen to him listen to me. Use that and mater commander. The rest of the perks you choose. Come back and thank me later ok. :)
---
Or they're a bit older and smarter, not looking to burn 60 dollars on a buggy game. THE GAME IS NOT WORTH 60 DOLLARS
---
You only proved my point more lol. With armor it is impossible to kill someone in 3-5 shots unless they are all head shots.
---
Lol I'd love to see! Do you play on console or PC?
---
I smiled when I read the edit. Good for you OP
---
How did you do that? I‚Äôm only level 49 and my weapons could never take a scorchbeast on that quickly...
---
56x5=280
---
250 base health plus any armor mean you need more than 5 shots no matter what. That‚Äôs with master commando/tank killer and bloody mess. I know that‚Äôs a lot for you but I‚Äôm sure you will get there little guy.
---
There‚Äôs a liberty prime power armor for 76?! I thought it was only on F4
---
Have it documented and reported, Bethesda is aware, if they've not acknowledged it.

You can often get it to stop acting weird after doing a player trade, I have no clue why, but it solves it 100% of the time for me.
---
Hmmm. I'd say from his health it may be a bloodied furious minigun with prime reciever and he got all the perks to make it do more damage?
---
Same boat!

I stopped power leveling months ago at 300, and I've still not been to the overseer's camp....

No, because that‚Äôs their jobs. Are you seriously making that comparison, or are you just that confused?

At best you‚Äôre saying we‚Äôre equals. Which may or may not be true, but at the end of the day you bought fallout 76 and I didn‚Äôt. So....
---
I'm 33. Not sure if that counts as younger. Winning isn't a problem. There are skills that can be learned to make game play into muscle memory. I'm thinking of creating a YouTube channel specifically for teaching people how to get  wins.
---
Yup. They still did it multiple times. The rules being enforced equally is not a problem...
---
Oh thanks, I commend you for still working on the list.
---
 BTW since its not on the thread, the "sliding ghoul" bug is still out there (NPCs don't active their ambush animation), had a angler bite my feet for 2 minutes with no way to fight back. Its a far more annoying bug that makes hitboxes completely bogus.
---
That is painful to read it‚Äôs so poorly written.
---
Put the bug parts in your vendor for 25k?this works.get one of them each out when u do the quest
---
I'd love to do that if I wasn't st msx budget lol
---
Many legendary weapons are useless. For instance why would anyone use nocturnal or stalkers. The effects are poorly balanced as if they only want to make only a few highly sought after and the rest trash tier. They should really make the situational ones stronger so there will be diverse builds.
---
So i read some of the other comments here.
---
It seems even with more than they perks you're talking about your numbers don't add up.
---
And you resort to personal attacks instead of actually providing any evidence to back up what your saying.
---
With all the perks plus commando, bloody mess and tenderizer your 3-5 shots still doesn't add up.
---
And your response to that is "well no one plays solo so 2 ppl shooting at you is that many shots"
---
I guess my point is maybe actually have a clue what you're talking about, delete this thread, get your facts straight and try again.
---
With targeting hud, it gave a faint red hue to enemies that was hard to see in the day, in the night it was still crappy but it's probably been fixed since that was like last year lol
---
Your loot has little to do with it. Any loot will do. Knowing how to make use of whichever gear you end up with is the important part.
---
Yeah I was confused when It said that u could put the jet pack on the arms and legs, what happens if u actually do that?
---
Even better idea, don't invest your money in POS games like this, problem solved.
---
yah this happens to me on xbox.. its always when i first load into a world.. hangs around for about 5 mins before i can start selecting and using emotes and dont have issues again... untill i load into a new world again.

Who is paying you? You working for one of them other post-apoc games? You hoping to draw players away from 76 and to your trashy game title?
---
What discussion? You built yourself a strawman to go after. Instead of looking at all the varying ways that someone may like the game. You settled on 'THEY ARGUE ANYTHIUNG BECAUSE THEY KNOW THEY WRONG'
---
IE, Don't use Cheat Engines.

So how do you get quests since there are not NPCs to talk too? I just started.

A MUCH BETTER map has always been available at : https://fo76map.com/

Because back in the day a guy was killed by a reddit witch hunt. Info shared about someone and they had the wrong guy... Some idiots tracked down this wrong guy irl and killed him. So reddit as a whole has a pretty hard stance on "witch hunting". If you dont follow the rules your sub can get banned.

after next patch well be at concept and art!

There's a point, you're missing it, I might continue repeating myself, but you're not interested in listening.

Taking out special slots is not a free pass. Removing 4 intelligence from final special is zero sacrifice, and sacrificing just a single special perk card point is a bigger one. This is not a free pass you imagined. Perk card slots are more important than some final intelligence.

I'd welcome that, Knowing that Map76 guy would reeee at the top of his lungs. Which is what he did when he loaded a cheat engine and the anti-cheat clobbered him like a sack of bricks
---
The question, "Why are you all still playing" gets asked here every day multiple times a day now.
---
I'm still playing for the same reason others are still playing - we like the game.  That's what it boils down to.  We play it because we enjoy it.
---
*"But it's a buggy glitchy dumpster fire!"*  No it's not.  Maybe it's the way I play versus the way other people play, I don't know, but I don't encounter many bugs during a play session.  The AP with the jet pack on my power armor is a little wonky sometimes since they overhauled the power armor system, but that's usually the only thing I encounter in a few hours of play.
---
*"But the constant crashes and disconnects are unbearable!"*  I don't get many crashes or disconnects.  I don't know why so many people report this.  It has not been my experience with the game.  I usually play it on an XBox One (not X or S, just the old base model), although I own it on PC as well and play that occasionally.  I live in WV so it's not like I have Google Fiber Internet.  Still, I don't have the performance issues that some people report.  
---
Am I supposed to stop playing because other people experience glitches or disconnects?  That would be silly.  Of course not.
---
*"But they [insert some business/money complaint here]."*  Some of the complaints about Bethesda in this regard are just plain false.  I won't get into it now, but there's a lot of stuff that has been said that just plain isn't true.  However, for the sake of argument, let's say that the detractors are correct in the broader sense:  Bethesda is just a money-hungry corporation who want to charge customers for everything, including some things that should be free.  Well, welcome to capitalism.  Companies do not care about you.  Companies do shitty things.  Companies work so that they can get money.  This is the way capitalism works.  I long ago made peace with the fact that every dollar I spend gets put in the hands of people who don't deserve it.  Even if a company itself is beyond reproach (big if!), their employees go and dump a percentage of that dollar into something I wholly disagree with anyway.  This is life, and it's not fixable until society as a whole evolves past a whole slew of things that go way beyond the scope of any video game.  
---
Am I going to deny myself something I enjoy because of that?  Of course not.  I might as well just hop in the grave if that's the case, because every penny I spend has some degree of destruction attached to it.  
---
I eat meat even though the meat industry is destructive.  I take allergy pills even though the pharmaceutical industry has some big issues.  I own two cars even though they contribute to climate change.  I post on Reddit even though they have done some questionable shit in the past too (just like you do).  And I still play Fallout 76, for the same reason I do all of the above:  It enhances my experience as a barely-smartened-up ape clinging onto this rock floating through space, hurtling toward oblivion, destined to be forgotten and leave no trace by the end of all things.
---
I hope that's a sufficient explanation.  I don't know what else to tell you.
---
True that's perfectly true
---
&gt; you bought Fallout 76
---
No I didn't, last Fallout I played was 4.
---
This is a different game but my 7 year old cousin is a God at fortnite, a straight up prodigy. He can't even spell controller and he can beat anyone in a build battle, I'm 10 years older than him(a today's kid) and I can't even do that. Children are nuts
---
Ugh...  
---
Yes trying to figure that one out, I think the game might be loading the wrong HKX Files (animation files) for the NPC's, forcing them into odd positions, you can force this behavior in FO4 by linking a creature to a different creatures behaviors / animation triggers.
---
There's a lot of tools out there better then map 76 that you can use for free so I see no point
---
Thank you for the clarification &amp; tag! :)
---
I think they have come a good ways.  There is still much to do and many changes to make.  I haven't been pleased with all the changes they have made and they have introduced some really nasty bugs when fixing other nasty bugs.  
---
They have had some serious miss-steps with the atom shop and other things but I have to commend them for trying to fix it and for not coming to us with a half-baked excuse for what they did.  
---
I know people don't like the radio silence when they cause a controversy but I personally prefer silence to a non-answer answer.  The game was a very large under taking, possibly the largest to date, and they might have bit off a bit more then they could chew with it.  I hope they keep working on it and keep fixing issues as fast as they can without breaking anything else and I hope that people reading this will keep playing.

Can you craft that? I‚Äôve been on since day 1 and never found this. Hell I‚Äôve kept the first one I ever found.

If Zenimax can do it with eso. Bethesda should have no issue implementing such a system on fallout.
---
I'm a dad and stoned all the time. You should see my gameplay. It's hilariously bad. But I've found I prefer the MGS sneaking everywhere approach in NW anyway. I like to get wood armor and a crossbow and spend my time hiding. Pop other dads when I can.
---
I have not seen a single gore pile or gravestone since they came out.  So im gonna say only the player who has it can see it

A MUCH BETTER MAP \*links to a site that has a paywall on some features\*
---
Just FYI, every character has a chance to pull plans off of each corpse, meaning that once you find a corpse you can farm it with friends, other random players from the server, and your own alt accounts.
---
If you can‚Äôt buy the plan I suggest finding at least one other person also looking for the plans and team up to farm together. Each person has five chances to pull plans (one chance on each of their five characters). Have one person stay with the corpse and the other can load in and out off of that player with a new toon each time. Also, I have found that other players are often willing to help. Sending a team invite to random and joining voice chat is a good way to meet new players and can be beneficial for everyone. Some people will want to keep plans they find, but if they know the plans they will drop them for you.
---
obviously you didnt actually read what was going on. either that or you're being oblivious/stupid on purpose.
---
in either case he was testing and reporting bugs and exploits that were reported to the community managers. if that wasnt what we did then we wouldnt be working with them right now to get things resolved.
---
want :-p
---
hey local shouldn't u be banning rocks together our something.
---
Bookmarked and upvoted
---
I have read what was going on. Everyones account is trying to cover for him commiting a bannable offense. 'Look at the good he was doing' when he still broke the terms of service by using a third party cheat engine. He's lucky they didnt' IP ban his computer. Which after that little outburst, I sure wouldn't miss him

All civil war costume are now craft able. In the forest and toxic valet region there is a random encounter with a civil war reenactor‚Äôs corpse. He hold a holo tape about the battlefield cemetery, a .50 ball, and plans for all 5 of the costumes. These work the same way as the trick-or-treaters and the Halloween costume plans.

Well said.  They have messed things up and fixed things.  They have a huge cheating problem with NW and other weird problems that keep popping up but they keep trying.  I want to some change also but I'm going to keep faith that the best is yet to come and while we have hit a rough spot it will get better in the coming weeks and months.
---
Damn ok

All players can see whichever skin you have equipped. I saw lots of trick or treat buckets during mischief night events.

3 on each rifleman and 3 on tank killer.  Maxed out basically. 12 points

I'll buy that for a dollar!
---
you seem to be pretty stupid then. we have the blessing of the community managers to do these kinds of things because we do this to help the game and not to harm it. if you check the tos that you seem to like to point to it also says to report all bugs and exploits to bethesda which is what we do
---
Aw ok üëåüèΩ
---
Idk... Should some effects be trash tier? Or should they all have some type of good redeeming quality?
---
How would you know since you didn't get it on launch? I did, and it sure didn't seem like it to me. Maybe I didn't notice since the pve quests were so bugged I leveled from L3 to VR6 doing repeatables and ganking people in Cyrodiil. And then quit when my free month ran out.
---
Bravo, bravo.  I don't normally condone destroying other people's camps but in this case it's fully justified.  Served them right.

This is what private servers should have been

Well you insinuated that everyone who bought the game at launch was angry.
---
Curious, since I didn't get a chance to check out the closed site, what features did it have that this site has paywalled?
---
The confusion must have been priceless. A job well done!
---
Yes, that‚Äôs how you get them, treasure maps.
---
Well... I have always enjoyed how much fun it was to go back to my main settlement in fallout 4, with sturges and that junkie girl from the combat zone patrolling while wielding miniguns and helmetless sets of power armor.
---
No way!!! I was not aware of that!
---
It feels like watching an old asthmatic Jewish man run a race where every time he gets some distance he runs out of breath and has to stop and every time he gets going again he stops and tries to sell me something.
---
Once you hit level 10 or so, you probably want to focus on leveling just by killing stuff, not quests.  Get yourself to level 50, then do the quests at your leisure.
---
A MUCH BETTER map has always been available at : https://fo76map.com/ - even better the creator of that map did *not use cheat engines*  which is why the crybaby of the banned account got banned in the first place.
---
FO76Map is vastly better anyway.
---
&gt; n either case he was testing and reporting bugs and exploits that were reported to the community managers. i
---
Is that what they call using cheat engines now days??
---
"Ohhh....I wasn't actually cheating in NW you see... I was *testing* the system!"
---
Same here.   This would add lots of value to fallout 76.
---
&gt; we have the blessing of the community managers to do these kinds of things 
---
No you don't.  
---
You're an alt account for the banned guy aren't you?
---
Did someone really get killed? I don't remember that.
---
I know reddit has accused the wrong person of the Boston Bombings, but that guy was already missing and dead to begin with, he didn't get killed because of the accusations.
---
It's the only costume that does. I used it on my second guy forever and didn't even realize it was unique.
---
You mean you've never tried to report bugs for a game you love after finding one?
---
Eh.  More power to you I guess.  I still think it's messed up to punish people without the context in mind.  Hell even if it was a temporary ban that'd still be better as a tap on the wrist warning people not to do it even out of a desire to help.
---
Context does matter to me, but I respect your view, it doesn't have to matter to everyone.
---
Honestly I'm surprised they don't hand out any temporary bans, it'd be a good way to parse people to see if they're genuinely exploiting something versus testing it out.  Whatever though.
---
Beauty of datamining, I kind of want it just for the helmet...it's so alien like yet such a huge ripoff I love it.
---
Are they like insanely rare to drop?

Tried both mouse &amp; keyboard and controller. Neither works.
---
They are doing donuts at the starting line...
---
Sometimes they make a bit of forward progress but inevitably screw something else up and go back to square 1... And some times they manage to go NEGATIVE squares (*coufh*first*cough*)
---
For \[PC\]'s sake I hope it's not NW Challenges....  
---
It's agony to deal with the cheating
---
Yeah I've used fo76map but forgot about it when I was wanting to use it recently, so I really appreciate that you posted a link to it:) Never used map76, I think it's fair that he got banned though. Whether him and others reported the bugs or not, they were still purposefully using exploits. Would have been completely different if it was accidental findings that were being reported.
---
map76 was entirely generated using the datamined locations straight from the games files. it would eventually have had spawn chances for everything as well and the full loot lists for containers and eventually having the drop chances for events, quests, and enemies. you really arent going to find a tool like that anywhere right now
---
That's a valid interpretation.   
---
I would rather say that I insinuated that many who bought the game at launch were angry. I'd point at the many many negative critic and user reviews that flooded sites following launch.   
---
However the problem in doing that is that to many who defend the game as it was at launch and many of the months that followed, that would not be enough.
---
Level 124, I'm not sure how many hours. I have done most of the game... Haven't launched a nuke yet, haven't done the vault raid and haven't finished the Burrows. But I'm still loving it. Hell I'm spending most of my time in the game helping out a few friends
---
Well, you're a user.  If you see something wrong, go fix it.
---
&gt; o76map is unfortunately not very accurate due to being generated by user submissions
---
Used it for months - it is VERY accurate.  I use it to locate my camps near resources that I want to mine. Sour grapes much ???
---
I guess all your work with the banned guy was in vain because he decided to take his baby-rage out on the community.
---
I've used fo76map before and it's been pretty accurate for me. I've never used map76 though, but it does seem like it would have been more accurate because of data mined locations.
---
I think you can assign it so that it shows in cases of death or dripping or both. Which means you could have it just for ease of finding when you want to give someone something. That said... I agree no way I‚Äôm making my junk easier to steal!
---
Whats your discord tag your familiar
---
Why?
---
Why is it not sufficient to say "Hey, we found an exploit, we think this is what causes it, you might want to look into it?"
---
The discord in the right pane is a little active. Try there.
---
You are misunderstanding the phrase helps, good loot helps, as in it aids your chances, also the crossbow is crazy strong.
---
&gt; but it does seem like it would have been more accurate because of data mined locations.
---
I tried to use it several months ago.  The user interface was crap and I didn't find it significantly more accurate than the FO76Map.  I gave it up because it was too awkward to use.
---
because when you give the developers such little information they are more likely to ignore it due to the amount of time it would otherwise take to find it themselves. most of the things we report in this manner get patched relatively quickly.
---
I remember seeing this post a couple of weeks ago. If you can change CE exe's name and window name, that might be enough to fool the game's basic anti-cheat detection, but maybe there's other things you would need to do too, I don't know.
---
If you used CE this way and didn't change any of memory values there should be no way to get flagged. So what happened to get him banned? Did he accidentally modify some memory values, or just tell Bethesda what he did to find this exploit? I didn't read all of his stuff btw.
---
I never used the now closed map but the map you linked is straight up missing many items. 
---
If you look at Watoga that map says Watoga has 0 bobbleheads and magazines. I finished my collect magazine atom challenges there thanks to Mappalachia and know there's actually around 5 bobblehead and 9 magazine locations in Watoga.
---
Honestly kids today, funny my son is nine also, we play a lot of games but his favourite is cuphead and he‚Äôs on the last boss,(been on him for a few days).
---
I couldn‚Äôt fathom doing that by myself üòÇ
---
with how much you are pushing the site its almost like you're the one who made it and are profiting from the amount of people who go to it due to the ads hmmm.
---
Text chat would be a horrible idea. Not just because it's too slow but also people would just constantly flame on there.
---
Definitely into relevant emotes though. Maybe even incorporate some of the ideas from Apex Legends like pings for loot/loot boxes.
---
Wisdom and strategy beat youth and accuracy.  Lay traps, ambush, eke out every edge you can.
---
I use Ublock Origin so I don't see no stinkin' ads.
---
I have no clue what you are trying to ask? I didn‚Äôt mention anything about discord.
---
Kinda glad I never used it then. I've never had any problems with fo76map. Always leads me right to what I'm looking for, or at least the general area if it isn't accurate for some resources.
---
I sold one of them for 666 caps.
---
I've no idea what it does or doesn't have really .  All I know is that it has a reliable and easy to use interface and it's always worked for my purposes.  I hear a lot of really good things about Mappalachia so your info is good to know.
---
The thing about mappallachis is that you see *everything* which is overwhelming. There is no UI to it really. FO76Map lets me just see, say acid and fissure sites which is useful when I want to mine acid but NOT be located neat an SB. And doing that just takes me maybe 3 clicks.
---
I'm a former developer so I appreciate UI's that work well.
---

I‚Äôve got to ask, why are you still posting here if you hate the game?  I just figure you‚Äôd be happier posting about the game you like right now rather than stewing about how angry you are about a game. In the end, you should be doing things in your free time that you enjoy, like playing (or writing) about a game you love.  I don‚Äôt think you are going to convince people who like the game to dislike it, so I just don‚Äôt see the point.  Life is too short to be focusing on stuff you dislike.  
---
Anyway, good luck!  üëç
---
Yup
---
Instigating
---
I probably won't refund it, it won't change much as Bethesda have already cashed in and I've already played my good share of the game and might drop back in every now and than to mess around (we will see what happens with wastelanders) if they start kicking more content to fallout 1st than most likely I'll just Perma bench the game and uninstall it.
---
In saying that though I'm never buying a Bethesda product ever again unless drastic changes are made for Bethesda as a whole which means a complete wipe of management.
---
Oof. I will *not* have much time to get the skeleton. Thanks!
---
Any type of weapon with instigating will work or should I go with hunting rifles?
---
Pretty sure he's ruining his rotator cuff.
---
I'm pretty sure Mapalachia uses datamined locations from the game files
---
The more damage it does per shot, the better instigating will help. For example a hunting rifle with instigating is great, but not a minigun. Instigating is great on melee and leveling with melee is efficient on ammo
---
You got one shot by a cheater
---
"I'm in this and don't like it." I'm crippled in NW without my vats. Eyes and reflexes can't keep up anymore.
---
Ooooh. I was trying to figure out the agr issue then realized it was your level
---
mappalachia did indeed. in fact the developer of it works with both me and the map76 guy on the stuff that we do.
---
Even if I don't plan on making it a melee build would you still suggest using it to level up over range if ammo isn't a concern?
---
I'd pay for some useful pvp emotes.
---
It didn't aid those guys. My point is, every ameteur in the world has tips for victory, and ameteurs have no business offering advice. Learning how to use any weapon at your disposal is the key, not trying to find the perfect set of gear. Name a weapon that us considered trash, and I've probably got a video showing it wiping the floor.
---
me and the map76 guy both work with a group that works with the bethesda community managers to do this exact thing. we make sure that the things that we find work the way they are described and then send that information to the cms who send it to the developers. the bugs/glitches/exploits we report tend to get fixed much faster due to giving them all the actual information they need to fix it.
---
Love how you decided to delete your original comment on the post just so that the thread would be hidden.
---
Lot's of stuff can one-shot. Was there an explosion? Were you wearing armor?
---
Preferably they'd be free for all. There are way to many people out there that don't have or use a mic.
---
I'm sure they'll put something on the cash shop celebrating the 1 year anniversary.  It'll probably cost between $5 and $10.
---
At the very least, have a backup melee weapon. Melee is very strong and can make leveling faster but don't spread your points around, pick a weapon type and invest in it. Melee is still good without perks.
---
I'm one of them. I communicate well with my team but more specific emotes would be a huge help.
---
Probably because they like many fans wanted to like the game, are fans of the series, and got this shitshow instead.   
---
It's definitely not people who are enjoying FO76's fault that Bethesda has released a buggy abortion of a title, but it's hard for a fandom to not split and become adversarial when there's a chunk effectively going "yeah sure Bethesda manages to do something horrible every day but -I'm- having fun!" effectively fronting the check for this behavior to continue.  
---
"Why post here?" implies that not writing out sunshine and rainbows means you're somehow less valid of a customer or player. It's the subreddit for Fallout 76. It's going to be where discussion is posted whether that's constructive or full of criticism, I dunno what you expect.
---
You're getting old, you may have to give the classic Fallouts a go since they might be more your speed. Yeah, turn-based is great for the wrists and reflexes of people over 33 I'm finding more and more.
---
Dood your kids a god, I'm 13 and suck at NWüòÇüòÇ
---
The irony of strawmaning a person's argument while implying they're making a strawman is strong.  
---
You give me high hopes for the average IQ of someone still giving this game money.
---
I heard you I just disagree, people running mutations are dropping 5 perk cards to negate effects, 1 or 2 for frog legs isn't shit, it cost 2 in luck just to not lose the mutation when you wash rads.
---
Okay, what melee weapon is the best? Slow, Medium or vast? I'm making a bloodied rifle build btw.
---
Bethesda will promptly dispose of the video, never bothering to view it.
---
I love how you just ignore all the comments pointing out why the game is not worth your time. Stop feigning ignorance. Sorry if that seem harsh.
---
I find myself identifying so much with your situation, and as much as I called myself a fan, I didn't get 1% as invested as you did. Yet even in lengthy, and somewhat nasty forum arguments about this situation I have found myself involved with. I feel you, and I'm immensely thankful for the people that have been trying to make this right for us.
---
This alone is why I may give 76 another chance someday.
---
I can understand that, and I personally appreciate anyone that tries to help make the game better for everyone. But wasn't he banned for using exploits? I get he was reporting them, but it doesn't make anyone immune to being punished. That's just how I see it, I don't want to start a fight with anyone.
---
I don‚Äôt believe so, but someone will correct me if I‚Äôm wrong.
---
Thanks for all your promotion work for the other guy's site !
---
There's nothing wrong with you playing it and feeling you got your money's worth.   
---
There is something wrong with taking a lot of valid criticism over a frankly unacceptable PR/customer support end on top of rampant bugs that would shy away new players from any game, and comparing it to the complaints of a small child.   
---
I don't care if you, anonymous stranger, fork $700 down for a Pipboy sticker from Bethesda because that's your money to spend. But if my friends ask "hey, should I get Fallout 76?" I'm going to answer "Fuck no" because I value not wasting their time. And that's the prevailing take right now that is leading to dwindling numbers.
---
You are likely asking about buying Fallout on a Fallout subreddit. The answer is obviously going to be "Yes." 
---
Pings, flares (Since they're all ready in the game...), and/or Rocket League styled quick chat would be perfect. The emote wheel is buggy, and broken at the moment.
---
Yeah, same as asimo703 said. There's also dailies to do and events. Also, Some of the robot quest givers are kinda NPC, like Rose for example. I'd advise also not trying to just 'rush through' questlines, and just absorb the lore. Finding out what happened to the peoples of Appalachia and the survivor stories is also great.
---
He was testing to make sure what we had heard was true and how to do it in order to make the report. This is the first time we've had an issue like this in the months we've been working with the cms.
---
Excavator, cuz I'm always so hopelessly over-encumbered I can't move without it! :-(
---
The best damage for any build, melee or rifle, is stealth. Sneak attacks double your damage or more and it's surprisingly easy to sneak up into melee range and hit something. A slow weapon with instigating can easily kill most monsters with a sneak attack in one shot. You can do a power attack while sneaking too and all the bonuses stack together. One point into "escape artist" in agility will serve you well to keep you undetected.
---
As the kids these days say: "git gud"
---
It was a responder vendor bot spawn only until the Halloween event, so the market has been flooded for the time being
---
I can already imagine the controversies
---
Nov 12
---
That would be nice, but then everyone would whine that pc player had paid to win.
---
Maybe you should give up on this subreddit then.
---
Incredible.
---
For some reason, Fo76 prioritizes scrapping bug parts when you use acid at a workbench.
---
Edit: for example, if I have a full load of bug parts for the insect repellent quest, but stop at my camp to refine some lead ore before going to Dolly Sods, I will use up the bug parts before my acid in my stash while refining the ore.  Drop your bug parts on the ground before crafting and you will use the acid in your stash.
---
I personally use the tricentennial emote because I'm a moron who preordered this game.  Works great with Responder and Enclave outfits.
---
I think an enclave emote should be more serious like watching a marine salute so hard you think he's gonna throw out his back and gets unlocked upon gaining access and joining the enclave.
---
Guess we'll see.
---
Here‚Äôs the thing, I only played FO4 a lot.  I had FO3 and quit it a few hours in.  So I‚Äôm not a huge Fallout fanboy.  I just like this game.  To me it‚Äôs just a lot of fun.
---
I bought Fallout 1st, it deleted the junk of 13 of my characters that had been consolidated into 1 scrapbox.  Annoying, but I‚Äôm still having fun. I collect junk pretty fast anyway. 
---
And I‚Äôm not saying you don‚Äôt have a right to post here.  I‚Äôm just thinking you‚Äôd enjoy life more by focusing on things you enjoy.  I‚Äôm old, so there‚Äôs some free life advice.  (worth every penny!) üòú I don‚Äôt understand the people who keep posting about how bad the game is over and over.  If it makes you happy, go for it.
---
Thats Marine armor not Hazmat
---
Thanks, and I'm hoping in the end the work **All of us** are putting in will make it what it could be!
---
The pipboy icon does it.  If we have the ghoulish perk equipped it'd be a neat addition.
---
Only problem is...I've never heard of a ghoul going back to...Pre-Ghoul status.
---
It was a Vietnamese monk, and that comment is tasteless AF.
---
They are not. Pretty much got one every time I did the event. I visit vendors a lot and see everyone selling them usually pretty cheaply too. Ever now and then some joker has them for like 5k. I've seen some pretty crazy prices for crazy regular stuff.
---
I don't even get that much each match. I only get one kill two kills a match
---
It was Tibetan, learn some fucking history, and get the powerfist out of your ass.
---
Here's the video for evidence https://youtu.be/4atsiGHwuJM
---
Throw yourself into the nearest Fissure Site please.
---
Sounds like maybe it was reported to someone that might not have known what he was doing.
---
You have no evidence of that. I've submitted Twitch clips to them a couple of times. A couple of weeks ago I reported someone and included a clip, and I haven't seen them since.
---
Like, you really have nothing better to do than get on here and right this up to a random dude? Did you search this thread just for a name drop? Wtf dude?
---
Hopefully a stability patch. I'm being serious.
---
I now believe the majority of people that drops nukes have all moved over to there private servers. I‚Äôm mean who won‚Äôt want to do all the work of going thru the silos just to come out and have a bunch of strangers who did nothing to help launch getting all the legendary ghouls and loot. So it makes sense now
---
I feel like it's going to be a dead end that they forgot to remove from the BOS Quests or Heart of The Enemy daily. I watched the video but it's tying in a little too much with the Heart of The Enemy for me to think it's nothing more then something they forgot to take out.
---
It was because one of the scenarios he tested was being logged on the back end and was automatically flagged for suspension. There were other methods that he found that weren't known about that he reported as well. The biggest issue has been the lack of communication to those effected from customer service. It took me 13 days. 5 different tickets. A phone call to the customer support line. And working with community managers for 10 of the 13 days to get me unsuspended. I only recieved a human response once when I made a ticket about not being able to use my fallout 1st membership since basically day 1. It was a text just saying that my tickets were being closed as duplicates.
---
Oh I'm not advocating someone spend all their free time going "watch out! the game is awful! **todd howard wants your ass!**" Hell I'm probably going to close Reddit for the next month or so before I check it again like usual and go play me some roguelike before I get to bed for work.   
---
But I don't think just chasing the feel goods is the best advice. I don't enjoy doing chores or work but they do give structure and discipline which has its own positives. Likewise being able to articulate and identify "Hey, I really want to like this game, I forked cash on it, why for does my preorder mask smell like mold?" is as important as being able to identify what you enjoy.   
---
@Fallout, I was a big fan of the first two. Brotherhood of Steel wasn't great. 3/New Vegas were enjoyable but only after I spent some sleepless weekends in college modding them to hell and back, and 4 is honestly conflicting because it did a lot for the core gameplay loop but took away pretty much all the RP elements by making you Shaunny Boy's veteran dad or lawyer mom.   
---
Thing is I'm all good for genre shifts. Multiplayer Fallout I had an open ear for. I'd even acknowledge there's potential for a good game buried in all this insanity, I had some fun moments early on. But the company's just not doing their due diligence and this time because there aren't thousands of players doing intern work for free to fix it for them, it shows.   
---
But I'm preaching here anyway, nothing wrong with you enjoying the game either and I hope Bethesda supports the game well.
---
Sorry PS4
---
Maybe last laugh? He might have died rather then wait to be revived and dropped a grenade from his inventory? I think you might still take damage form this as he's not technically part of your team anymore, he dead.
---
Don't understand your point. Is it that some people are idiots (people know the ettiquette)? I explain why playing the instruments and rushing the clock is idiotic and they continue to get their level 40 scrip legendary losing out on who knows how many level 50s. They one shot legendaries and don't understand they are screwing everyone else FOR NO GOOD REASON? OK I can concede that maybe they are idiots, but I think it more likely they get a sick thrill from acting idiotic and selfish in a cooperative setting. Raiders? Please don't try and dignify them with such a term. Worms fits. Call them Worms.

Same I like how mr handy was black it was unique

Yikes, sounds like a mess... glad you got it resolved finally though

Super-mutants doing yoga? That's a bit of a stretch.

How many Atoms are you willing to pay for this feature?
---
A casual player that pays for the highest Tier paid version?
---
You can buy calibrated shocks plans for most PA from robot vendors. I‚Äôm trying to get the plans for my ultracite PA and it‚Äôs a very rare drop from SBQ. I was able to buy them off a friend. Nobody I know had gotten the Tesla coil plans for Ultracite lately though.
---
Well we agree on that.  I hope that Bethesda does better and that others will enjoy the game as much as I do.
---
No I was being funny. In all honesty, it has improved a bit overall, but not in specific areas. For example the FPS is better, but the game still crashes, has game breaking bugs, etc. They also can‚Äôt keep to a schedule. I‚Äôve done a little software development and I know it‚Äôs never as simple as people make it out to be but Bethesda is being ridiculous at this point.
---
That said I have 900 hours and I‚Äôll continue to play. I‚Äôve been playing mainly alpha state games the last few years so I‚Äôm used to the bugs.
---
I was thinking that myself. Bethesda would just make it an Atom Shop feature.
---
Honestly I wouldn't be willing to pay a lot. It should just be a feature.
---
Yea i knew you can get them from the robots, but theyre 5580 caps each, with level 3 Hard Bargain
---
I fully agree age is overstated aspect of gaming, and 100% agree it's a case of use it or lose it too.
---
6k In 7 hours of grinding.

Nothing beats the feeling of a TSE even if they did nerf them into the ground.
---
TSE still drops, friends getting them at the Purveyor.
---
&gt;No it isn't. Furthermore, this isn't vigilantism. It would be if the guy tried to punish or apprehend someone for cheating, but just figuring out how he did it and then reporting it \*directly to the cops once figured out isn't vigilantism.
---
Fair enough, I thought you were referring to the supposed anti-duper the earlier comment mentioned. The point I was trying to make is that, trying to do literally anything on 76 without being able to speak to a human being at all times to confirm that you're not going to be banned for the most innocent of things, like picking up a random pile of junk that a troll left to get someone banned, can get you banned. No appeal, no refund, nothing.
---
That's the biggest part of why the game is bad, because the tiniest, randomest thing can get you banned without explanation (which legally isn't stealing, but if you sell someone a video game, which is considered to be a lifetime product, then ban them from using it within five minutes of playtime that doesn't include deliberate exploits, well, that sounds an awful lot like a scam, doesn't it?) and once banned, there's nothing you can do, even if you didn't do anything wrong, because there's no way in hell they'll ever admit they banned someone by accident.
---
The other big part, is that the people in charge ("Todd.") are taking people's money, selling them a demo and a promise that the game will be complete 'eventually', and then deliberately making the game worse and less fun to play so they can charge them for features that make the game fun again. After the Armor Nerf and the Repair Kits being announced together, followed by a sudden Food Spoilage Stealth Nerf, people were already predicting that Bethesda would sell some kind of refrigerator. And guess what they're selling now? A refrigerator.
---
I‚Äôm thinking of getting one of those to compare.
---
So? It isn't a matter of did it aid them, but could it have aided them, the outcome is irrelevant. Of course you won't find an automatic handmade and marine armour every time you spawn, but it sure doesn't hinder you if do. If you have the luxury of picking your engagements, sometimes it is best to not fight as it may attract more than what you initially signed up for.
---
There might be better ones for dps and shit, but it feels and sounds really nice
---
Hunters explosive faster fire rate primed.....can solo queen in about 8 minutes or so
---
Absolutely a beast of a weapon, don't believe me? Try it for your self
---
You are right, I have no evidence.  I am just venting frustration on Bethesda.
---
Fancy and (temporarily) exclusive skins for the scrap box (and other future things). Eventually the skins should be available for atoms, but fo1 ppl get them first and as a "free" bonus. Same for the tent, and possibly the riot armor too. 
---
Anything of function should be available to everyone without added cost, anything cosmetic can be monetized for atoms. If fo1 was more about getting discounted atoms, first access to new cosmetics (some for free), atom store discounts (some things), and possibly added access to some of the vaulted items. That is something people would be far more ok with. 
---
As for the private servers maybe a separate cheaper option, or there can be free servers but its less prioritized so there could be a wait queue or something.
---
Yea not cheap. I paid 10k for calibrated for ultracite. I‚Äôm working on getting the strangler pa from the vault raids and that uses Ultracite mods so I looked at it like two plans since two PA‚Äôs for 5k each.
---
I‚Äôd like to have all of the PA plans and mod plans eventually but don‚Äôt think that‚Äôll ever happen. Haha
---
I think this thing is outdated, it says pipe revolvers can‚Äôt drop as legendary, but I just got one
---
&gt;It should just be a feature.
---
It should be but Bethesda isn't the kind of company to add requested features to the core game without dollar and centing us.
---
I have seen the same position on other super mutants, looks painful.
---
 [https://i.imgur.com/bYRRDYN.png](https://i.imgur.com/bYRRDYN.png)
---
I'm pretty sure at this point most people don't need to make stuff up to dislike Bethesda.
---
That info is, but the list of possible affixes is useful, they are not weapon dependent.
---
Well this is perfect, this will make setting my endgame goals much easier, thanks for the help.
---
Can‚Äôt have FFR and explosive tho
---
But if it was a one shot would I still be full of health after downed and have to wait to bleed out?
---
My bad, i have a fr (faster reload) i was going to.fast, my apologies
---
With instigating the first hit is what matters so whatever gives you the most damage in one hit. Generally that will be a slow two hand. Same with the rifle. I think Handmades are pretty close to hunting rifles and with 40 ROF can follow up better. I don't think I've seen a rifle that is both instigating and bloodied.
---
Same would I bleed out from full health? I don't really play just thought I would grind the rewards but my cards really suck and no way to swap them as almost no doubles just shit rolls
---
Guess I should be glad the added overseer ticket as I quit the first time due to bad cards and hoped they would come up with a fix for screwed decks. Lol wishful thinking I suppose.
---
Looks like someone's just gotten their hands on the Karma Farma perk.
---
The devs are aware. They just don't care enough to do anything about it.
---
I'll never understand the point of playing a game if you don't actually earn the items or luck out and find them..
---
I was one shotted by a level 11 with one of those developer guns. At level 235.. I know levels don't mean much in this game but still it's just kind of sad
---
Your first sentence is a correct response. And I thank you for that. But to answer your question I do,can,will,have.
---
In scout armor or marine will have to check the video I took.
---
All good just wasn‚Äôt sure
---
But at least we know they can make a ban list pretty fast, so that will be fun to watch :-)
---
One combo removed that I don't think is reflected there is there are no Explosive energy weapons now.
---
If you are looking for quick easy caps I suggest two things:
---
1. Farm the mothman eggs in Point pleasant. 5 minutes to gather and cook and around 300 caps depending on charisma, super duper, etc.
---
2. Farm Blackwater Mine. Not difficult (I stealth melee and grenades) and lots of guns you can sell if you don't need to scrap them. At least 300 caps. You can server hop and do it over and over. Should have 1400 caps in under an hour. Plus much more XP than making hats.
---
Thats my goal too hahahaha, good luck to you
---
Oh and glowing steaks go for 10 caps each as well, so you can sell them.
---
My my fingers ttpr faster than my brain
---
On this communication topic, what are people using the map marker tool for? As a location to meet at or as a location where enemies are?
---
For the longest time I was rocking the Action Hero. I kind of hope they bring back those kind of weekly guns, as it was a neat challenge.  
---
These days I have an AAE .50 Cal that's supplanted it, but I still keep it on display at home.

This right here.

I doubt he needs the caps but my money would go to this guy. He‚Äôs a master at making believable camps, not the float in the sky ones you see all over the place anymore.
---
Charge backs themselves state in their requirements that they are to be used as a last resort, and blizzard are incredibly flexible and will refund you anyways.
---
Blizz (and Sony, amongst others) will instantly, automatically, ban your account for fraud in the event of a chargeback. Contact their customer support. If they refuse, contact consumer affairs. It states in their ToS that they can ban your account permanently for doing so, and if people are ignorant to that fact, serves them right. The companies cannot superceed law, so you can get a refund, but for digital purchases you shouldn‚Äôt ever just instantly do a chargeback.

No bloodied build is "unstoppable".
---
I accidentally started looting a gore pile of a player who died just after an event. It took me a moment to realize what was happening, and the other player was a bit annoyed until I dropped the stuff I'd picked up. Definitely did not look like a loot bag
---
Does this only apper when you die or does it also show when you drop items on the ground?
---
Usually when my team mates use it it's to point to the nearest spot to get away from the fire, or pointing at enemies they sighted.
---
Experience I suppose. I didn‚Äôt even bother with the rewards because honestly that game is just so trash in my opinion.

Not gonna force myself to do something boring to get a skin on a game lol

Lol my 11 year old will mute whoever is cursing too much,  he just doesn't want to hear it

Eso mechanics and group play. Most fo76 you can solo. Fo76 has no world bosses that take a team to kill using different mechanics. Eso had way more quests, dolmens, dungeons and raids. Way better crafting. Weapon and armour customising took a while but they nailed it. Unlocking colours via achievements.. etc. Npcs, writs.. list goes on. Hence a 20$ monthly fee is worth it for eso. Not so much for fallout
---
It has two basic features people have been asking for since day 1.

One of which they never said would be locked behind a paywall, actually explicitly said nothing but comestics ever would be, and wasn‚Äôt technically feasible.
---
Private/local servers and unlimited junk storage.
---
Those are massive things to paywall.
---
Hmm, it might be as rare of the skeleton outfit. 
---
Uncommon but not worth a 100+ caps for sure.
---
In fact, I think the clean ranger hat has a spawn location but I‚Äôm not sure about the outfit
---
Nope. It is not as common as jacket and jeans, but it is not a gem. All my characters have found it more than once.
---
Muaterybcharge your credit card for $20 and hope you don‚Äôt notice, and call it part of an ARG if you do.
---
How I got most of my lead as a young firebreather
---
Ah. And there's the key mistake. 
---
I do not HATE the game. I am ANGRY about the game. 
---
I played it through the main "storyline" at least up to the point where I decided that I didn't care enough to fight the queen. I adore the map design and so much of what the game could be. 
---
I'm ANGRY because they pushed the game out before it was ready and for some insane reason cut out all non-robot NPCs. Probably as a cost saving attempt after they realized that they could not implement loot boxes without massive PR backlash. And then they claimed that it was a key design feature so that you always knew real people when you saw them because only humans were human in game. 
---
This concept is poorly thought out there could have been complex non-human NPCs with dialogue trees and detailed interaction. Ghouls, robots, and super mutants for a start. Or humans sealed away safely and kept safe from the scorch. Rosie, the Grafton Mayor, and that Super Mutant merchant are all proof of that. 
---
But there is still an enjoyable game in there. Not a "good" one by most measures, but one that is quite enjoyable to certain people. 
---
For a comparison. There are people who do not comprehend the concept of a movie that is "so bad it's good". To them it's either "good" or "bad" but cannot be both. But there are people who can admit something is "bad" in so many many ways, but still enjoy it for the good that is within it. That, in a way, is the issue with the hate and fighting on this subreddit.
---
Anyway, I was ANGRY, but I'm not ANGRY any more. I'm just disappointed. 
---
I was hopeful for Wastelanders, however the move to bump in in favor of the poorly implemented subscription service and "private servers" had dulled that into just disappointment again.
---
You can take your gunsmith and craft a BoS recon rifle, level 5 and 20. That will be enough for the first 40 levels. By then, you will have your darlings.
---
Lol, dude literally doing BGS job bug testing since they‚Äôre too incompetent to, and you shit on him for trying to improve this trash fire.
---
Stay scummy.
---
I think the stability has greatly improved, even though the game recently crashed and I lost 4 hours of work.  I appreciate the addition of player stores and the scrapping robot.  My biggest issue is that I thought there would be an overall end game that we all, as a community, work toward, but I have not seen that yet.  I thought the whole kill the scorched would be part of that but nothing seems to have changed except we got a half price shopping opportunity.  This isn't a technical issue but a cultural one.  Private worlds only acerbates this as it allows us to abandon the rest of the community rather than strive for a noble end.  I can only hope that Bethesda will allow us to return to our roots as saviors of the wasteland.
---
There are some places where a large crate spawns - every now and then I get a suit of marine armor and a combat shotgun in the first few seconds
---
Player vending and the Purveyor were both good additions, but I think we need more events like Mischief Night and Meat Week. These were fun and brought half the players on the server together. I know Scorched Earth does this too, but most of the better events don't happen often enough, so there's not enough momentum to keep you there if you don't want to go through the (single-player) repeatable quests.
---
Going by what it says when I purchased it, you can do a combination or have both make a tombstone. For right now I just selected both... but I will probably change the drop bag back to a Halloween pale.
---
Fuck you.
---
&gt; Is there any known work around to get more to spawn 
---
Play with more people. As they enter the zone, they can refresh spawns.
---
I use tse, bought it for around 2000 caps back in the day haha, great for the SbQ , accurate and deadly , good for large groups 2 , makes you feel badass
---
Nice, weight reduction perks won‚Äôt be necessary for me. What would you recommend replacing them with?
---
Here's the thing. They never wanted the ability to respec at all so what doesn't count is more than they wanted to do if at all.
---
Devs don't do anything.  Some guy got sick of it and got a whole server together to kill a hacker over and over, and even after the video was posted the hacker still isn't banned.  Can't post the ign of the hacker, but some of you probably know exactly who I'm talking about.
---
They said Private Servers. They might want to play solo. That's the big issue here. Their "Private" server is actually recycled and already cleared
---
I need to get myself one of those 9yo
---
It needs everything that Elder Scrolls Online has.
---
1. Guilds and guild banks 
---
2. Persistent and dedicated PVP worlds where an ongoing land and power struggle are happening 24/7
---
3. Raids that have multiple boss encounters, and loot that matters, and team member abilities that are meaningful (tank, healer, DPS, chemist, etc)
---
This man has a very good point
---
Solid state hard drive
---
I load in before people all the time. So much so sometimes I‚Äôm geared and their character model has loaded in and they stand there like a lemon while I shoot them dead
---
Nice! Weight reduction perks won‚Äôt be necessary for me. What would you recommend replacing them with? I‚Äôm using Strangler Heart. It uses the same mods as Ultracite so that‚Äôs convenient as well! What weapons do you use?
---
Most people just wanted a 2-4 player co op version of fallout 4.
---
Same goes for The Elder Scrolls.
---
I believe if you quickly leave the server &amp; rejoin it fixes it. But I havent tested it myself.
---
Thank you!
---
Hold V to start building on a camp or workshop. You can Also go to the module and press E to access the menu as well. To place Camp,bring up your pipboy menu and press Z. Also there a no-build areas where you cannot place the module.
---
You might want a point in Demolition Expert if you plant to using exploding guns. You could also max out Action Boy. From there you could look at some more charisma perks, or Lock and Load is an option.

Treasure maps in the mire sometimes give you some.
---
You can no longer take items from the dev cell, its no longer loaded server side.  Players can still go there but they are not able to take any items from the containers
---
Once a week? That‚Äôs way too often
---
I wanted both, if we had a co-op only, i would have still been thinking "but what if there was loads of people not just us x"  
---
Like this game could work better if there wasnt just 24 people to a map, if server issues and engine issues were moot, this game would be cooler with say 50 payers per map, since currently you kinda run into other people, but also not really
---
I run five characters at the same time, camps at different places. Last update banned several areas where I used to camp. Some spaces near Flatwoods, the stop in front of the motel, something similar in Charleston... Those Wastelanders have it coming.
---
Grade **S** parenting!!
---
Not at all. It spawns regularly at certain places, like Bend Tunnel.
---
Yeah. I know. Answer still stands.
---
the remaining people who still play FO76 must have some mental disorder so Im not surprised a 9 year old shits on them.
---
Hahahahahahaha. Yeah tell that to all the people who got the banhammer because Bethesda wanted to look like they were doing something while they were trying to figure out how to keep people out of the weapons room.
---
You fucking tool.
---
So if I want another open loose spawn I gotta just pick up a load of everything and it‚Äôll come back ? Does the same go for all items including plans ? Are the item you need to pick up loose also or can it be from looting corpses ?
---
I sell my cores cheap because I hate power armor and don't use them at all. Some people do the same.
---
&gt; Lol, dude literally doing BGS job
---
LOL Dude literally has a huge opinion of what he can do.

Not every YouTube self-promoter serves a purpose.  In fact hardly any of them do.

---
I didn't even know you could vats players in NW.
---
Fixed
---
Nope. Not without scrapping another weapon of its kind. Well, assuming that there are many mods to unlock. Some weapons come with very few.
---
Raider. It looks realistic, immersive, like the kind of thing you would find or craft.
---
I don‚Äôt know if that is true, the problem I see (and this is partly because of the limit of 24 people per server) is that most people wanted this to be fallout 5 and a solo game. To them fallout has and will always be a solo game. And I think Bethesda did wrong by making this game able to be easily done solo. I love the idea of the countries best and brightest rebuilding West Virginia TOGETHER. I feel if they made the world with like 200 people and put a lot more focus into teaming up, as well as making persistent world, they would have done better. People should be able to make towns or rebuild existing towns. I think that would have sold their idea better.
---
Ever so tactful.
---
Oh alright. Thanks :)
---
I would take bandolier or strong back over pack rat. You should be dumping your junk regularly, maybe taking an excavator suit along to walk out after the battle with the loot.
---
I would take level one concentrated fire and level 2 long shot or vice versa.
---
Not sure if rejuvenated is best, with such low strength your ability to carry food and water will be quite restricted so it will take a lot of work to keep the card active. This is especially true if you plan to get speed demon, and it looks like you are. But hey, not vital. I would lean towards Ironclad lvl 1, Adamantium skeleton lvl 1, Good doggy (for backup especially with speed demon) and Cola Nut lvl 2 -swap it out to drink the cola . Did you know that nuka orange acts like rad-X without suppressing mutations, and nuka grape acts like radaway without compromising your immune system? Both for sale at whitesprings every day.
---
I like Nerd rage - even 1 point - for a chance to get out of tight spots, but that might not work for you since you might need gunsmith to make the best rifle mods.
---
Marathoner is useless as far as I am concerned. What's the hurry? Better used in thru hiker (again your carry weight will be puny with this build) or white knight. 
---
You might consider having some tormentor for a backup card (LVL 2 so you can swap out for starched genes if the sit is safe to do so) so you can cripple big melee monsters like deathclaws or Mirelurk Queens, or suicider mutants if you are looking to farm nukes.
---
If you find yourself getting killed too much consider scaly skin. remember that with class freak the AP reduction is only 12%
---
People don't understand that Cheat Engine is used by many game developers because of how it allows access and monitors memory.  
---
Just dismissing what happened because of a tool shows ignorance, it's like saying someone deserved what they got because of how they were dressed or what they had in their wallet.    
---
   
---
To be honest we thought the group was "White Listed" as the people we worked with on Beth's side were aware of the tools being used, and the results Bethesda got in return were "significant".  
---
And the map you've linked is not bad, but it's what has been available for nearly a year, the Map he created had **EVERYTHING** and the exact locations as well.
---
everyone knows...  
---
From the Dev's to the Customer Service reps and everyone in FO76..
---
LoL. your talking our your ass fool.
---
OP, I feel a lot like you seem to. We can dwell endlessly on what‚Äôs wrong with the game or just enjoy what it does well and have fun. 
---
It will never be the true Fallout game we all really wanted but it can be a hell of a good time in its own right too. 
---
With the exception of the occasional griefer, my experiences with the community have been really positive and I look forward to logging in each day.
---
As Victorium!
---
Can take multiple times to just learn one mod. A lot of weapons(not all) do have a fixed spawn point. Just grab once a day &amp; you'll eventually get there.
---
there‚Äôs a method that used to clip inside walls, has to do with placing the camp module. experienced it tonite, dude killed us and we couldnt hit them
---
Vampires FFR, basically you can only take radiation damage as everything else is healed as soon as you get hit as long as you are shooting an enemy.
---
it wasn't just one but keep thinking it was.
---
A friend's kid had to sit on my knee to even be able to reach the keyboard and mouse, but he was getting head shots before my ancient brain even noticed the other players on the screen. Little kids have weird skills at games.
---
I‚Äôve only played it a couple of times but did well with my group. I‚Äôm older than you. Muscle memory and dialing in the mouse settings to suit you is key when you get past about 30ish. I‚Äôm still pretty snappy when I play Planetside 2 and can usually still hang with the younger players. Learning your weapons is important too in other games - recoil patterns, burst fire, etc. picking your engagements goes a long way too even though you can‚Äôt really do that 100% of the time. I usually find a few weapons I‚Äôm good with (no cheese) and stick with those. Younger players might be *pretty* good at *everything* whereas I‚Äôm *extremely* good with a few things and bad at everything else.
---
Yes we do
---
I've been polling around and a lot of players are under the impression that this game has an anti-cheat. Furthermore, a lot of players still dont know any of this is going on. I think it only fair we make sure everyone knows how little bethesda cares
---
They never comment on cheating
---
Doesnt matter when you can buy an account for $2 on knock off websites
---
I dont care about the karma. Look at my post history. Ive been trying to spread awareness and support other threads on cheating. We need everyone's help to bring it to the spot light and keep it there. Bethesda would be forced to comment if all anyone saw on this sub was threads on cheating non-stop
---
Witch hunting is offering suspects with no proof. You have proof, you should be able to spotlight the.
---
Yeah my mistake forgot to add that to the end.
---
Hahahaha
---
\*\* Rolling eye emoji
---
Postponing quests isn't always reflective of not liking quests in general. I don't have a super high level character since I've split my gameplay among multiple characters, but zero of my characters have ever finished the main questlines or even come close. And I'm the sort of gamer who actually read every book in Skyrim and etc etc. equivalents in the Fallout series.   
---
The lack of new content is a continuous source of frustration for lots of people here. I don't have that issue because I didn't hurry to finish every quest &amp; new challenge &amp; etc. While everyone else is bored out of their mind waiting for wasteland to drop, I can just do the quests that they did so long ago that they can barely remember them. :P
---
Part of the Mick and Ralph's collection?
---
Darn. Didn't know you could make one for each and I missed the Halloween pale :(
---
It does technically have Anti-Cheat checking, but it's very easy to get around, Bethesda is aware of that and hasn't changed that fact.  
---
As for them not caring, that's a different issue.
---
I'm basically stealth although I tend to spend my perks more on weapon damage than stealth.  Generally I use the black powder weapons to soften targets and other weapons to finish.  The dragon has a 400 range so it is even good for aerial scorchbeasts.  So maybe that makes me a sniper instead?
---
Whats a BoS recon rifle?
---
The game is an absolute joke, I have never seen such a beloved company bleed so much goodwill through shoddy game design, disastrous PR responses, lack of transparency, parasitic marketing and an utter lack of care for their once loyal fanbase. What was once a powerhouse of ingenuity and forward thinking within the gaming community, has become a cancerous barnacle on the underbelly of it's last few fans, slowly sucking away at the precious little goodwill left. That's where I think FO76 is at, I could not be happier that I got it refunded (I am in Australia) utter waste of money.
---
Don't worry. If it makes you feel better. Im a freshman and I still haven't gotten a win.
---
Ballistic fiber and screws for sure are the top two, the other five can be up for debate but gears, springs, plastic, lead, and maybe rubber? Seem to be used a lot
---
I have the same issues at times.
---
Checking for modified files before entering nw is hardly anti-cheat. And i know itll flag your account for certain actions but overall, you can atill easily attach programs as you said. I agree that they arent caring enough and im not sure if its because theyre under staffed or just uncaring. Either way i think it would do us good to spotlight these cheats and get attention on the matter so that bethesda either takes more bad attention or?hopefully spends a little bit of money on a real anti-cheat or maybe even has 1 or 2 people play the game on pc looking for cheaters like a mod role
---
The weapon arc is unusual.  I run into it with the auto grenade launcher as well.  But it was so satisfying when that deathclaw popped up and I chain fired into his chest, knocking him across the island.
---
The way the interface is set up makes it really easy to accidentally scrap them. I do it constantly despite being aware of the issue. It drives me nuts because I am often playing solo &amp; find grinding that quest extremely boring &amp; am also a person who wants to unlock every single thing possible for my camp.
---
it doesnt matter
---
ill take that i suppose
---
alright thanks
---
I'm around the same level and quite surprised at the enjoyment I'm getting out of it. . If very well approximates how I play Fallout anyway.  not getting the theme park mmo feel at all that's great.  I'd be willing to play with you occasionally. PM me.
---
As far as the game performance, it got better over time. People were so pissed about the bugs and stuff when it came out, but they don't seem to get how MMOs work; they get improved on through patches almost all the time, and the same thing happened with TES:O. An MMO (and other online game formats) are never really 'finished', unless the game gets cancelled.
---
Depending on how newbie, you may just not have encountered one of the areas which has a side quest yet. The first part is theoretically a tutorial (which isn't very obvious because most of the tutorial info disappears so suddenly that it's easy to not even notice it was there).
---
Discovering, looting, crafting, building and farming takes so much time that trying to focus on the questline is hard
---
I saw this happen to a dead player right after we killed the SBQ the other day weirdest thing ever.

I‚Äôve finished second a few times. But again it was by hiding and crouching. I never even fired a weapon. I can‚Äôt aim and jump and fire like he does. It‚Äôs fun to watch him play. It‚Äôs BORING to watch me play. Haha

---
Sounds like an excuse for laziness
---
Well thank goodness! That‚Äôs one fewer person I have to compete against while I‚Äôm grinding out this xp.
---
The game remains hamstrung by the fact that they wanted to make some Fallout/rust/other games hybrid without any real direction. I was disappointed as soon as they said it woukd not be an traditional, single player RPG (with NPCs and solid quests and mods and more); in the span of one year, Bethesda has only lowered my opinion of the game. 
---
All I wanted was Fallout: West Virginia.
---
I feel like a simple exe rename would take care of that but i dont know.

Dude they‚Äôre awesome, but they eat a lot of candy. Very expensive to keep them happy.

---
&gt; Isn't this supposed to be "the best community ever"? 
---
In-game. This reddit sub is just a fraction of the entire playerbase.
---
Let's not blow smoke up the map76's arse. Yeah it seems that they got screwed. Could be wrongfully, could be legit. We have been fooled before with mr 900 hrs guy in the past.
---
We've collectively stood against anti-consumer practices like pay2win items, other anti-consumer practices like not refunding when there is a legal obligation to (Australia sends its regards), terrible game balance, proper PvP, unshakeable bugs (especially the ones that were fixed), poor communication, highly requested features like text chat (still going since beta), dupers, NW hacker and the list goes on. This is hardly a comprehensive list.
---
Every time it falls on deaf ears. And we're the players are the ones to blame? 
---
People like you are the worst, blaming players whilst ignoring the core problem - Bethesda.
---
Maybe try not blaming the victim and help push Bethesda even harder to actually deliver.
---
Just seen this, amazing walkthrough btw. Do you think one piece of chameleon armor is good or stick to all unyielding?
---
Sure pm me your psn and I‚Äôll add ya
---
&gt;They already did by unbanning them. They showed they didn't break any rules or they would remained banned.
---
&gt;It isn't a privilege to not be banned when you didn't break any rules.
---
&gt; Yes, but they didn't, as they are unbanned because they didn't break any rules. LOL
---
&gt; Look if you were right, bethesda wouldn't be unbanning them. But they are, so obviously they didn't break the rules or they wouldn't be getting unbanned.
---
 
---
&gt;What website? I'm talking about eckserah and aten\_ra's discord. The dataminers who were banned for reporting the exploit. I don't give a shit about map76, they had nothing to do with reporting this exploit.
---
&gt;At no time did I ever once mention map76, as I don't care about them. This is about them banning the dataminers for doing the right thing and saving their ass from a major fuck up.
---
&gt;Hell, if it was so against the rules why are they unbanning them already? LMAO
---
You mentioned bans multiple times, Even more than I did. You must be quite desperate to base your claims on something so easy to confute

He's a blatant cheater. He clearly uses an aimbot. lol

Definitely Instigating, IMO. I had a level 5 instigating bolt-action rifle that carried me until easily my 30s. (I was also building for VATs and sniping, though, so ymmv.)

---
I might need a little more! BFV is really strong now but I still am curious about how West Virginia has changed since I‚Äôve been gone!
---
Yeah, I suppose. Adding NPC‚Äôs will at least make the game *feel* different, even if it‚Äôs not a total rebuild. Hell, adding NPC‚Äôs is going to make it feel like FO3, FNV, and FO4, so what‚Äôs the problem? Unless you‚Äôre assuming that the writing is going to be bad. But if the writing is decent I believe Wastelanders will be a compelling and fundamental change to F76. I guess we‚Äôll see. My faith in Bethesda is wavering though.
---
I just returned from a looooong break and the game totally hooked me.
---
The influence of luck has been the subject of a lot of nonsense throughout the course of this game.  A guy with 15 luck was telling me about how he got better legendary drops.  When he read off his list of legendary items, most of his  legendary weapons and armor he'd gotten were the same as mine (I had 6 luck at the time). 
---
Someone told me that increasing luck increased you chances of getting a god tier weapon at the legendary vendor.   This person told me to consume formula P and I some other chem (or maybe alcohol?) Anyway I did as they directed. 
---
The legendary drops from the vendor were some of my worst ever.
---
It‚Äôs nice to want to help people but in reality you don‚Äôt learn gameplay from videos
---
Noooo nonononono. No. You people do not deserve that treatment. You treat the most devoted beth and fo76 fans like shit when beth decides to WRONGLY fuck 'em over. You come up with stupid excuses to justify every stupid decision beth makes. You keep on supporting these awful monetization practices. You're showing beth that it's ok to be a FUCKIGN SHIT ASSET FLIP DEVELOPER. YOU ARE ACTIVELY FUCKING OVER FALLOUT AND ES FRANCHISES FOR ME AND MANY OTHERS ACROSS THE FUCKING GLOBE. You DO NOT deserve ANY fucking respect. Idiots like you are S.P.E.C.I.A.L. - if you catch my meaning - and boy oh boy I'm gonna treat you like you're "special".

Seeing how active this subreddit is despite how often Bethesda is shitting on y'all I'd say it'll never happen, there will always be people who will enjoy the game regardless of how much the devs shat their pants.

If you are on pc there is an addon on nexusmods for exactly this feature.
---
Tried opening the ports that Bethesda said (80, 443 and 3000-3010 with the right protocols) but that didn't help either.
---
Another Pa doesn't matter, the problem persists.
---
When i get out of my PA i have no problems with movement. Only thing is i can't mine as much materials as i would do with my excavator PA.
---
It tells you exactly what luck does
---
Better fill rate for crit bar and better durability for your drops
---
It wouldn't be just game play videos. It would be step-by-step lessons, starting from the very basics.
---
Yes you can but it‚Äôs only very slightly better then unyielding piece, it makes big difference in pvp but very negligible in pve.
---
Niceeeee!
---
Well, I've gotten a dozen or so colored hats, but no good uniforms. If the colored ones spawn in the same locations as the weathered and dirty white variations, they're all over. Apparently red is a big get, though.
---
I feel your pain my brother.
---
Smoothskins are overrated
---
Thank you for more than proving my point all through my comments!
---
You offer 0.00% information to even possibly helping in anyway so really, don‚Äôt be shocked when literally no one listens to you. 
---
You‚Äôre a typical troll hating the world and anyone that thinks different. 
---
Yet you‚Äôre still here part of the Fallout group...haha! That‚Äôs hysterical...
---
Good luck in the hate, no one really cares and most are numb to you getting off on it.
---
Everyone commenting here correct, because the true factor is what you believe about what you can or can't do or what age does or does not do .. Whatever you believe will be true for you.
---
They actually changed the appearance of map markers for this very purpose almost 6-8 months ago.
---
Food has spoiled and or raw flux.
---
How does lore and complexity matter mechanically?
---
Ever played a bethesda game for the first time and been like "There's an unvisited location on my compass! I wonder what's over there...?" and just, like... Gone there to see what you might find, the stories of the people who are or were there, or possibly a secret weapon with an unusual quirk, or just get yourself pulled into a sidequest you absolutely didn't see coming like the famous "Getting drunk" sidequest in skyrim, or discovered something completely strange and unusual, like the serial killer's art gallery in fallout 4? Or the Order of Mysteries in 76?
---
Yeah, that's what complexity and lore does mechanically. Which is something i've yet to see in ToW, since most locations don't exist or have relevance outside the story.
---
In wow burning crusade I used to pay my 13 year old nephew to do pvp, arenas and battleground. He loved it and was really good.  I hated it and just wanted welfare epics to help me raid.
---
Maybe they increased the weight of something?
---
Exactly üòÇ
---
If a teammate hacks a terminal, he marks the location of the nearest enemies, then we go kill them. Or nuke them. Or we use it to mark our intended safe zone when we nuke.
---
Well, you must have ‚Äòlow standards‚Äô too since FO3 and FONV had their fair share of bugs too.
---
The emotes already available in game work very well, and this has been discussed already.
---
I‚Äôd take smaller camp budget and let FO1st people have more vending machines in exchange for scrap box. Hypothetically... 
---
I‚Äôve gone in for a month to get it and am filling it up with stuff as I‚Äôm sick of being over encumbered. Being over encumbered all the time makes it almost unplayable. I had 300 of scrap in my stash freed up instantly when I bought in and now don‚Äôt need to get into excavator PA just to fast travel.
---
It‚Äôs not P2W so much as pay to play...
---
Once I‚Äôve filled my scrap box, I‚Äôm back to ‚Äúnormal‚Äù until I run dry.
---
There's another power armor paint in the game through an Enclave quest line that hasn't been implemented yet.
---
What platform was this on?
---
I'm 24 and I'm already lagging behind compared to some younger friends. Probably doesn't help that I haven't played competitive shooters since I was 18.
---
My last few play sessions I've been 'exploring' too, there are lots of cool unmarked spots on the map. I've not found any good ones for loot as such but I thought they were pretty cool.
---
I won't spoil so this my be cryptic but hopefully you'll understand when you see them. Here are some I found the other day:
---
If you go to the munitions factory and the go north west you'll find a automotive monument which is pretty cool. Then travel west along the top of the map and you find some prewar outdoor types (on the map its marked with a load of trees). Then if head towards pickets fort you may find a mini moon shines  shack at the top of a cliff with nice views (I had my camp there a few days). Then after scrambling down past the fort I found runined barn with a load of fury friends in the loft.
---
There are loads of places which you'll straight up miss if you stick with visiting 'locations'.
---
its called small dick syndrome.
---
aka bullies.
---
I had 810/800. Dunno why.
---
If you browse this subreddit by new, people post videos of hackers all the time, which then get removed by mods so other people can't see that it's already been reported, which leads to them posting their hacking report video and the cycle continues. 
---
There really should be a sticky about not posting videos if they are just going to silently remove every post
---
Stalker, instigating, furious, explosive, and 2 shot are all fun effective options. Personal fave is vampires +any of the previous. Vampires explosive can be a game changer.
---
Dang when the game first game out I was camped right outside the munitions factory to grind some ammo for the mid game. Didn‚Äôt even think to go north! Figured the boundaries started around there. Thank you for the guide I‚Äôll follow it tomorrow.
---
Plastic and this list is perfect
---
I think the enemies  popping in from nowhere when you have to defend a workbench looks super tacky.
---
Hard work Harry is on it. Lay z Larry will receive your call.
---
im on ps4 too, add me if you want: Owl_No
---
I'm guessing you missed the entire part with merely exiting PA being a coinflip on if you softlock or not? I decided to give the game a try right around then.
---
Didn't take long after the honeymoon period to drop it.
---
I learned something today.  Thanks mate.
---
If you hold a rifle it should be smoother than unarmed
---
It will be stored. You can place it down again. Just don‚Äôt scrap it
---
Thanks all, really appreciate your help. 
---
atm I have skilled mostly in more dmg to non automated rifles, carry more stuff, less weight to this and that and so on. 
---
Doing some public events now, joining some death from above fight and so on :)
---
I think the way they implemented the BR  and the timing were awful, but I support having a fallout BR.   Just a less serious version that is f2p, not disadvantageous to new players because old players get perks, the ability to play as any class (Super mutant, robot, raider, etc)  and they could make money off of cool outrageous skins.  It should have come out before 76 was released , when BR was impactful.
---
Did you try just the frame?
---
Did you try another character?
---
Awesome. Thank you!
---
Sounds kind of like a you problem...granted I'm not a FO1st member either but it's kind of the way the cookie crumbles
---
Sounds like a pretty good score. Someone probably sold it.
---
Why do we need a new mode for everything? Faction wars can be done perfectly as adventure events, there is no need to create new modes that no one will ever play.
---
Just like joe
---
Wait for the modders, they will make one of the old games coop. Hoping for new Vegas.
---
I was wondering if they were experimenting with that. I mean fingers crossed &amp; all but we all know the chances are if it happened (very unlikely) it would be a paid for thing anyway. :(
---
You sound like a communist bro
---
I serve the Soviet Union
---
My entire family has played the Fallout series from the beginning. This game has been an enormous let down to all of us, and has stripped away so much of our trust and faith in Bethesda to be a good company that makes good games. This obvious cash graph has been one major disappointment after another, and is incredibly disrespectful to the supporters of this franchise. After being burned so many times by so many games, this one being one of the worst, I am seriously almost done gaming altogether. There's my two cents... happy Monday everybody
---
No food or raw flux in there
---
My wife is from the soviet union and she depised it
---
I was joking brudda
---
Glad it isn't just me weirded me right out
---
Im not lolz
---
Fight me
---
I get what youre saying though, the scrap box is nice though
---
You wont do it, no ballz
---
That was supposedly patched 2-3 Patches ago.
---
I‚Äôll bring my KV-1 heavy tank pussyboi
---
I am returning player after 20 years, how's the game now ???
---
Kv1?  What the hell is that sweetpea?
---
Ill bring a M1A2 that im actually military licensed for.  Where do you want to meet up?
---
Meet me at the park
---
Ill be there
---
I‚Äôm off to pick up my nuclear payload and then I‚Äôll be on the way give me 10 mins
---
Naw give everyone private servers.
---
Seriously though, what the hell is a kv1?
---
Cheers brother.
---
Regards,
---
Another 27 who can't aim for shit on an Xbox. PC is reasonable.....
---
Now
---
Experimental soviet tank
---
If you buy the ‚Ç¨699,99 a month subscription, bug fix, utility, skin and weapon pack you'll be allright üòÇ
---
I'm with you! Damn those early adopters...
---
Like the black eagle or whatever its called?
---
Shut up and take my money
---
Going for the many reasons that were posted already but there's ONE more for me : this will be the last Fallout game we'll ever get. Looking at the direction they're taking (MT, subscriptions), i doubt we'll see another game from them.
---
Nah just some fat armoured tank
---
 The KV tanks were known for their heavy armour protection during the early stages of the war, especially during the first year of the German invasion of the Soviet Union. In certain situations, even a single KV-1 or KV-2 supported by infantry could halt large German formations.
---
U r not alone
---
Now brosky aha
---
Agreed
---
Im too lazy to google right now
---
:(((
---
If you have a question about something, please put the question **in the title**. Reddit does not make it possible to edit titles, so you will have to post again with a LONGER, MORE DESCRIPTIVE TITLE. Once again, MAKE A TITLE WHICH IS LONGER AND MORE DESCRIPTIVE.
---
Busy weekend dude, too much whiskey
---
Were any of your team left? If you're solo or the last one on your team you don't get downed you just automatically die. It's possible to one-shot people with the right perks (assuming another player sniped you) or someone cheated I guess.
---
That'd suggest the OP had a joke.
---
Don‚Äôt even talk to me about whiskey O_o bad memories
---
Nah. It‚Äôs a big boi rip off
---
If I actually play full bloodied I die endlessly, so I don't really think it needs improving.
---
Oh so good memories though
---
You believe a 9 year old is doing that shit? Nah
---
visit tanagra town..
---
you'll be amazed
---
Also? Yea but bad memories recently. Ain‚Äôt drinking jack again. What has this post turned into?
---
Yellow print on the front that says "STAFF"
---
You actually don't need that much junk. 
---
If you do, buy a F1 sub for one month.
---
There's the fun detail that the population counter actually counts how many players are in Watoga. So, if no one else is around, as you approach it ticks up from 0 to 1.
---
x4 not double
---
You are getting way too high FPS indoor and that's whats causing it - had the same problem for months.. Reenable vsync in the ini. (iPresent..)
---
Lolz, something about something for free, all out mbt warfare, the soviet union, and drinking whiskey .
---
Excess junk from scrapping camp items?
---
Owl_No is my psn 
---
i wanna buy some plans of yours
---
Walk place to place, dont fast travel,
---
theres a place far to the south With Some rather entertaining things at the top of a cliff
---
there‚Äôs another place similar to the car monument
---
I‚Äôm. L151,  tonight, i  just I discovered 2 new locations in the Ash heap...
---
I‚Äôve definitely been there but it‚Äôs been a while, this is a good reminder to go revisit.
---
Fuck yeah!!!
---
I‚Äôve never gotten that deep into the ash heap honestly. I made a few rounds around it, maybe starting at the apartments and just moving further in would be a good trip.
---
This is the enthusiasm that I‚Äôm here for
---
Hell yes.
---
Yeh I was in whitesprings vendor yest and he had a heap of 3 star weapons for sale, 150-800 caps. I figured someone had just sold them all. And lots of times recently the legend exchanges have gear in them from recent trades, I never noticed it this much previouyly
---
No need to take everything so seriously. Obviously thats the usual format. But does it really matter? It's just text on the internet.
---
A quick tip. pointing out the obvious, and being seemingly negative towards something, for no reason other than to point out said obvious note, makes it seem like you're baiting the person into a long winded and troll-esque discussion.
---
&gt;With the current crafting system there's no point in craft gear to use (or sell to others) because they aren't legendaries.
---
Ain't that the truth.
---
Craft/ Scrap to learn mods so that you can upgrade with Legendary drop.
---
Making the circle close faster depending on the player lobby count would be a good change.
---
From the mouth of babes as they say, keep with it and join him on a team.
---
Well, you certainly gave a long-winded spill.
---
&gt; and I‚Äôm not paying ¬£100 for fallout 1st
---
Why do people keep saying this like it is the only option? You don't see people bitching about WoW being "$180"...
---
inb4 "Free respecs for all Fallout 1st members!"
---
I know i will get downvoted but you cant deny you thought about it at least.
---
When Fallout 5 comes out. If Bethesda survives that long.
---
Imagine gun games are guitars...... You don't hear about many professional guitar players that started playing in their 30s.
---
Our brain takes in knowledge better when we're younger.
---
One thing I will say though, aiming on a console and aiming on a pc or even smartphone these days is a totally different ball game, I'm. Useless in nw on PS4 but give me cod mobile and I'm a god.
---
If you're using the mod manager off Nexus, it will install and setup your .ini file correctly.
---
They're still working for me, the only things that you need to update regularly is sfe and if you  do custom strings (show components on junk before you pick it up)
---
It's weird playing on a local network, one play will have a ghoul running at them, the machine next to them will have the same ghoul sliding along the ground.
---
Normal scorchbeasts also drop them.
---
I submitted a ticket over a week ago, still waiting for a response...
---
Pre-patch 14 cract or scrap energy weapon i think
---
I don't understand
---
Hornwright industrial headquarters has a number of iron ore. They are located in the basement where you get the excavator plans. Be careful though legendary super mutants and sometimes a wendigo will spawn there.
---
I got the Tomahawk plan too from Leader of the Pack lately and I noticed a few other players from my discord found the plans too. Isn't it a bit weird that a lot more of these show up lately? I tried to farm that plan for weeks if not months and now it is popping up everywhere. Not complaining though, it just feels a bit odd :)
---
Last patch I got evicted from my cave base :(
---
I did it manually and then used cloudys post installation. I've managed to get chat mod and better inventory working but show health isn't working and that's the one I want to work the most as seeing the actual health  values and percentages of creatures is very useful
---
This is missing data such as npc spawners, activators and flora. Only one location for Nuka Cola on that map? Are you smoking donkey shit?
---
Lore-wise, ghouls do live the longest at a cost.  I guess playing bloody is the closest thing to being a ghoul.
---
Just because someone has ground out the incredibly rare and expensive gear and acquired the skills to thrive at less than 20% health doesn‚Äôt mean they deserve to be nerfed.  If your build and gear is mediocre, you will eat shit constantly at 19% health or less.
---
Playing bloody really is my end game now. Acquiring a full compliment of three star best in slot gear, soloing the most difficult quests, min/maxing to 0% waste, etc. I find it really enjoyable, which surprises me as a typically story-oriented player.
---
What exactly are you talking about? The only weapon they've made weigh 100 pounds was the paintball gun, which was a dev room item and nobody was meant to have it.
---
Why are so many people in this thread acting like their blood builds aren't running Serendipity and Nerd Rage
---
bloodbuilds are tankier than someone with 10 endurance it's dumb and everyone who has PVP'd one knows how dumb the build is.
---
I have 3 bloodied handmades &amp; I agree with you. Why would I use anything else.
---
 I guess that's why bethesda released the fixer.
---
Can you get it as a drop from s legendary?
---
  Eventually they will replace the most highly duped weapon in game. Hopefully they up the drop rate a little though as the price dictated by some traders that then everyone else follows is ridiculous.
---
I really don't care about this game anymore, bored of the same old quests, daily scrip limits stop me farming, so many bugs and blue screens on PS4, wastelanders pushed back and basic features locked behind a subscription.
---
The other day, I hit a guy from 100 yards out with the crossbow as he was trying to revive some other teammates.  One bolt - four kills.  I mostly just pulled the trigger hoping for luck - and that day I had it.
---
Sorry i‚Äôll correct myself, you don‚Äôt learn to play from videos. Though those basics would be nice if there is some completely new people coming to the game.
---
I got bored of NW very quickly, because the map is quite small and the circles very predictable. Has your boy ever played Fortnite? I play PUBG a lot and am a pretty ok player and that translated very well to NW and made it honestly pretty easy. If the kid has played other BRs he's likely in a very good place for it
---
The hat does, but I don‚Äôt know of a static spot for the outfit.
---
Hide and wait for the right moment. Snipe from the hillside. Let everyone else kill each other off and wound each other first. Let the Scorchbeast secure the victory in the end.
---
I think for actual content for 76 they've been kinda ok, Wastelanders will be the thing that makes or breaks it for me finally. Though for business practices they've been absolutely fucking terrible and should be ashamed of themselves.
---
I'm a hider too, but even \*I\* think hiding in the water is trash! lol  But, you do you!
---
I would welcome a change that made 1st person view smoother in power armor.
---
In the interim, I spend 90% of my time in 3rd person view.
---
&gt;and get back to work
---
I roared, good show :P
---
I run solo crossbow. Armor is irrelevant to me because if I get in a pinned down firefight, I've already lost.  I'll shoot my three bolts and move to another position.

Either they're doing something really wrong, don't have the right gear or are trying really hard to keep the current broken "meta" as it is.
---
Interesting content.
---
I‚Äôve got a couple of ideas with tie-in to another quest.
---
Will test it out later today
---
Why bother with anti cheat or bugs, when you can just ban people who report them
---
Sad to say it, that now you will most likely get banned.
---
Interesting thank you  :)
---
Yes usually it tells me to bog off :D
---
Never thought of that. I was camp building :)
---
This did the trick! Thank you so much!
---
Honestly I think they‚Äôve put in a lot of work. Unfortunately it‚Äôs all been one step forward, two steps back. I was hoping that catering to a paying, always online audience would light a fire under their asses to finally fix the bugs that have plagued their games for over a decade, leading to much better quality in future titles. But now I‚Äôm convinced it‚Äôll never change.
---
Keep fucking with it . Put down your crops and THEN place it on top. It will protect them. I haven't had to repair mine since I put em in there. Keep an eye on the stairs when placing low.
---
&gt; I don't see how.   
---
&gt;  
---
&gt; Bethesda doesn't get paid per lie they tell, they get paid per Atomic Shop item they sell. 
---
If a company outright says "Yes, we have data that shows that the vast majority of our player base hates microtransactions but we're still going to put more in anyways," or "our game sold terribly in comparison to the previous game" that will only create negative PR and may hurt the chances of people trying out Fallout 76 and buying their microtransactions. That's why almost every single company in existence refuses to say anything negative about themselves unless its a last resort measure. Its also why most companies have stopped publicly posting playerbase counts and sales figures unless they're really high. So yes, lying about the actual state of the product is financially beneficial if the news about said state is negative. That's why Bethesda refused to admit they were breaking their cosmetic only promise as they were adding repair kits and scrap boxes, since doing so would only hurt their possible sales more.
---
&gt;  If you stop being so emotionally invested in their decisions and just think of them as just another business, it's very easy to analyze their actions and make various reasonable conclusions. 
---
I think you're misunderstanding my argument. I'm not saying that Bethesda are adding microtransactions just to be dicks. I'm saying Bethesda are being dicks for adding microtransactions just for the sake of profit and not because its what they're playerbase wants. Hell, I wouldn't be surprised if they calculated the game has such a terrible reputation and the sales have declined so badly that its less risky and more profitable to add p2w microtransactions and tank what's left of their playerbase even more than to not do any p2w microtransactions and attempt to increase the playerbase of game largely considered as laughing stock and failure by the overall gaming community at this point.
---
So yeah, I'm fully aware that Bethesda could lose access to a huge money source if they don't add them, I just don't find that a good justification for pay to win microtransactions. Plenty of very profitable live service games have been able to be honest with their communities and have cosmetic only microtransactions. Bethesda, especially with the large amount of goodwill they had prior to Fallout 76's launch, should have had no issue creating a fairly priced cosmetic only microtransaction system.
---
&gt; I did some quick research and found [this study from The NDP Group](https://www.npd.com/wps/portal/npd/us/news/press-releases/2016/latest-report-from-the-npd-group-provides-insight-into-gamers-purchasing-usage-and-perceptions-of-additional-gaming-content/?utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_content=Oktopost-twitter-profile&amp;utm_campaign=Oktopost-Press+Releases) (a market research firm) that found that 78% of players are willing to purchase micro-transactions. 28% of players had made a micro-transaction purchase within the last 3 months. 
---
You might be right about that number. The reason why I said 5% isn't because I saw in one article about the industry as a whole, but because that's a common number I hear from developers and reporters when they talk about or speculate what percentage of players actually buy microtransactions in live service games built around them like Warframe or free-to-play mmos. So it could totally be that my sources are wrong, the numbers are outdated, or they're not representative of the whole industry. The only reason why I think your source might not be accurate is because it doesn't seem to separate microtransactions from games generally played on PC and consoles and microtransactions from games on mobile, which is definitely going to skew the results since microtransactions are a lot more commonly accepted and practiced on mobile games than they are other platforms.
---
&gt; Because I recognize that just because it's profitable doesn't mean that the majority loves it. 
---
Then why would you make your whole argument for it being popular be based around it? Microtransactions being profitable has never been a good sign that they are popular. Lootboxes are insanely and consistently profitable, but they're also insanely and consistently hated by most people. That's because there's a tiny percentage of players who are willing to spend hundreds of dollars on microtransactions. So trying to say that consumable microtransactions that give you in game advantages being profitable is stronger evidence about their true popularity than looking at all the online responses to them is a poor argument.
---
I believe it's the upfront honesty from those specific subscription models. 76 was introduced as a one-time buy then they eventually added 1st.
---
If the model was introduced upon release, I'd imagine it'd receive less hate on that end, it'd still be there to a degree but less.
---
Bummer. This game is more fun with friends that is for sure
---
Not trying to put crops in it haha, trying to make it like the steering areas for a pirate ship I'm building
---
&gt; **Any Moderator locking or removing this post is enabling the spread and anonymity of these pariahs and content with them ruining our game.** 
---
There is a specific rule for this sub against witchhunting. You're just the arsehole breaking the rules.
---
Also, it's not on the players to police this crap. It's Bethesda. Push Bethesda to do the right thing rather than demonising the mods because they don't buy into your impotent vigilantism.
---
I will start to explore like this when I start questing. Following the quests by walking and discovering all the stuff in the compass is a good start

PC .. Duping is getting really bad again. Deleted someone yesterday who's sitting in team chat openly giving another duper a list of weapons they want copies of. Vending has fallen off a cliff as the result... Private servers aren't helping matters when each one of them is throwing 30+ weapons/armor for sale cause they can just lather rinse repeat on their baby worlds. What fucking idiot came up with this? Thirsty players and dupers got this game on the ropes. No new content coming could be the final nail.
---
Cheat engine is detected by Fo76. It means players starting use it will be ban within few hours.

In the meantime, however they have bit time to use cheat.

&gt; someone with 10 endurance
---
Endurance is terrible; there are few useful perks and it provides only a pittance of health. **Strength provides more surviability** via the Blocker and Barbarian perks. If your build has 10 endurance consider reworking it from the ground up.
---
&gt; for about 2 years.
---
do you buy new laptops every 2 years????
---
most laptops are horrid to perform maintenance on, while a desktop can easily become Theseus' desktop and last a lifetime through occasional upgrades
---
Its supposed to be hit-scan(instand), any lag you see, is either bad server or bad netcode related.
---
Yup, Strangler Heart PA, need full set of 6/6 part for the effect to work. The effect procs for every attack, which makes explosive shotguns great in combination with it since each shotgun pellet is an individual attack and each pellet explodes individually for a second attack. So much acid!
---
I can relate. 33, father, but I‚Äôm loving NW so far. Now lvl 46, all perk cards unlocked. Here some of my better games: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLuQSne8cw6GJJkYE6h4UgX2rFEZ-fAT45

---
Good on ya for the nuke they deserved it
---
What do we need data miners for though? Don't they just make the game easy as shit? Need something? Look it up! All done. Where's the effort?
---
 I wanted game stability and Beth said I have to pay for it monthly. Hard pass. Maybe they are gearing up a map of their own that's behind a pay wall. Wouldn't surprise me at this point. Wont surprise me when Thirsty players buy that dumb shit too.
---
\&gt; What‚Äôs changed in the past 3 months?
---
Nothing.
---
You forgot to mention that there is a PRO version of this app meaning the creator is hiding features behind a paywall as well as including ads where as map76 was completely free as well as AD free. 
---
Also unlike map76 the website you linked has everything pop up at once and you have to eliminate what you're looking for one at a time which is completely different from map76 search what you want feature. 
---
This website is objectively worse to map76 and you're also a disgusting person for calling the creator of a free community tool a cheater knowing full well that he wasn't cheating for personal benefit but to test AND DIRECTLY REPORT vulnerabilities to Bethesda. As well as provide community tools to the fans of this poorly released game. 
---
He was doing something Bethesda should be paying other people to do (for free) but aren't because this game clearly doesn't have the proper funding for what it aims to be. 
---
Yet he was banned for it. 
---
Disgusting.
---
That‚Äôs.....depressing
---
Sorry that you feel cheated. PC users should ask for a refund because of the cheating. Or grab a reliable anonymous tunnel app and follow a cheat guide to the best fuckin Fallout 76 cheater the world has ever known.
---
I am on XB1 and we don't cheat. So I don't fuckin care what happens on pc.
---
Never tried it. My camp is west from Watoga so i always visit this place from west. Sometimes i FT to Watoga station to avoid those pesky protectrons.

---
Results from first 2 pages of just looking up "Bethesda ban". All the others are repeats or talking about the ban from this thread.
---
But then you're too busy defending possibly the worst multiplayer game of the decade. Keep it up, Bethesda needs people like you to keep 76 running.
---
Some people would refer to them as "traitors" sine they deserted US force. President Richardson is disappointed.
---
Yep my girl was down the way that's how I didn't just die instantly I think once downed
---
Well, some bugs were fixed, some introduced, some are still with us. New monetization in form of a sub, that I would not recommend getting, as no one should be paying extra for the state the game is in. NW is still infested with cheaters and duping is still a thing. PC perspective, no idea about consoles.
---
Otherwise... Nothing. 
---
Ah, vault raids, in case you didn't catch it - a glorified version of "where's Waldo" with endless enemies that give almost no xp and crappy rewards system.
---
Plus I had to sit and watch as my teammate spawned to far apart for gear
---
That‚Äôs......disheartening to say the least. Really was hoping the bugs would be fixed and new features be introduced, but instead they left it stagnate. Well, thanks for the update man, cheers
---
Fallout 1st Premium Deluxe
---
I have a bloodied handmade but prefer my bloodied lever. The bloodied handmade ammo requires daily crafting. Which is a pain to farm the material.
---
As I see it, the upcoming delayed DLC will either save the game, or be the final nail in it's coffin. Given the track record - I'm more inclined to believe the latter, unfortunately. I simply don't believe that a major update like this will not break half the stuff that's somewhat working now.
---
That sounds pretty dickish. Why block other players just because they're role-playing as something else?
---
Makes sense, major DLC additions bring up a lot of bugs in the core game as well as new bugs in the addition, at least that‚Äôs been the case in Bethesda games forever
---
Sadly - nope. I‚Äôm on XBox
---
His name is Phoenix,
---
No, they didn‚Äôt. I‚Äôm Not taking about the icons for C.A.M.P.s or whatever. 
---
The objective markers that you/teammates can place on the map to create a reminder for yourself or whatever.
---
"Luck is not a factor" It's all down to percentages.  
---
Not arguing or debating the op, I just don't see Luck as a real tangible element of life.
---
man cheating is a problem for everyone; less so but still clear and painful - trying to farm for the glowing skeleton has been agony on PS4 for me
---
This is amazing. I have a few alts and I've made them all the same person from another game. This would be super funny for me!
---
I'm worried that this is my CAMP location. Does this mean that I'm a Chinese sleeper agent?
---
legacy weapons means they don't currently drop anymore
---
Epic blog boomer
---
That's the Brotherhood vendor at Watoga, I'm speaking about the Watoga trainstation vendor.
---
I couldn't forget my boiiiis Phoenix &amp; Chad..
---
its not detected .. been using it since the beta . still not banned
---
You totally forget how hard it is supposed to be to get one. The chances are without duping you'd likely not get your hands on one at all.
---
Wait so people got items from NW to Adventure Mode?
---
Agreed. For everyone. Should help with retaining players or even attracting new ones.  
---
(For the record, I am a 1st Member, but there's no harm in giving everyone a little extra each month).
---
I know what legacy weapons mean. I'm asking for a list of them. Also the drop rate of tse weapons. And if tse the dragon is a legacy weapon
---
That's what smurf accounts are for.
---
What you mean by list of legacy weapons? You want a list of duped items?
---
Any item that's worth something is a duped item at this point.
---
You talking about pvp? Are you one of those people who expect to get shot several times with a rifle and just shrug it off with a stimpack? I think you are the delusional one. The handmade is shaky as hell compared to a legacy laser rifle with the same rolls, and it's less damage than a fixer with the same rolls. 
---
Where exactly do you draw the line with rifles?
---
Like that's ever gonna happen. This subreddit started a riot cause 'contributors' were caught using cheat engines. They demanded unbans on these people. These numbnuts are perfectly fine with cheats. Go post this somewhere else
---
The amount of ignorance on this post by people is astonishing. It's a software tool which has the unfortunate name as Cheat Engine. Does using Cheat Engine mean you are cheating? No it doesn't. 
---
Since Fallout 76 can't be modded by the community to fix bugs, people decided to do the next best thing by retrieving all pertinent data for bugs/exploits and making sure it gets to the developers. 
---
Thank you for coming to my TeDTalk.
---
 I just wish they fixed bugs as much as they updated the Atomic Shop.
---
How about ‚Äûplease‚Äú?
---
You get legendary fixers from murmurgh once you learn the fixer plan that drops from encryptid.
---
I think this is definately needed, but fix the cheating and duping as a priority.
---
I'm still waiting for them to unshit plasma rifles, that might pull me back into the game, for a bit at least.
---
Regarding the laser rifle you're mentioned - it also has durability of a wet napkin, so there's that.
---
Your welcome. Happy Wandering!
---
It's even worse than that. There are around 40 base melee weapons and 50 base ranged weapons in the game that can drop as Legendaries. There are 18/4/6 and 22/7/9 1st/2nd/3rd tier legendary effects for melee and ranged weapons, respectively. (If the fandom wiki is to be believed.)
---
Provided all have equal drop chances, the probability of getting any specific 1\* ranged weapon is 1:1100, for 2\* it's 1:7700, for 3\* its 1:69300. The numbers for melee are 1:720, 1:2880, 1:17280, respectively. And that's if you can choose the weapon category, i.e. the Purveyor.
---
Yeah, we're past the "without duping" argument for quite some time, mate. Keep up.
---
What prime plans do you have?
---
That made me laugh
---
Do you even grasp the concept how bug reporting works? I mean proper one, with *REPRODUCTION* steps and all?
---
It's a game and I'm going to play a game I bought. Not everyone gives a fuck like you fools do. I'll continue to play the game and adolescent school boys like you can go back to your bedrooms and bitch and moan on the internet like someone cares.
---
Oh you do get banned for using cheat engines. This game actually has anti cheats altho it doesn't work that well. It's just that too many people know of workarounds and only stupid ones get caught. Not that I think these banned people are stupid, maybe they got too confident and used cheats without any safety measures then got pissed that Bethesda didn't lift their bans right away
---
Oh but I though I need to work for Bethesda in order to make a difference. Otherwise I'll get a ban. Lol.
---
Cheating and duping is probably the cause.
---
I have that issue quite a bit because my camp is in a popular place. I wish they could or world check it first. It‚Äôs kind of annoying having to spawn in and look for another multiple times.
---
They did. However It was tied to the survival mode. With Survival gone, no challenges for us.
---
How do you know sacrificing a goat wouldn't help?
---
Leave reproduction to Bethesda. All you have to do is report. Just because you found out a method to assassinate someone doesn't mean you actually have to kill someone yourself and then call the police
---
PS only? Otherwise I'd like to submit my Lumbermill:
---
https://youtu.be/LCZ9toQZTV8
---
Max. budget build, took around 20 ingame hours.
---
Even quicker if I had the prime receiver on, problem is I've been too lazy to farm steel ahaha
---
The only issue I have on PC is adding.  If they add me first they appear for a moment then disappear in the list.  It‚Äôs a known bug.  
---
I did find I can jump to the last tab (recent) and find them there and finish the add, so not a big problem.  
---
It sounds like depressions added you and you are getting the ‚Äòdisappearing add‚Äô on every load.
---
You haven't seen the video about how this game performs anticheat checks, have you? The anticheat is a joke, it simply checks the name of open windows on your pc so you can just rename "cheat engine.exe" to "Spotify.exe" and you beat 99% of the anticheat systems.
---
Even here on reddit, tons of people brag about infinite AP and infinite ammo hacks that have been working since launch.
---
Yeah, because Bethesda established a perfect track record in fixing up exploits. You're just pulling arguments out of your ass now, in this pathetic shilling attempt.
---
Saw those supermutants.  Even funnier when there are 3-4 of them
---
My explanation is that they are FO1st subscribers learning a new dance
---
"have them do it" is exactly why this game is in such sorry state even one year in.
---
Yup. I have all variants except medics. Fav is vampire's w/explosive - health will be pegged out as long as you have ammo.
---
Not yet at least, probably being saved for the atom store or a quest reward after Wastelanders that could take you out of Appalachia. The best alternative for now is the Chameleon mutation or legendary armour until then if it becomes available.
---
strange? yeah you learn the colors by simply scrapping any old piece of combat armor, a leg an arm, whatever, as soon as you learn the " Shadowed for chest or limbs, not sure which its batched in with, you should have learned it for the helmet too.
---
Then apply for a place in Bethesda Austin. Pretty sure they will have something for you to do
---
I will def have to try that out today now that im back on. i know like 2-3 guarenteed spawn spots for that outfit
---
Are you 14 or something?
---
I'd need to hear it, but I'm sure it'd trigger memories if it used to be there
---
Not true I got all kinds of handmades from the purveyor or from legendary drops. I got three on my shop right now
---
What do you expect them to do then? Let people use cheat engines and let them fuck around with the game all they want in the name of 'reporting' something? Dang son, Imma start my career as bug reporter myself then. I can do whatever I want in this game and get away with it. I mean what are you suggesting Bethesda do then? Wanna hear your thoughts
---
We‚Äôve traded gear and met up in game before.  I know you have great gear and great gaming skills. In a way, is it possible that your competency has created a false floor for your perspective?  What you consider easy may be very difficult for the average player.  The fact that you know how to utilize perks and gear to create a much more powerful whole may not be natural for most.  I see players get crushed constantly while trying to play bloody.
---
Definitely agree.  I've been using the hungry emote as the "I need heals" emote with relative success luckily lmao
---
Why is a 9 year old playing a rated mature game? You're a great parent. lol
---
Ok cool, the asset already exists since its in Fallout 4, and the suit is prewar tech so I'd be cool if it makes an appearance. I just hope its more modular than the Fo4 version
---
I'm with this guy on this one, literally daily having to craft like 1200 ammo to keep the gun purring.
---
Not that I can complain or anything, Bloodied with 10% Aim is quite nice as a sniper variant of the handmade.
---
Well you still loose some damage because of the range. But I think the long max range applies to the crossbow too, since both shot projectiles that are persistent.
---
Nah for bethesda it's backpetal. As in they apologise but also run over an old ladies garden at the same time.
---
Jesus wept. It's like talking to a piece of cardboard. 
---
I'm out.
---
Probably for immersion purposes and so they don't have to hear people calling them losers for finding enjoyment in life.
---
Kind of like how everyone was asking for team deathmatch when Nuclear Winter first came out?
---
Dang bro. You sound like a cardboard as well. A wet and crumbled cardboard.
---
I think my favourite is when there's a dude sitting still, I aim for his head.  Line it up.  He doesn't move and it misses.  Then...  I shoot again.  same spot, it hits. 
---
I'm no good at analog stick aiming, it's garbage and they need to put gyro controls in to make aiming better...  but this game has some serious lag issues in hit shot detection where clear hits do not register at all.
---
Snappy comeback. Did you come up with it all by yourself?
---
He specifically mentions a bloodied ffr vats cost handmade. He's talking about one of the best guns with some of the best perks. Not a mutants bash damage handmade. You are most definitely not constantly getting mostly god rolled handmades from the purveyor. There's roughly 82,000 different weapon combos you can get, of which probably 8300 people won't even shake a stick at, and or the left over usable ones about 25 different combos that 95% of players hand.
---
Because this guys post is about how handmades are too powerful and needs t be given more drawbacks, aka nerfs. Who needs to keep up now, idiot?
---
hold up you can hack this game with cheat engine???????????
---
Actually, yes
---
I'm about to start a r/f076 bingo. Armchair psychologist - check.
---
Ha, pity you don't have a video of that; I'd gladly watch that.
---
Anyway, PC NW hacker infestation is becoming a meme. I honestly can't recall any other MP game/mode with such terrible issues and devs' unwillingness to solve it.
---
Theres 3 types of people. Those that are good at math and those that arent.
---
\^Exactly the point I'm making. Here it is, Bethesda, right from another customer.
---
Next time tell him, that you can maximize your DPS with VATS due to critical hits.
---
They added fallout 1st during the dayb1 beta anniversary.
---
So more money stuff and I'm sure the creation club will have discounts as well for those who left to fallout 4.
---
Excavator and T-60.
---
&gt;and apparently my deep voice is something he hasn't experienced yet, having not matured "physically"
---
Talking about obvious fruitcakes. Your whole post is an ego trip.
---
Not excusing the cheater or anything, but you sound like you've been touching yourself vigorously during that encounter.
---
Like 2 Weeks after playing 76, i had come to the conclusion that a coop fallout4 would have worked quite well.
---
Sounds like he succeeded in making you angry.
---
I think you're getting your terms confused.
---
I have an AAE Gatling Laser that's been in my stash since a month or 2 after Beta.  It dropped for me naturally from the world.  It was never "duped".
---
 It's been sitting in my stash Box ever since because I don't use heavy guns. It is most definitely a legacy and most definitely not duped.
---
As someone on ps4 I never really thought about a need for an additional social system in game.  Typically the host service has been more useful since it works outside the game.
---
That said, it seems like a clan/guild instance ought to be viable.  Could be done with a dedicated fo1st instance host that doesn't spin down.
---
Releasing a video could get me banned. Trust me, I REALLY want to. At this point, I have two theories as to WHY Bethesda hasn't cracked down on this after months of requests, reports, videos, etc...:
---
1. They are very under-staffed because they are working on too many projects at once.
---
2. The hack that is so prevalent now might be very hard to stop because of the nature of the game and how it works.
---
I hope it hasn't just been negligence...
---
Since he's looking for a list, I assumed he was asking for widely duped legacy weapons. There's no way someone can come up with a full list of all possible legacy combinations
---
Yes my pro crashes twice as much as my regular ps4
---
As I was leveling up I tried to make it my goal to get to all the lookouts as soon as possible, even if it wasn't wise given my level (there is one with a pair of ghouls that can hurt you, but all but one of the rest are somewhat safe if you can get to them in the first place).  It was sort of a private quest I made for myself.  Too bad I blew it, I thought I had hit them all but missed the eastern one in the divide until much later, I had discovered all the locations it would have shown me by then.
---
And then I see a level 15 in Watoga and just shake my head at how timid I was, though it was actually fun to be careful and sneak around more.  Eventually even an average player like me can start to walk around like the BMOC unless it's a gaggle of glowing ones at nuked WS, I hate those jerks.  I'll tell myself those low levels are just mules online temporarily to feel better.
---
Include a keypad on the interface and it could be navigated via the sticks as well for more precise numbers input on Console side
---
I‚Äôve been on a few teams and witnessed the shooting in the air and taking people out on the other side of the map. The team won and I felt scummy. I blocked the cheaters in each instance and I now only play solo (the not fill a team option). Makes me kind of sad because I‚Äôve met some cool people, but I love the game and I want to keep playing.
---
&gt;you are not an armchair psychologist
---
[That's exactly what he is mate.](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=armchair%20psychologist)
---
yut, been broken for months
---
Build around junkies ffr 50 cal and you're golden.
---
Ironic, considering that you keep claiming that you were actively trying to make him angry. And now you complain about him being angry? Mute the guy, that problem is solved.
---
Hackers everywhere must be really annoying, but you should direct that anger towards Bethesda who is refusing to implement anti-cheats.
---
Am I the only one who clicked on this hoping for tips on how to find housecats in the game, other than the vet and Mergle?
---
I wish I had taken a photo of you, sweet black cat just chillin' in the bushes, that I saw in my very first walk from V76.  I've looked for you many times but alas, you've must have continued on in your journeys.
---
Furious +10 Primed, great against SBs and gets me over the damage-loot threshold with the SBQ in 10 seconds.
---
\---
---
AAFFR Primed - not much use lately, fast but 35% less damage than F10.
---
Assassin's Explosive Primed - more like a show-off weapon when I kill wanted players; the explosions tells you it wasn't a random mob...
---
Vampire's FFR standard - it does heal alright but server lag can delay the effect long enough that you die nevertheless.
---
(all 2\* btw).
---
In the Thunder Mountain substation, just north of Watoga, in a small shed, you‚Äôll find a teddy bear drummer wearing a colander on his head. My favorite!
---
I can‚Äôt argue with this comment even a little.
---
&gt;Could be true, but I have a feeling that the chunk of market share they would lose letting PC go would be enough to try and stop it. 
---
You would think but there's a lot of questionable decisions that's been made my management that you would think no rational person would make.
---
Also, I wasn't kidding about PC players being third class citizens. Text chat's been requested since beta and it barely gets any lip service. Ultra-wide monitor support is a joke and the PC mod for that does a considerably better job than the official one. Key rebinds? Nope, only in a limited fashion. 
---
Bethesda was even initially really resistant to unlock fps from physics and the 60 fps limit, add in a POV sliders and DoF &amp; blur toggle. The community pushed back hard enough to have this changes happen.
---
I can't speak to what they really think of the PC market but their behaviour seems to imply that they're not all that concerned about PC players.
---
i have to admit, i buy a new laptop every 2, max 3 years. The older get downgraded to office, travel or beiing formated and giftet to nephews.
---
Ok, never thought that way...
---
I'm also 33, but I hold my own against the teens on Overwatch no problem... I've been playing competitive FPS games since I'm like 10 though.
---
I think that if you have the knowledge and ability, you should be allowed to run a very powerful character.  If bloody was cut by 50%, a rifleman sniper would be pretty lackluster and a gauntlet build wouldn‚Äôt be very fun either.  Having to shoot every plain super mutant in the face multiple times with a sniper rifle doesn‚Äôt seem fun or interesting. Risking death if a couple strong hits get through my defenses is also exciting and creates tension.  I like the high stakes that bloody provides.
---
I guess if you utilize a b/e gatling plasma with emergency protocoled strangler power armor, that probably gets really dull. 
---
How to separate the enjoyment of a bloody sniper from the cheese factor of a bloody heavy gunner is a difficult problem.  You can steamroll anything with a bloody prime LMG, but riflemen would become squishy peashooters if bloody damage was reduced or unyielding armor was nerfed.
---
Ah, another dude with a "Raiders" badge being an idiot. Makes sense. No need to dig into THAT any further. Being 10 years younger than me is also no excuse for acting like a twat for fun. I didn't do that at 25. This is what happens when you don't spank your children. You get people who can't understand basic logic and morality. You get dumbasses that defend the offender (A cheater that says he is doing what he's doing to be as much of a dick as possible) and then condemn the person who does something about it. Please, by all means, continue that train of logic and allow me to come smash your car with a baseball bat because I think it's funny, or sit outside your window at 4am blowing an air-horn. Don't confront me or call the police. Just smile while I do what I want. 
---
Moron.
---
Sweet!
---
Well, I've said my piece. Now I talk with my wallet, come what may.
---
My son is 7 and he is a bonafide marksmen in any game we play, I thought I was good but in a few years he will destroy me without having to try that hard.
---
Takes me back to dominating family members in Mario Kart when I myself was 7!
---
I love this. I cant wait to play video games with my son.!
---
You know your point is a strong one when Urban Dictionary has your back...
---
Your whole post is a red flag for imbalance to be honest. 30+ year old man whining on the internet about a video game in minute detail... yikes.
---
I complained, didn't I? And sure I was trying to fuck with him. Usually, assholes can dish it out but can't take it. Just like bounty-baiters in Adventure mode. You show up with a better weapon, kill the dick, and he usually logs off in anger. Hopefully I pissed this guy off enough he quit for a while and gave the other 300 people he would have otherwise interacted with a break. I swear, some people would complain if I punched Hitler in the face and kicked Satan in the balls.
---
It‚Äôs a lot of fun. I don‚Äôt let him play the actual Fallout games because of some of the mature content, but Nuclear Winter is just a bloodier Fortnite. We play that together sometimes, but he gets frustrated having to carry me all the time. Haha
---
Your power is out. Look at wires/pylons/generators
---
Personally I got fo1st BECAUSE I'm a casual.  Places haven't been looted, spawns are likely level appropriate, and I can chill doing workshops  (free camp tinkering &amp; pve events).  Friends can join in as well.
---
Keep in mind, casual &lt;&gt; no money.  Probably the inverse for full time working folks. In my case it's paying more for the option of private coop if I want.
---
How old are you? What are YOU doing here commenting? Go call the Kettel black, Pot.
---
A polished turd is still a turd. I would prefer not having a turd in the first place.
---
I don't think most people buy nor discard that much money's worth of hardware that often, thus the surprise, but well, it's your money
---
But I can see why you never have to worry about maintenance on a laptop, if you never use it for over 2 years lol. Most laptops should last that long without needing any.
---
You are crazy. Confirmed.
---
He already has to carry me on Fortnite. Besides he doesn‚Äôt need the xp for the rewards. I do! Haha
---
Store your vending machine and reset it
---
If a gun of the same class, shares the same ammo, why would the damage be any different? 
---
Another thing, the assault rifle is a factory made weapon where as the handmade is made from scrap springs, parts from other guns, and even a shovel as a handle!
---
Damage isn't the only thing that can seperate weapons from one another, these weapons should have the same damage as the use the same ammo. but the handmade can modified more and the assault rifle should have much better durability. For example.
---
I need to quit relying on VATS as much in regular F076 play. Maybe that‚Äôll sharpen up my aiming in NW.
---
Isn‚Äôt 90% of the fun figuring out your own build?  If you just copy the quiz off the smart guy, you don‚Äôt really learn anything.
---
^L^^O^^^L
---
If crazy is not letting people walk all over me, sign me up for the loony bin!
---
Thanks for your suggestion! I'll pass it right to the devs :)
---
I disagree. I've seen a lot more legendary handmade for sale than assault rifles. Doesn't matter if it's easy to obtain, how often do you use vanilla weapons?
---
1. Have you put anything in there for sale? Empty vendors don't show up on the map.
---
2. You have already moved camp. Scrap all stored vendors, build a new one, build a generator next to it, connect, put in something for sale. Still not working? Contact support!
---
It was fun while it lasted and we always had enough for at least one squad
---
I‚Äôm definitely not winning any parent of the year awards, but hey I get xp and he gets candy. It‚Äôs a win-win hahaha
---
That‚Äôs the problem. I can‚Äôt for the life of me figure it out :/
---
I‚Äôd prefer the smart guy option :)
---
Now I legit know you're very narrow minded. You're so stuck on the thought that a legacy weapon are only energy weapons that you convinced yourself that the flamer is a energy weapon ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Okay here's a lesson for you: A tse flamer is a legacy weapon because it shoots out fuel not bullets. The legendary tse effect "explosive" comes from the bullets exploding and should only be on ballistic weopns, thus energy weapons not using bullets shouldn't of been TSE (Ie: cryolator, laser, plasma) Which is why Bethesda took them from the game. You would of known this if you had played scince beta. The flamer is classified as a "heavy weapon" and benefits from the "heavy gunner" perk, thus not being a energy weapon. So you are wrong. I would stop making assumptions like you know so much about this game and making snarky comments like "did I get dropped on my head" cus I'm not the one saying a "flamer is an energy weapon" ü§£ apparently this is that complicated
---
Yeah it says SUSPENSION not BAN.  Learn to READ ffs
---
That was like reading my own words Dovakhin!  Skyrim was my obsession as well. It was so hard to put down. I hated the online aspect as well of FO76 and refused to play. I watched my hubby play and thought, well... maybe not as bad as I thought. This is now my new obsession. I have made friends across the world and always am happy to make more. Yes, there are bugs and glitches but I still enjoy it. I never run out of things to do!  Wander on fellow Wastelander!
---
I agree. I've spent over 1700 hours in it. 
---
Next closest game would only be at most 200 hours
---
It's incredible how people are ok with people using cheat engine for "finding exploits" and then get mad when they get banned. It's even more incredible how the only one guy I have seen that actually has common sense, gets downvoted too. 
---
Can't blame Bethesda for not listening to reddit community.
---
Guys do a google search for "Brand Ambassadors".  
---
People like this game, i did too to some extend but Bethesda just went too far with the monetization.
---
Just look up any bloody builds, they‚Äôre all generally the same with some minor tweaks.
---
Yes that is correct the dupers emails only said temporary suspension, the dataminers emails said "indefinite suspension". If you don't know the difference between the two you need more than some reading lessons.
---
It is obvious you're too slow to understand so I'll let you get the last word in so you can think you "won" this argument in your warped reality.
---
Take 5 of the same drug and you‚Äôll know.
---
Try taking 5 -7 in a row of the same chem in quick succession. Not really practical for in game use but if you want an addiction

The assault rifle is 1000% easier to find, therefore you will have all mods unlocked way way way before handmade. It's a much more easily obtainable gun, it does less damage therefore it's worth less as well.

There once was a post by LoneDovah,

With one massive paragraph to read over.
---
Legibility was hard,
---
Hence his point was quite marred.
---
So skipped it to finished my pavlova.
---
wow im done being nice. the flamer absolutely is an energy weapon. what the hell damage type do you think it is? ballistic? heavy weapon is not a DAMAGE type. it is a heavy weapon that deals energy damage. it uses energy ammo. you are a moron.
---

---
you are completely wrong about everything you just said. pull your head out of your ass.
---
I actually read your whole post, and thought you made a couple valid points. You‚Äôre not helping your cause by engaging in lowbrow insult wars with everyone who disagrees with you.
---
Reddit actually actively fights the behavior you're referring to. They even updated the software that identifies the software recently. No, they don't make a list of every account they've investigated and banned, but they did make a post a couple weeks ago reassuring everyone that Reddit is still a different class of forum.
---
You kept calling them BANS. Scroll up and read what you've been saying
---
So you think you see them less because they drop less? You see them less because dupers don't bother flooding the market with guns that aren't top tier. There's an equal chance of you getting a bloodied faster fire rate handmade as any other 3\* gun you've gotten. The problem is that thousands of copies of the good ones are made.
---
Have seen this question asked a lot maybe search as i havent clicked in them,
---
Can i ask a question though. Bethesda implemented an issue i.e scrap storage far too small then offered you a way to pay extra to solve it..is this a good idea?
---
Nice, I haven't found squat for legendary items at vendors since the scrappers were added.
---
Look Snapples it seems as though the only real knowledge you have on the topic is "explosive energy weapons are legacy weapons" üòë and you probably got it from a Reddit comment that you severely misread yes, einstein we know this. üôÑ Let's just go ahead and say you don't know shit about TSE or their droll rates. And you barley know shit about legacy weapons, saying a flamer is an energy weapon... ü§£ yeah I'm done with you. üôã‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è life isn't all about talking a bunch of smack like you know it all
---
I was getting that until I could no longer even log in. I finally had to delete and then reinstall. It has helped greatly!  (Knock on wood)
---
Gave you a downvote and wanted to explain why so it won't be a case of "Oh, look at all the bots down voting this comment." You are entitled to your opinion...but so are other people.  Nearly a year later and I am sick and tired of every time someone expresses something positive about a game some else comes along and says "paid schill!" and now "brand ambassador!"  Maybe some of these posts are.  In fact, some of them *probably* are.  But every single person who has something good to say about FO76 is not on the BGS payroll and it is absolutely ridiculous to think other wise.
---
Paid Shill Witch-hunting was old 6 months ago and its even older today.
---
Nah I I agree with you, the handmades were duped.
---
Thats not a bug, thats a feature. Get used to it.
---
you are such a moron it hurts. you are wrong. read the wiki. look it up anywhere you want. several other people already commented with the same thing I said. give it up. you lost.
---
I must be very lucky. I have recently spent an entire day earning XP in NW to get that sweet skeleton costume and only encountered two hackers in a single match. They were teleporting around but that didn't help them from being obliterated. Or perhaps the situation is less severe on European servers?
---
I think you have a point and Bethesda should try and balance it out by having toons be staggered, blurry vision, poorer aiming and vats not always work (not all at once).  That would separate skilled from unskilled players IMO.
---
Dude I'm in the same damn boat with my kids too. Now that they play I finally get cool shit from NW!  Like day late Halloween costumes! Lol!
---
What is wrong with you? Thas about the same ignorance those people at Bethesda have who banned this creator....
---
Yes
---
of she aint scared of the ghouls, its all good
---
Haha I‚Äôve almost decided I don‚Äôt even LIKE that glowing skeleton skin now, but we are too far in to stop now. I‚Äôm at 9000 xp as of last night. Gonna have to have him get me a few more wins tonight.
---
Imbecile! You thought common sense worked on this subreddit? You have a very good point and I agree with you but have a downvote cause that's not how we roll. You must hate Bethesda to survive here

---
The problem wasn't being banned, it was how long it took Bethesda to respond to the ban, they thought would be whitelisted as Bethesda was very of what was going on since they were working together.
---
Im sorry that this is so hard for you to grasp.. Didn't think it'd be that hard, but seeing as a lot a lot of other redditors share your opinion I guess it is.
---
I too still love Fallout 76. Sure it's not perfect, but it's BGS, so I never expected it to be. The microtransations don't bother me, I just don't spend the $$ on them.
---
Which mess? Cheaters or general social dysfunction?  
---
I think I‚Äôve met more obviously unstable people on 76 public pc worlds than all other online games I‚Äôve played combined.  This one guy talked nonstop for an hour about the limitless free energy he invented and his US military server stack he uses as a home pc.  It was too weird and crazy not to listen to.  I think he really expected his audience to believe he cracked the code on cold fusion or something.

As someone else said, I don't think they were planning on any respec ability to begin with, I mean go back to the previous Fallout and TES games and when did we ever have a respec before (don't play ESO so not sure if that has any). 
---
I was actually surprised we had the card system at all, that was in a way to respec your character with some limitations
---
Then after player feedback they added the move one SPECIAL point
---
we have the upcoming legendary player option - which I think is going to be the best you can get (unless they do a charge for feature)
---
My PS2  works fine
---
I would say the game is ‚Äúsafe‚Äù for anyone over the age of 6 because most of the Community knows when to be PG and I can only think of a few quest/holotapes that have cussing in them. Hope this help. Good luck in Appalachia survivor.
---
$100 and I‚Äôll throw in a sweet bridge crossing the Hudson.
---
You use a cheat engine, that's a ban for life. How Beth actually responded and unbanned some of them is the part where I'm having difficulty understanding. Someone's been offered a privilege, that's how I see it
---
Thats all very pretty until you start missing out on content.
---
Good for you, keep enjoying the game. Don't listen to all the negative assholes, reddit is full of them.
---
Haha :P

I‚Äôm as legit as they come. My gamer tag on Xbox is Lone Dovah. I assure you I check out. I just had an hour to sit and eat breakfast while my car was being worked on this morning and desired to express a thought while I felt some decent mental energy to do so
---
I love the game, 700 hours in. With that said I respect your approach in saying you dont.
---
Except Bethesda actually did listen (for once).  The guy in question has been unbanned.  As he should be.

I respect your opinion, that being said.
---
Bethesda could of done better.  There was going to be a DLC that introduced talking NPCs but that has been pushed back for next year.  Since I haven't played since... June, was it? I don't know how endgame looks now.  Heard the vault and the event where you have to split in teams of three were lackluster.  SBQ is still the best but rewards aren't always what you want.  Everytime I get a decent build going it gets nerfed to the ground.  Had a pretty nice Heavy Gunner build for SBQ and melee for small stuff and now rifles became far superior.  I don't know if I want to grind another 20 levels to get the perk cards and stats swapped around to make it work... rather not roll a new character for that but I'm considering it since it'll feel like a new game.
---
Fallout 4 was good.  Wish they would of made more DLC for it, but here we are.
---
have 2k + hours in this game, still not 100% sure it's the best, will give another 2k + hours before i decide ü§£üòÇüëå
---
It's rated M. There are swear words in the dialogue and yes drugs and violence are a part of the game. 
---
However I think the biggest risk is the multiplayer factor. If you ever played GTA online, there's a ton of kids swearing, yelling and having meltdowns which I wouldn't want anyone under 16 to be exposed to. I'm happy fo isn't like this for the most part. Personal opinion, 15 would be the youngest I would be comfortable with.
---
I have to ask, where did all the top shelf gear come from if you can‚Äôt/don‚Äôt want to put together a solid build?
---
The flamer is a heavy weapon. Let me repeat it. The flamer is a heavy weapon. Heavy weapon is a damage type and you equip heavy weapons perk cars to help increase your heavy weapon damage.  üôÑ there are no energy weapon perk cards. The flamer is only affected by the grounded mutation The flamers damage gets increased with heavy weapon perks. The fuel is considered energy ammo yes, but the gun is classified as a automatic heavy weapon. Just cus it uses energy ammo does not mean it's only a energy weapon.

I'm with you, I absolutely love the game. Sure I wish they would change or fix some things. Many things in fact lol, but I still have fun playing fallout with my family and friends. I enjoy trading for rare items or taking down sbq with a low level looking on in amazement. Its slowly getting better a little at a time. I hope wastelanders delivers half of what it has promised. If so, then the future of the game will be bright. Really if they would just add more endgame content I'd be satisfied.

If they are aware then one minute is too long for it still not to work.. Or is it just a case of Bethesda loves selling things that...      JUST work.  Just being taken as only just...  Or just about... Or maybe just about too work.    But that means just working on it. Lol üòÅ

Thank you. I suspected as much, but was optimistic that this problem would have been addressed by now.
---
You also shouldn't use something called "cheat engine" to modify the files, shouldn't exploit a bug to duplicate any quantity of any item, shouldn't cheat on your spouse; a test at school; or in cooking by turning up the temperature to "cook it faster"
---
The people in the wrong here are the ones who abuse the bugs or actually download CHEAT ENGINE to CHEAT.
---
Nahhhhhhhhhhhhhh, you can enjoy something but doesn't make it great. There's to many issues surrounding every aspect of 76 for it to deserve the title of greatest game they've made.
---
Doesn‚Äôt luck influence the condition of loot? No idea if they bought legendary items also count in that.
---
Me?  Hell no, I love this game.  It is the only one I play and the only one I have played since it launched.  It's been a while since I looked, but I've probably got between 1500-1600 hours invested at this point.  The point of my comment is that I am tired of other people claiming that people like myself and OP are paid schills any time something is posted that shows the game in a good light.
---
 There are energy weapon cards and they do work on the flamer. https://fallout76.wiki.fextralife.com/Science+Expert

the flamer is BOTH a heavy weapon AND an energy weapon. pull your head all the way out of your ass okay?

maybe you could have pressed the elusive enter button once or twice during that wall of text, cba to read that honestly

I see it like this:

New Vegas represent one kind of extreme.

Skyrim represents the opposite.

Fallout 4 tried to balance both and pleased neither.
---
The Outer Worlds doubled down on New Vegas.

Fallout 76 doubled down on Skyrim.

Fps is awful on any system. The game has incredibly poor optimization and the reason the forest region is more tolerable is because it was worked on the most. Even if you have a high-end gaming PC and you can get stable fps, you will still get high ping and stuttering every 5 seconds.

---
People breaking into other peoples home are at fault, but if the homeowner leaves his door unlocked, wide open, with a notice that he isnt home but has all his valuables lying on the table in the living room, nobody will be surprised if those get stolen.

Exactly man. They shouldn't have unbanned them. This is gonna set a bad precedent and end up giving cheaters more options

Younger people have better twitch reflexes, which are better for multiplayer shooter games

IIRC you can literally age out of competitive multiplayer games after some point, it's wild

About a month ago, they banned all the people finding, testing and reporting exploits. Here we are a month later and now the exploits are running out of control and Bethesda doesn't seem to be able to find and fix them anymore. This is not a coincidence.

You can check the time played from the achievement "Explore Appalachia for 7600 hours". It will show played hours slash 7600. I would like the ability to launch nukes but I don't like to rush things

I asked for a list of legacy weapons. Then I asked for the chance of a tse drop. Then I asked if a tse the dragon is a legacy weapon. 
---
I'm sorry but have you gotten a tse the dragon drop on you or anyone you know as of the last few months? Because I'm pretty damn sure that they took the prefix TSE out of the game making it legacy OR making the drop rate so extremely low it's 0.0000001% rare. You literally have no idea what you are talking about. Saying the flamer is a legacy weapon cus it's a energy weapon when it's a auto heavy weapon that uses energy weapon ammo. It seems like you don't even know why legacy weapons are my friend

I put amo in a vending machine once and it put me over, like 803 one time. And one time it was 800 and I took 4 magazines out and I couldn't put them back in. Then someone bought 1 single plan and it went to 794 or something üòí
---
Fair I guess I just meant wouldn‚Äôt it be pretty tough to be ignoring 50% of all damage in PA.
---
This is very common in any area where tons of people land. You just have to except that when you spawn take a look at your surroundings and know when to fight or flee.  But happens to me all the time, I‚Äôve even spawn really late into the game.

Awesome, thank you for the heads up. I was wondering on how you would check it
---
Completely Agreed. And because people enjoy what they enjoy based off individual tastes there really is no true authority on which one is better
---
It was a bug... and has been patched since you posted this
---
It‚Äôs all good. It‚Äôs compressed thought. Now if I was attempting an English exam I would have written it out a little differently
---
Some scorched beasts are legendarys now.
---
No way, the game's impossible to see with a bright room as it is. Plus you'll damage your Retinas

But then i‚Äôd Have to up the brightness again at day time. This doesn‚Äôt seem ideal

And the person who illegally entered another persons unlocked home could very easily be caught on camera and arrested by the police and spend time in jail.
---
The fallout76 door is not wide open. To play the game I press the launcher button twice, then play, then choose my character and log in. I didn't first go to "cheating website dot jellobrain" and then whatever process to set it up, and didn't sit there scrolling through the files accessible through cheatprogram.
---
They certainly did not leave everything open and a note saying please cheat. But mentally unstable cheaters use a third party program to cheat, like entering a house without permission and with a tool like a crowbar.
---
you are wrong. just because one person made it to level 140 without finding a good TSE weapon doesn't mean they don't exist, hes just unlucky.
---
 "heavy weapon" is not a damage type, you completely misunderstand what these words mean. there are legacy heavy weapons, there are legacy rifles, there are legacy pistols, there are legacy automatics. ALL of them are energy weapons.
---
 a TSE minigun is a heavy weapon but not legacy, a TSE flamer is a heavy weapon that is a legacy because it is ALSO an energy weapon BECAUSE it deals energy damage. the DAMAGE type is what determines if it is an "energy weapon". how are you so thick headed that you cant understand?
---
In my view it‚Äôs probably one of their best games. Top two best. But that‚Äôs just me being honest with myself. Totally subjective internal view. Just thought I would share it

Yes because fallout is known for its stories and not its world lore. Fallout 1 had little story. 3s story made little sense. How is listening to a holotape different to hearing a quest in other games with no input, 76 wasnt supposed to be about dialogue options.
---
I've moved over to Xbox for my NW play to avoid much of the joys of the PC hackers. Happily, I can afford to run with multiple accounts. Many cannot. Bethesda really needs to both take some effective action and be SEEN  by the community taking action.
---
If you close your eyes, it'll be pitch black. üòÅ

I completely agree!

Yes, normal Scorchbeasts.  Got mine at Mt Blair.
---
That‚Äôs an insult to the system
---
Yup, fallout series are the number one, including 76, only other games i love is the Tomb Raider and Resident Evil, but sadly those are to short :/
---
I don‚Äôt need the content? This is where I know I break off from normal people but I can literally run circles around that map all day long collecting loot and farming legendaries to sell or keep and that‚Äôs more than enough for me. I hardly ever quest
---
1600 hours of play. Love the game. Does it have issues? Yeah, but what game doesn't? Example: The Outer Worlds... cant complete because of a glitch at the end.  Funny thing is, you dont see hundreds of posts on their reddit with people foaming at the mouths in anger.  Everytime someone posts that they actually love this game it gets so much hate. But, probably 60% of players dont even look at reddit. I say, enjoy the game. If you dont, move on. Don't agree microtransactions,  dont pay for anything.  Really that simple.  Dont try to bring someone down just because they enjoy a game you don't.

They give you access to certain dig spots that can give you pretty rare stuff

Oh like what? I guess I‚Äôll use em
---
It's crowned enemies in general, as far as I can see - ghouls, scorched, super mutants being the most frequent types. They all seem to have a relatively high chance of dropping a treasure map.
---
its a mmo. its needs this feature even if its a shop option

But New Vegas improved on all aspects from Fallout 3 (besides it‚Äôs map), not just the story.

This isn't a nerf, this gun type literally has less cons than pros than any other weapon type in the game.

I haven't bought any death bag skin but I think you should deselect it from the Atom Shop, just like Nuclear Winter costumes.

You mean share the scrap box? No, each character has their own.
---

I can‚Äôt find it in the Atom shop ... will try again
---
So I be unable to pass supplies onto my alt and vice versa?
---
If you are asking for the handmade to be less powerful, then that‚Äôs a nerf.
---
FPS drops are a feature of the game unfortunately
---
Oh no, you can .  If you dropped a piece of wood and changed characters and tried getting it with the second character,  you'll be able too
---
Don't think Beth have the most numerate staff on this :D
---
I‚Äôm the saddest huh? I just broke that record for you here and now with my comment? If so I kind of feel special. But I highly doubt it I think you just want that butter knife you‚Äôre using here and now to cut a little deeper on this one.
---
Thanks for your response I appreciate it I guess I will be getting a private server.
---
Alright... Neither of our lives have been affected by this
---
I need mine to go up by about double :D
---
i will have to try that.
---
Lever actions consume less ammo but can't keep up with the DPS that a handmade can dish out. Issue here is controlling a Handmade with specific attachments is fairly easy. It doesn't have enough recoil to circumvent the fact its range and damage makes Assault Rifles absolutely useless and the only gun type honestly close would be Combat Rifle followed by Lever Action at a distant 3rd.
---
But if you decide to come after an hour, you'll lose it.
---
I would play

Ye

I have heard, as of right now, console is pretty devoid of cheaters. I don't feel I should need to go buy an $800 or more console, pay for a subscription, and start over to play a single game mode. Hell, all Bethesda really has to do is make a self-policing booting system. Enough people in an hour report you, you get booted for a week. Give players 2 reports a day so it couldn't be abused. At best, a cheater could only get a couple games in on their account before they couldn't use it for days. Doesn't matter how many accounts you have at that point. You would hardly be able to use them. Beth wouldn't even have to develop anti-cheat measures. It would be that easy. Hackers would basically disappear over-night. But I'm just a voice on the internet, what do I know after nearly 30 years of gaming, 10 years experience modding Beth games, and a computer tech degree?
---
I'd attempt to make the pass off rather quickly.

I‚Äôve played the outer worlds. I‚Äôm to the point where your ship gets locked down and you have to go talk to the guy to get the lockdown lifted. Now I‚Äôve played it in maybe 1 hour increments at a time vs 76 where I play in 12 hour increments at a time. That‚Äôs the difference for me
---
I'm up for that
---
I heard they dragged him out behind the building and beat him up to.
---
It needs reworked, thats what it needs. Buffing the other weapon types requires making them have a use over the Handmade. In order to do that, Handmade's pro's need to be moved over to other weapons to make them an actual viable choice. 90% will go with Handmade cause that just makes sense.
---
Nobody cares

Pretty sure this has been covered, at great length, in any number of other threads.
---
The general problem of Bethesda never actually adjusting their UI and controls to the PC, as far as screen real-estate usage and input flexibility go, has only ever been solved through mods provided by the user community. Fallout 76 is no exception in this regard, sadly. A few UI improvement mods do, in fact, exist, but the inflexible input scheme seems to be unfixed and will likely remain so.

I don‚Äôt disagree I‚Äôm just giving my view of the game itself

Vending on PC is still booming as far as mine go. I‚Äôve sold at least 40 guns over the weekend. I actually had to go out and farm last night to get some more low-mid tier legendaries. Haven‚Äôt stocked the upper tier ones yet - not until I spend some caps.
---
They have so much stuff to fix. üò£
---
But the handmade isn‚Äôt the top choice any more.  The top choice is the Fixer.  It‚Äôs the other weapons I mentioned that are sub-par.
---
Dude I sell them for 30-50 a piece and they get eaten Up. Mainly from group posts
---
I was introduced to Fallout at the age of 11 and loved it so if you think they‚Äôre ready now then go for gold
---
You do you. But also, you need to play more games.
---
I don‚Äôt think people like you and me are all that rare actually. There is a reason this ‚Äúbad‚Äù game gets rocket levels of attention
---
I just did that myself two minutes ago and it worked flawlessly with legendary stuff. You should be fine as long as you do it relatively quick.
---
Yeah but thats the trade off of using a legacy weapon of that caliber. Handmades can keep going at it for leagies above laser/ explosive can.
---
Great. Thanks for all the info.
---
Plot twist: the kid was actually one of the NW hackers causing people to quit
---
I also enjoy the game. I do feel like the Fallout 1st benefits should be included in the base game. And I feel BGS should reward those of use that have stuck by this game since beta. I also fell like they over do the shop items a little too much. But you know atoms are pretty easy to get if you play the game right so you can get those items without paying a dime of real money. There are plenty of guides on how to get the most atoms each week. I do feel like BGS put more effor into adding shop items than fixing bugs. And that is frustrating.
---
Heres to hoping for good things with wastelanders.
---
When I spawn in Zax says I'm "already behind". I think he's helping people cheat. I honestly wish I could turn off Zax voice. Zax is a cunt.
---
If you know how to use cheat engine, you can also see the passwords of those who log in your server, because Bethesda didn't bother to encrypt them and just puts them in plain text form.
---
I do this constantly with my private server. I tested it a bit and the server doesn‚Äôt seem to persist longer than 5 minutes with nobody in it. Items left after that long disappeared. As long as it‚Äôs a case of logging out and back in rather quickly you‚Äôll be fine. Obviously don‚Äôt leave a bag, use a suitcase or something in the world.
---
Thanks for the explanation. I was searching for all the wrong terms.
---
So we always sign back into the same private server?
---
With respect, they weren‚Äôt the first to make discriminating remarks based upon age.  It‚Äôs all over your original post, with at least one very unpleasant and degrading example being used as a method of extracting information.  
---
I‚Äôm a bit older than you and I‚Äôd be lying if I said I never rolled my eyes listening to a person in their 20s, but I try to have the presence of mind to remember that I thought in a similar way back in ye olden tymes.
---
I do enjoy crafting sophisticated insults for crass, mentally stunted people, though.  In a way, it‚Äôs very similar to painting abstract compositions.  I‚Äôm no Robert Smigel or Clyfford Still, but the bar is set pretty low here.
---
Turns out you actually don't know shit because you played the post fix version, LOL.
---
The top choice before the fixer though for literally the entire life cycle since explosive meta changed was and has been Bloodied Handmade or a variation of the Handmade, followed by Combat Rifle. It's pros are too good and was outclassed by a gun with more additional perks making it more viable and useful. Only reason that people want fixers is cause of the extra bonuses that a Fixer would give that no other rifle gives in addition to the perks used on a Handmade.
---
Unlimited scrap should be accessible to all players. That is something that the devs figured out how to do therefore it is an evolution of the game and just like bug fixes are evolutions to the game nothing like that should be withheld. It is ridiculous to see people who payed for this game playing it under the old restrictions that were there because that‚Äôs how the developers kept the game stable at that time
---
More secure is if you have a trusted friend on server (My case, the wife) then because she is there (Granted under eviction timer), you will load in without issues, even after a few minutes
---
Good. Why would you want to buy things. This game isn't free to play or a charity
---
I‚Äôm using this on my main https://youtu.be/8U6nJrc8s58
---
Not sure what you're on about but ESO was not an mmo at launch, group quests didn't work, all dungeons/missions were instanced, combat was fucked due to delay bugs, mounts were unfeasible to attain without shelling out for the deluxe edition, end game didn't exist outside of cyrodiil lagfest pvp.
---
The map76 issue has been resolved, he was finally unbanned but it took 2 weeks &amp; a lot of phone calls/tickets
---
True, but they did nerf the handmade a few months back (added weight, drum magazine nerf). 
---
I still think the right solution is the buff the 3 underperforming guns, not nerf the Handmade (more) and the Fixer.
---
*COMMUNIST TARGET ACQUIRED.*
---
so true
---
Lot‚Äôs of farming stuff and trading stuff i deem valuable :)
---
Sweet! What legacy gp plasma though?
---
I didn‚Äôt think griefing was in the game because you had to ‚Äúaccept pvp‚Äù if this is no longer the case I may get back into it just to grief people.
---
Bring back survival rewards by bringing back survival mode! Pretty please?
---
So, uhhhh. Can I hire him? I got the xmas tree reese's. Lol
---
It's been like this for a month or so now.
---
Sometimes it takes minutes to get it to work and I just don't bother waving.
---
Say they did spend 200k a month keeping the servers running and they were trying to sell memberships to support the cost of the servers I can understand that. So they decide to sell annual subscriptions for 129 canadian dollars. To reach they're goal of 2.4m annually they need to sell about 19k subscriptions. Or alternatively the sell subscriptions at 20$ annually and aim to sell 120k subscriptions. And this is my point they're overcharging for a subscription to prop up an atom store that is mostly shit. If your any good at the game you've grinded it out and dont need to buy atoms because you've already earned them. They're bundling atoms with the subscription inflating the cost when the majourity of people who would consider buying the subscription most likely dont need the atoms they're packaging with it. They would sell far more subscriptions at a lower price pleasing the customer base while recouping theyre costs. And frankly I dont care if I have a private server or the atoms bundled in I just want the unlimited  junk storage. 129 annually is to high of a price to pay. This self entitled brat has a mortgage to pay and other developers who arnt trying to rob me to support.
---
Why not? Their origins aren't exactly known, and being that this is a place that is nukes constantly they could have started out here.
---
Too much Nukashine?
---
On a much serious note: Oof
---
I also wish I could give you multiple upvotes
---
Ok I disagree with your opinion of loot grab ‚ÄúSafes‚Äù are the same thing as Orange Boxes. 
---
I agree with your armor penetration for the shotgun. 
---
   InDefinitely disagree with the heavy gun loot options they shouldn‚Äôt add any of those heavy guns to any other box but a Orange Crate or terminal/Safe.
---
   As for the Pistol Section I agree with your armor penetration addition, I don‚Äôt believe they should remove the 44. Or Single Action they just need to Add armor penetration to make them more useful. 
---
   As for the adding of weapons I just feel like your asking for too much at once. If anything they need get rid of the those damn Pipe Weapons which NO one uses. Plus incredibly ineffective. Then they could add something in replacement but no one picks those weapons up with a smile on their face.
---
Your section on Melee is a good take on the damage resistants part. But the bear arms and tenderizer part doesn‚Äôt make sense to me I don‚Äôt understand what you are trying to say seeing that tenderizer already exists in the list of cards. Bear Arms is a weight reduction perk And that only applies to heavy guns?? so just use Walking arsenal which applies to every weapon. Martial Artist will reduce weight of Melee weapons. Also increases your swing speed. 
---
As for your section on Explosives I do agree with the addition of The Fatman being added since a skin was released for the weapon. Also the Fact that Fireproof is not in the mode where grenade launchers and Auto grenade launcher rule the whole game I don‚Äôt understand why they don‚Äôt have a counter.
---
IT'S NOT FAIR THEY HAVE MORE FAST-TWITCH MUSCLE FIBERS
---
It's more like arresting an armchair detective for going into crime scenes and messing shit up for the real detectives. Good intentions aren't a pass for breaking the rules. Dude was using a cheap engine, and he's not employed by Bethesda.
---
I‚Äôm sorry my friend, these bases will truly and always be missed, rip cave base
---
Took me until this month to finish them, but that's typical of me for Bethesda games. I get distracted by the side content. Usually it's the reverse for Fallout games, though.
---
same, that was the best.  I load it up from time to time.
---
Yep, the yongslant army is quite the lowlife trash.
---
if you wouldn't let them play 4, don't let them play 76. things only seem toned down because all human npcs in the game are currently dead.
---
No, dude was banned for using an exploit, recorded it, and sent it in as a report to Bethesda. He quite literally reported himself, not sure what he expected to happen. It sucks, but that's why he got banned
---
Seems like it runs fine on my Microsoft Zune
---
I‚Äôm on Xbox one, VeiledSpy
---
Yeah, he called me an angry old fart, so I called him a nutless child (I would guess his age in the early 20's. Not like I was picking on a kid. He can drink and vote like the rest of us and is expected to behave like an adult, at least under the legal system.). Eh, I feel like if he is going to attack me about my age, I'm well within my rights to throw it right back in his face, so I did. And you know damn well it isn't a bunch of middle-aged men and grandmothers that make the most trouble here. Yeah, I WANTED this guy mad. I wanted him to get a nice, strong taste of what he was doing to others for his personal, sick enjoyment, and make mistakes because he was flustered. A little shoe-on-the-other-foot does wonders for developing some human decency and empathy for your fellow man. And sometimes you have to use small words small-minded knuckleheads can understand. Shakesperian-era insults don't work on someone who's barely above speaking in grunts. Sometimes just pointing and laughing and saying "you have a tiny dick!" works best on morons.
---
I had something similar happen at Dyer chemical. I was killed by non-legendary robots exploding after death (which was a new one for me). When I chose to respawn at that location, I spawned a good two locations north from where I was. Happened twice.
---
Yea spawning in at my camp it would constantly spawn me in the rocks, little annoying but it was easy enough to just run out of
---
Well unfortunately I'm on PS4.
---
Gt: Hanes Stain 
---
I‚Äôm a college student and a heavy build also lol I‚Äôd b down for it sometime man just hmu
---
Ok thanks, great content btw!
---
I've experienced this a few times only so far (thank $deity) and mostly on laggy servers, but yes, this is a thing that happens.
---
No, too much noise and a eternity to reload, look for a instigating lever action, hunting rifle then it will be great...
---
Yeah give me the option to ensure that no 1st member is buying my stuff!!! What a great idea indeed
---
Awesome! I‚Äôll hit you up
---
üëçüèª sweet
---
Yea I was looking at getting one of those, maybe one day there will be cross play or what ever it‚Äôs called
---
Aae or junkies
---
Well alot of people are probably gonna skip reading it, because of the lack of formatting, as I did
---
Ikr.
---
Imagine i found a way to rob a bank and i robbed the bank to show them i found out how then they arrested me.
---
Of course i couldn't just tell then i found out how. 
---
And since banks have existed my main contribution to them has been combing over their plans to find flaws to exploit, not just report to them what i find.
---
 There are young children mature enough to play the game, and understand chat etiquette. They are ok, and I don't mind at all helping them out, or letting them in our PG party. Then there are the unmonitored, unwashed squeakers, who constantly yell into the mic "HEY, ANYONE ELSE GOT A MIC? YOU GOT A MIC? HELLO? HEELLOOOOO? IT'S THAT LITTLE THING BY YOUR FACE. A MIC? ANYONE GOT A MIC? I FOUND A NUKE CARD. I FOUND ANOTHER NUKE CARD. WANNA DROP A NUKE? I HAVE NUKE CARDS, LETS DROP A NUKE? A MIC? ANYONE GOT A MIC?".
---
Determine which type they are, and introduce/ban for life at your discretion.
---
This is awesome.
---
If no one read it at all I would be just as good. It is what it is
---
I have a handmade that I have stashed away if I ever decide to use it again cause I got better weapons so, I definitely wouldn't call it the "best" weapon in the game, cause it's not. It's a great weapon, but a big thing is that you have to have the right perks for it to make it really, really great.
---
On the combination of perks I agree with the combinations ,everything under the combination I don‚Äôt agree with except the Fireproof perk.  In the others section the only thing I agree with is the Increase of health &amp; AP &amp; AP Regen. With the exception of over lapping camp builds. Which is a fantastic idea. Everyone should be allowed to build period.
---
If you haven't figured it out by now, it stands for Nuclear Winter; the battle royale mode.
---
The Keystone Cops aren't real detectives.
---
They just did that again with the Map 76 creator
---
I guess I can try scrapping more at some point and cross my fingers.
---
I have around 50+ in my stash. I‚Äôll sell them to you (ps4)
---
Well aren't you just the definition of salty. Too broke to afford the $13? Maybe video games aren't the beat way to spend your spare time?
---
As for OP, if they are blocked, then they can't join your server, unless you have a friend who is friends with them, and they do it manually.
---
That'd be fun to see. I wonder how it'll play out though.
---
That is me ;)
---
Ohhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
---
Honestly probably not well at least with pc, it would be a lot of fun to have console wars tho
---
You could also try managing your stash, toss out some junk or whatever you got in there. It's what me and my teammates did, and still do even with the membership
---
Thank You :)
---
Forceful stock so it doesn‚Äôt break within 30 rounds.
---
I'd consider it OK but not particularly good, or even great, despite the huge damage for two reasons:
---
1) Explosive does not work well with Instigating, because the Explosive AoE will shave off HP from mobs standing close to the mob you're targetting, meaning that when you shoot *them* in turn, you won't benefit from the Instigating bonus.
---
2) The super long reload time.
---
But hey, if it works for you, hold on to it until you find something better.
---
Haha that's what I'm imagining. Well I guess that would make you and I enemies.
---
But they are cheating! And as you have stated as your logic it doesn't matter why, THEY ARE CHEATING BAN THEM!
---
See how stupid you sounded?
---
Yes, I hate this so much. I have to put stuff in vending machines, and all my robot models are gone now.
---
I appreciate your comment, thank you!!   
---
But then again how can we trust they all have equal drop chances? Yikes!! ü§î makes it even harder to get
---
Yeah I have that one. I also repair for double durability.
---
Happened to me as well, not common but it happened
---
I loved PvP in Burning Crusades. I cracked into the 2000s once (Resto Druid - go figure). They lost me at WotLK, though. I'll never forget them not ending the season before the pre-patch and ret pallies demolishing the bracket...
---
Eh you seam cool but yea probably
---
PvP does seem to be the realm of the young. At 54, I have no time for that shit in any game. I just want a relaxing time.
---
Then you may be able to run through West Tek without it breaking.
---
They never comment cause devs don‚Äôt care
---
Reads "if you care" immediately stops reading and goes back to counting piles of money.
---
Aw thanks for the compliment though lol.
---
It would be better if it had 250DR while reloading!  I had a level 5 with that, and it worked great for my alt lol
---
Lol I dont have that issue. Mine holds up fairly well it seems.
---

---
How do you get anything done? I could get very little done in an hour. ü§î
---
He‚Äôs allowed to ask for whatever he wants man the only salt is see around here is you buddy. ‚ÄúToo broke to afford 13 bucks‚Äù grow up kiddo.
---
Coming soon to the Atom Store, only 2000 Atoms!
---
Amen
---
Guess we need an ‚Äú&gt;30‚Äù filter for matchmaking üò©
---
I have a theory that if 76 as it is were made by an indie dev and not BGS it would be considered the greatest thing since sliced bread
---
I main and collect Laser Rifles for my Commando build. Beam Splitter is an absolute must, as its the only way to do decent damage, a 50 damage gun becomes 200. The only downside is your gun breaks 4x quicker. Thats where the Forceful Stock comes in to make your durability shine. 
---
The next bit depends on you. I try to run as much "True" options as I can. I dont use vats and use a short scope, so the True options give me favtastic hip fire accuracy.
---
I haven't said anything biased. A basic understanding of socioeconomics can help to identify why someone reacts the way they do. 
---
I'm sorry, did the big words confuse your poor little brain? They must have, because now you're angry too. I'm not emotionally invested at all, I'm just pointing out how silly it is to try and segregate subscribers from the player base. If you can't afford it or don't want to then don't. There's no reason to be so hostile and combative over it though.
---
Again  the salt isn't coming from me here. Take a looooong look in the mirror.if you can stand it that is.
---
To get back into my good graces they need to get back to ‚Äòsave player one‚Äô and focus on their fans enjoyment rather than engagement. Single player, offline (perhaps even optional online co-op with friends), solo game with good storyline, a good amount of meaningful content, no shitty virtual currency or store etc etc. Alas, I fear this will not be and I‚Äôm referring to more history than just FO76. Bethesda have forgotten ‚Äòwhy‚Äô they were a success - they had a USP in the games market, an unfair advantage, something different that nobody else could replicate but now they seem more than happy to just float along in the sewage with all the other turds.
---
Unfortunately can't help you out on Ps4 but I think it's ridiculous that it isn't BoP (bind on pickup). I put mine down just to check it out and didn't get in it. Only realised the next day.
---
"We would never add battle royal to fallout 76"
---
I recommend dropping all your holotapes and clearing out your apparel to only the outfits you wear frequently.
---
Still that won't fix the server stutter (when the game straight up freezes for 3-10 seconds)
---
They nerf everything but bloodied, because the devs probably use it too
---
I'd be willing to die by your side. Or at least die protecting you. You can have all my PlayStations, I'll make sure to put that on the will.
---
This is awesome! My husband &amp; I met online prior to online dating, way back in dial up ages. We‚Äôve been together all most 21 yrs now. Wishing the both of you, many beautiful memory making years! It would be awesome if Bethesda would send you something special, if they do please share! ü•Çüçæ
---
Sorry about your luck, but no. I play all the time and may get one crash a week, maybe two. 
---
Have you checked your internet stability? Tried reinstalling? It could be dumb luck but I have a very stable connection and upgraded to an SSD. This could be part of the reason why I have so few issues.
---
Haven't been to watoga since the robots stopped being able to spawn as legendary.
---
Mine bounced up to 850+, I think a hotpatch may have changed the weight of some mods since I've started selling all the mods I didn't use...
---
and that comes down to whether you're a sheep to Bethesda or not....
---
There's no flex with the 1st membership
---
Buddy no one said anything about being able to a for it my god. This has nothing to do with buying the subscription. All he wants. I will repeat. All he wants is to not sell his goods to people who he dose not support if your gonna keep stirring the pot so be it but in the real world buddy people are entitled to interact with whoever they please and if they chose to not support a cause so be it. Even if it hurts your little whale club.
---
&gt;	like getting the space suits
---
Whoa, say what now? Is there another unmarked quest like the alien blaster and quantum paint, but for space suits?
---
I don't play NW much what items are in NW that aren't in adventure? And what do you mean infinite ammo laser gun. That is a NW item?
---
You won't cancel though.
---
Don't really know what it is. But if it's anything like Outer worlds, I won't be playing it.
---
i mean more like the lore and backstory of it all. if i just wanted a game with space travel and "somewhat open" worlds right now, and didn't care about the plot, i'd play mass effect again or dive into outer worlds (which i plan to do eventually anyway). i want to know what they're doing to make Starfield's world unique.
---
I agree with you 100%. But I'm afraid MOST game Devs are going in the "always online coop, riddled with microtransactions" model. We can thank Destiny for that one.
---
So this means that the guy can now use cheat engine for whatever he wants, and if he uses it for cheating he will just say that it's for finding exploits and everyone is going to believe him?
---
I guess we'll have to wait and see...Outer Worlds is amazing btw. I'd recommend multiple playthroughs.
---
I just took another look and my lord how dense must you be to miss my point so many times in this discussion.
---
What seems to help with stability for me.. I always shut the game down all the way before I start the game. Still have problems some times but helps it not be so bad. On Xbox here. Highlight game, press menu go to quit and quit the game, shuts it off then open. Or could do a hard reset on console. Clears stuff up for me. Hope this helps..
---
He was banned by a bot, he's been unbanned now but it took 2 weeks. Don't listen to people like this guy who refuse to learn what they're talking about.
---
Wouldn't work as there is a specific chemical needed to be turned to a ghoul, and it isn't radiation.
---
I will play in your honor and fight to end the rain of terror that is the pc master race !!! Until I get a nice ass computer then I can have three accounts going at once I‚Äôll be the ultimate hidden spy
---
Not a fan? It's a great game
---
I'd like to know why you dont like it.
---
I would have kept  on insulting him.
---
I feel like that‚Äôs even worse cause you realized you had it then it disappeared.
---
ultracite is bad just so you know. focus on getting a set of T51b or even X01.
---
Happy Cake Day! 
---
I agree, I'm fucking sick of him
---
thanks :)
---
As disappointing as that can be I‚Äôd just get a set of t51 the level 50 has better stats
---
For up to 5 minutes and then the server refreshes
---
Months at 300-400 per game. I still usually get 1 level a night now, so 3-6k per level at 140+. I don't think there is an xp curve from 50+, so it's the same at 51, as it is at 101.
---
&gt;US military server stack.  
---
So a super generic cisco brand stack?
---
DR while reloading is bugged. It takes away the primary effect unless you reload while crouched. It's pretty bad.
---
Yeah I was a feral resto hybrid back when that was viable and feral gear had plus healing.  It was super fun.  Open with a pounce on the dps,  cyclone their healer,  entangling roots to disable,  throw some hots.   I felt like a true hybrid and it was great.
---
I haven't missed anything, your point is to encourage unnecessary anger towards people who are spending their money the way they want, and you refuse to accept that you're wrong. Talk about dense.
---
No, it‚Äôs just to get them you need to go to the space station, in the far south rubble will be a paper that gives you a code, go up the the door at the north crashed peace, type in the code on the paper and bam space suits in the lockers inside
---
Seriously, you're still butthurt over a BR mode? NW is a great addition.
---
I'm level 90 in NW and it takes time to learn what technique works for you. The key is a solid team, have a building blueprint made so you can have the high ground and the right perks for the build you prefer. I've been annihilated with a good team, I've run through 15+ to take the win solo and sometimes jumping from bush to bush and scooping up a win by stealth is the way to go. In NW it's more luck than skill.
---
Mine had something like stalkers or similar. I had it just for the 250dr. That plus full vangaurd, and my little level 5 was going up against level 68 super mutants.
---
Plans drop from sqb, i know i sell them for like a hundred caps to get rid of them quickly. 
---
Keep your eye out on player vendors and do sqb when you see and plans shouldnt take long to get.
---
Gl on getting callibrated shocks on that though, they have eluded me so far.
---
Straight brain dead are ya? No anger encouraged what so ever Il break it down again into simpler terms for ya okay kiddo. Here we go follow along. Me no sell to people me no agree with. Seems fair eh and completely within our rights and it doesn‚Äôt ‚Äúencourage unnecessary anger‚Äù. But if you haven‚Äôt got it yet you sure won‚Äôt get it now
---
I'm not excited for anything Bethesda announces in the near future. With all this nonsense, I will find it hard to not expect everything to be super monetized, with shitty paywalls. I'll still play what I have, but I don't plan on paying into anything Bethesda owned until they get their shit straight, and stop trying to be the next EA/Activision.
---
I don't disagree that people should not need to go drop big bucks on an alternate platform. Beth, do your job! I already had the Xbone sitting around and was already running both PC and Xbox accounts so, yeah, no additional sweat off my back, as it were. But my choice is definitely not a global solution.
---
Lmao
---
Yeah I did some research ( mostly looking through u/lordbaronstein excellent guide) and the plan right now is to use both those+excavator for fast travel: I got a nearly full suit of t51 (missing one of the legs still) for general wasteland exploring and a full suit of prototype x01 for Scorchbeast/nuke events. I really just wanted the Ultracite to see what it looked like better/have in my collection alongside my old t45 and raider sets in expectation of being able to display them at some point.
---
Oh wow, congrats and thank you!! They are, actually! I‚Äôll post it to my Instagram for sure!
---
Yeah that‚Äôs the plan and I‚Äôm well on the way, I have the full t51 minus one of the legs. I‚Äôve also got the full suit of x01 for nuke events.
---
How is that NOT unnecessary anger and bias? You really are a special kind of stupid. Stupid is as stupid does ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
Because I have the right to decide who I sell my goods to
---
Look, I make no apologies. That's what was pissing him off, so that's what I gave him. He was a cheater who openly admitted he enjoys making others miserable. He threw the insults in the ring. So I gave the cowardly, cheating, rotten, disrespectful little shit what he asked for and deserved. With both barrels. Hopefully, it was a good shock to his idiot system getting chewed out and roasted by granddad. And I think I did the right thing. Someone like that is NOT to be tolerated or given respect or courtesy. We'll just have to call this a difference of opinion on "parenting". People sitting there and meekly taking his abuse is probably part of what made him so bold in the first place. Unfortunately, we can't always stop bad behavior by trying to hold hands and sing happy songs and reason with the offender. That's why every nation has a police force and armed forces: for people who won't listen to sense and have to be stopped by force. That's why games have rules, like "no cheating". I am NOT going to be shamed for insulting my abuser. That's horse shit.
---
We are out there.
---
No idea. I assumed the whole tale as ravings of a loner starved for the approval of a peer group.  If the guy wasn‚Äôt behaving with wild overconfidence and thinly veiled condescension, I would have felt a lot of empathy for him.
---
I'm not sure really. There's something about the color or hue and saturation that I don't like. And there are areas that look like Mass Effect. I'm not sure I'm a big fan of space games, although Prey seemed okay. And there is too much talking to people and reading in my opinion.
---
Ah, yeah ok, I do know what you‚Äôre talking about. Thanks for refreshing my memory. 
---
The first time I got the responder bot my plague walker made them think they were getting attacked. So, whoops, ruined encounter. 
---
But I got rid of that and got him again. And held him, got a crew together so we could keep signing off and rejoining to refresh his inventory. I lost a lot of caps that day lol
---
Meh just a cash grab
---
Is he available for hire?
---
You know how countries don‚Äôt trade with others who break international law and that‚Äôs their right. I also have the same right to sell or not sell to whoever I deem fit
---
No, you don't. You have the right to log off, or switch servers, but you don't have the right to create a custom list that differentiates between first subscribers and non subscribers, and you never will. Get over yourself ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
That is very helpful, beats hoping someone on my friends list stays on the server
---
It was just a comment on gameplay. Not story, atmosphere, and perk trees. 
---
Also what about Rose? Or Grahm?
---
You'd have to be able to offer something to the community other than trolling, he not only made Map76 but helps solves some major issues like the security exploit already mentioned. What have/can you do?
---
Not currently no but that is what OP is asking but yes right now I do have the right to only do business with people I wish to
---
Yeah, me too... me being terrible at online games is a recurring theme in my life, which sucks because they‚Äôre my main hobby. I‚Äôve recently been diagnosed with dyspraxia, which is what I‚Äôm going to chalk it up to, but it doesn‚Äôt make it suck any less.
---
Yea they have some good stuff, I‚Äôll need to go hunting for him, just not up for a bunch of server hoping
---
The drop rate is not like anything else or you would see them, but you don't. It's like Bethesda replaced TSE with "two shot" "explosive" and "quad" 
---
That was a ghoul slayers explosive tho.... I'm talking about a legendary two shot explosive the dragon. Two shot explosive. Not just explosive.. I've heard that tse is non longer a roll with black powder weapons
---
Now if you can bend your snowflake back into shape and go on about your day I wish you a good one.
---
Most companies would look at it as a few thousand (or more) dollars worth of employee time saved recreating, documenting, and logging what caused a bug.
---
You mean how countries make a lot of noise and SAY they won't, but still trade with them behind closed doors? Is that what you meant? Terrible analogy really.
---
Other than the fact that you DON'T have the ability you're referring to, and you never will!
---
It is a great game, but i get more of a mass effect feel from it rather then fo/eso.  
---
When i play it my mind keeps saying this is what mass effect andromeda could or should have been.
---
I agree fully with this. Fortunately for the PC folks, there's a mod for that. [https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout76/mods/148](https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout76/mods/148) I've no idea what BGS was smoking when they designed that stupid slider.

Well, if you ever get over those things, I'd give it a recommend. Worthy of multiple plays.

Yup, had the same, asked questions about it

---
Reaching pretty far here and yeah I do maybe not with an official feature but I have discretion that is used during trades.
---
I have a full set of ultracite power armor. Has calibrated shock on one leg. If you have the flux I can put calibrated on the other leg as well.
---
I don‚Äôt blame you, it‚Äôs not a lot of fun. If you do decide to, the spawn near the ice cream shop is much easier than the others it seems.
---
And really what‚Äôs with the caps kiddo we know your angry alreadyüòÇ
---
Good to know thank you!
---
I can assure you, as someone who isnt really a fan of mass effect. Its really nothing like it. The only similarity is that they're both action RPGs
---
ok natalist
---
If they are in the game they are the franchise aesthetics now.
---
Listen, I got this meeting I forgot about.  You‚Äôre ok on your own here, right?  It looks like you‚Äôve got things under control.
---
I have the plans, so can make A set for you.  Frames are easy enough to come by, I‚Äôd Just need the mats.  PSN aj ninetyeight, or aj-98 in game.
---
I‚Äôll be on sometime in the next 1/2 hr.  IIRC, I‚Äôm in the ash heap - welsh, I think, and am headed toward WS.
---
I might be interested if it has a good sale. But I bought Borderlands 1 and 2 on a sale and never played them, so dunno. ü§î
---
You‚Äôre willing to trade it? That‚Äôd be awesome, but I have literally no flux, I‚Äôve been struggling figuring out a good way to farm it in the nuke zones/there haven‚Äôt been nuke zones the last couple nights I‚Äôve played, and all the rad fluxes I collected spoiled.
---
I‚Äôve found a lot of them in safes.
---
I get them a lot on Xbox but I think it‚Äôs my Xbox getting old. Especially when I‚Äôve had it on all day. Seems to happen on all games I play.
---
And it‚Äôs not about the ability to do it kiddo. You stated earlier that simply deciding not to sell to 1st players is spreading anger. That‚Äôs blatantly false and an attack on our right to take business where we wish and where we do not wish
---
Spot on. 
---
This isnt the movies, you dont get hired and make 6 digits for breaking into a bank to see if you can. Rather, you get arrested for b&amp;e.
---
I let my 9yo play under supervision, as well. He's mature enough to understand the differences between gameplay and real life responsibilities. And earns his screen time through grades and chores.
---
I'd be happy to let him give you some lessons on maturity.
---
Hah, fine with me. We are just going to have to agree to disagree anyway, it seems. You aren't berating me or trying to ruin something I paid good money for, so go in peace. ;)
---
I mean that‚Äôs very charitable but I already have the plans and the materials are exactly my current issue lol. I think I‚Äôm like 70 screws shy.
---
Or they should have started targeting the community with well constructed surveys and polls to get a bigger picture of what is actually happening.
---
The money they spent getting those people out there would have more than covered it.
---
Oh yes luck definitely influences the condition of loot.  No question.  I was talking more about the quality of legendary effects.
---
Your profile pictures says different
---
I did 4 or 5 encrypted events this weekend. Got a fixer plan almost every one.
---
I sell em cheap. 1250 caps. Seen people charging 5k, 10k... even 15k!
---
Furious
---
Maybe for some, but I doubt they are familiar with the ESO subscription method
---
Actually, if you trace it back far enough, gamebyro was an mmo engine.... just an ass-ancient mmo engine.
---
While gamebyro =/= creation engine =/= fo76 engine... it's a bit of a "grandfather's axe situation. There's still a little bit of oblivion code chilling in that engine somewhere, but it's mostly new parts.
---
Right. Mass Effect is way better
---
Meh, if you're into that sort of thing. Me, not so much.
---
I find your journalist skills crude and pedantic in addition the way you've went out of your way to belittle your subject is more a sign to how petty and little a person you are as opposed to how you were trying to frame your subject and has me wondering if this conversation happened at all. I cant imagine anyone cheater or not putting up with someone as childish and immature as yourself
---
If this supposed cheater existed this could of been an entertaining and informative read however as is it seems more of a dick bragging contest 0/10
---
They had us in the first half not gonna lie.
---
I'll just give it to you. PSN TheLousyRaider
---
What about those people who get hired by the fbi becuz of their skills
---
Don‚Äôt worry I‚Äôm giving him candy for helping me. He‚Äôll be out of shape in no time.
---
What a mensch, when works for you? I can hop on now if you‚Äôre free.
---
Vending machines don't really work well on private servers.
---
Ad Victoriam.
---
It depends on your level. For example to grind for the glowing skeleton outfit I reached overseer rank 16. And leveled 4 times. My character then was 62, now 66. Now I farm with a fresh dedicated character and until overseer rank 14, I leveled in total 11 times. The experience scales with your level as well as the rewards, however higher level require much more to level.
---
Haha I‚Äôm on Xbox so we can‚Äôt hack. Or maybe we can but I don‚Äôt know how. He‚Äôs a living hack! 
---
We are about 5k short of the glowing skeleton so let‚Äôs see if we can continue his good luck tonight.
---
You mean liike in the movies?
---
Lmfao well you should go on and pretend you're me to all my friends on my friend's list. Fair warning though. They all know I'm a girl so your female voice better be damn good.
---
I‚Äôll buy his bus ticket this afternoon. He will need real food too at some point so hopefully there‚Äôs a Whataburger where you live.
---
The notifications are bugged, as far as I know, they don't always correspond with actual levels in Adv. I'm also pretty sure that the Adv XP and caps are tied to kills, for both AI and other players.
---
That's going to be a rather long list and will require a lot of effort on your part to maintain. But hey, if you haven't got anything else to do with your time then knock yourself out.
---
I do a better gay voice than a girl but I‚Äôll start practicing, well fool them so hard
---
I actually DO enjoy NW when I play it as a hide and seek type experience. I sort of get a rush trying to make it undetected all the way to the final circle. But once I get there I usually have no chance at killing anyone because my aim is just awful. Terrible. Not good at all.
---
Prey is very, very good  though.
---
I like the dialogue, but I liked the combat and weapons in Andromeda more than OW. Seems like the same game, only slower.
---
no, same theory, rapid fire and surpressors dont go well together.
---
I‚Äôll edit the post if we make it tonight. I was thinking about alternating matches with him and seeing who could rack up the most xp. Me with hiding and surviving vs him with all out warfare.
---
read my PSA from a month ago about this very same topic. 
---
The client doesnt crash.  Network infrastracuture causes data and packet loss which causes the client side to disconnect.
---
That wasn't the issue being raised though. The issue is that some are so salty about the 1st subscription that they want to be able to cut themselves off from those players.
---
I 100% agree with you on the assholes part, and for the most part people who you have blocked aren't able to join your server randomly or directly via you (they can't see you). The only time it would happen is if they joined another player who you did not have blocked. Otherwise the game automatically separates blocked players.
---
No whataburger here. :'(
---
been there, done that.  own one. 
---
Next question?
---
Very true. I‚Äôm thinking about alternating matches with him tonight and seeing which style racks up more xp. His style is definitely high risk low reward. Mine is low risk but sort of boring. Haha
---
This is wholesome
---
Depends on what sort of candy you‚Äôre paying with.
---
Yes, as long as you dont literally hack.
---
And all of that because of a troll post of mine xD Who is the triggered one now lol
---
Ooof that‚Äôs terrible why haven‚Äôt you moved yet?
---
If you think the rules should be otherwise then form a subreddit for that purpose.  I am sure it will be educational.
---
But thats how private server works.
---
That's pretty much what we do here.
---
While I agree, I don't think the shame part is going to work out the way you think it will.
---
If everyone is given a scrap box the only thing that would make it fair enough to make me keep 1st is if the stash became unlimited. I don‚Äôt think the scrap box should be for everyone, it‚Äôs is the biggest benefit of having 1st. 
---
Personally and from my friends list, the private servers aren‚Äôt something making the subscription the most valuable and wanted feature. 
---
Okay the atoms are a nice thing to have but those you can just buy when you want something, and probably less earned money for Bethesda because you have 3ish screens to confirm and that‚Äôs enough time to change your mind. I‚Äôve done it a few times because I wanted something but by the confirm screen ‚Äúnah I can wait, it‚Äôs not something I want that much‚Äù
---
I keep my first avatar and gear off so people still shop at my vendor (that and imposter is my favorite outfit). I will however do my mothman dance after someone makes purchases. I have pissed off so many of these krill upset that a whale got their caps lol.
---
In every other game I have always got whatever dlc I wanted no issue. Only this game are people trying to start some civil war over people spending their own money. Why don't these krill focus their efforts on real world issues instead of game devs doing exactly what other game devs do. It is an online game and to play online you need servers and servers are not cheap. Krill are dumb.
---
Yeh plans don‚Äôt sell anymore unless they‚Äôre rare so I carry the crappy plans I get from workshops or if I find them just to give them to lower levels
---
For non-explosive weapons and boss fights, furious. For explosive bullets and other enemies, TSE
---
Woah seriously? Of all the things that have happened recently this seems far and away the biggest concern, is there a larger discussion about this somewhere that I missed?
---
No, private "servers" are just an instance. We still use the same servers as everyone else, we just can't interact with each other. 
---
If you want to separate yourselves so badly, then spend the $13 and get the subscription. The people begging for money on the street corners make more than that in 30 minutes.
---
I won‚Äôt tell my son that. He went to school today thinking he was a NW god. Hahaha
---
Reported to bethesda for account boosting\*
---
I couldn't agree more.
---
Yeah I'm on now. Can you join my world? We are in the middle of an event.
---
It used to be dark around beta, but people whinged about places like the mire (what do you mean a swamp in a nuclear wasteland is dark? ReeeeEEE) and they upped the brightness of everything. Now everything just looks washed out, sad times.
---
Nah, not triggered. Just tired of the same 20 people shitposting repeatedly about the same thing.
---
we should be able to post videos with the cheaters name
---
In all honesty he probably is better than all of us, never break his spirit. I'm glad the little guy is enjoying it!
---
I did that Saturday, saw a lvl 1 at V76 getting ready to come out and gifted him a ton of plans and a military outfit, a mile miners gauntlet stimpacks, water, and dog food. Kinda, a welcome to Appalachia gift bag.
---
That‚Äôs to be expected from this piece of shit game. I mean I like the game and enjoy it, but I can still say it‚Äôs an awful game.
---
That you should but only if you have proof. Let‚Äôs be honest, Bethesda isn‚Äôt helping, so blocking the players we can prove are cheating would go a long way
---
The longest con
---
source?
---
Thanks for the help, much appreciated.
---
I seem to be having a bug where I literally cannot search for any players, could you try to add me? My psn is D1ONYSIAN
---
Hahaha same here! I can't stop playing no matter how broken it is. I guess I have an obsession with finding that needle in a haystack legendary.
---
Building is fun sometimes too but damn. They need to bring this game out of its bug ridden gutter.
---
If you are always on the queen then furious.  If you are swapping targets to help with adds it's a toss up as you will constantly be building that furious damage on new targets but the second shot on the two shot is stupid unpredictable so you may not be hitting with it at all.  So it would be a close wash if you're only stacking 5 or 6 furious stacks since if you hit every time with the two shot its 25% dps increase.
---
I would use the furious though since bad rng could have you miss with every single second shot on the two shot.
---
A smaller camp budget and 1st have more vending space is no where close to the value/utility of the scrap box. If they were to do that 90% of 1st subscribers would drop the subscription. The vending is limited by stash weight, 30k cap limits. The only thing that would keep and probably gain subscribers is if the stash became unlimited. That‚Äôs the only ‚Äúfair‚Äù trade off if everyone was to get a scrap box
---
Do you ever get the damage bug that seems to heal the enemies as you're shooting them? Is there a work around for that? I.E. replacing the splitter with focuser? Cheers! Got this problem with both my Primed Ultracite and Non Ultracite Lasers, both have splitter and AA prefix.
---
If you like deadpan monotone delivery you might enjoy the films of Aki Kaurism√§ki
---
Yeah actually I do get it a lot. I'm not sure on a fix.
---
Point taken, combat was more developed in me. 
---
I guess what i was trying to say was it has fo or bioshock style visually, but combat with two other members who you access to control cds along with exploration being hub based with a space ship and skill trees it has a definate me flavor.
---
Had someone do this to me yesterday after I bought something from their vending machine, I did the dance back and they gave me a heart emote üòÇ it was great
---
I'm an older gamer, I remember playing games for the game and to not see the game over screen.
---
Paying for a monthly service shouldn't apply to a game that was released and beta tested over a year by everyone who already payed $60 to begin with. It shouldn't apply to games in general actually.
---
This is textbook corporate greed.
---
Games should be a working product on release which hasn't been the case for over too many years now, exactly because of arrogant idiots like you. It's like buying the overpriced stuffed bear on a funfair instead of playing the silly little game for it. 
---
You can clearly tell. The actual game part in games declines everytime and gets replaced with boring endless grind mechanics with just that tad of addictiveness to it. If everybody was like you, devs would entirely scrap the game part and give us a virtual world where we can buy virtual trophees after we spend enough hours in said virtual world. 
---
People like you are the reason the games market is going to shit.
---
And by the way, your comment was ridiculous enough already. You really didn't need to use a thesaurus.
---
This, if u fuck up for a single moment and make all npcs aware of your position you're gone.
---
I was excited for it (and TES6) up until the last two months. I hope it's a great game, but there is no way Bethesda is getting another $60 from me at launch after FO76.  If it's good, and it's not monetized to hell, I'll pick it up on sale.  I've been a Bethesda fanboy for the last 15+ years, but I'm tired of trying to defend them.
---
I need 14k on my wife's account. She asked me today. Thanks hun. 
---
I will pay whatever his asking wage would be. I dont offer retirement or healthcare but I offer a signing bonus of 1 month of homework completion by a high honors HS sophomore 
---
Sadly, my kid is "too busy" playing forknife on xbone. I swear he is the milkmans kid or something smh
---
I live in the Northeast. It's all about Sheetz here. Lol
---
Safe?
---
Actually none, because all mods are not allowed according to their TOS/Eula.
---
But since Beth can not even implement an accurate cheat detection...
---
Yes, I‚Äôve had it happen a few times. I think the cap cost reflected where I was headed, though, instead of where I wanted to go.
---
Agreed. They‚Äôre slowly improving it... I think. Hard to tell at this point. I mean, I‚Äôm not much for battle royales, but nuclear winter is kindof fun. And the wastelanders dlc coming out soon sounds fun. They really can improve the game when they aren‚Äôt focusing on turning into EA. What do you play it on? I play it on Xbox. Yes, I‚Äôm a console peasant for the time being üòÇ.
---
Found the shill.
---
That title looks kinda click bait to me ü§î
---
Out of the gate, your two-shot outperforms the furious at 637 DPS (damage per second) compared to 509 DPS with the Furious.  However, after 8 on target hits with your Furious, your DPS goes up to 713 DPS.  In the long run on a Queen fight the Furious comes out on top. Plus you'll get better accuracy to boot.
---
I found a bunch that looked un-powered, tried to use them anyway and it worked fine for me, so at the very least, they work for some players (if you can't find a fix right away).
---
I'll prob swap splitter for focuser and report back to you bud. It's a pain in the arse cause they absolute melt enemies otherwise! Cheers. Do you have them Primed? Makes a massive difference, if you are okay with crafting the ammo obviously!
---
I've got three machines in one room, usually needs two machines to quit and restart before they all show up in the social list.
---
It doesnt happen on my FFR lasers until I use my Junkies one. It happens on all explosives ones ive tried. Currently I take off two ranks of Commando.
---
Yeah I never know what to put there. Normally when I try to show off camps people get pissy at me for some reason so I'm trying to adapt...obvs not in the right direction haha
---
It's not just one unlucky guy it's hundreds of unlucky people, did you even read the comments? There's tons of replies saying they farm for hours and nothing, and this is coming from almost 400ish people who commented. You never hear someone say they got a tse drop. I'm not saying that they totally don't exist, Bethesda hasn't said any specifics on it so it's a gamble between hearsay of people... some people say that the roll doesn't drop at all, some people say the drop rate it so low it's basically nothing and some people say the drop is either "two shot" or "explosive" but never both. So I really can't go off what you say vs the other 400 or so people who agreed or semi agreed with that unlucky guys post. I mean how long have you even played the game? Have you ever even gotten a tse legendary drop yourself?
---
I'm on ps4, I hear PC is worse off than consoles as far as bugs/hackers. And yeah I am pretty sure once wastelanders hits it will breathe new life into the game. I'll even bet people are waiting to buy it until then. But hell at this point I'd be happy with them releasing the next patch already!!
---
This.
---
This would make a great time for  Fallout 1^st *Premium* members.
---
It is not advisable for two reasons. First, because inocent people will inevitably get shafted in some way. Second, because it is not one of Bethesda's priorities. 
---
If you want to make a statement, just don't play Nuclear Winter. Numbers matter. Ask Survival mode players.
---
I ground out the 3500 xp for the weapon skins on a level 353 toon.  Told me like 3 times I leveled.  I did not level but I also watched how much xp I got  each match and it was not even close to enough to level either.  Guessing something is wrong in their alerts.
---
Well, I‚Äôd like them to release it early, but knowing them they‚Äôre gonna release it on time and it still won‚Äôt be finished. üòÇ
---
It tries to, I imagine that if a player is blocked by enough other players eventually the game has to put him or her on a server with someone that has blocked them.
---
My Amiga isn't even breaking a sweat!
---
This isn't tetris, or pac man. This is a modern game,it's one all the time. This means there are server fees, server maintenance, developers that constantly work on the game, and all sorts of other overhead. This isn't some 8-bit Atari game that took ome guy 30 minutes to program in his spare time. If you're that far out of touch with how things have changed, then keep your dusty opinion on the shelf with your dentures. 
---
This could have been avoided,, most likely, by atom purchases. Yet the loyal "fans " decided not to spend any money, and just grind out the free ones. Now we have a subscription. Constant cash flow is necessary for this game to continue staying online; if you don't like that, then go back to Donkey Kong. Oh, and thanks for crashing the housing market by the way, we all really appreciated that!
---
I don't need a thesaurus to sound more intelligent than you, I could do that in my skeep.
---
Haven't tried primed yet, may do that if I can find he plans. How hard is the ammo to craft?
---
Laser gun or laser musket? I haven't seen or heard anything about a laser gun like that before
---
Yeah. Do that without using cheat engine or breaking the rules and he will have my full respect
---
Only one way to find out
---
I'm giving Bethesda premium money to be a first. Anything they they do in the future needs to be speedpatched for us first members, then the rest of non-paying players.
---
I add burning damage and aligned everything. Love to see the flames on big, bad enemies.
---
My abacus runs it smoothly
---
On the bright side was prob good silo practice to improve your time next go around. 
---
Same thing happened to me yesterday. Launched nuke on impostor area, then just about to launch imposter i bluescreened. Luckily my bud was there so he could star event b4 nuke dropped and get that easy event complete and fixer plan.
---
Most of them would be happy if you could. They like the attention. üòí
---
On the map press left on the d pad and then under combat I think, you can also track progress and it will pop up when you start and end a match
---
üòÇüòÇüòÇ Funny. I'm a project manager for a construction company. I work hard for my money, so I can afford things like $13 subscription to help me enjoy a game more, and support the developers!
---
Eh, I'm not sure how it would work in that even to be honest.
---
I don't think the issue is inability to afford it lol. Some people just hate the p2w of F1st.
---
oh man...14k in a day is gonna be a GRIND!
---
He prefers full size Snickers, and he likes the idea of his hw being taken care of. 
---
As his agent, on behalf of my client, we accept your proposal.
---
No, you can compare base game plus 3 years of features to base game at launch.
---
Ah so it's maybe linked to having higher damage output. I'll fiddle with it! Cheers.
---
Same
---
Ye, check the forum. I‚Äôve been following the people writinh about their hacks just for the lulz
---
There's nothing pay to win about it though. All of this outrage is so... extra. You would think Bethesda took away everyone's inventory and made then pay to get it back, piece by piece.
---
If you're ps4 I'll launch another with you in a couple hours. Or 2 or 3... lol
---
haha jk jk this whole post is fake it was actually me all along i'm really good at NW i swear plz Beth no
---
Ily
---
I want my vending machines to sell only to first members and not the freeloaders.
---
 I tried to play it on pictograms scratched into the dirt, but my arm gets tired, so the FPS drop is terrible.
---
Damn
---
If on PC it's M and then -&gt; arrow
---
I've been having a weird new one recently. On loading into a new world, my total ammo supply next to my current mag supply will drop down to under 10, usually 5 or 7 I think, and I'm unable to fire or reload my gun. I have to switch weapon completely and then it's fixed.
---
It's in character challenges. You can use the jump button to track it, and every time you die it will show your progress on screen.
---
I don't find it a hassle at all as I'm always crafting loads of ammo anyway! Wouldn't fancy converting my Handmade though. That might be a bit more of a struggle to keep up with the ammo!
---
Most of the people playing here feel the same. It's like I stopped playing videogames and just play Bethesda's. 
---
And I have been playing for the last 34 years, non stop, on almost every possible platform. 
---
I might take a break when TLOU2 gets released.
---
I guess I'm finding out from many comments that I'm not terrible at NW (playing the hide and seek style), but I most def am terrible at anything involving combat. I actually enjoy the sort of sneaky adrenaline that comes when a team is looking for me and I'm sneaking past them to stay in the circle.
---
They won't even be able to tell the difference I'm sure lol.
---
Everything ive seen so far is telling me it has to do with DPS and not individual shot damage. My wife rans a rifleman build and she never had issues, but as shes switched to Commando and began using a JFFR Ultracite, it started happening around the time she got her 4th Commando perk. 
---
So it kinda depends. I just nutered my DPS a little so it doesnt trigger. You could go for higher individual shot damage at a lower ROF and potentially have the same results.
---
HAPPY CAKE DAY
---
Next time I'm up there visiting friends I will search out this "Sheetz" you speak of. I'm intrigued.
---
Yeah, the best you can do is hook then to a switch and cycle it with every login to save the trouble or requiring. They have never worked correctly.
---
I didn't even think about doing that.... so you can launch your nuke then fast travel with a key card and start the event and it instakills the assaultron?
---
They are supposed to add rejoin previous servers in the next patch. But yeah at least I know how to do it now.
---
Lemme get the rest of your ammo.
---
I've been harassed for "cheating" more times than anything, even though I've never actually cheated. There are so many glitches that happen while you're playing, some of which won't even be apparent to you when they happen. Most of it is just server issues. 
---
Some way or another, however, you will end up destroying a group of people and they simply can't live with that reality. They message their friends, they slam you on social media, they send endless messages promising a humiliating demise (which never happens), they report you every way they can.... It sucks and it's sad. A more stable environment would help prevent most of these instances, but people will almost always presume you're cheating when they can't beat you.
---
I recall a couple of examples where people sent squads after me, only to end up realizing they're griefing someone who enjoys the attention and turbulence so much that they either give up or start apologizing. Lol. 
---
If you do, in fact, have proof of an exploit or cheat, I would recommend validating your claim by sharing that proof, privately, with a few trusted sources. Maybe reach out to a mod for a second opinion and direction as to if and how you should proceed.
---
Outwardly slamming players and flaming against them is strictly against most forum rules. Tread carefully and good luck.

---
I know, right?
---
Do you really think that‚Äôll work? No one is a big enough asshole to...
---
&gt;  Would be less likely to be griefed. 
---
But I like griefers. How am I going to be a PKK if there is no PK?
---
to be fair, i have seen quite a few GIFs that prove getting a brick through a window can be a challenge
---
I bad it happen once. I wondered why it only cost 22 caps to travel across the map. Then I figured out why.

Thanks. üôÇ

I've been watching my 9 year old play Fortnite and he keeps getting 1st and 2nd place (when he isn't occasionally getting ganked at #98) and I've been thinking I should just let him play NW for me. Thanks for letting me know I'm not crazy, that to succeed at NW you have to play it like a 9 yo.
---
Your answer is bullshit. How many hours did you play skyrim yesterday and what did you do in game?
---
Thank you and yes, Happy Cakeday indeed!
---
Not to be that guy but sounds like you need better gear.
---
Lol that's the truth!! I'd put money on it they release another plushie in the atomic store before the next patch rolls out. Lmao
---
Thank you everyone! I found it
---
The playstyle is hard enough for average gamers. The average person that plays 76 cant even stay alive as a full hp build let alone a 19% build. Obviously if you have BE25 or BFFR25 handmade and full uny powered sneak/sent along with dodgy, lone wanderer and serendipity all maxed out you are going to be a god. Same with if you're a full hp build with a VE plasma.
---
Bloody doesnt need a nerf there just needs to be some harder content to accommodate for anyone that isnt a food build in full broken armour and responder clothes
---
Ah another fallen to the shitty game doing shitty things may i suggest outerworlds
---
Also tse .50 cal machine guns and tse mini guns are so damn rare they basicly legacy weapons. Like legit I can find them online for sale saying "legacy" 
---
Do you hear of a tse minigun or .50 cal drop? Ya, no. 
---
Just because the weapon doesn't do energy damage doesn't mean Bethesda didn't take them from the game and it is now a legacy weapon. Tse was so OP especially with The Dragon in particular (and black powder weapons) that they had to nerf it and they never really clarified if the roll two shot explosive was no longer going to be dropped or not. You obviously haven't been playing very long. 
---
**Did you know that all legacy weapons that are explosive energy weapons end up using ballistic damage anyways**
---
Create a new or burner reddit account to say your quitting? 
---
Btw ,45 rounds are not explosive, that is a weapon legendary effect. Sounds like perhaps you know enough to spread hate, but not enough to know vets will call out lies. Good luck on your next burner acct and attempt to hate on game though.
---
Entirely normal.  Been an issue since launch
---
Sadly true :/
---
I agree that cheaters are shit garglers, but Bethesda is not doing it‚Äôs job. Do you know why sports matches have referees? This isn‚Äôt a perfect world, sweetheart.
---
to be fair, this can happen if you one shot it as well
---
I would really like a bigger camp build budget. I think for me, personally, that would be fair. I use the crap out of the scrap box, that was the biggest draw for me. The atoms are nice, but I had no problem buying small amounts of atoms that I was unable to earn quick enough for something on sale. The tent is cool, I've used it maybe 3 times, and its USUALLY to drop scrap off in my scrap box. So if it became something everyone would use, I would still want something exclusive to FO1 so I would love my camp budget increased. I constantly have to delete and rearrange and rebuild every time something new comes in the shop.
---
Not supported, which is different than not allowed.
---
Had the same issue yesterday (11/10) -- wherever I went two crates would fall from the sky (kinda like the Scorchbeast issue where they follow you around, but that's usually localized to the Bog). This started after completing the Collision Course event at Morgantown Airport. I completely looted both of them to see if that would help, but the empty crates just kept showing up everywhere I went.
---
I filed a ticket but it wasn't clear which category to choose, so I filed it under In-Game Support/Challenge Issue.
---
I had a similar experience when my dad was using a rented Bobcat. It took me 45 minutes to learn how to use it better than he was doing it. üòÖ
---
Rollplay cringe. Found a group of roll players forming "an assault" on the steal plant and took the plant br they got there. More ppl = slower moving group.
---
well to be fair I HAVE finished second place a few times using my hide and seek play style. Once it comes to combat though I'm usually wiped out easily. So if by success you mean winning then yeah I need him. But just to grind XP I can do ok.
---
But seriously let him play if the blood doesn't bother you as a parent. There's no mature subject themes in NW other than the violence/blood. Voice chat hasn't been an issue for us. Most people are nice, and honestly more courteous than some of the people he's gotten teamed up with in Fortnite!
---
It's perfect for stand alone tough enemies. Use it on a e.g. a yaoguai and then switch weapon without reloading to kill them before they get in melee range.
---
Plasma gatling uses plasma cores.
---
Laser gatling uses Fusion cores.
---
that reminds me...we need vehicles in Fallout!
---
Never claimed you did research but did come to a conclusion... what an idiot. Bandwagon much?
---
I've never heard of anyone getting banned for using a mod of any sort.  If you stay away from anything that changes gameplay, you should be fine.
---
None of them will work in NW if you're planning on that, but in the regular game, you have very little chance of running into issues if you stick with stuff you can download from reputable sites.  I haven't seen anything questionable on the nexus site, but use your best judgement and avoid anything that seems like it's cheating.
---
The capitalist class exploits worker class for profit. Profit is literally an unequal exchange. Profit literally can not exist if things are exchanged fairly.
---
&gt; noun
---
&gt; noun: profit; plural noun: profits
---
&gt; a financial gain, especially the difference between the amount earned and the amount spent in buying, operating, or producing something.
---
Let's imagine for a second, that I'm taking only base zones into account. Not Morrowind, not Murkmire, not any dlc content or what not.
---
There you go.
---
Fast traveled to my camp on Saturday and it spawned me in a different location somewhere in the forest. Only thing is it spawned me pretty high so I fell to my death.
---
Yeh I don‚Äôt do that anymore to level ones bc half the time they are mule accounts and that person just goes to sell them on their main account. Kinda defeats the purpose and I‚Äôd prefer to gift the items to actual new players like level 10-20 bc they can use them more
---
Yes, try and pepper the imposter before nuke lands though or you cant loot him. 
---
Either way one 3 star missed if i cant is fine, i want the event rewards not a likely 1 star leg from imposter.
---
Btw you need to stay in blast zone to make sure you are in event zone, so you will die.
---
And power armour uses fusion cores
---
Testing it to see if it's real (and he may have found how to solve it too idk) is better than just saying it exists, it gets it alot more attention and something may actually be done about it. 
---
You should have respect for him anyway, he helped close a pretty major security exploit.. Login Info just being sent over the internet in Plain Text, possibly why so many accounts have been stolen.
---
He also found more flaws even the exploiters didn't know &amp; reported them.
---
I think his intentions were good but I can see why a corporation wouldn‚Äôt see that since tos is always to black and white
---
True but you wouldn't need as much time/ammo/stims.  Just saying a legendary beast might be him rushing the game which makes the game extra frustrating.
---
I wouldnt think itd be good for sniping due to no optics....close up itd be good though
---
Oh nooooooooo.
---
Lol their dog shit netcode is the cause
---
Yeah. No kidding but I can only get the gear the game provides. I just hit level 70.
---
Yeah, it's unfortunate
---
you know who they are,the silent aimbotters the guys that shoot at the sky and people die
---
Power Armour can also run off of Ultracite FC‚Äôs as well.
---
Why did they test the exploits?
---
I'd say no, too easy to brigade random people. The other day I was playing nuclear winter with a melee build. Between a full stack of perks, melee bobblehead, fury and twisted muscles I was one shotting people in full power armor with a pole hook. It probably looked suspicious as hell but was all above board.
---
If someone looks to be cheating you can report them via the social menu.
---
That's Bethesda's job. Just report it and Bethesda will run the test. If you decided to run the test for whatever reason, don't come here crying Bethesda banned you for nothing
---
I did meet some nice people. We always laughed at the updates and the new bugs that came with them. Patch notes were only 50%, the rest you had to find out yourself. Patches always promised more then they could deliver. They keep telling us to be patient for the unfinished mess we paid full price for. They removed the pvp option. Fallout 1st was the nail in the coffin. Majority of the community (that I am part of) got it, but only 20-30% actually played. My personal feeling is that the game will be dead before wastelanders, but thats
---
Nah I'd recommend a normal lever action moded with suppressor.
---
They weren't at the start line on release and still aren't really there a year later.
---
Gotcha, I really want that plan so that's what I'll try to do. Thanks
---
Agreed. 
---
To add. Two-shot degrades the weapon faster as well.
---
Cool, thanks for the info, I'll chuck on a lab coat and have a play about with them!
---
whoa there, thats a little racist
---
Furious for queen. Two shot for trash mobs
---
This I will have to try too.
---
Its a rite of passage. I never crash while nuking anymore, but many of us crashed on our first nukes back in the day. Welcome, to the end game.
---
They actually have a bit of a habit of not staying where they land.  I noticed it a few times this weekend.  Usually you can find them if you look around.
---
Also, if you TP around a bit, they tend to drop on your head wherever you TP to, which I've used to my advantage a time or two.
---
the fact someone blocked can interact with anything at all or show up on the same server is a joke to begin with
---
Too many people are pissy on here. It's nice to see a post outside of the normal. Don't let them bother you. Just keep doing your thing.
---
You left out personal sessions, I wonder why...
---
I have four boys, a full time job, and hardly have any time to play anymore. Trust me when I tell ya, you really DO lose it when responsibilities come into play, and theres hardly any time to game.
---
If skyrim was released as online it wouldnt have done well
---
That's what everyone wanted
---
Thats what 2FA does
---
The base zones that were enhanced with features over 3 years of content expansions?
---
One example: when ESO launched all of the overland delves were small and had the same copied and pasted layout. They were replaced during the first 3 years. The base game you are playing is not the base game I played at launch.
---
&gt; At release, delves were much smaller and consisted of a single linear, circular path. Updates 3, 4, 5, and 6 expanded most delves to their current size, but some base game delves still retain the old layout.
---
https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Online:Delves
---
How?
---
They existed at least.
---
&gt;If someone looks to be cheating you can report them via the social menu.
---
that does absolutely nothing
---
Its what we pros call a ‚Äùleech‚Äù.
---
They have... there have been numerous surveys on the forum. They are constantly giving opportunities for feedback. This was just one other way to collect voice of the customer.
---
No because you cant suppress it. After shooting once, all of WV will know where you are and will kill you before you're done reloading next week
---
Seems spot on. I had an adventure mode encounter with someone who seemed very similar to the person you described. I cannot I say his name, but he seems pretty infamous, and I cannot forget him as his name is similar to a stoic race in Star Trek.
---
To make a long story short, I got challenged by some guy I happened across after he finished PVPing some people. The people seemed upset he was using all the usual duped gear, but I fight those people all the time, so I wasn't too afraid. I offered to swap to my PVP character and he insisted. So, I added him as friend, logged out and swapped. When I came back, I noticed he was fighting with the infamous toxic cheater I cannot name. I warned the guy who challenged me not to fight him because he is a cheater or asshole or both. He told me, "Oh ok, I won't now that you tell me." The challenger ended up shooting me with a legacy gun to start a duel, I returned fire and won. At this point, he who shall not be named was hostile to me and opened fire. I fell for the bait, but managed to escape alive. 
---
I jumped off a roof and ran behind cover. As I was logging out, the last thing I heard was, "Get wrecked noob." Your buddy loses the duel, you fail your ambush, and your ego is so fragile that you have to proclaim victory. I think I laughed for a solid 5 minutes afterwards. Like you said, it is all fragile ego and anti-social behavior.
---
But unavoidable unless they have servers of their own to play on.  Hey, I have an idea, let's make those servers PvP at all times and call them "Survival" servers. /s
---
Looking at it like that actually makes me feel better lol
---
I mean, to be fair, it doesn‚Äôt have much time to crash at one hour of playtime. It usually crashes at minimum twice a day on a long session, usually more up to six times. Hell I even had a private server stop responding with me being the only person in it. I literally walked into the silo and started turning off the turrets and poof, gone
---
thank god i don't get smacked in the head with a brick when i fat finger my pin number
---
I paid $60 and have played for over 600 hours. I have no desire for private servers or any of the other 1st features. I got my money‚Äôs worth. They don‚Äôt ‚Äúowe‚Äù me anything.
---
I'm gonna say no.  The number of people accused of cheating by players who either don't understand the game mechanics or just aren't that good at playing outweigh the number of people who are actually cheating.  I'm talking about across the board for FO76 here, also, not just one aspect of it.
---
For example, I have the marsupial mutation and was once accused of being a hacker and was advised that I was being reported for being able to jump so high.  Another time, I was defending the munitions factory against someone who was contesting it and after killing them five or six times was also advised I was being reported for cheating.
---
Can we stop calling the playstation crash screen "bluescreen"? Bluescreening is a strictly windows thing and repersents a whole different set of issues from the basic crash screen the that happens to be blue on playstation.
---
Every time i see someone post that their system is blue-screening, I immediately think, well that is a hardware issue, because it is, only to find it is someone with a playstation...
---
you are wrong about everything you said. the damage type is NOT ballistic, it is still energy, legacy explosive weapons change the *projectile* type to HITSCAN.
---
I have tons of TSE weapons, I have a TSE .50 cal, I have tons of BE weapons because they are better. I have over 2000 hours in this game. you are wrong about everything you say. TSE is crap compared to BE. the nerf to Two shot lowered the damage on the second shot from 80% to 20% and it did not change the droprate, you are just a big crybaby because you haven't found one yet
---
I never said that, I'm not the OP, get your eyes and brain examined
---
I said at minimum, I usually play 6 hours too.
---
so because of some niche cases people should continue shooting at the sky and let the game mode die 
---
gotcha
---
Very sad times :(
---
Probably the same idiot. Sounds like him, and the name like a certain Star Trek race is pretty similar.
---
Those surveys are a joke, I am talking about properly constructed surveys and polls designed to gather actual data, not to make it appear like you are doing that very thing to justify bad decisions.
---
Rereading, a crash to home screen sounds about par. A crash to desktop is far more common for me
---
They're quite accurate once you learn the sights.
---
OP, I've had a couple of awesome BP rifles. They end up getting sold because of the slooow fire rate. They are pretty light, though, and fun for a time.
---
I bet he's joking.
---
To verify they work. That is step #1 in bug fixing. Verify the bug so you can know where to start looking for the cause. And in an ideal world, players helping verify bugs cuts down on dev work which would, ideally, lead to quicker patches.
---
I have been playing for over 2000 hours and I have almost every gun in the game. you are a child arguing with an expert. I've been trying to teach you how it works but you think you know everything because of a reddit post from 9 months ago LOL
---
Ok. I‚Äôm personally happy with the things added to the game over the past year. I‚Äôm sorry you are not. Things I asked for hve been added. I feel like my voice has been heard. I hope you have something else to play that you can enjoy.
---
nuclear winter is already a dead game mode for the most part 200 players at max 
---
don't want to see it die completely just because some potential innocents which you could just downvote the post and the janitors to remove it
---

Pretty sure normal nuka cola is t51b only, not sure about quantum though. 
---
You cans get about 5 or 6 BOS paints from turning in technical data in Forbidden Knowledge, very much eng on that one though, still have not gotten the elder paint myself.
---
Also nw gives some power armor paint.
---
I have a worse version of the PS4 (ps4 slim) and it doesn't crashes too much, obviously there are people who just want to bother other people by overloading the servers or duping but I don't count that cases, even though that they're not so common.
---
If you think that all aimbotters shoot at the sky, then you are sorely mistaken, there are loads of different hacks outthere, some very hard to tell, if it's a skilled player or a cheat.
---
Thx!
---
Yes Mr Gates, appologies.
---
So yeah the deleted comments where so totally not a Bethesda shill...

 [https://help.bethesda.net/app/answers/detail/a\_id/44429/\~/can-i-use-mods-or-other-third-party-programs-with-fallout-76%3F](https://help.bethesda.net/app/answers/detail/a_id/44429/~/can-i-use-mods-or-other-third-party-programs-with-fallout-76%3F)   
---
&gt; Fallout 76 does not support the use of any mods, add-ons, or other third-party programs. Please be aware that the use of such applications may result in Fallout 76 not functioning properly.   
---
Pretty much if you get a mod from the nexus, you are safe. I would not use any not from the nexus.
---
Yes. That's my main gripe with Fallout 1st. The tent is another one, but it's not as big as the box.
---
When they flew the youtubers out to play the game, before anyone else but the devs were playing it, they said that junk was weightless when you scrap it. Then they made it have weight, because of supposed server stability. That's fine, even if not for server stability. They could have simply made it like that just for game design reasons...
---
But then they give you the option to have unlimited scrap if you pay more. So the way I see it is that they created an issue to later sell you the solution. Also there's that stuff Pete Hines said about paid content only being cosmetic.
---
Thing is, I'd have totally gotten the subscription if it were just the server and cosmetic only, if only for the discounted atoms. I have no problem with them charging for a server, it makes sense to pay for one. I'd have bought the riot armor if it were in the atomic shop.
---
Do you have Chem Resistant equipped in your perks?
---
Uhhh so where is the line between that and cheating?
---
In any other game that behavior gets you banned so why is it different here?
---
One full respec by completing some kind of one-time quest would be a good idea considering the steep learning curve, but after that only one per level is fine.  I enjoy the idea of people not being able to easily switch their SPECIAL whenever they want, but at least give them a chance to do it once.
---
&gt;That's what I always wanted from 76. Fun role play and dynamic encounters out in the world. For a few weeks, I had it and really enjoyed it. Tip of the cap to these role players, I hope they are having fun.
---
This, we really just have to be what we want to see in the world. I try to keep all of my interactions in character to some extent just to keep the fire burning.
---
Yeah only because your camp got removed in the spot I've been debating to move it to.
---
Bethesda have patched this problem. It's called Fallout 1st ;-)
---
Wastlanders estates HOA is a YouTube etc. channel. They have a stream that runs 3? nights a week. And cover all 3 platforms. I think there are 6 ‚Äòhosts‚Äô . They talk about fallout 76 and show off other people‚Äôs camps. It‚Äôs a good place to look if you want to see some really creative camp builds.
---
A simple fix that I imagine would have been easier to code than whitewashing the entire wasteland would of been adding a flashlight. Modders did it to every other fallout game and they are already in 76 in the form of mining and power armour helmets.
---
There's a reason "Darker nights" for fallout 4 is up among the highest rated mods, it's just a better more immersive experience.
---
Yea, it hurts :(
---
Steel is everywhere, but I use WestTek or Big Bend tunnel to farm it in quantity. Most of it is from scrapping, so put on the scrapper perk for more yield. Looks like lead is answered well enough.
---
Toooo many paladins
---
Friendly reminder all the CoD subs hang out hackers to dry so people can pre-emptively block/avoid them.
---
It works, it's good.
---
I don't think bloodied should be nerfed per se.
---
I think there should be some additional cost mechanic for this level of extreme minmaxing.
---
I think the damage levels are acceptable. I think the manevourability of these characters is ridiculous tho. And the radiation shouldn't be their weak spot. 
---
A good tweak IMO would be if the time they can hold breath is boosted, the action point cost to run should be increased, the fall damage should be increased, and radiation damage should be severely reduced, or a perk should be implemented that would remove rads when not exposed to radiation to return it to some base value - i.e. level 1 to 9%, level 2 to 19% and level 3 to 29%.
---
Something to make being superradiated not the most logical thing to do.
---
I couldn‚Äôt place mine down again.
---
Nice try. I just don‚Äôt post on Reddit. In regards to .45 explosive ammo it is a  legendary combat rifle that was dropped. So perhaps you need to reconsider your self-designation as a ‚Äúvet? ‚Äù I literally have 100s of hours from FO3-FO76. FO76 is enraging. I finally have a day off from work and experienced the same glitch again. 
---
Be careful accusing someone you don‚Äôt know of spreading lies. You don‚Äôt know me. If you did you‚Äôd know that I don‚Äôt lie. In fact, I willing put my life on the line for those like yourself who hid behind anonymity and sling hate. I pointed out a game bug that is still present and you make it personal. Really? 
---
Good luck in whatever it is you do. And if you are ever in a pickle in the real world just know it is real men like me who willingly place our life in harms way so that you may live.
---
The complaints came from mostly from Xbox. Consoles have HDR, PC doesn't. It's PC players that want darker nights mainly, and some console players. Just what I've learned from the 20 or so threads on this
---
That's pretty much 76 a year in. Look, dude, I get it, you like the game, but take the rose-tinted glasses off.
---
yeah bruv he definitely got them sick skills when hes shooting at the ground and killing people or just blindly shooting in the sky and people across the map die
---
100% gaming chair skill
---
i also never said all aimbotters,stop projecting
---
I missed that in my Fallout experience. Do you have more details?
---
Tbf, it is a huge blue screen. Makes sense to call this massive blue screen when it crashes on a ps4, well, blue screen...
---
Either something is blocking or the distance is too much between connections

Plague Walker, Electrically Charged, and Unstable Isitope negate Pacifist mode. He hit you, your body reacted, i.e. you hit back

just not supported

Hope so
---
Theres a lot of songs that I cant ever recall hearing played on Appalachia radio, really doesnt feel like theres many songs on there, even when others have made a list with quite a lot of confirmed songs
---
Did a triple take at this title lol. Yeah your gonna need a new system fam.
---
Try running in the direction opposite of what you're currently trying. So, if you running it from A to B, run it from B to A.
---
I can only imagine. Hope that never happens to anyone I know!
---
It's more like the landlord installing locks that don't lock and the one cop in town is arresting people for trying to fix the locks on their own apartment.
---
Your point? So was the turret sound glitch, or the bulk scrap, or just about the entire game. Hell the most recent patch could‚Äôve broke god knows what because they don‚Äôt actually properly test anything
---
the .50 cal you listed is "The Action Hero" which is a weekly quest reward and you cant do the quest anymore so you cant get that unique gun with that NAME. you can still get a TSE .50 cal with the same stats. the ebay seller is calling it a legacy because its a unioque quest item not a normal .50 cal
---
Should be straight forward, but can't go thru objects or to far a distance, use pylons or place the device close to the generator to test it and then you can drag the generator and see what distance you can go. Not sure what it is on PC, but on XB1 it is Y to connect/disconnect .. also never store a generator or any device with wires. Always scrap the wires  first before storing, there some bugs around this.
---
Distance is very small. From roof to lamp. That would be straight wire but it just doesn't work
---
I'm sure someone around here on XBox would be willing to make you a decent level 5 gun and some basic armor.
---
On PC if I see a lower level guy around I usually make a BOS Recon rifle and give it to them with 100 308 rounds or so.
---
These people will only ever comment on posts that don't matter. The real issues are answered with silence.
---
Yea let‚Äôs hope not
---
Intent. It is pretty poor form to punish the people who are legitimately trying to help and don't take advantage of exploits and bugs. A few cases of intentional exploit usage to help get it fixed faster so many more people cant exploit it for personal gain is generally a good thing.
---
Do you really think shaming and naming will stop cheaters? No.  They wouldn't care in the least bit.  And these aren't niche cases.  Innocent people get accused of cheating all the time for the exact reasons I mentioned.  Which may be why this hasn't seemed to be high on BGS's priority list.  You have to weed through all the false reports to get to the real ones.
---
Should something be done?  Of course.  But shaming and naming is not the answer.
---
My kid tends to favor Solo play anyway and I've always had voice chat turned off completely. Probably because if I ever found out I'm playing with anyone younger than say 35 I'd probably rage quit, let alone finding out they're grade schoolers.

Yeah but a shotgun to the face (hardware ban) is a much better deterrent than the threat of spending time in jail (account ban). The problem is nobody seems to be doing anything right now to stop it either way.

What's inconceivable is they are doing this after they announced [Public. Test. Servers.](https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/article/6eNqXDms6VbtrHubE26y4r/new-wastelanders-release-date-private-worlds-the-atomic-shop-and-more)
---
&gt;We‚Äôre also still working on new events, the Legendary Player system, a public test server, perk loadouts, and so much more to come.
---
I don't think damage of bloodied should be adjusted. I think it should be harder to run if your limbs fall off. I think their precision is just right, but I think builds oriented about running should be better than running than sneaker builds, and that's not the case currently.
---
I don't want any modifications to bloodied nor to unyielding. I think being heavily irradiated should have more consequences.
---
I don't think what can be achieved by bloodbuilds is too much. I think it should be more complicated to use and enforcing smarter usage.
---

I dont know why people gotta be dbags about an opinion. Personally..im 100% with you. Sure the game lacks in a few areas..but..at the same time, and more importantly..BSG made a game. Ive loved every fallout they made, and new vegas was a top tier game to me..4 i playedd from release till the day 76 beta started, and ive been on 76 since then.  Whther the game has bugs, glitches, freezes, whatever..i still play the piss out Of this game. If someone made a song that uou listened to everyday for a year...but the song was didnt have any bass..does that make it a bad song?  Sure bassheads wont get into it..but people who love lyrics, or melodies damn sure gonna play the piss out of it. Thats kinda how. I lool at 76...might not be everything to everyone..but i love the game and i love playing it..quirks and all.
---
Because other games have test servers for things like this. It‚Äôs a morally gray area but if they see you‚Äôre someone like this guy who has made a widely used community tool and has been supportive verbally and financially, they‚Äôre ok to turn a blind eye. Bethesda honestly doesn‚Äôt know half of what they‚Äôre doing. They‚Äôve never done online before and they really really suck at it

Sometimes it cannot connect if the distance is too far, but also remember there is a little bit of "slack" in the wire so it hangs low, and sometimes what seems like a straight connection isn't really because the wire slouches a bit. I have this problem sometimes when I am wiring my roof.

I play ultra stealthy into the last 10 alive more often than not.  People run right by you and if you can resist trying to take the kills you quickly realize how many teams run in staggered packs, so going for the first guy usually means you're leaving yourself open to an immediate reprisal from behind.

I get a few wins here and there.  On Sat a well placed plasma mine and a nuka grenade got me 4 kills and 1 opponent away from a win.  The winner of that game was just a better shot than I am.

Go to Camden park, turn around and walk down the road north. Before you get to the Nuka Cola factory you should come across a house. In that house in the refrigerator there should be a doll head.

Fallout 76 is a great game with terrible monetisation... Luckily we can ignore the monetisation.

That sounds like exactly my play style. I've finished 2nd a few times. Top 10 quite a lot by hiding and sneaking. But yes, when it comes down to that final circle combat I just don't have the aiming/reflex skills that my son has.

I still enjoy the game mode and I REALLY enjoyed watching him play.

Aimbotting is definitely the lowest of cheats. Only the biggest douches use that one. It's nothing more than a defiant statement against structured competition and it ruins it for everyone.
---
Bloodied is a small factor in the current game meta. But overall, it is a gun that is too optimized to out optimize the guns that are meant to do what the Handmade shouldnt be doing. It should be a slow firing damage beast from close distance and qhoot slow and recoil like a bitch to make up for th3 damage it has. It's range should effectively be shortened by a lot to make other auto weapons like the combat rifle be more effective at doing distance damage while not being the end all killing machine that the hunting rifle/ lever action should be from a distance.
---
you must be awful at perk builds lol. if you are lvl 50 and built even semi okay shouldnt even take a full box of .50 cal to kill one.
---
And you think the community the creator was a part of didn't do anything nefarious?

The only difference between good and bad here is reporting it and that is a very slight difference.

In the developers eyes there is no difference and i can see why alot of the community sides with bethesda on this one.

I never used that map so i gained nothing from the datamining and exploiting.  I did experience none stop server crashes when datamining found ways to crash servers though

I guarantee I'd never play a single match if I had to listen to other players in NW. It's not too bad when I'm on a team with them because normally they are polite. But if I heard a 9 year old gleefully screaming "GET WRECKED" as he stood over my toon's loot I would probably throw my controller. haha

Cool story bro, glad you tried that subtle attempt to claim moral high ground of harms way to deflect my questioning your posts validity.

Btw im a combat vet from OIF and have continued service in my civ life. So from my perspective nothing is more annoying than when ppl like you try to gain moral high ground by using arguments like you just did about your own job.

Happy vets day.

It has moved quite far forward content wise, it has stagnated QA-wise (some bugs are gone, new are here) and it has gone backwards in terms of monetisation. Objectively I'd say that the game as whole hasn't moved that far from the starting line. But subjectively, my enjoyment of the game has quite increased with all those additions (especially player vending). Too bad we had little to no new content in the last few months...
---
Speaking of Launch...I'm going to be needing this weeks Launch Codes right now unless you want the full wrath of the Nuka Cola Ghoulies coming down on you!
---
Trying to find that but I just can't. Where is it? :D
---
People that find exploits, confirm their conditions, and then report them to the developers are *helping* the game so long as they do not use the exploits they find for personal gain.  Further, these folks *want* the exploits patched out.
---
Cheaters are just asshats that use exploits for personal gain and do not report them because they want to milk it for all it's worth.
---
since my last posting I have not gotten a single badge, both dailies 3 times and tales 3 times. 9 events and no badge. the 4 I did get I got in 2 days. I know for a fact that I got 3 in a row from it was both dailies and a tales. Something doesn't seem right, even if it is RNG
---
Wait till an event brings everyone together. Then you'll see why 1st is so appealing.
---
The engine chugs with 2-3 players in a single area.
---
data mining is not the issue, so that is a null point. And unless you can prove they took advantage of the exploits for their own gain, then that too is null.

Degenerates like you belong on a cross

Renamed/Recompiled cheatengine is being detected now. The issue goes beyond that. The reason the main cheat tool likely has gone unpatched is because of a bypass of some sort to prevent the anti cheat in the client from functioning.

All I can say is that there are several 'Map' sites out there and BGS would be wasting their time to compete or add that functionality in.

Fast traveled to top of the world and ended up at Riverside mansion a few weeks ago.

So your opinion on the matter is irrelevant.

---
I know what you're talking about, and I'm not talking about the camp icon changes.
---
In a previous patch, they addressed a visual problem with the compass markers in which your teammates' markers were indistinguishable from your own. This happened months ago. I believe the change was that your own marker would appear larger. Try seeing if that's still the case. Bethesda may have undone that fix at this point. They are eknown for breaking their own fixes, after all.
---
A color-coding system makes sense. All of your friends on the team list could have a color assigned to them. The same could go for your active quests. Each quest or friend has a color, and each map marker reflects that color.

The wiring in this game is one of the most frustrating and confusing aspects of building. I finally used a pass through conduit correctly after almost 1700 hours because I always got so irritated with wiring my base I usually gave up lol.

Depends on how old she is and what your parents are ok with her playing.  I'd let my 15 yr old play but I'm not sure I'd let him if he were under maybe 12 or 13? Also depends on maturity level and such. If she plays with you a lot though, I'm sure she'll be ok. Maybe have chat with her first on what to possibly expect and stuff.  :)

There is a house near Camden park, if you at Camden and walk north towards Poseidon, first house on the left, pretty sure there is one in the fridge consistently.

If you block them they can't see you on the map and same goes for your camp if your selling stuff so unless he wanders near by and sees your camp he aint going there anytime soon.

If someone playing WoW discovered an exploit and promptly reported it, and review did not find that they abused the exploit outside the duration of discovery to obtain an unfair advantage, they are not likely to be banned. When players and on the WoW level entire guilds abuse an exploit they all get the ban hammer.
---
The problem with Fallout 76 is they see "exploit used" from whatever their system is and ignore that it was already reported by those players, and documented in the report that they tested the exploit to report during the same times their system says they were using an exploit. Even worse would be if the case is they in fact banned him as a result of the report, and not because they detected him using the exploit before he reported it.
---
I have reported cheaters with video evidence, and I believe the OP stated in previous posts he and the others who reported the exploit and were banned did the same. There is no logical reason to be so cut and dry about banning someone who documented the exploit for reporting and never
---
They supposedly do manual reviews of support tickets but apparently they are unwilling or unable to do anything from the support side. I'm getting deja Vu of when people were having problems with vault raids.  used it unfairly or shared the exploit.
---
I don't want to see the game go free to play. That generally always leads to more trolls and griefing from people who have nothing to lose if the get banned.
---
Lol ok. So you need no proof they did anything wrong yet they're banned by the dev.
---
I can join. I have a few nuclear keycards and I want to farm some flux

So? Given that ZOS went through it years ago, it's extra pathetic, that Bethesda didn't learn from their experience.
---
I agree with you except the single player part. Sone of us have wanted new fallout multiplayer since the days of tactics are long behind us.
---
All those other titles you mentioned were singleplayer and had extensive modding capabilities. Most people had fun un FO3/NV/4 because of all the modding they could do, and you know, more capable people than bethesda staff actually fixing bugs in unofficial patches.  
---
Neither of that is the case with FO76 and it shows.

I do believe it specifically is talked about in Fo4. Your synth companion talks about a guy that holed himself up before the bombs fell and ghoulified himself, and is still in his hidey hole.

Because it *exists* while the Eric Cartman map took it's ball and went home.

It;s not only *much* better it's actually *infinitely* better than a nonexistent map.

Public events.  There's some more unique ones that require multiple players and a main end game one can see 10+ ppl there.

I've had sub 10fps slideshows doing them and that is normal
---
Yes you can buy them at any level
---
Why have you ever felt the need to block someone?
---
They did  learn from their experience tho. They learned that launching a bare bones exploit ridden game early and then developing it slowley over time based on user feedback is a cost effective way to make what is widely regarded as the best MMO ever made.
---
Confirmed
---
Deliberately ignoring my point in order to make yourself feel smart doesn‚Äôt make you smart FYI.
---
A working game would be cool. I took out a single months subscription for fallout first (I know, I know) to see if the game runs better for a solo player and it's still laggy as hell, wrong level enemies spawning (I'm 132 and getting level 5 super mutants and level 1 mole rats) and graphic glitches that makes the whole wasteland disappear.

I am one of the top 10/Tier 1 players in NW on Xbox. I have taught other player, both young and old, how to hold their own in a firefight, to the point that they are now sought-after players by Tier 1 and Tier 2 groups, which has allowed them to level up rapidly.

The health not decreasing would be ghoulish. I don't personally use ghoulish but I believe you out heal the first Strom or two and can stay in it until radiation kills you. The final storms will kill you just a little slower.

The radiation perk would help to. It's like q permanent rad-x.

I can't think of other perks at the moment. But additional rad-x, hazmat, and Power amour would help greatly with the rads. The bigger problem is the health dmg. stims can take you pretty far if you have a bunch.

Infinite ammo guns are already in the game since day one. It has its own prefix like instigating or bloodied.

Good to know!  And yeah... happens t me too once in a while on the PC :(
---
Yes this needs to be fixed as its not fair if only PC can do so show some love to Xbox and PS4! 
---
Now being serious, question since as most of the game data is stored within Bethesdas Servers why can't they just run a script deleting known duped items like ones only available from Dev Room and checking who actually acquired Fashnact event masks as last I checked a few thousand did drop during the limited runs of the missions. If players know duped items will be deleted they will think twice of wasting caps for it and heck give a unique ID based on players seed so they can use it to try and locate the ones doing the duping aka if 5 of the guns that are being duped came from one guy maybe check what hes been doing.
---
Calling someone an idiot based on a random offhanded comment? There may as well be no anti cheat with how effective it is

Sorry, never fun.

Known Bug, Bethesda is aware.     
---
Also have it documented here:  [Fallout 76 Bug Roundup | Character - General](https://www.reddit.com/r/76BugWiki/comments/dlomli/fallout_76_bug_roundup_character_general/)
---
Hm. There's a lot here that I somewhat agree with. But j also can't ever say that this is a 'good' game due to the egregious monetization.
---
And I wouldn't really even say this was a BGS game. Yes, they're name is on it, but it was mostly a new studio from what we now know.
---
Low effort memes and image dumps can die a fiery death.  Kudos for rule #3.  Wish more subs would adopt it.
---
This was patched in a recent update. There was a quest giving out the NW variant of the scoped laser rifle by mistake.
---
Most other NW items are meant to appear in Adventure.
---
I have these same stats expect on a combat shotgun. Does the instigating penality apply to it also?
---
Same thing I think. Other players almost never effect my game unless it's during events, but most events aren't supposed to be solo. Also I keep seeing FO1st players so tell me private sessions aren't that important to them
---
Isnt that the point? They were banned for using exploits, but they were using them to verify bugs for reporting to the devs?
---
Gatling gun- 5mm
---
Mingun- 5mm
---
50 cal- 50 cal
---
Mg42- 308
---
Gatling laser- fusion cores 
---
Plasma gatling- plasma cores
---
Harpoon gun- harpoons
---
Broadsider - cannonballs 
---
Fatman- mini nukes
---
Missle launcher - missiles
---
Auto grenade launcher - 40mm grenades 
---
The gatling gun and laser gatling are probably the best choice ammo wise, since 5mm is cheap to craft , easy to find in bulk and fusion cores are very easy to find . Damage wise a a gatling gun is the best , and fire rate wise an mg42 is the best, and if you just want to look like a badass use an mg42 or 50 cal üòÇ

even though the light is not lit or animated i think the function is still operating. i can only say this anecdotally but at one camp i had it appeared to function properly as a turret that was placed a bit away from it still managed to see and shoot enemies at night.

This is my bloodied heavy gunner, she's got a lot of utility mixed in, but a 1 star bloodied .50mg starts around 400 damage for me so I don't need to min max. 
---
Not quite as powerful as my bloodied sneak rifle man, or bloodied unarmed. But she is by far the most survivable, t51 with emergency protocols and nerd rage active has stats as follows 
---
Dr 546
---
Er 606
---
Rr 310
---
Could still solo the queen if necessary at the expense of ammo. But my favorite part is she carries 9 bloodied heavy guns, a 2 shot fatman, a 2 shot missile launcher, 100's of missiles, 50 mini nukes, and thousands of everything else pretty much.  
---
Weight can be an issue with all that stuff, but
---
 I usually sit around 320/370 in power armor.
---
 If you go with bloodied you can do good damage and still have room for utility, thats kinda of the benefit of heavy builds, theres no use for sneak or vats perks, so you have decent wiggle room to really personalize it.
---
That's pretty interesting.
---
I know Fallout 76 delves into the idea of atomic mining to generate rare materials.  The radiation caused by those underground detonations is part of what led to the things being the way they are.
---
Gun runner or the one for melee. You can easily find a melee and it makes you run a lot faster. That's the one I can think of off hand
---
They did the same thing in fallout 4, they have never worked properly.

So start a subreddit and have people post there and let us know how it goes.  It probably won't turn out like you think it will.
---
So would that list include 90% of current players?
---
Troubling to hear this is so widespread, but also glad I‚Äôm not the only one. Hopefully Bethesda is aware and will fix it soon. Never had this issue before, but it‚Äôs happened about a half a dozen times today alone. Quite frustrating.
---
I don't get the point of this. You can already move your points around. You can already plan ahead. After you get to a certain level, you'll have more cards that you can handle, and more respect points than you'll ever need.
---
Great answer. Thanks for quality content.
---
Not everyone builds their camp in a secluded corner of the map. Some build near Whitesprings and I'm one of them.
---
It‚Äôs comments like this that make me want to destroy every item I‚Äôve accrued including my BE15 GP legacy if I ever do quit the game. It‚Äôs a circle jerk joke and it‚Äôs such low hanging fruit
---
I think I agree with you, but I‚Äôm pretty sure I no longer understand the argument being presented.  You want bloody builds to be good, but not a skeleton key for every problem?  
---
I think that‚Äôs fair, but I‚Äôd be extremely careful in asking for it.  Most game developers tend to be ham-fisted with nerfs, and 76 really can‚Äôt afford to lose one of the few things that works great, at least not right now.  If shotguns are an indication of carefully considered balance adjustment......yikes.
---
As far as I know, ghouls in the Fallout universe are not cartoon lepers that accidentally lose limbs.  They serve as competent companions, bodyguards, antagonists, raider scum and anything a normal human would do, just with less nose, hair and smooth vocal stylings.  As far as frail constitution, Hancock probably took enough drugs during our year out of the vault to overdose every raider in Boston.  The NCR doesn‚Äôt seem to have an issue recruiting ghouls as rangers, either.  If anything, being an intelligent ghoul is an improvement.
---
Mirror ball plans sell for a lot
---
At least I'm not the only one lol. Done so many stopped getting prime receivers months ago and have had almost every other ultracite mod plan several times. No shocks.
---
Funny how many people have commented it should drop 1st time event is completed...
---
Anything else I should look for?
---
the disco ball plan is still rare enough, bought them during meat week, sold them all quick.
---
Yes, especially if you have class freak. Small drop in overall health and either a nice boost if you‚Äôre bloodied or a useful boost if things go south for an otherwise healthy player. My full health commando has it cause not everything goes to plan. Which happens
---
if you‚Äôre having trouble seeing things in the game then it sounds like your tv/monitor is shot or you simply have trouble seeing.
---
He has pretty much the same things as always. But he doesn't always have everything. When I see him I look for Mirror ball plans, radiation emitter plans, and TV plans for resale, because he rarely has them.
---
Tv plans can‚Äôt be purchased elsewhere?
---
45mins for running through the silo or you counting all the lost resources you wasted on it such as stims and ammo? Checking since if I include the farming time for said resources its more then a few hours.
---
Says the guy playing one of the ugliest and worst games of all time.
---
Marquee arrows and the metal picnic table.
---
Alright so we'll just ignore how the bit about how Bethesda was in fact randomly banning people. go start insulting people about their irl just like every other keyboard warrior who can't make a point.
---
I can't be bothered getting into a drawn out argument with you anymore, but have a good watch of this video.
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjyeCdd-dl8&amp;t=2s
---
There's a reason this video got mainstream as fuck and that's because it highlights everything Bethesda did wrong before the most recent 12 month subscription debacle. Nothing wrong with liking a game, but objectively 76 is garbage. Sorry if it hurts your feelings nerd.
---
Not at all mr dismissive. It‚Äôs a toxic game full of toxic players and toxic addicted company shills who wallow in their idealistic dreams of fixes and updates.  But go ahead and dismiss that too scorched.
---
Played NW lately? Having a price to join the game rarely even slows hackers down. The two issues are largely unrelated.
---
r/justbootthings
---
They probably can, I don't know. I just check for them üòÇ
---
Thank you all for your submissions! I CANT CHOOSE. So,
---
If you're on PS4, pick a number 1-100, and reply to your submission. The closest to my number wins (quickest reply wins in case of multiple correct amswers).  Also, if you can explain what my number means (hint: Nukashine) you also win a 3* Suppressor's Handemade rw + Vats crits 50
---
While Bethesda ponders this over, here's some helpful info in the meantime: You can use the triggers and bumper buttons on Xbox and PS4 to make larger jumps on the slider, then youse the analog sticks or D-pad to make precision adjustments. Most players don't know about this and try to use the precision option to make huge leaps. PC probably has a comparable set of keys for this. All that being said, a keypad would make much more sense.
---
apologies. Through the silo. I had no idea what I was doing and only 1 fusion core and limited ammo. I've seen guys solo it in like 10m lol. They are like I'm going to go launch a nuke brb.
---
They blocked other players because they didn't know if they were brotherhood of steel members as well
---
Doesnt make you less wrong. Either think before you say something or accept that people will label you as an idiot when you dont.
---
Children of Atom are just Bloodied builds gone cultist.  (pfft, as if they weren't already...)
---
Lag isn't as bad but still needs work and if you using Xbox X frames are consistent but that excluding during combat where it drops because of the horrid coding they did to add multiplayer to this game.
---
It is an essential mutation for any build üëçüèª
---
This seems fair to me.
---
I'm on right now about to run Alpha for the first time.
---
I've gotten overwhelmed and confused by the quests and leveling. I kind of just forgot about my account. I am level 25 and I don't really know what to do.
---
Yeah, ii reckon at least one of them should have been a knight.
---
My son is 9 and he has always been better than me at NW- I‚Äôm now level 71 but it took me a long time to enjoy this game. He is literally the reason why I‚Äôve gotten better
---
Rad-X lasts for 3 minutes. That's often what you are seeing if it's just a dude in Marine Armor running around in a nuke zone (particularly last few minutes of the match). Some of the guys who fish for nukes in the fire (right at beginning of match) run Ghoulish and Rad Resist (and Hacker and Briefcase detector).
---
Couldnt agree more. The fact that shame or shaming is being removed from our society is a big god damned problem. We absolutely should be allowed to make who they are known so no one will game with them and ridicule them so they change their behavior.
---
seems your feelings are hurt because others don‚Äôt just agree with what you say. the game is not objectively garbage, its just become such a meme that everyone jumps on that wagon. I don‚Äôt think we are gonna come to an agreement so, probably no point in preceding  with this conversation. you‚Äôre just frankly not worth the time. stay out of the wasteland please in the future and take all your cry baby friends with you, thanks.
---
Yup. Viruses are also used to introduce new DNA into plants that's what gmos are
---
Imagine being so insecure in your own convictions you have to delude yourself into believing that anyone who doesn‚Äôt agree with you must be hired advertisement. What a horrible, lonely existence...
---
I don't think they care about their game lmao.
---
I agree. But the people with a 15 year old plasma can't see anything apparently, so we get eternal 6pm.
---
My Rocks and Sticks don't run the game too well and might need to upgrade to a piece of paper and pencil.
---
They removed a couple songs - swing on a star, tumbling tumbleweeds, ghost riders, i have no idea whu because those songs are much better than fucking maybe, or aint nobodies fault but mine
---
They crave the attention their parents never gave them
---
Legacy weapons are guns you can‚Äôt get as Bethesda patched them out of the spawn lists for example energy weapons  like the flamer and plasma gatling that deal explosive damage
---
A sampling:
---
1. Someone who started off friendly, but then began stalking a regular teammate. He also just creeped on women in general. And to boot, his bad connection seemed to cause lag in big events. Easy decision.
---
2. I've encountered quite a few people who would go on adventure servers and harass people at events, trying to PvP. Ex.all the mobs are gone, and they chase you around trying to melee.
---
3. One special case of the previous was a guy who died a few times at scorched earth because he didn't have pacifist on. He blamed a rando at the event, tried to fight them, died repeatedly, then called them a n____r, and spouted some nonsense about Bernie Sanders. He was over lvl 100, so he had to know game mechanics. Later saw him harassing some folks I play with. I'd already blocked him, but he had a couple people backing him up. Killed them too.
---
4. I'm blocking non-noobs who knowingly build camps in douchey places.
---
5. I decided to level up a low level alt, and while I was struggling to fight a high level yao guai outside my camp, some couch wanders in, sees this, and just sits in my camp criticising it, complaining that noobs are ruining the game, and he wished that destroying camps was still allowed. He was half the level of my main character. He got blocked.
---
Does this give some idea?
---
If people have less to lose they are even more likely to do it. That's why all the dupers now use stolen accounts.
---
I have a subscription so this wouldn't really change anything for me. And to hear the anti-Fallout1st crowd tell it, everything should include all the features.
---
I know someone's going to be unhappy no matter what they do. I'm proposing this from the vantage point that the box copies of Fallout 76 have likely sold as many as they're going to sell. Having the base game free and then having a subscription for an enhanced version of the game creates a recurring revenue stream - which is needed to justify the recurring expense of the server rental from Amazon. To be honest, they should have never released this game using the pay once model for exactly this reason.
---
Characterizing people who don't agree with you is highly myopic at best.
---
It can be sold, yes. I just crafted mods on a friend's Strangler armor, which he had purchased from another player. We were able to exchange it back and forth without any issues.
---
What do you mean by that?
---
They always say "missing features" but never explain it.
---
Thanks for the info!
---
I‚Äôll be sure to pick it up along the way.
---
Actually yes. Shame and shaming is the only thing that will actually get humans to change their behavior. If we make it known they are cheaters people wont game with them which incites them to change their behavior and also if everyone rips them apart for their cheating it will eventually make them change. It's actually pretty basic psychology. You cant do one without the other though. There has to be real consequences and constant application of shame though.
---
maybe you need to learn how to read, you're clearly saying the only cheaters are the ones who are shooting into the sky.
---
Which indicates you're either a terrible pvp'er or have never actually tried NW
---
The problem with that is the legendarys you want are hard to get and all the best builds were muffed to hell and back
---
I would probably put it up on the vending machine in the hopes of getting funding for a better hunting rifle/lever rifle.
---
Fallout 76 isn't available for Xbox 360, and if you're playing it on one it's a bootleg.
---
The game does not seem to be improving from an optimization and bug cleaning standpoint. It gets progressively worse every update with more things breaking, and worse monetization added.
---
Sorry, but you're gonna be stuck with the frame rate issues pretty much for the rest of the games lifespan.  I really don't see them being able to fix the core issues without a new engine.
---
So you've never played at all (except maybe during the summer FTP week). Ok, whatever. Since you aren't paying, who cares what you think. Mods, can we get a ban over here? I, for one, am getting sick of people who don't play this game offering ignorant ass opinions like this.
---
Wow so many wussies on this one. Methinks its because they are actually some of the cheaters we speak of that has them protesting so hard on this one. Shame is good and light doxing isnt bad when it's used against shitty cheaters.
---
Upgrade to a Commodore64 and watch those frame rates soar!
---
I still get 1 hit by ghouls and I run uny sent armor and dodgy/serendipity/blocker. I think the down side is pretty hars as is. If it was that perfect everyone would run it. People get mad bc bloodies can hit so hard but they still are super soft. If they're tanking it's due to thier ass/sent armor which is still good on any build.
---
its a must  have for bloodied.
---
It works really well for other builds as well, especially if you use class freak.  
---
I dont know how I played without it.
---
Xbox here, if you need help with anything at all gimme a message bud! I'm on most nights.
---
Because when games are F2P the gloves come off for monetization. Get ready for ludicrous grind, timers, weapons, armor, loot boxes‚Äîyou name it, it‚Äôll be there in a F2P version of this game. Just look at what they did with Elder Scrolls Blades.
---
Yes, thank you.
---
See where do you kinda players be lmaooo üòÇ meanwhile I‚Äôm getting pistol whipped by a glitching ghoul, a mutant rat is biting my ankle, and there‚Äôs a swarm of what I assume is glowing bees approaching me smh
---
With no one around to help lmaooo
---
Grug buy rock game , rock game slow, money man say to grug "it just work"
---
Mmhmm, the Australian government having to force Bethesda to give refunds isn't indicative of how many refund requests they were getting at all. Good games need to close the refund option too amirite?
---
Avoid the video Chad, if you don't watch it, it can't hurt you.
---
Bethesda needs to learn how to ban.  Rather than announce to them they are banned, just make them miserable. Route them all to one server where they can cheat on each other and leave the rest of us in peace.
---
Ah Bethesda and there orthotic excuses for there PS ports of games being buggier than both bone and pc combined
---
Im gonna use the codename chickenblinds as a guess?
---
Add me on XBox. GT: Frawger. I don't play much anymore but I'd be more than happy to make you some good weapons, armor and ammo, and help you complete some missions
---
I‚Äôve noticed. Lmaoo this super mutant blew me back with one shot even tho I shot him like 5 times fml üòÇüòÇ
---
I've never seen black powder weapons as anything other than a novelty.  The reload is so amazingly slow that it makes the damage irrelevant - another weapon will get the job done more efficiently.  
---
All that said if you have no other good weapons and this is your best option have fun with it.  Eventually you'll get something better and that gun will wind up in the wood chipper or maybe hung up on the wall for posterity.
---
Thanks for the link vault fam üôèüèΩ
---
They increased the brightness/radius of the PA headlamp and the pip boy, which would have been enough. But then they also brightened the entire game. Interestingly, night is darker in Outer Worlds and I don't hear any complaints on those forums.
---
Played over 400 hours.
---
Adrenal Reaction is kind of an objective good.  Obviously, it shines the most with a Bloodied build, but even if you aren't Bloodied, the fact that it's going to give you extra damage to kill things before they finish you off is a nice thing to have.
---
Neither was Elder Maxson at this point, but that didn't stop OP lol
---
&gt; InDefinitely disagree with the heavy gun loot options they shouldn‚Äôt add any of those heavy guns to any other box but a Orange Crate or terminal/Safe.
---
Why do you oppose adding more heavy guns? I'm personally an auto rifle user and I'd like to see all other weapons classes be as viable as auto rifles. 
---
I see no reason to run heavy gun perks when the chances of obtaining a heavy gun is significantly lower than the chances of obtaining an auto rifle.
---
Valve did none of that with Team Fortress 2.  EA had the gloves off on monetization from day 1 with Star Wars Battlefront II. The severity of the micro-transactions has little to do with whether it's F2P and more to do with the company running the show.
---
Welcome to fo76
---
Well idk about government agencies but i do know some companies do hire former hackers
---
I would say swap four leaf clover for critical savy since it is more consistent in getting your crits.
---
They made a sub for fo76 memes I think. It‚Äôs probably dead but idk
---
Their origins are well known. The cult started in Megaton around the time of Fallout 3 - over 100 years after Fallout 76
---
In F1/2 radiation was major danger. With bloodbuilds we have a situation where radiation is convenience tool. It's ridiculous. I agree with the notion that so far the history of the balance changes done to this game was terrible. 
---
While being competent and resilient, the ghouls are rather frail in every previous Fallout entry. In F2 only those in best shape were capable of running.
---
Radiation makes pieces of you fall of. If you learned to find strength in that, that's totally Fallout, but lack of the consequences is not - at least for me.
---
But yeah, considering the history of previous changes I see where your caution comes from and I can't say it's not wise.
---
[Someone already answered this for you.](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/bugcmy/i_made_a_list_on_how_to_get_all_the_mounted_head/?st=k2ur52l9&amp;sh=7bbae392)

You can also block users if they express different opinions than your opinion bubble. Boo hop I don‚Äôt like something someone says about something I like so bam them! Freedom of speech here in good ol ‚ÄòMercia üíè

Not with shotgun and without super high luck, critical savvy will give me crit every 3/4th shout four leaf clover almost every second shot

Yeh I feel you and that song üòÇüòÇ
---
Yeh it‚Äôs still on the radio and it must certainly does need love
---
Graham has the nuka and cuckoo clocks too.
---
r/riderjohnson ;)
---
Exactly!
---
I agree higher player count would be better for an mmo style game but the game clearly cannot handle it (as a developer I understand how hard it can be to do). I felt the coop vibe was the most fun I had in the game, but there are long streches you see no one (also fine) and then you meet someone and they basically say go away. Also fine I do mot want to impose on others and I enjoy solitude and reading all the notes and terminals myself at my own pace sometimes.
---
As a coop they may have been able to launch at the same point (admit it they release half baked and it just got worst in the early months) and have a stable game, maybe smaller since some time would have gone towards content and story but they could always have left the world a little smaller and expanded it over time.
---
Monetization wise I would have been fine paying for expansion areas. I wish they kept the cosmetic policy but I could even live without that. It was the rebalance toward grind that offended me, they did not want players able to earn in game (the bane of all microtrandaction games) and damaged the gameplay to slow it down.
---
Even with their plan if they just made the skins closer to a dollar then ten dollars I probably would have bought a bundle. I dropped a small bundle on Fallout Shelter just because I enjoyed the game and the price per unit was only slightly silly but fully optional.
---
As a coop game they can release passes or dlc like usual and make a small fortune, as this survival mmo with microtrandactions gimmicks they were hoping for another FIFA but they got a relative dud instead. Keep in mind skyrim, fallout 3/4, new vegas, and dlc were all huge earners for them. This one has given their owners the jitters because they followed a bad pack which are getting pushback from players (battlefront 2, madden, etc).
---
Hell yeah bro I could use the guns and armor and ammo. But mainly I wanna see how these crafting elements work and what not. There‚Äôs a couple of other aspects of the game I have questions about as well such as the camp, The battle royal mode, diseases, food ect. 
---
I‚Äôll for sure add you when I hop on later today
---
It says they helped settle and build Megaton, they didn't start there.
---
Oh thats lame
---
Lmao that‚Äôs very.... different to say the least.
---
I forgot that Bethesda only adds free items to BR nowadays.
---
My Ouya runs this in 4k 60fps strange youre having problems
---
Wow i thought the memes were funny but fuck me i guess
---
Then you'll probably get bored again. Not that much has changed.
---
Is it regular that you are one-shot by ghouls with uny/sent +dodge/sere/blocker?
---
It's different topic, I'm tracking a bug. Sometimes after I load to game it feels like my equipment didn't. Like I get one-shot by ghouls three times then on fourth time I can tank lots of shots easy, like it was my gear failing to load.
---
Is this a rule for your character? Or is it something that happens "sometimes"? If "sometimes", were those times shortly after loading up?
---
&gt; I don‚Äôt believe they should remove the 44. Or Single Action they just need to Add armor penetration to make them more useful.
---
Having both a .44 and Single Action is completely unnecessary. The three revolvers have the worst body shot ttk in the game. They're worse than all of the pipe weapons even if you add armor penetration. Replacing one of them(or the pipe guns) with an auto 10mm or Plasma pistol would put pistol builds closer to the viability of auto rifles.
---
Keep in mind they cannot handle 24 people so they will never be able to handle 200. I feel with a higher player count and NPCs plot Fallout 76 would have been fine too, but they dropped both of those and ended up with a bad game.
---
Sometimes you play to your strengths and release something decent and protect your brand. Will someone some day release a mmo like our dreams, certainly, but until that day a good coop game you could opt to play solo not only sells units but builds up the fan base loyalty.
---
I bought my plans at White Springs at level 60 or so.
---
Ain‚Äôt nothing free fam. You know how much candy I‚Äôve had to give him to get him to keep grinding that xp?
---
Nuclear winter is pretty much the last thing keeping me playing. 76 has a real endgame problem. I'm level 300, still never got the gun i wanted, or any of the armour pieces. I have no way to work towards them, outside of purveyor pulls. Odds are like 1/300,000 on the gun, 1/500,000 on the armour.
---
RIP me I'm lvl 104 &amp; stopped playing because I got all the rewards, including all the limited time rewards
---
Another glitch taken from Fallout 4, baby.
---
My my looks as tho outer world struck a few people the wrong way. Yes YES get angrey you fools.
---
Just wanted to add that rad x stacks in NW so you can pop three at a time and be golden in any situation taking almost no rads
---
This guy is either a Bethesda shill or runs FO76Map.  Hell maybe both.
---
Not really. Would you rather spend atoms to get 1 item or the right to make as many as you want?  
---
Unlocking it in the Atom Shop also unlocks it on all of your characters so any of them can craft it too.
---
&gt;Your section on Melee is a good take on the damage resistants part. But the bear arms and tenderizer part doesn‚Äôt make sense to me I don‚Äôt understand what you are trying to say seeing that tenderizer already exists in the list of cards. Bear Arms is a weight reduction perk And that only applies to heavy guns?? so just use Walking arsenal which applies to every weapon. Martial Artist will reduce weight of Melee weapons. Also increases your swing speed.
---
Bear Arm and The Tenderizer are strong melee weapons added into adventure mode.
---
I run both those and dodgy. It doesn't stop me from getting one hit by ghouls and getting killed repeatedly in events. No cards makes a bloody build close to tanky. Ass/sent cav/sent armor might do it but that's on any build and bloody should get nerfed bc of op armor.
---
Yeah outer worlds is good im loving it so far
---
I‚Äôd rather see someone posting videos of themselves destroying their gear, deleting their characters. Then I‚Äôd believe they are quitting and truly done with the game.
---
We did it, Reddit!" - Reddit celebrating after identifying the wrong person at the Boston Marathon bombing
---
Yeah
---
Its irrelevant whether there is technically an anticheat or not. Just the fact that you are hung up on this one fact is communicating to me that you are the actual idiot in this conversation and here is why:
---
It doesn‚Äôt matter whether there or isn‚Äôt an anti cheat because its absolute garbage - you literally posted a video on how to get caught by the anti cheat is there a a video like that on youtube it isn‚Äôt going to be hard to bypass, that is confirmed by my anecdotal experience of seeing cheating in NW also by seeing videos of cheating and also seeing this post of other people saying that there are cheaters. Unless you want to start a research paper (which you can‚Äôt due to your increasingly obvious low intelligence) that is the closest you are going to get non anecdotal evidence. My original comment is jumping on the bandwagon but there is nothing inherently wrong with jumping on the bandwagon if the cause is right and it is supported by the truth so my comment supports spreading awareness of the fact that this anti cheat is shit. The fact you think that jumping on the bandwagon is bad is literally moronic...
---
My kid is gonna wreck you my dude watch out. Lol
---
No but I also don‚Äôt use them. I also saw numerous requests for them from others. So clearly their voices were heard.
---
If you do come back, your PA will probably be separated from its frame, in your stash.  That's just a thing that happened.
---
Um, no?
---
There is a place for memes and jokes, and the people running this sub would rather use this it for more serious discussions.
---
This isn't at all unusual on Reddit, there are plenty of subs that want to keep the content informative. And the sub 'owners' get to decide how they want things run, so your options are to find someplace where that content is more appropriate, or create your own.
---
The conduits in FO4 worked pretty good, but with all of the restrictions in '76 they've become a huge pain in the ass. I spent way too much time the other night running conduit from an upper floor to a lower floor, snaps green and says that the 'item needs support' - so GD frustrating.
---
He said it twice and glossed over me asking to elaborate. I hope to get a response.
---
It‚Äôs like to have a friend only item list. I have a lot of items I‚Äôd like to sell to friends only for cheap
---
I have been farming the pleasant cemetery. Unlock the 3* safes. If the plan is not in it then take nothing from it. Check all 4 safes there. Server hop and try again. If you take from the safe it will be empty when you server hop.
---
If you can't get anything already in them to show then you gotta take from 180 other stashes like suitcases lockers cabinets and safes. Once they are available just don't take anything until it is the gauntlet plan.
---
I say all of this because I have been trying to get it for about 3 weeks. I have not found one selling nor has rng been good to me lol.
---
I've been doing that too. I have all of the hats but only brown, green, blue, pink, and white uniforms.
---
Need yellow, Forrest, and red to complete the set.
---
I'm not holding my breath on it being a quest reward. It's a high demand item, kind of like the ranger armor is. Since the ranger armor is First, I'm expecting the stealth armor to also be First or at the very least atom shop if it comes too.
---
After the first time this happened to me I made it a habit of taking a photo of the recent players list prior to launching. Unless the entire server crashes I can usually find someone on that list to rejoin.
---
Easy there young man, my experience &amp; strategy still beats exuberance and reflexes most of the time, at 58 I'm still a force to be reckoned with on the field of battle.
---
Apt enough.
---
I'm on usually around 8 to 11pm every night. I have some low level stuff from my 2nd character and can pass you plans and dope also.

---
Just wondering, what do you consider a douchey place to build your camp in?
---
Bethesda is most interested in what makes them money. Fixing things is a secondary concern. If they actually improved the game and got rid of a lot of the cheaters a lot more people would be inclined to buy fallout 1st or come back and play but that requires more time per dollar made on Bethesda's part.
---
No, F2P is always terrible. The there‚Äôs an easy compromise that they should‚Äôve implemented weeks ago: 
---
1. Scrapbox becomes available for everyone.
---
2. Introduce a ‚ÄúCommunity Requests‚Äù section to the Atomic Shop featuring community requested novelty items‚ÄîFridge, Collectron, Survival Tent, recipes for repair and scrap kits‚Äîall priced moderately. Promise that any other similar items in the future will be available there as one time purchases with Atoms, not locked behind a subscription. (Current FO1st members would keep their Survival Tents)
---
3. Make Private Worlds Private. Provide admin tools‚Äîtoggles for PvP rules, ability to invite/kick users, etc. Provide a roadmap for future enhancements‚Äîlarger CAMPs, persistence, etc. 
---
4. To add some more value back to FO1st, to make up for the utilities being removed‚Äîand likely generate more revenue anyway‚Äîapply an automatic 10-20% discount on Atomic Shop purchases for members and/or increase the amount of Atoms included. Commit to providing a few free exclusive cosmetics every month for subs. 
---
5. Recommit to cosmetics/novelties only in Atomic Shop. Remove existing consumables (replaced by one time purchase recipes). Apologize for going too far with this nonsense.
---
Upvote bc your name is awesome.
---
I tried to fill a trader niche but the game was balanced poorly for it and still probably is to some extent. Crafting is suprisingly weak compared to legendary farming. And workshops were exploited as involuntary pvp zones (and were triple nerfed in productivity to boot making scavenging more appealing).
---
This is less the bugs in the game than the rebalance towards microtransaction grind in my opinion which was evident after the first month and kept getting worse.
---
If they were serious about the current format they should have gone deeper into the rebuild the wastelanders  theme, design quests and workshops to add permanence to the game and encourage cooperation without forcing it. Balance the loot and crafting so workshop ownership is valuable, and player specialization and gear creation is the highest tier of loot in the game.
---
Make vendors available at release or develop a true barter screen that does not crash (steal the one from fallout 3 if you must it was functional if not great).
---
I haven't paid it that close attention but I survive not getting hit. I've felt I could soak dmg. If I run the club at whitesprings sometimes I'll get 1 hit 4 or 5 times clearing it but I don't just stand still so sent isn't usually working. My point is it's the armor that makes some bloody players tanky. It has nothing to do with the build.
---
The point you are focusing on is a point you are ignorant about, maybe thats why your confused. Let me shed some light as briefly as possible.
---
Private worlds are not about single-player, its about modders fixing a game thats broken one year after launch and now these mods are behind a paywall.
---
The game is still fun
---
Lots of ‚Äúemotions‚Äù in this community
---
**FWIW I think you do great work with the roundups, investigations, and the constant monitoring of the changes to the various ESP/ESM. I won't deny you your due-credit there it's hard-earned and well-deserved.**
---
I actually am curious to hear your opinion on this part because TBH when I first saw the OG post -  I feared it would make life way harder for you and the others and perhaps earn you scorn from the actual dev team because of reckless actions of others around you.
---
As other's have noted the map in-question was good perhaps better then the competition - however gotta note - it has competition and isn't the only 'player' in that game. *I'm sure IGN is loving all the new traffic they are getting now it's gone.* 
---
**From a distance -** It's seems eyebrow raising that there was a singular member (?) of the 'outside testing group' who decided to take the nuclear approach after 2-3 weeks *(which - can't condone it - but unfortunately in a lot of businesses / CS teams is how long your tickets can languish for 'just because' or 'self-infliction').*
---
*Perhaps I'm wrong in that timeline - this is all based off of the og post in question - I will not claim I was partial to anything more.*
---
**I fear for anyone trying to 'do good' with CE that doesn't have it in cold hard writing that their {test-username-here} isn't explicitly whitelisted internally.** 
---
Why? It seems - again from a distance - like *(for BGS)* a bit of a nightmare dev-communication scenario growing here. Having a discord of numerable well-intentioned people actively finding and using exploits could be helpful if managed incredibly well. Unmanaged - it seems like ticket / timeline / stepping-on-each-other's-toes hell. 
---
**The big questions I think a lot of us who work around development teams have with certain people being allowed to use CS:**
---
1. **How can you gatekeep the noble actors from the bad or at least self-interested?** *which flows into #2*
---
2. **How do you ensure successful &amp; trusted whitelisting?** *I'm sure that you and a few others have time and time again proven your ability - but has everyone or did some get in on grease?*
---
3. **How do you manage reviewing?** *reviewing logs and then manually unblocking all of the 'new names' that could arise?*
---
4. **How can you tell intentions from a distance?** *that someone is using CE to fix things and not to find new ways to get around the Anti-Cheat-Agent?*
---
Obviously there are star players like yourself where it's clear what your trying to do - but if everyone who can mod just joins a discord expecting to be whitelisted and then starts jumping into CE and hammering at the CK walls - it seems like a rapid downward spiral that will be hard to fix long-term.
---
*If you were explicitly whitelisted by all means disregard this please - but - if the creator of that map tool never was explicitly told they were whitelisted: that's seems ultra-risky for them to flying so close to the anti-cheat sun.* 
---
Anyways - I hope this doesn't make your life more difficult then it has to be and doesn't burn your bridges with the actual dev team or their handlers. Lord ZAX knows - your pretty much the 'account' we need to hold them to
---
LPT: If an item has a lightning bolt icon and a number (eg: ‚ö° 3) that means it needs to be wired to a generator or powered connector, and will draw 3 units of power. If it just has a lightning bolt (like most generic lights) it simply needs to be within ~2 tiles of a power connector.
---
I just checked a few days ago to see if I could make them. And I decided the plan must not exist cause I don't have it. ü§î
---
I read somewhere here on reddit about that drop location for the gauntlet, and found it on my first attempt there.
---
Not sure if it's the only location, but I haven't seen anywhere else listed when I was searching.
---
Team fortress 2 came out like 13 years ago, the market has changed a lot since then
---
https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Plan:_Deathclaw_gauntlet
---
There are use cases for most legendary attributes. For example, let's say a player has a low-Perception build. Stalker's would help offset the loss of accuracy. I could see a sneak build with high Agility and Luck taking advantage of this, off the top of my head.
---
With the Day/Night cycle being what it is in the game, however, Nocturnal seems more of a role-playing niche item for some deadly night stalker... For me, Nocturnal is always an item destined for the "Wood Chipper" (aka the Scrip Machine)
---
Oooh yeah, that's gonna end well. Know how many times I was accused of duping, cheating, etc just cause I declined crappy trade offers?
---
Lol you payed $100 huh? Idgaf about that. The point of the post was to let people know I want some help in the game and compared it to being single player because I‚Äôm alone. The only way to be ‚Äúalone‚Äù in the game is FO1st. But I guess that went over your head ü§∑üèæ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èü§∑üèæ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èü§∑üèæ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è oh well
---
Real men?
---
But you're dredging up the exact arguments used against TF2 going F2P so unless you care to drop your outdated arguments...
---
&gt;People DO understand that cheaters use cheat engines and the guy was NEVER sanctioned by Bethesda to do any of what he did.
---
Almost nothing would exist mod wise, if we waited for sanctions before acting, infact with most companies, as long as you are not violating their IP asking is the worst thing you can do, because the default answer in almost every case is no.  
---
It's easy to take a high and mighty stance, but this is a much more nuanced issue then you seem to grasp.
---
&gt;That's kind of BS - FO76MAP was a MUCH better overall product and it's  all irrelevant anyway because the other guy never cared about the  community and decided to punish it when Bethesda sanctioned him.   He  took his little ball, mad e a mad face and stomped off home.
---
Again you're failing to grasp the subtleties of the situation, yes he went on Strike, and put up a strongly worded post, but we've been fighting an uphill battle the entire time since launch, between a "troll" filled community and Bethesda that often won't acknowledge things, it's tough.
---
He lost his temper, which is understandable, **but someone would not put that much time into a tool for the community if he didn't care about it**.
---
It's easy to judge, but you spend the amount of time some like Eck, he or I have, investing in the Community / Game, with the understand people in Bethesda KNOW what tools we are using to make it happen, and then get suspended without a single reply from Bethesda in two weeks, after buying Fallout1st, and see how you react.
---
It's not broken some armor can make any build seem tanky but bloody doesn't benifit any more from it. Running the silo isn't a big challenge for any high level with good equipment. I survive it by one hitting enemies and using cover not tanking dmg.
---
If it‚Äôs an atomic shop item I think it might be just an under armour with a separate helmet, otherwise a full outfit that does nothing else however I could be wrong and they might release it with full stealth functionality, but hopefully if they do the latter it‚Äôs a sidequest reward with skins in the atom shop as a compromise
---
I really like Mosstown. It's a densely packed little area with lots of nooks and crannys, and a decent assortment of junk, chems, and food.
---
Anything Instigating + Explosive has the same problem, except maybe if it did AoE damage naturally, so that you'd wipe out the whole group of mobs with the first hit. Otherwise there is always a good chance that the AoE from Explosive will hit a few surrounding mobs, and Instigating only gives double damage when the mob's HP is full.
---
Also, I find that Explosive on a shotgun is dangerous to yourself unless you're running the Dense armor mod - the explosive part of the damage can splash hit yourself if the mob is close enough, and seeing as shotguns are more or less short range weapons, they are particularly dangerous in that regard. (Although I admit that I've almost killed myself often enough with my Explosive gatling gun in the chaos of an SBQ fight, too...)
---
Frankly, I'm not a huge fan of the Explosive property, although it is reasonably good when combined with Two Shot if you can deal with the accuracy and durability penalties that combo entails.
---
It's a PS4 - I'd call that a hardware issue ;)
---
General info question do all Chems stack on NW?
---
Yep, you have to take a lot. I never had an addiction until I started playing a character who liked to do everything under the affluence of inkahol....
---
In NW it works as intended. Had a group of 4 searching for me, even touching me (not in the wrong way), but they never saw me beside them.
---
I game while my son falls asleep.  Its our now 4 and a half year tradition.   He loves commenting along with me while i play calling out enemies,   That is awesome
---
I'd also like to see players on the blocked list be unable to one-shot legendaries that I'm near...but I have a suspicion that's not likely to happen.
---
Dug into Rationalwikis page on Logical Fallacies, didn't have any luck tracking down one that matched that. Easy to forget just how many types of logical fallacies there are out there
---
I've had friends say that I'm not crouching in NW when I am for me. It's probably a bug.
---
Ya it was bad from day one, excluding the rest of the server on d your character performs too many operations per minute the interface would severely degrade. Probably bad code handling the calls to and from their database service, I almost could reverse engineer it just from looking at its response times. There are ways to do it much better but it feels like they gave inventory code to an intern who does not understand asynchronous programming at all.
---
Maybe you got down voted because your question can be read as passive aggressive and people didn't like it? Or maybe you come across as a bit entitled, expecting people to answer your question merely because you deem yourself worthy of the attention? This is possibly born out by your complaint that they are interfering with your right to be answered and your assertion that they have no reason to do so. Or maybe they were just bored. Who knows, but food for thought.
---
I don't think that we of the general FO76 reddit community should not be allowed to name and shame cheaters, as per the "no witch-hunting" rule. The chance of abuse far out-weighs the benefits to the community. It'd likely lead to senseless claims whenever one party feels slighted by another, and pours out a barrel of radioactive waste just to spite the other player.
---
Instead, there should be a blacklist of player names (similar to those trade channels), that is maintained by a panel of trusted community members/moderators who are willing to gather and/or review the necessary evidence to verify that cheating was done. This evidence can then be posted together with each blacklisted entry, and players who are interested in blocking those cheaters can reference this list.
---
While not as effective as receiving a ban from Bethesda, at the very least the blacklist should inconvenience the cheaters to change their display-names or get new accounts once they can't get into games due to how blocking supposedly prevents blocked players from entering the same servers. Assuming that the blocking mechanism works ...
---
I've had this happen, and when I went ahead and hit install it found the files and the whole thing took maybe 2 or 3 minutes.
---
Experienced this many times, and worse..
---
Upon changing characters, the Character will sometimes spawn in where the previous one logged out, this can be quite troublesome when the character involved is a seriously overweight vendor, leaving no other option except to die &amp; respawn back at Camp, losing any junk they may have in inventory.
---
More like i've cured your syphilis... but now you can never see me as a doctor ever again...
---
High level players building across the tracks from Charleston station is a common one. I usually talk to them first. Some folks legit don't know about the vendor bot, and will move. Some build there intentionally. Same with some other well known random spawn points.
---
I once saw someone drop an impenetrable wall/building of foundation pieces around the dead sbq and other otherwise lootable corpses at scorched earth.
---
I remember somebody trying unsuccessfully to ruin Fasnacht. He got blocked for the effort. Actually, I blocked quite a few a Fasnacht for other stuff (one guy tried to block the path of the bots with PA frames).
---
Are you using Escape Artist too?  I know it was a bit funky when combined with Chameleon.
---
The game is largely the same, depending on how long you've been gone there's probably more stuff to do now.
---
We can name and shame Bethesda though
---
They never wanted human NPCs and dialogue options in 76 either, but we're getting those. What they 'wanted' can change, if they see profit in it, or if enough players want it.
---
You're missing the point of the people saying it's not a good idea.  
---
&gt; light doxing isnt bad when it's used against shitty cheaters
---
That might be the intent, but it would quickly get out of hand.  Hell, look at just the regular posts on this sub.  Someone says something positive about the game and they are automatically labeled as a Brand Advocate or paid shill. Just for having an opinion.  Witch hunts always start with good intentions, but tend to snowball beyond their original scope.
---
Essential unless you‚Äôre playing clean
---
It was wrong... it just felt oh so right ;)
---
I've been called a cheater because I have a legacy weapon that is almost a year old. Its a dangerous game naming people. YES there are blatant cheaters in NW and etc, but there are also a lot of salty people that call basically anything and everything cheating.
---
I was too prude to admit it:$
---
can i have your stuff?
---
It wasn't me (pc) but I like to occasionally pick up PA I find and leave them at CAMPS or sometimes at the Overseers camp.
---
I remember the first time getting PA as a new player even though I could only use the empty chassis -  I was soo excited.
---
I'm collecting them now so I can have a big line of them for people - makes me think of a used car lot.
---
Salty people are like that. I've been called a duper and a cheater because of my legacy weapon that I have had since almost the beginning of the game. "I'm reporting you for duping!" okay have fun I guess.
---
I don't play much these days, but i did block quite a few players for being dicks / selfish / creepy and I agree, it would fell good if they weren't allowed to access your vendors. That said, if your camp is that public that you can't stop them from visiting, why not move?
---
&gt;On the combination of perks I agree with the combinations ,everything under the combination I don‚Äôt agree with except the Fireproof perk
---
I'm genuinely curious why you oppose some of them. Do you think they're over powered or just unnecessary? Here they are so you don't have to look back-
---
Animal Friend- The ability to pacify animals. This would be a good perk for bush hiders so they don't give away their position with gun fire.
---
Add Lone Wander rank 1- This would be a great addition for solo players. Rank 2 or 3 would be too strong.
---
Add Mysterious Savior- It could come in clutch for snipers that get downed behind cover and it would be great combined with Last laugh for close range engagements. I thought this would be an overpowered perk at first but after thinking about it, most good players wouldn't be able to make room for this card. There's just a lot of better options.
---
Ricochet or Serendipity- But for melee wielders only. This would give melee users a slightly better chance at closing the gap.
---
Born Survivor
---
Fireproof 3- This would be just enough explosive resistance to  counter the damage buff from demolition expert. Explosives would still  be a very strong option.
---
Yes already seen it at Watoga station
---
Caps is caps
---
It would be fun if I could find them for you. What are you looking for?
---
I had it at 813 a few times.
---
If you load to 799 and then store all your scrap at once, it will go over the max.
---
Neat. Thanks for that fun bit of history.
---
Please explain this joke.
---
Its all about learning quickest route, killing only what you need to and preparing prior. Practice, practice, practice.
---
-dont mess with any terminals unless they are quest tasks. Ie dont waste time turning off turrets, just shoot ones that annoy you.
---
-sprinting is safe in most areas to save time. Practice will help you learn spots to sprint.
---
-equip hackers and picklocks for the rads part. After entering past rad shower turn left and kill assaultron and turrets next to lvl 3 door, or stealthbiy that part. After door is open hack the terminal in next room to overide ockdown and door to next area opens.
---
-grenades or other explosive weaps to destroy mf cores will save time. Door out of that area is inn far right corner, assualtron immediatly after going down the stairs.
---
-if you have space try to keep 15 fixed mainframe cores on hand so you can just swap them out in next room and make new ones from the destroyed cores atva tinker bench after launch to be prepped for next run. If you have none make sure to bring circuitry to make some at bench in that area, its faster than searching for good ones.
---
-last room is a waiting game, so initiate yo get it started then go around and destroy turrets while you wait.
---
Hopefully those tips can put you under 20 min solo with some practice, but likely you will start clearing faster.
---
Hope that helps
---
it's not bad like raider is bad. it just pales in comparison to t51b. there's no reason to use ultracite over it, unlike x01 which at least got higher rad res.
---
I did contact them earlier in the day (12+ hours ago) and they still haven't gotten back to me, lol.
---
I'd rather we be allowed to name scammers, but proof needs to be provided. Name them (reddit and GT ONLY) and provide a link to imgur with screenshots and video, cause people can just say they got scammed by someone when they actually didn't get scammed. Just my take on it. Open to hearing why anyone would disagree
---
That is useful to know thanks :)
---
sounds like a bug, I'd guess that most of the time you are invis as intended.
---
There's also a deal where players can sometimes see through the invis effect when fast travelling to a player that is invis.
---
Yeah i already looted pleasant cemetary, long before I knew about server hopping.
---
Trading is the answer you‚Äôre looking for
---
I meant different from other games. In other games when you buy something in a store you just put it on your character vs in this game you gotta go make it and can make multiple ones. That‚Äôs different (I‚Äôm new to this franchise. I mainly play MK11 and R6S)
---
All Nexus are safe. (and usefull)
---
Until you contract rad worms and die in a sec to ghouls.
---
Most of the time. We hear rumors of what is happening. It takes a long time to figure out how they are doing it, which is not easy. The thing is, when/if you finally figure it out, you just used it. There is no way around this. Sure, we could just leave it to Beth to figure it out, you are seeing what that looks like. It took them 3-4 months to realize you couldn't send or receive friend requests. You think they are capable of finding a memory editing exploit?
---
This is the best answer. I‚Äôll ask someone to try and use it.
---
Yes. But with actual proof, so we don't just get people saying "So-so, is a hacker!" just because they beat them in NW or refused to trade with them or just made the person mad.
---
Honestly if you want this to happen, make a subreddit dedicated to naming hackers.
---
Along the same lines, always make sure to keep at least 40 scrip, at least as long as the bug exists that occasional shows you the last item deposited into the machines.  A few days ago I went to the machine at Whitespring station after a nuke run and found a troubleshooters explosive reduced weight gatling gun for 40 scrip.
---
You say that now, but if you were the one caught up in the snowball effect, you'd be singing a different tune.  These things tend to get viscous extremely quickly and the longer a witchhunt goes on, the less proof is required
---
The issue at hand, which comes up frequently in games, is innocents being accused of cheating. Say Hypothetically, my 76 character. I have a very high perception stat paired with a lever action in VATs. I can clear enemies out quick enough that a player unfamiliar, might think it was an aimbot in use. Another example would be from EA's Battlefront. Where a modifier perk was added that gave damage resistance and boosted damage output while injured. Players who pushed into the 2nd/3rd tier of it were frequently accused of hacking.
---
SG is great still...up close. It's the way the damage drops so sudden at range, even with a bloody build.
---
It's great in buildings and for ground enemies since I'm not a sniper I'm close anyway but anything flying has me switching to heavy guns
---
We need the ability to fire slugs with a new receiver mod or something just to give a lil more of a ranged option
---
Two shot explosive explosive shotgun isn‚Äôt good anymore
---
Ok I‚Äôll add you as well! Great to see there‚Äôs nice and courteous gamers in this game franchises community üëçüèΩüòä
---
&gt;Contact support!
---
Lmao thanks, I needed a laugh today.
---
Are you sure you're playing fo76 on that xb360?
---
Thank you üôÇ
---
Cool good luck :)
---
As I mentioned above the power is fine.
---
Yes ive learned to love the pro snap camera in this game. 
---
Cant find a legendary, pull that bad boy out and walk around until its name appears.
---
Esp good for after sqb, i sometimes lose track of what i or my team has killled.
---
Yeah I never hear this song or Ghost Riders...both I like a hell of a lot more then the other songs...I wonder if there was an issue with the licenses? Like maybe the owners of the songs wanted more cash...
---
Oh yes i know :)
---
There has to be a system of justice to protect the innocent.
---
* If you have evidence of someone cheating, report it to Bethesda, they will follow up, I have seen it work.
---
* I have been accused of cheating by someone who was shooting me with a laser, and didn't understand how their weapon was only doing 2 damage per shot, but what they didn't understand was that I was using full Bolstering Heavy leather Armor and had a ER of 779.
---
This happened to me on PlayStation. It blows dogs. Everything should be fine though once the re download is complete
---
Sweet! Thank you!
---
Two shot is gimped on gatling lasers. It only adds 10% to base damage instead of the typical 25%.
---
The gun shoots so fast that furious will always be better in all encounters. Only the first hit will do less damage... Second will match and any more will outperform. And it has almost 20 shots / second... Also furious will last longer.
---
Stick with furious for sure.
---
He was a cheater who got banned.  Then he turned into a crybaby who took a tantrum out on the whole community by removing his site.  That subtle enough for 'ya?
---
Data mining CAN be the issue though. This is unfortunately what some of the mod community isn't understanding about the differences between this game and previous solo player Bethesda games. 
---
There's no official position or allowance given, as far as Bethesda has Stated mods currently are not permitted and some people are self appointing themselves as having some arbitrary distinction between themselves and others because they want to uncover information, usually information that Bethesda isn't usually wantting released. 
---
Think of it this way, if you wanted to find out a politicians undisclosed bank account balance and you hacked a bank or the IRS in order to get that information, it doesn't matter if your intentions were pure you're still likely to end up in jail. That's the difference between a whistle blower that has had legitimate access to the information reporting it being free from backlash versus some random person on the streets. That's just vigilante justice. 
---
Especially when many of the data miners were also doing YouTube videos or asking for donations which means that they are also profiting off the exploits even if they claim pure intent. 
---
Also when this information gets released into the wild it's either naive or intentionally turning a blind eye towards the potential implications and negative outcomes that happen when others use that released information for nefarious purposes.
---
I saw a ton more voices against them than anyone for them.
---
Neither - I just have a different opinion then you.
---
I‚Äôve got a bunch of legacies.
---
Ah, thank you!
---
That's actually helpful info..  
---
Both people playing in the same location / world?
---
&gt; You have to weed through all the false reports to get to the real ones.
---
its almost like downvoting and upvoting exists
---
Just wander around and explore every icon that appears on your map. There are tons of small side quests and daily activities that trigger when you first approach various locations. 
---
Like someone else mentioned, be sure to read all the posters on the wall at the train stations. There's 3 of them that collectively unlock 3 main missions and a whole shit load of side quests and other activities.
---
Last but not least, I wouldn't suggest neglecting the main quest as others have said. A lot of the random events don't appear until you've begun certain portions, for example the BOS events like Distant Thunder and Surface to Air don't appear until you're a member of the BOS, and the Enclave events don't start appearing until you've gotten access to the bunker and start a particular quest.
---
The Charleston spawn issue has been fixed though hasn't it? I've had vendors spawn there with camps nearby. Same as the SBQ not landing if there's a camp, not an issue any more.
---
It was a pain during meat week though, with the hermit crab walking up the hill and out the event area if someone had a camp up there.
---
i never said all the guys that shoot in the sky are cheaters
---
stop putting words in my mouth
---
Ill answer your questions by number, with my own opinions.
---
1: Yes, melee is still King, it still does crazy ridiculous damage if you build right for it.  Bloodied Meat Hook is the current top end META
---
2: I have not experienced this in months.
---
3: Two Shot Explosive is dead.  Its the entry level endgame legendary.  Just about all other prefixs are better than Two Shot.
---
4: No, duping is not rampant like it used to be.  There are still a few of them out there, but its nowhere near what it used to be.  They have fixed most duping bugs.
---
5: Server Stability and performance are way better now.
---
It's been a couple months since I played, but at that point:
---
1: melee is still overpowered (but not the only viable option)
---
2: there seems to always be an enemy damage bug. 
---
3: TSE got a major nerf, as well as shotguns. They are nowhere near as good as they were
---
4: people who dupe will find a way. They do tend to prioritize patching it out when they can find a way to.
---
5: game stability peaked around march-may, but then took a huge dive.
---
Are you really from the Cult of Mothman? The great moth?
---
Stability is way better than a year ago. Not perfect but still way better.
---
Scrap the wire to that particular machine, then rebuild the wire, works for me.
---
This game might as well be free to play, you can get an account for $2
---
I don‚Äôt believe so but I‚Äôm not sure
---
No. I have my pip boy on 24/7 as it is and can barely see. This game doesn't need to be darker. You want it darker? Lower your brightness :/
---
Aren‚Äôt those cool finds?
---
This goes on any longer and i'm gonna get mad
---
Downvoting and upvoting are not facts.  They are not proof.  
---
There was a time on this sub when PSAs about people being able to steal from you via the trade menu were upvoted to the top of the threads.  But--despite all these upvotes--it turned out to be nothing more than myth and misinformation.
---
I think perception has an effect of seeing you or not. Higher perception the better chances of seeing you. Just my two cents.
---
Im really hoping it wasn‚Äôt someone‚Äôs stuff trust stashed there if their stash box was full. If so then can‚Äôt do anything about it now but yeah super cool.
---
If you‚Äôre on PS4 and on tonight we will adventure together and I will show you many cool places
---
I think people are just pissed because Bethesda released the subscription but won't work to fix all the stuff wrong with the game; even though I don't personally like the subscription myself, I don't think that anyone should be bullied or harassed for buying it. Its like saying you bought a movie a lot of people didn't like and they just assault you for it.
---
They‚Äôd probably put it somewhere less obvious.
---
Thisssssss I thought I was playing on my toaster or something fam üòÇüòÇüíÄüíÄ
---
That was my favorite zone when I played, I loved exploring it by torchlight.
---
I am in the same boat... other than my 9 year old is as coordinated as her mother, so she sucks at FPS also...
---
Well I'm saying they are.
---
You seem to think they'r the only kind of cheaters.
---
You want to name and shame cheaters, fine with me, but cheaters are soo much more than the blatant obvious ones (shootin up into the sky)
---
I'm sure I heard ghost riders playing this weekend, but I do wish we had some more classics playing on the radio.
---
If shaming worked on hackers we wouldn't have had the biggest NW hacker do an AMA in this subreddit.
---
Been there, done that.  Usually doesn't help, but I've certainly had times when it did.
---
The issue here is that there's no problem *seeing* a scorchbeast corpse, if you're anywhere near it, you can see it - but where the corpse ends up can be *far* from where it lands when you kill it.  The camera only finds things that are pretty close by.  Great for a fight like the imposter sheepsquatch though.
---
Last one I killed (also a 3*, so lots of reasons to want the loot) 'landed' a few yards from me, practically on my head, but disappeared before it could finish bouncing.  And I looked *everywhere* for it.  I checked the cliffs above, and under the water of the nearby lake.  Anywhere it pathed in the last couple minutes before it died, but no go.  I eventually got it after fast traveling a couple times, when it decided to follow me and drop on my head again (as they are wont to do).
---
And no, wasn't worth it for the 1* buzzblade I got :P
---
17+. That's what M rating stands for. Abide by it.
---
I personally believe that those of us who purchase the subscription are helping Bethesda fix this game. It takes money to pay developers, workers, server cost, maintenance, etc.
---
just report them
---
This seriously needs to happen. I can't even tell that it's night 90% of the time
---
Well that's a cool way to look at it; it does need quite a bit of work.
---
" embargo" Damn, there were so many red flags and we just all ignored them
---
I‚Äôd wait for Wastelanders, you‚Äôll (hopefully) have a much fuller and less buggy game by then.
---
Skyrim was fixable with Mods.. 76 isn't..
---
it literally does NOTHING
---
Hey man, here's that link:
---
[https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout76/mods/451/](https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout76/mods/451/)
---
I'll prob make a post about it too, just to let everyone know
---
That could be it. We do a lot of fast traveling, and I have the best connection so I always arrive first... maybe that‚Äôs it. 
---
Either way, thanks! &lt;3
---
i only named some examples 
---
there are obiviously wall hackers,ESPs ,silent aimbots etc etc
---
Make your own subreddit for sharing proof of hackers if you really want to have a witch hunt.
---
I generally agree, but if you have the carry space an Instigating Dragon is kind of handy for the first shot on a tanky critter.  Shot then swap to something faster.
---
I don't get how people can get banned for sharing exploits with Bethesda to fix, but people who are reported cheaters don't get banned.
---
I'm also curious why you oppose these-
---
Add night time and weather
---
Have the circle finish near the edges of the map more often.  
---
Add Shrouded to Wood armor. Dense to Scout. Lead Lined to Marine. 
---
Give us a way to quick drop armor¬†when¬†we¬†pick¬†up¬†a¬†better¬†piece.
---
The Lockpicking and Science bobbleheads should also give you *one chance* at hacking or opening a safe. This would make them actually worth picking up.
---
Give us the ability to mod our weapons and armor at benches. This  would be game changing. You could also add a perk card that allows you to mod without a workbench
---
What I've been doing recently is playing Spotify on my PS4 while I play FO76, usually the 1940s and 1950s hits playlist, as well as a playlist that has every song from every Fallout game. Listenting to Big Iron, The Wanderer, etc. in West Virginia is pretty cool.
---
Ghost Riders in the Sky is definitely still in the game, unless they JUST removed it.
---
What quest
---
You'd be surprised, I found over 1200lbs of 3 star max level legendaries in the cash register of the purveyor. Including sent, bloodied, junkies, TS, etc.
---
[It just works. ](https://youtu.be/Fas-snI0R_E)
---
Considering that heavy rad intake is the most dangerous thing for a bloody unyielding build, I don‚Äôt really know if I‚Äôd use that to argue your point.  Yes, we use rads to maintain low health, but getting hit by a glowing ghoul outside of power armor is basically instant death.  Between the inevitable glowing pustules and the actual strike, the rad damage is enormous and instant.  If the hit gets through serendipity, I have almost no defense.  Having the SBQ land next to you while she has a rad cloud around her also requires a very quick retreat.  Radshield helps a bit, but strangler blooms don‚Äôt seem to exist anymore.  It‚Äôs a double edged sword.  I need rads, but they‚Äôre also my glaring weakness. My bloody characters are both geared around stealth and maxed out agility, so radiation is a major concern for my playstyle.
---
For what it‚Äôs worth, heavy radiation exposure can make your hair fall out, but I don‚Äôt think anyone has ever had a body part fall off or require amputation.  A real human would die of cancer or organ failure well before major atrophy is a concern.  The concept of a Fallout style ghoul being borne of radiation is scientifically preposterous, so I think that point is moot.
---
Bethesda has shown us how they‚Äôll monetize a modern F2P title with Blades, and even Fallout Shelter‚Äîtwo games with dramatically lower development costs and overhead than Fallout 76. 
---
I agree that the company in question is a factor, but Bethesda has proven that they‚Äôll be just as aggressive as anyone with their two F2P titles. There‚Äôs no logical reason to think they‚Äôd be less aggressive with a F2P FO76 that costs them more to operate.
---
Most people do that to store items on their mule characters.
---
There are no tutorials in this game, as Bethesda seems to have assumed everyone would have prior fallout experience.
---
There really are a lot of great players in the community, and many will be more than happy to help you out with some supplies to make life in the wasteland a bit less dangerous, just remember to pay it forward later.
---
Stick to the Forest and explore, slowly working your way North, ignore the main quest lines for now, they will get you in over your head quickly, try to find someone near your level to team up and explore with, the social aspect of this game is great.
---
I‚Äôve had same issue where I‚Äôd tap to go to Vault 76 and it would send me to silo alpha. And took caps. Idk wasn‚Äôt a big deal but did confuse me
---
So this is essentially what made the scorchedbeast?
---
Then I suppose I‚Äôm a pos
---
Ooof your mega downvoted. I disagree because I've been called a cheater and told I was getting reported just because I killed a salty player in Nuclear Winter
---
I think 1st should be about private servers, and whatever they will add to that(persistent workshop, ect) The tent should not exist, IMHO. The scrapbox should be part of the base game for everyone. 1st subscriber, 1month, but I will renew.
---
Rad emitter.
---
5. I'm going to ban your account
---
I just think that's neat!
---
im not talking about niche small cases like this and people don't get it
---
im talking about the blatant aimbotting /people that shoto at the ground and down you in 1 hit ,you know who they are 
---
its clear this game has no anti cheat and bethesda doesn't even know who is cheating without video evidence
---
Good idea!! I think I'll do the same. About to launch my second one so I would hate for it to happen again.
---
Kill higher lvl enemies
---
I think they should be marked like the up coming legendary system but with a bad sport mark.
---
The level is also tied to the legendary creature you loot. If you kill a level 40 ghoul you won't get level 50 items. It will drop the max level piece that doesn't exceed 40, so it can vary between 35 and 40.
---
It‚Äôs happened to me quite a few times. I basically don‚Äôt nuke or go into Whitesprings nukes anymore, they‚Äôre a guaranteed blue screen for me
---
Also certain weapons cap out at lower levels
---
I wish I would have known that before I learned them all.  Oh well.
---
While i do agree the game has bugs and lacks content and the devs are greedy AF, the game actually runs pretty well on my PC. No crashses, no disconnects in the past months, i can even run 2 accounts on same PC ( with some lag, of course). 
---
   Paying $400 for a gaming console can't give you the same benefits as paying $2000 for a PC.
---
Yeah definitely. Grenades to destroy the cores helps a lot.
---
If it was just a single legendary and some scrap I doubt it was someone muling, normally when someone mules it will be a lot more than a single legendary.
---
Bethesda is going to attack us? Thanks for the warning!
---
I am on ps4 also. If I find it I will give to you. I already have the gauntlet I wanted so I won't need it.
---
Ok thx
---
What's another good spot for legendary?
---
&gt;Had a pretty nice Heavy Gunner build for SBQ and melee for small stuff and now rifles became far superior
---
Hmmmmm.... I don't think that is the case. I have a heavy gunner build for SBQ, shotty for smalls, and it's one of the few  I see actively move her health bar as I fire.. .granted, it's a FE, primed  but it's a serious killer
---
The answer lies in what you did to get these items. I will start with a guess.
---
Hke many times did you go to do the "Uranium fever" event?
---
Also what was the level of the mobs?
---
I am not, but it's on my list of things to try with it. 
---
When you say "funky" do you mean it gets buggy or works better?
---
100% this. People get shamed for not censoring themselves if a kid is playing an M rated game, or the game itself is blamed and it's pure bullshit.
---
Definitely. Happened twice in one hour today.
---
I‚Äôll take things that never happened for 500 Alex
---
Thanks I‚Äôll take that into consideration and of course I‚Äôll give back once I‚Äôm on my feet. And another question, how do I know I‚Äôm in an area where there‚Äôs radiation other than me getting to close and dying? And speaking of radiation, how do I get a suit to get into those areas?
---
I was at west tek for most of this but ok
---
I had this yesterday with my magazine rack
---
All your base now belongs to us!
---
Put it on a rug outside and move the rug inside.
---
They are all at the sorority house, but that won't stop you from scrapping them, lol. I am on my 3rd set.
---
I didn't do uranium fever, just alot of killing all around and barely any level 45-50
---
The others commenting here are probably right, though very extreme. I think Bethesda will do a lot to make money, but they have limits. As awful as Fallout 1st is, it still isn‚Äôt game changing. I do, however, believe that there will be more expensive, and more numerous, micro transactions, and possibly, like Fallout 1st, non-micro transactions.
---
I have a gaming pc as well. I'm just savvy to my ps4 more often. Are the graphics any better? Because these textures look like shit when they are loading. I have an evo 9 plus ssd and 32gb ram, 1280 rtx so if I got it on pc it should load fast as hell.
---
Depended on what I was running, but 2s was a lot of fun as a Restokin build, 3s and 5s it was primarily resto with some feral. I'm pretty sure the top rated 2v2 comp was a Restokin/Shadow Priest with an MMR of over 2400. Pretty nuts.
---
It‚Äôs normal for super mutants to be below lvl 50 what meant they can only drop items lvl 40 and 45
---
Is this your application to Bethesda management?
---
So far you're looking like a good fit.
---
Personally I really like the way it looks. Wonder how many atoms?
---
&gt;They nerf everything but bloodied
---
Bloodied is, and always will be,  a glass cannon. Sure, it can, potentially,  output great damage however it's relatively easy to destroy them. Junkies builds are a much more balanced approach and can have nearly,  if not more,  damage out. 
---
For most "meta" builds it's not the base type so much anymore,  it's what you can stack for stats/modifiers
---
11 by then they'll be mature enough but I would mute gamechat as there will be alot of people screaming
---
Same!!! But im not the biggest fan of 3rd person views. Especially in buildings it can get a little wonky.
---
They're junk. You scrap them for components to build various things.
---
Asbestos
---
I will have to try that thank you! :)
---
Plastic! :)
---
I can't compare since i haven't tested the game on consoles. All i can say from my point of view is that the game has become more stable in the last months, compared to 4-8 months ago.
---
A little bit, but i don‚Äôt enjoy third person. :/
---
4/20 challenges
---
Lol you are a true fo76 initiate now. Welcome!
---
TSE shotguns might not be all that great anymore but if you‚Äôre a shotgun fan, look for a Furious combat combo. It‚Äôs one of my favorites, and even without any shotgun perks loaded it can still take down the average level 50-60ish enemy in a couple-few blasts. Nice for getting out of a pinch. Bloodied would be even better (IMO) but they‚Äôre scarce drops and command high dollar.
---
Relax baby, have a drink, sit back and let's see where the night takes us
---
...and all other accounts that used the same exploit because an automated system rounded all suspects up.
---
That is up to you, I would just make another character first without deleting the first, you never know if the new character will have a better seed.
---
Mole miners smoke them when we're not looking. üòÇ

I believe that‚Äôs how the majority of us think. We are merely supporting game we love, whether it‚Äôs perfect or not. ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
I'm in a BOS discord group. May have been them
---
Yeah only set mine as drop, not death bag.
---
All i did was make a playlist of fallout 76,4, new vegas, and 3 songs on shuffle. Gonna add some sound files from radio hosts.
---
No clue, I don‚Äôt legendary hunt. I just nuke for fun and for flux/materials
---
Do you still have eyes on this one? It‚Äôs almost been 3 months since the bug started.
---
Yeah, be nice if they didn't put you on the same server in the first place, but they do...
---
Inform them on CaNcEr plzz
---
We should, I'll start.
---
I was playing and I saw /u/Frank_Castle_1978 running through walls and aimbotting people from across the map.
---
Obviously I can't prove this, but I think OPs idea is so good, that we should just roll with it as there are no problems with it I can see at all.
---
Depends,  Are you referring to loose cigs, or full packs, or cartons.
---
Mainly, i make gunpowder or shotgun shells from them.
---
comparing the boston bombing to video game cheaters yikes
---
You will take radiation from being in water, or from being near other radiation sources, keep an eye on it , and move away from the rad sources.
---
You can find hazmat suits in Mines &amp; disposal areas, but some have level requirements.
---
Packs and cartons. I didn‚Äôt know you can pick up singles.
---
If you run up toward the north Red bridge and come back it can spawn the vendor bot, as well. People having their camps at Charleston station is fine.
---
&gt; If you find an egregious cheater - absolutely report them to ZAX (BGS) - but please don't start the equivalent of the F76 McCarthy Trials.
---
i am and the lowest tier support doesn't do fuck all about it
---
since bethesda actively monitors this sub we should be able to show them whos actively cheating
---
Probably someone transfering scrip onto a different character IMO
---
I‚Äôm always looking for shells I didn‚Äôt know you can make them. What bench do you make them?
---
I think what was confusing me a bit was theres ultracite cores also. That and I didnt feel like mathing together all my partial fusion cores to compare that to what my ammo count shows. ü§ì  That makes sense though. Thanks.
---
you know there are ways to filter those kind of things by having a video proof only rule or something like that
---
Damn, haven‚Äôt played in a while &amp; thought you could ride a chicken now
---
&gt;It'd likely lead to senseless claims whenever one party feels slighted by another, and pours out a barrel of radioactive waste just to spite the other player.
---
video proof only jesus
---
Bug
---
thats what im saying,have a video proof only rule and thats that
---
They initially spawn as per the level for that region. If you kill them, leave the world and log back on they should re-spawn as per your level. Or if you return to that area later on, without logging off.
---
cheers m8
---
as i said to other people
---
video proof only
---
I believe there were new ZAX audio files found that suggest NPC's may be in NW along with the random AI thats already spawns.
---
I understand. And in certain circumstances video proof is enough. But like I said, I have a legit legacy weapon that I earned as a world drop. If someone took a video of me TODAY and spread it around as "video proof" then there is a witch hunt. Its just a dangerous line. I absolutely agree that SOMETHING needs to be done about cheaters but it is just very hard to do. That's just my opinion on the matter.
---
tinkers bench.

they are around,  I usually find them in or near ashtrays.

It took me a while to figure out what the hell type weapon the Whoopsies was until I realized y'all playing "Gotta Catch 'Em All" gonorrhea and herpes edition.
---
I love Fallout, and FO76 is my least favorite FO game. But that being said, I have met some amazing people playing this game and these people have actually become some of my closest friends. It has its issues, yes, but at the end of the day, this game is what YOU make of it.
---
BoS has a few for the T-60 though they can be a pain to come by since they're a rare reward for turning in technical data
---
Username checks out.
---
I watch youtube videos therefore I know stuff. This is the fucking bane of my existence. 
---
The only way to know something is experience it for yourself. Watching videos of random peoples opinions is not reliable information
---
Ok I was wondering what that bench was. I‚Äôm assuming all ammonia gets made there?
---
How does one get their camp critiqued?
---
It‚Äôs a few things. Ur lvl may be below 50? The enemies may be below 50? They could have spawned that way cause u r lower level or maybe a low level recently passed through? And lastly I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs the region. Look up the level brackets of each region and that determines the enemies lvl they‚Äôll spawn and more confusingly a lvl 50 enemy may b attacking u in the ash heap but because it‚Äôs in the ash heap it won‚Äôt drop a lvl 50 item ‚Äî in my experience ash heap always gives me lvl 35 and under. Forest around 1-20. Cranberry bog 40-50 very sad when it‚Äôs 40. More 35-50. And savage divide 35-50 but more often then not 50
---
Lmfao I'm done üòÇüòÇ
---
I don't know about Gatling Laser, but I once had a TS Gatling Plasma and the accuracy of that damn thing was so awful that I didn't even bothered to use it most of the time, it was only useful against big and relatively static targets such as when the Queen was landed. Traded it to a Furious Gatling Plasma and the difference is night and day, and after the second or third shot, it already does more damage than the TS too.
---
Let this also be a lesson that you should never take someone elses word for something unless you try it yourself.  
---
Please do not cave to the vocal minority.  The vocal minority is really good at making themselves look like the majority with the monetized youtube channels and reddit posts about all the "bad" with the game.  Hate sells, positivity doesnt.
---
Its no worse than any other first time release online platform.  They never work as intended the first year out.  The same types of things happened with Everquest, World of Warcraft, Dark age of Camelot, Planetside, Anarchy Online, Rift, ect.   I could go on.   But Fallout has a very dedicated and die hard fanbase, and they get their feelings hurt easily.  
---
Dont trust someone elses hype, try it for yourself and see through the smoke and mirrors that youtube hate mongers are portraying.
---
&gt; Methinks its because they are actually some of the cheaters we speak of that has them protesting so hard on this one
---
Thank you, btw.  You just verified why so many people think this would be a bad idea.  This topic is only discussing the pros and cons of potentially shaming and naming suspected cheaters and the groundwork has already been laid for a witch hunt to start.  
---
"People aren't agreeing with what I believe in, ergo they must be cheaters".  This is the type of logical fallacy that gets the witch hunt snowball effect going.
---
happy cake day! Also I‚Äôve tried that. Doesn‚Äôt seem to work. What system are you on?? If you could try to teach me the ways lol
---
It‚Äôs just that I‚Äôm not a fun of the FO universe. I prefer TES universe more. There is no way I can play every single big title just to make my own opinion.
---
What system? I'm jealous
---
I love this shit game
---
Don't feel pressured.  None of the quests are 'time-sensitive' they will be there when you get to them. If it seems like there are too many you can shut them off in your journal. they will still be there but you won't have all the little points on your map cluttering it up. I usually turn off all of them except the one I'm focused on. Once I completed then I turn on all of them and find whichever ones closest to me and then move on to that one. At level 25 I'd say make sure all your gear is also as close to level 25 gear as you can get it. At that level I'd still stick to the forest and the toxic valley. That's a good point to try and start assembling your first set of power armor. If you're feeling like a fight, head to the Charleston fire department look for the mining poster on the wall to get your excavator mission and go get your excavator armor.
---
i said video proof in other comments but i guess you just had to be a smart ass
---
"I browse Reddit, therefore I know stuff" -the development team
---
This reminds me of the time I lost a bunch of stuff I was trying to transfer to my alt. I expect they will never add a shared stash for transfer purposes, except maybe to First Citizens
---
Works a treat at the golf club, kill everything, log off and back on quickly, fresh spawns, rinse and repeat!
---
don't be ridiculous man lol
---
I'm on PS4. I got the bungalow, but I haven't used it. There is something I wanted to try, but I didn't suggest it cause I haven't tested it.
---
Indeed a lesson it is going to be ;) even though one will not necessarily try every single big title, one could certainly wait and don‚Äôt jump to conclusions
---
To be honest, I never understood people who base their opinion solely on what others say. 
---
"Oh, Youtuber X says it is shit then it must be shit!!!" - well, tastes differ. You only know if you like a game if you played it, and really FO76 isnt so bad. All those Youtubers blew it completely out of proportion to make cash off the failed launch, good business move but crappy for the community. Yes, it does have bugs, yes FO1st is a joke - but all in all, it is a solid game. Especially with friends.
---
You also said you weren't bothered about false positives as a price to pay, but you seem resistant to being one of those false positives...
---
... funny how that works.
---
Almost all ammo is made at a tinkers bench.
---
You also need the tinkers bench to fix the prosnap camera (if you want do to your possum questline), and make film for it.
---
The tinker bench is also good for bulking scrap (unless you are a 1ster with a box)
---
That just sounds stupid to me. Theres no reason you should not want to sell it. Even if they‚Äôve been dicks thats still profit. Weird flex but alright.
---
Tend to agree with this. There's plenty of resources to plan out your build before allocating points. If you made a few mistakes here and there, then sure, use the post 50 levels to correct that. If you've completely gimped your build because you can't take the time to understand the system, i mean..sucks for you, hopefully you've learned from your mistake. Even then, you can slowly respec or say fuck it, and create a new char.
---
If added, could totally see them doing this for a cost in the atom shop or making it exclusive to fallout1st.
---
Ah yes, the weekly posting of this thread, where OP gets very angry and defensive about their point
---
ughhh sad , I‚Äôm on Xbox One. I can‚Äôt seem to get it work.
---
Interested üòÑ
---
Hmm almost like that's not what they said and you're misrepresenting it
---
Start in the Flatwoods area and then make your way Northwest from there. At level 5,  you'll probably still get killed here and there but a lot less often and you'll be able to put up more of a fight. Not a lot of super mutants in that direction, mostly scorched and a few wild animals. Don't even bother with deathclaw island at level five. Lol. You will live just long enough to look death in the face and then you will die. Have fun.
---
Ok, I'll bite, what kind of cheating?    
---
Only ask because generally understood point is Consoles are less likely to see these issues.
---
Lol. Okay.  You do realize I've been an active creator of mods since fo3 Right?  
---
Most data miners are using modified TESedit for f76 to access the data, which is an non approved 3rd party tool created FOR modding in the absence of the creation kit.
---
This is considered against the stated terms of service for 76. 
---
Some people are going as far as using other third party datashark apps to see what is being transferred between local game to server client, this is again against terms of service and considered hacking even if you are not using the access to the data to "change" anything. You are still using tools not authorized to access information that would not be otherwise available. 
---
Then going so far as to "verify" exploits is full on using methods against the game for no reason other than self validating a claim for your own benefit. Regardless of "why" a person says they are doing it, they're still doing it and they know they shouldn't be.
---
Preach
---
which weapon or all?
---
set up a box at your camp with one wall open....put a Brahmin and feeder inside....shoot the Brahmin with a Bloatfly syringer.....Pick up dead bloatflies....each time you hit a bloatfly with that syringer and then kill them they will produce more bloatflies....syringer bloatlfy, kill, another bloatfly appears, repeat....the more people you have hit it with the syringer the more bloatlfies appear...4 people hit one bloatfly and 4 more bloatflies!!  tons of acid in a short amount of time
---
Nothing. I always wished you could pick one up and it give you maybe charisma or perception buffs when consumed
---
Disappointing you can't see anything but a narrow vision of what you think is "right" and "wrong"
---
Someone remembers.
---
Nice, thanks for the reply.
---
There was like 8 or 10 weapons and they repeated and most of them sucked!!
---
&gt; I sit here today and I just can‚Äôt see how this game gets the negativity it does.  
---
AHAhah you cant see how it gets the negativity it does? Indie games charge less because they know their game isnt worth the 60. Bethesda and Fallout team charged 60 for this because even though it isnt worth it people will still buy it. THEN they charge you for a premium membership in the game.... yano... like club penguin, except club penguin works as intended.
---
you gotta seriously have your head in the ground to think this is a good game. Supporting and buying these games and supporting Bethesda by giving them money is bad. I bet there is people on the team making that game that know and have the skills to make a great game. But Bethesda's suits will never let that happen while the quality of the game doesnt effect how much they make. 
---
Because you enjoy something doesnt mean its good, even good game deserve a certain amount of negativity. 
---
Bethesda is just as bad and EA who is just as bad as Activision blizzard. 
---
Monkey Island was the best game ever made its just been downhill since then.
---
The point is the preferred weapon around here is the Instigating Pitchfork.
---
Nearly all
---
Cool man keep getting fucked in the ass and thanking bethesda
---
I think thats the Responder Bot; Pretty sure Grahm has the Starburst Clock, tho
---
Why do people use "I'm a real man" as an argument? It never helps their argument only really makes it worse
---
Man cannot live on monster hunter alone. 
---
~Abraham Lincoln~
---
Never said this.
---
&gt; And they don't do that because they said so right.
---
I think that is the difference between you and I. You assume the worst of people, I do not. And even worse, you are willing to throw anyone under the bus on the possibility of bad actions. Someone tries to do something good, and you are just like, nah, they are just as bad as cheaters and exploit abusers...
---
People weren‚Äôt against them when they were being requested. Anyway as I said, I find them useless. Paying atoms to repair to 100% vs repairing at my workbench for free to 200% is a no brainer.
---
I'm presuming that if you log off then it logs you back into the same world. Just wondering about any workshops I have claimed. Would I lose them? Im farming acid at hemlock holes workshop. To be safe i reckon i should kill all enemies then log out and back in before i build anything there.
---
Is the lightning bolt white... or red?
---
When that happens a "fix" is your friend needs to logout and back in. There's a sh1t ton of issues with the social tab. Including the most frustrating game load lag with large friends list. I literally load in 5-10 seconds after my teammates in NW. Real great when I spawn near an enemy.
---
Highly disagree with your opinion. some items have never and might never be duped.
---
Think people are just getting annoyed by people saying "play outer world's" every other post, as if it's a replacement. Which it really isn't
---
Please don‚Äôt compare Survival Mode to Nuclear Winter mode.  
---
We all know there‚Äôs rampant cheating and glitching going on in NW.  People that got salty or bitched about Survival mode either didn‚Äôt know how to play or adjust their strategy or they simply hated PvP.  It was doomed from the beginning because FO 76 is run by builders and grinders and vendors.  I honestly think if some had their way you wouldn‚Äôt be allowed to kill enemies much less other players.
---
&gt;Ur lvl may be below 50
---
Already said level 62
---
&gt;They could have spawned that way cause u r lower level o
---
Already said 62 in the post
---
cigs have plastic???
---
I dont have one but I would think that you first craft a regular one and then "mod" it to riot one
---
We have never allowed memes.
---
It should be in the clothing section in the armor bench.
---
Sorry I responded gee there was a lot more info in my response then the first sentence and half of the second sentence. Smh
---
It's a skin for the ranger armor so instead of craft go to the other option pick the ranger armor and add the skin
---
No one's getting fucked in the ass lmao. Like I said you don't have to buy it if it were an atomic shop item and people who would buy it would probably actually want it so they're not getting screwed over.
---
That was my first experience on launching a Nuke.
---
So demoralized was i by this experience.That i didn't bother again for a while.
---
The first run is time consuming,and takes a heavy hit on the Stimpack supplies
---
Next run you will do in 20 minutes and use only a few Stimpacks because you will know where all the Lazer Turrets and Colonel Gutsies are.
---
Not really. You found it, if they didnt want someone to find it then do it sonewhere else
---
if you have video proof of me cheating and any linkage of that ign to me please post it
---
Yes the Apocalyptic Aristocracy is real. It is a group of 1st members and 1st supporters. Just like any group you have a mix of people who join. There are some people who PvE in game and some that PvP. 
---
The "peasant" comments are based around people who complain to 1st people for choosing to spend their money on Fallout 1st. It is meant as a joke.
---
All in all it is a just a group of people who like Fallout 76 and want a place where they can talk without being chastised for supporting the game that they enjoy.
---
At this point in the game if you don‚Äôt have a ‚Äúlegacy‚Äù weapon or gear (auto FFR Tesla or Ass/Cav armor) then you aren‚Äôt trying hard enough. 
---
With player vending and websites to purchase items you can get just about anything you want either through caps or real dollars. 
---
It‚Äôs the camps I visit where dude has 50k in stimpaks so I‚Äôm pretty sure he or she didn‚Äôt make or farm that many.
---
I think it‚Äôs the pack and cartons but yeah I think the various cig products break into asbestos cloth and plastic. Cloth combined with acid makes gunpowder which is used for ammo crafting and asbestos I can‚Äôt remember what it‚Äôs good for but plastic is why I scrap cigs
---
Let us know if you feel a shortness of breath, a persistent dry cough, or your heart stopping. Because that's not part of the test. That's asbestos.
---
i didn't mention it in my title i  am talking about NW
---
I feel my point is being lost on you.
---
The cancer is what mutated and made them live forever.
---
huh, I gotta start picking them up
---
The point is they are charging obviosuly large amounts for stupid skins and items that should just BE IN the game. 
---
It's a bad idea to suggest things here because it's already proven  that they are taking forum ideas  from players, and putting them in game and charging for them.
---
If you dont think its shady practice you are exactly the reason the gaming industry is going th way it is.
---
&gt; Lol. Okay. You do realize I've been an active creator of mods since fo3 Right?
---
And I since Morrowind. Welcome to the club. Never heard of you.
---
&gt; This is considered against the stated terms of service for 76.
---
Most all data mining is. Nothing new about that.
---
&gt; Then going so far as to "verify" exploits is full on using methods against the game for no reason other than self validating a claim for your own benefit. Regardless of "why" a person says they are doing it, they're still doing it and they know they shouldn't be.
---
And in the case of the person/people in question, they are known for their service to finding and reporting bugs in detail to the devs so they can get fixed.
---
What is your point?
---
Ok good to know. And I‚Äôm not lol. I got this game for $6 on eBay What‚Äôs makes you think I‚Äôd pay $100 for a subscription to the game lol
---
This is a long standing (some pun intended) bug. It seems like the effect gets lost somewhere between your client and the other person's client. It seems worst with chameleon armor and seems worse on some servers than others.
---
Lol not bad right
---
Yeah, there are so many forms of cheating and not all of them are apparent. Same thing with people dropping 15k lead and steel.
---
I‚Äôm gonna assume OP meant the original Xbox. I‚Äôm stuck with it too and the only places that run at least equal to FO4 is the Ash Heap and some of the northern regions of the swampy area. I always assumed that‚Äôs because nobody is ever out there. 
---
Anyway, if you turn down the distance meter, it helps dramatically and also you won‚Äôt really even notice a loss in sight distance except maybe in NW.
---
Wish the game would automatically transfer any loot dropped after 5mins to a random container nearby. Imagine all the cool stuff you would find after whitesprings run.
---
Who makes what Bethesda does profitable? The players.
---
This pipe pistol says that‚Äôs invalid..... (that‚Äôs like one of my only guns rn lmao)
---
I‚Äôm jealous. I look for these situations all the time and go figure I‚Äôm busy this evening or I‚Äôd run. Have some cards myself
---
Not really, I don't have an opinion on it nor have I ever spent real money on in game items. There is no other way to suggest items for the game  and  since I actually like and still play the game and have ideas to add to the game, I'll keep putting them here so that there's a chance they get implemented. My suggestions have been implemented before so I have no reason to think it's not possible to have them imemented again
---
Thanks for this valuable info
---
I would LOVE brotherhood helping fight the queen but bad news is only NPCs they are adding are settlers and raiders currently so no chance we will see enclave, brotherhood, or scientist random encounters yet.
---
I got TSE Blackpowder pistol just a week ago
---
Yeah, I see how it can be passive-agressive now.
---
Worthy of what attention? Dude, it's a question. The way you worded your question came off as trying to not sound accusatory, but that's exactly what you sound like. How is asking a question that can easily be answered, "entitled"?
---
My assertion that I have a right to be given a chance to be answered is completely justified. There's absolutely no reason to have downvoted me except for that first reason you gave.
---
I think you're overanalyzing and taking this way too seriously. I honestly think I only got downvoted for that first reason, which is stupid because why would anyone assume the worst? What better way could I have worded my question in a short way?
---
Data miners helped Bethesda find a bug that was game breaking+. We kinda owe some of them a thank you.
---
Not mad at ya, just overwhelmed by, and tired of, all the misinformation and flat out wrong information that gets shared through youtube and social media sites about pretty much every topic on earth
---
Side note, objects that don't require direct connection need connector 1.5 blocks if I remember correctly.
---
Alright, give me few examples? But proper stuff, please.
---
Edit: I'm not trying to bellitle your opinion, I'm genuinely interested.
---
i guess bethesda rather wants you to have a fo 1st sub?
---
Also gaming "journalists"
---
I already answered all of this, the same rules do not apply to a multiplayer game as they do to a single player game.  Just because you could get away with it before doesn't change that you are allowed to with this game. 
---
 someone exploiting their solo player fo4 to get everything out of the gate level 1 only changes that individual experience, exploiting in a world that affects others means that same behavior can't be tolerated in this situation regardless of what 
---
Again, point is that no one has a proper vetting process to ensure the claims anyone has that they have valid reasons versus someone who is just using it for duping or whatever. Like it or not you just have to accept that's how it is. It's not your toy, it's theirs.  You don't have the right to do whatever you want  just because you bought the game.
---
 Terms of service still apply and whether someone likes it or not, it applies to all people. We can't simultaneously be begging Bethesda to fix the issue with hackers ruining the game while giving arbitrary distinction and allowances just because someone claims they're the good guy.
---
Hey those aren't bugs, they are features! What doing raid too easy? Bam power armor glitch crash.
---
I find  shooting randomly at the Computer destroys just as many [Cores](https://Cores.Fire).
---
Also getting in close with a good Melee weapon (Bloody Meat Hook)  and  take Chems to take out the Colonel Gutsies and  Asaultrons. I find closing the distance quickly between you and them and attacking them is much more effect.
---
I use a Sniper Rifle on a few Turrets along the way.
---
I haven‚Äôt gotten nearly as much game time out of any title I‚Äôve bought in the last 10 years. I‚Äôve gotten just about every AAA title too.
---
yeah it‚Äôs very annoying.
---
LOL I never said that was the case, or that it happened or anything. Video proof is all well and good, but it's not hard to make video "proof" be what you want it to be. I merely used legacy weapons as an EXAMPLE because it was the most common thing said to me, personally.
---
Oh wow that‚Äôs so weird but cool. I have some questions tho, what do you even do? Just farm ws and westek? You don‚Äôt do nukes?
---
The yellow hexagons that pop up on the map are event markers. Events pop sometimes when you enter an area, sometimes they pop on the map at random. They disappear after a bit if nobody starts them and a different once pops up. They pop on a different schedule on every server.
---
The event "Fertile Soil" will frequently pop up in the starting town of Flatwoods. Great event for your level. Usually none of the higher level people show up for it, but you can solo it pretty easily. There's also low level events in Morgantown that can all be done solo at your level. 
---
Although, do a few of the events and you won't be level 5 for long. Those events are the fastest way to level at that point in the game.
---
Chem addiction does not happen that frequently, even without the perk that reduces (or eliminates) its chance. To be fair though, Addictol is not super common either, and addiction does not go away on its own.
---
Not directly related, but am I the only one who finds armor not degrading since a while ago (maybe the most recent patch)?
---
Its glitched since Fallout 4, best option is use the lights that require 1 power and place them in direction where enemies appear. Appears light sources help turrets shoot enemies from testing.
---
don't know about you guys but on my private server I'm encountering alot more 3 star stuff than on public servers but they are constantly dropping 1 star gear, anyone else noticed that?
---
I will show you the woooorld! XD
---
Yeah, sorry to come off as rude. Thanks tho
---
As someone with clinical depression, I can say this game, although broken, helps me stay out if that disgusting funk of feeling crappy about myself. I get to escape, and help others who need it in the game. It makes me feel good, and that's why I love it
---
No, int does not give you extra xp...
---
It effects the durability of crafted items and how many materials you can scrap
---
Int **used to** give bonus xp in previous titles
---
And no, luck does not effect your drops or effect your RNG in anyway
---
They're probably on public servers to vend stuff. I split my time about 70/30 between private and public so I can sell some stuff.
---
What‚Äôs your farming route? I‚Äôm curious
---
Just bad lotto, still can get lvl 5 weapons if I'm super unlucky and I'm lvl 270. So in short its RNG if it drops at max lvl.
---
exactly this.
---
It's not hate mongering. They're just reporting on the problems and to everyone else the problems out weight the subpar gameplay. Sure, you're fallout fans so it's worth it for you, and you have fun. Doesn't get rid of the problems with it. Your enjoyment of a game doesn't equate to its quality. Kind of like meth.
---
Exactly this.
---
There is a Dolls Head in the Plug Hole of the Bath at Aarnolt Homestead.
---
Isn't the whole point of a forum to expect dialogue?
---
I think a lot of the issues people have had with the game have made people nicer to each other in game because we know all the bs each other has gone through playing.
---
Ok, thanks I'll give it a go.
---
Interesting. I've not done a whitespring run yet. Working 76 hours a week at the moment so my time is limited. When I next log on I'll head to the golf club and see what happens. I've seen post saying that you need to let the legendaries evolve to 3 star before you whack them otherwise they stay low level. Not sure if that is what is happening with you though.
---
Hell yeah I'd be interested! I guess all the Cod and Halo of my youth has taught me to play one way, and I'm not used to this new way of game styles. I'm not a fan of BR modes that much, but maybe that's because I just suck. My one friend has been playing since season 3 of fortnite and it's taken him that long to really perfect himself to the style and the muscle memory. So it's a skill that is sought after
---
it could be, I'm pretty much one hitting everything at this point. what do they say, that you have to let its health go back up to get a better drop?
---
Is this all versions,  or just PC?
---
Youtube are the new news, get over yourself
---
&gt; I already answered all of this, the same rules do not apply to a multiplayer game as they do to a single player game. Just because you could get away with it before doesn't change that you are allowed to with this game.
---
And as I said, data mining is pretty standard for most games. Including online games. Guild Wars 2 has a pretty popular data miner that the devs know full well about.
---
&gt; Again, point is that no one has a proper vetting process to ensure the claims anyone has that they have valid reasons versus someone who is just using it for duping or whatever.
---
Sure, but notoriety covers that bit mostly. When the same people repeatedly submit reports, you tend to learn who they are.
---
&gt; Terms of service still apply and whether someone likes it or not, it applies to all people. We can't simultaneously be begging Bethesda to fix the issue with hackers ruining the game while giving arbitrary distinction and allowances just because someone claims they're the good guy.
---
Again, intent. You seem to be ignoring that.  and again, when it is the same people repeatedly reporting issues, and their reports are consistently good, while it may not be allowed by the TOS, it is poor form to punish the people trying to help you.
---
This isnt rocket science, but you seem intent on a hardliner "No one breaks the rules ever" path. And by no means am I saying they should be allowed to do whatever they want without consequence, that would be dumb. But if they can look in their logs and see X person, who again is consistently reporting bugs in detail, and they never actually abused the bugs and exploits, then looking the other way on that action is a GOOD THING. Punishing such players only serves to hurt the game because there is no incentive to reporting bugs, and only fear of being banned.
---
Super Mutants seem to no longer have any problem seeing me crouching.
---
Ghouls  need to be on top of me literally.Maybe their Eyes have more radiation damage.
---
It‚Äôs all good man. Just gave u a thoughtful response and u gave me that lol. My bad for repeating myself and overlooking that u had stated ur lvl.
---
I do run fireproof. The only gun I have that can kill myself at close range is my hunters explosive flechette modded Harpoon gun. But thanks for the explanation.
---
Appreciate your logical approach to a conversation, same here I am not trying belittle others, having a different opinion is healthy. 
---
A perfect example could be found if you look around the market. There are fluctuations to the items and the frequency of which people ask for them. Some legacy weapons, let‚Äôs say a explosive energy weapon of some sort, have never been duped and it is highly likely that the particular owner of said weapon(s) will never let said weapon(s) out of their inventory. They do exist, trust me on that.
---
I think eventually very select few spots may be opened up by Bethesda directly for people that they might authorize to do this type of thing but I  think the problem is that people all think that they are the ones who get to make that decision. 
---
Look I'm not a "black and white" only works
---
What‚Äôs your GT?
---
While its glowing green dont touch it at all is what I'm hearing as that is when it's evolving. As soon as you hit it with anything whether you kill it or slap it, it will stop evolving at that point. Not tried it myself or seen video proof but seen plenty of anecdotal evidence.
---
Disappointing that you keep defending this a-hole
---
I've played MMO since 2003. I have always paid a Box price and then a monthly payment. That's just the way it is. 
---
 I guarantee once wastelanders drops they are going to sell a bucket load more copies of the game.  After all it is going to completely change the way the game feels with having NPC's again.
---
 I was never ever going to buy Atom's for anything on the atom stores since none of it interested me.
---
 With the fall out 1st subscription I now have a reason to give Bethesda money each month for me playing their game.
---
 If they ever made the game free to play that's when I will decide not to continue my membership and quit the game.
---
Im 51 and only level 8 on nw and 215 reg play. Best i did was final 8 but play maybe 3 times a month. But it is an ok game
---
All I know is that it has a reliable and easy to use interface and it's always worked for my purposes.  I hear a lot of really good things about Mappalachia so your info is good to know.
---
The thing about mappallachia   is that you see *everything* which is overwhelming and there is no UI - it's just a graphic. FO76Map lets me just see, say acid and fissure sites which is useful when I want to mine acid but NOT be located neat an SB. And doing that just takes me maybe 3 clicks.
---
If you want the original video back for the main menu, the mod is up:
---
When you‚Äôre on I‚Äôll swing over and take a look. PSN Aquaticadventure
---
I thought the caption said "I quit NV" and I was gunna bomb him
---
cheers for the info pal didn't know that. I've noticed alot when I'm one hitting stuff on private server the bodies are dissapearing also. it was alot worse in the mire but has also happened at the golf club before
---
Thanks :) I found some
---
I like what you did there!
---
how 'bout a setting so everyone individually can set what they like?  i dont like stumbling in darkness for half my playtime b/c i cant see some stupid rock/deformation in terrain
---
A few days ago I tried to join a event via fast travel and it just took my caps without sending me anywhere ü§î
---
Because  most of the playerbase has, so I mentioned it.
---
YTers don't get clicks from news, only from NEWS!!!1!
---
Unfortunately, I don't see a way around it.  Can't hardly ban every YTer that spews gossip and half-truths (hell with the new TOS they may be the only ones left before too long).
---
This

Here‚Äôs the build I run at the moment. Feels pretty solid.

Mate, I am (well, was - not playing for couple months) pretty involved in the trading community, and believe me - explosive legacies are among the most duped weapons in game, shy only to handmades. I used to check items on a particular website, to see if there are masses sold for $, and all kinds of TSE, BE, AAE, etc gat plasmas, lasers and rifles are always in abundance. 
---
Now, that's true, that some will stay rare, as no one will bother duping a, I dunno, a troubleshooters explosive ultracite laser rifle - there's no money in it. 
---
Only thing I haven't seen yet - explosive plasma rifle. But I don't think they exist at all.
---
You‚Äôre thinking of the Raider Salute.
---
You know nothing about human behavior if that's really what you think
---
Thank you for all the input!
---
I have bandolier, might swap it in and out.  Until I switched to weightless armor I had an unyielding marine chest with lower ammo weight but now it is a bit of an issue.  I use 50 cal ammo primarily at the moment to feed this instigating explosive hunting rifle.
---
I‚Äôve already decided to go back to level 3 concentrated fire over long shot.
---
I am strongly considering dropping rejuve for rank 2 of ironclad, might go with 1 adamantium and 1 ironclad.  I didn‚Äôt know about the nuka cola stuff!  Holy crap that‚Äôs huge.  I‚Äôm also upon further consideration going to drop marathoner for thru hiker.  I just don‚Äôt run as much anymore.  That‚Äôs a legacy from the old days.
---
I also have tormentor on standby for the exact reasons you described.
---
Thank you again for your reply.
---
There's literally no proof to any of the above mentioned things. It's all RNG.
---
Never!! Haha
---
Ok boomer...lol
---
Shhh... Don't tell everyone! Bulk it and sell it as cloth. I made a fortune from cloth, Acid and the bulk metals. I sell all bulked materials at 22 caps per.  Yes cheap but by selling it that cheap I sell more and like I said, got cap rich and bought every mutation plan from the Enclave bunker. Now, I sell all the Mutation Serums for 266 each and rake it in.
---
No problem. Yeah had a couple of super mutants disappear on me but they were only low level spawns so no problem but would be super pissed if it was a 3 star legendary. I suppose it's only a matter of time üòÇ
---
The Mothman idea would actually just be a sick feature to have. Like if you don‚Äôt move your CAMP often enough, the Mothman comes for you.
---
Lmao ok boofer
---
Get in your Excavator, and take a stroll through lucky hole  mine. 
---
You will end up with between 2-300 lead ore. 
---
Then get some acid. 
---
Smelt.
---
Lead for days.
---
Bad bot!
---
Okay I‚Äôll try it thanks kind man
---
Only going to touch on one thing (mostly because I'm at work!), but I might take bloody mess in luck over supressor in charisma unless you're going bloodied. 5% may nut sound like much but the effect triggers constantly. Also, I tier 5 gunsmith seems excessive (I lied about the one-thing thing). You can swap it out with weapon artisan when repairing. I think I have tier 3, and even with explosive weapons, repairs aren't a huge deal. Occasionally I'll find myself it a small jam as I'm out of adhesive or aluminum, but once you start doing scorched earth, you'll get plenty of advanced repair kits anyways.
---
Or woman
---
I don't know, it's not the first time I've been encountering 1 star drops consistently on private. I'd say 3 or 4 good farming sessions I've had 1 3 star drop out of 10 on a private server but on public, especially in a team we've had 6 or 7 out of 10 a 3 star over multiple sessions. it's become noticable to me
---
Get glowing ore mod
---
Exactly that.
---
Sounds good I‚Äôll add ya when I‚Äôm on again. Like 1-2 hrs from now
---
There was a camp during meat week that blocked off the barrel to start the Prime Cuts event.
---
Marked men would be cool
---
Thanks, see you then
---
Dude... or Dudette... Check out r/fo76FilthyCasuals Totally different game from their view point.
---
I believe it will put you back into the same world for up to 15 minutes.
---
 If you wait longer than that you will get a new server.
---
As for the workshops, if you don't wait past that 15 minutes everything that you have built on your workshop should still be there.
---
 Once you log off for 15 minutes or longer it will all disappear into the void. So you can't log in one day build the workshop then log in the next day and have it still be there.
---
Lucky hole mine is the best place. Use the excavator power armor and you will have 200+ lead ore. The real problem is getting enough acid to smelt it all down. If you don't have a lot of acid you can get lead weights from the Charleston Fire Department's gym, the Flatwoods Gym or the gym at Vault tech University.
---
I have my vending machines hooked up to a switch so I can turn em on and off for this exact reason. Closes a garage door too.
---
Someone used the scrip to caps cheat and dropped excess there.
---
Thanks for the infoüëçüëç
---
Looks solid. 
---
Personally i would put up bloody mess, concentrated fire, or a mix of both rather then glow sight.
---
Also, if you want to try fireproof 2 instead of ghoulish 3. Fireproof 2 and dense chest mod will make you immune to fire, explosions and sb screeches. With ghoulish 3 gone you will then have an addition end point you can move into a diff stat. Possibly get serendipity, blocker, or thevlong range one(forgot name atm).
---
I know a cheeky acid farm but I won‚Äôt tell
---
Completely agree with your statement ‚Äúexplosive legacies are amongst the most duped weapons in the game‚Äù.  
---
Of course I am referring to other top tier weapons, not some kind of ‚Äútroubleshooter‚Äù or ‚ÄúB‚Äù grade weapons. 
---
Unfortunately explosive plasma rifles don‚Äôt exist as they only dropped as 1* legendaries during the time the explosive legendaries were still in the drop pool. 
---
Perhaps I‚Äôve said too much and my intention is not being recognized, just keep in consideration not everyone wants the attention of having a top tier unduped weapon as it brings out snakes in the grass.
---
Unless you ask
---
Or genderless effigy.
---
God, can you imagine how badly your first idea would bug out and wipe most of the player base levels?
---
This is why my camp is in the mountains near the water park.  If you're not searching for it or exploring the mountain tops you probably won't find it without the map.
---
No but as the majority of views or minority(depends on  side of coin your on). We should be directly affecting their viewership. I‚Äôm not saying they need to be hurt for their actions. But spreading lies, hate, false claims, and dividing the player base shouldn‚Äôt be awarded more popularity.
---
maybe you're not sneaking
---
That's awesome keep it up little man
---
Since you are being a sneaky sniper type, I would recommend you drop some of the gunslinger perks in Agility and pick up Dodgy, or Adrenaline.
---
Or move some points to Luck for Bloody Mess
---
To be honest with how many times I have to switch servers looking for a server with my spot open I might just ask. But I get the feeling it‚Äôs bloatfly syringers
---
The ‚Äúhidden‚Äù tag on my screen I am. Even tested in full wood armour with shroud on.
---
The game really does get stale though. And the rng is horrible.
---
If I can get it to work, I can probably make a video of it.
---
When I have the two, crouching causes me to go invisible, but then I'll become visible again a second later, despite Chameleon.  I think this was fixed a couple patches back, though.
---
Think they are there bc pipe revolver and bolt action when modded to a rifle can still use pistol perks to up the damage.
---
No. There‚Äôs a crystal / gold farm inside of an area called Tanagra Town. Inside a bunch of enemies spawn that drop 1-3 waste acid on death. When you hop servers they‚Äôll respawn if no one has killed them already. Ez acid
---
Keep buying one bullet at time. For an hour. Or until they log off. Revenge !
---
I‚Äôm a stealthy bloodied sniper.  Sneak hits seem to be working fine for me today.
---
Xbox one, typo
---
RNG is gonna RNG.
---
Wastelanders is going to be a minor quest that takes 45 minutes and like two choose your own adventure repeatable "conversations". If they were overhauling the game with any crazy stuff they would be announcing it nonstop. Not being totally quite and not mentioning anything
---
And  you got your answer, low level mobs, yield low level rewards.
---
Yikes
---
Is the 3rd perk on the Rifle DR 250? There is a bug associated with that. It usually fixes itself if you reload while sneaking, but that hasn't always been the case for me.
---
Never had a server crash (on my private server), you sure it‚Äôs a server crash and not just game crash?
---
Yea i have used up all characters though, I‚Äôll do a test and figure out which one is the luckiest lol
---
I can do that in about 12 hours from now?i also have the prime reciever plan u looking for
---
ah, makes sense. I figured it was either a different fo game on an older system or you wrote the wrong system.
---
Yes. It seems that the legendary pool of mobs isn‚Äôt dying fast enough for the game generate new mobs or loot.
---
I absolutely agree with #1 and #2. I'm... not sure about #3, 'cause I'm not sure how that holy trinity would fit into F076, let alone Fallout. But I certainly do agree that fight mechanics that require a team would spice the social atmosphere up.
---
I‚Äôll keep trying.
---
Yeah..."server not responding" all the time...that's of course when it's not the game crashing...took me 4 hours to do daily challenges day before yesterday due to server and game crashing/freezing.
---
Nope. Instigating, 10% damage while aiming, and +1 agility. It‚Äôs like this on all my other suppressed weapons.
---
I‚Äôve had it happen to with me being the only one in it
---
Server crash? Did you had something loaded in to any container to verify it was a server crash?
---
NPCs are there to provide single-player content for a single player. In a world where actual players are able to drive content (like EVE Online), you wouldn't necessarily need NPCs do to what the players would already do... provided the necessary systems existed to facilitate this kind of gameplay. 
---
However, in lieu of those systems, yeah, sure, single-player NPCs in a multiplayer world, sure.
---
If you have low perception, you will become disoriented and occasionally get lost.
---
I haven't checked in a while (I've got all I need from it).  If that's true, cool.  But there were people planting themselves their just to be dicks, and I'll have none of that.
---
I had just entered the silo and had the game freeze, throw me out, then place me into a new server
---
But what is proof?  yes in the example you love to mention--people shooting at the sky and killing other players--it would seem pretty obvious.  But I have seen videos posted on other forums where a lot of people are say "hell yes, that player is using aimbot!"  and others basically go on to describe how the same thing can be accomplished by skill alone.
---
And yes, I know you've said upvote and downvote to decide whether or not the video actually shows cheating or not, but it is still just a court of public opinion.  
---
You are focused on just one small aspect of cheating--aiming at the sky--which is probably why you are having trouble seeing how disastrous something like this could be in less obvious cases.
---
They said they're going to do just this with Patch 15

Kids are great at video games, especially if you get them into it early on. I never realized it when I was younger but I've known for a while now that my uncle only used to only let me play the parts he sucked at in video games.
---
Your criticism is valid. My play-time has been limited, but I feel (and you agree, so &lt;3) that a big thing holding FO76 back from being a decent game would be systems that bring players together, and other players against those players. 
---
It's a damn shame that we're a year into 76 and I still can't join up with the player-driven BoS faction and smash some player-driven raider faction.

I have a mic. I also have a keyboard. Thanks, Blizzcon 2018.
---
I only have a couple heavy guns and Last Action Hero is one of them.  Nice weapon especially for the queen
---
I'm having some issues too. Getting a lot of lag ( among other things) in busy areas which I find surprising as I'm the only one there. I subscribed for the game play positives such as loot, junk and enemies always being there and not having to server hop to find them as well as having a supposedly more stable server. Never bothered with the atom shop except for free stuff or spending atoms I earned in the game but I can take it or leave it.
---
Your rebuttal is weird, insomuch -his- interaction with us was just as limited as -our- interaction with him. Neither of us were using mics. Ultimately, yeah, it sure would've been nice to have been using a mic, but we weren't using our mic, and neither was he, and in this day and age where all of us are having a healthy discussion about what F076 needs and doesn't need via the keyboard, I still feel the keyboard is a useful tool for the exchange of information.

Like, I don't know,  John ny Cash maybe? The song on fo4 and that of the above mentioned artist are miles apart. Johnny did a 9 inch nails cover called "Hurt", and that's what he'd do while turning over in his grave if he ever heard the version on fo4! Lol
---
The idea is that you don't want your goodies going to someone who's going to use them for evil, or who doesn't deserve them.  You don't reward bad behaviour, or it gets worse.
---
It's not just cheat engine, I'd imagine. Though I think they need to do personally, is devise a way to detect who is actually cheating with third party programs. And who is actually doing beneficial things like finding major flaws in the code. Like security risks, and other things that users have helped find.
---
Recently learned from one of Juicehead's videos that apparently many of those good users of cheat engine and shit were actually banned as of late though. Despite the fact that the only things they were known for doing was being completely transparent in their actions of simply datamining and helping out. Not malicious cheating. It's a damned shame, really.
---
I think it would be difficult. Also the game size will be colossal I suppose..
---
Atom cats lol. Ever play fo4?
---
  Yea this is true, perhaps with the upcoming system, this will be possible for sure.

To be fair it‚Äôs like a brave new world for me hahaha

---
I have no idea what Scorched Earth is, but i'm excited to get there!
---
Looks pretty good!
---
The bugs aside, and there's a lot less of them now... It's a really fun game and I'd bet the people complaining the loudest have over 1000 hours played. It can get frustrating when a bug effects your game, but for all that it offers. It's fantastic!!
---
There's two secret passages down there too, the first of which has more Lead nodes, the second has a big surprise for ya! Bring extra pants...

I‚Äôve had an issue in private worlds where when I nuke Whitesprings 90% of the enemies won‚Äôt spawn. They‚Äôre just gone.
---
wouldnt the ban mean bethesda is already aware of the exploit and didnt need to be told? clearly they noticed the exploit and took action against players that used it, the next step is actually fixing it but the dataminers were 2 steps behind and started "testing" a bannable exploit that bethesda already knew about.
---
Yea that‚Äôs gunna be a no from me dawg.

What platform are you on? I think I might‚Äôve buzz crashed one time in private so far. That‚Äôs after many many hours of playing.

It's bizarre. I specifically chose my camp location because there was nothing there, and multiple times I've found people who have their camp in the same spot. I'm not talking just the edge of their camp intersects with mine, I mean the building is exactly where mine is.

Sometimes it bugs out and gets crazy shaky for me. Getting out and back in power armor helps but in general I sort of like the effect. Makes me wish we had more power armor movement skills like a power rush or a slam or something.
---
They said there would be sub factions in each group. I assume BOS, Free States, &amp; Responders would be part of the settler faction and Enclave, Cultists, &amp; Trappers would be part of the raider faction. Since BOS builds firebases and stuff, and modus just hangs out in his HQ hijacking botstops to send out raiding parties.

Two Shot has garbage accuracy, I never use it personally. Furious all the way.

Because they play with open comms blasting some awful techno shit.  Added bonus is if they follow you around with their boocha-boocha-boocha-boocha-WOB-WOB-boocha-boocha-boocha to the point that you can't hear anything else in the game.
---
Just Brotherhood of Steel paints, your only other alternative is to look in the atom shop unfortunately
---
You only need to substain for farming and have a go to boss build that you can swap to. My rifle build is a lot like yours but 100% dmg, it also have commando and agi for pvp. (Which is pretty useless now) on main I farm with a combat knife and kill bosses with 2 hand or heavy gunner (sometimes I dont even bother and stick with the knife lol)
---
Very interesting. You stayed undiscovered the hole event?
---
I got a zealot‚Äôs explosive -90% weight from the legendary vendor once. It‚Äôs pretty good imo.

When first logging in or exiting power armor, reloading speed buffs are seemingly not taken into account. Switching weapons back and forth fixes this issue for me.

You're under a mistaken impression that the rating on games is some kind of "rule". Which, it is not.

It is up to the parent to decide when/if/how their child is mature enough to play whatever game, or what types of media they have access to. Your insulting condescension towards the original poster, shows you lack understanding, or respect for that choice. Frankly, holding any system put into place by old, white, out-of-touch congressmen, such as Lieberman and Kohls of all people, as some shining ideal, is ridiculous, and not deserving of anything but disrespect.

I'm on xbox one. I have no hatred toward the game whatsoever. I just have thinning patience with the stability of the game on my end. I work a ton of hours and this is my one escape to de-stress...but has been exactly the opposite. So I have been playing NW instead, which I love, but seems like I have wasted my $ on my Fallout First membership. But I do appreciate the atoms and scrap box....so I guess there's mixed feelings. But my annoyance heavily outweighs my happiness, and that is why I pray that talking about this will help Bethesda fix this amazing game.
---
What was your lvl again?
---
There's not a Deathclaw down Lucky Hole Mine nah, it's much much more crazy. It's not anywhere else in the game too. You Xbox?
---
That is unfortunate. Those skins are pricey. Thx
---
It won't stop the people who cheat just to ruin your day.
---
I'd be fine with it just materializing my CAMP when the guy in my spot logs off, but It doesn't... Just be happy it doesnt pack up your entire CAMP and put it all in the stored tab so you have to rebuild it again like it used to.
---
Ps4 :/
---
Not exactly. It is not unheard of for game devs to ban people who actually reported the exploit... for exploiting.
---
Enjoy the feeling of exploring the world and being afraid of the creatures in it.  It is a unique part of the experience that will come to an end when you reach higher levels and can kill most anything that comes your way.
---
I remember the good old days, when myself and a friend spent 30 minutes downing our first Scorchbeast that attacked my camp in this super safe area we found called Whitesprings.  Broke all our guns but it felt good.  Now... it's one of the most dangerous areas in the game and I solo hunt those flying assholes for fun because the only thing that scares me now is that they might turn the servers off eventually.  
---
My advice it to find a high level player that can at least get you a starter set of gun/ammo/water/armor/radaway, and don't be afraid to run if you enter an area you are not ready for (at some point you will reach the outer boundary for that enemy and they will turn back).
---
I can give you directions if you can't find the secret passages ;)
---
ESO vet here, spent a lot. not as much as BDO tho. FO76 actually cost me nothing until the ranger armor dropped.
---
To my knowledge taking undiluted Rad-X or Radaway can damper your mutations temporarily.
---
Rad-X is the one, but none of us take it
---
Oh, it‚Äôs definitely great. Even with daily play, it would take someone new at least six months to do everything with ESO+.
---
there will always be false accusations you literally can't fix that 
---
this game has no anti cheat the only way for bethesda to punish cheaters is with video proof
---
That‚Äôs a good idea.
---
This is a crazy amount of work you're asking for. You're going to need to pay more than $20 a month for it.
---
im not happy but what else is there to do? i don't want to see this game mode die
---
at least with people seeing the rampant cheating going on it might light a fire under bethesdas ass 
---
will there innocent people be harmed? sure but theres nothing a janitor can't fix
---
its not the best solution by far but i would like the whole world to see the cancer this game is going through
---
i said video proof but okay
---
 do be an ass
---
Man ima get my son to do it for ne aswell i cant even land a kill lmao. Nice work young fella
---
I totally agree, reason is probably simple... they made bloodied so overpowered and being a tank with less then 20% hp is a real think what allows to make dps tank build what shouldn‚Äôt be possible.
---
You're right. It is up to the parent, and it is these types of parents throwing fits about "games being the reason of violence" when parents don't know how to say no to their kid playing a mature rated game. But yall do you, lol. This game is ded anyways. xD
---
Our group is also a little threadbare nowadays. Same psn as name here,  2 or 3 die- hards on alot, 4 or 5 more casual.  Feel free to join us, we kick ass and still have fun.
---
Try and verify game files. I haven‚Äôt had one crash on a private server. Hopefully that helps.
---
Sounds like a good time! Ill add you
---
Was suggesting to have the game simply check before even loading us into a server months ago but people deemed simply checking before loading to be more resource demanding than people continuosly server hopping
---
Any evidence of this? Not seen a single one...

I didn't noticed this glitch because I use a gatling plasma, so I don't reload that much, but my Healing Factor mutation is acting weird lately, sometimes it takes forever to kick in and restore my health even when there's no enemy or anything nearby for a good amount of time. I'm using way more Stimpaks since a week ago than I was used to use...

Be on in a few hours, will accept or send you an invite!
---
From your description, here are the points of your personal and group play style that I can see, so my recommendations will take these into account:
---
1. You play mainly with friends, which is why you each run a shared CHA perk, and no Lone Wanderer.
---
2. You are playing a glass-cannon build that relies on staying in stealth to help out your teammates -  who I assume will be taking more of a front-line role - and deliver strong surgical hits to mobs.
---
3. You don't like to use VATS
---
4. You are playing with mutations - which likely means that at least one other of your group uses mutations as well. (You may want to add the mutations that you want to be using on the build planner if you are looking for advice in that area as well.
---
1 point in STR is fine when you have others who can help carry heavy loot, especially if you have a Possum backpack.  You may want to look at what ammo you need to carry, and if 45% less ammo weight is more than the flat +10 carry weight that Strong Back would give you.
---
15 PER is great for the perk-stacking pipe sniper, and your perk choices here look solid.  The only option I would mention would be to swap in 1 point in Concentrated Fire and go down to 2 in Glow Sight (sadly this means you would need to devote 2 more levels to getting 2 Glow sight since you cant downgrade perks).  Even though you don't like VATS and can likely headshot/limbshot manually, it combines really well with the Tormentor (Luck) perk for more consistent crippling of certain large creatures.  If you have a shotgun player with Enforcer in your group, ignore this.
---
As you get into the later game, you will find that you have TONS of stimpacks sitting around, so Ghoulish is less effective. You may consider changing Ghoulish for a combination of 2 Fireproof and 1 Sun Kissed. As mentioned in another comment, with a Dense chest mod you will be effectively immune to fire and explosions (i.e. scorchbeast shenanigans), and you will slowly recover from radiation, minimizing the need for Radaway.  Yes, you will not proc rad sponge for your friends if you have no rads, but if you are in a situation where they need that rad regen, your Sun Kissed wont be fully taking away the rads you will also be getting during that time.  Or just become a Cannibal. Eat a body, sate your hunger, get some rads, Sponge your friends. Everyone wins!
---
So you need 9 points in CHA to share a rank 3 Rad Sponge?  Check.  Suppressor is great to help your team, but Tenderizer doesn't need the full 3 ranks since you are only getting an additional +1% damage (+4% total counting all team members) for the 2nd and 3rd ranks, and you should be easily reapplying it within 3-5 seconds. If at least 1 other person in your team is also running the mutations suite (Starched Genes + Class Freak) you NEED to find a place for Strange in Numbers. I recommend putting it in next to rank 2 Tenderizer. Squad Maneuvers can also be good as a sniper because additional speed/mobility allows you to run around the battlefield and get into a better position without running through the middle of the fight and getting spotted.  Now where would you get those extra perk points...?
---
INT. Having 8 perk points dedicated to weapon degradation is too much. Drop Gunsmith and move 3 points somewhere else (Keep 5 INT if you want so that you can still equip Gunsmith at CAMP to craft more complicated guns for your team).  The remaining 2 points can go somewhere else like First Aid.
---
15 AGI is a must for a piper-sniper. I personally prefer taking the 2 points from Master Sandman and putting them into the last ranks of Master/Expert Gunslinger.  My reasoning is that Mister Sandman - while granting a bigger overall damage bonus of 50% sneak dmg vs. 10% static damage - is only counted when sneaking AND at night.  So at most, it will only be active 50% of the time.  If you are spotted it becomes even less.
---
Finally, Luck.  Since you don't want to use VATS, many of the perks here are irrelevant, but I would recommend taking 3 ranks in Bloody Mess.  It gives you a flat 15% damage to all of your attacks, and sometimes you get to watch things explode into chunks. Who doesn't like that?
---
As far as weapon choices go, Lone snipers do really well with Instigating, but it will be less effective for you in a group where you don't control all aspects of engagement. Bloodied is top if you want to go with a true glass-cannon build. Otherwise, Executioner's (since your teammates will often get baddies below 40% health), Junkie's, if you don't mind juggling addictions, or Mutant's are all good weapon prefixes. Alternately, something with Suppressor's would free up 3 charisma ranks that you could use on something else.  Like Squad Maneuvers, or Strange in Numbers...
---
Armor choices include Unyielding for a Bloodied build, or Chameleon for full-health + support.  There are more nuances here, but I'll let someone else throw a wall of text for that one.
---
Hope this helps!
---
&gt; will there innocent people be harmed? sure but there's nothing a janitor can't fix
---
Let me tell you a personal story pertaining to why I'm so deadset against this, Frank.  My wife was once caught up in something very similar; she got pulled into a witch hunt dragnet, even though she did absolutely nothing wrong.  Her real life identity was found and shared. She constantly received emails and/or posts on social media with her picture superimposed on extremely graphic crime scene photographs, was constantly berated in the cruelest most viscous ways and told she should do the human race a favor and kill herself... at the height of it all, they even discovered where she worked and started sending outright lies to her boss and coworkers, endangering her employment.
---
Mob mentality builds upon itself and stokes the fires until there's a raging inferno.  And I would much rather a game mode die than for even one person to go through a fraction of what she endured.

wasn't that guy exposed for using cheat engine ?

im pretty sure the game detecting cheat engine got banned rather than him reporting to bethesda

I‚Äôm 44 , I‚Äôm level 140 in nuc winter , and I win a lot . But I also have a really good team , having 4 friends all mic‚Äôd up is important, you would be surprise how many older people are on fallout , after all our generation created video games ,
---
Not in that way no but you can still be really annoying
---
I‚Äôm glad we don‚Äôt allow it. He-said-she-said is a terribly explosive dynamic. 
---
I got ‚Äúnamed and shamed‚Äù in a Facebook group for adventure mode pvp defending my own workshop and the guy made it out like I was manipulating game mechanics to steal his caps. The dude just kept seeking revengeüòÇ
---
I don't disagree with you, but having to pay for that experience.. not everyone can afford to jump on everything they are interested in.  Also, most people actively follow multiple franchises, enjoy multiple genres etc.
---
When it comes down to it, I can't purchase just anything, and i want everything.  So, i have criteria for games to meet to get a purchase from me.  
---
\-First off, is it buggy?  If i can only afford to buy, as an example, 2 games in one month, and these games are what i'm purchasing for enjoyment while i'm at home relaxing instead of working, i don't want the time spent that month on a game to be QA testing.  Fun and Quality fun are two different things, a simple game crash can turn all that enjoyment into a temporary frustration.  I also don't look forward to the job portion - bug reporting.  Data entry jobs suck.
---
\-Second; Monetization.  Ever notice games with dlc costumes and such, the stuff being sold tends to be way better then the stuff in-game?  That's by design, and that's the problem for someone who doesn't have a lot extra to spend.  Even cosmetic 'micro'transactions tells me they aren't making the game itself the best it can be, and with that i don't have the money to just drop $10 on a single game skin.  On the flipside, if it's a live service game that needs to keep running, I understand the need for monetization and cosmetic items are definitely preferred over many of the alternatives.  It's less a question about if the company is scummy and more a question of is the base game worth my time?
---
\-Lastly;  Fun Factor.  Yeah, basic and simple, is the game fun.  Much like the comment i'm replying to, this is the portion i take with a grain of salt.  My favorite game franchise is the Tales of Series, which isn't widely popular in the west.  The fan-base is small, but they would of course actively tell me the series is good and will give recommendations of which game to start with.  While the larger majority will often say it's a "typical" jrpg and nowhere near Final Fantasy level.  In the end, the metrics you need here are your own, buy the game and try it.
---
However, Christmas and birthdays are a thing.  Sometimes your trying to get information about something you know nothing about, like a particular game and your not even a gamer.  Experiencing it yourself is actually worst then asking someone in the field, because someone who hasn't ever played a board game enjoys monopoly the first time they play it.  I had SO much fun with call of duty 1 up until modern warfare 2.  Game is stale now, and the franchise has gone in a direction today that makes it far less appealing then a port would be.
---
&gt;If you are coming in here to hate on this don't post at all. There are enough useless viscera spewing trolls flooding this community anyway
---
Here, let me get you a bigger soap box.
---
Listen dude, as far as it goes, the 1st subscription covers not just a private world, but a forward deployable camp, a bottomless junk stash, and limited time outfits and emotes and etc. The system employed now is no more a means than to continue funding for a game that is guaranteeing free content on the DLC sized scale, and for a game that promised FREE continuous content, to which it has supplied, and met 100% to this promise.
---
But everyone expected EVERYTHING to be free, and that's where everyone fell short on themselves, the game is a MMO with a fallout theme. Plain and simple. To rent out servers to store individual data like junk storage that unlimited and a PRIVATE WORLD that allows you substantially better play time for yourself and others, and the ability to baton the world off to another 1st user if you decide to leave, costs money to uphold and maintain alone. To continue content creation takes money to staff the creators that will make it.
---
People who subscribe for the price tag get their compensation in the in-game currency, crunch the numbers and see for yourself.
---
Am I saying that's good enough, no, but it eases the pain in the ass you feel for forking it over to enjoy a world without hackers, dupers who literally just dupe to crash the servers at this rate, and griefers mad about survival mode being removed.
---
As a whole trying to drag net the positives for this is a pain itself, 1st is a good way to ensure the longevity of fans who are willing to dedicate to the long haul and their requests are met, is it the best alternative, not in my opinion, but I'll take it over dealing with jerks online and everything else dude.
---
Well if you ever need a carry I can have my 9 year old jump online. Haha
---
I have had the game crash a few times. However a bluescreen is a much more serious issue. There should be nothing the game can do to cause a bluescreen. You might want to look at the actual error in the bluescreen to figure out the problem and get it fixed. The game can be intensive at times and one of my friends machines started bluescreening while playing the game. It turned out the problem is that a fan in his machine had failed and the cpu was getting FAR too hot. He ended up having to replace the fan and redo the thermal paste.
---
I didn't say anything about reporting it, they did the exploit and immediately got a ban, not after they reported it. That would mean Bethesda detected it and already was banning accounts using it. Data miner assistance wasn't needed here.
---
oh just every time I press the trigger
---
Lol what system ?
---
Xbox
---
A single client polling servers like that would shit on the already shitty netcode. 
---
They won't ever do that as its a high level change to how it works.
---
You connect then check the spot, not check spots until you find one then connect
---
That's true. And maybe that comes tomorrow. I didn't get the original video file sooner or this mod would have been out sooner. Now I sort of want to collect the videos on that page as an archive, and then people could choose the one they want.
---
That's just your internet connection.
---
Huh? I‚Äôve never seen this
---
YES I AM. At least before when I would get lucky enough to find a 3* it would drop a 3 star item. The last couple weeks 4 out of 5 times it‚Äôs dropping one star item. It sucks.
---
First of all telling toxic people to stay away from a post with civil intent is not being on a soap box at all. It is kindly telling them to not pollute a thread with their typical brand of communication.
---
Secondly, the thing about it is Private Worlds function the way the game should've at release, the way the game was advertised and the way an actual game is meant to function.
---
In a Private World you don't have to wait upwards of 10+ seconds for loot to spawn on enemies, you don't have to wait crucial moments for your weapons to be drawn, and enemies die WHEN YOU KILL THEM instead of seconds after you make the final shot. With Bethesda doing nothing about hacking and the constant reintroduction of duping exploits and the like it is 100% wrong of them to force people to pay for a functional version of the game. They even admitted in Australia that the game marketing was misleading and is in actuality a broken mess which is all legally recorded.
---
Private Worlds fixes a lot of the game in terms of functionality and they shouldn't have put it behind a paywall. That is unforgivable. Take out the Private Worlds and the Fallout 1st program is still worth the money, and people will still pay for it.
---
Yea different system , but I have definitely met some young kids that were really good , and then there are the sqeekers that I have to shut of my head set lol
---
COD and Halo provide some of the most critical skills necessary to win in NW. One of the biggest problems people have in NW is the ability to get a shot on target. A majority of Fallout players are dependent on VATS, which is an aimbot/hack/cheat in any other game. NW doesn't offer VATS for PvP combat, which leaves the Fallout loyalists at a disadvantage. The people with first-person shooter or Battle Royale backgrounds have an automatic leg up! Fortunately, there's a way to practice this. Even I had to retrain myself how to hit a moving target back in my COD days
---
you'd think the private server would be best for farming but it really isn't. probably gonna be a deal breaker for me keeping my subscription
---
i said video proof in other comments
---
Basically I died once because I got to close, because I thought I could maybe do a bit more damage closer. It one shot me. 
---
But in genera it just stood there, I also had no issues with the robots.
---
They are not recycled public servers.
---
Haha I know that place! It's a good place to have a set of power armor for some real fun!
---
Haha I hear that! He was playing with the mic muted last night and it‚Äôs a good thing cause when they won he got LOUD.
---
Like it's not racist at all but discriminatory nevertheless. Yet the internet dares to get the two mixed up. Never said it was a good joke.
---
I went back on about an hr ago and thought fuck it I'll give it another go and put the exactly where I wanted to yesterday and it finally let me put it right next to the wall without putting it on the roof. Maybe when you log back in give it another go might work for you too. GL
---
There would be a backup system in place for innocents that get wiped. Remember NW is completely separate from the rest of 76. Innocents would have to prove that they where not cheating.
---
Because the nuke killed the NPCs that were there when it hit. Have another player join or relog into your private session, or relog with an alt toon to respawn NPCs into the irradiated blast zone. 
---
The same thing happens on a public server, but you don't have to coordinate other players to enter the area - they get the launch notification, arrive, and the NPCs respawn.
---
What the fucks it even supposed to mean?
---
You learn from videos by having someone qualified guide you through the basics. You take those lessons and practice them on your own, and then you learn the next lesson. Rinse and repeat.
---
Some of the people I've taught already have started off hiding in bushes and panicking every time there's a noise nearby. Now they're like a team of Special Forces, staying calm and coordinated in the heat of battle. You have to gradually unlearn bad habits and replace them with instinctual muscle memory. When shit hits the fan, you rely on your muscle memory to guide you, while your rational brain processes the big picture.
---
Given the rate atoms can be earned in the game 50 atoms is *a lot* for just one overseer point. It'll most likely be, if it'll ever be possible, 5 tickets for 10 atoms, like the "Level up 5 more times" challenge but with the 10 atoms instead of a perk pack.
---
Thats why i said to add an option for it. :) so people who like it can still use it but people who cant handle it can turn it off and we can all be happy in power armor. :)
---
I dont block people. 
---
They may change. 
---
I can always just server hop if someone is harassing me.
---
Blocking is not good for business.   Just because I dont want to play with you, doesnt mean I dont want your caps.
---
Your location compared to other players locations, anytime youre in the air longer than a few seconds, shooting thru a wall, etc would be red flags for the anti cheat engine.
---
Like if you shoot and kill a player from across the map, the ACE would flag the player for the session, if the ACE has enough proof that the player was cheating then all progress is wiped.
---
Been happening to me all weekend, on Xbox One.
---
Oh yeah I get a blue screen every gaming session not to mention freezing in menus, sound cutting out etc. A buggy pile of shat but I like it. I wonder if fallout first subscribers experience less crashes, bug?
---
This game blue screens for me daily and did so over the course of two different systems.
---
It's done this to me as well. Another favorite of mine at the moment is clicking on an area to fast travel and turning my attention elsewhere whilst the game loads me in, right? Wrong. Its just backed out completely and I'm standing there stairing off into space. So, I bring up the map again, fast travel and back to gameplay.... Wtf? Walk forward 10 steps and try again and now I can fast travel...
---
I just launched my first nuke and nuked Whitespring for the ghoul loot, and found it all dead on my private server. Now I know why.
---
If I'm convinced of my honest opinion I don't delete anything. This commenter deleted not only his comments but his whole account as well. That does look a bit dodgy to me.
---
May I ask? Have you read the comments or are you just here to sound snarky? Because...
---
&gt;Imagine being so insecure
---
&gt;What a horrible, lonely existence...
---
I really wonder what this has to do with my mental state or social status and how you think you know or are you merely projecting?
---
Solo is harder, but it's possible to take on a whole team in a firefight by yourself. Instead of relying on your team to take the heat off of you, you use grenades, terrain, and world objects (trees, cars, houses, etc) to manage your opponents. 
---
Sometimes it does make sense to disengage. If I'm solo fighting another squad with players equal to my own skill level, I'm not going to try to take them on all at once. I'll disengage, regroup, and take them on under my own terms.
---
where did you find out about it?
---
I had a pretty bad experience with private servers as well. Overall they don't feel more stable, and they're not persistent, so it does make you wonder just what you're paying for.
---
At this point I can't recommend them to anyone, but time will tell us if they're worthwhile or just a cynical cash grab.
---
Yeah, we have already seen it in one of the videos where they talked about F76's future, so it seems very likely.
---
PS4
---
Just curious, how do you know? Has Bethesda ever released any information telling us what kind of servers they are and how they differ from public servers?
---
Okay, but this was PS4
---
You mean all those freeloaders that never got the game that was promissed to them for the $60 they all paid? Many of whom in pre order.
---
What weapons would it actual effect besides the bow since crossbow is currently classed as a rifle and the black powders are classed as rifles or pistols. As for the plasma weapons they would be under their respective rifleman/commando/heavy gunner perks
---
What games do you recommend that are similar? I don't know of a more enjoyable multiplayer game on console.
---
Good times. Good times. Always telling ourselves that someday we'll be back to playing as well as we did in ye ol' Halo days of yesteryear, the prime of our gaming prowess in high school. Lol.
---
one of us one of us
---
Well the Australians can have whatever laws or rules they want, I have no say in them I‚Äôm Canadian. I know Canadian laws don‚Äôt entitle anyone to a refund.
---
Are there even any numbers on how many refunds were handed out? and just because some people wanted a refund, does not make it a bad game, I once saw someone eat an entire pizza at pizza hut and then ask for a refund because it wasn‚Äôt hot enough lol.  It just means people will try and get money anyways possible, a story as old as time and not unique to Fallout or Bethesda. 
---
But like I said, you can have any opinion you want about the game, just don‚Äôt try to force your opinion on others who clearly disagree with you.
---
So why are you on this subreddit then?
---
It's free, what do you expect?
---
They'll probably release more perk cards in the future. It is still in BETA.
---
First we gonna ROCK, Then we gonna ROLL
---
Then we let it POP, GO LET IT GO
---
I'm hoping Bethesda doesn't share your opinion and actually buff the useless weapons and weapon styles, which is so many that most players use the same 2 builds.
---
MAYBE they will temporarily swap out a few cards for 1 specific situation. At most.
---
Still better than that Star Citizen crap failgame...
---
I wish shotgun didn't do super bad damage though, kind of sucks how there is less build variety than at launch.
---
My guess is that they would change crossbow to be exotic instead, then maybe add enough mods and variety to these two to make it worth it. Perhaps it could also boost things like throwing knives, tomahawks and similar throwing weapons.
---
wait what was the fix?
---
I can do it if you're on xbox and have the flux.
---
Because I enjoy it. 
---
Just because you dislike it doesn't mean everyone else does. 
---
And  you would be correct, people that visit a subreddit for a video game, usually play the video game. 
---
Also, this is a very very small percentage of the playerbase, most of whom dont use reddit.
---
So thank you for your thoughts.  You can kindly leave now, your kind already tried to destroy the community, we dont want to restart old confllicts.
---
Give me 2-3 minutes and I'll add you. Also can you do the Sam efor me?
---
If you're thinking in terms of all at once, yea. you gotta figure they got all the data to jus reface the already made map land structures or whatever from the older games.
---
It would be sick if they just kept adding full maps every couple years.
---
Exactly~‚úì
---
Fallout first member here. Bethesda needs to reserve stable servers for private worlds, after all we're the ones who are paying them additional premium money.
---
I had an unfortunate incident yesterday where my team had all died. I managed to kill 12 of the remaining 13 players in the game. I was on track to kill the last player, when the SB turned his attention to me. While fighting him, I fell off a cliff and died. Sometimes people do keel over and die, but those other 12 guys needed my assistance.
---
Of course! What is your ign?
---
Who'd have thought that people in a subreddit for something would be more likely to participate in it. Did you know that water is wet?
---
Not when it was used on me I had to turn it off and Tesla the crap out of them kinda gave me false hope I might be ok at pvp but nah they just sucked.
---
oh I was just holding those for a friend.  tell ya what I'll cut you say 40% finders fee
---
Geneziza_Sicken you should receive invite soon.
---
Thank you very much! And sorry for the mess I made, this is a NW character. :)
---
I'm hearing quite a bit of interest. Looks like I'm gonna have to make this thing happen.
---
I'd prefer to see all cheaters placed in matches with only other cheaters and with all xp removed from the matches.  Let them have fun finding out who the best exploiter is.
---
What I did was the rug glitch but I blueprint it, then did it that way.
---
nah not your fault
---
I already traded the legendary for scrip but now I‚Äôm wishing I didn‚Äôt, it was a regenerating raider leg and would‚Äôve paired nicely with my other Regen leg and chest
---
Not as long as there are hacker on pc.And even after that devs won't grant your wish as they want people to buy atoms.
---
I'd rather have what you suggest but with scrips. But even then you still have the hackers issue.
---
The problem I have with a lot of these "Bethesda needs to..." sort of posts is that instead of working on self-improvement, players on Reddit expect Bethesda to fix self-inflicted problems, nerf everything, or give out freebies. Those same people then complain that Bethesda doesn't fix the game. Instead of taxing Bethesda with their complaints and demands, they should take some personal responsibility and solve some problems on their own. Let Bethesda fix this mess.
---
welp now you have something to grind for.  better see an update when you get it.
---
Was this in the game, I don‚Äôt remember ever hearing it and I had the radio on constantly during release
---
you don't need both gunsmith and licensed plumber, I'd free up 3 ranks to take bloody mess.
---
Thank you!!!
---
Some people pvp in this game because they enjoy it, you can't get mad at them for that.
---
using 3rd party software on fallout 76 is a violation of the t.o.s. 5, do so at your own risk.
---
have fun! :)
---
Beats me.
---
Come on now, this could not happen with in fallout 76! Lmao. 
---
Just kidding! 
---
I am kind of surprised that you haven't had a bunch of idiot's trying to question this issue with in the game. 
---
Trying to argue with you about it actually happening. Because there seems to be a lot people stating that there are no issues, or glitches within fallout 76 a late. 
---
I had this similar experience happen a few months ago, not to mention, I could not fast travel to my camp aswell. 
---
But after posting anything on here about the issues I have witnessed over the last year. 
---
I get down voted, and more or less, I am told I am full of shit, just like the  software company that made this broken down golf cart. Lol. 
---
I hope that this so called issue resolves itself on it own, because we should not speak of such things. 
---
Fallout 76 is in a perfect state after year one. 
---
I wish you, and everyone the best.
---
well, you did ask for people to fight you when you told people not to. 
---
The easiest way to get someone to flame your post on the internet, is to tell them not to. 
---
Your rant will fall on deaf ears, because noone wants to hear your gripes.  That was 3 weeks ago, the soapbox went back to youtube.  You should too.
---
Oo
---
Well ya see, I was torn between having that perk or keeping my 3 star other leg with reduced weapon weight, breathing under water and having better defense against animals which honestly is more like a two star depending on your perks as my primary piece. I can never remember to make a secondary, Ive been looking to make an anti robot suit through for when I go to launch nukes
---
What are they then?
---
Melee is very, very far from being the "only" viable end game approach.  
---
Damage immunity bug persists though it seems to be a lot less common and might be specific to combos of platform + weapon + perks.  
---
TSE in general was nerfed heavily and tse shotguns are no longer supreme.  
---
Duping still exists though it's less ubiquitous and players do get banned from time.  
---
Performance is improved dramatically compared to launch, but it's still far from other more stable games out there.
---
With the two main strategies in NW (prey or predator), it's kind of a choice of "watching paint dry" in the bushes or "heat-seeking missile."
---
Yay! So glad I could help!
---
Performance is still trash on xbox one x its literally like a dice roll hang ups and still glitches not as bad as launched 
---
 Just had Morgantown airport not loading in correctly today objects popping in and out as I walk around and while in a building the whole make was just a flat hill texture.
---
This is happened to me on numerous occasions I thought it was me accidently clicking on the wrong spot but after a dozen times I realised it was another bug to add to the list.
---
Usually a fragile ego kind of statement. 
---
Like if somebody is always announcing they are the manager at work. Comes off to me as they are insecure of stated position.
---
I don't see what adding even more map will do.  The map is huge enough as it is and players are very frequently spread out to the point where you only find other players by actively seeking them out or participating in events.
---
Tons of areas are rather open ended and could be expanded on.  The closed off rooms at whitesprings, the presidential bunker in the enclave, all the cultist areas, the atlas experiment, there's just a ton of seeds of ideas all around appalachia that I'd rather see expanded on.
---
Plus the game needs more activities like end game dungeons and raids, endgame crafting, etc a lot more than it needs more acreage.
---
Also adamantium skeleton...I have bloodied explosive combat shotgun and it wrecks things, but even with dense or fireproof, I kept crippling myself
---
Yeah I‚Äôve also has terrible luck legendary hunting on private servers.
---
I have the exact opposite.  no chameleon effect or mutation but all sneak perks.  when I crouch, I hear the chameleon effect, I disappear, then reappear.  I used to have chameleon gear up until 25, but that was a hundred something levels ago.  feels like the fallout chameleon glitch with agility over 14.  we couldn't see our pip boys or maps.
---
I recently discovered this and it's one of my favorites.
---
Well idk how this broke you this has been common since launch.
---
&gt; They could easily let us host servers client-side like most games do 
---
And decimate the earning from the Atom Store with free mods? This Bethesda?
---
You haven't really thought this through, have you?
---
I agree with you.  I too was skeptical of what FO76 would even be as it seemed like such a departure from previous Fallouts but once I started to play it, I grew to love it.  It's such a unique game in that it's FPS, open-world, MMOish, RPG, survival, PvE/PvP, and building things all rolled into one and there's nothing else quite like it.  Plus, the franchise itself and all its lore just makes the game world so cool and fun to play in.  But, the game is kinda niche and a person's experience with it is basically whatever they choose to make of it.  However, I enjoy having that freedom and I think its the aspect of Bethesda games I enjoy the most.  I understand people wanted more story and human NPCs and hopefully Wastelanders and/or FO5 can deliver that.  My only hope is that all the negativity that FO76 received doesn't prevent a new FO game like 76 in the future.
---
just run some Bo's quests down at watoga you'll get something
---
it happens in NW ,i sometimes get painfully slow reloads
---
Steel, Wires, and COMMUNISM
---
100% agree
---
I love nobody's fault bu mine. F'I DON'T HEAR IT MY soull be lost
---
Lol well this answers my question
---
final fantasy cross play magic vs mayhem
---
I would push back on this. The predatory teams don't get "wounded" and weakened as they clear out the map. We get stronger. We acquire the best armors in the best conditions. We get our preferred chems, weapons, ammo, stealth boys, etc. For the brief moments where some of us may need to swap gear, the strongest of us stand guard and draw attention to ourselves. If you attack our weakest member(s), we wipe you from existence before you can finish the job.
---
Typically, you want the best players on the server dead in the first 2 minutes of the game.
---
I just don't use them. I use the oil street lamps (I think that's what they are called.)
---
Just nuke the mother fuckers, and watch them burn! Lol.
---
you don't need hard bargain and travel agent 24/7, if at all.  guessing you are already in PA based on power user, so grab stabilzed instead.
---
Hahahahahahaha SC works better then thos shit
---
Think you forgetting this sub is a circle jerk. These ppl are all stupid
---
I'd like to clarify a few things because I may not be making myself entirely clear, and quite honestly I enjoy talking with people who have different experiences so I can learn more. (and you clearly have that experience in open source dev, and my main experiences with os is reading commits and changelogs in emulators such as dolphin.)
---
Testers and QA are the same thing. They don't get to accept or reject anything. They find a bug, they submit that bug through the automated system, give the bug a classification, and then off it goes to the dev team. Many publishers have their testers/QA offsite so they will never get to actually talk to the devs. It's just fill out a form in their system oftentimes using things like JIRA. Once it hits the dev team, they have to make the choice of whether to fix the bug, or label it with their own version of KS which can vary from company to company. 
---
The main reasons devs would not fix a bug are as follows:
---
1. Deadline. 
---
They have to get the game out the door at a certain time. These games have to get out, so the goal is pass cert, and if you can do anything after that, then fine. If it slips from it's release date, you see panic like ubisoft faced when it recently announced three of its games were slipping from their projected release. My contact at ubisoft says it really hit the whole place hard, especially in the marketing departments, where many people were very upset. 
---
2. Less priority. 
---
One person I talked to at ubisoft on the dev side literally had the lead tell them they wouldn't fix a bug where a player could fall out of the world if they took cover in a certain spot unless there was an uproar about it. Well, there was an uproar, but it was mainly over how they downgraded their graphics. I guess time proved him right in the long run. If a bug exists and they think a small percentage of players will ever find it or raise a stink about it, they won't fix it. Many times, the devs want to fix these bugs too, but a team lead will tell them there is simply no time and kick it out the door. Even big name games suffer from this. Madden 06 on the psp had a bug that would cause the psp to literally crash and power off in franchise mode. The game doesn't save until the quarter, so people were basically losing all their progress. EA's response? They didn't believe it was a widespread problem. Instead they offered a long PITA work around that involved saving every quarter or something. I'm not making that up. about three months later they eventually decided to replace copies if customers asked for them along with coupons. That's how little they cared.
---
3. Spite. 
---
Here's the difference between OS and corporate software. You people write the software, you fix the software. Very few os communities have dedicated testers. In the corporate world, testers are looking for problems, and devs don't want someone to tell them they made a mistake. It's an adversarial relationship by default, and for some, the chance to be petty overwrites their professionalism and there is literally nothing to stop them from taking that bug report, writing "could not reproduce", and slapping it back through the system. 
---
One of the reasons I maintain that Bethesda has some of the best testers is because for starters I've heard multiple people say as much, and also they're in-house. Most of them anyway. For a big release such as starfield they'll do a contract once it starts getting close to wrapping. Many publishers bring in contracted testers for their games and the moment they finish a game, they're laid off and have to find something new. 1-3 people are lucky if they're picked up after a project and that's for a big project such as your call of duty's, or your mass effects. QA in the game industry as a whole is the bottom of the barrel. Doesn't matter where you go, they're seen as lesser than any other department. In many places they're not even allowed to be in the same place as the dev team.  
---
The truth of the matter is, game companies don't like talking with their own testers outside of automated forms and through their lead. They already see them as second class citizens in their own company. how do you imagine they look at players like you? I can only imagine the spite and contempt they might feel when a player steps up and says "here's a problem with your code." I just had a horrifying thought. I've never had the chance to talk to a community manager. I wonder how the devs and such look them? I can't imagine they're very impressed. 
---
I want to believe that bethesda's bad decisions will hurt them in the end, but I don't have much hope of that happening. But hey, I like being wrong. 
---
If you have any good stories about open source communities, or places I can learn more about it, feel free to link away. I love learning new things, and os is one of my blindspots. If you'd like to know more about QA in the game industry, feel free to ask, and if I don't know, I'll pass it on to one of the people I do and see what they say.
---
I'm fairly certain it was on the radio in Fallout New Vegas, not Fallout 76.
---
Just FYI, having a prime weapon in your inventory isn't enough to let you make the ammo. You'll need to know how to make the 308. Learning the Prime hunting rifle plan will do this.
---
Never had a crash so far but have had lag, also the servers I have logged into have had stuff already looted.
---
Fair enough. A little pedantic, but fair point.
---
I saw it mentioned in a comment thread, I can't recall which one though.. (I browse like every new post daily)
---
oh ok cool cool
---
I think it might be new? I've never seen it myself just passing on what I've read.
---
but not as good as your spellchecker ?
---
Poor thing.....the Captain has spelt his name incorrectly. Is that why he is so bitter?
---
Pick up Barbarian and run that when you aren‚Äôt using heavy guns.
---
**Part I**  
---
Thanks!  
---
&gt;I actually am curious to hear your opinion on this part because TBH when  I first saw the OG post -  I feared it would make life way harder for  you and the others 
---
Several of the core people behind the datamining, bug tracking and general figuring stuff out were suspended or banned.  
---
What drove people like the Map76 author to just tap out was known Hackers/NW Cheaters (aimbots, flying) etc that were banned at the same time were unsuspended, many for "lack of evidence" 2 days after they were flagged, and he had heard nothing for 2 weeks.  
---
As for earning scorn...  
---
There is a strong Hate/Hate/Love relationship between the Dev's and people like us..    
---
Think of it as a 20 year veteran auto-mechanic being told he did something wrong by someone who's been working on a  "hobby"  car for 4 months.  
---
Doesn't matter if the "Hobbyist" is correct, it will still get under the skin of the Dev's..  
---
To Be Honest some of those involved though the ban and weeks without response was actually because of the Dev's.
---
&gt;From a distance - It's  seems eyebrow raising that there was a singular member (?) of the  'outside testing group' who decided to take the nuclear approach after  2-3 weeks   
---
Can't argue I would have waited longer before loosing my cool, or would have tried, but again honestly I've been close several times myself, and it might be me next.  
---
But for many involved this is a passion, something we've invested our hearts, time, etc into.  
---
Think of it like girlfriend of a year who just professed her love for you, getting caught cheating with a rando at a bar 2 days latter, most people would go nuclear immediately. 
---
Add in a good chunk of the community Trolls the hell out of us every chance they get, in game and on the forums (I've been reported countless times in game for "cheating" when working on replicating a bug so I could troubleshoot and then report the exact conditions, something required to solve the issue) so it's easy to see why he lost it, that and the Fallout1st membership they refused to refund, it's like another slap in the face.  
---
As for if it can be walked back, stranger things have happened, allot depends on Bethesda's response and his followup.  
---
&gt;**I fear for anyone trying to 'do  good' with CE that doesn't have it in cold hard writing that their  {test-username-here} isn't explicitly whitelisted internally.** 
---
Mentioned it before many of us though we were "Whitelisted" based on our previous interactions with Bethesda, Community managers etc, because as a whole people were not shy about discussing the tools used to find some of this information out.    
---
Turns out there wasn't one..
---
Hopefully this can be avoided in the future and there will be an official "White List", but once there is one how does one prove they are worthy of addition?  
---
&gt;**The big questions I think a lot of us who work around development teams have with certain people being allowed to use CS:**
---
* **How can you gatekeep the noble actors from the bad or at least self-interested?** *which flows into #2*    
---
You just have to find people you can trust, give them a few small chances and as they continue to not be jerks you give them more freedom.  
---
It's like the "Dallas" trip some of us took to speak with the Dev's early this year, we had an NDA, Bethesda used the NDA and the timeline of when we could discuss things to find out if we were worth more trust down the road.  
---
If they do anything with that established trust is up to them.  
---
* **How do you ensure successful &amp; trusted whitelisting?** *I'm sure that you and a few others have time and time again proven your ability - but has everyone or did some get in on grease?*  
---
Ironically asked this above before, that's the tough one, because it's Chicken/Egg.  
---
But anyone with an estabilished background and a pre-existing security clearance in RL would be a good "starting point", anyone Bethesda has worked with in the past who's not breached previously established trust.  
---
Established mod authors / Tool developers or those who for a couple months without fail provide something beneficial to the community?  
---
In the end you need a couple Gatekeepers who are good judges of character and you'll have to take chances.  
---
* **How do you manage reviewing?** *reviewing logs and then manually unblocking all of the 'new names' that could arise?*   
---
That's been discussed and there are some very very easy ways to do this... 
---
\-Provide "WhiteListed Accounts", it's easier to log and check the behavior of an account you have the full details and control over. There is still risk, but it's less significant.  
---
\-Review the work/help/information they've provided to online hours with that account...  If they have 1,000 hours logged and have only reported 3 issues, all minor, you have to question things..  
---
* **How can you tell intentions from a distance?** *that someone is using CE to fix things and not to find new ways to get around the Anti-Cheat-Agent?*  
---
Honestly Not that hard, people over think this allot...  
---
I think it was clear after my 3rd "Bug Roundup" post as I continued to refine process I wasn't Karma farming as alleged in the beginning, or trolling Bethesda and the Community, but putting in countless hours to try and improve things.  
---
People who do the same and create or refine tools, from Map76 to the wonderful guy who keeps the '76 branch of Xedit updated clearly have good intentions  
---
You also have conversations with people, I've had great conversations with multiple Community Managers, some better than others, but the established relationship allows you to get a feel for the people involved.
---
*
---
Part II  
---
* **How do you keep the real whopper exploits secret AF so that the selfish / 'bad-actors' never find out about them?**  
---
Seriously?  
---
We've tracked/discovered countless, likely well over 100, game breaking issues that we replicated, diagnosed, and then documented and reported that never made big news.  
---
My first could bug reports listed several that encouraged the Community Managers to reach out for details, just stating there was an "Exploit that allowed X" etc.   
---
We've proven the majority of the people trying to help can keep their mouths shut...    
---
but.....   
---
There will always be leaks.....  
---
It's hard not to talk about something when you are excited about the discovery, and even when discussing it with the people in the "known" sometimes someone wanders in (discord VC, Discord Channel, In game, or in real life) and the secret is compromised...
---
You just have to have some faith....  
---
Oh and generally if they don't have a Youtube channel designed to be clickbaity they are good, nothing against any specific "Influences" or "reviewers" but generally I think the majority are a waste of time and seem fairly narcissistic, but that's my unsolicited opinion.    
---
&gt;Obviously there are star players like  yourself where it's clear what your trying to do - 
---
Thanks?  
---
Don't think of myself as a star, just another person on Reddit, who is invested in his/her community.  
---
But even if I am, keep in mind I was a nobody not that long ago, I just kept doing the "right" thing and eventually made some progress.  
---
To be clear there are various qualities and calibers of Mod authors, and you shouldn't WhiteList all of them at once, and the whole thing to begin with should be invite only TBH.  
---
I don't say that to be an elitist, but it's the only way to keep the whole process from breaking down due to interest until Bethesda has Test servers for us to do this work on, or a different process to allow it to be "widely available"...  
---
&gt;*If  you were explicitly whitelisted by all means disregard this please -  but - if the creator of that map tool never*
---
Mentioned above but will state it again, there was an assumption, a false one, based on the fact it was widely known what was being done and how some of it was done.  
---
Without CE I did a ton of good work, but I also intentionally crashed servers to isolate and define the conditions of a Server crash issue.  
---
I didn't do it with permission, but I made sure to do it in a controlled and though out processes (Old world with only a couple people on it, New world I force created by joining a world with a group of 4, etc etc)  
---
The expectation was the information provided outweighed the inconvenience since it was done carefully.  
---
I could have been banned, and I would have appealed it, because I knew the risks and decided they were worth it.   
---
&gt;Anyways - I hope this doesn't make your life more difficult then it has  to be and doesn't burn your bridges with the actual dev team or their  handlers. Lord ZAX knows - your pretty much the 'account' we need to  hold them to 
---
Only time will tell, we've gotten mostly radio silence from the Dev's since we began doing what we do, firewalled by the Community managers, and they've not blocked us yet.... :)
---
all the time
---
Furious caps out eventually but on the other hand TS is inaccurate as hell, you'd miss half the shots especially on the queen when she's flying.
---
they can tho, as part of the gutsy killteam.
---
Seems like you are blind as a bat ...poor thing
---
I'm blown away you were dumb enough to pay for it.
---
This is asked twice a day, use search or try google, there's like 10 guides and 5 yt video's
---
I think at quake con they said the bow would get some new perks behind it and leaks showed that there's a lot of new mods for it. Hopefully it's put into the legendary pool as well.
---
I don't bother crafting fuel, too costly, easier to buy it from player vendors, almost always 1 cap each.
---
Them, Exactly.
---
Also you can place you camp next to a lead deposit and just mine it at your camp. Also gyms at prison, Charleston firehall, Flatwoods motel and various lead veins. Plus workshops which you can mine.
---
what kind of brain dead fanboys made a sub for this trash lmao
---
Ah, the classic "sitting duck" defense taught at military academies across the globe! :) I always get hate mail when I take out a swimmer. For some reason, people think being in the water is some sort of God mode. Still, to be fair, it's better than hiding in a bush. It takes some prep work to deal with a swimmer.
---
I can't even begin to imagine how jarring it would be, visually, to have our characters running around New Vegas's graphics.
---
Note that if you have someone Prime a weapon FOR YOU, you still may not be able to craft the Ultracite ammo for that weapon, making it essentially useless - or making you dependent on others. 
---
The ability to craft the ammo is unlocked by learning the Receiver plans. You may have already learned the Prime .308 Hunting Rifle plans, so feeding the LMG might not be a problem if someone mods it for you, but
---
Learned the hard way: won't be able to use my Action Hero once I burn through about 3k Ultracite.50 cal that we crafted, unless I get lucky with the SBQ
---
The comparison is internet witch hunts don't work, you absolute melon!
---
If on pc can do it and make some bullets if you need them will be on in a few hours time
---
Would you like to go see Disciple with me in December? I bet you'd love it!
---
gotta be brain dead to see anything good in 76
---
No offense, but you ever had yourself checked for Tourette's?
---
"Hahahahahahaha LMAO Hahahahahahaha LOL."
---
Maybe you got like a tic or something
---
You may have new bugs and a few useless additions. 
---
Besides scorchbeast after a year they decided they may need to spawn legendary sometimes. Probably the best update the games got since the backpack which I hated getting a tedious quest for.
---
Adventure mode would be a ghost town.  And thus this will never happen.
---
Pretty much.
---
I know it's my escape, to screw around in digital Appalachia with a bunch of friends.  That there isn't a true goal or endgame is beside the point, the fun is just doing stuff with others.
---
I also have about 40k Ultracite .50 cal. Not sure what they sell for though.
---
Give it a try
---
Its a block, not a restraining order. I'm fairly sure it only blocks the social interactions, I.e. friend requests, talking, etc. 
---
I get where you're coming from, I really do. I completely agree that if you block someone, they shouldn't be able to destroy your camp or even buy stuff from you. Workshops should still be fair game though, otherwise you could just block a potential opponent. But it's really, really, not a good idea for them to *not* be able to join the same server as you. I'll try to explain as best I can why. 
---
They *could* technically make it to where there's an algorithm to separate blocked players from those that blocked them, but that could be abused too, so much so that if a player was blocked by enough active accounts on different servers, there may not be a server for said player to join. Now, you might think "well if they were that much of a dick that's on them", but a large enough group of trolls could harass people by blocking a large number of players and then going on separate servers (such as server hopping until you don't see another one of them in the server) and potentially making it to where said players can't join *any* server at all. 
---
Not to mention the complexities of so many players each with their own potential blocks, organizing it to where none of them are on the server, and what if their friend wants to join but another player has blocked them? Do they get a message to move to another server? There are a massive number of servers, yes, but also an even more massive number of players, and while not all of them have blocked players, some of them have and it would get to the point where the algorithm may take a long time to find a world (and it already takes a long time to find a world), and you may not be able to play with your friends. 
---
Not to mention, there are so many ways to abuse that. Want someone's workshop with all their structures? Block them, then they get kicked from the server. A player attacking your workshop? Block them. Don't like someone and/or just want to be a dick? Block them. That would kick them from the server immediately.
---
Randomly getting kicked from a server because someone blocked you for potentially an arbitrary or an abusive reason is not gonna be a fun day. 
---
Some people are extremely sensitive and shouldn't be playing an online game, and get offended and/or block you if you do the slightest thing they don't like, such as take their workshop (I don't like doing it, but sometimes I will if I've server hopped a couple times and it's still in use and I need it), or loot something before them, and so on. I don't want the cry babies to be able to block and kick someone just because they aren't in a safe place in an online game with mild PvP elements. And believe me, I've run into a few of them, and I'm a nice guy. If I take a legendary and it's not for me, I'll ask anyone in the area if they could use it. Not scrap it for whatever the legendary bucks are called, but use it. I also gladly share items if someone needs it, etc. So I'm not a troll or a dick, and I'm sure I've been blocked a half dozen times. 
---
I know there are legitimate trolls and dicks out there trying to ruin other people's fun. I've run into a couple, and I blocked them then server hopped. (One I accidentally sent a friend request, so he followed me from world to world until I realized why, I'm an idiot sometimes...)  So I totally understand the type of players you're concerned about.
---
There's a report button for a reason. If a player is abusive to the point they shouldn't be interacting with you, much less other players, report them. That way Bethesda knows, and eventually, if enough people report them, they may get banned if the reports were legitimate and Bethesda actually gets to them.
---
here you go

get some unyeilding gear, get irradiated to &lt;20%, Share Strange in Numbers in a group, have fun
---
Really? I've not been in months as it was 100% a problem.
---
They must have fixed it, I'll try my hardest to get a legendary there tomorrow then.
---
ill repeat what i said in other comments,we should be only name and shame with video proof
---
Sure, just like those people who swore up and down that they had identified the bomber IN A FUCKING VIDEO.
---
You are spare parts, bud.
---
Nice map. That‚Äôs pretty much my endgame now.
---
silent aimbots are even worse because you never know if they are actually cheating or just lucky with the weapon spread
---
While Bethesda's recent behaviour is alarming, this has actually turned into my second favorite Fallout game.
---
Having played all the main line games, this one does offer a lot the others don't (and vice versa in regards to the prior games) but it's enough to keep me playing. Especially with the all amazing people I've met.
---
I play on XBox One and I don't have the issues that you have.
---
Out of curiosity, how big is your friends list?  I've heard that huge ones can cause issues like yours.
---
I thought it was under the chem bench. They move it?
---
I'm 38 and can hold my own pretty well but I've been playing fps since 007 goldeneye and was a major heavy hitter in halo and modern warfare. My game has slipped over the past ten years but so far it's been like riding a bike a little practice and it comes back though getting in that zone is a little slower now and focus is harder to maintain
---
If wastelanders was going to have features they would be showing them off. Don't expect anything but a meat day sized quest.
---
*cries in melee*
---
&gt;You are spare parts, bud
---
ah right the good old reddit insults
---
&gt;You selectively read my post, as I provided a clear example of YOU BEING BLAMED, because YOU WERE IN THE VIDEO
---
you really can't compare the boston bombings to video game cheaters but okay  have it your way
---
Yea your right, I enjoy it as well. But the means of getting pvp is what I think is crappy sometimes. I'm all for pvp. But the slap rule is poorly executed. And just hitting someone till they spark off isn't pvp. It's just like killing an afk player. It's a freebie. Now if they seek revenge then sure, gloves are off.
---
Mods are coming to Private Worlds only.
---
Okay? Don't know much about it.
---
Bethesda wants your money, not your points...
---
Then what the fuck are you here bitching about, go cry to Bethesda. You don't need internet warriors harassing people you think might be a cheater.
---
It's gonna be so disappointing if they manage to fuck up wastelanders even after a push back.
---
Just anything really, just want to see what were actually exited for
---
ditto
---
My main is unarmed, I use 1 rank each commando perks, rank 3 tank killer and a Hunters exploding bullet Handmade for these flying bastards.
---
 Bethesda should just give away copies of fallout 76 for free and let every one head down to their offices and take what ever players can fill their pockets with and give a full refund to every one who has bought this game and or all money spent on atoms.
---
all content and services should be free, i should not be made to pay for anything that i want.
---
i am the heart of all baby-men everywhere, and this is my cry.
---
Aim for a Bloodied pipe revolver, you can get the base damage up to around 300 or so
---
Honestly I have a 1st subscription at the moment, but if wastelanders falls flat that sub is going and I probably wont be playing much more after that until modding arrives (if it arrives)  
---
I need new content at the point since Ive been playing since the beta on basically 1 character
---
Stupid autocorrect!  Photo Gallery....
---
Stealth is still bugged, it quits working after a while.  I carry a space chameleon piece in my quickwheel that I swap out periodically. It worked in Survival to keep my chameleon active against other players.
---
No, I think the game should just be **stable at all**. You don't pay extra to upgrade from a buggy game to a stable one, you pay for the stable one when you buy the game in the first place.
---
They are NOT recycled servers, Bethesda responded to this over two weeks ago:  *Regarding recycled servers, Bethesda denied that players are getting used or recycled worlds. ‚ÄúWhen a Fallout 1st member starts a Private World, a dedicated world is launched on an \[Amazon Web Services\] server. Players who have seen looted containers upon login may be experiencing the expected behavior upon log out and log in. Loot is instanced for each player in containers. As Fallout 76 players know, if you loot a container on one server, and then log out and log back in to another server, the container remains in a ‚Äòlooted‚Äô state for a period of time.‚Äù*
---
What else is there to say? They're too busy trying to insert what they've shown in-between the existing bugs.
---
Seriously, don't get your Hope's up for Wastelanders. It will be a huge accomplishment if it doesn't blue screen everytime your within an arms length of an instanced NPC.
---
&gt;Take your salty ass home, kid.
---
idk you are the one here writing novels and calling me a bunch of names
---
should apply your advice to yourself
---
also this isn't gta online so stop
---
I hop on just to see what's new. No real point of buying the subscription when I barely play. Games got more stable but content hasn't been added much. So wastelanders is either gonna make or break it for me.
---
Expect? No
---
It does not bypass passive.
---
Can you have more than one pet?
---
I think the game just can't tell if ur spot is occupied or not before loading &amp; checking.
---
If my assumption is correct, they could implement an auto-join-other-server-system but it still would need to load &amp; check, maybe several times without letting u know  &amp; without the option to stay. Resulting in a very long loading screen &amp; just wasting the same amount of time.
---
We move on if people are in passive.
---
Vanguards baby
---
With nothing else on the horizon its the only thing i have hopes on at all, i wasnt interested in nuclear winter or vault raids, so ive been experiencing a peesonal content dry spell since spring
---
I already have the ammo been making it like crazy bro yuh
---
I got the subscription in the meantime for the cheaper atoms each month so when they release a bundle i want i can get it for technically cheaper, i dont play everyday at this point just every now and then to stay in touch with my fallout friends and do some challenges for more atoms
---
You guys really have that good of luck with farming these?
---
Blow out your ass pedant.
---
They probably didnt have any tech they wanted.
---
I'm level 235. I don't run any dr or health perks and win almost every game. I'd rather use perks that make my offense stronger.
---
That sucks. Title made chuckle a bit though, first thought was "neo, is back in the matrix."
---
Camden Park, on the floor next to some wooden blocks in the shed with 'The Boss' robot.
---
Haha it is definitely worth the trip back down there!
---
That made me snort my drink.
---
I‚Äôm on console, no hackers here.
---
What a joke of a game
---
A long time ago, when pvp servers were just coming out, I did a video on this though twitch (it's gone now because of how keeping videos there works, anyways)  
---
Stealth has all kinds of issues with one of them being distanced rendered. Basically if someone is running around in your area and you just happen to be outside their depth of field or render distance, the moment they get in close, even if you are in stealth for you and maybe 1 person next to you, that person sees you perfectly fine. They can even vats you 50/50. Your team members can run to far away, turn to look at you, and suddenly you are no longer in stealth. This bug works with the Chameleon mutation in the worst way as the mutation will make you blink and cannot be fixed unless you pop a stealth boy, take off or put on weightless chameleon or normal Chameleon armor (then take it off) to reset the effect. It isn't even a garrote that this will work. 
---
Stealth also has a duration issue when it comes to stealth boys but, by now we all know that these are features, not bugs, and surprise manics designed to keep us on our toes/ point of rage quitting. Working as intended.
---
With the terrain of 76, and general gameplay of the fallout series, I find the most effective approach is to "always make sure you ARE the closest to the outside of the ring OR have the impassible obstacle between you and the centre of the ring." Basically always seeking the flank.
---
I've accidentally outflanked a team of three that was downing my own team by just bumbling around moving clockwise or counter clockwise around obstacles and whatnot. 
---
When I have gotten my multi-kills, my team and the enemy team intercept each other as two lines, with combatants storming to the right or left of these lines. I happen to be on a ridge or otherwise have elevation, and I can see the entire enemy team and they don't notice me.
---
Seriously!  I‚Äôve always wanted a casual ‚ÄúI play after my real job‚Äù matchmaking system.
---
Yes, tried to fast travel to the Whitespring and ended up in cranberry bog, can't remember the place but needless to say, it was definitely not the Whitespring.
---
C O N T E N T *pogchamps*
---
Yeah lol
---
Doesn't matter. I'm also on console but they don't make platform specific changes. You can't have pc hackers gaining tons of atoms.
---
Blocked people can show up on your NW team so wouldn't be hopeful.
---
This...

Yes, I've just published a new guide. You can have an idea of how "lucky" it can get: [https://youtu.be/S34j7Xq9fbg](https://youtu.be/S34j7Xq9fbg)

Id like to see more of america added to 76 in the future. Is it too out of the realm of possiblity to imagine someone spending a full day walking from one state to another

I guess it is all rng, my luck is garbage though.
---
People can‚Äôt do that stuff on console ‚Äúpc master race‚Äù my ass

Fuck yeah. That was my jam as well, RTS everything. But due to friends being obsessed with Halo and stuff, I found myself playing that often too
